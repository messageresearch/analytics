precious Lord oh I thank you Father thank you Jesus thank you Lord Lord I need another touch [Music] [Music] [Music] just pleas softly with our heads B and before we pray I [Music] was I was meditating yesterday and just uh thinking on some few things and and this was very comforting I was listening to the message of last night and there was something on question and answer but this came very comforting I'll read this to you and and then we will pray it again and there's just been a little something wrong around the Tabernacle year for a long time I wanted to find it when I find that then I'm going to see if I can do something about it that's right and I want the church to move along in Harmony and there's just a little something wrong because you are not progressing and when I read that I mean I was listening to that I was lying down and I just said I said Lord what a comfort that that was uh to me and and is it's being a wi that [Music] uh I just feel like uh the enemy been doing as much as he can do to to handle God's people he's been doing as much as he can do to handle our worship and handle our progress in the word and handle our fellowship one with [Music] another and just like I said it came to com it came as a comfort to me when I say that uh it is not only us that feel this way you see there are many places you talk with different servant of God and you see what God's people are going through and and I just believe is the enemy trying to handle our Rapture he trying to handle our body change he trying to handle us from going into his presence it does not bother the devil if you just remain a church member Satan do not bother if you just warm the benches or the seat that you sit on but to be able to take that step into God's presence and and have a surrounded life and have a life consecrated to God it worries the devil and that's what he don't want to see to see a church moving under the power of the Holy Ghost that's what the devil do now one he don't care if you have a religion without Christ as long as you can have a christless church or a christless religion it do not batt the devil but when you want that power of the Holy Ghost when you want a lifechanging gospel you want a lifechanging relationship with Jesus Christ that's what shake the devil in his boots Heavenly Father oh we just lift our hearts to you again Lord oh God what a comfort this was to me last night Lord because that's the way I have fail Lord that there is just something that right to God and oh Father Lord God just like your servant said Lord if we find it we would do something about it and oh God I pray that father you would just move in a special way as your children has made the sacrifice to be here tonight come and bless our effort Lord come and bless their sacrifice driving from work driving from home oh God and we just pray that Lord you would come oh God God come and meet us tonight father we love you we thank you precious Lord and we just

trust the Lord to be able to say something else tonight to encourage each and every one of us praise the Lord thank you for being here deceiving we want to continue in a little bit on on where we stop on on Sunday day I went home and and uh so tired from the trip in the weekend taking up the service on Sunday but uh we're able to find some rest let's go to St Luke chapter 4 St Luke chapter 4 in Luke chapter 4 so Luke chapter 4 let's uh let's read from verse 21 in Luke chapter 4 let's read from verse 21 and he began to said unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ear and all be him witness and wonder at the gracious Words which proceed out of his mouth and and they said is is not this Joseph's son and he said unto them yeeh said unto me this proverb physician healed theirself praise the Lord whatsoever We Have Heard done in companion do also year in thy country and he said verily I say unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country amen or among his own people but I tell you of a truth many widows were in Israel in the day the days of Elias which is Elijah we read about on Sunday when the heavens were Shut Up 3 years and 6 months this was what I was referring to on Sunday that Jesus ascribed to Elijah closing the heavens for 3 years and 6 months when great farming was throughout all the land but unto none of them was Elijah s Sav un sarata a city of zom unto a woman there was a widow amen let us pray father we have just read a portion of your word and we ask that Lord you bless it now and uh take the content out of it Lord father speak to our house tonight something Lord to encourage us we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen we love the Lord tonight you praise the Lord thank you sister Julia Julia is your name Julia okay praise the Lord that's my wife so you know why why she talking like that praise the Lord and uh uh the sister visit was the last time I was gone in the week uh uh from uh speaking there in Tennessee and uh uh normally we will we will send uh a text message to our guest if we if we get their number so then I was talking to brother Ariel in the weekend I says hey I wish i' I had you over to the church I wanted for you to do something for me uh Wednesday night I I I was not able to call the deacons uh to get but for some reason I had her on my mind that I needed to send her the text message so I was here today and and uh and just before I left I was reminded so I sent her a text message and said well thank you for coming to visit with us the last time I just appreciate her for coming and uh walking through the doors and and just visiting with us and U so on my way back then she text me back and says do you have service tonight I say I said yes we have service and you are welcome praise the Lord so we thank the Lord that she were able to make it and come in fellowship with us praise praise the Lord tonight I want to continue from where I was uh I don't know if it is where I stopped but what I was speaking on on on Sunday night uh uh uh brother brother Steve Cass said that was a strange Mother Day service amen or a strange Mother Day Simon and uh and then he asked me his question so I will share his question with you uh that he that he that he had his hand up to to ask praise the Lord amen so brother Steve question he wanted to ask on uh uh uh Sunday was from uh the reading there in Deuteronomy where the Bible talks about uh uh you know God taking care of the fatherless and uh the weedos and uh and the strangers and uh and and but brother Steve said when I talk about it I said the offense instead of saying the fatherless you know the Bible says the fatherless what are you talking about the orphans I mean uh you you are saying the more like people that loves father and mother so uh so we talked about it a little bit and I thought that uh that was that that was that was a good question good question in a sense that you see the Bible is written in such in such a uh mysterious Way by inspiration that it say things without saying it when I say it say things without saying it is in the sense that you will you will uh uh the Bible there is talking about how God you know uh uh show his love and care for the fatherless and the reason that is is pleasing it that way because of headship the the the father is the head of the home praise the Lord so it is not only that when a person lost their father that uh you know uh uh God shows them special attention but even if they lost their mother because we quoted the scripture there uh uh he says if your mother and father forsake you the Lord will pick you up you know so uh uh parent is normally put under uh uh uh the father because he's the head of the home praise the Lord so the Bible using fatherless it goes to speak more of if the person lost both father and mother or lost uh uh mother and father is still alive L's father and mother is still alive you know uh so that's that was just the way that the scripture used it now you will also see that the Bible talks about the Widow it never talks about the widower it's the same thing you know God will also take care of a man when he losses his wife just like he would take care of a woman when she lost her husband praise the Lord you know so if the Bible should just use and describe every word we will not have a boat to carry praise the Lord and that's the reason why it's written that way the Bible is written in quots it's written in between the line and when you read it you understand that it's covering both father and mother while I was thinking about that uh uh uh uh talk to Brother Steve on on Sunday after church but there was there was something that came to my mind and uh if I try to go into to there tonight I will be completely out of order because it it does not have to do anything that I have I'm talking about tonight but you will see places where uh I can give you an example if you look in the Book of Matthew uh the Bible gave one father for Joseph the husband of Mary if you look in the Book of Luke the Bible gave another name for Joseph father the reason there is that in some places the Bible never use the word father in Lord it don't use the word father in Lord rather it cause a man that is a son- inlaw the Bible will call him a son to the wife father why because if you remember the daughters uh uh uh of zapi back in the days of Moses when those four daughters of zapi when their father died they never had a brother so they went to the elders and said what will become of our father inheritance seeing that we don't have a brother to be able to take over the inheritance and it spoke to Moses that was one of the last judgment that Moses made before he died so what happened there is that the the Moses told them for the inheritance to remain in the family uh whoever marry that girl in the family I immediately that boy becomes a son to to to to that family why because he's taking the family inheritance are we together he becomes a son praise the Lord amen you see that's and that is the reason why uh uh you know uh uh we we we we have a society that is that is far driven away from Biblical truth praise the lord we feed on the media we feed on uh Google we feed on uh uh everything that the society is giving us far driven away from Biblical truth and that's the reason why we have lot of arrogancy and disrespect and uh uh uh uh you know a young man going to take a man's daughter and he just think that I'm in love with the girl I don't care for the father praise the Lord before you ever get attracted to her there was a man that raised her up praise the Lord Brother de father used to say he says that he says there is nothing like son-in-law you marry my daughter you are my son take the in-law keep the inlaw for yourself if you cannot respect me just like you will respect your father then there is no no way that man is going to respect you if he can't respect your dad he will never respect you praise the Lord I'm not into that tonight I want to stay in the live with my talk but I'm just answering brother Steve question so you will see that there are places the Bible did not use explicit word because people get confused why they call this person Joseph father and in this other scripture oh the Bible is is is is uh is uh you know uh uh like one one instance you will see the Bible says that uh when when when when Michel the the the daughter of Saul when she laughed at uh at David for dancing because of the act of the Covenant God came down and told her that you know that she she would not have a child but when you go in the book of Chronicles the Bible tells you that Michel has a child praise the Lord why because the process of adoption is not explained but if you study you will realize that it is not only when a woman give birth to a child that she's a mother but when she adopt a child then she's a mother so the Bible is not contradicting itself it's just that we are not reading between the lines are we together now so we want to talk about our mother day canidate amen we want to talk about our mother day candidate praise the Lord in the in the in the in the denomination Church they would they would make her the mother of the year and they put crown on her head and they put ribbon all around her and it make some money out of her praise the Lord because you got to come and you got to come and satisy the mother there go and pain her with all of your dollar building $2 building $100 bill the church know how to make money praise the Lord so this this woman that we were looking at and uh I actually took that because I wanted to explain that place in the book of Deuteronomy that I was telling you about I'm I'm going to go in a different direction I just want to use that year be setting of God if let let's just read uh uh uh uh this little little portion yeah little quot here about this about this uh uh wonderful woman how that this little woman must have been of the caliber of Elijah how is it how is it now look at the scripture that we read we spoke on this long one time ago you know we we we get attracted to a place that Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled and for many of us message believer that's where our our our verses ends but watch what happened after Jesus have spoken to those people and saying this day this scripture is fulfilled he went right into the temple he went right there he passed the high priest he took the straws before every one of them God Frozen the the the the entire sedan Council to look at this young man and he opened to our and he read we know the story about that but after he had read that the Bible says all the eyes of the people were on him and people were saying wow wow he speaks with authority is that not the carent son is that not Joseph's son then he says to them he says you will say this Parable you will soon tell me physician physician heal Yourself Praise the Lord amen so uh uh uh and and and then when he says that to them he in return bring up something that we want to look at tonight he in return speak to them and says verily I said unto you no Prophet is accepted in his own country that is something that we know commonly but what I want us to look at tonight he says but I tell you a truth many Widow were in Israel in the day of Elijah when when the heaven was shot for three years and 6 months when great farming was through throughout the land but none of them now what was Jesus referring to he have just went through the temple and he's still standing in the temple when he's making the statement he have just went through the temple he broke the church orth he went over there he took the straw he read it to the people and then uh uh uh and he's making this statement what was he referring to when he says many Widow when you hear the word many and one was choosen among many what do that what does that bring to your mind anyone have an Insight tonight what does it bring to your mind election election I mean that you will have many and one will be choosing from the many that's election so Jesus was trying to bring he was placing the Widow in election so I'm speaking tonight the Widow in election he was he was placing that old woman in election that God and and and that's what uh uh uh uh the man of God is trying to refer to here that we are reading he he says here the uh how that this little woman must have been of the caliber of Elijah how how how did she reach to that place to be of the Cali that that that that a prophet will want to associate himself with her why was it about her now Jesus many years after is making us to know because of el ction praise the Lord just the same as with the woman at the word many years after brother bam will let us to know because of representation are we together amen Harry said that she's she's of of a Cali of el Elijah because usually your action shows what you are and again she have been chosen that's the word she have been choosing to entertain that's what election is all about Paul says right there in Ephesian that's what he said that he choose us from the foundation of the word she have been choosen to entertain God's Prophet remember she was a gentile and not a Jew can you imagine Jesus standing right in the synagogues with all of those Jewish priests around him and then he picking up a gentile woman but you see the contrast there is that he's associating a gentile woman with a Jewish prophet that there were many pro many Widow in the land but yet Elijah was sent to the house of the Widow of zarap are we together oh that's that is something that's supposed to is supposed to Rejoice our heart and the land was burning of no doubt that that this woman being a calba being of the believer type for we see that God would not have called her if she hadn't had been a worthy one to entertain God's Prophet for we for for he he he will have never sent his Prophet to the house that was unworthy it was not the beauty of the house praise the Lord think about the story in mephis that we called anti jimama praise the Lord and another woman that had the her experience with God and and and Y said and and and again she's a widow woman you know raising of her son and Y said the boy is now in trouble because of the the the wrong choice that he have made and he's sick and this woman is crying to God and say Lord my only son be merciful my only son have mercy on this boy and save him and she's crying to God and and and and pretty soon she takes her condition and place it in the scripture she place it right in the very condition with this woman of zapi Praise the Lord and say God if you don't send an Elijah my son is going to die you send an Elijah to that widow woman house remember me Lord I call into your word where is where is M Elijah never even knew that there was an Elijah Ministry on the land but she said God where is my Elijah hallelujah praise the Lord and I believe that God might have given her a not in her spirit and said just go outside I will send my Elijah praise the Lord and about early in the morning this woman went out that's why brother BR call her an jimama because he says when you look at that that uh that photo of uh of uh uh that pancake it's a old photo back in the city that he call into Jim and he says that just how she look you know she had a shirt tie around her head she went out right to her gate praise the Lord maybe leaning over the gate and just waiting praise the Lord and just waiting this was not a text message thing this was not a phone call thing this was a woman that got in contact with Heaven she got in contact with Heaven praise the lord we get in contact with social media more than we get in contact with Heaven this woman got in contact with Heaven praise the Lord and Heaven told her to go and wait and answer to her prayer is coming and there she Hing right over the gate and she's waiting praise the Lord hallelujah she's waiting and she's watching thank God she didn't have a cell phone to be strolling Elijah will have come and pass and he he didn't even knew where he was going his P his playing his ground grounded he thought okay let me just go and post some milk and then he got down he post the MEK and then he decided to take a stroke we'll go and take a stroll when your plane is grounded who go take a stroll praise the Lord glory be to God you know we can thank God even though they they never have all the gadget that we had today but they live in the most safe World they never had TSC TSC was not back then praise the Lord so he came out go go post his M and then just get down on a dirt road and start walking just feeling his heart I need to go down this road and he's walking down the road and and kept going and and kept going now you think about it now the woman was more on expectation and that prophet of God had no idea what was going on praise the Lord amen that woman was more in tune with God on expectation for what was going to happen what was uh H controlling the even was the faith of that widow woman a Fai of a desperate woman that needed God to come on the scene for her son because he's a God that reward those that diligently seek are we together and this uh this uh uh uh uh man of God just walking down the road whistling I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad to to say I'm one of them he's just going down the road and yes the woman there sitting there and says a good morning pass praise the Lord I believe he jack wow people know me here he's thinking that maybe she might have seen me in the meeting she said no the Lord told me you were coming praise the Lord because I'm just like that woman in zarapa I have a boy in there that is about to die the woman say I'm going to make the last meal that we can eat and die praise the Lord what what what an association glory be to God for us to realize that uh H uh that God has made us associate to angels He says uh h h h h h uh he gave his angels to income About Us Praise the Lord the kind of Cali that we have the way that he he weighs us and he value us to give his angels charge over our life to be at our Command that is what was happening here with this woman are we together it was not his choosing it was God's choosing it wasn't her biding him it was God bidding him he had been placed by a brook and the Raven were feeding him but it was God command for something to take place and God surely went to a believer of the same nature of Elijah amen praise the Lord hallelujah now so you just think about it this was just right after Elijah went up there on on my C and he challenged uh all the prophets of God if if if you know if your God be God let Fire come down from heaven praise the Lord and a happen and and all the Jewish group and all the religious group the sons of the prophets and every one of them were on the mountain but you see there was a poor widow woman amen that when Elijah spoke and said Lord I have done all of this by your word she said there is nothing but the truth praise the Lord she might not been in the crowd but this was a woman that that who says that if if a man if God can can use a man to say I there would not be a due drop until I call for it if God can can honor the word of a man like that then that man must be a man of God praise the Lord maybe she was not even in the meetings maybe she just heard what Elijah said that there will not be rain or de until I call for it maybe she just hear it why why there is no rain how are we going to make somebody says well you don't know that that that Elijah that crackhead man said there was not going to be rain and Ahab is looking for him all over the place maybe down in her heart she said that surely should be a prophet praise the Lord just that little little faith down in her heart echo in heaven and God saw her as being the chosen one to take care of his Prophet amen glory be to God but you see when uh on Sunday we were looking at some of the condition around what could make a person a widow and sometimes what could make a we life difficult we're looking at H and white and was talking about how she lost her husband and her son's witness her husband he said and then when I went home you know I was just there all of that was flooding back in my mind and I was just thinking sometimes sometimes and many times is some of the things that we don't understand we become so judgmental when we see people and the things that they go through and sometimes we don't know the backstory we don't know the things that they deal with that build lot of complex in their life that make uh you know the it it set your mind in a path just imagine the story we read on Sunday that a young boy uh of of a teenager will get in the field and see his own father dying on his structure blood coming from his nose his ear and mouth praise the Lord to realize that he would not have a die like the rest of his friends and the prophet say something came over that boy praise the Lord something came over that boy what are you Believe It Or that for the rest of our life that we will live is greatly influenced by the things that happen to us when we were little the things that happened when we were little it affects your life and sometimes it puts you in a path that if God don't reach down his hands and bring you out there is nobody that will deliver you praise the Lord sometimes uh the the the the the the a treatment and the resentment you know that that a person goes through when they are a child it it it creates such a complex in them it gave them such a a a sense of bitterness and you think about it that this person that is that is that is that is that have grown up like that being angry from their youth and and just bitter and resentful think about that person being a father think about that person being a father he's going to W all that anger on his children in most time he's not angry with his children he's taking it as protection yes he's think that he's trying to protect his children from what he went through no you will not protect them why because you were not delivered right that's right are we together I bring you a little story here I mentioned there on Sunday about John the Baptist let's read a little bit maybe that will that would give us give us some picture here uh uh okay I get a few minutes here let's uh let's take conven then concern let's stay convinced then concerned and praise the Lord now notice that Zacharias and Elizabeth as they were well stricken in Edge that's the parents of John the Baptist like I said John was born when his parents were already old praise the Lord John was born when his parents were already old there is not much you you I was thinking about that you you you think about that over in the book of of of of Ruth it talks about boas you will realize that when Ruth gave birth there was nothing said about boas again why because boa was a old man he was not not a young man Ruth was a young woman but boas was a old man now so with with uh with uh uh uh uh John parents being old that they were not even expecting to have a child and he will be born at this time let's read a little bit here and not Zacharias and Elizabeth as they were well stricken in age they knew that they would not be able to live out the the spin of Life long enough to see their son what God have for him in stored but they they know that God was with him because the Holy Ghost has promised that promise and they know God will take care of their son now I call into history they died when he was about 9 years old you know what after I said that on Wednesday on on Sunday morning I went back and I was looking in the scripture and I realized that we have said when John came out of the Wilderness he was 9 years old you realize that is just only a a historical account it's just a historical account praise the Lord go check your Bible you find it let me know maybe you will teach me something it's just a historical account the Bible only speaks of John coming out of the Wilderness and preaching but yet out of History we realize that his parents died at that time you think about it a boy just at the age of n years this one is not Ling only his father or and and I I don't believe that both of them died at the same time I don't believe that I believe that Zacharias might have died uh earlier than uh uh uh you know than Elizabeth and then John will witness and see how that religious system will re reject his mother he will witness and see how with all that his father did in the temple serving the people and making in uh incense and preparing the place and all of that he will he will witness and see how the church can be mean I'm telling you if you have a Christianity without Christ is an evil thing reler without God inside is wicked that's the reason why I encourage you to meet God get to know God and don't tell me that you are in the message because we I have seen horrible things that have happened in the message John will witness that as a young boy maybe Zacharias might have died when he was 6 years old for the matter fact that Zacharias after John was born and Zacharias will come and and and and and and the Bible says when John was born they were thinking how to name the baby and they said we will call him after his father H H uh uh uh Zacharias Elizabeth said no she said no h Zacharias have told me he has written on paper that that's not the name of the boy the angel told Zachariah now you also have to understand from the scripture that the sedran council was splitted because the sades don't believe in Angel and the Pharisees believe in Angel praise the Lord now so with this split in the sah hindrance Council you realize that h h h h uh uh John is about to lost his job because only his never he's not uh h h h h confessing that he met an angel but he's also going to associate himself with this young girl that said Angel spoke to her when everybody believed that she has gone to play a harot and now she's pregnant she's confessing that she's met an angel you have to realize that it was right in the house of uh of Elizabeth that Elizabeth will realize that Mary have have have got an experience now for John to be born and John would tell the people that the angel that visited me is the Angel Gabriel it says doesn't that sounds familiar is it now what Mary said what has come over this family John will lost his job he's going to go jobless the people that he have love and he have S are going to reject him Zachariah not John praise the lord they're going to kick him out of the priest's office because while he's associating himself with a heresy and little John will grow of hearing his parents hearing his mother tell telling Zacharias how can they be so mean to you we give our life for these people we could have moved to different city we still right here we Ser the how can they be so mean to you zachari what have we done that's how Wicked religion can be that's how evil Church Without Christ can be glory be to God like I said we're not making the church here praise the lord we are following the word and if you are not ready to follow just you can find another place may God help us and give us Grace and John how strange these fellows are now it looks like that John being out of the home of a priest that he's being a religious man and knowing there was a called in his life he would have went right straight down to the school and become a priest like his father that would be the thing that was easier and you know sometime what makes it easier if John will have witnessed the people supporting his father it would have made it easy for him to go right to the priest's office he have gone right in that order but all he witnessed was rejection all he witnessed was rejection and that's all seeing his mother crying and after Zacharias would die none of the we even come to the barrier glory be to God now you will see why John when John came out of the Wilderness he never had a message of compromise praise the Lord this is a board from years old I had to bring himself up he had to bring himself up it was supposed to be easy his father was a well-known priest the Bible say he was a righteous man the Bible says Zacharias was a righteous man man the only problem they had with Zacharias was he saw an angel praise the Lord for them to rejoice in the fact that this man that when all of his life childless God has given him a child that was not concerning to them you see when people get so dogmatic with their belief when their belief has eaten them they don't even see truth put truth to their face they will never see it yes why because their mind and their spirit is so conditioned let's let's forget about the angel let's forget about the angel what maybe maybe he lying but the fact about the matter there is that he said something told him he will have a child we knew this man when he was young all of his life he was not even thinking about being the father and God comes on the S and visit him just to bring an encouragement to the people something to help them for them to believe what Mary is saying something that will help them so so Mery testimony will not just be an isolate God comes down and visit this old couple and give them a baby but that's not the concern to the people we don't believe in angels Don't say that rubbish here we don't believe it that's how mean religion can be praise the Lord that's how evil tradition can be when you are not ready to bend no matter how much truth is put before you no matter how much truth is put before you when you just talk in yourself it has to be your way or the highway you get down on your knees and ask God God is this you think about that praise the Lord Dr have witnessed the rejection from the system the evil and all of the thing that a widow mother oh Widow mother might have gone through all the ugly words that people said to her when she went into the marketplace that little child was feeding on all those things that's the same way our children feed on the things that we say they feed on it the mind of a child is just like a sponge if you can't take it anymore then it's leak it out oh blessed be the name of the Lord God be merciful God be merciful amen the council could not agree on inures Zachariah might have lost his job after all of his years of service after all of his years of service the one that was one of their famous Pastor praise the Lord they don't want to have nothing to do with him they don't want to have nothing to say about him how praise the Lord that's the way we are we kill all our heroes praise the Lord they are dead in the grave before we say they are nice Brothers we kill our heroes Heroes supposed to be people that are alive fighting and I'm just I'm just you know kind of thinking on all of these things in my mind what that little child could go through at 9 years old praise the Lord what might have led him in the wilderness he were LED in the wilderness by the spirit of God a 9y old boy put let's our senses come together sometimes we make things too spiritual that we lose senses a 9 year old boy going into the Wilderness when you fully agree with your child at 9 years old when they tell you that the spirit of God is leading me to Walmart that's what happens sometimes people get so spiritual until they lose Common Sense this child is hurt he's broken he have seen the evil of religion that will even put him in a condition for him to be even able to hear a voice voice to be convinced that is God speaking to him when all he have known that his parents serve God all of their life and see how they were treated do you think a child like that will want to serve God praise the Lord I just have a few minutes here let me read something to you seed of God but I close here find a place to close and remember that we we found we found one mistake that the mark of the beast is a mark of apostasy that is church members hanging to their church instead of walking in the light church members hanging to their church instead of walking in their light praise the Lord glory be to God it's easy for us to say we are not in denomination but are we walking in the light or are we just hanging to the fact that we baptized in Jesus name hanging to the fact that uh uh uh I mean we having a pillow of fire picture in our house or what are we walking in the light are we just hanging to our church because let it just come down to that place sometimes you find people you know I mean even in the message just start to blast a denominational system they get crossed in their Spirit you wonder whether they have really come out you wonder really whether they are really delivered out of that system because it's a spirit it's not only a system it's not just a building it's a spirit that we need to be delivered from as a child I saw the evil of the church we used to go for choir practice there in in the Methodist church and just as a little boy and I could see all the nastiness of loving and and and all the filthiness in my mind mind in my poor innocent mind I used to be sitting down and thinking is is it the kind of a thing that should be happening in church you see that's that's what it takes for God to bring you out praise the Lord you have to see the evil and you have to HTE it yes sir you have to see the wrong praise the Lord for you to be delivered from anything thing you have to see the evil of that thing and you must get angry with it sir you must hit it and say that I just hate this thing I don't like it if not you will always go back to it if you don't hate it you love it you cannot be in the middle hanging to their to their church instead of Walking In The Light they reject the light and there is nothing left but Darkness that's right both catholism and protesting praise the Lord and even message churches the same there's a whole lot here we can we can read about that young boy and what he went through I'm just trying to bring you just trying to bring you to a place to understand can you even realize after John will go all through that he will go all through that that tough life just for a six month's Ministry he will come out and say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the word and then John will be put in praising he will send his disciples and say go and ask is he really the one do you know what was going through his mind after everything I've gone through and yeah he's sitting down in the dungeon waiting to be beheaded tell God bring us an innerchange and you have to identify it you have to identify it it's not just this uh you know you know in the message I baptized in Jesus name I think I have the Holy Ghost you have to identify it you have to look down there in your spirit and find that thing that you think is hindering you glory be to God we have many many even around this glorious message that have seen the evil of the church they have seen the evil of the church we have a a generation you know the Bible says there was a pharaoh that never knew Joseph it was not only a pharaoh but there were also a people that did not know what Joseph went through for them to be a free people in Egypt they didn't know what he went through that he had a capital punishment on his head we have a generation but you
