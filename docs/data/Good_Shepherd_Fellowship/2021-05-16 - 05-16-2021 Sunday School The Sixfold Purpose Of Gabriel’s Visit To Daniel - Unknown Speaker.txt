[Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so what really is the ceiling of watch he come to do that to seal up the vision and the prophecy now let's just turn right back to the book of daniel where we was at over in the book of daniel we will find out just what it says now let's turn to daniel the 12th chapter now as we get to daniel 12 now we can begin and read from when you go home and once you read the first verse on let's just read from the first verse down to the fourth and at that time michael shall stand the great prince which will stand for the children of thy people now this is at the end time and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since the nation that's when the antichrist this first seal rider goes forth when he takes place even until this time not of the time that when titus tucked the walls of jerusalem that was only one place watch when this antichrist that prince that was to come watch when he comes even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that's found written in the book amen thy people israel shall be written in a book and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contentment how in the world could that have been when titus tucked the walls of jerusalem how could it have been it couldn't be amen see he's speaking of the end time at the resurrection is that right now and they that the y shall shine as the brightness of the firmaments and they that turn away that turned manny to rises to stars forever listen here is the real true ceiling but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of [Music] this revelation of jesus christ and of his power of his coming of the end time was sealed up until this time that's what he come to do it's hidden from the scholars no wonder they want to apply sealing it up back under the north prophets and everything way back it won't hold water but the vision this vision has been sealed to right here now and that's where i'm placing my faith that god will reveal them seventy weeks amen hallelujah see that up he said till the end close up the words and seal the book praise the lord until the end time what do you do to seal up the vision and the prophecy daniel had prophesied these things he saw it in a vision and the angel come down to seal the vision and to seal the prophecies they can read it but can't understand it until the end time the end time what is the end time the end of the 70th week when that prince antichrist will be revealed at this time making himself god how do we know this is sealed up to the time daniel just got through this was the last chapter of daniel sister simpson told me this afternoon she said brother branham i read the entire book of daniel i i just didn't know more when i stopped got through than it did when it started here it is sister simpson if you're here tonight i believe i see her sitting over there i never said nothing in the trailer i held my peace because i thought maybe i'd get to it but the vision that daniel had saw down there for the river was sealed up until the end time it's let me just go ahead and read it here see but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the end time many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase and i daniel looked and behold there stood two one on one side of the river and one on the other side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed in in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders now listen and i heard the man clothed in linen which is up on the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swear by him that live forever and ever that it shall be for a time time and a half time now we get right right at exactly time time and a half time are you watching me getting daniel 70 weeks how that comes out that's when the mystery is going to be revealed all right time time and a half time and when he shall he personal pronoun now the antichrist shall accomplish accompanist accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people that's when he breaks his covenant in the middle of the week all these things shall be fulfilled amen amen and i heard but i understood not then said i o lord what shall be the end of these saints and he said go your way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of thee yeah oh don't you forget that until the time of the end many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the lie shall understand hallelujah the end-time message shall reveal in the last church age amen amen hallelujah praise our god there you are hallelujah oh my shakes me to think of hallelujah the mysteries the things that the church world that's your eyes and says it's nonsense the mystery of who jesus christ was not a third person not the second person not the third person but the person [Music] all these other mysteries of god will be revealed because it's wrote here in this book and be revealed to the end time generation they can no more sit in seminaries in schools and denominations that the jews could see jesus being the messiah no wonder they kind of think you're crazy no wonder they're thinking you're foolish no wonder they can't understand why you don't talk up with them hallelujah because there's a power and a vision behind it a word of god that's been revealed to get the church in order for your rapture in the going home yes many shall run to and foreign knowledge shall increase certainly now what is another thing ever being on look at today at the churches here it is i hope it don't hurt but i gotta tell it making and that day there will be an antichrist right now remember when we get in the seals that antichrist rides right out over those seals daniel spoke of it you're the prince that would come he would be cut off now what is another thing ever been on looking today at the churches here it is i hope it don't hurt but i got to tell it making and and now we're going to see why now what is another thing that we've been on looking today at the churches here it is i hope it don't hurt but i got to tell it making and that day there will be an antichrist right now remember when we get in the seals that antichrist rides right out over those seals daniel spoke of it you're the prince that would come he would be cut off jesus would to make reconciliations for the people but that prince that would now what is another thing ever be known looking today at the churches here it is i hope it don't hurt but i gotta tell it making and that day there will be an antichrist right now remember when we get in the seals that antichrist rides right out over those seals daniel spoke of it you're the prince that would come he would be cut off jesus would to make reconciliations for the people but that prince that would stand up that would cause the abomination to make desolation that was ruled through titus and this time it's a prince coming out of rome that'll do it and he will be revealed in the last days understand making himself god as the holy ghost warns us in ii thessalonians the second let's just go to it ii thessalonians then you'll have not my word but god's word second thessalonians the second chapter and the twelfth verse let's see second thessalonians the second chapter and the twelfth verse let's see let's begin above that the seventh verse for the mystery of nicodemus already worked this is paul speaking of the holy ghost only only he whom now let us we'll let until he be taken out of the way who's he here does anybody know the holy ghost he that let us and when then when shall that wicked one be revealed when just at the time the holy ghost is being taken out which is fixing to leave right now what's he leaving for taking the church with him reveal paul speaking under the inspiration whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming the wicked one of course even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders we are the greatest church we have this we have this only we consolidate together see we are the greatest lying wonders and with all uh are one righteousness in them that perish because they receive not all the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god has sent them strong delusions that they should believe a lie should believe a lie and that they might be damned who believe not the truth but has pleasure in unrighteousness do you get it oh my now paul's speaking the time when the seal of god is being made known his spirit his name his grace all these other great mysteries is going forth now plans for his church to go in the rapture the outpouring of the holy ghost has done this that's what he's done in the last days now let's see have we got time for this last one amen the sixth anoint the most high oh my here's the one the last thing he used to do is to walk now let's just go back over and daniel find out what all he's to do right here seventeen weeks what should be accomplished in this time all right are determined upon my people and thy holy city to finish transgressions transgressions of the people to make an end of sin for the people and to make reconciliations for their iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness for the jews and to seal up the vision and prophecy to the time of the end and to anoint the most holy that's the sixth full reason obvious coming now to anoint the most holy now this may be a little bit strange for just a minute are many of you teachers but i just hold it just for a minute and see how it comes out this is the anointing not of a man jesus is already anointed that right man uh the balcony act said that god anointed jesus the holy ghost he went around doing good and healing the sick and so forth jesus is already he is messiah and messiah means the anointed one is that right but here at the end time he's to anoint the most holy what is the most holy so my way of seeing it which i believe i can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the tabernacle that will be used during the millennium now listen see why i get it described in ezekiel the the fourth chapter then i mean the 43rd chapter first and sixth verse let's go back to ezekiel and find out how these pictures in the millennium how they will anoint the ezekiel 43 and let's just read a little bit here now and see what he's going to do in this millennium anointing ezekiel 43 all right and now let's begin with the first to the sixth verse you read the whole thing you have to get home of course just putting down ezekiel 43. afterwards i watch description of the temple that is to be built in the millennium uh anyone any reader that knows that from ezekiel the 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter is nothing in the world but the millennium temple being erected on earth anyone knows that see when the glory of the lord fills it and so forth like that now we're going to just describe the temple in the 43rd chapter and the first to the sixth verse after he brought me to the gate even the gate that looked towards the east and behold the glory of god of israel came from the way of the east and the voice was like the voice of many waters and the earth a shine with the glory and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw even according to the visions that i saw when i came to destroy the city and the vision was like unto the vision that i saw by the river chidbar and i fell upon my faith and the glory of the lord the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is towards the east so the spirit tucked me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house and i heard him speak unto me out of the house and the man stood by me anointing anointing that temple for the millennial reign now note in leviticus how it was dedicated in leviticus now if we go back to leviticus we find out that moses anointed the temple let's just go back while we're at it we got that much time and let's go back to leviticus and find out when no uh moses anointed the temple leviticus the eighth chapter oh i just love to compare these scriptures to scriptures don't you love it amen and then you you just got a uh an idea of what the of what we're looking for and what we're doing now any of you realizes that we're just using the scripture now and then on it now the eighth chapter of leviticus now i've got mark down here the tenth first note leviticus eight and ten let's see and moses took the anointing oil and poured anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein and sanctified them sprinkle thereof upon the altar seven times nor the altar and all the vessels both the laver and is put to this to sanctify them and he poured anointing all upon aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him moses in the wilderness sanctifying our anointing the tabernacle of worship for the children of israel when they were in their journey it was anointed now in second chronicles turn over and we'll see the dedication that when the holy spirit took his seat at the tabernacle and watch what's taking place now in second chronicles the fifth chapter and let's begin at the 13th verse second chronicles the fifth chapter and begin at the 13th verse and it came to pass as it trumpets and the singers were to make one sound to be heard the praising and thanksgiving of the lord and when they lifted up their voices with the trumpet and the symbols and the instruments of music and praising the lord and singing for he is good and his mercies and doeth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord so that the priest stood the priest could not stand to minister by reasons of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god god came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not thy holy place but to anoint the most holy place and we notice that new jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the new jerusalem amen that descends from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adored for her husband the anointing will be upon them now when zerbella dedicated his temple after it was rebuilt it was not anointed again because it was already been anointed and been tore down it was just instructed again the destruction had to come to it it had been instructed again and put up so there was no anointing of it anymore when it was one time anointed that carried on through and it goes on until this very time but when god sets up the millennium tabernacle he will anoint the most holy not thy holy but the most holy but when the king takes his stone for 1 000 years glory she's over now anointing of the most holy will be the last thing take place when the tabernacle is erected the resurrection has come the jews has returned christ and his bride has come the jews 144 000 are sealed the millennium has taken place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holy holies of holiness and the most holy one of the most holy places the sanctuary where god lived between the turbans and this time christ will set in the most holy place with the anointing upon him and they'll need no sun therefore the lamb is the midst of the city shall be the light amen the sun will never go down in that city so uncle jim used to say and it never will because christ will be that life you know anyone and the king will come and take his throne for one thousand years to reign jeremiah 3 12 18 inclusive let's read it over in jeremiah the 18th chapter i believe you know the 12th chapter part of me the 12th chapter of jeremiah and let's begin with the uh the uh jeremiah 3 pardon me jeremiah 3 i have written down here where i was studying the holy spirit moving me just from place to place i just jotted these down the best they could jeremiah 3 and then 12 to 18 inclusive let's read it go and proclaim these words towards the north and say return thou backslidden israel sayeth the lord and i will not cause my my cause my anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger forever only in knowledge thine iniquity that thou has transgressed against the lord thy god and has scattered thy ways to the stranger honor every green tree that's what they've done from east west every nation see and ye have not obeyed the voice my voice saith the lord turn listen to this turn o backslidden children saith the lord for i am m-a-r-r-i-d i am married unto you our eyes were blinded because i give the gentiles a chance

up down there before joseph that group from out of every nation one out of a city and out of a family and i will bring you to zion and i will give you a pastor according to thy heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding and it shall come to pass when you be multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark are the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they they visit it neither shall it be done anymore at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord as he'll be there see and all the nations shall gather hallelujah unto it and the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk anymore after their own imaginations and the evil of their hearts amen that's when that city will be anointed that's when the new jerusalem will be anointed and all the nations of the city over in revelations the 22nd chapter it said the gates shall not be closed by night because there'll be no night there and all the kings of the earth shall bring their honor and glory into this city its walls will be jasper and starter stone twelve manner stones and twelve gates shall be one solid pearl only there shall be no lead of the candle in there there will be no more sunlight for the lamb that's in the midst of the city shall be the light and he shall lead his people into everlasting life there will be two trees standing one on either side of the river and they follow the healing of the nation that's that anointed one never come the holy city descending from god out of heaven coming to the earth let's take now what will take place during that time or do you love it let's turn to isaiah 65 just a minute just too good to skip by it's just too good leaf

heaven they shall not plant and another eat there for as the days of a tree shall the days of my people and my elect long shall they enjoy the works of their hands they shall not labor in vain to
