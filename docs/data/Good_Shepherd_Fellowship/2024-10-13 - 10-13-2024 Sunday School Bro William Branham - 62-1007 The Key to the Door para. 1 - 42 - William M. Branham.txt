========================================
[Music] knowing tonight was the communion night I always like if I'm around anywhere to come in on the communion because it's um I think that all Christians should anticipate and taking communion because Jesus said if you eat it not you have no part with me therefore it's a always a grand privilege to to come into the Tabernacle and then tonight brother Neville said he was just a teeny bit horse and and like if I speak to our congregation I told him I'd be delighted to do so I would like to announce also that if tomorrow night is the man's meeting the trustees tomorrow night and the B businessman here at the church on their regular Monday night meeting and they have a decision to make with the contractor I guess you all understand that our our um our papers went through and we are going to be able to build a church and so it goes through and it will probably start this week uh the church starts up this week as far as I know and U they turned us down on it here in Jeffersonville but we went to Indianapolis the state and they give us permission so we're go to build it and so um it starts perhaps this week it'll be known after the meeting tomorrow night and then after the meeting tomorrow night if they do not start this week if something happens a contractor can't start this week he's going to um then start the following week and this coming weekend Saturday night Sunday morning and Sunday night of next week this next coming Saturday and Sunday Lord willing I want to have a a a Triune meeting again like we did a few weeks AG go and um then uh after be that'll be Saturday night and then Sunday morning and then Sunday night this next that be the 13th and 14th of this month and then um some of the Brethren and I are going away uh after that time over to Colorado on a little hunting trip then come back if the Tabernacle when it's finished if it be the will of the Lord I want to take maybe a complete week before I leave again in the meetings and have the seven seals of Revelations just before like we had the seven Church ages now the Seven Seals to follow that and probably in about next two or 3 weeks because I think they claim they with the man that they're going to put on it they can we can build the Tabernacle and have it in about 10 days or 15 something like that then we're going to have seating room here for about twice the people we got or three times maybe more people that's why I was waiting till that time because the last Saturday and Sunday uh it was terrific you know the people stand out here at 2:00 in the afternoon uh to fill the Tabernacle up before the church ever opened up and next morning at 5:00 a nurse lives next door to me coming from up there said there's people just packed all around the Tabernacle at 5:00 in the morning so then the people when they get in there's no place and they get discouraged and they go away and and then those who are standing and piled in the jammed in the aisles they F all cramped up and everything and I see women standing there sweating in all like that and a piration run off of him and some man give up and give his some woman a chair and then he'll stand that his legs are hurt and somebody else give him you know like that it's pitiful and mothers of little sick children and so forth that's bad so we're trying to eliminate that now by building a bigger Tabernacle and we have a nice place for the children sometime and interrupt like little children crying while we're going to have a room for that so the mothers can go in still see the service and be broadcast right into the room and have Sunday School rooms and everything just lined out the way it should be and that if the Lord's willing takes place coming this coming week you all voted 100% on it so we've held right to that see the church is Sovereign what the church says that's what trustees or nobody else the trustees just each one a vote the pastor is just one vote it's the church that it's it's the um democracy of the church the sovereignty of the church the church and whole speaks that's all and we like that because we have no Bishops or hierarchies or overseers or so forth that tell us this that the other it's the holy spirit in the church does the speaking I like that rule and it's very fine and I asked did you all want to wait till we got enough to move the Tabernacle way and build a big church that was on the trustee board and it could not be settled by the trustees and then they asked me as a gentle overseer to come and ask the church so I said now we have enough money uh to uh increase the size of the church and fix it all different and everything and what we had I said now we can do that right away or save her money till we get enough to put the complete Church up new someplace else and we talk a vote on it in the church and it was unanimously voted for to put the church up right now and it's uh just build a bigger church right now and we've stayed right with that and the board here in Jeffersonville turned us down and said we couldn't do it and we went over that and went to Indianapolis and got the state onto it and then they sent back the word that go ahead we had the the RightWay to build it so then the city has nothing to do with it now it's the state has to do it so then we have the permission and the contractor has a the permit in his hand right now and I guess they're ready to start at any time this tomorrow night if the if the contractor says that he wants to start next week then I'll just omit the meetings for the until we come into the seven uh seals and then if uh the contractor can't start next week then the following Sunday Saturday and Sunday I'll have the meeting before leaving and then I was going to have it this Sunday and I found out tonight being communion night so I omitted it this Sunday because such a crowd you can't take communion comfortably and then when we have the bigger church we can now uh we got a oncoming president the um oh you know what I mean it was just delivered to the Hickerson family not long ago and if uh our sister who's a Pianist if she'll come and give us a little card on the piano bring them in if you will or some little song of that type this fine little gentleman and the Hickerson family that's been look for for so long has arrived a very fine little fell and he sure is a jewel to the Hickerson and they're all jewels to us we love them and they're really our brother and sister we're thankful to have this little one born into their family which is absolutely revolutionized the family amen and if they father and mother will bring this little fell now for dedication now the scripture says they brought unto him children infants that he might lay his hand on them and bless them now there's people in the world that believe in what they call infant baptism and that is they take these little fellas and not baptize them at all CU they just sprinkle water on them now we don't find that anywhere in the Bible where they ever did sprinkle anybody adults let alone children and so baptism is a confession that an inward work of Grace has been done and the little infants has no knowledge of sin therefore when Jesus died at the cross he died to take away the sin of the world and when the baby is becomes a human being and bned into this world they have no sin of their own therefore they have no repentance to be done but when that the blood of Jesus Christ takes away that sin of course the baby is born in sin shaped in iniquity comes to the world speaking lies and they're Sinners by nature but the blood of Jesus Christ atones for that but when the baby is comes to the age of accountability and knows what's right and wrong then it has to repent repent for what it has done its sin now is a sin just like it's born in sin it's a human sin the sin now is a sin that Adam and Eve did and that was omitted by God by the blood of Jesus Christ now the baby has no sins to repent from until he sins then he's got to repent see and when he repents then's a time to be baptized and then he's baptized by immersing until that time we follow the instructions of the Bible which they brought to Jesus little children that he might lay his hands on them and bless them this lovely parent tonight brings this little baby to the pastor and I for dedication and they feel that placing it in the representatives of Christ hands they're placing it in Christ hands then by faith we take the baby to God to give thanks for bringing it here and ask God to bless it which we call infant dedication uh you know how to be about my own children I've got a little girl in glory tonight and she was dedicated to the Lord here at the altar I've got a little boy and girl sitting back there tonight has never been baptized yet 11 I've been talking to her about it today Sarah for baptism and Joseph is only seven so he's too young for it yet as far until if he desire and say God was put on his heart I'd do it then but as infants I just dedicate him to the Lord cuz that's the scriptural teaching of it nille if you walk out with me now to this St well that's I thought he was sleeping the going on I seen the other day I said the president and so forth for too small for take how do you do I know that's found to be a treasure to any would you think so very sweet and now brother and sisteron as a servant of Christ and your pastor I take this baby by faith to the Arms of Jesus Christ in whom you wish to place it into his arms let us bow our heads the past I our hands our heavenly father in the Bible they brought to you little children that you might lay your hands upon them and bless them and truly Lord they were blessed and now to follow your example the things that you did we tried closely Lord reading the Bible and following the example just as you did it and this father and mother brother and sister Hickerson our beloved uh disciples here in the Tabernacle bring to us this little bit of joy that you have placed in their care it come from you Lord you gave them this child and now they desire to give its little life to you to be a service to you I pray that you bless this child that you will give it a long life may it live if possible to see the coming of the Lord I pray that you'll bless it wherever it's at May It Be raised in a Christian home as it has been born into one and may it continue in this home May the father and mother live to see the baby uh in the pit if possible preaching the gospel amen they would rather see it that way father than on the The Throne of the White House or anywhere else because they are Servants of yours and desire the baby's life to be a dedication and a benediction to the work of God now I pray father that you Bless the Child and May the grace of God come upon and may it be healthy and happy all this life and may the father and mother live to see it grown as we ask again blessed who we bless in your name and now little Steven Holland Hickerson I give the to Jesus Christ that the blessings that we have asked may come upon these be healthy and strong my little brother and may you live to glorify God In The Name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen where we'll never grow never grow in the land where we never grow never grow never grow in the land where we never grow let it be wonderful the young will be adults and the old will be young isn't that wonderful and we'll never be sick or never have sorrow or never die now the services brother Neville has announced I want to announce now also that that meeting don't forget it in the meetings that he spoke of all saw a Mrs Ford that used to come to the church years ago um I just taken her to her daughter a couple days ago and she's 80 years old and went to meet the Lord last night at 8:00 I think in her Services the pastor and I will hold at the chapel at cutas Wednesday at 10 1030 10:30 this coming Wednesday Mrs Ford Miss uh I think I forget what is Levi Mrs Levi Ford our that's that's the Lloyd Ford's mother that you see in my book that is going to save that boy scout suit for me and only got one leging left now that's that's the boy's mother so I taken her up the other day and prayed with her the poor old thing and she went to meet the Lord Jesus now if the Lord willing I had something here that I might announce that the services if they come up for this next week if I placed them in here at least I thought it didn't about um what I was going to speak on for the the the coming this coming service of the following week if I I think I thought I put it in this book I don't know whether I did or not yes sure it is the Lord willing Saturday night I want to preach on the subject of the why one man influences another's life and Sunday morning I want to preach on the the capping of the pyramid and Sunday night I want to preach on my guide the subject my guide for this coming Sunday night now may the Lord bless those things and help me as I've been out and just a little context to pick them up now tonight we want to hurry and have a few things by the way I have a letter here that U that just come in the mail as Billy picked it up a while ago that some brethren are in Michigan and this comes from the Ministerial Association that's got a lot of things that's what gets things scrupled up you see that they're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that um that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and what was some of the awest things you ever heard and the Ministerial Association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter about it and um I sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying that one man should leave this wife and go marry that one uh this church knows that we don't stand for No Such Tommy Rod as that we believe in the Bible we believe that when man takes a woman that's his wife and death only can separate him that's only we don't believe such stuff as that we don't believe in free love either we don't believe in that stuff we absolutely believe the Bible and that alone amen so I'll just photostatic copy of this letter and give my answer to it and place it in the magazines and that'll that'll take care of that I hope it does anyhow answer to them now tonight just before we open the scripture let's speak to our Lord our heavenly father we are approaching thy Throne of Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus that great one who came down from glory to unfold to us the riches of the treasures of God how we thank thee for this great Jesus who was the manifestation of God made personally to us and through him we have Redemption from our sins and we have now passed from Death un life because we believe him for it is written of him that he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him it sent he has everlasting life and shall not come to the Judgment but pass from Death unto life bless th words tonight Lord and we're here to take the communion just in a short time Christian Fellow citizens of the Kingdom will gather around the altars and there they will take what we call the communion the the little potion of of sacri that thou has left us to show that we believe that you died for our sins and rose again on the third day and a lie forever more and doing this until you return according to the scriptures as we are commanded sanctify our hearts from Evil thoughts and all that we have did that was contrary to thy great will father forgive us and give us of thy Grace tonight break unto us now the the bread of life in the word as we read it and speak on it in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen now in the Book of Revelations uh beginning with one verse only I wish to read the 20th verse or the first verse of the 20th chapter and I saw an angel come down from heaven having a key of the the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand now I wish to speak if it would be if I should call it the text from this or draw a context from this text for the next 20 or 25 minutes I would like to call it the key to the door now I do not wish to to make it the keys because Peter was given the keys to the kingdom but I want to call this the key to the door and then immediately after this I wish to give a few little comments on communion before we take it tonight now a key I notice here as we read that this angel came down from from Heaven having the key in his hand I believe it's Revelations 13 or 19 we find again another angel coming with a key and a key is a purpose of a key is to unlock something something that's been locked up or it's something that should be locked up but a key is given for that purpose now there are many kinds of keys because we have many uses of keys there's keys to the storehouses there's key to your own house there's key to your automobile and uh we call them keys and they are keys and they can be duplicated many times s or to the house are sometimes can be made what we call the skeleton key and other words it's a key that's kind of uh made with the levers uh acts on it that that twists the lock in a certain way can almost unlock any door called The Skeleton Key it's a skeleton frame of many keys and it can be unlocked that way with our houses or even to our automobiles can be duplicated and then there is any key cannot unlock no door until it's used by a hand it's got to have something to use the key the key in itself cannot use itself it's got to have something to yield the key it's like this microphone that I I'm speaking through that microphone is a mute unless there's something to speak through it it cannot speak through itself it's got to have something to speak through it so it is not the microphone it's the voice or the the noise behind that the microphone transmits to the Air wave to your ear now that's the way it is in preaching the gospel it's not the uh we ourselves as ministers we are not the gospel but we are only transmitters that transmits the voice of God through our agency of man to the hearer amen a vision is the same way uh I know nothing to say to the church at this time concerning a vision but if the Holy Spirit would show first me a vision then I transmit that Vision to the one that is directed to so it was not my me the vision was not me I it was God gave the vision and I acted as a transmitter to bring forth the message of the vision to the people now a key is the same thing pardon me the key is only to be held in a hand that unlocks the door see it's got to be hand now and in the key I'm going to speak about tonight is only one hand can hold this key and that's the hand of Faith it's the only thing can can hold this key and hands hold other keys and it takes a hand of faith for that now we take like the key to knowledge now a man has to if he's trying to accumulate knowledge see now there's a key to that there's a way that this man has to open up he has to be to get his books and his learning and he cannot no one can learn him they might teach him but he has to learn and the only way that it can be done he has to catch that key that's something in there that unfolds or un reveals to him the knowledge that he is seeking and there are people like would try to play a piano and they are music they don't know just how to do it but they could go there and the teacher might take lesson after lesson and they never learn it they just cannot hold that key to that mystery how the Rhythm and the sounds of the tuning and so forth rings out it takes the key [Music]
