one that did wrong but remember brother She's Somebody's Daughter that's right how do you know what cause that life maybe some sweetheart introduced her to social life put her in his arm and promise her everything and then and then when he turned her character he run away and left her to sold another one and that introduced her to that kind of for life you know no he didn't say you know he said who knows the story behind her that was the thought that caught my mind who knows the story behind her to every situation there is a story amen to every situation there is a story that's why we should never run into conclusion because we don't know the details praise the Lord he said we'll know the story behind her but now she's mad she has a mark on her no one had anything to do with her she's

of weeks ago I said that I believe that we are at the junction as a church and and I still believe that I believe that uh just like I said before Brad Brahm said at every Junction there are two things that we have to watch for we have to watch and realize that the enemy will come as a flaw that is obvious for Destruction for confusion but the Lord is all will also be there to raise uh a standard and if we can see the standard the standard will be the identification of the word standard will not be signs and miracles the standard we have to be the word the word will always identify itself as the standard and if we can see that then the prophet also said Junction of time he says then we then we will experience the miraculous because the only potential is identified the miraculous will follow and so let's let's just thank the Lord and as we want to bring our hearts before the Lord tonight whatever you want to say or you want to remain standing you want to kneel whatever position we

dear Lord we just trust ourselves in your hands now for the rest of the time that is before us bless your word to our hearts Fellowship around your precious world tonight Jesus name we pray amen amen amen the Lord bless you for this take our Bibles praise the Lord thank you musicians praise the Lord Saint John chapter 8. see John chapter 8. you know sometimes you you uh thinking about a subject on your mind and you're praying and you have your own thoughts you know when you when you think about um unclean Spirit you think about demonology then you think about you know talking about uh uh uh you know evil spirit and all of that but to just see how the Lord kind of for changed what I had on my mind as I was studying on the weekend and then uh it starts to open to different things let's just read uh John chapter 8. uh I read it from verse one Jesus went on to the Mount of olive and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the stripes and Pharisees brought onto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the mess they said unto him Master this woman is taking in adultery in the very art now Moses in the Lord commanded us that such should be stoned but what served down this they say attempting him tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus took down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard him net so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him First cast his stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground praise the Lord and they wish heard it became convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the others even on to the least and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the mess in Jesus when Jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those down accusers have no man condemned thee she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and say no more may the Lord bless his word you may have your seeds so going away from the service [Music] uh Sunday and now kind of for meditating you know sometimes you you get out of the service and then you start to really meditate because and and try to think or you know uh see how the law kind of led the service I was thinking about it and it it kind it struck my mind and and uh um talking about mayor Magdalene in the first resurrection to now I want to talk about this woman I hear the woman caught in adultery in the pardon I want to talk about the pattern and what uh what caught my mind in looking at this is the other March you recall the three women in in the genealogy of Jesus Christ which were Gentile we mean in tema Ruth and Rahab which of course is is uh is is strange they are their name will appear in a genealogy of Jesus Christ but then also we realized that there were there were a few women also that were that ministered unto Jesus like the scripture said but they were there were women also in uh in the in the scripture this woman caught in adultery the one that was Jesus feet with her head and then also uh the woman that they were and uh they were very notable women you know there in the scripture so looking at this stuff am I for some reason my eyes starts to look at these three women so maybe if the law will bless us we might we might kind of talk talk about uh talk about them maybe the woman that will on Sunday if we we are led to go in that direction if the Lord don't have us do something yes but I was just thinking about this and uh and in the way that brother Brennan will read some things tonight uh he he he used their story you know reindeer life story together uh uh and it kind of forgive us a picture but you know just like I said I was I was listening to that tape and uh uh doing some work mowing the lawn and all of that and then I got I got caught by by the scene because Birdman yeah was dramatizing you know a scene there and he says who knows the story behind her and then I started to think think about uh some few things that he also said you know uh uh talking about uh rehab the Halep you know uh he you know you know talking about Rahab he says uh she was forced to go in their way of life you know uh not because she she wanted to be a harlot I wanted to be a you know a woman of that kind of a life but uh uh life situation kind of a false or into that now so like I said there is story behind every action amen and and if you don't know the story your judgment will be very poor praise the Lord your judgment will be very very poor so we want to look at this woman tonight in uh in a different way and uh uh and you know I trust that the Lord will be able to to uh to help us with the few meanings that is before us to be able to look at uh some few things now so uh uh he's he's stalking yet I will kind of go over some uh a few of the the different you know different quotes that I was looking at now when we looked actually in the scripture here we will see that uh see John actually is in John chapter 8 is uh we know that it's a very very very interesting uh chapter in the in in the Bible did in Saint John chapter 8 it is it is all it is also it is almost like Matthew chapter 12 uh in the Book of Matthew it is also very very important scripture I was going to talk a little bit of that on Sunday but I got I got uh uh uh you know I got moved into water what we was talking about because Matthew chapter 12 is is Johnson you have to remember this in Matthew chapter 12 that the Pharisees called uh uh Jesus ebessi board praise the Lord and it's actually there in Matthew chapter 12 Jesus was was dealing with you know telling them if I know clean Spirit go out of a man it comes back you know seven times now what made that scripture uh uh very important like every other scripture but that chapter you know it shows the kind of a junction because the scripture will tell us from that time Jesus actually never taught publicly from that time he never taught publicly and it it teaches us a whole lot that's where he also said you can say anything about the son of man but when the whole you speak one word against the Holy Ghost it would not be forgiving you it was in that very same chapter because what was happening is that they were attributing the manifestation of the Holy Ghost to a work of the devil praise the Lord amen that this man Caster evil spirit by vegetable that's what he said and and and and Jesus said if it sit on cancer seven you know uh Kingdom against himself will not stand and he was also trying to tell them that you know the you know the the devil cannot you know cannot cast out evil spirit he can bring evil spirit upon people but he can't cast it out he don't have the power to cast that evil spirit and uh you know but it is it is very important because uh uh in the in a in a little measure we will see you know uh just this gun time being in Chicago there and uh with brother Robert Wilson and you know uh he's letting us know he's been there for many years many years and um and uh to see the kind of for history that Chicago holds not only to the U.S but even to Christianity there were great men that came to Chicago to your mother one of them and great Revival you know that uh that uh that that broke out to Chicago but you you know as as we were talking you know we're talking about different things and uh uh and I and I told the brothers I said well you know we have to also remember this was the very same Chicago where Kyle Williams and uh Kenny Hagin and all of those men decided to challenge brother Brennan improve that uh you know his Doctrine was false and and and all of that and brought around and told Carl Williams you know and says uh says you guys this is what you are planning to do and even the room that you're renting your we will not use that room we're going to use this room is going to be painted this way and this man gonna sit here and this guy going to sit here and this other person going to sit here and uh uh you know and and all of that even that never been to uh kind of heading to preach for him and uh you know and and all of that but you will you will realize that uh uh uh it was not too long when Berta Brandon told Chicago that she she they have missed their day of visitation you know and Joseph bozell was telling brother Brennan if you listen to some of the Last Ship there he's selling bird brand that's a great thing Brett Brown that you know Chicago is going to have that great thing Birmingham told Joseph Chicago has already have her visitation the great things have already passed you know so all of that and it is not like you know uh because the beauty the beauty of the message of the owl is the Fulfillment of scripture that's the beauty of the message of the owl the beauty of the message of the hour is not the man that are playing the same is not the prophet is not the fight for Ministry the beauty is the Fulfillment of scripture for us to have the privilege to be able to see scripture being fulfilled in our day we can we can we can point to it we can say Malachi 4 unless a person can come and tell us who fulfill Malacca 4 and 5 but that's as much as we believe that was a scripture that was fulfilled in vertebrand Ministry praise the Lord that is the beauty of the message so you can you can see things we can read about uh Matthew chapter 12 you know and those men calling the work of God uh a devil and and right in there we see the DraStic change in Jesus ministry praise the Lord Matthew Chapter 13 he will go and start talking in Parables and his disciples says Master why are you talking in Paris is because it's unto you the secret is to be known the the ministry out there is done praise the Lord and we see the same thing you know uh uh repeating Luke chapter 4 Jesus came down from the mountain went straight into the synagogues as the you know the the priests giving the the straws you read from there this day this scripture is fulfilled unconsciously fall into the same scene the Holy Ghost set everything out he couldn't find the the page that he wanted to read a Catholic priest gave him a Bible he read out of it preached the message he wanted to preach going out of the service the Holy Ghost remind him do you remember there's a scene like this in the Bible what is that scripture being fulfilled before us the Fulfillment of scripture is the beauty of the message of the owl now so uh uh out of that but also yet in in Saint John chapter 8 the beauty year also is there the here is a woman caught in adultery and uh uh and uh the woman was brought to the Lord Jesus like we read European the brother Brandon he said she was a drag you know she was dragged one he says here the the meanest man in town and she looked back in a corner and there he sat now he's talking about the the woman that that washed Jesus feet with her tears but listen to the story here now he said and she said oh to think that he's invited and he's now grown neither is his feet watch I remember that they tell me that a woman was dragged into the street or drag into the street for for for prostitution to be Stone like I will be now so he's making a saying that the woman uh that was Jesus feet here and now she's uh uh seeing Jesus and and she's remembering that she was tall of the same in Saint John chapter 8 and uh uh and she also placing herself in the same uh situation drag into the street to be stoned like I will be and he forgive her every scene if I could own it do something for him maybe he did forgive me my sin but what can I do I can't even get in the game if I could only get to him I didn't like to ask him to forgive me so she thought he is not anointed neither is he watch all he uh he's not made welcome and if I could only get his attention I did make him welcome if he did only talk to me I will make him welcome praise the Lord amen so we see here that uh uh so uh John is is bringing this scene out but you will realize that when John talks about this woman and then he talks about Jesus saying neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more and uh uh he says and Jesus said again I am the light of the word he that followeth me walk and not in darkness right away you realize that the the Jesus and the Pharisees conversation switch from the woman praise the Lord now the brother woman before Jesus to tempt him to find a way to trap him praise the Lord but then pray this song their conversations switched away from the woman and noun is going to be more in a place where Jesus is talking about the light of the word and he is going to go into talking about Abraham as our father is going to go on and on and on that are going to start to talk now about uh uh uh uh their beginning praise the Lord and uh it's it's beautiful it's beautiful that uh uh these very people that were condemning this woman of idolatry because of a physical act that she was caught in Jesus is going to trace their genology to the adultery that was that took place in Eden right praise the Lord amen because pretty soon they will they will say uh Abraham is our father and we are now born of fornication right praise the Lord amen and the conversation will go until it will go all the way back toward the beginning praise the Lord now these like I said these people that were that was uh uh uh uh about to Stone this woman because of a physical art that she was caught in they didn't know that the spirit of rebellion or the spirit that was making them to reject the word was the spirit of idolatry from the beginning praise the Lord they were they were looking at a physical art condemning her for the physical art when India's spirit they are guilty of the same Act praise the Lord amen so you can go on and on just read uh Saint John chapter 8 you you will enjoy the reading them you know Jesus go ahead and and and you know talk very very I say unto you uh you know whosoever committed sin is a seven to eight and the conversation went on they started to talk they started to talk and uh and then Jesus identified himself before Abraham was I am but is is uh is is beautiful because in these in these three women what I wanted to to bring out is the pattern predestination and the first resurrection which is the rapture so we saw Mary Magdalene in the first resurrection she was the one that first saw Jesus that's what I I call the first resurrection praise the Lord but so we we are looking at a woman here that was caught in a physical art amen she was calling the physical eye brother Brown said yet in Jesus came and called he says when she did taught on those things she heard a man saying bring me a drink now this is the woman at the well we're not dealing with her tonight but I just want to bring a scene out of it because like brother Branham says who know the story Beyond her okay he says what's about it in the in in her Darkest Hour windhall Maura was gone maybe a pretty little lady being turned on the street to leave it sometimes it's it's not the little girl's fault is her parents fault to let to to let her get out like that and there she was Maybe her little curve all hanging down she was depleted going alone wearing nobody had anything to do with her a child Maybe a big story behind it praise the Lord just like a woman at Jesus feet there she has a story uh Beyond her life I also believe that this woman has a story behind her life like we all have story behind our lives praise the Lord but just like we we we we saw with uh with uh Mayor Michael Lane and uh and we will see the uh with the woman at the wear that brother Branham says uh you know she have a predestinated seat and the beauty of that uh you will see when we get there is very beautiful when you look at it in a scripture and that's and that is how I want to look at this tonight because I will tell you tonight it is only the predestinated seed can receive the pattern because you have to realize that not a pattern until is received as a pattern you have to receive it Jesus died for the sin of the word but his death will mean nothing to a person that do not receive it praise the Lord amen his death will mean nothing to a person that will not receive it that will not accept him as their lord and savior that will now confess and say Lord I believe uh uh you being the innocent won't die for all my guilt and all my shame praise the Lord so you see that and and that I delegate to accept God's offering is given to us by God it's not our own ability praise the Lord the ability for us to be able to accept what he have done for us on our marriage or on our knowledge or on our efforts but to realize that everything we have he gave it to us and if he don't help us we will not accept it neither will we use it rightly so all comes back to him praise the Lord so you see yeah there's there's uh that's the wonderful thing of of the pardon amen that's the beauty of the pardon let me read uh something yet again but when I mean the message leaving he loved me living dying buried raising coming he was talking about the expression he was talking about God expressing his love and how the love of God is expressed he says a real Godly love goes after that backslaughter till he finds him Godly love goes and stoop to the lowest of Hell to pick up the man or the woman that's falling that's what we are lacking today praise the Lord amen he says that's what we are lacking today we have a a fine cultural Church educated fine dress fan building and that's quite beautiful music some of the the best the word ever had but we are dying for some of that Godly love Jesus expressed a well when he found the prostitute dragged before him dragged before him guilty of an adultery and he dragged her before him and said now the law required for her to die what do you say about it praise the Lord amen what do you expect from the Throne of Mercy amen when brother Brown says no mortar can take another mortal before God and ever accused him praise the Lord the prayer of God said no matter what someone do to you you can never earnestly get down on your knees and take another person before God and ever accuse that person he said because pray this song when you really enter the channel of praying and get Before the Throne of Mercy you will now begin to feel sorry for that person and you will say God have mercy on my brother he really never meant to do it why can't you expect from the Throne of Mercy praise the Lord amen and yeah the broadest woman caught in adultery I mean I mean we can go through all the stories and say where is the man and all of that let the man stay wherever he is let he be there amen because Jesus never make him the the the you know the action of the story the woman was the one in concern amen praise the Lord you know and as I was as I was uh I was uh uh you know I was thinking about this and studying on the weekend you know as you look at all of this story then you even go back and as we were listening to marriage and divorce as we are going through the series you will realize and it to the to the human mind is it appeared like a story of Injustice it looks like the Lord of God was was was against the woman praise the Lord why was the man giving a second Covenant of of uh to go in with a polygamy and a woman calling now you see but if you bring it back and you realize praise the Lord amen you bring it back and you realize then you will understand why a prophet of God said there are three sacred that you was given to the woman it was a treasure it is because of of of all of those things that God empowered the woman with that that's the reason why the the the the the promise of redemption was given to the woman he said because of that now so if if a person do not understand that you will look at the rest of the Bible and says it was it's very unjust against the woman praise the Lord and that's why God has to send us a prophet because God's word is not unjust praise the Lord if you don't understand the law of contracts you will always take the worst part to be bad but it have to be there for you to appreciate the good part if you don't understand a lot of reproduction you always say what is this happening to me it will not have happened unless the seed that you saw because every seed we bring forth is kind you will reap what you saw so if you just look at one side of the queen you will think that it's unjust but no matter how you slice it it will always produce two size praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why you know uh it sounds in in people who think that oh yeah you know the the prophet of God you know it is it's always you know you you it's easy to take it in that kind of understanding just like Elijah he was against Jezebel this message is how on women know I don't believe that is how I'm with me I believe that this word is your protection this word is sent to protect you from the abuse of the age praise the Lord thank you if you don't understand it and you hear people in in secular church I mean that's all order for what is uh you know me too movement women Liberation and all of this going because it goes right back to the Bible the struggle there is that it looks like a woman has been left as a second class God gave her the greatest gift to be a life Giver just like him the greatest gift God gave it to the weakest vessel he put Heavenly treasure in a weak vessel all because of redemption praise the Lord now so all of these things and uh here is this woman here uh you know and and she's caught in this situation the Broadband says she's dragged in the street you know uh well thank God I mean thank God their child they even had the mind to bring her before Jesus just to tempt him or as they will have soon her behind the house and she will be dead by the drag car in the street and yeah they brought her before our lord Jesus praise the Lord amen and uh and and and uh and bringing all their accusation against her this woman you know uh the Lord of Moses says their sauce should be sown once sealed down amen and the Bible says and Jesus didn't pay no attention to them praise the Lord he stood down and he started writing in his sin amen praise the Lord he started writing on the ground as though he heard him that and when they continue to ask him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin praise the Lord amen he that is without sin among you let he cast the first stone praise the Lord and uh you see the thing there is the other I mean uh uh just reading this uh a lot of things can come is coming to my mind that we can look into here because you will realize that uh just like I said Jesus was looking all the way back to uh the beginning of time you must be looking at the birth of sin in Genesis 3. praise the Lord he was saying is there anyone among us whose birth cannot be traced back to Genesis 3. and he was the only one whose birth could not be traced back the woman the man everybody there birth could be traced back to Genesis 3. right praise the Lord and you see the the Bible says and then when he said that he dropped his head down and walked took place a spirit of conviction a spirit of conviction praise the Lord took a hold of those men and and everybody dropped their song from their from the the the heirus person to the least and the Bible says they went away and he was left with a woman alone because you see there's one of the things they are saying leaves in a human spirit is more than you know all the physical art praise the Lord saying actually destroy the human spirit we know that uh you know you you talk about uh Genesis chapter 3 we take the the you know the the act of The Serpent and Eve and and sometimes it blowed our mind as a great mystery it's supposed to be something that is that should be very simple you know for people to understand you know uh most great teachers in the Bible you know Scholars they will talk about Genesis chapter 6 and they will now want to believe that those uh that the sons of God they will say is that they were Angels they would say that there were there were you know uh nephilis now I was I would think in my mind why why would it be difficult for them to believe that the the second was a man and it's easy for them to believe that these Angels were made the reason why it's difficult is because there's a mystery in Genesis chapter 3. praise the Lord that's where the same question is hate because if you take it naturally God Adam came fresh from the hands of God and Eve is about product that came out of Adam the same product that God made fresh from his hands they are bones their blood everything that ran through them was righteousness how they were seen now contaminated the human blood how did it coming how did that contamination took place how it was the mystery of blood your science class will tell you that praise the Lord but you see what happened there is there there was just a physical act but what took place in the spiritual art is that see unbelief was dropped in the human spirit unbelief was dropped in the human Spirit that's the reason why no matter how uh experience we have with God we say how this this fight in the human spirit I mean you always say well I'm trying to find a word of God here the person know that they are safe the question of being saved is not their question but there is a struggle in the human spirit it is because of Doubt sin unbelief that was dropped in the human spirit praise the Lord amen the physical eye was just the mixture of blood now so we see here that Jesus speaking this word convict these men and every one of them dropped their Stones everybody the Bible says they were convicted in their hearts that's why the word of God would do the words will always go back to address that question the word when the word is preached unto you and you receive the word in the womb of your mind brother Baron says that's the first place you receive the word Thy word starts to go around in your conscience it starts to go around and what is this doing the breaking is is moving in your spirit and it's trying to find you know if there is if there is any Resident of guilt in you because the the purpose of the word is to deal with guilt amen when Jesus said there is no condemnation unto them that are in Christ it is when the word has there with guilt in you praise the Lord the pardon is a pattern in a sense that we are pardoned and we will never remember that we did this again or or we would not do it again the the you know uh the the possibility of doing it again is there but the pardon is where the word comes to be with guilt so you see right here when Jesus said woman mourn you they have not seen he just rolled back the storm and everybody starts to feel a sense of guilt in there praise the Lord amen but what did he did to the woman when they were all gone away says woman where are thy accusers praise the Lord did any man accuse thee If any man said anything to thee after they have all have their sense of guilt praise the Lord that's what happens when when you are guilted it's I mean it's very hard for you too you have to really be possessed to shout that guilty away like Jesus says and not taking the beam from your eyes and try to condemn another person he says she said no man Lord and Jesus said neither do I condemn be go and see no more praise the Lord now only neither do I condemn thee but he went back and there with that girl now you see it was not telling the woman that I I forgive you but he was telling the woman go and see no more in a sense like I have dealt with that I have dealt with that root cause there was not a commitment it was a word that would take effect it was almost like when Jesus says your faith has healed thee amen it was it was not like that the father talking to the little child this thing that you do don't do it again because he don't have the ability to take the power of sin out of that child but this one that is talking he has the ability to reach right down there and take every unclean desire from that woman praise the Lord so when he spoke to one they were convicted when he spoke to this other one she was she had another form of conviction is that she was released from her guilt her form of conviction released her from her guilt these other guys form of conviction they went from the service feeling more guilty praise the Lord they went from the service feeling more guilty like brother Graham says you can never come in the presence of God and go back to sin it'll go worse than you can or you go more free than when you came praise the Lord so one group went back feeling more guilty and this woman experience the pattern neither do I condemn thee there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ it's the same it's the same statement neither do I condemned it go and say no more now if you will not condemn her there I don't think he will condemn her before the throne praise the Lord you see because the thing is is almost like birbam says God is he he's not playing games with us this this Plan of Redemption is God's business and he's serious about it praise the lord we better make out our mind because God is serious about it that's his Plan of Redemption his purpose was so to to make his attributes to manifest his attributes that was his purpose it was not to kind of a play games for people live and and one time you are saving another time you are not saved and then you can do whatever you want to do and then you make up your mind a lot now I want to serve you and God is not into those games praise the Lord he said neither do I condemn thee go sin no more praise the Lord amen now the place comes where they were still on the the Old Testament Covenant the sacrifice has not been offered praise the Lord amen the sacrifice has not been offered the Holy Ghost has not come yet glory be to God better than this how could the atonement take effect when the sacrifice have now been offered how could they Atomic take effect because the Holy Ghost was not given yet but yet he's telling the woman go and seeing no more praise the Lord now Alberta Brandon will he will he will describe it uh story he tells of a man that was condemned he was condemned and he was to be killed and the King asked him and says I've given you one wish that you can ask for before you be killed he says my wish is I want to drink water is that all you want he said yeah I want to drink water let me drink mine praise the Lord this is that all you want he said yeah that's all I want so brother Graham says well this the king said then you're giving water to drink if that's all he wants I'll tell you will ask for your children to be taken care of your children should be sponsored you know if you give your wife a lamb say no I wanna I just want a glass of water so brother Graham said they bring him a glass of water and he pulled the water on the ground remember he said he want to drink water praise the Lord so the thing here is that they can gather the water off the ground then they can kill him do you grab the story yeah brother Branham says this he says that's word that's word the atonement can take effect before the sacrifice is killed because Isaiah said he was wounded for my transgression he was ruled for our iniquity and by his tribes we were healed but Jesus had not Got Stripes yet yet he was healing people sure how was that how how did it happen praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight isn't God good he's the only one that can bypass his own word amen he's not above his word but yet he can disguise himself and go around his word and still come out to be truth he loved the Lord tonight musicians you can come we will continue on Sunday the Lord give us another opportunity how he's telling this woman go and see no more where will the power come from how is he Healing The Sick and raising the Dead when he have not gone to Calvary yet you know he have not gone to Calvary he have not been bruised he has not been killed but yet the effect of the atonement is taking place on the life of people just like how jairo's daughter was raised back to life when Jesus called her back to life it was not a fake thing she came back to life so when Jesus said this woman go and see no more it was an effect that she was going away with the same nature gone that's the reason why the prophet of God says everyone must have the opportunity to hear the world one time he said just one time it's enough it's enough we don't need uh uh uh uh on and on service all we're doing is yes we are just creating an atmosphere we are just creating an atmosphere bringing our lack of fire together creating an atmosphere thanking God praising God that's all we are doing but one time when that word is preached that I see make a contact with your soul is enough there is no devil in hell no matter what you go through there is no devil in hell that can be able to outroot what God has already planted in your soul [Music] just one contact [Music] all we're doing we are just coming and watering that sea we are just coming and watering our scene that's the reason why I don't have to impress you because I'm not the one that grew in the sea he's the one that planted it he's the one that blesses it and it grows through eternal life all of these things were we think that we're having something in our hand we guess a special Ministry that we will do something in and the church will all of those things is we must we must throw those things away we must always learn to appreciate his presence we will always learn to appreciate he says I will never leave you I will never forsake you Christian Life become tougher for you when the devil can blind you from seeing those promises [Music] let's stand on our feet she Jesus you are the Lamb of God [Music] of me [Applause] [Music] you are my friends [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] my God [Music] please foreign just like we said tonight there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ the purpose of the word the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to deal with sins to deal with guilt if there is anything that is making you to feel guilty you have to go to Calvary you have to believe in the finished work because as long as the devil can keep you in that condition he will rob you of every Victory you don't work it out in your mind don't make yourself to believe that you are you are forgiving no it is not you that make yourself forgiving you got to take God's word you got to put it back to the word you got these law this is why your word says I believe your word you want you want that thing to drop down in your heart don't get work up in your mind because the devil knows when you are woke up in your mind and you also know when you have a conviction he knows when that thing dropped in your heart when it drops in your heart foreign to talk about it because it's placed under the seed of God's forgive forgetfulness is placed into God's seed or forgetfulness [Music] that's what the problem is the pardon is to address guilt in our life foreign [Music] there's a fountain of blood drained from Emmanuel vein where the sin of plunge beneath that floor and lose all his guilty sin we plunge beneath the floor Now by Pentecostal idea Lord I cover myself with the blood Lord I wash my family in the blood no you plunge beneath the floor by accepting God's provision accepting God's promise we plunged beneath the floor to lose or guilt guilty if the world asks you to go and make it right you are willing to go and make it right if the word says tell your sister sorry tell your brother sorry you would do it because that is the thing that plunged you beneath the floor and the word said tell your husband sorry you're going to do it because that is the action that takes you beyond the blood foreign people we are what a blessed people we are we having access to that Fountain brother Branham said we have a constant atume it's a constant atuma it never runs dry it's around us wherever we go you can sit right in your car seat and say Lord forgive me for that evil thought that just came to my mind you can sit right behind your office desk and say father forgive me I should not be thinking about them like that you have a constant atonement you have access wherever you are you don't have to run to the prayer meeting you don't have to wait until you come to church and have a a a a guilt in your heart you can make it right right there and right now [Music] you can go to your brothers says I'm sorry just hold my hand pray for me I don't know why I thought that about you or why I said that

home guilty yes and most of the time that's when people starts to struggle and it starts to fuss with the word I was the one he was talking about he was talking to me and they did and the devil would
