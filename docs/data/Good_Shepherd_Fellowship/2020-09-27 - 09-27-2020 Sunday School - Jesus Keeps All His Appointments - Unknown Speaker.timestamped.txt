[0:00] time up in in the samaria the city of
[0:03] sakai
[0:04] had been forgiven of every sin and she
[0:07] realized that that might be an
[0:08] opportunity for her
[0:10] so how is she going to get to him now
[0:13] she seen
[0:13] he was needy and she wanted to serve him
[0:17] and couldn't get to him that's about the
[0:20] way it is
[0:22] so she thought what can i do he has no
[0:25] anointing
[0:26] his feet's dirty nobody's paying
[0:28] attention oh
[0:29] if i could only get in there that's the
[0:32] real
[0:32] pin at heart if i could only get to it
[0:36] now she think get her mind catches
[0:38] something you know what i believe i'll
[0:38] do
[0:39] i know down the street she goes just as
[0:41] quick as she can down through the alley
[0:43] up this little creaky steps and opens
[0:45] the door goes in there and gets a
[0:47] stocking top you know and pulls it out
[0:50] counts how much money she's got she said
[0:53] is that enough to buy some anointing oil
[0:55] let's see if it is there's 20 pieces of
[0:57] roman dynamia
[0:58] perhaps that's enough but wait i can't
[1:00] do that he's a prophet
[1:02] and he'll know where i got that money
[1:04] he'll know how i got it
[1:06] i just can't do it so she perhaps laid
[1:08] it back again
[1:09] and once she laid it back it was
[1:11] something kept speaking to her heart
[1:14] but would you let him sit there dirty
[1:15] like that
[1:17] would you let the only man that can take
[1:19] away your sins
[1:20] set dirty when you can give him service
[1:24] so she says to herself whether he knows
[1:26] or not
[1:27] i'm going and down the street she went
[1:29] and run into a store where his
[1:31] little hook those fellas sitting in
[1:33] there and well what do you want to hear
[1:34] she said i want the best alabaster
[1:38] ointment that you got not the cheapest
[1:41] i want the best she had a special reason
[1:46] and that's what we ought to do we are to
[1:48] give him our best
[1:50] everything we are our youthful life not
[1:52] wait you were old and dying
[1:54] give the best we got to him and there
[1:58] she got the very best he went up said
[1:59] let's see how much money that is and he
[2:01] got the money first
[2:02] he knew her also so i said yes she had
[2:04] the money so
[2:05] where you going with this i have it for
[2:07] a special occasion
[2:09] so she goes up now she has no invitation
[2:13] but how's she going to get in but
[2:15] somehow if you want to do a service for
[2:17] jesus
[2:18] he'll make a way for you get in somehow
[2:20] another
[2:21] she got in and there was jesus sitting
[2:24] there yet
[2:24] and she happened to think which got in
[2:26] there heart beating real fast oh my
[2:28] what if he'd happen to turn me down
[2:30] there's a lot of things to think about
[2:32] what if he'd come up here and say say
[2:34] you foul woman
[2:36] what are you doing here in my presence
[2:37] know you not that i'm a son of god
[2:39] you shouldn't be here in my presence her
[2:42] heart
[2:42] almost failed and she thought what can i
[2:44] do but i've got to get to him i can't
[2:47] pass this time
[2:48] this may be the last opportunity i'll
[2:50] have
[2:52] it might be yours too
[2:57] look down and her heart begin to swell
[3:00] up
[3:02] she knows she's in his presence that
[3:04] something happens when you get in his
[3:05] presence
[3:07] she noticed the tears began to fall off
[3:08] of her cheeks and she was standing there
[3:10] shaking with this box in her hand
[3:12] and she fell down at his feet and she
[3:15] thought i can't look up
[3:16] i'm so guilty and dirty i can't look up
[3:19] so
[3:20] she started crying they began to fall
[3:21] upon his feet and she began to wash him
[3:23] like
[3:24] with her hands white and trying to wipe
[3:25] the tears off of his feet and
[3:27] washing his feet with her tears and
[3:29] after a while
[3:30] she didn't have no towel to wipe his
[3:33] feet with so
[3:34] her hair was hanging down and she began
[3:37] to wipe his feet with the hair that was
[3:39] on her head
[3:40] more than our sisters have a time doing
[3:42] that they'd have to stand on their head
[3:43] to do it
[3:47] our sisters today what if
[3:50] you one of the women realize that god
[3:53] keeps all his promise i wonder if you
[3:55] realize that it's
[3:56] totally impossible for you to get in
[3:59] like that
[4:01] he keeps all of his promises do you
[4:04] realize what you're doing when you're
[4:05] doing that
[4:06] you're denying virtue
[4:11] the bible said that if a woman kebabs
[4:13] her hair is even a common thing for her
[4:15] even prey
[4:16] and she dishonors her husband in doing
[4:18] so and remember it was a woman that
[4:21] broke one commandment of god that caused
[4:23] all this to do that do you think one
[4:25] breaking one will get back in
[4:28] think of it maybe sometimes
[4:32] ministers hasn't gotten nerve enough to
[4:34] tell you this is one time you're going
[4:36] to hear it
[4:38] it's the truth someone said why don't
[4:41] you leave off that women
[4:42] a great man told me that not long ago
[4:44] said why they believe you're a prophet
[4:46] you teach them how to
[4:47] receive the holy ghost and get these
[4:48] great big things and how to to be
[4:50] prophets and so forth
[4:51] i said teach them greater things i said
[4:53] how can i teach them algebra when they
[4:55] won't even learn their abcs
[4:58] it shows the outside expresses what's on
[5:01] the inside
[5:04] but you're going to do it anyhow why
[5:07] you're not conscious of it
[5:10] amen there she was with her hair she
[5:13] began to wipe his feet with it and drive
[5:15] his feet off
[5:16] she was scared to death that's why she
[5:18] picked up this bottle of ointment she
[5:20] broke it and she tried to hit it and
[5:21] break it and put it on his feet just
[5:22] crying
[5:23] and every time she'd cry she'd reach
[5:24] down and kiss his feet she got
[5:26] hysterically
[5:28] when you get in this presence it makes
[5:30] you hysterically
[5:32] i got hysterically any man ever gets in
[5:35] his presence
[5:36] that's believes him and has faith in him
[5:38] it'll make you hysterically
[5:40] on the day of pentecost when he come in
[5:42] the form of the holy ghost
[5:44] they got hysterically when you really
[5:47] believe
[5:48] and you know and recognize that your
[5:50] opportunity and you're in his presence
[5:53] you're sure of it she'd
[5:57] kiss his feet and cry and wash him
[6:00] whiten
[6:01] and kiss his feet again you know jesus
[6:04] if he'd have moved one foot
[6:06] she'd have jumped up and run out there
[6:08] you know he just said let her do it
[6:10] you know if you want to do something for
[6:12] he lets you do it
[6:14] it may be all out of order but he lets
[6:16] you in anyhow
[6:18] and he's doing him a service and she was
[6:20] washing his feet
[6:21] and he just sat there and looked at her
[6:23] she was afraid to look up because
[6:24] freddie would make her scat
[6:26] and see she was washing his feet his
[6:28] opportunity to do something boring
[6:30] and she was just i see when he when
[6:33] jesus
[6:34] spoke back to the pharisee he justified
[6:37] her by her works
[6:38] but when he justified her to herself he
[6:41] justified by her faith thy faith is
[6:43] saving
[6:43] he showed pharisee what her works was
[6:46] because your works expresses your faith
[6:48] now let your hair grow out now
[6:52] see it expresses what you believe or not
[6:54] that's god's word there's no scripture
[6:55] in the bible but what that's the truth
[6:58] why do you do it now
[7:01] notice too much hollywood in pentecost
[7:03] that's what's the matter
[7:04] amen now we find out that's the truth
[7:06] it's just too much hollywood
[7:08] you watch these things and pattern
[7:10] yourself a lady said to me not long ago
[7:11] she said
[7:12] little tight dress on i said why don't
[7:14] you take that off of being a sister
[7:16] and she said well brother brandman don't
[7:18] make any other clothes i said they make
[7:19] sewing machines and they got goods
[7:21] i think you just want to i'll tell you
[7:24] why
[7:24] let me tell you sister
[7:28] thank you one of these days you're going
[7:30] to have to answer for committing
[7:32] adultery
[7:33] you say well brother brown i miss this
[7:35] pure to my husband as i can be i'm just
[7:37] pure to my boyfriend that might be so
[7:38] too
[7:39] but jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[7:41] woman to lust after her
[7:43] half committed adultery with her already
[7:46] in his heart
[7:47] and if you've presented yourself out
[7:49] there and that sinner thinks that about
[7:50] you because you presented yourself
[7:52] that to the other judgment when he
[7:54] answers for committing adultery who is
[7:56] guilty
[7:58] think of it that's exactly right
[8:01] oh women come home back sisters come
[8:04] back to christ
[8:06] brothers you do the same and you man let
[8:08] your wife do that
[8:10] and call yourself a man head of the
[8:11] house
[8:14] notice we're in a terrible time friend
[8:18] and we noticing here was this little
[8:20] woman kissing his feet and washing his
[8:22] feet and whitening with her
[8:24] hairs of her head and all at once old
[8:26] pharisee within a corner he happened to
[8:28] notice it
[8:29] oh my his righteous ignatian
[8:32] rose and his his big chin swelled out
[8:35] his face looked like would burst oh
[8:37] ma he said come here look here look over
[8:41] there
[8:41] and he said within his own heart now
[8:44] in his in his mind he said if that man
[8:48] was a prophet he would know what
[8:51] manner of woman that is touched him see
[8:54] if he is a prophet or not
[8:57] see he perceived the thoughts that was
[8:59] in his heart
[9:01] and all at once she moved and the little
[9:03] woman raised to look up
[9:05] her eyes blaring he looked over and he
[9:07] said
[9:08] simon he said i i got something to say
[9:12] to you
[9:16] here you are simon i got something to
[9:19] say to you
[9:22] you invited me here i'll come on your
[9:24] invitation
[9:25] you invited me and when i come to the
[9:29] door
[9:30] you never wash my feet and when i come
[9:33] in
[9:34] you're never anointed my head you let me
[9:35] come in dirty
[9:38] and you never kiss me welcome
[9:41] though you invited me but this woman
[9:45] here
[9:45] let her be whatever she may be
[9:48] she has washed my feet with her tears
[9:53] she's wiped him with the hairs of her
[9:56] head
[9:57] and she has anointed my feet and
[10:00] constantly
[10:01] kissed my feet ever since she's been
[10:02] laying there amen
[10:07] he found out what he's a prophet or not
[10:09] then he said simon i want you to look at
[10:11] something
[10:14] he said what kind i'll give you a riddle
[10:16] said when one
[10:18] much is forgiven much as love
[10:23] and he gave him the saying and simon
[10:24] answered him back
[10:26] notice simon didn't give him anything to
[10:29] wash his feet with
[10:31] but he had the best water that could be
[10:34] just think the tears of a repented
[10:36] sinner
[10:37] washing the dirt off of jesus feet
[10:42] tears out of a sinner's eyes
[10:46] washing the dirt from his feet oh man

[10:50] when you see the reproach upon the
[10:52] gospel
[10:54] and we're so starchy would take all the
[10:56] makeup off of our face if we
[10:57] cried a tear
[11:00] we look horrible and get on the street
[11:02] what are you going to be when you face
[11:03] the
[11:04] portals of heaven on her and there she

[11:12] and doing everything as she could
[11:13] because she wanted forgiveness and all
[11:16] of a sudden she
[11:17] she wonder what he's going to do now he
[11:20] had showed simon
[11:21] and that backfired on him the thing that
[11:24] he said he was the prophet was prove
[11:26] that he was a prophet
[11:27] that he was the word of god now he's
[11:29] standing there with his face swelled out
[11:31] of you he'll grab that little woman
[11:33] thought her out of the church but she
[11:36] got what she asked for

[11:42] she got what she asked for now he turns
[11:44] to her her little heart begin to beat
[11:46] real fast now what's he going to say
[11:48] there she is all of her pretty curls is
[11:51] hanging all down
[11:52] over her waist chair and her her eyes
[11:56] are streaking with tears
[11:57] and her face and lips are all greasy
[12:00] where she's been kissing his feet and
[12:01] actually put that all
[12:02] on him she sure looks messed up
[12:06] but then great big eyes looking to see
[12:08] what's going to say
[12:09] he said and i say unto her
[12:14] all her sins which are many are forgiven
[12:18] [Music]
[12:19] that's it all her sins are forgiven
[12:24] that's what i want to hear oh that's the
[12:27] words that i
[12:28] want i don't care what the rest of him
[12:29] says i'm ready to stand in his
[12:32] denomination and declare that he is the
[12:34] word of god
[12:35] i don't care what they say penny turn on

[12:39] mind reader fortune teller whatever you
[12:41] want to i'm ready to kiss
[12:43] the reproach from him it's his word
[12:48] certainly he promised that he is the
[12:51] word just as much
[12:52] today as he was then he said so
[12:55] now friend there may be people sitting
[12:58] here that can't agree
[12:59] that he's the prophet you might not
[13:02] agree that he's a healer
[13:04] but there's one thing that every church
[13:06] member should agree
[13:07] he's a savior and i want to say this
[13:10] before closing
[13:12] not long ago a attorney friend of mine
[13:15] was trying a case of a man and woman
[13:17] that it was going to him
[13:19] uh separate and attorney was a fine
[13:21] christian gentleman he said
[13:22] don't don't separate he tried his best
[13:24] to keep him from it but not this
[13:26] determined there was going to be
[13:27] something come up between them
[13:29] after a while he said well if you got
[13:31] the home down there you better go down
[13:33] divide the spoils because if they
[13:34] have to get them down and lawyers and
[13:37] things get into it you know what's going
[13:38] to happen
[13:39] they'll take every bit of it so they
[13:41] went into the rooms to divide up what
[13:43] they had they went into the parlor
[13:44] they fussed and stood obliged this and i
[13:47] had this and they went on in the next
[13:48] room and divided in there and
[13:50] finally it went up in the attic they had
[13:52] a remember they had an old trunk up
[13:53] there
[13:54] they got in there and began to say well
[13:55] this belonged to my mama this was my
[13:57] mama's
[13:58] like that and it got down in the trunk a
[14:00] piece both of them kneeling on the floor
[14:02] with the trunk right open dividing up
[14:04] what was what
[14:06] they couldn't agree that belongs to me i
[14:08] paid for that
[14:09] i've done the work i stayed home when
[14:10] you did it fussing
[14:13] finally they raised up something else
[14:15] and both of them grabbed the same time
[14:18] what was it a little pair of shoes
[14:21] from a little baby that had been born to
[14:23] that union that god had taken
[14:27] they couldn't argue that had something
[14:30] in common
[14:32] as he held their hands he remembered
[14:35] that she was a mother that baby
[14:38] he remembered she was a mother she
[14:41] remembered he was a father
[14:42] as they help the little shoes in their
[14:44] hands they pull one another to each
[14:46] other
[14:47] put their arms around each other the
[14:49] divorce case was involved
[14:52] why they found something they had in
[14:54] common
[14:56] you might have disagreed with me this
[14:57] week to see the holy spirit come in
[14:59] confirm these words and things do
[15:01] you might disagree with that you might
[15:02] disagree with the sick being healed
[15:04] but we do have one thing in common
[15:06] that's the blood of jesus christ that
[15:08] saves us from sins
[15:09] will you wash the dirt from his feet
[15:11] tonight let us bow our heads just a
[15:13] moment
[15:14] remember he keeps every promise
[15:18] he keeps every promise he promised
[15:20] though your sins be a scarlet
[15:22] they shall be wise know all your sins
[15:25] are forgiven you
[15:26] if you'll just believe it with our heads
[15:28] bound
[15:29] i wonder how many here will raise your
[15:31] hand and say brother branham
[15:32] i want to rest in my life i want to not
[15:36] let him sit and be disgraced and
[15:38] i have an opportunity like the little
[15:40] woman did i want to
[15:42] with my testimony to wash the dirt from
[15:44] him
[15:45] that his precious name will you raise
[15:47] your hand say pray for me brother random
[15:48] ah god bless you god bless you that's
[15:51] fine
[15:52] now heavenly father there were
[15:56] many many hands that went up here just
[15:58] now
[16:00] and we see that the name of jesus christ
[16:03] has been stomped into the dirt
[16:06] and everything in heaven's name that
[16:09] everything on earth is named that
[16:11] every every church member every member
[16:13] of the body of christ
[16:15] is miss jesus and we pray heavenly
[16:18] father that we'll
[16:19] see and understand that tonight may your
[16:22] grace come upon these people now and

[16:25] that they know that in your presence now
[16:28] and know that you're here let your holy
[16:31] spirit teach us all now

[16:36] sins and our mistakes
[16:37] and from tonight on may we be new
[16:39] creatures fill with your spirit
[16:41] granted may we be conscious of your
[16:43] presence for we asked it in his name and
[16:46] while we have our heads bowed
[16:48] i wonder tonight now i'm talking to
