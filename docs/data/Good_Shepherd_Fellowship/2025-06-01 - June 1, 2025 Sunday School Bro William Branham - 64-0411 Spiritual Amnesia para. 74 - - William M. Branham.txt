========================================

[Music] [Music] and get the voice of God behind it. They'd only laugh at it and make fun of it. You know the old saying, fools will walk with hobnail shoes where angels fear to try. That's what this spiritual amnesia does. Makes people get to a spot to where they have no feeling on the inside of them. They don't want nothing that's spiritual. Take a real spiritual meeting where the Holy Spirit's healing the sick and discerning the thoughts that's in the heart and put it in among all the churches. It's a great rally out here in this stadium. And look what would happen in a few minutes. Everybody be getting up, walking out. They have nothing to do with it. They don't want nothing to do with it. They'll listen to some intellectual talk, but when it comes to the power of Jesus Christ and his resurrection and the Holy Ghost, they want nothing to do with it because it condemns them. It sets them a fire. But the thing that they ought to know, no chastisement of course is pleasant for the season, but it if you yield to it, it it brings the fruits of repentance. So we find out when this spiritual amnesia get a hold of the people, then they are they're in a bad condition. Now we find the same now. Now I want to you must be identified somewhere. You must show your life shows tonight where you are identified. You are identified either in Christ or out of Christ. You are not halfway. There's no such a thing as a drunk sober man. There's no black white bird. You're either a saved or you're not saved. You are a saint or a sinner. One or the other. And your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing. Amen. God's word vindicated proved that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of Pentecost or any other time. And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not. Right? No matter if you're a deacon, even if you're a preacher, it doesn't make you they get it, too. So, we find out it's contagious and hits the whole thing. Now we notice now to be an American to be American I must be identified with my nation. Now listen close to be an American when I am born here in this country I become a citizen and I'm uh identified with this nation. All it is I am. all that it has been. I am for I am identified as an American. Then I have to take all of its shame, all of its glory. Whatever it is, I am because I'm identified with it. Amen. Amen. I want you to get it. Amen. I'm identified as an American citizen. Then all it was, I am. All it is, I am. I must be part of it. I've got If I'm an American citizen, I'm part of America and all that it is I am. I must never forget this. If I want to remain a true American citizen, I must remember that I am what my nation is. For I'm identified with my nation. to forget her or or to fight for her or to die for her or to stand for all she stands for. I must stand for it. Amen. What my nation is, I am. What it stands for, I stand for it. To be a lawyer American, I'll be ready to die for it, fight for it, stand for it, do anything there is. I'm part of it. Amen. You can't pick on it without picking on me. When you say something against it, you say it against me. For I am an American. They say it against you as American. What they say against this nation, they say against you. For you are a part of it. Don't you never forget it. When you do, then you've got amnesia. Sure enough. And remember, you're no more American citizen when you can't become a part of it. You must be what America is. You must be also. I must be partakers of her. This is my nation. I must be partakers of her. What she is, I am. See what she was. I am. No matter what she was, I'm still what she was to be an American. I landed on Plymouth Rock with her with the forefathers. I had to. I am part of her. I wrote with Paul Rivere to warn her of her dangers. If I'm a real American citizen, I landed on Plymouth Rock. I rode with Paul Rivere to warn her of her danger. Do you know what I'm meaning now? I crossed the icy Delaware with George Washington with his barefooted soldiers. I was there where I'm identified with this nation. What he did there was part of me. What I do now is part of him. I was identified with Washington at the Delaware. I stood with Stonewall Jackson when the odds were so great against him. And they asked, "How can you stand like a Stonewall when the odds is against you?" A little bashful blue-eyed fellow kicking this dust with his boots. He said, "I never take a drink of water until I thank Almighty God for it. I have to stand like a stonewall with him." Amen. uh stood there with Stonewall Jackson to be American. I'm identified with him and his stand crossing Delawarees fighting battles. I hosted the flag. I was with them when they hosted the flag on Guam after thousands of American soldiers gave their life. And when that little group went up there and throwed the flag up, I was identified in that raising of that flag. Every one of us was all American citizens was identified with that flag hanging over Guam. I heard that they put that flag up there. Tears running down my cheeks. That was me. That was you. That meant us all when was identified there with that all she is I am. All her glory is my glory. All her shame is my shame. If she's done shameful things, then I have to stare her stand her reproach. If she receives glory, I receive glory with her because I'm identified with her. Now, to be identified, American has to stand for all America's shame, all America's glory, all she ever was, all she is, or what she will be. You are identified with it. Now, to be a true Christian, you have to be the same. We don't want to forget that. All that he was, I'm identified with him. I'm identified with him. Notice, and he is in me and I in him. Notice that every Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy before there was the foundation of the world. We were identified in the immortal realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed. I was back there with him if we got eternal life. I was there with him. I was identified with him when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy. I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of of 75 years old and his wife being 65 and told him they were going to have a baby. I was with him when he took his stand up on thus sayaeth the Lord. I'm going to have the baby. I stood with him. Every other Christian stood with him. Amen. I was with him when his temptations come. I was with him when he went up on top of the mountain to offer up Isaac. I was with him when the ram appeared. I was with Joseph when he was rejected of his brothers because he was spiritual and the rest of them was carnal. I was with him when I know the reproach he had to stand by his own brothers. What he was I am. Amen. What I am, he was. For we are all one in Christ Jesus. Amen. I was with Joseph in his cave grave. I was with him when he went to the right hand of Pharaoh. You had to be identified with him. I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel. I wrestled myself. I know what he went through with. So I wrestle with Jacob the same time he did. For I am his brother. I was with Moses when he went out into Egypt. I was with Moses at the burning bush. If you're a Christian, you are identified with them Bible characters. Don't forget it. Amen. I was with Moses when all the people turned against him. I was with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea. When he raised his hand and walked forward and the Red Sea opened. I was identified in Christ right then and I was with Moses at that hour. Hallelujah. Whatever Christians has been, whatever believers has been, every believer now is identified with that same person. Whatever it is, you must be identified. Don't forget that. When you do, you got spiritual amnesia. You've forgotten who you are now. Identified with him, with Moses when he crossed the sea. I was with Elijah in the days of Ahab when they had to make a choice who they would serve. God our Balum. We was with him on Mount Carmel when he had to make this choice for we are identified in the body of the same God that he was identified in. So if we are identified in that body then we must remember we were there with him. Right now I was with David when he was rejected by his own brethren. I was with David. You were too if you're a Christian. You have to be identified in his rejection. I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace when the the fire couldn't burn him because of the presence of the fourth man. I was with Daniel in the lion's den. I was identified in there. When the angel of the Lord identified him in there, I most surely was with him at Calvary. I must be identified with him at Calvary. Amen. I must be there to a place that where not also was I identified with him at Calvary, I died with him at Calvary. Every Christian must die with him at Calvary. If you don't die with him at Calvary, you can't be none of his. I was there when he died. I died with him and then I was with him when he raised up from the dead. Hallelujah. I come up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection. Whatever he did, I was right there with him. Every believer was the same. And now I am seated with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of hell conquered to him. Every Christian believer was seated the same way because you have to be identified. Now I find myself in this last days with the many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry. He is the same yesterday, today and forever. I find myself in this day identified in his ministry. Do you find yourself that way believing it, walking with it? Notice the works that he did. He said the believer would do the same thing. The works that I do shall you also. Then can you be identified with him? Then when the reproach comes on the word, can you stand the reproach like he did? See, identified with him. I was identified with him. I was with him at the day of Pentecost. I was with the disciples up there. Identified with them in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much now that they don't, some of them don't even believe there is such a thing as the Holy Ghost. See where the church has got a very bad case of amnesia. See, they have forgotten that that was Jesus Christ back there. They have forgotten what Jesus Christ was. They have forgotten. They thought he was just a a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man. They forgot that he was God. They forgot that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia. They have forgotten all these things. They don't understand it no more. We must be with the disciples at Pentecost. Identify with them. I was identified with Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts the 2 chapter. I heard what he said. I believe what he said. I obeyed what he said. Now I'm identified in the same thing. Amen. Don't get spiritual amnesia cause you will you identify yourself with something else. Stay right with that word. was with the church when it was commissioned by Jesus Christ in Acts the 16th chapter. Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. I want to be identified there. All the world to every creature. These signs shall follow them that believe can be identified in that. Well, are you identified with that? Or have you got some spiritual amnesia that you find out you don't believe those signs follow the believers? See, if you don't believe it, then you have spiritual amnesia. See, you've forgotten that God promised that. He said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." Don't forget it. You can't forget it to be a Christian. You must be identified with it. You must be identified with St. John the 14th chapter, the 12th verse. He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also. Don't forget it. If you do, then you've got spiritual amnesia. You've forgotten who you are. You've forgotten what your testimony means. How about he said, "If you abide in me and my word in you, you can ask what you will and it'll be done for you." Are you identified there to believe it? That is the truth. Mark 11, when he said, "If you say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you have said will come to pass, you can have what you've said." Amen. Can you be identified there to believe it? That is the truth. If it hasn't, then you're getting spiritual amnesia and it it you forget you lose your Christian balance. You can't tell where you've belong. You say, "I'm Methodist. I'm Baptist. That's what I know about it. I'm Pentecostal. I'm this that the other." Watch out. That may mean that the disease sign is showing on you that you've got some spiritual amnesia. You say, "Well, brother Brandon, I believe this. I don't Now wait just a minute. If God promised to do these things and said they'd be in the last days and your creed will keep you promised. That's a good sign. I can see the disease sign on you. It's spiritual amnesia. You have forgotten to identify yourself with the word. Amen. That's right. You say, "I don't believe that the sick are healed." You got spiritual amnesia. You say, "I don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost." Spiritual amnesia. You say, "I I don't believe that God promised to do these things in the last days." Then you've listened to a creed or some doctrine instead of the Bible. You have spiritual amnesia. Amen. You don't know where you do belong, man. You're confessing a Christian and denying the word. Amen. Brings you right back to spiritual amnesia again. Don't know where you stand. You got spiritual amnesia. You can't identify yourself with the scriptures. You have to be with the disciples. You have to be with all the scripture. with the church when his commission. But now when the church was commissioned, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. These signs shall follow them and believe. That was her commission. Now they have that was the commission. But they have gotten a bad case of this spiritual amnesia just like Eve got on the on her around through the garden one day. Now she's like Israel suffering from this same disease. an allergy from a seminary diet that'll give you spiritual amnesia. Get some seminary diet and you'll get an allergy and then the first thing you know you'll get amnesia real bad. You won't believe anything the Bible says. That's what's the matter with the church today. That's what's the matter. We can't have revival today. That's what's the matter with the people today. They've been so drug over coals of everything and every ism it could hatch up till they don't know what is right and wrong. Exactly. Amen. She can't remember her Lord. She can't remember his word. She can't remember the promise. That was what was the matter with Israel when Jesus come on the scene. They could not remember that a virgin shall conceive. They could not remember that Moses said, "The Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me." Amen. They had spiritual amnesia. That's exactly what the church has got today. He said, "It shall come to pass in the last days that these things would take place that we taking place and the church set just apostles. Amen. What is it? Spiritual amnesia. Amen. We call ourselves Pentecost and can't divide and can't identify ourselves in the word preaching the power of the resurrection. And doing exactly what he said he would do. Then watch out. Our denominational system has got us into spiritual amnesia. We're suffering. We don't know where we belong. One takes his papers from this church to the other church and this church and this ism and that isn't. See what we need again is another Amos to come on the scene. But thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. Would we receive him? Not like they did. They never received him. They wouldn't receive him today. He couldn't get his head in a place hardly to preach. That's exactly right. Because the church is suffering with this spiritual amnesia. Now why God promised in this last days when the son of man would be revealed according to Luke 17th chapter at the sign it was taking place as Sodom would take place again. And the people see it done and some of them don't even believe it. They think it's telepathy. They think it's a devil spirit. What is it? They're suffering with spiritual amnesia. Exactly. They can't understand their Lord. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. What he was then, he is now. Amen. But what's happened? Just can't identify herself no more with the word. Why? She she don't know whether she's a lodge or whether she's a church. She don't want to be called a lodge and she can't be called a church. Course to be called a church would identify herself with Christ. That gives her spiritual amnesia and she don't want to be called a lodge. So it ain't the Pentecostal church, the Methodist church, the Baptist church. It's a Pentecostal lodge, Methodist lodge, and Baptist lodge because she can't be identified with the word. And when the word's made manifest, they still don't believe it. Disease, spiritual amnesia. Can't identify themselves. They don't know where they belong. That's right. It's just exactly like hybriding something. As I've often said, I always thought one of the most dumbest things I ever seen was a mule. See, he's a hybrid. See, his mother was a mayor. His daddy was a donkey. And he don't even know where he belongs. And the first thing you know, you you you can breed him and get a donkey and that or get the mule, but the mule can't breed itself back again. See, he don't you can't teach him nothing. He's hard-headed. You'll never do anything. You accept them big long years and he'll wait the longest day of his life just before he dies to kick you. That's all. He's always waiting for something to bust it on you if he can. That puts in mind a lot of so-called hybrid Christians. They've hybrid in a church until they got the disease of spiritualism. They can't reproduce nothing again. You talk about hybrid corn. Hybrid corn is nothing. It's the worst thing you ever put in your mouth. Anything hybrid. That's the reason you have to take these little hot bed plants and hybrid stuff and spray it and doctor it and baby it. Why? Because it can't keep the bugs off of it. But a genuine fair bread, you don't have to put no disinfect on him. He's got power within yourself. Take that keep the bugs of unbelief off. But a real genuine spirited man. Take an old mule and you're going to talk to him. Say, "Say boy, I want you to do this." You su big ears working them down. I've seen a a lot of Christians about like that. Soal. You say Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever. These signs shall follow that believe. Huh. I believe the days of miracles is passed. Huh? Huh? See, he don't know what he does believe. He don't know. He don't know where he come from. He don't know where he's going. He's got horse amnesia. He don't know where he come from. He can't go no farther. But I like a genuine thoroughbred. Oh, he's gentle. You can talk to him. He knows who his papa was, who his mama was, who his grandpa and grandma was. He's got pedigreed papers to show where he come from. Not like a pedigreed Christian that can go all the way back to the word of God to the day of paper and identify themselves there with the saint where the power of the Holy Ghost came upon them. That's a pedigreed Christian. He knows where he come from. He's not identified with Methodist, Baptist, or nothing else. He's identified in God's word. He knows exactly where he's standing with. The royal blood of his father flows through him. The blood of Jesus Christ. He knows what it does. He believes every word. God works through him and confirms it with the signs that he promised to follow. He hasn't got no spiritual amnesia. He's a genuine. Hallelujah. Third bread. I like that. But the church today has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia. It doesn't know where it belongs. It's forgot all about it. Forgot all these things that makes it a church. What made us so rich as we are? It's got into the place of Lady Osia again. Back into that rich place like Israel was when it was poor and had to trust God for everything it could do. Everything that God had trusted God. Then God was with it and it was spiritually moved on. But when it got rich, here's what happened. Their cities built up and their women got immoral. Their man permitted it. Their preachers let down the bar and their denounced the prophets. And that's the kind of a condition they got into. What caused that? But forgetting where them blessings come from. Amen. Do you Methodist? Are you Baptist? Are you Presbyterian? You Methodist, can you remember John Wesley? You Baptist John Smith wept for the affairs of people till his wife would have to lead him to the table. His eyes swell shut from crying and praying all night long. What's the matter? John Wesley said one of the great things I believe it was one of the early Methodist fathers said the disgrace of the daughters of the Methodist church was being beginning to get so early they were wearing rings upon their finger. What would he say now with shorts on them? What happened? Spiritual evil. That's right. Exactly what it is. Forot where you come from. You've got all these things because God's goodness goodness did it to you. Do you think this is a [Music] [Music]
