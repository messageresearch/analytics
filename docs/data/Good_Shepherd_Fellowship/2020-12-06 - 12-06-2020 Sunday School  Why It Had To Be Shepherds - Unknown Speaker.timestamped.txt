[0:00] when we eat and drink the communion a
[0:03] new with him in the father's Kingdom at
[0:06] the end of the
[0:08] road and then let us approach it tonight
[0:11] as if this was the last Christmas
[0:15] message we'd ever set together in in the
[0:18] deepness of
[0:20] sincerity I want to speak tonight on an
[0:23] unusual subject but sometimes you find
[0:28] God in the unusual things
[0:30] he does things in an unusual way not the
[0:34] usual way it's the unusual way unusual
[0:37] times unusual seems he's
[0:42] unusual and I want to Lord willing want
[0:45] to speak on the subject of
[0:48] why it had to be
[0:52] Shepherd and now just before we approach
[0:56] the word which I believe that is God
[1:00] God in the beginning was the word and
[1:04] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:06] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:09] dwelt Among Us I said last week a week
[1:13] before last at Phoenix it's proven that
[1:16] there is subjects of this Earth
[1:20] people passing through this building
[1:24] now television proves that it's in
[1:26] another dimension our natural eyes and
[1:29] our five senses cannnot pick that up it
[1:32] isn't that television manufactures
[1:35] anything it only channels you cannot
[1:39] make a move with your finger you cannot
[1:41] bat your eye but it's proven to be
[1:44] recorded
[1:47] forever I might be standing here a man
[1:49] in Australia would have a a television
[1:52] screen here not only that but the the
[1:55] man could speak move his finger bat his
[1:59] eye or even the color clothing that he's
[2:02] wearing would be projected here on the
[2:05] wall and he in Africa Australia around
[2:09] the
[2:10] world see there is a cycle of ether
[2:13] waves I cannot explain it but I know
[2:15] it's there I don't think anyone could
[2:17] really explain
[2:18] it so this television can pull this in
[2:22] and make it a reality by some
[2:25] instruments that they can reflect it on
[2:27] the wall now that same thing was here
[2:30] when Adam was here television was here
[2:33] when when Elijah sat on Mount
[2:36] Carmel it was here when Martin Luther
[2:39] that young priest soow the communion on
[2:41] the floor and said it's kosha and the
[2:44] just shall live of faith it was here
[2:46] then but we are just now finding
[2:50] it and it's also soul that in our
[2:55] presence tonight is God angels
[3:00] supernatural beings that's unseen to our
[3:04] natural sense of sight but someday it'll
[3:07] be a reality just as television is now
[3:09] and just as
[3:12] common now that's why I believe the
[3:17] word Jesus said whosoever shall add one
[3:20] word to this Bible or take one word out
[3:23] of it his part will be taken out of the
[3:25] book of
[3:26] life so let us bow our heads then before
[3:29] before we even read
[3:31] it so
[3:33] solemn any man that's got physical
[3:36] strength could turn back the page but
[3:39] only God can reveal it and with our
[3:43] heads bowed now towards the dust from
[3:45] which we were
[3:47] taken and someday shall
[3:50] return I wondering in this solemn moment
[3:53] as we're approaching
[3:55] Christmas if there is some here that
[3:58] really feel
[4:00] unworthy and would like to be remembered
[4:03] in this prayer would you with without
[4:06] raising your head just raise your hands
[4:08] to God and say Remember Me Lord this
[4:11] Christmas God bless
[4:14] you most holy and gracious heavenly
[4:19] father almighty
[4:23] God he that was from the beginning
[4:26] before there was a star or a Adam or are
[4:29] a
[4:32] molecule you made all things by Jesus
[4:35] Christ your son and has given us all
[4:38] things freely in him we thank thee
[4:42] tonight Lord for this
[4:45] opportunity that you have given us to
[4:48] assemble ourselves together to be
[4:51] warned and taught by the Holy
[4:55] Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes your
[4:59] word words and reveals them to
[5:03] us for Jesus said when he the spirit of
[5:06] Truth has come he will remind you of
[5:09] these things that I have said and also
[5:13] show you things to
[5:15] come God there is not one in our
[5:18] midst neither is there one upon the
[5:21] Earth who is worthy to try to interpret
[5:24] your word for it is written that the
[5:27] word of God is of no private interpret
[5:31] ation therefore Lord we pray that the
[5:34] holy spirit will give to us tonight each
[5:37] and every one the potion that we need to
[5:42] satisfy that hunger that's in our heart
[5:46] for a closer walk with thee we are unfit
[5:51] unclean
[5:53] unworthy let the child that was born in
[5:57] Bethlehem that lived the most per
[5:59] perfect life and was the only perfect
[6:02] man up on the earth and gave himself a
[6:06] ransom that he might cleanse us
[6:10] unclean Sinners and to bring us into
[6:14] relationship with the
[6:15] father Grant tonight that his holy
[6:18] spirit through the preaching of the word
[6:21] will do that for
[6:23] us Lord God there is many sick in the
[6:25] land today in the face of the best
[6:28] medicine that we ever doctored within
[6:30] the best medicines and the best
[6:32] hospitals and yet in all of
[6:34] our great scientific discoveries yet
[6:39] there is more sickness than the world
[6:41] ever do because there's more sin and
[6:44] unbelief in the world ever
[6:46] KN help us tonight great physici and
[6:49] heal the sick that's in our
[6:52] midst and give us the spirit the true
[6:55] Spirit of Christmas when today that when
[6:59] pagans
[7:01] ceremonies Christmas trees
[7:05] worship fiction stories of a a man named
[7:10] Santa
[7:11] Claus and of our Easter rabbits in the
[7:15] different fashions that the commercial
[7:17] world has capitalized on may it be laid
[7:20] aside
[7:21] God let us enter into
[7:26] Christ the word
[7:29] for we ask it in his name and for his
[7:32] glory
[7:35] amen if you will turn with me for a
[7:39] reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2
[7:44] chapter can you hear me all right is
[7:46] there any transposition in the
[7:48] microphones can you hear me in the back
[7:50] all right if you can raise your hand
[7:52] thank you the second chapter of The
[7:54] Gospel According to St Luke and it came
[7:58] to pass in those days that there went
[8:00] out a decree from Caesar Augusta that
[8:03] all the world should be
[8:07] taxed and this tax was first made known
[8:11] was governor of Syria and all went to be
[8:15] tax every one to his own country and
[8:18] Joseph also went up From Galilee into
[8:21] the city of Nazareth into Judea the city
[8:25] of David which is called Bethlehem
[8:28] because he was of of the house and
[8:30] lineage of David to be taxed with Mary
[8:34] his espouse wife being great with
[8:38] child and so it was that while she was
[8:41] there the days of her accomplishment
[8:44] that she should be delivered and she
[8:47] brought forth her firstborn son and
[8:50] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[8:52] laid him in the manger because there was
[8:56] no room for them in the end and there
[8:59] was in the same country shepherds
[9:03] abiding in the fields keeping watch over
[9:07] their flocks By Night Lo the angel of
[9:10] the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of
[9:13] the Lord Shone around about them and
[9:16] they were sore
[9:19] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[9:23] not for behold I bring Good Tidings of
[9:27] great joy which shall be to all people
[9:32] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[9:35] city of David a savior which is Christ
[9:38] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[9:42] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[9:44] swaddling clothes laying in a manger and
[9:49] suddenly there was yeah and suddenly
[9:53] there with the angel a multitude of
[9:56] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[9:59] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[10:01] peace good well toward man and it came
[10:05] to pass as the Angels were gone away
[10:09] from them into heaven the Shepherds said
[10:12] one to another let us go now even unto
[10:15] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[10:17] come to pass which the Lord has made
[10:19] known unto
[10:21] us and they came and haste and found
[10:24] Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in
[10:27] the manger and when when they had seen
[10:30] it they made know abroad the saying
[10:34] which was told them concerning the child
[10:37] and all they that heard it wondered at
[10:40] those things which were told them by the
[10:43] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[10:46] and pounded them in her
[10:49] heart and the Shepherds returned
[10:52] glorifying and praising God for all the
[10:55] things which they had heard and seen as
[10:59] it was told unto
[11:02] them may the Lord add His blessings to
[11:05] the reading of his
[11:07] word
[11:10] now it's uh
[11:12] why this great
[11:15] event was revealed to
[11:18] Shepherds that would be kind of an
[11:20] astounding thing for us I have some
[11:23] scriptures written here and a few notes
[11:25] that I will try to run over to explain
[11:27] to you why
[11:29] to the best of my
[11:31] knowledge and maybe then after this that
[11:33] the Lord with his grace tonight will
[11:35] take the wise away from us but did most
[11:40] all of us I suppose at one time or other
[11:43] has wondered why that this greatest
[11:47] event of all
[11:49] times was revealed to
[11:53] Shepherds why was it revealed to
[11:55] Shepherds and not to the theologians of
[11:58] that day
[12:00] they were the one were trained to hear
[12:02] it and why did it
[12:05] come and bypass the rich and come to the
[12:12] poor also why did it bypass the learned
[12:19] and wise and come to the humble and
[12:25] unlearned there is a few questions of
[12:28] why in this
[12:30] and another reason I might say notice
[12:33] the babe was born in
[12:36] Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew
[12:39] interpretation as we had a couple years
[12:42] ago here Bethlehem means the house of
[12:46] God's bread and we proved in the
[12:48] scriptures he could not come any other
[12:51] place bethleem was founded by Rahab and
[12:56] her uh her husband Rahab was a Harlot
[12:59] that a general courted from the the uh
[13:02] Israelite Army after they had taken uh
[13:05] Jericho and by faith she believed the
[13:09] message of God in her condition and she
[13:12] was
[13:13] saved and from there when Joshua divided
[13:17] up the lands of where each one would be
[13:21] and there's a great lesson that sometime
[13:23] I hope to be able to bring a Tucson of
[13:26] those Hebrew mothers giving birth to
[13:28] those babies when she groaned at the
[13:31] birth pain of the baby she called the
[13:33] name of the baby and that positionally
[13:36] placed it in the promised land its tribe
[13:40] a great thing all the word of God fits
[13:43] right together if it doesn't fit
[13:45] together it's not God's word is Misfit
[13:47] it's your thought is misfitting to the
[13:50] word it all fits together so then he was
[13:54] the bread of life as we taught last week
[13:56] in Phoenix or week before last
[14:00] and being the bread of life he could
[14:01] come no place else but the house of
[14:03] God's
[14:04] bread and that was the why now here
[14:07] Jesus is born in
[14:10] Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was
[14:15] synagogue great religious leaders lived
[14:18] in
[14:19] Bethlehem David the great king shepherd
[14:23] was born in
[14:25] Bethlehem his father Jess was was born
[14:29] in Bethlehem his grandfather oit was
[14:32] born in
[14:34] Bethlehem also all the way back he came
[14:38] from
[14:40] Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of
[14:44] David is born in Bethlehem right under
[14:47] the shadows of the great
[14:52] Cathedrals then if those people are
[14:55] trained and have been looking for the
[14:57] Messiah for all these years 4,000 years
[15:03] the Messiah had been prophesied to
[15:06] come and then if the Messiah be born in
[15:09] the shadow of the cathedral why did they
[15:13] have to go Plum back up into the
[15:14] mountains to a bunch of unlearned
[15:16] untrained
[15:19] Shepherds to
[15:21] bring the great message the first
[15:25] message and commission Shepherds
[15:30] not the wise and trained but
[15:33] Shepherds it's a strange thing isn't it
[15:37] well there's got to be a why somewhere
[15:39] there is a why now there's got to be an
[15:41] answer
[15:43] why and no man knows the answer save God
[15:48] he's the one that knows the answer now
[15:51] remember the Messiah was already in the
[15:54] city bned in the city in a stable right
[15:58] by the great cathed theal were the high
[16:00] priest and the great priest and the
[16:02] theologians and the wise and the trained
[16:06] all was there waiting for the
[16:09] Messiah and there he was right in their
[16:15] midst but why then did they go to the
[16:21] out on the hills of Judea to unlearned
[16:27] untrained uncultured
[16:29] Ed poorest of
[16:32] all look like the most unfit person for
[16:37] such a task to reveal the message and
[16:41] send them out to bring the
[16:45] message you know my opinion it might not
[16:48] Mount to very much but I want to pass my
[16:53] opinion I believe it's because of the
[16:56] wisdom of God that he knew knew they
[16:59] wouldn't receive such a message the way
[17:01] it
[17:02] come it wasn't in the taste of their
[17:07] learning it was
[17:09] different it wasn't what they had been
[17:12] trained to believe he would be like it
[17:16] was contrary to their
[17:19] theological
[17:22] understanding all their
[17:25] training all their learning was bypassed
[17:29] become
[17:31] not I believe it was the wisdom of God
[17:34] that knew that they would receive such a
[17:37] message so the Messiah was here and
[17:41] there must be somebody
[17:43] recognizing and he knew those who hadn't
[17:46] been mixed up in such stuff as that he
[17:49] would be more able to get his message to
[17:51] an unlearned group than he would be to a
[17:55] mixed up group that was so set in their
[17:58] ways that nothing could turn them not
[18:00] even the word of
[18:03] God and now Christian friends let me ask
[18:08] this
[18:09] question With all sincerity and love I
[18:13] just wonder if he would make the same
[18:17] act tonight and S to us in this
[18:22] generation the promised word that's
[18:25] promised for this generation I wonder if
[18:28] are theologians and Educators and wise
[18:32] wouldn't turn the message down just the
[18:35] same as they did then man' doesn't
[18:38] change neither does God's word
[18:41] change he's the unchanging
[18:45] God he doesn't
[18:48] change
[18:51] notice Angels coming and uh Angels
[18:56] coming and giving their message to man
[19:00] of such low a
[19:03] state when there were a man
[19:27] there
[19:30] notice Angels coming and uh Angels
[19:35] coming and giving their message to man
[19:39] of such low a
[19:42] state when there were men there much
[19:45] more Earthly thought of qualified than
[19:48] these poor illiterate
[19:54] Shepherds the shepherd was the most
[19:56] illiterate of anybody he he didn't need
[19:59] to know nothing but just about his sheep
[20:02] he didn't need to know
[20:04] mathematics he didn't need to know how
[20:06] to to split an
[20:08] atom he didn't need no
[20:12] scholarship he just had to know his
[20:15] sheep that's all that he needed to
[20:19] know and God the great wisdom and the
[20:23] fountain and resource of all
[20:26] wisdom would choose such a person as
[20:30] that persons rather as that and bypass
[20:34] all the wellt Tred Scholars that's
[20:37] trained to know
[20:39] that it speaks one thing that they were
[20:42] trained in the wrong
[20:45] field passing up all the important of
[20:47] the Lamb there were important people
[20:51] great
[20:52] teachers CES is the high priest many
[20:55] other great man all Israel Mighty
[20:59] learned all the denominations and all
[21:02] the boasting theologians God bypassed
[21:04] every one of
[21:06] them uh that's God's
[21:10] wisdom notice the highest
[21:14] Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most
[21:19] humble and
[21:20] unlearned the highest of
[21:24] Heavens came down to make himself known
[21:27] to the Lord of the
[21:30] earth bypassing all
[21:33] between to make yourself known the
[21:35] common
[21:38] herdsmen coming to give these common
[21:41] herdsmen the greatest message Of All
[21:45] Times there had been many great
[21:48] Messengers we' think of the Noah's day
[21:50] and the prophets and and the great
[21:53] priest and so forth have been in the
[21:54] Days Gone By the Great learned man Kings
[21:57] potent takes monarchs
[21:59] but here he comes to the greatest of all
[22:01] the
[22:02] messages what was the message Messiah is
[22:05] here
[22:07] now and to make that known he bypassed
[22:11] all the train to make it known to Humble
[22:15] Shepherds think of it all of the
[22:18] clergymen all of the churchmen all of
[22:20] the teachers all of the the theological
[22:23] training all the money had been spent
[22:26] all the churches and the doct and the
[22:29] denominations is all
[22:31] byass all the learning that they had
[22:33] spent on all the all the missionaries
[22:36] and all the priting all the membership
[22:38] and everything that they had thought
[22:40] they had done honor to God yet the key
[22:42] message of all of it was byass from
[22:45] him strange
[22:49] why and notice not only that but the
[22:53] most unlikely place for such an
[22:56] event the Shepherds now was the one who
[23:01] received the message and now notice
[23:03] where the message was in the most
[23:09] unlikely place that anyone would expect
[23:11] it to
[23:13] come and I wonder tonight if we were
[23:17] looking for the true message of the Lord
[23:20] Jesus I wonder if it would be in an
[23:22] unlikely
[23:24] group a place that was that the Great a
[23:29] high cultured world in the church today
[23:32] would think was a bunch
[23:34] of
[23:36] of oh
[23:39] Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be
[23:41] where we'd find
[23:43] him the most unlikely place and to the
[23:47] most
[23:48] unqualified
[23:50] speakers Shepherds no nothing about
[23:52] speaking only calling
[23:55] sheep but maybe that's why it comes
[24:00] but it was a promised
[24:02] word notice it could do that again it
[24:07] bypassed all the Nobles of the
[24:10] land it bypassed all the Nobles and was
[24:14] revealed to the
[24:16] nobodies all the Nobles that were
[24:19] decorated with with great doctors
[24:21] Divinity and and psychology and and
[24:25] highly uh educations and great
[24:28] Cathedrals and things it was all
[24:31] bypassed and revealed to no
[24:35] bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of
[24:38] almighty God did
[24:41] it to make known to them the greatest
[24:44] message ever was the Messiah is now on
[24:49] Earth what a wisdom could only come from
[24:53] God who knows
[24:54] wisdom all the
[24:57] wisdom and all of the schooling and
[25:00] everything was now laid to waste and
[25:02] bypassed by the great wisdom of
[25:06] God I keep repeating that because I want
[25:10] it to go down
[25:12] deep all laid the waste it was of no
[25:15] good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom
[25:19] have the right away that God takes the
[25:23] nothings to make the something
[25:29] we could stop here and speak of John we
[25:31] could stop and speak of Elijah nobody
[25:33] knows where Elijah come from all you
[25:36] know he just appeared on the scene the
[25:38] prophets back to the ages they were no
[25:41] bodies but God kep that and
[25:46] bypass the the ethics of the
[25:49] church and the teachings to make sure
[25:53] that he is God he takes something that's
[25:56] nothing to do something with it
[26:01] he shows his wisdom and his godhead by
[26:05] doing so that he takes the nothings when
[26:08] he first made a man he just took a ball
[26:10] of clay and made a man out of it where
[26:13] it was nothing but clay but he made a
[26:15] man God takes the nothing's now to do
[26:18] the something's
[26:20] with and as long as we think we're
[26:22] something and we cannot be used in the
[26:24] hand of God we must forsake all we ever
[26:27] knew or learn pardon me like the great
[26:31] St Paul he said he had to forget all he
[26:33] ever learned that he might know
[26:36] Christ all their
[26:39] schooling all their teachings and so
[26:41] forth was working out to the worst for
[26:45] them it finally denied him the very
[26:49] schooling that they had had for him to
[26:52] believe him turned around and become his
[26:55] most critical enemy and cruci
[26:59] him do you know that history repeats
[27:03] itself ever so
[27:06] often it's a noted
[27:08] fact it could happen again right by the
[27:12] side of us or you say if I live then
[27:16] well now if you want to know what you'd
[27:17] have done then look at your present
[27:19] State now and you can see what you'd
[27:22] have done then because it certainly is
[27:25] revealing
[27:29] trained to believe his word and then
[27:32] when his word was Vindicated before
[27:34] their very eyes they denied the word
[27:37] that was made
[27:39] Vindication when God proved what he
[27:41] would do and said what he would do and
[27:44] prove what he would do then they turned
[27:46] around and called this man an evil
[27:49] spirit which cursed them
[27:54] all think of what taken place
[27:58] think of what caused them their training
[28:01] caused them not to recognize the very
[28:06] word made flesh for their day the very
[28:10] training that they had in their schools
[28:13] with a very best of
[28:15] teachers and you say well we wouldn't do
[28:17] that today their teachers were far
[28:20] Supreme to ours today Superior of to our
[28:26] teachers and they failed they didn't
[28:29] have
[28:30] 996 different organizations as we have
[28:33] today they had about three and in the
[28:37] Three Bottle down to three and none of
[28:40] the three recognized
[28:43] it this goes to show that What man does
[28:46] is
