[32:37] as we have been doing for some for some
[32:40] time now. And now we just want to take a
[32:44] few prayer needs and uh before we change
[32:48] the order of the service.
[32:52] Couple of weeks back we prayed for uh
[32:54] brother
[32:56] uh Boscap in Shivak Alaska.
[33:00] His uh grandson Javas and uh he text
[33:04] this morning update
[33:08] my grandson Jva he is working with uh
[33:12] commercial future man. He is sounding
[33:16] and looking really good. Praise the
[33:19] Lord. Amen. uh he was uh going through a
[33:23] little uh kind of a depression there
[33:26] then thinking about taking his life. We
[33:29] thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[33:31] And uh we uh another prayer knee came in
[33:35] this morning
[33:37] uh
[33:39] praying for brother David Galman. They
[33:42] pulled uh more blood to check uh his
[33:46] ulcer and uh IBS and and uh current
[33:51] disease.
[33:53] I'm not sure why that uh uh everything
[33:59] been done but we are praying that
[34:00] everything is is clear. The surgeon is
[34:02] saying that they will have to remove uh
[34:06] 10 inches of his of the lower part of
[34:08] his intestine
[34:10] but want to wait for few weeks and to
[34:14] let the inflammation goes down. Also
[34:17] there is an issue uh uh uh okay to let
[34:22] the inflammation goes down that just
[34:24] another thing and uh they're looking at
[34:27] uh how they going to pay for the surgery
[34:30] and all that. So we want to just uh
[34:32] remember our brother this morning and
[34:34] then uh uh brother
[34:37] uh brother Prader called me this
[34:40] morning. Actually, this is from brother
[34:42] Walker in Liberia.
[34:45] Uh,
[34:47] and uh he's asking prayer
[34:51] uh and what the situation is. It's a
[34:53] kind of a long uh text here, but uh I
[34:58] think the government either they are
[35:00] kind of reserveying the area in where
[35:03] their church is built is on some kind of
[35:06] a dispute. So uh uh he's asking that we
[35:11] pray uh because it's it's a new uh
[35:15] building that they have just built and
[35:17] with with all that they are doing there.
[35:20] So uh he want us to just take this knee
[35:22] to the Lord in prayer this morning is
[35:25] there if there are unspoken prayer
[35:27] requests in the house of the Lord you
[35:29] can do that by an uplifted hand. Uh
[35:32] these are the few that we have. Brother

[55:10] from uh
[55:14] verse 20. Let's just read from verse 20.
[55:17] First Kings chapter 18, reading from
[55:19] verse 20. And so Ahab sent unto all the
[55:24] children of Israel, and gather the
[55:27] prophets together unto Mania.
[55:31] And Elijah came unto all the people and
[55:35] said, "How long
[55:38] have ye between two opinion?
[55:42] If the Lord be God, follow him." Amen.
[55:48] And I can say it in another way. If the
[55:50] message is truth, follow it.
[55:55] Praise the Lord. If the message of the
[55:57] hour is truth, follow it.
[56:04] If the Lord be God, follow him.
[56:08] But if B, then follow him. And the
[56:11] people answer him not a word.
[56:17] Then said Elijah unto the people, I even
[56:21] I only remain of the prophet of the the
[56:25] prophet of the Lord. and build their
[56:27] profits are 450.
[56:32] Let them therefore give us two bulocks.

[56:39] themsel and cut it and and and cut it in
[56:42] pieces and lay it on the wood and put no
[56:46] fire under it. And and I will dress the
[56:49] other bulock and lay it on the wood and
[56:51] put no fire under. and call ye on the
[56:57] the name of your God and I will go and I
[57:00] will call on the name of the Lord and
[57:04] the God that answered by fire let him be
[57:08] God and all the people answer and said
[57:13] it is well spoken
[57:16] praise the Lord let's pray together
[57:18] father we just want to ask u your
[57:21] blessing and say precious Lord come and
[57:24] help us Lord Lord, and as we try to
[57:26] bring this little thought of uh
[57:29] exitation, encouragement to your people,

[57:35] Now, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[57:39] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[57:41] seat.
[57:43] I thought that uh I I've said that we
[57:45] were I was going to have a little
[57:47] meeting after church. There was
[57:49] something that uh we we were wanting to
[57:53] to uh get from the city of Brooklyn
[57:56] Center and we have not we have not got
[57:59] it from them yet. Uh we're trying to to
[58:03] see if we can get permission to put
[58:06] something in the back here and uh
[58:09] because uh uh our uh we have uh our
[58:14] concern for the the children's Sunday
[58:17] school. Now we used uh that time just
[58:22] before the song service uh to to play uh
[58:28] uh about 25 minutes 30 minutes uh
[58:32] portion of of of a tape. We we've been
[58:35] doing that since we came back from CO
[58:38] and uh uh uh
[58:46] a way there to use for uh our other
[58:51] Sunday school for those that are able to
[58:54] come and those that are able to follow
[58:56] it online. uh were at that time place
[59:01] and uh uh
[59:05] and that those were things that I wanted
[59:07] to address. So uh since I'm not having a
[59:10] lot of lot of what uh I wanted to bring
[59:13] to you as an information uh let me not
[59:16] give you bit and pieces but that's
[59:18] that's what we wanted to talk about. We
[59:20] hope we can be able to to hear from the
[59:22] city and then uh uh decide on what we
[59:25] want to do. uh and and when we sit in
[59:29] the meeting that we can we can throw it
[59:31] before you and then uh we can decide
[59:34] what we want to do. Praise the Lord.
[59:37] Amen.
[59:39] Amen.
[59:41] Now, so this this message I want to
[59:44] preach that I entitled familiar places
[59:47] uh uh
[59:50] I actually take it as an inspiration
[59:52] from uh spiritual amines here with that
[59:55] message was played here couple of weeks
[59:57] ago and I was actually studying the
[1:00:00] message when uh when
[1:00:03] realized brother Brandham says something
[1:00:05] and then asked uh sister Annette if we
[1:00:08] could play it again And uh I know uh
[1:00:12] some uh make time to come and follow you
[1:00:15] know uh the message what is play. Uh I
[1:00:18] mean some have no idea at all and uh
[1:00:22] maybe some are not interested but uh uh
[1:00:27] I mean uh we don't have a message of our
[1:00:29] own.
[1:00:31] No, we are we are just uh echoing what
[1:00:35] the prophet of the hour has given to us.
[1:00:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:39] and uh uh and so I'm I'm actually taking
[1:00:44] uh my inspiration from there. So I will
[1:00:47] read a few quotes from that message and
[1:00:51] I'm hoping that by the grace of God
[1:00:54] you'll be able to see it. But let me let
[1:00:55] me uh uh lay a little foundation here so
[1:01:00] you can you can be able to grab uh where
[1:01:03] I will be going this morning by the help
[1:01:06] of the Lord. And uh uh couple of years
[1:01:09] back when uh uh when uh the Lord blessed
[1:01:15] Sister Kish and uh then she had she had
[1:01:18] her surgery uh that we all prayed and
[1:01:21] and want to thank the Lord for uh uh she
[1:01:25] had to do transplant uh uh surgery which
[1:01:30] was a heal surgery.
[1:01:32] I preached a message that I entitled
[1:01:35] Familiar Voices
[1:01:38] and I don't know if you can remember it,
[1:01:40] but if you can remember, it's an
[1:01:41] opportunity for me to preach it again.
[1:01:43] So, I always love that. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:47] Amen. You just wait until the people
[1:01:49] forget, then you preach it again.
[1:01:53] You know, that's a way to to kind of for
[1:01:55] remind them. But uh I spoke on uh uh
[1:01:58] familiar voices and what and what I got
[1:02:01] that inspiration from it was from the
[1:02:04] hospital. Uh there was uh a sister that
[1:02:08] was in a very very tragic accident if
[1:02:11] some of you can remember. Uh and she was
[1:02:14] over in Rochester Hospital and uh and
[1:02:18] and she was she was almost almost
[1:02:22] determined brain dead
[1:02:24] because they couldn't they couldn't I
[1:02:26] mean she fractured her body into
[1:02:30] different many different pieces
[1:02:33] and uh and we were visiting my wife and
[1:02:35] myself and uh uh and you know and uh the
[1:02:41] nurse was was talking to her because her
[1:02:43] her sister met us and said they they you
[1:02:46] know they say they are not communicating
[1:02:48] with her brain and uh so they want to
[1:02:52] pull the plug and she said no I don't
[1:02:54] want them to do it I want her to you
[1:02:56] know pass on her own so we sat there and
[1:02:59] we talked and then the nurse came and
[1:03:01] you know and explained some few things
[1:03:03] to us that if they can just if they can
[1:03:06] just you know uh communicate with her
[1:03:09] brain then they can be they can know
[1:03:11] what to do you so they can know where
[1:03:13] the pains are and and different things
[1:03:15] and they will know what to do. So then
[1:03:18] we went in the room and uh and we and we
[1:03:21] were going to pray for her and uh uh you
[1:03:26] know and we prayed and then my wife
[1:03:29] started rubbing her hands you know and
[1:03:32] started saying uh uh uh Naomi
[1:03:37] uh I'm the one you know aren
[1:03:40] sister you know rubbing her hands and
[1:03:42] just say calling her name and uh and uh
[1:03:46] and then the nurse came in the room and
[1:03:49] after the time of the surgery that will
[1:03:51] be the first time that you know she she
[1:03:56] just did her hair like this you know she
[1:03:59] did her hair like this and then and then
[1:04:02] the the nurse said that she says she
[1:04:06] says oh my she says that's a good sign
[1:04:09] and she said she's hearing your voice
[1:04:14] but from a far place Okay.
[1:04:18] So, she's hearing a familiar voice but
[1:04:22] from a far place because she's
[1:04:25] unconscious,
[1:04:27] you know, but because of her her, you
[1:04:29] know, her her name was called and you
[1:04:33] know and and and you know and and she
[1:04:35] started saying some things to her and
[1:04:37] she wiggled her head. Now, the second
[1:04:39] time I will witness that was after
[1:04:41] Sister K. Sre uh Sister Kelly, my wife
[1:04:46] was in the room also. I mean, we were
[1:04:47] mainly there and uh and and you know,
[1:04:50] they were doing the same thing, you
[1:04:51] know, massaging her feet, rubbing her
[1:04:53] hands, you know, and calling her. That
[1:04:55] one I took a video of it. Uh I think I I
[1:04:58] still have it if if my phone is still
[1:05:00] good. And uh uh yeah, and and then when
[1:05:04] they were calling her name and rubbing
[1:05:06] her hand, you could see her just just
[1:05:08] turning her head all over the place. And
[1:05:11] you know I mean and I mean she couldn't
[1:05:14] identify anything but yet she could hear
[1:05:18] familiar voices.
[1:05:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:24] So when Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:05:26] voice is because his voice is familiar.
[1:05:32] Are we together? Because his voice is
[1:05:36] familiar. And you see these are the
[1:05:39] things that medical science has broke
[1:05:42] into
[1:05:44] and they are having
[1:05:46] so much result.
[1:05:50] Praise the Lord. Amen. We are running
[1:05:53] away from familiar voices. I mean people
[1:05:56] get issues with their family. You know
[1:05:58] they don't want to talk to anybody from
[1:06:00] their from their home. They don't want
[1:06:02] to talk to anybody of their siblings and
[1:06:04] and all of those things. But yet science
[1:06:07] is breaking into these things.
[1:06:11] Praise the Lord. Amen. When a person
[1:06:14] have a a terminal disease
[1:06:18] and science has determined that this
[1:06:21] person is going to die in 6 months or 3
[1:06:26] months,
[1:06:28] medical science will recommend that you
[1:06:32] take this person
[1:06:34] to
[1:06:36] familiar places.
[1:06:40] If they love the beach, take them to the
[1:06:43] beach. If they love h mountains, take
[1:06:47] them to the mountains. I mean, they they
[1:06:49] want to go to Disneyland, you know, just
[1:06:51] just take them to places that they have
[1:06:55] desired to go or places that they love
[1:06:59] to go. There's a reason.
[1:07:04] There's a reason.
[1:07:06] And so this morning
[1:07:10] uh
[1:07:11] I want to talk on
[1:07:15] uh familiar places.
[1:07:19] Like I said my inspiration is from that
[1:07:22] message
[1:07:24] spiritual harmonies here. And when and
[1:07:26] when brother Brandon preached the
[1:07:27] message I will give you I give you so
[1:07:30] much desire make you so tested to go and
[1:07:33] and listen to it. when he preached the
[1:07:36] message, he came out with a diagnostic.
[1:07:41] If you're right there, when he started
[1:07:43] the message, he came out with a
[1:07:44] diagnostic. And the diagnostic was he
[1:07:49] read from Amos chapter 3.
[1:07:52] And after reading from Amos chapter 3,
[1:07:56] he talks about how Israel was
[1:07:58] prospering.
[1:08:01] They were prospering and they have soon
[1:08:04] forgot
[1:08:08] because of their state of prosperity.
[1:08:12] They have they have gone into a shock
[1:08:16] because that's what causes
[1:08:20] armia is it's a shock.
[1:08:24] So they have gone into a shock coming
[1:08:27] from out of Babylon.
[1:08:30] Now they have gone into a time of
[1:08:32] prosperity.
[1:08:34] So because they have they they they had
[1:08:37] they have come into this place of shock.
[1:08:39] It had make them to start getting away
[1:08:43] from the Lord. Disregarding God's word
[1:08:47] and they were no longer caring anymore
[1:08:49] for the Lord of God, the things of God,
[1:08:52] the house of God. They were not caring
[1:08:54] for it anymore. and everybody was
[1:08:56] building their own idol and and and you
[1:08:58] know and building their own thing. So he
[1:09:01] he that that was the diagnostic that he
[1:09:04] came up with and said Israel at that
[1:09:07] time was in this condition of spiritual
[1:09:12] armia.
[1:09:14] Are we together?
[1:09:16] And he brought the church to the same
[1:09:19] place.
[1:09:21] He brought the nation America to the
[1:09:24] same place.
[1:09:27] Are we together? Amen.
[1:09:30] Now,
[1:09:32] so as he as he talks on the diagnostic,
[1:09:39] as he talks on the diagnostic and and
[1:09:41] what the people are doing, he read he he
[1:09:43] he quoted a scripture from Jeremiah
[1:09:46] where God told Israel, "I found you like
[1:09:49] a young woman under the tree that was in
[1:09:51] her own blood because she was abused by
[1:09:54] the idolatry and I took you unto myself.
[1:09:57] I clean you up.
[1:10:01] He says, "Now you have forgotten me and
[1:10:05] you are committing wom on every green
[1:10:07] tree."
[1:10:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:12] One will put a person in their state.
[1:10:20] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:25] And uh uh you would think they at the at
[1:10:28] at a at a time of prosperity these
[1:10:31] people will will rebuild the house of
[1:10:34] God. They will rebuild their commitment
[1:10:36] to God. But you see coming from honor
[1:10:40] slavery and coming from under the stress
[1:10:43] of what to eat the stress of how
[1:10:46] tomorrow will be or I don't know if I
[1:10:49] will live to see tomorrow. Just coming
[1:10:52] out of that can put you in another shock
[1:10:58] that it's so soon that you can forget
[1:11:03] of all that the Lord has done for you
[1:11:07] and pretty soon you start claiming
[1:11:09] everything that they are the works of
[1:11:12] your hands.
[1:11:17] Praise the Lord. He talks about family
[1:11:20] life. We love our family. We love our
[1:11:22] wife, our children. He said, "What will
[1:11:24] make a man
[1:11:27] to leave his home?"
[1:11:29] He says, "It is this condition." He goes
[1:11:32] into a shock.
[1:11:38] Are we together?
[1:11:41] It's a It's an age situation. Revelation
[1:11:44] chapter 3. Uh h
[1:11:47] uh the loudish is she's found in that
[1:11:50] condition.
[1:11:53] She's rich, but yes, she's miserable.
[1:11:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:00] Two things that that must not go
[1:12:02] together, but yet is going together in
[1:12:04] our age. She's rich, but yet she's
[1:12:07] miserable.
[1:12:09] So as he talks about this, he goes on,
[1:12:13] he talks about family life, he talks
[1:12:16] about the church, he talks about Israel,
[1:12:18] and and as he goes alone into into his
[1:12:22] message. Now this this is the beautiful
[1:12:25] thing that I mean when uh when the Lord
[1:12:28] helped me to see it, I I just cry like a
[1:12:31] baby. I cry like a baby because I've
[1:12:35] read it. I read it. I read it many times
[1:12:37] and never saw it. At the end of the
[1:12:40] message,
[1:12:42] he will give us a story about a French
[1:12:46] soldier. If you remember,
[1:12:50] they were coming from war and all of
[1:12:52] these soldiers were wounded. They had
[1:12:55] dared with lot of things during the war.
[1:12:59] You know, he he he let us know that
[1:13:01] sometime war will put a person in their
[1:13:04] condition.
[1:13:06] Are we together?
[1:13:09] Now he says here now this this aminos
[1:13:13] here we are told uh uh it is cause it
[1:13:18] cause you to be in a place where you
[1:13:20] cannot identify yourself. Now it is it
[1:13:24] is it is unusual thing. It don't happen
[1:13:29] too often but the cause is from shock.
[1:13:34] It's some uh uh uh it's somebody that
[1:13:37] don't even know who they are.
[1:13:40] You find it from war. Sometimes
[1:13:44] soldiers, sometimes people getting it.
[1:13:47] You know another thing that cause it is
[1:13:49] worry. When people worry,
[1:13:53] they they they you you it's so easy for
[1:13:56] you to go into a shock
[1:13:59] that uh you don't even remember
[1:14:02] that God woke you up this morning.
[1:14:07] Praise the Lord. If he did not had a
[1:14:10] plan for you, you will be lying dead. If
[1:14:12] he gave you grace to see another day, he
[1:14:15] has a purpose for your life. Amen.
[1:14:19] If alarm can wake us up, let's carry in
[1:14:21] the graveyard.
[1:14:24] Are we together?
[1:14:26] Amen. So he he's letting us know when
[1:14:29] people get into a state of worry, it
[1:14:32] send them into a shock
[1:14:36] that they are not able to remember that
[1:14:39] one time in your life you went through a
[1:14:41] bad period and you came out of it. So if
[1:14:44] you are in a bad period now, you will
[1:14:47] stay calm out of it.
[1:14:51] But because you go into a shock, all of
[1:14:55] those things does not matter. Now what
[1:14:57] matter is this thing on my on my list or
[1:15:00] this thing right before me? How am I
[1:15:02] going to do it? How what what going to
[1:15:04] happen? And and God, if you are God, you
[1:15:06] know God and God and and right there now
[1:15:09] you want to make God.
[1:15:12] He was existing before you existing
[1:15:15] before your problem.
[1:15:20] But what is happening is that you have
[1:15:22] gone into a mental shock
[1:15:27] now. So he comes to the end of the the
[1:15:30] the the message as he's preaching and he
[1:15:33] tells this story. He tells this story
[1:15:36] about this French sodium
[1:15:38] and uh uh they came from war and I mean
[1:15:41] all the guys have you know they are
[1:15:43] smoking they are uh trying to smoke all
[1:15:46] the horrible things they see in the
[1:15:48] world and you know and and everything
[1:15:50] they are doing they are singing they are
[1:15:51] telling old stories and all of that. As
[1:15:53] they were driving and uh uh you know uh
[1:15:56] uh uh uh on the train, they came to a
[1:16:00] stop and uh and every one of them were
[1:16:03] given uh the liberty to go down and and
[1:16:06] take a cigarette and smoke and you know
[1:16:08] use the bathroom or just get a fresh
[1:16:10] air. Just go down get a fresh air. You
[1:16:13] know there is no misaging. There is no
[1:16:15] shooting nothing. Just get a fresh air.
[1:16:19] And this young French soldier when he
[1:16:21] got down from the train,
[1:16:25] he looks up
[1:16:27] looking at the trees, looking all around
[1:16:30] and he saw a towel.
[1:16:34] When he saw the tower, something kicks
[1:16:37] in.
[1:16:40] He started leaving his friends and
[1:16:42] started going towards the tower.
[1:16:47] And as he go as he was going they were
[1:16:50] yelling his name and the general said no
[1:16:52] leave him.
[1:16:55] Okay? Because I mean these guys they
[1:16:57] they are they they are they mess up in
[1:17:00] their in their mind. Leave him. So he
[1:17:02] started going. So he assigned to two uh
[1:17:06] some some soldiers to just go along with
[1:17:07] him. you know, he he started going and
[1:17:10] going towards the tower and you know,
[1:17:12] and he found a trail and and as he went
[1:17:14] down,
[1:17:17] he got down to a little village
[1:17:22] and he went to a certain house
[1:17:28] and out of that house came a setting
[1:17:30] man.
[1:17:34] And the man said, "Oh my son,
[1:17:37] you told me you were dead.
[1:17:40] I'm glad
[1:17:42] you have come home."
[1:17:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:50] So
[1:17:52] he got his healing
[1:17:57] out of
[1:17:59] this state of uh uh uh amini and and and
[1:18:04] uh depression and all the horrible
[1:18:06] things on his mind
[1:18:09] by going to a familiar place.
[1:18:17] As he got down from the tree, something
[1:18:20] came familiar.
[1:18:22] And that thing was enough to restore his
[1:18:26] consciousness.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:31] Are we together?
[1:18:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:37] Oh, I hope that a preacher was here to
[1:18:39] really preach this. I hope that a
[1:18:42] preacher was here to really preach this
[1:18:44] and dre this in you. Amen. Praise the
[1:18:47] Lord. And I and and and that is the
[1:18:50] reason why
[1:18:52] God sent us a message.
[1:18:56] Amen.
[1:18:58] That is the reason why
[1:19:01] this is called the good news. Is the the
[1:19:03] the the preaching of the gospel
[1:19:08] because
[1:19:11] the word has been sent. The book has
[1:19:13] been opened. The seals is revealed to
[1:19:17] bring us
[1:19:19] to familiar places.
[1:19:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. To
[1:19:28] bring us to familiar places.
[1:19:31] And that's where we want to start from
[1:19:33] this morning.
[1:19:35] That's where we want to start from this
[1:19:37] morning. Let's look in the scripture a
[1:19:40] little bit. Let's run through our Bible
[1:19:43] a little bit and and uh and and and see
[1:19:46] some things. Gen Genesis chapter uh uh
[1:19:49] 25.
[1:19:52] Praise the Lord. Genesis chapter 25.
[1:19:57] The Bible will speak about Abraham.
[1:20:00] Uh I'm I'm just going to read that
[1:20:02] quickly. If you want to write it down,
[1:20:04] you can write it down. And Abraham gave
[1:20:06] up the ghost, and he died in a good old
[1:20:10] age, an old man, and four of years, and
[1:20:15] was gathered to his people. Praise the
[1:20:18] Lord. Genesis chapter 25:17,
[1:20:22] the Bible will speaks about uh and and
[1:20:24] these are the years of Ishmael 100, and
[1:20:28] he gave up the ghost. Ishmael died and
[1:20:30] was gathered unto his people. Genesis
[1:20:33] chapter 35 verse uh uh uh 29. And Isaac
[1:20:37] gave up the ghost and he died and he was
[1:20:39] gathered unto his people.
[1:20:42] Genesis 40 49:29. And he charged him and
[1:20:46] said unto them, I am to be gathered unto
[1:20:50] my people. That was Jacob. Bury me with
[1:20:54] my fathers in the cave. That uh that is
[1:20:57] the field of Aaron the Hittites.
[1:21:02] Now, so you go through all of these and
[1:21:06] uh uh you know, you go through all of
[1:21:08] these uh uh I think uh yeah, I think
[1:21:12] that you go through all of these. It
[1:21:15] tells us that when when these patriots
[1:21:18] die, they will gather onto their people.
[1:21:21] there. So uh uh uh this this also brings
[1:21:25] brings a rear to us that uh uh uh
[1:21:31] uh when when when we leave when you were
[1:21:34] when you you remember brother Brandham
[1:21:35] experience behind the curtain of time
[1:21:38] okay
[1:21:40] all of the people that's why he said are
[1:21:42] these all brandams he said no these are
[1:21:44] all your convines so all of the people
[1:21:47] when we leave here
[1:21:50] we don't us to meet Abraham and Isaac.
[1:21:55] No, we meet familiar people.
[1:22:00] Praise the Lord. We meet familiar
[1:22:03] people. That's what brother Bram says at
[1:22:06] at I mean uh uh the time of the rapture.
[1:22:09] If the dead saints comes back to life,
[1:22:12] you know, it's not somebody that was in
[1:22:14] brand of tabernacle that would come
[1:22:15] here. We would not know them. It was it
[1:22:18] would be somebody that was part of this
[1:22:20] assembly. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:24] That will show up in church and as soon
[1:22:26] as we see them, we be gone. We know that
[1:22:30] something has happened. So, so are you
[1:22:33] grapping the concept of familiar?
[1:22:36] Amen. Are you graping the concept? So
[1:22:39] when we leave we we we are assembled
[1:22:43] with the people
[1:22:46] familiar people the people we serve the
[1:22:48] law with.
[1:22:51] Amen.
[1:22:54] So you see the reason why we have to be
[1:22:56] nice to one another.
[1:22:59] Amen. You can be in a church and just be
[1:23:02] a stranger.
[1:23:06] We have to uh uh uh uh uh you know be
[1:23:10] familiar with one another.
[1:23:16] Are you seeing the picture?
[1:23:22] I I just look at this quickly before I
[1:23:24] came out of the office. Uh something
[1:23:27] came to my mind. Let's let's look at
[1:23:28] Genesis chapter 50. I I just want to to
[1:23:31] build a little bit and then we will get
[1:23:33] into what we want to talk about this
[1:23:34] morning. I' I've already started
[1:23:35] preaching though. So,
[1:23:40] Genesis chapter 50.
[1:23:51] When you read Genesis chapter 50,
[1:23:59] when you read Genesis chapter 50,
[1:24:01] reading from verse 6, and Pharaoh said,
[1:24:03] he's speaking to Joseph, go up and bury
[1:24:05] thy father. I called him as he made
[1:24:08] these sword. and Joseph went up to bury
[1:24:11] his father. And uh and with him went up
[1:24:16] all the servants of uh Pharaoh, and and
[1:24:19] uh the the the elders of of his house,
[1:24:22] and and all the elders of the land, and
[1:24:24] all the house of Joseph, his brethrens,
[1:24:27] and his father house, only their little
[1:24:30] ones, and their flocks, and their herbs
[1:24:34] they left in the land of Gan.
[1:24:38] Does this sound familiar to you?
[1:24:43] Does this sound familiar? This whole
[1:24:45] thing we reading, does this sound
[1:24:46] familiar to you? Praise the Lord. Let me
[1:24:50] remind you because we are in familiar
[1:24:52] places. So, let me remind you now. Do
[1:24:56] you remember
[1:24:58] that Pharaoh requested this? Leave the
[1:25:03] little ones.
[1:25:06] and and your herbs, go up and worship
[1:25:10] and come back.
[1:25:13] Do you remember that? Amen. Now, so at
[1:25:18] at the at the at the barrier of Joseph,
[1:25:23] Israel is going to travel a familiar
[1:25:26] path.
[1:25:28] Read the rest of the chapter.
[1:25:31] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:33] They are going to bury Jacob in the
[1:25:36] promised land.
[1:25:38] They are going to travel a familiar
[1:25:40] path.
[1:25:44] I'll just I thinking about that this
[1:25:46] morning and I quickly just look at that
[1:25:49] just before I came came out of the
[1:25:51] office. Now, so uh uh this is this is
[1:25:55] what I want to bring us this morning.
[1:25:57] This is what I want to bring us. Now,
[1:26:00] here is Elijah. Let's come to our text.
[1:26:03] We'll get back there again and there is
[1:26:05] more for us to read. But here is Elijah.
[1:26:09] This uh this man of Tishbar, this uh
[1:26:11] this this prophet of God coming on the
[1:26:13] scene. We don't even know uh uh anything
[1:26:16] about his upbringing, his uh his parents
[1:26:18] and nothing like that. He's just show up
[1:26:21] on the scene and he's having the word of
[1:26:23] the Lord and condemning the idolatry
[1:26:26] that is done in in Israel.
[1:26:31] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:35] And he announced himself
[1:26:37] by calling judgment on the land. There
[1:26:40] will not be a deal or rain until I
[1:26:44] Elijah call for it.
[1:26:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:52] Immediately the heavens was closed.
[1:26:56] There was a drought. There was farming
[1:26:57] in the land.
[1:27:02] Three and a half years.
[1:27:06] Are we together?
[1:27:09] And the people
[1:27:12] the people
[1:27:19] don't have food. They have they're going
[1:27:21] up to to Ahab. They, you know, they're
[1:27:23] making noise. I mean, everybody use up
[1:27:25] their reserve and everything. And then
[1:27:27] and and and Y said that Ahab has sent
[1:27:31] soldiers all over the place to look for
[1:27:33] Elijah. We know the rest of the story.
[1:27:35] They met him on the mountain. He called
[1:27:37] fire down on this one. Call fire down on
[1:27:39] that one. Call fire down on the other
[1:27:41] one. Are we together?
[1:27:44] until this young uh uh Jewish boy met
[1:27:47] him and said, "No, don't don't do it.
[1:27:48] Don't do it. I mean that if if I go and
[1:27:51] tell them now that I have seen you, he's
[1:27:53] going to kill me."
[1:27:56] He said, "Go and tell Ahab."
[1:27:59] Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[1:28:02] Now, so we see all of this. We see all
[1:28:05] of this. I'm trying to to uh uh put uh
[1:28:08] some context to this so you can be able
[1:28:10] to grab the picture here. and uh uh and
[1:28:14] and and yeah, he will meet Ahab
[1:28:18] and Ahab will call him to this showdown.
[1:28:22] Let's gather all the people.
[1:28:26] Call him to the showdown and he will uh
[1:28:29] come up there to the mountain
[1:28:32] and he will be the one to give them an
[1:28:34] instruction.
[1:28:38] Well, let's let's uh let's let's ask
[1:28:41] God. You ask your God to vindicate your
[1:28:43] message.
[1:28:45] I'm I'm going to ask the God of Israel
[1:28:48] to vindicate my message.
[1:28:52] Are we together?
[1:28:55] Praise the Lord. So you take a bullock.
[1:28:58] I will take mine and and and and you can
[1:29:00] you can cut your into pieces. Put it put
[1:29:03] it on uh whatever way you want to do it.
[1:29:05] I will cut mine and do the same thing on
[1:29:07] the other side. and uh and and the God
[1:29:10] that answer by fire, let him be God.
[1:29:15] Praise the Lord. As we are talking this,
[1:29:18] I want you to keep that in your mind
[1:29:21] because you see the thing about it there
[1:29:23] is there are the uh uh let me let me ask
[1:29:26] you a question.
[1:29:30] Have you have you ever been broken in
[1:29:33] your spirit
[1:29:35] where you are broken and you are feeling
[1:29:38] a desperation for God? You are feeling a
[1:29:41] need of the Lord and it looks like he's
[1:29:43] needing you. I mean h you you are
[1:29:45] needing him and you are you are placing
[1:29:48] things around in the hands of the Lord.
[1:29:52] Have you ever had a time where God take
[1:29:55] you to familiar places in your mind?
[1:29:59] Where he takes you to places and say
[1:30:02] remember I did this for you. Remember I
[1:30:06] did this for you. You see what it does
[1:30:08] is that the a a a uh h it create faith.
[1:30:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:17] Because you know whether whether people
[1:30:19] believe it or not you were there. You
[1:30:21] know what happened.
[1:30:24] You know that that was God. Nothing but
[1:30:26] God.
[1:30:29] Amen. Praise the Lord. Sometimes we want
[1:30:32] to say it and make people to believe it.
[1:30:34] But if people don't believe it, don't
[1:30:36] don't don't doubt your own testimony if
[1:30:39] people don't believe it.
[1:30:42] Are we together?
[1:30:45] Look at look at brother Brandham gift of
[1:30:48] discernment. never seen before
[1:30:51] everything that we have all of these uh
[1:30:53] people know there is somebody here with

[1:31:05] know and and maybe we have my wife said
[1:31:07] been feeding headache for one week now
[1:31:08] so you will have two three person that

[1:31:14] will give such a gift in confirmation to
[1:31:17] his word he said The son of
[1:31:19] righteousness will rise with healing in
[1:31:21] his ways. Amen. That's Malachi 4:1.
[1:31:27] That was the fulfillment of that
[1:31:29] scripture. Amen.
[1:31:33] That was the ministry that raised up
[1:31:35] over a Allen and all of these men. Tommy
[1:31:39] Osborne were down in Portland when he
[1:31:42] saw that minia coming there to challenge
[1:31:45] brother Brandham and he fell right
[1:31:47] there. That man fell right there on
[1:31:48] brother brand feet. Tommy husband and
[1:31:50] his wife were sitting right in the in uh
[1:31:53] in in the audience.
[1:31:56] Now but this is what I want to say to
[1:31:58] you with all these noise I have made.
[1:32:02] Brother Brandham gave of discernment.
[1:32:04] What what what did the Lord do to raise
[1:32:09] the faith of the people? Amen. He goes
[1:32:12] back in their life. Amen. Amen. Honor
[1:32:17] discernment. I see you as a little boy.
[1:32:22] Praise the Lord. The congressman Tommy,
[1:32:26] I mean uh uh uh uh William Offer,
[1:32:31] he was sick for 60 plus years. Fell down
[1:32:34] from on on on
[1:32:37] on the hear on the h as a little boy.
[1:32:40] Broke his back.
[1:32:45] He will go back with that gift. God will
[1:32:48] take him back in the life of the people.
[1:32:53] William was sitting there in the in the
[1:32:55] service and brother Brandon says, "I see
[1:32:57] a little boy falling from off
[1:33:01] and he broke his back."
[1:33:05] We had our brother, brother uh forest
[1:33:08] farmer that preached for us years and
[1:33:11] and I'm hoping to get him back tell us a
[1:33:14] story right here in Chicago. He was
[1:33:15] there with his father as a little boy
[1:33:18] wearing brace on his foot and brother
[1:33:20] Brandon will call back there and says,
[1:33:21] "Mr. Farmer, your son is wearing brace.
[1:33:24] Take that brace off his foot now." So
[1:33:27] that gift will go back in an individual
[1:33:30] life to a familiar place.
[1:33:35] that you know that it is only God that
[1:33:39] can tell this man. So what does it does
[1:33:43] when that gift goes back? It raises your
[1:33:46] faith that if God can go back 10 years
[1:33:49] in my life, he know where I am now. He
[1:33:52] know what I'm going through.
[1:33:56] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So
[1:34:01] the discernment was to raise the faith
[1:34:03] of the people.
[1:34:06] It's your faith that heals you. It's not
[1:34:09] the discernment. The discernment was to
[1:34:12] raise the faith of the people. Amen.
[1:34:15] By taking them back to familiar places.
[1:34:23] Praise the Lord. Oh, let God take you to
[1:34:26] a familiar place one time in your life.
[1:34:29] Your life will change. Amen. Let it take
[1:34:32] you to Calvary one time. Thank you,
[1:34:35] Lord. Your life will never be the same.
[1:34:38] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We want to
[1:34:42] go to to new churches. We want to go to
[1:34:45] new city. Where we need to go is
[1:34:48] familiar places.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:52] Oh, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:34:56] Hallelujah. Amen. You love the Lord this
[1:34:59] morning. I sure you do. Amen. Glory be
[1:35:03] to God because I'm feeling fine.
[1:35:06] Amen. I'm feeling fine. Thank you,
[1:35:09] Jesus. I was just out of strength this
[1:35:11] morning. Amen.
[1:35:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:35:19] Now, so here is Elijah
[1:35:23] standing on my candle and giving these
[1:35:24] people the option to be the first to go
[1:35:27] ahead and and and build their altar and
[1:35:30] call on by and call on. He said maybe
[1:35:33] he's sleeping.
[1:35:39] Praise the Lord. The God that answer by
[1:35:42] fire, let him be God. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:47] Are we together?
[1:35:49] Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] And you see these familiar places in
[1:35:53] your life,
[1:35:56] they are memorial.
[1:36:00] Praise the Lord. That's why you see most
[1:36:03] familiar places, they always build a
[1:36:06] monument there.
[1:36:08] So when people come back, they can
[1:36:10] remember what happened here.
[1:36:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:18] Amen. Amen. So they can remember
[1:36:22] Solomon says, "Don't take away the Asian
[1:36:24] landmark
[1:36:27] because those landmarks are a memorial."
[1:36:33] Elijah brings the people
[1:36:36] and then he says to them,
[1:36:42] "Bill,
[1:36:45] build your altar.
[1:36:48] I will build mine." The people went
[1:36:50] ahead building their altar, calling and
[1:36:53] shouting and and the noise that were on
[1:36:56] the mountain. 400 men
[1:36:59] yelling
[1:37:02] by whichever way they are calling him.
[1:37:07] 400 men. It was noisy.
[1:37:15] Are we together?
[1:37:17] And Elijah waited and then he waited
[1:37:22] and then he waited.
[1:37:24] Let's go back to first king chapter.
[1:37:27] There are some few things I want to read
[1:37:28] to you here, but I got to get I got to I
[1:37:30] got to lay a good foundation with this.
[1:37:32] Amen. Then the preachers will come in
[1:37:35] and take it from there. First King
[1:37:38] chapter 18.
[1:37:40] First King chapter 18.
[1:37:47] First King chapter 18.
[1:37:51] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] Let the God that answer by fire, let him
[1:38:00] be God. Amen.
[1:38:05] So when uh uh Elijah got these people on
[1:38:08] this mountain, we read a little bit of
[1:38:11] that
[1:38:15] uh
[1:38:27] Let's look at verse uh 29. Let's look
[1:38:31] down to verse 29 a little bit.
[1:38:36] And it came to pass
[1:38:39] when midday was passed
[1:38:42] and they prophesied until the time of
[1:38:47] the time of the of the sacrifice
[1:38:51] of the uh the the time of the offering
[1:38:53] of the evening sacrifice
[1:38:56] that there was neither of voice
[1:38:59] none any to answer none any to regard.
[1:39:04] And Elijah said unto all the people,
[1:39:07] "Come near unto me." And all the people
[1:39:13] came near unto him, and he repaired
[1:39:18] the altar of the Lord that was broken.
[1:39:24] When was it broken? Where was it broken?
[1:39:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:34] Let's look at the the the the reparation
[1:39:37] and then uh we will have an idea. Thank
[1:39:40] you, brother Dan. Thank you. Appreciate
[1:39:42] it. Let's let's look at that and then we
[1:39:44] will we will have uh let's read down a
[1:39:48] little bit here.
[1:39:50] Man, I'm glad to be inside. It's hot out
[1:39:52] there. Yeah, it was it was uh roasting
[1:39:56] out there yesterday.
[1:39:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:03] Are we together? Amen.
[1:40:08] The Bible says, "And he repaired the
[1:40:10] altar of the Lord. I was broken down."
[1:40:14] Verse 31, "And Elijah took 12 stones. I
[1:40:18] call into I I call into the number of
[1:40:22] the tribe of the sons of Jacob,
[1:40:27] unto whom the word of the Lord came,
[1:40:30] saying, Israel shall be thy name. And
[1:40:34] with the stone he built an altar in the
[1:40:37] name of the Lord. And he ma and and he
[1:40:40] made a trench about the altar
[1:40:44] as great as will uh contain two measures
[1:40:49] of seed. Praise the Lord. Now the Bible
[1:40:52] says he's repairing
[1:40:57] the altar that was broken down. Are we
[1:41:00] together?
[1:41:02] So what I want us to do is that in
[1:41:07] repairing the altar that was broken
[1:41:10] down,
[1:41:11] Elijah is trying to bring these people
[1:41:14] to a familiar place. He had to do
[1:41:17] something to remind him. Now remember
[1:41:21] now the people have gone into a shock.
[1:41:25] There was mismarages taking place. Ahab
[1:41:28] the king, he has gone down and married,
[1:41:31] you know, the daughter of that other uh
[1:41:34] uh uh uh goddess and and and h uh he
[1:41:37] married the daughter. So I mean uh the
[1:41:40] all of these things were happening. The
[1:41:41] people they were so they were so messed
[1:41:44] up in their spirit they don't even know.
[1:41:46] And even the the teachings of of of of B
[1:41:50] was so was so prominent in that day. Are
[1:41:54] we together?
[1:41:57] until everybody had an idol in their
[1:41:59] house.
[1:42:04] Are we together
[1:42:06] now? So Elijah
[1:42:09] is trying to bring these people trying
[1:42:12] to grab their mind. He's trying to do
[1:42:15] something.
[1:42:18] And the Bible says when the evening the
[1:42:20] the the the time of the evening
[1:42:22] sacrifice, he got on the mountain
[1:42:25] and he started to repair the altar that
[1:42:29] was broken down.
[1:42:31] Are we together?
[1:42:33] Let's go to Joshua chapter 4.
[1:42:36] We might not have a lot of the time to
[1:42:38] read, but let me let me just because I I
[1:42:40] do too much reading here and then I I
[1:42:42] lose my time.
[1:42:44] When you read, you will remember this
[1:42:46] was the time where Israel must go
[1:42:48] through the Jordan.
[1:42:52] And as they are going through the
[1:42:53] Jordan, Joshua instructed that the
[1:42:56] Levites go ahead of them, stand in the
[1:43:00] middle.
[1:43:02] Are we together? And the Jordan
[1:43:05] imparted.
[1:43:08] Are we together? Amen. Joshua will
[1:43:11] command the people that they should take
[1:43:14] 12 stones from under the Jordan River.
[1:43:18] They should go out and build a mon.
[1:43:23] Each tribe should take a stone
[1:43:26] and go and build 12 stones. They must
[1:43:30] build it. They must take 12 stones from
[1:43:32] the land and bring it back in the Jordan
[1:43:37] and put it together.
[1:43:39] Praise the Lord. Are we together? Amen.
[1:43:43] And set it up.
[1:43:45] He says, "Put this together and let it
[1:43:48] be a memorial
[1:43:50] that in many days to come when you are
[1:43:54] telling this story to your children, you
[1:43:57] can point and say, you see those rocks,
[1:44:01] it was not like that.
[1:44:03] We were the one that gather it."
[1:44:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:08] If the Jordan fill its banks and you
[1:44:12] can't see the rock, bring them to this
[1:44:14] one out here and show it to them.
[1:44:18] That became a memorial.
[1:44:21] And a memorial is an altar.
[1:44:26] Whenever God build a memorial in your
[1:44:29] life is an altar. That's the reason why
[1:44:32] he always take you back to that place
[1:44:35] and say remember what I have done for
[1:44:38] you
[1:44:42] amen.
[1:44:46] Are we together? Are you seeing the
[1:44:48] picture?
[1:44:52] Amen. Amen. Because what
[1:44:57] Elijah did, God is going to use the
[1:45:01] anointing, the spirit of Elijah to do
[1:45:04] the same thing,
[1:45:07] to rebuild the altar of the Lord to
[1:45:11] bring the people back to familiar
[1:45:13] places.
[1:45:15] Amen.
[1:45:18] Are we together? Amen. And until you get
[1:45:22] to familiar places that you can remember
[1:45:25] where the Lord took you from, you
[1:45:29] you you will keep dealing with spiritual
[1:45:31] harmonia because one day you are safe,
[1:45:33] the next day you are not. You're going
[1:45:36] in the rapture and you don't even know
[1:45:37] where you going.
[1:45:41] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. That's what
[1:45:45] all of this kind of a undecisive
[1:45:48] behavior is among the people. They want
[1:45:51] to find comfort in in in in sitting in
[1:45:54] church, but they will not get involved
[1:45:56] in uh in in in in in something for the
[1:45:59] Lord.
[1:46:01] They will not get involved in something.
[1:46:03] I was talking to a a good friend of mine
[1:46:05] uh uh a couple of weeks ago and and we
[1:46:08] were talking and I was just I was trying
[1:46:09] to fish fish on him a little bit and you
[1:46:12] know and I I I just told him you know
[1:46:14] yeah my my uh my friend I I I'll have to
[1:46:17] you know pick you up one of these days
[1:46:18] you know so we can we can get back on
[1:46:20] the field and do he just you know I'm
[1:46:22] I'm not a minister. I said well he gave
[1:46:26] me the right thing to shoot him all over
[1:46:28] the legs this morning. You don't have to
[1:46:30] be a minister to do something for God.
[1:46:32] Amen.
[1:46:35] You don't have to be a minister.
[1:46:38] This is not just a a a kind of a
[1:46:41] showcase work. Wear neck tied. Put a
[1:46:44] bunch of coats together.
[1:46:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:50] Jesus said, "Let men see your good work
[1:46:55] and glorify your father in heaven."
[1:46:59] Let your neighbors see your good work.
[1:47:01] that your work may see your good work.
[1:47:03] Let him hear about what God has done for
[1:47:05] you.
[1:47:08] Amen.
[1:47:12] John Wesley said, "The sky is my pit.
[1:47:17] Wherever I find myself honor the
[1:47:19] heavens, I will declare the goodness of
[1:47:22] God."
[1:47:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:29] Amen.
[1:47:34] We have to bring uh good shepherd to
[1:47:37] familiar places.
[1:47:39] We got to bring you back to familiar
[1:47:41] places. Amen.
[1:47:44] For us to be thankful for where God has
[1:47:46] brought us from.
[1:47:48] And don't and don't get a feeling that
[1:47:51] we have arrived. Yeah,
[1:47:55] that's where your backsliding starts
[1:47:59] because a a shock will enter
[1:48:02] the changes in your life and the
[1:48:05] different things you will be dealing
[1:48:06] with. It's easy to throw you into a
[1:48:08] shock. It's an unconscious thing.
[1:48:11] It's an it's an unconscious thing. You
[1:48:13] enter right in there and before you
[1:48:16] realize, you don't know how to trace
[1:48:18] your step back on your knees.
[1:48:20] You don't know how to trace your step
[1:48:21] back to take your Bible and read because
[1:48:24] you are in a shock. The whole world is
[1:48:26] on fire and you are giving the
[1:48:28] responsibility to put it off. Amen. Only
[1:48:31] you giving the responsibility to solve
[1:48:33] the problem of the whole world. Amen.
[1:48:35] Amen.
[1:48:38] You are in a shock
[1:48:41] that you don't even know how to tell
[1:48:43] God, thank you for waking me up this
[1:48:45] morning.
[1:48:48] You wake up straight on Facebook and and
[1:48:51] who has sent me message? Who has sent me
[1:48:53] text before you realize you are gone?
[1:48:55] You are in a shock.
[1:48:58] You were not like that before.
[1:49:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:18] You read the message. I mean Abraham
[1:49:20] comes right back to this very same
[1:49:22] story. That's what I'm using this as my
[1:49:24] text. He come back to this very same
[1:49:26] story and tell us that you know God had
[1:49:28] to use Elijah.
[1:49:31] Take the people because what a h a minia
[1:49:36] will put you between two opinions.
[1:49:38] That's what he said. He said they will
[1:49:40] put you between two opinions.
[1:49:46] And you are struggling between these two
[1:49:48] opinions.
[1:49:51] And that's where Israel was.
[1:49:56] They were between two opinions.
[1:49:59] They were still tied to their
[1:50:00] denomination of belief. And yet they
[1:50:03] want the revival of the day.
[1:50:06] They want the manifestation of the son
[1:50:09] of God. Oh, I can I can't wait. So we
[1:50:12] can speak things into existence and you
[1:50:14] start making lists of people you will
[1:50:16] speak you will speak yourself out of
[1:50:17] existence.
[1:50:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:24] Are we together? Are you seeing the
[1:50:27] picture?
[1:50:28] So Elijah comes here on the mountain and
[1:50:32] what he does is that
[1:50:36] he takes
[1:50:38] 12 stones.
[1:50:41] Praise the Lord. Amen. If these people
[1:50:43] were reading their Bible, they were so
[1:50:46] deep in idolatry
[1:50:49] that it couldn't even move them.
[1:50:52] He took 12 stones and patted them
[1:50:55] together
[1:50:57] would not be enough to remind you that
[1:51:00] this is what God did when he brought us
[1:51:02] out of Egypt and brought us into the
[1:51:05] promised land. He built a memorial. He
[1:51:08] told our fathers to build memorial.
[1:51:12] Amen. If you don't bear memorial, your
[1:51:15] children will have nothing to look back
[1:51:17] to. You must build memorial in your
[1:51:19] home. Let your children remember. Amen.
[1:51:22] Amen. We woke up and we prayed. Amen.
[1:51:25] Let them remember. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:30] Not your favorite television show or
[1:51:32] your favorite what? Whatever it is, be a
[1:51:34] memorial. Amen.
[1:51:39] The people were so so down, destroyed in
[1:51:42] idolatry that they couldn't even
[1:51:44] remember that God gave them a memorial.
[1:51:47] Amen.
[1:51:50] And until we build a memorial. Amen.
[1:51:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:55] One of these days, people will look back
[1:51:58] to this place, they can't even remember
[1:52:00] that there was a group of people here.
[1:52:02] There was a church on this corner.
[1:52:05] What kind of a memorial are you building
[1:52:09] young people? What memorial are you
[1:52:11] building?
[1:52:18] How you want to be remembered
[1:52:22] or you want you want us to make story
[1:52:24] when you are gone.
[1:52:27] Praise the Lord
[1:52:29] because we we good to make story. He was
[1:52:31] a nice guy. And I just half the half
[1:52:34] hour I he stopped. He Yeah, he was a
[1:52:36] nice guy. Yeah, he he was a nice guy.
[1:52:39] Very quiet. Nice guy.
[1:52:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:48] What memorial are you building?
[1:52:54] What are your co-workers going to
[1:52:55] remember you from when you no longer
[1:52:58] working in that company?
[1:53:01] When you no longer laying down that
[1:53:03] street, what your neighbors going to
[1:53:05] remember you for for
[1:53:14] take 12 stones tomorrow
[1:53:17] when you are telling these stories or
[1:53:19] your children eyes what meanth that and
[1:53:22] you set them down
[1:53:25] then the story become real. Why? because
[1:53:28] you have brought them to familiar place.
[1:53:30] Amen. Amen. The message become real when
[1:53:34] we can come to familiar place.
[1:53:44] Glory be to God.
[1:53:47] You love the Lord. Amen. I sure you do.
[1:53:50] I don't know how how can we come up with
[1:53:52] this statement. You love the Lord. If
[1:53:53] you didn't love the Lord, you won't be
[1:53:54] sitting down. You're listening to all of
[1:53:56] these things I'm saying. I don't know
[1:53:57] how we come up with that. You love the
[1:53:58] Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:54:03] Praise the Lord. Anyway, y'all just
[1:54:05] forgive us. Amen.
[1:54:12] But I'm hope that this is this is
[1:54:14] getting home to you. I'm I hope that is
[1:54:18] getting is getting right there with you.
[1:54:21] you know he says yeah uh another thing
[1:54:26] and another thing that causes it among
[1:54:29] people is getting between two opinion
[1:54:32] that just like what I said uh that will
[1:54:35] cause amnesia
[1:54:38] uh and uh it gets you to a place where
[1:54:44] you actually
[1:54:48] you have done you have lost your
[1:54:50] reasoning
[1:54:51] You have lost your mind. You don't know
[1:54:54] who you are. You can't identify
[1:54:57] yourself.
[1:55:00] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:03] The Bible says we are dead and our life
[1:55:07] is hid in Christ.
[1:55:11] For this reason, Paul said, "It's no
[1:55:13] longer I that liveth, but Christ that
[1:55:16] liveth in me."
[1:55:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. We have a new uh
[1:55:23] uh identity. We have a new
[1:55:26] identification.
[1:55:31] Glory be to God.
[1:55:49] You can walk around it and everything,
[1:55:51] but you still can't identify yourself.
[1:55:56] You know, that's that's the condition
[1:55:58] what Nebuchinnezza was in.
[1:56:01] He couldn't identify himself. Seven
[1:56:04] years
[1:56:06] because of the spirit of pride.
[1:56:09] God
[1:56:11] literally gave him the people of Israel
[1:56:14] to discipline them because what? They
[1:56:16] defied the Sabbath. They never allowed
[1:56:19] the land to rest.
[1:56:25] God raised him up. He said, "My servant
[1:56:26] Nebuchinnez." And he took that to
[1:56:28] himself. He got into a shock. Think
[1:56:31] about it. He got into a shock.
[1:56:35] When we get into these situations that
[1:56:38] sometimes you see that we take for
[1:56:40] common and and a person will think that
[1:56:42] h I'm the one doing it. It's my
[1:56:45] decision.
[1:56:46] Spiritually, you are in a shock.
[1:56:52] That you will use your own hands to
[1:56:54] destroy the thing that you are building.
[1:56:59] No matter how you try to to to to uh
[1:57:02] tell yourself that uh you know I I
[1:57:05] choose to do this. No, you enter a
[1:57:07] shock. Normally you will not do it under
[1:57:10] normal circumstances. You will not do
[1:57:12] it.
[1:57:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:20] Until we begin to realize and appreciate
[1:57:24] that everything we have, he give it to
[1:57:26] us.
[1:57:28] He gave it to us. Praise the Lord. Your
[1:57:31] job, your finance, your family, he gave
[1:57:34] it to you.
[1:57:38] You must acknowledge that. Keep that
[1:57:40] before you.
[1:57:53] Are we together? Amen.
[1:57:56] Brother, go ahead. Here. He says, "And
[1:57:58] we are identified with our family and
[1:58:00] human life." He says, "By marriage and
[1:58:03] our wives and and and and we marry." He
[1:58:05] says, "And our family, we identified by
[1:58:08] the union." And then and then what to
[1:58:11] think?
[1:58:12] What if this horrible thing will happen
[1:58:15] and and and you and you wouldn't be able
[1:58:18] to remember you are married.
[1:58:23] Who your wife? Who is your children?
[1:58:26] Who who is your father? Who is your
[1:58:28] mother? Who is your neighbor? You are
[1:58:30] just in that state. When this place used
[1:58:33] to be a cherished place, you drive to
[1:58:36] now you can drive by and don't even
[1:58:37] remember that there is a church on this
[1:58:39] corner.
[1:58:42] when it used to be a cherished place.
[1:58:45] What is happening?
[1:58:54] We don't remember quiet time. We don't
[1:58:56] remember prayer time. We don't remember
[1:58:57] church order.
[1:58:59] And we think that we are advancing in
[1:59:01] the message. No, no, no. Something has
[1:59:04] gone wrong.
[1:59:16] Now there is a place when you get this
[1:59:19] amnesty said you might get like
[1:59:21] Nebuchadnezzar. Okay, just like what I
[1:59:23] said. So I'm just telling you that's
[1:59:25] what I took my inspiration from
[1:59:28] this morning. But this is what is
[1:59:31] happening.
[1:59:32] So Elijah comes
[1:59:36] and build this and see what he says. See
[1:59:38] what he says as the prophet build this
[1:59:41] morning.
[1:59:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:46] Amen.
[1:59:48] And with the stones he built the altar
[1:59:50] in the name of the Lord and made
[1:59:52] trenches about the altar.
[1:59:55] Verse 33. And he put the wood on it and
[2:00:00] cut the bulocks in pieces and laid them
[2:00:03] on the wood and said, "Fill four barrels
[2:00:06] of water."
[2:00:10] And he said, "Do it in uh the second
[2:00:13] time."
[2:00:14] They did it the second time. He said,
[2:00:16] "Do it the third time."
[2:00:20] And the water ran down the trench.
[2:00:23] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:26] And it came to pass
[2:00:28] at the time of the offering of the
[2:00:31] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[2:00:33] prophet came near and said, Lord God of
[2:00:37] Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel.
[2:00:42] Let it be known this day
[2:00:45] that thou art God in Israel,
[2:00:48] and I am thy servant,
[2:00:51] and that I
[2:00:54] I have done all these things at thy
[2:00:58] word.
[2:01:00] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:01:03] It is the word of God because why? God
[2:01:06] told Joshua to make a monument.
[2:01:10] Praise the Lord. Amen. You want to look
[2:01:14] uh uh uh uh also there in in in Exodus
[2:01:18] when Moses when Moses built the h came
[2:01:22] down with the tablets. When God gave him
[2:01:23] the word,
[2:01:25] what he did, the Bible says he built 12
[2:01:28] pillars
[2:01:32] with stones.
[2:01:34] After he received the word, God told him
[2:01:37] to build 12 pillars with stones
[2:01:41] as a memorial that this day I have given
[2:01:44] you my word.
[2:01:51] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:56] Hallelujah.
[2:02:05] Now let's look at some few things and
[2:02:06] then I try to wrap this whole thing up
[2:02:09] this morning.
[2:02:11] You love the Lord. What a wonderful
[2:02:14] Jesus.
[2:02:18] Revelation chapter 13.
[2:02:21] Let's look in Revelation chapter 13.
[2:02:39] Let's look in Revelation chapter 13. Or
[2:02:41] you want to first take uh Ephesians
[2:02:43] chapter 1. If you want to take Ephesians
[2:02:46] chapter one first before we go to
[2:02:48] Revelation,
[2:02:50] let's take uh the Apostle Paul,
[2:02:51] Ephesians chapter one and and see what
[2:02:53] he says here.
[2:02:56] Hallelujah.
[2:02:58] Ephesians chapter 1, Paul who says here
[2:03:01] in Ephesians chapter 1 verse three,
[2:03:03] blessed be the God and father of our
[2:03:06] Lord Jesus who have blessed us with all
[2:03:08] spiritual blessing in heaven and places
[2:03:10] in Christ. by calling as he have chosen
[2:03:14] us in him
[2:03:16] before the foundation of the word. Why
[2:03:21] we can remember?
[2:03:25] Amen.
[2:03:26] Why we can't remember?
[2:03:28] Because when we fell, we went into a
[2:03:31] shock.
[2:03:36] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:39] Are we together?
[2:03:42] Because when we fail like uh what what
[2:03:45] brother Israel Ariel preached on
[2:03:47] Wednesday night with uh uh uh Mashibusha
[2:03:50] 7 throwing him down. Oh that was just a
[2:03:52] beautiful time. Amen. That was a
[2:03:54] beautiful time. I told him while he was
[2:03:56] preaching I was writing and trying to
[2:03:58] write on the names the meaning of the
[2:04:00] names and I saw him going into it. I
[2:04:01] said well Lord the Holy Ghost have
[2:04:02] already taken over. I I keep my comment.
[2:04:06] Praise the Lord. I don't need to add to
[2:04:09] it. It was just beautiful. But I call in
[2:04:11] as he has chosen us in him before the
[2:04:15] foundation of the world that we should
[2:04:18] be holy
[2:04:21] without blame
[2:04:23] before him in love.
[2:04:26] He has choose us in him
[2:04:29] before the foundation of the word.
[2:04:33] Are we together?
[2:04:36] Sin has put us, the fall of Adam has put
[2:04:40] us into shock that we think their holy
[2:04:43] life is hard
[2:04:46] for the person to live holy and live
[2:04:48] righteous and do right is hard.
[2:04:52] No, but he choose you.
[2:04:55] That was the picture he took about you.
[2:05:03] Revelation chapter 13.
[2:05:08] Are we together?
[2:05:17] Revelation chapter 13.
[2:05:22] I love how the Holy Spirit did it right
[2:05:24] here. Revelation chapter 13 uh verse 8
[2:05:27] and and 17 verse8. The the Bible says
[2:05:30] the same thing. Beautiful. You see how
[2:05:33] God will dwell all day. See right here,
[2:05:36] Revelation chapter 13 verse 8. And all
[2:05:39] that dw upon the earth shall worship him
[2:05:42] whose name are not written in the lamb
[2:05:46] book uh in in in the book of life of the
[2:05:48] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[2:05:50] world. So here the Bible is making us to
[2:05:52] know that there are names that was
[2:05:54] written
[2:05:55] in the lamb book of life. Are we
[2:05:58] together? Chapter 17 verse8. Also the
[2:06:02] beast that thou saw it and is not and
[2:06:04] shall and shall descend out of the
[2:06:06] bottomless pit and go into pedition and
[2:06:09] they that dwelt upon the earth shall
[2:06:11] wonder whose name were written in the
[2:06:15] book of life from the foundation of the
[2:06:16] world. So when God choose us
[2:06:20] in him he wrote our names
[2:06:24] on the lamb book of life.
[2:06:28] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:31] Amen.
[2:06:32] When he choose us in him to be holy
[2:06:37] and live right and be a memorial, we
[2:06:41] should be God's memorial. Amen.
[2:06:45] He wrote our names on the Lamb book of
[2:06:47] life.
[2:06:53] Are we together?
[2:06:55] That was what he did.
[2:06:58] Hebrews chapter 4 verse three. We come
[2:07:02] into familiar places. Praise the Lord.
[2:07:05] We got to get out of this arm here
[2:07:07] before we go in the rapture. We cannot
[2:07:10] go in the rapture doubting
[2:07:13] our position in Christ. We can't go in
[2:07:15] the rapture doubting whether we will
[2:07:17] make it, whether we will not make it.
[2:07:18] You got to get out of your state of uh
[2:07:21] of uh h spiritual armies here. And it
[2:07:24] would takes the word of God. It would
[2:07:26] takes the message of the hour.
[2:07:30] That's why those seals were open.
[2:07:33] That's why he will come with a
[2:07:34] thanksgiving message and say to you, you
[2:07:37] never did it in the first place. Amen.
[2:07:39] You were trapped into it.
[2:07:44] Why? He's trying to take us to familiar
[2:07:46] places. Amen. But we are held down with
[2:07:49] habits. We are held down with uh with h
[2:07:52] the memory of our past and and and and
[2:07:55] the things we are struggling with in our
[2:07:56] body. Instead of accepting God's word,
[2:07:59] sitting on our feet and said, "Greater
[2:08:02] is he that is in me than he that is in
[2:08:04] the word." Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Until
[2:08:08] you take that position, you will never
[2:08:10] break free. You will always try try and
[2:08:13] sin will drag you back down again.
[2:08:20] Hebrews chapter 4:3 says what he says
[2:08:23] here uh uh uh uh uh verse two for unto
[2:08:27] us was the gospel preached as as were
[2:08:30] unto them but the word preached did not
[2:08:34] profit them
[2:08:36] not being mixed with faith in them that
[2:08:38] hear it for we which have believed do
[2:08:41] enter into rest as he dead
[2:08:48] as I have swn in my wrath.
[2:08:52] If they shall enter into my rest,
[2:08:56] although the works were finished from
[2:09:00] the foundation
[2:09:02] of the word,
[2:09:05] the works were finished from the
[2:09:08] foundation. Amen. That's the reason why
[2:09:12] when he came on the cross and he paid
[2:09:14] the price, he could say, "It's
[2:09:16] finished." This was what was left. I can
[2:09:20] reclaim my ill back because the works
[2:09:23] were finished. I've paid the price of
[2:09:25] redemption. Amen.
[2:09:29] is now if they can believe it. I have to
[2:09:32] send them a prophet to take them to
[2:09:34] familiar places and bring the word of
[2:09:36] God that will be able to take them to
[2:09:38] familiar places that you were chosen in
[2:09:42] him before the foundation of the word.
[2:09:49] Are we together? Amen.
[2:09:53] Oh, you love the Lord. Amen. See what
[2:09:55] Jesus will say to his say to his
[2:09:57] disciple.
[2:09:59] St. John chapter 17.
[2:10:05] You love the Lord. Amen.
[2:10:11] You got to pray for me for me to stop
[2:10:13] saying that.
[2:10:16] That's my prayer request. Amen.
[2:10:19] Amen.
[2:10:25] I keep saying it which means you're not
[2:10:26] praying enough.
[2:10:31] I believe God will answer your prayer
[2:10:32] and will be delivered. St. John chapter
[2:10:35] 17,
[2:10:38] you know, we call Matthew chapter 6, we
[2:10:42] call that the Lord's prayer. That that
[2:10:44] actually is not the Lord's prayer. When
[2:10:46] you when you really studied it, you know
[2:10:48] that God was giving us a way when you
[2:10:51] pray. He said when you pray say
[2:10:54] Matthew St. John chapter 17. This is the
[2:10:57] Lord's prayer
[2:11:00] when he prayed and it says in John H
[2:11:03] Matthew 11 when he says, "Father, I
[2:11:06] thank thee." That that's that's the
[2:11:08] Lord's prayer. That's the Lord praying.
[2:11:10] He said, "Lord, Father, I thank thee
[2:11:12] that you have hid these things from the
[2:11:15] wise and the prudent and you have
[2:11:17] revealed unto babies such as we learn.
[2:11:21] people that can be willing to go back to
[2:11:24] familiar places.
[2:11:29] Men always want to go to places we all
[2:11:31] having dreams. I wish I can go to this
[2:11:33] place. I want to go to that place. It's
[2:11:36] always places that we have never been
[2:11:37] before. But God desire is to bring you
[2:11:41] to places where you were before. Amen.
[2:11:45] Places where your memorial is laying.
[2:11:48] Amen. Amen. places where when you get
[2:11:50] back you remember and say I was at this
[2:11:53] place before.
[2:12:03] St. John chapter 17
[2:12:06] he says father 24
[2:12:11] I will that day also whom thou has given
[2:12:15] me
[2:12:17] be with me where I am
[2:12:20] that they may behold my glory
[2:12:24] which thou hast given me for thou loveth
[2:12:28] me before the foundation of the word.
[2:12:32] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:12:35] He says, "Let them see it, Lord. Let
[2:12:37] them see the glory.
[2:12:40] Let them see the glory
[2:12:43] that they had before the foundation of
[2:12:45] the word.
[2:12:51] Living in a state of innocence,
[2:12:57] no evil desire, no evil thought.
[2:13:01] Praise the Lord." Amen.
[2:13:03] We have tasted it. It's hard to get
[2:13:06] back.
[2:13:08] This flesh.
[2:13:11] It's hard. It's hard.
[2:13:15] That's the reason why Christian life is
[2:13:18] a daily battle.
[2:13:20] It's a daily fight. Praise the Lord.
[2:13:23] Amen. Amen. You are reclaiming your
[2:13:26] glory.
[2:13:28] Your flesh is telling you something
[2:13:30] different. You are saying no I don't
[2:13:32] believe you. I believe the glory that I
[2:13:35] had with the father before the
[2:13:36] foundation of the world. I believe he
[2:13:39] choose me in him. I'm elected in him.
[2:13:42] That's what I believe. Amen.
[2:13:51] Oh my.
[2:13:54] See what this man says. See what this
[2:13:56] prophet of God says right here. Serpent
[2:13:58] sea. He says, "We are taught in the
[2:14:01] blessed word that we have fellowship
[2:14:04] with him before the foundation of the
[2:14:06] word." When the morning star sang
[2:14:09] together and the sons of God shouted for
[2:14:12] joy way back before the foundation of
[2:14:15] the word. How
[2:14:19] how do we know that that wasn't at the
[2:14:22] same time the lamb was slain?
[2:14:26] That when God in his great thinking seen
[2:14:31] us shouting and rejoicing in our
[2:14:34] salvation through Christ, we don't
[2:14:38] rejoice in our salvation. We sit down
[2:14:41] like people that need help.
[2:14:44] The word is being preached.
[2:14:47] God's thought declared unto you. We must
[2:14:50] be rejoicing in our salvation. We must
[2:14:52] be saying, "Thank you, Jesus."
[2:14:56] Amen. We don't rejoice in our salvation.
[2:15:02] We just said the poor me. Oh me. Oh man.
[2:15:06] Oh God have mercy. Oh help me.
[2:15:10] Man, sin can abuse people. Sin has
[2:15:13] abused us so bad.
[2:15:16] that we
[2:15:18] we struggle to identify with our self.
[2:15:22] We struggle to identify with our real
[2:15:24] self.
[2:15:27] Our real self coming from out of the out
[2:15:29] of God's word.
[2:15:34] You see, but but uh the thing about it
[2:15:38] is that many times we try to do it in
[2:15:40] ourself.
[2:15:42] If you recognize God's truth and and and
[2:15:46] God's word asks you to be born again,
[2:15:48] you have to take step to everything that
[2:15:51] God's word command you. If the word of
[2:15:53] God says repent and be baptized in the
[2:15:55] name of the Lord Jesus, you got to take
[2:15:58] step to God's word and says I believe
[2:16:00] that and and it's the word of God. I
[2:16:02] want to get back to what what reality I
[2:16:05] was. Amen.
[2:16:08] But many times people we we try to sort
[2:16:11] it out in our mind. We try to work our
[2:16:13] way. I'm going to take seven days of
[2:16:16] fast. The message was powerful today.
[2:16:18] When I go home beginning this week, I'm
[2:16:20] going to fast the entire week.
[2:16:23] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:26] And then we carry oursel down through
[2:16:28] hunger strike.
[2:16:31] Amen.
[2:16:34] Not staying in prayer, not reading God's
[2:16:36] word, not dedicating ourselves. You just
[2:16:39] on a hunger strike booty
[2:16:48] in his great thinking.
[2:16:52] Praise the Lord.
[2:16:58] He's seen us shouting and rejoicing in
[2:17:00] our salvation through Jesus.
[2:17:03] And tonight we
[2:17:06] we only got a foretaste of the great
[2:17:08] glory divine which shall be revealed at
[2:17:12] his coming. He said the same thing in
[2:17:15] the manifest the psalms.
[2:17:19] No wonder when the monsters sang
[2:17:21] together and the sons of God shouted for
[2:17:24] joy when they seen the plan of
[2:17:28] salvation. God putting your name on the
[2:17:31] book of on on on a book before the
[2:17:33] foundation of the word.
[2:17:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:17:39] You see Jesus told the same thing to his
[2:17:41] disciple. Don't rejoice because you are
[2:17:43] casting out demons. Rejoice because your
[2:17:45] name is on the book. It never came real
[2:17:47] to John until he found himself on the
[2:17:51] island of Patmos. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[2:17:54] Lord. and one had a bug that no one was
[2:17:58] worth it.
[2:18:02] Glory be to God.
[2:18:04] That was the reason why John says,
[2:18:06] "Every creature in heaven, on earth,
[2:18:08] beneath the earth, help me.
[2:18:11] You be shouting because he saw his
[2:18:14] name." Amen.
[2:18:16] But Jesus told him when he was here and
[2:18:18] in his earthly ministry, he told him,
[2:18:19] "Your name is on the Lamb book of life.
[2:18:22] Don't worry.
[2:18:24] You'll see your name one of these days.
[2:18:27] Not there yet. Yeah, you will see your
[2:18:29] name. Not there. Don't wait to get
[2:18:31] there. Yeah. Praise the Lord.
[2:18:35] Amen. Those skills fall will fall off
[2:18:38] and and something will open in your
[2:18:40] heart and then you will realize
[2:18:44] I'm not what I used to be. Amen. Even
[2:18:47] though I'm not there yet, but I'm not
[2:18:49] what I used to be.
[2:18:53] Amen. Amen. It starts to give you an
[2:18:57] appetite for godly life and clean life
[2:19:00] and and and all the hateful thoughts out
[2:19:03] of your mind and and hateful desires out
[2:19:06] of your mind
[2:19:08] because it's possible. If he choose us
[2:19:11] in him to be holy, it's possible for us
[2:19:13] to get there because it's his choice.
[2:19:15] It's not your choice.
[2:19:18] All he need to do just bring you to
[2:19:20] familiar places.
[2:19:23] Have you ever gone back
[2:19:26] to the place of your childhood
[2:19:30] where you grew up? You know the feeling.
[2:19:36] I remember one year I was I was coming
[2:19:38] coming from Liberia. I was going to
[2:19:40] coast. I came through the border and I
[2:19:42] needed to pass in the city where our
[2:19:44] church was and I was I tried I was I I
[2:19:47] tried to do everything to disguise
[2:19:49] myself because it was not too safe and
[2:19:52] uh but I wanted to see if the building
[2:19:53] was still standing. So I went and uh the
[2:19:56] place was yet so quiet and and you know
[2:19:59] I was just and as I was and as I was
[2:20:01] going down the street I mean goosebump
[2:20:04] was just coming all over my body. Why?
[2:20:07] Because I was in familiar places.
[2:20:10] I could see the places, you know, I go
[2:20:13] and buy roasted food on the on the
[2:20:16] street. I could see the places and in
[2:20:18] the market hall. I came right down. As
[2:20:20] soon I came down the market, our church,
[2:20:22] our church building was right down
[2:20:23] there. I was just standing and looking
[2:20:25] and this guy came from behind me. He
[2:20:27] recognized me.
[2:20:30] It was my landlord's son, you know. He
[2:20:32] recognized me. He says, "Man, where
[2:20:35] where where have you been?" I said, "No,
[2:20:37] I'm in Abby Jen." He says, "My mom, my
[2:20:40] mom talk about you all the time. Let's
[2:20:42] let's go home." I said, "No, no. I have
[2:20:43] a bus. I got a job. I just I didn't want
[2:20:45] to call crowded, you know, uh bring a
[2:20:48] scene, you know, but uh I mean that's
[2:20:51] that's what it is.
[2:20:54] Every time I go home, uh uh uh uh
[2:20:56] Brother Caleb Church is right in the
[2:20:58] area where I grew up. I love going down
[2:21:00] there. There is something about going to
[2:21:03] familiar places.
[2:21:08] There is something about going to
[2:21:11] familiar places. And that's what the
[2:21:14] ministry of Malachi 4 has come to do
[2:21:18] to take us back to familiar places.
[2:21:23] Before we came here, before we bypass
[2:21:26] our family,
[2:21:29] the word has come to take you back to
[2:21:32] familiar places. Amen. for you to be
[2:21:35] seeing yourself as a son of God. Not
[2:21:37] just a church member, not just a church
[2:21:40] member, a son of God that love God.
[2:21:43] Amen.
[2:21:45] That is in love with God.
[2:21:49] That want to meet God's purpose for
[2:21:51] their life. Amen.
[2:21:54] Lord, if it is just one person, Amen.
[2:21:57] that my life can be a witness to. Yeah,
[2:22:00] let me tell them the kind of ugly daily
[2:22:03] life I used to live. But the grace of
[2:22:05] God took me from that trash. That's what
[2:22:08] God want to make out of you.
[2:22:11] Amen.
[2:22:15] God want to make you little memorials.
[2:22:20] Somebody can say, "You see that guy down
[2:22:22] there? You see that girl?
[2:22:26] Your life touched me.
[2:22:29] That's why he want to make out of us.
[2:22:34] When people tell their story, they can
[2:22:36] bring you back.
[2:22:39] That's that's the thing about memorial.
[2:22:41] The story is not complete
[2:22:44] until certain things are said, until
[2:22:47] certain names are called.
[2:22:51] Amen.
[2:22:54] Oh, I love the Lord. I'm feeling so good
[2:22:56] this morning. Amen. And you know why I'm
[2:22:58] feeling good? Not because I'm preaching.
[2:23:00] I'm feeling good because this thing came
[2:23:02] so real to me. It came so so real to me.
[2:23:07] You don't know. You don't know how I
[2:23:09] feel.
[2:23:11] You don't know how I feel.
[2:23:19] So this this is just a testimony. It's
[2:23:21] not it's not even a message I'm
[2:23:22] preaching. It's just a testimony.
[2:23:25] Amen. And that's what God does. You see
[2:23:28] all these characters that are in the
[2:23:29] Bible.
[2:23:35] All these character
[2:23:37] that the they are familiar places
[2:23:41] of your life that God hid in those
[2:23:44] character. That's the reason why they
[2:23:47] can preach about David and you can see
[2:23:49] yourself in David.
[2:23:53] Why God use those men life in such an
[2:23:58] extraordinary way? Honor, inspiration.
[2:24:02] They said things when David said, "My
[2:24:05] God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?"
[2:24:09] A man had looked like uh what is he
[2:24:12] talking about? God has been good to him.
[2:24:13] But he was under inspiration because
[2:24:16] that would be the very same word that
[2:24:18] Jesus would say. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:24:24] And that's the reason why the word of
[2:24:26] God, this Bible becomes so it becomes a
[2:24:29] new book
[2:24:32] because you're not just reading ancient
[2:24:34] Jewish history. You are looking in a
[2:24:37] mirror of God's word and you can see
[2:24:39] yourself. Amen.
[2:24:44] I have been there before. I know what it
[2:24:47] is. I know what rejection means. Yeah.
[2:24:52] Praise the Lord.
[2:24:55] That is the work of the Holy Ghost to
[2:24:58] bring you back to familiar places. Jesus
[2:25:01] said when the Holy Ghost come, he will
[2:25:02] do what? Remind you
[2:25:05] to bring you back to familiar places
[2:25:09] because that is the only way
[2:25:12] that a person can come out of amia.
[2:25:16] That is the only way if these things
[2:25:19] start becoming so real to us that God
[2:25:22] choose me and put my name on the lamb
[2:25:24] book of life before the foundation of
[2:25:27] the word. He choose me in Christ to be
[2:25:31] holy to be right.
[2:25:35] If that becomes so real is enough to
[2:25:37] change your life.
[2:25:41] It's enough to change your life to
[2:25:43] create a desire in you to be more like
[2:25:46] him. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:52] Oh, you just packed me up this morning.
[2:25:55] Amen. Oh, I thank God for the
[2:25:58] atmosphere. Amen. I thank God for the
[2:26:00] atmosphere. Thank God for his word.
[2:26:03] Amen. He want to bring us to familiar
[2:26:06] places. Praise the Lord. Think about
[2:26:09] that those that that couple that brother
[2:26:11] talk about on the brink of divorce and
[2:26:13] they are splitting everything. They get
[2:26:15] in the attic of their house and their
[2:26:17] hand gets on the baby shoes. A baby that
[2:26:20] they had and that baby is dead. What
[2:26:23] happened? They came to a familiar place
[2:26:25] in their life. One shoes
[2:26:30] and it was enough
[2:26:33] to heal their divorce. Amen.
[2:26:37] That's all God needs just to bring you
[2:26:39] to a familiar place. And let it become
[2:26:42] so real to you. The things that we hold
[2:26:45] so dear and you know and and and we
[2:26:47] busting our brain about. We know that if
[2:26:50] he can take care of the birds, he can
[2:26:51] take care of us. We're not preaching
[2:26:54] slothfulness and lives. But we're not
[2:26:56] going to take ourself above God's work.
[2:26:59] We're not going to take oursel above
[2:27:01] when I know that I'm supposed to be a
[2:27:02] memorial. Amen.
[2:27:04] supposed to be a living monument. Amen.
[2:27:07] That's what Peter says.
[2:27:10] That's what he want to be. He want you
[2:27:12] to be a living monument.
[2:27:22] I challenge you really get in prayer.
[2:27:25] You get down in prayer and I mean you
[2:27:27] are just so much there in prayer. You
[2:27:29] praising God and you thanking God. Let
[2:27:31] he just take you to familiar place. You
[2:27:34] break down and start crying.
[2:27:37] It change you from inside.
[2:27:39] Let God just take you to a familiar
[2:27:41] place in your life. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:27:46] That's what he love to do.
[2:27:50] Praise the Lord. Because you see,
[2:27:53] heaven is strange to us because of the
[2:27:57] shock of sin that we are in.
[2:28:01] Amen.
[2:28:05] But when the sins gets on the other
[2:28:07] side,
[2:28:09] every word is familiar. Praise God.
[2:28:13] Why? Because they are delivered from
[2:28:16] this shock.
[2:28:18] They know as he is known. Amen.
[2:28:24] Praise the Lord.
[2:28:26] And even in that state, you can be able
[2:28:30] to reckon with this life because an
[2:28:32] understanding breaks out that you begin
[2:28:35] to see, oh, I see why I went through
[2:28:37] that. Oh, I see why this happened. Oh, I
[2:28:40] see why this happened. Because the
[2:28:42] fullness, the fullness of knowledge is
[2:28:44] there with you.
[2:28:48] But right here, we trapped in this body.
[2:28:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:28:56] That's the reason why you read
[2:28:57] something, you say, "Oh, I see it. I see
[2:28:59] it." And tomorrow you get back, "Oh, I
[2:29:00] see it. I see it." The same thing you
[2:29:02] saw it yesterday, you see it again.
[2:29:04] Because why? It keeps opening slowly.
[2:29:08] Slowly your consciousness is coming
[2:29:10] back. Your consciousness is coming back.
[2:29:14] You make mistake, you say, "Oh Lord,
[2:29:15] have mercy upon me. Please help me.
[2:29:17] Lord, please help me. Please help me. I
[2:29:20] don't want to be like this." Why?
[2:29:22] Because your consciousness is coming
[2:29:25] back. Medical science broke into this.
[2:29:31] Yeah. They broke into it. You know why?
[2:29:34] H a science started putting television
[2:29:36] in in the patient's room to get their
[2:29:39] minds off their sickness.
[2:29:43] Because when you put some kind of a
[2:29:44] funny thing on, you are laughing
[2:29:46] laughing laughing. It it it helps the
[2:29:48] nails of your body. It relax you. So
[2:29:50] your mind is off your sickness.
[2:29:58] When a person is in a state of coma and
[2:30:00] other thing, they want they want close
[2:30:02] family members.
[2:30:07] Why? Because they are tapping into these
[2:30:09] things.
[2:30:12] Maybe if the person hear a familiar
[2:30:13] voice, it will grab their attention
[2:30:17] and all of this.
[2:30:21] Praise the Lord. When that veil leaves
[2:30:24] from your eye, the message of the hour
[2:30:26] is not a strange voice to you. Praise
[2:30:29] the Lord. You hear it. It looks like you
[2:30:31] have heard it before. Yeah, you heard it
[2:30:33] when you were with the father. When you
[2:30:34] were an attribute in your father. Amen.
[2:30:39] Praise the Lord.
[2:30:41] That's why the person can say, "Oh, that
[2:30:43] you know that I was looking for this
[2:30:45] truth. Something was telling me." Yeah.
[2:30:52] It was a familiar echo. Amen. Coming
[2:30:55] from far.
[2:30:57] Oh, hallelujah. Let's just give the Lord
[2:30:59] a hand of praise this morning. Amen.
[2:31:03] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:31:07] Hallelujah.
[2:31:09] Amen.
[2:31:11] That's why God sent a prophet, people.
[2:31:13] It's not to make a cut out of us. No.
[2:31:16] God sent us a prophet to bring us
[2:31:19] familiar voice. Amen. Familiar saying to
[2:31:24] to to take us to familiar places, our
[2:31:27] names in the book, our predestinated h
[2:31:30] election, adoption.
[2:31:36] Praise the Lord. The Bible says the
[2:31:39] prodical son came to himself. He was in
[2:31:41] a shock eating from pig pen.
[2:31:45] But when he came to himself in his mind
[2:31:48] in his spirit
[2:31:51] he remember in my father house even the
[2:31:54] servants don't eat this thing what am I
[2:31:56] doing yet
[2:31:59] that was how he pick up his bed put in
[2:32:01] your resination and went back home
[2:32:04] because he came out of his shock even
[2:32:07] the dogs don't eat this
[2:32:10] then you think about in your father
[2:32:12] house amen honor your father provision.
[2:32:18] You think he want you to be slave to be
[2:32:21] enslaveing yourself just to meet your
[2:32:23] needs. No, he want you to trust him.
[2:32:27] That he can bless you. Amen. He can
[2:32:30] bless you. He can put you to a place
[2:32:32] where you can enjoy the joy of your
[2:32:34] salvation. When even when you going to
[2:32:37] work, you are happy to be going to work
[2:32:39] because you know you you are going to
[2:32:41] work. You are a monument. You are a
[2:32:42] testimony. You don't have to be
[2:32:44] compromising, telling lies and you
[2:32:46] making up stories to survive. Your
[2:32:48] heavenly father, amen, will want you to
[2:32:51] be making story to survive.
[2:32:53] That's how much we have reduced God to.
[2:32:58] That's how much we have reduced him.
[2:33:04] That God can only bless me if I enslave
[2:33:06] myself to the system.
[2:33:11] Musicians, you can come
[2:33:23] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:33:27] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:33:34] Oh, thank you Jesus.
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:19] I don't know about you this morning, but
[2:34:22] just like I said,
[2:34:23] [Music]
[2:34:28] Brother Brandon talks about that
[2:34:31] slave that says I'm not for sale.
[2:34:35] Talks about that man and sat right
[2:34:37] there. He knew
[2:34:39] that back home his father is a king
[2:34:50] and uh
[2:34:54] and because it was real to him even
[2:34:56] though he was far away from home
[2:35:00] he was not going to enslave himself. He
[2:35:02] was not going to allow his chains to
[2:35:05] define him.
[2:35:08] He was not going to allow his different
[2:35:10] environment to define him.
[2:35:13] He knew I'm a son of a king. Whether in
[2:35:15] chains or not, I'm going to behave as a
[2:35:18] son of a king.
[2:35:26] See how it's so easy now and day for
[2:35:29] people to back up on the word of God.
[2:35:33] Our
[2:35:36] trust bank is so empty.
[2:35:39] Our trust bank
[2:35:42] is so low
[2:35:48] that as soon as we face a little thing,
[2:35:50] it's so easy for us to back up on God.
[2:35:54] It's so easy
[2:35:57] instead of trusting God and and taking
[2:35:59] more steps and making more effort and
[2:36:02] say Lord you you have brought me this
[2:36:04] fire you are more than able
[2:36:11] [Music]
[2:36:25] I don't know where you are this morning,
[2:36:30] [Music]
[2:36:33] but God desire to take you to familiar
[2:36:36] places if you love to travel with him.
[2:36:40] [Music]
[2:36:44] If you love to travel with him and want
[2:36:46] to take his hands, he's ready to take
[2:36:48] you down familiar places.
[2:36:52] He's ready to show you how grace has
[2:36:54] been so good to you.
[2:36:58] He has been so good to us more than we
[2:37:00] deserve.
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:16] And sometimes that's all we need. That's
[2:37:18] all we need as individuals.
[2:37:21] That's all we need.
[2:37:23] [Music]
[2:37:29] When things gets rough and it looks like
[2:37:32] nothing is making sense and nothing is
[2:37:34] taking a hold, all you need is just get
[2:37:38] down and cry and just ask God to take
[2:37:40] your hands and and let you just carry
[2:37:43] you down the little path. Sometimes it
[2:37:45] just take five minutes and the
[2:37:48] atmosphere around you change your mind
[2:37:51] is set up. You say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[2:37:55] Thank you, Lord.
[2:37:57] [Music]
[2:38:04] This message never came to condemn you
[2:38:06] and then never came to just uh enslave
[2:38:09] you and and and and and and put you on a
[2:38:11] legalization. God has come. He know that
[2:38:15] we trapped in a body. We trapped in a
[2:38:17] body. It's a cage. It's a cell.
[2:38:20] [Music]
[2:38:23] And until he help us out,
[2:38:26] we would die with our lustful desires.
[2:38:29] We will die with our anger. We will die
[2:38:32] with our bitterness. Until God reach
[2:38:34] down and get us out of that state
[2:38:40] where he can change our lives.
[2:38:43] We'll be sitting right in his mercy.
[2:38:46] We'll be sitting in a provision that he
[2:38:48] has made and we still be having desire
[2:38:51] to destroy our own life.
[2:38:53] destroy our family
[2:38:59] just for some kind of a stupid pleasure,
[2:39:02] just for some kind of a stupid past
[2:39:04] life.
[2:39:05] [Music]
[2:39:32] precious memory.
[2:39:35] Oh, how
[2:39:38] how they lingered.
[2:39:41] Ah,
[2:39:44] there ever floss my soul
[2:39:52] in the stillness
[2:39:56] of the midnight.
[2:40:04] Oh, let almighty God just get you in
[2:40:06] that condition.
[2:40:12] that he just gets you in that condition
[2:40:16] or he can condition your mind and just
[2:40:18] condition your heart.
[2:40:22] Many of us are life life is better for
[2:40:24] us no matter what you are going through.
[2:40:28] You can't compare it to what it used to
[2:40:30] be.
[2:40:34] How much more? How how much more should
[2:40:36] God do to make himself real to you?
[2:40:44] We are always trusting one thing or
[2:40:45] another.
[2:40:47] We can't trust the Lord. It's so easy
[2:40:49] for us to let go on God. The one that
[2:40:52] holds our very existence, the one that
[2:40:55] holds our life, it's so easy for us to
[2:40:57] let go on him.
[2:41:04] [Music]
[2:41:10] I hope that God as a church he will
[2:41:13] bring us back to familiar places.
[2:41:18] We started as a little group of people
[2:41:20] yet we could hold conventions.
[2:41:24] Now we have we have just become a
[2:41:26] slothful group of people drag our feet
[2:41:28] to church. And and and I mean I mean
[2:41:31] things is just we we make special
[2:41:34] meetings on the weekend and and you
[2:41:36] don't see people in church. Uh well what
[2:41:38] is happening?
[2:41:40] What is happening? What's what's what's
[2:41:42] going on in in our in our spirit man?
[2:41:52] Don't tell me about bills.
[2:41:55] How did you survive before you came to
[2:41:57] paying bills?
[2:42:00] [Music]
[2:42:02] We don't make God first in our life.
[2:42:04] He's not our priority.
[2:42:05] [Music]
[2:42:07] We find every lean thing to make excuses
[2:42:10] of.
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:19] I mean, when we went through the co it
[2:42:21] was just like a revival.
[2:42:24] We were going from house to house having
[2:42:26] communion. Prayer meetings were going
[2:42:28] on. We came back to church. I mean, uh h
[2:42:31] it was just such a present of communion
[2:42:34] and such an atmosphere.
[2:42:36] [Music]
[2:42:42] Start a singing group dedication where
[2:42:44] all of these things have gone. What has
[2:42:46] happened?
[2:42:49] [Music]
[2:43:12] That's a spiritual shock somewhere.
[2:43:15] [Music]
[2:43:37] Think about our families.
[2:43:40] Think about our children.
[2:43:45] What are we teaching them to trust?
[2:43:50] What are we teaching in what kind of
[2:43:51] life are we are we setting before them
[2:43:54] that this is how life is?
[2:43:57] You just strip yourself naked and and
[2:43:59] and dress and and all of those things
[2:44:02] because that's what they look at. That's
[2:44:03] what they see.
[2:44:05] [Music]
[2:44:17] [Music]
[2:44:26] While the music plays softly, let's just
[2:44:29] pray together this afternoon.
[2:44:36] Maybe you are just like me.
[2:44:39] How I want God to take me to familiar
[2:44:42] places.
[2:44:43] How I want him to take me back.
[2:44:46] [Music]
[2:44:48] Take me back.
[2:44:51] [Music]
[2:44:55] Take me back, dear Lord.
[2:44:58] [Music]
[2:45:13] Heavenly Father,
[2:45:15] Almighty God, Lord Jesus,
[2:45:20] we try Lord God to to use this Lord
[2:45:23] Father to call ourself to a sort in the
[2:45:25] family.
[2:45:28] [Music]
[2:45:30] Lord, we are caught between two
[2:45:32] opinions. Lord,
[2:45:34] we are caught between two opinions.
[2:45:39] We are caught into this shock of father
[2:45:41] Lord God
[2:45:45] where our natural needs appeal to us
[2:45:48] more than our spiritual need.
[2:45:52] It's not just enough to be baptized in
[2:45:54] Jesus name. It's not just enough to
[2:45:57] believe that brother Brandham is a
[2:45:58] prophet. There is a place. There is an
[2:46:01] inner chamber.
[2:46:05] There is an inner chamber.
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:23] There's a place where he want to have
[2:46:25] communion with us.
[2:46:28] There's a place where he want to take us
[2:46:30] where we can be able to meet the purpose
[2:46:32] of our life.
[2:46:34] The very purpose why he breath us
[2:46:42] into the chamber.
[2:46:45] [Music]
[2:47:00] All of you young people,
[2:47:04] all the little ones,
[2:47:09] we're beginning to to lost our young
[2:47:11] people. Why? Because
[2:47:14] what kind of a memorial that is set
[2:47:16] before them.
[2:47:20] They will have to come to that place.
[2:47:22] They will have to come and make choices.
[2:47:26] There's a whole lot that they deal with
[2:47:28] out there.
[2:47:32] When they go to school, they go to work.
[2:47:36] Lot of voices appealing. A lot of things
[2:47:38] appealing. They see things people do.
[2:47:40] The way they dress, the way they carry
[2:47:42] themselves,
[2:47:44] the kind of filthy music they listen to,
[2:47:46] the filthy things they see.
[2:47:51] [Music]
[2:48:03] Parents, are you thinking about what
[2:48:05] memorial
[2:48:07] are we building for our children?
[2:48:10] [Music]
[2:48:13] Are they seeing the loving father
[2:48:14] through us?
[2:48:21] Do they come into the room and find you
[2:48:23] praying?
