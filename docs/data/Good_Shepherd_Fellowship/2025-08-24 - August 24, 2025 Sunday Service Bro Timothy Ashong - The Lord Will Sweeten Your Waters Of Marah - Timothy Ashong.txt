It is good to be back home with you. And uh and uh what can we say? The Lord has been good to us. Amen. That's for sure. That the Lord has been good to us. He has never forsaken us.

No matter what we are going through, uh we assure that this boat is going to sail home safely. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This boat is going to sail home safely. Praise the Lord. You know uh there in in uh stop in in South Africa. Like I said, wanted to see my my friend now uh not being well and uh uh we uh he took us down to another place and we spoke on something we spoke here before. The dove has returned. But uh uh you know every word is different, every service is different. So we we spoke spoke in a kind of a different way. the wounded dove has returned. And it was just it was just amazing to see how you know out of God's word uh when brother Brandon talks about that dove that was used to carry messages during war you know it was shot through all the wings uh but the message landed home. Amen. And that is for sure uh uh that uh this message is going to reach home. Amen. Praise the Lord. We have a witness. We have a witness behind the curtain of time. They say, "Brother Brandon, we are resting on this." Amen. So, we already have an evidence behind the lamb. Amen. So, uh amen. Uh uh so we we greet you all again in the name of the Lord Jesus. We have brother Timon uh a friend and uh uh uh uh that is uh very very well part of us and uh uh here with us u a friend and an ed. the word I was looking for. I was looking for the word Ether. A friend and an Ether is here with us uh flying in from Canada uh running up. Uh he came uh for his uh uh medical visit uh and the doctor told him he had many more years to live. So let's give the Lord a hand of praise. So we can say to brother Tim, the Lord is not done with you yet. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. If there's if there's one man that can travel, my my my brother Tim, praise the Lord. I I always remember every time I call him back in Ghana, he says, "Well, I'm on my way to this place. I'm just coming from this place." I said, "Well, Lord, you just give that man grace." Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But uh uh you can only find joy in what God has called you to do. out of that every other part of life is somehow miserable, become stressful. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh uh we will continue our our report that we were bringing to you from uh from our little trip. Like I said, I'm I'm very poor in giving report, but I need to learn it. Amen. Because if we travel, we come back, we must be able to to give report. But before I do that, I bring a praise report from uh uh uh sister Carol, brother uh Wesley and sister Carol called. They wanted to be in service this morning, but she has uh a lingering cough that uh that's been bothering her, but the praise report there is that she doing fabulous in her knees. Amen. &gt;&gt; She don't think that she needed need replacement or a srain. She's walking stronger than ever before. So we thank the Lord for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. We thank the Lord for that. And uh and I I can see the same also of sister in lakes bed. She's doing well and uh you know uh uh she's uh she's uh uh getting up and down the stairs and even when nobody know that she's coming, you know, she's creeping up the stairs. So we thank the Lord for that. Amen. And praise the Lord. and I'm I'm sure that uh uh we will be seeing her back in church soon. So, praise the Lord. That's uh that's what we are looking forward to. Amen. Praise the Lord. But there was something that took place uh during the meeting that was very very tremendous and uh uh uh uh that's what I wanted to testify about this morning. It's kind of a two minutes video, but for some reason I'm not I'm not properly sending it. Maybe uh the way that I copied it is not good. Um so uh uh brother uh uh Emmanuel, you just show my photos. Let's let's run through them quickly so we can call the preacher. Praise the Lord. Once again, there's uh there's uh the uh Bible believers of Harrari Church. Uh there's uh assembly that was uh dedicated on uh on the weekend. Praise the Lord. And just like I said, we couldn't have the meetings in the building because of the crowd. So there's a tent back here. That's where they had the services because uh we had close to about 5,000 people on those tents. And man, the the services, what a marathon. I'm telling you. What a marathon. You You would not believe it. We had two preachers in the morning. Two preachers, I mean really preaching, not uh not greeting you. We get two preachers in the morning. And before those two preachers came, we had uh uh two other preachers that would come and greet you, you know, one one each service. So we had about almost a count of four messages in the morning, just in the morning. And then in the evening, we had another two preachers again. Man, I'm telling you, when they say drunk in the spirit, &gt;&gt; you just get drunk in the spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Man, my my goodness me. My goodness me. Praise the Lord. Uh I was trying to wash my myself and so I told myself, okay, I skip breakfast in the morning. Wow, that was the wrong thing to do. After the morning service, I said, "No, no. When I go back, I can keep that. But for now, I make sure I eat well in the morning because this is business. Is no joke." Glory be to God. My next photo pass once. I will come back to them. That's where I want to. So, yeah, that that was the tent. This was like an evening service. That was uh that was uh the tent that we were having the the services on the next one. Pass that one. And uh yeah, that's the next one. I think it should be a kind of a daylight. Okay, this was a daylight photo of the tent that we were having the meeting. And while these these services was going on, there was another service going on, another convention. You know, the brothers had the convention around the same time because uh they have so much crowd and uh uh and this one was not even the biggest. The next one was the biggest. The next one they were using an entire stadium and uh uh uh so I was supposed to go there the night uh uh uh Monday night, but I had to preach on Tuesday morning. So I feared no. Uh uh and it was good that I didn't go there because the brothers that went came back 2:00 a.m. in the morning. So let's go back to the the the other two photos back there. Those would just be uh the the first one, not that one, the first one. Okay. So I I copied a kind of a two minute video on the on the photo that is behind the preacher there. That's brother Joseph Jacosi. And there's uh uh uh he's the he's was our host. Now the the the was the the the morning service. Um this was um Sunday morning service. Sunday morning service. So Saturday night, Saturday actually was the dedication. So that was one of the longest day, longest service. I mean we had two preachers in the morning and then we had to go over to the church and do the dedication of the church and uh uh unveil the cornerstone and all of that. It was I mean there was just so much energy, too much people, so much energy. So in the evening service while these meetings were going on uh they had a tent on the other side uh that is uh uh greatly supported by voice of God and uh uh and and the the brothers in uh uh Zimbabwe has been uh tremendous support of voice of God. I mean years back I don't know if it is different but it was one of the countries that the local ministers themselves supported to build the voice of God library. They never took money from America. They never took money from the voice of God office. The local ministers themselves decided to build their tabernacle and uh uh and they have had good relationship with the voice of God. And uh so uh at these meetings uh the voice of God had their tent. They had their tent where the their tent were by the side and there uh on the side they had their uh where they their you know they have uh uh they have their uh how you call it now uh they're selling books and tapes and you know and different things that they were all selling there. So uh uh brother Joseph normally do that during his meeting. He would choose one night where he would play a tape you know just just in in honor of what voice of God is doing. So he will always choose I remember two years ago when I was there he did the same thing. There was one night he just told me brother one tonight we're going to play the tape. So uh uh if you want to be part of the service that's okay or else I can arrange for you to preach somewhere else. I said, "No, I'm not going anywhere. Let's uh it's all part of the meetings. Let's support it." So that night, they choose to play the message this day, the scripture is fulfilled. And I mean uh uh like I said with the energy, the worship and all of that. And the brother that uh that is uh heading the group there uh went to be with the Lord. So his son took over the responsibility. He came, you know, and then he gave me a little bit of a testimony and uh uh and then the service was set, the tape was played, and I I it was beautiful. Um I would say see if I can if I can just be able to get a little bit of a track after the service. Man, I played I played the two series of uh of this day, this scripture is fulfilled. I played the one after birth pain. I played the one that brother Brandon played when he came back to Jeffersonville. This one was the one back to Jeffersonville. I had play it. But I would tell you that that night it was completely different. And I think why it was different, it was because of the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It was because of the atmosphere. The people had worshiped. I mean uh I mean like I said the the people were just on fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were just on fire. The excitement, you know, uh the the the gladness. We have just dedicated the church, you know. Uh uh uh and then uh uh so yeah, here here we are. And uh uh yeah, if I knew I was just going to go back to the video on YouTube and just fast forward. I think that's what I should have done. And uh uh man, my brain is so slow. So slow, man. And uh but but during this during the service now, brother brother Joseph came up uh uh and then after the brother finish uh uh you know giving his testimony and uh you know and we prayed and he turned the service over uh for the tape to be played and why just at the beginning of the tape, brother Brandham started to to pray to start the meeting. one of the brothers in the in the assembly, you know, uh had just going to to to the building to use the the men's room. He was on his way back and then uh uh you know uh uh because everybody standing those that are outside are all standing up by their heads. So as he was coming towards uh uh he stood up and right over the tent that cloud that you see there back there you know that cloud there was hovering right over the tent. So he took his phone and took the picture but right at the time brother Brandon was was praying. So, he wanted to be reverenced, but yet he took the picture, slip his phone into his pocket by his head, and then uh after after praying, uh uh uh he thought he could get another, you know, uh uh picture of uh of the cloud, but it was gone. &gt;&gt; It was gone. So, uh uh uh the service went on. I mean after after the t service that night man such a presence such a presence I'm telling you such a presence that even the dead could be raised. Praise the Lord because the atmosphere was just so milky. Praise the Lord. It was just so milky. I mean even the tiredness in my body was gone. Amen. This that atmosphere was so good. I mean we prayed and you hear people screaming and shouting and crying you know it was just so wonderful wonderful presence we we had. So the next morning uh uh after the service the brother that told brother Joseph about this went to the voice of God representative and he wanted to tell the voice of God representative what he saw. Okay. He was not the one that took the photo. Now he's another one. You know, he he was trying to tell the uh brother Titani Jr. what he saw and he it was his brother. I I don't know. I don't know if you know I alone saw this but right over the tent. Then now the brother that took the photo came along to also show the photo to brother Titan what he took. This one is talking about what he saw. This one is talking about what he talked. So in the mouth of two or three let everything be established. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh it was it was just it was just so brother brother Joseph was testifying about this the next morning before the service that so that is I mean that was that was just beautiful. That was very comforting. That was very and and I mean the rest the rest is history. Praise the Lord. The rest is history because the the service just it just went to another level from there. I mean it just went to another level. I bet I know brother Gideon Kasunga was preaching one night and uh you know uh and then and then uh a young man walked right from in uh in the crowd with his crutches and just threw it on the pulpit and just went running out of the building. I mean it was just the service just went from from glory to glory. Amen. It was so amazing. But why this was uh very remarkable to me is they are the uh uh uh in the midst of everything you know that uh we have to deal with as message believers as people that believe the message of the hour and uh you know all the criticisms and everything that is out there and uh we still believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. Amen. and uh put my little quote up there. Uh that's part of my report. Let's read there. And uh uh and again for us as a local assembly uh you know because every local assembly is sovereign and uh under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, we choose to do you know what the Lord placed on our heart to do. So coming back from co we started you know having a little session of uh you know playing uh uh the voice of the prophet and uh one of my reason was to be able to encourage people because I'm telling you my voice is not vindicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I can't tell you that I am the voice of God to you. I can't say that. Praise the Lord. Any man that say that he's a liar. I'm not the voice of God to you. The voice of God to you is Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of God to us is Malachi 4. I'm not the voice of God to you. I'm I'm your pastor. Praise the Lord. And I hope you you you know I hope you uh you trust and have confidence in me that uh you know I'm preaching to you the message of the hour. I'm only telling you that there was there's a voice of God in the land. Praise the Lord. So uh uh uh you know and and you know and people will take on attitude you know against t service you know I can play tape home and most of the people that say that you know they hardly listen to praise the lord because I mean if you are really listening to to the to to the voice of the messenger I don't care whether they are playing it on the street corner you will stand to listen to it I don't care whether they playing it in the bus you will stand to listen to it you know because uh uh is is the voice that attracts the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so we do that year uh uh for our our Sunday school about some 30 minutes or so we play the voice and and I believe that God has given us few of the saints that uh that come early that that honor that you know some will listen to it on their you know on their phone at home and and uh uh and then some also don't even care. You don't even know that it ever happened. Praise the Lord. And uh uh but uh uh the thing about it is that like brother Brandon was saying here uh in this message part of prisoner he says uh and he was testifying uh also this group had a little battery six boat battery or something another uh uh playing the tape recorder and it was all sitting together about what is uh here tonight listening to those seals. I believe it was and while I was speaking the notice coming in the room came that same pillow of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. Move over where the tape recorder was and settled down over the top of it and they went and got a camera and took the picture of it. And just the same one, there it is hanging right there over it. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will vicate his word every time, anywhere, &gt;&gt; any place, &gt;&gt; honor any condition, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a very strong believer. that uh those tapes don't have uh uh nothing in them to heal you. I'm a strong believer. The tips don't heal. &gt;&gt; What heal is your faith &gt;&gt; when when when is is when when when you believe that what God did &gt;&gt; praise the Lord for those people coming through the line. When you believe that the angel of the Lord was able to have a man turn his back &gt;&gt; and discern the needs of the people, if God can raise your faith to believe that, praise the Lord, then the God that healed him will heal you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But if you are playing the tapes and you don't have no regard and you just have a disrespectful attitude, you know, you're just going to be just the way you are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just going to be the way you are. I seen people playing tape, fussing on the tap, or fighting on a tap and what whatever it is, you know. Uh uh but it's it's it's the expectation &gt;&gt; that brings the result. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the expectation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Jesus our Lord will say, "Be it unto you &gt;&gt; according to your faith." That's why he said, "Be it unto you I calling to your faith. Pick your bed up and walk." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine Jesus telling that man, "Pick your bed up and walk." And he's staying sitting there. I'm not able to. You're going to stay there. &gt;&gt; The comm was pick your bed up and walk. If you believe him, you pick your bed up and you go home. Praise the Lord. Let's stand on our feet this morning. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and let's get ready for the word of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I see uh uh uh Sister Miracle, I see you have uh some group of believers with you there and uh I want to greet you all. You came late, so I don't think the deacons didn't give me your names, but we're glad to have you come to uh fellowship with us. You are welcome and uh uh and we hope to get to know you after the service. Praise the Lord. Amen. Are you ready for the word this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. You feel like hungry people this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, beloved. And let's open our Bibles to the book of Exodus chapter 15. Exodus chapter 15 to read some few lines from there to encourage ourselves. Exodus 15. Let's read from verse 22. Exodus chapter 15. From verse 22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness of shore. And they went three days in the wilderness and found no water. And when they came to Mara, they could not drink of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter. Therefore, the name of it was called Mara. And the people m against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? And he cried unto the Lord. And Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters. The waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statue and an ordinance. And there he proved them and said, "If thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the I am the Lord that heal thee. And they came to Ellen where there were 12 words of water and three score and 10 palm phrase and they encamped there by the waters. May the Lord bless the readings of his holy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we please be seated? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; So we are together again &gt;&gt; and something good &gt;&gt; will be happening &gt;&gt; because Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just he's the preacher. &gt;&gt; We are just vessels in his hands. &gt;&gt; He's everything to us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we welcome you to the house of the Lord and just just open your heart. Don't look at the man. Just look to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's all to us and we are here because of him. &gt;&gt; We are here to show our appreciation &gt;&gt; for what he has done for us &gt;&gt; for saving our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this morning just to encourage ourselves, we want to speak on the Lord will sweeten your waters of marri. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we read in the scriptures, as the children of Israel in their journey came to this place in the wilderness in their journey and they came to a place where they were so thirsty and they had no water to drink and then after 3 days or three days journey they came to these waters of Mara. or waters. They saw this water. It became mara because of the bitterness. So mara means bitterness. But thank God that he change that bitter water to sweet water. So whatever bitter experiences you have today and you might be going through today, the Lord our God, &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, the God that we are serving is able to turn that bitter water to sweet water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what we are saying this morning, may God sweeten your waters of matter. You know there are sometime many things we don't understand and remember we are not asked to understand &gt;&gt; we are asked to follow him &gt;&gt; we are asked to obey him. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God telling the children of Israel, if you will diligently, if you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God want us to serve him with all our heart, before our might, with everything that is in us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to serve the Lord, you have to know how to serve him. &gt;&gt; You have to know his will. &gt;&gt; Because we cannot serve him in our own ways. &gt;&gt; You don't serve somebody the way you want you feel like serving. &gt;&gt; But we serve God the way he want us to serve him. &gt;&gt; Just like you are employed. So you do what your employer want you to do. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't just say well you employ me I want to do this. No he will appoint you or you what he wants you to do. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we read in the scriptures how when he separated the Israel from the rest of the nations. Amen. He separated them by calling Abraham. He separated Abraham from everybody. He said you come follow me. I want you to go here. I will show you where to go. Come out of this. Come out of that. Come out of this. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not Abraham that said I God say come out of this. Come out of this. So God still tells us what to come out from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember the word of the Lord comes to instruct us, &gt;&gt; to guide us. &gt;&gt; I mean to tell us what to do and what not to do. Amen. What God we want to please him. So to please him, he must let us know this is the way you can please me. So it is not what I want to do or what you want to do, but what he wants us to do at all times. &gt;&gt; Are we ready to do what he want us to do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At all times. Amen. So may God help us. Amen. And remember that we are not here by accident. We did not call ourselves. We did not choose ourselves, but he choose us. &gt;&gt; Amen. For it tells us in his way, ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What a privilege to be chosen by God. &gt;&gt; There were a lot of people in the days of Abraham, but God choose Abraham. &gt;&gt; And God said in Israel, listen, Jacob I love is our hate. &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; So nobody tells him what to do. So if we find grace to be choosing, we should be happy people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because God is a creator and I mean he controls everything and so he can do anything he wants to do. So if you have been choosing elected you should be thankful to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. So remember what we are speaking on this morning is that may God sweeten your waters of matter. &gt;&gt; You there are many things in this Christian life that we don't understand. And let me say the prophet of God said this Christian life seems to host a lot of disappointments. He said if one is not absolutely centered on Christ the word it seemed that the Christian life holds a lot of disappointments. Then he said, "But these disappointments are God's divine will happening to us." &gt;&gt; He said, "It may not seem so. It may not looks like God's divine will, but they are. &gt;&gt; For remember the scripture said that all things work together for good to those who love the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember this. The only way you we appreciate like we are in summer now we like it but after we get into another another seasons. So there are seasons in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we have day and we have night. You will not appreciate the day if you never go through the night. &gt;&gt; So there are dark times day and night. Right? So the same way in our journey on earth we go through many things but remember sometime you go through a tunnel but going through a tunnel is not the end of it &gt;&gt; when you are passing through a tunnel you it is it will be dark there &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; if you only passing through you will know that at the end there will be light &gt;&gt; if you don't stay in the tunnel &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; so you might come to a situation that you feel my where am I But if you continue to trust him, &gt;&gt; if you continue to walk on, &gt;&gt; you'll come to the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So here we are today. The only way you can appreciate the light is to go through the darkness. Like I always tell people, those from Africa or whatever, you know, there are places you don't have light or the light even is not stable. So many times it's dark. Oh, the light is out. Oh my goodness. But then the light comes, oh, he's here again. Praise the Lord. So you only appreciate the light because you've gone through the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here we are. Oh, you go through the summer, you go through the winters, you go through and sometimes ah it's too hot, it's too hot, everything seems to be so dry. Then the rain comes &gt;&gt; and everything changes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So listen, in our journey on earth, we go through times like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God allowed things to happen. He said, listen, to prove us &gt;&gt; to see what you and I will be doing. Not that he cannot do is God. He told the children of Israel, look, I made you to hunger and I made you to test to know what was in your heart. &gt;&gt; So God allow situation to come to us to know what is in our heart. &gt;&gt; To prove us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember again the prophet of God told us if you have a trial you find favor with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a trial, he show that God has confidence in you as he had in Abraham, as he had in Job. &gt;&gt; And he also told us the more loyal you are, the more the test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he also told us God has confidence in you. &gt;&gt; And he knows you will go through. &gt;&gt; For the Bible tells us that there is no temptation that is not come unto man. And God tells us in his word in every temptation he makes a way of escape. &gt;&gt; So even if you are going through temptation today know that there will be a way of escape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God said so &gt;&gt; and we believe what God says. &gt;&gt; So whatever corner you are remember he that brought the children of Israel to the Red Sea and made their way through the Red Sea, he also make a way through you when you are facing your &gt;&gt; Red Sea. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, sometimes God does not explain to us everything. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; he makes a way. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't just go by, will you explain? No, no, no. He doesn't do that. He only does it when the trial is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I always say to people, listen, some everyone of us, everybody has some kind of education or some kind of a training or some kind of things that we've gone through. Not. So even you are elementary or whatever you call it stage one or stage two or grade one grade two whatever at a point in time remember this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ever go to school or you ever go to whatever state there's a time that the teacher will speak to you &gt;&gt; or the lecturer will lecture you and talk to you and talk to you and talk but at a point too he doesn't speak again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? When you are being tested. Right? &gt;&gt; When you are being tested, the teacher or the lecturer does not speak. &gt;&gt; Even you try to smile with me, he thinks he said in the letter say I got put your hands down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you want to smile with me just why? when you are being tested &gt;&gt; and not that the lecturer is not is there is right there but because you are being tested it seems the atmosphere is not good &gt;&gt; why the letter is not laughing why it's not speaking to me because you have been tested praise the Lord &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; may God help us &gt;&gt; so sometime when you prayed you love God, you pray, you sort his face. Sometime you even fast and pray and about issues and about problems and about challenges and sometime it seems that there is nothing coming. &gt;&gt; And it's not because he has forgotten you &gt;&gt; but it's because he's testing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you don't have to be discouraged because remember this test and trials are normal part of the Christian life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Test and trials are normal part of the Christian life. &gt;&gt; For the scripture tells us that whomsoever the father loveth he chastises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says no destiny &gt;&gt; for this present time see to be joyous &gt;&gt; but he said afterwards &gt;&gt; it is the peaceable fruit of repentance of when you go through the trial you are happy &gt;&gt; and remember this &gt;&gt; your trials will be your testimonies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever trial you go through is your testimony. &gt;&gt; When we read about Abraham for 25 years that he was waiting for a child, &gt;&gt; the Bible said he waited patiently. &gt;&gt; It was a trial moment. &gt;&gt; But what is it? It is his testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I preached once on it. Your trial is your testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Without trial, you have no testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "The more lawyer you are, the more the test." &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; should we be lawyer? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for remember, without trial there is no promotion too. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, do you always want to remain in class one &gt;&gt; or stage one? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Do you want to remain a baby forever? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God does not want us to remain babies. &gt;&gt; He want us to become mature. Because if you give a child, if when since your mother gave birth to you, you have been that baby. &gt;&gt; Daddy have to be carrying you day and night. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't go God God does not want us to stay in one place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not just grow, you must be mature. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because growing without maturity is is a disease. &gt;&gt; It's sickness. &gt;&gt; It's abomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Aposto when I was a child I spoke like a child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When I became a man, I spoke like a man. I understood like a man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you are born as a Christian, you don't stay as a baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you are growing, you must be mature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God wants you to be mature &gt;&gt; to do things better than when you were 5 years. &gt;&gt; At the age of 10 you expected to do better than five years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if at the age of 15 you are doing like five years there is a problem. &gt;&gt; A serious problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So how are you doing today? Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As you have come this far, &gt;&gt; your behavior, your age &gt;&gt; and behavior, is it something that can be aligned? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's a time they will teach you how to wear your shoe. &gt;&gt; So when you are child, &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see a man like me wear white like this, &gt;&gt; there's a problem. &gt;&gt; A man suit and is wearing shoe like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, how are you conducting yourself in your Christian life? &gt;&gt; Are you still in a place that you they are teaching you how to dress? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; How to wear your shoes? &gt;&gt; What to do, what not to do, are we there or where are we today? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then they tell you, "No, no, the way you wear your sister and then you get offended. Bless you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't want us to stay as babies. &gt;&gt; God want us to grow &gt;&gt; and he want us to be mature. &gt;&gt; He want us to be understanding. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants us to love him. He want us to believe to know that he is in control over our lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What are we speaking this morning? May God sweeten your waters of matter. Amen. &gt;&gt; So along this journey in the journey of the children of Israel that we continue to talk about them did God choose them from the other nations &gt;&gt; and God did not want them to be like other nations because if he had wanted them to be like other nations he would not have separated them. That's right. &gt;&gt; So that is why when they came to a point and they said in the days of Samuel make us a king &gt;&gt; to be like the other nations. &gt;&gt; God was displeased. &gt;&gt; Even Samuel the prophet was displeased &gt;&gt; and some said what have I done? &gt;&gt; Have I offended you? Have I have I taken your money? Have I done? They said no you have not done anything. Then why? &gt;&gt; Well, we just want to be like the other nations. But have you forgotten that you have been separated for a purpose? &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why do you want to be like other nations? &gt;&gt; We have one example and that is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do we And God said don't worry somewhere. They have not forsaken you. Right? &gt;&gt; They have forsaken me &gt;&gt; from being their king. &gt;&gt; Is it easy when you are in a place of your life and oh that's my friend has forsaken me or this one has it's not a joyous thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Arab said it was not the nails that's what drove into the hands of Christ that killed him. &gt;&gt; He said Christ died out of a broken heart. for his own children to spit on him, &gt;&gt; for his own children to despise him. He died of a broken heart. Hallelujah. So it knows he knows what it mean to be somebody broken heart. That's why he heals our broken hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's our healer. Yes. &gt;&gt; That health all our diseases. &gt;&gt; And that's when you take his word, his word is a comfort, his healing. Because the Bible say Christ went through our face so that it would be the right kind of mediator. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's why he's the high priest that can be touched with the feelings of &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; There is none like our God. &gt;&gt; There is none like our Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible call him the great physician. &gt;&gt; The physicians of this life when they treat you, they take money out of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the great physician when they treat you, it takes nothing. &gt;&gt; Insurance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they minister to you, he give you good health and he gives you heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why the physicians of this life, they tried you and tried you and so that you don't know even how to pray. You want to see the doctor and the doctor comes and you are in trouble. They ask you first, do you have insurance? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Will your insurance be able to cover this? &gt;&gt; But thank God he gives us assurance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; We have a blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. Oh, what a fort of glory divine. He gives us blessed assurance. He gives us heaven. He gives us everything. The blessed Jesus gives him bless. &gt;&gt; The great physician. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How great is our God. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is &gt;&gt; to know that he's God. &gt;&gt; To know that he cares for us. &gt;&gt; Oh, he has promised you heaven. &gt;&gt; He has promises eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's so good to us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you come, you go to your physician today, you go to see your doctor today, they look for your insurance, look for this and that. But Jesus said, "Come unto me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you that labor &gt;&gt; and I have a lady? I will give you &gt;&gt; I'll take it free. Oh, hallelujah. Without money, &gt;&gt; without price. &gt;&gt; Whatever he gives without money, without price. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come unto me. &gt;&gt; Come. Come for life. Come for peace. Come for whatever without money, without price. &gt;&gt; If you don't want this, what do you want?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. May the Lord help us brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "Sometimes we have more problems when we become Christians. Why do we come to these troubles? What makes these things come? Why should Christians ever be perpressed? &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't everything just run perfectly for a Christian? &gt;&gt; Is everything going perfectly for you? &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't everything go perfectly for Christian? &gt;&gt; And somebody when you come to Christ, all your troubles are over. &gt;&gt; When you come to Christ, all your problems starts. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you come to Christ, every arrow, every gun in hell the devil has is pointed at you. &gt;&gt; But remember, don't forget that when all hell is against you, all heaven is behind you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, &gt;&gt; "I will build my church &gt;&gt; and the gate of air shall not prevail against it." Listen, the gift affair will fight you, &gt;&gt; but it will never pre &gt;&gt; But it will never pre &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; Satan will fight you. &gt;&gt; Devils will fight you, witches will fight you, sicknesses and diseases, challenges here and there, but it will never prevail. &gt;&gt; When you are built upon that rock &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's why it tells you the importance of revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Revelation of Jesus Christ. when you know who he is. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you get that revelation that Jesus is your savior, that Jesus is the healer, that Jesus is the way, that Jesus is the proof, that Jesus is the resurrection, if Christ will live, if Christ will abide, when you get that revelation of who Jesus is, the gate of hell will fight, but he cannot prevail against you. Remember the Bible says the gates of hell will fight against you. So be under expectation. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Be under expectation &gt;&gt; that the gate of heaven will fight &gt;&gt; that they will fight you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why would they fight you? &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan is cast down from heaven &gt;&gt; and we are going out there. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you don't meet him on your way, &gt;&gt; that mean you are walking with him. &gt;&gt; That mean you are going to the same direction. &gt;&gt; That's why you don't meet him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You look right, you don't you don't meet him. He's with you. &gt;&gt; You are in the same direction. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when you are going the opposite direction, &gt;&gt; then you're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; And when you meet him, &gt;&gt; then you have to fight him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The gate of fire &gt;&gt; shall not come against you. &gt;&gt; If you're a child of the king, if you're a daughter of the king, if you're a son of God, the gate of fire will fight you. But they will not prevail because we on the winning side. Jesus said, "I will never leave you and I'll never forsake you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The word of God is our comfort. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The people &gt;&gt; have been taught in scripture &gt;&gt; in a certain way. &gt;&gt; We're in Methodist church. We're in Anglican church. We were in the Catholic church where all kind of things is okay. Well, if you pay money like in the days of Luther, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; you pay money then you can go and sing. So you pay money to to sing, you pay advanced money to go and sing. &gt;&gt; What? What is that? &gt;&gt; Luther stood against it. &gt;&gt; Said this is not right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You is not right. The just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He was correcting the minds of the people. &gt;&gt; That was God speaking through Luda. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that is what every messenger comes to do &gt;&gt; to straighten our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To straighten our minds, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To correct us from manmade interpretation &gt;&gt; to the truth of thus say the Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So there might be a life or things you might be doing &gt;&gt; that they will tell you there is nothing wrong with it. &gt;&gt; The moderator tell you there is nothing wrong with it. The pope say there is nothing wrong with it. Oh like today a whole lot of nonsense that is going on &gt;&gt; and they say there is nothing wrong with it. It doesn't matter to have three four wives. Doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter to paint your face and do this. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; That's what you have been taught. But God sends a prophet &gt;&gt; to collect your thoughts &gt;&gt; to straighten your mind &gt;&gt; to tell you that what you have been told is error. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter for woman to wear pants or whatever they are. It does it's all right. God look at your heart &gt;&gt; and then God comes and tell you no. &gt;&gt; Out of your heart proceeds every evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what is ever in your heart is what comes out. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because the tree is known by the fruit it &gt;&gt; best. &gt;&gt; So God come to straighten your mind. &gt;&gt; And when God speaks, &gt;&gt; if you are, my sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So listen, &gt;&gt; when you talk about the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; the message of the hour is to meet the challenges of the age. &gt;&gt; So what is it? God comes to teach us. No, no, no. Not the way you have been taught. &gt;&gt; Yeah. As on the day of Pentecost, the people were religious people. But Peter preached that God spoke to them and told them, "Listen, if you don't run out, you are going to die." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "What shall we do? Repent. &gt;&gt; Be baptized &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. &gt;&gt; You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This Jesus &gt;&gt; whom you have crucified &gt;&gt; is both the Lord and the Christ." &gt;&gt; Yes. So the word come to straighten our mind. &gt;&gt; So listen saints of God, it is not what you want to do, &gt;&gt; not how you want to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is what God want us to do. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Abe and Ken offer sacrifice and one was rejected. &gt;&gt; Ken sacrifice was rejected. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He offer sacrifice. He went to church. He give offering. He give time. He did everything. But his offering was rejected by God because he didn't come by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God showed him the way. &gt;&gt; God told Cain, "Can't you see what your brother has done? Can't you see what Abel has done? Why don't you do it?" &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said &gt;&gt; Cain was too proud &gt;&gt; to humble his pride. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. that brought us the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So listen, when we come to church, we come to hear from God. &gt;&gt; We come so that if there is anything wrong with us, &gt;&gt; he will speak to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he will correct us that he will teach us his way. So you don't just come to church for come and sick. Lord, speak to me. &gt;&gt; Straighten me up. &gt;&gt; Because we want to please him. And the way to please him is to obey his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he told Israel, if you will diligently obey my voice, I will take it up for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will stand for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will fight your battles. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I will defend you. &gt;&gt; God promised that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he meant what he says. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why in the scripture when you read it sometime says right stand, don't fight. I will fight. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Leave it for me. &gt;&gt; Do you see where in the scriptures the enemy comes against Israel? They come against Israel and God says stand. And the enemies begin to fight themselves &gt;&gt; and they kill themselves. &gt;&gt; They don't understand but they just put confus. They begin to kill themselves. God fighting for Israel. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that even today God is still fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This recent battle they fought in Iran 12 day war. You know what is the Iranians said? They said Israel use power. They said Israel use power. Yes, Israel use a power but that's the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they don't understand. &gt;&gt; And listen, they are still facing trouble today. &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. If Jehovah God is fighting for Israel, &gt;&gt; Abraham's seat in the natural. &gt;&gt; What about Abraham seed &gt;&gt; in the royal, &gt;&gt; in the spiritual, &gt;&gt; hallelujah? &gt;&gt; May God help. Let the word of God &gt;&gt; sweeten your waters of marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you have a trial, you not think that, oh, God is against me. No, God is not against us. God is for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as he allowed Job to be tested. &gt;&gt; I always say it is not Job that call for test. It was God that come. &gt;&gt; It's God that decides. &gt;&gt; It's not we that decides. &gt;&gt; God decides. Let this happen. &gt;&gt; It was God that call the attention of the wicked. Said, "Have you considered my servant Job that there is none like him?" Oh, and the enemy said, "Is job serving God for nothing?" &gt;&gt; Is it not because you've made the edge over Job? You don't allow anything to touch him. And I like that very much that the devil himself knew there was a edge over Job. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm glad. But my question is, how did he know there was a edge over Job? &gt;&gt; He tried. &gt;&gt; He tried it. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he tried to touch Job. He couldn't touch it. Because listen, how will somebody know that this door is locked or not locked? &gt;&gt; Unless you try &gt;&gt; to open it. &gt;&gt; He tried. He might have tried to open it. It didn't work. &gt;&gt; He might have gone this, it didn't work. He might have gone this, it didn't work. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So listen, nothing can harm you. &gt;&gt; No power can touch you. &gt;&gt; Unless God allows it. Yes. &gt;&gt; And until God allows him, nothing can touch him. &gt;&gt; And that is why I believe &gt;&gt; until God has finished with me, &gt;&gt; nothing can take me out of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, I can fall down behind the pulpit and die. That should not be strange to you. &gt;&gt; If I fall down dead today is because he's finished with me. &gt;&gt; When and how, I don't know. &gt;&gt; But until then, nobody can take me out of here. And they say, "Well, nobody can take you out of here." &gt;&gt; You have to believe the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You have to stand on the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; May God help us &gt;&gt; to believe. &gt;&gt; And remember this, the prophet of God said, "Why should Christians why why should Christian be perpressed? Why wouldn't everything just run perfectly or perfect for a Christian? But it does it and we know that things doesn't always go the way you want it to go. Young man, you married here, you have your plans or young woman, you have your plans or you are expecting to get married and get a husband and get this and get children get and things doesn't work that way. The enemy can say you see &gt;&gt; all your fasting in your prayer where has he gone to &gt;&gt; fasting every day but what has come out of that &gt;&gt; and it tells you look at this one they don't even go to church they enjoying life better than you &gt;&gt; the song said tempted and trial we offer you to Why he should be dressed all the day long? &gt;&gt; Why there are others living about us? Never molested doing the wrong &gt;&gt; and the devil tried to punch you. Look, look at that. You so it doesn't work to even go to church. All this fasting and prayer, you want to dress like this only. What does he [Music] &gt;&gt; He does to discourage you. &gt;&gt; But let him also know. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your God reigns. &gt;&gt; Your God knows everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God told David, "Consider the end of the wicked. The wicked shall be cut off." &gt;&gt; Because David was wondering, "Why should the wicked one prosper? &gt;&gt; Everything goes fine with it." God said, "Hold on. &gt;&gt; Have you considered the end of that wicked? &gt;&gt; The wicked shall be cut off. &gt;&gt; The righteous shall inherit the earth. May God sweeten your waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, listen, the prophet of God said, "Sometimes and sometimes we have more troubles when we become Christians &gt;&gt; than we did when we were sinners." Because it is written, many are the afflictions of the righteous, &gt;&gt; but the Lord &gt;&gt; delivers sin from all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have more troubles, more challenges, &gt;&gt; than when you were not even a Christian. And the prophet said, "Strange feelings, strange things that will be that will be beyond our understanding. Strange things, strange feelings that will be our but the prophet of God said it is all done for our good." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We read about a man like Joseph. Did he understood what was happening to him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Why some brothers stand against him? Why some brothers sold him after he's lived such a righteous life in the house of Portifa and his wife and they know that they are blessed because of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. They testify that this boy since this boy came to this family things have changed. &gt;&gt; Then that same woman told a lie against him &gt;&gt; because he did not get Joseph to go the way she wanted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And because of that, she lied against you and she thought she was doing something to hurt him. &gt;&gt; Sister say, "You will not do what I want you to do. &gt;&gt; You will not fornicate. You will not commit adultery. You will not drink. You will not smoke. You will not go the way. You will not dress like they dressing. You will not cut your hair as a woman. You will not make your hair like a crazy person." Listen Americans, there are many things that you allow in this your nation. That is absolutely nonsense. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Compare your life with the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the word is going this direction, Bible say go this direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not like it, but I'm telling the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. There is a difference in the scriptures all throughout the life about Christians and non-Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said they were called Christians in Antioch before they saw the life they were living. &gt;&gt; They were not working like the people were doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is not what everybody approves, &gt;&gt; it is what God approves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Jesus is here &gt;&gt; and you are standing before Jesus, &gt;&gt; will you come that way &gt;&gt; after he has spoken and taught us what is right? If you don't know, you don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the woman was caught in adultery, they brought him to Jesus. We caught this woman in adultery. What do you say? &gt;&gt; Then he said, "The one that has not committed sin, &gt;&gt; let him through the first Everybody left. &gt;&gt; What did he say to the woman? Go and he said does anybody said the people are gone. Jesus said where are the people? He said they are gone. Okay, but go and see no more. &gt;&gt; Don't go like they are doing don't do it again. &gt;&gt; So when grace come upon our life &gt;&gt; grace gives us the when you are forgiven the standard is raised. Go and do it no more. &gt;&gt; Don't dress like them again. Don't walk like them again. Don't do what they are doing again because grace has appeared. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We cannot serve God the way we want to serve him or we think &gt;&gt; we must serve God according to his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus told his disciples I've given you example &gt;&gt; when they wash their feet. &gt;&gt; You call me Lord and master. He said that is who I am. If I your lord and master wash your feet, ye ought to wash one another's feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've given you an example. &gt;&gt; Whatever you were doing before, do this now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A new commandment I give unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We only serve God by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So listen brothers and sisters, forget about what they has been do they doing in the way. All the method these people and these people fine. Thank God. But you that God has called this thing. Sometime we don't know what grace is. Do you know that grace demands more than the law? &gt;&gt; The law said, "Thou shall not commit adultery." &gt;&gt; Grace says if you look upon a woman &gt;&gt; and you lust after her, you have already committed adultery. &gt;&gt; The Lord said that shall not kill. &gt;&gt; Grace says that if you hate a man without a cause, you have killed. &gt;&gt; So which one is which? We should not take grace to disgrace. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Young women, young men, mothers, fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I might look all to you, but that's okay. I'm not worried about what you think about me. &gt;&gt; I'm worried about what he thinks about me. &gt;&gt; That I always do what he want me to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was preaching back there at the convention that God has not changed his pattern. &gt;&gt; God's pattern has never been changed. &gt;&gt; God's order has never been changed. &gt;&gt; And the pattern is meant to be copied. &gt;&gt; You don't add to a pattern. You don't take out of the pattern. &gt;&gt; You stay with the pattern. You follow it. &gt;&gt; Compare your life and your with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brown said we must compare our experiences identify with Bible characters. &gt;&gt; The character you are living today, the life you are living today, which of the Bible characters you identify with? &gt;&gt; Which of Bible character are you going to identify yourself with? &gt;&gt; As a young man, as a young woman, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. Which of the Bible characters are we going to identify ourselves with? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't be sleeping. I mean, shake yourself, man. &gt;&gt; Why? Where are you looking? All these gossiping spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't speak to you. You are just looking around. When I'm talking to you, you're looking around. Amen. &gt;&gt; This brother is not correct here. I might not be correct to you, &gt;&gt; but I'm correct with God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; compare your life with the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With Bible characters. &gt;&gt; Amen. young woman like a Mary &gt;&gt; mama like a Elizabeth like a a Sarah like let's let's our examples &gt;&gt; like Abraham like Samuel &gt;&gt; like David compare your lives &gt;&gt; amen people that are walking they don't know where they are going they don't know their left and their right and you are following them &gt;&gt; people that has lost their way you are following them if the blind lead the blind they all go to ditch Jesus is the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You might not understand everything today. &gt;&gt; The water might be bitter today. &gt;&gt; Joseph God went through that &gt;&gt; but at the end God sweetened that water. &gt;&gt; Why he went to prison while those things were happening God was molding his character. Amen. &gt;&gt; God was preparing him for the throne. &gt;&gt; God was preparing so that the dream will come to pass. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because power without character is satanic. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God might allow us to go through many things just to mold your character. &gt;&gt; He might not explain. He doesn't to explain things. It is when it is done. Like when he told Abraham, "Take your son that you love, go and sacrifice him." He didn't explain it. He want to see our obedience. And you know what God said when Abraham went through that trial, God said, "Because you have obeyed my voice." &gt;&gt; He never understood it. &gt;&gt; It was not explained to him. &gt;&gt; But he knew there was a God that was guiding. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he committed his life and his way to the Lord. &gt;&gt; When God said take your son that you love and God didn't explain it. What is this? But the Bible say he obeyed. He didn't say God will you explain this to me. Why? &gt;&gt; And you know the one that told me out of no no he obeyed. He took his son let's go. We going to worship the Lord. Adam and son, we are going to sacrifice. We are going to worship you. Stay. How can you explain it? He didn't understand it. And there are many things you will not understand. &gt;&gt; But one day you will understand. &gt;&gt; You will turn that bitter water &gt;&gt; sweetness. &gt;&gt; Yes. There are many things today I don't understand and sometime like I've always said sometime the devil say why me you look at yourself say why me why should this happen to me my question why should it be you why shouldn't it be you do we tell God do we tell the potter how to mold us we He's suffering &gt;&gt; and he does what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; But don't forget that if you have a trial is a favor from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I've said it here before. I said I I was so sick and they thought well the man is gone. It's growing. &gt;&gt; I have to wear cita for 9 months. After that I have to wear pampers. Yes, I'm not ashamed to testify. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. For what reason? Who am I not to testify? Why should I be ashamed of what God has done? &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; I wear pumpers full. And when the doctor said, "Look, when they take the catheter from you, you going to wear pump because you'll be dripping." And I wear it and my goodness, big baby boy. &gt;&gt; The thing was just flowing. The pumpers will be full. &gt;&gt; But today as I don't wear pumpers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brothers. &gt;&gt; I could not even walk. I have to use this thing to be walk &gt;&gt; worker to be walking. &gt;&gt; I could not lift my feet as high as this. They have to hold me. [Music] &gt;&gt; When I sit down, I could not get up. They have to pull me. When I lie down, I could not turn this way. I could not think that to just lying down like this. My wife will have to wake me, pull me or somebody around to pull me. &gt;&gt; And all that I will say to myself, this also shall pass. [Applause] When the doctor told me he said listen your prostrate I become so big like this &gt;&gt; and that's why you cannot pee &gt;&gt; and he said there is cancer when your process is divided this way and that way there is cancer in one spot he said but don't fear I didn't fear &gt;&gt; no no no all that I said when is me cancer all that came to me Do you fear cancer? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember what the prophet of God said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you fear cancer? Reverend pray. Do you fear cancer? And he told her there is no virtue in fear. &gt;&gt; There is no virtue. &gt;&gt; Fear will wash in the case. &gt;&gt; I was having pains sleepers and sleepers. I could not even sit down. And Sundays I said no, I want to go to church. Mama, no stay. You can't stream. I said I want to go. I want to go. I go to church. I could not sit. I have to go and lie down in the office. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; But today, &gt;&gt; I'm standing here. &gt;&gt; I am running. I'm jumping. &gt;&gt; To the shame of the devil and the glory of Almighty God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to pity yourself. I don't No. &gt;&gt; Whatever God allows it for purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And today as I stand to talk, God is using that testimony to help somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I testify everywhere because I said, God, if you do, I will testify everywhere. &gt;&gt; And I'm never ashamed to testify. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I testify to the shame of that devil &gt;&gt; you are looking at. &gt;&gt; You better close your eyes because I'm going to know it. &gt;&gt; You close your eyes and close your ears because I don't care. I don't care about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy serving my Lord. &gt;&gt; You thought you got me. You didn't got me. &gt;&gt; God took me out of your hands. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Hey, listen. That devil hears so shame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; may God sweeten your waters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, &gt;&gt; when the children of Israel left Egypt, it was not Moses that choose the path for them. &gt;&gt; It was God that choose the path. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you're a believer, &gt;&gt; you have come to accept Jesus &gt;&gt; as your Lord and your Savior. &gt;&gt; Remember, he is the way &gt;&gt; and he's the truth and he's the life. &gt;&gt; You don't choose the path. &gt;&gt; You don't select the path. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you don't know the path. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't know the path. Only God knew the path. And God led them by the way of the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible said when they left the pillar of fire was right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Leading them by day and by night as the pillar of fire and by day as the cloud. &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat was leading them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you think God didn't know the way? God told Moses, Pharaoh will come after you &gt;&gt; and Pharaoh will think you are stranded. &gt;&gt; There will be sicknesses. There will be challenges and the devil will think you are stranded. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Laugh at him. &gt;&gt; Today maybe the devil think you are stranded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe today you have a problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil think there is no way for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have come to the Red Sea and you think there is no way. And the devil might be laughing just like the Egyptians were laughing. &gt;&gt; They said, "Look at them standard there. Look at them. There is no way. Look at them. Look at the sea before them. They cannot. They don't have any way. I'm going to kill them. We're going to get them back. We're going to banish them." &gt;&gt; And the Egyptian, oh yeah, we got them. They finished. &gt;&gt; Oh, they didn't know &gt;&gt; that the trap was for them. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They didn't know. Oh, look at it.
