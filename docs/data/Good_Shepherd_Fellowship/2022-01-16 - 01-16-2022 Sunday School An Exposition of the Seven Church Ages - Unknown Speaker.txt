[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so as an example to us and also to give the lie to rome's claim that st patrick was any more one of her than was joan of arc patrick was born to the sister of saint martin in the little town of bonavern on the banks of the river clyde one day while playing on the shoreline with his two sisters pirates approached and kidnapped all three where the sisters went no one knows but patrick his name was sucket was sold to a chieftain in northern ireland his duty was to tend the swine to do this he trained dogs so well trained were his dogs that many people came from far and near to buy them in his loneliness he turned to god and was saved then came the urgent desire to escape and return home to his parents he formed a plan that put his ability as a trainer to great use he taught the dogs to lie on him and cover his body carefully and not move until commanded thus one day when his owner sold several dogs patrick commanded the dogs except the leader of the pack to get into the boat the leader of the pack to which he then gave a secret signal ran off and refused to come aboard while the master and the buyer attempted to get the dog patrick got into the boat and signaled the dogs to cover him then with the whistle he brought the leader of the pack into the boat and on top of him since patrick was nowhere to be seen the buyer put up sail and moved out to sea after making sure that the captain was too far out to turn back patrick gave another signal to the dogs which caused them to riot then he came forth and told the captain that unless he would put him ashore at his home he would command the dogs to keep rioting and he would take over the ship however the captain was a christian and when he heard the boy's story he gladly put him ashore at his home there patrick went to bible school and returned to ireland whereby the word and the power of god in many signs and wonders he won thousands to the lord at no time did he ever go to rome nor at any time was he commissioned by rome the truth of the matter is that when rome finally gained a foothold on the island and when they saw the time was opportune they killed over one hundred thousand christians who had over the years grown out of the original group that had come to the lord under saint patrick about sixty years after the death of saint patrick columba was born in county donegal north ireland to the royal family of fergus he became a brilliant consecrated scholar committing to memory most of the scripture god called him in an audible voice to be a missionary after he had heard the voice of god nothing could stop him and his miraculous ministry has caused many historians to acclaim him next to the apostles so great was his ministry with the supernatural signs following that some especially students in rome have thought the accounts were exaggerated in one of his missionary journeys as he approached a walled city he found the gates barred against him he lifted his voice in prayer that god might intervene and allow him access to the people in order to preach but as he prayed the court magicians began to harass him with loud noises he then began to sing a psalm as he sang god so increased the volume of his voice that he drowned out the cries of the heathen suddenly the gates burst open of their own accord he entered in and preached the gospel winning many to the lord on another occasion when he was also shut out from a village as he turned away to depart the son of the chief suddenly became violently ill even unto death saint calamba was quickly sought after and recalled when he prayed the prayer of faith the boy was instantly healed the village was then opened to evangelization by the gospel the pure gospel that was preached by columba and his fellow workers spread over the whole of scotland turning it to god it also overflowed into ireland and over northern europe his means of spreading the gospel was one wherein perhaps twelve men under a leader would go into a new area and literally build a gospel-centered town amongst these twelve men would be carpenters teachers preachers etc all wonderfully versed in the word and holy living this little colony was enclosed by a wall soon this enclosure would be surrounded by students and their families in their own homes learning the word and preparing to go out and serve the lord as missionaries leaders and preachers the men were free to marry though many did not in order to serve god the better they remained free from state help and thereby steered clear of politics instead of ever attacking other religions they taught the truth for they believed that the truth was weapon enough to accomplish the ends that god had in mind for them they were absolutely independent of rome saint columba was the founder of a great bible school on the island of high off the southwest coast of scotland when he went there the island was so barren and rocky that it could not bear enough food for them all but columba planted seed with one hand while he held the other aloft in prayer today the island is one of the most fertile in the world from this bible-centered island went forth mighty scholars endowed with wisdom and the power of god when i read the history of this great servant of god and the wonderful work he did it saddened my heart to find that the papal power lusting to bring all men into its grasp came and eventually defiled these mission fields and destroyed the truth as it was taught by columba salutation revelation 2 18 these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass the revelation of godhead to the thyatirian age is that jesus is the son of god once in the days of his flesh he was known as the son of man but henceforth we know him no more after the flesh he is no longer the son of man the great prophet who in himself gathered together all prophecies the only begotten is back in the bosom of the father now we know him after the power of the resurrection he is risen and has taken unto himself his mighty power and is above all and overall to the praise of his own glory his glory will he not share with another his leadership over the church he will not surrender to any man he looks down upon thyatira and here he sees in that city and in that fourth age the honor which belongs to him alone bestowed upon another his eyes blaze with the fire of wrath and judgment as he sees apollo revered as the son of god when he alone is the only begotten of the father how awful must be his judgment upon the religion of the thiatarian age wherein the church members like the pagan worshipers of the son of god apollo the son of zeus elevate a human ruler to adoration backed by the power of the state for that is exactly what he saw the roman catholic church fully immersed in idol worship based upon the rights of the sun god apollo had elevated a man to actual deity pope through the marriage of the church to the state for thomas aquinas and alvarez pelagius formulated and stated that the pope seems to those who view him with the spiritual eye to be not a man but a god there are no bounds to his authority he can declare to be right what he will and can take away from any their rights as he sees fit to doubt this universal power leads to being shut out from salvation the great enemies of the church are the heretics who will not wear the yoke of true obedience there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus the son of god first timothy 2 5 but the pope of rome has changed the word he made it one mediator between god and man not men so now he mediates between the mediator and man but there is no other mediator save the son the pope pronounces salvation through the church of rome but there is no salvation except through the son of god no wonder the eyes blaze in fiery judgment no wonder the feet are like fine brass as he stands ready to trample into powder and dust the wicked kingdoms of this world thank god for those strong feet of brass they have passed through the judgment for us they are now our foundation for what he gained is ours we stand identified in him jesus the son of god it was in this age that we witnessed the rise of mohammedanism that denied the son of god and determined death upon all who called themselves christians it was also in this age that the false church deified the first commandment of almighty god and launched swiftly into breaking the second commandment for it put its pope in the place of jesus christ and established and enforced idol worship to such an extent that it meant death to those who refused the icons a place within the church under empress theodora alone from 842 to 867 over 100 000 saints were killed because they reputed the images of no value surely this age must repent or lose all there stands the lord of glory god very god his word cast aside his person rejected but human hands and human hearts cannot depose him let them deny him he remaineth faithful fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and when i come with feet of brass and flaming eyes i will recompense judgment is mine i will repay saith the lord the eulogy revelation 2 19 i know thy works and love and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first here again we find the same introductory remarks i know thy works the son of god himself said believe me for the very work's sake he put an emphasis on his own works while on earth the works that he did were ordained of god to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit in the apostle paul said for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath ordained that we should walk in them ephesians 2 10 these works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in god for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the lord i believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of god is for men to do evil works and then say that they are doing the will of the lord that is what the bishops and popes and the hierarchy of rome were doing they were killing maiming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those true believers shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor god even though many died for it in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified god yes sir if you are a christian you are going to do what is right your works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but god sees you and you will do his will even if it costs you your life i know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before god and neither is our service paul speaking to the corinthians said without love i am nothing and whatever i do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of god that was shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost that love in their hearts was god's love for his own jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have love for one another the pagans who saw the lives of the early christians said behold how they love each other john said everyone that loveth is born of god first john 4 7. i want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the laodicean or last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of god we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit it is time to draw an eye to god and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us in those dark and dreadful years the true vine held its love for god and love of the brethren god commanded them for it i know your service jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here is what he said only history will prove the truth of that dictum that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by god when they have not used their wealth right but look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know now what i am doing but you will know hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do he became a servant in order that god could elevate him to the highest heights and one day in the judgment of the saints we are going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of the lord it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the dawn till setting sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when all of life is over and our work on earth is done and the role is called up yonder i'll be there i know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamos you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commanding them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in james one three the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith romans 5 3 tribulation worketh patience how highly god regards this outworking of our patients is seen in james 1 but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing god's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development how highly god has commanded these saints of the dark ages patient as lambs led to the slaughter lovingly faithfully they served god that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward i know thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age and the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory i know thy works and the last to be more than the first now as we have already said this age is called the dark ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history it was the age of pope innocent iii who claimed that he was the vicar of christ supreme sovereign over the church and the world who instituted the inquisition which under his direction shed more blood than at any other time except in the reformation it was the age of pornocracy the rule of harlots sargarius iii had a mistress and filled the papal choir with paramours and bastard sons and turned the papal palace into a den of robbers anastasius the third was smothered to death by morogia who was mistress to sargeras john the eleventh was morogia's illegitimate son john the twelfth was the grandson of morocia and he violated widows and virgins and was killed while in the act of adultery by the woman's enraged husband it was the age of papal schism for two lines of popes one ruling from avignon and the other from rome cursed and fought each other these popes were not only guilty of immoral sex acts fathering scores of illegitimate children committing sodomy etc but were guilty of selling priestly offices to the highest bidders it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few believers labored more fervently as the darkness increased until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms their labors were so fervent but they paved the way for the oncoming reformation therefore as the word says concerning that age your last and of the age works are more than the first the word thyatira has various meanings amongst which is continual sacrifice by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is a continual presentation of the sacrifice of christ that is an excellent thought but it might also mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the true believers of the lord surely these styatyren saints were the cream of the crop full of the holy ghost and faith created unto good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving their all as a sweet sacrifice unto the lord the rebuke revelation 2 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest tolerate that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols now with this verse i want you to drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth i have been bringing to your attention all along and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts i have been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are churches and it states just as plainly that some of these churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of god and they being god fearing judge themselves that they be not judged now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 7 how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a is a that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in god's order that the tares grow up with the weed and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other he is rebuking he has told what is right with the true believer now he warns what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the lord that woman jezebel the apostle james showed us the course that sin takes james 1 14-15 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and in time heist then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages as sin started in nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little notice deeds of the nicolaitans from the deeds it went to a doctrine from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it goes to its own prophetess teacher and so it travels on until it will find itself in the lake of fire for that is exactly where it is going to end up in the second death [Music] you
