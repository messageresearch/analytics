[49:31] summary of the travel every time they do
[49:34] that and I'm not I'm not very well
[49:37] caught that way praise the Lord
[49:41] but uh what what I want to bring tonight
[49:44] is now actually from the trip and uh
[49:49] but there was one thing that took place
[49:50] on the trip that uh there for a long
[49:53] time uh
[49:56] didn't Witness
[49:58] uh we we were ministering on Sunday uh
[50:03] for brother
[50:05] tizora he's he's in another city
[50:09] I should have gone for his song wedding
[50:12] he wanted me to come and help him
[50:14] officially his son wedding and pray for
[50:17] them but I couldn't go at the time he
[50:20] wanted to so when this brother asked
[50:24] that we come and do his meeting then I
[50:27] asked the brother if if he will allow me
[50:29] to to be able to take one service for
[50:32] brother to Zora so it works out that
[50:36] um
[50:37] you know we could do that so we were
[50:40] there ministering for them on Sunday we
[50:41] had a we had a good we had a good
[50:44] service the Lord blessed the service and
[50:46] uh
[50:51] uh and then when we came
[50:52] you know we came to uh to the end of the
[50:55] service I mean uh it was it was almost
[50:58] like a like an outpouring I was actually
[51:01] speaking that night on the cycle of
[51:05] Revival and death I have spoken on it
[51:07] here but uh I was talking actually on in
[51:12] in another sense of breaking the cycle
[51:15] you know because uh
[51:19] we know that uh and and sometimes some
[51:23] of these things can be it can be amazing
[51:25] in a way that the Lord you know actually
[51:28] actually can move now I use this code uh
[51:32] at the time that we spoke about it this
[51:34] was the very same code that I use but
[51:37] something caught my attention while I
[51:39] was preaching that morning
[51:43] uh
[51:50] is from the Ephesian Church age I've
[51:52] just just follow me and I didn't I
[51:55] didn't say my not there but I mean if if
[51:57] they have it they can be able to project
[51:59] it but uh
[52:02] where Branham says that cycle of Revival
[52:06] and death has never failed
[52:10] the cycle of Revival and death has never
[52:13] failed
[52:15] all you have to do
[52:19] is recall this last move of God in the
[52:23] spirit
[52:24] when men and women dress like Christian
[52:26] went to church pray all night talk to
[52:30] the street Conan and wearing a shame of
[52:34] the manifestation of the spirit now when
[52:38] brother Branham said all we have to do
[52:41] is to recall the last move of God he was
[52:46] pointing to Pentecost
[52:49] amen he was pointing to Pentecost he was
[52:52] pointing to the effect of Azusa
[52:56] praise the Lord
[52:58] now I I never caught that at the time I
[53:02] I preached that year but uh uh
[53:07] I think maybe it was it was maybe the
[53:09] the inspiration I was honored but but
[53:11] let's let's read a little bit he says if
[53:15] you have
[53:16] all you have to do is to recall the last
[53:19] move of God in the spirit when men and
[53:21] women dressed like Christian went to
[53:23] church pray all night took to the street
[53:25] columns and we're in a shame of the
[53:27] manifestation of the spirit
[53:29] they left their old their churches and
[53:32] worshiped in homes or all store building
[53:35] they they hire reality but it wasn't too
[53:40] long a time until they begin to get
[53:44] enough money to build fine new churches
[53:48] praise the Lord
[53:50] uh
[53:51] they put in a choir instead of singing
[53:56] unto God for themselves
[53:58] they put gowns on the choir they
[54:02] organized a movement
[54:04] and Reign it by men amen the different
[54:07] organization in the church
[54:09] they soon begin to rebooks that were in
[54:13] fact to read
[54:14] they let down the bar and goats came in
[54:18] and took over
[54:20] The Cry Of Joy was gone
[54:24] the freedom of the spirit was gone
[54:27] oh they kept on with a form
[54:32] above the fire had died down
[54:37] and the Blackness of arches
[54:40] is about all that is left
[54:45] praise the Lord
[54:47] now so uh uh
[54:53] like I said
[54:55] speaking on this year that I never and
[54:58] it never come to my mind but what I was
[55:01] what the burden that I had on my heart
[55:03] when I was I was preaching this uh on
[55:06] Sunday was uh breaking out of
[55:11] the Revival of psycho I mean the cycle
[55:15] of Revival and death
[55:18] so almost like breaking the cycle
[55:22] praise the Lord
[55:23] amen so uh
[55:26] uh
[55:27] [Music]
[55:30] Let's uh let's go to the book of
[55:33] of Trinity this is this is now where we
[55:35] we uh taught that we will speak from for
[55:39] tonight but uh let's let's just uh
[55:54] praise the Lord
[55:56] let's go to the book of Trinity
[56:01] let's read second Timothy chapter 2
[56:03] verse 10. that's that's something that
[56:06] we have there with here before but just
[56:09] to see how the Lord was able to help us
[56:12] when we were away
[56:15] second Timothy let's read from verse 7
[56:18] second Timothy chapter one
[56:22] verse 7 for God have not given us the
[56:26] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[56:30] and of some mind
[56:32] be be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[56:37] testimony of Our Lord
[56:39] none of mean his praising above be thou
[56:42] partaker of the of the afflictions of
[56:46] the Gospel I calling to the power of God
[56:50] who have saved us
[56:53] and call us with and holy calling
[56:57] not according to our works
[57:01] but I call into his purpose and Grace
[57:06] which was giving us in Christ Jesus
[57:10] before the foundation of the word
[57:14] praise the Lord
[57:15] now so reading on this verse we we we
[57:19] went back a little bit and saw how
[57:22] Israel sprung Grace in Exodus chapter 19
[57:26] we spoke on that year too all that the
[57:29] Lord have spoken we will do or that the
[57:32] Lord have said we will do that was a
[57:34] filter mistake that Israel made we we we
[57:37] we touch on that a little bit so then
[57:39] that brought me to this subject
[57:41] realizing that uh uh he will have saved
[57:46] us he have called us to a holy calling
[57:48] not according to our works but I call
[57:51] into his purpose in his grace which was
[57:54] giving us in Christ Jesus before the
[57:57] word begin praise the Lord
[58:00] but it's now made manifest by the
[58:04] appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who
[58:09] have abolished death
[58:11] now so that's where my inspiration was
[58:14] coming from when I was talking on the
[58:16] cycle of Revival and death
[58:19] there is a time where death was
[58:21] abolished
[58:24] praise the Lord so if every Revival had
[58:28] a psych if every age had a cycle of
[58:32] Revival and death
[58:34] there there must be a time where that
[58:38] cycle must be broken
[58:42] praise the Lord so what I was showing uh
[58:45] uh or I was I was laboring on them
[58:48] preaching was that um we look at the
[58:51] first Revival we look at every Revival
[58:53] and how they went and in a time of
[58:56] Revival and uh and then they came to a
[58:59] time of lukewarmness and actually they
[59:01] came to a time to organize and now we we
[59:05] look at the church ages but then we
[59:08] realize there is a reason why uh uh uh
[59:14] um
[59:15] there's a reason why the message has
[59:18] called us out of denomination
[59:21] praise the Lord
[59:22] the calling of the Bride is the breaking
[59:26] of the cycle
[59:28] praise the Lord
[59:30] now if it is the breaking of the cycle
[59:33] then this revival is not going to die
[59:39] why because the message will not be
[59:42] denominated
[59:46] praise the Lord amen churches are going
[59:49] to die people around the message are
[59:52] going to die but the message this
[59:54] revival
[59:57] amen this revival is the breaking of the
[1:00:00] cycle
[1:00:05] are we together
[1:00:07] amen now so what I did was that um uh I
[1:00:12] I I I use this
[1:00:16] I use this that Paul is talking about
[1:00:18] here how uh how the appearing of our
[1:00:22] Lord Jesus
[1:00:24] who has abolished death and have broad
[1:00:29] life and immortality
[1:00:31] to light through the gospel
[1:00:34] praise the Lord amen so just like how
[1:00:38] death
[1:00:39] took uh uh uh Moses and death took
[1:00:43] Samson and death took all the Great Men
[1:00:47] Through the Ages praise the Lord but
[1:00:51] when it came when death met our Lord
[1:00:53] Jesus amen
[1:00:55] he conquered there praise the Lord he
[1:00:58] took the stain out of death
[1:01:01] amen and naturally what he did was he
[1:01:05] brought immortality
[1:01:08] praise the Lord
[1:01:10] Hallelujah
[1:01:11] in a sense that he resurrected
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:19] and then uh uh uh he stepped into uh uh
[1:01:26] uh uh a glorified body
[1:01:30] praise the Lord
[1:01:33] that's what saint Luke chapter 24 show
[1:01:35] us uh uh he got into a Celestial body
[1:01:39] when he resurrected a bother that he
[1:01:42] could be identified
[1:01:46] praise the Lord and and and Merit
[1:01:49] identified him he says don't touch me
[1:01:53] I have not ascended yet
[1:01:56] but then after he ascended and uh and
[1:02:00] and and presented himself he also came
[1:02:03] uh into a glorified body
[1:02:07] and he walked with the man on the road
[1:02:10] of of Empires and he went down and and
[1:02:13] then uh the big bread and and and and
[1:02:16] you know he has supper with them and and
[1:02:20] uh uh pretty soon uh uh they saw him
[1:02:25] and the Bible says
[1:02:27] he finally she took off
[1:02:31] why the disciples were gathered together
[1:02:34] he came into their mess he never needed
[1:02:36] a key
[1:02:38] praise the Lord
[1:02:43] so Paul now is trying to make us to see
[1:02:47] something year that uh uh uh uh bar the
[1:02:53] appearing by the coming of our Lord
[1:02:55] Jesus what uh uh uh uh Christ brought us
[1:03:00] and what was demonstrated in his
[1:03:04] ministry then in his life was very very
[1:03:07] important now so I point out to the
[1:03:09] Saints to make them to for us to realize
[1:03:12] that's the reason why in this age God
[1:03:16] gave us an Evidence of a life behind the
[1:03:20] curtain of time
[1:03:23] good
[1:03:24] praise the Lord
[1:03:26] amen there are many many men has uh has
[1:03:30] half trans people have had uh uh
[1:03:36] uh they have had uh
[1:03:40] after death uh storied in uh you know
[1:03:43] died and traveled to heaven and you know
[1:03:46] in in all the different things that uh
[1:03:49] you know people have had whether it was
[1:03:51] dream or whether you know it was leaving
[1:03:54] their body trance and all of that but
[1:03:57] you will see that uh you know it was it
[1:04:00] was very important
[1:04:03] in our age like like even the Apostle
[1:04:06] Paul he he he he had to he says what I
[1:04:09] was in this body of out of this body I
[1:04:12] cannot tell
[1:04:14] praise the Lord but he he visited the
[1:04:16] tear heavens
[1:04:20] and there were things that he could not
[1:04:22] explain he I mean he could not talk
[1:04:24] about now you see but uh all of those
[1:04:28] men through all the ages that the
[1:04:31] hardest experience who have not had this
[1:04:34] who have not had that experience except
[1:04:37] our Lord Jesus Christ rented the Veil
[1:04:41] amen he rented the bill
[1:04:45] he abolished death for the Believers
[1:04:51] so for us death do not exist
[1:04:57] is just a transportation
[1:05:01] praise the Lord
[1:05:03] and not only that but he also
[1:05:07] brought immortality
[1:05:11] to light
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:18] now because he could leave those uh uh
[1:05:22] disciples
[1:05:24] on the road of in Myers
[1:05:27] vanish out of the aside before you
[1:05:29] realize he's entering the other meeting
[1:05:31] because he could do that Philip could do
[1:05:35] the same
[1:05:41] praise the Lord
[1:05:43] Philip could do the same Philip left a
[1:05:45] Revival in Samira
[1:05:47] and the Bible said he was he was taking
[1:05:50] he was transported
[1:05:53] to go and meet the Ethiopian eunuch
[1:05:55] traveling on the Run
[1:05:57] what was that
[1:06:01] it was immortality
[1:06:09] praise the Lord
[1:06:15] are we together
[1:06:17] now so uh uh uh but what we were we were
[1:06:21] working on we were laboring on with the
[1:06:23] Saints was to show that how the the the
[1:06:26] cycle
[1:06:28] of Revival and death it hit every Church
[1:06:31] age
[1:06:32] it hit every Church age
[1:06:35] God would take the people through a
[1:06:37] Revival
[1:06:39] you know like just like brother Branham
[1:06:41] says you know uh uh they're dressed like
[1:06:43] Christian they live like Christian they
[1:06:46] pray all night and everything
[1:06:50] and then after a while they were
[1:06:52] organized and and and and the Revival
[1:06:54] fire would go away from them
[1:06:56] praise the Lord every every age went
[1:06:59] through that
[1:07:02] praise the Lord but the reason why God
[1:07:05] sent a prophet the reason why the seals
[1:07:08] were open
[1:07:09] like like like we read that code but
[1:07:12] Abraham says uh that the man of Christ
[1:07:14] is in the bride she knows what to do
[1:07:16] with the word
[1:07:18] praise the Lord
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:24] and then we also spoke I'm coming back
[1:07:26] to my to my to my testimony we also talk
[1:07:29] about uh I use a a code there from uh
[1:07:33] how can I overcome
[1:07:35] you know showing the church is not what
[1:07:37] to overcome but how to overcome now so
[1:07:43] brother Branham says overcoming means
[1:07:45] keeping alive
[1:07:50] and so I was I was telling the church I
[1:07:52] said that's how this bride that's how
[1:07:56] this bride is going to break
[1:07:58] the cycle of death
[1:08:02] praise the Lord
[1:08:05] because you have to realize brother
[1:08:07] Branham says you know what uh he says
[1:08:10] when you see the the the the ocean it
[1:08:12] gets is getting rough and and you know
[1:08:15] is is bubbling in itself when the ocean
[1:08:18] is having Revival he says all it's doing
[1:08:21] is just pausing itself it's trying to
[1:08:23] get all the trash away the water in the
[1:08:27] ocean does not increase
[1:08:29] their waves get rough it goes up it goes
[1:08:32] up and down all it's trying to do is
[1:08:34] just to it's just to push itself clean
[1:08:36] itself of all of the trash put it on the
[1:08:39] shore
[1:08:40] he says that's what Revival is to the
[1:08:43] church
[1:08:44] that's what Revival is
[1:08:47] every time we take inventory of our life
[1:08:50] every time the grace of God help us to
[1:08:52] identify things in our life and why is
[1:08:55] it far so we can keep it alive
[1:09:02] praise the Lord so we can keep alive so
[1:09:05] you see uh uh people uh uh look for the
[1:09:10] the the the the
[1:09:14] uh what how can I call it that the the
[1:09:17] the the the emotion the the the the
[1:09:19] manifestation the airplane manifestation
[1:09:22] and all of that oh you know why it will
[1:09:26] be a Revival if we get back on the
[1:09:28] street corner it will be everybody all
[1:09:30] of those things are wonderful
[1:09:32] praise the Lord and we can do all of
[1:09:34] those things and we can stay go flat
[1:09:44] but for this bride she's going to keep
[1:09:46] the word alive in her heart
[1:09:49] no matter what we go through the the
[1:09:52] different phases of doctrines that have
[1:09:54] swept through the message that different
[1:09:57] men that has raised up with name and
[1:09:59] call themselves eight messenger they
[1:10:01] have all come and gone but the brightest
[1:10:03] stay here
[1:10:08] praise the Lord
[1:10:11] amen this bride is called out to break
[1:10:14] from the cycle of Revival and death
[1:10:22] why because the opening of the seal has
[1:10:25] abolished death for the bride
[1:10:32] praise the Lord so that's what we were
[1:10:35] talking about so it was a little bit uh
[1:10:37] uh uh on on the end of Breaking the
[1:10:40] cycle
[1:10:41] that's what we were we were actually
[1:10:43] speaking on so we uh uh and and you know
[1:10:47] and it's just like that you know I mean
[1:10:49] the Lord blessed the services and it's
[1:10:51] always a blessing to uh to a pastor in
[1:10:54] the local church when a visitor comes
[1:10:57] and then he comes start preaching and he
[1:10:59] just get right in the midst of what the
[1:11:01] church has been dealing with like the
[1:11:03] Bible says what the spirit has been
[1:11:06] speaking to the church
[1:11:07] praise the Lord
[1:11:09] so I think the Holy Ghost was dealing
[1:11:12] with the people on uh on on setting few
[1:11:15] things and I think all the all the
[1:11:17] services were the same
[1:11:18] and uh and and and right after that I
[1:11:22] mean we just we just had a such an
[1:11:24] awesome time and I mean a good
[1:11:26] atmosphere uh the people went into
[1:11:29] praying and uh and the Lord just sent a
[1:11:32] message uh uh uh with one of the sisters
[1:11:36] that was that is blessed with the gift
[1:11:37] of tongues and interpretation and it
[1:11:40] just it just kind of a re-echo
[1:11:42] everything that Holy Ghost was already
[1:11:44] dealing with the church with
[1:11:48] so that was just beautiful
[1:11:50] it was beautiful and it was also
[1:11:53] edifying praise the Lord amen it was it
[1:11:57] was it was also edifying to know that uh
[1:12:02] you know we we went
[1:12:05] to label with the with the pastor there
[1:12:07] what what actually he was dealing with
[1:12:09] so we had a beautiful time
[1:12:11] we had a good time
[1:12:13] praise the Lord
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:18] so uh what what I wanted to share
[1:12:20] tonight is uh uh I wanted to share a
[1:12:24] little testimony
[1:12:25] there there that that caught my mind on
[1:12:29] what I read from Genesis uh Terry
[1:12:32] tonight
[1:12:35] I will get back to that but uh this
[1:12:38] testimony is about uh a preacher
[1:12:42] it's about a preacher in in Scotland
[1:12:46] now he was he was one of uh
[1:12:50] uh he was one of the men that voted the
[1:12:54] Titanic when the Titanic sank
[1:12:57] and uh
[1:13:01] but uh
[1:13:05] John Harper is his name
[1:13:09] now there is there is there is something
[1:13:11] in uh in his testimony that that Drew
[1:13:15] that draw my mind today's uh of what I
[1:13:18] want to share with you before we we go
[1:13:20] into praying
[1:13:22] now so he came from a from a very from a
[1:13:27] very the uh struggling family and uh at
[1:13:32] the age of 13 you know he gave his heart
[1:13:34] to the Lord
[1:13:35] and even even uh from a young age
[1:13:39] uh you know he's uh his his heart was
[1:13:42] always burdened to do something for the
[1:13:44] Lord so he started preaching he started
[1:13:46] preaching uh uh from a very as a
[1:13:50] teenager
[1:13:53] and uh uh he he was also uh uh you know
[1:13:58] impacted by the the Welsh Revival and uh
[1:14:03] uh he was he was during that time so uh
[1:14:07] um John Harper he used to do street
[1:14:11] preaching you know he was not too much
[1:14:14] of uh you know a Pulpit guy as a young
[1:14:17] man he was always out on the street you
[1:14:19] know trying to testify and and win souls
[1:14:22] for the Lord now so uh uh
[1:14:28] he was invited over to to the states
[1:14:32] okay I'll try to just wrap everything
[1:14:35] here and get to my point he was invited
[1:14:37] to the state so come and preach at uh at
[1:14:40] uh Jewel Moody uh uh Church
[1:14:44] and uh at a time Modi was not around
[1:14:47] though but uh the pastor that was
[1:14:49] pastoring the church invited him and he
[1:14:52] came as a young man he had he had such a
[1:14:55] Revival he had I mean yeah such a
[1:14:58] message and I mean he he just captivated
[1:15:01] the people and uh you know uh uh uh you
[1:15:05] know stir the people up and and put the
[1:15:07] people you know down to praying and all
[1:15:10] of that so he went back uh to Scotland
[1:15:14] so because of that meeting that he had I
[1:15:19] mean he was I think actually he was
[1:15:21] invite invited for a few days
[1:15:24] I think it was a week uh but because of
[1:15:27] the way that the law was blessing him
[1:15:29] they had service for an entire month
[1:15:34] which of course it was it was it was
[1:15:37] very strange to the church I mean the
[1:15:39] the the meeting just went on and on and
[1:15:42] on and on
[1:15:43] so the church was blessed with the with
[1:15:46] the Revival and then they wanted to have
[1:15:49] him to come back again
[1:15:51] praise the Lord
[1:15:53] now so at a time they were going to have
[1:15:58] him to come back
[1:15:59] uh
[1:16:01] uh
[1:16:03] the British had a big ship at the time
[1:16:07] they were uh uh invited him to come back
[1:16:10] that would have been one of the first
[1:16:12] time that uh you know the Titanic was
[1:16:16] going to sell
[1:16:18] so he was
[1:16:21] hoping to take his daughter you know on
[1:16:25] the on the ship ride
[1:16:28] mind you he lost his wife uh she she
[1:16:32] passed away from tobacco losses and so
[1:16:35] he was uh a single father as he would as
[1:16:39] he was saying but he had a anonymity
[1:16:42] that was taking care of his little
[1:16:43] daughter
[1:16:44] so he told her and that uh I'm gonna
[1:16:48] take you on uh you know
[1:16:51] on on the Titanic we go into to the U.S
[1:16:54] so you know they're all planning and
[1:16:57] they were getting ready and preparing
[1:16:59] himself
[1:17:01] so uh John Harper he was he was known
[1:17:05] for uh you know a kind of a man a young
[1:17:10] man that was very inspired and uh he was
[1:17:14] also known for a very good uh amount of
[1:17:17] time that he spent with the Lord in
[1:17:19] prayer
[1:17:20] but he had a burden on his heart
[1:17:23] you know uh one of his brother testified
[1:17:27] that John would go over to the church
[1:17:30] and he will he will you know he would
[1:17:33] just lay flat on the ground and start
[1:17:35] crying to God I mean for him uh every
[1:17:41] day he wanted to have a soul that he
[1:17:45] would bring to the kingdom
[1:17:47] so it was it was a common thing you know
[1:17:50] that his brother said it was a very
[1:17:52] common thing you know John we were late
[1:17:55] and he cried and he would say oh God
[1:17:57] give me Soul lease I die
[1:18:02] praise the Lord
[1:18:03] amen now you can see why I read that
[1:18:07] scripture Rachel crying to Jacob and say
[1:18:10] give me children least I die
[1:18:15] praise the Lord
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] now so I will get I will get to the
[1:18:21] scripture part of it so let me let me
[1:18:23] just wrap up uh uh John half a testimony
[1:18:25] yeah so John uh when when it came time
[1:18:29] for them to go he uh he and his daughter
[1:18:33] and he took the nanny because he was
[1:18:35] going to be busy with the meeting so he
[1:18:37] wanted the Nani to take care of uh uh
[1:18:40] the girl actually turned out that the
[1:18:42] nanny was his sister so while as the as
[1:18:46] they got him got on board you know uh he
[1:18:49] would use every occasion on the ship you
[1:18:52] know what to witness to people and talk
[1:18:54] to people about the Lord but that
[1:18:57] morning
[1:18:58] that morning of uh uh a prayer about in
[1:19:02] April 14 and that was when the the
[1:19:05] Titanic heart is a horrible experience
[1:19:10] now that morning
[1:19:12] uh uh one of the neighbor she wrote uh
[1:19:16] you know as a Survivor she wrote that
[1:19:20] testimony how John will call them for
[1:19:23] the devotion even that very morning John
[1:19:25] high heart to read the scripture you
[1:19:28] know and and she read the scripture
[1:19:30] and uh uh you know and and he encouraged
[1:19:35] him and he said uh you know after the
[1:19:38] devotion he says today is going to be a
[1:19:41] beautiful day
[1:19:43] he just said it like that he said it's
[1:19:44] going to be a beautiful day today you
[1:19:47] know so I mean everyone what this verse
[1:19:50] you know uh uh to go and get ready for
[1:19:54] church it was a Sunday morning also they
[1:19:56] had a chopper on on the Titanic people
[1:19:59] were going to go to church and all of
[1:20:01] that
[1:20:02] so after all of that that and then uh uh
[1:20:07] you know the ship when it hit the ice
[1:20:12] so right in that time you know uh uh
[1:20:16] they started calling for people you know
[1:20:19] most especially uh uh
[1:20:23] women and children they were putting
[1:20:25] them on the Lifeboat and uh and older
[1:20:28] people and as many people you know there
[1:20:31] that wanted to to to get off the ship
[1:20:34] immediately so John took his uh his his
[1:20:37] sister or the the Nani and and and and
[1:20:40] his little girl and and took them to the
[1:20:44] to the Lifeboat
[1:20:46] now because that was his daughter and
[1:20:49] his wife was not around you know he was
[1:20:52] he was also uh uh eligible to get on the
[1:20:55] on the boat on one of those lifeboats
[1:20:58] but he took them to safety
[1:21:01] and uh and and then he he told his uh
[1:21:06] his his little baby that he was coming
[1:21:08] back and she was crying you know crying
[1:21:10] she says no no Daddy you know don't
[1:21:12] leave me you know don't leave me and
[1:21:15] then John turned and then he went right
[1:21:17] back on the boat
[1:21:19] as much as he was there trying to help
[1:21:22] the Adelaide in trying to help the the
[1:21:25] women and the children he was using that
[1:21:28] time in every meaning to witness to
[1:21:31] souls on the boat
[1:21:33] you know I mean as as as he meets people
[1:21:37] and helping them have you given your
[1:21:39] life to the Lord Jesus you know are you
[1:21:41] saved you know do you know the Lord
[1:21:42] Jesus I mean he was testifying and
[1:21:45] testifying and witnessing and uh on and
[1:21:49] on and on and on that uh his his mission
[1:21:52] on on the Titanic was to lead as many
[1:21:56] souls to Christ as he you know uh will
[1:22:00] have
[1:22:01] not realizing that it was going to cause
[1:22:04] his life
[1:22:07] and he stayed on the ship until I mean
[1:22:11] the shape sank and uh
[1:22:16] and because there was never uh uh you
[1:22:20] know any kind of security camera
[1:22:23] recalling anything so there is not much
[1:22:27] that is known of uh there are how many
[1:22:30] people that he led to the Lord
[1:22:33] but after
[1:22:35] a couple of years
[1:22:38] in Canada
[1:22:40] they were having a reunion
[1:22:44] of uh of survivors on the Titanic
[1:22:50] and there was one man
[1:22:53] that uh
[1:22:55] decided to give his experience
[1:22:59] and as he talked about everything that
[1:23:02] happened
[1:23:03] the last thing that he remember happened
[1:23:06] to him he was floating on a little uh uh
[1:23:11] particle whatever it was from the
[1:23:13] Titanic he was floating on and and I
[1:23:16] mean he was he was at the place where he
[1:23:18] thought he was going to drive
[1:23:21] and then here come this man right from
[1:23:24] under the under the water and just uh
[1:23:26] you know pull himself up and that was
[1:23:28] John he leaned on the piece of metal
[1:23:31] with a man and asked the man are you
[1:23:34] safe very good
[1:23:36] the man said no
[1:23:38] and I said do you know the Lord Jesus he
[1:23:41] said no
[1:23:42] he says can you will you give you can
[1:23:44] you give your life to Jesus he says I
[1:23:46] don't know
[1:23:47] you know so he said just just ask the
[1:23:50] Lord Jesus to come into your heart
[1:23:53] and then he got down under the water
[1:23:55] again
[1:23:57] and then after the wide he came up and
[1:24:00] then he's you know he swam to where the
[1:24:02] man was again and asked the man are you
[1:24:05] safe have you accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:24:07] they may say no he says what are you
[1:24:10] waiting for
[1:24:11] you know you could die any moment what
[1:24:13] are you waiting for you know and then uh
[1:24:16] you know he he kind of a witnessed to
[1:24:19] the man and uh uh and and and I mean
[1:24:23] that was the end of the story for John
[1:24:25] but the man was talking the rest of the
[1:24:27] story for himself you know realizing it
[1:24:31] to him I mean this man is is almost
[1:24:34] drowning and and asking him to give his
[1:24:37] life to the Lord Jesus so he just laying
[1:24:40] on that thinking you know uh uh maybe he
[1:24:44] was not a Christian I've never heard
[1:24:45] about the gospel but he leaned on that
[1:24:48] thing and he just prayed and said Jesus
[1:24:51] will you come into my heart I mean he
[1:24:53] just gave his heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:24:55] and I ever say he testified in many
[1:24:58] years after
[1:25:00] as the last convert of John Harper
[1:25:07] he said I believe that I'm his last
[1:25:09] comfort and this man was not a a pastor
[1:25:12] of a Presbyterian Church
[1:25:15] he says I believe I'm the last
[1:25:19] convert
[1:25:21] of John Hopper
[1:25:23] now so as I was listening to the
[1:25:25] testimony
[1:25:26] I was kind of playing some some
[1:25:29] testimony Series today as I was
[1:25:32] listening to it the thought of give me
[1:25:35] soul Lisa died caught my heart
[1:25:40] and then I started thinking about
[1:25:45] richer
[1:25:48] when she told Jacob
[1:25:50] gave me children
[1:25:52] at least I die
[1:25:54] praise the Lord
[1:25:55] so that's that's just my little
[1:25:57] inspiration I want to speak on tonight I
[1:26:00] thought that I would use uh John half a
[1:26:02] story to kind of official Spirit tonight
[1:26:05] and then uh uh just take that little
[1:26:09] little inspiration
[1:26:11] you know like brother Branham said he
[1:26:13] said there are many many of the Old
[1:26:16] Testament uh uh character in The Bible
[1:26:20] he said that in Christ he's the mission
[1:26:22] of God revealed he says they were
[1:26:24] playing our things in their life that
[1:26:26] they had no idea of
[1:26:29] praise the Lord now you have to remember
[1:26:32] there's a there's a prophecy of of
[1:26:35] Rachel weeping for her children
[1:26:38] amen we shall cause thou prophecy
[1:26:42] referred to Israel in some sense and
[1:26:44] even in uh in the gospel talking about
[1:26:48] word our lord Jesus was born at a time
[1:26:51] where hero was killing all the children
[1:26:54] you know their prophecy also was brought
[1:26:57] out of richer whipping for her children
[1:27:00] now so uh I just want to take that
[1:27:03] little thought tonight because it just
[1:27:05] kind of a stuck on my mind
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:10] the the the the
[1:27:12] the the desire for Souls
[1:27:17] I want us to go over to uh Genesis
[1:27:20] chapter 15.
[1:27:48] praise the Lord
[1:27:50] Genesis chapter 15.
[1:28:19] are we together
[1:28:25] here
[1:28:35] now Genesis chapter 15 you will realize
[1:28:38] that a
[1:28:44] there's a conversation here
[1:28:49] that is going to make God to bring
[1:28:51] Abraham
[1:28:54] to a place of coveting where
[1:28:59] he's going to promise Abraham about
[1:29:05] let's read there from verse one after
[1:29:07] these things the word of the Lord came
[1:29:09] to Abraham in the vision saying fear not
[1:29:13] Abraham
[1:29:14] Abraham I am that shade and
[1:29:18] that exceeding great reward
[1:29:22] and Abraham said Lord God what will thy
[1:29:27] give me
[1:29:28] seen
[1:29:30] I go childless
[1:29:34] and the steward of my house
[1:29:36] is this early easy
[1:29:39] of Damascus
[1:29:41] praise the Lord
[1:29:42] now here is Abraham the father of faith
[1:29:46] realize that all my time is gone but I
[1:29:49] would just I will just drive this thing
[1:29:51] down before we leave from here tonight
[1:29:53] here is Abraham the father of Faith now
[1:29:57] you you see that God gave Abraham a
[1:30:00] promise that he was going to have a son
[1:30:04] and through him
[1:30:06] all Nation will be blessed you'll become
[1:30:09] the father of all Nations
[1:30:11] and God carry Abraham all of these years
[1:30:14] and many years he traveled in all the
[1:30:16] places we know all the things that
[1:30:18] happened in the home of Abraham
[1:30:21] but what I want to show you there is
[1:30:24] that how almighty God
[1:30:28] in a way that he designed us as his
[1:30:31] children
[1:30:33] his desire and the things that he want
[1:30:36] to make manifest that's the reason why
[1:30:38] in every age God have his elected people
[1:30:42] and just like he told Israel he wanted
[1:30:45] to make them A peculiar people praise
[1:30:48] the Lord amen because God's people are
[1:30:51] peculiar people
[1:30:52] praise the Lord because we are peculiar
[1:30:55] because we are here to manifest
[1:30:58] God's thoughts
[1:31:01] amen
[1:31:02] whatever it starts whatever is his
[1:31:05] pleasure we are the people that the
[1:31:08] pleasure of the Lord is going to prosper
[1:31:10] and then God's going to use our life the
[1:31:13] situation that he will place Us in the
[1:31:16] family we will be born in and the things
[1:31:18] that will happen around our life that's
[1:31:20] the thing that make us peculiar not the
[1:31:23] way we design ourselves we cut our head
[1:31:26] and and and you know pin our face that's
[1:31:28] not what make us peculiar is the design
[1:31:31] that the way that God has designed our
[1:31:34] life
[1:31:35] praise the Lord and the things that he
[1:31:38] he will fulfill through our life that
[1:31:41] will make people to see the picture
[1:31:45] praise the Lord that would make people
[1:31:48] to see him just like Jesus said let your
[1:31:50] lies shine that man will see your good
[1:31:53] work and glorify your father that is in
[1:31:56] heaven
[1:31:57] praise the Lord so in many times God
[1:32:00] will use a second person
[1:32:03] because he is the first person
[1:32:06] and he will use a second person to be
[1:32:09] able to play out certain character just
[1:32:12] like Joseph you know I was he played our
[1:32:16] Perfection just like David crying my God
[1:32:19] my God crying on the mountain and all of
[1:32:21] that God will always use his children he
[1:32:24] will place now so see Abraham yeah
[1:32:26] crying to God
[1:32:31] see that I go childless
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:37] and this elieza
[1:32:43] Steven in my house born in my house
[1:32:45] Abraham saying what you know uh uh uh
[1:32:49] I'm going to adopt him
[1:32:52] because I'm going childish now you will
[1:32:54] see it yeah what I want you to see there
[1:32:57] is that uh uh this is beyond Abraham
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:03] richer
[1:33:05] taking uh Jacob by the belt and saying
[1:33:09] give me children
[1:33:10] she knows that Jacob is not a creator
[1:33:14] praise the Lord
[1:33:16] amen she knows that he he cannot go to
[1:33:20] the to the grocery store and buy
[1:33:22] children
[1:33:24] praise the Lord
[1:33:26] amen but you realize that at that period
[1:33:30] of time there is there is uh there is uh
[1:33:33] uh uh uh an inspiration that came on
[1:33:36] richer
[1:33:38] that was expressing
[1:33:41] God's mind
[1:33:43] more than richer physical needs
[1:33:49] praise the Lord
[1:33:51] and not a picture again you will see uh
[1:33:54] uh uh uh look at some your mother
[1:34:00] Hannah
[1:34:03] amen
[1:34:06] praise the Lord
[1:34:07] look at some your mother
[1:34:12] being desperate she's having this
[1:34:15] desperate need in her heart I I want a
[1:34:19] child and she gets down to the temple
[1:34:21] and say oh God give me a child and I
[1:34:24] will give him back to you
[1:34:29] praise the Lord
[1:34:30] amen now you have to realize that in
[1:34:34] that very time in that very time
[1:34:38] the priest is falling apart the
[1:34:41] priesthood is falling apart Israel is at
[1:34:44] adjunction
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:49] they are the junction
[1:34:51] where the dispensation is going to
[1:34:53] change in Israel for good
[1:34:56] praise the Lord here is this woman
[1:34:59] coming to the prayer meeting on
[1:35:00] Wednesday night
[1:35:02] and she found her little corner
[1:35:05] after the priests have said everything
[1:35:07] he have said maybe talk about John
[1:35:09] Harper just like I did
[1:35:11] and he's talking everything but in that
[1:35:14] woman heart she's having a burden
[1:35:16] praise the Lord now God is going to take
[1:35:20] the burden of Hannah and change the
[1:35:24] course of israelit
[1:35:26] praise the Lord so you tell me is that
[1:35:29] Hannah burden or is it God's burden
[1:35:32] right
[1:35:34] she was just a second person
[1:35:37] expressing the desire of the first
[1:35:39] person
[1:35:40] Rachel was a second person expressing
[1:35:44] the desire of the first person
[1:35:49] praise the Lord amen Abraham also was a
[1:35:54] second person expressing the desire of
[1:35:58] the first person
[1:36:03] praise the Lord
[1:36:06] Hallelujah
[1:36:08] amen
[1:36:11] you have to realize that you are a
[1:36:14] second person
[1:36:18] that must be expressing the desire of
[1:36:21] the first person
[1:36:24] praise the Lord
[1:36:26] amen
[1:36:30] Hallelujah
[1:36:32] glory be to God
[1:36:35] bringing Abraham out here
[1:36:38] giving him this promise the Bible says
[1:36:41] God speaking to him in a vision
[1:36:45] I am your great and you're exceeding
[1:36:49] reward
[1:36:51] praise the Lord now you think about it
[1:36:55] he gets there a vision break before him
[1:36:58] God is speaking to him
[1:37:00] but he's caught in his mind
[1:37:03] all the thing that is on Abraham's mind
[1:37:06] is that I'm trying
[1:37:08] foreign
[1:37:11] praise the Lord the Lord is saying I am
[1:37:14] your great
[1:37:15] and your exceeding reward what does that
[1:37:19] means it means that there is nothing you
[1:37:21] can lack
[1:37:26] God is telling him I'm your fountain
[1:37:30] I'm your Fountain of Life
[1:37:35] but he's stuck in his need
[1:37:39] thinking that is his need no it's not
[1:37:42] his need
[1:37:48] praise the Lord
[1:37:51] amen
[1:37:56] keep me trying
[1:37:58] at least I died
[1:38:00] give me so least I die
[1:38:08] praise the Lord
[1:38:13] that's what I wanted to bring you
[1:38:15] tonight that's that was what was on my
[1:38:16] mind
[1:38:18] that's the place I want to bring you
[1:38:19] tonight before we go to the Lord in
[1:38:22] praying praise the Lord
[1:38:25] realizing that
[1:38:29] just like how the Old Testament
[1:38:31] characters were
[1:38:33] so also we are
[1:38:36] praise the Lord
[1:38:38] amen
[1:38:40] but what's happening most of the time we
[1:38:42] we are just we are we are caught in our
[1:38:46] knee we think that all we need is so
[1:38:48] much
[1:38:51] praise the Lord
[1:38:57] Hannah being a woman
[1:39:01] her husband was you know giving her all
[1:39:04] the gifts
[1:39:05] the Bible says he loved her
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:13] but there was a burden in her heart
[1:39:18] so I said well it's not money that I
[1:39:20] want it's now it's not dresses I want
[1:39:22] well actually I want I want to try
[1:39:27] and she was just thinking that she just
[1:39:30] wanted a child
[1:39:32] just to be a mother like every other
[1:39:35] mother
[1:39:38] praise the Lord
[1:39:42] but see but see there left for time that
[1:39:44] she spent with Samir
[1:39:47] so who actually was giving her that
[1:39:49] burden
[1:39:59] praise the Lord
[1:40:01] and that better Brandon would let us to
[1:40:03] know yet is the other
[1:40:06] that's the burden that is going away
[1:40:08] from the church
[1:40:09] the burden for Souls
[1:40:13] amen
[1:40:16] that's the first person desire
[1:40:20] and he says he don't have no other hands
[1:40:23] but our hands we don't have no other
[1:40:25] Faith but our feet you don't have no
[1:40:27] other mouth that he can be able to talk
[1:40:29] to
[1:40:30] to a stranger but but your mouth
[1:40:41] praise the Lord
[1:40:46] when one saw
[1:40:49] the value of one's soul
[1:40:55] is more than ten thousand words like
[1:40:58] brother Branham said
[1:41:01] the value of one soul
[1:41:09] and yet
[1:41:11] we go every day
[1:41:15] not Desiring
[1:41:20] praise the Lord
[1:41:22] what I want us to do tonight as we go to
[1:41:25] pray
[1:41:28] is to take our heart before the Lord
[1:41:32] and check for the burden of Souls
[1:41:40] praise the Lord
[1:41:43] to look for the burden of Souls
[1:41:50] praise the Lord
[1:41:53] do you have the burden of Soul do you
[1:41:55] think about it do you think about
[1:41:57] someone being safe
[1:42:00] do you really feel it
[1:42:06] is there someone on your heart
[1:42:13] that you are praying for
[1:42:15] put yourself in all of those situations
[1:42:19] Abraham having all of these Visions God
[1:42:23] visiting him
[1:42:26] but yet he's caught in that desire
[1:42:31] nothing will satisfy Hannah
[1:42:34] nothing was satisfied their husband is
[1:42:37] giving her all the best gift nothing
[1:42:39] will satisfy her
[1:42:40] she caught in that desire
[1:42:43] it's so much that she don't even care
[1:42:46] what Eli says one of the things she's
[1:42:49] drunk what are the things that she's
[1:42:52] losing her mind she's consumed it's it's
[1:42:55] a burden on her heart
[1:43:01] praise the Lord
[1:43:05] but her desire to have a time will
[1:43:08] change the course of the history
[1:43:13] of Israel
[1:43:16] praise the Lord
[1:43:20] or desire
[1:43:27] John Harford was invited
[1:43:30] for Harper was invited
[1:43:32] to come and have a Revival
[1:43:39] glory be to God
[1:43:42] what if you spend all the time sleeping
[1:43:48] at least he knew that that would have
[1:43:51] been his Revival
[1:43:55] the Titanic would have been his last
[1:43:58] mission field
[1:44:03] and the reason why he could do that is
[1:44:06] because he was living every day with the
[1:44:10] burden of Lost Souls
[1:44:14] when you are living conscious every day
[1:44:17] with the burden of lost souls you don't
[1:44:20] need a necktie to witness
[1:44:22] you don't need a Bible honor your arm to
[1:44:25] witness
[1:44:27] praise the Lord
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:36] the reason why he could do that
[1:44:42] is because
[1:44:46] it was his everyday crying
[1:44:48] God
[1:44:50] give me sword
[1:44:52] at least I died
[1:45:06] let's go to the Lord in prayer musicians
[1:45:08] you can come up
[1:45:13] that's my testimony tonight
[1:45:25] we will trust the Lord and continue on
[1:45:27] that thought
[1:45:33] but I'm hoping I'm praying
[1:45:36] that God
[1:45:38] will stir our hearts
[1:45:42] praise the Lord
[1:45:44] that God will stirred our heart that
[1:45:48] where the brothers sisters wife husband
[1:45:52] children
[1:45:56] can you imagine
[1:46:00] if we have a church
[1:46:04] where the people hearts
[1:46:06] are burden for Souls
[1:46:12] what what our hearts our desires are
[1:46:15] burden for Souls
[1:46:20] the same way we are studying to have a
[1:46:23] career we are working to have money
[1:46:26] we will also want to have a soul to our
[1:46:29] name
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:39] living with that in your mind living

[1:47:09] I want one more soul to be a trumpet of
[1:47:12] grace to you
[1:47:16] if I can just be a witness
[1:47:22] by the way I dress
[1:47:24] by the things I do
[1:47:27] because you never know who's looking at
[1:47:29] you and from which which distance they
[1:47:31] are looking looking at you
[1:47:34] you don't know whose life you are
[1:47:36] influencing

[1:47:40] you're trying to impress people
[1:47:42] [Music]

[1:47:59] show up there you are just living the
[1:48:02] best Earnest life
