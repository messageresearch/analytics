[5:24] he had to put him on equal basis of free
[5:28] moral agency to make his own charts but
[5:30] knowing he would fall
[5:32] now he can't be a savior unless
[5:34] something's lost
[5:36] he can't be healer unless something sick
[5:39] these things have to be that way
[5:42] God made them thus so that his great
[5:45] attributes could be displayed if there
[5:48] was nothing he had never been a savior
[5:50] but we know he was even before there was
[5:54] a time he was a savior
[5:57] he was a savior so there has to be
[5:59] something lost how is it going to be
[6:02] if he takes and loses it just an order
[6:04] to save it
[6:06] then it isn't Justice to his judgment
[6:10] he couldn't send the man to hell
[6:13] and be just
[6:16] he's kind gentle true honest
[6:19] and he's a great judge
[6:22] see he'd be working against himself so
[6:24] he had to put a man out here and make
[6:26] him all free moral agency so he would
[6:29] knowing would fall and the man in his
[6:32] own image how could he fall
[6:39] now you seeing daylight
[6:42] so he had to make a byproduct
[6:46] something out of the original creation
[6:49] ah you see it see there you come
[6:54] back
[6:55] then that's what fell
[6:58] he made it knowing it would fall
[7:00] and he's put over the hands of Satan for
[7:03] a vessel Of Dishonor
[7:06] words honored bestowed today
[7:10] you think on that
[7:12] notice
[7:14] closely now
[7:17] then again
[7:19] why she was designed this way and not
[7:23] like other females
[7:25] why was the woman designed so and not
[7:27] other females now the other females are
[7:29] designed like that they're not today
[7:32] they can
[7:34] not be made that way she can't do it
[7:38] why did he not make this female man of
[7:41] woman just like other females so she'd
[7:44] just be the same way to just raise her
[7:45] babies that should have her husband live
[7:48] and when it come time for a baby should
[7:49] have her baby why do you make her like
[7:51] this
[7:52] I can't say these words and you
[7:54] understand what I'm talking about don't
[7:55] you if you can understand say amen amen
[7:57] you know see uh it's a young girl
[7:59] sitting here and young boys but you know
[8:02] the animal has to come to a certain time
[8:04] of the year than her mate then that's
[8:07] all
[8:08] but a woman is anytime
[8:10] why did he make her like this
[8:13] I watch this great program unfolders are
[8:15] going through here now just as perfect
[8:17] as perfect can be I didn't know this the
[8:19] other day
[8:21] why didn't he make her like that in the
[8:23] beginning like the rest of his females
[8:24] because it would be Unbecoming to him
[8:27] he's the Fountain of all purity
[8:31] that's the reason he had let Satan get a
[8:33] hold of her what he done
[8:35] in the perversion such a creature would
[8:37] be
[8:39] would not be
[8:41] becoming to him originally designed for
[8:45] all his works that he designed in the
[8:49] original is in continuity
[8:53] all of his original worksters in
[8:55] continuity the female dog the male dog
[8:59] see female cow the male cow everything
[9:02] in continuity all nature is in
[9:04] continuity
[9:06] she died going the ground is like death
[9:08] burial Resurrection the sap goes down of
[9:10] a tree drops his sleeve comes back next
[9:12] year the resurrection of a new Leaf
[9:14] do you want to mean everything even
[9:17] nature of God is all in a continuity in
[9:20] one and here's one design out of the
[9:22] continuity of God
[9:24] Nature's so designed so it can't sin
[9:30] think
[9:32] the original creation of God could not
[9:35] see
[9:36] oh don't you see now in this view here
[9:39] the perversion of the church the
[9:41] original is God's word there's no sin in
[9:44] God
[9:50] see what I mean here's a creature that
[9:53] come into existence by perversion God's
[9:55] going to have a church but look at this
[9:56] preparing thing they got out here
[10:00] God has male and female but this woman
[10:03] see the very symptoms of it shows back
[10:06] what was in God's mind
[10:09] you could take an hour or two and break
[10:10] that down
[10:13] she made this creature for that way
[10:17] he made the creature eternity so Satan
[10:19] could get a hold of her and he did he
[10:21] still got her
[10:23] she better flee to the cross
[10:25] like man too
[10:27] notice all nature runs in continuity if
[10:31] he had made the woman in the same
[10:33] Regional creation that had been no sin
[10:35] because she couldn't have done it
[10:42] you couldn't have done it
[10:46] she is a perversion of the original
[10:48] creation
[10:50] so is all sin a perversion of the
[10:54] original truth
[10:56] what is a lie is the truth perverted
[11:01] what is an adultery is the right act
[11:04] perverted
[11:07] so there is the perverted creature there
[11:10] is a perverted whole thing and the whole
[11:12] thing is spelled s-i-n
[11:15] laying right there that's why the
[11:18] questions are great
[11:20] only a peace scrap made of a man to
[11:23] deceive him God made it right here's
[11:25] proved it
[11:26] that's what she's made for
[11:28] our immoral woman
[11:30] is the lowest thing that can be thought
[11:33] of in the Earth
[11:37] excuse this young ladies she's nothing
[11:40] but a human garbage can
[11:43] a sex exposure
[11:45] that's all she is I am or a woman
[11:50] is a human sexual garbage can of
[11:54] pollution
[11:56] we're filthy dirty ornery
[11:59] slow down filth
[12:02] is disposed by her
[12:07] why she made this way far
[12:09] deception
[12:11] every sin that every was on the Earth
[12:14] was caused by a woman
[12:18] and a angel is just from Chicago a woman
[12:21] wrote this article the police force that
[12:24] they chased down in United States
[12:26] Metropolitan United States that 98 of
[12:30] every crime that was ever did in any
[12:32] form in the United States there was
[12:34] either a woman in it or behind it
[12:38] now I'm saying all this to get to one
[12:40] thing here at the end so what you can
[12:42] see what's the matter
[12:46] she was made to deceive like she did
[12:48] Adam at the beginning tell him that the
[12:50] fruit was pleasant and so forth to
[12:52] deceive him and take him away from the
[12:53] word
[12:54] that's the way the church does today
[12:55] same thing
[12:58] but then
[12:59] after that he become her ruler to rule
[13:03] over now what a difference in this day
[13:05] in this day of conception instead of him
[13:08] being her ruler she has become his God
[13:14] sure
[13:17] she rules him
[13:20] now you can probably well understand
[13:22] what I've been hitting at
[13:24] by her beauty and her sex control her
[13:27] shape what was given to her by Satan
[13:31] the byproduct as Satan did she is sent
[13:35] to deceive sons of God and she could
[13:37] sway more up to hell in any other
[13:38] instrument Satan's got
[13:41] it exactly right I'm talking to the
[13:43] immoral now not you sisters
[13:47] we'll give you a place right placed in a
[13:49] few minutes in the word of God here
[13:52] it was in God's plan from the beginning
[13:54] now
[13:56] to do this today what is the god of the
[13:59] United States you remember the
[14:00] Tabernacle years ago I preached on that
[14:03] the God of this modern day a little
[14:05] flapper sitting there with makeup on and
[14:07] dressed pulled up over her knees and
[14:09] things like I said behold your God
[14:12] and that's right
[14:14] she's on every advertisement half naked
[14:17] she's on the street the same way it's an
[14:20] instrument of Satan from the beginning
[14:22] Jesus said
[14:24] we see with the soul now and from the
[14:27] beginning and what he's talking about
[14:29] now the heathens used to make her a god
[14:32] did you know that a goddess
[14:34] sure it is the maker of goddess
[14:37] for they did have sex acts in their
[14:40] worship they claimed that she was a
[14:42] Creator in her womb she carried the seed
[14:44] and created that's a lie there's only
[14:47] one Creator that's God
[14:49] but remember Paul there dying of Ephesus
[14:52] uh image of a rock said the goddess of
[14:55] Heaven throw downers to see our Heathen
[14:56] worship is and we not knowing it turns
[14:59] right straight back to Heathen worship
[15:01] again to women the very
[15:03] on the Earth
[15:06] woman worship
[15:08] she a swayed man any way she wants to
[15:11] and not knowing all that beauty on the
[15:13] outside of hell is on the inside
[15:15] Solomon said her or Gates is a gates to
[15:18] hell
[15:20] now we see plainly here what Jesus spoke
[15:24] up and the revelations the second
[15:25] chapter and the 15th verse of the
[15:29] Nickelodeon Doctrine the oncoming of
[15:32] that church pulling itself away from the
[15:34] word
[15:36] also we can see here planing these
[15:40] vulgar ungodly filthy
[15:44] programs that we have on television of
[15:47] Hollywood sex Queens
[15:49] we can see the filth of this city as
[15:52] these kids little old girls walking up
[15:55] and down the street here with a little
[15:56] big tight toes twisting around and hit
[15:58] cold enough to freeze them to death
[16:00] they don't know that that's the devil
[16:03] doing that
[16:04] they are possessed of an evil spirit and
[16:08] don't know
[16:10] you don't see a female dog doing that do
[16:12] you
[16:16] you don't see any other female doing
[16:18] that
[16:19] and no mayo better walk up to her either
[16:25] see
[16:26] now
[16:28] you get the picture
[16:31] we introduced something just in a moment
[16:33] the Lord willing now you see the
[16:36] Nickelodeon's you see their Doctrine you
[16:39] see the teenage Queens they call them
[16:43] these striptease is out on the street
[16:45] used to have to go to some vulgar show
[16:47] on the side to see a striptease just
[16:48] open your eyes look out on the street
[16:49] that's all you have to do now the whole
[16:51] thing's a striptease sure what are they
[16:53] doing for
[16:56] to tantalize tempt
[16:59] that's the only thing she can do it for
[17:01] amen
[17:03] amen she doesn't because she's filthy
[17:06] she does it because she's made that way
[17:09] she don't realize that she's the
[17:11] instrument in the hands of Satan
[17:15] that's what she is
[17:18] Even in our school today they're
[17:20] teaching sex acts
[17:22] our rotten world of woman worship
[17:26] I know they don't want to believe that
[17:27] Stan is saying some kind of him and so
[17:30] forth on one day and out with women
[17:32] running around all night long
[17:36] all right
[17:40] when a God's side
[17:42] the word she is the lowest of all
[17:46] animals that God put on the Earth
[17:48] watch that's why God forbids her to
[17:53] teach his word
[17:57] that's right first Timothy 2 9-15 I
[18:02] suffered not a woman to teach her to
[18:04] heaven
[18:06] and also First Corinthians 14 34 let
[18:10] your women keep silent in the churches
[18:12] first not permitted to them to speak
[18:15] for they are command to be inside all so
[18:17] saith the law
[18:19] but today what does a church do
[18:22] they make her pastors evangelists
[18:25] when the Bible completely forbids it
[18:29] and the Bible said has also said the law
[18:31] making it run in continuity
[18:33] the whole thing is like the lamb was
[18:35] last night the only place of worship or
[18:37] the shed blood of the Lamb it's the only
[18:39] place today in Christ the only way to
[18:41] just come into him that's the only place
[18:42] to worship it always was that way the
[18:44] only place to worship is trying to shed
[18:46] blood
[18:47] so now we see the whole picture of it
[18:49] unfolding to us
[18:51] there she is
[18:53] that's why God won't let her teach won't
[18:56] let her do anything in the church but to
[18:58] set still with a veiled face
[19:01] now can you see
[19:04] why I have said to things and done the
[19:06] things that I've done
[19:09] knowing all this in my heart brother
[19:11] sisters I know sisters I'm you got your
[19:14] place just a moment and a wonderful
[19:15] character that God can mold in you but
[19:18] I'm just trying to speak on the other
[19:19] side to show what you're actually from
[19:21] the beginning
[19:22] Jesus told us go back to beginning to
[19:24] find it that's what we're doing
[19:27] now I've had to hit the high points on a
[19:29] lot of this and I hope you understand it
[19:30] and you people who will be listening to
[19:32] this tape I hope you understand just go
[19:34] back it's only to show that Jesus said
[19:37] go back from the beginning and find out
[19:39] all things go back to the beginning
[19:42] you can see today why people they say
[19:45] I'm a woman hater that's far from the
[19:48] truth
[19:49] uh do not they call a woman remember
[19:51] they call Paul a woman hater a woman a
[19:54] minister not long ago said oh you're
[19:56] like old Paul all he had to do is pick
[19:57] on us women a saint of God that was
[20:01] permitted to write the Bible the New
[20:03] Testament
[20:04] and dispute his words he said of an
[20:06] angel from heaven teaches any other
[20:08] thing and this and I've said let he be a
[20:10] curse let alone some woman preacher
[20:14] he said Elijah was a woman hater he
[20:16] wasn't a woman hated real women he just
[20:18] didn't like them Jezebels
[20:20] [Music]
[20:22] and if that be so then must be God must
[20:25] be the same way because he is the word
[20:28] which come to the prophets so it must be
[20:30] God the same way so see he knows
[20:32] original creation from the beginning he
[20:34] said
[20:35] from the beginning
[20:37] they were prophets who the word came to
[20:39] and he made her or man and not man for
[20:43] her did you know that that woman was
[20:46] made for man and not man for woman how
[20:49] many knows that the Bible teaches that
[20:50] all right
[20:52] she was given a place in man
[20:55] before the fall
[20:57] equal over all creation
[21:01] but after the fall now
[21:04] here we bring the subject up but after
[21:07] the fall he was her ruler she must keep
[21:12] silent and all matters
[21:14] now after the original beginning is over
[21:18] Jesus said it wasn't so from the
[21:22] beginning
[21:23] that's when time began when God made it
[21:26] first in his original creation
[21:29] all to understand say Amen again
[21:31] in the beginning God created just one
[21:34] male and one female
[21:36] but then the woman was made different
[21:38] from the animals all other animals for
[21:40] deception
[21:42] now watch now it wasn't so from the
[21:44] beginning she was made if she stayed in
[21:46] her original condition she would have
[21:48] never been no fall but she caused the
[21:51] fall in the interruption that broke the
[21:53] whole continuity of God and Joe deaths
[21:55] all right everything else on the Earth
[21:57] she made thus now notice
[22:00] now after the beginning after the
[22:04] beginning
[22:05] after a Time began back in that was
[22:08] eternity
[22:09] is over notice after that fall
[22:13] was made
[22:15] by Eve after the fall there was need to
[22:19] be another covenant made
[22:23] now this is going to stumble you
[22:26] but I'm going to give you the scripture
[22:27] to prove it that this is the truth
[22:30] now
[22:31] notice
[22:33] after the fall Jesus said God at the
[22:39] beginning made one of a kind
[22:44] but now after the fall now we're going
[22:47] beyond that the Covenant was co-equal
[22:51] but now add to the fall there's another
[22:54] covenant made
[22:56] now she was no longer ruler with him
[23:04] each must have a separate Covenant now
[23:06] let's see if that's right let's take
[23:08] Genesis 3. and find out if this is right
[23:10] as we go along because
[23:12] we want to be positive these things
[23:14] they're taught out brought out exactly
[23:16] true so that maybe right here we have a
[23:19] little time because we're not too far
[23:20] from the end now to get to the closing
[23:22] part of the subject
[23:24] to show why and what about divorces and
[23:27] so forth
[23:28] now in Genesis the third chapter and we
[23:31] will begin uh now with the third and the
[23:34] 16th verse
[23:37] let's begin to 14 first and the Lord set
[23:40] unto the serpent I just go to curse it
[23:43] because thou has
[23:45] thou has done this Thou Art cursed above
[23:49] all the cattle of every beast of the
[23:52] field and upon thy belly Thou shalt go
[23:55] and thus shall thou eat all the days of
[23:58] our life and I will put enmity between
[24:01] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[24:04] and the woman's seed and it shall bruise
[24:06] thy head and thou shall bruised he is
[24:09] healed the promising coming to the woman
[24:11] the Messiah to redeemed
[24:13] unto the woman he said hello now there's
[24:17] the Covenant with the serpent which they
[24:19] were all all right beforehand at the
[24:22] beginning
[24:23] or before the beginning
[24:26] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[24:29] multiply thy sorrows and our conception
[24:32] and in sorrow shall thou bring four
[24:34] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[24:37] husband and he shall rule over thee not
[24:42] no more co-equal together at all
[24:45] now she's turned right around she's a
[24:47] ruler
[24:51] and into Adam he said because thou has
[24:53] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[24:57] and as eaten of the tree of which I
[25:00] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[25:03] it
[25:04] cursed be the ground now curse it Adam
[25:06] now curse it be the ground
[25:08] for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat
[25:11] of it all the days of thy life thorns
[25:13] and officials shall it bring forth to
[25:16] thee and thou shalt eat the herbs of the
[25:18] veal and his sweat of thy face shall
[25:21] thou eat bread till thou returns to the
[25:24] ground for out of it
[25:27] out of it was thou taken for dust Thy
[25:31] Art and unto dust shalt thou return two
[25:34] Covenants
[25:37] now
[25:38] that closes the beginning of what Jesus
[25:40] said it wasn't so at the beginning
[25:43] we got another Covenant now
[25:45] notice
[25:48] it's another Covenant
[25:50] now there's a covenant for the product
[25:52] and a the byproduct notice the fall
[25:56] brought trouble death to every creature
[25:58] of the creation making a difference in
[26:02] all nature now let us notice what Jesus
[26:04] said about from
[26:08] the beginning
[26:09] it wasn't so now it is not
[26:13] soul from it is now it is after the
[26:19] beginning
[26:20] now there's a double Covenant
[26:23] first was just a covenant Adam and Eve
[26:26] is co equal one man one woman now the
[26:29] woman sinned what does she do that told
[26:33] him all to death and God had to make a
[26:35] covenant by that another Covenant
[26:38] here it is right here in Genesis 3 16.
[26:41] he made another Covenant now the world
[26:44] is to be repopulated
[26:48] not by the original creation of God like
[26:52] in the beginning
[26:54] not by the original creation
[26:57] but by sex desire
[27:01] ah that takes care of the beginning
[27:03] though
[27:05] in the beginning there's only one man
[27:07] and one woman one male one female but
[27:10] when she crossed that line and brought
[27:12] this sin
[27:14] now the world's to be repopulated again
[27:18] by sex
[27:20] not the creation
[27:22] by sex
[27:26] see where the woman's at now
[27:31] now
[27:33] but that's the way the world's populated
[27:35] Aid through women
[27:37] that's reason Jesus had to come through
[27:39] the woman to bring it back to its
[27:40] original beginning again
[27:42] without sex desire
[27:45] he's virgin born
[27:47] but Hallelujah
[27:48] there will come a time
[27:52] where it will be no more sex but God
[27:55] shall call his children from the dust of
[27:57] the Earth
[27:59] back like it was in the original not to
[28:02] any woman
[28:03] but through the molding of the clay and
[28:06] the cosmic lights and the petroleum
[28:08] he'll create again like he did Adam at
[28:10] the first time
[28:11] Jesus made this possible by God making
[28:14] himself a man and coming to the world so
[28:16] he could die through this woman
[28:20] now it's testing Time by sin now you see
[28:26] then after the beginning it was
[28:29] something else was introduced now this
[28:32] is going to shock you
[28:35] are you tired
[28:38] this sits still just a little longer
[28:40] then when the devil Covenant was made by
[28:43] man and woman through sex another
[28:46] Covenant altogether
[28:48] not the original Covenant
[28:51] but another Covenant
[28:53] now let's introduce polygamy
[28:57] and all
[29:00] then after the beginning polygamy was
[29:03] introduced
[29:04] both in man and in Beast
[29:08] after
[29:09] the beginning the fall
[29:13] God now
[29:16] second dearly sets a new nature Again by
[29:20] sex
[29:22] God created the first without sex you
[29:25] believe that
[29:27] now it's another Covenant with nature he
[29:29] sets it in another order by sex
[29:33] second Covenant
[29:35] one male many females
[29:41] one Buck dear a whole Harem of does
[29:47] that right yeah
[29:48] one bull
[29:51] a whole herd of cattle
[29:53] cows
[29:55] one rooster a yard full of hens
[29:59] is that right
[30:00] one David attribee's on heart with 500
[30:04] wives
[30:06] with a hundred children born to him in
[30:08] one year of different women
[30:11] a man after God's Own Heart
[30:13] one Solomon with a thousand wives
[30:18] but notice now it wasn't so at the
[30:20] beginning
[30:21] but now it's actually the beginning
[30:24] the woman's done this
[30:27] then she just becomes what she is now
[30:29] see
