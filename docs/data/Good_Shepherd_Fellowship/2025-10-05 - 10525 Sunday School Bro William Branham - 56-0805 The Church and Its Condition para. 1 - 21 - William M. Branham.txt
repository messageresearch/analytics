[Music] [Music] [Music] do that. The doctors don't even know give some kind of a name, but I think they just made up one to give it that they didn't know what it was. And but Christ knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can tell you what it is. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; What name they want to give him, that's up to them. But that's what he is. the evil spirit. Now let's all together once together now only believe. Everyone come right out. [Music] [Applause] All my heart [Music] be [Music] all dark. [Music] Let's pray for the girl now as we bow our heads. Our heavenly father seemingly I just can't get it off my mind. The little girl there to die. &gt;&gt; She's somebody's darling. She's your creation. &gt;&gt; And Satan is robbing her of her young life. I pray that in Christ's name that you'll stay the hand of death. &gt;&gt; Drive back that enemy. Thou Lord who can make the Red Sea, the wall up on either side and give the children of Israel, thy heritage, a safe journey across the sea and into the promised land. God, we pray today that you'll move back every obstacle and let the child live. It's been given to us to ask and as a group of people believing in thee, we ask in Jesus name for the healing of the child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today it's uh with a grateful heart that I I come to you again in the name of the Lord Jesus. I come home just a little early from Louisiana. Um thought maybe if I got here for Sunday I could have Sunday school. And then the weather was so awfully hot there. We this would be mild cool this morning Louisiana. You never set in a building like this with no more than a fan in Louisiana. It' be airond conditioned or you'd be fainting. And so I come sort of to get just a day or two's rest before leaving now right away to northern Saskatchewan next week. And um that's up at Prince Albert. That's as far as roads goes in the world. From the other side you cross all the way over the world without any more roads and nothing but Indians and Eskimos back in the interior past where we go this time. So we have many people will be at this meeting from all over Canada. Some of them will come from from the west coast they say coming over and I certainly desire the prayers of you people that God will meet with us and give us an exceeding abundant great meeting for his glory. It's been some four or five years since I've been in Canada. And I have some real royal friends there that are very fine people. And so they're very uh loyal to go to church. No matter how cold it is, they'll wrap up in a blanket and set on a bobble sled and drive a horse for 30 miles to get to go to church. They'll walk through the snow drifts and everything else. Young and old, they all group together. One family gets together and they start walking and they go It's it's the sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service. When there's no sacrifice, there's not very much to the service. But you have to really get down and do something. It hurts real bad. Have to lay aside some things and stop the work and do this or that to get to go to church and show God that you love him and you make a sacrifice to go. It's then when you get something out of it. It's just like my kitties. Billy Paul, I thought I would I didn't get anything when I was a kid. Mama used to get maybe one sack of candy and she'd measure it out two or three pieces each one. Maybe for Christmas we get a little tin horn or a little cap pistol or something. And I've seen other kids with slays and bicycles and things, good clothes and warm jackets. And I I I just made me feel so bad. I said, "If I ever have any children of my own, I'm going to do everything for them I could." Well, I would be willing to go hungry to get something for my kids. And when I lived when Billy was just a little boy, I'd get him a little tricycle and I'd get him everything and Meaty would try everything to sacrifice her own clothes and things to get him something. But you know what? We begin to find out. I got him a little tricycle and a little boy and era and everything. I'd find him with a a spoon or a stick out in the backyard digging somewhere. I said, "The next ones won't be like that." See, you just give anybody everything right on their hand. They don't want it. It's something you have to sacrifice for. And that's the way salvation is. It's a complete sacrifice. &gt;&gt; It is, brother Roy. It's It's a sacrifice that you have to do every day. something to uh to get close to God and to do something. And I know it's a sacrifice you all this morning set in this hot building. As we sit here, let's keep our minds on the greatest sacrifice that mankind ever was given &gt;&gt; to do. That was Jesus Christ when he was charged to come to the earth to die in ourstead. Not only that, but his soul descended into hell and was there for three days and nights. And on the third day, he arose, and now ascended on high, sitting at the right hand of God in heaven, making intercessions upon our confessions of his uh atonement and his grace that's been provided for us. Now, up in the up there where we're going, there'll be many people, real poor, real poor, will have to sell one of their cows, two or three of their sheep or something, get to come to the meeting. The old Eskimo will probably bring out some of his skins and sell them that he really needed for his family to come out. The Indian traitor will have to do the same. Now, we can at least pray for those people, can't we? &gt;&gt; And we pray that God will give him a great thing. Now, it's hot. I don't want to keep you long. And I want us to this morning to fix our minds just before we have prayer for the sick. upon church and its condition. And now I feel that a few days ago that a message to the church was given to me at Streetport Louisiana. And I I believe it's the conditions of the church and we're going to face God with it this morning and pray and ask God to help us. Don't aim to take the same approach, but ask God to help us in this day that we're living. And just before this is a grand old Bible, but just in there lays the contents of eternal life. And remember, the word is God. God is no more than his word and we're no more than our word. And if we make of course now you and I in a different st sense because we can we can say I'll do a certain thing we mean that in our heart but circumstances can arise that we can't we can't do that what we said we would do but God can't do that because he's infinite and he knows everything everything it ever was will be or so he can't make a statement unless he knows he can back it up and Abraham when he was a hundred years old, he called those things which were not as though they were. I'm saying this as encouragement to the ones that's going to be prayed for the sick. Abraham called the things that were not as though they were, counting that he who had made the promise was able to perform or keep that which he had promised. Now when God told Abraham when he was 6 75 and Sarah was 65 that they were going to have a baby. Why? It was altogether impossible. And he believed that and looked for the baby and counted the baby as good as being there for 25 years before the baby ever come. And Abraham was 100 when the baby was born and Sarah was 90 because he believed him and called the things which are not as though they were. Now that's to the sick and afflicted to be prayed for. No matter what your troubles are, whether you're what kind of diseases you got, how bad off you are, when you accept Christ, his word, then you call the things which are as though they were not, if they're contrary to God's word. Now, God said, "Prayer of faith shall save the sick." Well, if God said that, that settled it. Then let's put our minds, hopes, and act as though it's already done. &gt;&gt; It's already finished when we accept it. Salvation is the same way. We believe it, accept it, believe it in our heart, walk up before God, and accept Christ as our personal savior and accept him. If you're here this morning and a sinner and not saved and you want to be healed, you're sick, first seek the Lord. accept him as your savior. Then that disease will work right out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ever what it is, just put your whole thought to everything that you have on the whole man Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything else will be all right. &gt;&gt; So now keep your mind on that because I said these few words for those who are sick and afflicted. So that I'm going to speak this morning to the church and the condition for I feel that although divine healing is marvelous but when I was in shreport only had about three healing services out from the down there three or maybe four to most out of the 11 days. It's more essential to preach to the souls of man than it is to put so much time on divine healing. Although the people who are sick and needy, God can heal them and it's already been vindicated the world around that he does. But the main thing now is through the soul which will never die. &gt;&gt; The body will die, but the soul will never die. And we must keep that level and straight with God. I've often said this, I want everything done or when I come down the river that morning, I don't want any trouble there. I want to have my ticket in my hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. waiting for my name. Now I want to say it's Paul of all brother Creature. I know him in the power of his resurrection &gt;&gt; that when he calls from among the dead, I'll come out because I want to know him in the power of his resurrection. So now he who's the author of the book, let's bow our heads and hearts to him just a moment. And God our father, we come to thee now to ask that you'll open your word to us. We can pull back the pages, but only the Holy Spirit can open the word. So open it this morning to us, Father, and give us the exceeding abundant of thy grace. A we wait upon thee and may the Holy Spirit get into the word and give it out through human lips to human hearts and may take it and place it in every heart just as we have need. And when the services is over, we're ready to turn to our homes. We'll humbly bow our heads and give thee thanks and praise for all that we have learned of thee and what thou has done for us. In Christ's name we ask them. Amen. The reading of the word over in St. John the first chapter. you who have Bibles and would like to read with me or mark it down for a text and we read the text from the word and then let praying that the Holy Spirit will take the context out of the word to give to us. We can read it. We who are able to read can read it but only God can bring the context out. The text can be read because it is his word. But then the the context has to be given by God. Now in St. John first chapter and let's begin at the 28th verse and read down to the 32nd inclusive. These things were done see beyond Jordan where John was baptizing. Next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world, and this is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man, which is preferred before me, for he was before me, and I knew him not, but He but that he should be manifested to Israel. Therefore, I am come baptizing with water. John bear record saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him. I want to read that again, that last verse. 32nd verse. And John bare record, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. And may the Lord add his blessings to the word. I want you to try to to catch every word if we can. Can you hear me? All right. Way back. All right. Can you hear me back there? If you can, you raise up your hand. That's good. Now, I want to speak to you this morning on on par on some way that even the the most unchurched person in here would be able to understand. Now, we come to church to better ourselves. We come to make ourselves better people, better Christians, better citizens, better fathers, better mothers, better neighbors. We come because Christ has told us if we would come as anything in his name were we assembled together, as many as two or three, he would be with us and would grant it to us. So what could be any more uh be any better to us today than to know that we have the church for to em better ourselves to broaden our understanding. How many would say that's what I'm here for? Let's see. I I want a better understanding. And we can't we can't have a better understanding unless it and if we're go to have an understanding of God, it must come out of God's word. For the word is what God gave us to feed our hungry souls. And the Holy Spirit was sent to take the word of God and to feed us by the word. &gt;&gt; You see it? See, we the Holy Spirit is sent from God to take the word of God and to give it to us as we have need. Now, I'm so glad that God made a provision like that, aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he would feed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the sheep of his pasture. We're going to speak on that a little bit. The sheep. And we're the three-fold being of God. And when he can have the complete control of us, he can lead us and guide us. [Music]
