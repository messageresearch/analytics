e e e e e it's impossible that there guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and I indict them by the word of God that God is how do you indict them brother Brandon I indict them that God has clearly identified himself in his word in the last days and made himself to know that is still the same yesterday today and forever and they've coldly turned it down am amen Lord and you're guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by blaspheming the Holy Ghost that's right we take you on to Hebrews 10 Again word tells us again in the scriptures not only being impossible but you can never separate you from God eternally you can never come in the presence of God again when you turn down the Holy Ghost and make fun of it now see if tasted of the word see borderline Believers oh you say them guys wasn't believers they was Believers yes or professed Believers but when it come to the word they were Israel they come out under the blood they come out under the signs of Moses they had seen those signs working God said I'll take you over Yonder and when they come right down to the principle of the promised word that was to come what do they say oh we can't do it see and here they come back with grapes and everything to prove the lamb was right God's word's right God said I give it to you but the circumstances my I said we look like grasshoppers upside of we can't do no matter what a few years ago in this old Hull Studio as a tabernacle somebody come in walked out there and talked to me he said Billy you're going to preach to four post one of these days was messages like that I said I'll be preaching to four post because God's able them post to rise children of Abraham it's a truth I said if you got something that you can disprove it let's have it Hallelujah long a crow but when it comes to a place to show it that's different yes that's what makes a difference all right yeah with their Creeds they crucify him aresh now Hebrews the 6th chapter and we go on down we can just read on down on down in through here we got plenty of time I marked out a scripture here um where will be Hebrews the sixth chapter is I guess take it all impossible for those who were once inight and made partakers of the Holy Ghost we haven't got time to go too far because got another scripture I want you to read just in a moment notice this they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh what do they do what by having a taste and knowing that it's the truth and then turn around and denying it yeah what you do it's impossible so that's what this nation has done that's what this people has done that's what these churches has done they've turned it down and they've crucified the message they've crucified the truth to the people how they do Jesus they put him to shame stripped his clothes off of him hung him up on a cross and nailed him up there the Prince of Life the same thing they've done today with their Creeds they've done the same thing they stripped the things they stripped the the goodness and the clothing of the Gospel by trying to place it somewhere else and hung him on the cross oh my why there they there they crucified now the last quotation him him this most precious person why did they do it they didn't know him why are they doing it today they don't know this is the truth they're they're dumb and blind of it they don't know it that's reason their Creeds and traditions has gotten them away from the word of God Amen now until you hear just in closing I pay close attention I know it's hot I'm hot too oh brother this word amen it's life if you hold to it look it's not something we talk about and may happen here and after it's something that's already here with us and happening now not something will be something that's already we're not testifying we know what he has done we know what he's going to do but now we're telling him what he is doing this is our hour we may not live to see the Rapture I may die today you may die today I don't know but the Rapture is coming that's that's when that comes we'll be there don't worry sold all the rest of them back through the ages has believed it look for it they walked in the light of their day and here is the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever forsake your Creeds and believe this word this is the truth the word is truth Jesus said my word or Spirit my word is life how you go to receive life when you reject life how you go to take in a Dogma which is death and a Word of Life turn out the word of life to take death how you go to accept the two at the same time you can't do it let every man's word be a lie every Dogma a lie God's word's the truth amen I challenge any man to show me anybody and I know this tape goes around the world any man any Bishop that'll come to my study or before this congregation and point their finger to one place anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost in the New Testament I'll show you where every person that ever was baptized and those who are baptized different had to come and be re-baptized to get the Holy Ghost amen what are you going to do about it stay out there in your Creeds stay out there in your dogmas and die you're guilty Wicked hands youve tuck the Prince of Life The Word of Life and crucified it to the people now what did they do they didn't know it today man walk ignorantly they don't know that's a truth they think it's some kind of an ism they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't caught up on God enough they just lightly take it oh well I believe it's God sure the devil believes the same thing the devil believes it more than some people claim to be the devil believes it and trembles people just believe it and go on but the devil trembles knowing his judgment is coming and people believe it and don't pay no attention to the judgment's coming guilty of crucifying him sure I D this generation finding them Guilty by the same word that found them guilty at the beginning that's right Jesus said who can condemn me he was the word made flesh and today the same words made flesh Peter said in his indictment in Acts let's just read it Peter when he saw this taking place what they had done the spirit look Peter was defending Christ what they done I'm defending what the gospels are I Peter was inditing there for killing the man Christ who was the word I'm inditing this generation for trying to kill the word which is made manifest in man watch what Peter said his righteous indignation must have rose up pretty highly listen at him here in Acts the 2 chapter and begin with the 22nd verse ye man of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth approv a man proved of God among you by Miracle signs which God did by him in the midst as of you as ye yourselves also know imagine how they felt listen to that ye man of Israel the prince ye Church man you holy man you priest you man is supposed to be man of God here these words Jesus of Nazareth was approved of God among you now I say to you clergymen and to you people Jesus of Nazareth the Holy Ghost he's here in the person of the Holy Ghost amen which was the life that was in him he's here working through people and declaring himself by signs and wonders which he does and here they hang around on the walls scientific identific and people sitting here that was dead is a living today and cancer eating or well today Blinder seeing today and crippled out are walking today amen praise the Lord he's Jesus of Nazareth him being delivered by the determine of counsel and the for knowledge of God predestinated for his job ye have taken and by Wicked hands you have slain is that can is that indictment he's indicting what that San hadrin Council I'm indicting this morning the Federation of churches I'm inditing the Pentecostals I'm indien the Presbyterians the Baptists and every denomination in the world by Wicked selfish greed you've tuck the word of life and crucified it before the people and blasphemed it and called it fanaticism which God has raised up in our midst to prove that he's the same yesterday today for Generation hallelujah amen God has proved himself alive God has proved that this is his word what have you got but a bunch of dogma and Creeds where can you show the Living God because you've turned down the word of life that would have give you these things yes sir oh what an hour that we're now living in same oh I call Peter said You' have tued by Wicked hands and have crucified and slain who God raised up having loose the Pains of death because it was not possible you should be holding of it and through your Creeds and your organizations and your denominations with your form of godliness talk your forms of godliness you've denied the power of his resurrection but the hour has arrived the last days are here when God promised according to Malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last days and would turn the hearts of the people back to the original blessings and the Pentecostal faith of and you can't deny it and you can't withstand it God and then I condemn you guilty and challenge you and indict you before God that with Wicked selfish denominational hands you've Cru crucified the word of God before the people and I call you guilty and ready for the Judgment amen yes sir I call the same thing Peter did he call repentance of that generation I call repentance to this generation repentance towards God and come back to the original truth of the word come back to the Faith of Our Fathers come back to the Holy Ghost because God cannot change it when God said these signs shall follow them that believe he has to stay with that all through eternity it's his word when you say shake hands or take communion or something like that or some on that Creed or something on that idea that any man any drunkard any un believer can do it any impersonator any prostitute can do that take communion have farms and things like that you could do it but Jesus said this will be the identification these th shall that they may be they will and all generations to them that believe my name they'll cast out devs they'll speak with other tongues speak with new tongues and take up serpents drink daily things won't harm lay their hands on the sick they shall recover heal the sick raise the Dead cast out Devils as freely as you receive freely give all this big money-making schemes and things are hooked up in the things today no wonder there a full of judgment yes sir oh my let's see now yes sir call to repentance my inditing now in this new Calvary is the the church soall most holy places great pulpits Catholicism Al Catholic order call their Pulpit the methodists the Baptists the Presbyterian the Lutheran the Pentecostals the most holy places there he receives his heartest pierces a new Calvary where is it found at in the holy plac is the church where is he crucified at from the pastors you Hypocrites you

does he get today in the pull pit where did they come from Jerusalem where did they come from the denomination the ones who claim to love him that's who did it that's who does it today his second Calvary where he receives his pierces against the word that's what pierces him who is he he's the word he is the word where does it pierce the hardest from the pulpit in the holy places just like it was then I've got a right to indict this generation I got a right to do it as a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for these signs and proving that he is God I got a right to bring indictment against this generation because his hardest spear points as been right from the pulpits where they've criticized and said don't go out to hear that stuff that's of the devil right in the place supposed to love him and the Very signs that Jesus said would take place the word of God is sharper than a two- aged sword or a discerner of the thoughts of the intents of the heart and it's called
