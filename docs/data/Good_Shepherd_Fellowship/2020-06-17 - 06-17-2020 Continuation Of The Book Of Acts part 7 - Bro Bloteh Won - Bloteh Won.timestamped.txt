[22:34] Spirit can be able to bring more of what
[22:37] we want to share with you but tonight as
[22:40] Chapter three we will begin from verse
[22:43] one now Peter and John went up together
[22:48] into the temple at the hour of prayer
[22:53] being the ninth owl and a certain man
[22:58] lame from his mother's womb was carried
[23:02] whom they laid daily at the gate of the
[23:06] temple which is called beautiful 2ax
[23:11] arms of them they enter into the temple
[23:14] all seeing Peter and John about to go
[23:17] into the temple acts of am impeded
[23:21] fasting his eyes upon him with John said
[23:26] look on us and he gave he to them
[23:31] expecting to receive something of them
[23:34] then Peter said silver and gold have I
[23:38] none but such as I have give ID in the
[23:44] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
[23:49] and walk and he took him by the hand and
[23:54] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[23:58] and anger bones received strength and he
[24:02] and he leaping up stood and walk and
[24:06] enter with them into the temple walking
[24:10] and leaping and praising God and all the
[24:15] people saw him walking in praising God
[24:17] and they knew that it was he which sad
[24:22] for arms at
[24:24] the beautiful gate of the temple and
[24:26] they will fill with Wonder and amazement
[24:30] at that wish have happened to him praise
[24:35] the Lord
[24:36] let's stop right here let's pray
[24:38] Heavenly Father we just actually a
[24:40] blessing upon your word tonight and we
[24:43] ask that Lord Jesus you will bring an
[24:47] inspiration out of this tonight father
[24:49] and bless our hearts O God we love you
[24:52] we appreciate you we glorify your holy
[24:55] name in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[25:00] praise the Lord
[25:22] I will read a little bit down and from
[25:24] verse 11 and as the lame man which was
[25:28] he you hell Peter and John all the
[25:31] people ran together unto them to the
[25:35] pole that is called Solomon greatly
[25:40] wandering and when Peter saw it he
[25:44] answered unto the people ye men of
[25:48] Israel why Marvel year this or while
[25:53] look he is so earnestly on us as though
[25:58] by our own power or holiness we have
[26:03] made this man work the God of Abraham
[26:07] and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our
[26:12] Fathers have glorified His Son Jesus
[26:15] whom ye delivered up and denied him in
[26:19] the presence of Pilate when he was
[26:22] determined to let him go but he denied
[26:27] the Holy One and the just and desired a
[26:32] murderer to be granted unto you and
[26:37] killed the Prince of life whom God had
[26:40] raised from the dead where of we are
[26:44] witnesses and his name through faith in
[26:50] his name have made this man strong whom
[26:54] ye see and know yea the faith which is
[27:00] by him have given him the perfect
[27:05] soundness in the presence of you all and
[27:09] now brethren I would that true anger as
[27:13] he did it as did also our rulers but
[27:20] those things which God before have shown
[27:23] by the mouth of all his prophets that
[27:25] Christ should suffer he have so fulfil
[27:31] repent ye therefore and be converted
[27:33] that your sins may be
[27:36] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[27:38] shall come from the presence of the Lord
[27:43] amen tonight uh for the Wednesday night
[27:47] just by the weight of an inspiration I
[27:51] want to take the little top there in
[27:53] verse in verse four word Peter the
[28:01] scripture says and Peter fasting his
[28:03] eyes upon him with John said look on us
[28:09] amen I want to take those three words
[28:13] tonight use it for the subject and we
[28:18] continue with this series of the bulk of
[28:21] adds brother Branham in efficient church
[28:24] age we have read this he used this word
[28:28] in a vision church age he says look up
[28:31] wish of course bird brain mourning over
[28:34] his face it means behold he says look up
[28:38] behold him who is even now walking in
[28:44] the midst of the church through all ages
[28:48] before him who is the same yesterday
[28:52] today and forever and who never changes
[28:59] either in essence or in his ways were
[29:03] two or three I gather together in his
[29:07] name there he is in VMs now burr Branham
[29:12] using this is trying to to to bring a
[29:17] realization to us because over and over
[29:21] brother Branham says when when Peter and
[29:23] John says look on us they were actually
[29:27] calling the attention of the man that he
[29:29] should be able to look at them to grab
[29:32] his attention and we're Bellamy used
[29:34] that I was just looking at that a few
[29:38] minutes ago he used that over and over
[29:40] in the prayer line he says just like
[29:43] Peter said to that man at a gate a
[29:46] beautiful look on us I'm saying look at
[29:48] me
[29:49] what's he trying to do get the attention
[29:51] of the man contact his spirit but so
[29:54] yeah brother branham also is trying to
[29:56] bring us to a realization that we must
[30:00] look up before him who is even now
[30:04] walking in the mists of the churches
[30:07] throughout the ages wish of course
[30:09] that's what we are talking about the
[30:11] book of Acts which is the the
[30:15] continuation of the book of asked Christ
[30:17] in in the church Christ in the New
[30:20] Testament church that's what we're
[30:22] Branham said is the continuation of the
[30:25] book of Acts
[30:26] so we want to behold him just like he
[30:30] said here he gave us a promise where two
[30:33] or three are gathered in his name there
[30:36] he is indium is not not only in their
[30:40] midst as a compressing on local all as a
[30:47] recording angel but there he stands
[30:51] expressing exactly what he is the life
[30:57] and sustainer and and giver of all good
[31:01] gifts to the church hallelujah that's
[31:04] what he said now so we realized here he
[31:07] is bringing us to this realization that
[31:10] we have we have to pay attention and we
[31:13] also have to we have to grab the view of
[31:17] the one that is in the midst of the
[31:21] church even though we are not in our
[31:25] building wish of course the church is
[31:27] not the building the church is the call
[31:30] out people we are the church so where we
[31:33] gather two or three in our home if it is
[31:35] just you and the wife in and and and the
[31:39] children Christ have promised to be in
[31:42] our mess so we have to come to that
[31:44] realization to behold his presence to be
[31:48] able to recognize his presence that's
[31:50] what I want to kind of a make emphasis
[31:53] on tonight as we go ahead he says
[31:55] walking walketh in the midst of the
[31:59] seven golden candlesticks how mindful of
[32:02] those words
[32:03] when view in the light of the scripture
[32:05] which described him as Christ who is our
[32:09] life for Christ indeed is the life of
[32:12] the church she has no other life without
[32:16] him she is simply a religious society a
[32:21] club a meaningless gathering of people a
[32:25] cop's bejeweled
[32:27] and dress a state account so the church
[32:30] no matter what her programs in an
[32:34] aggressive effort may achieve with a
[32:37] Christ
[32:38] she is a cop's awesome but with him in
[32:42] her miss with him motivating her she
[32:50] becomes tall she becomes tall the
[32:54] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[33:00] of him that filleth all in all
[33:03] and this very hour he is walking in the
[33:08] midst of the last Age golden candlestick
[33:14] what is what he was as he walked in the
[33:21] first age he is even now in this last
[33:25] age and Burnham is identifying him what
[33:28] he was in the first age Jesus Christ the
[33:32] same yesterday today and forever praise
[33:36] the Lord
[33:37] so we realized here a stream as we
[33:41] travel on with with this subject of the
[33:43] book of Acts they have they have
[33:45] received the Holy Ghost and those men
[33:48] that were that were so fearful now in
[33:51] talking about this as I was thinking
[33:54] about it and and and meditating upon it
[33:58] brother Branham said he says in the
[34:02] prayer line he said spirit and James
[34:03] said look on us in other words is to
[34:07] attract attention he used the same thing
[34:12] also in a message what is that in your
[34:15] hand now you
[34:16] gnorm like Peter and John passed through
[34:20] the gate called beautiful and said look
[34:22] on us see look on us now look at them as
[34:26] him but just to give attention to what
[34:31] they were saying catch the attention of
[34:34] the Spirit they wanted to grab the
[34:37] attention of the spirit now this is what
[34:41] out this is what I was thinking about as
[34:43] I as I was reading true the message and
[34:46] just thinking about this tonight now
[34:49] Peter and Peter James and John you have
[34:52] to realize this man they were all there
[34:55] that night when Jesus was was being
[34:58] questioned when he was taken down out
[35:01] there and they were questioning him and
[35:03] the very night of the of of the betrayal
[35:06] and the Bible says that all his
[35:10] disciples went away from him that's why
[35:13] the scripture says and the scripture
[35:15] also led us to know that a few different
[35:21] times three times the pointed out Peter
[35:23] and says are you now one of one of them
[35:26] at that time Peter a slob look
[35:29] at me yeah I'm one of them no he says I
[35:32] don't even know this man he denied the
[35:34] Lord Jesus now so what has happened this
[35:38] time what has happened this time
[35:42] something really has happened something
[35:45] has changed his life that he was
[35:47] conscious of Peter knew that now he was
[35:51] possessing something that he never had
[35:54] in he was now possessing something that
[35:58] he can tell that that man there had a
[36:01] get a beautiful look at me look at me I
[36:03] want your attention praise the Lord
[36:09] can you tell somebody look at me I
[36:15] believe we should be at that place what
[36:18] we can say it is not me and I live it is
[36:23] Christ I look very mean just look at my
[36:26] life I used to be this now His grace has
[36:30] helped
[36:30] we're going to look at something here in
[36:33] a little bit now so we realized that I
[36:38] mean period even the scripture says when
[36:45] when they realize that this is the man
[36:47] that has been the Bible said to carry
[36:49] him they would tour him they'd bring him
[36:51] right to that place to set him down he
[36:54] bared forearms in the evening they come
[36:56] and gather him back they take him back
[36:58] to the house I mean he has been there
[37:00] years after years and after years they
[37:03] would do the same thing everybody know
[37:05] him but this day is going to be
[37:07] different
[37:08] praise the Lord this man has received
[37:13] the promise of the father they have
[37:15] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:18] so tonight just looking at this thought
[37:21] oh look on us
[37:24] I'm trying to bring us to the place that
[37:27] we have to realize what we have received
[37:31] the Holy Ghost is not a doctrine the
[37:36] Holy Ghost is more than a teaching
[37:38] because he is the teacher
[37:41] he's more than the teaching he's more
[37:45] than a church believe he more than a
[37:47] feeling he's more than an emotion the
[37:50] Holy Ghost is nothing less than God
[37:53] himself
[37:56] praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is not T
[38:00] less than God himself
[38:05] that's the realization that brother
[38:07] Branham was trying to bring to us here
[38:11] in the efficient church age when he said
[38:13] look up God is trying to grab our
[38:18] attention church that this holy ghost
[38:21] that is dwelling in our midst the Holy
[38:24] Ghost that we are submitting ourself
[38:26] home the one that we are obeying the one
[38:29] we are believing the world we are
[38:31] allowing to live in our life is nothing
[38:35] less than God himself
[38:39] praise the Lord
[38:41] to make the Holy Ghost and if
[38:44] less than God that's the mark of the
[38:47] beast you have missed the Mac and better
[38:51] Benham says that's what sin is to just
[38:54] stop the holy ghost on an experience
[38:56] stop the Holy Ghost on a mentor
[38:59] conception a belief system you have mr.
[39:03] Mac you have to believe that this is
[39:07] nothing but God himself
[39:09] that has come down that has choose to
[39:12] associate his self with us we don't need
[39:20] to be afraid of it we have to be proud
[39:23] we have to be very grateful that God in
[39:28] His mercy has called you and myself from
[39:33] our past and all of the things that we
[39:36] have gone through we have failed him we
[39:41] have failed he pickup up he has given us
[39:44] grace and mercy it is nothing less than
[39:47] God himself he's the one that is in our
[39:53] midst because he is the one that have
[39:55] been in the midst of the seven golden
[39:57] kind of steak before him he's the same
[40:02] one that would come down in the cool of
[40:04] the evening and was walking in the
[40:07] garden when the Bible said the voice of
[40:10] God world in the Garden of Eden it was
[40:12] nothing less than God Himself
[40:17] the one that worked with the prophets
[40:19] that reveal himself in a life of a
[40:23] Daniel Jeremiah and Elijah and all this
[40:27] prophet he's nothing less than God
[40:30] himself and if we start becoming
[40:37] conscious of this reality now you're not
[40:41] just dealing with the church you are not
[40:44] just dealing with brother branham belief
[40:46] system you are not just dealing with a
[40:49] good Good Shepherd as a church you are
[40:52] dealing with God himself
[40:57] this is God himself the Bible you are
[41:00] holding in your hands is God in preacher
[41:04] form you have to believe that everything
[41:11] was made by him without him there was
[41:14] nothing made that is made and in
[41:16] everything that he made he revealed
[41:19] himself in it I'm trying to say to us
[41:29] tonight we are dealing with God himself
[41:34] this message of the hour the purpose of
[41:37] this message is to reveal God himself to
[41:42] you he is the principle team of the
[41:48] Bible he is the Alpha
[41:53] he's the Omega he's through it all
[41:56] better Branham says if we read it and we
[41:58] don't see God himself go back and read
[42:01] it again before him who is even now
[42:11] walking in the midst of the church
[42:12] through our other ages before him who is
[42:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[42:18] he's trying to grab our attention people
[42:21] this is that this is the God that spoke
[42:25] the word into existence the very one
[42:29] that called the word into existence
[42:32] praise the Lord
[42:34] I believe that's what Peter and John men
[42:37] when they told a man look at us look on
[42:40] us look on us you might have know me to
[42:46] be a fisherman you might have know me to
[42:49] be a disciple of Jesus or right now
[42:55] look look on us if we are conscious that
[43:00] we are dealing with God and as God is
[43:04] the invisible God that is making himself
[43:09] visible in our
[43:12] if we get to to be conscious of that it
[43:19] is net you trying to be a better
[43:24] Christian
[43:26] you will feel it is now you trying to be
[43:32] a good husband or a good wife or a good
[43:37] young brother or a good young sister
[43:40] that was the reason why the God of
[43:43] heaven and earth he had to come in a
[43:46] form of a blood meeting with one exhales
[43:51] he has to come in a form of of a baby
[43:54] and that is the reason why last week I
[43:57] was trying to bring out of the scripture
[43:59] John the Baptist Eve the Holy Ghost in
[44:02] his mother's womb
[44:04] Elizabeth received the Holy Ghost an
[44:07] experience of the Holy Ghost being
[44:09] conceived with child
[44:10] Zachariah received the Holy Ghost in the
[44:13] temple so which mean God measure it out
[44:15] right from the warm all the way to the
[44:18] grave we can have access of the Holy
[44:20] Ghost from the womb to the grave no
[44:24] excuse there is no excuse and that is
[44:30] the reason why we have to be teaching
[44:32] our children praying for them they are
[44:35] not too small to receive the Holy Ghost
[44:39] from the womb straight to the grave no
[44:42] excuse Elijah bone was lying in the
[44:47] grave when you put a deal me in a grave
[44:50] he came back to life because the
[44:53] quickening power was in that grave why
[45:01] all of these things is too sure that a
[45:04] warm that we are dealing with it's not a
[45:07] belief system it's God Himself that is
[45:12] making himself real in our mess if you
[45:19] believe that this Holy Ghost is God
[45:20] himself
[45:21] you must believe that he is your
[45:23] creator he knows everything about you so
[45:26] you cannot you cannot deceive the holy
[45:28] ghost if you come to the realization
[45:31] that you are dealing with God himself
[45:34] there is no room to pretend because he's
[45:39] your maker he knows the limit of your
[45:40] strength he knows how much you can take
[45:44] he knows what you are hiding behind in
[45:49] all the way that Adam took effect leave
[45:51] he said Adam Adam where are you that
[45:54] question where are you means he was
[45:56] hiding somewhere so he knows where we
[46:02] are
[46:02] in our work he knows where we are in our
[46:08] understanding if we come to the place to
[46:15] realize that it is God himself we will
[46:21] be so grateful we will be so grateful so
[46:27] appreciative of the saving grace that we
[46:30] have received
[46:39] he's the one that is walking in the
[46:42] midst of the seven golden candle stick
[46:44] the same way he walked with Adam the
[46:48] same way he walked with Enoch he has
[46:51] choose to walk with us he has choose to
[46:56] come in our home he has choose to come
[47:00] in our home look on us praise the Lord
[47:13] let's pay attention to that church the
[47:15] one that we have dealing with tonight is
[47:19] God himself
[47:20] Seibert Bram says something here in
[47:23] deity of Jesus Christ he says and that
[47:31] same power that that same Christ
[47:35] hallelujah led the fundamentalist let
[47:39] them people who deny the power of God
[47:43] say it's wrong but that same power there
[47:48] spoke the word into existing is in those
[47:54] people that God the Holy Ghost praise
[48:01] the Lord
[48:02] maybe you are looking at the worse you
[48:05] are trying to understand the English but
[48:09] you think about there he says the same
[48:17] power the same power that spoke the
[48:24] world into existence it's in those
[48:29] people they have the Holy Ghost the same
[48:39] power praise the Lord
[48:47] you see that's the reason why the bride
[48:52] the believers stand as a protection to
[48:56] the earth because the power that is
[49:00] holding this word in its orbit it's in
[49:06] you that's what Jesus said greater is He
[49:11] that is in you
[49:15] the heater is in the world
[49:17] amen are we together the very same power
[49:25] that spoke this word into existence that
[49:33] power is in you he says it's in those
[49:41] people that got the Holy Ghost that's
[49:44] right men and women it is time that we
[49:48] find out who we are and you will never
[49:57] know who you are until you really come
[50:02] to conscious of he that is in you when
[50:07] we start cherishing the one that is in
[50:09] us the one that wake us up wake us up in
[50:13] the morning and realizing that we don't
[50:17] have the keys to our own life in it and
[50:21] the right to do whatever we want to do
[50:26] Moses there in a burning bush he says to
[50:29] God what am I then I should go to
[50:35] Pharaoh God never told him God never
[50:38] answer his question yeah I know you you
[50:40] are Moses you had a son of a merman and
[50:43] Jack you be a god and I answer that
[50:45] question because the secret of Moses
[50:51] Noreen woo he was was in the I am dad I
[50:54] am when Moses asked that question of who
[50:58] I am God did not answer him
[51:00] when he now asked God whoa are you when
[51:05] I get to Egypt I would tell the people
[51:07] then God said I am that I am but BAM
[51:13] says it's time that we find out who you
[51:19] are the devil is trying to hire you back
[51:23] tell you that you are some little cow
[51:27] there are something you are not you are
[51:32] sons and daughters of God and being a
[51:38] son and daughter of God it means that
[51:40] you are an attribute of God it means
[51:43] that you are an amateur God you are God
[51:47] in it in the sense there you are a child
[51:49] of God the DNA is not in heaven it is in
[51:56] you that was the realization that Peter
[52:03] and John came to all when it told them a
[52:05] look on us they came to the realization
[52:11] there is something that was dwelling in
[52:13] them that thing that make you cried when
[52:17] when you when you when you discipline
[52:19] the law that thing that troubles your
[52:22] mind I put you on your knees that make
[52:24] you to lift your hands that make you to
[52:26] sing sounds of praise and you just wash
[52:29] up God the thing that makes you feel so
[52:31] happy in your heart is nothing but God
[52:35] himself
[52:42] praise the Lord
[52:46] like one brother said he says when we
[52:49] use the language young people we make
[52:51] excuse this is a way to make excuses you
[52:56] are young people it means that yeah you
[52:58] can stay fool around your knob that I
[53:00] mean God don't have no grandchildren
[53:02] just like I said from the womb to the
[53:06] grave you have a right to the Holy Ghost
[53:09] God can give the Holy Ghost in a warm he
[53:12] can give it to a young child and he will
[53:15] guide the life of that child until the
[53:17] guests to the place work that life will
[53:20] become real in them praise the Lord
[53:26] is there anything hard for the Lord
[53:30] there is nothing hard for him praise the
[53:36] Lord all young people when we get to
[53:41] that place were we can tell our friends
[53:43] look at my life see how I dress I don't
[53:46] do this because I don't believe it it's
[53:49] not of God I don't glorify God he called
[53:55] us to be a reflection of him he's
[53:58] dwelling in us the reason why he would
[54:03] give a young man the Holy Ghost so that
[54:05] a young male life can be a testimony to
[54:07] other young people God on waita for the
[54:18] age of accountability to wait for the
[54:22] age of 18 years or where where you can
[54:26] you I mean now you are an addict declare
[54:29] you on other the very time the Word of
[54:31] God is birthed in your heart you are an
[54:34] other before God that is the reason why
[54:38] some of our young people can be here
[54:40] more responsible than the people out
[54:43] there in the world it's because the
[54:49] thing that is dwelling in you is nothing
[54:51] less than God we explain the Holy Ghost
[54:57] in justification you know
[54:59] you just when you when you I justify you
[55:02] just you just believing you just
[55:04] believing what makes you believe it's
[55:06] God that makes you believe it's the Holy
[55:08] Ghost in you that takes you from
[55:10] justification to centrifugation from
[55:13] centrifugation to an indwelling where he
[55:15] possesses your body but from the very
[55:19] time where a young try gives you a heart
[55:22] to the Lord
[55:23] it's a it's a field where a seed is
[55:27] planted in and that seed is the life of
[55:31] God it's an incorruptible seed that's
[55:38] what we've done it just allowed the
[55:40] children to go to church with us let ask
[55:43] them whether they have received Jesus
[55:46] Christ because we're Brent says give
[55:49] them to the Lord worthy a young let God
[55:52] get ahold of them before this world get
[55:54] on there from the womb to the grave no
[55:58] excuse the devil is trying to hide you
[56:06] back in saying all you are just young
[56:16] when you get to this place then you will
[56:18] become serious when you get out of high
[56:21] school when you get married but that's
[56:27] when God want your heart that thing that
[56:30] is dealing with you in your heart when
[56:32] you are alone the thing that brings you
[56:35] consciousness that you have done wrong
[56:37] it's God it's the Holy Ghost the more
[56:42] you stop believing that is the holy God
[56:44] that is dealing with your heart the more
[56:47] he will make himself real to you
[56:57] Theater is not in heaven he said deity
[57:00] is in you hallelujah I know you think
[57:03] I'm crazy but let me tell you something
[57:06] brother when you realize that Almighty
[57:11] God lives in you immortal life my life I
[57:20] gave Jesus said the soul the life of God
[57:26] is in the Hema being when you realize
[57:31] that Almighty God lives in you nothing
[57:39] that there that is your faith it's God
[57:46] realizing that Almighty God lives in you
[57:49] tell yourself that every morning that
[57:52] Almighty God lives in me come to that
[57:56] realization there Almighty God he's
[58:04] living in you praise the Lord
[58:15] ami oh what a what a wonderful thing to
[58:21] know that Almighty God lives in us
[58:30] [Music]
[58:31] praise the Lord
[58:34] amen
[58:44] it's a beautiful thing to know that
[58:46] Almighty God leaving us glory to God I
[59:02] was looking at the scripture and
[59:08] actually the sister titi called me and
[59:16] she was sharing now the testimony and
[59:18] she was reading the scripture and it has
[59:21] to do with the scripture were the strip
[59:24] the Bible says the first step of the
[59:26] righteous is all about the Lord and when
[59:30] he and when he falleth God we uphold him
[59:35] and as we were talking about it this
[59:38] morning we shared a little bit of this
[59:40] with her it's coming to that
[59:43] consciousness because it is it is at a
[59:47] place word we are afraid you know you're
[59:52] afraid to say you have the Holy Ghost
[59:54] because when you make mistake you would
[59:56] think that is not the Holy Ghost he
[59:59] order our footsteps it is where we
[1:00:02] commit our ways in his hands when we do
[1:00:07] when we are desiring to do things we
[1:00:09] committed to him and when he convinced
[1:00:12] us and lead us that is the right thing
[1:00:14] to do and we take that thing by faith
[1:00:17] and we go out and do it and because we
[1:00:23] we have we have done everything we know
[1:00:25] right to do we have prayed we have
[1:00:28] committed in the hands of the Lord we
[1:00:29] have read the scripture there is no
[1:00:31] selfish desire in what we want to do
[1:00:34] the scripture says even when we go and
[1:00:37] make mistake he will withhold us he will
[1:00:41] bring us up that's what he's the
[1:00:44] comforter he's the guide he will lead us
[1:00:51] into all truth
[1:00:56] we're branches when we realize that
[1:01:01] Almighty God live in us do you know what
[1:01:10] happened just before those disciples
[1:01:12] received the Holy Ghost after all of
[1:01:16] these things his resurrection after his
[1:01:19] resurrection and all of the different
[1:01:22] things they started seeing and God
[1:01:24] started opening their mind toward the
[1:01:26] scripture do you know how they felt
[1:01:29] sitting there and and enough sense
[1:01:34] regretting in their heart that he was
[1:01:37] with us we just took him to be a good
[1:01:42] teacher now they are realizing that this
[1:01:46] one that has worked with them three and
[1:01:48] a half years was nothing but God himself
[1:01:53] they are sitting there saying oh how I
[1:01:57] wish I pay attention that day you
[1:02:02] remember when he was talking about the
[1:02:04] parable about the kingdom of God we just
[1:02:07] see in his eyes now they are coming to
[1:02:11] the understanding and the realization
[1:02:13] that the worm that was working with him
[1:02:16] three and a half years
[1:02:20] they call him the son of David they call
[1:02:23] him Robert they call him master but they
[1:02:25] are realizing that this is God himself
[1:02:31] do you see why when those men received
[1:02:34] the Holy Ghost they got so desperate
[1:02:36] they got right into action because they
[1:02:40] don't want to miss this opportunity
[1:02:43] again realizing that they miss it the
[1:02:46] first time how many times Jesus said
[1:02:51] things to them they just sat down the
[1:02:53] look at him the Wonder in their mind
[1:02:55] really they are saying really you are
[1:03:01] saying that because you know in our
[1:03:02] situation in
[1:03:06] and people people do that you know to do
[1:03:11] that the reason why people we would give
[1:03:15] our time you know to our work we would
[1:03:18] be on time for job and even when we are
[1:03:20] sick we still try to make it to to work
[1:03:23] is because we believe that our
[1:03:27] livelihood depend on our job we believe
[1:03:34] it and that's truth you have to provide
[1:03:37] for your family you have to I mean
[1:03:40] provide take care of yourself your your
[1:03:42] your livelihood depend on the job and
[1:03:44] because of that it's in the mind of us
[1:03:48] as hema we woke up in the morning we get
[1:03:50] our set ready we want to be there on
[1:03:52] time with because we don't want to
[1:03:54] supervise your cousin calling us and say
[1:03:56] well you've been lit this one we I'm
[1:03:58] gonna give you a note I'm going we do
[1:04:01] out of that but why why are we holding
[1:04:06] back when it comes to our spiritual life
[1:04:10] level we come to church late if we don't
[1:04:17] even show up to church we don't tell
[1:04:18] anybody it's nobody business nobody in
[1:04:22] all my life you know what I mean that
[1:04:24] it's much you we give all of those
[1:04:26] excuse in our mind because we have not
[1:04:29] come to the realization to know that our
[1:04:33] life player who our internal in
[1:04:35] destination depend on our attitude to
[1:04:39] the Word of God when it comes to the
[1:04:47] things of God we are slothful we're
[1:04:49] having all the excuses to give can you
[1:04:54] imagine if God who just get a hold of us
[1:04:58] and turn our life around and we start to
[1:05:01] treat the things of God treat our
[1:05:03] devotion treat our prayer life treat our
[1:05:06] commitment when we start putting all our
[1:05:09] faith in the finished work of cavalry
[1:05:12] and say Lord no matter what the devil no
[1:05:17] matter how he would treat my life and
[1:05:18] what he was said about me

[1:05:37] place putting our faith in the finished
[1:05:42] work I was telling that yesterday
[1:05:45] brother scary just blew my mind
[1:05:47] I mean to realize how much how much the
[1:05:52] feeling work the finished work at
[1:05:54] cavalry means told the believer when you
[1:06:00] believe in what Christ did for you on
[1:06:03] the cross and you put your faith in it
[1:06:07] and I mean every morning you wake up you
[1:06:10] look at the Lamb of God on the cross
[1:06:12] when you feed pains in your body you
[1:06:15] look at the cross and you said he was
[1:06:18] bruised for my iniquity he was trusting
[1:06:21] for my peace you keep that in your mind
[1:06:23] you will see how the benefit of cavalry
[1:06:28] will start producing in your body
[1:06:30] many times we rely on our strength and
[1:06:33] you think that you have the joy of the
[1:06:36] Lord because you are reading your Bible
[1:06:38] you are praying your out of that but
[1:06:43] it's all in the finished work it's all
[1:06:48] in the finished work that's what Jesus

[1:06:51] if I be lifted up and we draw all men
[1:06:55] unto me that thing just hit me yesterday

[1:07:09] work because there were all the works
[1:07:14] was done there is nothing that you would
[1:07:17] do that we ever be compared to what
[1:07:19] Christ did on the cross for you all we
[1:07:25] are doing just a life of appreciation to

[1:11:02] things we were studying together in all
[1:11:06] Andes he just jump out of the chair and
[1:11:08] he told me nieces he says he says pastor

[1:11:49] want to have communion but you never
[1:11:51] have communion in the morning you always
[1:11:53] have communion in the evening why can't
[1:11:57] we just do it in the morning so I told
[1:12:03] him I said well okay let the Bible speak
[1:12:04] for itself
[1:12:05] let's go in the scripture you know we
[1:12:08] went through some few things in the
[1:12:10] scripture and you know and try to show
[1:12:14] him and word I think the Lord caught his
[1:12:18] attention I said to him I says when God
[1:12:21] instituted this under the Passover he
[1:12:25] told Israel that this is the beginning
[1:12:29] of months the communion is a new
[1:12:35] beginning it's a new beginning it's not
[1:12:42] just a ritual we come talk yeah and then
[1:12:45] we just take that the the wine and bread
[1:12:48] it's a new beginning
[1:12:49] it breaks us into a new day it starts a
[1:12:53] new life for us and new Kalama new
[1:12:56] habits not only NASA swen gone started a
[1:13:04] new beginning from the beginning the
[1:13:07] Bible says the evening and the morning
[1:13:10] was the first thing so when he was going
[1:13:16] to start a new beginning with Israel
[1:13:19] he said started the evening to the
[1:13:21] morning that's the first day so it's
[1:13:28] just not a church ratio what we just
[1:13:29] come and just take wine and umbrella and
[1:13:32] and and and you know and know it's a new
[1:13:36] beginning
[1:13:37] it must be able to break us into into
[1:13:40] more love for God more submission to
[1:13:44] God's Word that's where we come and we
[1:13:48] commit our habits and say Lord we are
[1:13:51] lame this habit this line habit on you
[1:13:54] this in war
[1:13:56] hobbit can't dress right all of these
[1:13:58] things we are laying it right on you I
[1:14:00] can't do it in myself I'm putting it on
[1:14:03] you I'm laying my hands I'm confessing
[1:14:06] my sins I want a new beginning when you
[1:14:14] realize that Almighty God lives in you
[1:14:18] immortal life that's what verb random
[1:14:21] says Paul says there in the book of
[1:14:24] Timothy how in mortality the death of
[1:14:33] Jesus release immortality to us when
[1:14:40] Paul says this mortar must put on
[1:14:44] immortality we keep it for when we die
[1:14:49] no immortalize comes in a believer the
[1:14:59] thing that gives you the desire to take
[1:15:03] highs are going to be like in heaven
[1:15:09] corruption cannot think about in
[1:15:12] corruption
[1:15:15] the thing that is giving you the desire
[1:15:17] to desire walking on street of God to
[1:15:26] eat from the tree of life is that
[1:15:32] dwelling of immortality
[1:15:39] cus unless you want to make the holy
[1:15:42] ghost human the Holy Ghost is immortal
[1:15:46] spirit they can't die
[1:15:49] it wasn't it never had a beginning and
[1:15:52] never had an end so for you for us to
[1:15:55] have the Holy Ghost in us is the present
[1:15:58] of immortality it's an evidence that we
[1:16:04] going across the river to a life Elaine
[1:16:11] where we never get all read Branham says
[1:16:13] now the church now that was once dress
[1:16:18] like their little he sees the church now
[1:16:21] that was one dress like there are little
[1:16:26] manger experience that we have been true
[1:16:30] has come to a place now that the people
[1:16:34] are realizing that deity and the power
[1:16:39] of Almighty God is living in the human
[1:16:44] being
[1:16:45] oh I wish I had no language to speak
[1:16:51] this thing I wish I had a way to say it
[1:16:54] I wish I had a way to say it that we are
[1:17:01] realizing Church we are realizing that
[1:17:07] deity the power of Almighty God is
[1:17:12] living don't measure God's power with
[1:17:17] the weakness of your strength know his
[1:17:22] strength is made our of tamanna feste
[1:17:30] manifest his strength in your weakness
[1:17:40] realizing that dear teh Almighty God
[1:17:43] your Creator is living in you he can
[1:17:47] create new habit he can create new
[1:17:52] desire because the Creator is living in
[1:17:56] you that's what the Holy Ghost is look
[1:18:00] on us look on us Peter had a testimony
[1:18:08] he had a testimony look on us and as the
[1:18:12] moment he the Bible said he fast in his
[1:18:15] eyes he fast in his eyes he was looking
[1:18:19] right in the eyes of man that's a true
[1:18:21] witness men and women if the Holy Ghost
[1:18:31] is dwelling in you he says the Christ
[1:18:36] that was born 1980
[1:18:40] came to manhood he's never stayed in a
[1:18:46] cradle the Christ that was born in the
[1:18:53] manger has come as a man that's a man oh
[1:19:02] when the word says give us a man we have
[1:19:05] the man we have the man the man the
[1:19:09] scripture says when a man of the house
[1:19:11] he is the man of this house the
[1:19:16] scripture said when a good man of the
[1:19:17] house he is the good man of this house
[1:19:22] give us good health he give us strength
[1:19:27] that's part of all the different health
[1:19:30] issues that are all there running down
[1:19:32] you know our genetics but the good man
[1:19:35] of the house he's in control when we
[1:19:40] realize that he's the good man of this
[1:19:43] house and we can say look on us
[1:19:54] to realize that the holy spirit young
[1:20:00] people we are more than able brothers
[1:20:03] and sisters the Holy Ghost is our
[1:20:05] inheritance and then is our inheritance
[1:20:09] you cannot do without it for a rapture
[1:20:12] there is no way you can go in the
[1:20:13] rapture without all egos so the Holy
[1:20:17] Ghost is our inheritance is our portion
[1:20:20] it's given to us you know there's a way
[1:20:24] that brother Branham spoke about it in
[1:20:26] there in a source imprison and it's very
[1:20:34] beautiful and that is the reason why he
[1:20:38] said that the talking message was the
[1:20:42] highlight of his ministry because it was
[1:20:48] the life the life is in the blood and it
[1:20:53] was the life of the animal on display
[1:20:58] and then the life of the animal was on
[1:21:01] display before the public the animal was
[1:21:04] killed
[1:21:05] and his life was was spread over the
[1:21:09] doorposts the life of Christ on display
[1:21:13] that's what the talking is that's what
[1:21:17] he have caught a stroke but you see it
[1:21:19] is not in our power it's not like we can
[1:21:22] do it he just want us to make ourself
[1:21:25] available he want us to just to just
[1:21:29] believe total obedience just believe
[1:21:32] just surrounding our surface and Lord
[1:21:34] yeah I know it was because of me you
[1:21:37] went to cavalry he want to put his life
[1:21:40] on this plane he want you to be Christ
[1:21:48] on the job he want you to be Christ in
[1:21:53] your home Christ to the neighbor coming
[1:22:00] to the realization that a creator of
[1:22:03] heaven in F the very power that brought
[1:22:07] the word to it existence it's living in
[1:22:11] us that is the that is the level that he
[1:22:19] have caught off to look on us praise the
[1:22:25] Lord
[1:22:26] if we just believe that the God that
[1:22:33] created the heaven in the earth it's
[1:22:35] living in us you will not be afraid to
[1:22:38] pray for your friends you will not be
[1:22:42] afraid to just ask someone let's bow our
[1:22:47] heads and pray father I commit them into
[1:22:51] your hands because he don't have no feet
[1:22:59] for yours
[1:23:01] no hands for ours no mal he has to speak
[1:23:06] but you with me but this is the one that
[1:23:11] is in our maze this is the one that is
[1:23:15] in our maze we are not trying to be
[1:23:18] different from the rest of the world we
[1:23:22] are not trying to make seven god
[1:23:25] complicated there is no need of doing
[1:23:31] that I have here people you know this is
[1:23:34] well you know this message this message
[1:23:37] is it's not just for everybody it's not
[1:23:39] just for anybody this message is too
[1:23:41] hard when we go to that if God would
[1:23:48] have made this message high you would
[1:23:50] not be in the message you will not be
[1:23:53] safe because if God make it high you
[1:23:58] have to be harder than God to come in
[1:24:05] just the grace of God if he can save me
[1:24:12] he can save anybody if he can change my
[1:24:21] life he can change the life of anybody
[1:24:32] to know that it's Almighty God the life
[1:24:38] of God the breath of God coming to the
[1:24:45] realization that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:24:47] is it's nothing less than God it's not
[1:24:50] the first person it's not a tear person
[1:24:53] making the Holy Ghost that tear person
[1:24:56] you're making you you reducing God the
[1:25:02] Holy Ghost is nothing less than Almighty
[1:25:06] God humbling himself the same God that
[1:25:10] came in the form of a baby in the manger
[1:25:14] he said a son a super Sam Jehovah crying
[1:25:21] crying Jehovah crying and he walked he
[1:25:30] grew in stature and understanding if we
[1:25:40] just understand him the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:43] nothing less than God nothing less than
[1:25:50] God and if he's dwelling in you I tell
[1:25:54] you tonight you don't need to break the
[1:25:57] chair to make him move the hall we did
[1:26:02] all of those things we banned the word
[1:26:04] knock our head on the wall
[1:26:06] Oh God and trying to bring God on the
[1:26:10] scene he's just right there
[1:26:21] you don't have to break the bed you
[1:26:28] don't have to break the bench
[1:26:32] Almighty God this Holy Ghost is nothing
[1:26:37] and we can say look on us I believe that
[1:26:44] God placed us at that place system 900
[1:26:50] humble Avenue to be a voice that says
[1:26:54] look on us those disciples were not
[1:27:00] talking about the way they dress they
[1:27:03] were not calling that man that man was
[1:27:05] hungry begging trying to get something
[1:27:08] maybe he had a wife and children trying
[1:27:10] to just get something to go and make a
[1:27:13] meal he didn't care about what clothes
[1:27:15] they wear while shoes were on there that
[1:27:18] was not what he was looking for he never
[1:27:20] went down there to compared who's having
[1:27:22] the finest clothes coming to the temple
[1:27:23] he was hungry he just needed life that's
[1:27:27] all he needed and I believe that's what
[1:27:35] the word nee today they just need life
[1:27:39] there are caught up in all the faction
[1:27:42] because they are filling their mind with
[1:27:44] Hollywood but what really Denis is life
[1:27:48] they are testing for the life of Jesus
[1:27:52] Christ and God in a humble way has
[1:27:58] choose you and myself to represent him
[1:28:02] we just have to believe
[1:28:04] the thing that is dwelling in us is
[1:28:06] nothing less than Almighty God you have
[1:28:12] Almighty God dwelling in you
[1:28:19] that's the reason why he says when you

[1:28:26] agree upon anything in my name are we
[1:28:30] answer he want us to believe that he
[1:28:34] that is in us is greater than he that is

[1:28:43] your mind and things of this world can
[1:28:48] be appealing to your flesh but you have
[1:28:52] to know that he that is in you it's a
