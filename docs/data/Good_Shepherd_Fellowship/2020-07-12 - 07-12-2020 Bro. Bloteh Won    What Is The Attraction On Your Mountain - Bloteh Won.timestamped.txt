[22:38] [Music]
[23:46] out of the a grease I actually asked you
[23:49] this morning just before we left and I
[23:52] think I'll just do that more often just
[23:54] to worry about whether she's going to
[23:56] miss and don't just get up there and do
[23:58] it and so god bless you grace and
[24:00] sweetheart I apologize I thought about
[24:02] having both of you get up there so he
[24:04] could pick up that harmony to you so the
[24:06] next time we're gonna get both of you up
[24:09] here to play now actually maybe you can
[24:11] get Joe and Rebecca Maia quartet play a
[24:15] little special so uh Rebecca and joy I'm
[24:18] just putting you on the list
[24:20] so I better get practicing so I can see
[24:24] all can do it together so appreciate
[24:27] that so much at all so I'm gonna ask for
[24:30] the blotchy to come this morning we're
[24:33] gonna sing the one song but the blah
[24:37] blah T and I love to sing while we love
[24:40] to sing all of them but it's just over
[24:42] the years I remember Bertha blocky I
[24:44] think is the one that introduced me to
[24:45] that song I woke up this morning that's
[24:47] in the key of F and so as you know the
[24:53] is a long time song leader always
[24:56] associate different people with
[24:58] different songs and over the years and
[25:01] this is the one I always associate for
[25:03] the block' with this I woke up this
[25:05] morning and so it gives us a chance to
[25:08] kind of chase
[25:11] [Music]
[25:12] so as soon as the preacher appears
[25:15] comes up here to sing along with me
[25:19] we're going to see I trust you've just
[25:23] enjoyed the service so far scenes of God

[34:06] not too good to be without you for the
[34:10] many of you that are home and I will
[34:13] tell you there this building is so
[34:15] crowded it's so full there is no space
[34:19] so safe so crowded and I see the injured
[34:24] standing all over wires all over the
[34:27] place
[34:28] praise the Lord you know how going to
[34:31] preach on Jacob ladder that's what I
[34:34] told brother Jordan and brother Andrews
[34:36] last night
[34:37] it was so easy for me to get a message
[34:39] because ladders are all over the place
[34:45] I can bring one of them here and just
[34:47] claim on it just hang on and preach to
[34:50] you this I wish I was brother Deeks I
[34:53] could do that just bring one ladder
[34:58] claim on it just hang hang hang on and
[35:01] just preach praise a little bet we are
[35:04] so grateful we are so grateful and we
[35:08] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[35:09] Jesus we thank the law for the safe trip
[35:13] sister now me
[35:13] thank you sister grace to see you and
[35:19] our young brothers becoming men it's
[35:22] good to see you also praise the Lord you
[35:28] know we were singing this song just Nana
[35:31] I thought why all this why we never
[35:33] signed this on just a little while
[35:35] that's all we needed just a way to get
[35:37] back to this place because every week it
[35:39] was just a little while
[35:41] [Laughter]
[35:46] praise the Lord but I once again I would
[35:49] say thanks to all the brothers I mean
[35:53] all through the week being working I
[35:56] mean if you could come here just
[35:58] yesterday or the day before the whole
[36:00] front was just filled with cabbage the
[36:03] brothers brought Ben but Lawrence but a
[36:08] jam baby and all the other brothers have
[36:10] been coming through the week to help get
[36:13] this place together
[36:16] the brothers just brother Jordan and his
[36:18] team just did this set up just so we can
[36:22] be able to bring the service from here
[36:25] this morning so hopefully we can all now
[36:30] believe that we can be back in church
[36:33] because we are bringing the service to
[36:35] you from here this morning so by the way
[36:39] next Sunday we will have our first
[36:42] service back in church and we will have
[36:47] a morning service and an evening service
[36:50] just to be able to rededicate ourselves
[36:53] with this building will have a forest
[36:56] farmer preaching for us so let's come
[37:00] and we will bring to you the different
[37:04] announcement as we come back the Deacons
[37:11] will take the responsibility to seat us
[37:14] as we are coming so when you come in the
[37:17] building find a deacon and then they
[37:19] will be able to put you to your seat
[37:21] just don't go to a seat you know find
[37:24] that they can they will be able to seat
[37:25] you because we will be seeded by
[37:28] families and in the best way we can to
[37:33] be able to keep
[37:35] [Music]
[37:36] the Lord of the lane and we have also
[37:40] got something like this and that we
[37:46] would love to use in church this I can't
[37:50] even put it around my face and preach to
[37:51] you this morning
[37:52] so I think you can hear me
[37:58] I think you can hear me can I preach
[38:02] like this
[38:03] don't be scary but we got we are the
[38:13] some of these and if you want to come
[38:16] with your personal max that's okay but
[38:21] everybody will be handed one of these so
[38:25] we can be able to use that because we
[38:27] want to use most of the space so if we
[38:30] can max ourself up and we help us you
[38:34] know to be able to use most of the space
[38:37] but after the Deacons has finished
[38:40] setting family in the building I wish
[38:43] that the camera could turn to the back
[38:48] of the building so you can see our our
[38:50] extra space and fellowship hall tent
[38:54] meeting
[38:55] everything is happening in the back so
[38:58] we will have cheers in the back we will
[39:02] have a monitor out there for those that
[39:07] want to enjoy the service just like Adam
[39:10] in the Garden of Eden you can go under
[39:12] the trees and sit right there and enjoy
[39:15] the service stay under the tent and that
[39:19] would be for those that want to do that
[39:21] and also for those that will be coming
[39:23] late because after the Deaconess have
[39:25] sat everyone in church if anyone come
[39:29] after you will be referred to go back
[39:31] there so those are a few things that we
[39:34] will be practicing to do as we come back
[39:37] to the building Wednesday night there
[39:40] will be no service we are still working
[39:42] on running wires and setting of the
[39:46] microphones the projectors need to be
[39:49] set up you will not believe what the
[39:51] projector was on I even thought that
[39:53] brother Scott would make a comment about
[39:55] it but I will leave that one I will pass
[40:00] because we have one projector on the
[40:02] ladder so I don't think you want to come
[40:04] to church with your projector on the
[40:06] ladder so we have to do all of that in
[40:08] the week and then if we can be able to
[40:13] achieve anything much before Wednesday
[40:16] night we might just ask some of the
[40:18] musicians who come and try their
[40:20] instruments and then those that would be
[40:23] around the building that evening we will
[40:25] have a little prayer meeting but there
[40:28] will be no service Wednesday night the
[40:31] services will be Sunday morning and
[40:33] after the service I mean we can hang
[40:36] behind here visible one another and then
[40:40] in the evening just before the evening
[40:42] service I would love to play the message
[40:47] that brother Forrest farmer was praying
[40:54] for in that message and when his parents
[40:59] took him to brother Branham meeting
[41:00] because I would love for him to bring a
[41:03] little bit of his testimony after that
[41:05] message so right before the evenings the
[41:08] morning in the evening service we will
[41:10] play that message and then he will come
[41:14] and testify to us preach to us and we
[41:18] all we pray together as we rededicate
[41:20] ourselves and I were building back in
[41:23] the hands of God so that is the program
[41:26] for the coming weekend Wednesday night
[41:29] again there is no service if you want to
[41:33] come around there state things to do we
[41:36] are still cleaning up yesterday some
[41:40] things around the building to do we
[41:42] appreciate your help if you have the
[41:44] time to come so but we are so glad
[41:50] we want to thank once again all the
[41:53] brothers in general they're putting
[41:56] extra amount of time to come and help
[42:00] get us to where we are today once again
[42:05] thank you brother Jordan thank you
[42:07] sister faith for letting us use your
[42:09] home we we missed that little upper room
[42:17] lower room it was a lower room it was
[42:19] not a no problem we needed to humble
[42:21] ourself for the law to bring us up so we
[42:29] appreciated that space that you give us
[42:32] for us to run the service there out of
[42:35] this time we are so so so grateful so
[42:38] grateful and we pray that the Lord will
[42:40] remember you in all your endeavors
[42:44] praise the Lord where do we start from
[42:46] this morning and one thing oh my
[42:49] goodness oh my goodness you know when
[42:53] when when a child of God said something
[42:56] you know and and he just have that or

[51:28] father to let go and let God have his
[51:31] way but Lord we want to thank you
[51:35] for the portion on the measure of faith
[51:37] that you have given to us Lord the
[51:40] father we can say we believe help our
[51:43] unbelief the law become humbling to you
[51:47] knowing that father we don't have no
[51:49] ability of our own it was just good to
[51:53] hang around the brothers yesterday
[51:56] fellowship laughed and all of the earth
[51:58] norine father it was when our Lord to
[52:02] speak to your people this morning some
[52:06] way we kept our hearts and our mind
[52:08] before you asking that log we will not
[52:11] come with vain bubbling Lord Jesus but
[52:14] you will find oh God faith Lord Jesus in
[52:19] the prayers of your people and give us
[52:22] something to say there will be of intent
[52:25] of value the law we ask that you bless
[52:28] the service this morning father even
[52:31] though it's not a dedication Lord God
[52:34] that we will love to do but as we stand
[52:36] further back to this place where we have
[52:39] preached from Lord and we have prayed
[52:41] for the second
[52:42] and your children have testified they
[52:44] has sunk from Oh God and and we can just
[52:48] flow back in our minds this morning the
[52:51] memories that can fill this house that
[52:53] it will not be able to contain but Lord
[52:56] we are so grateful that father once
[52:58] again we can stand from this place and
[53:01] call upon your name we want to ask the
[53:04] Lord God you will come and just bless
[53:07] this portion of the service while we
[53:10] anxiously await for the weekend coming
[53:13] where we can come back together and just
[53:16] have an hour of singing and where the
[53:21] whole house would just be filled that
[53:23] Lord gather they will not even be a
[53:25] place for the minister to stand but
[53:29] until then we commit ourselves in your
[53:32] hands now we love you and we appreciate
[53:35] you Father thank you for your manifold
[53:38] blessings in Jesus name we humbly pray
[53:41] amen amen Allah bless you you may have
[53:45] your seed water promise they that trust
[53:49] the Lord
[53:51] this word trust has been a bit on the
[53:56] hook for me when when I heard someone
[54:06] said I was I think I was reading
[54:08] something or listening to something I
[54:10] heard someone said every day God gave us
[54:14] mercy for us to be able to trust him
[54:17] that never leaves my mind it haunts me
[54:20] every morning when I wake up another day
[54:23] for me to trust God more than I did
[54:25] yesterday did I trust the Lord shall be
[54:30] as Mounds anjum which cannot be removed
[54:34] but a Bharath forever they that trust
[54:40] the Lord be as Messiaen
[54:44] which cannot be removed or a Barrett
[54:47] forever as the mountains are round about
[54:50] Jerusalem so the Lord is run about his
[54:55] people
[54:56] from Haynesville even forever I tried to
[55:00] look into why studying this during the
[55:04] week and I was looking into different
[55:06] commentaries but all the most of the
[55:09] commentators are going to talk about the
[55:11] geographical position of Jerusalem and
[55:16] how is surrounded by mountains and but
[55:20] there was just something that was
[55:21] speaking to my heart more than just the
[55:25] geographical position of Jerusalem and I
[55:30] hope that the law can be able to help us
[55:33] this morning that we can be able to just
[55:36] bring that to you there just something
[55:38] there was so my heart and what I want to
[55:42] talk about this morning I want to talk
[55:45] about I'm going to take mountains that's
[55:51] what I tied to it what is the attraction
[55:53] on your mountain I was I was reading or
[55:57] studying the message or listening to the
[55:59] Prophet talking about what is the
[56:01] attraction on the mountain and he read
[56:05] of Jesus you know coming into Jerusalem
[56:08] Zachariah prophecy and and he said there
[56:13] that was there was an attraction he's
[56:15] coming into Jerusalem because the
[56:18] Prophet Zachariah has already prophesied
[56:21] so it create an attraction so we
[56:25] realized that when God is fulfilling his
[56:28] word it always create an attraction when
[56:33] God is fulfilling his word whether in
[56:36] your life whether in a nation were in
[56:40] your home it will always create an
[56:43] attraction but most of the time I think
[56:47] we are distracted there sometimes we
[56:50] don't see it he creates an attraction to
[56:55] get our attention whenever God is
[57:00] fulfilling his word he will always want
[57:04] to get our attention now so there are a
[57:08] few things that we that we will
[57:10] we were read about that but I want for
[57:14] the stew why we deal with this I want us
[57:18] to offer us to look in Jesus ministry
[57:20] and look at two mountains at the early
[57:24] part of Jesus ministry he was on one
[57:26] mountain that we might want to term call
[57:30] the the mountain of temptation
[57:36] the Bible says after he was baptized by
[57:39] John he was led away by the spirit
[57:42] straight into the wilderness and when he
[57:48] went into the wilderness we know what
[57:51] happened he was tempted of the devil
[57:54] praise the Lord there was an attraction
[58:01] on that mountain and you see with all
[58:07] the things that were happening on our
[58:10] Mountain I'm taking your experience as
[58:12] an as a mountain with all the things
[58:15] that were happy see what David said as
[58:18] the mountains are round about Jerusalem
[58:23] so God is around about his people so
[58:33] just around our lives if we are not
[58:38] having our heads hanging Lord if we just
[58:41] look up to the hills we're coming our
[58:44] help we will be able to see God whether
[58:47] we are looking left whether we are
[58:48] looking right what are we are looking
[58:50] forward whatever we are looking
[58:52] backwards as much as we keep our heads
[58:54] up because the Lord is around about his
[58:58] people praise the Lord
[59:05] so
[59:10] there is an attraction on every mountain
[59:18] and like I was saying there the
[59:22] temptation of our Lord Jesus there was
[59:25] an attraction what what was the
[59:27] attraction we might look at a set on
[59:30] showing Jesus the word you know throw
[59:33] yourself down turn these stones into
[59:35] bread we might look at the temptation
[59:38] but I don't believe there was the
[59:40] attraction I was on that mountain that
[59:42] also could be an attraction some people
[59:45] are attracted to death but this is
[59:50] something that brother Branham said in a
[59:52] message what is the attraction on the
[59:54] mountain then I'm using as an
[59:56] inspiration to establish what I want to
[59:59] bring to you is there on every mountain
[1:00:02] God is fulfilling his word the word the
[1:00:08] fulfillment of the word the word is more
[1:00:13] valuable than our experience every
[1:00:18] mountain is an experience in the life of
[1:00:21] a believer but it is not just for the
[1:00:25] seen it's not just for for our action in
[1:00:28] our reaction and what we did in and how
[1:00:31] we did it but it is that for filming of
[1:00:34] the word praise the Lord
[1:00:43] go attracted Moses on the mountain I'm
[1:00:46] going to be all over the place now he
[1:00:48] attracted Moses on the mountain and
[1:00:50] Moses saw the burning bush but what was
[1:00:55] that attraction for it was not just for
[1:00:59] a scene it was not just for a bush on
[1:01:02] fire that is burning and the leaves is
[1:01:05] not burning what was the attraction for
[1:01:14] the attraction was for a promise that he
[1:01:17] made to Abraham the attraction was for a
[1:01:23] word now the reason why I'm saying that
[1:01:26] because when you when we all come back
[1:01:28] to church there will be a lot of
[1:01:29] attraction around the building you might
[1:01:33] be looking at the Capitol you might be
[1:01:35] looking at the pin or this is different
[1:01:37] on that that is different musicians are
[1:01:38] different and you see you you get caught
[1:01:41] up in all those things and you could
[1:01:42] miss the reason of all of those things
[1:01:49] is that the word must have the
[1:01:52] preeminence in our means if you miss
[1:01:55] there you miss everything and you can
[1:01:59] complain about everything and I hope the
[1:02:03] Lord help me not to care because I cared
[1:02:05] a lot but there is the reason of every
[1:02:14] experience is now what you are going
[1:02:17] through is what God is doing it's now
[1:02:23] what you are going through it's what God
[1:02:25] is doing if you focus on what you are
[1:02:29] going through and not see what he's
[1:02:31] doing
[1:02:31] you miss the attraction that is on that
[1:02:34] mountain oh there's a lot of room for me
[1:02:38] to run around this morning amen I will
[1:02:48] together praise the Lord
[1:02:52] so yeah on Jesus temptation on that
[1:02:58] mountain and you know the the devil was
[1:03:03] trying to I mean to throw his bed you
[1:03:06] know he was saying it's written you know
[1:03:08] he was he was he was pointed to the
[1:03:10] world and trying to use that and and
[1:03:14] distract Jesus from the world you know
[1:03:16] he would give his angels charge over you
[1:03:18] that's that's a son you know and and and
[1:03:21] all of that but like brother branham
[1:03:25] said he overcame the devil
[1:03:28] but the word he's still with the word
[1:03:32] turn these stones into bread he could
[1:03:35] have done it and it could have been
[1:03:38] another experience the children of
[1:03:43] Israel fell bread I came from heaven but
[1:03:47] he could have turned those stones into
[1:03:49] bread and it would have been an
[1:03:50] experience but it will have not
[1:03:53] fulfilled the word it was going to break
[1:03:59] the type of the world why because he
[1:04:02] will not be listening to God he will be
[1:04:04] listening to the devil but we realized
[1:04:14] that he stayed with the word in and it
[1:04:20] said say don't get thee behind me now
[1:04:24] after dad attraction on their mountain
[1:04:31] there was another attraction on another
[1:04:36] mountain that is called Mount
[1:04:38] Transfiguration I hope you following me
[1:04:45] you know I'm not a good preacher so you
[1:04:47] gotta follow me to be able to grab where
[1:04:49] I'm going OS I mean you'd be listening
[1:04:52] to my dalit oh my Transfiguration Jesus
[1:04:58] took Peter James and John
[1:05:04] now watch now this was right after
[1:05:08] Matthew chapter 16 when Jesus has asked
[1:05:13] that question who do you think ah the
[1:05:18] son of man him praise the Lord who do
[1:05:26] you think are the son of man I am now
[1:05:30] you can see the reason of that question
[1:05:33] was for them not to be stuck in his
[1:05:36] flesh
[1:05:39] he never wanted them to be stuck in his
[1:05:42] flesh because whatever he was was going
[1:05:47] to go after the flesh after the flesh is
[1:05:51] they're very resurrected as saying there
[1:05:54] wherever he was was there remain so the
[1:06:00] question was for them not to be stuck
[1:06:02] with won't be a scene in the flesh what
[1:06:08] do you think yeah I the Son of Man and
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:15] praise the Lord Amen you know better but
[1:06:23] Jordan was just we're just talking a
[1:06:26] little bit in and I mean whether the the
[1:06:30] preachers are going to work max to
[1:06:33] preach and you just suggested put in the
[1:06:38] plastic sheeting yeah so I don't know
[1:06:41] maybe we might just run it down there
[1:06:46] since we don't have a poopy I mean a
[1:06:49] platform we could just call it up as
[1:06:52] this sacred ground holy ground
[1:06:59] praise the Lord
[1:07:02] amen just bear with me
[1:07:05] amen but so we realize here
[1:07:10] I wish of course I think that's a good
[1:07:12] idea but Jordan
[1:07:22] let me let me get back to what I'm
[1:07:24] saying I'm I'm a little bit distracted
[1:07:26] you so Peter said there were Christ son
[1:07:37] of the Living God and because see now
[1:07:42] Jesus never wanted to them to be stuck
[1:07:45] in the flesh so he had to identify this
[1:07:49] flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:07:52] you this is where I wanted you to go I
[1:07:57] wanted you to go beyond whatever you see
[1:08:00] flesh and blood doing he says you are
[1:08:07] Christ son of the Living God and Jesus
[1:08:13] said this just drop down from heaven the
[1:08:17] father just give it to you you were not
[1:08:20] born with it you are not born with
[1:08:24] understanding the Godhead you were not
[1:08:29] born with an Orion justification Santa
[1:08:32] Fe you were not born with it flesh and
[1:08:35] blood did not give it to you whatsoever
[1:08:38] experience that we have by grace flesh
[1:08:41] and blood did not give it to us it will
[1:08:47] not pass them it's not one of those
[1:08:51] things that goes down genetically no is
[1:08:58] the thing that God brings every son in a
[1:09:03] daughter to an experience but remember
[1:09:10] now the experience is not about what you
[1:09:14] are going through the experience is the
[1:09:17] fulfillment of the word praise Lord let
[1:09:24] me give you an example a little try says
[1:09:29] daddy I want to be baptized
[1:09:34] and it's okay go down to the water and
[1:09:40] that child is baptized in the name of
[1:09:43] the Lord Jesus Christ they being prayer
[1:09:48] wave they being I mean they being taught
[1:09:50] they been encouraged you know and
[1:09:52] talking to them and you know setting
[1:09:54] their mind
[1:09:56] looking for what I mean Peter said he
[1:09:59] says a garlic conscious that's that's a
[1:10:04] requirement for Baptists and garlic
[1:10:06] conscious that's what the Apostle Peter
[1:10:08] said because Baptist and show a good
[1:10:10] conscience towards God now so when that
[1:10:14] child goes under the water they I mean
[1:10:17] they've been expecting there to get off
[1:10:19] of the water thank you Jesus I mean they
[1:10:23] are pray for they have some form of an
[1:10:26] experience
[1:10:26] now that experience they have that
[1:10:29] attraction right there there is a father
[1:10:32] there is a word that has been fulfilled
[1:10:34] and what is that word there are baptized
[1:10:38] shall be saved a word has been fulfilled
[1:10:43] writing but what happy most of the time
[1:10:47] is that we go over the word and we major
[1:10:52] on the experience when I came from out
[1:10:54] of the water I mean something him or me
[1:10:58] and shake and that pressing get six with
[1:11:01] that and they leave the world behind and
[1:11:07] then when they I tried they say well it
[1:11:11] was not real but the world I was
[1:11:15] fulfilled was he that is baptized shall
[1:11:18] be saved now if you are major on that
[1:11:24] word that had been fulfilled if you take
[1:11:27] that word as your attraction I'm
[1:11:29] attracted to the word the word seized
[1:11:31] and when I'm baptized I'm saved if i
[1:11:34] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:36] Christ I will receive the but if you if
[1:11:38] you are attracted to that if that is
[1:11:40] your attraction no more
[1:11:42] war comes no matter what comes and
[1:11:47] temple with your experience because you
[1:11:51] are not attracted to your experience you
[1:11:54] are attracted to the prophecy that was
[1:11:56] fulfilled because heaven and earth will
[1:12:00] pass away but that word will never pass
[1:12:04] away praise the Lord
[1:12:09] oh I feel like preaching on the
[1:12:10] convention he mean I feel like I'm
[1:12:15] preaching on a convention I hope you
[1:12:18] feel the same because I will preach two
[1:12:20] or three hours this morning that's what
[1:12:23] I do on a convention now if you don't
[1:12:25] feel the same then you have to bring him
[1:12:27] back to a local church
[1:12:32] so after Matthew chapter 16 when Peter
[1:12:40] said that when Peter sit down at Christ
[1:12:45] son of the Living God Jesus Neal that
[1:12:52] something beyond flesh and blood has
[1:12:56] just happened so he took Peter James and
[1:13:01] John he took them to the mountain praise
[1:13:08] the Lord
[1:13:09] why because like better Branham said as
[1:13:13] spiritual revelation has been revealed
[1:13:17] now he's going to anchor their spiritual
[1:13:21] revelation in another spiritual
[1:13:23] revelation so he took them to the
[1:13:26] mountain and they're on the mountain
[1:13:29] appear Moses and Elijah now Peter has
[1:13:33] just said down at Christ
[1:13:37] Gallagher's the very word that created
[1:13:41] everything he had just said that almost
[1:13:48] Transfiguration Moses and Elijah
[1:13:52] appeared he says
[1:13:56] Oh world is good to be here just like I
[1:13:59] feel it's good to be here let's make one
[1:14:05] tabernacle for Moses let's make one for
[1:14:07] Elijah let's make one
[1:14:11] he has just brought his confession into
[1:14:17] contradiction and see what God would do
[1:14:22] what is what was the attraction on their
[1:14:25] Mountain also it was not Moses in Elijah
[1:14:31] it was not Moses and Elijah it was not
[1:14:35] even Jesus no what was the attraction it
[1:14:40] was the word being fulfilled this is my
[1:14:44] son yeah yeah him that was the
[1:14:50] attraction what is the attraction on
[1:14:56] your Mountain praise the Lord
[1:15:06] what is the attraction on your Mountain
[1:15:15] if you study history you know most
[1:15:22] religion most religion in the world
[1:15:25] mountains are sacred places for most
[1:15:30] religion in the world mountains are
[1:15:34] sacred places even atheists love
[1:15:40] mountains mountains are sacred to them
[1:15:47] praise the Lord
[1:15:50] there is something about mounting their
[1:15:54] God himself love mounting every time he
[1:16:01] would do something special he will bring
[1:16:04] his people on the mountain
[1:16:09] praise the Lord
[1:16:11] there is something about mounting that
[1:16:15] he loved what is the attraction on your
[1:16:20] Mountain praise the Lord
[1:16:26] so Peter after he said that and and and
[1:16:32] the scripture says a voice spoke out
[1:16:35] this is my beloved son hear ye him see
[1:16:39] what Peter said let's get in our Bible
[1:16:43] 2nd Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter
[1:16:49] 1 second Peter chapter 1
[1:17:09] now he's saying this you I mean you can
[1:17:12] read an entire chapter but let's drop
[1:17:14] down to verse 15 he said moreover I will
[1:17:18] endeavour that ye may be able after my
[1:17:22] decease to to have these things always
[1:17:25] in your remembrance for we have not
[1:17:31] followed
[1:17:32] Coenen divides feeble praise the Lord
[1:17:38] when we made known unto you the power
[1:17:42] and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:47] but where I witnesses of his Majesty's
[1:17:54] what Peter James and John saw on mass
[1:17:58] Transfiguration praise the Lord
[1:18:03] what the witness of man Transfiguration
[1:18:07] with God like bird random seed exalting
[1:18:10] the word above the laws and the prophets
[1:18:14] that's what God was fulfilling because
[1:18:17] all the Lord in the prophets was until
[1:18:19] John and after John the word came in
[1:18:23] flesh so God was assaulting his word
[1:18:27] above the laws and the prophets there
[1:18:30] are thoughts in his word above the five
[1:18:33] for ministry and a church member
[1:18:34] assaulting his word is the Word of God
[1:18:40] the Word of God the fulfillment of the
[1:18:44] word is the attraction whenever God is
[1:18:47] doing something it's not because of
[1:18:51] flesh and blood not because of any man
[1:18:53] God is doing it because of his word he's
[1:18:58] bringing his word to pass so after Peter
[1:19:01] have seen there the impact that that had
[1:19:06] on him
[1:19:13] he says I have to put you in remembrance
[1:19:17] helps you to remember that we are now
[1:19:21] following coning device feeble when we
[1:19:26] make known onto you the coming of the
[1:19:29] Lord Peter saw him in their stead Peter
[1:19:34] saw him after he was resurrected and I
[1:19:39] was walking that Jesus did after he came
[1:19:44] out of the grave and what he did was he
[1:19:52] created a mountain for all the disciples
[1:19:56] all the disciples are a little mountain
[1:20:03] every one of them had little experience
[1:20:06] of his resurrection st. John chapter 20
[1:20:14] tell us there after Mary Matalin went
[1:20:17] there they saw the tomb open he was not
[1:20:19] there she went she called Peter they all
[1:20:22] came the witnesses they saw the cloth
[1:20:24] and everything as soon as the left
[1:20:26] she steady when she turned around there
[1:20:35] was her Lord don't touch me I'm not a
[1:20:37] sinner to my father yet she got an
[1:20:42] experience she got an experience go and
[1:20:50] tell my bread means and why she's
[1:20:53] running to go and tell tell tell where
[1:20:56] the disciples he appeared to those two
[1:20:59] disciples on the road of Amaya's he
[1:21:04] sneaked behind him give them a little
[1:21:06] mountain oh man we thought that this was
[1:21:09] oh my goodness you remember on the sea
[1:21:12] what he did the last time you remember
[1:21:14] when he prayed I mean those people were
[1:21:16] going for the failure I was in their
[1:21:17] service they were carrying this boy for
[1:21:20] the Finneran and it stopped by him and
[1:21:22] he runs the board oh my goodness that
[1:21:24] was
[1:21:24] boria seven I mean it was testified I
[1:21:26] know all of these things he came at the
[1:21:29] end of the evening he revealed himself
[1:21:31] to them praise the Lord
[1:21:40] Mara went and told Peter and said I've
[1:21:45] seen the Lord I've seen the Lord Mary
[1:21:51] were you dreaming we were just there
[1:21:53] with you you came across we went there
[1:21:55] we saw the tomb open we were just there
[1:21:59] and the Lord knew you Peter
[1:22:02] he likes to argue so he did not even
[1:22:04] allow him to start arguing so much he
[1:22:06] came through the wall into right into
[1:22:08] the big hoorah there was his mounting
[1:22:13] there was an experience and Thomas was
[1:22:19] not there just before Thomas were coming
[1:22:22] he vanished Thomas came to said the law
[1:22:25] was here he said I don't believe it I
[1:22:29] have to put my hands in his palm I have
[1:22:33] to put my hands in his side okay only
[1:22:38] pressing God he heard that he knew there
[1:22:42] Thomas needed and a little boss of his
[1:22:45] faith well you see what that would do to
[1:22:48] Thomas when Jesus came and show his
[1:22:54] NASCAR hands to Thomas and said these
[1:23:00] words to him blessed are they they have
[1:23:07] not seen but believed praise the Lord
[1:23:12] those words Thomas we never forget about
[1:23:16] them the early church history tells that
[1:23:22] he went he went found a boat and went
[1:23:26] across the Atlantic at a part of the
[1:23:30] world where we call India today
[1:23:37] that experience that little experience
[1:23:44] affected him so much that he gave the
[1:23:49] rest of his life spreading the gospel in
[1:23:52] India and that part of the world praise
[1:23:59] the Lord
[1:24:01] and oh god how I hope that they how that
[1:24:06] would be the attraction when we get back
[1:24:10] into this building where we will come
[1:24:13] with our different experience I was
[1:24:15] listening to this message I was reading
[1:24:17] this scripture I hope that would be the
[1:24:20] attraction that will bring us back to
[1:24:22] this place well because if you don't
[1:24:29] have that attraction you come here and
[1:24:31] you will find all the Fox that we have
[1:24:34] never found you will find faults with
[1:24:39] the way people that Dickens are doing
[1:24:41] you will find fault with the way the
[1:24:42] preachers are preaching you will find
[1:24:44] fault with everything
[1:24:57] that would be our attraction because
[1:25:00] that was the birth of the early church
[1:25:03] when Christ revealed himself give all
[1:25:07] the believers and experience a little
[1:25:10] mounting a little boost to their faith
[1:25:12] something special that he did that he
[1:25:18] knew they were serving a risen Christ I
[1:25:25] hope you are coming to tell us what he
[1:25:29] did special why you said in your home
[1:25:33] and follow the service why you were
[1:25:37] reading your Bible why you were praying
[1:25:40] there's something special that he did in
[1:25:42] your life what is the attraction on your
[1:25:46] Mountain no matter how dry a mountain is
[1:25:54] it always has attraction mountains
[1:26:01] sometimes it's hard to have all the
[1:26:04] colorful flowers on the mountain I mean
[1:26:06] the pink is so height of the Sun it's
[1:26:08] there it's just it's just a dry place
[1:26:11] but there's just something about the
[1:26:15] mountain I used to have a neighbor he
[1:26:21] used to say he likes going and riding
[1:26:24] his back on the Colorado's mountain he
[1:26:28] would tell me he says Warren
[1:26:29] whenever I go up there I meet God on
[1:26:32] those mountains he said when you go to
[1:26:37] ride his back and he's getting up of
[1:26:39] those hills
[1:26:41] he says I meet God on this mountain he
[1:26:44] said it's so beautiful it's almost like
[1:26:46] you are getting close to God
[1:26:48] there is just something about the
[1:26:51] mountain there is something about what
[1:26:57] God have done in the life of a believer
[1:27:01] even though nobody believed it but you
[1:27:04] know because you were there when it
[1:27:08] happened
[1:27:13] what is the attraction on your Mountain
[1:27:21] Peter said we are not following Conan
[1:27:24] the device feeble as iron chapter 2
[1:27:27] let's look at this scripture together
[1:27:29] and see how as I describe the mountain
[1:27:33] year as I had chapter 2 oh praise the
[1:27:43] Lord
[1:27:57] as I up - - the Bible says the word that
[1:28:02] I hired the son of amos or concerning
[1:28:05] Judah and Jerusalem and it shall come to
[1:28:08] pass in the last day that the mountain
[1:28:14] of the Lord's house shall be established
[1:28:19] in the top of the mountains the
[1:28:24] mountains of the Lord house shall be
[1:28:26] established in the top of the mountains
[1:28:29] this is a prophecy that I am with Daniel
[1:28:32] chapter 2 in in revelation 13 but I
[1:28:35] won't go there I want to go another way
[1:28:38] now so the law has shall be established
[1:28:42] in the top of the mountains and shall be
[1:28:44] exalted above the hills and all the
[1:28:47] nations shall flow unto it and many
[1:28:52] people shall go and say come here and
[1:28:54] let us go up to the mountain of the Lord
[1:28:57] now you remember the the sin John
[1:29:00] chapter 4 that the woman are the well
[1:29:06] you remember her conversation with Jesus
[1:29:10] he says our father taught us that is on
[1:29:13] this mountain how now you said is in
[1:29:18] Jerusalem because when God met Jacob he
[1:29:28] met him on the mountain and you know
[1:29:32] what he told Jacob he says you were
[1:29:35] joining and I will meet you back to this
[1:29:37] place this very same mountain the very
[1:29:42] same mountain where Jacob saw the angels
[1:29:45] extending and descending oh my mind I'm
[1:29:49] back to Jacob's Ladder brother bring me
[1:29:51] one of the a ladder let me climb on it
[1:29:52] this morning

[1:29:59] same place where he saw the angels
[1:30:02] ascending and descending was the very
[1:30:05] same place where the angel of the Lord
[1:30:10] touch him it was at that very same spot
[1:30:15] where he ran so with the angel the the
[1:30:23] place that God bless him he saw he saw
[1:30:27] the angels of sinning he woke up from
[1:30:30] sleep he says all my goodness this is
[1:30:32] the house of God
[1:30:33] he puts pillows of stones down he near
[1:30:37] down there he lived his hands to God he
[1:30:39] wash him he said the prayer that has his
[1:30:42] father taught him how to say he pour out
[1:30:45] his heart to God everything that Isaac
[1:30:50] taught him when God who gave Isaac his
[1:30:56] owner personal experience it was on a
[1:30:58] mountain after he had gathered all the
[1:31:01] Wolves and any I mean so excited to see
[1:31:03] his sacrifice he ran around he I mean
[1:31:07] just a little boy he should have taught
[1:31:09] about him when they were coming from
[1:31:10] home said there are two Lord Father
[1:31:14] their altar is ready where is the
[1:31:16] sacrifice where is the sacrifice
[1:31:22] remember it was not about Abraham it was
[1:31:25] not about Isaac but it was a lamb that
[1:31:28] was cut in the ticket that's the word of
[1:31:31] God speaking about the Lamb of God that
[1:31:35] takes away the sin of the world when the
[1:31:41] world becomes our attraction when they
[1:31:46] experience fear we can stay hold the
[1:31:48] world because the world will never feel
[1:31:55] natural people can complain about how
[1:31:58] people falling of the breach and can
[1:31:59] complain but Urbana was done because
[1:32:01] article since is not the bride
[1:32:03] attraction the bride is attracted to the
[1:32:07] word that has been opened in this hour
[1:32:12] the experiences is none of our
[1:32:15] attraction you may be more confused if I
[1:32:22] was if I'm just stuck to the experiences
[1:32:23] more
[1:32:24] computer cuz I never even saw the man
[1:32:26] william branham then a more or less to
[1:32:31] believe that he did not even exist when
[1:32:35] I was not attracted to a man I was not
[1:32:37] attracted to a flesh-and-blood I was
[1:32:39] attracted to the revealed word the word
[1:32:41] I was often the word I can change my
[1:32:45] life the word I can set my feet on glory
[1:32:50] path that's the thing that attracted me
[1:32:59] what is the attraction on your Mountain
[1:33:02] he made glory be to God
[1:33:09] the same place that those angels came
[1:33:13] down it was the same place that the Lord
[1:33:16] Triple J copper God met him be and touch
[1:33:22] him on the hips
[1:33:23] that's very same spot he said I will
[1:33:26] meet you at this place so when Jacob
[1:33:31] came after many years he got a look
[1:33:34] around to see those stones that he
[1:33:36] gathered together it was a time just a
[1:33:42] memorial he got a look for those stones
[1:33:44] and and look in order this is the place
[1:33:48] yes at the place because he was gone for
[1:33:52] many years you will never remember when
[1:33:54] he had to work the first seven years for
[1:33:57] Rebecca and again he Leah that I'm you
[1:34:00] know 14 almost 14 16 20 years he was
[1:34:02] gone how will he come back and remember
[1:34:05] the very spot where God met him if he
[1:34:10] did not planted a stone there he will
[1:34:13] never remember it was at that very place
[1:34:16] he rasa with the angel and God changed
[1:34:19] his name

[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] what is the attraction on your Mountain
[1:34:37] praise the Lord
[1:34:39] you tell me glory be to God o mine
[1:34:47] because sooner you will realize that the
[1:34:50] same thing that attracted you on your
[1:34:52] Mountain it was the same thing that I
[1:34:53] sought on my Mountain maybe in different
[1:34:55] ways
[1:34:57] you know people get so stuck to the
[1:34:59] elements around the attraction until the
[1:35:02] thing that the experience is moved and
[1:35:04] the other people experience that's what
[1:35:07] I period in the house of Colinas
[1:35:09] when he was preaching the world and so
[1:35:11] the Holy Ghost fell on those Gentiles
[1:35:14] speaking it tongue he back up he back up
[1:35:18] he knew that he could not require these
[1:35:20] people more than God have desire of them
[1:35:24] because if they never met God
[1:35:26] requirement he were I'm never giving
[1:35:28] them the Holy Ghost oh I feel so good
[1:35:31] praise the Lord I just feel like running
[1:35:34] down on the street with this thing in my
[1:35:37] hand and just shaking it all over the
[1:35:38] place where the sky praise the Lord Amen
[1:35:47] people just I mean get to that place in
[1:35:50] and and try to limit people because the
[1:35:54] thing that they have experienced God
[1:35:55] more than it than the other person tell
[1:35:58] me what was the attraction on your
[1:36:00] Mountain if you really saw the
[1:36:04] attraction on the mountain you'll
[1:36:06] realize there it was the same thing that
[1:36:08] attracted me on my Mountain because the
[1:36:12] attraction is the word the thing that
[1:36:16] attracted me into this place is the word
[1:36:18] I hope it's the same that is attracting
[1:36:20] you to this place because there is one
[1:36:23] thing that is assorted there is one
[1:36:25] thing like like like as I said yeah come
[1:36:28] on let's go to the house of the Lord
[1:36:30] what he said he says and many people shy
[1:36:33] go and come here and let us go up to the
[1:36:36] mountain of the Lord told the house of
[1:36:39] God of Jacob that is his promise on too
[1:36:44] shallow the gathering of the people will
[1:36:46] be on to the Lord now on to a man on to
[1:36:50] a church but unto the Lord because he is
[1:36:55] the attraction that is on the mountain
[1:37:02] he is the attraction that is on the
[1:37:06] mountain glory be to God what was the
[1:37:12] attraction on man cambia will say the
[1:37:18] noise of the bars prophets we know there
[1:37:21] was nothing in it because they cry they
[1:37:24] built they stripped himself cut himself
[1:37:26] nothing happened
[1:37:28] and sometimes people are attracted to
[1:37:31] all of those Pentecostal schemes see how
[1:37:33] he's jumping up see how he shouted see
[1:37:36] how he's nothing happened nothing
[1:37:39] happened it did all of that nothing
[1:37:41] happening well when he larger the
[1:37:47] Prophet came he said lord I have did all
[1:37:51] of this calling to your word that was
[1:37:57] the attraction there was the thing that
[1:38:00] brought the fire down he says I did all
[1:38:04] of this calling to your word
[1:38:14] homey praise Lord amen glory be to God
[1:38:23] oh my god Shepard I hope we are ready
[1:38:29] for this new match he made it's a word
[1:38:33] nothing less than the word Amen praise
[1:38:36] the Lord glory be to God he said I've
[1:38:41] done all of this I call into your word
[1:38:44] let the fire for God was then obligated
[1:38:49] he got a tour stones according to the
[1:38:53] trap of Israel he stoned to a tribe also
[1:38:58] I call into the heart of the people
[1:39:00] because the heart was turned away from
[1:39:02] God so he was representing them
[1:39:04] representing the heart and rebuilding
[1:39:06] the auto at the same time because the
[1:39:11] altar of the Lord was broken down see
[1:39:15] how big all of this calling to your word
[1:39:23] if you can see the word in that
[1:39:26] attraction don't be so excited about it
[1:39:29] maybe you can just enjoy the flames but
[1:39:33] don't be excited because it's not going
[1:39:35] to last if you can see the word in it
[1:39:40] don't be excited but if you see the word
[1:39:48] image then God is he's obligated to
[1:39:53] fulfill his word aiming what is a what
[1:40:00] is the attraction and the money but
[1:40:01] abarim says God then what was he doing
[1:40:05] what is that attraction of them on the
[1:40:08] hill is God making history God making
[1:40:14] history and we know the history it's
[1:40:17] very important because we with our
[1:40:19] history we will not even know where we
[1:40:21] are
[1:40:22] amen and we will know where we going
[1:40:25] back to
[1:40:27] so God give the believer a history
[1:40:32] he gave a believer a foundation stone
[1:40:42] praise the Lord
[1:40:50] it's gold making history and and go
[1:40:53] fulfilling prophecy and there are always
[1:40:58] causes an attraction when God is making
[1:41:05] history and God is fulfilling prophecy
[1:41:11] he always cause an attraction praise the
[1:41:19] Lord
[1:41:19] sometimes it's neither it's not a
[1:41:21] beautiful scene by a son of God a
[1:41:25] daughter of God will always be attracted
[1:41:29] because the preface is something it
[1:41:32] caused a chaos
[1:41:35] he mean what's on the mountain prophecy
[1:41:43] being fulfilled history be near prophecy
[1:41:48] being fulfilled salvation of the word
[1:41:50] has arrived was an attraction God was
[1:41:59] fulfilling his promise word the hour
[1:42:03] there have been waiting since 4000 years
[1:42:07] he's talking about Jesus but it's a
[1:42:12] scene with us what is the attraction
[1:42:15] what is the attraction you see all of
[1:42:18] these things that are happening around
[1:42:20] the message believe the Sun and all of
[1:42:23] these people you know what what what
[1:42:25] actually is the attraction you see that
[1:42:29] that is the thing work we ourself cannot
[1:42:32] put our mind around because this is the
[1:42:36] move of God it was the same in the days
[1:42:42] of Luter when when he's true against the
[1:42:45] church there were people they were that
[1:42:48] was very afraid for for him and taught
[1:42:50] that I mean he was committing treason
[1:42:52] and things that he was doing and yeah
[1:42:55] there were some that thought that a
[1:42:57] looter was not radical enough that was
[1:43:02] how men
[1:43:03] and like jingling and the rest of them
[1:43:06] that took the Luther revival and and
[1:43:08] they have formed all of these things we
[1:43:10] have today lots of days since a
[1:43:14] seven-day advantage the Amish people and
[1:43:19] how you call them again
[1:43:22] the Mennonites all of them came from out
[1:43:25] of that
[1:43:35] because when God caused an attraction
[1:43:38] people get attracted to it and it's
[1:43:41] sometimes I think that is it's not
[1:43:43] enough we have to make more noise with
[1:43:44] this we have to make more noise if it is
[1:43:51] really God and by this time we're
[1:43:55] supposed to be you know on the next on
[1:43:57] the next side I mean they have all their
[1:44:00] minds and that's that just what in the
[1:44:02] end that's how the enemy played on the
[1:44:06] mind of the people just like we were
[1:44:07] trying to talk about this Wednesday
[1:44:09] people playing God they never needed to
[1:44:17] break the Word of God to be God if they
[1:44:22] break the Word of God that would just be
[1:44:24] playing God God has already made him in
[1:44:28] his image out of his likeness they had
[1:44:32] the power to speak to creation and
[1:44:34] creation was listening to them one more
[1:44:36] that they need they were already gone
[1:44:42] well he took them from their first
[1:44:44] estate and brought them down to a low of
[1:44:47] falling estate and now men are playing
[1:44:51] God we want to be Holy Ghost for people
[1:44:58] we want to be leadership for people man
[1:45:01] I blame God I mean these things have all
[1:45:03] been around religion for a long time
[1:45:06] I've been in every age when God fulfill
[1:45:09] his word is it always causes an
[1:45:12] attraction always does it causes an
[1:45:15] attraction for it for it is their
[1:45:19] unusual so unusual when He fulfilled his
[1:45:23] word so the morning train of the day is
[1:45:27] so unusual to the moderate range of the
[1:45:33] day that's what I mean people will put
[1:45:36] so much pressure on the young people I
[1:45:39] well you don't know what you are missing
[1:45:41] it's better you don't know what you are
[1:45:43] missing then for you to know it and hope
[1:45:48] that you have missing
[1:45:51] and all of these things when God is
[1:45:55] fulfilling his word when he's fulfilling
[1:46:03] his word is unusual tall the more
[1:46:07] d-train praise the Lord is unusual
[1:46:15] toward the morning train let me see
[1:46:18] something here oh my goodness I've not
[1:46:22] even started in my notes yet praise the
[1:46:26] Lord when you look at the three Hebrew
[1:46:37] boys in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:46:44] we will realize here that you know
[1:46:48] that's that scripture stains out Daniel
[1:46:52] purposed in his heart not to define
[1:46:55] himself with the Kings meal there there
[1:46:58] there are a lot of things that is
[1:46:59] applied to death and I think one of the
[1:47:06] things if we want to bring that down to
[1:47:08] our age one of the things they are
[1:47:11] purposing in his heart sometimes the
[1:47:14] word we just think about it but I mean I
[1:47:19] would say we don't meditate upon it
[1:47:22] enough for it to drop down in our heart
[1:47:24] and we just think that yeah okay I mean
[1:47:26] you know I mean you just got a made up
[1:47:28] your mind but it's actually thinking
[1:47:31] about it I think there is a place of
[1:47:34] word you draw a line of resistance to
[1:47:43] control your appetite
[1:47:52] praise the Lord amen
[1:47:56] society has always been like that has
[1:48:00] always been like that even in the days
[1:48:03] of Egypt Jacob I mean Joseph was a young
[1:48:06] man society has always been in the place
[1:48:11] of taking the young minds and exposing
[1:48:15] them to things that are appetizing to be
[1:48:23] able to change the generation is so
[1:48:27] exposed to young minds to things that
[1:48:30] are appetizing praise the Lord
[1:48:41] just I mean Joseph was exposed to
[1:48:45] Potiphar wife he was just a young boy
[1:48:47] and dad who has poor his mind there
[1:48:52] could have changed him completely you
[1:48:54] know what that would have done it would
[1:48:56] have dropped hatred for him to remember
[1:48:59] to go back home he will never remember
[1:49:01] that it was going to change his identity
[1:49:05] completely if you have done that if you
[1:49:11] have changed his appetite leaving his
[1:49:16] girly values
[1:49:20] he was already dressing as an EgyptAir
[1:49:23] if he was not dressing as an Egyptian
[1:49:27] his brothers who have recognized him he
[1:49:29] hire his hair shaved
[1:49:33] he was already dressing he already was
[1:49:36] in the Egyptian culture he was speaking
[1:49:39] the language but there was an inner
[1:49:43] appetite there was an inner appetite
[1:49:47] that the only thing that he had in his
[1:49:50] heart that was longing for his father
[1:49:52] slain I could miss the only thing he had
[1:50:01] is this work he go to his sob he cried
[1:50:08] for his daddy cry for his brothers if he
[1:50:15] who have lost that I mean he was going
[1:50:19] to imprison his brothers he was going to
[1:50:22] revenge on them because he because he
[1:50:28] had changed his appetite
[1:50:39] praise the Lord that's what the devil in
[1:50:44] this age has brought all of these things
[1:50:48] I mean all of these things especially
[1:50:51] with the social media in or their if God
[1:50:57] has given us grace in parents to help us
[1:51:03] keep a balance we must be grateful for
[1:51:05] their because that's the thing the devil
[1:51:09] is using in this age to change the
[1:51:13] appetites of the young people that's
[1:51:23] what he's using to change their appetite
[1:51:26] and as soon as they start feeling on the
[1:51:31] the Kings meal they see everything down
[1:51:36] in Jerusalem is a cabbage
[1:51:49] price alone say everything down that is
[1:51:55] in cabbage then pretty song video I mean
[1:51:58] they want to speak like a Bobby Lord and
[1:52:01] they want to speak like a dress fly back
[1:52:04] it's not cutting away completely when
[1:52:08] your appetite is distraught that's why
[1:52:19] you see people the tribal minds and
[1:52:21] sometimes even when they are traveling
[1:52:23] they carry some special spices their
[1:52:26] mama face they will carry some things
[1:52:28] from home just to be able to keep that
[1:52:31] appetite to be able to sustain their
[1:52:36] appetite that no matter what they eat
[1:52:38] they can still remember the taste from
[1:52:40] whom because when your taste is gone you
[1:52:47] don't have anything again
[1:53:00] what is the attraction on your Mountain
[1:53:13] that's why we have of you know floods of
[1:53:17] all of these things you know and and and
[1:53:20] you know sometimes when people talk
[1:53:22] about this
[1:53:23] it's very hard to be put into the right
[1:53:26] prospectus in pretty soon it gets all
[1:53:29] mixed up with the politics but when
[1:53:31] people come to a prospering nation like
[1:53:35] this and they come from places were
[1:53:37] there I mean they had different
[1:53:39] difficulties and struggling well no
[1:53:41] matter where they came from
[1:53:42] not only Africa but when they come and
[1:53:44] they get exposed to all of this they
[1:53:49] what happened is that they start feeding
[1:53:52] on everything they can get they feel on
[1:53:54] the music defeat on the big television
[1:53:56] they feel on the changing of marriages
[1:54:00] so they miss a change their identity and
[1:54:08] because they are caught in the midst of
[1:54:11] that confusion and lost identity so they
[1:54:16] always try to take sighs or to fall on
[1:54:20] the side that is victim they use all of
[1:54:25] these things to change the appetite I
[1:54:28] met a young man I could tell from his
[1:54:31] name I knew where he came from and and I
[1:54:34] in a gas station so I buy a bomb I think
[1:54:38] I got right down that to him and I and I
[1:54:41] you know I spoke my broken French you
[1:54:45] know and and the only reason why I did
[1:54:49] it because I could tell about his name I
[1:54:52] know he didn't want to speak to me you
[1:54:56] know and he's you know he's speaking
[1:54:58] English it's almost like he's throwing
[1:55:00] me in a way because I can see you know
[1:55:02] the way he might cut his head or
[1:55:03] everything that he was carrying on
[1:55:04] himself I walk out of the place and I
[1:55:11] say oh my god oh my god
[1:55:19] this try appetite has changed you don't
[1:55:28] want to do anything with Heidi you don't
[1:55:30] want to do anything with that language
[1:55:31] don't pull me back I could miss me I
[1:55:41] said Wow
[1:55:43] and I mean he just he just caught me off
[1:55:46] and I can steer tell from his eyes and
[1:55:48] that you see he's not been around too
[1:55:50] long but he's feeding on the music he's
[1:55:56] feeling on the girls he's feeling on all
[1:55:58] the worldliness and everything down that
[1:56:00] he want to take on identity
[1:56:12] what is the attraction on your mountain
[1:56:15] I try to find a place to close here
[1:56:20] maybe we will continue with this praise
[1:56:23] the Lord
[1:56:24] so I can keep you in this convention you
[1:56:29] know convention is good when you have
[1:56:31] something to feed the people after
[1:56:32] preaching long amen
[1:56:35] and I mean we used to have it was not
[1:56:39] really the convention but it was good
[1:56:42] being called his house I mean I would
[1:56:44] just leave it like that oh praise the
[1:56:50] Lord
[1:56:51] he me when God fulfilled his word it
[1:56:56] always causes an attraction always does
[1:56:58] it was an attraction for Aries they're
[1:57:04] unusual so unusual when He fulfilled his
[1:57:07] word to the Mahdi train of the day it
[1:57:10] causes the modern train of the date he
[1:57:13] says cause the model train of the day
[1:57:14] don't believe in it they have their own
[1:57:18] way on the day of Pentecost the people
[1:57:28] says what is this what is this we every
[1:57:33] man hearing these people in our own
[1:57:35] language what is this what was God doing
[1:57:39] fulfilling Joe a prophecy God was
[1:57:43] fulfilling his word what the church has
[1:57:48] done they had got stuck to speaking in
[1:57:51] tongues
[1:57:52] and he had left the word that God
[1:57:54] fulfill why because they took the
[1:58:00] experience because the people were
[1:58:02] speaking in tongues so they taught there
[1:58:04] as an evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:12] praise the Lord suburban MC a Hebrew
[1:58:20] chapter 3 series he said so Paul had an
[1:58:26] experience how many believe experience
[1:58:29] comes by conversion sure if it hasn't I
[1:58:34] would doubt the conversion the
[1:58:38] conversion big begins experience and you
[1:58:45] can lot it to anything now sometimes it
[1:58:49] might be shouting sometimes it might be
[1:58:53] speaking with tongues sometimes it might
[1:58:55] be weeping sometimes it might be
[1:58:58] groaning you don't know what it is so
[1:59:04] you don't try to lock it because every
[1:59:09] one of you has proved to be wrong in it
[1:59:14] now what better bad I'm talking about
[1:59:17] here is when people take their
[1:59:20] experience to make a doctrine out of
[1:59:23] faith they take their experience to make
[1:59:25] it a standard for other people because
[1:59:29] God give his children he deals with them
[1:59:33] in a different way he appeared to mirror
[1:59:37] madellaine at the grave he appeared to
[1:59:39] those two men on the role of a Myers
[1:59:41] Peter he came through the wall traumas
[1:59:44] how to touch his hands and Paul said in
[1:59:53] a book of Corinthians that there was
[1:59:55] there were fifty I think 50 he said or
[1:59:57] five hundred that Jesus appeared home
[2:00:00] before he extended so there were
[2:00:05] different ways that he showed himself to
[2:00:09] all his disciples give them a little
[2:00:13] mountain top but I am saying I have seen
[2:00:18] people shout just as hard as they could
[2:00:20] shout and and and and steal the gold out
[2:00:24] of your teeth
[2:00:26] oh my goodness praise the Lord
[2:00:34] oh yeah
[2:00:42] those things happen praise the Lord
[2:00:52] those things happen
[2:00:57] recently the brothers and sisters
[2:01:03] working on the sound brought to my
[2:01:05] attention a young man that was that was
[2:01:08] commenting on our Facebook page you know
[2:01:12] the Lord is just so good you know I
[2:01:16] thought about it I just we just spoke on
[2:01:19] Abigail
[2:01:20] and understanding hard and the Ministry
[2:01:23] of intercession so I really had to pray
[2:01:27] when I heard that because I was just
[2:01:30] saying myself Oh God
[2:01:32] help me Lord you know help me don't
[2:01:35] don't make this to turn into something
[2:01:37] different and it did not surprise me
[2:01:44] though I because I told I told the
[2:01:46] sister that call me and I said I said if
[2:01:48] it is the person I'm thinking about I
[2:01:50] will not worried about it this was a
[2:01:53] young man that you know those were some
[2:01:58] of my early converts in in the faith and
[2:02:00] this young brother lived with me and
[2:02:03] slept with me on the same bed broke into
[2:02:07] my my notebooks and stole some brothers
[2:02:11] contact rug brother Donald Regan to send
[2:02:13] him some money when I travel before I
[2:02:16] came back he told all the other brothers
[2:02:19] look we just suffering here for nothing
[2:02:22] but one has a lot of contact we're not
[2:02:24] supposed to be suffering these people
[2:02:26] can help us if we asked him you know so
[2:02:29] he went writing people I mean they are
[2:02:34] just some awful things he said and and
[2:02:37] and some of those things I mean in some
[2:02:40] way he's referring to himself because I
[2:02:44] refuse to to do his wedding on a fact
[2:02:48] that I wanted a consent from the young
[2:02:50] woman parent before I were married him
[2:02:52] and it ran ran out and and you know and
[2:02:55] and started living together and all of
[2:02:57] these things and you know but just like
[2:03:03] brother branham saying I've seen people
[2:03:05] shout so high as as they could shout
[2:03:08] there was one thing that was good
[2:03:11] there was one thing that was good this
[2:03:14] young brother was so smart very clever
[2:03:16] boy and I mean he would catch me by the
[2:03:20] phrase when I'm preaching he would catch
[2:03:23] me by every phrase and evening he comes
[2:03:25] over to the house and says he says
[2:03:28] Brother Wang you were saying peace you
[2:03:30] said this in the sentence you know I
[2:03:32] mean just as my boy and what the good
[2:03:34] thing he did for me is that he had me to
[2:03:37] go back to the box because I knew that I
[2:03:40] could not just say it because I think
[2:03:42] about it I have to say it because it's
[2:03:44] in the world and and and I appreciate
[2:03:51] that you know I appreciate that I
[2:03:53] appreciate when people when people come
[2:03:56] you know and think that they are
[2:03:57] bringing things and you are able to see
[2:04:00] the good side of it and then couple of
[2:04:04] years you travel over to Australia I
[2:04:07] mean he was he was actually net-net when
[2:04:14] I said lady right don't like to go into
[2:04:16] some of those things but because those
[2:04:18] comment was made in and some of the
[2:04:20] believers in church read it I thought I
[2:04:23] would take a time to talk about it a
[2:04:24] little bit and then he went over to
[2:04:26] Australia and there one time even I was
[2:04:31] talking to brother Valentin recently and
[2:04:33] we were just laughing about some of
[2:04:35] those things because there was a
[2:04:36] displayed in Abidjan one time we were on
[2:04:38] a convention and he kind of for
[2:04:41] displayed in a way that I mean we joke
[2:04:43] about it but he went over to Australia
[2:04:46] and then went into a church there
[2:04:49] because he felt like you know he felt
[2:04:52] like he had a calling you know he felt
[2:04:55] he had a calling he was an evangelist
[2:04:56] you know that was what he said and he
[2:05:01] went there and and you know after being
[2:05:05] around with the church field people
[2:05:06] don't know him he will always try to
[2:05:09] fight his way to the poopit and I mean a
[2:05:14] man a pastor should have confidence in a
[2:05:17] man before he gave me a puppy Alice and
[2:05:22] sometimes I mean sometimes we
[2:05:26] you know carried away by you know things
[2:05:31] people say but he asked to to to give a
[2:05:35] testimony in all the special and then I
[2:05:38] mean he held the people bound to ours
[2:05:41] took the poop took the microphone and he
[2:05:44] said he would preach you know he just
[2:05:46] went on and on and on and on and there
[2:05:48] was just a big scene there
[2:05:50] I think the pastor had to call the
[2:05:51] police and you know and all sorts of a
[2:05:54] great thing took place
[2:05:56] you know but what I'm seeing here is the
[2:05:59] other my heart is heavy when I see those
[2:06:05] things because he says young man that I
[2:06:08] really love you know I took him as my
[2:06:11] son and what hurt my heart what makes my
[2:06:15] heart heavy is that the sister he got
[2:06:19] married to til tomorrow when the mother
[2:06:23] sees me she cry on me you know because
[2:06:27] she can talk to her daughter I mean it's
[2:06:29] just it just an ugly scene stealing and
[2:06:32] also so things took place in honor that
[2:06:34] thing you know so when those things were
[2:06:37] brought to my mind I just I just said
[2:06:41] lord I can just I can show you guys
[2:06:44] because I like to keep those things I
[2:06:46] can show you emails I think there was
[2:06:48] one time I got an email from Betty
[2:06:50] Michonne that went to brother abisco and
[2:06:55] was from the scene young man you know
[2:06:57] and I mean there was some horrible
[2:06:59] things she was saying to brother be
[2:07:00] airing or death so but you know people
[2:07:06] young people or people in general take
[2:07:09] on the wrong spirit praise the Lord
[2:07:13] I mean they take on the wrong spirit and
[2:07:16] sometimes they put them in very bad
[2:07:19] condition very bad condition you know
[2:07:23] very very bad condition and I mean they
[2:07:27] only I mean he can work because he's on
[2:07:29] a surveillance with the Australian
[2:07:31] government and in all of that I mean he
[2:07:35] has to live off of his children welfare
[2:07:37] because
[2:07:39] I mean all the children he had I mean I
[2:07:41] mean all sorts of things but it all
[2:07:44] comes back to what we are just reading
[2:07:46] here from brother branham I don't know
[2:07:48] how we got this thing in here shout a
[2:07:51] shout and steal the gold teeth and but
[2:07:55] it bring us to that place you see that's
[2:07:58] the reason why you can you can hold to
[2:08:02] to to the elements you got a look at
[2:08:06] what is happening you got to see what
[2:08:08] God is doing you can say well you know I
[2:08:13] pray for the sake and and in and and
[2:08:16] they got here I have a healing ministry
[2:08:20] it's a promise to all the believers did
[2:08:23] I believe she will lay their hands on
[2:08:24] the sake so if you take the other thing
[2:08:27] and run with it now if you pray and the
[2:08:32] sick does not get well you either accuse
[2:08:35] that person that I have unconfessed sin
[2:08:37] and it is not confess they are seen you
[2:08:40] make it a pressing problem because you
[2:08:42] are running with an element leaving the
[2:08:44] world behind the word is the attraction
[2:08:48] it's not the man it's not the man is not
[2:08:57] the speaking in tongues it's not the
[2:08:58] thinking special it's not anything is
[2:09:01] the word the word is the attraction the
[2:09:07] word must be the attraction on your
[2:09:09] Mountain whether it is trial that you
[2:09:13] are going through Lord what is the
[2:09:16] attraction what are you fulfilling what
[2:09:18] are you doing in my life that is the
[2:09:20] attraction because if you don't focus on
[2:09:22] the world you would take and misbehavior
[2:09:24] and against God and you will miss the
[2:09:27] blessing because the word is the
[2:09:31] attraction that is on the mountain
[2:09:34] praise the Lord yeah a church with no
[2:09:39] cheers also don't have a clock so I
[2:09:40] don't know the time praise the Lord
[2:09:45] yeah let me let me close here we will we
[2:09:47] would do our own base we do our own base
[2:09:50] there's a place I want to
[2:09:53] I want to bring us to as we look at
[2:09:55] these things because the gathering of
[2:10:00] the people will be on to him not to a
[2:10:04] man praise the Lord the word is the
[2:10:09] attraction on our Mountain praise the
[2:10:15] Lord
[2:10:17] that's why even if it is a young time
[2:10:19] and it just telling you their experience
[2:10:22] don't don't get - it away see what has
[2:10:28] been fulfilled see what they are saying
[2:10:32] see what is coming from that young heart
[2:10:35] don't play God in your life and think
[2:10:40] because you know about all of your flaws
[2:10:42] so God can never do anything and you
[2:10:44] just shut them off oh I want to see what
[2:10:54] is the attraction on this mountain

[2:11:02] Avenue you what is the attraction on
[2:11:04] this mountain let the world be our
[2:11:07] attraction when I come in because of the
[2:11:12] music are coming because of the people
[2:11:14] let the world be our attraction when the
[2:11:17] word is our attraction then God can move
[2:11:20] because the people I expecting God to
[2:11:23] move they are looking for the world so
[2:11:26] the world would take different form and
[2:11:28] move among the people when the word is
[2:11:31] our attraction now the gray paint or the
[2:11:42] white windows or the new space let the
[2:11:49] word be our attraction because you see

[2:12:00] you be looking for the word seeing what
[2:12:04] the word is doing in a young people
[2:12:06] seeing what the word is doing in
[2:12:07] appearance seeing what the word is doing
