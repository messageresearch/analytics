[36:57] the same was in the beginning with God
[37:00] all things were made by him and without
[37:04] him was not anything made that was made
[37:08] in him was life and the life was the

[38:30] seat praise the
[38:32] Lord amen we've been we've been speaking
[38:36] on uh uh the subject of in the beginning
[38:40] uh uh we've been going in between
[38:43] Genesis chapter 1 St John chapter 1 and
[38:47] first John and uh we just been traveling
[38:51] uh all between uh uh those chapters this
[38:54] morning we want to we want to talk talk
[38:56] on in the beginning was the word just
[39:00] like sorry just like John said in the
[39:03] beginning was the word we want to uh
[39:06] gave ourself a title this morning and
[39:09] said in the beginning was the
[39:13] word and uh
[39:17] uh
[39:25] uh
[39:32] okay now so as we as we look at the
[39:35] subject this morning and uh I wish that
[39:39] uh uh I was I was I could do a good
[39:43] teaching this morning instead of doing
[39:44] the preaching the the weather is just
[39:46] good for for for a good Bible teaching
[39:50] but we will try to do the best that we
[39:52] can this morning to be able to bring the
[39:54] word of God to you and uh
[40:00] uh talking about this subject of in the
[40:03] beginning and uh uh we've been we've
[40:06] been looking at it like I said uh from
[40:09] from from different place but this
[40:11] morning I want to look at it a little
[40:14] bit from the from the from the place of
[40:18] uh uh of information
[40:22] science and uh uh I hope the the the the
[40:28] young people can help us back
[40:31] there
[40:36] um praise the
[40:39] Lord if our our young technicians can
[40:44] look back there I just send you an
[40:48] image that has uh information
[40:51] measurement if you go back to your mail
[40:54] you will see it and if you see it and
[40:56] you can project it up for
[40:58] us
[41:01] uh that would be beautiful we want to
[41:04] start from there now the reason there is
[41:07] that uh we are we are we are in such an
[41:10] age the the the generation the age is is
[41:13] all to this place of uh of uh uh uh of
[41:18] information
[41:19] science we are in this age of uh uh uh
[41:24] you know technology and uh especially
[41:27] with the AI uh uh this artificial
[41:30] intelligence and uh uh and just to
[41:33] realize that the age the generation is
[41:37] dealing with this you will realize that
[41:40] uh as we will look into the subject this
[41:43] morning it is not strange that uh uh
[41:47] John will start his writing like I said
[41:50] from what he saw on the island of pmos
[41:54] that he was said in the beginning what
[41:56] was the
[41:57] word praise the Lord amen in the
[42:00] beginning was the word Microsoft gave us
[42:03] uh you know uh uh an engine that we can
[42:07] use to write you know and give us
[42:09] construction they call the word and uh
[42:12] uh and all of that I'm not I'm not a
[42:14] tech guide but uh uh I'm using my
[42:17] ignorance to to to speak on some of
[42:20] these things
[42:22] but
[42:25] uh uh
[42:27] uh as as uh as the technicians are
[42:30] working on that
[42:33] so you will see here that uh uh Genesis
[42:38] chapter 1 says in the beginning God
[42:41] created the Heaven and the Earth that
[42:44] was what we we read we we went into that
[42:46] direction last week Sunday but for some
[42:50] reason uh I got off of my my subject and
[42:54] then uh I started going uh in a way that
[42:57] I was inspired to go but you will
[43:00] realize what we were trying to bring to
[43:02] you is that uh uh you will see that
[43:08] there was a difference between verse one
[43:10] and verse two because verse one make us
[43:13] to know that God created the Heaven and
[43:16] the Earth and then verse two come and
[43:20] let us know that the Earth was without
[43:22] form and there was just darkness all
[43:25] over the Deep
[43:26] and uh so we show from the word Hebrew
[43:29] the Bible say all God works were
[43:31] finished from the foundation of the word
[43:34] and uh so the picture there in Genesis
[43:37] chap 1 verse one is that it shows the
[43:41] picture of the
[43:42] intelligence that's what I want to bring
[43:44] to you this morning the intelligence
[43:47] that was behind
[43:50] creation and that is the thing that
[43:54] defeat the the two the of
[43:58] evolution praise the Lord the thing that
[44:01] defeat the theory of evolution and all
[44:03] the theory of science the big bang and
[44:06] all of that is that you cannot have
[44:09] design without
[44:13] intelligence there cannot be designed
[44:16] you cannot have
[44:18] order without
[44:22] intelligence praise the Lord amen amen
[44:26] if you were not smart this morning you
[44:28] will not be dressing cute as you
[44:35] are but you did well though you did well
[44:38] your tie is not hanging in the back your
[44:41] tide is hanging right before you you
[44:43] might not be mashing but I mean you're
[44:46] not you're not butting your shirt at the
[44:48] back your shirt is butting in front of
[44:51] you and intelligence make you to do that
[44:54] you are not even wearing left and right
[44:56] shoes you could find the right foot to
[44:58] put your foot in and intelligence make
[45:00] you to do that you can never have order
[45:04] without
[45:08] intelligence praise the Lord so Genesis
[45:11] chapter 1 verse
[45:15] one is all about the intelligence that
[45:19] was behind the
[45:22] creation are we together
[45:27] amen
[45:30] amen are we together why why are we
[45:33] waiting now for our our our young
[45:36] technicians to to
[45:39] gather uh the information and share with
[45:42] us so that's that's what I want us to
[45:45] see and
[45:47] now uh uh John here in in in in St John
[45:53] he's pointing to that beginning
[45:57] he's pointing to Genesis chapter
[46:01] 1 and he says in the beginning was the
[46:06] word now we know that a word is a
[46:11] thought
[46:16] Express praise the Lord are you are you
[46:18] getting the picture the a word is a
[46:21] thought
[46:23] Express so uh uh there there are there
[46:26] are two words in the in the Greek that
[46:29] is used for word and that's that's what
[46:32] we want to dwell on this morning uh uh
[46:35] I'm I'm I'm a little bit getting ahead
[46:37] of myself beautiful beautiful I knew I
[46:40] knew that those those smart uh
[46:43] technicians back there will get it amen
[46:45] amen praise the Lord those young people
[46:48] they are they are very smart now so uh
[46:51] uh in the in the in the information
[46:53] science in the information word this is
[46:56] uh the way information is
[47:01] measured and uh uh you have uh the
[47:05] information here and uh contrary to the
[47:08] information they call the
[47:10] entropy and uh uh so in the way the the
[47:17] the the the measure information is in
[47:20] the sense that
[47:23] uh uh okay okay yeah
[47:26] it's in the sense that they says uh uh
[47:31] uh for you to get the right information
[47:33] let me say it this way let me let me
[47:35] bring it down to my own simple
[47:38] mind uh uh uh for us to get the right
[47:42] kind of information we have to have
[47:45] things in order let me say it that way
[47:48] and entropy that contrary to uh uh
[47:50] information it will be this
[47:53] order praise the Lord
[47:56] now uh uh you have you have you have
[48:00] signal that uh that that that signal you
[48:04] you know uh your your your filter go off
[48:07] on your your refrigerator it makes a
[48:10] sound and uh uh uh it makes a sound to
[48:14] Signal you that the filter is off you
[48:16] need to change it it keeps beeping uh
[48:19] your your fire alarm keeps beeping to
[48:22] make make you to know that there is
[48:23] smoke in the house it makes thinger
[48:26] praise the Lord but then when you get
[48:29] noise you really don't know what it is
[48:33] noise create
[48:35] confusion praise the Lord noise you are
[48:39] having uh more than one two three signs
[48:42] coming from every word it create
[48:44] confusion praise the Lord there there's
[48:46] there's some smart guys in this place
[48:48] that can break this thing down and make
[48:50] you to understand it better than I do
[48:52] amen but just bear with me praise the
[48:55] Lord
[48:56] the same thing with music and the same
[48:59] thing with uh uh uh uh Cosmos now you
[49:05] you hear Brother brandom use this word
[49:07] most of the time uh uh talking about the
[49:11] the word that was created the cosmos
[49:14] amen the cosmos now if you look in
[49:19] Genesis you will realize the Earth was
[49:22] without form and darkness was on the
[49:26] Deep what was that
[49:29] chaos praise the Lord when God brought
[49:33] an order to the word then it became a
[49:36] cosmos the word took shape the sun can
[49:40] come up at the time the moon can come up
[49:43] at the time the night and the day it
[49:45] took there was an order praise the
[49:49] Lord I have a I have a friend that
[49:51] always uh use this word actually this is
[49:55] this is is word the word cosmetic is
[49:57] taken
[49:59] from Cosmos praise the Lord amen so the
[50:04] sense behind it is that cosmetic is to
[50:06] bring order to our
[50:11] this
[50:13] praise praise the Lord is to bring order
[50:16] to our
[50:19] disorder and then uh you have
[50:23] design and then uh you have
[50:27] Randomness now
[50:33] so that is that is the
[50:35] measurement in the in in in the
[50:38] information word that's that's the way
[50:39] they look at it that's the way they look
[50:42] at it is it's a smart guy that built
[50:43] this thing I'm not the one that built it
[50:46] uh uh I I I took it from uh from just
[50:50] just looking at uh what he was
[50:52] presenting now so uh uh uh so when we
[50:57] get back over to Genesis chapter 1 I I
[51:01] really want you to grab that picture in
[51:03] your mind in the beginning God created
[51:06] the Heaven and the Earth that's the
[51:10] first verse in the
[51:12] Bible God created the Heaven and the
[51:17] Earth and then verse two give us this
[51:22] picture of of of a disorder of a chaos
[51:26] Darkness was upon the Deep the water
[51:28] covered the face of the earth and the
[51:30] spirit of God moving upon the Water but
[51:33] then pretty soon we will see that God
[51:36] will bring an order he will separate the
[51:39] water from the land praise the Lord give
[51:42] the water his boundage this is how far
[51:44] you can come and then from the land he
[51:47] will brings out uh uh uh seeds and
[51:50] fruits and trees and and and and and
[51:53] animals and and and then he he he
[51:55] brought such an
[51:57] order that it became the Earth that was
[52:01] in in in in a place of chaos now became
[52:06] an
[52:08] Eden it became a
[52:13] paradise praise the Lord so this is what
[52:18] H H uh uh information science tells
[52:22] us there is always a drift from year to
[52:29] year as we stay in this life there will
[52:33] always be a drift from year to year
[52:36] praise the Lord amen
[52:43] amen example good good good example we
[52:47] have uh uh some of our sisters that
[52:49] dedicate time to come and clean the
[52:51] clean the church uh before we get here
[52:54] then uh they come on the weekend or
[52:56] sometimes during the week whatever time
[52:57] that work for them but uh you will
[53:00] realize that uh I mean uh uh uh uh they
[53:04] have to come they have to make a
[53:05] schedule to come why because every time
[53:08] it's
[53:09] clean uh uh before the next service they
[53:12] need to clean it because why it's dirty
[53:15] so we always have this
[53:17] drift praise the Lord amen
[53:20] amen arrange your closet put everything
[53:23] in order
[53:25] give yourself a week or two yeah there
[53:28] you go this
[53:31] order there is always a drift is we
[53:35] always leaning to that praise the
[53:38] Lord we're always leaning to that that's
[53:41] the reason why we have to put switch
[53:43] your phone off back there uh because I
[53:46] mean you are not intending to call
[53:48] anybody but if you leave your phone on
[53:50] is going to make noise and pretty soon
[53:52] everybody will be distracted why because
[53:54] we are always always
[53:56] drifted to that are you getting the
[53:59] picture I'm using this as a bit I want
[54:02] to I want to get a hold of you so don't
[54:04] think that I'm I'm smart I'm just using
[54:06] it as a bait so I can be able to get a
[54:08] hold of you and uh uh design that's
[54:14] that's one of the biggest thing that we
[54:16] want to dwell on year and uh and the
[54:19] reason why is that there is no design
[54:24] without an
[54:27] intelligence praise the Lord that's the
[54:29] reason why every every every close you
[54:33] word there is a TI on
[54:36] it and the t is to show you the
[54:39] intelligence is to show you the
[54:41] signature of the
[54:45] designer praise the Lord is to show you
[54:49] the signature of the
[54:54] designer even this our body has a tag on
[54:57] it if you look for it you will find it
[54:59] you find the signature of the designer
[55:01] in your
[55:02] soul praise the
[55:06] Lord now if if we if we
[55:11] despise design if we in know
[55:16] Design This is what the big the big bang
[55:19] the brings to us that the word from an
[55:24] exp
[55:26] explosion praise the Lord there was an
[55:30] explosion
[55:33] Randomness everything just happened it
[55:36] just
[55:39] happened and what you believe it or not
[55:42] is a spirit that is that is on the
[55:47] generation on this age it's a spirit
[55:50] that is on our Edge is it's something
[55:53] that is haunting every one of us
[55:56] us
[55:58] word people expect things to just
[56:02] happen
[56:05] amen they don't they don't believe in
[56:07] faith there is nothing like Faith but
[56:09] thingss can happen by Randomness things
[56:12] can just happen so if you if you if you
[56:15] go by
[56:16] Randomness you will also find Lock
[56:22] chance amen amen people want to be
[56:25] locked you know chains and all of those
[56:27] things we want we want those things to
[56:30] happen there's a place I'm getting to by
[56:33] bringing this to
[56:34] you in the beginning what the
[56:41] word in the beginning was the word and a
[56:46] word is a thought
[56:49] Express praise the Lord amen that's the
[56:52] reason why when you don't think before
[56:54] you speak you sound
[56:57] foolish even to yourself a word is a
[57:00] thought
[57:04] Express so keep that in your mind thank
[57:07] you thank you let's let's take this down
[57:10] let's move on a little
[57:12] bit praise the
[57:17] Lord I think uh uh like I said I was
[57:21] using that as a bit I think i' I've got
[57:23] I got a little bit of your attention
[57:25] let's let's look at uh uh uh that code
[57:29] on the SE shall not be heard let's let's
[57:32] take that as as a beginning year this is
[57:36] a late service so I'm not supposed to
[57:38] hold you
[57:42] late but I'm I'm praying that I can be
[57:44] able to say something that will be a
[57:48] blessing to you something that will also
[57:52] resonate with you see is not here with
[57:55] the shock like in the beginning God God
[57:57] dwelt alone because he was the innal
[58:02] one wasn't even God he wasn't even God
[58:05] because God is an object of
[58:08] worship and the logos pay attention to
[58:11] this and the logos as we call it the
[58:16] word that went out of God like I said
[58:21] it's one of the words in the in the
[58:23] Greek that is used use for word when a
[58:27] word is
[58:29] spoken it's
[58:31] logos there is another word that is used
[58:36] in the Greek when the word is spoken is
[58:39] called
[58:43] Rema that is uh r h e m a
[58:47] Rema and lust is just as it is
[58:52] spelled there
[58:55] l o g o s now the difference between
[58:59] Rema and
[59:01] logus is reman is any word that is
[59:06] spoken a word that is spoken it's a
[59:11] reman
[59:12] logus is a
[59:14] word that is spoken with the thought
[59:17] behind
[59:21] it it was it was very strange that uh I
[59:24] checked through uh uh as I was studying
[59:27] last night I search All Through uh the
[59:29] best that I C I never found brother
[59:31] Brandon using the word
[59:34] Rema he never used the word Rema and the
[59:38] reason it hits me
[59:40] because Rema is uh is I I I will give
[59:44] you an example a very good example of
[59:48] Rema and I just I just added to my note
[59:50] while I was in the office this morning
[59:52] even though I was looking at it last
[59:54] night but a very good type of reman is
[59:58] Matthew chapter
[1:00:00] 4 okay Satan came tempting the Lord
[1:00:04] Jesus and told Jesus that it is
[1:00:08] written he was cutting what is written
[1:00:12] he's saying to Jesus what is in the
[1:00:15] psalm he's quoting from the psalm that
[1:00:18] it is written the Lord will give his
[1:00:22] angels praise the Lord
[1:00:25] and Jesus said to him it is also
[1:00:29] written so when Jesus said it is also
[1:00:32] written Jesus was using the
[1:00:36] logos when Satan said it is written he
[1:00:40] was just reading what is
[1:00:42] written but there is no good intention
[1:00:45] behind
[1:00:46] it when God said in Jeremiah I know the
[1:00:51] thoughts I know my thoughts towards you
[1:00:55] which mean every word that I have spoken
[1:00:57] to you I have a positive intention
[1:01:00] behind
[1:01:03] it are you seeing the
[1:01:06] difference it is not just speaking a
[1:01:10] word what is the T behind it what is the
[1:01:16] motive what is the
[1:01:22] intention are we together
[1:01:25] in the beginning was the
[1:01:31] word in the beginning was the word we'll
[1:01:34] do it a little bit here I mean we will
[1:01:36] we will pick up uh uh a little bit here
[1:01:38] on on the reman and uh and the logos but
[1:01:43] let's go ahead here with this
[1:01:45] reading and the logos as we call it the
[1:01:49] word that went out of God anyone knows
[1:01:54] there
[1:01:55] that was the angel of the Lord now
[1:01:58] that's what I'm I want you to pay
[1:01:59] attention to because there is a
[1:02:01] connection here there is a connection
[1:02:05] and uh uh I I will I will we will talk
[1:02:09] about it but just pay attention the
[1:02:10] logos as we call it the word that went
[1:02:14] out from God he says John said in the
[1:02:17] beginning was the
[1:02:19] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:02:25] Word was God praise the Lord amen it's
[1:02:29] easy to see a trinity it's not a
[1:02:31] trinity there is nothing about Trinity
[1:02:34] there it's all about
[1:02:38] expression it's all about expression
[1:02:42] Hebrews chapter 1 let's read Hebrews
[1:02:44] chapter 1
[1:02:49] quickly there is nothing about three
[1:02:52] person no it's not three person is one
[1:02:55] person expressing
[1:03:01] himself are we
[1:03:05] together Hebrews chapter
[1:03:08] 1 Hebrew chapter 1 verse
[1:03:13] 1 God who has Su times and inav
[1:03:18] manner speak in time pass unto the
[1:03:21] fathers by the prophet have in these
[1:03:24] last days spoken unto us by his son now
[1:03:29] that word his son if you look at
[1:03:32] it you will what will come to your mind
[1:03:35] is Jesus of
[1:03:40] Nazareth that's what would come to your
[1:03:42] mind when you think about his son what
[1:03:45] would come to your mind is Jesus of
[1:03:47] Nazareth but don't make that conclusion
[1:03:49] yet until we finish reading let's go
[1:03:52] ahead again have in this last day spoken
[1:03:55] unto us by his son whom he have
[1:03:59] appointed Hees of All Things by whom
[1:04:02] also he made the word so what what what
[1:04:06] Paul is saying here he's trying to say
[1:04:09] that the son that God is now speaking
[1:04:12] unto us by is the same one by whom he
[1:04:15] made the he created the word so that was
[1:04:17] not Jesus of Nazareth that was the
[1:04:23] lust are we
[1:04:26] together praise the Lord let's go ahead
[1:04:29] a little bit it will explain
[1:04:33] itself whom also he made the
[1:04:38] words who being the brightness of his
[1:04:42] glory this is what I wanted to give
[1:04:44] their Express
[1:04:46] image their Express image when God was
[1:04:52] expressing himself from from thought to
[1:04:55] being when he was expressing himself
[1:04:58] from being invisible to visible that is
[1:05:03] what is called a son you are a son of
[1:05:06] God because you are expected to be an
[1:05:08] expressed image of God people must see
[1:05:11] you and says he's a child of God she's
[1:05:13] the daughter of God praise the Lord you
[1:05:17] must have some sense of
[1:05:20] expression that's that's that's where
[1:05:22] the word Christian derived from they saw
[1:05:24] their lives and they said these were
[1:05:26] Christians they look like Christ they
[1:05:28] live like Christ they talk like Christ
[1:05:31] it's an expression it's not a title
[1:05:35] Christianity is not a title it's an
[1:05:39] expression praise the Lord amen you must
[1:05:41] not tell people you are Christian they
[1:05:43] must say you are Christian they should
[1:05:45] call you Christian now you carrying
[1:05:48] yourself as a title on your back I'm a
[1:05:51] Christian no they should look at your
[1:05:53] life and said she has an expression he
[1:05:57] has an
[1:05:58] expression that is
[1:06:01] different the express image that is what
[1:06:05] is called the
[1:06:06] son praise the Lord am
[1:06:15] hallelujah praise the Lord are we
[1:06:19] together do you see the picture amen
[1:06:24] so let's go back to our qut now so you
[1:06:26] can be you can be able to follow
[1:06:29] follow the expression God expressing
[1:06:32] himself and the logos as we call it the
[1:06:35] word that went out of God anyone know
[1:06:39] that that was the angel of the Lord now
[1:06:43] he says it was the lust and he say it
[1:06:46] was the angel of the Lord let's go on
[1:06:49] again all the word the word of the Lord
[1:06:52] so he's saying the angel of the Lord or
[1:06:55] the word of the
[1:06:58] Lord praise the Lord
[1:07:02] amen that follow Israel through the
[1:07:04] Wilderness the angel of the Covenant the
[1:07:08] lust that went out of
[1:07:11] God and then that logos was made flesh
[1:07:16] ured Among Us that was when it took on
[1:07:20] the name Jesus Christ when it took on
[1:07:25] flesh and dwell Among Us that's when it
[1:07:28] took on the name Jesus Christ but it was
[1:07:32] traveling right from the
[1:07:34] beginning when it came out of God it
[1:07:36] took that first form as a light an amber
[1:07:40] color light the logos is the same as the
[1:07:44] angel of the Covenant it was the amber
[1:07:47] color light that came in a burning bush
[1:07:49] and just blessed it became a burning
[1:07:51] bush to Moses praise is the Lord it was
[1:07:55] the Amber cut of light in the night it
[1:07:57] Shine over Israel as a pillow of fire in
[1:08:00] the day it was covered by the cloud it
[1:08:03] became the the the the pillar of cloud
[1:08:06] it's not it's not different thing it's
[1:08:08] that same logos from the beginning
[1:08:11] praise the Lord are we
[1:08:14] together it's the same lust that took
[1:08:17] the form of a constellation of stars
[1:08:19] that led the wise
[1:08:22] men
[1:08:24] are we
[1:08:27] together what is the
[1:08:29] logus let me say in another way so so we
[1:08:33] can be able to understand it whenever
[1:08:37] the thought of God taketh
[1:08:42] form praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:08:45] why you will hear that statement the
[1:08:47] pillow of fire became a
[1:08:51] man amen amen the pillar of fire that
[1:08:54] led the children of Israel in the
[1:08:56] wilderness one day met Joshua as the
[1:08:59] captain of the Lord
[1:09:02] hor because the Bible says when they
[1:09:04] enter into the into the promised land
[1:09:07] the pillar of fire ceased to show by
[1:09:09] night but one day Joshua met this
[1:09:14] man and he says who are you identify
[1:09:17] yourself are you for us or are you
[1:09:19] against
[1:09:22] us and the angel said I'm the captain of
[1:09:25] the Lord Joshua knew definitely that
[1:09:29] that was the pillow of
[1:09:31] fire he did the very same thing that
[1:09:33] Moses did he took off his shoes he bowed
[1:09:36] his hair down and he
[1:09:38] washed so whenever the word takes a form
[1:09:43] whether it takes a form of a man or the
[1:09:46] form of a woman that is God's
[1:09:52] expression
[1:09:56] are we
[1:09:57] together that's the reason why we don't
[1:09:59] need to break God into three to believe
[1:10:02] him he don't have to be a
[1:10:05] trinity he came down as as the Holy
[1:10:08] Ghost on the day of Pentecost he broke
[1:10:11] himself into
[1:10:13] many
[1:10:16] 120 after 3,000 belief he broke himself
[1:10:20] up God can break himself up and he can
[1:10:23] gather himself again that's what make
[1:10:25] him
[1:10:30] Almighty we don't have to set him here a
[1:10:32] father set him here a son this same
[1:10:35] Catholic Church gives to us it has just
[1:10:37] blown and ruined our spirit that may can
[1:10:40] never get H H close to God we always
[1:10:43] want to go through
[1:10:49] somebody when God is expressing himself
[1:10:53] he's expressing himself trying to bring
[1:10:55] himself so close to us no we want to go
[1:10:59] through somebody we always feed ourself
[1:11:02] on water to get into his presence I
[1:11:05] rather go through the pastor I go
[1:11:06] through the church or I go through this
[1:11:08] belief or go through that
[1:11:12] belief it's the expression of God when
[1:11:15] God Express himself praise the
[1:11:19] Lord because he had a thought when he
[1:11:23] left internity to begin time he had a
[1:11:26] thought he had a plan and it was the
[1:11:29] Plan of Redemption what was the Plan of
[1:11:31] Redemption to express his attributes
[1:11:34] they will come as lost Sinners and he
[1:11:36] will find a way to bring them back to
[1:11:39] him that's why Jesus says all the father
[1:11:42] has given me will come praise the lord
[1:11:46] we don't have to beg you to be a child
[1:11:48] of God we don't have to pay you to be a
[1:11:50] child of
[1:11:52] God if the see of God in you you will
[1:11:54] come if God have to drag you and bring
[1:11:57] you by a sick bed he will bring you
[1:11:59] whichever way you come we will say
[1:12:01] receive you you are one of ours we will
[1:12:03] love you but it better you come nice
[1:12:06] just just come the way you are
[1:12:08] now praise the
[1:12:12] Lord are we
[1:12:14] together are you seeing the picture I'm
[1:12:17] sure that my bed will have work now I
[1:12:19] got you I can preach amen prise the Lord
[1:12:25] so the
[1:12:29] lust the word that followed the children
[1:12:31] of Israel in the wilderness the angel of
[1:12:33] the Covenant the lust that went out of
[1:12:36] God and then that lust that logos that
[1:12:40] went out of God one
[1:12:43] day to all the prophets he was coming in
[1:12:47] portion but one day that
[1:12:50] word took on flesh
[1:12:54] praise the Lord amen that word took on
[1:12:59] flesh are we
[1:13:05] together that word took on
[1:13:10] flesh let's go let's let's continue to
[1:13:12] read now we are in St John 1 that's
[1:13:16] where we are in the beginning was the
[1:13:18] word the word was with God the Word was
[1:13:21] God and now
[1:13:25] as he gave his life for us then his
[1:13:29] Spirit come back upon us Jesus said at
[1:13:33] that day you will know that I'm in the
[1:13:36] Father the father in me I in you and you
[1:13:40] in me see is God all
[1:13:44] alone is God all
[1:13:47] alone it's God all alone it have to be
[1:13:50] God for you to believe this word word it
[1:13:54] have to be God for you to conform to
[1:13:57] this word let me tell you you are not
[1:13:59] the believer God is the believer in
[1:14:04] you that's the reason why we must be
[1:14:06] dead in Christ dead in our life hid in
[1:14:15] Christ is God all
[1:14:18] alone it's being God that's been
[1:14:21] watching you from the dead you were
[1:14:22] separated from your mother's womb it was
[1:14:25] God that saved you from the terrible
[1:14:27] whatever thing you are that that could
[1:14:29] have cost your life it has been God all
[1:14:34] alone just trying to express himself to
[1:14:38] you see me see
[1:14:39] me I'm the one but we don't see it we
[1:14:44] see this person we see that person we
[1:14:46] see this money we see that thing and and
[1:14:49] I mean because uh uh uh our our our
[1:14:52] human brain our sight in the back of our
[1:14:57] brain I I don't know what it call it
[1:14:59] there the doctors will explain it to you
[1:15:01] but uh uh uh it's it's built to be able
[1:15:05] to capture an image either in a form of
[1:15:09] a shape or by
[1:15:13] colors praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:15:16] why when you when you are explaining the
[1:15:19] supernatural to people if they cannot
[1:15:22] push a shape or a color if they can if
[1:15:26] they can put it together in a design
[1:15:28] work it can make sense to their brain
[1:15:31] they can believe it
[1:15:33] right but the supernatural don't make
[1:15:36] sense to the brain the supernatural
[1:15:37] makes sense to the
[1:15:43] soul praise the
[1:15:46] Lord if then God all theone God
[1:15:49] manifesting himself walking himself
[1:15:52] through different ages so that three
[1:15:55] Father Son and the Holy Ghost seem God
[1:15:58] working in three attributes that's
[1:16:03] all that's all you're never going to get
[1:16:05] to heaven and see a throne for the
[1:16:07] father and see the son sitting there and
[1:16:09] the Holy Ghost sitting
[1:16:12] there that's one of the teaching from
[1:16:15] from from from the church that that has
[1:16:18] put this separation because because we
[1:16:22] we can never be able to find our sunship
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:26] God our sunship to God has always been
[1:16:30] tied to something because we are member
[1:16:32] of the church so we are Son of God the
[1:16:33] day we leave the church we are no longer
[1:16:35] Son of God why it's it's it's it's it's
[1:16:38] Trinity doctrine that have created that
[1:16:46] Gap praise the Lord but it have just
[1:16:49] been God expressing himself or
[1:16:52] alone while we were yet sinners he
[1:16:56] expressed himself on the cross of
[1:16:58] Calvary praise the
[1:17:00] Lord
[1:17:04] amen is God expressing
[1:17:11] himself and we today are one the church
[1:17:14] itself an attribute of God thinking
[1:17:17] before the foundation of the word to
[1:17:20] have a church so those which are in
[1:17:23] Christ was in Christ at the
[1:17:26] beginning that was his thought and his
[1:17:31] thought is his attribute so when John
[1:17:34] said in the beginning was the
[1:17:37] word praise the Lord the word was with
[1:17:42] God which mean Elohim was dwelling with
[1:17:45] his
[1:17:46] thoughts amen Elohim was dwelling with
[1:17:50] his attributes in him it's not a father
[1:17:53] son holy ghost story in the beginning
[1:17:55] was the word the word is a thought
[1:17:59] Express the word was with God Elohim was
[1:18:03] dwelling with his
[1:18:06] thoughts are you seeing the picture and
[1:18:09] he's going to express he's going to
[1:18:12] express it so the very same thing here
[1:18:15] we show you in that information
[1:18:17] measurement and and leaving from order
[1:18:20] to disorder when God dwell
[1:18:23] as as a self-existent God when he was
[1:18:26] alone there was no
[1:18:30] chaos praise the Lord amen there was no
[1:18:33] chaos he was by himself he was the
[1:18:36] Fountain of all
[1:18:39] Perfection praise the Lord The Fountain
[1:18:42] Of
[1:18:44] Truth glory be to God but now he choose
[1:18:48] to to express himself what was in his
[1:18:52] mind
[1:18:54] to bring it to to
[1:19:00] manifestation are we together praise the
[1:19:03] Lord I don't know about you but I'm
[1:19:05] enjoying
[1:19:07] this I'm enjoying it not because I'm
[1:19:09] preaching it I'm enjoying it because
[1:19:11] it's be it's it's it's beginning to to
[1:19:14] bring out the some shap more clearer to
[1:19:19] me praise the
[1:19:21] Lord is beginning to bring out the
[1:19:24] sunship more clearer to
[1:19:26] me
[1:19:28] Hallelujah in the beginning was the word
[1:19:31] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:19:33] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:19:38] God are we
[1:19:42] together let's read a little bit here
[1:19:44] we'll take something on the church
[1:19:49] ages be to get through that and and let
[1:19:52] you go home
[1:19:54] home once again thank you I appreciate
[1:19:56] each and every one of you for coming
[1:19:58] praise the Lord
[1:20:02] amen let's take this the evidence of
[1:20:05] receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
[1:20:07] the same as uh as it was back in the
[1:20:10] days of our
[1:20:13] Lord it is receiving the word of Truth
[1:20:17] for the day in which you
[1:20:21] live praise the Lord
[1:20:23] Jesus never distressed the importance of
[1:20:27] Works signs and wonders as he did the
[1:20:32] word he knew that if the people got the
[1:20:35] word The Works will
[1:20:39] follow amen he says the word that I
[1:20:43] speak unto you they are life and they
[1:20:45] are
[1:20:47] Spirit he said if you if you doubt what
[1:20:49] I say SE the
[1:20:51] scripture go go back to the word his
[1:20:54] emphasis was the word go back to the
[1:20:58] word SE the
[1:21:01] scripture because he knew that if you
[1:21:04] get the word that that that will reveal
[1:21:08] to you your original identification you
[1:21:11] won't run after SS and wonder you won't
[1:21:14] run after all of this because it's the
[1:21:16] word that produces
[1:21:20] it but s say that we have we have a
[1:21:24] generation we have an age where a church
[1:21:26] will run its whole program on Miracles
[1:21:29] and signs and prosperity and then no
[1:21:32] word
[1:21:35] right no word let's read down a little
[1:21:40] bit now Jesus knew that there was going
[1:21:44] to be a terrible Drift from the word in
[1:21:47] the pagamos age which was as yet
[1:21:53] 2,000 years of uh the pathal vision he
[1:21:56] knew that DFT who caused him to go into
[1:22:00] the Dark Age the pamis church age was
[1:22:02] the Dark Age uh we will we will show you
[1:22:04] a picture here just now he knew that the
[1:22:08] way man originally got away from God was
[1:22:12] first to was first by leaving the word
[1:22:18] praise the Lord amen yeah when other
[1:22:23] things start occupying our
[1:22:25] mind and we start putting emphasis on
[1:22:29] other things more than the
[1:22:31] word you will see it no one have to tell
[1:22:35] you you will see it your prayer life
[1:22:38] will be
[1:22:39] gone the interest in the word the
[1:22:42] respect to the word of God will be
[1:22:45] gone the way that man leave God has
[1:22:48] always been leaving the word right and a
[1:22:53] way to come back to God is always coming
[1:22:56] back to the
[1:23:02] word praise the
[1:23:07] Lord there's no way I can I can I can
[1:23:10] overemphasize that than then it has been
[1:23:12] said but let's go ahead a little bit
[1:23:14] here he knew that the way man originally
[1:23:18] got away from
[1:23:20] God was by first leing the word Genesis
[1:23:23] 3 tells us there they left the word if
[1:23:26] you leave that word you have left God
[1:23:31] praise the Lord you can be in the church
[1:23:34] you have left God
[1:23:45] right if you leave the word you have
[1:23:47] left God thus he is presenting himself
[1:23:51] to the to to to to the church at P
[1:23:54] Gamers and indeed to all the churches of
[1:23:57] all ages I am the
[1:24:00] word if you want deity in your
[1:24:05] midst praise the Lord if you want deity
[1:24:09] in your midst what is deity the fullness
[1:24:12] of God if you want to experience the
[1:24:15] fullness of God not just a partial God
[1:24:19] by making church playing music and then
[1:24:21] we come and just give you some lecture
[1:24:23] make you laugh but if you want to
[1:24:25] experience the fullness of God Amen the
[1:24:28] fullness of God in healing the fullness
[1:24:31] of God in transformation the fullness of
[1:24:34] God in overcoming praise the Lord the
[1:24:37] fullness of God in
[1:24:43] Deliverance if you want deed in your
[1:24:46] mess then welcome and receive the
[1:24:50] word because in the beginning was the
[1:24:54] word if you want deed in your M welcome
[1:24:57] and receive the
[1:24:59] word praise the
[1:25:02] Lord open your heart and open your mind
[1:25:05] to the word it can change you why
[1:25:08] because it's the word that form
[1:25:11] you amen it's the word that form
[1:25:15] you I don't I don't know how how men
[1:25:19] think that they can enjoy this word that
[1:25:21] is made
[1:25:22] when they reject the word that has made
[1:25:25] the
[1:25:26] word okay the word of God created the
[1:25:29] universe and then we are going to just
[1:25:32] put away the word of
[1:25:34] God and then we will enjoy the
[1:25:38] universe praise the
[1:25:43] Lord if you want de in your mid then
[1:25:46] welcome and receive the word don't ever
[1:25:49] let
[1:25:50] anyone don't let don't ever let anyone
[1:25:53] not even me praise the Lord don't ever
[1:25:58] let anyone or anything get between you
[1:26:01] and the
[1:26:03] word this which I'm
[1:26:06] going to give you the word is the
[1:26:09] revelation of myself that's Jesus
[1:26:11] speaking to the church now is the
[1:26:13] revelation of myself I am the
[1:26:17] word remember
[1:26:19] that in the beginning was the word word
[1:26:23] are we together in the beginning was the
[1:26:27] word the intelligence of
[1:26:33] God praise the
[1:26:35] Lord he said let every seed bring forth
[1:26:40] of its
[1:26:43] kind he designed it in such a
[1:26:47] way that every seed is going to bring
[1:26:51] for of his kind
[1:26:56] men try to hybrid and mix it together
[1:26:59] and and and and and you know and and
[1:27:01] produce lemon and Apple at the same
[1:27:05] time are we
[1:27:08] together but such an intelligence that
[1:27:11] is impossible for you to put a mango
[1:27:14] seed to the ground and get an
[1:27:16] Apple the intelligence behind it said
[1:27:19] every seed must bring forth of his
[1:27:23] kind you can't beat that
[1:27:28] intelligence you can beat it the
[1:27:31] intelligence
[1:27:38] said let the water separated from the
[1:27:42] land and when that intelligence drew the
[1:27:45] water back it gave the water the
[1:27:47] boundary say stands right here that's
[1:27:50] your limit you you can come and visit
[1:27:53] and go
[1:27:55] back praise the Lord you can come and
[1:27:58] visit ride away and visit but you must
[1:28:01] go back I give you your
[1:28:05] limit the intelligence of
[1:28:10] God praise the
[1:28:15] Lord that's the reason why David said
[1:28:19] the heavens
[1:28:21] declared the glory of God when I look at
[1:28:24] the heavens the
[1:28:27] design the design that is in the heavens
[1:28:30] tell me there is an intelligence that
[1:28:32] put it
[1:28:34] together it did not hang there by
[1:28:38] itself praise the
[1:28:40] Lord amen now you think about it now
[1:28:44] think about it y say we are in an age I
[1:28:46] know I'm getting out of time but uh let
[1:28:48] me let me just get to this year because
[1:28:50] it's part of my thoughts notes Here y
[1:28:53] say we in a time where
[1:28:55] science is is is is hitting us it's like
[1:28:58] it's like they are they they they are
[1:29:01] overrunning us they're running over us
[1:29:04] with this new technology of of
[1:29:07] AI this new h h h h uh uh artificial
[1:29:12] intelligence is just it's it's
[1:29:15] overtaking praise the
[1:29:17] Lord amen whe whether whether you
[1:29:20] believe it or not it's overtaking people
[1:29:23] it's the time that we are living in it's
[1:29:25] the it's the direction where the word is
[1:29:28] going AI is telling you that uh the they
[1:29:33] have a they have a place where they are
[1:29:35] going to bring millions of babies in the
[1:29:41] word they're going to bring millions of
[1:29:43] babies in the word for the long time uh
[1:29:47] uh the the the science and health
[1:29:49] industry has been you know as as much as
[1:29:52] they have been donating blood they have
[1:29:53] been donating H H hog gem cells sperm
[1:29:56] cells and all of that a is telling you
[1:29:59] that we have create artificial wom and
[1:30:02] we're going to bring millions of babies
[1:30:03] in the
[1:30:10] world praise the Lord
[1:30:19] amen have you ever got on your phone I I
[1:30:22] know you have done it but let me ask the
[1:30:23] question maybe I'm the only dumb person
[1:30:26] have you ever got on your phone and you
[1:30:27] are talking to this customer service
[1:30:31] person praise the
[1:30:34] Lord and uh my name is BL one I don't

[1:31:41] you sound funny to
[1:31:46] you praise the
[1:31:50] Lord
[1:31:52] but think about it we in such a Time
[1:31:55] word science is is pouring this thing
[1:31:58] out us I mean they don't they don't they
[1:32:00] don't need man they will tell you says
[1:32:02] no man fot is touching the
[1:32:05] ground before let there be problem in
[1:32:08] the world like the way there is problem
[1:32:10] in Israel now America are finished
[1:32:11] sending troops of soldier now they don't
[1:32:13] need anybody to
[1:32:16] go they don't need anybody to go they
[1:32:19] having robots men that are standing on
[1:32:22] God they can stay right there give a
[1:32:24] command send this thing straight to that
[1:32:26] place they're going to send the mea
[1:32:28] there they don't need men on the ground
[1:32:37] anymore are we
[1:32:43] together what you believ it or
[1:32:46] that whether you are interested in it or
[1:32:49] that is the world that you are living in
[1:32:53] praise the
[1:32:55] Lord it is the intelligence that sends
[1:32:57] the door when you get there the door
[1:32:59] open you don't have to touch the door
[1:33:00] anymore to open
[1:33:02] it it's a sensor that sensor and
[1:33:05] intelligence has been placed in that
[1:33:08] sensor to be able to sense your
[1:33:12] presence that's the word that we are
[1:33:14] living
[1:33:18] in and we see all of these things Siri
[1:33:22] where is the closest restaurant the
[1:33:25] closest gas station Siri rout your phone
[1:33:28] yeah my own is rewriting right here
[1:33:29] sorry Siri I'm not talking to
[1:33:34] you I was supposed to have say something
[1:33:36] El and it's rerouting and and pretty
[1:33:39] soon it tells you right there oh it's in
[1:33:42] 2.3 M oh it's right around the corner
[1:33:45] right and we enjoy it we get so
[1:33:47] fascinated with
[1:33:50] that praise the
[1:33:53] Lord but you see the thing there is that
[1:33:56] the thing about it is that those
[1:34:01] gadgets they don't have a brain of their
[1:34:06] own they have
[1:34:09] used the intelligence of a fallen Son of
[1:34:15] God they are they have used the
[1:34:17] intelligence of a fallen child of God a
[1:34:22] man whose mind has been so gravitated to
[1:34:27] invention praise the Lord it don't have
[1:34:30] a brain of its
[1:34:32] own it only do what the intelligence has
[1:34:36] failed it to
[1:34:41] do praise the
[1:34:43] Lord amen
[1:34:48] amen the intelligence the intelligence
[1:34:52] do not feel the the
[1:34:54] Meer amen and say when you go down there
[1:34:57] on the target if if if it is just
[1:35:00] children don't
[1:35:02] bomb right watch watch and see if there
[1:35:06] is children or innocent
[1:35:11] people
[1:35:13] no the intelligence only told the mea
[1:35:17] what what intelligence will placed in it
[1:35:19] be accurate on the target right
[1:35:23] right if they would have if they would
[1:35:25] have been smart to say go there and
[1:35:28] watch take a sensor and watch if there
[1:35:31] are women and children turn around don't
[1:35:32] blast that that means that will do
[1:35:38] that but they did not give it they give
[1:35:41] it only limited knowledge him at the
[1:35:44] Target and do your
[1:35:48] work so when it gets there whether they
[1:35:51] innocent people are not going to
[1:35:54] explode
[1:35:57] why because that's what it was fair to
[1:36:07] do are we
[1:36:20] together
[1:36:26] I hope that gave you a
[1:36:28] picture
[1:36:30] amen I hope that give you a picture it's
[1:36:32] almost like uh uh yeah let me let me not
[1:36:36] go down that R let me let me just stay
[1:36:38] right here praise the
[1:36:42] Lord let me just stay right
[1:36:50] here
[1:36:53] and that's the word that we are living
[1:36:55] in but yet when Jesus said ask the
[1:37:00] father anything in my
[1:37:03] name ask the father anything in my
[1:37:07] name and believe that you have received
[1:37:11] it it LO so hard for us but it's very
[1:37:16] easy to take up your phone and say
[1:37:20] Google
[1:37:22] it's easy
[1:37:24] right it's easy one little Chinese boy
[1:37:28] or whoever I mean they are not the only
[1:37:31] smartest
[1:37:32] people have just you know faced that
[1:37:37] Gadget and it looks like I can just go
[1:37:40] on my phone and and order whatever I
[1:37:43] want but the creator of Heaven in Earth
[1:37:45] say
[1:37:47] ask ask
[1:37:50] me
[1:37:52] praise the
[1:37:55] Lord do you think it's possible to talk
[1:37:58] to God the same way you talk to your
[1:38:00] phones it's
[1:38:03] possible it's
[1:38:06] possible the reason that is that we have
[1:38:09] come to to to to to to to
[1:38:13] Believe In Our
[1:38:16] gget Praise the Lord man we so believe
[1:38:19] in it that when we go with our a is like
[1:38:22] we don't have life where's my phone oh
[1:38:24] my God I can't I can't believe that I
[1:38:27] left my phone it's almost like everybody
[1:38:29] in the world has died from you they just
[1:38:32] send you a news that the bomb has
[1:38:34] blasted your whole generation just
[1:38:37] because you don't have a cell
[1:38:38] phone we go so
[1:38:41] sick we have become so gravitated to it
[1:38:45] it's every day part of our life that's
[1:38:47] the first thing we pick up to look at
[1:38:48] the look at the time nothing wrong with
[1:38:51] the that I do that every morning my
[1:38:53] phone have bunch of different uh alarms
[1:38:56] that go off of different things I want
[1:38:57] to do so when it rings I take it up to
[1:38:59] see which one maybe I slept through the
[1:39:01] other one there's nothing wrong but I'm
[1:39:04] just trying to say the way we are so
[1:39:08] gravitated that's the reason
[1:39:11] why we believe
[1:39:13] that if you ask Google Google will give
[1:39:16] it to you
[1:39:18] right praise the Lord but we can be also
[1:39:21] so gravitated to the
[1:39:24] word that's where he's drawing us
[1:39:27] to he's drawing us to that
[1:39:31] place that I don't have to wait for the
[1:39:34] church service I can be right in my home
[1:39:36] right in the kitchen uh uh uh wherever I
[1:39:39] am I can be right there and say
[1:39:42] father I need your grace I need a help
[1:39:46] from you I need strength from you I can
[1:39:50] be right there and say Lord I have mess
[1:39:53] a big time have mercy upon me
[1:39:59] right praise the
[1:40:01] Lord the Bible says he ever so night if
[1:40:04] we can confess with our mouth that Jesus
[1:40:06] is Christ and believe in our heart
[1:40:10] that's why Paul says in the Book of
[1:40:12] Romans so what are we talking about here
[1:40:15] let's let's let's find a place in close
[1:40:17] so so I will not bore you out but let me
[1:40:20] read this
[1:40:22] again if you want deed in your
[1:40:25] mess then welcome and receive the word
[1:40:29] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[1:40:33] between you and th
[1:40:35] word this which I G this which I'm
[1:40:39] giving you the word is a revelation of
[1:40:44] myself I am the word remember
[1:40:47] that now this statement comes I spoke on
[1:40:51] this before I
[1:40:53] wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:40:57] impressed with the word in our
[1:41:02] midst the word we have we spoke a little
[1:41:05] bit of that on Wednesday night the word
[1:41:07] we call the
[1:41:09] message are we
[1:41:13] impressed are we sufficiently
[1:41:16] impressed of this
[1:41:18] word that we have in our midst
[1:41:23] praise the
[1:41:24] Lord are you impressed of the word that
[1:41:27] you have believed when you say I believe
[1:41:30] in God I believe in Jesus Christ are you
[1:41:33] impressed can you look at your
[1:41:37] life and say thank
[1:41:40] God thank God that I made that
[1:41:45] choice or are you still looking at your
[1:41:47] life and you are wondering what what
[1:41:49] what are you doing what are you living a
[1:41:51] double
[1:41:53] life you are claiming one thing but you
[1:41:55] are not fully involved in it you are not
[1:41:58] giving yourself to
[1:42:01] it are we sufficiently
[1:42:08] impressed can you say if if there's
[1:42:10] another life to live if I die and there
[1:42:13] is no Heaven I should come back on Earth
[1:42:15] I want to live this life of a Christian
[1:42:17] again can you say that to
[1:42:19] yourself
[1:42:23] praise the Lord
[1:42:25] amen or you wish that you come back and
[1:42:28] come back as a Hollywood
[1:42:35] star I we sufficiently impressed with
[1:42:39] the word in our
[1:42:41] midst I will leave that and then uh I'll
[1:42:45] share this with you and then we
[1:42:47] close last week Sunday we we share the
[1:42:51] the image of
[1:42:55] Nebuchadnezzar if uh if our
[1:42:58] our young tech people can put that up
[1:43:01] again for us the image of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:43:04] we share that with you
[1:43:10] beautiful
[1:43:12] beautiful this was representing the
[1:43:14] Gentile Kingdom there are there are some
[1:43:16] things that I'm gathering together uh uh
[1:43:20] uh on this share with you if you if you
[1:43:22] are paying attention uh uh we we've been
[1:43:25] playing uh the beginning and the ending
[1:43:29] of the Gentile dispensation that's why
[1:43:31] we are playing for Sunday school so if
[1:43:33] you want to find a time and and play it
[1:43:36] you know by yourself and steud through
[1:43:38] it but that is the tip that we playing
[1:43:40] for Sunday school and uh uh uh we have
[1:43:44] cancer that this morning because of the
[1:43:46] weather now so uh uh we we we we spoke
[1:43:51] about this last week and and and and
[1:43:54] what we pointed out here is that uh the
[1:43:59] image grew harder as it left gold saver
[1:44:04] brass iron it grew
[1:44:07] harder okay it went from a softer uh uh
[1:44:12] element to one that is harder than it
[1:44:15] and Brass is more harder and then iron
[1:44:17] is more harder from brass and thing we
[1:44:21] pick up on the image last week uh was
[1:44:24] that uh there was a stone that was
[1:44:28] caught out of the mountain that came and
[1:44:31] smashed the image image here yeah on his
[1:44:34] feet and the image fell in Daniel vision
[1:44:38] and then when the image
[1:44:41] fell there was a huge mountain That
[1:44:45] Grew right from here
[1:44:47] up now so the image came from up down
[1:44:52] and The Rock HD it on the
[1:44:54] feet now when when God gave Daniel this
[1:44:58] Vision if you see here the head of gold
[1:45:01] represent Babylon and uh the breast is
[1:45:05] is the m and Persian and Greek these are
[1:45:08] all Gentile kiddom so God gave Daniel a
[1:45:14] vision concerning the Gentiles now you
[1:45:17] have to realize that God been dealing
[1:45:20] with the Jews since he called Abraham he
[1:45:22] was the first Hebrew and God de with
[1:45:25] them all alone but y said he's giving
[1:45:28] Daniel that is the reason why the dream
[1:45:30] troubled Daniel he he couldn't even
[1:45:33] remember the dream h no sorry the dream
[1:45:36] troubled Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
[1:45:38] was the one that had a dream it's it's
[1:45:40] written right here how couldn't I see
[1:45:43] that Nebuchadnezzar was the one that had
[1:45:46] the dream and it it troubled him and
[1:45:48] Daniel was the one that interpreted said
[1:45:50] the dream get it right brother one you
[1:45:52] should get it right Don't Preach
[1:45:54] something different to the
[1:45:56] people now so uh uh but the the the
[1:46:01] dream year was
[1:46:03] representing the Gentile
[1:46:06] Kingdom where we are right here we are
[1:46:09] right in this
[1:46:11] place this is where we
[1:46:14] are okay we are in this place of uh of
[1:46:18] of of Papa room that turned over to
[1:46:20] Pagan room and and all of that we find
[1:46:23] time to explain that to you but what I
[1:46:25] wanted want us to see is that this was
[1:46:29] speaking about the Gentile Kingdom now
[1:46:33] you have to remember that Jesus told us
[1:46:37] that uh uh uh he talks about the time of
[1:46:41] the
[1:46:41] Gentiles he talks about the dispensation
[1:46:44] of the
[1:46:46] Gentiles are we together amen that's
[1:46:50] what I want I want you to remember there
[1:46:52] so this was speaking about the political
[1:46:56] Powers ACC calling to according to uh uh
[1:47:00] uh biblical prophecy when you really
[1:47:03] want to talk about superpower these are
[1:47:05] the Nations that you mention according
[1:47:08] to the scripture according to the to the
[1:47:10] scripture America is not a superpower
[1:47:13] she just a
[1:47:14] puet in the hands of
[1:47:18] Rome praise Lord according to prophecy
[1:47:22] these are the superpowers of the word
[1:47:25] that have gone on and on and we write
[1:47:27] down here okay but when the The Rock
[1:47:33] Crut this image at the
[1:47:36] feet the Bible says there was another
[1:47:40] Mountain that grew up it grew
[1:47:44] up so this was smashed down and the
[1:47:48] mountain started coming up and started
[1:47:50] coming up and started coming up and it
[1:47:52] became a huge
[1:47:54] mountain praise the
[1:47:56] Lord so we will use another image
[1:47:59] here and that image is uh uh an image
[1:48:04] that is tied to the the the the church
[1:48:08] ages and uh and and uh and the virtues
[1:48:11] over in in the book of Peter the seven
[1:48:14] the the stature of a perfect man so I I
[1:48:17] I took that I ask I asked us to look at
[1:48:20] it okay now so uh a beautiful picture
[1:48:24] here of of the stature of a perfect man
[1:48:27] now the reason why I brought this is
[1:48:29] because the mountain That Grew From
[1:48:32] Where the image was
[1:48:34] crushed it speaks of the
[1:48:38] spiritual Kingdom of the
[1:48:41] Gentiles the natural kingdom was
[1:48:45] smashed by a rock caught out of the
[1:48:48] mountain and in the scripture a rock is
[1:48:51] what
[1:48:53] Christ
[1:48:56] amen so he hid the the the the the the
[1:49:00] the image at the feet the natural
[1:49:02] Kingdom the natural Powers over the
[1:49:06] Gentile to break it down because he has
[1:49:09] promised to get a people out of the
[1:49:12] Gentile for his name
[1:49:14] sake so after that image fell God
[1:49:18] started building a spiritual Kingdom
[1:49:21] through the seven Church
[1:49:23] ages in the Book of
[1:49:26] Revelation are we together so it started
[1:49:29] from the Ephesus Church age and you know
[1:49:32] up to the seventh Church age so it grew
[1:49:35] as a mountain it went from one age to
[1:49:39] another are we together are you seeing
[1:49:42] the picture
[1:49:49] amen I almost said is uh anybody have a
[1:49:52] question I almost said that but I know
[1:49:55] if I said that we would not leave from
[1:49:56] here
[1:49:57] today so if you have a question just
[1:50:00] write it down amen write it down and
[1:50:02] then we will be able to address I almost
[1:50:04] said
[1:50:05] it but if I I have said it then we would
[1:50:08] not uh we would not leave from here so
[1:50:12] yes yes the seven Church age ages here
[1:50:15] that's that's the Gentile spiritual
[1:50:17] Kingdom now there's a reason why I could
[1:50:18] explain all of this to you we'll get
[1:50:20] back to it let's let's not run very fast
[1:50:23] I just wanted to show you the mountain
[1:50:26] That Grew so you see the image came from
[1:50:28] up down but God started building this
[1:50:32] mountain from Faith up to brotherly
[1:50:35] kindness and and uh love so uh uh that's
[1:50:39] the picture but this is the reason why I
[1:50:41] brought this picture let's let's let's
[1:50:43] let's take the picture from there and
[1:50:45] then uh if my young people back there
[1:50:47] would give me the quote on Christ is
[1:50:50] revealed in his own word we will read
[1:50:52] that and then we close are we together
[1:50:56] amen are we
[1:51:00] together let's let's read that Christ
[1:51:03] has revealed in his own word and then we
[1:51:06] will close listen to this see down
[1:51:10] Through the
[1:51:11] Ages we started off from the foundation
[1:51:16] from the first church Edge that was the
[1:51:18] picture that I show you the first church
[1:51:21] age the Ephesus Church
[1:51:24] age that was when Paul went out and he
[1:51:27] and he told the the the the the the
[1:51:30] Jewish councel he say seeing then you
[1:51:33] have refused the law we turn unto the
[1:51:36] Gentiles that was when he and barabra
[1:51:39] started their first uh missionary
[1:51:41] meeting out of out of that the Church of
[1:51:43] epo was
[1:51:46] born so the spiritual kingom started
[1:51:49] building right from there from the first
[1:51:52] church
[1:51:53] age when the seed went to the ground the
[1:51:58] complete seed which seed was that Christ
[1:52:01] the complete
[1:52:03] seed it was Christ the lust in body
[1:52:07] Christ he went to the
[1:52:09] ground he he he resurrected after three
[1:52:13] days and that seed unto us is The
[1:52:17] Incorruptible seed which is the word of
[1:52:19] God
[1:52:22] are we together
[1:52:25] amen when the sea went to the ground
[1:52:28] their complet SE then then it uh uh it
[1:52:33] come out through the
[1:52:37] feet now it was the feet that was hit so
[1:52:41] definitely it has to start from the
[1:52:45] feet are we
[1:52:48] together amen
[1:52:53] amen it it started from the feet Luther
[1:52:57] comes out through Wesley then to
[1:53:01] Pentecost the
[1:53:04] tongue in the L now brother called that
[1:53:07] because it was in the Pentecostal age
[1:53:09] where the gifts were were returning back
[1:53:11] to the church and it started speaking to
[1:53:13] tongues I mean started speaking in Tong
[1:53:15] speaking to tongues speaking in tongues
[1:53:17] now so you you you see that H H uh right
[1:53:21] there that uh uh uh uh he's he's kind of
[1:53:25] for building the spiritual image he's
[1:53:27] giving us a picture he's creating an
[1:53:30] image for us to look onto that when the
[1:53:34] natural Kingdom when the political
[1:53:36] powers of the Gentile was crushed by the
[1:53:40] revelation of Jesus Christ then God
[1:53:43] started building a spiritual Kingdom
[1:53:45] revealing himself to the Gentiles the
[1:53:48] Gentile received the same holy ghost
[1:53:50] that the Jews received on the days of
[1:53:52] Pentecost I can show you in the
[1:53:54] scripture you know what Peter said Peter
[1:53:57] said I wish that we receive it the way
[1:53:59] the Gentile receive
[1:54:01] it because the Gentile receive it by
[1:54:04] just the preaching of the word why Peter
[1:54:07] preached this word the Holy Ghost fed
[1:54:09] upon
[1:54:13] them praise the
[1:54:16] Lord God was building a spiritual
[1:54:19] Kingdom so brother Bram yet is giving us
[1:54:21] a picture because he's bringing us to a
[1:54:23] place and let's get to there quickly and
[1:54:26] I let you
[1:54:28] go then
[1:54:31] in the Pentecost the tong in the L SE
[1:54:35] now now it's in the eyes
[1:54:39] prophetic now so what is he doing he
[1:54:42] bringing us down from the
[1:54:45] legs and he bring us here to our mouth
[1:54:48] the Pentecostal speaking in
[1:54:50] tongues the next intelligence after the
[1:54:53] mouth is the
[1:54:54] eye which of course he called the
[1:54:58] prophetic
[1:54:59] age the eye is the seal the image is
[1:55:04] building but where I want to bring you
