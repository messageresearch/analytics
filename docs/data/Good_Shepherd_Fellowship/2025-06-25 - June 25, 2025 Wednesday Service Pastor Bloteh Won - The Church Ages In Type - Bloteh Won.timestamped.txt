[36:11] that's a beautiful thing. Amen.
[36:13] Sometimes we get carried away and you
[36:15] know we just uh allow the person up
[36:17] there and then our mind wander all over
[36:20] the place. But if we can unite our faith
[36:22] and just jump in and cry on God, you
[36:26] know, it it kind of it raises faith. It
[36:28] changed the atmosphere and and I believe
[36:31] that uh uh the Lord is going to move on
[36:34] our behalf. Praise the Lord. Amen. Uh um
[36:38] uh Ruth chapter 4. Let's look in the
[36:42] book of Ruth chapter 4. I was I was
[36:44] looking at uh uh
[36:51] was looking at something in the word
[36:53] that uh I thought if I have uh
[36:58] uh this opportunity I would like to
[37:01] share with you something that I've
[37:03] looked at uh some time ago dealing with
[37:07] uh the two wives of Jacob and uh that's
[37:11] Leah and uh richer. Praise the Lord.
[37:17] Luke chapter 4.
[37:20] Well, I just I just want to look at uh
[37:24] the church in prophecy. I want to look
[37:26] at the church ages in prophecy. And uh
[37:30] uh it's is from this statement brother
[37:32] Brandon made that uh uh uh we will read
[37:36] it right there. He says he can be able
[37:38] to show us the seven church ages right
[37:41] from Genesis, you know. So, uh, we just
[37:44] want to look at a little bit of that
[37:46] tonight in in type. But there's there's
[37:50] this there there's a little thing that
[37:51] came out there that really drew me to
[37:53] that. So, u uh,
[37:59] let's read from verse 8. Luke chapter 4
[38:01] from verse 8. Therefore, the king's man
[38:04] said unto Boaz, "Buy it for thee." So,
[38:08] he drew off his shoes. He took off his
[38:11] shoes and Boaz was supposed to step in
[38:14] it as a sign of redemption. Amen. Amen.
[38:19] So that we can take out our shoes
[38:20] tonight. The Lord will step in it. Amen.
[38:23] He's our kinsman redeemer. If you know
[38:25] you can't do it, just take your shoes
[38:28] off. Say, Lord, I can do it. I want you
[38:31] to step in. Praise the Lord. He has one
[38:35] size that fit all.
[38:37] Amen. He can fit your shoes no matter
[38:40] what size you wear tonight. Praise the
[38:43] Lord. Amen. And he know your size, too.
[38:47] Yes.
[38:49] And boy said unto the other elders, and
[38:52] unto all the people, ye are witnesses
[38:56] this day that I have bought all that was
[39:00] Amalecch, and all that was Chillon and
[39:03] Malon, of the hand of of Naomi.
[39:07] Moreover, Ruth the Moabitete, the wife
[39:11] of Melon, have I purchased to be my
[39:14] wife, to raise up the name of the dead
[39:20] upon his inheritance,
[39:23] that the name of the dead be not cut off
[39:26] from among his brethrens,
[39:30] and from uh the gate of his place. Ye
[39:34] are witnesses this day.
[39:38] And all the people that were in the gate
[39:41] and the others said, we are witnesses.
[39:46] The Lord make the woman that is come
[39:51] into thine house like richer and like
[39:56] Leah. Praise the Lord. Amen. So this
[39:59] gentile woman was going to take a type
[40:02] like Richard and like Leah.
[40:08] Are we together?
[40:10] Amen.
[40:17] The Lord make the woman that is come
[40:20] into thine house like Richard and like
[40:22] Leah, which too did build the house of
[40:26] Israel,
[40:28] and uh do thou worth it in Ephertile,
[40:31] and be famous in Bethlehem, and let the
[40:35] house be like the house of Feras, whom
[40:39] Tema bear to Judah, of the seed which
[40:43] the Lord Lord shall give thee of this
[40:46] woman. Amen. The Lord bless you. Have
[40:49] your seat. We continue to read.
[40:58] So Boaz took Ruth and uh and she was his
[41:03] wife and and he and he went in unto her
[41:07] and the Lord gave her conception
[41:11] and she be a son. And the women said
[41:15] unto Naim, "Blessed be the Lord, which
[41:19] have not left thee this day without a
[41:22] king's man,
[41:26] that his name may be famous in Israel,
[41:30] and he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[41:34] thy life." The king's men shall be unto
[41:37] thee a restorer of thy life. Amen.
[41:43] and a nourisher of thine old age. For
[41:47] thy daughter-in-law
[41:49] which loveth thee, which is better to
[41:53] thee, than seven sons have borne him.
[41:57] Amen. The daughter-in-law Ruth better
[42:01] than seven sons. So there's a bride that
[42:03] comes out of the church ages that is
[42:06] better than seven sons. Amen. So uh uh
[42:10] we just I just want to just share some
[42:13] few things with you tonight and uh just
[42:16] to kind of uh encourage you. Praise the
[42:19] Lord. Amen.
[42:21] We love the Lord tonight. Amen. We thank
[42:24] the Lord for uh giving us this
[42:27] opportunity. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[42:33] I realize I still said that when I said
[42:35] I didn't wanted to say it, but you have
[42:38] to remember I ask you to pray for me.
[42:40] Amen.
[42:42] I ask you to pray for me. So, uh what
[42:44] what we want to look at tonight by the
[42:46] grace of God uh uh is uh
[42:53] uh the story of Jacob
[42:56] uh uh
[42:59] Rachel and Leah, but but really uh uh
[43:03] Jacob because uh
[43:06] uh
[43:09] now like like brother Brandham said uh
[43:12] in uh Christ is the mystery of God
[43:14] revealed. He said, you see those Old
[43:16] Testament characters, you know, they
[43:18] were living their lives. They were
[43:20] living their normal life. But uh in in
[43:24] their life, God was also writing
[43:28] history. He was writing prophecy. He was
[43:31] writing uh uh he even played placed some
[43:35] mysteries in their life. Even though
[43:38] they were living, they were living their
[43:40] normal life. Praise the Lord. Amen. And
[43:44] uh uh uh but but God was hiding things
[43:48] in their life. Now, so when you look at
[43:50] the story of of Jacob here, we will read
[43:54] a little bit. We see that uh uh uh uh
[43:58] Rebecca, his mom uh encouraged him to go
[44:02] over to her brother place and uh you
[44:04] know get away because uh Esau was angry
[44:08] because of the birthright and all of
[44:10] that. We know the story. So, Jacob went
[44:13] down to uh uh his uncle place Laben and
[44:18] then he got there uh uh we will be in
[44:21] Genesis chapter 29.
[44:24] And uh and the Bible says uh uh will let
[44:27] us know that it was Richard that met uh
[44:32] uh Jacob along the way.
[44:34] and uh and and then Jacob came to
[44:37] realize that uh this is his you know uh
[44:41] his relative and then uh he right in
[44:45] there you know uh uh he started falling
[44:49] in love with this young woman but then
[44:52] she would take him you know to go and
[44:54] see her her you know her father her
[44:57] brothers and the story would take her
[45:00] from there.
[45:02] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[45:06] That's in uh Genesis chapter 29. Let's
[45:09] look there a little bit.
[45:16] I thought I will I will keep a little
[45:18] portion of this but uh for Sunday but we
[45:21] will see how the Lord will be able to
[45:22] help us tonight. Praise the Lord.
[45:25] Something drew me to this and uh I pray
[45:28] that uh the Lord can uh help us to be
[45:31] able to bring you out. So the Bible will
[45:33] let us know here that uh reading from
[45:36] verse 15
[45:52] from verse 15 or verse 16 uh 15. Elijah
[45:56] said unto Jacob, "Because thou are my uh
[45:59] thou are my brother, shouldest thou
[46:01] therefore save me for nothing? Tell me,
[46:04] what shall what shall thy wages be?" And
[46:09] Lavan had two daughters.
[46:11] The the name of the elder was Leah and
[46:15] the name of the the younger was Richard.
[46:19] Leah was uh tender eyed, but Rachel was
[46:23] beautiful and well favored. And Jacob
[46:26] loved Rachel and said, "I will save thee
[46:30] seven years for Rachel,
[46:34] thy young daughter." And that said,
[46:39] it is it is between it is better that I
[46:43] give her to thee than that I I should
[46:46] give her to another man aband
[46:51] seven years for Rachel and it seems unto
[46:56] him but a few days which mean he it was
[47:00] it was just like a quick one you know
[47:02] and it seems like it was a few days for
[47:05] he for the love he had for her. He never
[47:09] thought about it. He was not even
[47:11] counting the days. He was not counting
[47:13] the months. Yeah. I mean, uh, it went so
[47:17] damn fast. And, uh, and Jacob said unto
[47:20] Elean, "Give me my wife, for my days are
[47:24] fulfilled, that I may go and unto her."
[47:28] And Laban gathered together all the men
[47:30] of the place uh, and made a feast. And
[47:34] it came to pass in the evening that he
[47:37] took Leah his his daughter and brought
[47:40] her to him and he went in unto her and
[47:44] uh and Lavan gave unto his daughter Leah
[47:48] uh Zelpath he uh his handmade for his
[47:53] maid for an
[47:57] in the morning behold
[47:59] it was lethar and uh he said unto L and
[48:03] Jacob is speaking. And what is this that
[48:06] thou done unto men? Did not I say
[48:10] did did not I with thee for richer
[48:14] wherefore then thou wherefore have thou
[48:18] begel me? And Laban said it must not be
[48:23] so done in our country to give the
[48:25] younger before the firstborn.
[48:28] Now so we go we doing all of this
[48:31] reading because I just want to grab your
[48:32] attention. But we know the story. And uh
[48:36] uh uh so Y said Jacob, you know, he's
[48:40] he's carrying on. I mean I mean he's not
[48:42] happy about this. Okay. He's not happy
[48:45] that uh uh you know, Leah is given to
[48:49] him and now Richard. I mean, he's not
[48:51] happy because I mean, his heart, his
[48:54] mind, everything was in this to be able
[48:56] to work and and and you know, when and
[48:58] married this young girl that he, you
[49:01] know, uh that he fell in love with, you
[49:04] know, at first sight, but turn the
[49:08] picture around
[49:10] on the other side, Almighty God
[49:15] is writing the story.
[49:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. And the council
[49:21] of God cannot be broken.
[49:25] Praise the Lord. Now, so you you you
[49:28] have to see it now. This is a tie, but
[49:30] just see it now that uh uh uh uh
[49:36] Laban is going to tell him that this is
[49:39] not done in our country. You can you can
[49:41] take the younger one without the the the
[49:46] uh the older one. The older one is
[49:48] married first before the younger one.
[49:50] Praise the Lord. Now uh uh and then
[49:55] Jacob again will go into an agreement uh
[50:00] verse uh 27 fulfill her weeks and uh we
[50:04] will give thee this also for the service
[50:09] which thou shalt serve with me yet seven
[50:13] other years. So there is a seven year
[50:16] for Leah and there is a sevenyear for
[50:22] Richard.
[50:24] Praise the Lord. Now so we are taking
[50:26] this thought in line with uh uh with
[50:31] with some of the things that we will
[50:32] read to you. Let me let me pick up some
[50:34] of them here. uh uh invasion of the US
[50:39] uh invasion of the USA in the Old
[50:42] Testament. If the Lord willing, maybe in
[50:45] the coming services, I did like to show
[50:48] how that how that the seven church ages
[50:53] typed out in the Old Testament.
[50:56] Praise the Lord.
[50:58] We know in revelation brings out seven
[51:02] church ages from La I mean from Ephesus
[51:05] to Laudisha. Praise the Lord. And these
[51:08] seven church ages were where the all
[51:12] gentile church ages. Are we together?
[51:16] But you have to see here that uh the
[51:19] gentile age began
[51:22] from a Jewish church. Are we together?
[51:27] Peter, James, and all of those
[51:29] disciples, they were all they were all
[51:30] they were all Jews.
[51:33] And that is the reason why when Peter
[51:36] went to the house of Kolenus, we know he
[51:38] had to go by the vision, the Lord there
[51:41] with him, you say, I've never eaten
[51:43] anything unclean. And God says, what
[51:45] I've made clean, don't call it unclean.
[51:47] There are two men that are coming to
[51:49] pick you up. They will take you to a
[51:51] certain place. I want you to declare my
[51:53] word. Are we together? Amen. Praise the
[51:56] Lord. And when Peter went there, this is
[51:59] a gentile church.
[52:03] This is a gentile believers that he's
[52:05] going to, you know, uh uh preach. And
[52:08] the Bible says why Peter preached the
[52:12] Holy Ghost fell.
[52:14] If you read the book of uh uh uh uh
[52:17] first and second Peter, Peter testified
[52:21] that the way the Gentiles received the
[52:24] Holy Ghost were better than the way the
[52:25] Jews receive it.
[52:30] If you read first and second Peter, you
[52:32] will see the record there
[52:37] because he was part of the group in the
[52:39] offer room. He waited on the Holy Ghost.
[52:41] You know, did they not know what was
[52:43] going to happen? You know, they were
[52:45] just following Jesus instruction. Wait
[52:48] until you are endued with power from on
[52:50] high. Are we together?
[52:54] And they were waiting and they were
[52:56] waiting and they were waiting and then
[52:58] finally uh the Bible says when they were
[53:01] in one accord in one mind the Holy Ghost
[53:03] came I call him to the promise. Praise
[53:06] the Lord. 10 days.
[53:09] in 10 days. That's that's that's what
[53:12] gave the name Pentecost because it was
[53:15] uh uh uh you have to know after the
[53:17] resurrection 40 days you know Jesus
[53:21] there were there were there were
[53:22] resurrected saints that was moving about
[53:24] 40 days and then after that ascension
[53:28] when Jesus ascended 10 days after so
[53:30] complete 50 days Pentecost are we
[53:33] together? Amen. So uh uh uh uh so that
[53:38] here is here is Peter, James, John and
[53:41] and and uh and James will even testify
[53:45] in Acts chapter 15. You know uh uh he
[53:48] would talk about uh the the Gentiles
[53:51] that have come to believe that there was
[53:53] a prophecy in the book of Amos that God
[53:56] prophesied he was going to do a a
[53:58] powerful work, a quick short work among
[54:00] the Gentiles. And this is what is
[54:02] happening because you see these Jew
[54:04] these Jewish believers because of how
[54:07] much they were they were they they were
[54:10] taught in the Torah and they were you
[54:12] know holding to the Torah they just
[54:14] couldn't allow some of those legalistic
[54:17] things to go. So they wanted they wanted
[54:19] the gentile believers to be circumcised.
[54:21] They wanted them to follow some uh some
[54:24] Jewish ritual before they will accept
[54:26] them in the church. The believer says
[54:30] no. Amen. That God is not respected of
[54:34] person. Amen. Peter says that God is not
[54:38] respected of person. I saw it with my
[54:40] eyes. Praise the Lord. We had to wait
[54:44] for 10 days. But these people were under
[54:46] so much expectation when I started to
[54:49] testify about the resurrection of Jesus
[54:52] Christ. The same experience that we had
[54:55] in the in the upper room. They had the
[54:57] same experience. Why Peter speak this
[55:00] word? The Holy Ghost felt. Amen. And you
[55:02] can receive the Holy Ghost under the
[55:04] preaching of the word. Amen. If your
[55:06] heart is right. Amen. And you are under
[55:09] expectation. Amen. So every time the
[55:11] word is preached,
[55:13] the Holy Ghost is falling. Amen. Amen.
[55:17] Praise the Lord. So every service is a
[55:19] Pentecost for us. Amen. Amen. Every
[55:23] service is a Pentecost. That's the
[55:25] reason why we must we must labor in the
[55:28] atmosphere. Amen. Let's labor and create
[55:31] the atmosphere. Amen. That's that just
[55:34] all we need to do. Praise the Lord.
[55:36] Let's get our mind right. Get our heart
[55:38] in and get into the worship. Get our
[55:41] mind off of the things, you know, uh
[55:43] that we have to do later or we were
[55:44] doing throughout the day. Just get into
[55:47] the word. Get into the worship. Praise
[55:49] the Lord. Amen. Because every service it
[55:52] is is a Pentecost. Amen. Are we
[55:54] together? So, we seeing right here the
[55:57] very same thing that played between
[56:00] Maine and and and and Ruth is playing
[56:02] right here. Uh uh uh Naom being a Jew
[56:06] brought a gentile Ruth in and then uh
[56:09] true Ruth now the king's man redeemer
[56:12] Boaz is now going to redeem everything
[56:15] that Naomi lost. So the very same thing
[56:17] is playing here. The Jewish church is
[56:20] now taking the gospel to a gentile
[56:22] people.
[56:24] Are we together? Amen. And when the
[56:28] gentile dispensation is over, this very
[56:31] message is going back to the Jews. Amen.
[56:35] Are we together? It's going to restore
[56:38] everything that the Jews lost.
[56:42] Are we together now? So, we see it right
[56:45] here. uh uh uh uh that uh uh Jacob is
[56:50] carrying out his life. He has he has he
[56:53] has left his brother Esau back. He
[56:55] forget about everything. He's over here.
[56:57] Opportunity to work. He's working.
[56:59] Everything is going well. You know uh he
[57:02] can't believe it. My you know the Lord
[57:05] is blessing him. Uh you know the Lord is
[57:07] prospering him. He his mind is set. You
[57:11] know he's going to uh uh take this uh uh
[57:14] uh wife. He's, you know, he's going to
[57:16] get married, get settled down, and, you
[57:18] know, uh, uh, and build his home. Praise
[57:21] the Lord.
[57:26] But
[57:33] God
[57:35] is writing out
[57:39] a prophecy.
[57:41] Amen.
[57:44] The same way Jacob is going uh uh work
[57:48] seven years for Leah and he's going to
[57:51] work seven more years
[57:54] for Rachel.
[57:56] All in God's mind he's seeing a seven
[57:59] church ages.
[58:04] Praise the Lord.
[58:06] All he all in his mind you you carry on
[58:09] your life. Do what you want to do. you
[58:10] know, you just go do it what what you
[58:12] want to do. And uh but I'm I'm going to
[58:15] I'm going to play out something in your
[58:17] life that is going to reflect a seven
[58:20] church ages.
[58:22] There's going to be a seven church ages
[58:25] through the the the Jewish dispensation.
[58:29] And there will be a seven church ages
[58:32] through the Gentile dispensation.
[58:36] Are we together? Amen. So Bram says here
[58:39] he says if the Lord willing may be to
[58:40] come in services they like to show how
[58:43] that the seven church ages type out in
[58:46] the old testament. So it's not just it's
[58:48] not just a the the book of revelation.
[58:51] Now we we know that uh uh uh in in the
[58:55] in the in the book of revelation the
[58:57] seven church ages was uh uh uh it it was
[59:02] designed because that that is the
[59:05] pattern you know like brother Brandham
[59:06] said you know a person bought a yard of
[59:09] cloth and and and then they have their
[59:12] measurements so they get right in there
[59:14] and then they cut to be able to sew the
[59:16] kind of a suit you see. So this the the
[59:19] the seven church ages was the entire
[59:22] material from where God would take out a
[59:24] bride.
[59:26] Are we together? Amen.
[59:30] He will caught in Ephesus. He will
[59:32] caught in in seminary and caught through
[59:34] all until audition and then he will get
[59:36] a bride. He will get a people for his
[59:39] name's sake. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[59:42] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[59:48] Now, so you see here is that uh just
[59:51] look at Ruth and and and and and and now
[59:55] and her husband they left Beth to him
[59:58] because of farming. We know the story.
[1:00:00] They went with their sons and and and
[1:00:02] their sons knowing very well that the
[1:00:04] word you know God have said they must
[1:00:07] not get you know a mar stranger. more
[1:00:11] over you know Moabites you know uh uh
[1:00:14] people from uh the lineage of of Lot
[1:00:17] having children with his daughters you
[1:00:19] know that that was that was an
[1:00:21] abomination but yet they did it the boys
[1:00:23] died now Naomi found herself to this
[1:00:27] place she don't have her son she felt
[1:00:29] like I need to go back home are we
[1:00:32] together
[1:00:34] amen
[1:00:37] they are living their life.
[1:00:41] But God has written a divine program.
[1:00:46] Amen.
[1:00:50] And it would drop on the heart of this
[1:00:52] gentile girl to tell this woman, "Your
[1:00:56] people will be my people. Your God will
[1:00:58] be my God. Where you would died, I will
[1:01:00] die."
[1:01:03] Praise the Lord. Not even knowing what
[1:01:05] is awaiting her.
[1:01:08] But it was God's design. Amen.
[1:01:12] Because in God's mind,
[1:01:14] a gentile people was going to come into
[1:01:17] the promise of Abraham.
[1:01:20] Are we together?
[1:01:25] Now, I mean, she's she's sad, you know.
[1:01:27] She she plead to this young lady,
[1:01:29] "Please go back. I'm I'm I'm old. I'm
[1:01:33] not going to I'm not going to have no
[1:01:34] other child again. I mean, I don't I
[1:01:37] don't I don't even have anything left.
[1:01:40] Just go back.
[1:01:44] But the inspiration of the Almighty was
[1:01:46] on Ruth, not even knowing what to
[1:01:49] expect.
[1:01:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:56] Amen.
[1:01:59] You see, that's the reason why uh uh uh
[1:02:02] the opening of the seals takes us back
[1:02:04] to familiar places because when when the
[1:02:07] word open to you and you begin to see
[1:02:10] what God had in his mind concerning you,
[1:02:14] praise the Lord. It raises your faith
[1:02:16] that no matter what you are going
[1:02:18] through, you know that this is what God
[1:02:21] says in his word. Amen. He had choose me
[1:02:25] in him. Amen.
[1:02:28] for me to walk holy. So no matter what
[1:02:31] uh you know my my the the the the mind
[1:02:34] battle that might be going in, the
[1:02:36] health battle that might be going
[1:02:37] whatever it is, you can be able to look
[1:02:40] at God promise. Amen. Amen. These people
[1:02:43] did not had it.
[1:02:45] Ruth did not had it. Now we can look at
[1:02:47] the story of Ruth and see ourselves. She
[1:02:49] never had anything to look at.
[1:02:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:57] Amen.
[1:03:00] We can we can read about Jacob uh uh uh
[1:03:03] uh working seven years and working seven
[1:03:06] years and I mean the Bible says he did
[1:03:08] it so quick
[1:03:11] that it was just nothing to him. He
[1:03:14] thought he was doing it for the wife but
[1:03:16] in God's mind you are writing out my
[1:03:19] seven church ages. Amen.
[1:03:23] So you see when a person is in the line
[1:03:26] of duty of God's promise
[1:03:30] his burden is what? Light.
[1:03:35] The burden of the word is light. Amen.
[1:03:39] Are we together?
[1:03:41] I hope you're getting the picture
[1:03:43] tonight. Amen. So he says here, I would
[1:03:46] like to show seven church ages out in
[1:03:48] the Old Testament how that they begin
[1:03:51] just like the beginning of the of of the
[1:03:54] church ages of the Gentile and went and
[1:03:57] went right down through the similar dark
[1:04:00] age and come out into
[1:04:05] into the glorious time of Pentecost
[1:04:09] at the falling of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:04:13] early church
[1:04:16] of the Jewish dispensation. So, so uh uh
[1:04:20] they came to their Pentecost that was
[1:04:21] the Jewish people that experienced it.
[1:04:23] Then the Gentile the Ephesus church
[1:04:25] started out there uh with uh the Jews
[1:04:28] bringing the message to the Gentiles.
[1:04:30] Now, so uh what I what I want you to see
[1:04:32] here is that because many times many
[1:04:35] times uh uh uh when when our types are
[1:04:40] out of places, then we get a cow eating
[1:04:44] grass on top of the house. Now, so
[1:04:47] brother Brandham said this to be able to
[1:04:50] give us an insight that you can look at
[1:04:54] the gentile church ages, the seven
[1:04:56] gentile church ages. You know what uh uh
[1:04:59] uh uh it is written there uh Jesus told
[1:05:03] John onto the church of Ephesus, right?
[1:05:06] You can see it plainly. There is nothing
[1:05:09] said in the Old Testament unto the first
[1:05:12] church of the Jews onto the second
[1:05:15] church of the Jews. What is in the Old
[1:05:18] Testament is only types.
[1:05:22] So you can type certain think like uh h
[1:05:26] Ahab marrying Jezebel.
[1:05:30] You can type that to what? Tarot
[1:05:35] because it was an age of ungodly
[1:05:38] marriage.
[1:05:40] So in the old testament you can be able
[1:05:43] to pick up types
[1:05:45] year and there. So there is no direct
[1:05:48] order.
[1:05:50] Praise the Lord. Are we together? Amen.
[1:05:53] Because what happen most of the time is
[1:05:56] that we go looking for information
[1:06:00] instead of looking for Christ the
[1:06:04] anointed word.
[1:06:06] Amen.
[1:06:08] We go looking for information. Okay.
[1:06:10] Yeah. This now okay the garden of Eden
[1:06:12] will be the first age and then the time
[1:06:14] of Abraham will be the second church
[1:06:16] age. I mean you you will just before you
[1:06:19] realize you will run out of material
[1:06:23] and you will hang yourself.
[1:06:26] So the the seven Jewish church ages is
[1:06:30] in a type
[1:06:35] and when you are doing types there are
[1:06:38] places where types holds and there are
[1:06:40] places where types breaks. What do I
[1:06:44] mean? Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus.
[1:06:48] Are we together? He's a perfect type.
[1:06:51] But when he tore a lie, the tie breaks.
[1:06:54] Jesus will never tell a lie.
[1:06:58] So you see, there are places where tie
[1:07:00] holes and there are places where types
[1:07:02] breaks. Are we together?
[1:07:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:13] I think I love are we together? Because
[1:07:15] we're supposed to stay together.
[1:07:18] Then do you love the Lord? I need to
[1:07:21] take that language from my mouth. Amen.
[1:07:24] I don't think it's a bad language, but
[1:07:26] uh uh
[1:07:29] are we together? So we so you see here
[1:07:32] now that he was he was say something
[1:07:34] here also in uh in the message of grace.
[1:07:37] uh Zarabia the prince with Joshua was
[1:07:41] one that was to bring forth this
[1:07:44] hairstone.
[1:07:46] He had laid the foundation. He did took
[1:07:49] the people back to the foundation in
[1:07:52] type in type
[1:07:56] because we have to realize that uh God
[1:07:59] never sent us a theologian. Brother
[1:08:01] Brandham is not a theologian. Brother
[1:08:04] Brandham is not a scholar.
[1:08:08] He was not sent to give us Bible
[1:08:11] commentaries.
[1:08:13] The ministry of the brother Brandham was
[1:08:14] to tie the loose ends.
[1:08:18] To tie the loose end. The Holy Ghost was
[1:08:21] going to come in there those those
[1:08:23] little those little places where we h we
[1:08:28] needed connected for it to make more
[1:08:30] sense to us. Amen.
[1:08:35] That was the ministry of the end time
[1:08:38] Elijah to tie the loose ends, not to
[1:08:40] write us a study Bible,
[1:08:43] a concordance
[1:08:46] to give us the Greek and the Hebrew.
[1:08:51] No. So, so what he says, he says, "Well,
[1:08:53] the uh uh uh you know, uh uh
[1:08:59] his seminary that he went to was neology
[1:09:02] on his knees and he graduated with
[1:09:05] typology
[1:09:07] to be able to take the types and make us
[1:09:11] to see things. Are we together?" Amen.
[1:09:20] Because sometimes people get caught up
[1:09:23] in their world that you know I check all
[1:09:25] through the message. Brother never said
[1:09:27] nothing about this scripture.
[1:09:29] Does that mean that scripture is silent?
[1:09:31] No.
[1:09:33] No. Because we still have the Holy
[1:09:35] Ghost. If the Holy Ghost will say
[1:09:38] anything about that scripture, it will
[1:09:39] bring us back to the word. It will not
[1:09:42] contradict the word at all. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:47] So, Zarabel, yeah, the prince of Joshua,
[1:09:51] I really never thought I was going to go
[1:09:52] like this, but that's that's okay. The
[1:09:54] prince of Joshua was the one that was to
[1:09:57] bring forth the hairstone and uh uh uh
[1:10:01] he had laid the foundation. He did took
[1:10:04] the people back to the foundation in
[1:10:07] type. So, he was typing he was typing
[1:10:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. Jesus Christ is our
[1:10:13] Zaruba. He laid the cornerstone. He put
[1:10:16] the hair stone. Amen. He's the author
[1:10:19] and the finisher of our faith
[1:10:28] which we all know that these
[1:10:31] candlesticks
[1:10:33] and so forth represented both Jewish and
[1:10:38] uh both uh Jewish and the church. When
[1:10:41] you say Jewish and the church which mean
[1:10:43] Jews and Gentile. Amen.
[1:10:46] So he's talking about the the
[1:10:48] candlestick in the book of of Zachariah.
[1:10:52] You remember uh the the the angel was
[1:10:55] talking to Zachariah he you know uh uh
[1:10:58] uh the seven candlestick and he had to
[1:11:01] light it. So he's saying here that uh
[1:11:03] that those seven candlesticks was
[1:11:06] representing both Jews and the church.
[1:11:11] So seven candlesticks, seven church
[1:11:13] ages.
[1:11:14] Because when you come to Revelation
[1:11:16] chapter one, there's seven golden
[1:11:20] candlesticks.
[1:11:22] In Zechariah, I think is lampstand
[1:11:26] in Revelation is candlesticks.
[1:11:31] Are you getting the picture tonight?
[1:11:33] Amen. Okay.
[1:11:39] They they were olive branch. The Bible
[1:11:42] said here that the olive branch, we are
[1:11:45] the Y branch that was grafted into the
[1:11:50] roots. Paul speaks about this. They grip
[1:11:52] the vine
[1:11:54] uh uh into the root to be to be tame
[1:11:58] olive tree gentiles.
[1:12:01] And out of these two branches come
[1:12:05] sensor pipes going into the seven golden
[1:12:09] candlesticks to be light to the seven
[1:12:12] church ages.
[1:12:15] So you see uh when when you when you
[1:12:18] look at things and and you find people
[1:12:20] saying no that was in the old testament.
[1:12:24] No
[1:12:26] it still represent today.
[1:12:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Because they are
[1:12:30] not divided books.
[1:12:33] Amen.
[1:12:34] Saying old and new was just to be able
[1:12:38] to show us dispensation. The old
[1:12:40] dispensation and the new dispensation.
[1:12:44] That's why Jesus say I have not come to
[1:12:46] destroy the Lord. I've come to fulfilled
[1:12:48] it. That's right.
[1:12:50] Are we together?
[1:12:53] So you cannot say that. Oh, I mean it's
[1:12:56] a it's a Old Testament thing in the New
[1:12:59] Testament. No, everything in the Old
[1:13:02] Testament has its representation in the
[1:13:05] New Testament.
[1:13:08] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:12] Are we together?
[1:13:19] Now look, take this other one again. Uh
[1:13:28] notice
[1:13:30] all seven Jewish feast I kept in the
[1:13:34] same place
[1:13:36] which which are the the feast of unleven
[1:13:38] bread you know the the feast of
[1:13:42] Pentecost the feast of the Passover and
[1:13:44] all of these all the seven Jewish feasts
[1:13:46] I kept in the same place. They never
[1:13:48] kept one feast year for the Meadows and
[1:13:51] one over for the Baptist and one for the
[1:13:53] Presbyterian, one back year for the
[1:13:56] Catholic or one for the Protestant. All
[1:13:59] seven feasts I kept in the same place.
[1:14:02] It is a beautiful type.
[1:14:06] It's a beautiful type
[1:14:11] because if you don't see it as a type,
[1:14:15] you will make it a law.
[1:14:19] You would think that you have to do the
[1:14:22] very same thing they were doing in the
[1:14:24] Old Testament, but it was a type. The
[1:14:27] Lord was a type and shadow of good
[1:14:30] things to come.
[1:14:33] Are we together? Amen.
[1:14:37] In the Old Testament tabernacle, they
[1:14:39] had to sprinkle all the instruments and
[1:14:42] everything, the worshippers with the
[1:14:44] blood of of the sacrifice that that was
[1:14:47] killed for their sin, it has to be
[1:14:49] sprinkled on the people. In the New
[1:14:51] Testament, the sprinkling of the blood
[1:14:53] is the preaching of the word. Amen.
[1:14:56] Amen. So that was just a type.
[1:15:01] We don't have to kill an animal in the
[1:15:03] backyard and bring blood here and sprink
[1:15:05] it on you. What we have to do is to
[1:15:07] preach
[1:15:09] the pure word. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:12] Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] Praise the Lord. So if the preacher
[1:15:16] preached the word and it looks like it
[1:15:18] gets down to you, it was just a sprinkle
[1:15:20] of blood that went in your eyes. It's
[1:15:23] part of your sacrifice.
[1:15:25] Amen. Amen. And if you believe that that
[1:15:28] lamb take your place, you are ready to
[1:15:30] even open your mouth for the blood to go
[1:15:32] inside. Amen. But the blood of animals
[1:15:35] will not cleanse you. You are just only
[1:15:39] identifying with your sacrifice by the
[1:15:41] sprinkling of the blood. And that is the
[1:15:44] same thing with the preaching of the
[1:15:45] word. Amen. When you say amen to the
[1:15:48] word, that's your sacrifice. It has to
[1:15:51] be your sacrifice. Amen. And not the
[1:15:54] other person. is my sacrifice. Thank you
[1:15:57] Lord for taking my place. Thank you for
[1:15:59] calling my name. Thank you for speaking
[1:16:02] to me. Amen. So it was a type. Are we
[1:16:06] together?
[1:16:10] So he said all the seven feasts were
[1:16:13] kept in the same place. It is a
[1:16:15] beautiful type year. We have just went
[1:16:18] through the seven church ages. going to
[1:16:21] show that God keep all the seven church
[1:16:24] ages in the same place. What is that
[1:16:27] place? The word.
[1:16:31] All the seven church ages were kept in
[1:16:34] the same place. Just like all the seven
[1:16:37] feasts, Hebrew feasts were kept in the
[1:16:40] same place.
[1:16:42] Are you seeing the picture? Amen. You
[1:16:45] seeing how the sevens are all running
[1:16:48] out together? Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:16:52] Lord. Amen. The servants are running out
[1:16:55] together. So you can see clearly that
[1:16:58] when the when the women told Anna mean
[1:17:01] that your daughter-in-law she's better
[1:17:03] than seven sons.
[1:17:06] Even if you have you only had two, if
[1:17:08] you have seven, this girl is better than
[1:17:10] seven son. Why? Because she got married
[1:17:13] to uh uh uh the Lord of the harvest. a
[1:17:16] man that was able to redeem everything
[1:17:18] you lost. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:24] Praise the Lord. If she was even married
[1:17:27] to your son, if he was not a wealthy
[1:17:29] man, he couldn't redeem what you lost.
[1:17:33] That's why we are not married to the
[1:17:35] messenger.
[1:17:37] We are married to the Lord of the
[1:17:38] harvest. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise
[1:17:42] the Lord. the Lord of the harvest. He
[1:17:45] was the one in uh and in the ministry of
[1:17:48] the messengers. Amen.
[1:17:51] Praise the Lord. He was the one uh h
[1:17:55] that have an ear, let him hear what the
[1:17:58] spirit said unto the church. That's what
[1:18:00] that's what every age had. So it was
[1:18:02] Christ speaking through the messenger.
[1:18:05] We must be able to see Christ that is
[1:18:07] speaking through the messenger. We must
[1:18:09] fall in love with Christ that is
[1:18:11] speaking through the messenger. Amen.
[1:18:13] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:20] Because uh when we find our place
[1:18:24] as the bride of Christ, you realize that
[1:18:28] it took those seven messengers to bring
[1:18:30] us to where we are today. And we are
[1:18:33] better than seven sons.
[1:18:38] Are we together?
[1:18:41] I'm going in cycles here tonight. Praise
[1:18:44] the Lord. I get a few minutes and then I
[1:18:46] will I will let you go home.
[1:18:49] So, are you are you seeing the picture?
[1:18:52] Amen. Are you seeing the picture? I was
[1:18:55] I was uh I mean I was reading one day.
[1:18:57] No, I was actually more in the lawn and
[1:19:00] I was listening to something. I can't
[1:19:02] remember which message or something I
[1:19:04] was listening to. And then this this
[1:19:06] whole thing about Jacob and Lead and
[1:19:09] Rachel just it just came uh so real to
[1:19:12] me. And I say I say, "Well, yeah, I
[1:19:15] think I think I see my my uh uh uh seven
[1:19:19] church ages in the Gentile
[1:19:22] just like I mean seven church ages in
[1:19:24] the Jews just like it's in the Gentile.
[1:19:28] Are we together?" Amen. And then I I
[1:19:31] just I just kept that, you know, uh uh
[1:19:34] uh you know, just just just thinking
[1:19:36] about it all the time, you know, because
[1:19:39] I mean it it just came real to me. But
[1:19:41] there was something else that I saw that
[1:19:43] that just make me to come up with this
[1:19:45] tonight. I'll share that with you before
[1:19:46] we close.
[1:19:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:51] Amen.
[1:19:56] Now see Kingsman redeemer. Yeah. Let's
[1:19:58] just take a uh one touch here. Now Boas,
[1:20:03] he had to make a had to make public. He
[1:20:06] said, "Can you redeem her?" He's talking
[1:20:07] to the man because there was a man that
[1:20:10] was more closer to Naomi than Boas.
[1:20:13] Praise the Lord. There was a man that
[1:20:15] was more closer
[1:20:18] and there is a man that is more closer
[1:20:20] to us than Christ.
[1:20:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:26] closer in a sense of our our spirit and
[1:20:29] our flesh. Yeah.
[1:20:32] Because he's the prince of the power of
[1:20:34] the air which is the spirit that
[1:20:36] dwelleth in the sons of disobedient.
[1:20:40] So that whole spiritman of us is all
[1:20:43] mixed out of uh uh uh the serpent and
[1:20:46] Eve
[1:20:48] and the product is this fallen flesh.
[1:20:51] So he's the man that is more closer, but
[1:20:54] he's not able to redeem us. He's not
[1:20:56] able to carry us back to our original
[1:20:59] state. There is a kingsman redeemer that
[1:21:03] took the book and broke the seals. Are
[1:21:06] we together? Amen.
[1:21:18] Bo said to the man, "Can you redeem
[1:21:20] her?" He said, "No." Then he had to make
[1:21:23] a public testimony. He picked off his
[1:21:26] shoes and threw it in the air and said,
[1:21:28] "There you are. Let all Israel know that
[1:21:31] I have redeemed now me and and I also
[1:21:34] take Ruth." Amen.
[1:21:39] I take Ruth for a bride.
[1:21:43] Who is it? The Lord of the harvest.
[1:21:46] There she is. I redeem Naomi and I get
[1:21:49] Ruth
[1:21:52] and Ruth will be my bride.
[1:21:56] What did they said? May her be like Leah
[1:22:02] and Rachel. We read that.
[1:22:04] And then and raise up thousands and she
[1:22:08] has that right onto Israel.
[1:22:12] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:17] May she be that way. Look, he made a
[1:22:20] public testimony. What did Jesus do to
[1:22:23] do it? He made a public testimony when
[1:22:25] Satan could not die for sin because he
[1:22:29] was a sinner. He was the father of sin.
[1:22:32] But Jesus, the innocent one, God of
[1:22:34] heaven, who didn't have to die, come
[1:22:37] down and make a public testimony by
[1:22:40] dying, lifting lifted up between heaven
[1:22:44] and earth. a public testimony. Strip
[1:22:46] strip his clothes off of him and hang
[1:22:50] and and and and hang between heaven and
[1:22:52] earth in shame and die a sinful shameful
[1:22:56] death to redeem us a public testimony.
[1:22:59] Amen. What did he do? He kicked off his
[1:23:03] own righteousness. He kicked off his own
[1:23:06] glory. Amen.
[1:23:09] I have power. I could speak to my father
[1:23:12] and straightway he would send me uh 20
[1:23:15] legions of angels. They could change the
[1:23:18] course. One angels could have done it.
[1:23:21] He could have called for 20 legions.
[1:23:26] Uh uh that being about 40,000 angels,
[1:23:30] what what could they have done? He said
[1:23:34] I could speak to my father straightway.
[1:23:36] Is that right? He did send mean 20
[1:23:39] legions of angels to come here and take
[1:23:42] over. And what will one do? One will
[1:23:46] destroy the earth in a second. Uh uh
[1:23:50] just look. He had thousands that could
[1:23:54] have done it. See, but he kicked that
[1:23:57] off. Wow. He laid that aside.
[1:24:02] He laid all his dignity, everything
[1:24:04] aside and become a sinner and die for
[1:24:09] you and I. Praise the Lord. What a kings
[1:24:14] redeemer.
[1:24:15] Amen. Our kings redeemer had to identify
[1:24:19] with us.
[1:24:22] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:25] Are we together? Amen.
[1:24:28] So we see here that uh uh uh uh this
[1:24:32] whole thing playing out. So you will see
[1:24:34] that in the life uh you see that in the
[1:24:36] life of David when he was he was you
[1:24:39] know uh uh forsaken and and Saul was
[1:24:42] seeking his life. He went on the
[1:24:44] mountain you know just like the rejected
[1:24:46] king. You see that in in all the Old
[1:24:49] Testament, many of the Old Testament
[1:24:51] characters. And like Bert Brandham said,
[1:24:53] God was writing out prophecies in the
[1:24:56] life of these men.
[1:25:00] That you and myself, we hang our faith
[1:25:02] on. They were living their normal life,
[1:25:05] going through their struggle, but God
[1:25:08] was writing prophecy.
[1:25:10] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:13] Praise the Lord. They never knew nothing
[1:25:15] about it.
[1:25:17] David never even knew that uh his
[1:25:20] prayer, my God, my God, why have thou
[1:25:22] forsaken me? He never knew that it was
[1:25:24] by inspiration he said that
[1:25:31] the son of God will hang on that prayer.
[1:25:36] Are we together? Amen. Now, so you see
[1:25:39] all of these things uh you knowh as as
[1:25:42] they come together, you see all of the
[1:25:45] tie playing out there. So I wanted to
[1:25:46] bring out this uh this uh uh uh uh seven
[1:25:52] seven church ages year of of the Jews
[1:25:55] and seven church age of the gentile. But
[1:25:57] yet here is the thing that caught my
[1:25:58] attention. Here is the thing that caught
[1:26:01] my attention. I thought I would keep it
[1:26:02] for Sunday but you have exhausted all my
[1:26:05] inspiration tonight. Amen.
[1:26:08] You have taken everything out of me. So
[1:26:10] if I should continue to speak, then I
[1:26:12] have to bring out
[1:26:16] the hidden manner. Amen. Let's go back
[1:26:18] to Genesis chapter 29.
[1:26:21] This is the thing that caught my
[1:26:23] attention.
[1:26:25] Oh, praise the Lord. You love the Lord.
[1:26:28] He's so good. He's so good. He's so
[1:26:31] good. We love him with all of our life.
[1:26:34] With the breath that we breathe, we love
[1:26:37] him. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:39] Genesis 29. Look here now. Let's let's
[1:26:42] read here
[1:26:48] 29. Uh
[1:26:52] let's read from verse 31.
[1:27:00] From verse 30. And he went in also onto
[1:27:04] Rachel. Now he has already worked seven
[1:27:06] years for Rachel. And uh and he loved
[1:27:11] and he loved also Rachel more than Leah
[1:27:13] and self with him. Yes. Seven other
[1:27:17] years.
[1:27:18] And when the Lord saw that Leah was
[1:27:22] hated. The Bible says he opened her womb
[1:27:26] but
[1:27:28] richer was barren. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:32] Amen. Now we deal with this also. If you
[1:27:36] forget I remind you. And if you don't
[1:27:38] remember, I'll preach it again. How
[1:27:40] baroness
[1:27:43] was baroness. God used baroness in the
[1:27:47] Old Testament. If if you if you watch
[1:27:49] it, especially in the patriarch, there
[1:27:51] are two things that play out. Baroness
[1:27:54] and blindness.
[1:27:58] Now, Paul will come out and tell us that
[1:28:01] blindness happened to the Jews in part.
[1:28:05] Amen.
[1:28:08] So most of the patriarch like Isaac the
[1:28:10] blindness really show in Isaac he was
[1:28:13] blind. Are we together? Now you will
[1:28:16] also see that uh there were baroness
[1:28:19] that play out in the wife of the
[1:28:21] patriot.
[1:28:23] God will promise Abraham a seed but yet
[1:28:26] Sarah will be barren.
[1:28:31] So we realize that God had a purpose to
[1:28:34] them. It was uh it was it was uh you
[1:28:36] know a terrible condition but to God it
[1:28:40] was not terrible at all. Praise the
[1:28:43] Lord. Amen. Because he had a reason.
[1:28:47] The reason there is that the law will be
[1:28:50] barren. The law will never be able to
[1:28:52] bring forth Christ.
[1:28:54] So God was showing in the patriots
[1:28:58] uh h uh uh uh Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel,
[1:29:03] all the the h mothers there of the
[1:29:06] patriarch, they went through this season
[1:29:09] and it looks like they were barren. The
[1:29:11] Bible says they were barren. Yeah. The
[1:29:13] Bible says, you know, uh uh Rachel was
[1:29:16] barren,
[1:29:17] but yet at the end she will have Joseph
[1:29:20] and Benjamin.
[1:29:22] At the end, Sarah will have Isaac.
[1:29:27] Praise the Lord. Amen. At the end,
[1:29:30] Hannah will have her two sons or he she
[1:29:33] will have Samuel and mold other children
[1:29:35] to come after. Are we together? Are you
[1:29:38] seeing the picture? Praise the Lord. I'm
[1:29:40] just I'm just trying to to to redeem our
[1:29:43] time here. And when the Lord saw that
[1:29:45] Leah was headed, he opened, you know,
[1:29:47] her womb. But Rachel was barren and and
[1:29:51] and uh and Leah conceived in bed a son
[1:29:55] and she called him call his name Ruben.
[1:29:59] Listen to this now. For she said,
[1:30:02] "Surely the Lord has looked upon my
[1:30:04] affliction. Now therefore
[1:30:08] my husband will love me." Praise the
[1:30:12] Lord. Amen.
[1:30:14] a natural crave in in in in her for for
[1:30:18] love.
[1:30:20] Now he will love me. Now that I brought
[1:30:23] forth a son, I brought I brought forth
[1:30:26] his firstborn. It's a son.
[1:30:29] Now he will love me. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:33] Are we together?
[1:30:35] You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:40] And the Bible says, "And she conceived
[1:30:42] again and and and be a son and said,
[1:30:46] because the Lord has heard
[1:30:50] that I was hated. He had therefore given
[1:30:54] me this son also." And she called his
[1:30:57] name Simeon. I can I can hear the human
[1:31:00] part. Somebody say h, they are feeling
[1:31:03] the hatred.
[1:31:06] Praise the Lord. I get, you know, that's
[1:31:08] that's the human expression if we can
[1:31:10] feed it. We we are touched by the
[1:31:13] feeling of of human things. Amen. But
[1:31:16] you you you see the thing I want us to
[1:31:18] see beyond that, right? Amen. I I don't
[1:31:22] want us to fall into uh uh uh uh I mean,
[1:31:26] yeah, they were living out their life,
[1:31:28] but now we can see that God play out
[1:31:31] certain things in their life for our
[1:31:33] benefit.
[1:31:34] Praise the Lord. I'm not going to be
[1:31:36] sorry for Leah being barren or or Leah
[1:31:39] being hated. I'm not going to be sorry
[1:31:41] for that because I can see what is
[1:31:43] playing out here and I will soon see it.
[1:31:46] Amen.
[1:31:48] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:51] That is the benefit of the opening of
[1:31:53] the seals because what? It takes us
[1:31:55] beyond the letters. It takes us into the
[1:31:58] reality. It takes us into the mind of
[1:32:01] God. Why did God allow it? Amen. Amen.
[1:32:05] Amen.
[1:32:07] Why did God allow Joseph youth to be
[1:32:10] wasted?
[1:32:13] When he thought it was all over, then he
[1:32:15] had to go into prison. Why did God allow
[1:32:18] I'm not going to feel sorry for him?
[1:32:20] Because now I have seen it.
[1:32:23] Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[1:32:28] Now, let's let's go. Let's let's go. Uh
[1:32:31] yeah. And the Bible said verse 34, "And
[1:32:33] she conceive again and bear a son. And
[1:32:36] now this time will my husband be joined
[1:32:40] unto me because I have I I I have bold
[1:32:44] him a tear son." Therefore she name him
[1:32:50] Levi.
[1:32:52] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:56] You can see uh in a woman, you can see
[1:33:00] in a church, you can see in a believer
[1:33:04] that is looking at their life condition
[1:33:08] and asking, "Do God really love me?
[1:33:14] Now I got a better job. I can pay my
[1:33:16] tithe. I the Lord will love me." Maybe
[1:33:18] maybe uh because most of the time we try
[1:33:21] to we try to uh see God love in
[1:33:24] perishable things.
[1:33:30] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:33:34] Now I will be joined unto my husband.
[1:33:36] Now he will love me. I I've bear him
[1:33:38] another son.
[1:33:41] She's craving for it. And that's what we
[1:33:44] are craving for. We want to feed the
[1:33:47] love of God.
[1:33:50] But tell me what can what what what can
[1:33:53] be compared? What can God do for you now
[1:33:57] that can ever be compared or surpass
[1:33:59] Calvary?
[1:34:01] What can God do for you now? What can he
[1:34:04] give you now tonight
[1:34:06] that can pass Calvary? What can he give
[1:34:09] you tonight that can ever be better than
[1:34:12] what he taught about you from the
[1:34:13] foundation of the word?
[1:34:16] Amen. Because he's not going to give you
[1:34:18] anything different. He's not going to
[1:34:20] give you anything new. His works were
[1:34:23] finished from the foundation of the
[1:34:24] word. He have already laid it out. Amen.
[1:34:28] Amen. He already put it there in the
[1:34:30] bank of heaven. You got to cash it out.
[1:34:32] Amen. Every promise is there. Thank you,
[1:34:35] Lord. You're not going to make yourself
[1:34:36] sorrowful for God to to feel sorry for
[1:34:39] you. You're not going to do something to
[1:34:41] impress God.
[1:34:44] If you want God to bankrupt heaven, you
[1:34:47] got to believe his word.
[1:34:51] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:56] Are we together? Amen.
[1:35:02] Oh, I love this. Amen. Amen. I love
[1:35:04] this. Amen.
[1:35:07] And we all go through that. We all go
[1:35:10] through. That's that's the flesh. We go
[1:35:12] through it.
[1:35:15] We want to be able to feel his love.
[1:35:19] We want to feel it.
[1:35:24] Praise the Lord. Amen. Oh my. If I was
[1:35:28] really depending on that tonight, I
[1:35:29] would not be preaching because I'm
[1:35:31] telling you,
[1:35:33] if I was really depending on on feelings
[1:35:36] tonight, I won't be preaching.
[1:35:40] Glory be to God.
[1:35:46] You love the Lord tonight. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:49] Let's break this thing. It's 9:05, so I
[1:35:52] can let you go. Let's read yet again.
[1:35:54] And the Bible says verse 35, the last
[1:35:56] verse, this is the thing that came open
[1:35:58] to me. And she conceived again and bear
[1:36:01] a son, and she said, "Now will I praise
[1:36:05] the Lord."
[1:36:10] Now I'm going to praise the Lord. I have
[1:36:13] been looking for attention.
[1:36:15] I have been looking for to feel his
[1:36:18] love. Whether I feel or not, I'm going
[1:36:21] to praise him any heart. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:24] Amen. I've been looking for some kind of
[1:36:27] a thing to tell me that God love me. But
[1:36:30] what with the grace that I see in my
[1:36:32] life and what he's doing every day,
[1:36:34] whether I feel it or not, I'm going to
[1:36:36] praise him. Now, I praise the Lord.
[1:36:42] Amen. I don't have to wait for good
[1:36:44] shepherd approver.
[1:36:47] Praise the Lord. I don't have to wait
[1:36:49] for your approval. I don't have to wait
[1:36:51] for your support. I'm going to praise
[1:36:53] the Lord anyhow no matter what tomorrow
[1:36:56] brings. Amen. Amen. Amen. She says, "Now
[1:36:59] I will praise the Lord. I'm taking my
[1:37:01] eyes off of men." I'm taking my eyes off
[1:37:04] of looking for fleshly approval. I'm
[1:37:07] going to praise God. I don't care
[1:37:10] whether I'm your best preacher or not.
[1:37:12] I'm going to praise God anyhow.
[1:37:15] Oh my. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:19] Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] I'm not going to look for man's
[1:37:22] approver. I'm going to praise the Lord.
[1:37:26] Amen. Oh my. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:30] Amen. When the Lord opened this to me, I
[1:37:32] said, "No, I got to preach my I got to
[1:37:33] just go back to my seven Gentiles, seven
[1:37:36] Jewish church ages, and just uh and just
[1:37:38] share something with the people
[1:37:40] tonight." Oh my God. Come on. Let's
[1:37:43] let's uh let's uh pray and so we can be
[1:37:46] able to go home. Let the musicians come
[1:37:50] forth. Amen.
[1:37:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:59] Hallelujah.
[1:38:01] When she got got the first son, this is
[1:38:04] the first born. Thank you, Jesus. I've
[1:38:06] got the firstborn.
[1:38:08] Amen. Now my husband will love me.
[1:38:12] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just play.
[1:38:16] No matter what tomorrow brings, how we
[1:38:18] praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:22] Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] And uh and it looks like Jacob was just
[1:38:27] carried away, you know. He was just
[1:38:30] carried away with with his little
[1:38:32] fishing love for for Rachel in his mind.
[1:38:36] You know, he was just carried away. You
[1:38:37] know, I I He was trying to make Rachel
[1:38:40] to don't feel bad. You know, uh you
[1:38:42] know, I really love you be more than
[1:38:44] your sister, even though your father was
[1:38:46] the one that pulled this out on me. He's
[1:38:48] trying to do everything to to assure
[1:38:50] Richard and and and and and it looks
[1:38:53] like she's not she's not, you know,
[1:38:55] she's not also uh you know, uh uh
[1:39:00] uh you know, she's she's not she's not
[1:39:04] having a child.
[1:39:09] I believe in in in in Jacob's mind, he
[1:39:11] would have wished that Rachel is the one
[1:39:13] that had the firstborn. But that was not
[1:39:15] what in God's mind.
[1:39:18] Praise the Lord. You see, God was trying
[1:39:20] to get Leah's attention, and Leah was
[1:39:24] looking for man's attention.
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:30] I will praise
[1:39:34] the Lord.
[1:39:38] Oh, I
[1:39:40] will praise
[1:39:42] the Lord.
[1:39:47] No matter what tomorrow brings,
[1:39:52] what it has in store,
[1:39:55] I know I
[1:39:58] will praise
[1:40:00] the Lord.
[1:40:03] Oh,
[1:40:05] I
[1:40:06] I'm going to praise the Lord.
[1:40:13] Yeah, I
