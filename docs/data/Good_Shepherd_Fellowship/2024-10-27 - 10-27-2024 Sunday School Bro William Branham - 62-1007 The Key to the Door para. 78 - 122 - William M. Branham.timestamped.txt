[3:22] things on her back and he looked around
[3:24] again
[3:27] [Music]
[3:53] personally uh testimony I remember about
[3:58] 15 17 years years ago now about when the
[4:02] Lord said to me down there on the river
[4:05] when he came down in that Pillar of Fire
[4:08] whose picture you see and he spoke to me
[4:11] and he said you're to take this message
[4:14] around the
[4:15] world I remember at Greens Mill when he
[4:18] spoke to me and I went and told the
[4:21] pastor and he told me he said bil what
[4:24] did you eat that night you had a
[4:27] nightmare
[4:29] he said go on back to your job you're
[4:32] working at the Public Service Company
[4:33] got a good job go on back and take care
[4:35] of your your business son said you had a
[4:38] nightmare you eat something that didn't
[4:41] phase me one bit
[4:44] amen when I started out for the healing
[4:47] Services many of you here remember my
[4:49] message that morning as David went to
[4:51] meet Goliath I preached on and they told
[4:54] me he said in the day of modern science
[4:57] when we have got all kinds of medic
[5:00] research when we've got the best doctors
[5:03] when the church has long forgot Divine
[5:05] Healing and stuff from many many years
[5:07] ago how are you going before a great
[5:10] giant like that amen how are you going
[5:12] to walk out in the face of the Methodist
[5:14] Baptist Presbyterian and so forth and
[5:16] even the Pentecostals who has forgotten
[5:19] a long time ago and went into their
[5:21] Creeds how you go to face with no
[5:23] denomination nothing else to back you up
[5:26] what are you going to do Bill somehow
[5:29] and another it didn't phase me one bit
[5:33] for I help in my hand a
[5:37] [Music]
[5:38] key I said they said nobody will believe
[5:41] you you won't be able to do it nobody
[5:44] believe you I said I don't
[5:47] care there's one thing sure God called
[5:51] me and I must
[5:53] go because God called me Hallelujah I
[5:57] held the key he had called me he had
[6:00] showed me he had told me and I saw his
[6:02] presence when he commissioned me and the
[6:05] key was there amen the Pastor said with
[6:08] the seventh grade education and you're
[6:10] going to preach and pray before Kings
[6:13] and monarchs I said that's a according
[6:16] to his
[6:20] word about this time last
[6:23] year or a week or two before when i'
[6:26] come to the church and told you that the
[6:28] Lord God had giving me a vision of go
[6:31] taking a hunting trip and a certain
[6:35] animal I was going to find that going to
[6:37] have 42 in horns on it and on the road
[6:40] back from getting this animal where it
[6:42] would be laying in the position it would
[6:43] be in on the road back I was going to
[6:46] kill a silver tip grizzly
[6:49] bear and I went to this certain
[6:53] section and I spoke to the man and he
[6:56] said I don't know of any animal it looks
[6:59] like like that and as far as a grizzly
[7:01] bear I've never seen
[7:03] one I said but somewhere it's got to be
[7:10] here so he said we're not even going
[7:12] into be country we're going up for sheep
[7:17] way up above
[7:18] Timberline while I went with him in the
[7:21] second day out in the very spot exactly
[7:26] where the Lord said there laid the
[7:28] animal
[7:30] amen so when I went and got the animal
[7:34] and while we were uh taking the skin and
[7:37] the horns and so forth off he said I
[7:41] want to ask you
[7:43] something you told me 3 days ago when we
[7:47] left the the camp that after you had
[7:50] shot this certain Beast that on the road
[7:54] back you was going to kill a silver tip
[7:57] grizzly bear I said that's
[8:00] thus say the Lord hallelujah said I'm
[8:04] not
[8:05] doubting he said because my brother was
[8:08] an epileptic and you've never seen him
[8:09] in your life when he was up here one
[8:11] time and you told me that boy was going
[8:13] to be healed when I done a certain thing
[8:14] and he
[8:16] was he said now but brother brandom I
[8:19] want to ask you he said I can see all
[8:24] the way down that mountain to where the
[8:27] Timberline is them horses are
[8:30] understanding and there's nothing
[8:34] there there isn't a speck of grass there
[8:38] isn't a rock there isn't nothing Caribou
[8:42] Moss which is about 2 Ines high on above
[8:45] Timber lines for a mile or more above
[8:49] the Timberline said where is the bear
[8:51] going to
[8:54] be I said God is Jehovah gy hallah if
[9:00] he's told me there will be a bear there
[9:02] there'll be one there down the mountain
[9:05] about every time we get a half a mile or
[9:07] so closer he said brother brandom not
[9:10] time for that bear to
[9:12] appear I said don't worry he'll be here
[9:16] and when we were almost within about 500
[9:19] yards of where the horses was we had to
[9:21] rest again with the heavy horns and
[9:23] things on her back and he looked around
[9:25] again and I seen his face as he looked
[9:28] at me
[9:29] as if down in his heart he was wondering
[9:33] see he had hope it would be there but he
[9:36] didn't have the
[9:37] key but somehow amen by the grace of God
[9:43] he's never failed me when he told me
[9:47] there' be a silver tip there I had to
[9:51] key I didn't doubt it one bit not a bit
[9:56] I turned to him and I said bud
[10:00] it'll be there and just as I turned
[10:04] there was a
[10:06] there standing right above us about a
[10:10] half a mile he thr the glasses on he
[10:12] said Billy Soul help me it's a big
[10:14] Silver Tip amen see the
[10:17] key of vision the word of the Lord amen
[10:23] there's nothing can change it or stop it
[10:27] what the church needs tonight is not an
[10:28] educ
[10:30] what the church needs tonight is not a
[10:32] denomination what the church needs
[10:34] tonight is not a Creed what the church
[10:36] needs tonight is the key to the
[10:38] scriptures the door which Christ is the
[10:42] door and he is the
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] word faith in the word of the Living God
[10:49] unlocks every door yes amen God give us
[10:52] the
[10:53] key give us a
[10:56] key Hebrews the 12th chapter says seeing
[11:00] that we're compassed about with such a
[11:02] great cloud of witnesses let us lay
[11:05] aside every weight and the unbelief that
[11:09] does so easily beset us it says sin
[11:12] which sin is
[11:15] unbelief only one sin that's
[11:18] unbelief and sin means to miss the
[11:22] mark like you're shooting you miss the
[11:25] mark better adjust your gun see because
[11:29] there's something wrong you miss the art
[11:32] see come back and try over sin means to
[11:35] turn around you've missed the
[11:38] mark yeah when you want to be a
[11:40] Christian and you go join the church you
[11:43] miss the
[11:45] Mark when you want to be a Christian and
[11:48] you've been sprinkled in the name of the
[11:50] father son Holy Ghost you missed the
[11:51] mark but come
[11:54] back you'll not be on the target you'll
[11:57] scatter as sure as the world there's
[11:59] only one thing can hold you in perfect
[12:01] line that's the scripture the Bible the
[12:05] word for both heavens and earth will
[12:07] pass away but God's word will never pass
[12:10] away so hold the key faith in the
[12:15] word and every bit of faith that you
[12:19] believe and don't doubt One spec you can
[12:21] unlock every door that stands between
[12:23] you and the blessing that God has for
[12:25] you may God help us to have the keys is
[12:27] my prayer let's bow our heads now for
[12:30] our word of
[12:32] prayer our heavenly father we thank thee
[12:35] tonight that thou has give us a key to
[12:38] unlock to us
[12:42] salvation I I thank you for that Lord
[12:45] that we are saved and for the key that
[12:48] we have been able to use so far but God
[12:51] give us faith that every one of these
[12:55] words wrote in your book is little
[12:57] levers and this key called Jesus this
[13:01] door I mean called Jesus and the key
[13:03] called Faith touches every word it
[13:07] unlocks it it moves that little lever
[13:11] down and we can enter into that blessing
[13:14] Heavenly Father give to us the keys that
[13:18] we might be able to have faith in the
[13:20] promises of God that our faith might not
[13:23] fail that we might be able to be a
[13:25] service to you and to those who we
[13:27] associate with forgive every sin of our
[13:32] disbelieving Lord and help us to be
[13:35] thine we're coming now to the communion
[13:37] table now I pray heavenly father that
[13:40] you will forgive us of all of our
[13:42] trespasses that we might be able to
[13:44] enter into the joy of Fellowship around
[13:47] the table of God we ask it in Jesus name
[13:55] amen my brother
[13:57] sister if if you got the key to the
[14:01] kingdom the key to the door the key of
[14:05] Salvation God help
[14:08] you to open the doors and Let Jesus come
[14:11] in amen let him give to you the things
[14:14] that you so so desire
[14:17] now just a moment before we start to
[14:20] read on communion I want to say a thing
[14:23] because it's on communion and when we
[14:26] come to this altar there's only one way
[14:28] to come
[14:30] that is if we hold a key of faith in our
[14:32] hands it lets us know that our sins are
[14:35] forgiven and if we don't have that key
[14:38] to unlock that door that our sins are
[14:39] forgiven we have no business at the
[14:41] table of the Lord because he that eateth
[14:44] and drinketh unworthily eateth and
[14:46] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[14:48] Discerning the Lord's body now that is
[14:53] true I guess all of us know that today
[14:57] is the national Comm communion day this
[15:00] is the day that all churches take
[15:02] communion it's the national communion
[15:05] day over the nation and I thought that
[15:08] it would be appropriate to speak a word
[15:11] or two on communion before we tuck it
[15:14] while the pastor if you will be getting
[15:15] the scriptures ready for the reading of
[15:18] the the order of the Lord's table amen
[15:24] now this communion now I won't take but
[15:28] just about 10 minutes this communion
[15:31] that we're fixing to take has been the
[15:34] greatest dispute of any Doctrine in the
[15:38] Bible that was their one of their first
[15:41] disputes in the early
[15:43] church and today the Protestant of uh
[15:49] Episcopalian and Methodist and many
[15:52] other Protestant churches would gladly
[15:56] accept Catholic
[15:59] Roman Catholic Doctrine if they could
[16:01] get over the little hump of
[16:03] communion but they will agree that the
[16:06] priest should be married and be
[16:08] ministers the Catholic Church agreed on
[16:10] that several times in their conferences
[16:12] and meetings they agree on it and
[16:16] they'll agree upon different uh uh
[16:18] prayers and so forth the Protestant
[16:21] church will agree upon it and the cisms
[16:23] and so forth the little altar here and
[16:26] there and the Catholic church is willing
[16:28] to do it but but when it come to the
[16:31] communion there they fell now anybody
[16:33] that's ever read history knows
[16:36] that of course to my way of thinking
[16:39] they'd have a lot to get away from for I
[16:42] can accept it you see because it isn't
[16:43] Bible but I want you to say one thing to
[16:46] the Catholic church do you know the
[16:48] Catholic church in the beginning was the
[16:51] Apostolic Pentecostal
[16:53] Church certainly was it was the first
[16:56] beginning of the church and you see
[16:58] where they all they got to they kept
[17:01] taking away the word and injecting a
[17:04] dogma and if the Pentecostal church
[17:07] should exist another hundred years it
[17:10] would be farther off of the Bible than
[17:12] the Catholic church is today from the
[17:14] way it's going now it took the Catholic
[17:17] Church several hundred years to get away
[17:18] from it 300 years from the early church
[17:21] to the organizing of the Roman Catholic
[17:23] Church which they started out and they
[17:25] caught bringing in big dignitaries and
[17:27] things and they cut out this and put in
[17:29] this and taking out this and put up that
[17:31] and taking down Pagan idols and put up
[17:33] Christian statues and so forth and just
[17:36] compromising on that till they come to
[17:38] what they got now the Roman Catholic
[17:40] church and the Protestant Pentecostal
[17:44] Church from the the 50 years that it's
[17:47] been in existence and where it's fell
[17:49] from where it started it'll be a worse
[17:51] shape in the Catholic Church than 100
[17:53] years from now that's
[17:56] right that's a big word to say but just
[17:58] look where theyve fallen from they went
[18:01] right into organization they went right
[18:02] in compromising on this and that and
[18:04] everything else and there they go see
[18:06] going right back but
[18:09] communion is called the Lord's
[18:12] supper now a lot of people they want to
[18:15] take it in the morning didn't say in the
[18:17] Bible it was his
[18:18] breakfast and how these people today how
[18:21] they can still say Lord supper and they
[18:23] don't they've cut out supper and omitted
[18:25] it and called it
[18:27] dinner nonsense
[18:32] supper
[18:34] now always a dispute in the Bible
[18:37] times it was a dispute then the people
[18:41] misunderstood the Lord's Supper when
[18:44] they come to the table Paul told those
[18:46] Corinthians they were coming and getting
[18:48] drunk at the Lord's
[18:50] table see it was misunderstood right
[18:52] then he said if you want to eat eat at
[18:55] home and another thing he was misund
[18:58] understood what it was h a Sinners and
[19:02] man living in sin come and Tuck the
[19:05] communion that was misunderstood a man
[19:08] living with his mother Foster mother and
[19:11] the church had told him about it still
[19:13] taking communion at the table and there
[19:15] were divisions among them and they were
[19:17] still taking communion he said I
[19:20] understand you walk like the rest of
[19:21] Gentiles and there's there's conviction
[19:23] among you like there is at at uh
[19:25] especially in sas's house and so forth
[19:28] said you walk like the rest of the
[19:29] Gentiles see it was misunderstood the
[19:33] communion has always been misunderstood
[19:35] now I could go on for that for hours but
[19:38] we got to get this communion and the
[19:40] feet washing now they've simply omitted
[19:43] feet washing allog together just a few
[19:44] of the denominations a lot of the
[19:46] Pentecostals has got completely away
[19:47] from it see and it's still in the Bible
[19:50] just the way it was wrote see now Rome
[19:55] does not call it communion they call it
[20:00] Mass it's a Holy Mass they don't take
[20:03] communion they take a mass it's a
[20:06] mass and a
[20:08] mass certainly takes the real meaning
[20:12] from
[20:15] communion a mass means
[20:20] hoping they take a mass hoping that in
[20:25] doing this in the mass that God will for
[20:28] forgive them of their sins by taking the
[20:32] literal Body of Christ which the priest
[20:35] turns from to the body and the blood of
[20:38] Christ taking that hoping that God will
[20:41] omit their sins by doing so it's a
[20:46] mass the Protestants call
[20:48] it
[20:50] communion communion means
[20:54] Thanksgiving that the Protestant the
[20:57] Catholic is taking a mass in the mass
[21:02] hoping that God forgives them are there
[21:06] evil doing the Protestant takes it with
[21:10] Thanksgiving for what's already done
[21:13] with a communion with God communing with
[21:16] him that it's already
[21:18] done the Catholic is hoping it's done
[21:22] the Protestant says it's already done
[21:25] the Catholic is wondering if his sins is
[21:28] Forgiven the Protestant is confessing
[21:30] that they are forgiven amen that he is
[21:33] free and a communion is communing with
[21:37] God and these articles that we take not
[21:41] in hopes that our sins are forgiven but
[21:44] they are forgiven because it's one is
[21:47] Hope and the other is Faith one's hoping
[21:50] he's right and the other knows he's
[21:54] right the other wants hoping because he
[21:57] don't know where he stands the other
[21:59] knows he's right because he knows what
[22:01] God Said Amen that's it that's the
[22:05] difference so when you're just
[22:08] hoping be careful but when you know then
[22:13] go on see then you're in communion with
[22:17] God Protestant
[22:21] is he says he's
[22:24] forgiven and he knows it the Catholic
[22:27] has mass hope hopes that he'll be
[22:30] forgiven it's just like
[22:32] this one is a
[22:36] beggar hoping that everything's all
[22:40] right see the other is a beggar thanking
[22:45] for what's already been
[22:47] done they're both Beggars but one's
[22:50] begging hoping he'll get it the other
[22:53] beggar knows he's got it and thank him
[22:54] for giving it to him now there's the
[22:56] difference that's community amen yes sir
[22:59] one is uh hoping that he's forgiven the
[23:03] other knows he's forgiven and giv thanks
[23:04] for it so communion is for
[23:09] Christians that's born again of the
[23:12] spirit of
[23:13] God and Born Again does not necessarily
[23:17] mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now
[23:19] remember now many teach that I don't
[23:22] know anybody teaches it like this old
[23:26] brother argb said that night to the pool
[23:28] years see but New Birth is not the
[23:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture
[23:34] doesn't support it I don't think see the
[23:36] my way of seeing it
[23:38] see I believe that you're born again and
[23:42] that's reason I do use the word baptism
[23:45] in the name of Jesus Christ but not to
[23:50] Regeneration now the Pentecostal and
[23:52] United Pentecostal Church baptizes in
[23:55] the name of Jesus Christ for a
[23:56] regeneration I don't believe that that
[23:59] they can do it if they want to but I
[24:01] believe Peter said repent
[24:05] first water don't remit sins the Church
[24:07] of Christ preaches it that way but I
[24:10] believe that
[24:13] repentance Godly sorrow repent means
[24:16] turn
[24:17] around go back you miss some Mar start
[24:21] over again do that
[24:23] first and your baptism in water is only
[24:26] an outward profession
[24:29] of something that's been done inside of
[24:31] you that you have accepted Christ as
[24:33] your
[24:36] savior I guess it's just a church here
[24:38] tonight as far as I know I'm not here
[24:40] enough to know who does come or not I
[24:42] got a little criticism here not long ago
[24:44] on baptizing a man here in the pool an
[24:47] old fell and I went to him as good old
[24:50] man I had the privilege of leading all
[24:52] his family to Christ all of them
[24:55] Christians this old man was a nice old
[24:57] man and I like
[24:59] so I went to him and I said to him Papa
[25:03] why don't you become a
[25:05] Christian he's loves me he said brother
[25:09] brandom I would become a Christian when
[25:11] I can get good
[25:13] enough I said tell you what you do Papa
[25:16] you look all around and you find where
[25:17] you can get good enough then tell me
[25:19] where that place is I want to go
[25:21] to
[25:23] amen I said Christ never come to save
[25:26] good man he come to to save bad man amen
[25:30] when you think you're good then he
[25:31] didn't come to save you he come to save
[25:33] them he knows they're
[25:35] bad Christ died to save
[25:39] Sinners and I said papa there's a line
[25:43] right here he said well I smoke these
[25:44] cigarettes I said I ain't going to even
[25:45] talk about them he said I'll try to give
[25:48] them up brother Bram I said I we ain't
[25:49] going to talk about cigarettes he said
[25:52] well when I can I said don't don't say
[25:53] no more about him let him go I want to
[25:55] ask you a question he said right what is
[25:58] it I said Do you believe there is a God
[26:01] said certainly I believe it said I
[26:04] believe that as strong as you do gu
[26:05] brother brandham I said do you believe
[26:07] that that same God crossed this stream
[26:11] and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in
[26:13] the person of Jesus Christ in order to
[26:15] save man he said yes I believe that and
[26:19] he died to save Sinners Like You are
[26:23] like I am yes I believe that I said now
[26:27] it's just like this we're all in one big
