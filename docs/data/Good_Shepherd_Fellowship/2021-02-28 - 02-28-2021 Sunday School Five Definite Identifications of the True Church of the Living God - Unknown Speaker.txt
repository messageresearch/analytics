TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] up the holy spirit of God where by your sealed until the day of your Redemption amen famous Baptist preacher said to me not long ago said brother Bram Abraham believed God it was imputed un him for righteousness what more could he do but believe God he said we believe we receive the Holy Ghost when we believe I said but you're wrong you're honestly wrong Paul said in Acts 19 to those Baptist who had a good pastor up there a converted lawyer have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed he said the original doesn't say that I said it does say that I've got the emphatic dagn and it does say it in every translation both Greek and Hebrew he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe I said Abraham believed that was true but God gave him a sign that he had accepted his faith by giving the Seal of circumcision that right he' accepted him because he give him a sign that he'd accept him if you say you believe and haven't received the Holy Ghost yet God hasn't sealed you yet hasn't had enough trust to trust you yet when you come to God God seals you with the Holy Ghost till the day of your Redemption amen that's a message of the church amen just a little f all right now 1 Corinthians 12: 13 by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body acts here's the way we enter it here's the inauguration of the church acts the 2 chapter when the first message was preached to the church after the day of Pentecost sir they were all filled with the Holy Ghost Mary all the apostles were all filled with the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and just carrying on like a bunch of uh uh drunk people amen and when they were just having an awful time just shouting and praising God and staggering around the impact of the Holy Ghost they don't care what it's Sunday Monday what day it was they having them a big time just shouting and going on while the the great intellectual people said these people are drunk on new wine now here stands Peter with the Keys of the Kingdom on his side the keys to the Holy Ghost Jesus said I say thou art Peter Upon This Rock of build a church in the Gates of Hell shall I Prevail against it what is it a spiritual revealed truth flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned this in a seminary amen somebody didn't teach it to you out of books but it's a revelation Hallelujah Revelation I say that you're a Peter I give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose it in heaven amen he has to keep word am on the day of Pentecost who was the spokesman Peter CU he had the keys and they were laughing at said these men are full of new wine Peter said this being the third hour of the day these are not full of new wine but this is that which is spoke of by Joel The Prophet it'll come to pass in the last day sayith God I'll pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy upon my hands maid maid servant I pour out of my spirit your young man shall see Visions your old man will dream dreams and it'll show signs in the heaven above and in the earth below it shall come to pass that whosoever call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest Apostles man and Brethren what can we do to be saved here's the commission of the church amen now they want to find out how he get into this mystical body all right acts the 2 chapter begin at the 37th verse the inauguration sermon you can't can't change it that's right amen you can't change it praise the Lord listen if your doctor wrote you a prescription and you tuck it down to the drugstore to some quack drug this you know he could kill you with that prescription you see that doctor writes so much in that because he's trained to that and he writes you so much poison and he puts an antidote in there to kill so much of that poison he has to upset something to upset the other drug and if that prescription isn't filled just exactly the way that doctor writes it it'll kill you amen and that God is the doctor he's a doctor of the Soul he's a doctor of Salvation yes and he educated the man in his own theology Peter an unlearned man that couldn't even read his name when he wrote before him but he give him the Holy Spirit and give him the pencil to write the doctrine about so on the day of Pentecost he wrot wrot the prescription Hallelujah let's see what he wrote Dr Simon Peter let's see what your prescription is for Salvation let's see what it was wrote out for now when they heard this they were picked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles man and Brethren what can we do watch out you got the keys then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises un to you and to your children of them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call praise the Lord amen that's a prescription don't doctor it up you'll kill your patient amen that's what matter all these people talking is Father Son and Holy Ghost they're killing a lot of spiritual people amen doctor with the wrong thing there's no such a thing nobody ever baptized the name of father son Holy Ghost praise the Lord never was such a ceremony ever said to the Catholic Church the Catholic church is the mother of that that's right search the scriptures search the history and find out the first order was ever done by father Son and Holy Ghost of the Catholic priest they Franklin Franklin was ordained by the Catholic church right God mother of harlots come right back down to the Harlot it says in the catechism is there such a thing as a Protestant ever being saved said sometimes of course because they admit the the Catholic Doctrine they won't take their Bible they baptized name of father son Holy Ghost and they had no scripture for that said but the Catholic Church started and they admitted by the Catholic orders they might be some saved no such a thing nobody ever baptized that way nobody ever sprinkled in the Bible poured or any other way but immersing in the water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin what did we read a while ago and I told you to get to it later that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name Amen to where just to Jerusalem to the Jews to All Nations all the world beginning at Jerusalem amen not Dr Simon Peter wrote out the prescription what about you doctors amen why you trying to put something with it don't add nothing to it take it the way it is that's the commission of the church amen that's how you get into it by repenting and being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and a promise that you will receive the holy ghost now that's what the Bible said baptize them to the church baptize them to the church let's read Galatians 3:26 just a minute you a got but just one two more three more things here and then we we have to close now let's read over here in Galatians the 3 chapter if anybody gets it before I do read it go ahead are all the children of God fa in Christ Jesus Galatians 3:26 maybe I might wrote wrong here then I might be Colossians let's read Colossians I where I was going to let's see if it's Colossians 3:26 no there is no 3:26 what is that now Galatians 3:26 here here I got it I tried read on sister Galatians 326 minut you started here it is 26 27 28 now listen closed are all in how do we get into this body how are we done it B ized by the holy spirit amen into the body of Christ Jesus now another thing the church's message is how we get into the church is through sanctification and sanctification Hebrews 13:12 and 13 Jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify the people with his own blood now Ephesians let's go here we got to read that one Ephesians 5:25 right quick now Ephesians 5 and 25 all right here we are five and 25 ah I still got the wrong thing I haven't got it roll down here right uh let's see therefore preachers and priest oh yeah I was writing this down real quick a while ago so I must have hit the wrong oh I got the wrong page amen yes yes all right Hebrews 12: 13 Jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify the people with his own blood therefore people that here's how we come to the church by repenting being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins and a promise that we will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost therefore there is no preacher can shake us into it there's no priest that can vow us into it but we are bned into it by the king of the Messianic Kingdom amen now just this can I get this one more here's wheree how many of you stay with me just a few minutes long just a it's 9:30 in past time now can we get to heaven without the church just take a couple of comments on this because I got about a dozen wrote down here as you see but I I just one thing that we might know no sir you cannot get to heaven without being a member of this church now first thing in John 3 and 5 Jesus said except the man be borned of water and of spirit repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall then be born of the spirit born of the water born of the spirit except the man gets this he cannot even enter the kingdom of heaven right he cannot even see the kingdom of heaven then if you are born of water and spirit you are in the church if you're not borned of water and spirit you're not in the church and cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven is that make sense to you it's just exactly right now did you know you say well brother brandom I believe well listen and I've never received the Holy Ghost no you don't believe yet you are just believing unto believe you have hope for in First Corinthians the 12th chapter and the 3D verse let's just take grab that right quick while we're close to it if you want to 1 Corinthians 12 the 12th chapter and the third verse and we'll get that just right quick and and read this year and see what the Lord has in his Parts 1 Corinthians 12 all right and the third verse wherefore I give you to understand amen that no man speaketh by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse and no man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost praise the Lord thank you you don't know nothing about it that's right until you've received the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you say I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe if you don't you can't even call him the Lord right because he's not Lord he's a historical being that you by Faith have accepted but when he's come into you by the Holy Ghost he is your lord no man can call Jesus Lord only by the Holy Ghost that's right until you are born of the spirit of God and the Holy Ghost is in you then if you are you're borned into this Kingdom and you're part of the church you're the called out ones a you see it all right now can Life come out of a k except that corn have life in it if a grain of corn is put in the ground one is gerti and the other is not gerti the one that's not gerti can it live again not by no means there's nothing in it allthough materially it'll make just as good just as good a corn flakes as the other will it'll make just as good a corn bread as the other and will it'll look just as good on the Shelf as the other and will but if it hasn't got life into it it cannot Rise Again amen a man that's a good man can be just as good church member as a Christian a man that's a good man can be just as good a citizen as a Christian a good man moral man but when he dies that's it right unless he's born again of the spirit of God because everything that had a beginning has an end amen God is the only thing that's Eternal therefore we are are a part of God by receiving his life Jesus said I give unto them eternal life the Greek word there is Zoe means God's own life and the only way that you can ever live again is to have eternal life which is God's life because your life will perish but his life will be raised up again because God is eternal and you've got eternal life and can more die than God can die uh he that believeth on me has eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last days amen raise him up again the eternal life it's anym raise him up yes now can we get into heaven without being the church you can't be in the church until you're borned again you can't go to Heaven until you're born again if you're born again you're in the church amen so you can't go to Heaven until you're a member of this church and you can't be a member until you're borned into it amen and now let me smother you and you can't be a member unless God has called you to be a [Music] member now how happy you to be for that for you were predestinated amen before the foundation of the world and your name your names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life the church book before the foundation of the world Hallelujah that's the Bible Hallelujah the Bible said the Antichrist the organizations the Catholic church with the rest of the organizations organizations will deceive all upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come to me that's his own words Hallelujah not what you done but what he done amen let's settle that a minute let's turn to Ephesians the first chapter quick Hall praise the Lord listen to this this is Paul now he had to go on to Perfection with this church Paul's addressing this to Christians how many Christians is in here let's see your hand all right this is not for babies now this is this is those who can eat meat now the first chapter watch who he addresses Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God not by the ordination of the bishop not by the organization an apostle one that's sent by the will of God Amen to the Saints that's the Sanctified ones or Saed ones which are Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus who is he address it to to those that's already in the church when you're in Christ you're in his body is that right then you're members of the church Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus am how did he do it what did he do it they had reached Jordan they crossed into the Promised Land and they were setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen here it is blessed us together with Heavenly blessings the teaching of the word as the church the called out ones that's in Christ Jesus as we're sitting together in Heavenly places like the church when we were born in Christ Jesus the saint had called out ones oh my thank you Jesus somebody can teach something to had some much trouble with the Corinthians but not this church he can teach them great things all right blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all you remember my last two messages all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according listen let this shock you now according as he he ha past tense chosen Us in him at the last Revival did I read that right according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world before the world look here before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love amen having p r e d e s t i n a t e d what did we do nothing what he done is what I'm looking at what did he do chose us put our names on his book on his church book to be a member of this mystical body before the world ever begin God thank you Jesus and has predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his own good pleasure of his will Lord thank you Jesus you got to be in that church brother if you make it that's right for he's coming for a church amen a what kind of a church a church that's without spot or without wrinkles how can we be that by being dead in Christ baptized by the Holy Ghost into his mystical body and a blood atonement of the Son of God laying there far as every hour of the day thank you Jesus found blameless Hallelujah that's a church without spot or without wrinkles he chose us in him and put our names on his book The Bible said that Jesus Christ was the lamb slain 1900 years ago how far the lamb slay from the foundation of the world when God in the Bible the word in Genesis Genesis 1 said in the beginning God take that name God in the Hebrew and see what it means it's spelled l El Elohim which means the all self-existing one the alls sufficient one the strong one there was nothing before that there was no air there was no stars there was no moisture there was no there was no atmosphere there was no atoms there was no molecules there was nothing before that it was God the Eternal one and in him were attributes to be a savior to be a father to be God there he wasn't God then he was he was God but there was nothing else no worship so God is an object of worship and there's nothing to worship him so there was add rutes in him to be that to be a savior to be a Healer to be all these things that he is so the first thing he created now some of you want to know about my Genesis story God said let us make man the first thing he created was angels e e e so the first thing he created now some of you want to know about my Genesis story God said let us make man the first thing he created was angels to worship him then he become God then when he said let us make man after our own image what kind of man did he make spirit man then when he made that man he gave him control then he made Man Out of the Dust of the earth then he fell then he become a savior a god than a savior sin brought on sickness then he become a Healer Hallelujah there ain't nothing going wrong he know all about it before the world was ever formed he knew we'd have this meeting tonight he know every Knack would ever be on the earth and how much Tower he' make and how many times it B his eyes he's the infinite God knows all things thanes amen aren't you glad tonight that your name is on the book hallelujah what a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning a Great Speckled Bird praise the Lord and they say that her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word than all the other birds flocking around her she's despised by all of them what was that speckle bird I'm different with the guy that said that was wrong what was the speckle bird of the Bible it was not Israel as they said it was it was the Church of Jesus Christ amen for a sin offering what did they do they took a turtle dove pulled a head off for one and turned it upside down and poured the blood upon the living mate and turned the mate loose and the mate sprinkled it with the blood of the Dead mate went across the Earth sprinkling as he flew his wings and the blood splashing upon the Earth cried holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord it was a type of Christ and The Great Speckled Bird is the church that's been specked by the blood of its dead mate the Savior Jesus Christ and she's crossing the world today flopping her wings crying holy holy holy unto the Lord hallelujah amen I'm so glad that I know ever I'm so glad my name is on her book put there not but my goodness no shall that never be there are by your goodness but by the goodness and mercies of God before the foundation of the world put our names on his book hallelujah what is the identification of the church what is she to be what was she what is it the called out group who set it up Jesus Christ not a bishop not the Catholic church not Methodist not Luther not Wesley no sir who set it up Jesus Christ what is its message repentance water baptism baptism of Holy Ghost div div healing salvation how do we become a member of it by being borned into it can we get to heaven without it no sir for those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him and not all not anyone else but those who are dead in Christ Jesus is coming for those that are dead in Christ amen Ephesians four chapter said that the or Galatians I believe it is the fourth chapter said that those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him those that are dead in Christ will God brings with him now therefore she is a called out group a mystical body Christ said it in order before he died he spoke of it coming he said I will come and be king over this domain a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you shall see me you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world that's the reason they're in such a confusion called Babylon one with bless God I'm Presbyterian bless God I'm Methodist bless God I'm bless God I'm a Christian amen that's it how do I know I am these signs follow the believer that's right there's your identification card amen not say wait a minute I believe I got my fellowship card no I ain't got any mine's up there I might lose this one down here but he told me before the world begin he' gave me my identification card to everyone that's come into the kingdom it's kept in heaven so the records are straight Hallelujah I'm so glad I somebody said I sought God I sought God that's contrary to the Bible is God seeking you not you seeking God God went up down the Garden of Eden crying Adam Where Art Thou not Adam crying God Where Art Thou it was God crying Adam Where Art Thou oh I'm so glad I'm a member of her aren't you amen I'm so glad of this great church I'm sorry to kept you so late but do you believe in this great church do you believe in it do you believe it's a mystical body now you Catholic people the only thing you have to do to be a member of it is to accept Jesus Christ and be born of the spirit you Baptist you Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever you are listen here don't think I'm taking up for the Pentecostals there's just as much Pentecostal Renegades as there is any other church that's exactly right they come in only by name and profession that's all but possession they don't have it that's right because when you're born of the spirit you become a new creature and God begins to deal with you then his sons and you're are LED of the spirit of God no matter what organization you belong to that Ain just a little worldly orders go to pass away but are you a member of this great mystical Body of Christ if not may you receive him tonight as we bow our heads just a moment for

these things as you said would follow the believer I haven't received that as yet Lord and you said that signs shall shall means you will give me power Lord God bless you God bless you and you and you
