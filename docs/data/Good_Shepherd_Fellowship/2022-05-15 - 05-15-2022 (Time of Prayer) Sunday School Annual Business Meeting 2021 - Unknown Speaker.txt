[Music] so so [Music] so [Music] [Music] morning saints we're gonna have our annual business meeting so for those of you that knew we it's a little loud what's what we're doing right now uh let's just uh let's just pray though before we get started heavenly father we thank you lord for this day and just ask father that you or even through this business meeting father just lord just help us father just to ascertain your will and and all that we do father we just thank you we praise you we ask this in jesus name amen okay um let's see how do we get started with the powerpoint okay what this this year is um i've condensed it considerably and the reason is because we have very limited time uh as opposed to times in the past so we're going to cover five things i'm going to cover the general account the missions account the building fund account the tithe and offering box and we'll talk about that unfortunately we do this we're doing this during sunday school and there's only nobody here and the and everyone that needs to hear it are the ones that aren't here so i don't know hopefully they'll show up before i talk about tithe and offering box and then uh we have a vote also on the change to the bylaws so there's going to be a change that that we've needed actually it was like a year ago we had talked about this and just hadn't happened okay the general account did everybody see that okay all right we had we started with the beginning balance of sixteen thousand four hundred fifty nine dollars and seventy cents um and then our our income for the year was twenty thousand nine hundred fifty two dollars and nine cents now this is the general account so in offerings we had the offerings of twenty thousand seven fifteen ninety nine i don't know why i'm looking back there actually i printed all this out so i didn't have to do that um and then the uh we had other i have no idea what the other is for you know we have a contribution envelope and on the contribution it's a generic envelope that we buy at the bookstore and it's got a lot of um categories one of the categories is other well we had 67 somebody gave for other i have no idea what the others supposed to be so but it was other so we had 767 another and then youth ministry of 170 so our total again 20 950.99 our expense was 17 376 dollars and 33 cents now amazon is our what i would call our primary vendor that's kind of a new thing for us we used to never spend money with amazon but once we went um what we call it we start streaming where you know we could people could see the services live on the internet um and using the internet for you know for our website and things amazon became a real source of things that we needed so they've basically become our primary vendor and so we spent 4811.79 last year with amazon which to me was a lot of money we had condolence of cents and that was actually for it was two people um brother don furon part of that was when we went down for brother uh brother scott went down there and uh then also there was um there was one for [Music] i can't remember who it was i think it was what's that no no it wasn't it was um i can't remember anyway it was uh it was a card that we sent to someone and then anyway the easy tithe uh fees easy tithe is where people that give money online it goes through a company called easy tithe or through an application as well as company business application and so our fees for them was one thousand ninety dollars and thirty eight cents now those fees were all the fees for everything they gave so that was tied that was offering that's everything and when people give their money they have the option to to cover the expense they have the option to it's a it's called a convenience fee and they can give i think it's that we it's a two percent charge but in reality there's actually two char there's either if you give if you use the bank to pay it's a one percent charge if you use your credit card is a three percent charge so we just split the difference it's like we just charge you by two percent now to those who give the money it actually goes back to them as a contribution so even though they're giving that money to offset the cost it still goes back to the person who gave it as a contribution to the church so it goes back as an offering and so the the 1090 was was most of that was covered it was like 900 of it was covered by the by what people gave then we had grounds maintenance of 660 now i might mention with the amazon there's there's a lot in the in the amazon and so there's some grounds maintenance in there there's some janitorial in there there it's mostly though most of it i say there's ground main and not really probably any grounds maintenance maybe like it would be building uh maintenance and things but most of that with the amazon was uh computers it was uh enter the expense of the internet and things like that not the internet actual or the the service charge of internet but the the all the pieces that have to be put in place for everything that we do uh hospitality we had forty eight dollars and thirty thirty six cents our insurance last year was three thousand nine hundred one dollars and thirty four cents it went up about 700 last year which is yeah i mean it's it was about went up about 20 percent and that's you know for insurance that's pretty typical our janitorial was 513.8 cents our medical supplies i just lost sound our medical supplies i got it back thank you our medical supplies now i was like well okay what are our why do we have medical supplies well we we actually bought a first aid kit and some band-aids and that was 80 and 13 cents we spent with for medical supplies i think we got some masks in the included in that too because we've provided mass for a long time a music ministry of 20.21 office supplies of 55.25 we had a table rental and that was for the uh what was that uh the couple's banquet at uh at the carlins there was a table rental 53.75 cents we had utilities our utilities went up ah last year was like i think it was i believe it's like 5200 last year something like that so our utilities did go up but our utilities include gas water trash gas water trash our internet service and seems like there's one more pardon me i'm sorry electric i didn't say electric yeah electric sorry so yeah uh and then youth ministry where youth ministry expense of thirty dollars and eight cents so our total again our total expense is 17 376.33 so we ended up with a net income of and 3576.66 cents and our ending balance for the year for the general account is twenty thousand thirty six dollars and thirty six cents so anyway but i was going to mention is if anybody has any questions just talk to me after the service i can give you all the detail any detail you want but so if you have any questions um the next thing that we want to talk about i got a point this way we're going to talk about the um the missions account our beginning balance was 1 920 and 65 cents we had income of two thousand five hundred fifty dollars of that income [Music] um 365 dollars came from individuals and then two thousand one hundred eighty five dollars came from the tithe so there's a portion of tithe that always goes that uh brother one always wants to give to missions and so we had like i said we had an income of 2 550 our expense uh we had expenses one thousand six hundred eighty dollars that was sixteen hundred dollars that we sent to tanzania and then there was an eighty dollar for a transfer fee actually there were two transfers each one was forty dollars so that's all right so that's our expense so we had a net income of 870 dollars so we ended up with an indian balance of 2798.65 then our building fund account we had a big beginning balance of 1780.57 our income total was for 405 dollars and 20 cents we had um individual contributions of 405 we had interest of 20 cents interest isn't anything like it used to be i mean years ago you'd get three four five percent now you might get 0.3.4 or 0.03 i don't know it's just it's almost nothing but anyway our net net income i mean that's our expenses we had zero expenses basically we haven't used the building fund we we started it a few years back and there haven't been many contributors to it and so our ending balance is 2185.77 and as you all know we we are at a point where we will soon need a building it doesn't look like it right now [Music] and you look you look at it right now it's like well we don't need a building but hey we fill up i mean when the service starts you know there aren't many people here for sunday school but when the regular service starts with so it gets pretty full i know last sunday of course it was mother's day with mother's day they were they have to set up chairs in the back in the four-year area yeah you know additional seating so we are we're we're going to be running out of room or we are running out of room okay i wanted to talk about that the tithe and offering box i'm sorry the um the tithe and offering box now everyone knows except our visitors god bless you for coming what's your names joey omega omega okay welcome so anyway um right behind joe is our tithe and offering box and um so i just wanted i want to explain this about the tithe offering box because i want to make sure everybody understands how i perceive the money that's put in there if you put loose cash in the tithing offering box it's considered a general offering so if you just throw cash in there it's an offering if you put cash in an unmarked envelope in other words you don't mark anything on that envelope and you stick the money in there and you put that in the in the tithe and offering box it's considered an offering anything that's anonymous unmarked is an offering if you put cash in a contribution envelope and you put your name on it and you don't mark anything on that envelope i will come and talk to you so if i have your name i will find you and i will find out where that money was supposed to go so that's how i do it just so everybody knows of course we don't have everybody here so maybe they'll watch it they'll watch the this is being recorded there you go so they'll be able to watch it if they want to you know what the the business meeting is not really popular i mean it's just you're talking numbers and stuff and [Music] it's not like people are really interested in being here and going through numbers there's only a few people like numbers okay so the last thing i believe is the last thing we want to talk about is a change to the bylaws so before we start we're going to vote on this i realize we don't have many people but we're going to vote anyway and just but so everybody knows so you'll know joe and omega we're not trying to leave you out but you have to be a voting member to vote and to be a voting member according to our bylaws you have to pay ties and get offerings you have to have regular attendance and you have to have been doing that for at least a year to vote so just so you know for everybody that's here anyway in the by-laws article article eight officers third paragraphs first and only sentence of that article currently reads the salary of the pastor shall be determined year by year at the annual meeting this is the annual meeting and so we're going to change that because last year i i and i did it i did it intentionally last year i brought this up last year to change brother one's salary and i did it intentionally because by our bylaws that's when we're supposed to do it and obviously that's not what it should be so what i would like to do is have it amended to read the salary of the pastor shall be determined year by year at the annual trustee meeting so that's a so basically all we're doing is we stuck one word in there trustee and that's what we're trying to change is it's rather being something done at the annual congregational meeting it's at the annual trustee meeting because it's really the it's between the the pastor the treasurer and the trustees and and all the traffic and the pastor and treasurer and trustees are supposed to be at the trustee meeting so that's when we will do that so we need to vote on that so and i don't think we need to be secret about it unless somebody thinks we need to be secret about it is anybody is anybody opposed to changing the bylaws okay has anybody in anybody agree with changing the pylons raise your hand okay all right well we got it all right and that's it how did i do for time this was a test because normally in the past i would take an hour to an hour and a half and we would get into the detail i i used to love getting into the detail but that's changed i'm not into the detail as much i don't i don't love getting into the doing the reports and everything and like i used to so i guess i'm getting old no i'm not i'm vintage sorry but you know i was gonna i was gonna mention but i i in case in case uh someone is watching this online you know we have we have a sister in our church that my wife and i uh have it's like she's like a a daughter to us and um and today happens to be her birthday so i just wanted to wish sister keish a happy birthday thank you you
