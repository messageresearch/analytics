[11:52] reverse it this time we will read the

[12:04] in most places
[12:06] that i know of the dude the preaching
[12:09] before the prayer meeting i love to do
[12:11] the prayer meeting before preaching but
[12:14] we would just we would just
[12:16] change it a little bit so let's just
[12:18] stand on our feet and
[12:22] and then we will be able to share with
[12:24] you
[12:25] what uh
[12:27] praise the lord
[12:29] let's go uh over to see matthew
[12:33] uh
[12:35] let's go
[12:36] to
[12:38] see matthew
[12:46] that's what jesus said upon this rock i
[12:49] will build my church
[12:50] and the gifts of hell shall not prevent
[12:53] against it that's matthew chapter 16.
[12:55] it's a very familiar
[12:58] uh
[12:58] familiar
[13:01] scripture
[13:02] for us
[13:04] familiar chapter familiar verse in the
[13:07] bible
[13:09] so uh
[13:11] uh
[13:16] let's read from verse 13 just for a
[13:18] scripture reading tonight
[13:21] when jesus came into the coast of
[13:23] caesarea philippa
[13:25] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[13:28] men say that i the son of man am
[13:32] and they said some say that thou are
[13:35] john the baptist
[13:36] some elias and uh and others jeremiah
[13:41] and one of the prophets
[13:43] he said unto them
[13:45] but whom say ye that i am
[13:49] and some of peter answered and said
[13:52] thou are the christ
[13:54] the son of the living god
[13:58] and jesus answered and said unto him
[14:01] blessed are thou simon by jonah
[14:04] for flesh and blood have not revealed
[14:08] it unto thee but my father
[14:11] which is in heaven
[14:13] and i said also unto thee
[14:17] that thou
[14:18] i peeded
[14:20] and upon this rock i will build my
[14:23] church
[14:24] and the gifts of hell
[14:26] shall not prevail against it
[14:30] praise the lord
[14:32] we believe that the gif gifts of hell
[14:34] will not prevent against it because god
[14:36] says so amen
[14:39] let's bow our hearts together
[14:41] let's just pray and that the law would
[14:43] just add blessing upon this word
[14:46] uh for us tonight we know the word is
[14:48] already inspired the word is blessed but
[14:51] we need a portion for us tonight that
[14:54] law as we uh uh
[14:56] following the service from different
[14:59] parts of our home tonight we just want
[15:01] to ask god's special blessing that he
[15:03] would just anoint the world and
[15:06] he will speak to our hearts he will be
[15:08] able to draw us close to him tonight
[15:11] let's pray together in jesus name

[16:27] amen
[16:29] amen praise the lord the lord bless you
[16:32] amen
[16:34] amen you may have your seat
[16:42] so this is just pretty much uh
[16:45] a little kind of a bible studies tonight
[16:48] but remember we were we we started to
[16:50] speak on uh
[16:52] a subject
[16:54] we uh
[16:56] entitled
[16:57] uh
[17:00] divine healing is only a bit so we will
[17:02] go back to that note that's where we uh
[17:05] uh we'll be referring much back to
[17:08] uh what we spoke on a little bit
[17:12] i realized that
[17:14] i promised i was going to finish early
[17:16] on sunday and i went late
[17:19] still never get right yet
[17:22] and
[17:24] i went late but yet i did not finish
[17:26] everything that i wanted to talk about
[17:29] but i will approach the subject a little
[17:31] bit different
[17:32] and we will we will go over some few
[17:35] things
[17:36] that we shared
[17:38] on
[17:39] on sunday
[17:41] and
[17:42] the thought the drive
[17:44] the inspiration
[17:46] behind this thought is is all about
[17:49] growth it's all about maturity the way
[17:53] we
[17:55] are understanding things the way we are
[17:57] dealing with things especially in the
[18:00] time that we are living in net
[18:02] net as kovac time the time that we are
[18:06] living in for the bride is rapturing
[18:09] time amen
[18:10] so especially in this time that we are
[18:12] living in uh the way we deal with things
[18:16] you know is very very important it
[18:20] speaks of our growth
[18:22] it speaks of our growth i would first
[18:24] want to start
[18:26] and uh uh by picking up this now you
[18:29] have to realize that we read a lot of
[18:33] scriptures
[18:34] uh
[18:36] uh on sunday
[18:38] and we read from sin john chapter six
[18:40] verse 44 45 and we know jesus says all
[18:44] that the father has given me will come
[18:47] and we also learn from the scripture
[18:49] that
[18:50] he promised to draw us by teaching
[18:54] teaching is the way that he draws us
[18:57] he gets our attention and he draws
[19:00] slowly by teaching
[19:02] but before then we read from the prophet
[19:05] isaiah where he talks about you know all
[19:08] of god's children will be taught by him
[19:10] the isaiah 54
[19:12] isaiah 28 he also talks about uh
[19:17] what peter referred to
[19:20] as uh
[19:23] babies that are stayed on the sincere
[19:26] milk of the word
[19:29] but there is a place here i think it's
[19:32] in hebrew chapter five we read that
[19:34] let's let's go back there
[19:37] is in hebrew chapter 5 i believe so
[19:47] hebrew chapter 5
[19:50] verse 12.
[19:58] for for when for the time ye are to be
[20:02] teachers
[20:03] you have need
[20:05] that won't teach you again
[20:08] which
[20:11] be the first principle of the oracle of
[20:14] god we underline their teaching is the
[20:16] first principle of the oracle of god and
[20:20] i become such
[20:22] as have need of milk
[20:26] and not of strong meat i want to take
[20:29] milk and strong meat tonight
[20:32] to show that the four living creatures
[20:36] that was represented before the throne
[20:41] the
[20:42] the lion
[20:44] the ox
[20:45] the man
[20:46] and the ego
[20:48] at their birth
[20:51] there is three of those living creatures
[20:54] at their birth naturally that feeds on
[20:58] milk
[20:59] that's right right
[21:01] the lion feeds on milk the ox feeds on
[21:04] milk when a man born he also feeds on
[21:07] milk from his mama
[21:10] but there is one
[21:13] which is the ego now you have to grab
[21:17] what we are we are dealing with here we
[21:19] we are rapturing people
[21:23] we are people that are reeling the
[21:25] science of the time
[21:27] we are not taking kovic like the world
[21:30] is taking covey we are not taking the
[21:33] uh the economy crisis like the world is
[21:36] taking the economic crisis we are not
[21:38] taking our church situation like the
[21:40] world is taking it
[21:45] we are people that are preparing for a
[21:48] rapture
[21:50] so we realize here
[21:53] that uh
[22:01] as newborn babies like peter said in
[22:05] second peter first peter chapter 2 verse
[22:07] 2 he says as newborn babies
[22:11] we
[22:12] desire the sincere milk
[22:16] of the word
[22:17] praise the lord so we are fed on milk
[22:22] in our birth now you have to understand
[22:25] this now
[22:27] but our age that we are living in
[22:32] required that we be fed
[22:35] or meet
[22:37] because we are in the eagle age
[22:41] praise the lord
[22:43] in our own natural work our own natural
[22:47] walk with the lord we have to start from
[22:50] the sincere milk
[22:52] but the age that we are living in demand
[22:56] that
[22:57] everyone that are born of god in this
[22:59] age
[23:01] now that would bring to understanding
[23:06] the new birth
[23:08] [Music]
[23:10] praise the lord
[23:12] that would bring to understanding the
[23:14] new birth let me let me just take a
[23:16] little uh a level on that
[23:19] for us to understand that
[23:22] praise the lord
[23:25] jesus said
[23:28] uh
[23:29] let's let's go to saint john
[23:32] we will come back yet again i'm staying
[23:34] in hebrew let's go to sin john i i like
[23:38] this kind of services
[23:40] praise the lord
[23:43] these are my kind of services
[23:46] the other services
[23:47] is for the preachers this one is mine
[23:51] praise the lord let's go to sin john
[23:53] chapter 1.
[24:02] are we together
[24:04] praise the lord
[24:06] i can feel your amen coming from home so
[24:09] that's good
[24:12] i can feel your amen coming from home
[24:17] it's in john chapter one
[24:32] now in john chapter one here jesus
[24:36] jesus address
[24:39] he addressed the new birth he addressed
[24:42] uh uh the birth of god's children
[24:48] verse 12 he says for as many
[24:52] as receive him
[24:55] to them have have uh to them give him
[24:59] power to become sons of god
[25:04] even to them that believe on his name
[25:09] which will
[25:10] which were born not of blood none of the
[25:14] weight of the flesh none of the way of
[25:17] man
[25:19] but of god
[25:22] praise the lord
[25:23] amen
[25:26] and uh
[25:28] uh
[25:36] let's uh
[25:37] take also
[25:39] first peter
[25:41] chapter 1.
[25:45] now what where i want to grab our
[25:47] attention here is that
[25:49] but as many as receive him
[25:53] to them give he power to become sons of
[25:56] god now brother branham over and over
[25:59] he
[26:00] make us to realize that
[26:03] [Music]
[26:06] that speaks of our sonship
[26:10] okay
[26:11] it speaks of our sonship the power that
[26:14] is giving
[26:16] for you to become a son of god is the
[26:19] quickening power
[26:23] praise the lord
[26:24] that power is the quickening power that
[26:27] power is not from the church confession
[26:30] i receive jesus as my lord and savior
[26:33] no that power is the quickening power
[26:37] they are quicking you to see the jesus
[26:40] of your day
[26:43] sure
[26:45] praise the lord
[26:47] now that's the reason why i say our age
[26:50] demands that from birth
[26:53] we must eat meat
[26:55] because these these are the meat of the
[26:57] word
[27:01] are we together
[27:03] now let's take first john
[27:05] first peter 1 23
[27:13] you are giving power to become sons of
[27:16] god that's the quickening power that
[27:19] that they're quicking you in in your age
[27:21] and your day
[27:23] let me go back to this let me go back
[27:25] let's go back to to saint john let's go
[27:28] back to st john chapter one and let's
[27:31] take the beginning of the story here in
[27:33] context
[27:35] jesus said in the beginning was the word
[27:38] the word was with god
[27:40] the word
[27:41] was god
[27:43] amen
[27:44] then the next thing that came up in the
[27:46] conversation there was a man sent from
[27:50] god
[27:51] and that man
[27:53] was to bear witness of the light
[28:00] praise the lord so we have the word here
[28:03] which is the logos and we have the light
[28:07] praise the lord
[28:09] now he was not the light
[28:12] but he was sent to bear witness of the
[28:16] light
[28:18] that was the true light
[28:20] which lighted every man
[28:26] praise the lord
[28:28] so you see this this have they have more
[28:32] to do well because what i'm coming to
[28:34] here is i'm coming to an area of the new
[28:36] birth for us to be able to see
[28:41] this area here it has more to do
[28:45] with
[28:46] the light just like john in first john
[28:49] says if we walk in the light
[28:52] as he is in the light yes
[28:57] so it's the same it's a continuation of
[29:00] the same thought
[29:01] and what is the light
[29:04] the light is the move of god identifying
[29:08] the move of god in your day
[29:13] and there is no way you can identify
[29:15] until god quicken you
[29:23] until god quicken you to say oh yeah
[29:25] this is the light i see the light
[29:32] now so first peter
[29:36] 123 says
[29:38] yeah
[29:40] being born again met
[29:44] of corruptable which of course jesus
[29:47] identified yet not blessed not blood not
[29:50] flesh
[29:52] amen
[29:53] peter says
[29:54] being born again not of corruptible seed
[29:59] but of
[30:00] incorruptible by the word of god
[30:04] which liveth in a bath forever
[30:11] praise the lord
[30:13] now so that is the reason why
[30:16] uh our age
[30:18] jesus says to them much was giving much
[30:21] is required
[30:25] praise the lord
[30:26] if we are the believing people that
[30:29] believe that
[30:30] we will partake of not tasting death but
[30:33] we change in the moment of a twinkling
[30:35] of an eye we have to step up to that
[30:38] calling
[30:43] we have to step up to that calling just
[30:47] a church membership is not enough for
[30:49] that
[30:52] because it's the same age that is
[30:55] promised the manifestation of the sons
[30:58] and daughters of god
[31:00] and we we throw it into opening the
[31:02] blind eyes and raising the dead when it
[31:06] is just requiring us
[31:09] to be a son of god and a daughter of god
[31:12] in our choices and our decision the way
[31:15] we deal with things
[31:22] praise the lord
[31:24] now you have to remember is the little
[31:26] foxes that's paul divine
[31:30] the little things the way we deal with
[31:32] it
[31:38] is it all about ourselves or is it about
[31:40] the father
[31:42] we have to watch that
[31:46] because jesus the bridegroom in his last
[31:49] hour it was all about the father not my
[31:52] will but your will be done
[31:59] so with this bride last hour be all
[32:02] about pleasing god
[32:03] and not ourself
[32:09] are we together
[32:11] now so you see
[32:15] that is the place where
[32:18] the whole subject around the new birth
[32:21] gets a little bit uh uh
[32:24] it gets a little bit confusing
[32:27] because many of us experienced god
[32:32] before we came to the message
[32:36] but what the call year is
[32:40] what god quickened to us what the
[32:42] quickening power does was to to be able
[32:46] to quicken that seed
[32:49] that you can identify
[32:52] the message of your day
[32:54] that you can identify
[32:56] the move of god
[33:00] praise the lord
[33:03] amen
[33:05] and just like uh
[33:07] you know i'm i'm this guy that is always
[33:09] growing in cycle so
[33:13] praise the lord so what what was i
[33:15] talking about here back in hebrew
[33:18] chapter 5
[33:20] was talking about the birth of
[33:23] all of these
[33:25] four living creatures
[33:29] praise the lord each one of them at
[33:31] their birth the lion
[33:36] suck milk the the man the ox the same
[33:41] but then when it comes over to the ego
[33:45] right from birth
[33:48] right from birth
[33:51] you are being fed the mysteries of god
[33:56] right from birth the serpent see the
[33:58] godhead
[33:59] [Music]
[34:01] praise the lord because that is the
[34:04] thing our age required yes
[34:08] sure
[34:10] praise the lord
[34:11] to get ready for the bride i mean to get
[34:14] ready for the rapture yes
[34:17] we must feed on these things
[34:20] right from mama eagle's mouth into our
[34:23] mouth it's a fresh kill
[34:25] every service is a fresh kill
[34:32] amen are we together so you see god
[34:36] interest is not it's it's not having the
[34:39] mean god amiga church and having more
[34:42] church members god's interest is
[34:44] bringing sons and daughters to maturity
[34:52] praise the lord
[34:54] it's not to count how many members we
[34:56] are
[34:58] it's it's how much
[35:00] are we standing
[35:02] for what has been given to us in our day
[35:06] because honor the honor the lions
[35:08] anointing this tool for what was given
[35:11] to them the great evangelism went around
[35:14] the world honor the ox anointing the
[35:18] stool for what was given to them even to
[35:20] the burning of the stake
[35:25] honor the men's anointing they did the
[35:28] same the stool we we talked at the last
[35:30] time yet about uh
[35:32] uh william trader how he was burned for
[35:35] for writing all of that was honor the
[35:37] man's anointing when the printing press
[35:39] was open luther's and all of that
[35:43] this tool for what was given to them
[35:52] and what has been given to us in this
[35:54] age
[35:55] to get ready for the rapture
[35:58] is the opening of the seals is the
[36:00] mystery of god
[36:02] yes sir
[36:06] praise the lord
[36:10] that's what has been given to us in this
[36:11] age
[36:12] now there are some few things
[36:14] i would drag you into but let's read uh
[36:17] hebrew chapter 5 here a little bit
[36:27] i was sucking on the canyon and it's
[36:29] like now it's sucking on my throat
[36:38] so we see the first principle of the
[36:41] oracle of god is teaching
[36:44] and i become such as one needing milk
[36:47] and that strong meat for everyone
[36:51] that use it milk is on scale in the word
[36:56] of righteousness
[36:58] for he is a baby how long will we stay
[37:01] being babies
[37:03] but strong meat
[37:05] belonged to them that
[37:08] are of full age maturity
[37:12] praise the lord
[37:13] strong meat
[37:15] strong meat not not not only
[37:20] in the form of mystery but strong meat
[37:23] at a place where
[37:26] god
[37:27] could choose to deal with you
[37:30] strumming strong affliction strong
[37:33] rejection what's going to be your
[37:35] attitude
[37:37] strong meat is not only in the sense of
[37:39] mystery
[37:49] press lord
[37:55] and then and with with all of these uh
[37:58] uh uh uh uh
[38:01] strong comments people are making
[38:05] about the message about the messenger
[38:11] what is our attitude
[38:15] yes
[38:17] praise the lord
[38:20] strong meat belonged to them that are of
[38:24] full age
[38:25] even those who
[38:28] by reason
[38:29] of use have their senses exercised to
[38:33] discern
[38:35] both
[38:36] good
[38:37] and evil
[38:40] praise the lord
[38:42] yes
[38:44] now one thing that we have to realize
[38:46] there is that
[38:48] uh uh
[38:53] all of these living creatures just like
[38:55] the believer
[38:57] need to be fed to grow
[39:04] we need to be we need to constantly feed
[39:07] to go to grow so when people come to the
[39:10] place where they think that they already
[39:12] knows about this subject they already
[39:14] hear this they are already baptized in
[39:16] jesus name and you don't look for an
[39:19] area in your life of growth
[39:29] praise the lord
[39:31] let me let me approach this another way
[39:34] we just read
[39:36] matthew chapter 16 a scripture that we
[39:39] love
[39:40] praise the lord a scripture
[39:43] that we love
[39:46] and jesus says upon this rock
[39:50] i will build
[39:53] my church
[39:54] and the gifts of hell
[39:56] will not prevail against it now we all
[39:59] know
[40:00] that that rock is the revelation
[40:04] of jesus christ
[40:06] amen
[40:08] let's take deuteronomy chapter 27
[40:12] verse five i'll read some few things to
[40:14] you here from brother branham
[40:16] and uh uh
[40:18] but let's let's let's just let's just
[40:20] tell you
[40:22] i love these bible studies
[40:24] i love when the bible preached the
[40:26] message of the prophet
[40:27] [Laughter]
[40:31] praise the lord
[40:32] i love when the bible preached the
[40:33] message of the prophet
[40:36] matthew chapter 27
[40:42] verse five did i say matthew yes no it's
[40:46] as i supposed to say deuteronomy chapter
[40:48] 27
[40:50] verse five
[41:12] now verse 4 says therefore
[41:14] it shall be
[41:16] when ye be gone over jordan
[41:21] that yeah
[41:23] set
[41:24] up these stones
[41:26] moses giving them an instruction here my
[41:29] attention is on verse five
[41:31] verse
[41:32] five
[41:34] and there shall thou build an altar
[41:38] unto the lord
[41:40] thy god
[41:42] an altar of stones
[41:46] thou shall not lift up
[41:50] any iron tool
[41:52] upon them
[41:55] thou shalt build
[41:58] an altar
[42:00] of the law thy god of whole stones
[42:06] praise the lord
[42:07] amen
[42:09] now we we we taking the old testament
[42:12] principle
[42:13] we we want to apply tonight jesus said
[42:16] upon this rock
[42:18] i will build my church and we realize
[42:21] that that rock is the rock of revelation
[42:26] praise the lord
[42:28] and our year is moses instructing
[42:33] the people here when you go over jordan
[42:36] you're going to take this you know the
[42:38] stone you're going to build an altar
[42:40] unto the lord but he's also telling them
[42:44] that they should not lift up an iron
[42:47] don't ship the rock
[42:52] don't ship the rock
[42:54] because we are living in a dead in age
[42:58] where people want to shift the
[43:00] revelation of jesus to fit their
[43:02] lifestyle
[43:05] no leave the revelation as a whole stone
[43:11] don't shape it
[43:13] the revelation is a whole stone
[43:16] it's given by god don't don't put don't
[43:19] put an iron on it
[43:21] don't put no
[43:23] denominational or science idea or
[43:27] a modern church idea to kind of shape
[43:30] that
[43:32] to your lifestyle right
[43:36] leave it as a whole stone yes
[43:42] are we together
[43:45] praise the lord
[43:48] now you will see also
[43:51] when solomon built his temple
[43:55] first king chapter 6 verse 7.
[43:57] the bible says there was not heard
[44:01] ahamam
[44:04] the stones were brought
[44:06] and they were rightly fed into the
[44:10] building
[44:13] there was no hitting of stones
[44:16] now you watch this now
[44:18] as we travel because brother branham
[44:20] there with this in
[44:21] anti-evangelizing he talks a lot on that
[44:24] shipping of stones
[44:26] but it's a bible study tonight
[44:29] prayer meeting with father later first
[44:31] peter chapter 2.
[44:36] first peter chapter 2.
[44:44] praise the lord
[44:47] we have all of these people
[44:51] that has
[44:53] their independent revelation
[44:56] it has their independent revelation
[45:11] praise the lord
[45:13] that the thing god has has revealed to
[45:16] them
[45:19] you know and and and that revelation is
[45:22] just for them
[45:24] first peter chapter two
[45:26] let's take verse five
[45:37] first peter chapter 2 and let's take
[45:39] verse 5.
[45:40] there's a reason why i decide to
[45:42] approach the service like this tonight
[45:54] let's go from uh verse one
[45:58] let's go from verse one wherefore
[46:01] laying aside all malice
[46:04] and all god and hypocrisy
[46:08] and envy
[46:10] and all evil
[46:12] speaking can you imagine
[46:17] a people preparing for the rapture will
[46:20] have this kind of attitude among
[46:21] themselves
[46:27] as newborn babies
[46:30] desire the sincere milk
[46:33] of the word
[46:35] that ye may grow thereby
[46:38] so in one sense
[46:40] paul is saying you can only get away or
[46:43] peter is saying you can only get away
[46:46] from those things in your life if you
[46:49] are seeing them showing up that you
[46:51] still have a an attitude of evil
[46:53] speaking of people a kind of envious
[46:56] spirit and and plain hypocrisy man
[46:59] pleaser and all of that he's saying that
[47:03] it's a sign that you are a baby
[47:07] praise the lord
[47:09] amen
[47:10] you are a baby and you and you
[47:14] and you should be you should desire the
[47:16] sincere milk stop feeding on the word
[47:19] right
[47:20] stop feeding on the word start reading
[47:22] your bible
[47:25] chapter after chapter and then you will
[47:27] start growing and and and it's that
[47:30] growth
[47:31] in the world that will bring you above
[47:34] those things
[47:36] now that's not what i'm getting to but
[47:38] let's follow me he says if so be ye have
[47:41] tested
[47:42] that the lord is gracious
[47:46] to whom calling
[47:48] your calling as unto a living
[47:52] stone
[47:54] praise the lord
[47:57] this allowed indeed of of man by
[47:59] choosing of god and precious
[48:05] here also
[48:07] as lifeless stone
[48:09] i built up
[48:11] a spiritual house now take watch this
[48:15] now that is going to happen here
[48:18] when it comes to jesus says i will build
[48:21] my church
[48:24] which of course
[48:26] that
[48:27] comprises of
[48:29] the universal body of the bride the
[48:31] universal body of believers around the
[48:34] world
[48:35] the mystical body let me say that
[48:38] amen
[48:39] is built on the revelation
[48:42] of the word and that is what we must not
[48:45] ship
[48:47] but you
[48:49] as
[48:51] a lifeless stone
[48:53] need to be shaped
[48:58] amen
[48:59] praise the lord you don't you don't
[49:02] shape the revelation
[49:04] to fit you
[49:06] but god and now watch this now because
[49:08] if you apply it to solomon temple those
[49:11] stones
[49:13] that you you did not heard herman or
[49:16] saul used at the temple because the
[49:20] stone was held out they were shaped
[49:22] somewhere else
[49:24] yes sir
[49:26] before they were brought to be added to
[49:28] the temple god
[49:30] had the man to shape the stones and cut
[49:33] them
[49:35] different places
[49:37] but then when they were brought to the
[49:38] tabernacle every one of them fit right
[49:42] in
[49:43] because it was caught under god's
[49:46] supervision
[49:47] and that's what happened when god
[49:50] allowed things in our life for our
[49:53] growth
[49:55] he's shaping us so we can come together
[49:59] as lifeless stone
[50:01] to be able to fade into the into his
[50:04] body
[50:12] it is with our growth
[50:14] our maturity and yet also as lifeless
[50:18] tone i build up a spiritual house
[50:21] and holy priesthood to offer spiritual
[50:24] sacrifices
[50:26] accepted by god accepted to god by jesus
[50:30] christ
[50:31] praise the lord
[50:33] amen
[50:36] so we see here
[50:38] that
[50:41] the way that god
[50:43] brings us
[50:45] to maturity the way he draws us to
[50:48] himself
[50:49] is by teaching us
[50:52] and we know that is the only reason why
[50:56] he allowed things in our life i want to
[50:58] read this to you brother branham say
[51:00] here
[51:08] it is i be not afraid
[51:11] uh that was
[51:13] in our our quotes from uh sunday so
[51:18] he said therefore
[51:21] all of us
[51:23] are born by
[51:25] sexual desire
[51:28] and blood in us
[51:30] or sinful blood
[51:35] through a perverted way of bringing
[51:38] children to the earth
[51:41] god just spoke
[51:44] adam came forth
[51:49] so
[51:50] the woman was not in the original
[51:53] creation she's uh uh
[51:56] a bad product of the man
[51:58] he's taking
[52:00] or she's taken from his side
[52:03] a rape or he taken from his side god
[52:05] taken from his side a rape
[52:07] adam a spirit was both male and female
[52:12] both
[52:13] feminist and masculine in the spirit and
[52:16] god separated the masculine from the
[52:20] feminist and put the finish in a woman
[52:23] in the masculine in a man
[52:25] see what i'm going with this
[52:27] and see
[52:28] both body and spirit
[52:31] they are one
[52:34] that's the reason
[52:36] when sarah loved other angel
[52:41] said
[52:42] she couldn't be like that
[52:45] god
[52:46] would have slayed that woman right there
[52:51] but he couldn't hurt her
[52:53] because
[52:55] she's part of abraham
[52:58] right
[52:59] he they heard abraham if he took sarah
[53:04] and that's the reason
[53:06] our sins today
[53:09] will be everyone condemned but god can't
[53:13] take us
[53:15] because if he does he hurt christ
[53:20] we are part of him
[53:23] we
[53:24] are the bride
[53:26] don't you see it
[53:28] so there it is
[53:30] so grace
[53:32] hold us in our mistake
[53:36] until
[53:37] we
[53:38] can see
[53:39] better
[53:44] praise the lord
[53:46] grace hold us in our mistakes
[53:53] praise the lord that's why brother
[53:55] branham said
[53:56] in in in the sea of the question and
[53:58] answer series he said we we backslide
[54:02] before one another
[54:04] he said but we never backslide before
[54:05] god
[54:07] right
[54:08] praise the lord
[54:10] amen
[54:12] and that's the reason why in our growth
[54:15] he also taught us that brotherly
[54:17] kindness will bring us to the place
[54:19] where we will learn to bear with one
[54:22] another not quickly speaking against one
[54:25] another and condemning people
[54:27] and evil speaking them out
[54:39] so grace hold us in our mistakes
[54:42] until
[54:44] we can see better
[54:46] why because is the father that is
[54:49] dealing with us
[54:56] praise the lord
[54:58] i have another place here where
[55:01] we will talk about begotten and born but
[55:03] not tonight
[55:05] and i just want to hold us in this place
[55:09] praise the lord
[55:11] hold us in this place
[55:19] so grace hold us in our mistakes
[55:24] until we can see better
[55:29] because after all is the father
[55:32] that is dealing with us
[55:40] god's coveting with abraham god doesn't
[55:43] make any difference between his children
[55:47] every son that cometh
[55:50] to god must first be tried
[55:53] all
[55:56] casting
[55:58] you get it
[56:00] first be tried chesting corrected
[56:04] child trained school
[56:06] everyone everyone not one exception
[56:11] every son
[56:13] but we must also understand that
[56:16] he don't deal with us all the same way
[56:22] praise the lord
[56:23] he don't deal with us all the same way
[56:25] he will not deal with you and your
[56:27] children the same he will not deal with
[56:29] you and your wife the same
[56:32] you are all peculiar stones to god
[56:36] he got to take his time to shape you
[56:42] praise the lord
[56:43] and you see the wonderful thing there is
[56:45] that he's not shipping you where the
[56:48] building is being built
[56:52] that's right
[56:53] he's shipping you out in your working
[56:55] places at the grocery stores with your
[56:58] neighbors with your family members
[57:01] that's what he's shipping you
[57:05] praise the lord
[57:07] he's not shipping you where the building
[57:09] is being built
[57:18] we come to the service the word is
[57:20] preach whether it's an evangelist
[57:22] calling our sin or rebuking something we
[57:26] receive that word and then when we go
[57:28] out
[57:30] when we have to deal with our children
[57:32] or deal with our loved one or deal with
[57:35] a brother or sister or thee with a
[57:37] complete unbeliever what is our attitude
[57:40] how do you use the word
[57:42] the material that is given to you
[57:44] through the fightful ministry
[57:46] that's the thing that god is watching
[57:57] praise the lord
[58:02] he says now one exception
[58:06] not one exception god trusting he
[58:09] correct he child trained he schooled
[58:12] every
[58:13] one now one exception every son
[58:20] have you went through trials
[58:22] have you went through tribulation have
[58:24] you suffered persecution
[58:30] then you endured those things you are
[58:34] real children of god
[58:37] but when you can bear
[58:40] testimony when the road comes down heavy
[58:44] and you run off and back into the word
[58:48] the bible says you are illegitimate
[58:50] children and met
[58:54] the children of god
[58:56] now you see this thing is not it's not
[58:59] me bringing the word to attack you to
[59:02] wash your attitude no
[59:04] the one that is watching our attitude is
[59:07] the father
[59:10] he's watching an attitude of how am i
[59:12] preaching the word am i am i being
[59:15] personal to attack somebody
[59:17] now he's watching your attitude too of
[59:20] how you are receiving the word are you
[59:22] sitting down there and thinking well
[59:24] he's talking to me
[59:30] praise the lord
[59:32] because he is the one that is dealing
[59:34] with us like we have said over and over
[59:37] god is our audience
[59:39] yes
[59:41] amen
[59:42] you are now my
[59:44] audience we are on
[59:47] his stage
[59:50] whether we are in church or out of
[59:52] church you have to realize there is an
[59:55] unseen eye that is watching you
[1:00:07] but when you cannot bear attached to me
[1:00:09] when the roll comes down have it whether
[1:00:11] it comes by sickness it does not only
[1:00:14] count by the preaching of the word
[1:00:16] sometimes it comes by disappointment you
[1:00:18] are disappointed in this person he
[1:00:20] didn't even believe they would do that
[1:00:27] what are you going to do back up into
[1:00:28] the world
[1:00:31] then you are not a son
[1:00:35] that you are not a son that's the
[1:00:37] difference between a son and an
[1:00:39] illegitimate a son and a bastard
[1:00:42] praise the lord god try his sons he he
[1:00:46] proved us
[1:00:47] to build character in us
[1:00:53] god don't train the devil's children
[1:00:58] but he trained his sons
[1:01:02] praise the lord
[1:01:04] amen judah was a son of perdition
[1:01:09] jesus knowing all that he was doing
[1:01:12] never one time publicly rebuked him
[1:01:19] but he was right there on simon peter
[1:01:21] every time
[1:01:32] for when a man is born of the spirit of
[1:01:34] god
[1:01:36] he expect those things
[1:01:39] and he loved those things
[1:01:42] when a man is born of the spirit of god
[1:01:44] it all comes to our growth when the word
[1:01:48] of the hour has quickened you
[1:01:50] you expect those things
[1:01:56] you love it you know when you see it
[1:01:57] happening you love it you you're right
[1:01:59] right right there you identify that the
[1:02:01] father is addressing something in your
[1:02:04] life something hit me a couple of
[1:02:09] services ago and i wrote this down
[1:02:15] where the frustration is
[1:02:18] that people
[1:02:19] turn to look at
[1:02:21] what jesus says
[1:02:23] the two greatest commandments love the
[1:02:25] lord with all your heart and all your
[1:02:28] strength and all your mind
[1:02:33] you read
[1:02:35] many people testimony and you realize
[1:02:37] that
[1:02:39] they get frustrated and even we ourself
[1:02:41] we get frustrated sometimes
[1:02:44] because we are trying to prove to god
[1:02:47] lord you know i love you
[1:02:50] but it hits me like this
[1:02:53] you know like we always say
[1:02:56] it's because he first loved us
[1:03:02] his love has affected our life
[1:03:05] that we can love him back
[1:03:08] praise the lord yes
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:13] and like we always said is that the
[1:03:15] difference between god loved the whole
[1:03:17] world that's why his word says but god
[1:03:19] so loved the word the difference
[1:03:22] in the love is that there is one group
[1:03:25] that accept his love
[1:03:27] and the other don't accept his love
[1:03:30] they have not come to that place to
[1:03:32] embrace the love of god
[1:03:36] let me share this with you
[1:03:39] learn to embrace god's
[1:03:42] love then to struggle to love him
[1:03:48] yeah
[1:03:49] praise the lord
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] because jesus said he that loves me will
[1:03:54] keep my commandment
[1:03:56] so many times we try to prove that we
[1:03:59] love him by trying to do things that is
[1:04:02] in the word
[1:04:07] nor we must embrace his love when we are
[1:04:10] doing those things
[1:04:13] not do those things to prove your love
[1:04:15] to god
[1:04:17] because as a phoenix being you will
[1:04:20] always come short
[1:04:24] praise the lord let me let me turn it
[1:04:27] over to the marriage coveting the love
[1:04:30] comes from the man
[1:04:32] and the woman must embrace the love
[1:04:39] praise the lord husband love your wife
[1:04:42] that's what the scripture says
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:45] and she must embrace that love by
[1:04:49] by learning to appreciate the different
[1:04:52] things that he's doing
[1:04:54] because what happened there is that
[1:04:57] that love is put in the context
[1:05:01] of colors and shape
[1:05:07] when when the house is painted our best
[1:05:10] color oh he loved me he just gave me the
[1:05:12] color that i need
[1:05:17] all that you know that
[1:05:19] the card is bought oh he jesse gave me a
[1:05:21] gift it's just it's all in colors and
[1:05:23] shape
[1:05:25] that's the way we read it
[1:05:27] and even as children of god we bring the
[1:05:29] same thing to god we look at we look at
[1:05:32] ethnic things you know our health we
[1:05:34] look at money we look at different
[1:05:36] things and no we must embrace his love
[1:05:39] yes
[1:05:41] because whatever he give us
[1:05:44] he give it to us
[1:05:47] from a loving heart
[1:05:51] and we must learn to embrace it thank
[1:05:53] you jesus
[1:05:55] that's the reason why when we learn to
[1:05:57] give thanks in all things
[1:06:00] it pleases the father thank you jesus
[1:06:04] you are embracing the father's love
[1:06:08] instead of struggling to keep his
[1:06:10] commandment to love him
[1:06:13] let's embrace his love
[1:06:16] and in embracing his love you will be
[1:06:19] keeping his commanding
[1:06:24] because that is exactly what he commands
[1:06:26] of us
[1:06:30] praise the lord
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:34] it's it's easy it's easy to embrace his
[1:06:36] love
[1:06:37] yes
[1:06:39] it becomes easy if we just
[1:06:43] if we just
[1:06:45] love the one that god has given us just
[1:06:48] learn to love them
[1:06:51] because he loved us while we were yet
[1:06:53] sinners
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:57] and he loved us
[1:06:58] while he's shipping us he loves us
[1:07:00] he loves us that's the reason why he
[1:07:03] loves us that's the reason why he's
[1:07:04] doing everything that he's doing he's
[1:07:06] giving everything that he's given to us
[1:07:08] yes
[1:07:09] it's coming from a loving heart
[1:07:12] of a loving god
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:16] that god
[1:07:17] will choose you to become partakers of
[1:07:20] his suffering
[1:07:23] and he will call you into death
[1:07:26] by giving you a trial just embrace it
[1:07:29] thank you jesus i love you
[1:07:33] and in that way
[1:07:35] we will be fulfilling his commandment
[1:07:41] because we put this we put this thing uh
[1:07:44] i did this i did this you know i i left
[1:07:47] i left my old lifestyle i left this i
[1:07:50] left you just you just counting all that
[1:07:52] you have done
[1:07:54] to love god
[1:07:58] praise the lord you have to know that
[1:07:59] he's an internal being
[1:08:03] he don't have a beginning he don't have
[1:08:05] an end so just keep counting keep
[1:08:06] counting
[1:08:10] it's easy
[1:08:11] when we just embrace what he gives to us
[1:08:14] and say thank you jesus
[1:08:17] i love you
[1:08:20] i love you
[1:08:22] in these few broken words tonight let's
[1:08:23] go to the lord and pray
[1:08:29] let's go to the lord in prayer
[1:08:33] now i say all of this
[1:08:36] because
[1:08:39] i'm trusting and believing that the law
[1:08:41] would just ship our mind as a church
[1:08:44] as we deal with everything that we are
[1:08:45] dealing with
[1:08:47] he would just ship our mind
[1:08:50] he will cut off all the negative
[1:08:54] and just ship our mind
[1:08:57] to see that
[1:08:59] the tenor hand of jehovah
[1:09:01] is leading us
[1:09:04] yes the tenor hand of jehovah is guiding
[1:09:08] us
[1:09:10] in whatever he allows
[1:09:16] praise the lord
[1:09:17] we're not going to shape the stone to
[1:09:20] fit our lifestyle
[1:09:22] or fit our opinion fit our idea no he's
[1:09:25] building his church on the unmovable
[1:09:28] rock of revelation they're unchanging
[1:09:31] rock
[1:09:33] the unchanging god that do not change
[1:09:37] is building his church on that
[1:09:41] but yet he's using different things to
[1:09:44] ship us
[1:09:50] and i'm trusting i'm believing that we
[1:09:52] all will come from out of this
[1:09:55] and we will we we will learn we will
[1:09:57] grow in understanding
[1:10:00] praise the lord
[1:10:02] we will grow in understanding there's a
[1:10:04] quote brother branham said i will get
[1:10:06] that quote and read it to you from the
[1:10:08] pulpit healing is understanding
[1:10:13] it's
[1:10:14] understanding
[1:10:16] the moment you grab the revelation you
[1:10:19] understand that the price has already
[1:10:21] been paid
[1:10:23] yes
[1:10:24] it's not the feelings that you feel in
[1:10:26] your body
[1:10:30] that's right yes
[1:10:37] in the c.o.v brother says god gives you
[1:10:41] a vision
[1:10:43] of a body that is perfectly well
[1:10:48] and then you walk to go and embrace that
[1:10:50] body he said that's what he divine
[1:10:52] healing is
[1:10:54] you already see it it's a finished work
[1:10:56] so every day you are taking steps lord
[1:10:58] gave me great thank you jesus i'm healed
[1:11:00] i'm healed because you are seeing
[1:11:02] yourself as a healed person as a
[1:11:04] perfectly strong person and you are
[1:11:06] walking everything you are fighting
[1:11:11] i just i just broke into a testimony the
[1:11:13] other night was that last night
[1:11:17] about a man and his wife
[1:11:20] they just got married newly wedded
[1:11:23] and she came down with uh a terminal
[1:11:26] cancer
[1:11:27] it went so fast
[1:11:32] that on her dying bed
[1:11:35] but this this gentleman was now wavering
[1:11:39] i mean he's too bad heard and the last
[1:11:42] word he said to her
[1:11:44] he just held her hands and said if there
[1:11:47] is any fight in you fight
[1:11:51] he just said it not loud
[1:11:54] caught her by her name held her hands
[1:11:56] and said if there is any fight in you
[1:12:00] fight
[1:12:03] because she was having a baby
[1:12:05] so they had to rush her to the hospital
[1:12:07] and and they did a c-session and took
[1:12:10] the child and and he was saying it he
[1:12:12] says uh our baby would need you if there
[1:12:16] is any fight in you and just that slow
[1:12:19] speaking word
[1:12:22] brought the miracle that blasted the
[1:12:24] doctor's mind
[1:12:29] and i just believed it was almighty god
[1:12:33] yes
[1:12:35] because it was in no time when she sat
[1:12:37] up on
[1:12:40] the hospital bed
[1:12:43] and she asked that she wanted water to
[1:12:45] drink
[1:12:47] and the doctors were all confused
[1:12:50] now so you see whatever faith he had
[1:12:56] in needing his wife he got so desperate
[1:13:04] praise the lord
[1:13:06] you know i was just thinking about that
[1:13:08] i'm closing now my bible is closed
[1:13:10] everything is closed
[1:13:14] i was just thinking about that the other
[1:13:16] night
[1:13:18] while meditating
[1:13:22] there is nothing like blind faith
[1:13:25] a fit
[1:13:27] can give
[1:13:28] the blind man his side that fate can see
[1:13:35] a faith can raise the dead back to life
[1:13:37] their faith is alive
[1:13:41] if faith can make the to walk
[1:13:44] then faith can move yes
[1:13:48] there is nothing like blind faith
[1:13:51] faith has eyes that look at the promise
[1:13:54] of god amen
[1:14:04] let's buy our house together tonight
[1:14:10] jesus is my savior
[1:14:14] i shall not be moved
[1:14:16] [Music]
[1:14:18] in his love and favor
[1:14:22] i shall not
[1:14:24] oh just like a tree
[1:14:28] thus planted by the wall
[1:14:32] auto
[1:14:34] yes i
[1:14:36] shall not
[1:14:38] be
[1:14:39] moved
[1:14:42] yes if i trust him ever
[1:14:47] i shall not be he will fill me
[1:14:51] he will fill me never
[1:14:56] i should not oh
[1:14:58] just like a tree yes that's planted by
[1:15:04] the water
[1:15:07] yes i
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:21] i shall not be
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:32] [Music]
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:47] glory hallelujah
[1:15:49] glory
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:16:04] just like a tree
[1:16:07] that's planted by the water
[1:16:14] i
[1:16:15] shall not
[1:16:17] be
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:33] be
[1:16:35] i shall not be more just like a tree
[1:16:40] that's planted by the water
[1:16:46] [Music]

[1:16:55] we are all work in progress
[1:16:58] and we know that he's working on us yes
[1:17:00] yes there is no reason to be stubborn
[1:17:04] there is no reason to hold to an idea
[1:17:07] when it's not bringing forth fruit
[1:17:11] there is no reason to hold to our
[1:17:12] opinion to hold to a stand
[1:17:15] when it's not bringing full fruit
[1:17:18] the fruit that we look for
[1:17:20] is to glorify the father
[1:17:24] it's not a growth
[1:17:27] if we are not glory and fire in the
[1:17:29] father
[1:17:30] we are just showing that this is our way
[1:17:32] of life and this is the way we believe
[1:17:34] it and this is the way we think that
[1:17:35] it's supposed to be
[1:17:37] i don't care who says what the father is
