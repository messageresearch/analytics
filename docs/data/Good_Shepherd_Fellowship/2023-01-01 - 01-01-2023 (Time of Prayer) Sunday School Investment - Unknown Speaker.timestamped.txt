[0:00] group that seems to be a petty thing to
[0:01] you and some little bright shiny
[0:04] something that you grab for and if I
[0:06] happen to reach out for the for the word
[0:08] or something like that my state
[0:09] presbyter put me out or my Bishop will
[0:11] throw me out why if you come to God
[0:13] you're gonna be thrown out anyhow so
[0:15] what's the difference I'd rather be if
[0:18] you're throwed out you'll throw it in so
[0:19] that's it
[0:21] there's three things God always deals in
[0:24] threes we know that he's perfected in
[0:25] threes remember in the days of Noah they
[0:28] went in
[0:29] they are
[0:30] and in the days of Sodom Jesus was
[0:33] speaking of these two days of Silent
[0:35] they went out they went in and those
[0:36] time went out and and uh sodom's time
[0:39] and they go up and this time let's go in
[0:42] go out go up
[0:44] that's what we need now we need a
[0:47] going-up affair we need a going up from
[0:49] these things and worldly things that's
[0:51] got us so bound down Daniel wasn't going
[0:54] to defile himself and watch he was going
[0:56] to keep that word in a place so it could
[0:58] flow through the word want to do it's
[1:01] set down an angel it protected his life
[1:03] he didn't admire himself the Hebrew
[1:05] children was determined they said all
[1:08] the rest of them are bound when the
[1:09] flute sound and when the Bishops say
[1:11] stalton they holler froggy they jump but
[1:13] he said we're not going to do it
[1:15] you my Duchess you're able to burn us up
[1:18] you're able to kick us out you're able
[1:19] to do this without the other but we're
[1:20] not bowing down to your image anyhow
[1:22] amen
[1:23] there wasn't only in the defile their
[1:26] investment is going to be the word and
[1:27] the word that's going to stand on and
[1:29] when a Time come to make a decision
[1:31] there's going to stand by the word
[1:33] save their lives they had a fourth man
[1:35] down there there's anything that we need
[1:37] this morning is that fourth man among us
[1:39] that's right that's right that now
[1:42] now Peter one time he was a he was
[1:46] nothing but a fisherman he had a
[1:47] business a fisherman but you know what
[1:49] he saw something in Jesus Christ
[1:52] that his father you know his father
[1:54] Jonas was a a great man he was a
[1:57] fisherman now just to give a little
[1:59] drama here just before we close that in
[2:01] the next few minutes we just came inside
[2:04] you're 11 we're trying to be through 11
[2:06] 30 you can stand a little longer so we
[2:08] we'll go ahead and I know Jonas might
[2:11] have said to his son just a little drama
[2:13] when he take him and Andrew on their
[2:16] left his gray hair shiny guy through a
[2:18] days of fishing more that had to trust
[2:20] ever a day for their daily bread and I
[2:24] can see him sit there and say my son
[2:25] listen Simon there there will be a time
[2:28] I always wanted to see the Messiah and
[2:31] we've always believed that because we're
[2:33] promised one but uh listen Simon my son
[2:36] there will be a lot of bogus things rise
[2:38] up and there was before the real Messiah
[2:41] comes
[2:42] but said you know this Messiah Simon
[2:45] because he'll be exactly with the
[2:47] scripture and all the rest of them will
[2:49] be against him see but this Messiah will
[2:51] prove it because we are Jews we are
[2:54] taught to believe those prophets because
[2:56] the Lord God told us that everyone's
[2:58] spiritual among you uh or a prophet I
[3:01] the Lord will speak to him in visions
[3:03] and what he says will come to pass then
[3:05] you'll know that that man's a prophet
[3:06] and the Moses told us that our Messiah
[3:09] would be a prophet and you watch him now
[3:12] we haven't had one for hundreds and
[3:13] hundreds of years but being knowing that
[3:15] after the Old Gentleman passed away one
[3:18] day Andrew staggered off down to Europe
[3:19] a man speaking that was prophesying of a
[3:23] coming Messiah
[3:25] and after a while this Messiah come on
[3:28] the scene
[3:29] and night uh John who was looking for
[3:32] him saw the god sign coming down Jehovah
[3:36] the God speaking with a voice and in the
[3:39] shape of a dove lighting upon him and
[3:42] the voice saying this is my beloved Son
[3:44] and whom I'm pleased to dwell in
[3:47] in whom I'm pleased to dwell the same
[3:49] way just turn the verb for the adverts
[3:51] now in whom I'm pleased to dwell in her
[3:53] pleased to to be dwelling in he has
[3:57] satisfied me he's did just what uh uh
[4:00] know that he should he should do and
[4:03] what I said that he would do nah and
[4:06] when Peter say or meets Andrew saying
[4:09] there he saw his soul he saw Jesus the
[4:10] next they said Rabbi Lord dwelleth I
[4:12] said come see
[4:14] so then he went and told his brother
[4:15] after staying with him all night the
[4:17] next morning he's fully persuaded that
[4:19] was Messiah and the next morning he went
[4:21] to get his brother and he brought he
[4:23] said come on we found the Messiah I can
[4:25] imagine Simon saying now wait just a
[4:27] minute I'm a commercial fisherman here
[4:28] I'm a I'm a Pharisee up here I'll Sprout
[4:30] the same church my daddy did and I've
[4:32] had all this Messiah stuff all over but
[4:34] wait a minute Simon do you remember the
[4:37] teaching of our of our word
[4:39] you remember what oh yeah I know you've
[4:41] seen all this stuff I didn't dad for
[4:43] tell us that all this stuff with glamor
[4:45] would come up but that wouldn't be it
[4:47] but we would know he'd be a scriptural
[4:49] man
[4:49] you say with the word because he will be
[4:52] the word
[4:54] so they just couldn't understand that so
[4:56] Simon walks up and said well I guess
[4:57] I'll go see and as soon as he come into
[4:59] the presence of Jesus now he left off a
[5:03] day's fishing of his Daily Bread he was
[5:05] a businessman you see and so uh he uh
[5:08] come to this meeting and in this he
[5:11] walks up and when Jesus laid his eyes
[5:14] upon him he said behold an Israelite in
[5:16] whom there is no God see look I'm sorry
[5:19] I quoted the wrong man here's what he
[5:22] said he said your name is Simon and you
[5:25] are the son of Jonas
[5:28] then Peter took out a policy see he made
[5:33] an investment right there not only did
[5:35] he know who he was he know that Godly
[5:37] old father that is
[5:39] I mean what would happen and he seen the
[5:41] word Vindicated
[5:43] that Rich Young Ruler might have been
[5:45] standing to see that same thing
[5:47] but Peter was ready to sell out his
[5:49] business and his membership and make an
[5:51] investment
[5:53] he'd done something to him
[5:55] how about Nathaniel had this Grove out
[5:58] there like you have here in Phoenix and
[6:00] and one day he's out there and he's a
[6:02] Bible student and when Philip saw this
[6:05] done run over and told he said hey we
[6:06] found the Messiah who Moses spoke of he
[6:09] said now Jesus of Nazareth the son of
[6:11] Joseph he said now could there be any
[6:13] good thing come out of such a place that
[6:15] I've looked would you say with Jesus and
[6:16] Ezra I looked over every one of our
[6:18] presenters none of them had said nothing
[6:20] about him we don't have any school
[6:22] Seminary you come from no did you know
[6:25] all the way down through the Bible the
[6:28] prophets that rose up we don't know
[6:30] where they come from
[6:32] no background to them they just moved on
[6:34] the scene and moved off just the same
[6:35] way
[6:36] they had no experiences back somewhere
[6:39] they'd come to bring the people that got
[6:41] out Loose and bring them ages back and
[6:44] tied into the Bible again see
[6:46] or didn't Moses come from a humble
[6:48] parent we just know his parents know
[6:50] nothing of his background look at Elijah
[6:52] we don't even know he's popping mama was
[6:54] just put on the scene look at over there
[6:57] look at the other rest of them look at
[6:58] Amos we spoke of the other night no one
[7:00] know where he come from he's a herdsman
[7:02] that's all we know
[7:03] you just come on the scene yet when he
[7:06] finished his work like the great Elijah
[7:07] God give him a chair ride right into
[7:09] heaven see we don't know where they come
[7:11] from they have no schools or backgrounds
[7:13] God just raises them up to slam that
[7:15] word back and they don't have any
[7:16] denominational ties to time and say you
[7:19] have to do this or put them out look at
[7:21] even John the Baptist that great noted
[7:22] Prophet even in a lineage of a priest
[7:25] but he never went to his daddy's schools
[7:27] he had to introduce the Messiah he
[7:30] couldn't wait or Dr Jones sure he's a
[7:33] fine man you know you recognize him as
[7:34] Messiah he couldn't be persuaded with a
[7:36] bunch of man like that he went into the
[7:38] Wilderness because his his job was
[7:40] important and he stayed out there until
[7:42] he heard from God and he knowed what he
[7:44] would be and when he saw him coming he
[7:46] said there's the Lamb of God that takes
[7:48] away the sin of the world
[7:49] the rest of them never seen nothing but
[7:51] he saw it
[7:54] Daniel he was kind of a surprise but
[7:57] when he walked up he told him about what
[7:58] he had said to Peter said you know that
[8:00] we are students of the scripture we know
[8:02] that Messiah be a prophet so when he
[8:04] come on the scene while he walked up to
[8:06] him and he said um I walk up in the
[8:08] congregation and Jesus looked up along
[8:10] and said behold an Israelite and whom
[8:11] there's no God he said Rabbi when did
[8:13] you know me said before Philip calls you
[8:15] when you were under the tree in a prayer
[8:18] meeting Heather I saw you what eyes and
[8:22] right there he made an investment what
[8:23] did he do right before his Rabbi priests
[8:26] and everything he admitted his hypocrisy
[8:28] he fell on his feet and off his feet to
[8:31] his knees and said rather hard the Son
[8:34] of God you are the king of Israel when
[8:37] many of those hot class men stood around
[8:39] there and all their farms and things and
[8:41] said this man's Beelzebub and Jesus told
[8:43] him they were blaspheming calling the
[8:45] spirit of God an evil thing see
[8:47] certainly oh my the little woman at the
[8:50] well what about her she certainly had an
[8:53] investment when she come out there in
[8:55] all of her immorals the church that got
[8:57] her in such a place so she didn't know
[8:58] where she was and so she just went to
[9:00] prostitution but her simple humble heart
[9:05] this may be a great word I want you to
[9:07] take it right
[9:08] she was predestinated eternal life all
[9:11] the father has given me will come she
[9:13] had to come for water she got us but not
[9:15] from Jacob's Well see no man can come
[9:18] except the father calls him first and
[9:20] all he's giving me will come I'll raise
[9:22] him up against the last days those who
[9:24] he foreign
[9:25] Justified those who Justified he
[9:27] Sanctified or already he's glorified
[9:32] watch when that word sign and word
[9:35] scriptural of vindication fell upon
[9:38] those rabbis and Priests they said this
[9:40] man's the devil
[9:42] but when he fell upon that little
[9:43] prostitute what happened quit his face
[9:46] to life
[9:47] them Rabbi said this man has the
[9:49] telepathy this man is a a fortune teller
[9:53] that's where you can tell those people
[9:54] he's a fortune teller but as soon as I
[9:57] struck that little prostitute in that
[9:58] condition
[10:00] if it could alarm that prostitute in
[10:03] that condition what order does it do to
[10:04] the Pentecostal Church who claims to
[10:06] have the Holy Ghost
[10:13] well if it don't go over your hand
[10:18] what were it to do to us but as soon as
[10:20] it flystone then
[10:22] Susan flashed on the little woman she
[10:25] never said you are a you're a Beelzebub
[10:27] look at her she said sir I perceive
[10:29] you're a prophet now we are no we know
[10:32] we're looking for one to come we have
[10:33] that Prophet for hundreds of years but
[10:35] we know that the Messiah is going to be
[10:37] a prophet we are here tell us these
[10:39] things when he comes Jesus said I'm he
[10:41] now she know a man that could tell her
[10:43] that would certainly be honest because
[10:45] he had the word the word was with him
[10:46] for the word come to the prophet he had
[10:49] the true interpretation of it for he was
[10:51] the word and as soon as a stalker he was
[10:54] interested in a policy right away she
[10:56] wanted an investment right quick
[10:59] he wants some of that water that she
[11:02] didn't have to come to the well to draw
[11:04] and as soon as she seated it set her
[11:06] harder fire down into the city she went
[11:08] said come see a man who's told me the
[11:11] things I've done isn't this the very
[11:12] Messiah isn't this what Messiah is
[11:14] supposed to be and the Bible said that
[11:17] the people of the city believed Jesus
[11:20] because what he had done to that woman
[11:22] her testimony calls that City attorney
[11:24] I've never done any Miracles you know
[11:26] what Philip was coming down to do that
[11:27] so like John never had any Miracles God
[11:30] Jesus is going to follow him now we find
[11:33] out that that they invested in this
[11:35] policy right away let me take just
[11:37] another two if you would pardon me a
[11:39] minute a few Nicodemus one day admitted
[11:42] the truth no he come by night to make an
[11:45] investment and he found the bank was
[11:47] open
[11:48] it's always open
[11:51] he thought well the bank's doing
[11:53] business all through the day for this uh
[11:55] Investments but I believe I'll go by the
[11:57] night and but he found it open ready and
[12:00] he said Rabbi we know that God a man
[12:03] sent from God no man could do these
[12:05] things like you're doing except God be
[12:07] with him that's totally impossible see
[12:09] he admitted there to the whole
[12:12] denominational world
[12:14] that they know it was so but for
[12:16] prejudice and pride and social
[12:20] popularity of the day just like that
[12:22] rich young kid did
[12:25] for Prestige and social understandings
[12:27] and they didn't want to give up the
[12:30] world
[12:31] just as act like this nation the Lord a
[12:34] Godly Man up there to correct us that's
[12:37] the reason we're wormy with Communism
[12:39] they won't take a Godly Man they'll
[12:42] elect somebody that can let them live
[12:44] any way they want to
[12:46] it's easy for us Americans and US
[12:48] Christians to say that but when we come
[12:50] down in now let's talk and bring it back
[12:52] home once you church members wants the
[12:54] same thing you want some preacher are
[12:57] you women are not condemn you for the
[12:59] way you dress and live somebody that'll
[13:01] catch you people on the back and tell
[13:03] you that you can do this that and the
[13:04] other and you can act like the world and
[13:06] live like the world and still maintain
[13:08] your confession of Christ
[13:15] to get a man like that in there
[13:18] it's the desire it's the spirit of the
[13:20] nation
[13:21] it's a spirit of the last days
[13:23] I want to confess and hold your
[13:25] confession on this I'm Pentecost I'm
[13:28] Methodist Baptist and still holding that
[13:30] and live any way you want to
[13:35] Jezebel and the country the same way but
[13:38] God sent him a pastor Elijah was her
[13:41] pastor well she wouldn't admit it but he
[13:42] was anyhow
[13:45] certainly God was able to be stones to
[13:48] Rochester and Abraham
[13:50] God don't have to come to your group or
[13:52] no other group
[13:53] God he does what he wants to
[13:56] and he will one thing he cannot do
[13:58] that's deny his own word
[14:00] so Nicodemus team and he want to make an
[14:02] investment and he found just what he is
[14:04] asking for he was sincere he found it we
[14:08] ought to hurry Luke 24 49 there have
[14:10] been a group of people had made an
[14:11] investment and Jesus told him in Luke 24
[14:13] 49 that 120 you go up there to the day
[14:17] of Pentecost up there and wait until
[14:19] you're in due with power going high I'm
[14:21] going to send you some interest on this
[14:25] it found him how do you take just that
[14:27] group how do you take that little Groove
[14:29] one day when he had a Ministry of
[14:31] Healing The Sick and showing his
[14:33] messiahship while everybody oh wonderful
[14:35] Rabbi oh come over to our church hold a
[14:37] meeting here Rabbi we want you over here
[14:39] we want you over here and a great group
[14:41] began to follow him but one day that God
[14:43] changed that Ministry in him from
[14:45] Miracles to the teaching of the word
[14:48] let's read between the lines you're not
[14:49] that blind
[14:50] if it is you lay a pencil between your
[14:52] eyes and put your eyes out notice
[14:55] notice the pencil that would write the
[14:57] word of God
[14:58] notice as soon as God sees his ministry
[15:02] from his miracles his miracles went on
[15:03] but not like that he began to tell him
[15:05] the straight scripture truth and where
[15:07] he was standing the crowd walked away
[15:09] from us this is a hard saying
[15:13] what happened the 70
[15:16] that was following him he had ordained
[15:19] walked away too said who can understand
[15:20] a thing like this that's all against
[15:21] everything we've ever taught
[15:24] what happened and he turned to the 12
[15:26] and said you want to go too
[15:28] that's when Peter said that wonderful
[15:29] word Lord where would we go
[15:32] tell me something better
[15:34] oh God have mercy
[15:36] where can you find any Creed that's
[15:39] better than the word of God where can
[15:41] you find any love that's deeper than the
[15:43] love of Jesus Christ
[15:45] where can you find any satisfaction
[15:47] deeper than the satisfaction Jesus
[15:50] Christ gives
[15:51] what makes you do the things to do is
[15:53] because you're it shows an emptiness
