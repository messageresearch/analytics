========================================

praise the Lord shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus wait thank you so very much for the opportunity we've had once again all God to come before you for every opportunity before you it's great and it's wonderful and can never be compared to anything else under the Sun we are so grateful Lord that your love for us has constrain us to come this way and we thank you for the wonderful provisions that have made for us in this life and in the life to come we are so grateful that you came to die in our place that we may inherit the kingdom of God we thank you for being our righteousness for being our strength for being our peace and our joy and everything we can talk about Oh God we are so grateful that you add a source of our lives for without you there is no life you came that we may have life and have life more abundantly and we owe you all there is in this life Oh God we are so very much grateful we worship the father this morning we bless the Lord and we glorify thee father for the next 30 minutes we are still going to be looking at our prayer topic and we are trusting your grace or dad to help us we know that a revision can be very boring some of the times but we are trusting your grace that you bring some excitement for the old guard even as we continue to look at his prayer topic help us further in our walk with you and let a name be glorified in all of this we're just thanking were shitty father once again in Jesus name Amen you're all warmly welcome welcome radar normally on Sundays in the morning between 1015 and 10:45 which is 30 minutes we have adult Sunday School so not to confuse you yes so just bear with us praise be to God so we are so with two of our revision looking at prayer now before I go into what I want us to look at today let me just take a moment you know to encourage I was talking to somebody the other day over over an issue they mentioned that oh they have prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and it's like there is nothing happening when you get to that stage it is not a button to feel like there is nothing happening but it's a button when you get to that point and then you cave in or you give up so it looks like doubt was beginning to set in or doubt had already set in you know for every prayer we offer to God if that prayer is not been answered God has no weight according to our timing god works according to his timing so in our walk with God and in our prayer lives we ought to be very very patient with God when you have prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and it's like nothing is happening still keep holding on by you holding on shows how much you have faith in God that God would answer the prayer when you begin to doubt that is where the problem comes in for every prayer you say let just just take it this way maybe there's a bucket as I study for buckets and every prayer you see maybe it's a cup of water you put in the bucket every prayer you see it's a cup of water you put in the bucket and the water level keeps rising even though we are not seeing the result yet but when you begin to doubt it's like you have suffered so much praying over something and then you put a hole in the bucket probably the bucket was almost full you've been praying and trusting God but when you begin to doubt now it's like oh the water you put in the bucket which is getting to is brim now you ended up putting a hole under the bucket and draining the water out that is what doubt does but so long as your faith in God remains there it keeps you said keep holding on to God that prayer is good it doesn't matter how long it takes God is going to glorify himself praise be to God so never get tired praying never give up never let doubt come between you and God praise be to God so today we are so talking about prayer and just picking bits and pieces here things we've already talked about and trying to add a few things trusting that God would continue to help us now when you read first Timothy 2 1 2 3 if we can open our Bibles kimochi if you get it before me you can read it first Timothy two two one two three okay I exotic therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior praise be to God now when you look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ all his life was just nothing but prayer and as the song goes Jesus that I would prayer and he ended with prayer prayer was his companion and he would pray to the Father pray for the sick deliver people from the earth from from from from from evil spirits just praying sometimes is very very easy for us to pray for one another as brothers and sisters in God but when it comes your neighbor your next-door neighbor or the fellow seated next to you in the office we are quick to brand them and prayer is the last thing we would ever think doing for them but it was also with Jesus not only was he praying for those in the household of Israel but even outside he prayed for them we can talk about there is sort of machine and woman the Greek woman whose daughter was possessed by evil spirit and she went to the Lord Jesus we know the story we don't have much time not when to go into it and Jesus said it is not me to give daily deterrence bread to the dogs and she said how be it the crumbs that fall to the ground the dogs can't can take that and Jesus saw her faith and healed Hedorah not only that we can also talk about the Centurion whose beloved servant was sick to the point of death and he called the elders of Israel and sent them to the Lord Jesus Christ asking him to come and heal his servant and then they wanted a lord and they were telling him oh this is a very wonderful man he loves our nation he has built us a synagogue they give a very good report about him and the Lord Jesus could not turn him down and while he was on his way go into his house and a Centurion hell jesus was coming he sent his servants it's a good and tell him that I am not worried that he should come under my roof needed wife counted ready to come to him but wherever he is he she just stopped his just picked away praise be to God I am a man set in authority I tell this go and they go I tell this come and they come I tell these do this and they drew it what was he saying he recognized the Lord Jesus was a man of authority that he could speak to the storms and the storms would be good would obey he speaks and the Lord Jesus marveled he said what I have not found such a faith in Israel I have not found it praise be to God so prayer was his companion he didn't only have to pray for those he called brethren but even outside of the camp wherever there was a need and he was called upon he still prayed bear with me I want us to go to a place here now as we said prayer was his companion on his life and even on the cross he still prayed when he was crucified and he hung on the cross when he was lifted between the F and the heaven he's afraid when he said Father forgive them for they know not what you are doing he was praying praise be to God and not only that a bit on the cross he was still answering prayer the two male factors that were crucified with him and one read on him started making fun of him if you had a Christ ago self and save us and the other one rebuked him and told him that we are suffering this because we deserve it because of the crime we have committed but this man here is innocent he has not done anything wrong don't you feel good and after that he said Lord remember me when you come in that Kingdom praise be to God and Allah Jesus told him verily I say unto you today you are going to be with me in paradise even on the cross he was an answering prayer if there was any time in his life that he was not supposed to another prayer I would have thought there was going to be the time that he was he was he was in the most agonizing moment of his life the most terrible time the most terrible time that time he foresaw and he told the Father father if it is possible let this cup pass away the most agonizing moment of his life if there was any time that he was supposed to turn down prayer or not as a prayer I would have thought that was going to be the time but that did not stop him from answering prayer that did not stop him praise be to God he said today you would be with me in paradise praise be to God now there is no special time for prayer there is no special time for prayer every prayer time is a special time do not wait until you are caught up by events do not wait until the store begin to come do not wait until life begins to get sour there is no special time for prayer every prayer time is special now the thief on the cross sometimes we think you have to pray in volumes one hour straight two hours straight three hours straight before God begins to hear you or before God answers your prayer the rare Branham talked about quality prayer quality prayer so we confer a different sheet prayer between quality and quality by this I am NOT saying that it is wrong to pray for an hour or two three four hours I am NOT saying it is wrong so that somebody can use that as an excuse for laziness and no children of God are led by the Spirit of God if you are being led by the Spirit of God to pray and pray for hours on end do it to the glory of God but what I'm trying to establish here sometimes God is just waiting for that last way to come out of your mouth that last word that is what God is just waiting to move on the same it that that team did not know himself he didn't know himself he didn't know who he was where he came from and why he was going he didn't know but a Lord Jesus Christ knew him but just look at this under cross he didn't turn to him to tell him oh you I know you are going to be in paradise with me you had told about know he little miniature of that it was when he prayed Lord remember me when you come in your kingdom prayer move mountains it was when he prayed when he was hanging day he was probably thinking of oh so finally death has caught up with me oh my life is wasted away and he was probably thinking of how many rooms you broke into and how many robberies you committed the pain he brought on people and how he had disappointed father and mother and disappointed the community just with death looking at him in the face just at the eleventh hour just at the eleventh hour when all hopes were gone he didn't know that next to him was eternal life praise be to God it took a word of Prayer Lord remember me and when you coming in your kingdom for birth to open his eyes so it is so good to pray for hours on end and it is ok sometimes it is it is probably a weight or true a weight or two and that is what the Lord is just waiting for now when he ascended into heaven the Bible says he is seated on the right hand of God the Father what is he doing interceding for us interceding he has not stopped praying all his life on earth he was praying when he was lifted on the earth and he will be 28 and in heaven praying and answering prayers and now in heaven still interceding for us praying never get tired of praying never get tired still interceding for us now I want us to take a scripture here you somewhere down so let's keep rolling we'll get there so what am I trying to establish air this morning I'm missing something here praise be to God I Tara her scripts are down but I think I have it somewhere oh good day let's keep going so still on a cross he is prayed and it has heated for us now intercessory prayer is a very very very important and we must not overlook the Bible says we should pray for people in authority as a child of God when you get up in the morning on a beautiful Sunday morning like this on your coming to church you ought to pray for the service you are to pray for the service the night before or probably in the course of the week or in the morning before you come to church or when you come to church you are to commit yourself committed service into the hands of God for their service to be a blessing to you you must pray for it pray for the pastor or whoever is going to minister the word pray pray for the ministry pray for the song service prefer I mean really did it did they instrument Amira Harvick on the present brothers and sisters on the instruments pray for them we are it a duty to God to commit the service into the hands of God do not take those things lightly in the priya is a very very important in and as I said before I'm saying it again that selfishness is not only in the physical sometimes we are also very very selfish spiritually that we pray for only ourselves and for only those who belong to us it's very difficult to just look at a brother or a sister and live them before God and keep them till you see God vindicate himself in the life of their older sister but it always has to be guess me or somebody close to me it doesn't have to be that way praise be to God there is something here I want us to look at you know as a Jeremiah one five or Jeremiah five one can we look at that Jeremiah I said one five I believe yes Jeremiah 1:5 before I found thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations praise be to God now the Bible says that give son Colin are without repentance gifts and Colin are without repentance Jeremiah was not ordained a prophet unto himself he was not ordained a prophet unto the family he was coming from not on to his father not on to his mother but unto the nations so the gift of God in a man's life or the gift of God in a woman's life is not meant for that person it's meant for the kingdom of God now there is a way I bring I want us to watch this we are talking about what intercessory prayer if by the grace of God you can see the gift of God in a life you all got a duty to pray for that gift you don't owe it to that person as a matter of fact sometimes the person who has the gift does not even know they have a gift they don't know it and sometimes they even know it but they will know the importance of that gift and what happens is that the devil can take a hold of that gift and instead of that gift be used to the glory of God that devil can use that gift to his own glory so we are it to God not to that person not the family from which the person comes not his father not with my dad not to his son not his daughter we owe it to God to pray for that gift that is what intercessory prayer would sometimes we see the gift we say Oh his father should be praying for him or should be praying for him his parents should be praying for him oh hey I mean their family he comes from and know that gift doesn't belong to that family it belongs to the household of God if we sit down and then we just look at it and then something happens and the devil takes glory instead of the glory being taken by God then guess what we have a problem that fellow is not the one losing the gift it is not the family that is losing the gift it is the household of God that is losing the gift we owe it to God not that person we owe it to God not the family we owe it to God to pray for the sanctity of that gift praise be to God now Jesus was a gift to the world and when he was born that three wise men saw his star and the following star all the way till they got to Herod and when her head that a king was born he got interested not for the good reasons and then he asked the wise men when they saw the star and then he was able to narrow it down to the time that the child was born and he told the three wise men go and find out who he is and why he is and then when you are done come and tell me so I would also go in worship Him the three wise men went worship the Lord Jesus and a Lord warned them never to go back to Herod because Herod wanted to kill him so they went back using a different route and when Harald got to know later on that they mocked him he was so angry he just killed a children two years and below but before then an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph say Joseph take that child take his mother you guys go to Egypt for Herod is seeking the life of this child what was God doing God was protecting his gift God was protecting that gift they went to Egypt and everything come back until Herod died and the end of the law went to Joseph that now take the child take his mother go back because Herod is dead what was God doing God was protecting his gift the gift of God might be protected we don't do it just because we feel like doing it you will do it because it's part of our duty it's part of our god-given duty to protect the gift of God in our midst if we as an assembly come together and we don't see the gift of God in has been manifested then there is a problem we should be happy the gift does not have to come from under your roof to be relevant it doesn't matter where the gift is coming from but if we can see the gift of God in a sister the gift of God in a brother we shall rally behind that gift pray protect that gift that the devil does not lay his hands on that gift because when the devil lays his hands on that gift is affecting the entire body praise be to God we are talking about intercessory prayer my time is up once again praise be to God shall we pray so I remember we need to intercede for one another it's not just enough to pray for yourself and then always it's just me me I I we we know try to lift others before God it's okay to lift others before God praise be to God you've prayed for yourself enough shall we pray our Lord and our master Jesus we're trying this oh very much for this opportunity once again O God we thank you so very much for the pieces of waste that have come out this morning and we are trusting in you Father old God to join them together in our hearts Lord and let them in a statement to us Lord that we shall not depart from our god-given duty that which are not only free when we feel like it but we shall pray father knowing the prayer is part of our life it's an integral part of this journey that we've been called to all God we'll just pray that you help us lord help us we are trusting in you father help us to pray and to pray as often as we ought to and to also intercede father for one another that is not all about us that is all about others also father will commit others into their hands this morning we surrender our ways on to do God our thoughts our imaginations our reasoning our affections our memory we surrender them all unto thee our lives we surrender unto thee O God we surrender all that we are and all that would ever be we surrender all unto thee O God take them Lord and bring the best out of us well just thank you so much Lord for this portion of our Sunday service and we commit the rest of the service until enhance the song service and administration of your word or God may you come dear Lord Jesus and bless arahat

have given Amen god bless your sense [Music]
