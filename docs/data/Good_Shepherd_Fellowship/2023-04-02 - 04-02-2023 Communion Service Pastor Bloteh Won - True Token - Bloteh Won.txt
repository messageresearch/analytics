sweet praise the Lord thank you musicians let's take our Bibles over to Joshua chapter 2. I mentioned this morning we will speak a little bit on the true talking we want to take a top there from Joshua chapter 2. foreign let's read from verse 9 let's read that Rahab testimony read from verse 9. and Rahab said unto the men I know that the Lord has given you the land and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the lane faint because of you praise the Lord for we have heard how the Lord dry up the water of the Red Sea for you when ye came out of Egypt and what year did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan singing and Ox home year utterly destroyed and as soon as we have heard these things our heart did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man she's describing the condition of the city because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and in the earth beneath praise the Lord what a testimony from a woman that we all know what her lifestyle was a testimony it's a contrast that she's not just appealing to the man and saying uh be sorry for me please help me and my family but she's actually testifying what she have heard amen and with everything that she have heard her testimony is that your God is in heaven and by what we are hearing we know that he's also on Earth amen praise the Lord verse 12 now therefore I prayed you swear unto me but the Lord Saints I have shown you kindness their year will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true talking praise the Lord and that year was saved a life my father and my mother and my brothers that's what the talking will do another talking you will be claiming your loved ones you will be believing for them praise the Lord you will look beyond their mistakes and say father I don't know how you're going to do it but I'm believing you that you will bring my children through and believe in you that you will save this love on us mine amen that's the sign of a truth talking and that year was saved alive my father my mother my brethroughs my sisters and all that they have not only them this promise is unto you and unto your children and unto as many as the Lord Our God shall call and all that they have and deliver our life from death praise the Lord and the man answer her our life for yours praise the Lord our life for yours let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you gave your life for us father you were the truth Witness you are the captain of the Lord host father you give your life for us and Lord God if we would just hold this testimony in our heart to God to know that what you have given us is a truth token and father we come tonight to identify ourselves with death we pray that God you will bless the service this evening as we look into your word in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat we will come back to uh Joshua chapter 2 Deuteronomy chapter 25. praise the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 25 verse 1 if there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment that the judge May judge them then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked if there's a controversy if there's a fuss between men the righteous should be justified the weakest should be condemned and it shall be if the Wicked Man be worth it to be beaten that the George shall cause him to to lay down and to be beaten before his face I call him to his fault by a certain number 40 Stripes he may give him and not exceed praise the Lord I know I spoke about this I've dropped my talks into Data or drop a thought into that some time ago maybe a week or something like that but you know I was just telling someone before the service it is is one of those things a catch your mind and then uh nothing else comes to your mind it just stay on your mind until you talk about it so uh when when when when you are the Paw preacher like mine that's that's what happened and I was I was preparing the communion and then I was uh uh there you know uh praying and pouring the wine in in the small cups since we we that's what we've been using and I think it's been working well praise the Lord and uh so since we got we got that uh uh I've I've tried several times to be able to count how many cups this can take and uh sometimes we would bring extra wine just in case we you know we have more numbers than than the cup I mean than those that are that uh uh attending the service and if we run out of wine we will be able to fill it but I've and every time I've tried I've never been successful because you see how everything is round you start counting then your brain just go mix up thank you every time I try I've never been but I don't know for what reason today I was determined that I would count it so what I did was I kept my finger and then I would kind of come to my finger and then I'll bring my finger and then I would come and then all of that and then the first time I counted it I counted 39 holes I said let me do it again and I counted 40. praise the Lord and I says well I don't know if I can trust myself I might find somebody else to help me but the the thing there is that as soon as I counted 39 holes Deuteronomy 25 came to my mind praise the Lord because when we spoke about it we we we said that uh you know Medical Science has grouped all the illness into 40 classes representing the 40s tribes so no matter what kind of for illness the devil will affect the people with a it would just be in one of those 40 classes and uh nor in the Lord knowing the Lord of Moses Caiaphas will ask them to give Jesus 39 stripes because it was not supposed to exceed 40 but it gave him 39 stripes and uh so I mean my mind just went right to death and then whenever it happened like that everything around me freeze I can't think on anything again praise the Lord so I said well I got to get somebody to help me to make sure that a I'm not pulling uh you know a bird out of the heart tonight and that's all I sent for my friend brother Jordan I said come and help me you know I trust your measurement their mind and he was the one that purchased it so he just went back to the site and then showed me you know show me that yeah it has 40 cups carrier so praise the Lord and so because what came to my mind is that I'm thinking in my mind that they did this by inspiration you know it's about inspiration they just did that we did it just set this out strictly that it has to just be 40 space you know that was what was playing in my mind you know uh uh and and and uh as as Christians as Believers that's the thing that bless us when you can be able to to place their right into the scripture every time it bless you it would just it would just relax your mind amen and what's good there is the other uh we don't wait to count the people that attend the communion before we pour the wine I make sure that we fill 40 cups we pray over it and bring it so even if it is two person will be representing the 40 stripes praise the Lord amen so whether we are more or we are less we want to stay right in the pages of the world amen okay let's go to our our exhortation tonight I want to talk on truth on the truth talking and Hebrew chapter 11 Hebrew chapter 11. Hebrew chapter 11. let's read from verse 30 by faith the word of Jericho fell down after their work compiles about seven days praise the Lord by faith the Harlot rehab perish net now this this caught my mind yeah the talking about the truth talking we'll get to that but there was something that caught my mind I was as I was looking into this is the other now this is the this is the fifth chapter praise the Lord and brother Branham said the other uh when Paul brought the report the Old Testament report through the covet and blood of Jesus Christ he never mentioned the effort praise the Lord but there is a unique thing in the scripture that even after Rahab was a name in the genology of Jesus Christ Matthew chapter 1 verse 5. this scripture continued to call her Rahab the halot even in the fifth chapter for some reason Paul never changed it he never said by faith rehab he says by faith the halot rehab praise the Lord amen now in my mind I'm thinking years you go to James chapter 2 verse 25 let's read that true James also mentioned the same hmm well let me let me read my my verse here before I go to James Taylor one by faith the hallowed rehab perish not with them that believe in that when she had received their spies in peace praise the Lord James chapter 2 James chapter 2. verse 25 likewise also was not Rahab the halot Justified by works praise the Lord I wonder how many of us would love to be in the service and the preacher is talking and saying uh and and even rehab the halot praise the Lord amen but I will tell you that with what she experienced calling her the halot will not change her attitude I believe there's a reason why the Holy Spirit placed that there and one example that came to my mind what I was thinking about this was uh brother Branham will always talk about uh my my brain is failing me but he would talk about Rosetta the alcoholic even though Rosetta was prayed for and God delivered her from that devil but every time when brother Branham would talk about sister Rosetta he will always says the alcoholic how God deliver her from that so you see there is something different sometimes you know if if if we have not experienced the grace of God in certain areas we get a complex about it praise the Lord but the attitude of the person that God has brought out of that is completely different because it's not a mental thing it's something where the grace of God has delivered the person praise the Lord amen for Rehab to see that only that part of the world of the city where how house was that was the only War that never fell down praise the Lord amen I believe it's it's one of the places where we take proud in the grace of God to say I was on drugs and Jesus delivered me people that have experienced True Deliverance they are not ashamed to testify what God brought them through are we together and I just thought about that and to see how Paul will place her in the fifth chapter the Hall of faith amen he placed her in the heart of faith now you you we think about that you look at that and then in your mind you think okay Faith come about hearing and hearing of the word of God what was the preacher who was the preacher down there that was preaching to Rahab for her to have faith but yeah Paul is saying they are by faith her action was by faith for her to be able to receive despise in in in in in hiding by the way this time Joshua only send two I was I was uh thinking about that yesterday why too why did Joshua send two before Moses sent 10 12 he took one from each tribe he sent 12 or whatever Joshua sent two issue was sent 12 just like Moses two is is the number of witness when two or three agreed upon anything praise the Lord I believe that Joshua learned his lesson amen at least if one comes with with wrong report is his word against this other one word you just need two person for the witness praise the Lord amen but you see here the uh the the Apostle Paul the prophet of the Gentiles he was looking at rehab faith and not her conduct amen he was looking at because Rahab herself testified of her faith we have heard praise the Lord whether she was reading it through the newspaper or she was watching it on CNN praise the Lord but whatever way that she was getting this information it was having impact on her it was affecting her and they brought her to a conclusion that whoever your God is not the one that we are serving here in Jericho whoever your God is he said God the one that can open the receipt has to be the god of Heaven praise the Lord he's the god of heaven and he's the god of Earth because he sees he's identified so whichever way that she was getting the message Paul is making us to see that it will fit in her praise the Lord her attitude to those uh spiers was because of the faith she believed in those guys praise the Lord so we see that uh you know uh [Music] there's a place here let's let's go back to uh uh Joshua chapter 2. praise the Lord let's let's just appreciate the grace of God tonight amen let's appreciate the grace of God tonight amen this is it's such a wonderful thing the Lord like to meet us just just the way we are amen praise the Lord okay I'm uh let's look at verse 3 the Bible says and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring for the men that I come today wish I enter into thine house for they become to set out all the country and a woman told God the two men and hate them and said to us there came men unto me but I was not when when's the word and it came to pass about the time of shot in the gate when it was that that the men went out whether the man went out I was not pursued after them quickly for years shall overtake them and yet she had these men in her house praise the Lord now Harris their faith when rehab is telling a blunt lie and then yeah Paul is saying rehab by faith praise the Lord amen now you see that you have to realize that rehab is not a Jude right amen Rahab was not giving the Ten Commandments are we together by the way that the scripture even introduced us to this woman she had a lifestyle that was that was wrongly influenced she was living wrong already for her to be able to have that kind of a lifestyle that the Bible will Target her like a a halot I mean uh it is it is it is it is it all goes with that she had to seduce men she have to lie and all of that but you see there is something here that I want us to to recognize it is not that Paul was overlooking her sin praise the Lord but Paul was helping us to realize that it is not that God overlooked Hussein but her sin was forgiven praise the Lord amen all the wrong that she have done the lies that she have told him in the wrong life that she had lived but something got a hold of her heart praise the Lord a reality that she herself cannot explain to realize that these men are spies and and that this city is going to be destroyed she testified your terror is all over the city every one of us are afraid people are stuck in fools in their home they don't know what's going to happen they are expecting the war we can feel your terrorists all over the place but there's something in her heart of what she have heard will create that uh a move in her heart that she will she will hide this man praise the Lord and she will turn around and and defy her King when her King has sent to her house he said we know that you I know we know that you know every man that come in the city I mean just for them to choose her house among all the house I don't believe that she was the only halot in Jericho Praise the Lord are we together so poor man you can see how the grace of God brought her into the how the the Hall of Faith because yeah he's he's making us to see what true forgiveness will do what the grace of God that takes a man from the pit of sin amen what the grace of God can do in the life of anybody if your life can be changed can be affected by the by the Gospel of Jesus Christ God can also reach the life of anyone praise the Lord if he can save my life he can also save your life he can save the life of The Sinner that is on the street amen praise the Lord this is the grace of God here that we're talking about so we realized that she was a woman of Destiny for the grace of God to take her from that lifestyle and place her in Matthew chapter one right in the language of the Messiah she was a woman of Destiny praise the Lord and this Gentile Bride is a woman of Destiny praise the Lord is now only blessing us as the Bride of Jesus Christ but is putting us in the rapture he says you will sit with me in my throne even as I've overcame and I sat down with the father in his throne that is our destiny to rule and reign with Christ praise the Lord she was a woman of Destiny the bride is also a lady of Destiny Hallelujah butter Branham said this let me let me just read that that's just one quote I want to read tonight from the message talking he says we serve the Living God wave the living signs Matt I go to church I join I know the Creed I know all the catechism I know the cliches around the message praise the Lord I know the different groups and you know uh uh uh he says that's that's not what he's talking about here he's talking about a living God they're having a living signs and what he's doing it can affect our lives it can bring us to a conviction just like a broad rehab to a conviction it's not just to conform I said we ain't a message and this is the way the sisters can dress and this is the way the brother know it's a living God that is living among his people praise the Lord and that I joined I know the Creed I know all the catechism he says that is their forms but the truth talking Rahab said give me a true talking praise the Lord that I can go to bed and sleep tonight to know that my father my mother my brothers and sisters their children will be safe give me a truth token praise the Lord I will tell you that this message of the hour is a truth token Paul gave it one time to the Philippine jailer he says believe the Lord Jesus Christ you and your household will be safe praise the Lord are we together he says boy the truth talking of the blood speaking out speak of a living resurrected presence Hallelujah a truth talking affected the heart of rehab she was convinced she was convinced that they have overtaken the city praise the Lord she wanted a truth talking about a truth talking of the blood speaking out speaking of a living resurrected presence Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right living right now Among Us praise the Lord there's a truth talking living right now Among Us it can change our life it can deliver us it can give us a strength and Grace to overcome whatever seems to be a challenge whatever that is there that is discouraging you that is weak in you there is a truth talking that can raise you above that praise the Lord the truth talking Among Us amen is speak better from better from not their forms and Creed but a living talking of a living Resurrected Christ that live in US that live in US praise the Lord so we have a truth talking honor the blue the blood of bulls and goats if that truth talking could affect Rahab amen if she could be concerned and convinced that there's a living God among these people how much more it must affect us praise the Lord we must be affected by that living talking that there is a living God Among Us praise the Lord you see when we get all of that conviction then we don't struggle in our mind to write our prayer requests or give our thanks and and and and and and bring things before the Church of the Living God because we believe there is there is a living God Among Us praise the Lord the devil knows how to blow up our triers and he knows how to blow up our challenges that sometimes it becomes so bigger and that's all that stays on our mind when there wouldn't have been a word for there to be a trial and challenge if there was not a God that created it praise the Lord amen a truth talking when that truth talking affect our life it will make us concerned amen rehab was so affected and influenced by what she heard she was convinced that this city is coming down just like that we must be convinced that this word is passing away praise the Lord this word is passing away the only future that we have is the coming of the lord The Rapture the Rapture is our future Hallelujah she said we are all we living just like Dead Walking if you go in the supermarket that's all you years and the same thing is with us walk through it take to convince us when everything on the news is just defca jacking and then and gone shooting in there that's all around us what should it take to convince us that we are living in the Thy Word what should it takes to convince us praise the Lord when we are convinced like rehab that we are living in a Dying World and uh it gave us the courage to apply the talking Rahab I believe every morning she wakes up she went to look that the Scarlet Trail was hanging I hope nobody put it down I hope the wind never blow it away she wanted to make sure that that Scarlet robe was hanging through her window because she said this man says my life for the ass praise the Lord a truth talking amen the messenger says our life for yours praise the Lord our life for yours if you just keep this hope in your heart if you keep this hope in your heart our life for yours amen praise the Lord and I believe that's the same our lord Jesus did and that's why he taught us when we come to this time of communion let's remind ourselves that he gave his life for us his life was for us he says do this in remembrance remind yourself and let it be a truth talking to you praise the Lord we have a living God God is not dead He's Alive amen he's alive there's there's there is something that is going through my mind here I was uh I was listening to a song and uh uh musicians you can come forth we change the order of the service and then uh we will praise the Lord will prepare ourselves here for the uh okay I know what what was going through my mind I was I was thinking about that song get get get all decided until everybody that Jesus Christ is the king of King amen I was thinking about that song during the weekend and knowing that we were getting into Easter and then uh I you know I started singing it in in out of the verse and get excited to everybody Jesus Christ it's alive Jesus is not a dead He's Alive get all this out of everybody that Jesus is Raising there is an empty grave in his alive praise the Lord there's a living God Among Us people amen it's a God that can answer prayer is a God that can heal the sick he's a God that promised that his word is going to change the atoms of our body

mercy has followed me oh so glad you found it and you said me oh yes so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm blessed you just imagine now despise will give a report and every time they give a report and tell their testimony every time Joshua would come up to speak he was listening and even uh rehab the house you just think about it and one might have gone through the minds of the different men that might have had an interest in rehab and every time the year rehab the house they just get troubled about it but you see because she was a woman of Destiny it was not just for anybody her power was was was was was lined up in royalty that it took a priest Simon the prince he was a priest he was from Judah it took Simon the priest that the priest even though he have heard Joshua saying over and over rehab the halot and her family be nice be nice to have the Harlot in her family he was able to look Beyond there and fell in love with this woman because she was designed to be in the lineage of Jesus Christ could you imagine in your mind that child the Holy Ghost might have just put that title on her just so no man will love her because she was destinated to be in royalty anytime they think about it you know because I think about the same story there with uh with uh uh Ruth there was a man that was more closer than than Boaz and every time I read the scripture I can I cannot you know uh I I just feel that's just my human mind he was ready to redeem Naomi but just to find out that he had to redeem Ruth there was a moabite and every religious Jews know what the story about a moabite maybe that might have just threw him off and said no no okay boas you can go ahead but God sometimes had to place our life into those China because you are destined for royalty if God would have just given you the clear path that he gave to everybody you might not be here if you have just given you the glory that he gave to everybody their wealth and all of that maybe Grace might have found you but it might have found you on a sick day what a wonderful father we self [Music] he have given us a truth token praise the Lord [Music] as we buy our house tonight thank you yes Jesus is the sweetest peace

Lord love the Lord tonight what a wonderful Jesus he is First Corinthians chapter 11. First Corinthians chapter 11. a lot of it when the Lord comes in the Simplicity of his word and speak to our heart amen praise the Lord we have a truth talking it was his life for ours amen and there is you can get nothing better there is no better bargain than that he gave his life for hours that's our truth talking First Corinthians chapter 11 let's read from verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which was broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he have stopped saying this cup is a New Testament of My Blood this year as of as you drink it in remembrance of me praise the Lord so we are not remembering ourselves tonight you must not be remembering your thoughts or your struggle you we might be remembering him praise the Lord he's the one that we should keep on our mind that he was wounded for our transgression it was bruised for our iniquity the devil will do everything for you to remember your thought and remember yourself but Jesus says when you come to this table remember me amen not brother one Jesus praise the Lord verse 26 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup he do shows the Lost death till he comes amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord on waterly shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of this cup what kind of examination should we go through let's examine ourselves whatever we are thinking on him because the worshiper is never on our examination we have gone through this over and over and I always like to remind us praise the Lord because it's not your worthiness that brings you to this table it is his worthiness and until we can get into that for us to receive the full blessing of the communion you got to get into that if not before you come to this table you will just keep struggling Lord forgive me Lord forgive me and the devil will just keep punching your mind and keep punching your mind the way you examine yourself is whether you are counting him worthy or you are counting yourself worthy praise the Lord are we not grateful for the message of the hour if that Catholic will take us through another way we have to confess all of our sin everything you have done wrong this week the Pentecostal will put us on the hunger strike for God to forgive you you got to go and drive fast the entire week well the word says look up to me keep me on your mind remember me remember what I did for you remember Calvary but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh on water they've eaten and drink a damnation to himself not discerning your body no not Discerning the Lord's body praise the Lord and we know it is not that body that is up in heaven is just there for a memorial we must discern this body praise the Lord that every one of us that are sitting here tonight and that God will give Grace to come to this table praise the Lord you must be thankful for a brother when he comes up for a sister when it comes up that's the way we discern the Lord's body because this is his body praise the Lord and when we get into that and when we can ship our mind from looking at a historical Jesus and start to look at the present tense Jesus the word in our mess and every time we come to service when you say brother God bless you you know what it means praise the Lord for he that Drinker and uh eat it in it and drink it on what he live eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many a week and sacred among you and many sleep praise the Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord amen he was wounded for my transgression let's let's sing there while we uh
