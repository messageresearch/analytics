[40:40] their sister solace there's brother

[40:47] she needs a touch from the lord
[40:53] we believe that the lord is
[40:55] moving on behalf of the saints
[40:59] justice gone weekend she's been on a
[41:01] life support
[41:03] and
[41:05] the doctors thought they were not
[41:07] getting no communication from her brain
[41:10] and they were
[41:12] planning on making
[41:14] a move of
[41:16] taking her off of life support
[41:19] but
[41:20] [Music]
[41:22] she's beginning to respond
[41:26] because
[41:27] the saints being praying
[41:29] so we want to lift our sister up in the
[41:32] hands of the lord
[41:35] and
[41:36] [Music]
[41:41] i left
[41:44] zimbabwe and i was transiting over in
[41:48] amsterdam and i got a call
[41:51] from
[41:53] brother frederick that used to be with
[41:55] us
[41:56] young brother frederick
[41:58] he was dealing with a problem from the
[42:00] heart
[42:01] and his younger brother called me
[42:04] from drc he's back in the congo
[42:08] and
[42:10] he's
[42:12] standing right between life and death
[42:15] and he's back in the hospital
[42:18] his uh
[42:20] his heart
[42:22] situation has gone to about
[42:29] from what the younger brother told me
[42:31] down to about 15 percent
[42:35] and i think that is beginning to affect
[42:39] affects his reasoning soul
[42:41] he's in and out
[42:43] of
[42:45] the way that he's communicating so
[42:48] we want to bring brother frederick
[42:50] before the law tonight
[42:53] and
[42:55] wesley and sister character asking
[42:58] prayer for
[43:00] the adult of sarah and the little baby
[43:03] ezra
[43:04] and sarah hussman as well
[43:09] i think
[43:10] the family have been affected with
[43:13] the the kovi virus most especially for
[43:15] the little baby
[43:17] but uh
[43:19] i think uh
[43:21] they are doing
[43:23] uh better is not in uh in a kind of a
[43:26] critical state but in the prayer
[43:30] and i think also uh there was a prayer
[43:32] request that came true for uh
[43:36] we want a sister father friend a
[43:38] work-made
[43:39] mother
[43:40] also
[43:42] i didn't see the
[43:44] the request but i saw
[43:46] some messages through so talking to my
[43:48] wife she related it to me
[43:51] a little bit
[43:52] and so we have all of these knees
[43:55] tonight
[43:56] and most especially when
[43:59] with this
[44:01] life threatening
[44:03] situation
[44:04] [Music]
[44:06] we know that the devil will try to
[44:08] [Music]
[44:11] make use of
[44:12] whatever opportunity that he has
[44:15] to frustrate our faith
[44:17] and
[44:19] to put us more in the kind of a
[44:22] doubtful position
[44:23] worry position than
[44:25] believing on the almighty god amen
[44:28] sometimes you hear these things and
[44:31] you know it's so easy for us to fall
[44:33] into that move oh my god oh god have
[44:36] mercy
[44:37] instead of us jumping to the position of

[1:03:39] the lord for granting us a safe travel
[1:03:42] this was a kind of uh
[1:03:46] kind of a reconnecting
[1:03:48] uh trip that we had to make something
[1:03:51] that just
[1:03:52] that just came up
[1:03:54] came up when we were over in the
[1:03:56] uk uh uh
[1:03:59] had us have had a service for brother
[1:04:01] joe chicosy her old friend
[1:04:05] and then so he kind of prayed on me to
[1:04:08] to come and be with them
[1:04:09] yeah they are building their church so
[1:04:12] they thought they would have got the
[1:04:14] church ready for dedication so he wanted
[1:04:16] me to come for the dedication so he said
[1:04:18] well if it does not work we still want
[1:04:21] you to come
[1:04:22] and uh
[1:04:24] because since since uh the lockdown
[1:04:28] uh kovi locked down this will be the
[1:04:30] first time
[1:04:31] that the the saints in zimbabwe are
[1:04:34] having big meetings congregating
[1:04:36] together
[1:04:38] you get in the country to stay you know
[1:04:40] they stay uh uh uh very
[1:04:44] serious on using their marks and
[1:04:45] different things so uh so you could see
[1:04:48] that uh
[1:04:49] they really needed this time to together
[1:04:52] so it was it was something they were
[1:04:54] doing for the local church and and the
[1:04:56] churches that spring out of the
[1:04:59] local church there in harare but then it
[1:05:02] turned out to be something completely
[1:05:03] different praise the lord
[1:05:05] a meeting that was not announced
[1:05:09] three thousand people show up
[1:05:13] so if it was announced maybe we
[1:05:15] have been buried with the crowd
[1:05:18] praise the lord so
[1:05:20] uh the first night uh the
[1:05:23] they have it they had a tent
[1:05:25] that it put up
[1:05:27] uh that they have they normally run
[1:05:28] their meetings to about five thousand
[1:05:31] plus
[1:05:32] but because the meeting was not
[1:05:34] announced so they just used half of the
[1:05:36] tent that could hold
[1:05:39] about two thousand two thousand five but
[1:05:42] it i mean the people
[1:05:44] overran the tent so
[1:05:46] uh it was it was just uh
[1:05:50] extraordinary
[1:05:52] to see
[1:05:54] the people
[1:05:56] turning out for the meetings
[1:05:58] in that number
[1:05:59] and not only just the turnout but to see
[1:06:02] the reception
[1:06:04] man just to see the reception uh the way
[1:06:07] the people receive the word
[1:06:09] i mean uh
[1:06:12] it's almost looks like when you are
[1:06:13] preaching you want to take the words
[1:06:15] from your mouth amen
[1:06:17] you know i mean brothers sisters they
[1:06:19] all run into the pulpit and and it was
[1:06:21] just it was just
[1:06:23] something completely different
[1:06:26] and i have a uh i'm not
[1:06:29] i'm not very too
[1:06:31] smart you know
[1:06:33] when uh when when serious things are
[1:06:35] going on to be able to video it uh
[1:06:39] it already happened before i realized oh
[1:06:40] my god i wanna i wish i video it
[1:06:43] you know so i'm not very smart in that
[1:06:46] so i told some of the brothers to send
[1:06:47] me some of the videos that they talked
[1:06:49] during the meetings
[1:06:50] so i don't have enough videos to sh to
[1:06:53] share with you
[1:06:54] but uh
[1:06:56] i thought i would i would just show you
[1:06:58] a few of them and so i told expert
[1:07:02] jordan to help us
[1:07:05] just to
[1:07:06] be able to
[1:07:07] throw a few of the videos up
[1:07:10] and
[1:07:11] [Music]
[1:07:12] this was uh
[1:07:15] one of the worship service
[1:07:17] after the preaching i think yeah this
[1:07:19] was after the preaching
[1:07:21] there should be
[1:07:22] monday we had a we had a
[1:07:26] saturday morning saturday evening sunday

[1:07:40] heroes day and then
[1:07:43] then tuesday also follow as the armed
[1:07:46] force is there so it's a long weekend
[1:07:49] so uh and the amazing thing there is
[1:07:51] that this is not the only meetings that
[1:07:53] is going on
[1:07:55] you have three thousand people here and
[1:07:57] then you have brother gideon on the
[1:07:59] other side have five thousand people

[1:08:06] in montari you have
[1:08:08] another group of thousands of people i
[1:08:10] don't know how to do it but
[1:08:12] that's that's uh that's what they are
[1:08:15] doing today praise the lord
[1:08:17] and now while we were going to one of
[1:08:18] the meetings i i you know i could see
[1:08:20] the other group going on the other side
[1:08:22] so the brothers stop and say well you
[1:08:24] see that building there five thousand
[1:08:26] people are gathering there for meetings
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:09:05] if i took them they would not be good
[1:09:08] so
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:29] ah
[1:09:35] let's see
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:54] now the brother that is
[1:09:57] the
[1:09:59] brother that is that is leading the song
[1:10:01] here
[1:10:02] he's uh he's uh he's the
[1:10:06] associate pastor to brother chico cd
[1:10:09] in uh
[1:10:10] in harare
[1:10:13] one of the things that blew my mind
[1:10:16] was
[1:10:19] to see how
[1:10:21] how humble the people are
[1:10:24] okay
[1:10:26] it's not only
[1:10:27] for them
[1:10:28] you know worshipping like this
[1:10:31] but some of these men are
[1:10:33] top men in the zimbabwe society
[1:10:37] the brother that is leading the song on
[1:10:39] the ground there
[1:10:40] he's one of the chief justice
[1:10:46] this brother
[1:10:48] he's a very
[1:10:49] top man in the zimbabwe
[1:10:52] government
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:58] to see how
[1:11:01] the world would put such a humbleness in
[1:11:04] their heart
[1:11:06] i mean it would make you a shame of
[1:11:08] yourself
[1:11:11] because those are not people that you
[1:11:13] can come close to in the society
[1:11:19] but if they don't tell you you will not
[1:11:21] know
[1:11:26] and uh uh
[1:11:28] brother
[1:11:29] that was one of the reason why i asked i
[1:11:31] asked the pastor to send me this
[1:11:33] particular video
[1:11:34] i just wanted to
[1:11:37] to have that
[1:11:39] and uh uh
[1:11:42] not only this brother there's another
[1:11:43] brother there
[1:11:45] where is he i think he's standing on
[1:11:47] this side because i was somewhere on
[1:11:49] this side
[1:11:50] after the meeting i came down from the
[1:11:51] pulpit
[1:11:54] he's he's also
[1:11:56] one of the chief executive in one of the
[1:11:58] biggest zimbabwe bank
[1:12:00] and he's a pastor of another assembly
[1:12:05] but our
[1:12:06] brother uh
[1:12:11] but joe
[1:12:12] told me he says he says brother one he
[1:12:14] says all of these brothers
[1:12:17] they started with us
[1:12:20] you know they started with us it's not
[1:12:23] that
[1:12:24] they have got to this level
[1:12:26] before
[1:12:28] they started believing god
[1:12:30] the reason why they can be humble the
[1:12:32] way they are
[1:12:34] because
[1:12:36] they got god before they got to this
[1:12:38] position
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:46] before they got to those positions in
[1:12:48] life
[1:12:50] and
[1:12:54] and sometimes
[1:12:57] it is it is
[1:13:00] i'm trying to look for the best way to
[1:13:03] to be able to say so i will now offend
[1:13:05] you
[1:13:08] i was trying to look for the best polite
[1:13:10] way to say
[1:13:12] so i will now offend ourselves but
[1:13:15] you realize that
[1:13:18] jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:13:20] god
[1:13:23] and his righteousness
[1:13:26] and then all other things will be added
[1:13:28] to you
[1:13:30] praise the lord amen
[1:13:32] and
[1:13:37] i mean they are they are great blessings
[1:13:38] in serving the lord
[1:13:41] if you
[1:13:42] want to
[1:13:43] watch the dance we can send it to you
[1:13:46] later also you can watch it
[1:13:48] but that was some of the reason why i
[1:13:51] wanted to grab that
[1:13:53] those ones with the sisters coming up i
[1:13:55] took those ones actually
[1:13:57] because i was i was
[1:13:59] i was
[1:14:00] seeing that other sister with the baby
[1:14:02] on the back she couldn't hold back she
[1:14:04] wanted to get into the dance i said well
[1:14:06] this one i have to i have to take it
[1:14:08] myself
[1:14:09] praise the lord
[1:14:11] but i mean it was just
[1:14:13] tremendous
[1:14:15] it was tremendous
[1:14:17] and
[1:14:18] and i mean there were
[1:14:19] there were there were just
[1:14:22] thousands of uh
[1:14:25] i mean i mean just
[1:14:26] just blessing
[1:14:28] the last service
[1:14:30] for almost 30 minutes i couldn't say a
[1:14:33] word
[1:14:34] because the presence was just all over
[1:14:36] the place
[1:14:39] you i just you just can't say a word i
[1:14:42] mean the people are worshiping they are
[1:14:44] streaming they are
[1:14:46] the uh you know someone breaking in the
[1:14:48] back in tongues and i mean it was just
[1:14:51] all over the place
[1:14:53] and you can just see the uh
[1:14:56] you know it's it's not the preacher
[1:14:58] that brings that to the people
[1:15:01] it's what the people have it's the
[1:15:03] expectation
[1:15:04] that they have for god so
[1:15:07] i don't think we brought anything
[1:15:08] special to zimbabwe i think i left from
[1:15:11] there being more blessed
[1:15:13] then
[1:15:15] then you know
[1:15:17] even though
[1:15:20] you know all the way around the people
[1:15:21] said they were blessed but i think i was
[1:15:23] more blessed
[1:15:25] i think i was more blessed uh but this
[1:15:28] this really got to me you know it got to
[1:15:30] me just to see
[1:15:32] the humbleness among the brothers and
[1:15:34] many of these people been preaching the
[1:15:36] gospel long time before us
[1:15:38] and but
[1:15:39] they love the lord
[1:15:41] there they love the word
[1:15:44] you know and uh
[1:15:46] and the lawyer brother he says something
[1:15:48] to me and he says he said brother juan
[1:15:50] you know
[1:15:52] when you were preaching
[1:15:54] we were we were listening to you
[1:15:55] carefully you know when when pastor
[1:15:58] chicos he was preaching we were all
[1:15:59] jumping excited because we know him you
[1:16:02] we don't know you
[1:16:06] so we were trying to list him very close
[1:16:08] i told him i said well that's okay
[1:16:11] but uh
[1:16:13] there's uh
[1:16:15] we can okay i send a picture up except
[1:16:18] there's a picture that i send side we
[1:16:21] will see jesus if you can pull that up
[1:16:24] that was the highlight
[1:16:26] of my trip
[1:16:29] this is in the united pentecostal church
[1:16:33] in the united pentecostal church where
[1:16:36] brother chicos is now using for his
[1:16:38] service that's why he's having services
[1:16:40] in in harare
[1:16:43] uh while they are building their church
[1:16:47] so when they moved here
[1:16:50] and started having service they've been
[1:16:52] here for for many years now
[1:16:54] as they are working on their building
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:58] then he said he came across the
[1:17:00] inscription on the puppet and wanted to
[1:17:03] find out
[1:17:04] who put it in
[1:17:07] because this is in the united
[1:17:08] pentecostal church
[1:17:11] and
[1:17:12] so he found out that this was
[1:17:15] a pentecostal missionary from the united
[1:17:18] states
[1:17:20] that built that church
[1:17:22] and he put this inscription on the
[1:17:24] puppet
[1:17:27] and then after following
[1:17:30] uh you know trying to get in contact and
[1:17:32] ignoring the history
[1:17:34] of uh of the minister that did that
[1:17:37] he came to realize there was somebody
[1:17:39] that was acquainted with brother branham
[1:17:43] all ministry
[1:17:44] good
[1:17:46] that was that was that was the quantity
[1:17:47] with brother brandon ministry
[1:17:50] so uh uh
[1:17:52] uh
[1:17:53] yeah i think that was the very first day
[1:17:55] when he picked me up from uh from the
[1:17:57] airport we went to see the putting up of
[1:17:59] the tent and then he wanted to show me
[1:18:02] where they were having service
[1:18:04] and then we were walking around he said
[1:18:05] come let's let me show you something
[1:18:08] you know and then he says uh you know we
[1:18:10] we uh the place they were using you know
[1:18:14] had her problem and he says i went
[1:18:16] before the lord fasting and praying and
[1:18:18] the lord led me here
[1:18:20] and then i came in and i formed favor
[1:18:22] with the people they gave us this
[1:18:23] building
[1:18:24] because uh the church
[1:18:27] uh
[1:18:27] is decreasing in size
[1:18:30] why because the the the pastor that was
[1:18:33] there
[1:18:34] started uh allowing things contrary to
[1:18:37] the scripture
[1:18:38] and uh uh
[1:18:40] walliness and uh you know uh the dress
[1:18:43] code and all of that so the the
[1:18:46] missionary brother that built the church
[1:18:48] decided
[1:18:49] not to work with him
[1:18:51] so then he took a group a big group of
[1:18:53] the people
[1:18:55] and then so there is an old
[1:18:57] uh
[1:18:57] minister brother that stayed there so he
[1:19:00] have a small group of people there so
[1:19:02] brother joseph and his church are
[1:19:04] renting the building
[1:19:06] and they are using the rent to take care
[1:19:07] of their pentecostal pastor
[1:19:10] so they have they have the building to
[1:19:12] themselves they use it uh sunday for
[1:19:15] their services uh
[1:19:17] monday they have a uh their prayer
[1:19:20] meeting and then wednesday friday and
[1:19:23] the rest of it that they use
[1:19:25] so they they're using that building so
[1:19:27] he said when i came and then i saw this
[1:19:30] i knew exactly that uh
[1:19:33] that it was the law's leading
[1:19:36] you know that it was the law's leading
[1:19:38] that the law would lead me right to this
[1:19:40] place and to come and see an inscription
[1:19:43] so we will see jesus
[1:19:45] so i said to myself i'm going to take a
[1:19:47] picture of this
[1:19:49] and i'm going to to do this inscription
[1:19:54] i hope i can do the same
[1:19:56] and put it on the pulpit
[1:19:59] because i think that's what we come to
[1:20:01] church for we come to see jesus
[1:20:03] not to see a man amen
[1:20:06] praise the lord we will see jesus that
[1:20:08] was the highlight
[1:20:10] that was the first day and my trip was
[1:20:12] already filled with wonderful things
[1:20:18] praise the lord
[1:20:20] then i started
[1:20:21] on my way back
[1:20:23] i was listening to the message side we
[1:20:25] will see jesus
[1:20:27] the first uh series that brandon
[1:20:29] preached and then i started looking
[1:20:31] through through the because that was a
[1:20:33] campaign message
[1:20:35] uh i thought that uh that was the most
[1:20:38] preach sermon in the campaign but no
[1:20:41] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:43] and forever was the most preached that
[1:20:45] brother brandon preached in the campaign
[1:20:48] and then next to that was uh
[1:20:51] i think the year jehim series and the
[1:20:54] inside we will see jesus was the third
[1:20:57] most
[1:20:58] message that he preached in the campaign
[1:21:00] series
[1:21:02] so uh all of those things was was what i
[1:21:05] was having fun with on my way back i
[1:21:07] mean
[1:21:09] sleeping and if i can't sleep then i
[1:21:11] start having fun
[1:21:15] looking into those things
[1:21:16] so i would have
[1:21:19] i was going to talk
[1:21:21] i was actually
[1:21:22] thinking to take up side we will see
[1:21:24] jesus
[1:21:27] that's what i thought i was going to
[1:21:28] speak on tonight
[1:21:30] just for an hesitation
[1:21:33] for this prayer meeting i had on my
[1:21:35] heart that we were going to take these
[1:21:37] knees in prayer after i got the call
[1:21:40] from frederick brother
[1:21:42] and then
[1:21:43] all through
[1:21:45] uh uh us being away the text message
[1:21:48] kept coming for our dear sister
[1:21:51] uh uh
[1:21:52] over there in the dc area and
[1:21:56] i just felt like okay when i get back we
[1:21:59] will just have a little time of praying
[1:22:02] and let's let's take these knees to
[1:22:04] heart
[1:22:05] and take them to our prayer chamber amen
[1:22:08] and remember and remember those needs
[1:22:11] that the law would be able to to meet
[1:22:14] those ones
[1:22:16] but then as i was as i was studying in
[1:22:19] reading listening to different things
[1:22:21] then something else came to my mind
[1:22:23] that i would like to share with you
[1:22:26] uh tonight
[1:22:27] so uh
[1:22:30] as we will trust the lord to be our help
[1:22:32] and uh
[1:22:34] this is it for the five so
[1:22:36] uh
[1:22:38] if i should finish by nine o'clock then
[1:22:40] i have 15 minutes to talk to you
[1:22:42] so let's just stand on our feet
[1:22:44] and see
[1:22:46] how the lord will be able to help us
[1:22:48] tonight praise the lord
[1:22:51] uh i thought to to just use
[1:22:54] uh this uh evening
[1:22:56] for a little bit of this report
[1:23:00] because sunday i would like to go into
[1:23:01] something very serious
[1:23:03] and just address some few things and
[1:23:05] then we can get back to our normal life
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:10] praise the lord
[1:23:19] glory be to god
[1:23:22] hallelujah
[1:23:26] there is something that caught my mind
[1:23:30] and uh
[1:23:37] there is something that caught my my
[1:23:39] attention
[1:23:42] and that's what i wanted to share with
[1:23:44] you
[1:23:46] actually
[1:23:47] is uh
[1:23:50] something that uh
[1:23:54] that the prophet of god spoke about
[1:23:58] praise the lord
[1:23:59] let's go in the book of
[1:24:01] joshua
[1:24:17] joshua chapter 6.
[1:24:34] praise the lord
[1:24:44] now because of time
[1:24:46] we will not be able to read the entire
[1:24:48] chapter
[1:24:52] let's read verse 25 and 26 and joshua
[1:24:56] saved rahab the harlot alive
[1:24:59] and her father's household and all
[1:25:03] that she had
[1:25:06] and she'd worked
[1:25:08] in israel even on to this day
[1:25:11] because she had the messengers
[1:25:15] which joshua sent to spy algerico
[1:25:19] and joshua
[1:25:21] enjoyed him
[1:25:23] at that time saying curse
[1:25:26] be
[1:25:28] the man
[1:25:29] before
[1:25:30] the lord
[1:25:32] i want you to listen to these words very
[1:25:35] carefully
[1:25:37] curse be the man
[1:25:39] before the lord
[1:25:42] that rises up and built this city
[1:25:45] jericho
[1:25:48] he shall lay the foundation
[1:25:51] thereof
[1:25:52] in his first bone
[1:25:55] and
[1:25:57] in his youngest son
[1:25:59] shall he set up the gates of egg
[1:26:04] so the lord was with joshua and his
[1:26:06] friend
[1:26:07] was noise throughout all the country
[1:26:11] let us pray
[1:26:12] father
[1:26:14] this inspiration just got on my heart
[1:26:17] lord father sometime today
[1:26:19] but lord i pray that god you will bless
[1:26:22] it
[1:26:22] tonight in and
[1:26:25] just bless your people father

[1:27:10] revelation

[1:27:17] doing we will be tossed about
[1:27:20] with every wings of doctrine
[1:27:22] will be tossed about with every man that
[1:27:25] comes

[1:27:29] and sometimes so godfather will be so
[1:27:33] disturbing our mind lord
[1:27:36] and uh
[1:27:37] but we just want to thank you
[1:27:40] that you have raised up a people that

[1:27:50] we ask that you bless us now and you

[1:27:59] oh god father be raised tonight lord

[1:28:20] the lord will be able to bless us
[1:28:23] praise the lord
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:36] you know
[1:28:39] the word has been
[1:28:42] so amazing to me
[1:28:44] i heard bert branham saying something
[1:28:47] and let me let me see if i can find it
[1:28:49] it's not part of my notes
[1:28:50] it just it just came to my mind right
[1:28:52] now so
[1:28:54] uh
[1:28:55] they won't have it back there
[1:28:58] but uh
[1:29:22] i was i was preaching there in zimbabwe
[1:29:25] and i was preaching on
[1:29:27] uh a message i believe i appreciate
[1:29:29] before uh if not then we will appreciate
[1:29:32] here
[1:29:34] but uh i was actually talking on
[1:29:36] uh junction of time if you if you go
[1:29:39] back and read the jeffersonville series
[1:29:43] that was the first time brother branham
[1:29:44] preached it and he preaches somewhere
[1:29:46] else but completely different than when
[1:29:48] he preached it in in in
[1:29:51] and then he said in that message how
[1:29:55] the lord
[1:29:57] gave him a message for the church
[1:30:00] and what he said was that
[1:30:03] the church was
[1:30:04] standing the threshold
[1:30:08] of the greatest vindication of the
[1:30:11] unimportance
[1:30:13] praise the lord
[1:30:15] what a threshold is
[1:30:17] a threshold is is a doorway
[1:30:21] either a doorway a gateway or a passage
[1:30:25] you know you know a threshold
[1:30:28] so he said
[1:30:29] the church was standing on the threshold
[1:30:33] where
[1:30:35] the church was going to experience
[1:30:39] the vindication of the greatest
[1:30:41] only proteins
[1:30:44] and then i i took a talk
[1:30:46] and i was i was sharing with the with
[1:30:48] the with the believers i don't want to
[1:30:50] go into there let me let me read this if
[1:30:51] if this is not what i'm thinking about
[1:30:54] then i will i will
[1:30:55] i will move on he says i believe that
[1:30:58] god
[1:30:59] never at any time
[1:31:01] nothing miraculous or nothing ever
[1:31:04] taking place unless god falls short
[1:31:07] about his word
[1:31:08] revade it
[1:31:10] place it so that man
[1:31:14] who failed to walk in it
[1:31:18] he says
[1:31:20] who have to stand before him
[1:31:23] and he will
[1:31:25] he says they will have to stand without
[1:31:27] an excuse
[1:31:30] because god make it so plain
[1:31:35] that
[1:31:36] if a man is concerned enough this was
[1:31:39] what struck me
[1:31:41] god made his word so plain
[1:31:45] that if a man
[1:31:47] is concerned enough
[1:31:51] about it
[1:31:53] he will find it
[1:31:58] if you are concerned
[1:32:02] praise the lord
[1:32:07] this word is so rich
[1:32:11] i mean there are just so many things
[1:32:12] here
[1:32:14] you know
[1:32:15] he says that if a man is concerned
[1:32:18] enough
[1:32:20] about it he will find it
[1:32:23] praise the lord
[1:32:24] sometimes it it seems to be like uh you
[1:32:28] know uh uh to others that you know maybe
[1:32:31] uh
[1:32:32] uh we we uh
[1:32:34] we
[1:32:35] we uh trying to look for things
[1:32:38] but you see just like brother branham
[1:32:41] explained in the opening of the seals he
[1:32:43] says these seals open just like a rocket
[1:32:47] he says there was there is one explosion
[1:32:51] and then
[1:32:52] uh the the the particles from from that
[1:32:55] big explosion when and exploded
[1:32:59] he says and from that explosion they
[1:33:01] explode and on the other side the one
[1:33:03] that when they explode and it just went
[1:33:05] from explosion explosion explosion
[1:33:09] explosion the rapture would be one
[1:33:11] explosion that would take us to heaven
[1:33:13] the burning of this f would be one ex
[1:33:15] because it's all in the word
[1:33:17] everything that is fulfilling is just an
[1:33:20] explosion of god's word praise the lord
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] well the reason why
[1:33:26] uh a akovic kind of for shock us is
[1:33:30] because it's an explosion
[1:33:32] a prophet talked about plagues coming
[1:33:34] upon the earth
[1:33:35] amen and many of us thought in our mind
[1:33:38] you know because we are in the message
[1:33:41] the brow will be gone that's the reason
[1:33:43] why some people thought we were in the
[1:33:45] tribulation
[1:33:48] but it's just an explosion
[1:33:50] it's it's it's an opening you know what
[1:33:52] uh the world will open it will open in
[1:33:55] different dimensions it will open in
[1:33:56] different way even in our very lives
[1:34:01] but you see the ones
[1:34:03] that uh these things are real talk
[1:34:07] are the ones that are concerned enough
[1:34:11] there are other people they are not
[1:34:12] concerned
[1:34:14] to them they are baptized in jesus
[1:34:16] name they believe the message so to them
[1:34:19] is i mean
[1:34:21] they are bright they are they are in the
[1:34:22] message
[1:34:24] but to the ones that are concerned
[1:34:26] enough
[1:34:28] you can go from one explosion to another
[1:34:31] explosion
[1:34:33] because the word keeps opening
[1:34:37] the word keeps unveiling
[1:34:40] the word keep loosening
[1:34:43] is just the same word
[1:34:45] it's the same word it's the same word
[1:34:47] it's just use of words
[1:34:50] revealing loosening opening exploring is
[1:34:52] the same word
[1:34:54] praise the lord so he says to the ones
[1:34:57] that are concerned enough about it
[1:35:00] he will found it right
[1:35:02] if you are concerned
[1:35:05] praise the lord
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:08] and like i've always said to you when
[1:35:10] you read the word
[1:35:12] whether is a scripture or the message of
[1:35:15] the hour and something stand out to you
[1:35:19] it's an opportunity that the holy spirit
[1:35:22] is giving you
[1:35:24] amen
[1:35:25] now when you understand it when you
[1:35:27] don't understand it
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:30] when it stands out to you and you don't
[1:35:32] understand it
[1:35:35] god is giving you an opportunity
[1:35:39] to show you something
[1:35:42] but the problem there is like brother
[1:35:44] branham said in christ is the mystery of
[1:35:46] god reveal we are too lazy
[1:35:51] and we allow
[1:35:53] petty things
[1:35:57] to take us
[1:35:58] away from that glorious experience
[1:36:04] praise the lord
[1:36:05] so let's look into what we want to share
[1:36:07] share with you tonight
[1:36:09] uh
[1:36:12] i hope i hope i will not get on the
[1:36:14] rabbit tray with this amen
[1:36:17] because when i start these kind of
[1:36:18] things
[1:36:19] it's how this is not this is not pretty
[1:36:21] much very it's not very organized now
[1:36:24] brother branham
[1:36:25] will will will take
[1:36:27] we'll take this okay we we we read this
[1:36:30] we read joshua promise let's look also
[1:36:33] in the book of kings let's look at the
[1:36:35] fulfillment
[1:36:37] what is the fulfillment but let's look
[1:36:40] at
[1:36:40] uh first king chapter
[1:36:43] 16.
[1:36:44] now remember now joshua
[1:36:48] brought rahab
[1:36:50] out of the land of jericho
[1:36:54] and by the marching around jericho the
[1:36:57] walls of the city fell
[1:36:59] praise the lord
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:01] it was not imaginary wars the walls
[1:37:04] actually fell down
[1:37:08] praise the lord
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:10] the walls actually fell down
[1:37:14] just like brother branham talked about
[1:37:16] the coming down of the berlin wall you
[1:37:18] saw it in the vision he said it and it
[1:37:20] did happen
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:27] so
[1:37:29] yeah joshua now
[1:37:31] he cursed the city
[1:37:35] and i love what he said
[1:37:38] as we just read it in the scripture
[1:37:41] curse be the man before the lord
[1:37:45] because that is very prophetic
[1:37:51] that just that just kind of forgot my
[1:37:53] mind today i was i was just i was just
[1:37:55] somewhere else completely first king
[1:37:57] chapter 16 verse 34 follow me in a
[1:38:00] little bit now
[1:38:01] let's read the last verse the bible says
[1:38:04] that in verse 33
[1:38:05] first kings 16 33 and ahab made a growth
[1:38:08] and ahab did more to provoke the lord
[1:38:12] god of israel to anger than all the
[1:38:16] kings
[1:38:18] of israel that were before him amen he
[1:38:21] did more why because he got married
[1:38:25] to idolatry
[1:38:28] praise the lord the other people
[1:38:30] practice it but he he went and married
[1:38:33] the princess
[1:38:34] of uh of uh
[1:38:36] uh the adult worshipper
[1:38:39] uh
[1:38:39] god or priest
[1:38:41] jesse bell
[1:38:44] that's what she was so he actually
[1:38:46] married
[1:38:47] uh idolatry
[1:38:49] which was a very perfect type
[1:38:51] of uh
[1:38:53] pagan room
[1:38:55] the church getting married to pig in
[1:38:57] rome
[1:39:03] in his days
[1:39:05] verse 34
[1:39:06] did he help the
[1:39:10] the belterlites which is a man of belter
[1:39:14] built jericho
[1:39:17] he led the foundation
[1:39:19] thereof
[1:39:20] in ibiram his firstborn
[1:39:24] praise the lord
[1:39:26] and he set up the gates
[1:39:29] thereof
[1:39:30] in his youngest son
[1:39:33] shiego whatever the right pronunciation
[1:39:36] is
[1:39:37] according to the word of the lord which
[1:39:40] he speak by joshua
[1:39:43] the son of gnome
[1:39:45] the interesting part of this whole thing
[1:39:48] is that joshua gave a prophecy
[1:39:52] praise the lord and
[1:39:54] right in the time of ahab
[1:39:57] just before
[1:39:59] uh uh
[1:40:00] the prophet elijah will step on the
[1:40:03] scene because the next chapter one will
[1:40:06] talk about elijah the tishma
[1:40:12] just before the prophet elijah would
[1:40:14] step on the scene
[1:40:19] god in his design his intelligence
[1:40:26] to god the details does not matter
[1:40:30] praise the lord
[1:40:32] because this man
[1:40:34] that uh that that that built this city
[1:40:37] in the blood of his firstborn there was
[1:40:39] a day that he was born he got a birthday
[1:40:42] just like you get birthday you like your
[1:40:44] birthday
[1:40:46] the scripture did not
[1:40:48] recorded his birthday
[1:40:50] he might have gone to school the
[1:40:52] scripture did not record it he got
[1:40:54] married before he had the children the
[1:40:56] scripture did not recall it
[1:40:59] just in one verse
[1:41:04] praise the lord
[1:41:06] and that will be the only verse in the
[1:41:09] bible
[1:41:12] that will deal with that prophecy now
[1:41:16] what i'm trying to bring to your mind is
[1:41:19] to help us to realize
[1:41:21] how much it was important to almighty
[1:41:24] god
[1:41:26] to make sure that the word that his
[1:41:28] seven joshua the prophet spoke
[1:41:32] have to come to pass
[1:41:37] praise the lord
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:41] and in the
[1:41:42] in the in in in in in the right
[1:41:45] description the bible just like joshua
[1:41:48] the prophet said he laid the foundation
[1:41:52] in a beer of his firstborn
[1:41:54] and he raised the gifts of the city
[1:42:00] in the blood of his younger son just
[1:42:02] exactly like the prophet joshua said
[1:42:09] the word of god never fails
[1:42:13] amen
[1:42:15] praise the lord
[1:42:20] now
[1:42:22] but when joshua prophesied
[1:42:26] he said
[1:42:29] curse be the man
[1:42:31] before the lord
[1:42:36] praise the lord
[1:42:38] cursed be the man before the lord
[1:42:42] hallelujah
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:56] now but then if you follow the scripture
[1:42:59] you follow you follow the scripture you
[1:43:02] will see that there is there's something
[1:43:04] i want to
[1:43:05] i want to get to your mind yet i hope uh
[1:43:08] i didn't i didn't look over it now yeah
[1:43:11] in the message in the message bla
[1:43:13] botimus
[1:43:14] bert branham will talk about the city of
[1:43:17] jericho
[1:43:19] and there's a way that the prophet
[1:43:23] we'll talk about it but i want you to
[1:43:25] follow me a little bit
[1:43:27] because you're going to see some
[1:43:28] contracts here
[1:43:33] he says but this this poor blind man
[1:43:37] sitting outside the the big weakest city
[1:43:41] always was a weaker city talking about
[1:43:44] jericho now jericho was always a weakest
[1:43:47] city now brother branham will talk just
[1:43:49] because of time you can go and look
[1:43:51] through it he would talk here
[1:43:53] describing jericho as a weakest city he
[1:43:56] goes back to the story of of uh uh
[1:44:01] the book of joshua
[1:44:03] and and and and and you know and and
[1:44:06] show
[1:44:07] how it was the curse of joshua
[1:44:10] make the city
[1:44:12] became a continuous wicked city
[1:44:17] he would take
[1:44:18] the story of the good samaritan
[1:44:22] to show that
[1:44:24] when jesus talked about the good
[1:44:26] samaritan
[1:44:27] he he talked about a man coming
[1:44:30] from uh uh
[1:44:32] a jericho
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:36] the good samaritan he was he was
[1:44:38] hijacked by the people that beat him
[1:44:41] all that beat the man
[1:44:43] because it was a good samaritan to help
[1:44:46] right let me get my story right now oh
[1:44:49] yes i have to go back to sunday school
[1:44:52] it was a good samaritan i had the man
[1:44:54] that was that was that was rob
[1:44:56] praise the lord
[1:44:58] so he was talking he he talks about how
[1:45:01] the man came from a backsliding state
[1:45:03] because jericho was a backsliding city
[1:45:08] praise the lord
[1:45:10] are we together
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] but you see
[1:45:15] oh my goodness
[1:45:18] are we together
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:23] let me read this uh uh divine healing
[1:45:26] 1954
[1:45:27] sitting there in that condition and
[1:45:30] after a while i imagine he
[1:45:33] he began let's let's imagine he's
[1:45:35] thinking now he's talking again about
[1:45:38] the condition of lamborghini sitting
[1:45:40] right in the corner at the gate
[1:45:42] of jericho
[1:45:44] now
[1:45:45] this was the very same gate
[1:45:48] that this man had to raise in the blood
[1:45:51] of his youngest son
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:56] amen
[1:45:58] but
[1:45:59] what
[1:46:00] what is hating
[1:46:02] that we don't see
[1:46:05] is what i pray that holy spirit will be
[1:46:08] able to show us
[1:46:10] glory be to god
[1:46:12] sitting there let's imagine he's
[1:46:14] thinking in his mind he's talking about
[1:46:16] blah blah timbers maybe he reached out
[1:46:18] his hand across
[1:46:20] the curb and he and and he rubbed the
[1:46:23] stones on the street think many years
[1:46:25] ago
[1:46:27] blah blah team was thinking now many
[1:46:28] years ago joshua
[1:46:31] the great conqueror in god's army led
[1:46:34] the children of israel
[1:46:38] right up that same road
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:44] not only that but right
[1:46:47] not very far from that same gate
[1:46:51] joshua was wandering
[1:46:55] around one day
[1:46:56] and he met a man
[1:46:59] who drew the sword
[1:47:02] praise the lord
[1:47:03] now so what i want you to realize is
[1:47:06] that that place was not always a cursed
[1:47:10] place
[1:47:14] praise the lord
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:20] we know that uh uh uh
[1:47:24] uh god
[1:47:25] sent a joshua and his men this was the
[1:47:29] possession of the of of of the promised
[1:47:33] land god was giving his people the
[1:47:35] promised land and then and uh uh
[1:47:38] rehab came out of the land and here is
[1:47:41] joshua he sees he's he sees uh he's
[1:47:44] cursing the land and cursed be the man
[1:47:47] that will that will that would build
[1:47:49] this city he will have to do it in the
[1:47:51] blood of his first son and his youngest
[1:47:53] son if you don't see alpha and omega in
[1:47:56] there just wait a while you will see it
[1:48:04] and and joshua he says the the the the
[1:48:07] conqueror in god's army led the churn of
[1:48:10] israel right up
[1:48:13] that roar
[1:48:15] not only that
[1:48:18] but right
[1:48:20] not very far from that same gate joshua
[1:48:23] was wandering around and he and he met
[1:48:27] a man who drew the sword
[1:48:31] and claimed to be the captain of the
[1:48:32] host of the lord
[1:48:34] jesus christ himself
[1:48:36] standing there in person
[1:48:39] just outside of the gate
[1:48:42] over that same road 800 years before
[1:48:46] come elijah any larger
[1:48:50] on
[1:48:51] that role
[1:48:53] to jobbing
[1:48:54] and elijah was going to be taken up
[1:48:58] now you have to realize that in the
[1:49:00] taking off of elijah jericho was
[1:49:03] mentioned
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:12] praise the lord
[1:49:14] jericho was mentioned
[1:49:19] and elijah on the road to jericholan uh
[1:49:22] uh and elijah was going to be taken up
[1:49:24] in a in a real winning and he last shot
[1:49:27] a double portion of the spirit on that
[1:49:30] same road
[1:49:33] on the jericho road
[1:49:36] there's a song called on the jericho
[1:49:38] road
[1:49:39] praise the lord
[1:49:41] i couldn't get my internet on the flower
[1:49:42] as we'll be singing it tonight you know
[1:49:44] me last night it comes to my mind i send
[1:49:46] you up straight
[1:49:51] he says but
[1:49:52] they're all
[1:49:55] the poor old blind beggar the priest had
[1:49:58] told him
[1:50:00] listen now the priest had told him the
[1:50:02] clergy of the day
[1:50:04] then things
[1:50:06] are passed away see the comparison he's
[1:50:08] making
[1:50:10] the priests
[1:50:12] misinterpreting the word and giving
[1:50:15] blame but timos a wrong understanding
[1:50:19] of what god have done
[1:50:22] praise the lord let me take it for
[1:50:24] example making blah blah blah this place
[1:50:28] was cursed
[1:50:30] joshua our great army cursed this place
[1:50:34] no wonder you are just a beggar you
[1:50:36] might you might remain a beggar and die
[1:50:38] a beggar because you are standing in a
[1:50:40] cursed place
[1:50:45] praise the lord
[1:50:47] amen
[1:50:50] and and and and the clergy of that day
[1:50:53] cease is like that and i'm without doubt
[1:50:56] that many of the clergy today sees it
[1:50:59] the same
[1:51:04] praise the lord because until god opened
[1:51:07] your eyes i've always seen jericho that
[1:51:10] way as a cursed city
[1:51:15] but that was just before the coming of
[1:51:17] the prophet elijah
[1:51:20] just before a mighty prophet would step
[1:51:22] on the scene god raised up a man
[1:51:30] to be able to redeem that city
[1:51:34] he had to build a city in the blood of
[1:51:38] his firstborn
[1:51:41] praise the lord
[1:51:43] go back to the scripture
[1:51:46] for time's sake
[1:51:49] we will not read
[1:51:50] all about it
[1:51:52] but what is the name of the man is spell
[1:51:54] h
[1:51:56] i e l
[1:51:59] what does he names means
[1:52:04] what does he means means
[1:52:10] oh my goodness
[1:52:14] praise the lord
[1:52:16] what is the meaning of his name
[1:52:26] brother branham tells us about how the
[1:52:28] bible is written between the lines
[1:52:33] and sometimes god will just put just one
[1:52:36] word
[1:52:41] and nothing more there is another
[1:52:44] scripture in the book of judges i could
[1:52:46] show you tonight time will not allow us
[1:52:49] just one friend he was a judge in israel
[1:52:51] but the bible only just said one just
[1:52:55] one verse about nothing more about him
[1:52:59] and sometimes
[1:53:01] you having internal glory package
[1:53:06] just in that one verse
[1:53:10] praise the lord
[1:53:13] the meaning of this man name
[1:53:15] means
[1:53:17] you have to realize now the prophet of
[1:53:19] god taught us what el means
[1:53:22] every time you see el in a
[1:53:24] word l
[1:53:27] it means god
[1:53:33] praise the lord
[1:53:35] it means god
[1:53:37] for god so love the word
[1:53:43] amen praise the lord
[1:53:45] that he will redeem the earth in the
[1:53:47] blood of his own begotten son
[1:54:01] means the life of god god lives
[1:54:05] that's right
[1:54:10] praise the lord
[1:54:11] if you are concerned enough
[1:54:14] that's why the prophet that's why my
[1:54:16] prophet told me that if i'm concerned
[1:54:18] enough
[1:54:23] if jericho was just such a cursed place
[1:54:29] why would god recall it in
[1:54:32] a larger rapturing message
[1:54:37] what a beautiful story of blind by timos
[1:54:40] do you realize that that jesus visited
[1:54:44] uh zacchaeus in jericho
[1:54:48] and he said salvation has come to your
[1:54:50] house
[1:54:58] praise the lord
[1:55:03] what did what did
[1:55:05] uh uh uh joshua said
[1:55:07] what what did he say
[1:55:09] curse be the man before
[1:55:12] the lord
[1:55:17] so the man that was going to do this was
[1:55:19] honor prophecy
[1:55:23] he was on a divine prophecy
[1:55:28] just like abraham sacrificing his own
[1:55:32] son
[1:55:34] just like japan sacrificing his own
[1:55:37] beloved daughter
[1:55:39] for the redemption of israel
[1:55:41] there will be a man that will raise up a
[1:55:44] city that was cursed
[1:55:46] amen
[1:55:47] in the blood of his only son
[1:55:58] praise the lord
[1:56:04] brother branham says how those old
[1:56:06] testament characters
[1:56:08] never even knew that god
[1:56:10] was writing divine scripture
[1:56:13] in their lives
[1:56:17] praise the lord
[1:56:18] was he the king of jericho
[1:56:21] was he the king why should he sacrifice
[1:56:23] his own son
[1:56:25] to redeem that
[1:56:26] city why
[1:56:31] but he was on the prophecy
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:36] he was on a divine prophecy
[1:56:39] because on that same jericho road the
[1:56:43] son of god was going to walk one day
[1:56:45] on that same jericho road a prophet
[1:56:51] amen
[1:56:52] elijah was going to use that road
[1:56:56] so there had to be a man that would rise
[1:56:58] up on the same
[1:56:59] to take the curse away
[1:57:04] glory be to god
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:07] if jericho was so cursed jesus would not
[1:57:10] meet zacchaeus and jericho
[1:57:21] oh my
[1:57:23] praise the lord
[1:57:25] hallelujah
[1:57:27] amen
[1:57:29] brother branham said he says here god
[1:57:31] provide a way he says he says this is
[1:57:34] the time to
[1:57:36] shout he says the walls
[1:57:39] of jericho
[1:57:41] as it was
[1:57:43] the enemy
[1:57:46] that's keeping you out
[1:57:49] praise the lord
[1:57:51] will fall to the ground
[1:57:53] now see the type that he's bringing amen
[1:57:58] see the type that brother branham is
[1:58:01] comparing jericho with
[1:58:04] praise the lord amen he said even the
[1:58:07] way that god designed the city he said
[1:58:09] jerusalem is up on the hill
[1:58:12] and jericho is down in the valley
[1:58:19] geographically god just display it like
[1:58:22] that
[1:58:27] it was not only because of the physical
[1:58:29] lane
[1:58:31] when jesus talked about the story of the
[1:58:33] about a good samaritan he was talking
[1:58:36] about our our state
[1:58:40] our backslidden state we are born in
[1:58:42] this curse
[1:58:45] our first birth water it was in the the
[1:58:48] the the good way hospital or it was in
[1:58:51] male hospital whatever it was we were
[1:58:53] born under this curse
[1:58:56] praise the lord
[1:58:57] and on our first birth we were rap
[1:59:00] just like that man from jericho
[1:59:04] but we were on our way to jerusalem up
[1:59:06] the hill
[1:59:09] praise the lord jerusalem was our
[1:59:11] destiny
[1:59:14] and god had to send a good samaritan
[1:59:16] this message of the hour is our good
[1:59:18] samaritan that took us in our state and
[1:59:22] put us in the key of the holy ghost
[1:59:31] why because god
[1:59:33] lives
[1:59:36] and because he led i can face tomorrow
[1:59:43] because he live i can face tomorrow
[1:59:46] oh my goodness this kind of a thing can
[1:59:48] just make me crazy
[1:59:50] because i'm telling you i'm enjoying it
[1:59:52] more than i'm preaching it
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] so i don't care whether you enjoy it or
[1:59:57] not it's making more sense to me
[2:00:06] praise the lord
[2:00:11] you think about it
[2:00:13] jericho was part of the land that joshua
[2:00:15] was supposed to possess
[2:00:18] it was part of their inheritance
[2:00:23] you think about it
[2:00:26] it was all part of their inheritance

[2:08:06] amen can you help me
[2:08:09] oh i owe mine i taught god
[2:08:14] you were witness that
[2:08:17] these stones would cry out

[2:08:24] i just put my hands over his eyes
[2:08:27] and i said father
[2:08:30] i do not understand
[2:08:33] i said
[2:08:35] you sent the brother here
[2:08:38] i asked for his sight
[2:08:42] and i took my hands down
[2:08:46] seeing him smiling
[2:08:48] wiping his eyes looking around
[2:08:52] and kind of smiled said
[2:08:55] i can see honey
[2:09:01] she said
[2:09:03] you see honey
[2:09:05] said show
[2:09:06] see them people there
[2:09:09] that red car sitting behind
[2:09:12] she fell down on her knees
[2:09:15] and strained to the top of her voice
[2:09:20] praise the lord
[2:09:22] amen
[2:09:25] now what i want to grab your attention
[2:09:27] in tonight
[2:09:30] praise the lord
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:36] you see the scripture
[2:09:39] is god's word
[2:09:42] the scripture is not english
[2:09:46] it's not french
[2:09:49] it's not chinese
[2:09:51] not spanish whichever language you are
[2:09:54] perfect in
[2:09:55] the english
[2:09:56] is the word of god
[2:10:00] and lying on those pages
[2:10:06] there are millions of words and range
[2:10:10] that you can break into
[2:10:12] yeah
[2:10:15] and they can change your life
[2:10:19] praise the lord
[2:10:25] little joshua kneel
[2:10:28] that he was prophesying i mean i was
[2:10:30] just reading a lot of quotes today i
[2:10:31] didn't have time to put every one of
[2:10:33] them together because i knew that i mean
[2:10:36] i will run out of time tonight if i want
[2:10:38] to show you video and all of that
[2:10:42] but it just cut my heart
[2:10:44] you know after
[2:10:49] seeing how the word there with me this
[2:10:51] weekend
[2:10:52] it just caught my heart to kind of look
[2:10:54] at
[2:10:55] that entire
[2:10:57] picture a different way
[2:10:59] sure
[2:11:01] praise the lord
[2:11:04] amen
[2:11:06] because we realize that
[2:11:08] after after the scripture you even go
[2:11:12] and read the book of ezra
[2:11:14] you will see when ezra
[2:11:16] the rebuilding of the city
[2:11:19] and and the different tribes and the
[2:11:21] different people that were giving back
[2:11:23] to their city jericho was also
[2:11:26] jericho was given to the people that it
[2:11:28] belongs to it was counted
[2:11:31] now so if if if you only take the tot
[2:11:36] of jericho being a cursed city
[2:11:39] you will miss the complete picture
[2:11:43] because the emphasis the emphasis under
[2:11:47] that prophecy
[2:11:49] is cursed be the man before
[2:11:53] the lord
[2:11:57] praise the lord
[2:11:58] amen
[2:12:01] which sounds to me that god
[2:12:04] was going to use a man
[2:12:07] to wipe away the curse from upon the
[2:12:10] city
[2:12:11] god was going to use a man
[2:12:16] that was that that was that was going to
[2:12:18] use the blood of his firstborn whatever
[2:12:21] it takes to be able to redeem this city
[2:12:24] back
[2:12:26] because it was an inheritance for israel
[2:12:30] if ezra divided it to the people
[2:12:33] it was an inheritance that people god
[2:12:35] was going to use a man
[2:12:37] to redeem the city back
[2:12:40] and if he was going to take the life of
[2:12:42] his firstborn
[2:12:45] right
[2:12:46] just to be able to bring
[2:12:50] the glory of jericho back
[2:12:54] praise the lord
[2:12:55] hallelujah
[2:12:57] knowing that a prophet elijah was going
[2:13:00] to come and that was going to be his
[2:13:02] path to the rapture
[2:13:04] knowing that our lord jesus was going to
[2:13:06] come and he was going to meet a blind
[2:13:08] man right on that very same jericho road
[2:13:13] praise the lord
[2:13:14] do you know when brother brahm talks
[2:13:16] about the samaritan woman when he said
[2:13:18] that jesus passed the jericho wrote
[2:13:23] to go over to samira
[2:13:31] so what what do jericho represent for
[2:13:34] the believers
[2:13:40] praise the lord
[2:13:42] just like all the land in canada did
[2:13:45] represent there were land that were
[2:13:47] possessed
[2:13:49] by the inhabitants of the land
[2:13:51] and just like how this this our body was
[2:13:54] possessed
[2:13:56] by our affluent nature
[2:13:58] it was possessed by all the genes that
[2:14:01] came from our grandparents and
[2:14:02] great-grandparents that's all we deal
[2:14:04] with in this body
[2:14:06] praise the lord
[2:14:07] but a man has to give the life of his
[2:14:10] owner's first son
[2:14:13] praise the lord
[2:14:15] it was the life of his firstborn
[2:14:18] and it became also the life of the
[2:14:21] youngest one because the embarrassing
[2:14:23] life that was giving came back on the
[2:14:25] days of pentecost
[2:14:27] to do it among the believers
[2:14:29] that's the thing that redeemed our land
[2:14:31] that's the thing that makes us any
[2:14:33] better before god
[2:14:35] it's not what we do is what god has
[2:14:37] given
[2:14:38] he gave his own life on the cross of
[2:14:40] calvary it was not enough he sent the
[2:14:43] spirit that was in that life back on the
[2:14:45] church
[2:14:46] [Music]
[2:14:54] praise the lord amen
[2:14:56] that man was god himself
[2:15:04] the story of redemption is all over the
[2:15:07] bible
[2:15:08] it's all over the bible
[2:15:11] it does not give you any chance
[2:15:14] for you to rely on your merit
[2:15:17] it doesn't give you it does not make any
[2:15:19] provision
[2:15:20] for you to trust in your strength or
[2:15:23] trust in your self-righteousness
[2:15:25] because redemption is all over the bible
[2:15:34] praise the lord amen
[2:15:36] amen
[2:15:39] now god can get healing
[2:15:41] out of jericho road
[2:15:44] on jericho road he can say salvation has
[2:15:47] come to your house zacchaeus
[2:15:51] he can use jericho road
[2:15:53] and go and find a woman that was
[2:15:56] captured
[2:15:58] in prostitution
[2:16:01] because one man was under prophecy
[2:16:05] one man
[2:16:08] can you imagine
[2:16:10] that man so being so he been so taken to
[2:16:14] heart
[2:16:15] for the satan of jericho
[2:16:19] that he would take his firstborn
[2:16:25] i don't believe that i mean he he
[2:16:27] sacrificed his son
[2:16:30] but whatever that he had to do
[2:16:33] to get back that city it would cause the
[2:16:35] life of his firstborn
[2:16:39] praise the lord
[2:16:41] and then when he goes back to building
[2:16:43] the walls
[2:16:44] or putting up the gates
[2:16:47] maybe his little young son tried to help
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:51] and the gate fell on his shoulder
[2:16:54] and he also died why
[2:16:56] because a prophet said it right
[2:17:00] and it was going to be a new testament
[2:17:03] type for you and myself
[2:17:13] let's stand on our feet tonight
[2:17:18] if you are concerned
[2:17:26] enough god
[2:17:29] we're open to your understanding
[2:17:32] more than what is written in the letters
[2:17:35] praise the lord
[2:17:37] do you know how much
[2:17:40] those clergy and priests who have
[2:17:42] discouraged
[2:17:46] blam batimus
[2:17:49] didn't you read in a scripture that this
[2:17:51] place is a cursed land
[2:17:54] oh you come to this kid of jericho whole
[2:17:56] day
[2:17:59] no wonder why your life can never be
[2:18:00] better
[2:18:02] but there was something in his heart
[2:18:04] like brother branham said
[2:18:05] he remember it was on that same jericho
[2:18:08] road that joshua made the angel of the
[2:18:11] lord
[2:18:12] when the angel drew his sword
[2:18:15] he said he remember it was at that very
[2:18:18] same gate of jericho
[2:18:25] so
[2:18:38] the prophet of god says
[2:18:39] misinterpretation
[2:18:41] of the word has handled the church
[2:18:45] has limited the church from their
[2:18:47] blessing
[2:18:50] we have created so much fear
[2:18:52] in the people that they cannot reach out
[2:18:54] to god they cannot be able to reach out
[2:18:57] and step out of their situation
[2:19:02] god has made provision all over the
[2:19:05] scriptures
[2:19:06] for us not to live on our cursed life
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:21] praise the lord
[2:19:24] because that's what the holy ghost comes
[2:19:26] to deal with
[2:19:29] the holy ghost comes to deal with the
[2:19:31] curse
[2:19:32] of sin
[2:19:35] when the holy ghost comes in the
[2:19:36] believer it deals with the curse
[2:19:40] that's why we still get sick
[2:19:42] even though we get the holy ghost we
[2:19:44] still get sick
[2:19:45] why
[2:19:47] because the curse is dealt with
[2:19:50] and because the curse is there with the
[2:19:53] desire to do wrong the desire to live in
[2:19:56] sin is not there
[2:19:59] it does not mean that we are not tempted
[2:20:02] it does not means that they are not
[2:20:04] things that we are dealing with but the
[2:20:06] holy ghost comes it burn out the curse
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:21] but you see when when the word is not
[2:20:23] rightly taught
[2:20:27] it puts you in a place when you are
[2:20:29] dealing with these things it makes you
[2:20:30] to feel like oh i don't have the holy
[2:20:32] ghost because if i had the holy ghost i
[2:20:34] would not be in this situation no the
[2:20:37] whole wash your motive and your
[2:20:39] objective
[2:20:40] what's your desire what are the things
[2:20:42] that you are desiring
[2:20:46] if your desire is fulfilled if your
[2:20:49] desire is for those things that are
[2:20:50] wrong then you need the holy ghost
[2:20:52] because that curse has not been
[2:20:54] destroyed
[2:20:58] but if your desire is for more of god
[2:21:02] but your mind is battle
[2:21:05] praise the lord
[2:21:06] oh just hold on to that desire because
[2:21:09] when the deep corners unto the deep
[2:21:12] there is a deep to respond
[2:21:14] if there is a desire more of god there
[2:21:17] is a god to feel that desire
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:39] i am
[2:21:49] [Applause]
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:22:01] yes
[2:22:04] [Music]
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:39] forever
[2:22:44] [Music]
[2:22:58] oh
[2:23:01] [Music]
[2:23:11] [Music]
[2:23:13] [Applause]
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:30] [Music]
[2:23:38] [Music]
[2:23:45] praise the lord let you speak to the
[2:23:47] lord tonight
[2:23:49] hallelujah
[2:23:53] god has made provision
[2:23:55] all all in this world
[2:23:59] i don't know
[2:24:01] what you are dealing with
[2:24:03] that the blood is not enough
[2:24:06] to settle
[2:24:08] i don't know what you're dealing with in
[2:24:09] your life
[2:24:10] i don't know what the devil is using to
[2:24:12] condemn you
[2:24:14] that the blood is not enough to settle
[2:24:17] when jesus said on the cross that it is
[2:24:19] finished
[2:24:21] they wrap up all the old testament types
[2:24:24] everything that represents a redemption
[2:24:26] in the old testament
[2:24:28] was wrapped up in that statement
[2:24:39] problem said we are limiting god by our
[2:24:41] faith
[2:24:43] we need to be stretching out into the
[2:24:45] promised world
[2:24:47] we need to be seen more than what the
[2:24:49] letters is written looking behind the
[2:24:52] prince
[2:24:53] looking and seeing what god has heard in
[2:24:56] his word
[2:24:58] heavenly father
[2:25:00] almighty god thank you for the wednesday
[2:25:02] night lord we can be back lord jesus and
[2:25:05] tamil father lord in fellowship with
[2:25:07] your children

[2:25:12] father god lord jesus
[2:25:14] like your prophet said lord in the
[2:25:16] message

[2:25:20] the earth that's the way you deal with
[2:25:22] the bride lord you deal with your people
[2:25:24] precious law we see a representation of
[2:25:27] god father in jericho but lord god more
[2:25:30] than lord father god lord it was just a
[2:25:34] shout of your people that brought the
[2:25:35] walls of jericho down and oh god if we

[2:25:41] message of the hour lord it's not our
