[28:23] so so good
[28:24] amen amen and i will start up
[28:29] just you know but steve came back then
[28:31] and i told him
[28:32] as university we always had internet in
[28:34] this church
[28:36] it's now that the church is paying for
[28:38] it
[28:40] our church our church is not a village
[28:43] church
[28:45] it's not now that we are catching up
[28:47] with technology
[28:50] praise the lord i believe sometime back
[28:54] even through the church we got a hot
[28:57] spot
[28:58] but lloyd worked on that from a t
[29:01] but then we were constantly
[29:06] being charged more so then we decided to
[29:10] go into something else
[29:12] and then we we got another uh
[29:16] hotspot well we at the time
[29:20] the church was not fully on board to
[29:24] cover the expenses of of that
[29:27] of us having internet so we had to do it
[29:33] personally how to put it on my account
[29:36] so
[29:37] then when the church got her internet i
[29:39] took their hospital home
[29:41] so uh it's still serving me praise the
[29:44] lord
[29:46] and uh yeah so
[29:50] i mean we we we had to go to
[29:54] uh hosting a uh
[29:58] paying for the internet as a church
[30:00] because
[30:01] one of our website and to live streaming
[30:05] we needed more speed than than the
[30:08] hotspot crew
[30:10] offer us so that's the reason why
[30:13] we had to go to death praise the lord
[30:17] but we we are so glad that it came in
[30:21] time and
[30:22] once again we want to say the thanks
[30:25] to to each and every one of you that
[30:28] have chosen this place as a church to
[30:31] make it home
[30:32] and and have also
[30:36] uh dedicate yourself to support
[30:39] what we do from the corner of this
[30:42] street amen
[30:48] thank you for all your support your
[30:50] presence
[30:52] and uh and your financial support and
[30:55] ties and offering and all of that
[30:58] well i wish deborah steve will have
[31:01] talked to me
[31:02] about the suggestion of having the
[31:04] meeting
[31:05] to decide the pastor's salary
[31:09] you know that is never done
[31:12] is now strictural so i don't think we're
[31:15] going to have that meeting
[31:18] so but i'll talk to the officers about
[31:20] it
[31:21] i wish you have talked to me about it i
[31:24] i don't think
[31:24] it's stricture it's not it's not done
[31:27] so because if you choose to pay me
[31:33] five million dollar the day i start to
[31:36] preach wrong and everybody leave the
[31:38] church
[31:39] then we will have to sell the property
[31:41] for you to keep healing me
[31:44] so that is not structural
[31:47] as as much as i'm concerned so let's
[31:50] talk about it
[31:51] with the officers but for now uh i don't
[31:55] expect that we'll have a meeting like
[31:56] that
[31:58] or we should have a meeting like that
[32:01] i think it's the trustee's
[32:03] responsibility to come and sit with the
[32:06] pastor
[32:07] if there is a concern it should be a
[32:10] conversation between the trustee
[32:13] the treasurer and the pastor
[32:17] so god bless you for your silence
[32:28] praise the lord knowing that we were
[32:31] going to
[32:31] uh have this business meeting
[32:34] uh i thought that i would speak on
[32:36] something and
[32:38] uh that i entitled the great
[32:41] intelligence of
[32:42] elohim the great intelligence of elohim
[32:46] to show that we are here by design
[32:50] you are sitting in this building this
[32:52] morning
[32:53] by design there is an intelligence that
[32:56] is behind your presence
[32:58] here it is now all of your choosing
[33:02] amen which of course you could also
[33:05] choose to live
[33:08] but there is a great intelligence
[33:11] that is behind everything that happened
[33:15] in the universe
[33:18] praise the lord a church does
[33:21] just does not run by
[33:25] few men sitting together and
[33:28] uh you know and making and making uh
[33:31] uh uh yes you know suggestion or
[33:35] or guess or whatever it is i knew i had
[33:39] i had an announcement here i've already
[33:42] started going
[33:44] uh there is a planned youth meeting for
[33:47] the 2010 uh
[33:51] uh there's a plain youth meeting for the
[33:53] 2010
[33:54] and brother jordan will bring us some uh
[33:57] more details on that so there's a plane
[34:00] meeting for the 2010
[34:03] and the flyers for washington
[34:07] is out uh so uh
[34:10] brother uh stephen collins and brother
[34:13] team
[34:14] the romney will be doing uh some special
[34:17] meeting there up in wappington north
[34:19] dakota
[34:20] so if you are planning to go or you want
[34:23] to go
[34:24] uh to know how to get there i will
[34:28] i will ask that you you
[34:31] talk to brother jordan and
[34:35] before the the middle of this month
[34:40] we would like to be able to have an idea
[34:43] of those
[34:44] that would love to go so we can
[34:48] we can let uh the the brothers know so
[34:52] maybe until the 20 until the 16th
[34:56] or the 20th we would definitely like to
[34:59] have an idea of those that will love to
[35:03] go
[35:04] praise the lord amen
[35:08] and
[35:11] well the thing about it there you go i
[35:13] mean you could choose
[35:14] to make your own plans and and
[35:18] you know and go to the meeting you know
[35:20] when uh
[35:21] i mean every one of us in some way
[35:24] beside the kids we are responsible
[35:26] people
[35:27] but sometimes the reason why these
[35:29] things are done is because
[35:31] when you go out you are representing us
[35:34] as a body
[35:37] and it will be good for us to know that
[35:40] you are out there representing us
[35:42] that is just all it's not to control
[35:45] you or detect to you how you should go
[35:48] about but it will be good
[35:50] for us to know that you are out there
[35:53] representing us
[35:54] as a church praise the lord
[35:58] amen and uh
[36:01] also uh
[36:05] there there are a few things
[36:08] that uh i also had on my mind
[36:16] over the years i really thought that i
[36:19] would have
[36:20] addressed some of these things if we
[36:22] were fortunate to have
[36:24] our our 25th
[36:27] meeting church anniversary meeting that
[36:29] we were planning to but
[36:31] uh we we had an ad and we still dealing
[36:34] with
[36:34] uh uh
[36:38] you know the entire uh
[36:41] word problem and kovac and all of that
[36:44] so
[36:44] for now now we just
[36:48] we just keep those things as the way
[36:50] they are but uh
[36:52] the church of the living god stay moves
[36:54] on praise the lord
[36:56] you know uh kovak is not dictating to us
[37:00] we are dictating to to covey amen
[37:05] it's not dictating to us at all we are
[37:08] dictating to covey
[37:09] praise the lord
[37:13] and so we know that through this church
[37:17] we have uh two deacons there's
[37:20] uh brother steve john bibi
[37:24] and uh brother uh ben
[37:27] uh lingard there's our two vacants
[37:31] that this church the beacons are not
[37:36] appointed the deacons calling to the
[37:38] local church
[37:39] are normally voted in and
[37:42] and in the way that brother branham set
[37:45] it up the terms of the deacons comes at
[37:48] the end of the year
[37:49] but you know it all will determine
[37:53] from the the way that they can bowl
[37:56] works with the local pastor
[37:59] if we see a need for us to add on to the
[38:01] deacon bowl
[38:03] if there is a reason why
[38:07] brother seven on the deacon ball must
[38:09] must be taken of the deacombe
[38:11] then those things are addressed
[38:14] so uh we have two trustees
[38:18] there's uh uh uh brother max
[38:22] and uh uh brother
[38:25] steve cassidy and uh
[38:28] steve cassidy i'm gonna match our
[38:31] trustees
[38:33] and brother steve cassidy is also the
[38:35] treasurer of the church
[38:37] and which of course is the office that
[38:41] he he had been holding
[38:44] and he loved yelling
[38:48] praise the lord amen
[38:51] i think he's caught for that office with
[38:54] his level of details that he have
[38:58] and uh and we greatly appreciate that
[39:05] and then uh over the years our brother
[39:10] uh scath
[39:13] has led
[39:16] this church uh as uh as our song leader
[39:20] until brother lord came on board a
[39:22] couple of years ago
[39:24] and then uh many years ago
[39:27] not just couple and then
[39:30] a couple of years he he decided to move
[39:34] out of state and so
[39:38] we we we really never had an
[39:41] an appointed song leader
[39:44] so brother lawrence and
[39:48] brother hillary has been helping
[39:52] the office or the role as some leaders
[39:56] now i call into the scripture
[39:59] uh the the song leaders
[40:04] and the musicians they are all
[40:08] part of the ministry they are all under
[40:11] the ministry they are all ministering
[40:14] spirits
[40:15] praise the lord they are all ministering
[40:18] spirits
[40:19] and that's the reason why a person
[40:23] is not just used in a local church as a
[40:27] musician because of your music skill
[40:31] no not because of your music skill i
[40:34] mean you can play the guitar at your
[40:36] back
[40:37] but if you can submit yourself to the
[40:39] word of god we don't want that skill
[40:46] praise lord because they are all part of
[40:49] the ministry
[40:50] so it's not because a man can play or
[40:53] the woman can play a certain instrument
[40:56] that's why they play the the
[40:59] i mean it must be to the pastor's
[41:01] knowledge
[41:05] because it's all part of
[41:09] the ministry if you read the church all
[41:11] the brother branham talks about it in a
[41:13] way
[41:14] and the way he says it is that he says
[41:17] the the song leader comes up and leaves
[41:19] one or two songs
[41:21] you know to get the people ready and
[41:23] then the pastor comes up
[41:25] you know i mean over the years we have
[41:27] we have we have uh
[41:29] you know have this telling me it's time
[41:32] for some service and sometimes people
[41:35] think it's written in bold letters but
[41:36] if you study the church order you
[41:38] realize that it's
[41:39] it's not written in bold letters you
[41:41] know if uh if the pastor
[41:44] want to leave songs yeah he has a right
[41:46] to lay sons
[41:48] the song leader just helping the pastor
[41:58] and but then also
[42:02] uh
[42:07] you see this tool around our setting
[42:11] in the message where a pastor
[42:16] is is more of an administrator than a
[42:19] pastor
[42:23] praise the lord he's more than he's more
[42:26] an administrator than the pastor because
[42:29] he does everything
[42:31] you know he does everything he's into
[42:33] everything and
[42:34] you know and all of that stricture is
[42:36] not supposed to be like that
[42:37] we know from the scriptures that there
[42:40] must be men that are giving to the word
[42:42] in prayers praise the lord
[42:46] the deacons are spiritual advices to the
[42:50] pastor
[42:51] when it comes to spiritual things
[42:54] and things
[42:58] that concerns the people you know and
[43:01] also
[43:03] concerns but brandon says they are the
[43:04] policemen of the church we know that
[43:07] as well so uh
[43:10] uh uh some
[43:15] few years back uh uh brother jordan and
[43:18] his wife approached me
[43:20] in action but one is yes are there
[43:22] things that we can take off your plate
[43:24] are there things that we can
[43:26] help you to do and because
[43:29] i'm so selfish
[43:36] i'm so selfish i love to do everything
[43:40] it was a bit difficult for me to decide
[43:42] what to let them do
[43:44] and what not to let them do but i think
[43:47] slowly they started taking certain
[43:50] initiative
[43:52] and it has been a great help
[43:55] so uh i spoke to both of them
[43:58] and asked them if they could if they
[44:01] could help
[44:02] himself as as administrators
[44:06] brother jordan which of course his wife
[44:08] works along with him
[44:11] and uh to be able to just help me with
[44:14] just planning some things and and you
[44:16] know
[44:17] and some other things so uh
[44:21] praise the lord
[44:24] so they appointed them as
[44:28] as administrators to be able to help
[44:31] because even without the appointee
[44:34] brother jordan has
[44:36] taken on that initiative
[44:39] praise the lord and because we
[44:43] have now fully come to the place where
[44:45] we have a
[44:48] song leader that we can we can put in
[44:51] charge of
[44:52] uh not only leading songs but
[44:55] of the the the music
[44:59] you know uh and the musicians
[45:02] so i also spoke with
[45:06] brother ariel being a musician
[45:10] that he was served as a music director
[45:13] uh just to be able to work with the song
[45:16] leaders
[45:17] work with a musician and take on some
[45:20] responsibilities when it comes to
[45:22] to those things and
[45:27] until we can fully come to the place
[45:30] where we have a
[45:33] song leader that
[45:36] you know because it's it's a ministry
[45:39] that just
[45:40] is now only uh
[45:43] subject to coming up in leading songs
[45:48] you know you have all of these musicians
[45:52] you know that you have to work with
[45:56] and sometimes you have to make some
[46:00] difficult you have to make some strong
[46:02] calls
[46:03] and praise the lord
[46:07] and so
[46:10] for our appointees those uh the few
[46:15] that we we just appointed to be able to
[46:18] help us
[46:19] with some of the few things that we have
[46:22] to do around you
[46:23] the church is not an organization
[46:26] but yet the church is an organized body
[46:33] praise the lord the church is an
[46:35] organized body
[46:37] and when you don't have
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] things organized
[46:49] is a sign that there is no
[46:53] intelligence to that thing
[46:57] that's some of that we will talk about
[46:59] this morning
[47:00] and pray that the lord will be able to
[47:02] help us
[47:04] praise the lord churches
[47:07] has been run in a way
[47:10] where you know people think they can
[47:14] come into a local church and uh
[47:17] you know it's the house of god you know
[47:21] and and with that they think that it has
[47:25] the right
[47:26] to you know do whatever they want
[47:29] i will promise you they are not in this
[47:32] place
[47:34] we will hope that it don't happen here
[47:36] praise the lord
[47:38] we will hope that it don't happen here
[47:41] church also is a family in families
[47:46] we make mistakes we make wrong choices
[47:50] you know when and uh and yet we sit as
[47:54] family and we deal with those things
[47:57] but when a person want to think want to
[48:00] take
[48:02] you know a way of life
[48:05] that does not match the value that we
[48:08] stand for
[48:09] as a church we will also let you know
[48:13] that we can discipline you
[48:16] according to the scripture
[48:22] if you make mistakes we can bear with
[48:24] you but when you want to take your
[48:26] mistake as a way of life
[48:32] we have a scriptural order to discipline
[48:36] you
[48:42] praise the lord
[48:50] so
[48:55] as we are growing you know the two
[48:58] places in the book of acts
[49:01] this the the bible talks about the
[49:03] growth of the church
[49:05] and one of the places was the bible says
[49:08] and they grew in the word of god you
[49:11] know so the growth of a church is not
[49:13] just the members
[49:15] it's not just the numbers but how much
[49:18] the people
[49:20] are growing in the word of god how much
[49:23] they are becoming
[49:25] uh you know a reflection of what they
[49:28] believe
[49:28] or what they stand for and i think i'm
[49:32] more interested in growing in the word
[49:33] of god and growing in
[49:43] and numbers
[49:46] uh
[49:55] we will talk as we as we go along
[49:58] i just thought there that we will drop
[50:01] few of these things
[50:03] but recently there are a few things that
[50:05] has been happening
[50:07] you know around the world around the the
[50:09] the
[50:10] the body of believers around the world
[50:14] and sometimes to draw concern for you
[50:17] know for
[50:18] those things to be addressed and
[50:21] [Music]
[50:22] so we as a local church we can know
[50:24] which direction that we are going
[50:27] praise the lord in the local church
[50:30] uh the pastor is the head of the local
[50:33] church
[50:34] according to the scripture is not an
[50:37] editor
[50:38] because of age is an other
[50:42] chronologically in the word of god
[50:45] praise the lord you know he's an editor
[50:49] because of his office
[50:52] is the highest office in the local
[50:54] church
[50:56] so that that makes him an
[50:59] error and that's the reason why paul
[51:01] says we must not put a man that is a
[51:03] novice
[51:05] we must put a man that is sound in the
[51:08] word of god
[51:09] and if i'm not sound you must get me
[51:11] from there
[51:14] and uh so that that makes him an editor
[51:19] and then in the local church also we
[51:21] have you know supporting ministries
[51:24] which are the the brothers that preach
[51:26] here we have brother
[51:28] uh dan brother jordan brother brother
[51:30] joseph have just come along to be with
[51:32] us
[51:33] and uh
[51:39] sometimes in the local church there are
[51:42] ministries that uh that are birthed
[51:44] in the midst of the local church a
[51:46] person we could have used as an example
[51:48] was brother lloyd
[51:50] you know his ministry started right from
[51:52] here
[51:54] and uh
[51:55] [Music]
[51:57] and then sometimes there are there are
[52:00] ministries that comes
[52:01] you know from from uh by the way of
[52:04] relocation
[52:05] or traveling and coming be part of the
[52:09] local church
[52:10] and uh in that way the the the
[52:13] the pastor you know uh works with the
[52:16] brothers and
[52:18] uh you know and and also support them
[52:23] but like i told brother lloyd you know i
[52:26] mean he's
[52:27] he's a dear friend and a son to me
[52:32] and i told him all the time i you know
[52:34] we would talk about it and i told him i
[52:36] said
[52:37] i said when you get married
[52:42] then i'll feed him a heart we can bring
[52:45] your ministry before the church
[52:47] because it's not only the gift as a
[52:49] preaching you also have a responsibility
[52:52] to make an example of your home so
[52:55] uh then we can ordain you
[53:00] as a local minister that we have
[53:03] witnessed over the years
[53:05] and uh uh you know and all of that
[53:10] if uh uh many of you will remember at
[53:14] the time
[53:14] that this this church voted us
[53:17] in as a pastor i had to be ordained
[53:22] now that was now my ordination
[53:25] into the ministry i was ordained as a
[53:28] local pastor into this church
[53:31] yes
[53:34] praise the lord as minister i've been
[53:37] ordained
[53:40] as a minister to preach the gospel you
[53:42] know so
[53:43] i mean all of those things now the
[53:45] reason why i'm saying it is because
[53:49] uh uh
[53:52] i call into the the scripture uh
[53:57] the the the office
[54:00] of uh the beacons
[54:03] uh and next to the office of a pastor
[54:08] those are the scriptural offices
[54:11] that men are voted in now the reason why
[54:15] for the trustees we we bring them before
[54:18] the church and we ask the church
[54:20] if there's a reason why you know uh
[54:24] uh i mean if if the uh uh there's a
[54:27] reason why this brother shooting itself
[54:29] is is also in the sense of uh
[54:31] accountability but uh
[54:34] uh the the next office
[54:38] to the pastor that the men
[54:41] pray for then into their offices the
[54:43] deacon office
[54:45] and
[54:49] then the next will also be maybe
[54:53] uh their associate pastor or assistant
[54:57] pastor
[54:58] when a church has come to the place
[55:00] where there is a ministry among them
[55:02] they think that
[55:04] uh you know uh this ministry just like
[55:07] elijah and elijah
[55:09] you know uh we found that uh you know
[55:12] this brother
[55:13] uh herself this church and we bring him
[55:16] before the church
[55:17] uh you know to ordain him
[55:21] as an assistant pastor and then in that
[55:23] way
[55:24] the reason why that is done is uh
[55:28] uh is is uh is a direct signal to the
[55:31] church
[55:32] that if anything should happen to the
[55:34] pastor whether he felt sick
[55:36] or he died there is a man that takes the
[55:39] office
[55:42] because this man has been presented he's
[55:44] he's ordained he's already in the office
[55:47] as an assistant
[55:48] pastor now what happened when the church
[55:50] does not have an assistant pastor
[55:52] and the pastor died praise the lord
[55:57] what happened oh
[56:00] i mean i'm not asking for an eldef
[56:06] praise the lord but uh
[56:09] that the pastor can met he's no longer
[56:12] conceived in the role of a pastor
[56:14] what happened now we realized that what
[56:17] has been happening
[56:19] over the years and in many churches we
[56:22] we see that
[56:26] there is there is a struggle that comes
[56:28] between the deacons
[56:30] and the ministers in the church
[56:34] praise the lord amen the deacons
[56:38] says i mean we are we are in charge the
[56:40] ministers say ah but i'm a minister and
[56:42] you are a deacon
[56:45] praise the lord but you have to
[56:47] understand the way the local church work
[56:49] a minister has the authority by the word
[56:53] of god because he has a gift
[56:56] but in the local church the local church
[56:59] has appointed a deacon
[57:02] that has been chosen and ordained so
[57:05] the office of a deacon his position
[57:09] is higher than just a minister in a
[57:12] local church
[57:13] but when it comes to the word
[57:17] praise the lord amen
[57:20] so you see there there there are there
[57:22] are two roles you
[57:23] you have to understand how those roles
[57:25] play out
[57:30] are we together so
[57:34] what will happen is that that they can
[57:37] must be able to sit down with those
[57:39] local ministers
[57:41] and uh they should be able to talk and
[57:44] and
[57:44] and i mean some of the brothers and you
[57:46] know because noun is a concern to the
[57:48] church
[57:49] but what i will advise as
[57:53] as a pastor for our church until
[57:56] god is able to raise up a man that we
[57:59] can have and know that
[58:00] this this man can be able to run the
[58:03] church we we
[58:04] we have a service life you know we have
[58:06] observed his ministry
[58:08] and we know that he's right into the
[58:10] vision for the success of this church
[58:14] and uh uh uh what
[58:17] what will happen is that uh in
[58:19] situations like that
[58:22] you know uh uh is it is
[58:25] always safe the safest thing to do
[58:28] in those kind of a situation is that
[58:31] the deacons and the ministers of the
[58:34] local church
[58:35] must be able to decide and
[58:38] bring in an editor
[58:44] we must bring in an editor
[58:48] take for example we must bring in an air
[58:50] that is very
[58:51] you know uh uh we know that is
[58:54] supportive to this church
[58:55] where we have we we can say well okay uh
[58:58] uh maybe
[58:59] uh uh one of the nearest air that we can
[59:01] use maybe don hoffman
[59:03] all i will say is like brother prater
[59:07] he's been a good friend to this church
[59:10] so
[59:10] that local editor will come in
[59:15] and serve as an overseer
[59:19] praise the lord so now there is not an
[59:22] internal conflict
[59:24] of struggle between the ministers
[59:28] and the deacons this other person said
[59:30] well i started preaching before you
[59:31] other person say i'm older than you the
[59:33] other person said i'll bring the message
[59:34] before you
[59:35] and and all of that no it does not work
[59:37] like that
[59:40] so now that that that that that
[59:43] uh that editor was serve
[59:46] as an overseer and
[59:49] and and he will work with the church
[59:53] and be because he's an editor and he's
[59:56] he's a person that is out of the body
[59:59] there is there is no
[1:00:00] area for personal interest what he's
[1:00:03] looking for
[1:00:04] he's looking among the ministers to be
[1:00:06] able to find
[1:00:08] a man that has a true burden
[1:00:13] praise the lord whether six months or a
[1:00:16] year
[1:00:17] if that man is found then he comes
[1:00:19] before the church and says church
[1:00:21] i think you have a man among you
[1:00:26] for this period of time that i've been
[1:00:28] working with you i think
[1:00:30] this brother can be able
[1:00:33] to lead you amen
[1:00:39] praise the lord because pretty soon
[1:00:43] those internal conflict breaks the
[1:00:46] people
[1:00:46] because everybody in this
[1:00:49] congregation every ministry that
[1:00:52] preached here
[1:00:54] minister to you in a certain way
[1:00:58] praise the lord amen
[1:01:02] i i even know that uh i'm not my
[1:01:05] daughter's favorite preacher
[1:01:11] amen she says she says daddy
[1:01:14] why don't you never tell a story
[1:01:17] about yourself
[1:01:25] praise the lord now so
[1:01:29] so you see what happened is that that's
[1:01:32] that's
[1:01:32] word now if if the local church
[1:01:35] don't wisely deal with that you have
[1:01:39] people breaking into groups
[1:01:43] the people that love brother dan
[1:01:45] ministry
[1:01:46] gather the people that love brother
[1:01:48] joseph ministry gather
[1:01:50] the people that love jordan ministry
[1:01:52] gather
[1:01:53] the day he's preaching they are on fire
[1:01:55] because that's the main one
[1:02:04] and when you do that you are killing the
[1:02:07] church
[1:02:10] you are killing the church because you
[1:02:13] are completely connor
[1:02:22] praise the lord
[1:02:26] and i've not started preaching yet
[1:02:33] less than to our feet
[1:02:43] genesis chapter one
[1:02:51] verse 1 and 2.
[1:03:01] most of the time i just love to project
[1:03:03] my
[1:03:04] the quotes and add my personal note but
[1:03:07] uh
[1:03:07] there's a portion of my personal note in
[1:03:09] this that i will i would
[1:03:11] love to project just to be able to
[1:03:15] to
[1:03:18] to get things out there
[1:03:26] i wish i could have done it in the in
[1:03:28] the powerpoint
[1:03:30] manner and then it would not be
[1:03:33] a kind of a difficult thing for uh the
[1:03:36] technicians but
[1:03:37] i'm sure they can be able to handle it
[1:03:40] i've given them worse than this so
[1:03:44] genesis chapter 1.
[1:03:49] let's read verse 1 and 2.
[1:03:53] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:03:58] and the earth
[1:04:02] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:04:05] and the earth and the earth was with how
[1:04:08] form
[1:04:08] and vowel and darkness was upon the
[1:04:12] face of the deep in the spirit of god
[1:04:15] move upon the face of the water
[1:04:17] praise the lord amen
[1:04:20] let's also read first corinthians

[1:07:41] your seat
[1:07:43] we want to talk on the great
[1:07:45] intelligence of elohim
[1:07:47] praise the lord amen the great
[1:07:51] intelligence of elohim and
[1:07:56] uh as as
[1:07:59] i was as i was studying and looking into
[1:08:02] different things
[1:08:08] uh
[1:08:10] there is there is uh there is a
[1:08:13] documentary
[1:08:14] that two great scientists did
[1:08:18] and uh they did it a couple of years
[1:08:20] back
[1:08:21] it's called the privileged planet
[1:08:26] it's called a privileged planet and uh
[1:08:30] very very interesting i mean as they
[1:08:32] talk about earth
[1:08:35] if you can just put yourself in the
[1:08:38] place of earth
[1:08:40] as you listening to the documentary
[1:08:43] you will realize that that we are
[1:08:47] privileged
[1:08:47] to be here praise the lord we are
[1:08:51] privileged to be
[1:08:52] believers it's it's a privilege
[1:08:56] you know uh uh and and a lot of the
[1:08:58] things
[1:08:59] that that has that has opened to us is a
[1:09:03] privilege
[1:09:04] now so uh uh
[1:09:07] the the reason this
[1:09:10] uh subject caught my mind
[1:09:14] was some of the things that i have just
[1:09:16] spoke about
[1:09:18] you know uh spoke about it in this way
[1:09:23] but there are things that will help us
[1:09:26] as a local church to
[1:09:29] to come in order with the word
[1:09:33] praise the lord there are things that
[1:09:35] will help us
[1:09:36] to come in order with the word and and
[1:09:39] and one of the reason did
[1:09:40] is that there is this
[1:09:43] there is this uh idea that is
[1:09:47] you know that is is uh uh
[1:09:52] is in the minds of the people out there
[1:09:55] most especially you know the people that
[1:09:58] believe in
[1:09:59] all the different theories about
[1:10:01] creation
[1:10:02] than uh than the then god than the
[1:10:05] biblical theory or the biblical
[1:10:07] you know uh belief of creation
[1:10:11] and uh the people
[1:10:14] kind of a belief that you know
[1:10:16] everything of this word
[1:10:18] just happened randomly
[1:10:22] you know so there is there is a strong
[1:10:25] belief
[1:10:25] that that is in is is you know is
[1:10:28] in science it's behind the big bang
[1:10:31] theory and
[1:10:32] and all of that and and what and what
[1:10:35] they try
[1:10:36] to promote is you know
[1:10:39] things happen by chance
[1:10:45] praise the lord that things happen by
[1:10:48] change
[1:10:50] and
[1:10:57] for anything to happen
[1:11:01] by change and
[1:11:06] and it makes sense
[1:11:10] praise the lord amen
[1:11:13] or the way i want to say is that
[1:11:15] anything that makes sense
[1:11:17] shows that there is an intelligence
[1:11:19] behind it
[1:11:23] praise the lord anything that makes
[1:11:26] sense
[1:11:28] there is an intelligence
[1:11:31] behind it
[1:11:35] praise the lord so
[1:11:40] this is uh this is is called
[1:11:44] the a stream of of information
[1:11:48] i call it a stream of information in
[1:11:50] time
[1:11:52] but the you know the term a as the
[1:11:55] stream of
[1:11:56] information that
[1:12:00] when you when you even look at
[1:12:03] information you'll realize
[1:12:07] that the extreme opposite
[1:12:11] of information is what
[1:12:15] science called entropy
[1:12:20] which is information and no
[1:12:23] information
[1:12:27] praise the lord the extreme opposite of
[1:12:30] information is no
[1:12:32] information
[1:12:35] praise the lord so all of this other
[1:12:39] they have
[1:12:43] things
[1:12:46] been in order they have order and they
[1:12:49] also
[1:12:50] have this order
[1:12:53] praise the lord just follow me a little
[1:12:55] bit
[1:12:58] and they have
[1:13:02] noise which is
[1:13:06] the stream of signal
[1:13:10] and in my notes as i was as i was uh uh
[1:13:13] putting this together
[1:13:14] i i dropped a little thing that i say is
[1:13:16] uh
[1:13:18] the technicians are working on
[1:13:23] signal to noise ratio
[1:13:30] all they are doing in the back there as
[1:13:32] as they move those things
[1:13:34] they are trying to reduce the noise
[1:13:39] so to reduce the noise they got to get
[1:13:42] the right
[1:13:44] signal that this
[1:13:46] mark is not interfering with this other
[1:13:49] mark
[1:13:50] if they should put all the marks off
[1:13:52] this
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:54] it's just going to be a noise and you
[1:13:55] put your hands to your ears
[1:14:00] praise the lord amen
[1:14:03] well we sit down we follow the service
[1:14:07] and sometimes we get irritated when we
[1:14:09] get a little noise
[1:14:11] but you don't know the work that is
[1:14:12] being done back then
[1:14:23] it's an engineering term
[1:14:26] the signal to noise ratio
[1:14:30] is reducing the noise to get the right
[1:14:34] signal
[1:14:40] are we together you see what i'm coming
[1:14:42] to
[1:14:44] because it's it's right in the scripture
[1:14:46] it's right around
[1:14:47] our life that's what the holy spirit is
[1:14:50] doing
[1:14:54] there is there is a singer that is
[1:14:56] called the stay small voice
[1:15:01] that is coming to you but there are a
[1:15:03] lot of noise around you
[1:15:09] and what the holy spirit is trying to do
[1:15:11] is to put your life
[1:15:12] in tone so you can hear the voice of god
[1:15:18] and don't be distracted by the noise
[1:15:19] that is around you
[1:15:22] because we have a generation that
[1:15:24] believe facebook and google
[1:15:27] more than the bible
[1:15:38] so the opposite of noise the extreme
[1:15:42] opposite of noise is to get
[1:15:46] the right signal
[1:15:54] and then also this in music
[1:15:58] the opposite of music is
[1:16:01] cacophone cacophony
[1:16:04] which is just just uh uh
[1:16:08] like pause it uh sounding symbols
[1:16:11] just you know just just this all the
[1:16:14] noise
[1:16:17] and music as i was looking
[1:16:21] at the stream
[1:16:25] i saw this music
[1:16:29] is reading
[1:16:33] and reading is the parting of sound
[1:16:38] silence and emphasis
[1:16:44] the pattern of sound
[1:16:47] silence and emphasis
[1:16:54] praise the lord
[1:17:04] and then as you go down you realize
[1:17:07] that you have
[1:17:11] chaos
[1:17:14] and you have cosmos
[1:17:20] there they are also to a stream
[1:17:27] amen you have chaos
[1:17:31] and you have cosmos
[1:17:39] and you will see a little bit from that
[1:17:42] word
[1:17:43] cosmos that's where the word
[1:17:46] cosmetic was taken from
[1:17:52] cosmetic so actually what cosmetic
[1:17:55] you know implies here is
[1:17:59] bringing order out of chaos
[1:18:05] praise the lord amen
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] that's what you know mark factor is all
[1:18:15] about
[1:18:16] brother brandon talks about it in
[1:18:18] marriage and divorce
[1:18:20] for the matter of fact it was what
[1:18:22] brother branham was talking about when
[1:18:24] he said
[1:18:25] saturn is her designer
[1:18:31] he was now talking about the
[1:18:32] intelligence behind the creation of the
[1:18:35] woman
[1:18:35] but he was talking about mark factor he
[1:18:38] was talking about
[1:18:39] how satan has designed a woman by
[1:18:42] cosmetic
[1:18:46] from her natural beauty that's what he
[1:18:49] was talking about
[1:18:54] are we together
[1:18:57] so mark factor is saying that we can
[1:19:00] bring an
[1:19:01] order to your chaos
[1:19:08] when you put all the
[1:19:12] let me now go there
[1:19:17] let me now go there praise the lord
[1:19:24] and then you also have randomness
[1:19:28] and you have design
[1:19:33] praise the lord when david said in the
[1:19:36] psalm
[1:19:36] i'm fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:19:41] he was talking about a design
[1:19:47] praise the lord and if you have a design
[1:19:51] you have an intelligence
[1:19:55] behind that design
[1:20:00] praise the lord somebody designed this
[1:20:04] shirt
[1:20:04] that i'm wearing there is an
[1:20:07] intelligence
[1:20:13] are we together amen
[1:20:17] so the so the creation of the word
[1:20:23] and and and you you see this
[1:20:26] this thought this teaching this idea
[1:20:30] of randomness and things
[1:20:33] happening by chance that's what has
[1:20:37] made you know uh uh our word
[1:20:41] the way it is that is it it's a software
[1:20:44] teaching
[1:20:46] praise the lord is a software teaching
[1:20:49] that is even in a lot of circular
[1:20:52] churches
[1:20:56] praise the lord they are they are hoping
[1:21:00] for change and luck but yet
[1:21:03] is termed like faith
[1:21:07] they are using the word faith
[1:21:10] but faith must have a solid ground to
[1:21:13] rest
[1:21:14] on which is the word of god
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:18] they are not resting on the word of god
[1:21:20] but they say we believe god god can do
[1:21:22] it what they are doing
[1:21:24] is that they are looking for change
[1:21:32] hoping that it will happen somehow
[1:21:38] praise the lord are we together
[1:21:43] amen now so
[1:21:47] you will realize that it takes energy
[1:21:51] and design to make anything
[1:21:55] orderly
[1:21:59] it takes energy and design
[1:22:02] to make anything orderly
[1:22:10] praise the lord
[1:22:13] but the thing about it again keep that
[1:22:15] thought in your mind the thing about it
[1:22:16] when you
[1:22:17] look at it when you look at it closely
[1:22:21] you will also realize
[1:22:24] that this is a path that
[1:22:27] constantly move from the right order
[1:22:31] to this other
[1:22:34] a constantly move from the right to the
[1:22:37] left
[1:22:39] from other to chaos
[1:22:42] praise the lord let me let me give you
[1:22:46] an example
[1:22:48] amen simple
[1:22:51] you face your bed nicely
[1:22:56] you lay on it it does not remain nicely
[1:22:58] yes
[1:22:59] you wake up the next morning you have to
[1:23:01] fix it again
[1:23:03] praise the lord you clean up your garage
[1:23:09] or your storage or whatever it is
[1:23:13] with time it will go back
[1:23:18] to being this author
[1:23:22] are we together there is there is there
[1:23:25] is a concept that i want you to grab
[1:23:27] as i'm saying this
[1:23:32] look at genesis chapter 1.
[1:23:35] the scripture says in the beginning
[1:23:38] god created the heaven
[1:23:42] and the earth
[1:23:47] genesis chapter 2 a move to chaos
[1:23:57] with time what god created moved to
[1:24:01] chaos
[1:24:08] praise the lord amen
[1:24:12] so you can see the concept that taught
[1:24:15] here is there
[1:24:16] it is only those things that are
[1:24:19] internal
[1:24:21] amen only the things that are in tanner
[1:24:29] do not go into chaos
[1:24:34] that's right praise the lord
[1:24:37] are we together are you are you grabbing
[1:24:40] the concept
[1:24:41] amen but i i've i think so but i don't
[1:24:46] feel it
[1:24:48] praise the lord i don't feel i'm trying
[1:24:50] to get a hold of your spirit
[1:24:53] maybe i did too much talking on you know
[1:24:55] deacons and
[1:24:56] pastors and all of that it make you you
[1:24:59] you stay thinking about those things but
[1:25:01] just forget about it let's get to the
[1:25:02] word yet amen
[1:25:03] praise the lord let's get to the word
[1:25:08] and and then you will get to see it and
[1:25:11] understand why i had to
[1:25:12] say those things that i just said
[1:25:16] one of the things that are intended
[1:25:21] praise the lord only the things
[1:25:25] that are intended when we when we said
[1:25:27] genesis chapter 1
[1:25:29] i spoke about a year one wednesday night
[1:25:31] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:25:34] and the earth
[1:25:34] the beginning of anything is the
[1:25:37] foundation of it
[1:25:39] amen and the foundation of the word is
[1:25:43] in the mind of god
[1:25:47] praise the lord so in the beginning god
[1:25:50] created the heaven and the earth it was
[1:25:52] a perfect creation
[1:25:54] in god's mind
[1:25:58] praise the lord it was a perfect
[1:26:01] creation
[1:26:02] i mean he saw it he planned it last week
[1:26:04] we talked about
[1:26:05] looking at the big picture
[1:26:12] are we together
[1:26:15] amen now right between
[1:26:18] genesis chapter 1 and genesis chapter 2
[1:26:22] something happen
[1:26:28] praise the lord amen something happened
[1:26:32] right between genesis chapter 1 and
[1:26:34] genesis chapter 2
[1:26:36] as i the prophet or in the book of
[1:26:38] isaiah talks about
[1:26:40] uh uh uh lucifer being cast down
[1:26:44] when he grew in his heart and wanted to
[1:26:46] ascend himself
[1:26:47] above the truth of god it happened
[1:26:49] somewhere between genesis chapter one
[1:26:52] and genesis chapter two
[1:26:56] rules who have not come to the earth
[1:26:58] except
[1:26:59] there was one that was cursed
[1:27:08] are we together
[1:27:11] now we are talking about
[1:27:15] this formation
[1:27:18] you know this formation it is also like
[1:27:22] someone said we're talking about
[1:27:23] information
[1:27:25] if ashu says something
[1:27:29] to brother juan i said brother come
[1:27:32] let me tell you something and i tell him
[1:27:35] and he tell this brother
[1:27:36] and brother scared sister now man before
[1:27:38] it gets to brother lawrence we're going
[1:27:40] to completely lose the information
[1:27:46] we will completely lose it everybody
[1:27:48] going to say their own way
[1:27:50] and then when it gets heard it's never
[1:27:52] the same thing that was said
[1:27:57] so there is this question rolling into
[1:28:00] this other
[1:28:03] praise the lord
[1:28:06] there is this constant rolling into this
[1:28:09] order
[1:28:12] things keeps happening
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:18] praise the lord amen
[1:28:23] you try to work on your prayer life and
[1:28:25] you stop praying
[1:28:27] and before you realize something going
[1:28:29] wrong on the other side again you got to
[1:28:30] get back and start working on
[1:28:32] it and and and and then something gets
[1:28:34] wrong before you take care of that
[1:28:36] then you no longer praying again then
[1:28:38] you have to go back and start working
[1:28:40] there is just this constant rolling
[1:28:42] into this other and trying to get back
[1:28:44] to other
[1:28:45] and it goes back to this other
[1:28:58] you see that's the reason why when the
[1:29:00] scripture says
[1:29:01] uh uh uh you know uh uh
[1:29:05] he that uh jesus said that in sin john
[1:29:09] have passed from death onto life
[1:29:13] amen
[1:29:19] and that we have received internal life
[1:29:26] praise the lord it's not a tag
[1:29:29] that we put on our chest i believe the
[1:29:31] lord jesus i have internal life
[1:29:35] amen internation
[1:29:38] is a const is a constant
[1:29:41] order praise the lord
[1:29:45] and if thou order has been breath in you
[1:29:49] praise the lord if thou order has been
[1:29:52] birthed
[1:29:53] in you that's why now it takes
[1:29:56] energy and design
[1:29:59] to keep anything in order
[1:30:06] that's what it takes now the believer
[1:30:08] coming and
[1:30:09] and and and and i mean like paul was
[1:30:12] saying
[1:30:12] he he he he's making his call in the
[1:30:15] election show
[1:30:16] he's striving to do right why because a
[1:30:19] sense of order has been breath in you
[1:30:27] but if you just take a church confession
[1:30:29] i believe jesus christ my lord and
[1:30:30] savior
[1:30:31] i've been you know i'm born again and
[1:30:32] has eternal life
[1:30:35] and then there is a constant dragging
[1:30:37] you down to
[1:30:39] to to smoke and drink there is not
[1:30:42] there is no fighting spirit in you if
[1:30:45] you don't have a fighting spirit
[1:30:47] then you need a breath you need a breath

[1:34:37] let me read a little bit here so you
[1:34:41] will grab
[1:34:42] uh he says now now
[1:34:49] unity one god one church
[1:34:52] now in the beginning genesis which is
[1:34:54] the sea
[1:34:55] chapter of the bible we find that
[1:34:58] we find there that when god met a man
[1:35:02] he made him in a way that he
[1:35:05] knew that he was to be
[1:35:09] and he could never be anna
[1:35:13] any greater design than what
[1:35:16] he is and when he
[1:35:20] and when he began to make life
[1:35:24] he made it from the lowest life
[1:35:28] which is more or less uh
[1:35:32] appalling world the frog and
[1:35:36] on to the highest life is man
[1:35:40] which is in the image of god and then in
[1:35:43] this
[1:35:43] life man begin to achieve things
[1:35:47] when and but when he began he began to
[1:35:51] leave
[1:35:51] god out of the picture he began to have
[1:35:55] a
[1:35:55] selfish motive and when he did that
[1:35:59] he begin to think of
[1:36:02] something for himself
[1:36:10] and we find that it isn't long until
[1:36:14] he had corrupt the very planet
[1:36:19] that god had put him on
[1:36:24] praise the lord man wants
[1:36:28] a name of the first man that went to the
[1:36:31] moon
[1:36:32] but you never made the moon
[1:36:37] if you believe there is a moon that you
[1:36:38] can go on someone put away
[1:36:44] are we together
[1:36:55] it isn't long that man has corrupted
[1:36:57] that the planet that god put him on
[1:36:59] he he had got in such a condition
[1:37:03] till even his creator grief
[1:37:06] he grieved him at heart that he did ever
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:14] praise the lord to move from such an
[1:37:17] order of being created in the image of
[1:37:20] god
[1:37:24] a man has reduced himself
[1:37:30] praise the lord now even things that you
[1:37:32] will not
[1:37:33] find in the animal kingdom
[1:37:37] praise the lord you find man and
[1:37:39] involved into it
[1:37:41] he has moved himself from being the
[1:37:44] highest form of life
[1:37:49] to the lowest form of life
[1:37:55] praise the lord
[1:37:58] that he even grieved god at his heart
[1:38:02] and in genesis the bible says and god
[1:38:05] grieved out his heart and said
[1:38:07] what i mean man
[1:38:11] glory be to god are we together
[1:38:16] amen now you think about it
[1:38:19] god made man a man god so
[1:38:22] worse better than what they have now but
[1:38:26] it was so worse that he grieved god at
[1:38:29] his heart
[1:38:30] he said his spirit will no longer strive
[1:38:32] with man
[1:38:33] praise the lord and because of that god
[1:38:37] brought a judgment on the entire earth
[1:38:42] praise the lord now if god did not have
[1:38:45] a purpose for
[1:38:46] creation it would have been easy for him
[1:38:49] to just
[1:38:50] wrap the whole thing up
[1:38:54] trash it away stay as an internal god
[1:38:58] stay as he as as he have always been
[1:39:02] but because he had a purpose
[1:39:07] praise the lord he george the earth he
[1:39:10] condemned the wicked
[1:39:12] save noah in his household
[1:39:16] and yet the bible tells us genesis
[1:39:18] chapter 12
[1:39:20] and god found favor with a man called
[1:39:22] abraham
[1:39:24] that showed that he had a purpose
[1:39:27] that even the wickedness of man
[1:39:31] could not stop his purpose the
[1:39:33] wickedness of man could not change his
[1:39:38] mind
[1:39:43] praise the lord amen oh that's why
[1:39:46] david said the lord has set his love
[1:39:50] upon me
[1:39:51] when god has places love upon you
[1:39:56] do whatever you want to do you will just
[1:39:59] build enough regret for yourself
[1:40:09] you can imagine how god fed
[1:40:12] when he's seen the very creature that he
[1:40:15] have made in his image
[1:40:17] and he have given dominion and how that
[1:40:20] he made him to do something for him
[1:40:24] and yet he turned all of his strength
[1:40:26] and his
[1:40:27] power over to selfish desire
[1:40:32] and achievement selfish
[1:40:35] desire and achievement
[1:40:40] praise the lord
[1:40:44] we want to make a name praise the lord

[1:40:58] himself
[1:40:59] when he never created himself

[1:41:06] he could tell david i'll give you a name
[1:41:12] i faction you i will give you a name
[1:41:15] we know what it is it's more than the
[1:41:17] just a natural name called david
[1:41:20] praise the lord amen are we together
[1:41:25] glory be to god so we we we're trying to
[1:41:29] look at
[1:41:30] this great design brother branham over
[1:41:32] here in uh true sign that's been
[1:41:34] overlooked he says
[1:41:35] i was speaking to a doctor at the
[1:41:37] hospital he was talking about how great
[1:41:39] science has worked and the different
[1:41:41] matters
[1:41:42] of the body and and and the medicine
[1:41:46] he says and see why it will kill a
[1:41:49] certain gems and save

[1:41:57] but i said doctor
[1:41:58] that's good i appreciate that that's
[1:42:01] fine
[1:42:02] i certainly am thankful to god for that
[1:42:04] but look
[1:42:05] you are spending all your life on trying
[1:42:08] to find
[1:42:10] something on a creation
[1:42:14] but why not sometimes think
[1:42:17] who created it
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:23] why not think who created it
[1:42:30] praise the lord amen
[1:42:34] all our problems and things that i mean
[1:42:37] we worried about
[1:42:38] you know is is i mean what
[1:42:42] what we will become or we want to become
[1:42:45] or what we want to achieve and what we
[1:42:47] want to do
[1:42:49] that's that's what we think about
[1:42:56] but if you just said
[1:43:00] the thing about the one that have
[1:43:03] created me
[1:43:06] what is his thought about me as he sits
[1:43:09] on his throne what is he thinking about
[1:43:11] me

[1:43:30] get thinking about the creator
[1:43:32] the circumstances of life around you

[1:43:46] and caleb overcame the giants that's how
[1:43:49] they overcame the wrong testimony
[1:43:52] because they were not looking at the
[1:43:53] giants in the land they were looking at
[1:43:55] the promise
[1:43:57] they were looking at a god that have
[1:43:59] said i have given you the land
[1:44:02] so because they were looking at the
[1:44:04] promise the situation
[1:44:06] becomes smaller in the eyes when you
[1:44:09] think about a great god
[1:44:11] there is no situation will overwhelm you
[1:44:15] not even a health condition not even the
[1:44:18] point of death
[1:44:20] death will never become fearful to you
[1:44:22] [Music]

[1:44:44] even the flame

[1:48:14] proof
[1:48:15] that god is out of our time
[1:48:18] space
[1:48:23] praise the lord he's out of our time
[1:48:26] space
[1:48:27] that's the reason why children you
[1:48:30] cannot put time on
[1:48:32] god
[1:48:35] because god is out of our time space
[1:48:40] praise the lord he has determined
[1:48:44] everything he drops down into time
[1:48:49] and he goes out of time
[1:48:53] that's why he knows the aim from the
[1:48:55] beginning
[1:48:59] he's out of our time space
[1:49:04] are we together praise the lord all of
[1:49:07] these things
[1:49:08] will bring us back to our message on on
[1:49:11] on speed

[1:49:20] god is never late
[1:49:25] he's never late there is nothing
[1:49:28] out of time
[1:49:32] everything is taken just exactly
[1:49:36] according to his great
[1:49:40] master time
[1:49:44] amen his great timepiece
[1:49:48] and this is only
[1:49:51] displaying this owner display his
[1:49:55] attribute

[1:50:09] to happen to
[1:50:11] to you in your life
[1:50:14] and it almost looks like you can never
[1:50:17] see light at the end of the tunnel
[1:50:19] i never know when i'm going to get out
[1:50:21] of this but you see in his great design
[1:50:24] he designed it like that because that is
[1:50:27] a way that he can relate to his
[1:50:29] attributes
[1:50:31] you are so tired but yeah there is some
[1:50:34] internal substance in you keep making
[1:50:37] you to trust god
[1:50:40] it makes you to wait maybe the next day
[1:50:42] maybe the next week
[1:50:44] maybe you it just keeps driving you
[1:50:48] but just like abraham and sarah
[1:50:52] the loose strain in your physical body
[1:50:56] but the bible said he struggled not at
[1:50:58] the promise of god
[1:51:00] that was his fate it was an intense
[1:51:02] substance
[1:51:04] that was dragging that 100 years old
[1:51:06] body to still believe
[1:51:08] god to be the father of many nations
[1:51:13] that's the way that god select his
[1:51:17] attributes
[1:51:19] praise the lord that's why uh
[1:51:22] uh peter taught in this
[1:51:26] episode that if we cannot stand
[1:51:29] trials and trusting it means that
[1:51:32] we are not his own we are bastard
[1:51:34] children
[1:51:36] and you see god do not discipline the
[1:51:38] devil's children
[1:51:40] god discipline his children
[1:51:45] praise the lord because character don't
[1:51:48] go to hell
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:50] have you ever thought when brother
[1:51:52] branham says uh if god sent me to hell
[1:51:55] i would still love him that's a strong
[1:51:58] statement
[1:51:59] because character don't go to hell god
[1:52:02] don't throw a character away
[1:52:16] his great masterpiece timepiece
[1:52:21] this is the only display his attributes
[1:52:25] to select his children who really
[1:52:28] love him and believe him

[1:53:34] to the end the same shall be saved
[1:53:37] he that endureth yes
[1:53:40] endurance is an attribute

[2:03:44] her eyes move toe and further throughout
[2:03:46] all the earth
[2:03:48] to make sure the things that he have
[2:03:51] ordained
[2:03:52] are coming to pass amen
[2:04:00] amen
[2:04:04] praise the lord
[2:04:07] praise the lord like brother graham says
[2:04:12] before we got here god made choices for
[2:04:14] us
[2:04:17] he made choices which family will be
[2:04:19] born in
[2:04:20] which year we will be born which month
[2:04:22] we will be born
[2:04:24] it was all god's choices whether we
[2:04:26] would be male and female they were all
[2:04:28] god's choices
[2:04:30] praise the lord amen
[2:04:34] before they discover that they were not
[2:04:36] male they're supposed to be female god
[2:04:37] made
[2:04:38] a choice
[2:04:44] he make choices for us praise the lord
[2:04:48] he never allowed us to have homes make
[2:04:50] us to have hair on our head
[2:04:52] it was his choice
[2:04:56] glory be to god
[2:05:03] and when he made those choices when we
[2:05:06] first discovered
[2:05:08] the choices that god made we loved him
[2:05:12] until we started learning otherwise
[2:05:16] praise the lord
[2:05:19] we always love our parents
[2:05:24] i mean whether whether they could
[2:05:25] provide for us or they could improve our
[2:05:28] we never ask them for their bank account
[2:05:30] but we love them
[2:05:34] when we started coming to consciousness
[2:05:36] everything that god
[2:05:38] the choices that he made we love it
[2:05:43] until otherwise
[2:05:48] maybe until we went to school and the
[2:05:49] teacher started teaching us something
[2:05:51] different
[2:05:53] how do until we saw the neighbors and we
[2:05:56] think that they are living better than
[2:05:57] us
[2:06:00] or maybe we watch a movie
[2:06:05] and then we start having consideration
[2:06:08] on the choices that he made
[2:06:12] something has happened
[2:06:16] then we start asking questions then we
[2:06:17] start challenging him
[2:06:22] praise the lord
[2:06:25] that's what brother branham said then we
[2:06:27] took the mata from god's hand
[2:06:29] and think i can make a better choice for
[2:06:30] myself
[2:06:37] out of selfish motive
[2:06:42] we wreck our own life yes
[2:06:48] praise the lord by not constantly
[2:06:51] appreciating the choices that he made
[2:06:56] but not constantly appreciating whether
[2:06:59] i
[2:07:00] understand it or not what i love it or
[2:07:02] not but thank you
[2:07:03] jesus thank you jesus
[2:07:07] by now constantly appreciating
[2:07:10] the choices that he made we took mata
[2:07:13] into our own hands
[2:07:20] are we together let me read one more
[2:07:22] quote here and then we came close
[2:07:24] where brandon said be on the curtain
[2:07:26] beyond the cam he says and jesus march
[2:07:28] every prophecy every design
[2:07:32] jehovah of the old testament is jesus of
[2:07:34] the nil
[2:07:36] he marched everything and let me say
[2:07:39] this
[2:07:40] with godly fear and respect but love and
[2:07:43] sincerity
[2:07:44] ignoring where i'm standing
[2:07:47] the message of the hour as
[2:07:51] much everything the bible spoke
[2:07:55] of for this hour
[2:08:03] the message of the hour has marched
[2:08:07] everything that god
[2:08:10] spoke of for this hour that we are
[2:08:13] living in
[2:08:16] that goes to show there's a great
[2:08:20] intelligence
[2:08:22] the fair place to take a kentucky man
[2:08:29] a great intelligence fair place to take
[2:08:36] a man
[2:08:37] of a humble a shameful
[2:08:42] birth father that was a drunk
[2:08:47] a murderer but god in his great
[2:08:51] intelligence
[2:08:54] praise the lord amen
[2:09:08] god has given us a word
[2:09:11] if the great intelligence of god has
[2:09:14] march
[2:09:17] everything in our age and send us a
[2:09:19] message
[2:09:21] to address those things let me tell you
[2:09:24] things will only be addressed in our
[2:09:26] lives
[2:09:27] and in our home when we fall in love
[2:09:32] with the word of god when we fall in
[2:09:34] love with the message of the
[2:09:36] hour you can love brother branham
[2:09:41] get his cap get his belt
[2:09:44] put his picture from the cabin he was
[2:09:46] born
[2:09:47] to his storm all around your house
[2:09:51] if you are not submitting yourself
[2:09:54] none of that will change you it will
[2:09:57] never change your nature
[2:10:01] because he said it would be those
[2:10:03] revealed mystery
[2:10:05] truth that will literally change
[2:10:09] our body those divine mystery truths
[2:10:14] praise the lord that's that's the reason
[2:10:17] why as long as i remain your brother
[2:10:20] i point you to the message of the hour
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:24] i point you to the voice of malachi 4.
[2:10:27] that's my emphasis i mean you can judge
[2:10:30] me whichever way you want
[2:10:34] praise the lord i saw the heartbreaking
[2:10:38] video the other day i was so tuned in my
[2:10:40] spirit
[2:10:42] i cried i just said oh god
[2:10:46] i want to what would that prophet of god
[2:10:47] date a couple went down to the branham
[2:10:50] tabernacle to get married
[2:10:52] and choose that brother branham would do
[2:10:54] their wedding
[2:10:58] and the deacon comes and says well you
[2:11:00] know what and and talk to the people a
[2:11:02] little bit
[2:11:02] now we turn the marriage ceremony over
[2:11:04] to brother branham
[2:11:06] they had to put a tape on and the thing
[2:11:09] about it there the couple don't speak
[2:11:10] english
[2:11:13] so you can just see the disorder and
[2:11:16] somebody is trying to interpret the
[2:11:18] uh uh what brother brand okay impossible
[2:11:20] what is that
[2:11:22] what is that he would turn around in his
[2:11:26] grave he would love from the curtains
[2:11:29] and turn his face
[2:11:34] and you think you're giving honor to
[2:11:36] brother branham when you do that
[2:11:39] you think you love brother branham when
[2:11:41] you do that i want brother branham to do
[2:11:43] my wedding
[2:12:04] praise the lord
[2:12:13] i mean a lot of things i could go into
[2:12:15] it that's that's just enough this
[2:12:16] morning amen
[2:12:18] that just enough this morning but all
[2:12:20] i'm trying to tell you
[2:12:21] there's a great intelligence
[2:12:24] praise the lord even as we stayed here
[2:12:28] as a local church i believe there is an
[2:12:31] intelligence
[2:12:32] behind this body praise the lord
[2:12:36] amen when it was time for i mean
[2:12:40] the brothers here could have choose
[2:12:42] brother scat brothers steve and the rest
[2:12:44] of them they could have just choose
[2:12:45] close this place down sell the building
[2:12:48] you know and everybody can go and find a
[2:12:49] different place
[2:12:53] but in god's great mind he saw you and
[2:12:56] myself sitting
[2:12:57] in this building
[2:13:03] praise the lord in his great
[2:13:04] intelligence he saw you here
[2:13:09] he saw the church being birthed he saw
[2:13:12] the new generation he saw the people
[2:13:14] that will be on fire for god
[2:13:26] praise the lord
[2:13:30] that's the reason why we advise you
[2:13:33] if you don't agree with the things we do
[2:13:35] pray for us
[2:13:38] because it's not by
[2:13:42] just human reasoning we do the things
[2:13:45] that we do
[2:13:47] we are relying on his great intelligence
[2:13:52] so the best that we know how maybe that
[2:13:55] best is not
[2:13:56] sufficient for you
[2:13:59] praise the lord with your help
[2:14:03] and prayer
[2:14:07] we might get there but you see that's
[2:14:10] that's that's what time provides for us
[2:14:15] that's what time provides for us there
[2:14:18] is another
[2:14:18] on this side there is there is another
[2:14:21] extreme of this
[2:14:22] other on this side and as long as we
[2:14:25] stay
[2:14:26] in time that's the fight that we have to
[2:14:28] fight
[2:14:30] to keep things together keep the spirit
[2:14:34] of love keep the spirit of unity
[2:14:36] keep the word among the people and as
[2:14:38] hard as you preach the people will keep
[2:14:40] straightening from the word
[2:14:42] and then you can sit down there and say
[2:14:44] so yeah you know this and
[2:14:46] and it's just a canary brain poor
[2:14:48] reasoning
[2:14:50] there are a lot of things that is
[2:14:51] happening far beyond your spears that
[2:14:53] you can
[2:14:53] understand
[2:15:01] that's what the new birth brings to us
[2:15:03] it brings a fighting spirit the new
[2:15:08] birth bring a fighting spirit
[2:15:11] you don't get discouraged you don't
[2:15:12] throw in the towel because things are
[2:15:14] getting worse

[2:15:17] more things get worse the more you press
[2:15:19] aim
