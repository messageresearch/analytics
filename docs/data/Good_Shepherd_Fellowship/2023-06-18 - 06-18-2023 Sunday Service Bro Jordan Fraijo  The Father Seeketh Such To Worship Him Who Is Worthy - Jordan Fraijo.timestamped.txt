[58:00] is in there just like the Lord

[58:10] and discourage us in the wrong matters

[58:54] labor of love

[59:01] water to someone
[59:02] has a reward
[59:05] and blessing from the Lord
[59:07] amen so I thought to command you for
[59:11] that and just like we said I mean

[59:26] Church it takes us to make it an
[59:29] overcoming Church praise the Lord so we
[59:32] will keep believing that God will bring
[59:35] full healing and strength to the body
[59:39] and a few things I would like to also
[59:42] comment on on Father's Day
[59:46] this is from Time Magazine
[59:49] uh one of time I was in article I was
[59:54] looking at reading some statistics and I
[59:58] just picked these few out of it for
[1:00:00] Father's Day maybe another time in the
[1:00:03] Lord
[1:00:04] bless us who we will bring whatever
[1:00:07] message we we had on our heart to preach
[1:00:11] and it says here we need fathers to step
[1:00:14] up
[1:00:16] to realize that their job does not end
[1:00:19] at conception
[1:00:21] what makes you a man is
[1:00:25] net the ability
[1:00:27] to have a child
[1:00:29] but the courage
[1:00:31] to race one
[1:00:33] praise the Lord
[1:00:35] amen the courage to raise one
[1:00:38] and so the courage that you take to
[1:00:42] impact the young people to teach their
[1:00:45] music teach them skills to run the the
[1:00:49] audio back there that's all it takes
[1:00:54] for you to be for one to be uh
[1:00:58] father amen is is creating leaders for
[1:01:03] tomorrow creating fathers for tomorrow
[1:01:06] praise the Lord another uh article here
[1:01:11] also this is from time achieve where are
[1:01:15] all the fathers the message
[1:01:20] the message that gets is that they are
[1:01:24] not up to the job
[1:01:39] okay
[1:01:41] the message they asked get is there they
[1:01:44] are not
[1:01:45] up to the job and a record number done
[1:01:48] is sticks around to raise their kids
[1:01:52] even as father
[1:01:54] even as fathers I needed more than ever
[1:01:58] now this is a uh
[1:02:01] a little
[1:02:03] testimony here or a happening
[1:02:06] uh I don't have a dad she's making it
[1:02:10] a tiny blonde child with a Pepsi nose
[1:02:14] and who gets up at a visitor and talk
[1:02:18] of her hunger well I do have it there
[1:02:22] but I don't know his name
[1:02:24] I only know his first name Bill
[1:02:28] just what it is
[1:02:31] that father do
[1:02:33] love you
[1:02:35] they kiss you they hug you when you need
[1:02:37] them
[1:02:39] I had my boyfriend for a while but they
[1:02:43] broke up now Megan leave with just her
[1:02:47] mom and older brother in Carver City
[1:02:50] California
[1:02:52] what would you like to do with your dad
[1:02:55] I did want him to I I didn't want him to
[1:03:00] talk to me
[1:03:02] she's hurting them I wish I had somebody
[1:03:05] to talk to me it's not fair if two
[1:03:09] people made you then you should stay be
[1:03:12] with those two people
[1:03:15] and she's and and she's sad
[1:03:20] I'm not so special she said looking down
[1:03:23] at the floor I don't have two people she
[1:03:26] imagined what it will be like for him to
[1:03:30] come home from work at night it will be
[1:03:34] just like
[1:03:36] that commercial where the kids said
[1:03:38] Daddy uh
[1:03:40] are you all right she's my dreaming
[1:03:43] the kids show the daddy there they care
[1:03:47] for him the port
[1:03:49] thermometer in his mouth they think he's
[1:03:53] sick because he came home early
[1:03:57] they are sitting on the couch watching
[1:04:00] TV and it's like wow we can play with
[1:04:03] that Megan thanks her father is in the
[1:04:07] Navy now one day when he gets when I get
[1:04:11] older I'm going
[1:04:13] I'm going to go back to Alabama and try
[1:04:16] to find him more children will go to
[1:04:20] sleep tonight in a fatherless home
[1:04:23] than ever in the nation's history
[1:04:27] talk to the experts in crime drugs abuse
[1:04:32] depression School failure and they can
[1:04:35] point to some
[1:04:38] some studies somewhere blaming those
[1:04:40] problems on The Disappearance of father
[1:04:44] from the American family
[1:04:47] but talk to the fathers who do stay with
[1:04:50] their family and the story
[1:04:53] grows more complicated
[1:04:56] what they are hearing from the buses
[1:05:00] from institutions from the culture
[1:05:02] around them even from their own wives
[1:05:06] very often come down to a devastating
[1:05:09] message we don't really trust men to be
[1:05:12] parents
[1:05:13] and we don't really need them to be
[1:05:17] and so every day
[1:05:20] every word their children are growing up
[1:05:24] without them
[1:05:26] the modern day father comes in very
[1:05:29] forms today father is no longer always
[1:05:32] the
[1:05:34] the traditional Maori Breadwinner and
[1:05:38] this disciplinarian in the family he he
[1:05:42] can be single or married extremely
[1:05:46] employed or stay at home
[1:05:48] and adoptive us our step parents and the
[1:05:53] more them capable caregiver to Children
[1:05:57] facing physical or psychological
[1:06:00] challenges
[1:06:03] and
[1:06:08] physiological research across family
[1:06:11] from all ethnic backgrounds suggests
[1:06:14] their father
[1:06:16] father's affection and increasing family
[1:06:19] involvement help promote children social
[1:06:22] and emotional development
[1:06:27] this
[1:06:29] in the message
[1:06:31] have an ascending
[1:06:34] he says now sometimes I preach pretty
[1:06:37] rough because
[1:06:39] I see that somebody getting out of line
[1:06:44] you see you are supposed to do there a
[1:06:48] real daddy will
[1:06:51] why he did shake you and say yeah get
[1:06:55] back here in line
[1:06:58] if he's a real daddy a true father
[1:07:02] so sometimes your pastor has to will
[1:07:05] then on something
[1:07:07] just love him that much more because
[1:07:11] he's a real father to you
[1:07:13] see trying to keep you line up because
[1:07:17] he's watching over your soul
[1:07:20] which the Holy Ghost has made him the
[1:07:23] overseer of the church
[1:07:26] and you must always watch that
[1:07:29] praise the Lord so in this humble way we
[1:07:33] say Happy Father's Day
[1:07:35] and
[1:07:36] we pray that God will help us to be
[1:07:41] better fathers better husbands to our
[1:07:45] wives
[1:07:46] better Sons to our mothers and
[1:07:50] or more overall better some Son of son
[1:07:54] and daughter of God in the age that we
[1:07:56] are living
[1:07:57] praise the Lord and so it won't take
[1:08:01] much of your time I mean we can go into
[1:08:04] talking here that is that's an easy
[1:08:07] thing for us to do but we want for us to
[1:08:10] just stand on our feet I have a father

[1:13:48] you know
[1:13:50] I know brother one already
[1:13:53] gave us
[1:13:55] a little thought on Father's day but
[1:14:00] to give credit where credit is due
[1:14:02] I gotta say
[1:14:04] I'm thankful
[1:14:06] for the father God gave me
[1:14:12] you know
[1:14:14] he wasn't perfect and he still isn't
[1:14:17] because he's a man
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] but the things he taught me
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] he taught me how to stand up
[1:14:29] he stopped me no matter how tough the
[1:14:32] going gets
[1:14:34] keep on going
[1:14:38] he taught me if you make a mistake make
[1:14:40] it right
[1:14:42] he taught me there isn't anything you
[1:14:45] can do
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:53] that can forgive you of that
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:56] so I say this morning I'm thankful
[1:14:59] for the father my father in Heaven gave
[1:15:03] me
[1:15:04] and to every father
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:08] I said God bless you
[1:15:11] and you continue striving every day
[1:15:15] to be the father God has called you to
[1:15:17] be
[1:15:19] it's not an easy thing he's called you
[1:15:21] to be a real father
[1:15:24] but he has called you to be that because
[1:15:26] he no he knew he made you more than able
[1:15:31] to achieve that whatever place and Stage
[1:15:34] you're at
[1:15:35] in this life
[1:15:37] in this stage of fatherhood God has
[1:15:41] something more for you yet it's not over
[1:15:45] if you look and you say well I haven't
[1:15:47] done so good yet or I didn't do so well
[1:15:50] time's not over you're still here
[1:15:53] God can still do something for you
[1:15:57] I say to you
[1:15:59] sons and daughters
[1:16:01] if you have a father
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] maybe he wasn't a Christian maybe he
[1:16:09] isn't a Christian to this day but if he
[1:16:12] ever taught you anything
[1:16:15] I say be thankful for him
[1:16:18] let him know today Dad
[1:16:21] thank you
[1:16:23] for teaching me the things that you did
[1:16:25] and being the best father you knew to be
[1:16:29] you know many times as children and even
[1:16:32] young adults before you reach stages of
[1:16:35] responsibility in life
[1:16:38] we look at things in our past of those
[1:16:40] who are whether our parents fathers
[1:16:42] people we looked up to teachers people
[1:16:45] that God put over us and we look at
[1:16:47] things that happen and we go wow why'd
[1:16:50] they do that or I would have never done
[1:16:52] that I'll never do that to my kids
[1:16:55] and you don't realize is that we're
[1:16:57] looking back many times with with you
[1:16:59] know 20 20 vision
[1:17:01] Maybe
[1:17:03] your situation you've been Gods allow
[1:17:06] you to have influences in your life
[1:17:07] where now you have a better
[1:17:08] understanding of life you have a better
[1:17:10] understanding of the Gospel
[1:17:12] and that's good because that'll help you
[1:17:15] be a better father that'll help you be a
[1:17:18] better mother
[1:17:20] but look back and see
[1:17:23] and I bet if you look back and see
[1:17:25] you'll see that your parents your father
[1:17:28] with what they knew with how they were
[1:17:31] raised and what they were taught did the
[1:17:33] very best they knew
[1:17:36] and they wish they could have done
[1:17:37] better
[1:17:38] as time goes on but they did the best
[1:17:41] they knew how
[1:17:44] and we need to recognize that and say
[1:17:46] thank you
[1:17:48] and for the things that they could have
[1:17:51] done better that's okay forgive them
[1:17:55] move on because that's what God calls us
[1:17:57] to do
[1:17:58] don't hold it against them that's not
[1:18:02] they didn't mean it
[1:18:04] thankful for the father that they are
[1:18:07] father that they were
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:11] and go back and restore that fellowship
[1:18:15] with the father your father
[1:18:20] because that is the whole thing you see
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:24] Noah's always working in a way in the
[1:18:26] people today in that little thing that
[1:18:29] Brother Juan read is talking about the
[1:18:31] lack of fathers in the home
[1:18:34] and you see that in the homes and
[1:18:37] amongst people you realize when the
[1:18:40] devil is doing that
[1:18:42] in the natural
[1:18:43] it's because he's also wanting to do it
[1:18:45] in the spiritual he's wanting to
[1:18:48] separate your fellowship with the father
[1:18:50] because he knows he can break your
[1:18:52] fellowship with the father it all falls
[1:18:55] apart
[1:18:57] so I say this morning
[1:19:01] both with your natural and spiritual
[1:19:03] father
[1:19:05] go back
[1:19:06] reconnect
[1:19:08] restore fellowship with the father
[1:19:12] if you have a good relationship
[1:19:16] it can be better
[1:19:19] grow that into a friendship that it gets
[1:19:22] never been before and God will bless you
[1:19:24] God will bless it
[1:19:28] interesting that one more time
[1:19:30] I have a father well this thing the one
[1:19:32] Morris and then the verse the one verse
[1:19:35] in the chorus and we'll write to the
[1:19:36] message
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:48] he calls me his own
[1:19:55] oh
[1:19:57] he'll never
[1:20:00] leave me
[1:20:04] no matter where
[1:20:07] I go
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:14] He
[1:20:15] Knows My Name
[1:20:22] he knows my everything
[1:20:31] easy
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:44] pray
[1:20:46] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[1:20:48] to be back here in your house and in
[1:20:50] your presence here this morning Father
[1:20:52] gather together with your people father
[1:20:55] Lord we're so thankful for the
[1:20:57] opportunity Lord that you would call us
[1:21:00] and bless us to
[1:21:02] with this great opportunity to be here
[1:21:05] with you father Lord to hear your word
[1:21:08] and have you speak to our hearts father
[1:21:10] Lord he asked you just come down and
[1:21:12] have your way take control of the
[1:21:14] service Lord I Surrender myself to you
[1:21:17] that you would be able to use me to
[1:21:19] speak to your people father sent me to
[1:21:21] decide if any
[1:21:23] thoughts and things that maybe I thought
[1:21:26] to bring father were incorrect or you
[1:21:28] just stop me Father Lord if there's
[1:21:32] something you want to say that's not
[1:21:33] even in my notes then Lord you just take
[1:21:36] me just that way and speak to the heart
[1:21:37] of the people we pray Lord Jesus ask you
[1:21:40] bless your people this morning and Jesus
[1:21:43] most wonderful and precious name we pray
[1:21:45] amen amen
[1:21:48] thank you musicians
[1:21:51] if you would turn with me we're just
[1:21:53] going to turn to John chapter four we're
[1:21:55] going to read verse 20 through 24. if
[1:21:58] you're here with us Wednesday or you're
[1:22:00] able to catch the service on Wednesday
[1:22:03] we're going to follow up from where
[1:22:05] we're at
[1:22:07] and touch on that
[1:22:10] in John chapter 4 verse 20.
[1:22:19] our fathers Worship in this mountain
[1:22:23] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[1:22:26] place where men ought to worship
[1:22:29] Jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[1:22:32] the hour cometh when you shall neither
[1:22:34] in this mountain nor at Jerusalem
[1:22:37] worship the father
[1:22:40] ye worship ye know not what
[1:22:43] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:22:46] of the Jews
[1:22:47] but the hour cometh and now is
[1:22:51] when the true worshiper shall worship
[1:22:53] the father in spirit and in truth
[1:22:57] for this father seeketh such to worship
[1:23:00] Him
[1:23:01] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:23:04] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:23:07] truth you may be seated
[1:23:09] this morning I just want to take a title
[1:23:12] possibly from this from verse 23
[1:23:16] the father seeketh such to worship Him
[1:23:20] and maybe as a subtext
[1:23:22] of who is Worthy
[1:23:25] no on Wednesday night we took a dive
[1:23:28] into worship
[1:23:31] and we found out that worship is not
[1:23:36] what most of us perhaps would would
[1:23:39] think it is
[1:23:41] is that today we have a very perhaps
[1:23:45] narrow understanding of the word
[1:23:49] and
[1:23:50] most of the time even myself if you know
[1:23:54] I gave the example on Wednesday I said
[1:23:56] if I said let's all cook together for a
[1:23:58] time of worship
[1:24:00] or for a worship service
[1:24:03] I would assume that that service would
[1:24:06] mostly be a time of singing
[1:24:09] someone might read a scripture someone
[1:24:11] might say a few things we might pray a
[1:24:13] little bit but it would probably be a
[1:24:15] lot of singing probably a lot of
[1:24:18] just songs of
[1:24:19] of
[1:24:22] about God's love
[1:24:24] a real
[1:24:25] sweet sincere songs that would draw us
[1:24:29] into his presence
[1:24:33] but that's not worship
[1:24:37] no don't get me wrong that could be a
[1:24:40] part of worship
[1:24:42] but we found out
[1:24:44] that worship
[1:24:46] has more to do with obedience
[1:24:50] and submitting yourself to God
[1:24:53] in the original form of the word
[1:24:57] and just real quick we're going to jump
[1:24:59] over and I see they have it here
[1:25:02] we're going to read through
[1:25:04] the definition of the word worship this
[1:25:06] is straight from the dictionary
[1:25:08] and sometimes it's good for us to go in
[1:25:10] and just get a dictionary definition
[1:25:14] because
[1:25:16] we've got this idea of what something
[1:25:19] means and then when we start to dig into
[1:25:21] it we realize that's not it at all
[1:25:23] right it's not that's not even the basic
[1:25:26] understanding of someone reading the
[1:25:27] dictionary
[1:25:30] that's how far off we are
[1:25:33] and worship
[1:25:35] means to honor or show reverence
[1:25:38] for a Divine being or Supernatural power
[1:25:43] to regard with great or extravagant
[1:25:46] respect
[1:25:47] honor or devotion
[1:25:52] reverence offered a Divine being or
[1:25:56] Supernatural power you know out of all
[1:25:58] these the one closest to the worship
[1:26:01] service we would think of would perhaps
[1:26:04] maybe be the third
[1:26:06] is reverence offered a Divine being or
[1:26:09] Supernatural power
[1:26:11] but the first two are greater
[1:26:15] breakdown of how
[1:26:18] that reverence is offered
[1:26:21] and I put together here
[1:26:24] just a quick
[1:26:26] what I thought would be a
[1:26:28] synopsis or
[1:26:30] tied together what we Define you know
[1:26:34] um thought from Wednesday was before we
[1:26:37] jumped in
[1:26:39] to what I'm looking to
[1:26:42] the direction I'm looking to go in this
[1:26:43] morning
[1:26:45] and what we developed is that worship
[1:26:49] is revealed in the true worshiper
[1:26:51] through their reaction to the moving of
[1:26:53] the holy spirit in their life
[1:26:55] a true worshiper submits themselves to
[1:26:58] God's will in their life whether it's
[1:27:01] instruction correction
[1:27:03] admonishment or praise
[1:27:06] the worshiper reacts to the will of the
[1:27:08] father as a blessing worth more than
[1:27:10] gold in the shaping of their character
[1:27:14] shaping them into the image of the
[1:27:17] father
[1:27:19] you see because true worship is an act
[1:27:23] of submission
[1:27:25] whenever in olden times they said they
[1:27:27] would come before Kings and potentates
[1:27:30] come before people of authority and
[1:27:33] Power
[1:27:34] it and then says that they worshiped
[1:27:37] they would give worship to that
[1:27:39] individual they would frustrate
[1:27:41] themselves on the ground
[1:27:44] in many instances they weren't allowed
[1:27:46] to look the individual in the eye
[1:27:51] because to do that was to call yourself
[1:27:53] equal with that individual
[1:27:57] and so in coming before they would
[1:27:59] prostrate on the ground upon their knees
[1:28:02] or if they flat out in submission
[1:28:06] worship
[1:28:10] letting them know
[1:28:13] that I am fully surrendered
[1:28:16] to your will thoughts power
[1:28:21] whatever it is that you want of me I
[1:28:24] give you full control
[1:28:30] and
[1:28:32] with that
[1:28:33] being established of what is worship
[1:28:38] then
[1:28:39] in the scripture here it says the father
[1:28:42] seeketh such to worship him and that is
[1:28:46] tied into where Jesus said the father
[1:28:50] the hour cometh now is when the true
[1:28:52] worshiper shall worship the father in
[1:28:55] spirit and in truth
[1:28:57] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:29:00] Him
[1:29:01] now
[1:29:04] this lets us know that
[1:29:06] God
[1:29:07] isn't waiting
[1:29:10] he's doing something active
[1:29:13] he's actively looking
[1:29:15] just like Jesus with the woman at the
[1:29:17] well
[1:29:18] it doesn't say that the woman met Jesus
[1:29:21] he the woman didn't go to Nazareth
[1:29:23] the woman didn't meet him at the temple
[1:29:26] the woman wasn't in Jerusalem and met
[1:29:30] him there
[1:29:32] the woman didn't go to where Jesus was
[1:29:35] in fact if you remember the story I
[1:29:38] don't know how many of you are familiar
[1:29:39] with the story or how well you're
[1:29:41] familiar with the story
[1:29:43] but it says that as they were traveling
[1:29:47] Jesus said I have need to go by way of
[1:29:52] Samaria
[1:29:55] you know the disciples thought he was
[1:29:57] crazy
[1:30:01] because not only was Samaria out of the
[1:30:04] way
[1:30:06] but that would be like going from
[1:30:09] Bloomington to uh
[1:30:12] um let's say
[1:30:14] what
[1:30:15] what's further if I'm trying to think of
[1:30:17] somewhere a little bit further west of
[1:30:19] Bloomington there
[1:30:21] but you're going in that direction West
[1:30:24] from Bloomington and I was you're
[1:30:26] traveling with me and I said you know
[1:30:27] what
[1:30:29] we need to go to downtown Minneapolis on
[1:30:32] our way there
[1:30:35] laughs
[1:30:37] you know
[1:30:40] you'd all be like
[1:30:42] that's not really on the way
[1:30:48] and it's definitely we're not we're
[1:30:52] going instead of going from one good
[1:30:53] part of town to the next good part of
[1:30:55] town like I'm not sure what your plan is
[1:30:58] here
[1:30:59] but
[1:31:01] that is definitely not on the way
[1:31:05] but that's what Jesus did
[1:31:08] and not only that
[1:31:10] it touches on here when Jesus is talking
[1:31:12] to the woman he's sitting there at the
[1:31:14] well
[1:31:14] where he says you know us the Samaritans
[1:31:17] we have no dealings with the Jews
[1:31:22] and it wasn't just like oh well we don't
[1:31:24] do business together
[1:31:26] this was
[1:31:29] strife
[1:31:32] to the max
[1:31:36] this was racial contention
[1:31:39] as bitter as you have ever seen
[1:31:44] it wasn't just we don't do business
[1:31:47] we have no dealings we don't talk to you
[1:31:50] we don't look at you unless we're
[1:31:52] spitting at you
[1:31:55] and Jesus said I have need
[1:32:00] to go by way of Samaria in order to go
[1:32:03] back
[1:32:04] where we're going
[1:32:08] the father
[1:32:09] seeketh
[1:32:11] such
[1:32:12] to worship Him
[1:32:16] so the father's seeking
[1:32:19] and you know with my subtext something
[1:32:22] to keep in mind here who is Worthy
[1:32:29] I only wrote who is worthy because when
[1:32:31] I tried to thinking how I would write
[1:32:34] that out for what I wanted I realized
[1:32:36] that my subtext was going to be longer
[1:32:37] than my title
[1:32:39] and that that just don't work out well
[1:32:43] but throughout time
[1:32:47] and maybe not everybody but I can say
[1:32:49] for myself
[1:32:51] throughout my Christian Journey there's
[1:32:53] been many a times
[1:32:55] who is Worthy
[1:32:58] Has Come On My Mind
[1:33:02] and in two different ways
[1:33:06] one in regards to myself
[1:33:10] and one in regards to God
[1:33:14] because throughout my journey I've had
[1:33:17] many a Time
[1:33:19] as a Young Man different stages in life
[1:33:25] where I can look at my life
[1:33:27] and I go
[1:33:28] I'm not even Worthy
[1:33:31] like the Roman soldier who came to him
[1:33:33] said I'm not worthy that you would come
[1:33:36] to my home
[1:33:38] but if you would speak the word
[1:33:40] it'll be so
[1:33:43] I can remember many a time as a young
[1:33:45] man in my own struggles
[1:33:47] and
[1:33:49] shame and depression
[1:33:52] thinking I'm not worthy
[1:33:55] to go to church
[1:33:58] I'm not worthy to be amongst the people
[1:34:01] of God
[1:34:03] I'm not worthy of the Gospel
[1:34:07] I don't even deserve to sit in the
[1:34:10] building
[1:34:12] under such condemnation
[1:34:17] I'm not worthy
[1:34:22] and then there's been other stages and
[1:34:24] times in life where I'm ashamed to admit
[1:34:29] where things have happened in life that
[1:34:31] you can't explain there's no
[1:34:34] good
[1:34:35] reason there's no
[1:34:39] way to explain oh I can see how God is
[1:34:43] working through this
[1:34:45] you might see it
[1:34:47] 5 10 15 20 30 years later
[1:34:50] but in the moment you say Lord why
[1:34:54] why am I going through this
[1:34:58] why do I have to suffer this way
[1:35:01] what is your purpose of this I thought I
[1:35:03] was your son I thought I was your
[1:35:05] daughter I thought you love me
[1:35:11] and you'll sit in the church
[1:35:13] you'll sit wherever you're at
[1:35:15] and the thought will come I don't want
[1:35:19] to worship
[1:35:21] with what I'm having to go through
[1:35:24] what God's putting me through
[1:35:30] I don't feel like he's worthy
[1:35:36] I know that's rough that that
[1:35:38] no one wants to admit they ever even
[1:35:40] thought that because how can you be a
[1:35:42] Christian and have a thought like that
[1:35:45] don't worry I'm gonna walk you through a
[1:35:48] few here and I'm going a little slow
[1:35:50] here and I realize that but I want to
[1:35:52] set the tone for where we're going
[1:35:56] and then once we do that
[1:35:58] I say buckle up because we're going to
[1:36:00] run really fast hold on
[1:36:03] if you want my notes afterwards we
[1:36:06] either get them to you or they'll be
[1:36:08] available somehow
[1:36:10] ask me all give me your phone number or
[1:36:12] email I'll give them to you so you have
[1:36:13] the references
[1:36:15] so you ought to just stick with me so
[1:36:18] that we can get out of here on time
[1:36:20] but
[1:36:22] I'm going to take and walk us through
[1:36:24] and see
[1:36:26] in both of these situations we are not
[1:36:29] alone
[1:36:31] I'm going to walk you through a few
[1:36:33] Heroes of Faith
[1:36:35] who all had the same
[1:36:37] situations
[1:36:39] have all faced the same things
[1:36:42] and one thing I will tell you
[1:36:46] is that
[1:36:47] the devil will do anything
[1:36:50] to stop you from worshiping
[1:36:53] from being a worshiper
[1:36:56] and submitting to God either by
[1:36:58] convincing you you're not even worthy to
[1:37:01] submit yourself
[1:37:03] or by convincing you that God's not
[1:37:05] worthy to submit to
[1:37:07] he doesn't care which one it is
[1:37:09] healer lets you know that you're so low
[1:37:11] in the dirt
[1:37:13] that you're not worthy of this gospel
[1:37:15] and you're not even worthy to worship
[1:37:18] or he'll convince you that the gospel is
[1:37:20] not worthy to be worshiped
[1:37:22] and he doesn't care which way you go
[1:37:25] or what time in life it is
[1:37:28] and he'll flip you one way or the other
[1:37:29] it's just like that
[1:37:31] as long as he can keep you to either
[1:37:33] side that's his goal
[1:37:37] you see
[1:37:40] Satan or by his original name Lucifer
[1:37:46] was that made the chief worshiper
[1:37:51] in heaven
[1:37:52] that was his function
[1:37:56] he led the worship in heaven
[1:38:01] and when he went his own way
[1:38:06] he no longer desired to worship but to
[1:38:08] be worshiped
[1:38:11] he lost
[1:38:12] that position
[1:38:14] and when he lost that position he lost
[1:38:16] the power that came with it
[1:38:19] and he wants to keep you from your
[1:38:21] position as a worshiper
[1:38:23] because
[1:38:24] he knows the power that comes with the
[1:38:28] position of the worshiper because he
[1:38:30] once stood there
[1:38:32] and if he knows you stand in that
[1:38:34] position with that power
[1:38:37] there's nothing he can do against you
[1:38:42] so let's
[1:38:44] I'm gonna jump in and we actually took
[1:38:46] Abraham on
[1:38:48] Wednesday and we just touched briefly on
[1:38:51] it and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
[1:38:52] I have quite a few scriptures and a
[1:38:55] couple of quotes and you know it's very
[1:38:57] hard it's very hard for me to do is pull
[1:38:59] a single section of a quote and just
[1:39:02] read that because I always feel like
[1:39:04] it's missing the context and same thing
[1:39:06] with the scripture I I want about two
[1:39:10] lines out of a verse but I feel like if
[1:39:12] I don't provide you with the the ten
[1:39:13] verses before that that
[1:39:16] it won't
[1:39:18] have the same effect
[1:39:21] so what we're going to do is we're going
[1:39:22] to read quickly and then I'll stop and
[1:39:24] pause on the parts with that that we're
[1:39:26] really wanting to put some offenses on
[1:39:27] in Genesis 22 1-18 we found out
[1:39:31] Wednesday night here that Abraham is the
[1:39:34] first
[1:39:36] person in Scripture
[1:39:38] to be identified with worship
[1:39:42] the father of faith
[1:39:44] Genesis 22 verse 1 and it came to pass
[1:39:46] after these things that God did tempt
[1:39:48] Abraham and said unto Abraham
[1:39:50] and said unto him Abraham and he said
[1:39:52] behold here I am
[1:39:54] and he said take now thy son thine only
[1:39:56] son Isaac whom thou love us and get thee
[1:39:59] into a land of Moriah and offer him up
[1:40:01] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[1:40:04] the mountains which I will tell thee of
[1:40:06] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:40:08] and settled his ass and took two of his
[1:40:11] young men with him and Isaac his son
[1:40:14] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[1:40:16] and Rose up and went unto the place
[1:40:19] which God had told him then on the third
[1:40:21] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[1:40:24] the place afar off
[1:40:27] and Abraham said unto his young men
[1:40:29] abide ye here with the ass and I and the
[1:40:33] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[1:40:37] again to you
[1:40:39] now
[1:40:41] I want to focus here real quick
[1:40:44] is that Abraham
[1:40:46] at this stage in his life
[1:40:49] had already been through so many things
[1:40:52] with the Lord
[1:40:55] that submitting and trusting God was so
[1:40:59] easy
[1:41:03] and I say if you don't know that
[1:41:06] then what I want you to do is when you
[1:41:08] go home
[1:41:09] take the Book of Genesis and start
[1:41:12] reading through
[1:41:13] the life of Abraham all the way up to
[1:41:16] this moment
[1:41:17] you can see oh this is you see if we
[1:41:20] just read here you're like wow Abraham
[1:41:22] was able to trust he was able to worship
[1:41:25] easily he was able to submit himself to
[1:41:27] God no questions
[1:41:30] you know why
[1:41:31] because Abraham had many failings prior
[1:41:34] to this in submitting to God's word and
[1:41:38] God's will
[1:41:40] and going off and doing his own thing
[1:41:42] thinking he had a better idea
[1:41:45] and God having to come back and correct
[1:41:48] him and bring him back to where he
[1:41:50] needed to be
[1:41:52] and he'd come along all this way
[1:41:55] and he'd seen the promises of God come
[1:41:57] to pass one after another
[1:42:00] and now at this point this is Abraham's
[1:42:04] hardest trial
[1:42:06] but his greatest moment of faith
[1:42:12] is because
[1:42:13] everything God had offered him
[1:42:16] the reason for leaving the land of his
[1:42:19] father the reason for separating for
[1:42:21] from lot the reason for setting himself
[1:42:24] aside
[1:42:25] away from everyone else and trusting God
[1:42:29] no matter what
[1:42:31] believing God that him a man of 75 years
[1:42:35] old would still have a child
[1:42:40] for 25 years
[1:42:43] when he knew in 25 years my wife is
[1:42:45] going to be 75.
[1:42:49] when God gave the promise
[1:42:51] way back then
[1:42:53] Abraham and Sarah didn't look like young
[1:42:56] men and women
[1:42:58] they look like they were
[1:43:00] of that age
[1:43:01] Abraham looks 75. a man who had
[1:43:05] not just 75 into days years
[1:43:10] but 75 of the hard years of living in
[1:43:14] Wilderness tents and deserts
[1:43:20] the guy
[1:43:21] looked like
[1:43:23] a piece-old boot leather
[1:43:27] have you ever seen someone who's lived
[1:43:29] in desert harsh climates their whole
[1:43:32] life
[1:43:33] there wasn't a whole lot of advertising
[1:43:36] for skin care back then
[1:43:38] it was limited
[1:43:42] there was no reprieve from the heat
[1:43:44] every day
[1:43:45] this he looked like he had weathered 75
[1:43:49] years
[1:43:50] and so did his wife
[1:43:53] and he in the sake of looking insane to
[1:43:57] everyone else he went out proclaiming I
[1:44:00] am going to have a son
[1:44:02] and some people said yeah that's
[1:44:04] possible you got a new wife Coming
[1:44:06] someone really young no no Sarah
[1:44:11] oh
[1:44:13] these 75 years of heat have gotten to
[1:44:16] you Abraham
[1:44:18] but you see the reason why he was able
[1:44:20] to worship and submit to God's word here
[1:44:23] at this stage because 25 years later
[1:44:27] not only did the
[1:44:29] the promise come to pass
[1:44:32] but he had the manifestation of it right
[1:44:34] in front of him
[1:44:36] and he said if God from these dead
[1:44:39] bodies can produce a son
[1:44:41] then even if I give him to God in death
[1:44:45] God will give him back to me again
[1:44:47] because God has already made another
[1:44:49] promise
[1:44:51] is that by Isaac my seed shall come
[1:44:56] so one way or the other Isaac's got to
[1:44:59] be around later because he ain't got no
[1:45:01] kids yet
[1:45:03] so he just goes and he says I am the lad
[1:45:06] will go Yonder and worship what he's
[1:45:09] saying isn't that him and Isaac will go
[1:45:11] pray
[1:45:12] him and his Isaac will go sing he said I
[1:45:15] and Isaac are going to go up this
[1:45:16] mountain and submit ourselves to God
[1:45:20] prostrate ourselves to his will
[1:45:23] and
[1:45:26] come again to you
[1:45:29] Abraham
[1:45:31] at this point had no doubt
[1:45:34] he said I and the lad will go and we
[1:45:37] will come again to you
[1:45:40] he says I don't know how that's going to
[1:45:42] happen
[1:45:43] he said I am really confused on the
[1:45:45] details
[1:45:46] because I have never seen someone dead
[1:45:49] come alive again
[1:45:51] laughs
[1:45:53] but he says I have no doubt somehow
[1:45:56] that's going to happen
[1:45:59] and Abraham took the word of the burnt
[1:46:02] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[1:46:04] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:46:06] knife and they went both of them
[1:46:08] together
[1:46:09] and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father
[1:46:11] and said my father
[1:46:13] and he said here I am my son
[1:46:15] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[1:46:18] but where is the Lamb for a burnt
[1:46:21] offering
[1:46:23] Isaac does not have the same
[1:46:25] relationship with the Lord yet
[1:46:29] if you read in Genesis you'll find out
[1:46:31] later that he makes some he has to have
[1:46:33] he has to go through some of the same
[1:46:35] things in life later develop a
[1:46:38] relationship with the Lord he just
[1:46:40] didn't get one because Abraham had one
[1:46:43] and neither do any of us
[1:46:47] behold the fire in the wood but where is
[1:46:49] the Lamb for the burnt offering and
[1:46:51] Abraham said my son God will provide
[1:46:52] himself a lamb for a burnt offering flew
[1:46:56] in both of them together
[1:46:57] and they came to the place where God had
[1:47:00] told him of and Abraham built an altar
[1:47:02] there and laid the wood in the Altar and
[1:47:05] bound Isaac his son and lay them on the
[1:47:07] altar upon the wood
[1:47:09] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:47:12] took the knife to slay his son and the
[1:47:14] angel of the Lord called unto him and
[1:47:16] Out of Heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[1:47:19] and he said here am I
[1:47:23] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[1:47:25] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[1:47:28] for now I know
[1:47:30] that thou fearest God
[1:47:32] sing thou Hast not withheld thy son
[1:47:34] thine only son from me
[1:47:37] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:47:40] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:47:41] caught in the thicket by his horns and
[1:47:44] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:47:46] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[1:47:49] the stead of his son
[1:47:51] and Abraham called the name of that
[1:47:54] place Jehovah Jireh
[1:47:56] as it is said to this day in the Mount
[1:47:59] of the Lord it shall be seen
[1:48:02] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:48:03] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[1:48:06] and said by myself I have sworn saith
[1:48:10] the Lord
[1:48:11] for because thou has done this thing and
[1:48:14] asked not withheld thy son thine only
[1:48:17] son
[1:48:18] that in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[1:48:21] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[1:48:23] as the stars of the heaven and a sand
[1:48:26] which is upon the seashore thy seed
[1:48:29] shall possess the gates of his enemy
[1:48:32] and in thy Siege shall all the nations
[1:48:34] of the earth be blessed because thou has
[1:48:37] obeyed my voice
[1:48:41] now
[1:48:42] Abraham
[1:48:46] by faith he worshiped
[1:48:51] not because he said well
[1:48:54] if I submit to God there's a blessing in
[1:48:57] it so the greater my submission the
[1:49:00] greater my blessing
[1:49:02] you see God doesn't run His blessings
[1:49:06] off of your submission to his word
[1:49:10] like an investment
[1:49:13] where you have a promised
[1:49:15] percentage return
[1:49:19] so that anyone
[1:49:21] just deciding to
[1:49:23] can put in and and take out as they
[1:49:26] please
[1:49:28] no God does bless his people
[1:49:32] but you see
[1:49:35] it's like the
[1:49:37] what Jesus said
[1:49:38] he said
[1:49:40] put ye first
[1:49:42] the kingdom of God
[1:49:44] and all these things will be added unto
[1:49:46] you
[1:49:49] the way most people
[1:49:51] apply that today
[1:49:53] is
[1:49:56] Lord if you add all these young to me
[1:50:00] I'll put you first
[1:50:06] and that's not what we say many times
[1:50:07] with our words
[1:50:09] but that's what our actions tell him
[1:50:14] and
[1:50:15] see this is
[1:50:16] Abraham and his stage of faith
[1:50:20] where he'd got to that place
[1:50:23] where he understood that scripture
[1:50:26] you say well that wasn't said wait until
[1:50:27] thousands of years God's word never
[1:50:29] changes his Concepts never change
[1:50:35] and Abraham had learned if I put God
[1:50:37] first
[1:50:39] I don't even have to worry about
[1:50:41] tomorrow
[1:50:43] God got it in control
[1:50:46] and many times you know if we were to
[1:50:48] choose what our reward would be for any
[1:50:50] given action
[1:50:52] you know you'd really really undersell
[1:50:55] yourself
[1:50:58] you'd probably pick something really
[1:51:00] menial
[1:51:03] because of our finite understanding
[1:51:07] we would pick something very finite
[1:51:13] but God that's why God doesn't let you
[1:51:15] do that
[1:51:17] see if he had said Abraham what do you
[1:51:18] want to reward for this
[1:51:20] Abraham might have put some real thought
[1:51:22] into it
[1:51:26] and then pick something
[1:51:28] really small
[1:51:30] but he Abraham was not thinking of the
[1:51:33] reward when he went he just was thinking
[1:51:35] Lord if this is your will this is what
[1:51:38] I'm going to do
[1:51:40] and when that happened God said because
[1:51:43] you did that
[1:51:45] because you submitted to my will
[1:51:48] I'm going to bless you in ways
[1:51:51] unimaginable not only not only you
[1:51:54] but your Generations after you
[1:51:57] to this day that blessing is still upon
[1:51:59] the Jews
[1:52:01] this one act of submission to God's word
[1:52:03] is still blessing
[1:52:07] the generations of Abraham
[1:52:10] you know that's if you listen to
[1:52:12] anything online or social media everyone
[1:52:15] to these days is talking about
[1:52:17] generational wealth
[1:52:19] how to build generational wealth
[1:52:22] how to set up your kids and their kids
[1:52:24] and their kids kids and the kids kids
[1:52:29] it's not new God had that plan from the
[1:52:32] very beginning
[1:52:35] Abraham
[1:52:37] built generational wealth
[1:52:40] in God
[1:52:41] for his family for forever
[1:52:44] never ending
[1:52:48] no everyone thinks they thought they
[1:52:50] thought up something new and great
[1:52:53] God had it first
[1:52:56] and he chose to bless Abraham with that
[1:53:00] you see
[1:53:03] and Abraham for us
[1:53:06] would be the example of where we all
[1:53:08] would like to get
[1:53:10] is that when God reaches out to us and
[1:53:14] says I want you to do this
[1:53:16] moves on your heart to do a certain
[1:53:18] thing either say yes Lord
[1:53:20] how far you want me to go how high do
[1:53:24] you want me to jump
[1:53:25] not quite well I don't know I have to
[1:53:28] see if I'm busy that day I had some
[1:53:30] things I was doing with friends
[1:53:33] um I don't know if I can get the day off
[1:53:34] of work
[1:53:35] I don't know how what people other
[1:53:37] people will think about that I need to
[1:53:38] get some opinions no
[1:53:41] if God is moving on your heart
[1:53:44] he wants you like Abraham to say yes
[1:53:47] Lord
[1:53:48] and just go
[1:53:50] go
[1:53:53] because you're not thinking well okay if
[1:53:56] I don't do that
[1:53:58] how will that affect me and if I do do
[1:54:02] it what's the benefits
[1:54:05] no
[1:54:06] um
[1:54:09] worship submit yourself unto the Lord
[1:54:14] don't worry about it that's what he told
[1:54:17] the disciples he said when you go
[1:54:19] don't take a second cloak don't take a
[1:54:22] second staff don't take anything extra
[1:54:26] he said if you really believe what
[1:54:29] you're doing for me is true
[1:54:31] and you're really in the service of the
[1:54:33] Lord
[1:54:34] when you get there I'll provide what you
[1:54:36] need
[1:54:39] you know and that's not to say God
[1:54:41] doesn't want you to be a good Steward of
[1:54:42] your time of your thoughts of the people
[1:54:45] you hang around with of the job that you
[1:54:47] have or the money that he's given you
[1:54:48] that's not that's not it
[1:54:52] because he does
[1:54:55] because those are all things that he's
[1:54:56] doing in your life too
[1:55:00] you know I think many times we we tend
[1:55:02] to
[1:55:04] get
[1:55:05] we catch on to one thing and we forget
[1:55:07] that there's the rest of the scripture
[1:55:08] too
[1:55:10] and that we need to
[1:55:12] walk
[1:55:14] down the middle of the road in a
[1:55:15] balanced gospel
[1:55:17] so
[1:55:19] so here it is Abraham
[1:55:22] his Generations are blessed forever
[1:55:24] because of one act of submission of
[1:55:26] worship
[1:55:28] now
[1:55:30] there's another individual
[1:55:33] and
[1:55:34] we're going to jump in and be right at
[1:55:37] the beginning it seems very much like
[1:55:40] Abraham
[1:55:42] like he doesn't question God but we'll
[1:55:44] find out that
[1:55:47] he has his own issues that he goes
[1:55:49] through
[1:55:50] as we head on in through scripture in
[1:55:53] job
[1:55:54] chapter 1 verse 13-20 and there was a
[1:55:58] day when the sons when his sons and his
[1:56:01] daughters job Sons and Daughters were
[1:56:03] eating and drinking wine in their eldest
[1:56:04] brother's house
[1:56:06] and there came a messenger unto job and
[1:56:08] said The Oxen were
[1:56:11] plowing in the asses
[1:56:13] feeding beside them
[1:56:15] and the sabians fell upon them and took
[1:56:18] them away yea they have stayed in the
[1:56:20] servants with the edge of the sword and
[1:56:21] only I am escaped alone to tell thee
[1:56:24] well he was yet speaking there came also
[1:56:26] another and said the fire of God has
[1:56:29] fallen from heaven and hath burned up
[1:56:32] the sheep and the servants and consumed
[1:56:34] them and I only am escaped alone to tell
[1:56:36] thee
[1:56:38] well he was yet speaking there came
[1:56:39] another
[1:56:40] also another and said the Chaldeans made
[1:56:43] out three bands and fell upon the camels
[1:56:45] and have carried them away yea and slain
[1:56:48] the servants with the edge of the sword
[1:56:50] and I only am escaped alone to tell thee
[1:56:54] well he was yet speaking there came also
[1:56:57] another and said thy sons and thy
[1:56:59] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[1:57:01] and their eldest brother's house
[1:57:06] and behold there came a great wind from
[1:57:08] the Wilderness and smote the four
[1:57:11] corners of the house and it fell upon
[1:57:14] the young men and they are dead and I
[1:57:16] only am escaped alone to tell thee
[1:57:20] then Joba Rose
[1:57:23] rent his mantle and shaved his head
[1:57:27] and fell down upon the ground
[1:57:30] and worshiped
[1:57:35] job's first reaction
[1:57:38] to all of that
[1:57:44] job thought he had God's favor
[1:57:47] and he did
[1:57:51] he never lost God's favor
[1:57:56] because these things are not an
[1:57:58] indicator of his favor or displeasure
[1:58:06] job lost everything in the same day
[1:58:12] it wasn't over a year over 10 years
[1:58:15] slowly you know he was watching his
[1:58:17] portfolio in the stock market stock
[1:58:18] market slip he made some bad choices and
[1:58:21] Investments and he could see why it
[1:58:23] happened
[1:58:24] but
[1:58:26] if you look at these
[1:58:28] most of these actually look
[1:58:31] like acts of God
[1:58:35] what would any of us say if we heard
[1:58:38] that fire Came From Heaven
[1:58:41] and consumed
[1:58:43] something that belonged to you
[1:58:46] like I made God pretty mad
[1:58:49] like
[1:58:51] there are not too many instances of Fire
[1:58:53] coming from heaven and it not being
[1:58:56] God coming down to destroy people
[1:58:59] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:59:03] I mean I can remember there's a few
[1:59:05] stories throughout the time when the
[1:59:06] Israelites were fighting their enemies
[1:59:09] when God would come down with Hailstone
[1:59:10] and brimstone and fight for them
[1:59:15] but there's fear a few instances that
[1:59:17] job would be like well you know I knew
[1:59:19] this other guy who really had faith in
[1:59:20] God God really loved him and he burned
[1:59:23] up his stuff too
[1:59:26] foreign
[1:59:28] in fact I don't know that there's
[1:59:29] another spot
[1:59:31] maybe in history that I just don't know
[1:59:33] of
[1:59:36] and
[1:59:37] his children it says a win from the Lord
[1:59:41] let me let me go back maybe I'm calling
[1:59:43] a great win from the Wilderness I'm not
[1:59:45] sorry it didn't say from the Lord
[1:59:47] but if a Great Wilderness went from the
[1:59:49] Wilderness right after fire what you
[1:59:51] thought was fire from God from Heaven
[1:59:53] consumed something else
[1:59:55] and then the next thing you know a wind
[1:59:57] from the Wilderness came and knocked
[1:59:59] down the house that all your children
[2:00:01] were living were in and killed all of
[2:00:04] them
[2:00:06] you'd probably say wow
[2:00:09] who controls the wind and the waves
[2:00:15] Lord what did I do
[2:00:17] that's like getting that's like being
[2:00:19] the model employee and getting told you
[2:00:21] need to go the your your supervisor
[2:00:23] needs to see you right now
[2:00:28] I mean it's much different because it's
[2:00:30] a lot less change in your life the worst
[2:00:33] thing that happened is you get fired for
[2:00:35] something you didn't know about
[2:00:36] you can always get another job
[2:00:39] you can't get
[2:00:41] dead kids back
[2:00:43] not typically
[2:00:49] so all job can see job didn't know the
[2:00:53] conversation God and Satan had
[2:00:56] he didn't know that God said there's
[2:00:58] none like job
[2:01:00] Joe we know that
[2:01:03] we know that reading the story
[2:01:05] job didn't know that
[2:01:07] job didn't have a clue one day he's
[2:01:10] doing well and the next day he is really
[2:01:13] not doing well
[2:01:19] then Jehovah Rose
[2:01:21] rent his mantle
[2:01:24] shaved his head
[2:01:26] and fell upon the ground and worshiped
[2:01:31] the lord giveth the lord taketh away
[2:01:34] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:01:39] he said I don't get it I don't
[2:01:41] understand it
[2:01:43] Lord if you would just tell me what I
[2:01:45] did wrong
[2:01:46] I would do anything to make it right he
[2:01:48] didn't have to do this
[2:01:51] I didn't even know
[2:01:54] I'm assuming I did something wrong
[2:01:59] but yeah I submit to your will
[2:02:01] nonetheless
[2:02:03] a worshiper
[2:02:07] now
[2:02:09] and and said naked came I out of my
[2:02:12] mother's womb this is him worshiping and
[2:02:14] naked shall I return thither
[2:02:17] the lord gave and the Lord hath taken
[2:02:19] away blessed be the name of the Lord in
[2:02:22] all this
[2:02:23] job sinned not nor charge God foolishly
[2:02:29] job sinned not not for a moment after
[2:02:33] all that did job doubt God
[2:02:38] because we know there's only one sin
[2:02:42] and that's unbelief
[2:02:44] doubt
[2:02:46] so in all of this
[2:02:50] he said I still trust you I still
[2:02:53] believe you and I still submit to your
[2:02:56] will
[2:02:57] no
[2:03:00] over the next year or so where job still
[2:03:03] didn't know why all this happened to him
[2:03:04] and it just seemed to get worse and
[2:03:06] worse
[2:03:07] and everyone turned against him
[2:03:10] job had his times of doubt
[2:03:14] if we go to job 3 1-11
[2:03:20] I think
[2:03:21] I feel like I've been in this place like
[2:03:24] job before I didn't have this much loss
[2:03:30] but after
[2:03:33] after and cursed his day he didn't curse
[2:03:36] God he said I cursed his day and job
[2:03:39] spake and said let the day perish
[2:03:42] wherein I was born
[2:03:45] and the night in which it was said
[2:03:48] there's a man child conceived
[2:03:53] let that day be Darkness let not God
[2:03:57] regard it from above
[2:03:59] neither let the light shine upon it
[2:04:02] let darkness and the shadow of death
[2:04:04] stain it
[2:04:06] let a cloud dwell upon it let the
[2:04:09] Blackness of the day terrify it
[2:04:13] as for that night let Darkness seize
[2:04:16] upon it
[2:04:18] this guy's gotten some deep
[2:04:21] depression
[2:04:24] he didn't say well he'd been
[2:04:27] for any of us with not as eloquent who
[2:04:29] just said it'd been better if I hadn't
[2:04:30] been born
[2:04:31] but that wasn't enough for job
[2:04:36] as for that night let Darkness seize
[2:04:39] upon it let it not be joined unto the
[2:04:41] days of the year
[2:04:43] he said my existence is so miserable
[2:04:47] that the very existence of the day I
[2:04:49] came to be should be erased from memory
[2:04:52] forever
[2:04:55] let it not come into the Numbers number
[2:04:57] of the months low let that night be
[2:05:01] solitary let no joyful Voice come
[2:05:04] therein
[2:05:05] let them curse it that
[2:05:09] curse the day
[2:05:11] who are ready to raise up their Mourning
[2:05:16] let the stars of The Twilight thereof be
[2:05:19] dark
[2:05:20] let it look for light but have none
[2:05:23] neither let it see the dawning of the
[2:05:26] day
[2:05:27] because it shut not up the doors of my
[2:05:31] mother's womb
[2:05:34] nor hid sorrow from mine eyes
[2:05:38] why died I not
[2:05:42] from the womb
[2:05:44] why did I not give up the ghosts when I
[2:05:48] came out the belly
[2:05:53] job is definitely
[2:05:55] here in this stage saying
[2:05:59] I'm not worthy
[2:06:01] of anything
[2:06:03] I don't know what I did but whatever I
[2:06:06] did I Am So Unworthy
[2:06:08] that I'd ever even deserve life
[2:06:14] this person job should never have
[2:06:16] existed
[2:06:24] job was in a very little place
[2:06:31] so you see
[2:06:34] the Devil comes to you
[2:06:37] in your time of need
[2:06:40] a year time of loss
[2:06:43] and tries
[2:06:45] to take and share this same thing with
[2:06:48] you
[2:06:52] and you get in your mind and say
[2:06:56] I should never even have existed
[2:06:58] why am I even here
[2:07:02] what is worth even living
[2:07:09] you're amongst friends
[2:07:11] you're amongst
[2:07:14] men of God
[2:07:16] who they've all had to fight the same
[2:07:18] battles
[2:07:21] now job didn't stay here
[2:07:25] we're gonna keep moving
[2:07:27] in job 19
[2:07:30] he's getting close to the end
[2:07:33] of the misery
[2:07:35] and the loss
[2:07:37] and him just
[2:07:39] being beat upon
[2:07:42] his friends those who he thought he were
[2:07:44] his closest friends through this time
[2:07:48] have all showed up
[2:07:51] his wife said job
[2:07:53] why don't you just Curse God and die
[2:07:56] whatever you did it's bad enough for him
[2:07:59] to do this to you if you just do one
[2:08:01] more thing maybe he'll just eradicate
[2:08:03] you and take you from your misery
[2:08:07] yeah
[2:08:09] that's pretty rough from the one person
[2:08:11] you expect to be the your main support
[2:08:12] in life
[2:08:17] like God said she he gave her to you for
[2:08:20] a help meet and uh that's the kind of
[2:08:23] help you're being dealt
[2:08:25] it's not great
[2:08:28] he had his three best friends
[2:08:31] sit for a year and try and convince him
[2:08:34] job you're a secret sinner
[2:08:37] if you'll just confess your sin maybe we
[2:08:39] can get over this
[2:08:41] God wouldn't do this to someone who
[2:08:44] wasn't a sinner
[2:08:47] and here we come to the end of that
[2:08:50] he's been through his depression
[2:08:53] he's suffered through this
[2:08:58] and he says oh that my words were now
[2:09:02] written
[2:09:03] here's the true worshiper coming back
[2:09:05] out
[2:09:07] see even through this depression he was
[2:09:08] still a worshiper
[2:09:11] he was just going through a low point
[2:09:14] and here it comes back out
[2:09:16] he still hasn't been delivered he's
[2:09:18] still sitting on the ash Heap
[2:09:21] but he's caught a revelation of
[2:09:23] something
[2:09:26] he's slowly catching a revelation of his
[2:09:28] identity of who he is
[2:09:30] and despite the position he's in what
[2:09:33] his end will be
[2:09:36] oh that my words were now were written
[2:09:39] now written oh that they were printed in
[2:09:41] a book that they were Graven with an
[2:09:42] iron pin and led in the rock
[2:09:46] forever
[2:09:48] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[2:09:51] that he shall stand at the latter day
[2:09:53] upon the Earth
[2:09:54] and though after my skin worms destroy
[2:09:57] this body yet in my flesh shall I see
[2:10:00] God
[2:10:01] who my shells
[2:10:03] see for myself and mine eyes Shall
[2:10:06] Behold and not another
[2:10:08] though my Reigns be consumed within me
[2:10:18] job has come to that place where he says
[2:10:21] Lord
[2:10:22] I don't know why I'm going through this
[2:10:27] he says I know if I will just stick it
[2:10:30] out and endure
[2:10:31] whatever reason it is you're taking me
[2:10:34] through this
[2:10:35] I know my end result
[2:10:39] I know where I stand and where my place
[2:10:42] will be in eternity
[2:10:46] and because of that
[2:10:48] I can bear any of this
[2:10:52] he said I don't understand
[2:10:55] and this is the place as Believers and
[2:10:57] worshipers that will come to
[2:10:59] even when going through those great
[2:11:01] trials and situations where you have
[2:11:04] questions
[2:11:05] Saints It's Not Unusual you're you're
[2:11:07] human you're just flesh and Bone
[2:11:11] and in your flesh you're going to have
[2:11:13] those questions
[2:11:16] about why am I going through this
[2:11:19] why did my
[2:11:21] child have to die
[2:11:23] why did my father have to die why did my
[2:11:26] spouse have to die why did this one turn
[2:11:29] against me why do all my friends no
[2:11:33] longer want anything to do with me
[2:11:36] why did that Pastor who seemed to love
[2:11:39] me so much
[2:11:40] all sudden turn on me
[2:11:43] in a moment
[2:11:46] why do I feel so alone
[2:11:49] why am I going through this sickness
[2:11:52] why am I going through this diseased
[2:11:54] State didn't you promise me health
[2:11:59] and we have these things when we're
[2:12:00] going through it sometimes
[2:12:02] but as we go through it God will give us
[2:12:05] strength and we'll came to this same
[2:12:07] place as job and realize this is not our
[2:12:11] end
[2:12:12] estate
[2:12:14] this is simply a place we are passing
[2:12:16] through
[2:12:17] and we submit to God and say Lord though
[2:12:21] you slay me in this life
[2:12:23] yet will I trust you because I know of
[2:12:27] the place of which I came and where I'm
[2:12:29] going
[2:12:49] I'm not going to read the scripture I'm
[2:12:51] just going to relate the story to you
[2:12:55] the first one
[2:12:57] David
[2:12:58] and I'm walking us through because you
[2:13:00] know sometimes
[2:13:04] and I know I need to hurry
[2:13:08] sometimes when we're just stories from
[2:13:10] the Bible
[2:13:11] stories from a thousand years ago
[2:13:14] stories from 2000 years ago
[2:13:17] even though they're true stories
[2:13:21] we're like how do I relate to that
[2:13:24] Abraham wow that's
[2:13:27] 6 000 years ago almost
[2:13:31] things are different now
[2:13:34] but we can see God Jesus Christ the same
[2:13:38] yesterday today and forever through the
[2:13:40] scripture
[2:13:42] no matter what working in the lives of
[2:13:44] his people building character raising
[2:13:48] them up to be Sons and Daughters of God
[2:13:51] ready to stand in his presence
[2:13:55] ready to take the throne with him
[2:13:58] and speak the word
[2:14:00] and his Direction
[2:14:03] and
[2:14:04] David here if we all know the story of
[2:14:08] David how he started out as a Shepherd
[2:14:10] boy and he was chosen of God by Samuel
[2:14:14] an anointed king as it's just a young
[2:14:15] boy because of the situation with Saul
[2:14:19] and then he gets called to the court
[2:14:23] he gives receives great victory in
[2:14:25] battle both over Goliath and many other
[2:14:27] the enemies of Israel
[2:14:30] and there is a time when there's a snap
[2:14:34] and Saul
[2:14:36] turns on him
[2:14:38] trying to kill him
[2:14:41] now all of us have a 20 20 Vision on
[2:14:44] this story
[2:14:46] we can look back and see it for
[2:14:47] everything it was
[2:14:50] we know that God had already rejected to
[2:14:52] Saul as being King
[2:14:55] and that's why Saul was going through
[2:14:57] these because he was anointed and
[2:14:59] Afflicted of an evil spirit
[2:15:02] David did not know that
[2:15:08] Instagram and Facebook were not big
[2:15:10] things back then
[2:15:12] the fact that him and Saul and Samuel
[2:15:14] had had words like we talked about
[2:15:15] Wednesday and go he said God has
[2:15:18] rejected you it didn't make it too much
[2:15:20] further than Saul and Samuel's
[2:15:22] conversation
[2:15:24] as far as the rest of the people knew
[2:15:26] Saul was still and was the anointed king
[2:15:29] of God over Israel
[2:15:32] very few people knew not even Saul
[2:15:37] that Samuel had snuck off and anointed
[2:15:40] some young boy King
[2:15:43] the only thing Saul knew is that evil
[2:15:46] spirit in him didn't like the spirit in
[2:15:49] David
[2:15:51] he wasn't trying to kill David he was
[2:15:54] trying to kill the spirit in David the
[2:15:57] anointing
[2:16:00] and here's David a young man
[2:16:02] he likes Saul Saul's his father-in-law
[2:16:09] he thought Saul like him too
[2:16:12] he was best friends
[2:16:14] with Jonathan
[2:16:16] bosom friends
[2:16:18] a stronger bond between them than
[2:16:21] amongst Brothers
[2:16:24] and all of a sudden randomly one day
[2:16:27] David thinks here I am I'm
[2:16:30] doing something good for Saul I'm
[2:16:32] playing my harp singing him a really
[2:16:34] nice song that I wrote for him about how
[2:16:37] great he is and what an amazing King and
[2:16:40] all that stuff and then out of the blue
[2:16:44] he throws a javelin at him
[2:16:47] and he just barely ducks and misses
[2:16:51] you know if he wasn't anointed to be
[2:16:53] king of God I don't think Saul would
[2:16:55] have missed
[2:16:57] the guy was a warrior
[2:16:59] he not only that he was the biggest and
[2:17:01] strongest of men in all of Israel
[2:17:04] he was Head and Shoulders taller than
[2:17:06] everybody the scripture says
[2:17:10] he was he was a veteran in combat
[2:17:14] he did not miss easy throws across the
[2:17:17] room at a still Target
[2:17:23] but it couldn't be
[2:17:26] and here David is now he's on the Run
[2:17:28] he's hiding to the point where he's gone
[2:17:30] over to the Philistines
[2:17:32] he's over there and there's a point
[2:17:34] where he goes out with his men
[2:17:37] and they're gone from all the women and
[2:17:39] children
[2:17:41] and they're all staying there in
[2:17:44] ziklag was the city that they were all
[2:17:46] camped out in
[2:17:48] he had 600 men and it was their wives
[2:17:51] and children
[2:17:52] including David's own
[2:17:54] and they had gone out and they came back
[2:17:56] when they came back here they are
[2:17:58] David's doing his best to serve the Lord
[2:18:01] in fact unbeknownst to the Philistines
[2:18:03] he would tell the Philistines that he
[2:18:04] was attacking Israel instead of
[2:18:07] attacking Israel him and his men would
[2:18:09] go attack outlying Villages that were
[2:18:11] were
[2:18:13] um direct allies of the Philistines
[2:18:16] to protect Israel
[2:18:19] sir he is he said even as a cast out
[2:18:22] from the kingdom
[2:18:23] by Saul
[2:18:26] he's still doing his best for Israel
[2:18:29] serving God
[2:18:31] in every way he can
[2:18:36] hear he comes back from
[2:18:39] battle
[2:18:41] and the women and the children are gone
[2:18:44] and the town is burned to the ground
[2:18:53] and everyone
[2:18:55] falls into anguish and sorrow the
[2:18:59] feeling was so strong that these men who
[2:19:01] had all left Israel to serve David
[2:19:03] because they believed he was the servant
[2:19:05] of the Lord
[2:19:07] that quick in a moment went from the
[2:19:09] servant of the Lord to deciding whether
[2:19:11] or not to Stone David on the spot
[2:19:14] as the one who the leader who had
[2:19:17] allowed this to happen
[2:19:19] and it says David
[2:19:22] strengthened himself in the Lord
[2:19:25] he worshiped
[2:19:29] he didn't blame anybody else he said
[2:19:30] well it's just as much your guys's fault
[2:19:33] somebody could have stayed here
[2:19:35] it's not just my fault
[2:19:38] that's something we found out Wednesday
[2:19:42] is that both Lucifer
[2:19:45] Satan
[2:19:46] Cain Saul
[2:19:50] went under that inspiration
[2:19:52] they all immediately when called out on
[2:19:55] their sin called out on their failures
[2:19:57] began to blame others
[2:20:00] none of it was their fault and it's not
[2:20:03] my fault and I think I did the right
[2:20:05] thing and it's still not my fault
[2:20:09] and then they find someone to blame it
[2:20:11] on
[2:20:12] Adam did the same thing when he felt and
[2:20:14] he was the son of God but under that
[2:20:17] wrong Fallen inspiration he said when
[2:20:20] God said have you eaten of the tree he
[2:20:22] said
[2:20:23] the wife you gave me
[2:20:25] he blamed his wife and he blamed God
[2:20:31] he didn't say Lord yes I from the tree
[2:20:34] forgive me
[2:20:39] and not only that I didn't protect my
[2:20:40] wife from eating from the tree either
[2:20:42] and it's my fault
[2:20:46] because that's what true husbands are
[2:20:48] called to do
[2:20:49] you know in this message they all the
[2:20:53] men all like to chant about headship and
[2:20:55] and who should be over the home and all
[2:20:57] that stuff
[2:20:59] and they like the part where they want
[2:21:02] to make decisions and tell people what
[2:21:04] to do
[2:21:05] but they forgot the part where God said
[2:21:07] husbands
[2:21:09] love your wives even as Christ loved the
[2:21:12] church and gave his life for it
[2:21:15] it doesn't mean oh I'd take a bullet for
[2:21:18] her
[2:21:19] it means actually giving up your will
[2:21:23] your ideas what things that you want
[2:21:27] for the things your wife wants now
[2:21:29] doesn't mean that you just in the things
[2:21:31] that you feel God is leading you in your
[2:21:33] home and maintaining a standard you just
[2:21:35] roll over
[2:21:37] but most things in life are not that
[2:21:45] but God says you are to stand up for her
[2:21:49] when things go wrong
[2:21:52] you say I as the house the head of this
[2:21:55] house
[2:21:56] take full responsibility for where this
[2:21:58] house is gone and what has gone wrong no
[2:22:01] matter who did it who said it and I will
[2:22:04] do what it needs to be done to make it
[2:22:07] right
[2:22:10] that is a true head of a household
[2:22:15] being able to admit
[2:22:17] it's on me
[2:22:19] because when we sinned and came short of
[2:22:21] the glory of God
[2:22:23] did never blame us
[2:22:27] the thing he immediately did was put a
[2:22:30] plan in motion
[2:22:31] to bring himself down into the body of
[2:22:35] Flesh and pay the price for us
[2:22:39] that is how Christ loved the church
[2:22:44] and I'm getting off subject
[2:22:47] yes
[2:22:49] David takes responsibility he worships
[2:22:52] God
[2:22:53] when doing that God then speaks to him
[2:22:57] and brings Deliverance
[2:23:00] but Deliverance came after worship
[2:23:03] David as well like Abraham like job
[2:23:07] submitted himself and said Lord I don't
[2:23:10] know why this is happening
[2:23:12] but thy will be done
[2:23:16] will you lead me I will follow
[2:23:23] and like Abraham
[2:23:25] the blessings God gave him and his
[2:23:28] Generations after
[2:23:30] when you take God at his word take
[2:23:33] responsibility submit and worship
[2:23:37] God always brings a blessing and
[2:23:38] deliverance
[2:23:41] without fail
[2:23:43] without fail you'll never find one
[2:23:45] without the other
[2:23:49] no
[2:23:50] that was David going through something
[2:23:53] that you'd say well he didn't deserve
[2:23:55] that
[2:23:56] it wasn't something he was doing wrong
[2:23:58] and that's why he came upon him
[2:24:00] but you know David did have something
[2:24:02] that happened to him
[2:24:05] where it was his fault
[2:24:10] and I want to read that
[2:24:12] in second Samuel 12
[2:24:14] 1-23
[2:24:17] and the Lord and I want you to if you
[2:24:21] were here on Wednesday or you heard the
[2:24:23] service
[2:24:24] you know how Saul reacted when Samuel
[2:24:27] came to him and said Saul you've sinned
[2:24:33] his reaction was no
[2:24:35] I've done all the Lord asked me to do
[2:24:38] I've done nothing wrong
[2:24:41] this was the difference between Saul and
[2:24:44] David a man after God's Own Heart it
[2:24:46] wasn't the fact that they made mistakes
[2:24:48] but it was their reaction to the word
[2:24:51] the reaction to correction
[2:24:54] and the Lord said sent Nathan unto David
[2:24:56] and he came unto him and said unto him
[2:24:57] there were two men in one city one rich
[2:25:00] and the other poor and the rich man had
[2:25:01] exceeding many flocks and herds
[2:25:04] but the poor man had nothing save one
[2:25:06] little you lamb which he had bought and
[2:25:08] nourished up and when he grew up
[2:25:09] together with him and with his children
[2:25:11] did eat of his own meat and drank of his
[2:25:14] own cup and lay in his bosom and was
[2:25:16] unto him as a daughter
[2:25:18] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[2:25:20] man and he spared to take
[2:25:22] of his own flock and of his own herd to
[2:25:24] dress for the wayfaring men that was
[2:25:26] come unto him but took the poor man's
[2:25:28] lamb and dressed it for the man that was
[2:25:30] to come to him
[2:25:32] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[2:25:35] against the man
[2:25:37] and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth
[2:25:41] the man that hath done this thing shall
[2:25:44] surely die
[2:25:48] see God knows how to get our attention
[2:25:52] is he'll come to us he'll send a Nathan
[2:25:57] and ask our opinion on something
[2:25:59] and we'll have a strong reaction because
[2:26:01] we think it's somebody else
[2:26:04] and we are really good at judging other
[2:26:07] people fast
[2:26:09] like we don't have to think about it
[2:26:10] boom
[2:26:12] we got the right scripture the quote and
[2:26:15] the we are fired up ready
[2:26:19] if there's someone to burn at the stake
[2:26:21] we're ready to do it now
[2:26:25] and we're feel real righteous about it
[2:26:27] too and that's David there he is he's
[2:26:29] ready
[2:26:31] king of Israel he's going to go save
[2:26:34] this person
[2:26:36] give them True Justice
[2:26:39] for what they've been through
[2:26:43] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[2:26:45] because he did this thing because he had
[2:26:47] no pity
[2:26:50] and Nathan said to David Thou Art the
[2:26:54] man
[2:26:56] thus saith the Lord God of Israel I
[2:26:58] anointed thee King over Israel and I
[2:27:01] delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
[2:27:03] and I gave thee thy Master's house and
[2:27:06] thy Masters wives to thy bosom and gave
[2:27:09] Thee the house of Israel and of Judah if
[2:27:12] that had been too little I would have
[2:27:15] more ever given unto thee such and such
[2:27:17] things
[2:27:21] wherefore hast thou despise the
[2:27:23] Commandment of the Lord to do evilness
[2:27:25] sight thou Hast killed Uriah the hittite
[2:27:27] with the sword and has taken his wife to
[2:27:29] be thy wife and I slain him with the
[2:27:31] sword of the children of Ammon
[2:27:33] now therefore the sword shall never
[2:27:36] depart from thine house
[2:27:38] because thou Hast despised me and has
[2:27:41] taken the wife of Uriah the hittite to
[2:27:43] be thy wife
[2:27:44] thus saith the Lord behold I will raise
[2:27:46] up evil against thee out of thine own
[2:27:49] house and I will take thy wise before
[2:27:51] thine eyes and give them unto thy
[2:27:54] neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives
[2:27:56] in the sight of this son
[2:27:58] for thou did it secretly but I will do
[2:28:01] this thing before all Israel and before
[2:28:04] the son
[2:28:10] and David said unto Nathan
[2:28:14] now Saul immediately when he was rebuked
[2:28:18] for going against the word of the Lord
[2:28:21] said no I haven't gone against the word
[2:28:24] of the Lord
[2:28:25] I have done exactly what God Said to do
[2:28:29] imagine how Brazen you have to be
[2:28:34] to stand in front of the prophet of God
[2:28:38] who gave you the word of the Lord
[2:28:41] who is telling you you didn't do the
[2:28:44] word of the Lord
[2:28:45] and to his face say no you're wrong I
[2:28:50] did do it
[2:28:52] I have done nothing wrong
[2:28:55] in fact I did something even better than
[2:28:58] what God wanted
[2:29:02] now here's the difference David
[2:29:06] said unto Nathan here's the heart of the
[2:29:10] worshiper submitting
[2:29:13] submission to the word
[2:29:15] he's worshiping
[2:29:20] I have sinned against the Lord no
[2:29:24] squabble no well I don't it's not
[2:29:27] exactly the way you heard it I don't
[2:29:28] know who who told you
[2:29:31] because it probably doesn't wasn't that
[2:29:33] way there's really blame 50 50. it
[2:29:35] wasn't just me there was two of us
[2:29:38] she when I sent people to go get her she
[2:29:40] didn't have to come to my house
[2:29:45] do I we all make all the excuses we have
[2:29:48] a million reasons why it's not even if
[2:29:50] it's a little bit our fault it's not all
[2:29:53] our fault
[2:29:55] when David didn't do that he just said
[2:29:59] when the full weight of what Nathan said
[2:30:01] hit him
[2:30:03] he said I have sinned against the Lord
[2:30:07] instant
[2:30:10] and Nathan said unto David the Lord also
[2:30:13] hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die
[2:30:19] wow
[2:30:23] because they were living under the Ten
[2:30:25] Commandments
[2:30:26] this is a murdering adulterer
[2:30:30] under God's law David deserved to die
[2:30:34] twice
[2:30:39] you would say what David did was
[2:30:41] actually probably in the eyes of us much
[2:30:44] worse than what Saul did
[2:30:46] [Music]
[2:30:51] but that infant submission to God's word
[2:30:55] brings Grace in your life
[2:30:58] unmerited favor
[2:31:07] how be it
[2:31:08] because by this deed that has given
[2:31:11] great occasion to the enemies of the
[2:31:13] Lord to blaspheme
[2:31:15] the child also that is born unto thee
[2:31:17] shall surely die you see
[2:31:20] even though we're forgiven sometimes
[2:31:22] there's things in life
[2:31:24] that you're going to have to bear the
[2:31:25] consequences and the reaping of that
[2:31:29] thing
[2:31:30] you're forgiven but that thing's going
[2:31:32] to follow you
[2:31:34] maybe not forever
[2:31:36] but there's going to be something that
[2:31:38] will stick with you not eternally God's
[2:31:41] forgiven and forgot
[2:31:42] but because it's here on this Earth it's
[2:31:45] tied to you
[2:31:48] he's a forgiving God and he's forgiven
[2:31:50] you but there's some scars In the Flesh
[2:31:53] that just don't go away
[2:31:55] there's reputations once made the devil
[2:31:58] and everyone he reminds are still here
[2:32:06] and Nathan departed unto his house and
[2:32:08] the Lord struck the child that uriah's
[2:32:11] wife bear unto David and it was very
[2:32:13] sick now I want to touch this real quick
[2:32:15] and we say you know how cruel it is that
[2:32:18] the Lord would maybe that the Lord would
[2:32:19] kill a child
[2:32:23] you could look at it that way but we're
[2:32:25] going to read a little bit further we're
[2:32:26] going to find out the Lord didn't
[2:32:27] condemn the child
[2:32:30] he simply took the child home
[2:32:34] that child he said because of the
[2:32:36] situation here on Earth
[2:32:39] you can't stay
[2:32:44] where that child went straight to Glory
[2:32:47] and I know because of what David says in
[2:32:49] just a little bit
[2:32:51] because the Lord did not judge the child
[2:32:54] based on the actions of his parents
[2:32:57] and the blood of Jesus Christ the
[2:33:00] sacrifice made before the foundation of
[2:33:02] the world
[2:33:04] covers
[2:33:05] you simply being born in sin and shaped
[2:33:07] in iniquity
[2:33:10] that's what the price was paid for
[2:33:14] David therefore besought God for the
[2:33:17] child and David fasted and went in and
[2:33:19] lay all night upon the Earth you see a
[2:33:21] worshiper even when they've done wrong
[2:33:23] in their situation and the Lord spoken
[2:33:26] and said this is what's going to happen
[2:33:28] it's not Lord don't do it I don't
[2:33:30] deserve it it's just Lord
[2:33:33] just like Christ in the garden
[2:33:36] there he was facing the cross and he
[2:33:38] knew it
[2:33:40] he said Lord if you will
[2:33:42] let this cup pass from me
[2:33:45] that's okay you're allowed to pray that
[2:33:48] and it's up to God whether he decides to
[2:33:51] let that cup pass or not or whether or
[2:33:53] not you'll have to drink of it
[2:33:55] it's totally his will it's okay to ask
[2:33:58] that
[2:34:02] and David therefore besought God for the
[2:34:03] child and David facet went in and lay
[2:34:06] all night upon the earth and the Elders
[2:34:08] of his house arose and went to him and
[2:34:10] raised to raise him up from the Earth
[2:34:11] but he would not neither did he eat
[2:34:14] bread with them they were pretty
[2:34:15] concerned
[2:34:18] but David but when oh wait and it came
[2:34:21] to pass on the seventh day that the
[2:34:22] child died and the Servants of David
[2:34:25] feared to tell him that the child was
[2:34:27] dead for they said behold while the
[2:34:30] child was yet alive we spake unto him
[2:34:32] and he would not hearken unto our voice
[2:34:35] how will he then Vex himself if we tell
[2:34:38] him what the child when the child is
[2:34:40] dead they said wow if he is so
[2:34:42] distraught
[2:34:43] laying before the Lord endlessly and the
[2:34:47] child's alive what will he do when the
[2:34:49] child when he finds out the child is
[2:34:50] dead
[2:34:52] but when David saw
[2:34:54] see this is a worshiper fully submitted
[2:34:58] to the Lord
[2:35:01] that his servants whispered David
[2:35:03] perceived that the child was dead
[2:35:04] therefore David said unto his servants
[2:35:06] is the child dead and they said he is
[2:35:08] dead
[2:35:09] then David arose from the earth and
[2:35:11] washed and anointed himself changed his
[2:35:14] apparel and came into the house of the
[2:35:17] Lord and worshiped
[2:35:20] the lord giveth the lord taketh away
[2:35:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:35:27] a worshiper
[2:35:30] and he came to his own house and when he
[2:35:32] re and he when he required they set
[2:35:34] bread before him and he did eat then set
[2:35:36] his servants unto him what thing is this
[2:35:38] that thou has done
[2:35:41] thou did as fast and weep for the child
[2:35:43] while it was alive but when the child
[2:35:44] was dead though this rise and eat bread
[2:35:47] and he said while the child was yet
[2:35:49] alive I fasted and wept for I said who
[2:35:53] can tell
[2:35:54] whether God will be gracious to me that
[2:35:57] the child may live
[2:36:01] but now he is dead wherefore should I
[2:36:04] fast
[2:36:05] he said it's done God's made his
[2:36:07] decision
[2:36:09] can I bring him back again
[2:36:12] I shall go to him
[2:36:16] but he shall not return to me
[2:36:21] David said I know where he's at and one
[2:36:24] day I will go to him
[2:36:28] but he's not going to return to me here
[2:36:30] on this Earth
[2:36:33] so here you see even when you've done
[2:36:36] wrong
[2:36:38] and the devil wants to come to you and
[2:36:39] let you know
[2:36:40] that you're unworthy to come before God
[2:36:44] to come into His presence
[2:36:48] he's not wrong
[2:36:52] you and I have never been Worthy
[2:36:55] for a moment to stand in his presence
[2:36:59] alone
[2:37:02] but we do not stand alone
[2:37:05] We Stand by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:37:10] that took care of the sin issue
[2:37:13] that transgression that you thought the
[2:37:15] devil's trying to convince you of that
[2:37:16] makes you unworthy to worship
[2:37:19] unworthy to come into the house of God
[2:37:22] unworthy to come into His presence
[2:37:25] you don't realize that God's just
[2:37:26] waiting he's standing there he's waiting
[2:37:29] for you like David to say I have sinned
[2:37:32] before God
[2:37:35] amen Lord forgive me
[2:37:38] and he's just waiting standing there
[2:37:39] waiting for that for you to say that so
[2:37:42] he can come Sweeping in and say Grace
[2:37:45] Grace Grace Grace
[2:37:48] be unto you
[2:37:50] your sins which are many
[2:37:55] are made white as snow
[2:37:58] they're gone I don't even remember that
[2:38:00] quick
[2:38:01] I don't remember what it was that you
[2:38:04] think you did
[2:38:08] a worshiper
[2:38:12] now there's a whole bunch of slides here
[2:38:13] and
[2:38:15] I'm out of time
[2:38:17] but one of the stories that
[2:38:21] haunt my heart
[2:38:23] is we all know the song it is well right
[2:38:28] do we know the story behind it
[2:38:31] how why and when it was written
[2:38:33] just raise your hand
[2:38:35] all right a few for those of you who
[2:38:38] don't
[2:38:39] a man named Horatio spafford
[2:38:42] this was in the 1800s I believe
[2:38:45] he was very good friends he was a
[2:38:49] Christian man
[2:38:51] and it was a businessman there in
[2:38:52] Chicago
[2:38:54] he was very good friends with the
[2:38:55] evangelists
[2:38:57] D.L Moody
[2:38:59] in fact he helped finance a lot of his
[2:39:01] campaigns
[2:39:04] he helped finance a lot of ministry
[2:39:07] and if I would think of a person who
[2:39:10] would be a modern day job
[2:39:12] it would be this man
[2:39:15] he was a wealthy man
[2:39:19] and all within a year's time or so or a
[2:39:22] few years time
[2:39:25] they had the Chicago Fire
[2:39:27] he lost a lot of his Holdings and wealth
[2:39:32] and during that time because of the
[2:39:34] Chicago Fire they were going to be going
[2:39:36] over to Europe with D.L Moody to be a
[2:39:39] part of some of his Services there
[2:39:42] and he couldn't go because he was still
[2:39:45] dealing with some of the losses and
[2:39:46] insurance claims and business things
[2:39:49] and so he sent his wife and four
[2:39:52] daughters ahead of him by ship
[2:39:56] it wasn't a rickety old
[2:39:58] bucket of a ship it was one of the
[2:40:01] nicest ships they went first class
[2:40:05] when I say he had money he had money
[2:40:08] both his wife his daughters and the it
[2:40:11] says I've read the part of the story
[2:40:13] says there was four ministers that were
[2:40:14] all sent first class doesn't say that he
[2:40:17] sent them but I imagine he did
[2:40:19] imagine he paid their way
[2:40:24] you would think wow what a man of God
[2:40:27] that's taking what God has given him and
[2:40:29] just returning it back into the service
[2:40:31] of the Lord
[2:40:34] and on that voyage across the ocean
[2:40:38] in a fog
[2:40:41] that ship and another ship collided
[2:40:43] and the ship went down in moments
[2:40:46] and the only person of the family that
[2:40:49] survived was his wife
[2:40:54] all four daughters drowned
[2:40:58] when she got to Europe
[2:41:00] she sent him a message and part of that
[2:41:02] message said saved alone
[2:41:07] he went to Europe
[2:41:09] and there's different accounts of when
[2:41:11] the song was written I think the most
[2:41:13] famous one is that when he was over he
[2:41:15] was traveling over by ship and when he
[2:41:17] was over the general area of the the
[2:41:20] ship going down
[2:41:22] is that he went out on the bow of the
[2:41:23] ship and he wrote that poem it wasn't a
[2:41:25] Psalm at the time he wrote those verses
[2:41:28] to it as well with My Soul
[2:41:32] and another account says that actually
[2:41:35] the song was written much later
[2:41:39] that's a minister gives an account that
[2:41:41] it was actually written that he wrote it
[2:41:43] in his study when the minister was there
[2:41:44] visiting him
[2:41:47] but
[2:41:48] that that detail is not really important
[2:41:52] but we know this the store part about
[2:41:54] the drowning of his children
[2:41:56] but you know they had three more
[2:41:58] children
[2:41:59] all of them passed away also
[2:42:03] he has additional failings in his
[2:42:05] finances
[2:42:07] and time went on
[2:42:09] but the thing about his story that
[2:42:11] stands out is still with us today
[2:42:15] is that song
[2:42:18] it is well
[2:42:21] because Horatio spafford
[2:42:24] whatever else he was in life
[2:42:27] was a worshiper
[2:42:29] there's actually let me
[2:42:35] is this actually something his wife said
[2:42:38] a pastor notated
[2:42:41] his wife's name was Anna after Anna was
[2:42:43] rescued on the ship
[2:42:44] Pastor Nathaniel wise one of the
[2:42:47] ministers if you want to slide 49 if you
[2:42:50] have that
[2:42:52] the ministers traveling with the
[2:42:53] surviving group remembered hearing Anna
[2:42:55] say God gave me four daughters now
[2:42:59] they've been taken from me someday I
[2:43:02] will understand why
[2:43:08] on the next slide on 50 the very bottom
[2:43:11] there
[2:43:12] she remembers the wife says she
[2:43:15] remembered something a friend had once
[2:43:17] said it is easy to be grateful and good
[2:43:20] when you have so much but take care you
[2:43:23] are not a fair weather friend to God
[2:43:28] what a woman of faith
[2:43:33] but the song it is well after all these
[2:43:35] things happen to him this was the true
[2:43:37] worshipers cry from his heart
[2:43:40] when peace like a river
[2:43:42] attendeth my way
[2:43:45] when Sorrows like see Billows roll
[2:43:50] whatever my law
[2:43:52] has taught me to say
[2:43:54] it is well
[2:43:56] It Is Well with My Soul
[2:43:59] It Is Well with My Soul
[2:44:02] it is well It Is Well with My Soul
[2:44:06] though Satan should buff it through
[2:44:08] those trials should come
[2:44:11] let this Blessed Assurance control
[2:44:15] that Christ hath regarded my helpless
[2:44:19] estate
[2:44:20] and has shed his own blood for my soul
[2:44:26] he was a man who understood like job no
[2:44:29] matter what I go through
[2:44:31] though the skin worms destroy this body
[2:44:34] yet in my flesh
[2:44:36] will I see God
[2:44:39] he said I don't know why I'm going
[2:44:41] through all these things on earth
[2:44:42] but I know where I'm going after
[2:44:46] my sin oh the Bliss
[2:44:49] oh here he is
[2:44:51] he can understand where David stood
[2:44:54] my settle the Bliss of this glorious
[2:44:56] thought my sin not in part but the whole
[2:45:00] is nailed to his cross and I bear it no
[2:45:02] more
[2:45:03] praise the Lord praise the Lord O my
[2:45:07] soul and I don't think I put the last
[2:45:10] verse in there and that's okay
[2:45:13] and that brings us to
[2:45:15] the last
[2:45:17] example of a man of Faith who
[2:45:20] went through things in life
[2:45:22] where God corrected him and put him
[2:45:24] through great trials
[2:45:26] and his result was to worship
[2:45:29] and that's the
[2:45:31] man that we all
[2:45:33] call a prophet oh God
[2:45:36] William Miriam Branham
[2:45:41] he was a man like me and you
[2:45:43] he went through all the same issues and
[2:45:45] troubles and trials
[2:45:47] but
[2:45:49] you know
[2:45:56] he also
[2:45:58] had to face that at its deepest point
[2:46:02] and make a decision to be a worshiper
[2:46:06] he had to make a choice whether or not
[2:46:09] he was going to submit no matter what
[2:46:11] happened to God's will in his life
[2:46:16] let me I was going to read an extended
[2:46:20] portion and if if you want to go back
[2:46:22] this I would suggest go back and listen
[2:46:24] to life story from 1959.
[2:46:27] and I you know I've listened to life
[2:46:30] story many times growing up in the
[2:46:31] message and I've heard a lot of messages
[2:46:33] and a lot of teachings but I tell you
[2:46:36] the older you get
[2:46:39] the more you pay attention life story
[2:46:41] hits so much different
[2:46:44] so much different
[2:46:48] let me I'm gonna go to us
[2:46:52] I'm going to jump over and it'll kind of
[2:46:53] contain it all in in the one
[2:46:56] just so that we can
[2:46:58] wrap up here
[2:47:01] two it's slide 66 hear ye him
[2:47:05] if you're guilty you've sinned and
[2:47:07] you've transfer trespassed against God's
[2:47:09] commandment
[2:47:10] you don't know what to do about it
[2:47:13] let me say this and I think it's gonna
[2:47:15] no I'm gonna hold off on I'm sorry
[2:47:19] you don't know what to do about it the
[2:47:20] Bible said hear ye him for he took all
[2:47:23] of our iniquity he took all of our
[2:47:25] trespasses away here you him what we
[2:47:27] need tonight is not so much law
[2:47:30] and not so much of these denominations
[2:47:32] and so many barriers
[2:47:34] what we need is the love of God
[2:47:37] what we need tonight is men and women
[2:47:39] who will take a bold stand from the
[2:47:41] depths of their heart and serve the Lord
[2:47:43] Jesus
[2:47:44] submit to being worshipers
[2:47:47] to worshiping the king
[2:47:49] the world's looking today not for a new
[2:47:52] denomination if I'd have started 10
[2:47:54] years ago when I was in here I'd
[2:47:56] probably been the father over a great
[2:47:58] denomination sure it would have been
[2:48:00] when men came to my house and said
[2:48:02] brother Branham oh you got it in your
[2:48:03] hand do this no there was somebody spoke
[2:48:07] to me above and I heard him I don't want
[2:48:09] to start denominations
[2:48:11] we don't want to start denominations and
[2:48:13] that doesn't mean the church or or
[2:48:15] starting a giving it a name and calling
[2:48:18] this a Pentecostal or Presbyterian
[2:48:20] that's not a denominator that that's
[2:48:22] they've put a label on a denomination so
[2:48:25] you can identify it
[2:48:27] but brother Brandon let us know that one
[2:48:29] man one individual can be a denomination
[2:48:32] when you put your own thoughts your own
[2:48:35] Creeds your own dogmas the fruits of
[2:48:38] your own labors above what God is
[2:48:41] calling you to do you've denominated
[2:48:44] and God will have nothing to do with it
[2:48:46] after that
[2:48:48] that's what Cain did that's what Saul
[2:48:50] did
[2:48:51] he said I got a better idea for
[2:48:53] salvation
[2:48:54] and how to worship than you do Lord
[2:48:58] and what you should do is just accept
[2:48:59] the way I'm bringing it to you if you
[2:49:01] knew what was good
[2:49:05] that's a denomination
[2:49:07] and when you do the same thing
[2:49:10] you're a denomination
[2:49:12] so don't think because we don't have a
[2:49:15] label
[2:49:16] attached
[2:49:18] that you're free of this
[2:49:20] I say examine yourself
[2:49:23] daily say Lord help me
[2:49:28] a sinner
[2:49:29] saved by grace
[2:49:31] to stay submitted to your word
[2:49:35] the
[2:49:38] no there's somebody spoke to me above
[2:49:39] and I heard him I don't want to start
[2:49:41] denominations we got enough
[2:49:43] what I want to do is be a servant of him
[2:49:45] love him obey him serve him well
[2:49:48] the Bible said you're the salt of the
[2:49:50] earth today you can call yourself a
[2:49:52] presbyterian that don't mean a thing in
[2:49:53] the presence of God you can call
[2:49:55] yourself a Pentecostal doesn't mean a
[2:49:57] thing in the presence of God what he
[2:49:59] wants to see is a man or woman that's a
[2:50:01] Christian in their heart and that's what
[2:50:03] the world wants to see
[2:50:05] the world wants to see men and women who
[2:50:08] are just exactly what they're supposed
[2:50:09] to be
[2:50:11] what you profess to be that's the matter
[2:50:14] with Christianity Today
[2:50:16] Christianity has no backbone left to it
[2:50:24] because they're willing to compromise
[2:50:28] anything in God's word
[2:50:32] for the appeasement
[2:50:34] of man and Praises of man over the
[2:50:37] blessings of God
[2:50:41] and if you talk to anyone
[2:50:44] if you talk to atheists you talk to
[2:50:46] Muslims
[2:50:48] that is their biggest
[2:50:52] detractor
[2:50:54] about Christianity
[2:50:57] is they will tell you I know people who
[2:51:00] claim not to even believe in God who
[2:51:04] live Better Lives
[2:51:06] than all these people who claim to be
[2:51:08] Christians so why would I want that
[2:51:21] if I wasn't if it wasn't for Christ
[2:51:22] tonight I'd be standing here against him
[2:51:25] wow that's a powerful statement
[2:51:28] if it wasn't for Christ tonight I'd be
[2:51:31] standing here against him
[2:51:35] and don't think for a minute that's not
[2:51:37] true of each and every one of us
[2:51:39] because the father
[2:51:41] seeketh such to worship Him
[2:51:45] you didn't go looking for him
[2:51:48] he came looking for you
[2:51:51] and he allowed you to find him
[2:51:58] but I know he's real and I love him
[2:52:00] that's why I'm here for him no doubt
[2:52:02] someday we'll seal my testimony with my
[2:52:05] blood but I'm happy at that day for I
[2:52:08] know that he's the Lord Jesus Christ I
[2:52:10] know he cannot fail I know he's love
[2:52:14] D here some time ago when I lost my
[2:52:16] family and everything someone met me and
[2:52:19] said brother Branham did you keep your
[2:52:21] religion during that time I said no
[2:52:23] brother it kept me
[2:52:27] said what do you think of Christ now
[2:52:29] there's your wife your baby laying
[2:52:32] Yonder in the grave molding there's your
[2:52:34] daddy and your brother Lyn Yonder all in
[2:52:36] a few days apart what do you think about
[2:52:38] him now
[2:52:40] I said he's more than life to me I love
[2:52:43] him with all that's within me a
[2:52:46] worshiper
[2:52:49] hardest hour I ever struck in my life
[2:52:53] just give you a personal testimony he's
[2:52:56] sharing something with us he said the
[2:52:58] hardest moment of my entire life
[2:53:01] of everything I've ever been through
[2:53:06] when I went into the room of my dying
[2:53:08] baby there I'd been a gospel preacher
[2:53:11] for about six years
[2:53:13] serving God
[2:53:16] preaching the gospel
[2:53:19] baptizing people bringing them to Jesus
[2:53:23] doing everything he could for the
[2:53:25] kingdom
[2:53:27] I stood there by my baby they wouldn't
[2:53:30] let me go in didn't want me to go in but
[2:53:32] I slipped in it was down in the basement
[2:53:33] an isolated Ward
[2:53:35] flies had gone into its little eyes and
[2:53:38] I shoot the flies out I put a little net
[2:53:41] like over it I looked at the little
[2:53:43] thing and I said Sharon do you know your
[2:53:45] daddy
[2:53:47] and she had suffered so hard
[2:53:50] to her little baby blue eyes had crossed
[2:53:53] you know that went on and followed him
[2:53:55] his entire life
[2:53:57] he said there wasn't a single time that
[2:54:00] I could see a child with cross eyes but
[2:54:02] I would stop and pray for it
[2:54:04] remembering this moment
[2:54:09] my heart was gripped her mother was
[2:54:12] laying in the morgue the night before
[2:54:16] the night before
[2:54:19] this isn't over an extended period of
[2:54:21] time
[2:54:23] his wife
[2:54:25] of just a few years
[2:54:27] just passed away
[2:54:30] the mother of the child
[2:54:41] I got down on my knees and said Heavenly
[2:54:43] Father what have I done to deserve this
[2:54:48] will you spare my baby
[2:54:52] oh blessed Lord please do
[2:54:55] and it looked like come a black sheep
[2:54:58] unfolding like that
[2:54:59] just shut her off from my view he
[2:55:02] absolutely refused to hear my prayer
[2:55:06] I stood up and looked at her like that I
[2:55:09] knew she was gone
[2:55:13] Satan come to me and he said will you
[2:55:16] serve him now
[2:55:21] there's your wife
[2:55:23] your father's just left your brother was
[2:55:26] killed up on there on the road there's
[2:55:28] your wife in the morgue oh yes you're a
[2:55:31] preacher he ought to be kind to you
[2:55:33] shouldn't he
[2:55:36] you're a Christian
[2:55:39] if God loved you why did he let you be
[2:55:41] going through these things
[2:55:43] why would you be suffering doesn't he
[2:55:45] love you
[2:55:49] why'd you be going through that trial
[2:55:56] will you serve him
[2:55:58] that was the most cruelest Temptation I
[2:56:01] ever had
[2:56:03] for there was my baby and what had I
[2:56:06] done nothing as I note of
[2:56:13] I said reveal it to me God all make it
[2:56:16] right
[2:56:20] Lord you just tell me what I did wrong
[2:56:22] I'll do whatever I need to do to make it
[2:56:24] right
[2:56:25] just don't do this
[2:56:30] but every son see here's the true
[2:56:32] worshiper coming out
[2:56:35] but every son that cometh to God must be
[2:56:38] chastened and tried
[2:56:40] then all of a sudden I was left alone to
[2:56:43] make my decision
[2:56:45] he didn't have Satan talking to him
[2:56:47] he didn't have the Lord talking to him
[2:56:51] I put my hand over on her little head
[2:56:53] and I said sharing honey
[2:56:56] the angels are coming to take you home
[2:56:59] daddy will pack your little body down
[2:57:01] yonder and lay it in the arms of Mama
[2:57:04] and I will burrow you out yonder on the
[2:57:06] graveyard Hill
[2:57:07] but some glorious day daddy will see you
[2:57:10] again
[2:57:12] I raised my hand to him I said Lord if
[2:57:16] you slay me
[2:57:17] yet will I trust you I'll love you and
[2:57:21] that great peace come settling down over
[2:57:23] me musicians if you will
[2:57:27] you see
[2:57:29] this is the heart
[2:57:31] of the worshiper
[2:57:34] because worship is not a song
[2:57:38] worship is not a prayer
[2:57:41] worship is not some deed that you did to
[2:57:44] Garner favor
[2:57:47] but worship is complete and total
[2:57:49] submission to God's will in your life
[2:57:52] and how he's moving
[2:57:55] whether no matter how it looks to you
[2:58:00] you say Lord I don't understand this
[2:58:03] I don't get it
[2:58:05] I don't get why I'm going through this
[2:58:08] and Lord I don't know why you would want
[2:58:10] to save me for what I've done
[2:58:13] the Lord I submit to your will
[2:58:16] I submit to your will in my life that
[2:58:19] you are willing to save me and you love
[2:58:20] me despite what I've done
[2:58:22] and Lord despite what happens to me
[2:58:25] I still believe you love me
[2:58:28] despite what I go through I still
[2:58:30] believe that you have the best for me in
[2:58:32] mind
[2:58:33] it hasn't changed one bit
[2:58:36] nothing's changed
[2:58:39] he says I still
[2:58:41] the thoughts I have for you are good and
[2:58:44] not evil
[2:58:47] many times the things we go through we
[2:58:49] can't see that
[2:58:51] but we can reach up and hold on to the
[2:58:53] hand
[2:58:54] that's guiding and leading us knowing
[2:58:57] that it's the case
[2:58:59] knowing he'll see us through
[2:59:03] knowing that
[2:59:05] if we will just worship
[2:59:09] he'll bless it
[2:59:13] knowing that if in this life like the
[2:59:17] three Hebrew children
[2:59:20] going into that fiery furnace
[2:59:22] [Music]
[2:59:25] they worshiped
[2:59:27] they said Lord
[2:59:29] we don't know whether or not you'll
[2:59:31] Deliver Us from this fiery furnace
[2:59:33] but whether you do or not
[2:59:36] we won't deny you
[2:59:39] will stand for you
[2:59:40] they don't have to throw us into the
[2:59:42] furnace
[2:59:43] we'll March it
[2:59:46] knowing that in a moment in time
[2:59:50] either will be saved from the fire
[2:59:55] and will be alive on this Earth
[2:59:58] or in a moment of time we'll be saved
[3:00:01] from the fire
[3:00:03] and be standing with you in glory
[3:00:05] but eat no matter which way you choose
[3:00:08] to take us we'll serve you nonetheless
[3:00:11] we'll worship nonetheless
[3:00:15] that's what Daniel was doing when he
[3:00:17] when they made the decree that none
[3:00:19] should worship any but the king
[3:00:20] [Music]
[3:00:22] his him going and opening the windows
[3:00:25] and praying like he always did wasn't
[3:00:28] just to pray
[3:00:30] but because he had a scripture that said
[3:00:32] if you will turn no matter where you're
[3:00:35] at when Solomon blessed the temple he
[3:00:39] said no matter where the children of God
[3:00:41] are at if they will turn and pray
[3:00:43] towards this spot I will hear their
[3:00:46] prayer
[3:00:47] and Daniel knew he had that promise he
[3:00:50] said no matter what the decree of the
[3:00:52] king is I have a great
[3:00:55] my God and I will worship nonetheless
[3:01:01] see he didn't have a promise that he'd
[3:01:03] be delivered from the Lion's Den
[3:01:05] he just had a promise that God would
[3:01:08] hear his prayer
[3:01:09] and he worshiped
[3:01:12] and that's where we stand in life many
[3:01:15] times
[3:01:16] is that whether it's something we're
[3:01:19] going through or something that we could
[3:01:20] face based on a decision to worship
[3:01:24] we don't have a promise that you won't
[3:01:26] go through the Lion's Den
[3:01:29] you don't even have a promise that you
[3:01:31] won't be devoured by the Lions
[3:01:35] you don't have a promise initially that
[3:01:37] you won't be thrown into the fiery
[3:01:39] furnace Shadrach Meshach and abendo get
[3:01:42] didn't have a promise that said if you
[3:01:44] worship God
[3:01:47] you will never be in a fiery furnace
[3:01:51] but they knew if they stayed true
[3:01:55] God would deliver them
[3:01:58] one way or the other
[3:02:01] in our sickness
[3:02:04] whatever it is we have a promise of
[3:02:08] healing
[3:02:11] but God can choose you take you home and
[3:02:13] heal you just the same
[3:02:17] looking for his worshipers
[3:02:20] met
[3:02:21] whatever you're going through in life
[3:02:25] and say Lord
[3:02:27] not my will but thine be done I worship
[3:02:31] you
[3:02:33] stand tonight let's just sing this song
[3:02:35] [Music]
[3:02:39] one last thing
[3:02:41] [Music]
[3:02:44] I just wrote down a little thought
[3:02:46] and that was if you're unsure about
[3:02:49] worship if you're unsure about
[3:02:52] submitting yourself to the Lord
[3:02:57] and you're unsure about God's Authority
[3:02:59] in your life giving him full Authority
[3:03:02] and submitting to him
[3:03:04] I would say to you consider this
[3:03:07] if you can't recognize his authority in
[3:03:09] your life
[3:03:12] and the direction for your life
[3:03:15] how is it possible for you to believe
[3:03:18] that he has authority over anything else
[3:03:22] if you don't believe he even has
[3:03:24] authority over you
[3:03:26] how can he have authority to deliver you
[3:03:29] how can he have authority to bless you
[3:03:33] when you won't even commit yourself to
[3:03:36] him
[3:03:37] but if you will commit yourself to him
[3:03:42] recognize his authority come before him
[3:03:45] in worship
[3:03:46] stand in such a place of Power with God
[3:03:50] nothing will stand in your way God bless
[3:03:53] you let's sing it
[3:03:57] when peace like a river
[3:04:03] when peace

[3:09:19] life you have been faithful

[3:13:56] [Music]
[3:14:06] you know
[3:14:07] foreign
[3:14:12] I was listening to this song this
[3:14:14] morning
[3:14:16] I was just thinking
[3:14:19] there was a song of the worshiper this
[3:14:22] is it
[3:14:28] I love you Lord
[3:14:31] oh your mercy never fails me
[3:14:37] no matter what I'm going through your
[3:14:39] Mercy's there for me
[3:14:42] all my days I've been held in your hands
[3:14:47] you see this song is just a constant
[3:14:49] recognition of what he's done
[3:14:52] and that is the heart of the worshiper
[3:14:54] it's not Lord I held onto your hand or
[3:14:57] Lord I held on as long as I could it's a
[3:15:00] recognition I I never did any of this
[3:15:07] your hands but the moment I wake up till
[3:15:11] I lay my head to bed
[3:15:14] it's all been your mercy and because of
[3:15:17] that All I Can Do Is Sing of Your
[3:15:20] goodness
[3:15:20] [Music]
[3:15:22] all my life you have been faithful
[3:15:25] there's never been a moment in my life
[3:15:27] where your faithfulness has left me
[3:15:31] never
[3:15:32] all my life you have been so so good
[3:15:36] everything I've been through even when I
[3:15:39] can't see it I know it's good
[3:15:43] I know it's for my good
[3:15:45] Ness
[3:15:47] with every breath that I am able I will
[3:15:50] sing of the goodness of God
[3:15:53] Lord I love your voice
[3:15:56] I love your presence when you come by
[3:15:59] there's nothing like it
[3:16:01] I long for it if only I could just have
[3:16:04] hear your voice
[3:16:07] it would make it all right again
[3:16:10] you've led me through the fire
[3:16:14] through these things that I couldn't
[3:16:16] imagine being able to go through and yet
[3:16:18] you've brought me through
[3:16:21] in the darkest night
[3:16:23] In My Darkest Hour
[3:16:25] even job job
[3:16:27] and that dark day of your birth
[3:16:30] God was faithful to you
[3:16:34] I've known you as a father
[3:16:36] I've known you as a friend
[3:16:39] and I have lived in the goodness of God
[3:16:41] let's sing that one more time Saints and
[3:16:45] just think about it think how these
[3:16:48] words affect you affect your life what
[3:16:51] you've been through and how God's
[3:16:53] brought you through and how he'll bring
[3:16:54] you through
[3:16:55] it's how can we do anything but sing of
[3:16:58] his goodness
[3:17:00] help me
