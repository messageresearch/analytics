[0:00] [Music]
[2:31] you hit a place where somebody say see
[2:33] somebody talking nobody else talking see
[2:36] well then one of the deacons walk up and
[2:37] say we uh we want you to worship during
[2:41] time of the service you see see it's not
[2:43] a house of talk it's a house of
[2:46] worship understand I think that was it
[2:49] please explain yeah let see please
[2:51] explain how to the Deacon should in the
[2:54] sanctuary that's all that's right that's
[2:56] it all right now here's the last one
[2:58] brother Brandon when we have
[3:01] uh
[3:02] had opportunities on the beginning of
[3:05] the service I'm come we had complaints
[3:09] it's WR real little I had complaints in
[3:12] it had complaints in the beginning of
[3:15] the service we have
[3:21] um we we we have songs we have songs
[3:27] testimon testimonies and prayers and and
[3:30] prayer request special singing and
[3:34] um you maybe get it get into the message
[3:38] getting into the message at 11 to or
[3:42] after but don't have too much don't have
[3:45] too much time for the word some of the
[3:48] people get restless and
[3:52] have leave before it is is
[3:57] before before it's over it's please
[4:00] explain how many songs and what time to
[4:05] start the message and some sometime we
[4:11] have prayer request and it in ends up in
[4:16] a testimony meeting some
[4:23] uh
[4:24] things that
[4:26] don't
[4:28] be don't seem time right at the time I
[4:32] hope I've got that Billy trying to help
[4:34] me here on the tape you have somebody in
[4:36] the M meeting in the service listening
[4:39] to what this was is Billy trying to help
[4:40] me read it because it's wrote very very
[4:42] fine and um I couldn't make it out I got
[4:45] the general
[4:47] idea it is that how many songs uh should
[4:51] we sing before starting the service and
[4:53] what time should service start now the
[4:56] first thing I want to make here is the
[5:01] confession and when I'm wrong I want
[5:03] admit I'm wrong see and I and I I'll
[5:07] make a confession here that I kind of
[5:09] the leader of that because it's been me
[5:12] holding these long services and things
[5:14] it's what got the church into this
[5:16] routine see of doing so but it shouldn't
[5:19] be and now remember I have I am telling
[5:23] you all Sunday night if the Lord willing
[5:25] on Sunday night and I'm trying to a lot
[5:28] my services from hence for if I have to
[5:30] stay a week extra till about 30 or 40
[5:33] minutes at the longest for my services
[5:35] because I found this that a service
[5:39] that's it stands up and the message is
[5:42] given and the power if you go too far
[5:44] you wear the people out and they don't
[5:46] get it the reason I've been given I know
[5:48] that all along the most successful
[5:50] speakers are those who have exactly
[5:53] Jesus is a man a few words watch his
[5:55] sermons watch Paul's sermon on the day
[5:57] of Pentecost probably taking me 15
[5:59] minutes he punched to there's something
[6:01] that that that sent 3,000 Souls into the
[6:04] kingdom of God see just R straight to
[6:07] the spot see and I I'm guilty because
[6:10] the reason I've have done this not
[6:12] because I didn't know different but I'm
[6:13] making haes see and these tapes will be
[6:16] played in houses for hours after hours
[6:19] after hours but as you'll find out the
[6:22] coming Sunday the reason I've done it
[6:24] this coming Sunday the reason I've done
[6:26] these things I might say it right now on
[6:27] the tape the reason that I have did this
[6:30] is because of this tremendous wait upon
[6:33] me for the message of this hour to get
[6:35] it out now the message is out now I'm
[6:39] taking a 30 minutes or something like
[6:41] that after the first of the year and my
[6:44] meetings out in the every World ago and
[6:46] try to even set my watch to 30 minute or
[6:50] not over 40 at the most punch to that
[6:52] message and make the alter call if I or
[6:55] whatever I'm going to do or call the
[6:56] prayer line and not take that much time
[6:58] because you do wear the people out I
[7:02] know that but look here I guess in the
[7:04] year we haven't had a dozen people get
[7:06] up and walk out and sometimes I keep
[7:08] them here for two and three hours see
[7:11] that's right because it's been making
[7:13] these tapes that goes all over the world
[7:15] see and the people out there they'll set
[7:17] for hours and listen to that ministers
[7:20] and so for Germany Switzerland Africa
[7:22] Asia and everwhere see listening to that
[7:25] but see for the sanctuary for the church
[7:29] and now that's all right if you're he
[7:30] making a tape and you got a 2hour tape
[7:33] put a 2hour message on it but if you're
[7:36] not making a tape for something like
[7:38] that then cut her
[7:40] message cut her message down I tell you
[7:44] why there some fill up easy some fill up
[7:47] long see like that and you've got to be
[7:49] the happy medium between it and how many
[7:52] times that we ruin our services by a
[7:54] dragged out testimony meeting which I
[7:57] know I'm guilty of doing it and you get
[7:59] out used to have Street meetings and
[8:01] some old brothers stand out there and
[8:03] he'll stand out and ask him to offer a
[8:04] word of prayer and he'll pray for the
[8:07] mayor of the city and for the governor
[8:09] of the state and for the president of
[8:11] the union and and uh everybody like all
[8:14] the pastors around and each one but
[8:15] number and sister Jones that's in the
[8:17] hospital and things like that and the
[8:19] people standing walking by on the street
[8:21] Mee you keep just keep on walking see it
[8:23] just wore them out we're just a see the
[8:26] main thing now your prayer is to be in
[8:30] secret your main long prayer Pray all
[8:33] enter into secret Closet close the door
[8:35] that is where you want to pray all day
[8:36] all night or two hours pray there but in
[8:39] here where you've got the attention of
[8:40] the people make your prayer short quick
[8:43] add it make all your service and put the
[8:45] most of your service time into that word
[8:49] that's the main thing punch that word
[8:52] just as hard as you can see get the word
[8:56] to the people now here's my suggestion
[8:59] now now remember I've confessed that I'm
[9:02] guilty of leading this on but then I've
[9:05] told you why I've Le it on I'm making
[9:07] two hour tapes to be sent overseas and
[9:09] everywhere of a message you see but the
[9:12] church shouldn't pattern that the
[9:15] message here at the Tabernacle after
[9:17] them tapes two hours to be gone places
[9:19] see and go out like that now here's what
[9:22] your order let me just give you an
[9:24] example would that be all right a
[9:27] suggestion I would say that the church
[9:30] should have its doors open at a certain
[9:32] time let the congregation come in let
[9:34] the songs be playing and let everybody
[9:37] come in to worship not to visit and
[9:39] don't let them visit afterwards tell
[9:40] them to dismiss and get out not to visit
[9:43] you wanted to visit there's a ho outside
[9:45] but this is the sanctuary let this be
[9:47] kept clean now if the spirit of the Lord
[9:50] is dealing here let's keep it Spirit of
[9:52] the Lord and and uh and it'll keep if
[9:55] you don't you just mark my words it's
[9:57] going to fall it's sure will and let's
[10:00] keep it's our duty that's why I'm here
[10:01] tonight just keep this thing lined up
[10:04] with these these ERS now
[10:06] look I would say this ordinarily unless
[10:10] we are giving out especially and tell
[10:12] them you're going to tape a message see
[10:15] now brother Neville has a message here
[10:17] that he's going to he's got a message he
[10:19] wants to get out to the people out on
[10:21] tape or something say now next Sunday
[10:23] night we're going to tape a 2hour tape
[10:26] three-hour tape or what or what more
[10:29] we're going to give a two or three hour
[10:32] tape or whatever it might be next Sunday
[10:35] night and then the people know and then
[10:38] when they come in say now we are going
[10:40] to tape a message tonight tonight and
[10:42] I've got a message here and I want to
[10:44] tape sent out I've been I feel led to
[10:47] send this message out it's going to be
[10:49] taped it maybe two hours 3 hours or
[10:51] whatever it is say that but ordinarily
[10:54] just as I do when I'm going into a place
[10:56] like one of them businessman's meetings
[10:58] or I'm out in my meetings out there for
[11:00] a prayer line if I stood up there and
[11:02] give a three-hour message of a night
[11:04] before having a healing service you see
[11:06] where it puts me see why the people next
[11:10] night your congregation's half of what
[11:11] it was see because they just can't do it
[11:14] they got to go to work and everything
[11:15] I'd suggest this that's ordinarily I
[11:19] watched brother Neville last night uh
[11:22] when he preached I know we all know
[11:24] that's a startling message I took notes
[11:26] I got here in my pockets to use another
[11:28] messages of my own that's right uh the
[11:30] way of Escape see and that was a
[11:33] marvelous message you see how quick he
[11:35] got that through see about 35
[11:39] minutes see and he he had it over now
[11:42] that was fine now and brother Neville
[11:46] usually his messages are like that see
[11:48] stop that WR see before you kill your
[11:50] meeting is all that draw out stuff
[11:53] before you get to it see now and and
[11:56] where you do that I know and I I I'm not
[11:59] saying that dishonor to you trustees or
[12:02] deacons or or pastor but I'm just
[12:05] telling you see what's trth and this is
[12:08] what it must be now you what does it now
[12:13] everybody you're all good nature every
[12:16] one of you man are good nature wasn't so
[12:18] I'd say all but brother so and so he's
[12:20] not got a good nature we're all praying
[12:22] for him but you you do have good natures
[12:24] and you're longsuffering gentle quite s
[12:27] man that's fine but don't be a
[12:30] with that Jesus is good nature too but
[12:33] when it come time to say things it's
[12:35] written my father's house is made the
[12:37] house of prayer and you're making it a d
[12:39] to thieves see he he know when to speak
[12:42] and when not to that's that's that's
[12:45] what we got to do see never was a person
[12:48] like Jesus he was God and remember he
[12:51] even talk about being a deacon in the
[12:53] church he he took over he ped some ropes
[12:56] togethers and he didn't wait to gently
[12:58] walk come out he beat him out see as a
[13:01] house of God and he was playing the part
[13:03] of a deacon for an example to you
[13:06] deacons see he was your example and now
[13:10] it's it's written my father's house is
[13:12] made a House of Prayer now remember
[13:14] Jesus was the Deacon man you know that
[13:17] Jesus is taking the part of a deacon
[13:19] when he come to the part of a pastor
[13:21] what do he say you blind Pharisees
[13:24] leaders of the blind see he take the
[13:27] part of a pastor then and when he told
[13:30] him what was going to happen he taken
[13:31] the part of a prophet see and when they
[13:35] required that there must be tribute
[13:37] played he taken the part of a trustee
[13:40] Peter go down and cast a hook into the
[13:42] river and the first fish you take up
[13:43] it's got a corn in his mouth pay him pay
[13:47] your just debts if it give Caesar what's
[13:49] Caesar God's what's God he was both
[13:51] Pastor Prophet trust the and Deacon sure
[13:55] what so then you see what he did let
[13:57] that be your example in the house here
[13:59] at this brandom Tabernacle that we want
[14:01] to be a house that he'll be honored in
[14:03] with everything every office every place
[14:06] that there'll be no taken back to be
[14:08] gentleness and sweetness and kindness
[14:09] but yet straight on the line every man
[14:11] said he supp to duty see that's the way
[14:14] that's the way he wants it he never slag
[14:17] when it come time to say call what was
[14:19] what he called it when it come time to
[14:21] show gentl in he showed gentl he was
[14:24] sweet kind understanding but Stern and
[14:27] everything was right to the dot with him
[14:29] and he did that for your example now the
[14:32] Holy Spirit just gave me that so I never
[14:34] thought about that him being Deacon
[14:36] before but he was see he he acted as
[14:38] deacon
[14:39] now I'd say this say if your services
[14:42] begin at 7:30 if that's the time open
[14:45] your church half hour beforehand it's
[14:47] 7:00 Let The Pianist telling Argan do
[14:50] you pay her you all pay the Argan is she
[14:53] PID her a Pianist she does it free will
[14:55] ask her with a gist even if she wants to
[14:57] have pay for it to give her something
[14:58] for it tell her we want her a half hour
[15:00] for service and if she says well I can't
[15:02] do it or something complaint then just
[15:04] have her come here and make a tape of
[15:07] some sweet organ music you see and let
[15:09] put that on the don't have to be here
[15:11] every time set your tape up see one of
[15:14] the deacons trusty orever open the
[15:16] janitor put it on up there the tape on
[15:18] and let it be play while the people com
[15:20] see because if the deacons are not here
[15:22] somebody that trustee or somebody be a
[15:24] to do it and let them play for a half
[15:26] hour but exactly 7 dir let that bell
[15:30] toll on top of the belly see you still
[15:33] have your bell out there yeah all right
[15:36] let your bell told at 7:30 and that
[15:38] means that we're not going to walk up
[15:39] and down the church and shake hands with
[15:41] Joneses and all that let the song leader
[15:45] be on the job if there's no song leader
[15:47] there let the Deacon see that there see
[15:50] that there's somebody to start leading
[15:51] songs and that Bell starts tolling turn
[15:54] to your hbook number so and so see Let
[15:57] It Be Right on the
[15:59] St at at 7:30 all right then I have a
[16:03] congregational song and then maybe a
[16:06] second congregational song and then have
[16:09] somebody already spoke of if you can to
[16:11] lead in prayer let the uh the pastor
[16:15] well the pastor shouldn't be there the
[16:16] song leader should do that if it's
[16:17] brother caps I think see you know what
[16:19] do let let him have someone spoke or he
[16:21] leading prayer have the congregation to
[16:23] stand in prayer see just stand up and
[16:26] let somebody lead in prayer now if you
[16:29] don't watch we believe that everybody
[16:31] should come to the house of God and pray

[16:34] you're in that Sanctuary conserve your
[16:36] time see you call them all up around the
[16:39] altar you'll find out there'll be
[16:41] somebody will'll be there for 15 20
[16:43] minutes your time's all run out that's
[16:46] you're see your praying's at home Jesus
[16:48] said when you pray don't stand like the
[16:50] Hypocrites do and for long make a long
[16:55] prayer and say this that or the other
[16:57] and all like that for a sh
[16:59] see he said when you pray pray enter
[17:01] into the closet secret Closet close the
[17:03] door behind you pray your father that
[17:05] says in secret he shall reward thee
