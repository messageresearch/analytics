[36:08] um
[36:08] he said we should say hi to the church
[36:10] he's doing very well
[36:13] um it's not been easy I remember talking
[36:15] to him that day and he said
[36:18] um there was a meeting
[36:19] they sat in the meeting
[36:21] um I hope I get this right they said in
[36:24] the meeting in the evening from 6 30 all
[36:27] the way to 5 A.M
[36:29] uh that was a marathon a really marathon
[36:33] of a meeting
[36:34] um it's it's it's it's it's just sad you
[36:38] know I've had the opportunity to talk to
[36:41] people
[36:43] um not just believers
[36:45] in our people who are referred to as
[36:47] unbelievers
[36:49] as a matter of fact some of them were
[36:51] even Muslims
[36:52] and then you talk to them
[36:55] and then they sit down and you see the
[36:58] conviction
[37:00] and then they are ready to talk peace
[37:03] they are ready to let go
[37:05] right and you wonder
[37:08] how on Earth
[37:10] children of God in fact we can be very
[37:13] very stubborn as a matter of fact
[37:16] that we believe in the world we so we
[37:19] say we read the word we have the message
[37:24] we probably know all the quotes
[37:27] but it is so so so difficult to let go
[37:31] Whenever there is Crisis
[37:33] and the word of God we can see in the
[37:36] word of God where we go wrong right we
[37:39] can see God talking to us and yet
[37:43] my goodness
[37:45] us it's just it's just so sad
[37:48] how on Earth
[37:50] how on Earth because I know
[37:54] some preachers went there and spent
[37:56] seven weeks
[38:00] seven weeks
[38:02] and they couldn't solve this problem
[38:03] whatever problem it was
[38:07] and here we have a group of preachers
[38:09] there
[38:10] sat down and that was not the first
[38:12] meeting from 6 30 pm
[38:16] to 5 00 am for goodness sake yeah for
[38:21] goodness sake
[38:24] in fact
[38:26] we all have our egos
[38:29] we all have our pride
[38:32] but you know
[38:35] if ever
[38:37] you get to a place
[38:39] and there are problems
[38:43] and you are sat down
[38:46] and you feel the weight of God talking
[38:49] to you I don't care what it is I don't
[38:52] care what it is
[38:55] be a child of God enough to let go
[39:01] be a child of God enough to
[39:04] have to praise be to God
[39:06] yeah it's sad I have spoken to Muslim
[39:09] couples unbelieving couples they don't
[39:12] go to church at all you know they have
[39:14] crisis they have problems
[39:16] and then
[39:17] I quote the scripture
[39:20] and they sit down
[39:22] and they are willing to talk
[39:26] they are ready to let go
[39:28] and you wonder believers
[39:31] yeah it's a shame
[39:36] praise be to God
[39:39] yes so
[39:41] um
[39:43] what
[39:44] okay so I didn't miss anything
[39:49] so by the grace of God we are going to
[39:51] look at a few things here just a Bible
[39:53] study
[39:55] last week's Sun uh not Sunday last week
[39:58] Tuesday
[40:00] as I Was preparing for the for the
[40:02] Wednesday service I had something on my
[40:04] mind which I shared
[40:06] but as I was thinking of it on on
[40:09] Tuesday that day
[40:11] something crossed my mind
[40:13] and um
[40:17] but it didn't take me away from what I
[40:19] was coming to talk about on Wednesday
[40:22] a lot of the times
[40:25] something like that comes
[40:28] um
[40:30] I guess look at the situation
[40:33] and I feel God talking to me maybe
[40:36] um go talk about this but it happened
[40:38] that it wasn't for that day
[40:40] and um I just thank God for everything I
[40:43] I had the time to take a few things down
[40:45] even though I've not been able to go
[40:47] through it
[40:49] um I'm just trusting God uh to help us
[40:52] tonight
[40:53] yeah
[40:54] a lot of the times
[40:56] when something jumps at me from nowhere
[40:58] I I just love it
[41:01] you know I just sit down and then uh
[41:03] when I can feel something coming I just
[41:06] put it down I just do a little reading
[41:09] um and then I just come and trust God
[41:12] it's not so much about what what I know
[41:15] no right
[41:17] um it's just trusting in the grace of
[41:19] God I remember there was a time
[41:21] something came to me I I wrote it down
[41:24] for probably six months nothing else was
[41:26] coming
[41:27] and I was just cleaning my computer my I
[41:30] just deleted it
[41:32] and probably two weeks later I just woke
[41:35] up from bed and here it comes again
[41:38] it was so vivid
[41:40] except I will never forget this
[41:43] normally I'll write it down sometimes
[41:45] I'll be driving I have a way of taking
[41:47] notes when I'm driving
[41:49] which I'm not going to share is my
[41:51] secret
[41:54] and what I do I make sure I get back to
[41:57] it before the end of the day
[42:00] if I don't get back to it before the end
[42:02] of the day the following day I would
[42:04] look at what I wrote down and it doesn't
[42:06] make any sense right yes
[42:10] so this thing came back
[42:15] and I didn't write it down because it
[42:16] was so clear
[42:19] I said I would never forget I got to
[42:21] work and I forgot every one of them
[42:24] it never came back again
[42:26] hopefully one day it will come
[42:29] praise be to God
[42:31] tonight shall we stand for the reading
[42:33] of the world turn our Bibles to Matthew
[42:35] 13 13.
[42:43] Matthew 13 13.
[42:56] I read
[42:58] therefore speak I to them in parables
[43:03] because this scene
[43:06] see not
[43:08] and hearing they hear not
[43:12] neither do they understand
[43:14] praise be to God
[43:16] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[43:19] reading of his word shall we be seated
[43:26] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[43:30] because they're seeing see not
[43:35] and here in the here not
[43:38] neither do they understand
[43:42] I titled this message tonight
[43:46] hiding in the fine prints
[43:48] in plain view
[43:52] hiding in the fine prints yeah in plain
[43:56] view now we all know what fine prints
[43:59] are
[44:02] you got a document
[44:05] and everything is legible
[44:08] you are able to read it
[44:10] but then
[44:13] you look at a portion of it
[44:16] and there are you can see they are
[44:19] always all right
[44:20] but very very very small
[44:25] that there is no way you can read it
[44:28] and these are the fine frames
[44:31] I am talking about
[44:32] so I decided to look out
[44:35] what is a fine print
[44:37] and the dictionary says
[44:39] it's an unconspicuous
[44:42] details
[44:44] or conditions
[44:46] printed in agreement or contract
[44:50] especially one that may prove
[44:54] unfavorable
[44:56] one that may prove unfavorable now the
[45:01] biggest word here is inconspicuous
[45:05] so what is inconspicuous inconspicuous
[45:09] is something that is not clear
[45:13] it's not clear
[45:16] either not clearly seen or not clearly
[45:20] understood right but it is not clear
[45:26] so
[45:28] what you are seeing
[45:30] definitely you are seeing something
[45:32] but it is not clear
[45:36] Now find Prince
[45:40] our statements and sentences even though
[45:43] it can be seen they are difficult to
[45:46] read
[45:49] with the naked eye
[45:52] you can read it
[45:55] but with a naked eye
[45:57] it is difficult
[45:59] to read it
[46:01] you almost always need
[46:04] help
[46:06] to read it you would need an aid
[46:09] to be able to read it
[46:13] now
[46:16] the addition definition says that it is
[46:19] something that is unfavorable
[46:24] how can somebody
[46:27] put down a fine print
[46:29] or write something and it will be
[46:32] unfavorable to him or him
[46:37] the person that is putting down this
[46:39] fine print
[46:41] is not put
[46:42] not put down
[46:44] against himself or herself right
[46:49] but the other party in the contract
[46:55] is if it is going to be unfavorable it
[46:58] will be unfavorable to the other party
[46:59] in the contract
[47:01] right
[47:02] not to the document originator
[47:08] so have that in mind
[47:11] as we push out tonight
[47:14] fine prints are always hiding something
[47:18] it's not meant for the eye to read or to
[47:21] see
[47:24] it has to be by the aid of reading
[47:27] glasses or
[47:29] um
[47:30] there's something they use in the in the
[47:32] in the lab micro microscope you can use
[47:36] that also
[47:38] praise be to God you can read all about
[47:41] your document
[47:43] and not read the fine prints I do that a
[47:48] lot I don't know how many people here
[47:50] are guilty of that
[47:52] that I can just re redefine from me just
[47:56] read what I see
[48:00] and I got to the fine print
[48:03] and nothing tells me
[48:06] that read what is here I just forget
[48:10] about it and I go my way
[48:13] right and a lot of us are actually
[48:15] guilty of this
[48:17] but until you read and understand the
[48:19] fine print
[48:20] you don't really understand what you are
[48:23] getting into
[48:26] it is hiding something
[48:30] and what it is hiding is not in your
[48:33] favor
[48:35] is in somebody else's favor
[48:39] and until you read that
[48:41] you don't know what you are getting into
[48:46] you may think you do understand or you
[48:49] know what you are doing
[48:50] but wait until there is a problem right
[48:53] and then you get to court
[48:56] and then they bring a document that you
[48:59] signed
[49:00] and then you look at it and say no
[49:03] I didn't sign for this
[49:05] and they will tell you that no it was
[49:07] part of the document you signed he said
[49:09] no I didn't see it he said no it was
[49:12] there but it was a fine print
[49:16] and the fighter the print
[49:18] the more dangerous things they have to
[49:20] hide
[49:23] don't worry so much about the things you
[49:25] can see and read what you should be
[49:28] concerned about
[49:31] are the things that are hidden
[49:34] from your eyes
[49:36] right
[49:38] if there is anything you ought to be
[49:40] more concerned about
[49:42] it is the things you are not
[49:45] not the things you see
[49:47] you see right praise be to God
[49:52] now
[49:55] we are talking about
[49:57] words
[50:00] that are put down
[50:02] written words
[50:05] now I would like to liken this
[50:08] also to parables
[50:12] a parable is not written down
[50:17] what is a word
[50:19] if I put my thoughts on a piece of paper
[50:22] it become a word
[50:27] I can decide not to put it on a piece of
[50:29] paper but I'll verbalize it it doesn't
[50:31] still take anything away
[50:34] so a parable
[50:37] also has Fine prints
[50:41] because they are things that are not
[50:44] clearly understood
[50:47] and parables are not
[50:50] clearly understood
[50:53] somebody tells you or gives you a
[50:54] parable it has a hidden meaning
[50:58] you would have to actually sit and think
[51:02] deep
[51:03] to be able to understand
[51:05] what they are telling you right
[51:08] it does it doesn't just come straight no
[51:12] for those of you that are so used to
[51:14] parables
[51:17] we come from a background where parables
[51:19] are used a lot
[51:20] right and when you sit with the old man
[51:22] they just speak one two three a parable
[51:25] goes for one two three a parable you are
[51:28] sitting right there
[51:30] and they are talking about things you
[51:32] are they hearing them yet you don't
[51:34] understand what they are talking about
[51:35] but they do
[51:38] why it has a hidden
[51:43] is hidden
[51:46] it's not clearly understood
[51:49] now
[51:50] tell your Bibles to 1334
[51:54] we are still in 13 34
[52:03] a little bible studies tonight
[52:08] 34 all these things spread Jesus unto
[52:12] the multitude in parables
[52:15] and without a parable speak he not unto
[52:20] them
[52:21] that it might be it might be fulfilled
[52:24] which was spoken by the prophet
[52:27] saying I will open my mouth in parables
[52:30] our other things
[52:33] which having kept secrets from the
[52:36] foundation of the world
[52:39] praise be to God
[52:41] still in 13
[52:43] if you can 10 to 10 just backtrack 10
[52:46] and 11.
[52:48] 13 10 and 11.
[52:52] and the disciples came and said unto him
[52:55] four speakers thou unto them in parables
[53:00] he answered and said unto them because
[53:03] it is given unto you to know the
[53:06] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[53:09] to them it is not given
[53:12] praise be to God like I was just using
[53:14] that example from the old man you sit
[53:17] with them and they are talking in
[53:18] Parables and you don't understand what
[53:20] they are saying but they understand
[53:22] exactly what they are saying
[53:25] so Jesus speaking in parables saying
[53:28] that it is meant for us to understand
[53:32] the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven
[53:35] but to them it is not right
[53:38] so you got to realize that for you to
[53:41] even understand the mysteries of God
[53:44] it must be given to you right
[53:48] right it is not your wisdom
[53:51] it's not how smart you are
[53:53] it is not how much education you have
[53:55] it is not an intellectual exercise
[53:59] it must be given you
[54:02] it is a gift
[54:05] because some people read the same thing
[54:08] who have had so much education
[54:12] as a matter of fact when you have your
[54:14] doctorate degree where else to go
[54:16] no place to go anymore
[54:18] we are pretty much done with education
[54:21] and yet
[54:22] they read probably something that is so
[54:27] easy to understand the simplest thing in
[54:31] the scriptures
[54:33] and you find them all over the place
[54:38] by the education they have
[54:41] evidently just take it out of their head
[54:43] and put it on you you can't even take a
[54:45] step
[54:46] that is how heavy it is
[54:50] praise the Lord
[54:52] but yet they don't understand the simple
[54:56] things
[54:57] pertaining to the kingdom of God
[55:01] it must be given you
[55:04] even to understand it must be given you
[55:09] praise be to God
[55:13] there is a fine print in the word of God
[55:18] and the fine print you'll find in the
[55:21] word of God
[55:23] it is so fine
[55:27] so fine
[55:29] that it fits in between the lines
[55:34] so fine
[55:37] if you are entering into a contract or
[55:40] into an agreement at least you can see
[55:45] that there is something
[55:47] but it's so fine I can't read it
[55:52] I need glasses
[55:54] or I need something else to be able to
[55:56] read
[55:57] but when it comes to the word of God
[56:01] it is so fine
[56:04] that you don't even see it that's right
[56:08] that's right it fits right in between
[56:10] the lines
[56:12] and is there
[56:16] that is how fine it is
[56:19] that you can read between you can just
[56:22] read the lines
[56:24] and think you have something
[56:26] and you have nothing
[56:34] we are talking about hiding in the fine
[56:37] prints in Plainview
[56:43] to hide something you want to put it
[56:45] away from people's eyes
[56:47] but this one is before you right before
[56:50] you and yet it is hidden
[56:56] so there is a fine print in the word of
[56:59] God and it's so fine that it fits in
[57:03] between the lines
[57:08] talking about the Ethiopia eunuch
[57:12] who went to Jerusalem to worship
[57:16] on this way the Bible says he was
[57:18] reading as Isaiah's
[57:22] we can take acts 8 27.
[57:29] acts 8 27.
[57:34] I will not read everything I have here I
[57:36] have 27 to 37
[57:39] you can read that when you get home
[57:42] um
[57:44] I'll just read 27 probably jumped
[57:46] somewhere else
[57:50] acts 8 27.
[57:57] and here Rose and went Behold a man of
[58:01] Ethiopia and Enoch of a great Authority
[58:04] and attendance Candace Queen of the
[58:07] Ethiopians who had a charge of all her
[58:11] treasure
[58:12] and had come to Jerusalem to worship
[58:15] was returning and sitting on his Chariot
[58:19] read Isaias the prophet
[58:22] then the spirit said unto Philip gone
[58:25] here and joined herself onto this
[58:27] Chariot let's read on
[58:30] I thought I was going to jump
[58:32] and Philip ran hither to him and had him
[58:36] read
[58:37] the prophet isaiahs and said understand
[58:41] as thou what thou readest
[58:44] and he said how can I accept someone
[58:48] should guide me
[58:51] praise be to God
[58:54] he was reading the book of Isaiah
[58:59] this was a man of authority
[59:02] I don't think
[59:04] the queen of Candace
[59:06] would put
[59:08] so much trust in a man like this
[59:11] if the man was just anonymity
[59:14] I believe he had praise
[59:16] I believe he had enough education
[59:18] yet he was reading
[59:21] the book of isaiahs he couldn't
[59:23] understand why she was what he was
[59:24] reading
[59:27] why
[59:29] because he was reading
[59:31] the lines
[59:35] but the true meaning of what he was
[59:37] reading was hidden in between the lines
[59:43] and he needed someone
[59:45] to help him
[59:49] a lot of the times
[59:52] there are things we don't understand
[59:56] we are not called to understand
[59:58] everything
[1:00:00] and something you don't understand there
[1:00:02] are people around you who do understand
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:07] and if nobody understands we know that
[1:00:11] the Holy Ghost is The Interpreter of his
[1:00:14] own word
[1:00:15] when you go sincerely you pray and seek
[1:00:19] the face of God concerning what it was
[1:00:21] that you read and do not understand
[1:00:24] God would Open the Eyes of your
[1:00:26] understanding
[1:00:30] sometimes it may not be in worse
[1:00:33] but God will just put you in a situation
[1:00:36] where you experience something
[1:00:39] and then here
[1:00:41] the understanding comes
[1:00:43] praise be to God
[1:00:45] that you don't only talk about it
[1:00:47] because you have experienced it
[1:00:50] and you know what you are talking about
[1:00:53] it is no longer the same
[1:00:56] because you know that you have heard
[1:00:58] from God yes
[1:01:01] we need help
[1:01:04] we need help
[1:01:08] sometimes you talk to somebody they'll
[1:01:10] say oh I got it I got it and yet you
[1:01:13] know they have not gotten it
[1:01:19] I can I can and they know they can't
[1:01:26] ask him for help is a smart thing to do
[1:01:30] it doesn't show any sign of weakness
[1:01:34] is rather a sign of weakness
[1:01:37] that you need help and you don't know
[1:01:40] you need help
[1:01:41] that is a sign of weakness
[1:01:44] but it's a sign of strength that you
[1:01:48] need help and you know you need help and
[1:01:50] you can come to a brother or a sister
[1:01:52] and you can discuss a problem with them
[1:01:55] and let them know you need help I will
[1:01:58] talk to your pastor or an elder or a
[1:02:00] dick is somebody you have trust in I
[1:02:02] need help it's a sign
[1:02:06] of strength not a sign of weakness
[1:02:11] oh when I say it your thing I don't know
[1:02:14] and they will laugh at me
[1:02:16] they are already laughing at you because
[1:02:18] they already know you don't know
[1:02:22] that Chinese have an adage an adage they
[1:02:25] say ask a question
[1:02:28] and be stupid for five minutes
[1:02:30] and don't ask a question and be stupid
[1:02:33] for the rest of your life yeah right
[1:02:36] yeah
[1:02:37] oh my
[1:02:40] when you ask a question and that people
[1:02:42] are going to laugh at you for how long
[1:02:45] for how long
[1:02:47] let's assume
[1:02:49] I don't know my left foot and my left
[1:02:51] right right
[1:02:52] and instead of wearing my shoes the
[1:02:54] right way I put the right leg in the
[1:02:57] left foot and vice versa like every
[1:03:00] child has ever done
[1:03:03] yes
[1:03:05] and then I walked out today
[1:03:08] and people look at me
[1:03:11] no way I go people look at me and don't
[1:03:13] be laughing
[1:03:15] but if I
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:17] if I can come and ask how do I do this
[1:03:20] they say oh so you don't know as old as
[1:03:22] you don't know and everybody laughs
[1:03:24] I may feel bad for a moment
[1:03:27] sure but I know what to do
[1:03:29] when I wear it people out there when
[1:03:32] they see me
[1:03:33] it's not written on my back right
[1:03:36] right now this guy going here he didn't
[1:03:38] even know his right and his left foot
[1:03:40] nobody knows that why
[1:03:44] ask questions
[1:03:47] ask questions absolutely
[1:03:50] praise be to God
[1:03:55] the Ethiopian Enoch
[1:03:58] did not look at his stature
[1:04:01] he wasn't
[1:04:03] there was no pride no he was humble
[1:04:06] enough
[1:04:08] to ask for help
[1:04:11] we know how the story ended
[1:04:15] when Philip was done with him
[1:04:17] fully did not even ask him to baptize he
[1:04:20] saw the water he said but there is water
[1:04:22] he was starting from being baptized
[1:04:25] what stops me he was ready
[1:04:29] he was ready
[1:04:32] praise be to God
[1:04:35] find Prince
[1:04:37] are not meant
[1:04:39] for everybody to see
[1:04:41] right
[1:04:43] it's only for those who have the eyes to
[1:04:46] see
[1:04:49] there are others that are satisfied
[1:04:53] with the lines
[1:04:55] they are satisfied with what they can
[1:04:57] see as I was saying a while ago that
[1:05:00] when I take a document I am guilty of
[1:05:03] this
[1:05:04] I read what I can see
[1:05:07] and that is how far I go I make my
[1:05:10] opinion and I'm done with it
[1:05:14] I'm satisfied what I see but that is a
[1:05:17] dangerous place to be
[1:05:21] they are simply not interested in the
[1:05:24] fine prints
[1:05:26] what they see is what matters
[1:05:30] but I'm here tonight to tell you
[1:05:32] what you see is not all that matters
[1:05:37] what you don't see
[1:05:39] marriage the most
[1:05:43] what you do not see
[1:05:46] matters the most
[1:05:51] what you see
[1:05:53] is just a fraction or a portion of it
[1:05:59] but a greater part which You Don't See
[1:06:03] matters the most
[1:06:07] we can stay on this
[1:06:09] till tomorrow morning
[1:06:13] but just to take an example
[1:06:17] now when Jesus told the disciples
[1:06:20] to go and preach the word and whoever
[1:06:23] receives the worship of Christ in the
[1:06:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] all right to be baptized in the name of
[1:06:29] Father's son holy ghost on the day of
[1:06:31] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down
[1:06:34] what did Peter say that repent he every
[1:06:37] one of you and be baptized in the name
[1:06:42] of the fire in the name of the Lord
[1:06:44] Jesus Christ and your your sins shall be
[1:06:47] forgiven
[1:06:50] when the Holy Ghost came
[1:06:52] they came changed now you tell people
[1:06:55] about this and they tell you no
[1:06:59] I want to stay with what Jesus said
[1:07:02] Jesus said we should baptize
[1:07:05] in the name of father son Holy Ghost
[1:07:10] you tell that nobody in the scriptures
[1:07:12] was ever baptized in the name of father
[1:07:16] son Holy Ghost they will tell you about
[1:07:18] whatever that was what Jesus said
[1:07:20] I'd rather stay with that I'm
[1:07:22] comfortable with that
[1:07:25] and they forget
[1:07:29] that the Holy Ghost
[1:07:30] was the one speaking through Peter and
[1:07:33] that it was not Peter it was not Peter's
[1:07:36] words right right
[1:07:40] it was
[1:07:45] Christ himself speaking through Peter
[1:07:50] and his life right there in between the
[1:07:53] lines
[1:07:54] that we read this over and over for
[1:07:58] years and for some people for decades
[1:08:00] and they never understood this until God
[1:08:03] sent us a prophet and he just came and
[1:08:06] made things so simple and then you sit
[1:08:09] down you ask yourself how come all these
[1:08:12] years
[1:08:12] I read this scripture over and over and
[1:08:16] yet never understood it
[1:08:24] he was just hiding
[1:08:28] in the fine prints in between the lines
[1:08:31] in plain view
[1:08:33] in plain view
[1:08:35] that you have the word before you
[1:08:38] and yet
[1:08:41] is hidden it's hidden from you yeah
[1:08:46] it's hidden
[1:08:53] the two disciples on their way to emails
[1:08:58] after the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:00] Christ
[1:09:03] I mean the disciples
[1:09:06] they were broken
[1:09:08] because they all knew
[1:09:10] that this was the man that was going to
[1:09:12] deliver Israel right
[1:09:17] and across they expected something to
[1:09:19] happen
[1:09:20] nothing happened
[1:09:22] he was crucified
[1:09:24] dead and buried
[1:09:26] these two were going back
[1:09:29] and they were just talking
[1:09:31] how that they thought he was the one
[1:09:34] that was sent to deliver Israel
[1:09:37] and all how that they left father and
[1:09:40] mother and followed him all these years
[1:09:43] and now they were going back to their
[1:09:45] roots
[1:09:46] and all of a sudden this stranger from
[1:09:49] nowhere
[1:09:50] appeared in their midst
[1:09:52] and started talking to them
[1:09:55] you fools
[1:09:57] slow to her to believe what the prophets
[1:09:59] have told you just started expounding
[1:10:02] the scriptures
[1:10:03] just started talking about himself and
[1:10:05] they wondered
[1:10:10] all these
[1:10:12] for the Lord Jesus we have never seen
[1:10:13] this man
[1:10:15] right but everything he's talking about
[1:10:17] is right on
[1:10:19] who is this
[1:10:21] he's not one of the disciples
[1:10:24] we never knew this man who is he
[1:10:27] and I went all day
[1:10:30] till it was time to break bread
[1:10:33] Their Eyes Were withholding
[1:10:36] that they should not know him they
[1:10:37] should not see him he was with them all
[1:10:41] the while
[1:10:42] you know talking to them
[1:10:45] so my soul that they were prick at heart
[1:10:49] and yet they did not know
[1:10:54] he was with them
[1:10:59] when they got to the time to eat
[1:11:03] they probably looked at one another in
[1:11:04] the face
[1:11:06] sister Joy I hope you are not sleeping
[1:11:09] then look at one another in the face and
[1:11:11] say you know what
[1:11:13] let this man here pray
[1:11:15] there is something about this man let
[1:11:17] him pray
[1:11:19] and when he prayed and broke the bread
[1:11:22] their eyes opened I
[1:11:25] and this matter was so hungry
[1:11:29] got So Satisfied
[1:11:31] that they didn't think of the bread
[1:11:33] anymore
[1:11:36] their eyes open
[1:11:39] but all that while he was hidden
[1:11:43] he was hidden behind the words
[1:11:46] they didn't see him
[1:11:52] hiding behind a prince in Plainview
[1:11:59] we can talk about the woman as well
[1:12:05] we know the conversation
[1:12:08] how it started
[1:12:11] till when the Lord Jesus told her to go
[1:12:13] and call her husband
[1:12:15] and she said she didn't have one
[1:12:17] and he told her yes
[1:12:20] you have had five already
[1:12:22] and even the one you are living with
[1:12:24] it's not your husband
[1:12:26] so what
[1:12:28] who is this man
[1:12:30] they have told me
[1:12:32] something that only I know
[1:12:35] and from there the ties changed yeah
[1:12:38] from there the conversation changed
[1:12:43] and all that while
[1:12:46] they were talking the Lord asked him for
[1:12:48] water to drink I mean you know the story
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:53] all that
[1:12:54] what was he doing he was hiding behind
[1:12:57] the word yes yeah he was hiding behind
[1:13:00] the word
[1:13:04] in Plainview
[1:13:06] in Plainview
[1:13:09] but he was hidden
[1:13:11] yes sir
[1:13:13] until he blew his cover
[1:13:18] and that sent this human running
[1:13:21] to the city of Samaria
[1:13:24] in the streets
[1:13:27] talking about the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:32] hiding in Plainview
[1:13:37] now Isaiah prophesied about him
[1:13:41] centuries of centuries I mean
[1:13:45] before he was born
[1:13:48] the scholars in those days
[1:13:53] had read about it in their Scrolls
[1:13:57] and they knew that I was coming a
[1:13:59] messiah yes
[1:14:03] remember
[1:14:05] they were under the rule of the Roman
[1:14:08] Empire
[1:14:10] and they knew there was a messiah was
[1:14:12] coming to be to liberate them from
[1:14:15] bondage
[1:14:18] there in their mind
[1:14:21] probably had a mental picture
[1:14:23] of how he was going to come
[1:14:25] even though they had read about it in
[1:14:28] the book of Isaiah
[1:14:30] say that unto us a child is born and
[1:14:34] unto us a son is given and the girl
[1:14:36] shall be upon his shoulder and his name
[1:14:38] Shall be Called counselor Mighty God
[1:14:40] Prince of Peace so forth they had read
[1:14:43] all about that yeah and yet they still
[1:14:47] had a mental picture of how the Lord was
[1:14:49] going to come and probably how he was
[1:14:51] going to deliver them how he was going
[1:14:53] to conquer the enemy they still had that
[1:14:55] in their mind
[1:14:57] right they read about all this in the
[1:14:59] Scrolls
[1:15:01] and yet
[1:15:03] when the Lord was born
[1:15:07] they did not recognize
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:11] they read about him
[1:15:14] and not only that they waited on him
[1:15:19] and here he comes he was born
[1:15:23] right before their eyes
[1:15:26] and yet
[1:15:28] they didn't organize
[1:15:32] ah they saw
[1:15:34] was one Carpenter's son
[1:15:37] right oh they saw
[1:15:40] was just an ordinary human being
[1:15:45] oh the children of Israel saw was
[1:15:47] another prophet
[1:15:49] mm-hmm oh a miracle performer
[1:15:53] A Healer
[1:15:55] that was all they were seeing
[1:15:59] and it was all good
[1:16:02] he was all of this
[1:16:05] but then
[1:16:07] he was hiding
[1:16:10] he was hiding
[1:16:12] behind all of this
[1:16:16] and the people were holding the Scrolls
[1:16:20] reading about it
[1:16:22] and yet the mother were reading about
[1:16:24] was right with them
[1:16:26] on the scene and yet he was hidden
[1:16:30] before their eyes
[1:16:34] he was hidden before the eyes
[1:16:40] it does not take theology
[1:16:43] to know who God is
[1:16:45] no
[1:16:48] there are people that know the Bible in
[1:16:50] and out
[1:16:53] before you quote the scripture they know
[1:16:55] where to find it
[1:16:57] they are so used to the Bible
[1:17:00] and yet
[1:17:04] they don't know
[1:17:06] what the Bible means
[1:17:08] right
[1:17:10] they take
[1:17:13] the letter
[1:17:15] and they run
[1:17:17] with the letter
[1:17:20] and not the word
[1:17:24] having the letter of the word
[1:17:27] doesn't mean you have the word
[1:17:30] sure
[1:17:32] you can have the letter
[1:17:35] and still not know anything about God
[1:17:39] because God is hidden
[1:17:43] behind the letter
[1:17:46] he does not take theology
[1:17:50] to figure that out
[1:17:54] it must be given you
[1:17:57] to know and to understand
[1:18:08] and sometimes
[1:18:10] we come so close
[1:18:13] so so so close
[1:18:17] to knowing who God is
[1:18:19] and yet
[1:18:21] we miss out
[1:18:25] I'm not talking of the people outside
[1:18:27] there
[1:18:28] I'm just talking about us
[1:18:31] how close
[1:18:33] how close we can get to
[1:18:36] knowing god
[1:18:38] and yet
[1:18:39] that slips from our hands
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:46] I remember in those days where we used
[1:18:47] to hunt
[1:18:48] in Africa
[1:18:51] we used to go with kwajals I mean how
[1:18:54] did they call it sticks
[1:18:56] and sometimes you see a rabbit
[1:19:01] here the rabbits are free nobody has
[1:19:04] time for them
[1:19:05] and you see a rabbit and people are
[1:19:07] throwing sticks here and there and
[1:19:09] sometimes you're able to jump and you
[1:19:11] grab it
[1:19:12] and then it slips out of your hands
[1:19:16] and then you feel so so bad
[1:19:19] and all your day is messed up
[1:19:22] it's better not to get close
[1:19:24] you know you never had a chance that to
[1:19:27] get so close and then get a hold of it
[1:19:30] and yet you lose it right
[1:19:35] it's difficult to forgive yourself
[1:19:40] sometimes we get so close
[1:19:43] so so close
[1:19:46] to knowing who God is
[1:19:49] to experience God
[1:19:51] and yet we allow that to sleep out of
[1:19:55] our lives
[1:19:58] if the unbeliever or The Sinner in the
[1:20:02] street
[1:20:02] would have to blame themselves on that
[1:20:05] day
[1:20:06] you blame yourself a hundred times
[1:20:10] because for them they never been cared
[1:20:14] they never showed any interest
[1:20:16] they never came any close
[1:20:18] but you did
[1:20:21] you put in some time you made some
[1:20:24] efforts
[1:20:25] some sacrifice you got very close and
[1:20:28] yet
[1:20:30] you did not get to experience the
[1:20:33] transformational power of God
[1:20:36] you just conform to the to the letter
[1:20:40] and you were satisfied with it
[1:20:43] you were just satisfied with being a
[1:20:45] church member
[1:20:47] just walking through the doors
[1:20:49] on Sundays on Wednesdays you were just
[1:20:52] comfortable with that and that was okay
[1:20:56] maybe somebody patting you on the back
[1:20:58] once in a while oh you are doing good
[1:21:00] you are doing well and that kicks into
[1:21:02] your head and you think that is fine
[1:21:05] no
[1:21:08] get to know God man
[1:21:13] never stop other man
[1:21:18] but Branham says if a man is following
[1:21:20] God follow him right right never stop at
[1:21:23] the man right
[1:21:26] right praise be to God
[1:21:29] get to know God
[1:21:37] imagine I never looked up the meaning of
[1:21:40] what a Manger is
[1:21:42] I never did
[1:21:44] today I decided to do
[1:21:48] the Lord Jesus was born in a manger
[1:21:53] and do you know what a Manger is
[1:21:55] it's a wooden box a long wooden box
[1:21:59] open
[1:22:01] that they put feet in there
[1:22:04] grass
[1:22:06] to feed animals
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:09] that is a Manger
[1:22:11] can you think about a lot of laws the
[1:22:14] King of Kings the almighty God
[1:22:18] oh my goodness
[1:22:21] being born in an open wooden box
[1:22:25] where feed is put for animals to come
[1:22:27] and feed
[1:22:29] and I was thinking about it
[1:22:32] and I said see
[1:22:34] it belonged to somebody
[1:22:37] and when he was born there probably the
[1:22:40] owner came and said oh what a beautiful
[1:22:43] young lady with a beautiful little boy
[1:22:46] oh sorry poor boy
[1:22:49] knowing not knowing that
[1:22:51] this was the Messiah
[1:22:54] right
[1:22:55] that was lying in the manger
[1:23:01] not born in the finest Hospital
[1:23:05] not in the finest house
[1:23:07] not in the palace
[1:23:10] in a Manger
[1:23:13] in a Manger
[1:23:14] the almighty God in human flesh born in
[1:23:17] a manger and maybe he just stood oh poor
[1:23:20] boy poor boy
[1:23:23] see how close he got
[1:23:26] but somewhere probably thousands of
[1:23:28] miles away in the fields there were
[1:23:31] three Shepherds that the angel of the
[1:23:33] Lord appeared to and announced the birth
[1:23:35] of Christ
[1:23:38] and they followed his star
[1:23:42] until they came
[1:23:45] and here he was
[1:23:47] here he was under his very nostrils he
[1:23:51] was just seeing another boy
[1:23:54] a very poor boy
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:58] a very beautiful lady giving birth to a
[1:24:01] very poor boy
[1:24:03] with this old man behind him
[1:24:05] oh very sorry not knowing that this was
[1:24:09] almighty God
[1:24:12] how close
[1:24:14] how close
[1:24:16] we sometimes get
[1:24:19] and we allow that opportunity to slip
[1:24:22] away
[1:24:25] we allow it to slip away
[1:24:29] right
[1:24:37] anybody that is building a house
[1:24:42] when they lay one course
[1:24:45] and they come the next time
[1:24:48] they are laying another course on what
[1:24:50] they have already started
[1:24:52] they don't break it down
[1:24:55] and start afresh
[1:24:58] if you have to break what you did the
[1:25:00] previous day
[1:25:03] to start
[1:25:04] that means you never have a building
[1:25:07] the only way
[1:25:10] you destroy what is already there and
[1:25:12] start afresh is when you realize
[1:25:15] that the footing was wrong
[1:25:17] there it was on a wrong Foundation
[1:25:20] then you have to destroy it and make
[1:25:22] sure
[1:25:23] that this time you are getting your
[1:25:25] answer
[1:25:26] right
[1:25:27] whatever you pick from every service
[1:25:31] whatever you pick from every time with
[1:25:35] any time I mean any time you have a
[1:25:38] communion with God whether you are
[1:25:40] listening to a tape to a message whether
[1:25:43] you are reading your Bible whether it is
[1:25:45] in service whatever it is whatever God
[1:25:48] lays on your heart
[1:25:50] don't let the slip away
[1:25:53] add to it
[1:25:56] add to it
[1:25:58] don't lose it and start afresh from the
[1:26:01] ground or something else every day you
[1:26:04] are starting something new and whatever
[1:26:06] God gives you you are losing that and
[1:26:08] you are starting from the ground from
[1:26:10] the scratch almost every time you will
[1:26:13] never grow in Christ
[1:26:21] whatever God lays on your heart
[1:26:25] keep it you know as you fight for more
[1:26:31] don't let it slip by
[1:26:34] do not let it slip by
[1:26:39] Jesus talks about the queen of the South
[1:26:45] if we can turn our Bibles to Matthew 12
[1:26:48] 42
[1:27:04] Matthew 12 42.
[1:27:12] the queen of the sun shall rise up in
[1:27:15] the judgment
[1:27:16] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:27:19] it
[1:27:21] for she came from the utmost part of the
[1:27:24] air to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[1:27:26] and behold
[1:27:28] a greater than Solomon is here
[1:27:31] right praise be to God a greater than
[1:27:34] Solomon is here it's sad that what the
[1:27:39] queen of the South
[1:27:40] that is the Queen of Sheba what she saw
[1:27:44] is Solomon
[1:27:47] that today
[1:27:49] we are not seeing it
[1:27:53] Christ
[1:27:58] she saw something
[1:28:00] if she had not anything she would not
[1:28:03] embark on that Journey
[1:28:06] she truly saw something
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:11] and it was a man just the wisdom of a
[1:28:14] man
[1:28:16] of course it's not the Wiz God gave it
[1:28:18] was the gift of God
[1:28:20] right
[1:28:21] and that caused the queen of the South
[1:28:25] to go all the way from Ethiopia
[1:28:30] to Jerusalem
[1:28:34] and what she saw
[1:28:37] today
[1:28:40] Christians
[1:28:42] are not seeing it
[1:28:51] no wonder
[1:28:53] he says
[1:28:55] that this generation will be condemned
[1:29:02] I'm taking this from the ministry
[1:29:04] explained
[1:29:07] the prophet of God
[1:29:09] said
[1:29:12] notice he said
[1:29:15] and the queen of the South
[1:29:19] which was the queen of Shiva she will
[1:29:22] raise in the in this generation and
[1:29:24] condemn it
[1:29:26] for she came from the uttermost parts of
[1:29:28] the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[1:29:30] and yet I say unto you that a greater
[1:29:34] than Solomon is here notice he was
[1:29:37] condemning them because they hadn't
[1:29:40] recognized the anointed spirit
[1:29:43] that was on him of God
[1:29:47] they tried to class him
[1:29:50] as a Madman
[1:29:52] they tried to class the ministry
[1:29:54] explained
[1:30:01] the minister explained
[1:30:04] um him as a devil a devil possessed man
[1:30:08] doing Miracles by the devil he said
[1:30:11] those people
[1:30:14] and you great ecclesiastics
[1:30:17] in the other words
[1:30:19] who sit over here
[1:30:21] with your fancy buttons
[1:30:24] and your role
[1:30:26] to be called doctor and rabbi
[1:30:29] and the people in Nineveh who didn't
[1:30:32] even know which was the right which was
[1:30:35] right and left hand repented
[1:30:40] and when they saw the sign of the
[1:30:43] anointed prophet Jonah come out of the
[1:30:45] belly of the whale after being there
[1:30:48] three days
[1:30:49] and give a message
[1:30:52] an ignorant illiterate people
[1:30:54] will raise up in the day
[1:30:57] would raise up in the day of judgment
[1:31:01] and condemn you Ecclesiastes you see and
[1:31:05] he said the Queen of Sheba
[1:31:07] a hidden country
[1:31:10] pagan
[1:31:11] come out and head the wisdom of Solomon
[1:31:14] yet being a pagan
[1:31:17] and she will rise in the judgment
[1:31:20] and condemn you bunch of preachers
[1:31:23] because she comes from the outermost
[1:31:25] parts of civilization
[1:31:27] to hear the wisdom of Solomon see
[1:31:30] he was upgrading them
[1:31:34] because many signs had been done of the
[1:31:37] Messianic sign
[1:31:39] and they still refused
[1:31:42] to hear it hard-hearted
[1:31:45] they were indoctrinated
[1:31:48] oh mine they had b a b d all kinds of
[1:31:52] degrees
[1:31:53] but they fail to see that he was the
[1:31:57] Messiah
[1:31:59] they failed to recognize it
[1:32:02] through the scriptures
[1:32:04] though the scripture said
[1:32:06] that those things would be
[1:32:09] and may I stop here a minute and say
[1:32:13] my manager said a few minutes ago
[1:32:17] if God
[1:32:19] doesn't send judgment upon this United
[1:32:21] States soon
[1:32:23] to be a just God he will have to
[1:32:26] resurrect Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:32:30] apologize to them
[1:32:31] praise be to God
[1:32:51] and he's talking about divorce race
[1:32:52] going up
[1:32:55] um women are dressing well uh Industries
[1:32:58] drinking and carousing
[1:33:01] um let me just jump down here making fun
[1:33:04] of Divine Healing and power of the
[1:33:06] resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:33:09] let me drop
[1:33:12] now you know how long it taken her to
[1:33:15] travel talking about the Queen of Sheba
[1:33:17] three months
[1:33:19] when Solomon's gift was recognized among
[1:33:22] the people
[1:33:24] that he was
[1:33:26] A Gifted Man
[1:33:27] that God
[1:33:29] was with Solomon everybody come from
[1:33:33] everywhere to see Solomon because he had
[1:33:36] a Divine gift that was an oppression and
[1:33:40] it proved itself
[1:33:43] the Bible said God will testify of his
[1:33:46] gifts
[1:33:48] he always has
[1:33:50] and he always will
[1:33:52] might be a lot of things said that
[1:33:55] wasn't right but God will testify of his
[1:33:57] gifts you don't believe the Holy Ghost
[1:34:01] is a gift of God let it come on you one
[1:34:05] time and God will testify of his gifts
[1:34:09] now everybody would come down
[1:34:12] into this country several hundred miles
[1:34:15] from Palestine across the desert
[1:34:18] everyone would come by the Queen of
[1:34:21] Sheba kept hearing oh the great God of
[1:34:26] the Israelites has anointed a man
[1:34:29] and give him a gift his name Solomon he
[1:34:33] is the king of thee everyone must pass
[1:34:36] by
[1:34:37] and all at once
[1:34:40] Jesus said
[1:34:42] Jesus said this
[1:34:43] when he was here on Earth
[1:34:46] no man can come to me except my father
[1:34:51] draws him
[1:34:53] he said you got ice
[1:34:57] and you can't see
[1:34:59] you got ears
[1:35:01] and you can't hear
[1:35:04] you fulfill the scriptures
[1:35:06] God has said that
[1:35:08] now he said no man can come to me except
[1:35:12] my father draws him first
[1:35:13] but somehow down in the heart of that
[1:35:17] Queen of Sheba there was a desire to see
[1:35:20] the great gift of God
[1:35:23] she wouldn't
[1:35:26] she she had taken the other man's word
[1:35:30] but she wanted to see it for
[1:35:34] that's just exactly what Philip told
[1:35:37] Nathaniel said come and see for yourself
[1:35:41] yes
[1:35:42] one will criticize it
[1:35:44] don't take that
[1:35:46] somebody else says come
[1:35:49] see yourself
[1:35:51] test and see
[1:35:53] the Lord is good
[1:35:55] try it once
[1:35:57] praise be to God
[1:35:59] come and see it for yourself
[1:36:04] a lot of the times we stop
[1:36:08] at the letter
[1:36:11] until you see God as your lord and
[1:36:15] personal savior
[1:36:20] it is not going to help you in any way
[1:36:24] you say oh he was one of the prophets
[1:36:27] that is good
[1:36:28] the Muslims believing to be one of the
[1:36:30] prophets yeah
[1:36:32] he was a Healer yes
[1:36:38] he was a good man yes but until you see
[1:36:42] him as your personal Lord and savior
[1:36:46] right you will perish right yes
[1:36:51] don't get too close
[1:36:57] to knowing him
[1:36:58] and let that opportunity pass by
[1:37:01] right
[1:37:03] we have come too close
[1:37:08] too too close
[1:37:14] do not let this opportunity pass by
[1:37:20] it was told Simon
[1:37:25] let me go now
[1:37:30] it is not how long
[1:37:33] it is not how long
[1:37:37] you have been in the message
[1:37:41] it is not how long you will read in your
[1:37:44] Bible no
[1:37:48] it is not how long
[1:37:53] knowing him
[1:37:55] his life
[1:37:58] can you imagine his disciples had worked
[1:38:01] so long with him
[1:38:03] one time he asked them a question who do
[1:38:05] men say I am
[1:38:08] they said you are this they said you are
[1:38:10] dead they say you are this they say you
[1:38:11] are that
[1:38:13] they were quick to say it
[1:38:15] and when he asked
[1:38:17] but who do you say I am the place was
[1:38:20] quiet
[1:38:22] it was quiet
[1:38:25] and Sarah Peter said
[1:38:28] you are the Christ the son of the Living
[1:38:30] God
[1:38:32] and the Lord Jesus told him
[1:38:35] that flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:38:38] this to you but I tell you
[1:38:41] Sound by Jonah
[1:38:44] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:38:47] the guest of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:38:49] against it
[1:38:52] praise be to God we thank God for the
[1:38:54] prophet of God
[1:38:56] events we turn the scriptures upside
[1:38:59] down
[1:39:00] yes and we read them
[1:39:02] and we thought we were intellectuals we
[1:39:05] didn't know we didn't know anything
[1:39:13] the Church of the Living God is built
[1:39:19] not in the book of the Revelation as com
[1:39:22] as as in as as in the Book of Revelation
[1:39:26] it's built on the revelation of who
[1:39:30] Jesus is
[1:39:33] amen
[1:39:36] that is the Church of the Living God
[1:39:42] when you know who the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39:44] is
[1:39:47] and he becomes your foundation
[1:39:50] he becomes your God
[1:39:53] your lord your strength your Shield
[1:39:57] The Gaze of hell would come against you
[1:39:59] amen amen but they will not Prosper yes
[1:40:03] the guest of heaven will rise against
[1:40:05] you
[1:40:08] but by the grace of God
[1:40:10] you are going to overcome
[1:40:12] because we have the promise
[1:40:15] it takes revelation
[1:40:18] to know who Jesus is
[1:40:20] revelation
[1:40:23] to know who God is
[1:40:27] God did not bring us to the letter
[1:40:32] your education
[1:40:34] brings you to the letter right
[1:40:39] your education helps you
[1:40:41] to be able to read your Bible
[1:40:44] because you have learned how to read
[1:40:48] so you are able to read
[1:40:51] that is how good
[1:40:53] your education is
[1:40:55] it brings you to the letter
[1:40:59] it takes something else
[1:41:02] to take you beyond the letter yes into
[1:41:05] the word
[1:41:11] and this is where a lot of the times we
[1:41:14] have problems
[1:41:16] that we read the letter
[1:41:18] and we think we understand
[1:41:21] but until you get into the fine prints
[1:41:25] which is Reading in between the lines
[1:41:29] getting into the revelation of the word
[1:41:31] of God you have understood nothing
[1:41:36] you've understood not what
[1:41:39] because the Church of the Living God is
[1:41:42] built on the revelation
[1:41:45] of who Jesus is
[1:41:49] and until you get into that revelation
[1:41:55] the Bible says that the letter caliph
[1:41:57] all you have is the letter
[1:42:00] there is no life in it
[1:42:03] all you have is the letter there is no
[1:42:05] life in it
[1:42:09] and God did not call us
[1:42:12] right
[1:42:14] to the letter
[1:42:19] in the beginning was the word
[1:42:22] the word was with God
[1:42:24] and the Word was God
[1:42:30] this is God on Prince
[1:42:35] that when you open your Bible
[1:42:38] you are just looking at God
[1:42:43] now he is not hidden
[1:42:45] he's not hidden
[1:42:48] you are looking at him yes
[1:42:51] yes in the face
[1:42:57] and yet
[1:42:59] he is hidden
[1:43:01] and yet he is hidden
[1:43:04] he is hidden in Plainview
[1:43:08] that you are looking at him and yet he
[1:43:10] is hidden in Plainview
[1:43:13] behind the fine print
[1:43:16] right
[1:43:18] any time you read your Bible
[1:43:21] and you don't see God
[1:43:23] go back
[1:43:28] when you read your Bible and you don't
[1:43:30] see God go back read it again
[1:43:35] it's not reading a page or two a day or
[1:43:38] reading a chapter a day or 10 chapters a
[1:43:41] day
[1:43:42] no that doesn't mean anything if you can
[1:43:45] read all the Bible in a day and yet you
[1:43:47] don't even understand anything it's
[1:43:49] useless everybody
[1:43:51] that is just a mental exercise
[1:43:57] you can just take one
[1:44:03] and then Justice come you can't just
[1:44:07] move away and sometimes you don't
[1:44:09] understand why you can't move away from
[1:44:11] that scripture
[1:44:13] and when you think you are done
[1:44:14] something else is coming
[1:44:16] and when you think you are done
[1:44:18] something else is coming one thing
[1:44:20] leaning to another another thing leading
[1:44:22] to another right
[1:44:24] when you read your Bible and you don't
[1:44:27] see God go back and read it again
[1:44:31] you have left
[1:44:33] the most important things
[1:44:36] of the scriptures
[1:44:39] this Bible is all about God
[1:44:44] when you read
[1:44:46] and you don't see God in between the
[1:44:48] lines
[1:44:49] when you read
[1:44:51] and God does not talk to you and all you
[1:44:54] are seeing is just the black and the red
[1:44:57] letters and you are not seeing in
[1:45:00] between the lines you are not seeing
[1:45:02] anything behind what you are reading
[1:45:04] right stay there and pray and ask God
[1:45:08] to help you praise be to God
[1:45:13] stay there
[1:45:16] there is something in the word of God at
[1:45:18] all times for every one of us
[1:45:24] it's like somebody Harvest a field and
[1:45:28] um people go back to Glenn
[1:45:31] I remember when I was a child I used to
[1:45:32] do it
[1:45:34] people harvest their filled and will go
[1:45:37] inside and go and glean
[1:45:38] and you go you glean and sometimes you
[1:45:43] think you have gotten the last one out
[1:45:46] no
[1:45:48] you pass by another time and you see
[1:45:50] somebody coming out with something
[1:45:52] probably a bucket full
[1:45:54] and you probably got Just One Bowl
[1:45:57] and somebody's coming out with a bucket
[1:45:59] full
[1:46:00] from the same field
[1:46:04] and you wonder
[1:46:06] whether you did a good job when you came
[1:46:08] there the first time right man
[1:46:15] there is something
[1:46:17] in the word of God
[1:46:19] for everyone of his children at all
[1:46:22] times praise be to God
[1:46:24] so remember
[1:46:25] in closing the musicians can come over
[1:46:29] that God
[1:46:31] does not bring us to the letter
[1:46:34] he brings us to the world
[1:46:37] and the word is a person
[1:46:40] and God wants you
[1:46:44] to know him in his death
[1:46:47] barrier
[1:46:49] and in the power of his his resurrection
[1:46:53] praise be to God
[1:46:55] wants you to know him
[1:46:59] not the letter not stay or stop at the
[1:47:03] letter but God wants you to know him yes
[1:47:09] in his death and barrier and in the
[1:47:11] power of his resurrection
[1:47:14] anything less than that
[1:47:17] you have lost the requirement
[1:47:23] praise be to God
[1:47:25] is in plain view
[1:47:28] God is in plain view and yet
[1:47:32] if you do not have the revelation
[1:47:36] of the word
[1:47:39] even though he's in plain view
[1:47:42] he is still hidden
[1:47:45] they still hidden from you
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:54] takes revelation
[1:47:57] and Brett random said
[1:47:59] that the importance
[1:48:02] of Revelation
[1:48:04] by the spirits
[1:48:06] to a True Believer
[1:48:09] can never be overemphasized
[1:48:14] Revelation comes from the spirit
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:19] that God comes and he opens your
[1:48:21] understanding
[1:48:23] the things that were veiled
[1:48:27] Once Upon a Time and did not make sense
[1:48:30] now begin to make sense to you
[1:48:35] now you look at it
[1:48:37] and it's like it was never there before
[1:48:40] it's like you are just saying it for the
[1:48:42] first time
[1:48:43] it strikes you and it stress you so deep
[1:48:48] and you know that it is God
[1:48:51] nothing else but God
[1:48:55] praise God
[1:48:59] hiding
[1:49:03] hiding in the fine points
[1:49:06] Plainview
[1:49:09] the Bible says
[1:49:12] that if this gospel
[1:49:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ is hate
[1:49:18] is hit to them
[1:49:22] that are perishing
[1:49:25] is he to them that perish
[1:49:29] not to us
[1:49:31] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:49:35] yes this gospel is hate
[1:49:39] to some people but not to you and me
[1:49:46] we have the opportunity
[1:49:50] our opportunity
[1:49:52] not very many people have had
[1:49:55] to work with God
[1:49:58] to have a relationship with God
[1:50:01] live a Godly life
[1:50:04] to live a clean life
[1:50:08] to be true Representatives
[1:50:10] of Christ
[1:50:12] here on Earth
[1:50:14] we have that opportunity
[1:50:17] it's just the grace of God and what the
[1:50:19] grace of God has done in our lives
[1:50:23] she always done on our feet
[1:50:26] and I want us to go before the Lord in
[1:50:28] prayer
[1:50:29] just talk to God
[1:50:34] talk to God
[1:50:37] if this gospel is hit
[1:50:40] to them
[1:50:44] that perish
[1:50:49] if the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:51] is hid from you
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:55] just ask the grace of God tonight
[1:50:59] that he be merciful and help you
[1:51:03] bring you to a place
[1:51:06] where you would appreciate what he is
[1:51:08] doing in your life because you get to
[1:51:09] understand it the more
[1:51:12] it will be it will no longer be what
[1:51:14] people say but you know for a she
[1:51:16] already that it is God and not a man
[1:51:21] shall we pray
[1:51:26] our Lord and our savior Jesus
[1:51:31] wait thank you so much for your word
[1:51:33] that has come to us tonight oh God
[1:51:38] even though father they are broken
[1:51:40] pieces of words
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:43] we are trusting and believing in you
[1:51:45] father oh God
[1:51:47] that you will let your sons and
[1:51:48] daughters father oh God
[1:51:50] as millions of gathered tonight and has
[1:51:53] made us are following the service online
[1:51:54] and as many as of all these Services
[1:51:57] later father oh God that when they do
[1:51:59] hear it father it would make sense for
[1:52:03] them
[1:52:04] foreign
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:16] of God it must be given to us
[1:52:21] there is no way we can understand your
[1:52:23] word
[1:52:24] by our intellect
[1:52:26] or by book knowledge the best that can
[1:52:30] come out of us is just intellectual
[1:52:31] knowledge
[1:52:33] but father we need a true transformation
[1:52:36] we don't need to conform to the word of
[1:52:39] God when we can be transformed
[1:52:42] where we can be transformed by the
[1:52:45] renewed of our mind why we can be
[1:52:47] transformed by the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:52:51] father we pray oh God
[1:52:54] when we do open our Bibles
[1:52:56] do not let us stop at the letter
[1:52:59] because you have no brother's father or
[1:53:02] God to the letter because your holy word
[1:53:05] says that the letter killeth
[1:53:07] but a spirit give us life father help us
[1:53:11] to read in between the lies because
[1:53:14] there is always something in between the
[1:53:17] lines for your children
[1:53:19] open our eyes to see
[1:53:21] those fine prints those fine prints in
[1:53:26] between the lines
[1:53:28] which the eyes cannot see
[1:53:31] open our eyes to see
[1:53:34] open our eyes our spiritual eyes
[1:53:38] to see those fine prints Lord
[1:53:41] because there is always something
[1:53:44] in your word for us
[1:53:47] do not let us open the Bible
[1:53:51] and just read the letter and be content
[1:53:55] with it
[1:53:56] do not let us listen to the messages
[1:53:58] or read the messages father and be
[1:54:02] content
[1:54:03] with what we see for there is always
[1:54:06] something we cannot see something hiding
[1:54:10] behind a word
[1:54:12] we pray dear Lord Jesus come and open
[1:54:17] our eyes to these things
[1:54:20] you're probably Brandon said
[1:54:23] that the importance of Revelation by the
[1:54:26] spirit to a True Believer can never be
[1:54:29] overemphasized
[1:54:31] father we pray oh God
[1:54:33] may you reveal yourself to us
[1:54:37] for the word is a person
[1:54:39] the word is a person
[1:54:43] and you want us to know you
[1:54:46] in your different barrier and in the
[1:54:48] power of your resurrection and do not
[1:54:51] let us stop at anything
[1:54:53] do not let us be content with being
[1:54:57] members of a church
[1:54:59] let us be content
[1:55:02] working in on Sundays and Wednesdays
[1:55:04] Lord
[1:55:05] for there is more to that Lord there is
[1:55:08] more to that we pray in the name of
[1:55:12] Jesus
[1:55:14] may you transform Us
[1:55:16] by Your Word of Life
[1:55:19] and help us in our work with you
[1:55:23] we just thank you so much for how far
[1:55:27] you have brought us tonight
[1:55:29] and as we leave your presence father we
[1:55:31] pray
[1:55:32] help us to meditate on these things
[1:55:37] I know
[1:55:39] that there are a lot of things
[1:55:40] fatherhood God that would have been said
[1:55:45] it's never said
[1:55:47] dear Holy Spirit
[1:55:49] may you bring these things to
[1:55:50] remembrance to your children may you
[1:55:53] remind your children of these things
[1:55:56] may you speak to every need Lord every
[1:55:59] need
[1:56:01] may you look down
[1:56:03] you don't see us from the inside
[1:56:06] you know what we are going through
[1:56:10] you know the storms
[1:56:13] you know what we have to deal with
[1:56:15] father we prayed it tonight in the name
[1:56:19] of Jesus oh God
[1:56:22] may you speak to every need
[1:56:26] may you continue to to be our strength
[1:56:29] in our Shield
[1:56:34] we thank you Father
[1:56:36] and we bless you tonight oh God for
[1:56:39] everything you've done for us that we
[1:56:41] are so grateful for our fathers tonight
[1:56:45] may you prepare us
[1:56:49] foreign
[1:56:52] of our Lord and our savior Jesus
[1:56:58] that we shall be prepared
[1:57:01] when he comes knocking at the door
[1:57:05] thank you Father
[1:57:07] and praise be to that Holy neighbor
[1:57:11] in Jesus name
[1:57:14] amen
[1:57:18] we commit everyone into your hands
[1:57:20] tonight father
[1:57:22] those that are working tonight father we
[1:57:24] pray may you be with them may you see
[1:57:27] them through the night how do they
[1:57:28] perform their duties
