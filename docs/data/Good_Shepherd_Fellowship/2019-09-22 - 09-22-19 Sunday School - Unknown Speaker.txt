during the course of this Sunday school Lord and somehow father touch our hearts Lord and glorify yourself in Jesus name Amen praise be to God yeah I want to use this opportunity to thank every one of you for your prayers were in Detroit Lakes last week for a wedding it was a colleague's wedding it was a wonderful moment you know I always had you know wise don't have very big weddings normally a small wedding but I was surprised between 250 and 300 people not surprising they were saying that was probably the wedding the wedding of the season and whatever they said yeah so it was so wonderful and I had to read some scriptures they requested that I did it and I brought up the set a few things I don't even remember everything I said but it was just so amazing after the program you know people were just looking for me here and there telling me how they felt so blessed and I was just amazed you know how God does things so god bless you of your prayers we went and we are back praise God so by the grace of God we are still looking at our topic prayer we were probably supposed to be closing the chapter on this topic but but I want as I we stay on this topic for a little while maybe do a revision so we are going to do some little revision I don't know how is going to go but I'm trusting that God would glorify himself in all of this praise the Lord so for everything I want us to take look 22 you Luke 22:31 32 and a lot said Simon Simon behold Satan have desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that I faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren praise be to God Satan has desired to have you better have prayed that your faith fail not but when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren now I have prayed for thee I have prayed for thee this is what I want us to have at the back of our minds as we look at this scripture I have prayed for thee this reminds me of father song brother one taught us last two weeks ago was the last three weeks ago and while somebody prayed for you somebody had you in his mind and he prayed for you it was a wonderful song when we got home my song leader in the house for every devotion you bring that song off every devotee who bring that song up and every day he was up and down singing that song I wasn't surprised he came to church and he had to sing a special and it was a special somebody prayed for you and for all of us somebody prayed for us somebody had it in his mind or in her mind somebody prayed for you Jesus told Peter I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not I have prayed for thee all of us have come this far because somebody had us on their mind and somebody prayed for us praise be to God last month when I stood behind there and I was listening to brother Ezekiel giving his testimony I said to myself I said somebody prayed for him whether that he was praying or mommy was praying or pasta was praying or the church was praying or SISTAR's brother was praying somebody prayed for him because a man that has gone through all that and can still be a good testimony in the household of God somebody must have prayed for him praise be to God Peter I have prayed for thee that I faithful not remember we are so talking about prayer sometimes we do not live long enough to see when our prayers have been answered but in a prayer that is said in faith I can assure you even though we would die and go that prayer has been said in faith would put go to work and God will still be working praise be to God I don't care what it is that happens our players would never go in vain if that prayer is said in faith said by faith let's Christ hurry let us die and go that prayer is going to be answered will not only be here to see when it is been answered by praise be to God one day we would know that the prayer was answered somebody how do you honest mind somebody prayed for you somebody prayed for you you know for all of us somebody is keeping us in prayer you may never get to know who is praying for you you may never get to know but somebody is praying for you that is why we have all come this far praise be to God I can give my personal testimony when I was at my lowest low my lowest low I had a dream one day that a raptor took place and I didn't make it in the rapture and I got so terrified in a dream where a group of people just running up and down just running up and down and then we met this brother a minister and we met him and all of us just run to him and when we got there and we are calling his name and calling his name that he stood and was looking at us and then I remember probably 16 17 18 years ago remember and then he pointed at me and pray there are two other people and he asked us to go and appeal for our case and the rest go away so as I started walking I got to a place and I opened my eyes and I said wow so it was a dream praise God it was a dream in fact if I was a movie actor you couldn't pay me 1 million dollars to just act that part of the movie I know is nothing but fiction just pretend I oh yes you couldn't pay me 1 million to act that order of the second place I didn't make it you couldn't pay me 1 million dollars to do it it's a terrible moment and a year or two years later again I had a dream hour somewhere and this same brother I peered again yes what straight to me and he stood and he was looking into my face and I was looking at him you could see who was angry and then he turned to go away then I caught his name I say you can't go this way then he stood and he came back and then he said I would never remember I would never forget praise be to God he said until you are ready God is not ready but when you are ready God is ready praise be to God and this is somebody I know it's always praying for me he never told me nobody ever told me but I know it and God showed it to me you may never get to know who they are but somebody is keeping you before the turn of God by day and by night and we also owe it a duty to our loved ones we owe it a duty to also bear somebody up in prayer freely have you received and freely give we also owe it a duty to bear orders one another before the throne of grace of God praise be to God somebody is praying for you whoever they are I don't know wherever they are I don't know but certainly somebody somewhere is praying for you and you ought to be praying for somebody - you ought to be praying for somebody - if you are not doing it there is something wrong somewhere praise be to God when you read acts 12 want to take him we are not going to read that for the sake of time but let's just take one or two verses from day acts 12 one acts 12 one probably we can skip and then get to the sixth get to verse 6 X 12 6 and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and before the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and his smoke Peter on the side and rest him off saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto Him did I self and bind on thy son das and so he did and he said unto Him coz I commend abadi and follow me and as you read on Peter was led out of the prison what happen here Herod the king after he laid his hands on James and killed him and he started the Jews were happy he went ahead and he took Peter put him in prison waiting for the deaths of the unleavened bread to be over and he will bring him before the public but this time this time their brother said no enough is enough and they decided to pray for Peter a prayer was being offered should I take that part I think I jumped too much I jumped that a so what part is that why the believers prayed five praise be to God Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without season of the church unto God for him the believers said no enough is enough and asura pray for Peter because they knew the Herod was going to kill him the same way he killed James and that night he was lying down he did not even care about what was going on because he was asleep he was asleep he didn't care Paul said for me to live is Christ and to die is gain if you had child of God death doesn't mean anything to you it doesn't matter whether you live or you die make sure that you are in the will of God make sure that your life is in accordance with the word make sure that you have this testimony that you please God it doesn't matter whether you live it doesn't matter what he died he was asleep was changed then when the Saint said no we want our Arabic and he prayed the angel came down that night the light shone in the room he's changed further off he was led out of the prison that doors open praise be to God why because somebody was praying for him somebody was praying for him somebody had it on their mind to pray for him and obey Him in prayer follow me as we go along you may not know why I'm doing this but in a minute or two you'll get to know praise be to God last Wednesday when we came for Prius I was excited when burello I began to pray for sis quiche I didn't even know she was admitted to the hospital again and something just struck me from Wednesday up until this morning something hasn't been very right with me and I just kept thinking and then brother Scott came and then he gave a testimony and rather one came over and then he gave us a report about his case and just one thing I saw that the Holy Spirit had made a move and when you see the Spirit of God move and God gives you enough grace identify it all you have to do is just follow go in line praise be to God God is going to do something our God is a prayer answering God we have not believed in vain now I want you to think of it for a moment pain we all know ken was that of Adam Cain was a seed of the serpent but look at Cain after he had killed his brother and then he was afraid somebody would see him and then take his life and he cried out to God what did God do even the Serpent's seed the serpent seed who killed girls own son God had him that bird granted unto him the desire of his heart to live and God said that and a body would slay of say who slay earth King shall be avenged sevenfold Sevenfold and this is the seed of the serpent we are talking about God granted it look at the man of God ara who was possessed by unclean spirits who was living in the tombs and everybody feared him you put him burning with any chain he would break it he was strong nobody could tame him but when Jesus came his way the Bible says when he saw him afar he bowed and he worshiped him praise be to God and the demons cried out what have you to do with us what have you got to do with us have you come to punish us before our day and when Jesus asked who his name was he said we are many that my name is legion because we are many and just listen the demons now speaking telling Jesus not to cast them into the outer country but to cause them in the pigs in the in the in the end in the in the group of pigs to cut them into the pigs and Jesus grunted and these were demos that was is speaking jesus granted it go you have it and they went to enter the pigs and into the sea they went and it all perished even Satan our enemy when he received the angels in heaven to wage war against God because he wanted to pitch his throne about the turn of God and to be worshipped instead of God God and his angels fought against him and cast him down what was sitting looking for worship he wanted to become God he wanted to be wash it in place of God God said no not here but here on earth has he achieved it or not he is the god of this earth if God will listen to demons and greater wishes and what Satan wanted in heaven didn't get if God would allow him to get it here if Cain the seed of the serpent would cry out to God and bird would hear him and then say that anybody who kills Cain shall be Avenged Sevenfold so granting protection how much would God do for his elect praise be to God how much more would God do for his elect for his own sons and daughters our God is a life we have a reign in God a girl that is delighted in his children praise be to God now this is why I am doing this this morning the hospital is not sister Keisha's second
