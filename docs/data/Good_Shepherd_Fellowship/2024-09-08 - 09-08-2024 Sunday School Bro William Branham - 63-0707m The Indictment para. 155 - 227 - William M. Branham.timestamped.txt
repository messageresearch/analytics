[3:40] what are you saying that preacher how
[3:41] are you building your platform here that
[3:43] they crucifying that they are crucifying
[3:45] the effects of the Gospel upon the
[3:48] people by their Creeds amen yes that's a
[3:51] crucifixion that where the public set
[3:54] these big
[3:55] margs called churches denominations and
[3:59] draw line of
[4:01] creed and that had the word of God can't
[4:04] have an effect upon it because they they
[4:07] condemned the very things that Christ
[4:08] said would take place it just don't come
[4:11] according to their Creed and neither did
[4:13] Jesus come according to their
[4:15] understanding of him coming he coming
[4:17] the way that God sent him and he come
[4:19] exactly with the word no wonder he said
[4:22] he hid it from the eyes of the wise and
[4:24] prudent and reveal it the baby such as
[4:26] would learn Hallelujah do you understand
[4:31] oh they have crucify the effects of the
[4:33] word I got a bunch of scriptures here I
[4:35] might just quote to a three of them they
[4:36] crucified you say how do they crucify
[4:38] the word when Jesus said that he's the
[4:42] same yesterday today and forever Hebrews
[4:44] 13:8 they say in such a way he
[4:47] is all right and the Jesus said his last
[4:50] commandment to the church go ye into all
[4:52] the World Mark 16 go ye into all the
[4:54] world and preach the gospel these signs
[4:57] shall follow them that believe all the
[4:59] world to Every Creature it ain't half
[5:02] reached yet and his millions die every
[5:04] year that don't ever even heard the name
[5:06] of Jesus so it's still the general
[5:08] orders it's still the Commandment of God
[5:12] all the world and preach the gospel to
[5:13] Every Creature he that believeth in his
[5:15] baptized shall be saved he that
[5:16] believeth not shall be damned and these
[5:18] signs shall follow them that believe in
[5:21] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[5:23] shall speak with new tongues if they
[5:25] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[5:27] it shall not harm them if they lay their
[5:29] hands on the sick they shall
[5:31] recover and they say that was for that
[5:34] generation and they make the Commandment
[5:36] of God of not effect to this and they
[5:39] crucify the effect of the word to the
[5:43] people
[5:45] amen Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[5:48] with the keys to the kingdom that Jesus
[5:50] had just given him whatever you say here
[5:52] I'll say it up there and on the day of
[5:55] Pentecost they asked what they might do
[5:57] to receive the Holy Spirit if they was
[5:59] so enjoying it watching others acting uh
[6:03] what they would call uh silly stagger
[6:06] and jumping falling and acting like they
[6:08] were
[6:09] drunk and they say these men are full of
[6:11] new
[6:12] wine but there was a man stood up by the
[6:14] name of Peter who had the keys to the
[6:17] kingdom and said these are not drunken
[6:19] acts two as you suppos since the third
[6:22] eye of the day but this is that which is
[6:24] spoken of see right back to the word
[6:27] again showing that the spirit is still
[6:29] word the word is still Spirit yes the
[6:32] word of God and it shall come spoken by
[6:34] the prophet Joel Joel 238 and it shall
[6:37] come to pass in the last days sayith God
[6:39] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[6:42] listen to that Prophet stand there look
[6:45] at him
[6:46] Fearless standing there upon that bunch
[6:49] and condemning
[6:51] them inditing
[6:53] them said this is the scripture this is
[6:57] that that was spoke of by the prophet I
[6:59] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your
[7:01] sons and daughters shall prophesy all my
[7:03] handmaids and Maid servant I pour out of
[7:06] my spirit I'll show signs in the heavens
[7:07] above and on Earth fire and pillars of
[7:09] smoke and
[7:10] Vapor proven it by the word that it was
[7:13] the word and they laughed and made fun
[7:16] of it and they went to judgment and the
[7:18] city was burnt and they eat one
[7:20] another's children and today there are
[7:21] scattered people throughout all the
[7:25] world showing the Holy Spirit Still
[7:28] Remains the word of God God to bring
[7:30] this word to make it live Jesus Christ
[7:32] was the person man
[7:34] God hallelujah
[7:37] amen he was the manifestation of God he
[7:41] was God in a body form to reflect the
[7:44] word of God for that age to make that
[7:48] age see God's promise for that age and
[7:51] the Holy Ghost is the same thing today
[7:53] it's the spirit of God upon the written
[7:55] word trying to find somebody to reflect
[7:57] itself to this age
[8:00] yes to prove that he's the same
[8:02] yesterday ver St John 14:12 The Works
[8:04] that I do shall you also Jesus Christ is
[8:07] the same yesterday and forever see
[8:10] constantly trying to find its way to
[8:11] reflect itself and they could not do it
[8:14] the people thought so much of their
[8:15] denominations their little Nest that
[8:17] they had and so forth call their
[8:18] churches so they wouldn't listen to it
[8:21] so do they do it today same thing
[8:23] crucify aresh Peter on the day of
[8:26] Pentecost he said you man that dwell in
[8:28] Jerusalem
[8:30] in
[8:31] Judea hearken to my words these are not
[8:34] drunk if you'll stand still I'll show
[8:37] you what it is and he goes ahead and
[8:39] explains to them one of their hearts is
[8:41] pricked when they heard this so what can
[8:44] we do to be saved what can we do to
[8:47] receive this we're convinced that your
[8:49] word is right he said repent every one
[8:52] of you and be baptized in the name of
[8:54] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[8:56] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[8:58] the Holy Ghost for this to you and your
[9:00] children they as far off even as many as
[9:02] the Lord Our God shall call this is what
[9:03] they got to do repent be baptized in the
[9:06] name of Jesus Christ and today the Roman
[9:10] Catholic Church adopted father son Holy
[9:12] Ghost to take that place instead of that
[9:14] a communion Li out a tongue and take up
[9:16] wafer and the priest drink the wine and
[9:18] you're one together the communion in the
[9:20] stead of being the Holy Ghost called
[9:22] Holy
[9:23] Eucharist and a father son Holy Ghost a
[9:25] trinitarian baptism was not even spoke
[9:27] of in the Bible amen amen the name of
[9:30] father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus
[9:32] Christ and when you show that to this
[9:34] honor generation as Peter said save
[9:36] yourself from this honor generation when
[9:38] you show it to them what do they do make
[9:41] fun of it and say our church don't teach
[9:43] it that way then you're guilty you're
[9:47] guilty of the crucifixion of Jesus
[9:50] Christ by taking the power of God away
[9:53] from the people you crucify the very
[9:55] word to them and you condemn yourself
[9:57] with your congregation
[10:01] lead him into a death
[10:03] trap as I said about that Minister last
[10:06] Sunday there Martin Luther King down
[10:08] there with them precious people leading
[10:10] right into a death trap oh somebody
[10:13] could only talk to that man wish I
[10:15] could just for an little uprising of a
[10:18] school proposition see what difference
[10:21] my goodness if the people ain't got hard
[10:23] enough to associate with a man because
[10:24] of his color they're condemned and dead
[10:27] anyhow Amen brother the nation gives
[10:29] right don't fight against it don't what
[10:31] if somebody said all the Irish or
[10:32] somebody all the German or somebody else
[10:34] had to dissociate that would never
[10:36] bother Christians that move right on and
[10:38] that man's a Christian is is a minister
[10:40] he shouldn't lead them people into a
[10:42] revolt against that they're going to
[10:43] cause Millions to die it'll start
[10:45] another revolutionary and it's a shame
[10:47] to do that the same thing happens right
[10:49] here exactly the same thing again that's
[10:52] right see the people how that they'd
[10:55] only look at truth and see what truth is
[10:58] our church don't believe that
[10:59] we got some other way well it ain't the
[11:01] right way it ain't the thing he said
[11:03] repent and be baptized in the name of
[11:05] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[11:08] now they won't do it oh then what do
[11:11] they do now that's just one thing upon
[11:13] hundreds we'll get to maybe as fast as
[11:16] we can now the second crucifixion then
[11:21] if a man accepts Father Son and Holy
[11:23] Spirit a a Creed instead of the
[11:27] word titles instead of the the name what
[11:30] does he do to the people he crucifies
[11:34] the effects of the word to the people
[11:37] when he says that Mark 16 was just for
[11:39] that generation and God said himself
[11:41] right there Jesus talking to him said go
[11:43] ye into all the world and preach the
[11:45] gospel to Every
[11:47] Creature he that believeth in is
[11:49] baptized shall be saved he that
[11:50] believeth not shall be damned and these
[11:53] sign shall follow
[11:55] them how for every nation every Creed
[11:58] every tongue every race every people the
[12:01] same
[12:02] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[12:06] that
[12:07] believe and when a man tries to cut that
[12:10] out of the Bible he crucifies the
[12:11] effects of the Gospel to that
[12:13] congregation amen hallelujah so I indict
[12:17] you in the name of Jesus Christ you're
[12:19] guilty of murdering the
[12:22] Lord
[12:25] hallelujah the church hated him why he
[12:29] was their very God they hated him and
[12:32] denied
[12:34] him to be their Messiah no sir they
[12:39] didn't want such a messiah as that and
[12:41] today the church does the same thing it
[12:45] denies a word they don't want it it's
[12:47] contradictory to what they've been
[12:49] taught to believe by their Creeds amen
[12:51] and the word is a
[12:54] messiah you believe that well the
[12:57] reflection of the word then is what
[12:59] amen a reflecting the
[13:02] Messiah which is the Holy Ghost Among Us
[13:06] he's reflecting himself try to worry if
[13:08] he can find a lamp that he can look
[13:09] through it Ain smoked up with Creeds and
[13:12] things he can give light
[13:15] through remember they Rose and trim
[13:17] their lamps and washed out the chimneys
[13:19] but it's too late so when a man sees
[13:21] these Lutheran Presbyterian methodists
[13:23] trying to come in these last days to
[13:24] receive the Holy Ghost why you know they
[13:26] don't get it that's right oh they might
[13:29] speak in tongues and jump up and down
[13:30] but Watch What Happens they absolutely
[13:33] it's a Time sign that she's
[13:36] over we're at the end most any time the
[13:39] the church could hear the challenge to
[13:41] come on high amen
[13:44] amen just exactly setting us in order
[13:47] the Holy Spirit here making Jesus Christ
[13:49] a reality through the ones that he can
[13:51] work through proving himself come down
[13:53] takes his picture shows it makes Science
[13:55] Tech talk about it everything else
[13:56] proving just exactly what he said he
[13:57] would do doing it exactly the things he
[14:00] said he would do scripturally not not
[14:02] some Creed or some man's worked up idea
[14:04] a lot of blood fire and smoke and stuff
[14:06] but a scriptural Messiah
[14:09] evidence got a lot of impersonations and
[14:11] impersonators and and so forth but that
[14:13] only makes a real word shine its best
[14:16] right that's people who are spiritual
[14:18] who can judge between right and wrong
[14:20] Lord see denies him denied their Messiah
[14:24] we didn't want him the same thing they
[14:26] do today well if I had to go down there
[14:27] and act like that bunch I don't want it
[14:29] at all all right then you don't have it
[14:32] at all that's
[14:33] all same now although he was properly
[14:38] identified they didn't want him they
[14:40] hated him why was it we call their
[14:43] pastors a bunch of snakes he said you
[14:46] bunch of whiteed walls you're nothing
[14:48] but a graveyard the outside of his is
[14:50] polished with robes and turned around
[14:51] collars and the inside's dead man's
[14:55] boom he didn't pull no punches one
[14:58] little bitty galileon
[14:59] a carpenter son but he didn't pull no
[15:02] punches he told him don't think John
[15:05] said the Forerunner of said he's another
[15:07] didn't pull any punches he said don't
[15:09] come around here saying now you got
[15:10] Abraham to our father God's able to
[15:13] these stones to rise children Abraham
[15:15] yes sir the ax is laid to the root of
[15:17] the tree and every tree that don't bring
[15:18] forth fruits HED down and cast Into the
[15:20] Fire yes sir God is strict and firm and
[15:23] Stern with his word yes sir notice Jesus
[15:28] proved by the scripture do you hear me
[15:32] am Jesus was
[15:36] identified by God through the scriptures
[15:39] that he was
[15:42] Messiah is that right amen we get to
[15:47] Peter's indictment a few minutes you'll
[15:48] find out where it was not he was
[15:51] thoroughly
[15:52] identified that he was God manifested in
[15:56] a man called the son of God that's
[15:59] right although he was properly
[16:02] identified and Vindicated the promised
[16:05] word that he was
[16:07] Messiah Moses said this Messiah when he
[16:10] comes he'll be a prophet and all these
[16:13] things will take place the little woman
[16:15] with the stand at the well and all that
[16:18] dirty condition that she was what that
[16:20] symbolize that God in these last days
[16:22] would pull out
[16:24] Outcast remember last night at the
[16:26] wedding or the other time I preached
[16:27] here at the wedding supper he s
[16:29] how they said I've made a great feast
[16:31] and so forth and all these men I bit
[16:33] them and each one had an excuse I can't
[16:35] do it because it would ruin our
[16:37] Creeds I can't come because I have a uh
[16:40] uh my married a wife she won't let me
[16:42] come my I I got married to a church down
[16:45] here my mother was Methodist or Baptist
[16:47] or Catholic or I just can't stand for
[16:50] that he said and you won't come and you
[16:53] won't taste my supper but get out there
[16:55] and compel prostitutes and harlots and
[16:58] drunkards and whatever there is bring
[17:01] them in I'll straighten them up hallah I
[17:05] made my supper and my guest my table
[17:07] setting it's going to be somebody
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:11] there they didn't come it's condemning
[17:14] them Jews what about today Hallelujah I

[17:19] Lutheran I'm a Oneness I'm a Tess I'm a
[17:22] this I can't I can't there you are you
[17:24] won't be there
[17:26] then amen that's exactly what he said
[17:29] said all right properly a Vindicated
[17:33] Messiah properly a Vindicated the word
[17:37] the promised word the god that promised
[17:40] the word that this what the Messiah
[17:41] would be here he come and stood exactly
[17:43] and he said to him now where have I
[17:46] failed if you can't believe me as a man
[17:50] believe the works that I
[17:51] do for they are the things that tell who
[17:54] I
[17:55] am amen they're the ones that says I'm
[17:58] Messiah
[17:59] you don't want to believe me because you
[18:01] think of Joseph over there and I was
[18:03] born over there and that little Hut and
[18:05] and my uh Foster father here is a a
[18:07] carpenter down there and and you when to

[18:28] Fellowship ship card he don't have any
[18:30] credentials where did a guy like it
[18:31] where'd you get this it anyhow and the
[18:33] Bible said he was a is
[18:36] offended he said many mighty Works he
[18:38] could not do and just turned his back
[18:39] and walked away from him said a
[18:42] prophet's not without honor except among
[18:43] his own
[18:45] people in his own County watch or in his
[18:48] own
[18:49] country there he is properly Vindicated
[18:52] the Messiah took no credit of his own he
[18:54] said I can do nothing but what I see the
[18:56] father doing and he challenge them to
[19:00] ask that that was the Messiah and look
[19:02] at that little old ill Fame woman she
[19:03] recognized it she she wasn't doated the
[19:07] lamp on she was morally wrong of course
[19:10] no one would endorse that the laws of
[19:12] God condemn that she was morally wrong
[19:14] but you see God don't judge you uh upon
[19:18] your what you are he enjoy he judges not
[19:21] how big you are how little you are he
[19:22] judges your heart what you want to be
[19:26] and she didn't want none that stuff when
[19:27] just flash before that's that's what she
[19:29] wanted Hallelujah no matter what she was
[19:31] then she's ready to come
[19:34] amen God judges the heart man judges the
[19:37] outward appearance God looks upon the
[19:40] heart no matter what she was that light
[19:42] flash that settled it she caught the the
[19:46] the the essence of eternal life oh my
[19:50] how rich this is to me to see I know
[19:53] that it's the truth I'll I'll stand by
[19:55] this I let the god of heaven will raise
[19:57] up in my voice will be on the Magnetic
[19:59] Tape of God's great time Y and it'll
[20:02] condemn this generation in the last day
[20:05] because it's on magnetic tape then to be
[20:07] on the Eternal tape then try condemn
[20:11] this generation of preachers who has a
[20:13] form of godliness and denying the power
[20:15] of the word and manifestation when it's
[20:18] properly identified that he still Jesus
[20:20] Christ the same yesterday today and
[20:23] forever I indict them by the word of God
[20:26] I have to get to another promise quickly
[20:27] cuz you only got about 15
[20:29] minutes there
[20:32] they there
[20:37] they what
[20:40] oh Calvary They Crucified thirdly They
[20:44] Crucified him not by recognizing God's
[20:50] promised word made manifest and why did
[20:53] they crucify that man could you just
[20:55] imagine let me go back a minute why
[20:57] would them people
[21:00] crucify a man like
[21:02] that as Mary as I read a book one time
[21:06] called a prince the House of David is
[21:08] wrote by Ingram Dr Ingram wonderful
[21:10] booket of drama supposed to be partly
[21:12] true of some old manuscript was taken
[21:14] off of a woman named Medina and her she
[21:17] went over to Palestine from from down in
[21:20] Egypt to Cairo I believe it was to
[21:22] finish her education she was there
[21:23] during a time of of Christ and she's
[21:26] sped right back to her father it'd be
[21:27] good if you picked it up read it it's
[21:29] really good uh Prince the House of David
[21:31] the same man wrote Pillar of Fire and
[21:33] out of that a cecal de Mill stuck The
[21:35] Ten Commandments now we find it in this
[21:39] book this Adena wrote back and she said
[21:42] on the day of the crucifixion that Mary
[21:44] magalina Bon Hood he cast out Seven
[21:46] Devils run out before the crowd and said
[21:48] what has he
[21:49] done what has he
[21:51] done only heal the sick and try to
[21:54] deliver those that were in prisons what
[21:57] has he done but good some somebody said
[21:59] and a man slapped her Plum across a yard
[22:01] almost and said would you bleed that
[22:02] silly woman before your
[22:05] priest there you are see what had he
[22:09] done done nothing why they
[22:11] crucifying why why because they didn't
[22:15] recognize who he
[22:17] was that's the same thing today the
[22:21] preachers and people of this days and
[22:22] our modern teachers has so
[22:28] or the devil or a mental telepathy or
[22:31] some
[22:32] hoax or some kind of a
[22:34] trick until the people don't recognize
[22:38] that it's a Vindication of God's word
[22:40] for this day it's the last day signs the
[22:44] churches if you don't belong to their
[22:45] organization they'll say oh well that's
[22:47] some makeup that's that's hoax we look
[22:49] down here so and so and so and so but
[22:50] let them one time prove the real thing
[22:52] to be a
[22:55] hoax let them one time prove that it's
[22:58] wrong they can't do it right it's never
[23:00] been known to be wrong and it never will
[23:03] be because it's
[23:05] God but they like the point they think
[23:07] oh well if it was some a man with a
[23:09] great name because it's a little group a
[23:11] little Bunch it's kind of outcast well
[23:13] we turn that person out of our church he
[23:16] they they used to come to our group see
[23:18] but they went over with this and they
[23:19] went over that and now they see they
[23:20] wind up well look what it is who it is I
[23:22] don't care they could said the same
[23:23] thing about Peter James and John or
[23:24] ignorant and unlearned man they said but
[23:26] they had to take notice something that
[23:28] happen happen since that time they had
[23:30] been with Jesus that's what made the
[23:33] difference they did it because they
[23:35] didn't know who he was they didn't know
[23:37] that the Vindication of God's word
[23:39] wasn't standing up there in that day now
[23:41] it wasn't one day that was right it
[23:44] wasn't one day just keep them laws and
[23:46] things but the same laws that was they
[23:48] was to keeping pointed them to a time
[23:51] that when he would come and be this man
[23:53] that he was supposed to be they had this
[23:55] part but didn't take the other part and
[23:57] that's the same thing they're doing now
[23:59] they got a church and they believe in
[24:00] Jesus Christ and say they're doing
[24:02] things but deny the hour we're living in
[24:05] still brings the old proverb back again
[24:07] man always praising God for what he has
[24:10] done looking forward for what he would
[24:11] do and or will do and ignoring what he's
[24:14] doing and being condemned by yes
[24:16] amen they think God's wonderful how
[24:19] great he is what he's going to do he's
[24:20] going to come and be a Rapture someday
[24:22] go home and denying the very signs and
[24:24] wonders right here at the time that the
[24:25] scripture says that he'll be doing it
[24:27] Miss the whole thing if the blind lead
[24:29] the blind Jesus said they'll all fall in
[24:30] a
[24:31] ditch just pray God to open our eyes in
[24:34] this last days all right now the same
[24:38] they do the same today they deny and
[24:41] crucify the same God today but not
[24:45] knowing him the same by denying him and
[24:49] doing by denying the things that they're
[24:51] doing today they don't crucify Christ
[24:54] again exactly but they blaspheme the
[24:57] Holy Ghost and by doing it they are how
[25:00] do they blaspheme the Holy Ghost how how
[25:03] did they blaspheme it that back there
[25:05] why they couldn't blaspheme it then
[25:06] hadn't come
[25:07] yet they called Jesus be
[25:10] elub called him be elub because he could
[25:13] know the secrets of their hearts and
[25:15] things he said this is a devil in other
[25:17] words he's a fortune teller that's how
[25:19] he does this it's by fortune telling
[25:22] he's nothing but a devil see they had
[25:23] had a prophet in 400 years and they done
[25:25] grow it out of it see they just had
[25:27] their laws they said this is a be above
[25:30] and Jesus said I'll forgive you for
[25:32] that but when the Holy Ghost has
[25:35] come now you speak a word against it and
[25:40] it'll never be forgiven you remember it
[25:44] will and cannot by no means no mercy
[25:48] when you blaspheme and call the spirit
[25:50] of God the word of God that's being
[25:53] Vindicated by the spirit see the word
[25:55] says so the spirit's are vindicating it
[25:58] and you call it an unclean thing you've
[26:00] crossed the line between mercy and
[26:02] judgment and can never be forgiven for
[26:04] it that's the reason I D this
[26:08] generation of guilty of crucifying
[26:11] blaspheming the manifested Son of God
[26:14] amen hallelujah amen as is Promised for
[26:17] all the prophets and Christ himself to
[26:19] be in the last days like it was in the
[26:20] days of Noah and the days of
[26:23] Sodom
[26:25] blasphemy which they crucify to the
[26:27] people the Son of God of Flesh he is a
[26:30] Vindicated word one word against it can
[26:33] never be
[26:34] forgiven now what are you going to do
[26:37] then why are you going to stand there
[26:40] condemned just waiting the hour of God's
[26:43] Wrath to be pour
[26:45] out you'll Crum on loving doctrine of
[26:49] man-made denominations and dogmas better
[26:51] than they do their Vindicated word of
[26:54] God this generation of people oh
[26:59] I I just wish I had a long time for
[27:03] this this generation of people this
[27:07] generation sperms God's
[27:10] revelation
[27:13] amen but we're walking where the
[27:15] apostles have
[27:17] tried God you say well others say that
[27:20] too God vindicates it am Jesus said if
[27:24] if if the works don't speak of me then
[27:26] just go ahead and say I'm saying it
[27:27] myself but the works speak you better
[27:29] believe the
[27:30] works because it's the hour said you
[27:32] know tomorrow the sun's going to shine
[27:35] or it's going to be foul weather but the
[27:36] skies red and L tomorrow be fair said
[27:39] you can discern the face of the Skies
[27:41] but the signs of the time you know
[27:42] nothing about if you would have known
[27:45] God You' have known my day and they said
[27:47] you take so much upon yourself you make
[27:49] yourself God and put him on the cross
[27:51] and the Holy Ghost today is not no third
[27:53] person it's God himself manifested in
[27:56] human flesh by the blood of Jesus Christ
[27:58] to sanctify a life that he might reflect
[28:00] himself through and they crucify that
[28:02] same word made
[28:04] manifest you understand amen the
[28:08] crucifixion of Christ today is the
[28:10] people who will deny the Vindicated and
[28:13] manifested Son of God Among The People
[28:15] by his things that he said would take
[28:17] place in this day by his
[28:19] word now the same Vindication would have
[28:23] to be the same if he's the same Son of
[28:25] God because he said in St John 14:12 now
[28:27] that The Works that I do shall you do
[28:30] also Hebrews 13:8 is same yesterday and
[28:33] forever if ye abide me John 15 if you
[28:36] abide me and my words abide in you just
[28:39] ask what you will it'll be given to you
[28:43] yes sir
