========================================

Jehovah was going to represent himself from heaven. He was represented in the most meekst humblest of all the fowls that fly in heaven. That is the dove. There's no channeler bird than the dove. I made quite a study on bird life and on wildlife. And the dove is a very odd bird from any other bird that flies to heaven. The dove is a a a lover. A dove is gentle. And a dove has no gall. It's the only in the bird family that doesn't have a gall. That's the reason you never see a dove anywhere. But around where there's grain and seed. Now the in the ark there was a dove. And the dove is represented in many places in the Bible as symbols of the Holy Spirit. And also the lamb is represented in many places of the Bible as Christ in the revelation all the way back to Genesis. And so is the dove. In the book of Genesis, the dove was in the ark sitting on the roost with the with the rest of the fowls of the air. And one of them was a raven, a crow. And a crow is one of the meanest birds there is. A crow and a J-bird, I guess, is about the meanest birds that we can find. The crow is a very long life bird. And he lives, they are claimed for sometimes two or 30 hund years that a crow, a parrot lives longer than that. But a dove is one animal or one bird that doesn't have a gall. Now the crow could sit over here and eat on a dead carcass. You'll never see the dove around that dead carcass. She can't stand it. The stench of it in her nose, she couldn't stand it. It would make her sick. They just simply can't stand anything that's deteriorating, rotten. They can't stand it. So, she couldn't eat it. If she would eat it, it would immediately kill the Because what digested the food is the overflow of the gall into the stomach, which digests the food. And if there's no gall to go in there to make up this, then it would kill the dove. So, you'll always find the dove around where there's something clean, something that's wholesome. Now the crow is different. Now just notice the crow being a type of the hypocrite. The crow can settle there on the on the dead carcass and eat just as much as he wants to and fly right out in the field and eat wheat, too. But the dove can't eat wheat and then fly over on the dead carcass. So a hypocrite, a man can be a hypocrite and both eat spiritual things and good things and bad things. But a real born again Christian cannot tolerate the things that's wrong and only can eat from the good things. Notice that when you see a fellow that can go to the dance, go out and drink, go out and live in sin, come back to the church, and maybe shout just as much as a saint. What it is, he's a scavenger. He can eat both rotten things and good things. But the real Christian cannot tolerate those things anymore. For he's passed from death to life. And immediately would condemn him so the very thoughts of it till it would condemn him that he'd turn his face and walk away. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a picture. Now the lamb is a very gentle little fella. He doesn't He can't help himself. He isn't self-reliance because he can't help himself. Here's some time ago, I was going through a pastor when I used to patrol and I found a little lamb and all of them had got away from him somehow and is all wound up in a little bunch of bobwire. And a poor little fellow was laying there bleeding and bleeding. And I come by and I see way up about a half a mile up was a whole herd of sheep. Now he laid right there and the crows would have been picking in his eyes pretty soon if we had to got him out. But I unwound the little fell, picked him up in my arms. He never refused. He laid real quiet. I picked him up in my arms. First first time perhaps a human being had ever had their hands on him. But he was gentle. He was willing to be led. &gt;&gt; He was willing to be helped. I hope you see it. He was willing not to try to resist or to kick back or to bite. Lambs don't kick back. They don't bite. They just humble themselves. And this little fella, I packed him up and set him down and the rest of the sheep. And a few minutes his mammy found him. How happy he was. Now, how typical that is of the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know where they go to kill sheep. You know what leads the sheep up to the killing block is a goat. But the goat will lead the sheep right up the chute at the slaughter house and then just time he gets a sheep coming up the chute then he'll jump out. But all they say when they're going to kill the goat then he kicks up a stomach. See? &gt;&gt; And that's the way the devil will do. He'll try to lead God's children right into the meanness, but when it comes time for him to die, he really kicks up a storm. Man, &gt;&gt; that's the way the devil does it. And that's the way sometimes some little fancy looking girl or some little snickler Fritz boy with a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of whiskey would lead a little girl off a lamb of somebody's foe &gt;&gt; off to the wrong. Oh, it's all right. There's nothing all that goody goody stuff about church. But let strike that old boy one time. You heard him squealing and hollering all over the country. And that's the way the devil does it. But a lamb is so gentle that it can be led. And that's the reason that God represented Christ as the lamb and himself as the dove. And on the day that John baptized Jesus, &gt;&gt; at the River of Jordan, one of the greatest events that had ever taken place, taken place right there. &gt;&gt; Notice &gt;&gt; how beautiful &gt;&gt; the lamb, the meakest of all the creatures of the earth, and the dove, &gt;&gt; the meakest of all the f of heaven. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the only way that they could ever be united. It's the only way that the dove would ever come on the lamb. Now, when the dove came down, John saw Jesus and he said, "Behold the lamb of God that take away the sins of the world." And John said, "I bear record." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seeing the spirit of God like a dove, &gt;&gt; coming down and abiding, &gt;&gt; on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; The dove and the lamb united together. &gt;&gt; That's when God and man became one. That's when heaven and earth embraced each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's when God was made flesh. &gt;&gt; That's when God came down &gt;&gt; from the spirit form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And was made a man &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; That's when all the eternities embraced each other. That's when the human fallen race of Adam's people and Jehovah God and every angel &gt;&gt; come together &gt;&gt; when God and man was made one on that great memorial day when John baptized Jesus. Now what if they would have been a wolf? The sweet couping of the dove would have never been able to stand by the wolf. What is any prettier than late of the evening to hear the old turtle dove sat out there and cool a wild? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After I lost my wife and baby, I wouldn't let no one know what I was doing. I used to get my old car. I drive out across the road here, go out here at Walnut Ridge Graveyard, set up there by the side of the tree, and look down at the grave. I just couldn't give them up. Looked like I couldn't stand it anymore. I like my little baby laying there eight months old. How she used to hold her little hands and would reach for me and I'd blow the horn or say something to her and she'd goooo reach her little hands out. I'd sit down on the side of the tree, especially when it would become evening and there used to be an old dove that would sit out there in the bush. &gt;&gt; She would go to C. Oh my, I once wondered if there was an immortal soul of my baby coming back to try to speak to me. &gt;&gt; Nothing sweeter than that kooing of the dove. How she's loving. She brings tidings. How she tries to make peace. Get up early in the morning. Go out in the thicket area close to where I live. What a peaceful thing it is to listen. Setting up on their great tall trees, those doves cooing to one another. The other day down at brother Cox's, an old mother dove had two little babies and they sat right up on top of the building so the cats couldn't get them. And the old mother dove would feed them. Then she'd come down and get them and make them get up in the tree. They would sit there with their necks around one another and coup and make love all day long. Two little gentle baby dove. And I thought of how God the dove is such a loving bird. And the dove God wanting to make love with his human beings. God wants to be loved. God wants to love you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world, &gt;&gt; he gave his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That whosoever believeth in him should not perish &gt;&gt; but to have everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then God wanting to make love, he had to some make something lovable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to make something gentle like himself. He had to make something that could be love. He had to make something of his own nature. You couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature. &gt;&gt; Loving has to unite with love. A husband and wife have to love one another if they ever make the grade. Family has to love one another if they ever make the grade. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something to be loved. You search everywhere finding a girl to be your wife that you love. She searches finding a husband that she can love. God searches trying to find a soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he can love. So he represented himself here on earth as a gentle dove and a gentle lamb. If at that lamb would at one minute ever taken on the nature of the snarling wolf, that dove would have tuck her flight immediately. She'd have got away. But the the the lamb, it doesn't have any great minds of its own. A lamb is one thing. When it's lost, it's hopelessly lost. A sheep can't find its way back. That's the reason the goat leads it to its death. It can't find its way. A sheep it's lost. That's the reason God likened us unto sheep. When we're lost, we are lost. There's no way we can find ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one way to do it. That's submit ourselves to the shepherd of the flock. And he does the leading. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now as I notice this lamb and the sheep together, the lamb and the dove rather together they made one. Then watch how the dove led the lamb, the son of God. How gentle he was knowing that he was going to the slaughter. How gentle he was to always not to try to do himself, not to try to be self-sufficient. He said, "I do nothing until the father shows me first and the father dwells in me." Now another thing the lamb is the lamb is willing to submit its rights. Now God wants us to be lambs. But there's so many times that we don't want to submit our rights. &gt;&gt; Farford our rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many of you say, "Well, I've got rights, brother Brandon." That's true. But are you willing to forfeit your rights? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to give your rights that God could lead you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with our churches today in a great majority that the gentleness of the lamb of God are we are supposed to be lambs. We have become everything else but lambs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude, the dove of the Holy Spirit takes her flight and leaves. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the lamb of God would have made the first snore like a wolf or would have done anything contrary to what the general dove would have permitted, the dove would have tucker fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Should have left in a minute. And that's the reason today that we're wondering what's the matter with the Pentecostal church. &gt;&gt; It's because we have taken on a different nature. We've taken on a nature that we want our rights. We're going to do what we know it's right to do and we become arrogant. We become hostile. We become indifferent. We let temper come in. We let selfishness come in. A lamb when it comes time, he owns his own wool. That's his rights. He owns his wool. But they take the lamb and throw him up on the blocks and tie his seat down. He never kicks. He never fusses. You just take his right away from him because he's a lamb. He can't do nothing else because that's his nature. But one time cross a Christian's path, &gt;&gt; you'll find out whether he's a lamb or a goat, &gt;&gt; you'll find out what he is. &gt;&gt; Cross him up one time. And that's the reason today that our churches is in the condition they are. We've called ourselves a lamb of God. The women and the man together has began to act everything but like lambs of God. You look at them going down the street with short bobbed hair, curly cues all in their hair and a few years ago you call you that you couldn't have hired him to do that. And then you wonder why is it the church is in the condition it is is because you tuck the nature of a wolf or a goat instead of keeping the meek gentlest. And you say that's my privilege, brother Brandham. I know it's your privilege. Barbers cut hair and as long as a barber cut hair ain't I got right. That's right. That's your American privilege. But are you willing to give it up to be around? &gt;&gt; Are you willing to submit yourself? &gt;&gt; And you women not long ago you go down the streets. It's ridiculous to look the way the women dress today. And I'm not talking about Presbyterian and Methodist. I'm talking about you holiness women. go down the street and it's I had a little cross hanging in front of my car and somebody said to me said, "Billy, you know that's a Catholic emblem." I said, "When did the Catholics get the option on the cross?" &gt;&gt; Never. That's not emblem of Catholic faith. That's imland of Christian faith. A Catholic faith is a little dead saint, a marrier or some dead person that they worship. We don't worship dead people. We don't worship St. Sicilian, all those different saints. That's Catholicism, which is a high form of spiritualism. But the cross represents him who died and rose again. &gt;&gt; And I said, I keep that there. Looking on the streets 25 years ago or 30 when I was almost blind. I promised God if he'd heal my eyes, I'd look at the right thing. And I said, "Do they ever you look at some ungodly women, halfdressed and naked women laying in the yards there were I look at the cross instead of looking and remember what Christ did for me and turn my head to the thing." I tell the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that are people don't say that's Presbyterian Catholic. That's Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "I got a right to brother Random." That's right. But if he was a lamb, you'd forfeit your rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you go to acting like that. The Holy Spirit, the gentle dove, takes her flight right away. She won't be disgraced with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You never think you're going to act like that and keep the Holy Ghost. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. You've got to Well, say the rest of the women are doing and you man, you poor little boldest sissified things you that would let your wife do such a thing as that. That shows what you're made out of. That's the reason you ain't got the Holy Ghost like you profess to have or you'd have enough something about you to make her act like a lady as long as she live with you anyhow. &gt;&gt; Amen. That sounds oldfashioned cutting, but that's what the church needs today is an oldfashioned Holy Ghost washing out and hanging out and crying out and aring out by the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; What a condition the world's got into. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
