[45:38] name we pray amen
[45:40] the Lord bless you you may have your
[45:42] seat
[45:44] we started we closed on the efficient
[45:49] strolling through efficient and as we as
[45:53] we said let's let's take out uh
[45:57] let's take a coat here
[45:59] that would be uh
[46:02] the one and only that we will read for
[46:03] the night
[46:04] and we make reference to few others
[46:07] brother Branham in adoption
[46:10] he says this he says
[46:13] and we can never rightly be able to have
[46:17] faith
[46:18] until positionally we know
[46:22] what we are
[46:25] praise the Lord another place he also
[46:28] says until we know what we are doing
[46:32] amen
[46:34] so we can never rightly be able to have
[46:37] faith now now what what will be their
[46:40] faith it will be your uh uh
[46:45] the fate of a manifestation of a Son of
[46:48] God Amen
[46:50] for us to be able to rightly have faith
[46:53] the prophecies we we have to be
[46:56] positionally we have to know what we are
[47:00] knowing what we are who we are and also
[47:04] what we are doing
[47:06] amen now he goes down he talks this he
[47:09] says and then if God has sent us
[47:13] to be his ambassadors
[47:16] praise the Lord
[47:18] all the powers that's in heaven all that
[47:23] God is
[47:24] all of his angels and all of his power
[47:30] stand behind our word if we are
[47:34] correctly and ordained not claiming
[47:39] praise the Lord now that we are claiming
[47:43] now for us to be uh uh rightly ordained
[47:47] we have to know that we are rightly
[47:49] ordained we have to know that God had
[47:53] predestinated us to be in this age that
[47:56] it is not by chance that we are here
[48:00] now you see so that's what he he made
[48:02] the statement that he made that we read
[48:04] first we can never rightly be able to
[48:07] have faith until positionally we know
[48:11] what we are
[48:13] we have to know that we are ordained for
[48:15] this hour this day that we are in
[48:18] praise the Lord amen we are going to be
[48:22] here tonight on this prayer meeting
[48:25] he says if God has sent us to be his
[48:29] ambassadors
[48:31] do we believe that he has sent us can we
[48:33] say Amen praise the Lord can we identify
[48:36] with that then he says then we must
[48:38] believe that all power that in heaven
[48:40] all that God is and and all of his
[48:44] angels and all of
[48:47] uh his power stand behind our word I
[48:51] mean every word that we have prayed
[48:54] tonight everything that we have asked
[48:55] the Lord we we have to believe that
[48:59] knowing I mean uh who we are what we are
[49:03] and and what we are doing what we are
[49:06] here for
[49:07] it stands behind uh our words if we are
[49:11] correctly ordained
[49:13] and ordain send messenger to the people
[49:16] God has to honor his word
[49:19] for he has so suddenly written there
[49:24] whatsoever you burn on Earth
[49:27] that will abound in heaven
[49:31] praise the Lord
[49:32] and we we have to realize that word
[49:35] bound means establish
[49:39] praise the Lord
[49:40] and uh the church word in most places
[49:44] have limited that word to bounding Satan
[49:47] and bounding devil and other things but
[49:50] it also means that whatsoever we
[49:53] establish whatsoever we agree
[49:56] if we agreed as a church
[50:00] to keep seen out of our mess we can do
[50:03] it
[50:05] praise the Lord if we agreed as a church
[50:08] to have a healthy church we can do it
[50:13] and that's what we'll be we'll be
[50:15] dealing with a little bit here in in
[50:17] Ephesians chapter six whatsoever we
[50:20] bound on the earth that will abound in
[50:23] heaven whatsoever you lose on Earth that
[50:27] will uh loose in heaven amen we can lose
[50:31] the liberty of the spirit amen we can
[50:33] lose gifts among ourselves
[50:36] we don't have to limit ourselves we can
[50:38] lose for the Holy Spirit to have the
[50:40] Liberty whenever we come here I mean we
[50:44] can see his presence and and it all
[50:47] depends on us
[50:49] is whatever we Bond whatever we
[50:52] establish as a church whatever we also
[50:56] lose as a church
[50:58] we do we're dead on that a little bit
[51:00] when we were talking about bounding
[51:01] powers
[51:03] in heaven
[51:05] and I gave unto you the Keys of the
[51:09] Kingdom
[51:11] oh such great promises he's given to the
[51:16] church can we say Amen can we identify
[51:19] with that that's our promise such great
[51:22] promise he gave to the church so a
[51:24] little bit of a review we were talking
[51:26] on the Sunday uh traveling through the
[51:29] book of Ephesians now uh we talk about
[51:33] uh Ephesians chapter one how God has has
[51:38] uh you know Paul
[51:40] uh letting us know that uh
[51:44] he has blessed us with all spiritual
[51:46] blessing in Heavenly places I call him
[51:49] as he have chosen Us in him before the
[51:52] foundation of the word that we should be
[51:55] holy
[51:57] Without Blame before him in love having
[52:01] predestinated us that chapter 1 verse 5
[52:03] having predestinated us unto the
[52:06] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[52:08] himself I call into the good pleasure of
[52:11] his will so those are things that God
[52:14] did before even there was a word before
[52:17] even there was a devil so the devil can
[52:20] stop this
[52:21] praise the Lord God predestinated he he
[52:25] choose you in him amen that you can be
[52:29] that that you should be holy and without
[52:31] blame that you should walk in the love
[52:34] of God he did all of this before even
[52:37] there was a thought of a devil
[52:40] praise the Lord so the devil cannot stop
[52:43] this
[52:44] amen now so we realize that this this is
[52:48] what God did he you know he he
[52:50] predestinated us onto the adoption of
[52:53] children by Jesus Christ I call him to
[52:55] he that the good pleasure of his will
[52:59] the good pleasure that was God pleasure
[53:02] it pleased the father
[53:03] to to place Us in the age then we went
[53:06] over to chapter two now Paul is bringing
[53:10] us uh uh into our first birth he
[53:14] bringing us into uh we all being born in
[53:17] sin and cheaply iniquity verse 1 chapter
[53:20] 2 and you have he quickly who were dead
[53:23] in trespass and sin
[53:27] we're in
[53:29] time pass you walk I calling to the
[53:32] cause of this word I call into the
[53:36] prince of the power
[53:39] of the air the spirit that now working
[53:42] in the children of Disobedience we know
[53:45] the prince of the power of the earth is
[53:48] the devil amen so Paul here is saying on
[53:51] our first birth we were under the
[53:54] influence of the devil The Same Spirit
[53:56] that is now working in the children of
[53:58] this obedience was once working in US
[54:01] but God has quickened us
[54:04] meaning that he has left us above that
[54:08] praise the Lord so there is an
[54:10] expectation when a quickening power
[54:12] comes he expects us to rise above our
[54:15] weaknesses now so he he he he he he
[54:18] shows us the nature of our first birth
[54:22] and then he gets down to verse eight he
[54:25] says uh for by Grace I ye is safe true
[54:28] faith and and that's not of yourself it
[54:33] is the gift of God not of work leads any
[54:36] man she bought so he now make us to know
[54:39] that Grace has saved us now Grace has
[54:42] saved us chapter three he's going to
[54:45] make us to realize that this grace that
[54:47] has that have come unto us
[54:51] praise the Lord
[54:53] has placed Us in the family of God
[54:58] amen
[55:08] trying to find a good place to read here
[55:10] let's let's look down here
[55:13] in uh
[55:18] and then you can go ahead and it's just
[55:21] how to pick one verse because all the
[55:23] verses are good
[55:24] now verse 11 I call him according to the
[55:28] internal purpose
[55:30] which he purposed in Christ Jesus our
[55:33] lord
[55:34] in whom we have boldness and Ashes with
[55:38] confidence by the faith of him
[55:43] wherefore
[55:46] wherefore I desire that year faint net
[55:52] at my tribulation for you which is your
[55:57] glory
[55:58] for this course I bow my knees unto the
[56:02] father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[56:04] of whom the whole family
[56:08] in Heaven and Earth is name I mean
[56:12] that's the reason why uh you know the
[56:15] scripture make us to know there is no
[56:17] other name giving on the heaven whereby
[56:19] we can be said because this is the
[56:21] family name the scripture identify it
[56:23] that's the reason why our baptism is in
[56:26] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[56:28] see how Paul lay it out it is very
[56:31] important for this cause I buy my knees
[56:34] to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[56:38] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[56:42] Earth is name so after Grace has saved
[56:45] us Grace introduced us into this family
[56:49] word uh uh uh chapter 4 verse 4 there is
[56:55] one body one Spirit even us ye are
[57:00] called in one hope of your calling one
[57:03] Lord One Faith one baptism one God the
[57:07] father of all who is above all and true
[57:11] all and in you all praise the Lord
[57:14] Hallelujah so after we've been
[57:16] introduced into into their family we
[57:20] take on the name of of God and that's
[57:24] that's what makes us an ambassador
[57:26] because heaven heaven has us has uh has
[57:29] has adopted us as children we are
[57:32] bearing the name of God then he brings
[57:34] us here now into chapter four uh uh
[57:37] we're just doing a review here I want to
[57:40] bring you to something tonight
[57:42] now over here in chapter four uh we
[57:46] realize now God brings us on the the
[57:50] protection and also the guidance of a
[57:53] faithful Ministry a fight for Ministry
[57:56] that is liking to the the
[58:01] that is likened to the cherubins around
[58:04] the throne amen we know that the fight
[58:07] for Ministry is locking on to the man
[58:11] the ox the ego and uh and the lion those
[58:16] those four anointing that is around the
[58:18] throne so this fight for Ministry each
[58:21] of those Ministry are identified honor
[58:25] one of the nature of uh of those uh of
[58:28] those beasts around the throne you know
[58:30] brother Brandon make us to know that uh
[58:33] the prophet and the Evangelist is under
[58:36] the ego's anointing praise the Lord amen
[58:40] the prophet and the Evangelist is under
[58:44] the ego's anointing the Evangelist he
[58:47] can he can just you know he can go that
[58:50] speed you know rebuke sin and and
[58:52] therefore and the prophet can also go as
[58:55] far you know into the heavens and he can
[58:58] see it and foresee things now it is very
[59:02] is very very uh uh peculiar and a
[59:05] blessing because in our age God sent us
[59:08] a prophet that have an evangelistical
[59:12] Ministry
[59:15] burbanon office was a prophet
[59:19] but he operate that gift as an
[59:22] evangelist
[59:25] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[59:27] why he says I was never a successful
[59:30] pastor
[59:34] praise the Lord now so we we see that
[59:37] the prophet and I'm not I'm not teaching
[59:39] under the oh I'm not teaching on the
[59:41] fight for Ministry I just I'm just
[59:43] creating uh I thought as we passed
[59:46] through here so the prophet and the and
[59:49] the evangelists operate under the ego's
[59:52] anointing the man is the teacher
[59:56] praise the Lord the teacher that God
[59:59] will bless him with uh with uh
[1:00:03] uh wisdom
[1:00:05] we know that the pastor is the ox of the
[1:00:11] team he is the bearing the bird and
[1:00:13] Bearer amen he is the ox of the team you
[1:00:16] know so we have the pastor there the
[1:00:19] arks of the team we have uh uh the men's
[1:00:23] anointing that is there with uh with the
[1:00:26] teacher we have uh the
[1:00:29] the the ego anointing and the umbrella
[1:00:33] Brandon will let us know that the lion
[1:00:35] anointing is also with the missionary
[1:00:38] which is the apostle
[1:00:42] praise the Lord he's the one that goes
[1:00:44] out he's the one that that these with
[1:00:48] beasts at Ephesus
[1:00:50] uh so so that's that is that is your
[1:00:53] fight for Ministry so God just like the
[1:00:56] the Tabernacle we show you that picture
[1:00:58] of Israel Tabernacle and and you know
[1:01:02] the full uh anointing was around the
[1:01:05] Tabernacle so God uh bring us when he
[1:01:09] saved us he bring us under the
[1:01:11] protection
[1:01:13] all those faithful Ministry so you see
[1:01:16] it takes the fight for Ministry to bring
[1:01:18] us to perfection
[1:01:20] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[1:01:23] why we tried as best as we can to be
[1:01:25] able to expose you to different
[1:01:27] Ministries you know as they come through
[1:01:29] our way because that's what it takes to
[1:01:32] bring us to Perfection is therefore our
[1:01:35] our protection and it's also there for
[1:01:39] our Perfection meaning there to bring us
[1:01:42] to maturity like Paul says here he gave
[1:01:45] some
[1:01:47] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:01:50] evangelists and some pastors and some
[1:01:53] teachers for the perfecting all the
[1:01:55] saints there's chapter 4 verse 12.
[1:01:59] for the working of the ministry and for
[1:02:02] the early firing of the church till we
[1:02:04] all come
[1:02:06] to the unity of the faith and to the
[1:02:08] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:02:10] perfect man onto the measure of the
[1:02:13] Statue of the fullness of Christ so he
[1:02:16] warn us God wants us to grow that we
[1:02:20] hence for be no more children because
[1:02:23] when God brought the first Son of God he
[1:02:26] was not a baby
[1:02:28] he was not a baby
[1:02:30] praise the Lord he was not a baby
[1:02:34] when he brought the first Son of God
[1:02:37] When God says let's make man in our
[1:02:39] image it was a man show man amen it was
[1:02:43] a man it was a son Adam that uh uh you
[1:02:48] know God expressed him in that uh in
[1:02:50] that in that uh other state in that
[1:02:53] Manchester so uh you don't want us to be
[1:02:56] tossed about like children you want us
[1:02:58] to grow like and and to be uh Sons and
[1:03:02] Daughters now so they are the five for
[1:03:05] Ministry is to bring us there then as
[1:03:08] Paul goes on talking about all of these
[1:03:11] things
[1:03:12] he comes over to chapter five and he
[1:03:16] starts dealing with uh uh verse 1 be be
[1:03:21] therefore followers of God as their
[1:03:24] children and walk in love as Christ also
[1:03:27] have loved us and has given himself
[1:03:31] an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[1:03:35] sweet smell and silver
[1:03:37] but fornication and all uncleanness and
[1:03:40] conversa it now be one's name among you
[1:03:44] has become Saints need of filthiness no
[1:03:48] foolish talking meow he's really getting
[1:03:52] into
[1:03:53] uh our spirit man let me say that way
[1:03:58] now he has brought us into the body he
[1:04:01] has brought us and and exposed us to
[1:04:04] this to this uh uh protection that we
[1:04:07] have which is a faithful ministry under
[1:04:09] the leadership of the Holy Spirit and uh
[1:04:13] so now he's going to start dealing with
[1:04:16] our spirit men bringing us to a place
[1:04:19] here
[1:04:21] and as he goes on talking about this he
[1:04:25] you know you can you can read you know
[1:04:27] all the the the verses there for this
[1:04:30] you know there are no warmongers known
[1:04:33] unclean person or Converse man uh who is
[1:04:37] an idolater have any inheritance in the
[1:04:41] Kingdom of Christ and God let no man
[1:04:43] deceive you within words for because of
[1:04:47] these things come at the wrath of God
[1:04:49] upon the children of Disobedience and he
[1:04:51] goes on and on and on and then uh pretty
[1:04:55] soon he's coming now to let us to see
[1:04:58] that as God is with us uh uh uh uh being
[1:05:04] saved by grace and uh and the fight for
[1:05:07] Ministry is there you know teaching us
[1:05:09] and guiding us is bringing us where to
[1:05:13] to a relationship with God
[1:05:16] praise the Lord now he's going to as he
[1:05:19] goes on with there then he gets into the
[1:05:22] family life
[1:05:24] now the reason why we read Ephesians
[1:05:28] chapter 6 to 9 for our scripture reading
[1:05:30] is to let us to see that
[1:05:33] all of these stages in our life all of
[1:05:37] these things that God by Grace have
[1:05:40] exposed us to
[1:05:42] we will have to fight for them
[1:05:46] praise the lord it's true that we are
[1:05:49] saved by grace and just like how brother
[1:05:51] Branham said the promise was given to
[1:05:54] the children of Israel but they had to
[1:05:56] fight for every inch of ground
[1:05:59] if you want to enjoy the benefit of the
[1:06:02] fight for Ministry you will have to
[1:06:04] fight for it
[1:06:07] praise the Lord
[1:06:09] how how will you fight for it you got to
[1:06:12] keep yourself in the word
[1:06:14] right you got to keep yourself in prayer
[1:06:16] that you will not just be carried away
[1:06:18] when somebody come and see some kind of
[1:06:20] offensive thing
[1:06:22] but you know that whatever the person is
[1:06:24] saying is in the word
[1:06:28] praise the Lord if you want to enjoy
[1:06:31] your sanctification you will have to
[1:06:33] fight for it
[1:06:36] you will have to fight against all the
[1:06:38] spirits that are trying to rob you
[1:06:41] of incentive for life
[1:06:45] you have to show those things that's the
[1:06:47] reason why Paul is dealing with these
[1:06:49] things here he says uh you know uh uh
[1:06:52] filthiness foolish talking
[1:06:54] uh uh non-jestine and and uh which are
[1:06:59] not convenient you know he says he said
[1:07:02] get rid of those things
[1:07:04] because it's going to rob you
[1:07:09] praise the Lord
[1:07:10] and then and as he comes slowly into
[1:07:13] into family life where he's dealing with
[1:07:16] the man loves your wife the woman you
[1:07:19] know respect your husband and all of
[1:07:21] that and then he gets into children and
[1:07:24] parents
[1:07:26] then he says Now put on the armor of God
[1:07:29] because if you want to enjoy those
[1:07:31] things
[1:07:33] you have to fight for it
[1:07:38] praise the Lord
[1:07:39] you want to enjoy the uh your family
[1:07:42] life you will have to fight for it
[1:07:48] you want to enjoy your your relationship
[1:07:51] with your parents you will have to fight
[1:07:53] for it
[1:07:55] you have to pray you have to uh you know
[1:07:58] uh get away from comparing yourself with
[1:08:01] other families and you know other people
[1:08:03] can do these things for their children
[1:08:04] forget about their they are not your
[1:08:06] parents
[1:08:08] they are not your parents why compare
[1:08:10] yourself with uh uh people that are not
[1:08:12] sending you to school or paying uh uh uh
[1:08:15] buying food for you
[1:08:22] praise the Lord
[1:08:24] family life you will have to fight for
[1:08:26] it
[1:08:29] the relay your relationship between your
[1:08:31] husband and wife you will have to fight
[1:08:33] for it you have to constantly pray and
[1:08:36] constantly stay in the word
[1:08:42] that's what we must put on the whole
[1:08:44] armor of God
[1:08:47] praise the Lord let's look at some few
[1:08:50] uh uh scripture here in that light
[1:08:55] praise the Lord
[1:08:58] let's look at some few scripture here
[1:09:02] in that light that there's there are
[1:09:04] other ways that Paul
[1:09:07] kind of for approach this
[1:09:19] I told her how that uh
[1:09:33] oh sorry I'm
[1:09:35] I'm kind of a key in the wrong word here
[1:09:42] okay
[1:09:43] Let's uh let's uh take Romans chapter
[1:09:48] 13.
[1:09:50] Romans chapter 13.
[1:10:00] now you will see the other
[1:10:06] left for a few minutes here
[1:10:19] mm-hmm
[1:10:23] in Romans chapter 13
[1:10:44] . okay let's look at verse 11 trying to
[1:10:46] find a good place for us to to back up
[1:10:49] here
[1:10:50] yeah because Paul is he's dealing with
[1:10:53] in the same light of what we are talking
[1:10:55] about he says and that knowing the time
[1:11:00] that now it is
[1:11:04] High time to awake out of sleep
[1:11:09] for now that's Romans chapter 13 is am I
[1:11:12] right am I there or am I reading
[1:11:15] something different
[1:11:18] and they are knowing the time
[1:11:20] that now it is high time to awake out of
[1:11:25] sleep
[1:11:26] for now is our Salvation nearer
[1:11:31] then when we believe
[1:11:34] praise the Lord
[1:11:35] that word nearer means that
[1:11:39] let me say it in our language the
[1:11:42] message is now becoming clearer
[1:11:45] amen the message is now becoming clearer
[1:11:49] because we are now Understanding God's
[1:11:52] purpose for our life
[1:11:55] amen you have to realize that brother
[1:11:58] Brandon make us to know in what is the
[1:12:00] attraction on the mountain he make us to
[1:12:03] know that the message will will take
[1:12:06] another turn leaving the attraction of
[1:12:09] the messenger
[1:12:11] amen told the message itself
[1:12:15] now we know that God sent us a prophet
[1:12:19] we believe that
[1:12:23] the prophet came for a purpose
[1:12:27] those fields were opened because our
[1:12:30] names were laying under those heels
[1:12:34] are we together
[1:12:36] amen he says that that's what Malachi 4
[1:12:40] will do he will literally turn our
[1:12:43] hearts back
[1:12:44] to the faith of the father and what
[1:12:46] would do it those Divine mystery truth
[1:12:52] so when Paul says here that our
[1:12:55] Salvation
[1:12:56] nearer is now nearer than when we first
[1:12:59] believe because when we first believed
[1:13:02] we were measuring on the prophet on the
[1:13:05] baptism we were measuring on all the
[1:13:07] church forces and all the doctrine that
[1:13:09] is there but now we realize now
[1:13:12] we are the one that is now in the arena
[1:13:16] praise the Lord we are not we are not on
[1:13:19] the show just cheering now for whoever
[1:13:21] is uh you know our best preacher you
[1:13:24] know when in uh and uh you know the best
[1:13:26] environment but we realize now we are
[1:13:28] the one now in the ring
[1:13:32] we have to deal with with the reality of
[1:13:35] life
[1:13:37] we have growing up we have families we
[1:13:40] have responsibility
[1:13:43] we have an age that is rapidly changing
[1:13:47] before our eyes
[1:13:50] our salvation
[1:13:53] is nearer
[1:13:54] than we first believe
[1:13:57] praise the Lord so he says the night is
[1:14:02] fasting
[1:14:03] the day is our hand
[1:14:05] let us therefore cast all the works of
[1:14:09] darkness
[1:14:10] and let us put on the armor of light
[1:14:17] praise the Lord in in Ephesians he says
[1:14:20] put on the whole armor of God
[1:14:23] now yeah in Romans he's telling if you
[1:14:26] read Romans chapter 13 you will realize
[1:14:28] that the very same thing where he's
[1:14:30] telling the church their inhibition is
[1:14:33] the same thing he's telling the the the
[1:14:35] Believers yet in in uh in uh Rome
[1:14:41] praise the Lord
[1:14:44] I'm I'm caught up in in a taught here do
[1:14:47] I have time in a few minutes
[1:14:49] laughs
[1:14:51] let me share something with you quickly
[1:14:54] uh
[1:14:57] if uh if I'm right
[1:15:01] if I'm
[1:15:07] if I'm right
[1:15:09] no
[1:15:11] I thought I had it in my notes
[1:15:14] for
[1:15:17] uh
[1:15:19] part of my notes on on Sunday that we
[1:15:22] did with
[1:15:24] there's a there's a portion of it that I
[1:15:26] never came to I'm I'm keeping it for for
[1:15:29] a little time but let me read something
[1:15:31] to you here so you so we'll be able to
[1:15:33] to grab a picture a mentor picture
[1:15:37] brother Brandon I've I've I've searched
[1:15:39] for this quote for a long time and uh
[1:15:43] the Lord kind of uh blessed me to bless
[1:15:46] us to see it
[1:15:49] the prophet said yes is uh Revelation
[1:15:53] Revelation series called the the
[1:15:58] it's not there so the technicians will
[1:16:00] now put it off but uh
[1:16:04] oh let me let me do something here
[1:16:10] let me do something you wanna
[1:16:14] it's fast
[1:16:16] we are in a wavelength so I've already
[1:16:18] sent it to them
[1:16:19] just to share with you tonight
[1:16:22] so in no time they can put it up for us
[1:16:25] and and we can we can all enjoy it
[1:16:28] together
[1:16:30] something will grab something I want to
[1:16:32] I want to make emphasis on here so so
[1:16:34] let's let's just read that it's it's out
[1:16:37] of the the message uh the revelation of
[1:16:39] Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] now brother Branham says say this he
[1:16:43] said
[1:16:44] uh
[1:16:47] let's give them few minutes
[1:17:12] okay he says the letters to the seven
[1:17:16] Church Ages were written
[1:17:19] prophetic calling to the Future ages
[1:17:24] Paul wrote
[1:17:26] of the life and the glory of the seven
[1:17:30] churches present in his day do you know
[1:17:33] that Paul has seven churches in his
[1:17:36] letters that he wrote
[1:17:38] in all the letters that Paul wrote they
[1:17:41] are 13 represent the number of a woman
[1:17:45] one is to Philemon that was a direct
[1:17:48] letter it was not to a group it was just
[1:17:50] to filament uh you know kind of for
[1:17:52] talking to him but when you when you
[1:17:54] count from The Book of Romans to the
[1:17:58] book of Hebrew and take the letter of
[1:18:00] Philemon out there are 13 letters
[1:18:04] in in all but if you count the churches
[1:18:08] that Paul wrote to the Church of Rome
[1:18:11] the Church of Corinth the Church of
[1:18:14] thessalonica the Church of episodes The
[1:18:17] Church of uh uh
[1:18:20] Philippa and the Church of collusion
[1:18:23] seven churches
[1:18:25] a kind of a blessing yeah brother
[1:18:27] Branham said Paul wrote of the life and
[1:18:30] the glory of the seven churches present
[1:18:33] in his day
[1:18:35] John wrote of the life and the glory of
[1:18:39] the seven churches in the future
[1:18:49] praise the Lord
[1:18:53] now I've used this as a bid now to grab
[1:18:56] you
[1:18:57] praise the Lord
[1:18:58] I wanted to use this as a bit to grab
[1:19:00] you then I can be able to drill what I
[1:19:03] want to drill down in you
[1:19:05] so you see here the other that uh uh
[1:19:12] if you wash the if you wash the letters
[1:19:15] of Paul if you wash the way he spoke to
[1:19:19] the churches you will see that in every
[1:19:22] church he deal with the same thing it's
[1:19:24] almost just like the seven churches in
[1:19:26] the Book of Revelation
[1:19:30] so the chapter 13 year he's talking to
[1:19:35] the the church in Rome just like the
[1:19:38] same way he's speaking to the church in
[1:19:41] Ephesus in a sixth chapter now he says
[1:19:44] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:19:47] will be able to fight now he says here
[1:19:50] to the Roman Church as our Salvation is
[1:19:53] nearer than we first believe we're
[1:19:56] seeing the things that is happening he
[1:19:57] says yeah the night is fast pen there is
[1:20:00] no time for foolishness that there is a
[1:20:03] hand let us therefore cast all the works
[1:20:07] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[1:20:10] of life so the the the the the the the
[1:20:14] armor of God that Paul identified in
[1:20:17] inefficient where he says you know he
[1:20:20] called every member he says when you put
[1:20:22] all of those armor together the armor of
[1:20:26] light
[1:20:28] why because we walk in the light as he
[1:20:32] is in the light
[1:20:38] now so you will now be able to see your
[1:20:42] way in this age you will now be able to
[1:20:45] overcome the things that you are dealing
[1:20:47] with until you put on the whole armor of
[1:20:50] God
[1:20:52] you got to put on the armor of life
[1:20:55] because the dead is evil the day is dark
[1:21:03] praise the Lord
[1:21:05] even though science is making lights
[1:21:08] that are more brighter than ever before
[1:21:10] but it means that the reason why the
[1:21:13] lights are getting more brighter because
[1:21:15] the day is dark
[1:21:18] your dead is evil
[1:21:21] so now God comes and the armor that he
[1:21:25] dress us in
[1:21:26] is the armor of light
[1:21:31] when you take on the whole armor of God
[1:21:34] not taking one and leaving the other
[1:21:37] praise the Lord
[1:21:38] amen
[1:21:40] I heard somebody say she says you can
[1:21:43] know those that are not wearing their
[1:21:44] helmet
[1:21:46] but they banish around their head
[1:21:50] by the different wounds that they are
[1:21:52] carrying
[1:21:54] in the alliance
[1:21:55] in their family they said they said
[1:21:58] that's a there's a new a recent
[1:22:01] statistics
[1:22:03] of family
[1:22:04] I was listening to during a week
[1:22:07] I didn't get everything together so
[1:22:09] that's why I'm not sharing it with you
[1:22:11] tonight but it's very very concerning
[1:22:16] it's very very concerning and and their
[1:22:18] statistics is pulled together right here
[1:22:21] in the U.S
[1:22:23] praise the Lord
[1:22:27] and with and with uh and with that I
[1:22:30] will share it I will share it with you
[1:22:31] let me not stop speaking over my head
[1:22:33] because I'm not I'm not I've not put
[1:22:35] everything together yet
[1:22:37] you see so you we we we have to realize
[1:22:40] and is is is dwelling on family life
[1:22:44] is showing how
[1:22:46] uh
[1:22:50] the family structure
[1:22:53] has been destroyed
[1:22:55] his family structure has been ravaged
[1:22:58] you know he's is showing I mean is is
[1:23:00] very very big on why
[1:23:05] especially fathers and men are becoming
[1:23:08] weaker
[1:23:12] I will bring I'll bring I'll bring this
[1:23:14] artist to you and uh
[1:23:18] so you see it but it's because of the
[1:23:20] day that we are living in
[1:23:25] because of the day because of the age
[1:23:28] that we are in
[1:23:33] praise the Lord
[1:23:41] now so Paul called this to the to the
[1:23:44] church in Rome the the the armor of
[1:23:47] light let's let's take another another
[1:23:50] description here
[1:23:53] quarantine chapter 6.
[1:23:58] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:24:02] I'm left with a few minutes I'll close
[1:24:04] just now
[1:24:07] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:22] now so you can never you can never be
[1:24:25] able to face the evil of this day you
[1:24:28] can never be able to overcome the spirit
[1:24:31] of the age if you don't have the armor
[1:24:34] of God on
[1:24:35] because you won't be able to see it's at
[1:24:38] that age
[1:24:39] that's right so you see God dressed his
[1:24:41] people in light
[1:24:44] to protect us
[1:24:46] when we walk in the light as he is in
[1:24:48] the light
[1:24:50] we have access to the blood
[1:24:53] the blood cleanses us
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:58] there is no condemnation to them that
[1:25:00] are in Christ
[1:25:02] now Paul yeah now in in the second
[1:25:05] Corinthians chapter 6 verse e 11.
[1:25:17] am I right
[1:25:19] no no not verse 11.
[1:25:25] okay there's there's uh verse 7.
[1:25:31] verse 6 by pureness by knowledge by
[1:25:35] long-suffering by kindness by the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost by love on frame by the word of
[1:25:41] Truth by the power of God by the armor
[1:25:46] of righteousness on the right hand and
[1:25:50] on the left now in in inefficient there
[1:25:54] is the breastplate of righteousness is
[1:25:57] different from the armor of
[1:25:58] righteousness
[1:26:01] he's talking about the complete armor
[1:26:08] praise the Lord amen as it is an armor
[1:26:13] of light
[1:26:15] is an armor of righteousness
[1:26:18] so you see it he became sin for us
[1:26:22] and dress us
[1:26:26] in his righteousness
[1:26:28] that's the reason why when you read the
[1:26:30] uh uh uh
[1:26:33] take on the whole I'm out of God brother
[1:26:34] Branham said he says he says he says
[1:26:37] what are these faithful Ministries
[1:26:40] he says it's God's dress where
[1:26:44] to be able to equip the church to dress
[1:26:47] the church up
[1:26:48] for the day that we are living in
[1:26:52] you see that's the reason why we're
[1:26:53] around the subject of uh uh uh exceeding
[1:26:57] righteousness
[1:27:00] you know because because of of the age
[1:27:03] the time that we are living in
[1:27:06] praise the Lord and and that that is
[1:27:09] that is the spirit that people are
[1:27:10] dealing with
[1:27:14] because they are they are they are they
[1:27:18] are they are Church Traditions they are
[1:27:20] things that the the grace of God the
[1:27:23] message of the hour want to Deliver Us
[1:27:25] from
[1:27:28] praise the Lord
[1:27:29] you go into the church world you go into
[1:27:32] the religious word you'll find this
[1:27:35] saying very very common just to bring
[1:27:37] every one of us at the same level we are
[1:27:40] all sinners saved by grace we don't
[1:27:42] fight against it we believe it amen
[1:27:44] praise the lord we are all sinner saved
[1:27:47] by grace Ephesians just tell us here by
[1:27:50] Grace how we save it is not our work
[1:27:53] amen but when Grace save us Grace
[1:27:57] introduced us to a family
[1:28:01] and most of the time when people use
[1:28:04] that is an excuse
[1:28:06] of not getting away from their sinful
[1:28:09] habit don't judge me we are all sinners
[1:28:11] saved by grace
[1:28:15] no we're not we're not holding to our
[1:28:17] own righteousness in appreciating the
[1:28:20] grace of God we are living right
[1:28:23] in appreciating the grace of God we are
[1:28:25] getting away from the things that the
[1:28:27] word of God condemned
[1:28:30] the same way we are saved by grace
[1:28:33] that's the same way God has dressed Us
[1:28:35] in his righteousness
[1:28:38] so we have an armor of righteousness
[1:28:41] so we can make excuses
[1:28:44] he has given us an armor of
[1:28:47] righteousness it's not our own
[1:28:49] righteousness it's a filthy wreck
[1:28:53] but his righteousness is our protection
[1:29:01] so we must believe we must constantly
[1:29:03] believe in the righteous one
[1:29:08] that no matter whatever we are dealing
[1:29:10] with God is more than able to deliver us
[1:29:13] God is faithful at his word
[1:29:16] that armor of righteousness will make us
[1:29:19] to constantly believe in him
[1:29:26] praise the Lord
[1:29:28] it's the armor of light it's the armor
[1:29:30] of righteousness
[1:29:36] are we together
[1:29:45] because as we as we go you see that's
[1:29:48] that is the thing that is that is
[1:29:50] stumbling the people in the age that we
[1:29:53] are living in
[1:29:54] people are dealing with things in their
[1:29:57] life and they have created all sorts of
[1:30:00] religious way to overcome it they try to
[1:30:03] fast it out it's not going
[1:30:06] they try to pray out it's not going
[1:30:09] praise the Lord
[1:30:11] and now with those things in their life
[1:30:14] believing that God says I would be I'm
[1:30:17] your deliverer and and and those things
[1:30:20] are there what is happening to them is
[1:30:23] that the devil is using that very thing
[1:30:25] to make them to know now you see you're
[1:30:27] not a son of God you're not a daughter
[1:30:28] of God because your life has never
[1:30:30] changed why he's constantly making us to
[1:30:35] look at our our our sinful nature our
[1:30:39] our flesh realizing that by the flesh no
[1:30:43] no man will be justified
[1:30:46] and we are not appreciating the things
[1:30:48] that that the understanding that Grace
[1:30:51] is bringing to us
[1:30:55] that's where most of these people are
[1:30:57] stumbling uh uh uh uh and says well not
[1:31:00] nothing is happening most of the time
[1:31:02] when people say nothing is happening
[1:31:04] it's not among you is in themselves
[1:31:09] because a person that is seeing the
[1:31:11] grace of God that is helping them
[1:31:16] can I say nothing is happening
[1:31:19] praise the Lord
[1:31:26] now what what were the what were the the
[1:31:28] the the Apostle Paul tells us
[1:31:33] Paul will make us to realize that God
[1:31:37] think about it think about it what what
[1:31:39] a paradise it is that God
[1:31:42] we meet Paul on the road of Damascus
[1:31:46] smacked him with the light
[1:31:50] praise the Lord
[1:31:52] send ananias to pray for him
[1:31:55] Paul will get his side back
[1:31:58] but he will not get a complete healing
[1:32:00] in his eyes
[1:32:03] and Paul will testify to us that if God
[1:32:07] did not keep him with that eyes
[1:32:10] bothering him he will exalt himself
[1:32:12] Beyond himself
[1:32:15] because God blessed him so much
[1:32:18] as a messenger of Grace as the messenger
[1:32:21] of the New Testament
[1:32:23] that even Peter testified that things
[1:32:27] that were revealed to Paul Peter called
[1:32:29] a scripture
[1:32:32] that's Peter testimony he called Paul
[1:32:35] writing scripture
[1:32:37] so Paul was recognized as a prophet
[1:32:43] but here is this Prophet here
[1:32:46] bottling and brother Branham said that
[1:32:48] is the thing that will stumble Alexander
[1:32:50] the couple Smith
[1:32:52] and all of these men are demise and all
[1:32:54] of these men that will leave for why
[1:32:56] because they are seeing Paul doing this
[1:32:59] and yet he's complaining about an eye
[1:33:01] problem
[1:33:07] praise the Lord
[1:33:12] and God will do their to to all of his
[1:33:16] children
[1:33:20] he will do that to all of his children
[1:33:22] better brand him in a message on the
[1:33:24] wings of a snow white dog he says uh you
[1:33:27] know standing in a prayer line for for
[1:33:29] how many hours praying for the sake
[1:33:31] and yet I had this stomach problems
[1:33:38] praise the Lord
[1:33:43] so if we if we don't learn to appreciate
[1:33:47] God's grace beyond our weaknesses if we
[1:33:51] don't learn to emphasize on the thing
[1:33:54] that the grace of God is helping us
[1:33:56] above beyond the places where we are
[1:33:59] feeling
[1:34:04] praise the Lord you see it in every age
[1:34:07] God says to him that overcome
[1:34:10] it is now when you overcome before God
[1:34:13] knew that there will be Overcomers
[1:34:16] he knew that every age we haven't
[1:34:19] overcome even before you got here
[1:34:22] before you start facing the challenge of
[1:34:24] your age God knew that there will be
[1:34:26] Overcomers in this age
[1:34:28] that's why he says to him that
[1:34:30] overcometh
[1:34:34] not to him that will overcome but to him
[1:34:37] that overcoming because he have already
[1:34:39] seen that there will be an overcomer in
[1:34:42] this age like it was in every age
[1:34:46] and how are we going to overcome
[1:34:50] by the blood of the Lamb which is the
[1:34:52] bleeding word
[1:34:54] and the words of Our Testimony
[1:34:56] testifying on what God has done
[1:35:02] praise the Lord
[1:35:05] now testify in ourself
[1:35:10] praise the Lord
[1:35:12] you see so that's why we should put on
[1:35:14] the whole armor of God because those are
[1:35:16] the things that we are going to deal
[1:35:17] with
[1:35:19] those are the things that we are going
[1:35:21] to deal with
[1:35:23] as we talk about uh uh uh I mean even in
[1:35:27] the life of our children in the life of
[1:35:29] our spouses you know in the life of one
[1:35:32] another as we have the grace to be able
[1:35:35] to identify things that we need to work
[1:35:38] on we must also find the grace to be
[1:35:41] able to identify areas where God is
[1:35:44] helping your children areas where God is
[1:35:48] helping your husband area where God is
[1:35:52] helping your wife be able to find it and
[1:35:54] identify it says I I see the Lord is
[1:35:57] helping you yeah
[1:35:58] you know the Lord is giving us Grace
[1:36:00] here
[1:36:03] because with our fallen nature is so
[1:36:08] easy constantly we will do it on the
[1:36:10] failure and constantly dwelling on the
[1:36:13] failure is not appreciation to the grace
[1:36:15] of God
[1:36:20] praise the Lord
[1:36:22] that's why we must put on the whole
[1:36:24] armor of God
[1:36:28] we must broker ourselves with the truth
[1:36:32] to be able to identify things that we
[1:36:35] need to work on and also be able to
[1:36:38] identify things where God grace is
[1:36:40] happiness
[1:36:43] if nobody can tell you tell yourself
[1:36:45] Lord thank you you are helping me
[1:36:48] and really know I need I I I I I see I
[1:36:51] see your grace in this era of my life
[1:37:00] praise the Lord
[1:37:01] just like how Israel had to fight for
[1:37:04] every inch of ground
[1:37:08] you have to fight for every inch of
[1:37:11] ground
[1:37:13] if you want a wonderful service you got
[1:37:15] to create the atmosphere
[1:37:17] don't come put your hands in your pocket
[1:37:19] just be sitting down like a statue be
[1:37:21] looking and be wandering out thinking
[1:37:23] about things no put your mind on Christ
[1:37:28] be praying Lord help the song leader
[1:37:31] Lord give us a wonderful service today
[1:37:32] clap your hands when it's time to sink
[1:37:35] you have to fight
[1:37:39] we have to create an atmosphere
[1:37:47] praise the Lord
[1:37:49] let's enjoy the presence of the Lord
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:57] when you enjoy the word
[1:37:58] is sounding good to you tell somebody
[1:38:00] that was good I enjoy it
[1:38:03] praise the Lord
[1:38:04] maybe I went over the person's head
[1:38:09] but we have to fight for it
[1:38:14] to be able to enjoy it we must fight for
[1:38:17] it fight for every inch of ground take
[1:38:19] on the whole armor of God it's the armor
[1:38:22] of light
[1:38:23] they say ammo of righteousness
[1:38:28] see it's just it's just almost like uh
[1:38:30] uh
[1:38:33] uh
[1:38:36] Saul
[1:38:39] knowing when David came out there
[1:38:41] with the courage that he will he will
[1:38:44] he would get Goliath
[1:38:47] saw admire the courage
[1:38:50] he knew that the boy was never had no
[1:38:52] military training but he said at least
[1:38:55] since he had the courage let me address
[1:38:57] him in my armor
[1:39:00] he did not know that David already had
[1:39:03] an armor on
[1:39:04] amen David David was wearing an armor of
[1:39:07] praise
[1:39:11] he addressed himself in in uh you know
[1:39:14] and and in in in the armor of what God
[1:39:17] has done the same God that delivered the
[1:39:19] Bear in my hand the same God that gave
[1:39:22] me the lion the God God is going to give
[1:39:24] me these Philistines amen
[1:39:27] praise the Lord
[1:39:28] and you can tell the devil that I mean
[1:39:30] you can be able to pick up things in
[1:39:32] your life and say the god that delivered
[1:39:34] me from this thing the god that
[1:39:36] delivered me from this thing you you can
[1:39:39] identify it
[1:39:42] the same God will be able to deliver me
[1:39:45] from this
[1:39:47] I don't know how I don't care how kind
[1:39:49] of how much you try to discourage you
[1:39:51] how much you know it keeps sticking in
[1:39:53] your face to weaken your face but you
[1:39:56] have to remind yourself that's the
[1:39:57] reason why you have to identify things I
[1:40:00] mean not just things you are you are
[1:40:02] practicing religiously but things that
[1:40:05] you know that God by his grace has rise
[1:40:08] you above
[1:40:14] praise the Lord
[1:40:15] I mean that's the hour we are living in
[1:40:25] looks like the Rapture keep lingering
[1:40:28] because there are few that must make it
[1:40:32] there must be there must be a small
[1:40:34] group
[1:40:37] praise the Lord
[1:40:44] and those ones are going to be
[1:40:45] Overcomers
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:50] it's going to be Overcomers
[1:40:54] just like we are looking at this subject
[1:40:56] if you look in the life of tema the
[1:40:59] thing that term are dead there is no
[1:41:01] righteousness in it
[1:41:03] the thing that she did
[1:41:05] there you there is nothing right about
[1:41:08] it
[1:41:10] right but what did Judah call
[1:41:13] be more righteous
[1:41:16] was the thought
[1:41:19] it was the thought the desire that she
[1:41:22] had in her heart
[1:41:24] to be identified with the blessing not
[1:41:26] the art we keep looking at the Arts that
[1:41:29] our body is producing the Arts our
[1:41:32] thoughts is producing the things that we
[1:41:33] are doing
[1:41:39] what did David appreciate about uh
[1:41:42] Abigail it was not the food
[1:41:47] it was the thought behind it
[1:41:51] they taught to save him from sharing
[1:41:54] blood
[1:41:55] because David has already made up his
[1:41:57] mind is going to be a bloody money
[1:42:05] but to realize that she came at the time
[1:42:09] of Mercy to hold his hands from sharing
[1:42:12] blood it was not a fault
[1:42:15] it's not the Arts
[1:42:19] it's the talk it's the desire
[1:42:22] it's your motives and your objectives
[1:42:25] that's why you should go back tall
[1:42:28] if it is wrong as God Lord help me
[1:42:31] deliver me this action of mine was not
[1:42:34] right
[1:42:40] it's dealing with those inner things
[1:42:47] praise the Lord
[1:42:56] I mean God is good praise the Lord
