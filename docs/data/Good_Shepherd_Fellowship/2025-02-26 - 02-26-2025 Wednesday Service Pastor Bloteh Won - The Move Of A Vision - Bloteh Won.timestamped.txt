[34:29] uh we can be a blessing we've been
[34:32] dwelling on this subject about the
[34:34] effect of the move of God we want to
[34:37] look at tonight the move in
[34:39] Vision the move in Vision on Sunday we
[34:43] talk about Moses how God moved down and
[34:46] got into a burning bush and then got
[34:50] Moses attention and uh that that was
[34:53] another move because God moves in
[34:55] different ways amen amen there is a old
[34:58] song uh chorus that says uh the spirit
[35:01] of God uh uh the Holy Ghost is moving
[35:04] like a magnet it's moving here it's
[35:07] moving there he moving all about
[35:09] everywhere so we're going to see the
[35:11] move of God in different ways amen
[35:14] because God moves Upon Our Hearts he
[35:16] deals with every one of us in different
[35:17] way when he moved in Eden the Bible says
[35:21] the spirit of God move upon the water
[35:23] when he moved in the days of Noah he
[35:25] moved him to build an ark when when he
[35:28] moved on Abraham he moved him out of
[35:30] Babylon to a land he says I will give
[35:34] thee amen when he move to to Moses he
[35:37] moved in the burning bush tonight we
[35:39] want to look at the move of God upon
[35:41] Samuel 1 Samuel chapter
[35:48] 3 and something caught my mind from the
[35:51] service on Sunday uh I wish I I'll be
[35:54] able to have the opportunity to go back

[36:36] for us to be able to go about booking
[36:39] anywhere now and you know moving
[36:42] instruments and all of there so we will
[36:45] manage the space after all it's a
[36:47] blessing amen and when we can create an
[36:50] atmosphere here bring the Holy Ghost to
[36:52] this location amen yeah the the angel of
[36:56] the Lord to this location is a blessing
[36:58] maybe he will come down and have mercy
[37:00] upon us amen he will come down discern
[37:03] our knees and say I need to help these
[37:06] people praise the Lord 1 Samuel chapter
[37:09] 3 let's read verse
[37:11] one and the charge Samuel
[37:14] Minister unto the
[37:17] Lord before Eli I wonder how did he
[37:21] Minister I wonder how that he Minister
[37:24] unto the Lord because right here in uh
[37:28] uh 1 Samuel chapter 3 there was is going
[37:32] to show us the first time that God will
[37:34] start dealing with him praise the Lord
[37:37] amen so you see we can Minister unto the
[37:40] Lord even before he start dealing with
[37:42] us right when we bring our children to
[37:44] church when they sing special praise the
[37:47] Lord they come to church they obey the
[37:50] the word of God the by their heads to
[37:52] pray you know they respect the ordinance
[37:54] of God we are ministering unto God all
[37:57] of those things create an atmosphere for
[38:00] God to start dealing with the individual
[38:03] amen the child Samuel Minister unto the
[38:06] Lord before Elam and the word of the
[38:09] Lord was precious in those days there
[38:11] was no open vision and it came to pass
[38:16] at that
[38:19] time that Eli was uh laid down in his
[38:24] place and his eyes began to watch them
[38:27] that he could not
[38:29] see and he the Lamb of God went out in
[38:33] the temple of the
[38:35] Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel
[38:39] was laid down to sleep and the Lord
[38:42] called Samuel and he said yeah am I and
[38:47] he ran to
[38:49] Eli and said yeah am I for thou calleth
[38:53] me and he said I I call that lay down
[38:56] again and he went and laid down and the
[39:00] Lord called again sometimes we don't get
[39:03] it the first time amen he's the god of
[39:06] Second Chances third chances fourth
[39:09] chances because we always don't get it
[39:12] the first time praise the lord we we
[39:16] have to know that we are dealing with an
[39:18] internal God we are dealing with an
[39:21] invisible God there is no way you can
[39:24] get it the first time God will have to
[39:26] condition you by an
[39:29] atmosphere praise the Lord are we
[39:32] together and the Lord called and and and
[39:36] the Lord called yet again Samuel and
[39:38] Samuel arose and went to elot and said
[39:41] here am I for thou cth for that that
[39:44] calleth me and he answer I call not my
[39:48] son laay down again and Samuel did uh
[39:51] did not yet know the Lord but yet he
[39:55] Minister unto the Lord
[39:58] praise the Lord he did not yet know the
[40:01] Lord but yet he ministered unto the Lord
[40:05] praise the Lorden that's a proof that
[40:08] our children being born in the message
[40:10] still need a new birth amen they still
[40:13] need to be born again praise the Lord
[40:16] having our children in holy warlock is
[40:18] there is is no evidence of the Holy
[40:20] Ghost they need to know the Lord are we
[40:24] together now Samuel did not yet know the
[40:27] Lord Lord neither was the word of the
[40:29] Lord yet reveiled unto him and the
[40:33] Lord called Samuel again the third time
[40:37] and he arose and went to Eli and said
[40:41] yeah am I for that they called me and
[40:44] Eli perceived that the Lord had called
[40:47] the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel
[40:51] go lay down and it shall be if he called
[40:55] thee that thou shall say Speak Lord for
[40:58] thy servant hear it so Samuel went and
[41:01] laid down in his place and the Lord came
[41:06] and stood and called as at other times
[41:11] Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak
[41:15] for that seven year amen I I pray that
[41:20] that would be our answer to the Lord

[43:03] mentioned how long a vision and dream
[43:06] takes place I will have pick up there
[43:08] tonight but uh uh I was I was looking
[43:12] through my my Cod notes and I couldn't
[43:14] find it but I will read that to you on
[43:16] Sunday and uh tonight what I want to
[43:18] look at is
[43:20] that uh we talking about the effect of
[43:23] the move of God and uh uh we've been
[43:26] looking at posi positive effect and
[43:28] negative effect praise the Lord Amen
[43:31] brother brandham says a Revival is the
[43:33] move of God in power praise the Lord
[43:36] amen are we together is the move of God
[43:40] in power so uh uh uh and and that's what
[43:44] we've been looking at uh uh tonight we
[43:47] want to look at the the the move of God
[43:51] uh on a
[43:53] vision and uh uh
[43:59] the prophet of God explained this uh uh
[44:01] verse to us when Jesus said I do nothing
[44:05] except that which the father show me he
[44:09] said that means
[44:12] Jesus had a vision everything that God
[44:15] wanted him to do he had a vision now
[44:18] take take take that in context and and
[44:22] and and think about he is the second
[44:25] Adam was that the way that God de with
[44:28] the first
[44:30] Adam that everything that the father
[44:32] wanted him to do the father will reveal
[44:35] to him in Vision could that be the way
[44:37] that God de with him are we together
[44:42] amen Jesus said I do nothing but that
[44:45] which the father shows
[44:48] me are we together praise the lord and
[44:52] there should be the same thing with
[44:54] every one of us we must do nothing but
[44:56] that which the father shows us we might
[44:58] not have an an open Vision we might not
[45:01] have Vision in the context of vision but
[45:05] we also have a vision we have a we have
[45:07] a spiritual Revelation that brings
[45:10] conviction to our hearts that this is
[45:13] what God want us to do amen praise the
[45:16] Lord so we want to just look at uh uh we
[45:19] want to go in that direction tonight
[45:22] brother Brandon uh uh hear his voice he
[45:25] took that scripture there he says and
[45:28] the and the child Samuel Minister unto
[45:30] the Lord before El and the word of the
[45:34] Lord was precious in those days for
[45:38] there was no open Vision see
[45:42] what what a vision is then is the direct
[45:46] word of the Lord amen a vision is a
[45:50] direct word of the Lord are we together
[45:54] amen see and the word of the Lord
[45:57] was
[45:58] precious
[46:00] now then he will he will he will say he
[46:05] he will let us to see this also let's
[46:07] let's look at this in the message the
[46:09] injur in his commission he said I was
[46:11] reading I was reading at the Bible of
[46:14] Daniel after he had those
[46:17] Vision he said he was troubled in his
[46:21] head for many days right we know John in
[46:25] the Book of Revelation after he had his
[46:28] vision he was imparted by the vision
[46:31] until he lie on the floor like a dead
[46:34] man so Visions have
[46:37] impact praise the Lord are we together
[46:41] Vision have impact when the word of God
[46:44] struck our heart and have impacted our
[46:47] life uh uh uh it's it's it's a
[46:50] revelation it's it's a form of vision
[46:53] are we together amen praise the Lord now
[46:57] where I want to go to uh uh the
[47:00] direction I want to
[47:01] go
[47:03] uh to tonight is that just like I said
[47:07] brother Bram talks and and make us to
[47:09] know that you can have a dream and it
[47:12] looks like you are dreaming all through
[47:14] the
[47:16] night he says but that dream is just
[47:19] between two three
[47:23] seconds praise the Lord amen it looks
[47:26] like like it's a whole night dream I was
[47:28] dreaming I went to New York and then
[47:30] from New York I flew over to Atlanta you
[47:33] know and I got on the train you know we
[47:36] were on the train we were traveling on
[47:37] the train but it's Just sh it's all
[47:40] because because you have to see that
[47:42] when we talk about move when you when we
[47:45] talk about move is an action of leaving
[47:47] one place to another so when you talk
[47:50] about move you we must also put speed
[47:54] into context
[47:57] praise the Lord you see that is the
[48:00] reason why we don't pick up the move of
[48:04] God at the first
[48:07] time because God is not moving in the
[48:11] way that our B regulate
[48:14] speed praise the Lord amen I will tell
[48:19] you that uh the kind of a speed that an
[48:22] airplane is on it can never carry that
[48:25] speed on the road on this
[48:30] road it's so fast it's above our driving
[48:34] speed
[48:36] limit that's the reason why you can
[48:39] drive from here to to to to Tennessee
[48:42] about almost 18 20 hours but you can
[48:45] take a two three hours flight and get to
[48:48] Minneapolis different
[48:52] speed are we together amen it's
[48:55] different speed yes so when we talk
[48:57] about the move of
[48:59] God his
[49:01] speed is is sometimes is too fast for us
[49:05] to
[49:06] see that's why Moses stood there waiting
[49:09] to see God and God passed he never saw
[49:12] it until when he turned around oh I saw
[49:14] it was a back part of a
[49:18] man and that is the kind of for Speed
[49:21] level that God is dealing with us
[49:24] changing our body changing our
[49:28] nature and because our
[49:32] mind don't understand speed that fast
[49:36] sometime it looks like God is not doing
[49:41] anything praise the Lord that's the
[49:44] reason why we get healed couple of days
[49:46] before we notice it we get delivered
[49:49] couple of days I mean after after we've
[49:51] been delivered before we know that oh my
[49:53] god oh wow this thing I was praying for
[49:56] the Lord has healed me why because it
[49:59] happened so
[50:05] fast praise the Lord it happened so fast
[50:09] let me let me uh uh uh uh uh I will go
[50:12] ahead of myself it's okay I go ahead of
[50:18] myself when you remember you remember in
[50:22] the the visions that led to the opening
[50:25] of the seals
[50:27] when brother brandham tell those
[50:29] Visions he said it first started with
[50:32] little
[50:34] birds he said when those little birds
[50:39] flew then they became bigger Birds just
[50:43] like doves and when those birds
[50:47] FLW then the Angels
[50:51] appeared it's the one and the same
[50:55] thing but from a distant it could look
[50:58] very
[51:01] little and as it
[51:05] move it look
[51:07] bigger praise the Lord amen it's almost
[51:10] like you flry in an airplane and you
[51:13] looking down on the City of
[51:15] Minneapolis it just look like toy
[51:20] houses because the Destin you
[51:24] are are we together amen
[51:27] so when he was seeing in a
[51:30] vision remember
[51:32] now the angels are bringing the secret
[51:36] that was H from the foundation of the
[51:37] world these angels are coming down from
[51:40] eternity from a distance the looks like
[51:43] little
[51:45] birds as they move closer to
[51:48] time they look like pigeon before he
[51:50] realize there are seven angels
[51:56] it's the
[51:59] speed you see that's the reason why you
[52:02] cannot put your justification your
[52:04] sanctification your baptism of the Holy
[52:07] you cannot put it on calendar it does
[52:09] not work that
[52:11] way no it does not work that
[52:14] way in January I was
[52:17] justified and and and in March no no
[52:21] April and I got
[52:24] Sanctified going have to take three
[52:26] months
[52:27] at least it got to be three it does not
[52:29] work that
[52:32] way it does not work that
[52:39] way right there on the
[52:43] cross the teeth was justified
[52:48] Sanctified and
[52:50] promis to be in eternity right there on
[52:53] the cross he got an impact
[53:01] are we
[53:08] together you see that is the thing that
[53:11] is
[53:12] happening in our ranks that we have not
[53:17] understood and we are running into
[53:22] conflict because we are still in the
[53:25] mind of of the church
[53:28] ages the church ages have their
[53:31] doctrines and their their their uh
[53:34] Reformation application what you need to
[53:37] do to be justified what you need to do
[53:40] to be Sanctified you know you need to
[53:42] you need to do this certain thing so all
[53:44] of those things and and because our mind
[53:48] it makes sense to us so our mind dwell
[53:51] in those things for the
[53:55] wine have are we
[53:58] together praise the Lord there there is
[54:00] somewhere I go into tonight and I hope I
[54:02] can be able to nail you there before we
[54:05] go
[54:06] home it sticks on your mind and you'll
[54:09] be able to go home and meditate upon it
[54:13] praise the
[54:14] Lord Brother b t over and over there are
[54:18] voices passing right in this building
[54:21] praise the Lord amen I heard him saying
[54:24] that I think yesterday he said I hope to
[54:26] live to the day where they will be able
[54:29] to grab the voice of Jesus on my NEC
[54:36] tape praise the Lord amen
[54:40] amen and we see science is trying to
[54:43] break into all of those things science
[54:45] is trying to break into all of those
[54:47] things so uh uh uh when
[54:52] we when you when you look at these
[54:55] things you realize that uh uh uh the
[55:00] Bible says there was there was no open
[55:02] Vision in in that time of
[55:05] Samuel uh there was not a prophet on the
[55:09] land there was not a prophet on the land
[55:12] the word of God uh you remember the
[55:14] people have gone through the time of the
[55:16] judges the judges uh uh uh is uh is a
[55:21] very good type of uh uh you know of the
[55:25] church ages God raising up man uh uh
[55:29] through the the time of reformation to
[55:32] be able to stand for the
[55:34] truth but yet God was going
[55:39] to to bring back his voice his
[55:41] leadership back in the church and he's
[55:44] going to raise up this young man
[55:47] Samuel praise the Lord amen and we see
[55:52] how God is dealing with
[55:54] him now all of these things is placed
[55:58] into into one or two verses in the Bible
[56:02] that it could look like the same night
[56:04] God spoke to him Eli said go and sleep
[56:07] then he he he come back again he say Eli
[56:09] did you call me Eli said go and sleep it
[56:12] could be a period of
[56:16] time it could be a period of time God is
[56:19] dealing with him
[56:26] praise the
[56:30] Lord maybe it is not a warm night and
[56:33] the reason why I'm saying it is because
[56:36] just like how those things took place in
[56:38] the Scripture it was their life their
[56:41] entire life was not in one
[56:44] day a man entire life could be explained
[56:47] in one
[56:49] chapter but it did not happen in one day
[56:52] right and that is the same same way with
[56:55] you and myself
[56:57] every day God is dealing with us one way
[57:01] or the other every day he's finding a
[57:04] new way to be able to get our
[57:09] attention every day he's finding a way
[57:12] to be able to amplify his voice to
[57:20] us my sheep hear my voice are they going
[57:24] to hear my voice is he going to grab
[57:26] what I'm trying to bring to him is she
[57:28] reading the Bible uh he's listening to a
[57:31] tape or listening to some kind of a
[57:33] gospel music or whatever it is are they
[57:36] hearing my voice he's trying to get our
[57:39] [Music]
[57:44] attention but you see because it's it's
[57:46] in such a
[57:48] speed it's in such a
[57:53] speed it's not traveling so the
[57:56] frequency of our our our our normal
[57:59] hearing our normal hearing
[58:01] frequency is traveling to the frequency
[58:05] of our
[58:08] soul praise the Lord amen are we
[58:12] together amen amen I I I I pray that U I
[58:17] pray you see it and you you understand
[58:20] it and appreciate it tonight praise the
[58:23] Lord amen because we talk in about the
[58:28] the positive and the negative negative
[58:30] effect of uh
[58:33] the the move of
[58:35] God praise the Lord I was I was uh kind
[58:39] of meditating on on these things and and
[58:42] I I I wrote some things down right after
[58:44] the service on Sunday I felt like the
[58:47] Lord uh uh like I said there was
[58:49] something I mentioned when I when I
[58:51] spoke about uh Lazarus you know uh uh
[58:55] coming from from the grave Jesus said
[58:57] Lazarus come forth and immediately he
[59:00] came forth and after being there 4 days
[59:05] is they did not took the B from on him
[59:08] take the ambulance and Rush him to the
[59:09] hospital put oxygen on him
[59:13] no he came forth his eyes were
[59:17] sharp his organs were all
[59:21] working praise the Lord
[59:25] am
[59:26] amen that is the effect of the move of
[59:29] God when when when Jesus spoke that
[59:32] voice that said let there be light was
[59:34] the same voice that said Lazarus come
[59:38] forth amen and when he came forth a move
[59:43] upon his entire body
[59:48] organs praise the
[59:50] Lorden if Lazarus was feeling pain when
[59:53] he died when he came forth there was no
[59:57] op when Lazarus was weak in his body
[1:00:00] when he died when he came forth he was
[1:00:03] strong in
[1:00:05] health that is the effect of the move of
[1:00:09] God for you to be healed God had to move
[1:00:14] upon your
[1:00:15] faith when Jesus
[1:00:18] said be heal according to your faith be
[1:00:21] it unto you according to your faith is
[1:00:24] because the the your faith that is in
[1:00:27] you has created an atmosphere for God to
[1:00:30] move upon
[1:00:36] it praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:00:39] it's not the sensation you don't have or
[1:00:42] shaking your no is not a
[1:00:46] sensation it's
[1:00:48] you is you believing in your heart that
[1:00:51] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:00:54] and forever
[1:00:56] that God is real amen he's not an anient
[1:01:00] God he's real I don't see him but he's
[1:01:03] here I know he's here as much as I know
[1:01:07] that there is birth in my body I know
[1:01:09] that God is here
[1:01:13] tonight praise the Lord
[1:01:17] amen are we
[1:01:20] together oh what a mighty God we Ser so
[1:01:23] I was I was dwelling on that thought I
[1:01:25] was just I was just uh uh thinking about
[1:01:29] it Sunday and and and I mean a whole a
[1:01:32] whole lot of things started coming to my
[1:01:34] mind talk about the woman with the blood
[1:01:38] issue amen this woman has gone how many
[1:01:42] years how many years 12 years praise the
[1:01:46] Lord 12 years with this
[1:01:49] illness and just by the
[1:01:54] touch praise the Lord and Jesus said vet
[1:01:59] you left
[1:02:02] me he said who touch me Peter said what
[1:02:05] are you talking
[1:02:07] about because he couldn't understand it
[1:02:10] he didn't see it it was not
[1:02:15] visible but the faith of the woman was
[1:02:18] able to draw H H intal power it was able
[1:02:21] to draw creative power from almighty God
[1:02:27] amen that affected her right there and
[1:02:39] there we are in an atmosphere of
[1:02:47] speed sometimes that's the reason why
[1:02:49] after the preaching of the word you
[1:02:51] might not remember
[1:02:53] anything but there is one thing that was
[1:02:55] will stick onto
[1:02:57] you because the because the Holy Ghost
[1:02:59] is going in such a speed and he just
[1:03:03] dropped that one down in your soul it
[1:03:05] became so real to
[1:03:10] you are we
[1:03:14] together you see that's the reason why
[1:03:16] we can't edicate ourself to
[1:03:19] God we cannot edicate ourself to God the
[1:03:24] one that we are dealing with his int
[1:03:25] tner
[1:03:26] amen he's not a god of time he's in
[1:03:30] tner and just like I said when God
[1:03:33] started moving when he came down from
[1:03:36] eternity and he dropped down to time
[1:03:38] when he started moving he have never
[1:03:40] stopped for nothing and he's not going
[1:03:44] to stop for
[1:03:47] anything
[1:03:50] amen when we prayed and said Lord Jesus
[1:03:53] come uh uh he comes and and he honor our
[1:03:57] faith and he moves amen God don't
[1:04:00] believe in adolat he don't want you to
[1:04:02] make an idol out of him he don't want
[1:04:04] you to set set him in a corner or put
[1:04:07] him on your living room table and say
[1:04:09] this is my God this is the thing that
[1:04:11] have healed me know he comes he bless
[1:04:13] you and then he move
[1:04:15] on thank you
[1:04:19] Lord and that's the reason why sometimes
[1:04:21] you can be on the H tuop you are
[1:04:23] revelated you are happy the next day you
[1:04:25] are
[1:04:26] aside because you just Dro down back to
[1:04:31] time praise the Lord don't let the devil
[1:04:34] tell you you have backslid it amen don't
[1:04:37] let the devil tell you you need to go
[1:04:39] and do some some more sacrifice and
[1:04:42] Penance unto God you need to repent
[1:04:44] maybe it's because of this or that don't
[1:04:45] let the devil lie to
[1:04:49] you we have been brought into so much
[1:04:52] reality of God amen amen amen that
[1:04:57] tradition we have been brought into so
[1:04:59] much reality of
[1:05:05] God are we
[1:05:08] together can you
[1:05:12] imagine Elijah on the mountain with all
[1:05:15] of those angels there it was not the
[1:05:18] time that Elijah said open the seven eye
[1:05:22] GES eye before the they were always
[1:05:24] there
[1:05:26] and just like they were on the mountain
[1:05:28] with Elijah they are here tonight he
[1:05:31] said I will never leave you I will never
[1:05:34] forsake you and if he's with you inures
[1:05:37] I come about
[1:05:42] you praise the Lord the Angels were
[1:05:45] there and Gesa was afraid the angels are
[1:05:49] there with you and you are
[1:05:51] afraid it's the same thing the Angels
[1:05:54] were there he was afraid amen and said
[1:05:57] Master the syrians are
[1:05:59] coming amen Master the bill is due
[1:06:03] master all this is happening Master but
[1:06:06] the angels are
[1:06:08] there it is just for your feet to rise
[1:06:12] and become conscious that Jesus promised
[1:06:15] me he will never leave me he will never
[1:06:17] forsake
[1:06:22] me I don't know where I am tonight but
[1:06:25] I'm feeling so
[1:06:31] good praise the
[1:06:34] lord we have made so much
[1:06:38] Idol look at the woman that wash Jesus
[1:06:45] feet he said the many
[1:06:49] sins your many sins are forgiven
[1:06:56] he never told her uh uh you know you got
[1:06:59] to go be baptized in the name of the
[1:07:00] Lord Jesus Christ and and and and uh uh
[1:07:03] you know you got to be faithful in
[1:07:05] paying your ties and and you know you
[1:07:08] got to he he never give her all of those
[1:07:10] things right there in
[1:07:14] then there was a
[1:07:17] connection when he spoke those
[1:07:20] words he breathed upon her that same
[1:07:24] breath of life that makes man a living
[1:07:26] Soul amen amen took away the desire amen
[1:07:30] amen amen amen praise the
[1:07:35] Lord just coming into that present she
[1:07:38] was so uh h h h h i mean she couldn't
[1:07:42] control
[1:07:47] herself until the the the the Fountain
[1:07:51] of her tears broke she had enough tears
[1:07:53] to wash his feet
[1:07:56] praise the Lord she threw her head over
[1:07:59] to WEP his feet she didn't care what
[1:08:02] people were saying she didn't care what
[1:08:04] they they thought about her she was in
[1:08:06] his
[1:08:11] presence praise the
[1:08:14] Lord he said Simon I came to your house
[1:08:18] you didn't receive me he said but this
[1:08:20] woman have not ceased to wash my feet
[1:08:22] and and WEP them and kiss my feet and
[1:08:25] all
[1:08:26] and I mean how many sins are
[1:08:29] forgiven now you see the church people
[1:08:31] sat there because they have their Church
[1:08:34] rituals of how sins supposed to be
[1:08:36] forgiven you're supposed to go and
[1:08:38] confess to the priest you got to go and
[1:08:40] do this thing they say who is he to say
[1:08:43] her sin is
[1:08:44] Forgiven he's
[1:08:47] blaspheming praise the Lord
[1:08:49] amen they were saying that in their
[1:08:52] heart and their mind but what that woman
[1:08:54] was experiencing
[1:08:56] was something that had never happened to
[1:08:58] her before she was she was experiencing
[1:09:01] a feeling like a newborn baby the stars
[1:09:04] were becoming more brighter the colors
[1:09:06] of the tree was becoming clearer the air
[1:09:09] that she was breathing was becoming more
[1:09:11] fresh than ever before because something
[1:09:14] has gone through
[1:09:18] her speed it happened so quick
[1:09:25] that's the reason why you you cannot you
[1:09:28] cannot condemn a man you cannot condemn
[1:09:30] a woman when a person walks out of the
[1:09:32] street and come into this church it is
[1:09:34] our responsibility to be able to create
[1:09:37] a positive and decent
[1:09:42] atmosphere we must be saying Lord thank
[1:09:45] you for that lady thank you for bringing
[1:09:47] her here oh God help her speak to her
[1:09:49] heart we might not be sitting down there
[1:09:51] and just being critical see how she
[1:09:52] dressed she I mean the church we have
[1:09:55] just become so
[1:10:00] bad we don't have courage to
[1:10:03] witness we don't have courage to do
[1:10:05] followup yet when God in his Mercy bring
[1:10:08] people our way we drive them out by our
[1:10:12] our religious
[1:10:15] attitude we drive them
[1:10:20] out what would you have done if you were
[1:10:23] there that day and those men took stones
[1:10:26] to Stone that woman that was caught in
[1:10:32] adultery if many of us were there we
[1:10:34] would Stone her
[1:10:43] too she was condemned by the word she
[1:10:46] was caught in the heart she was to be
[1:10:52] killed oh thank God thank
[1:10:56] God thank God she she she she she she
[1:11:00] recognized this man and fell at his feet
[1:11:03] thank
[1:11:07] God I just believe because she was a
[1:11:10] daughter of Abraham I believe because
[1:11:12] she was a seed of God God led her right
[1:11:14] into his
[1:11:17] presence why would we have
[1:11:22] done the people coming in our M we don't
[1:11:24] even know if they went if they slept in
[1:11:26] adultery and came to church we don't
[1:11:28] know
[1:11:29] that we just judge them by the way they
[1:11:32] dress we judge them by the way I mean
[1:11:34] that that just a wrong
[1:11:38] attitude we're not inviting people to
[1:11:40] church let not drive the one that the
[1:11:42] spirit of God is
[1:11:44] leading we should not drive them by our
[1:11:52] attitude I mean it will be encouraging
[1:11:55] to meet them after church oh God bless
[1:11:56] you thank you for coming thank you for
[1:11:59] coming we love to see you
[1:12:02] again we don't have the grace to do
[1:12:07] that we look them up and down up and
[1:12:10] down yet the next Sunday they come again
[1:12:12] and then we look at them up and down and
[1:12:13] up and down and yet the grace of God
[1:12:15] bring them
[1:12:20] again may God help us amen
[1:12:28] like that young lady I told you
[1:12:30] about spoke to her a few days
[1:12:35] ago uh she has become uh
[1:12:39] uh an air host with uh I think either
[1:12:43] Spirit Airline or some country she says
[1:12:46] uh she said pastor that's why you don't
[1:12:48] see me all the time I I was able to go
[1:12:50] to school and and now I'm working with
[1:12:52] this Airline and uh just busy trying to
[1:12:55] put my life
[1:12:59] together and I told
[1:13:02] her I said I'm proud of
[1:13:06] you because I mean there were there were
[1:13:08] some
[1:13:10] things that she told me about the kind
[1:13:12] of life that she was in and she was
[1:13:16] tired I mean she came from
[1:13:19] freakling I mean I guess there are a lot
[1:13:21] of churches on the
[1:13:22] road she said when I took my phone
[1:13:26] your address was the first address that
[1:13:28] came
[1:13:35] up praise the Lord amen now what am I
[1:13:39] getting to tonight just like how God
[1:13:43] did with the teeth on the cross the
[1:13:46] woman caught in
[1:13:49] adultery because she came into that
[1:13:52] presence and uh and and the power of God
[1:13:56] has taken sin away from her life Jesus
[1:13:58] said neither do I condemn thee because
[1:14:01] he couldn't see
[1:14:03] it God have forgiven her God have
[1:14:06] cleansed her he said neither do I
[1:14:08] condemn thee go and sin no more he was
[1:14:11] not advising her he was telling her what
[1:14:13] has happened to
[1:14:22] her and that's how those things
[1:14:25] happen so fast so
[1:14:30] quick and what I want to say what bring
[1:14:32] me to all of this tonight is to say this
[1:14:36] to
[1:14:37] you brother Dan preach the other the
[1:14:41] other day stumbling but here I come that

[1:14:49] beautiful I'm stumbling but I'm still
[1:14:52] coming
[1:14:56] that's a faith
[1:15:00] attitude and that's and that's what I
[1:15:03] want to say you know brother brandham
[1:15:04] said it was just like blind
[1:15:07] bimos someone told him he couldn't see
[1:15:11] it he first start say son of David have
[1:15:14] mercy on me son of David have mercy on
[1:15:17] me and he kept raising his
[1:15:22] voice and Jesus was on his
[1:15:26] road to be
[1:15:29] hanang praise the
[1:15:33] Lord he heard
[1:15:36] it he heard
[1:15:42] it blus couldn't
[1:15:45] see for perhap Jesus might have just
[1:15:47] turned and looked his way and make
[1:15:51] contact where is that child of Abraham
[1:15:54] that is calling me
[1:15:58] and it happened so
[1:16:01] quick and that is the thing that is
[1:16:03] going to happen for you and
[1:16:06] myself no matter what you are dealing
[1:16:11] with no matter what you are struggling
[1:16:16] with you had to hold to your
[1:16:20] vision you have to hold to your faith
[1:16:23] the little strength you have have to

[1:16:38] that he can lie praise the Lord you
[1:16:41] can't put God on the test I kept praying
[1:16:43] for this I keep praying for this and and
[1:16:45] and my life is not changing it's because
[1:16:47] you are looking at yourself and you are
[1:16:48] not looking at him
[1:16:58] just keep
[1:17:00] calling just keep
[1:17:03] calling Jesus said ask the father
[1:17:07] anything in my name amen do you realize
[1:17:11] that most of the time we prayed but we
[1:17:13] don't
[1:17:15] ask we don't ask we don't ask the father
[1:17:19] because in our mind he knows our needs
[1:17:23] he knows our condition we go through in
[1:17:26] Genesis you are the Sea of the woman in
[1:17:29] Exodus you are the blood on the door
[1:17:31] Post in Leviticus that's that's

[1:18:25] act seek and
[1:18:27] knock if you if you if if you put them
[1:18:30] together it is it's just the acronym of
[1:18:34] Acts a is asking s is seeking K is
[1:18:38] knocking
[1:18:47] ask are we
[1:18:49] together you see because because the
[1:18:52] hour that we are living in there there
[1:18:54] is just so much demon pressure on the
[1:18:58] word that church life like brother
[1:19:01] Brandon said is filling
[1:19:03] out praise the Lord Church Life is
[1:19:06] feding out it's going away from the
[1:19:09] hearts of the
[1:19:11] people that lukewarmness is
[1:19:18] creeping we are just beginning to wear
[1:19:20] this thing like a uniform I'm me a
[1:19:22] message I'm me a message I'm inan a
[1:19:23] message and we can come how many years
[1:19:25] we are in the message you see but h h i
[1:19:27] mean there there are certain reality
[1:19:29] that we need to hold to
[1:19:38] amen are we together let me read these
[1:19:41] few things to you I let you go tonight
[1:19:43] and then we continue by God's grace on
[1:19:45] Sunday if the Lord bless us praise the
[1:19:48] Lord listening to this brother brandom
[1:19:50] said in the sear Church age he said be
[1:19:53] thou faithful unto death this really
[1:19:55] blessed my heart he said be thou
[1:19:57] faithful unto death hold your
[1:20:01] testimony hold your testimony whatever
[1:20:04] you are believing God for hold it even
[1:20:07] on your death bed hold
[1:20:12] it say Lord I I I I did not see this in
[1:20:16] my lifetime but I believe you can do
[1:20:23] it be fa fful unto death he does not say
[1:20:27] be faithful until death just hold until
[1:20:30] you die no hold hold so
[1:20:33] strong that you will keep holding and
[1:20:35] you pass through death and on the other
[1:20:37] side you are still
[1:20:40] holy but unto death you may have to seal
[1:20:44] your testimony with your blood thousand
[1:20:47] yeah million have died during all the
[1:20:51] ages they die in a faith like antipa and
[1:20:55] faithful
[1:20:56] my faithful
[1:20:58] Witnesses and
[1:21:00] uh the the H not now their life dear
[1:21:06] unto death often we think that it will
[1:21:10] be almost impossible to be a m we think
[1:21:15] that you know we might never have to
[1:21:17] give our our life no that's not what
[1:21:20] makes
[1:21:23] you you you I am my child that's the
[1:21:25] reason why you give your life because
[1:21:27] the word just mean witness you are a
[1:21:29] witness they were Witnesses that's the
[1:21:32] reason why they die for their faith it's
[1:21:35] not their faith that makes them
[1:21:38] Witnesses are we
[1:21:41] together we we think that is
[1:21:43] impossible but there to recall that the
[1:21:46] faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[1:21:51] the faith that we daily use the faith
[1:21:55] that you use to wake up in the morning
[1:21:58] the faith you use to pass the pages of
[1:22:02] your Bible still believing that the word
[1:22:04] of God is truth still believing that you
[1:22:07] can read that book and God can speak to
[1:22:09] you that's right
[1:22:12] Amen to you it don't looks like
[1:22:15] anything but in heaven it's
[1:22:18] resounding it's sounding so loud in
[1:22:22] heaven why because when God looks in
[1:22:25] your neighborhood he don't hear the
[1:22:27] voices of prayer when he look in your
[1:22:30] neighborhood he sees the abuses he sees
[1:22:33] the drugs he see everything but when he
[1:22:35] looks down he sees a little Blain over
[1:22:38] your house amen he said there's a Son of
[1:22:41] God there there's a daughter of God
[1:22:43] there it man not looks like you are
[1:22:45] doing great things for the Lord but hold
[1:22:48] on to what you are doing and do it very
[1:22:50] well
[1:22:55] are we
[1:23:02] together but there to recall that the
[1:23:05] faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ
[1:23:08] Jesus is the same faith that uphold the
[1:23:13] polycaps and all the mares he says uh uh
[1:23:18] the Supreme faith will give Supreme
[1:23:21] Grace for the Supreme
[1:23:25] hour
[1:23:26] amen blessed be God
[1:23:32] forever when the need is there God will
[1:23:36] give you
[1:23:38] Supreme
[1:23:40] Grace in that need in that hour in that
[1:23:44] need he will give you the faith it might
[1:23:47] looks like you don't have fa you are
[1:23:49] weak the devil is blasting your mind
[1:23:51] with all sorts of discouraging things
[1:23:53] and and and and I mean you get mind
[1:23:55] battles and and and and and I mean you
[1:23:58] you you you you you cannot even get a
[1:24:01] can't even get a good you don't even
[1:24:02] have a good prayer
[1:24:05] life but start
[1:24:08] one praise the Lord amen start one hold
[1:24:13] on to
[1:24:16] it when it even looks like you are
[1:24:19] coming to church and I'm not getting
[1:24:20] nothing for from church keep coming
[1:24:25] God might just design one service only
[1:24:28] for you and that will change your life
[1:24:35] forever that's why we don't look at
[1:24:37] people misbehavior and make look at
[1:24:39] people
[1:24:40] misrepresentation and then we turn our
[1:24:42] back on the word you don't have a
[1:24:44] revelation you didn't not have a vision
[1:24:46] you were just following
[1:24:49] others but when you have a vision you
[1:24:51] hold to that Vision you don't allow
[1:24:54] other people to influence your vision
[1:24:56] that's right no the prophet said it
[1:24:59] might tar it but it will speak for
[1:25:03] itself are we together
[1:25:08] am you love the Lord
[1:25:13] tonight see what he says here power of
[1:25:15] transformation this will be the last
[1:25:17] code for tonight and then I I'll allow
[1:25:19] you go home now that's what I'm trying
[1:25:23] to warn you all about that's what I'm
[1:25:26] trying coming behind brother Brandon
[1:25:29] with this statement that's what I'm
[1:25:31] trying to warn you when you see God's
[1:25:35] seed begin to take hold and what is
[1:25:38] God's seed the word when you see that
[1:25:41] the word is beginning to take hold in
