[10:36] baptism oh my the resurrection that's
[10:39] why we are baptized because of he raised
[10:43] again I remember before we got our babst
[10:45] stre here I used to take them down on

[10:52] down there on the river there something
[10:55] about it that just it's a sacred time
[10:58] Easter it's a great time I was looking
[11:01] at brother Pat Tyler sitting over here
[11:04] was just talking to someone last night
[11:07] at our last meeting in Oklahoma I have
[11:11] tried to trying now and I announce this
[11:14] to lay aside until God would call me to
[11:17] do it my old Ministry of discernment
[11:21] because I think beginning it's the new
[11:23] ministry is coming in the other night no
[11:26] one knowing nothing about it tested on a
[11:28] CH
[11:29] coming across the platform had been born

[11:35] a 16y old boy and just immediately he
[11:38] let us scream out brother brandom I can
[11:40] see you in there and Pat was TI standing
[11:42] near right with the boy when his eyes
[11:45] come open for the first time in all of
[11:46] his life amen and so I trust that uh you
[11:51] here with great anticipations with
[11:53] myself I'm looking for something God to

[11:59] level than what we have let us bow our
[12:03] heads now for

[12:36] God's
[12:37] promises it confirmed them to us
[12:39] everything that he ever promised it was
[12:42] all made a reality on Easter one of the
[12:47] greatest days of celebrations that we
[12:49] can have in the year we would ask Lord
[12:53] the day that you will Comfort our hearts
[12:55] as we sit waiting and under
[12:59] anticipations for the Holy Spirit who
[13:03] came after Easter to come upon our

[14:15] scriptures Matthew
[14:18] 28 in the end of the Sabbath as it began
[14:22] to Dawn toward the first day of the week
[14:25] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[14:28] to see the Seiler and behold there was a
[14:31] great earthquake for the angel of the
[14:33] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[14:36] roll back the Stone from the door and
[14:39] sat upon it his countenance was like
[14:42] lightning and his rment white as snow
[14:46] and for fear of him the keepers did
[14:48] shake and became as dead men and the
[14:52] angel answered and said unto the women
[14:54] fear not ye for I know that you seek
[14:58] Jesus which was
[15:00] crucified he is not here for He Is Risen
[15:03] as he said come see the place where the
[15:06] Lord lay and go quickly and tell his
[15:10] disciples that he is risen from the dead
[15:13] and behold he goeth before you into
[15:16] Galilee there shall ye see him lo I have
[15:20] told you and they departed quickly from
[15:23] the separer with fear and great joy and
[15:27] did run to bring his disciples were and
[15:31] as they went to tell his disciples
[15:32] behold Jesus met them saying all
[15:37] hail and they came and held him by the
[15:40] feet and worshiped
[15:42] him then said Jesus unto them Be not
[15:47] Afraid go tell my brethren that they go
[15:50] into Galilee and there shall they see
[15:54] me now when they were going behold some
[15:57] of the watch came in into the City and
[16:00] showed unto the chief priests all the
[16:02] things that were done and when they were
[16:05] assembled with the elders and had taken
[16:08] counsel they gave large money unto the
[16:11] soldiers saying say ye his disciples
[16:15] came by night and stole him away while
[16:17] he
[16:18] slept and if this come to the governor's
[16:21] ears we will persuade him and secure him
[16:26] so they took the money and did as they
[16:28] were taught and this saying is commonly
[16:31] reported among the Jews until this day
[16:35] then the 11 disciples went away into
[16:37] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[16:39] appointed them and when they saw him
[16:42] they worshiped him but some
[16:45] doubted and Jesus came and spake unto
[16:48] them saying all power is given unto me
[16:52] in heaven and in Earth go ye therefore
[16:56] and teach All Nations baptizing them in
[17:00] the name of the father and of the son
[17:02] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[17:05] observe all things whatsoever I have
[17:08] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[17:12] Always even unto the end of the world
[17:18] Amen that His blessings to the reading
[17:21] of his
[17:22] word now we would uh say announce again
[17:27] now that the services and for the
[17:30] morning will continue on at 9:30 as soon
[17:33] as we are from the the this morning

[17:40] our sunrise

[17:44] things to report to you about the the
[17:46] meetings uh that's
[17:49] passed and we want you that's sick and
[17:52] Afflicted all of you to come with faith
[17:54] this morning to believe that this
[17:56] resurrected Jesus lives today amen and
[17:59] he's just the same that he ever was he
[18:01] hasn't changed a
[18:03] bit now I want to read a little portion
[18:07] of scripture here found in the 19th
[18:09] Chapter of job beginning with the 15th
[18:13] verse they that dwell in my house my
[18:18] Maids count me for a
[18:22] stranger I am an alien in their
[18:26] sight I call my servant and he gave me
[18:30] no
[18:32] answer I entreated him with my mouth my
[18:36] breath is strange to my wife though I
[18:39] treat for the children's sake of my own
[18:43] flesh yay young children despise me I
[18:48] arose and they spake against
[18:52] me all my inward friends of orb me and
[18:57] they who whom I love are turned against
[19:01] me my bones clave to my skin and to My
[19:07] Flesh and I am escaped with the skin of
[19:10] my teeth have pity on me have pity on me
[19:15] oh ye my friends for the hand of God has
[19:19] touched me why do you persecute me as
[19:23] God and are not satisfied with my flesh
[19:28] oh that my words now were written oh
[19:33] that they were pinned in a book that
[19:36] they were Graven with an iron pin and
[19:38] laid in the rock
[19:42] forever for I know my redeemer liveth
[19:46] and that he shall stand at the latter
[19:48] day upon the Earth though at the skin
[19:51] worms destroys this body yet in my flesh
[19:54] shall I see God whom I shall see for my
[19:58] self my eyes Shall Behold and not
[20:01] another though my reings be consumed
[20:05] within
[20:06] me I would like to take for a text there
[20:10] found in this job
[20:13] 19 I
[20:16] know the patriarch at this time was
[20:20] somewhat like we are
[20:24] today he had been in deep
[20:27] troubles
[20:29] as we call it high
[20:32] waters and he was desperate many days
[20:36] had set on the
[20:38] Asing and was trying to find words to
[20:41] console
[20:42] him trying to find something that would
[20:45] give him
[20:48] courage and something that would would
[20:52] be a comfort to him as he seen his life
[20:55] fading out of him
[20:58] first place he was an old
[21:00] man
[21:02] somewhat 90 years
[21:04] old and he has been stricken by the hand
[21:09] of
[21:10] God now we know that God had not touched
[21:13] him with his hand but that God had
[21:16] permitted Satan to touch
[21:18] him God only has agents to do
[21:23] things God wants an evil done he just
[21:25] turns Satan loose to do it and if he
[21:28] wants good done he has his servant he
[21:30] turns loose to do
[21:32] it and Satan had touched
[21:36] job for a purpose to
[21:39] try because he and God had had a
[21:44] debate and God told Satan that I've got
[21:47] a servant of the earth there's none
[21:50] Laing whatever I say to him he'll do it
[21:53] he's a perfect man and a just man Satan
[21:58] said if you'll just let me have him I'll
[22:00] make him curse you to your
[22:03] face job not knowing all these things
[22:06] going on it brought the patriarch into a
[22:11] deep
[22:13] distress yet somehow when all was gone
[22:17] from him he still maintained his
[22:20] position in in
[22:22] Christ I know my redeemer liveth he said
[22:26] amen now we come to those places we all
[22:31] come and I believe that today that we
[22:34] are together year for something like
[22:38] that same
[22:39] purpose we are all on the as sheeps we
[22:44] have our troubles and our ups and downs
[22:46] and our our bad moments and our
[22:51] sicknesses and our heartaches and our
[22:54] disappointments so we come like this of
[22:57] a mar morning uh this Easter morning to
[23:00] find words of comfort like job was
[23:04] trying to find from his friends amen and
[23:07] none of them could give him any
[23:10] consolation because of his trouble they
[23:12] were accusing him of being a secret
[23:16] sinner then in the midst of all that
[23:20] trouble God gave to his
[23:23] rescue
[23:25] amen job was questioning
[23:29] as he knew Not only was his sickness and
[23:32] his boils and trouble and heartaches
[23:36] from losing his family and all of his
[23:38] wealth were just about to take his life
[23:42] but he was an old
[23:44] man well stricken in years and knowing
[23:48] that he was going down to the
[23:51] grave and knowing that he believed that
[23:55] there was somebody who brought him on
[23:58] the
[23:59] earth he just couldn't come here by
[24:04] himself and he know that he come from a
[24:08] father and a mother but yet that father
[24:11] and mother had to have someone to bring
[24:13] them it would revolve on back to the
[24:16] original who brought the first one and
[24:20] then he wondered this it's a strange
[24:23] thing that here I am walking around the
[24:26] higher life than what the animal is and
[24:29] the high life and the plant life but yet
[24:33] we find that he said if the tree dies
[24:37] it'll live
[24:38] again and if a a flower dies it'll live
[24:43] again but he said man layeth down he
[24:47] giveth up The Ghost and where is he his
[24:50] sons come to mourn over him and to do
[24:53] honor and he perceives it not and and he
[24:58] was wondering what was the matter that
[25:00] that God would let life like that live
[25:03] again such as flowers and
[25:06] plants but a man could not live again
[25:09] all this had him
[25:12] trouble and if we will just draw from
[25:17] this conclusion this
[25:20] morning and that's what we're here
[25:23] for amen we've heard the Easter Story
[25:26] over and over and read it back and forth
[25:30] and today on your radio broadcast you'll
[25:33] your different ministers approaching it
[25:36] but what I thought for my little group
[25:39] this morning the Lord has given me I
[25:41] would approach it from a different
[25:42] standpoint if I could amen coming to a
[25:46] place of why do we come to these
[25:49] troubles what makes these things come
[25:54] why should a Christian ever be perple
[25:58] Le why wouldn't not everything just run
[26:02] perfect for a Christian but it
[26:05] doesn't and we know it in sometimes we
[26:08] have more troubles when we become a
[26:11] Christian than we did when we were
[26:14] Sinners of course it is written many is
[26:18] the afflictions of the righteous but God
[26:21] deliver him from them
[26:24] all thank the Lord come from PR many
[26:29] afflictions strange feelings and strange
[26:33] things that would be beyond our
[26:37] understanding but it's always done for
[26:40] our good amen just can't understand it
[26:45] because if we did then it would not be a
[26:48] faith to us we would go with an
[26:51] understanding but we do it and we have
[26:55] it and we believe by Faith his word that
[26:59] it's going to work some good thing for
[27:01] us
[27:04] amen if we could grasp that today on
[27:08] this this morning if we could grasp at
[27:12] all of our
[27:13] troubles and there's none of us immune
[27:16] from them and if we could realize that
[27:19] those things are for our
[27:22] good it is written in one of the
[27:26] scriptures in the Bible that trials are
[27:31] brought up on us are more precious to us
[27:34] than gold
[27:37] amen for it is God giving us these
[27:40] trials yes after we become his property
[27:44] our confession and our baptism and our
[27:47] promise to walk in life for him then
[27:50] every trial that comes upon on us is to
[27:54] perfect us for his glory amen am is to
[27:59] bring us to a place where God can make
[28:01] himself more real to us than he was
[28:04] before the trial come amen I want to
[28:08] join in this morning with job to say
[28:10] that I've lived long enough to know
[28:12] that's the truth amen I have seen it in
[28:15] my own life that every time a great
[28:20] situation Rises that I can't get around
[28:22] it or under or over it God makes a way
[28:26] and comes out glorious I just wonder how
[28:30] his grace ever does it but he does
[28:33] it and remembering all these things
[28:37] Satan tries to make us
[28:39] nervous upset us to get us to think oh
[28:42] why did this happened why couldn't I
[28:44] have been like
[28:47] this a few days ago when I come out of
[28:50] the most prettiest and most gorgeous
[28:55] place I ever saw in all my
[28:58] life it was the great building of our
[29:03] brother or
[29:04] Roberts when I've seen that solid Marvel
[29:08] not a window in it nowhere but how it
[29:11] was fixed I've been in Hollywood and
[29:15] I've been in King's palaces and I been
[29:17] in everywhere could be hardly around the
[29:20] world and all the swinky lovely places
[29:23] and hom that I never seen anything any
[29:26] place to compare with it no where at all
[29:29] all the little aluminum wires weave the
[29:33] the inside together and all I have never
[29:36] seen anything so gorgeous in all my life
[29:40] when I walk through there and tuck my
[29:42] hands and rub
[29:44] those pole pilasters and and the great
[29:47] Granite all in the form of a trinity of
[29:50] the Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[29:53] carvings of it all those things I just
[29:57] come from Brother Tommy osbor and seen
[29:59] his Great Mighty uh work there for the
[30:03] Lord I stood on the outside look back at
[30:06] that building and I thought God surely I
[30:10] have become a hypocrite surely I have
[30:13] become an outcast somewhere for these
[30:16] men's Ministries come off of
[30:19] mine and I what maybe I am so untrusted
[30:24] Lord that you couldn't trust me with
[30:26] anything like like that even the little
[30:28] few dollars that you let me pay for the
[30:30] campaigns and things now they're trying
[30:32] to send me to the penitentiary F why am
[30:35] I such a hypocrite or why am I such an
[30:38] untrusted person I was on the ash Heap
[30:42] Jo was of old when I stood outside there
[30:45] with just couldn't hardly get my breath
[30:47] from such Majesty that a poor boy BN in
[30:51] a Dugout a Pentecostal could do and
[30:54] bring that into that great mammoth
[30:57] building and I thought oh God maybe I am
[31:01] not worthy just then a little voice came
[31:05] down through those quarters said but I
[31:08] am your potion and I oh Lord God
[31:14] hallelujah oh I just let that stay that
[31:17] way then
[31:19] Lord because I wouldn't have the
[31:21] intelligence to carry on a great work
[31:23] like that for you and I am an illiterate
[31:27] person but as long as you are my potion
[31:31] I am yours and you will lead me am I can
[31:35] notot lead myself but oh Lord lead me
[31:40] it's those crucial hours that press us
[31:43] on to those sacred
[31:45] Sands yeah it was in the Bible and
[31:49] remember no matter how great the
[31:51] distresses Satan cannot take your life
[31:55] until God has finished with you amen
[31:59] there is nothing can happen to you
[32:01] unless God permits it there is no evil
[32:04] can come unless God permits it and it's
[32:06] for your good he's working let's think
[32:11] there when the floods came to destroy
[32:14] the world it could not destroy Noah amen
[32:19] Noah could not be
[32:20] destroyed because it God had a work for
[32:24] him to do amen one day down in a great
[32:29] Nation Under a great bondage there was
[32:32] some Hebrew children that we know as
[32:35] Shadrach and mesach and
[32:37] abedo and it came to a place where they
[32:40] had to make a
[32:42] decision that something had to be done
[32:45] they had to their their faith was put to
[32:48] a test
[32:51] amen and when their faith is put to a
[32:53] test then don't fail stay right with
[32:56] what you believe
[32:58] and when their faith faith was put to a
[33:01] test and they went to a crucial hour not
[33:05] only did they go to a a a sheep but they
[33:08] went into a fiery furnace but Satan
[33:12] could not destroy them for God's purpose
[33:16] wasn't yet
[33:18] fulfilled they could go in there with
[33:20] this hope I know my redeemer liveth they
[33:25] could go in there with this hope here we
[33:27] are assured that God is able to Deliver
[33:31] Us from this fiery furnace but
[33:33] nevertheless we will not bow to the
[33:35] image amen praise the name of Lord Satan
[33:39] could not take them he canot drown Noah
[33:41] in the flood until the purpose of God
[33:44] had been finished Hallelujah he could
[33:46] not burn up the Hebrew children until
[33:49] the purpose of God had been finished
[33:52] Hallelujah he could not kill job with
[33:55] balls and trouble until the purpose of
[33:58] God had been finished praise the Lord
[34:02] neither could the lions eat Daniel until
[34:04] God's purpose had been finished amen
[34:08] neither could death in old age take
[34:10] Abraham amen until the purpose of God
[34:14] had been finished Hallelujah and neither
[34:17] can it take you amen or can it take me
[34:21] Hallelujah until the purpose of God of
[34:24] our life is
[34:25] finished
[34:27] so we gather from their
[34:29] consolation and why does God let
[34:32] troubles come God harness his trouble
[34:36] puts bits in its mouth amen and makes it
[34:39] obey him amen those troubles bring us
[34:43] into a closer fellowship with god oh
[34:46] amen praise the Lord there had been no
[34:49] rainbow until the flood came but after
[34:54] Noah was pressed into that condition
[34:57] that he was in the float 40 days and
[34:59] nights in a storm in the little Ark
[35:01] pitching up and down in the water it was
[35:03] after the flood was over that he saw the
[35:07] rainbow for its first time amen the
[35:10] Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise
[35:14] after he had went through the
[35:15] tribulation then he saw the promise
[35:19] hallelujah amen that's way you see the
[35:21] Promise after you've gone through the
[35:25] tribulation I like that poem or song
[35:29] must I be carried home to heaven on a
[35:33] flowerly bed of ease While others fought
[35:36] to win the prize and sail through bloody
[35:39] Seas Hallelujah we ask for comfort and
[35:42] peace God gives us the best he could
[35:45] give us trials and tribulations
[35:48] amen that's better than comfort in peace
[35:51] oh amen our Comforts is just beyond the
[35:54] river
[35:55] Hallelujah
