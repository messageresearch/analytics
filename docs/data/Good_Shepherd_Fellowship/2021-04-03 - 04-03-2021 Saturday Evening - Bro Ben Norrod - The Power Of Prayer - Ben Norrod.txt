yes jesus yes i appreciate the lord today yes god bless you may be seated this evening we so appreciate amen the worship of the lord and all the good singing all the good music it's certainly been wonderful to be here in the house of god and i appreciate the anointing that we feel and the presence of god that we feel knowing that according to the bible and according to the scripture that has been recorded us many years ago where two and three are gathered he promised to be right here and i believe that i believe he's here right now this very moment i believe the lord jesus is right here in the house and i've got confidence i want to tell you something i've got confidence that not only does he love us not only does he concern for us not only does he watch over every detail in our lives but he is interested in the affairs of your life right now yes right now he is interested in you that's right yeah doesn't matter whether you're older younger no matter what your age is no matter how long you've been in the truth well i i've just come in well it don't matter to jesus he is interested in those that are interested in him i've been saying this for a little while now i told somebody the other day i said you know people have got in their mind that they want to get the attention of the lord that what they should do is be the worst boy and the worst girl they can possibly be they think maybe that if i'm bad enough maybe i'll get god's attention and i made a statement to somebody i said look i said really according to what brother bram taught us if you want to get god's attention he told us about it in a message called he cares do you care if you want to get god's attention just show him that you care about the things of god show him you care about the word show him you care about the people of god about church about loving one another amen hallelujah just show that heart and watch and see if the lord don't reciprocate right back around come right back around that and start answering back the more you show your concern watch and see if he don't show it right back amen isn't that wonderful amen we love the lord all right we want to invite samantha to come if she will and we're going to sing a little bit and get right into the preaching of the word of the lord amen we appreciate all that good singing and and uh sam and i've done decided if our suitcases are big enough they ain't we're gonna get one and big enough to put him in it take us with him take us with him you know and amen and go on about our business we we need that on the road brother i like that i like that good fiery singing like that and um you know many some years ago when i first made my my first trip over to ghana there was something about the people there the country something about the trip going over that direction it just seemed like it just was so so very special to me and uh you know now you may not know it if you're not familiar with ghana now some of you may be some you may not be but uh there's a little sound in the voice of a ghanaian singing and i can close my eyes and pick out what country they're from it don't matter amen amen no matter how tall or skinny or whatever they might be i can pick that sound that oh that sounds so good to me i just love that and it made me think of the great meetings we had out there in that country like that and so appreciate the lord and appreciate all that god does for his children everywhere and you know it's uh nice to meet people of different walks of life and their little nuances and different ways and oddities and things like that it just makes it that much more special you know i never will forget the first time i went to nicaragua and it was in central america if you don't know where nicaragua was at and uh entering into the country i've never seen people worship like this they all stood to their feet they gripped the front of the bench they cocked their heads sideways like this closed their eyes and sang in worship all of them did just the same thing and i remember looking at that thinking how unique that was and how different that was and it just seemed like it made such a deep impression on me and then i went to another place you know and it kind of more of a german type way you know anything about the germans are real you know like everything's just exactly you know cut the corner and everything's just so so and when they stand they stand like one people you know they're standing they stand like one person and uh and i never forget their worship just very organized amen i thought i thought well you know that but that was their way then i read brother branham say that god is a god of variety he has white flowers black flowers green flowers purple flowers he said he loves big hills small hills and different things he said he likes it that way amen i like that i like that so we appreciate the lord appreciate all that you've done in the meeting thus far to put your little licks of fire forward and it really means a lot to us and i want to extend a special thank you to the carlins they opened their home to us this weekend now we didn't stay because i had several things going that i needed the requirement of the room and i just want to thank brother scott and sister publicly for opening your home to us we love you is so very much and that meant a lot to us brother sister i agree i agree next time it'll be a repentance that's right amen that's right and i want to say how much i appreciate brother juan for inviting us over and uh to have the opportunity to come stand with you like this has been a real privilege for me and i appreciate the lord allowing us to be able to come together like that so thank you brother and sister and you church body for receiving us and we uh we trust you've been blessed thus far and looking forward to more of what the lord will have for us tonight and tomorrow morning don't forget now friends we are in the season of celebration our savior is not dead he is alive forevermore don't let a moment pass you tomorrow the moment your eyes come open don't stop for a second to do anything else before you raise your hands and thank him for his easter egg don't forget it i understand the only reason that you're alive and going like you are today and that you love him and you serve him is because of his easter because of that resurrection that's why we're here like we are today amen we love the lord so so very much all right you're so nice to talk to i could continue this on for hours but uh we're going to sing a little bit i just wanted to talk to you just a minute i didn't get too much of a chance yesterday and i wanted to stop and say a few words and ask you to pray for me as well we um i've got several things course with the borders shut up like they are um i usually do maybe three or four mission trips a year but this year there's going to be a lot of things coming virtually and i have a convention coming the lord willing is going to be on the internet going into central south america mexico and many of those places and i understand it is a collection of somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 000 people they're going to be gathering in their churches different groups and sizes and i'll be preaching over the internet as one of the keynote speakers for that great convention down there and uh then we have another one coming up an international convention we're a part of in ottawa this year and uh so and a few more just like that and then the lord willing in june it is possible kind of working on things praying about maybe how we can arrange it we might return to egypt this year there's a new church burgeoning there and growing and uh brother jason to mars if you know jason at all i know he's a fellow minnesotan amen and uh brother jason has invited me to try to go back with him this year so if you would please pray for those needs and pray for those meetings like that and also the travels that we have around the parts of the united states now somebody asked me today did i work well i do little things on the side but i've been a full-time preacher for 17 years and uh and i and now that i said the worst thing the devil could have done back in february was give me antibodies amen because i've blown the schedule up and i'm right back out there just as hard as i can go and uh so we we trust the lord now if i get close to you and i got no mask on or something like that don't be nervous i'm vaccinated amen i i'm right to my eyeballs with antibodies all the way but we um uh want you to pray about those things if you would that the lord would help us in it now that's not a solicitation for money now but i i want your prayers that the lord help us and uh somebody asked me here not too long ago brother ben i don't know how in the world you do it and i got to think and i thought well how long have i went what have i done and all that and i counted up an average of the miles already 17 years two over over two million miles for the lord that's just on the ground traveling on the in the vans and things like that it's not even counting in the air and what we've done overseas and traveling in places like that 2 million miles in 17 years and i thought no wonder i feel beat up like an old rickety car but you know somebody asked me well how do you do it like that it's the prayers of the people of god and me coming to little churches like this and asking you to pray i know that's what keeps us going and keeps us put one foot in front of the other so will you pray for us will you raise your hand if you will god bless you thank you for that amen now what i've done is i took a snapshot in my brain and when the devil tells me nobody cares i'm going to call that picture back up to him praise the lord [Music] on the button hold it to the screen [Music] it's my desire to live for jesus it's my desire to live just for him though i feel brought him so much shame still it's my desire to if you could see where jesus brought me from to where i am today then you would know the reason why i [Music] i don't need earth's power it's my desire to [Music] to help someone today someone who may have failed to see yeah come on tell us about it way to god and now it's my desire to live for him to live for him if you could see where jesus brought me from then you would know the reason why i love him [Music] i don't need earth's power it's my desire to live for him [Music] i don't need [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] yes sir praise hello thank you jesus oh blessed be the holy name jesus the more that i trust him the more that i love him nothing good for me he'll deny the longer i know him the better i could show him i wouldn't stop now if i

stand together this evening and get right into the word of the lord oh thank you jesus isn't god wonderful isn't he good amen don't you just enjoy being a christian amen full of the power of god amen i'll tell you what brother no matter how much you might say in this message oh we're beyond all them things we are not beyond them things like that i believe a real child of god is called to worship god believe that with all of my heart amen we appreciate the lord tonight amen mark chapter 11 verse 22 am i all right where'd you go hallelujah mark 11 22. i want to speak to you this evening on the power of prayer power of prayer we need it thank you love the lord brother if you will bring these monitors up real hot for me if you don't mind amen appreciate the lord a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more mark 11 and 22 beautiful and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe those things which he saith shall come to pass you shall have whatsoever he saith amen therefore i say unto you yes always remember who's doing the talking [Music] i say unto you whatsoever things you desire what things that you desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen amen let's pray together heavenly father what a privilege it is lord to be gathered here in this great gathering of people lord this easter weekend father as we have opened up the bible now and we're asking that not only has we opened it up by our hands taking the pages and rolling them back but lord jesus may you come tonight and open thy word to our hearts lord it be more than just the pages of a book turning but lord it would be revelation by the spirit of god we pray that you'll come into this place tonight and anoint me as your servant lord as your son standing here i am under authority of the spirit of god to speak by thy name all things that thou has have me speak tonight lord as they set there is the people of god their hearts are open they are duty bound by the holy spirit to stay faithful hallelujah to every word that comes out of the mouth of god so anoint us together tonight lord that we might be benefited by this gathering together don't let it be a protractive meeting first lord don't let it be just something we come together for the sake of coming let us change walk out of here change people order different in some way lord do something in our lives to help us draw closer to you we pray forgive us o god of our shortcomings lord before i even preach this message i already know lord there'll be little places in our lives about prayer and things that we all know we lack in but lord we're not looking at that lack tonight we don't want to focus there but we want you to come and help us know how to build ourself up to be a better christian so we commit this to you now for all things in the name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen and amen god bless you may be seated may the lord bless you real real good amen appreciate the lord and appreciate god's grace and uh so appreciate all these musicians tonight and all this good singing you know i could go on like this all night i really could i enjoy it but you know the holy spirit has constrained us that when we come in we are to read his bible and to talk about the things of god because the scripture teaches us that it is by the preaching of the gospel that we are edified and we are benefited by the holy spirit as we know the holy spirit uses the fivefold ministry to edify the body of jesus christ of which i believe i'm a part of and i believe you're a part of if we've got the spirit of god we are his the bible said they that don't have the spirit they're none of his but i believe if i've got the holy ghost then i am his beloved child and i believe that his grace and his mercy not only rests upon me as a believer but i believe that my experience with him and the experience that he's placed inside of my heart gives me a direct connection to his mind his thoughts his intentions and all that is in the mind and the heart of god because you realize the word is a discerner of our thoughts and our intents but don't forget it did not say that it was just the discerner of a heart but the hearts the word in us also discerns the heart of god his intention his desire his thoughts and when we receive the word inside of us we can discern what god intends for us we can discern god's thinking about his bible we can discern what god feels about certain matters in our life and how does that happen by the avenue of prayer and i want to read to you just a a statement i think will help us set the tone for the rest of the evening this is out of expectation and brother brahman said what man calls great god calls foolish and what man calls foolish god calls great that's about right isn't it amen he said so what we've got to do is get back into the program of god and find out what god wants us to do and the only way i know to do it is by prayer prayer is the key prayer is the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb there's no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer praise the lord prayer will even change the mind of god now looking at this particular remark it really gets us in a condition of understanding that the lord jesus wants us to have a key to all of the doors of god you know brother branham taught us that in certain things in life that there is a a key that must be given to an individual to open up certain uh you know certain things for example in music the prophet taught us that you know he said i think it was sarah i do believe he said could set down and with music on the piano and things could do a whole lot more than becky with all of the lessons that she'd taken because he said sarah was gifted whereas becky was just learning it by the notes and he talked about mathematics he said there's a key to mathematics that when a person goes to look into a math problem there's a certain understanding that comes to those that have the key of mathematics that they can take one look at the problem and tell you where it's hidden now my mother-in-law my my uh my wife's mother is a genius mathematician and uh matter of fact she was a part of a school at one time a college at one time that there was only about three or four people in the world that was able to do the high mathematics that she was in and she can take any kind of problem and i'm not kidding you when i say you could take that side wall and go from one end to the other and put the most complicated math problem up there and she can go step by step by step by step by step and tell you what the answer's gonna be down at the end of the road i can't even tie my shoes without getting confused amen amen but this woman she understands because there's been a key placed into her life to where she can look into mathematics and unlock it now we know that there are other keys like that certain people there's a brother here tonight that was sharing with us the other day that he has an engineering mind and of course you know when he looks at things engineering and that way you know he sees maybe the construction or the arrangement of how maybe a motor or an engine or something should behave and how it should be designed amen and he's got the engineering mind and my brother-in-law rodney wants to bite him amen he hates an engineer because he said they always stand on the outside of the car when he's the one's got to work in it amen amen and they put things in places he said he don't think it should go amen amen but yet he's the type of man when he looks at a car he can listen at the sound of it tick tick ticking and tell you what valve it is and what plug it was and amen where the wire might be going faulty and me i can stand there and look at a few things like that but i don't really have the key necessarily like some of them have got and they can take that key and put it in the lock as it were and they can open up the mystery of what it is they're looking at now we understand that not only is the bible god's mystery and is the bible a mysterious thing to you and i but we understand that the mystery of god had to be unlocked only by the holy spirit remember in the last day it was not william branham that opened up the seals it was not brother branham that claimed the book and took the book it was not brother branham that had the understanding of what the real mystery of all this was remember the prophet of god himself in june of 1956 i believe it is in dallas fort worth texas and he says now he takes revelation 6 1 the white horse rider he said now i want to preach tonight my subject being the white horse rider the great mighty conqueror jesus christ now he's taking a text about the devil and then calling it god amen now people get critical of that but it's not nothing to be critical of brother branham was a man that had not been given the key to understand how those things fit together and you cannot unlock a door that you don't have a key for amen and remember if you try to kick it open jesus said you're a thief and a robber only he that comes in must come by the door amen you can't just force yourself into this thing amen you cannot force yourself to have a revelation you cannot force yourself to see the godhead you cannot force yourself to see these other things it must come by revelation of the holy spirit and revelation comes by prayer amen by prayer now i want you to listen to this about the powerful weapon of prayer again listen to this he said prayer is the most powerful weapon that has ever been put in the control of human beings so there again it is a weapon that has been given to you and i it is a weapon against the forces of evil of this last state now just think for a moment if you had the bible in front of you and you had enough intelligence to be able to put things together in other words you could understand maybe two plus two equals four scripturally speaking maybe you could look at a certain doctrine or a certain mystery of god and maybe by just your mind you could start putting things together and you could start working things in a direction that maybe you would understand serpent seed or even water baptism remember the prophet said it don't even take a revelation to understand water baptism that's just a matter of reading it in the bible he said be baptized in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost it don't take a revelation to read that the name is the name is the name is the name that's easy amen but a person could put all of that together have all of that understanding placed together and look right at the bible and say all right it means this it means this it means this and it means this but do you realize my precious friend that if you even got that deep in the scripture unless the lord jesus gives you the key of the revelation of the spirit to understand the mystery that is behind what you figured out you are still looking at a closed door that makes no sense to you how many people have we seen get baptized go down in the water a dry center come up a wet one why doesn't water baptism put them in a condition to where they receive the holy ghost because they never had an understanding of what it was they were really doing that's right amen when you go down in the water the real revelation of being baptized immersed in water baptism has nothing to do with you getting wet it has nothing to do with you just having a name called over you at baptism but it is a symbol and a representation of the death and the burial and the resurrection of jesus christ somebody said brother being is dead i said yes he is as i was there when they buried him hallelujah amen i know that the revelation of what takes place when i go underneath that water and that preacher said i baptize you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin amen my revelation is is that the old man is dead and i'm coming out of there a brand new creature in christ jesus amen but if a person goes down and they've just simply figured it out by their own understanding it's a locked door to them they never received the holy ghost and then we'll tell them as preachers but the bible said well that's true the bible did say it but if you have don't have a key to the door all you do is reading the name plate on the outside amen i can stand right here in this building this is my second time in this place here and and i don't know what this door is right here this could be the door to another closet for all i know now don't tell me what it is because i don't want to know just yet amen it could be a door to a music room you might go back in there and pray it might be the door straight outside i don't know all i can do is stand right here and look on the outside and stand there and guess as to what it is i see an exit sign but how do i know that that's not an old sign how do i know that that's not put there as a dummy exit to entice robbers to get stuck in a room so you can call the law on him hey man come on now stay with me a little while what i'm trying to tell you brother is as long as i'm standing on the outside i am only surmising i am only guessing i am only putting a theory together of what i think it might be amen it ain't the first time that people would be deceived by such things it won't be the last time people are deceived by such things but there is a difference in my revelation if i once go inside that door hallelujah and i walk through that door and step on the outside or wherever it may lead to then i can stand from the outside in and say i know what it means i'm getting ready to say something you message people buckle up one of the biggest problems we've had in the ranks of this message for 60 years is we've got a lot of people standing with a fistful of quotes and scriptures outside the door that don't understand what this message really means the shame of it is those are the ones that the world takes for the experts as to what this truth really means don't talk to them once on the outside don't talk to them ones that don't have no key don't talk to the man amen that doesn't understand the baptism of the holy ghost don't talk to the boy or the girl that has no experience with jesus christ they're just going to stand outside the door and argue with what the real meaning is talk to somebody that's been there come on now talk to somebody that's went behind the door that's got a personal revelation of jesus christ and understands what it means praise be to god it's easy for us to stand outside here and argue many a minister meeting has occurred outside doors they'll take the revelation of the seal well let's understand it as preachers sure you can understand it but if you've got a revelation it's more than just saying whether brethren said brother i'm set brother i'm set brother braham said brother iran said but i'm said the bible said the bible said the bible said the bible said well i can stand right here my scott do the same thing exit exit exit exit jesus said paul said the bible said what do you say come on come on somebody i can sit right there and quote help me somebody but if i've never been behind there i don't understand the real mystery of it [Music] praise be to god that's the reason brother we need revelation by the spirit of god not by our own understanding of what we think we can figure out because i got news for you the word of god is designed in such a manner that the smartest human being cannot unravel its mystery the devil is a smart creature and he probed and probed and probed and probed and probed and never understood not even a third of the things that come before him that's right god knows how to keep things so confusing for the devil that's why he don't know how to whip you because he keeps things so mixed up with you all the time you don't know whether you're up or down or which way you're going amen god keeps the mystery of your life a total secret to the devil [Applause] i said some time ago on an interview with a young person from newfoundland it was asking about you know these husbands and wives around the message that beat their wives and their children and women that carry on do evil things i said don't talk to them as an example of this truth talk to me i've been married 23 years my wife and i we have fought like cats and dogs but we've done it in a godly way [Music] i mean at the end of the day we love each other no matter how much we might go through hard times no matter how much we might disagree about things but we love one another hallelujah we stand right there don't talk to this guy out there that can't be faithful for not even five minutes to his wife or vice versa to her husband talk to somebody that's been there if you're sitting here tonight and you need the baptism of the holy ghost don't talk to that smoshback church member that ain't never had an ounce of joy in their life go talk to the real believer [Applause] praise god talk to the one that knows a little bit about it [Music] because as g.i joe said when i was a boy knowing is half the battle because if you have an understanding of things nobody can change your mind if i walk back behind this door back here man this particular church there might be many doors that you go back maybe not even know what's behind them but if i've been had the experience and went back there and i know what's back behind there let's say there's a stack of boxes back there seven boxes and they're all stacked up on each other and maybe they're stacked on top of each other rather than on the floor side by side they're stacked up in the toward the ceiling it don't matter to me how much comes along and tries to take a bunch of quotes and scriptures and tell me it's this way i've been there and by being there i know myself as a matter of fact i i'm in such a place once i get there i don't even need you to tell me what it is [Laughter] preach by the bill right i don't need anybody to explain to me what it means that's why it is a personal relationship this is not a you and the preacher and the deacon and the church this is you and jesus christ one on one hallelujah once a man or woman has that experience thank you jesus nobody can talk them out of it you take some of these boys that's been in war and they go over and they experience vietnam i had three uncles in vietnam my uncle willard ran off the back of a c-130 shooting his gun because they had to roll off the back of that plane they couldn't stop they'd kill every one of them on there to roll out the back of a plane and find himself in the bush somewhere to save his own life i had my uncle ray would work on the f8 phantoms he stayed in the navy might have uncle carl who was an army man and sometimes they'll do these little documentaries and things on the vietnam war that's oh was this where it was that way it was some other way or this is what happened that what happened oh yeah they've got their opinions but just talk to my uncle willard one time talk to him ask him what he saw when he was when he was rolling off the back of that plane and trying to find cover in the bush ask him about it whether it was this or that or the other you see a man a woman that has been there and they understand it it doesn't matter how great the broadcast might be or how much people might believe the other version they've been there they've experienced something now i'm going somewhere with all of this i hope you'll follow me along just just hook up to the buggy and come on go with me [Music] right this is a a weapon of understanding prayer is a weapon of revelation if you are to understand the mystery of you did you know that the real mystery of god is the mystery of a person when you hold your bible there in front of you in your mind you might think what's the mystery of a book no it's not the book is a person the book of ruth is not just words we read ruth was an actual person when we read about daniel hosea micah jonah nahim those were people so the bible is a mystery of human lives it is the mystery of the greatest life the life of the lord jesus our god is not a doctrine he is a person [Applause] and they that worship this person must worship him in spirit and truth now we say that truth oh yes the message it meant no no that truth is an understanding that god has made known to you he's let you with the key go back behind the door and you understand a truth do you understand that's the reason why sometimes counseling husbands and wives i always watch both of them real carefully because i can add my opinion about what kind of person i think they are but she's lived with him he's lived with her and there is a truth that they share that nobody else knows glory to god many people can say what they want about the bible but there is a truth that my lord and i share [Music] they can say what they want to about me but there is a truth that i share with him [Music] he knows me he knows me in a way that nobody else [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory be to god friends i want you to understand in this age we live in people get so suicidal they get so down they get so depressed they want to end their lives because of the opinion that somebody else holds over them but if you'll just spend time finding out lord what do you think about me [Music] [Applause] have you ever stopped to ask him lord what is your opinion about me what do you believe about me do you believe that i'm a christian you understand that when you receive the holy ghost it's not when you receive it it's when god receives you go back and look at it in future home future home 82 64 brother brad who said it's not when you receive the holy ghost it's when the holy ghost receives you we walk around i'm a believer i'm a believer i'm a believer all right but did we ever stop to say lord do you believe that about me do you believe that i am a believer because if god don't believe i'm a believer i'm in bad shape somebody's going to preach a minute and out of hope he knows the very the inside parts of us he knows those elements of our life that is so intimate so secret what david said my secret parts and all of us have them brother bam called him a door to private life and all doors need keys you realize that's what makes a man a real pastor for you because god gives that man the key to the mystery of you and you can tell him all you want that you're a believer that you've got victory that you're this that a real pastor knows whether you're right or not they do they can look into the mystery of your life and god will let them know whether you're on the level or not and that man may never say nothing about it he may never indicate to you in any way whatsoever that he disagrees with your testimony but if he's got the key to your life he knows about you that's how he knows how to preach that's understands how he understands how to feed the flock because if god ever give him the key to your heart he understands how to unfold that word to affect you oh you say brother ben that scares me it shouldn't should make you rejoice it shouldn't make you rejoice that god cared enough about you to give godly men insight into how to help you and lead you and direct you oh i know in this lady of sea and age we don't want people directing us but we need leadership i mean we need true godly leadership [Music] amen right hey brother i've seen enough slickers in my lifetime i can smell them coming down the hallway i've seen enough of these guys through the years that claim one thing but yet they're in the heart there's no whole other ball game come on don't look at me like that just because we call this the message of the hour that doesn't mean we're exempt or free or or uh not susceptible to being uh invaded by a bunch of liars and everything else somebody said to me here some time ago nobody can live right in this message i said i beg your pardon i said i know one that can live it yeah that's right and his name is jesus christ and if jesus is living on the inside of my heart hallelujah then he will swing my body subject to his word [Music] [Applause] you ever wonder why god deals with you the way he deals with you why he'll allow circumstances to culminate come to a pinnacle and it's a it's a perfect storm of everything you are anything else wouldn't affect that other individual that's right but for you it's specific it's intentionally designed to drive you into place where you need to be i feel like speaking another language amen the very characteristics of you god understands how to weave them together to affect just you hallelujah thank you jesus anybody ever been sitting in church and feel like the sermon was only for them anybody feel like that tonight how's it all them heads are going like this don't you understand what the holy ghost is doing he knows how to take a man under the anointing of a gift of god and use that man to say it this way and that way and this way and that way and then this way and then that way if you're a real serious person who'll let him get serious if you're a comical person or letting him get comical i've seen the holy ghost deliver people through humor some folks sitting there they're so serious you know their face would crack if they smiled the holy ghost come down and start getting people laughing and giggling and having a good time and i'd watch that thing just that old stale spirit just oh i know some of you message people are so holy you would never laugh in church but you should you should you should have the joy of the lord in your heart because i guarantee you one thing when this next generation is looking up the ladder to see what kind of experience we've had they need to see woman to smile on it some people want the revelation of god and the power and the authority of god to raise it at i just wish someone would raise their hands in church come on brother hallelujah i just wish some of them would raise the corner of their mouth in the corner of the horizon [Music] let's work on raising the corners of your mouth and then we'll go to raising the dead but he has such an understanding of the mystery of you yes yes you realize brother benham said god deals with the man in the way he thinks so if you're an artistic type person he'll use art to get your attention if you're a musical person he'll use music to grab your attention if you're scholarly intellectual linear type thinking you know that type a personality where everything has to be on a list god will send that kind of ministry or send that kind of influence to you just to get into you and sow into your heart the mystery of who he really is you say but brother ben i it's so difficult for me to think that god actually cares that much you see this is the misconception that if we're not careful this is the one thing that satan is going to hold over our heads and i do believe it's the one thing that holds us up from rapture and resurrection because we are under the influence of an opinion and that opinion is is that our worth is so low that god could never take and bother his time to think about you don't you understand children of god every word in the bible was placed so meticulously so careful that it could get the attention of every single child of god i want you to listen to me you understand this one thing when jesus said all my father hath given me all a l l god has never forsook ignored or ostracized not one child in the body of jesus christ not one thank you lord satan would tell you you're not important you don't matter to him but the very synergy of his word is designed to catch you to catch your attention look at the nature of the bible in the bible there are poets that's right in the bible there are warriors yes in the bible there are love stories what do you all reckon that diversity is in there for to catch the attention of those that like that warrior style yeah the fight when i was a boy i loved professional wrestling when hulk hogan would get beat down he'd start doing that hawking up thing oh i get chills all over my body and when i got ready to get saved and the holy spirit started telling me about being saved you were one of the things god dealt with me on that hero thing that coming back from from from all odds being beat down beyond understanding and then being able to come back i used to wonder why do i like things like that because god made me with that warrior feeling because it comes with the ministry in the bible there is there's intellectual sides to god did you ever stop to think that when god put the bible together he put it together in such a scientific way that every scientific mind in here can be attracted to its understanding or have you figured out whether the earth is flat around yet and how around our earth can have four corners thank you lord jesus amen he put his word together in such a manner that it could attract the attention of every type of mindset in every type of thought then if i'm to understand him then he must give me a key where he can reveal to me what his thoughts are yes sir and that key is prayer brother adam talked about when we are ascending up he called it going into prayer land there's a realm that a child of god ascends to glory to god amen to where it's just like going behind this door if i've got the ability to go in there sister this is the reason that the the bible taught you don't cut your hair you want another real reason why we t women teach women to have uncut hair when i was down in jamaica and then rastafarians and men had their hair well down past their shoulders i told them you're in the same conditions as a bob-haired woman the bible said not for a man to pray with his head covered like that not for a woman to cut her hair all you say but you don't understand the nature of my hair if i don't cut it it won't grow the bible said don't you touch your glory that's thus saith the lord you can take culture proper culture and you can take a health magazine about what it says about what you're supposed to do but the bible said don't you touch it not calmly for a woman to pray or prophesy with her head uncovered cut air because it's your prayer line god demanded of a woman that she'd have such a thing on her head because of the angels you know what paul said did you ever stop to wonder what does that mean a woman with her head covered because of the angels well you remember what the bible taught about the angels that is that isaiah saw in the temple remember there were three phrases or three phases i should say rather that that god had explained to us uh through brother branham in a message influenced in different places where he talked about the wings that covered and the wings on the back one was for action one was for service but there was another one there for humility and god liken the hair on your head to give you power because of the angels in other words it is your sign of humility service and action as a daughter of god and as a son of god and when you bow your head to pray notice what i said when you bow your head to pray god recognizes your surrender god identifies your sincerity and your service you realize a woman that has cut hair if she knows better especially her prayers don't get through the roof unless she's repenting same thing with a man if he's got long hair god won't hear them unless they're repentance i'll contrary to the bible to do such a thing because a woman that cuts her hair it's a sign of rebellion showing that she has has denied her headship there's even a deeper type to this as well the bible said that we're not allowed to add nor take away so here we have in symbology a man with long hair he has added to the word of god and is very tight and she that takes the hair away she has removed from the word in the very type of what's on her head he said well the bible said hat no it said hair lord i figured you sisters will be screaming right now preach brother being preached at least the brothers i thought you don't be squeaking amen y'all ain't saying none but she has power on her head because of the angels somebody told me one time and i say this reverently it said about so i was over overseas in trinidad and they said well you see our black sisters their type of hair it splits and if they don't cut it it won't be healthy i said if they cut it their soul won't be healthy what's the difference [Music] god can take your hair and make it healthy if you're ready remember remember to have long hair doesn't mean long hair the bible said long hair is uncut hair so your hair could be this long or this long or this long or this long or way on down here like that as long as it's not cut god recognizes it as long hair praise heart you say why does this matter because if you want behind that door there's a condition you must meet in his word praise the lord all right brothers here you come do you realize that the bible said if you have an opt against your wife that you're not even able to go to prayer until you make that thing straight that's right so if you and the missus is getting a little fuss and you're mad and a hornet you all minnesotans understand that one don't you huh and you're angry and you're upset ah that guy had woman and then you try to go in and go pray you know what the holy ghost is going to tell you he's going to slam that door in your face and say go make it right with that woman there's conditions following the word sure all right let's take it next i got the brothers i got the sister let's get everybody. jesus said when you come praying stand praying he called it so when you stand hands holy hands i wouldn't all men would stand holy hands lifted he said if you know your brother's got an odd against you leave your gift at the altar and go back and go make it right with him don't offer the gift and keep on pressing oh he'll figure it out she'll figure it out that's on them that ain't on me that ain't what the bible said the bible said if you know your brother's got a knot you go to him leave your gift at the altar so that your prayers be not hindered let me give you an instance back in the 20th century of a man who had a real relationship with god and had displeased the lord by telling just a little lie what a big and it was just a little one [Music] the phone started reagan uh yes is william branham available brother bam runs out the back door says midi tell him i'm out of here right bill now are you sure tell him i'm not here he goes out stands outside to the phone calls over a little bit later somebody calls him to come and pray for a dying baby now watch if god has respect to persons he should have overlooked this completely oh that's brother branham that's elijah it's malachi 4 no big deal god don't overlook his word for nobody not me not you not nobody brother i went to go lay hands on that child and pray for it and the spirit of god spoke to him you are not fit amen to pray for that child go back and make that thing right sure friends i i believe we would understand a whole lot more while we don't get prayers answered like we think they should be answered if we understood the small principles that get that door slammed in our face and we're not allowed in [Music] i do understand that when the church gets quiet i've got you right where i want you so good good good good good we going to have a good time right here tonight oh make no mistake of it you're not going to turn me down or shut me down or make me feel awkward the quieter you get the harder i push because you're just telling on yourself you're telling on yourself that's what you're doing so rather than sit there and beat yourself up and recluse back into some little psychological shell why don't you repent and say lord this man of god has got a message to help me tonight and i want to open my spirit open up my heart and say god i want to move on with you [Applause] let me give you another instance brother batman said if somebody comes to the platform with unconfessed sin now once you listen to these words that the angel of the lord told him at green's mill nothing will stand in front of your prayer not even cancer and yet here is the same prophet of god saying if someone has unconfessed sin in their life that it can put brakes on deity you could anoint them with a 20 gallon bucket of oil but as long as that sin lays there no matter how much you pray that thing lays right there you can understand friends why some people never move on with god like they should they allow things to lay in their heart and their human spirit for many many years they allow offenses they allow historical things in their life they allow past events they allow things to build up in their human spirit and you can always tell whenever the holy ghost goes to dealing with it instead of facing it they run away from it right that's right when are we going to learn that there is not a corner of this earth that we can run to that the holy ghost don't already know and friends here's what's so sad about it the thing we hold on to that that little grudge or that little bitter feeling or that offense or that hurt or that memory or that abuse or assault or whatever that thing we hold on to if we would just give it to the lord it's a lot easier to get over than what you believe yourself but see what happens we convince ourselves i've got to hold on to this i've got to figure this out says who well you say i said just because you say don't make it that way i can say that i'm a purple elephant standing on my head gargling purple peanut butter don't make it that way come on how many people i've met in 30 years of ministry that you sit down and you talk to them talk to them and talk to them and talk to them you try to help them you're not getting anywhere you keep hitting a brick wall come to find out they've got some little thing laying inside that human spirit that they've they've harbored that inside of them for many years maybe as a child they were abused or maybe they had an abusive father or some kind of thing like that and a lot of times if you're not careful you'll tie such behavior like that to your leaders and you'll tie it to god you'll tie it to pastors and preachers and you'll tie it to the word and if every time the word gets stern and hard you'll see your abuse of uncle standing there or that abuse of controlling mother or whatever it might be separating things from your mind god is not an abuser don't you understand the build up of these things in our human spirit is the reason why many doors in our lives still remain closed god is you hear me god is not going to give you a key unless you are willing to let go of the very thing that you're holding on to that will hold you back this is why brother brown said god don't give some people gifts he said he can't trust him with it give somebody allow somebody to speak in tongues interpret prophesy maybe lay hands on the sick and they recover discern a spirit and all of a sudden now they become a stuffed shirt well look what the lord done with me tonight and they always forget that part the lord did it this is why brother and said god can't trust preachers sometimes because he said that god will go to bless them and they'll start thinking that's me doing that i always like to remind the devil whenever things are going really really well and people are being blessed to the lord and that little pride thing will come around and see what you're doing for the lord i always get me a cup of cold water and take my finger and stick it in there and pull it out and say now find the hole that's me the only reason i make an impression at all is because god's the one stuck his finger right ain't got nothing to do with ben noron or any other preacher any other human being praise the lord amen brother is dealing with a woman she's committed adultery and she hid this thing in her spirit right brother batman and sister media are sitting in the living room she's bringing in drinks trying to serve even my new media brand and all that knew that she was a server loved to serve the body of christ and about the time sister media come in brother branham had called out that thing of that affair she had had brotherhood said she passed out in the living room because the shock of it was so great and when she come to herself she said brother don't tell nobody that i repented before god listen he said you may have repented to god but it wasn't god you sinned against [Music] it was your husband about that time the prophet breaks into a vision he sees her uh sees him standing there on the chevrolet get up and he's laying underneath a tree in his car with another woman having an affair with her he said now go back and make it right because he's got the same thing to confess to you that you do to him listen at these next words i won't call the preacher's name but brother adam said no wonder he can't have a revival he was a deacon she was a sunday school teacher that's the reason why brother we need to make sure that if there's any doors closed to us god help me help me dig and dig all right help me dig down deep enough because until i'm willing to purge these things from my life he will never give me the key to those areas of my life that i desperately want to walk into don't forget friends the scripture i read to you in mark 11 24 25 is the very scripture that brother branham was thinking and meditating upon when the third pool first visited him now we call ourselves word bride don't we we're third pool people right huh what does that look like exactly anybody know anybody know what third pool bride's supposed to look like hold your quotes hold your quotes i don't mean for you to regurgitate to me what he said i mean what does it really look like what does third pool bride people really look like i guarantee you one thing that when brother baby's walking down through them woods thinking well it's not what i say it's what the word says he was not conjuring in his mind the creative power to figure out the formula for speaking squirrels into existence all of a sudden the voice of god said you're a hunting game what do you want glory to god don't you understand the very reason that god could open up this door to this man was because there was no doubt in his heart about the true word of the lord amen and because brother bradham had a clean conscience about the word about the bible and there was not a speck of doubt in his heart about thus saith the lord god could hand him the key of creation and say you speak it [Music] we're getting deep in the honeypot now sean he said he was sitting there in that little table now remember i i've been told by the brethren that were there that when brother branham was telling that story back before heidi wright they were sitting there laughing they thought brother brown was cutting up and telling the story brother was always telling some little odd story or some little thing and they thought he was cutting up they were laughing at him all at once glory to god he said that super anointing dropped into the room and had he said that ain't nothing but the truth do you understand why god turned around and used the prophet to say ask what you will there was nothing in her heart that would have hindered her from receiving that key [Applause] [Music] there hallelujah nothing on the inside that would hinder her from him saying hey you want a million dollars you want the healing of your sister edith what do you want here's the key friend i hope you understand what i'm saying to you is the very essence of resurrection and rapture because one of these days we're going to come to such a place of such total surrender before the lord that he is going to say all right you change your body you want rest you go ahead and raise yourself up amen oh you say it's the lord that does that yes but don't forget the power of resurrection [Applause] that's why jesus could stand right there that day and say destroy this temple and three days i'll raise it up again he already knew he had the key of resurrection praise the lord this ain't gone nowhere near like i wanted it to tonight but we're in the good spots now i had my notes all prepared i'm on his notes now right those things must be repented of let me give you another example what about talking about a young lady that drowns some time ago in her lifetime and the lord spared her but she goes into the hospital she's got a baby and this this child she's wondering what we call preeclampsia now back then they called it toxemia the placenta and the umbilical cord begins breaking down and that toxic cells and that that that dead fiber begins circling through the system raises the blood pressure raises the heart rate causes the body to swell strangulates the baby and sometimes the women that are delivered they almost sometimes never get over it back in those days especially now they have magnesium and all kinds of different chemicals and things to put in the body to bring it under total subjection to try to save that woman's life they've saved hundreds of millions of lives probably with the science they've developed today but back in that time period they didn't have the same understanding that they do now and here this girl is laying there dying they call brother branham brother said the parents were just these people that just slinked in and out of the tabernacle come to church when they felt like it and on and on and said the last day she was in her bed and said her testimony became such that her parents gave their heart back to the lord god started doing great things right there in that hospital seemingly she got better and one day her mama walked in she said i'm going home mama well i know sweetheart i know i know they're getting ready to release it you're getting he said no no mama you don't understand i'm getting ready to go home sometime later the girl dies now watch brother branham the prophet of god who stood on the platform in india and said if this man's eyes don't come open which one of your gods you come out here bring buddha up here bring all the rest of them you seeks you jane come up here with your hindu religion and open this man's eyes he said though that time billy graham went down in there and said they made the challenge to him he said i wish i could have stood where billy stood [Music] and he said they begin breaking their idols he said it made a dust cloud for city blocks when that man's eyes come open same prophet of god and now this girl goes by the way of the grave and brother branham goes to god and says you owe me an understanding you know what brother ham said about that he said well the lord let me pout around for about six months i guess ain't none of y'all know what pouting around is all about dude at least none of you are going to admit it tonight are you huh he said he let me pile around for a little while he said then one day he come to me in a vision and showed to me she should have died way back when they had that little party and she was drowning in the in the pool or in the in the in the creek but said she wasn't ready to go then but now she was ready to go that's why i took her here brother man's looking at the great miracles that took place in the last hours of the girl's life her mom and dad get right with god on and on and on and on and then here she dies this is what brother branham said had i approached him with the right attitude he would have told me right away what the reason was yes he said i found out god don't owe me anything [Music] now here's a prophet of god that has created squirrels he has given hattie her children there has been great mighty things by this time as i understand it he has already had all kinds of healings and miracles and revivals and things that would boggle the human mind and for six months brother branham beat his head against this closed door why god you owe me an understanding he said if i just had the right attitude he would have said here let me show you what it was all about it makes me wonder friends if the reason why we don't get no further than what we get sometimes is because we come with this elitist attitude that's right i'm the bride i deserve it you see there's two sides of the spectrum there are you that are sitting here tonight that don't believe you deserve anything and there are you that believe you deserve everything there is no in-between don't play like aries and as preachers we preach to both groups so you know when you're preaching about the bride and the power and the authority of god they're going yes sir man of god bring it on bring it on when you try to humble them that's when they get quiet they make 47 trips to the bathroom and they check the cell phone and then that other group when you're sitting there preaching about all the power to resurrection amen that other group is sitting there and they're saying oh that's not me oh i just can't i can't i can't raise them up do you understand how many times he would hand us the key if we would just approach him the way he said to approach him our father who art in heaven i like what spurgeon said there brother carol my my old pastor before he retired he used to quote this one all the time when he says our father that's plural meaning that is not just my father but he's the father of a and in order for him to be a father that means he must have children our father who art in heaven watch us approach hallowed be thy name that's worship amen thank you jesus we don't we don't come to him with a wishlist like this we come to him with thank you lord hallelujah the only reason i'm living today is because of your grace the only reason i understand your mercy you ever heard the expression you get more bees with honey than you do vinegar the prophet of god said that when we have a fragrance that stinks that's why we must apply prayer he said if you ever went into a rose garden or something early in the morning you said the dew laying across all them branches and them leaves dropping off you see these beautiful picturesque type photographs you know where they just said the garden just the outlet a little fog laying that mislaying over how beautiful it is brother baby said that's the way it is when we enter into prayer land enter that place of prayer we go into where the fragrance of the holy spirit he said how fresh we are in the presence of the angel yes praise the lord let's be honest sometimes the reason we don't get the key is because our attitude stinks there'll be a lot of people in this message wind up in hell over their attitude a lot quicker than they'll wind up in hell over the false doctrines or the split beliefs or the false understandings that they've acquired they're going to be a lot more people wind up in hell because of their stinky rotten attitude they think god owes them something and on the other side of that you that don't think you deserve anything you're just as bad because you're calling yourself scum when he called you a jewel you're calling yourself trash when he called you the apple of his eye you are just as bad as them elitist ones that think they deserve everything because you're not raising to a level to accept anything setting on a stool to do nothing well i'm not worthy i don't have the ability who said that about you who who prophesied that over your life oh you say mama said it mama's not your ultimate i was taught that growing up those who taught you that were not the ultimate of your life they do not have the key to the mystery of you amen [Applause] he said it's like working a job scott if i go to work for you this afternoon and i say it's hard to call you scotty ain't it everybody calls you scotty except for your girls they call your dad but if i was to say brother scott i i need a little work he put me to work and i got up there maybe monday morning instead of going right on to the job or going right and doing something i just go stand over and work on my phone a little while you know if i want to know what i'm supposed to do listen close i go to him that gave me the job and i say to him what do you want me to do amen when you look at your life and you see a mystery before you go to that has the key i'm trying to behave myself y'all but it's hard and say lord what lori what do you want me to do how do you see me in 10 years how do you see me in five years friends this is the reason why people get in marriage situations because they don't stop to pray long enough to say god who did you choose for me to be married to i guarantee you one thing if you wait long enough on who the lord gives to you you'll never have a problem that way the reason we have so many marriage and divorce cases and listen young people there is if you have been raised in this message don't you go around thinking you've got permissive will you don't so you're sitting on this pew that's understood marriage and divorce from a boy and a girl you have no excuse for doing the things that some of us do we've heard from a child up don't have engagements and things unless it's a good faith engagement go to the father get his permission in the message we skip over every bit of that people make promises and do things and they don't even sit down and talk to the leader of the home and then wonder why they're getting a mess later on it's because we're not praying because we don't take a step back and say god what if the lord never saw you get married until you was 87 years old amen oh that's awful don't tell me that brother bill i want to get married tomorrow [Music] okay well i'll ask you a question then smartypants would you rather live 65 years in hell or would you rather live about 15 years in heaven come on now it's up to you how you want to i choose the brother say a number of years ago that you bought this brand new car i was thinking this coming up the road actually and he talked about i said he's a brand new car he said i didn't pray over the thing he said all the cars i'd had before that i prayed over every one of them he said this one is brand new cloth i wouldn't be all right he said i never had so much trouble out of the car in all of my life it broke down i ended up having to sell the thing he said because it cost me more money to keep it up than it was though i bought it because all of these things are little mysteries even where to live oh no i know i know i know but don't forget brother branham said families carry spirits that's where you better understand what family you're marrying into [Music] oh i love them so much you better find out what mama looked like you better find out what daddy talked like [Music] you better find out what them uncles and aunts have been up to [Applause] come on see some of y'all there's others there you some of you are pulling the rest of you are going oh god oh god oh god oh god make him shut up lord you've never prayed all week long you're praying right now oh don't try to hide jonah jesus knows where you're at [Music] i keep going long enough he'll come to your front door he knows your address still you don't need brother brad i'm here to tell your address jesus knows this i'm not even paying attention to that clock you get that out of your mind i'm not quitting till the lord's done [Applause] amen children of god did we come here for revival or didn't we whether i say in the name of the lord let's have a revival let's get all the trash out of our lives god has a key that he wants to give to us [Applause] that's the real spirit of revival anyways now friends i know our modern day evangelism is a lot of shouting and hollering and good one-liners and good one-line bases and getting everybody excited and jubilant and standing on their feet and rejoicing let me tell you something brother i might be a young man to some of you but i've had too many miles on this whole body i told somebody today i'm a 44 year old in a 97 year old body i beat it to death traveling for the lord these eyes have seen a lot we're living in a time we don't need fluff evangelism we need something like this right here tonight not trying to boast myself i'm talking about the quality and the content of the word i'm trying to bring you we need this in our lives to get us in a place to think to examine ourself whether i'm in the faith like i should be or not how many times have you seen somebody come and say lord i want deliverance so badly you see they say the words but god never gives them the key he can't trust us until we're willing to say lord i'll go all the way. all the way if there's any shortage or stopping short it's only because we've never opened ourself up to let him show us how to get through the door hallelujah brother branham is standing on the platform in minneapolis there's a blind girl that comes up and he says god is going to heal this blind girl he walks off the platform defeated because god never touched her eyes he said then i realized that i was making a challenge that not even jesus christ himself made he always asked him dost thou believe he never commanded it he based it on your faith even sitting right here tonight many of the struggles that you're up against and the answers that you're wanting and the things you can't seem to accomplish they're not the lacking of the holy spirit wanting to give you this it's the lacking of you not wanting to go all the way and open your heart and your spirit up to say god i'll go all the way whatever it takes that's why when you come to this altar and you come and you pray and you ask god into your heart you better mean business because if not you'll walk away of failure you'll walk away defeated he's not going to hand you the key all right now here's the holy ghost here's power here's authority go take over over the kingdom of hell kick open the door and and slap the devil in the teeth he's not going to hand this over to you unless you're willing to go all the way as i said it's not when you accept the holy ghost it's when the holy ghost accepts you amen in order for him to seal us he must see that our attitude is correct that we'll serve him without a question that will sell out everything amen you know when i received the holy ghost i had given my heart to the lord at 12 and wandered around a bit as a sinner not really knowing exactly what it was all about and the day i give my heart to the lord and i receive the holy ghost i'd hear preachers many times after that saying you've got to understand truth you've got to understand the message i didn't even understand why i was walking to the front right but when i got out of that seat and i walked up there to give my heart to the lord i learned many years later the reason he filled me with the holy ghost is because when i walked to the front i had one attitude on my heart whatever you want lord is what i want remember the true power of a child of god lay in their surrender let me say that one more time the true power of a believer lay within their surrender amen not how much you can hold on to how much you're willing to turn loose listen to this brother said being alone many times i've climbed up in the he said many of the men that were with me thought i was going hunting he said but i'd get up there and sit down on a rock and look to the sky until my whole inner being seemed to be filled with something the world just seemed to pass away those precious hours alone with god listen to these words it's in there glory where the greatest revelation and inspiration comes many people think brother ram god is great inspiration from reading the bible he did not many people think that brother branham got his great inspirations by understanding mysteries and doctrines from the bible he did not he said if we'd take more time with that i'm sure we would live a better life a more victorious life in christ do you realize a man that a woman and a woman that is prayed up could never commit adultery a man a woman that has prayed up could never backslide yes it's whenever that thing begins to lack in our life when those things come in sure when people start sliding back look what's the first thing they give up on that communication between demon god if the devil can get some of you here to believe tonight that the lord is not interested in your prayers it don't matter how much you read the bible how much you come to church how much you quote mysteries if he ever cuts that part off he cuts off inspiration he cuts off revelation come on now notice in matthew chapter 6 verse 6 jesus said when thou prayers enter into thy closet when thou hast shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father would see it then secret shall rewardly open the openly remember this is the scripture that the angel of the lord quotes to brother branham when he tells him in that tent vision i'll meet you in that little room that'll be the third pool this is what he quotes to him that's right how did all of them great things take place with brother brown oh i know i know your question to me when i said didn't come from the bible you just hold your horses a minute because i'm going to read it to you out of his own mouth when he was walking through that storm in colorado what scripture was he quoting what revelation was he studying he was trying to get out of there and a voice spoke to him go back up go back up brother man was a hunter he knew that first few snowflakes was the warning shot get out of there now but he said i know that voice it had spoke to me all my life he had never led me wrong oh thank god for an obedient man that knew how to listen to the voice of god he said so i turned around i headed back up the mountain and a voice come speak to it right you all reckon that brother brown was sitting with his bible open his pencil two plus two is four two plus two is four writing down the statute of a perfect man while he was trekking up the snow and the snow getting up to his knees and his ankles and up to up to his waist and and and he's he knows in his spirit he's feels that death is coming on and he's going to freeze to death y'all reckon he was going to see the red horse rider was that was the devil in those church ages murdering them saints yes uh what all wrecking brother brown was doing going up the mountain praying lord he said that when he got up around a certain spot by a tree the voice come i am the creator of the heavens and the earth [Music] god said here you go now speak to it he said he come down into town he said his beard all growed out covered in squirrel blood and said this old boy got to talk and said you know there was supposed to be a big storm coming through here all of a sudden it disappeared i imagine brother brown probably just went yep i heard about that you are into god there's no way you could have convinced brother branham that it didn't happen just like with the event of the cloud where jeff jenkins and the rest of these guys ran around calling it rocket ship smoke i don't care what they say when that prophet of god was standing there in that vision and he saw those angels of the lord may not even have known that it even took place out there in arizona but when he saw the photo in life magazine he said that it's what the lord showed me in arizona there's a brother by the name of doug baker if you need his address and telephone number i'll let you write him or email him or i'll let you contact him yourself let doug tell you we was heading up the mountain arizona we was talking about this event jeff down there in lima just made this decoration and we were talking about that thing you know it went around the world and and i said a little thing about it and doug said my rocket won't do that yeah i said your rocket he said i was the lead engineer of the thor missile that's right he said my rocket won't do that it won't hold a shape like that i like what chad lamb said he said it won't hold a shape like that a perfect shape for the space of a half an hour and then go 200 or 77 miles all the way down holding its perfect shape when brother branham saw it it was something that god had showed him in a vision in 1962. [Music] and if that prophet was standing here today they could bring up all the evidence as they want but when he saw those 16 men fall off that bridge he knew that was going to happen if brother brown was here he may not be able to explain it himself but god showed him the understanding of it now listen i'm not trying to make this a sermon about how great brother branham was i'm using these examples to get a message to you that if we can ever get ourselves alone with the lord on these little things in our lives about how we can open up this mystery or that mystery if we will find that same place of surrender oh god i wish somebody would hear me tonight if we could ever find that same place of surrender god would give us the same key that he gave to brother brett don't forget in the old testament the wave sheath when the priest would take a piece of corn whatever it might have been and wave it before the people it was testifying that everything in the field would be just like that one right there in the message testimony 19-50 he said my heart's been stirred for a long time he said i know we're ready for something he said now you come in you christians don't stay in a lukewarm condition anymore get as close to god as you can walk with him talk with him let everything be secondary but your prayer life now you say brother ben are you living this no no i'm really not there are things that get in my way just like they get in your way there are things that interrupt me just like they interrupt you but this is what brother venom said this is what the bible taught us to pray without ceasing and i believe if god said it we have a way of being able to possess it praise the lord thank you jesus absolutely god has not left us without the ability to perform his word thank you jesus he said if we'd only get alone with the quietness of the night oh how the dew would fall and refresh us if we'd only get quiet and alone with god how the dew would strengthen us listen to this take all the wilt out of us yes you ever see somebody that's in that kind of condition even when they come to church they sit all wilty like saints can be worshiping people can be rejoiced and stand on their feet clapping their hands hollering amen and they're just sitting there like that's wilty you need some water to make you a little alive a little fresh how do you get there by the power of prayer brethren said and knoweth it not the higher you rise in god the more sinful this whole thing looks sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the holy spirit he says takes you into a spear the whole thing looks like chaos and then when you come back down glory seem to the people like you're a rascal nothing but an old sarcastic a fool stand as an old crank always rebuking the people but if you ever climb into them spears one time when in the presence of god not through emotion but through the genuine holy spirit lifting up he said you can see that the whole thing ichabod is rode and the glory of the lord is departed over the whole denominational outfit blind bartimaeus i want you to notice elijah said went into the room where the baby was lying shut the door behind him just he and the baby that's where the most successful times is when you get alone with god yes how many wants to be successful even you people that don't think you can be successful how many want to be now why do i see hands still down honestly you mean you don't want to be successful you mean you don't want to win you don't want to win the battle well brother ben i i i'm not able to you're right there but if i want to be successful my success doesn't come by my strength and my knowledge of the word praise god somebody my strength my ability to win the battle my success comes from my surrendered prayer life friend could you imagine the devil works for months to set a trap for you puts this person in your way puts that person your way puts this circumstance he lets this wheel turn for that cog and then that cog connects with this over here and on and on and here you're at the perfect spot where satan thinks i've got him and somehow another instead of you making a left turn like he expected yeah you make a right one and i imagine the devil probably said how did they know that was coming this is where you'll hear preachers say we have the real key to overcoming because whenever god moves on me and tells me watch out boy don't go to that certain place this weekend don't go to that certain church don't go to that certain individual stay away from that certain spot he says it's a quality the devil didn't even hear him whispering hallelujah and that dumb stupid ignorant amen blind deaf devil dumb devil he thinks he's got you whipped but what he doesn't know is before he set the trap god had already given you the key prayer is a sincere thing he said prayer is talking to god prayers not get down shut your eyes think about your washing your work you're doing you see if you're if you're in such a mode you are not in prayer if your mind is on other things you are not in prayer though your lips may be moving though you may be performing and and executing the action of prayer you are not in prayer if your mind and your heart is not engaged amen let's not get down lord help me and john and miss jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating words oh you know how we do lord you said on chapter 1 of page 4 of volume 12 and the prophet said y'all reckon god didn't know that when he wrote it don't reckon he didn't know his word we spend so much time trying to impress him by how smart we are like a bunch of kids trying to impress daddy when what we should do is just go in there and speak to him exactly what is in our mind and exactly what is in their heart let me model it for you when i go to prayer and i'm angry about something i just tell the lord i am so mad i could kill. you say you don't he knows it anyways why should i lie come on i mean brother if i go into the prayer concert hall no nothing to see here everything is fine i'm all right now i'm fine lord i love him anyways he knows i'm a lying snake in the grass why should i tell him something he knows ain't right [Music] if i'm trouble if i'm bothered if i'm under a temptation if i'm discouraged i just go in the room and i tell him lord sometimes right and i love i love in one way i love this mass thing because i can pray and people don't know i'm praying and the bluetooth age of technology they don't know whether i've got an earbud or nothing so i just go down through the airport talking to the lord i heard somebody say one time that guy must be on the call of his life he's having a good time oh i thought yeah i got a phone call all right i'm on that town i'm talking on the royal telephone thank you jesus if i'm under temptation i just tell him god yes i don't know if i can whip that one or not it's too much to my tell him sometimes it's too much of what i want here i don't know if i can whip that one or not i guarantee you if you started having some real honesty in prayer and just being blunt brutal honest with him i bet you'd hear him talk to you a lot more i'm going to say something forgive me if this sounds ugly but it i'm ashamed of people in this message that don't believe that god can even talk to him anymore i guarantee you one thing if you have a relationship with him and you really get in the right atmosphere you can hear him speaking to you when i moved to tennessee it's been 17 years now i had a good job my wife had a good job we was in a very very good position and i was invited to come to tennessee all i'd ever known in my life was my ohio home my high family the lord spoke to me to go to tennessee i told him no all my people were gunslingers and bank robbers all of them down from the south i said no i'm not going to that bunch of people tell you what six months later i found out you don't tell god no he beat me within an inch of my life everything failed all the stuff that was going right started going wrong and i was up on top of a wood trailer one time or semi trailer taking wood skids and throwing them down on the side like that and everything had kind of stopped you know what i mean all the bad had just and everything had been going good the last couple days and it dawned on me and all of a suds like the lord said to me decision time boy and i fell on my face and i said lord why are you making me leave here this is all i've ever known i heard him speak to me like this i have need of you there when i moved to tennessee it wasn't six months before god kicked the doors off of the world and before i knew it i had a worldwide ministry preaching around and around the world at least one time in my life i did not know i was so ignorant and so foolish when i left my job in ohio i come to tennessee and started looking for another job just like the one i left that's smart isn't it god tell you to leave one job just to what go down to another state and work the same thing all over again it goes to prove you don't always understand where he's leading you but when i heard him say the words to me because i have need of you there that's what settled it for me because i thought god if you need me i want to be of service to you then amen when i showed up shortly thereafter this brother connected with that brother that one connected with that one people say oh your pastor's brother care well i know brother carol anybody's all right brother carol army why don't you come preach for me next thing i know i've been around and around and around over two million miles my father looked me in the face and said you'll be bankrupt in six months my family disagreed with every move i made the fact that i left my job was a a topic of disdain and disgust for years after i moved to tennessee i heard more ridicule from people saying why did you make such a stupid move and then after i got there it wasn't a bowl of roses either i started preaching the gospel to a bunch of sinful people that didn't want to live right and and experience some of the greatest persecution i had ever went through in my life but you know i held on 15 years that voice on top that trailer when i was praying i have need of you there and until he tells me he don't need me anymore that's where i belong i'm trying to tell you something brother i'm trying to tell you that if you can ever get to a spot to where you hear from god it don't matter if it's like moses at 80 years old and the holy ghost tells this old man with his bald head and his long beard and his high high-tempered wife go down there to egypt and take over he come walking in and step right up in front of pharaoh and all the rest of them let my people go you know why that he was able to stand there on the face of a nation and defy the politics of the day defy the kingship of the day defy all of the ruling authorities of that day because he was on the backside of the desert when that voice spoke to him in prayer i'm going to deliver my children i'm using you to do it there are absolutes in our life that anchor us sister that man you're married to if you know that you're a husband there's not a man in the world that could entice you to pull it away from him amen no there's not a man in the world vice versa brother if she's really the one for you there's not a woman in this world oh you may you may have thoughts huh a vice versa people may say things that sound good you may feel tempted but there's an anchor on the inside of a man that really loves a woman and vice versa that when the rubber meets the road they say are you crazy i try to live in such a manner that i treat my wife as good as i know how to treat her i try to treat her as so blessed that if another man tried to come up and fool with her she'd take one look at him and the devil and say are you crazy you know how good i got it back here let me go a bit further let's close i'm not picking it up tomorrow i'm going to finish it so here we are i don't know when i'll get back to you so i'm just going to take the time you just settle in and just enjoy it we're not enjoyed either way we're going on oh listen to this brother bam said prayers when you come into an atmosphere that you realize you're in the presence of god you're moving into the deepest of sincerity then first you say a little worship oh jehovah then after the worship of prayer you come with a sincere heart asking amen and jude verse 20 beloved build up yourselves on your most holy faith praying amen in the holy ghost so not just praying one of the first places i was privileged to go in my travels was oru or roberts university tulsa oklahoma to me you might as well just took me through the white house to get to step on oral roberts's campus out there and to go up to the prayer tower you know if you've ever seen it it's the big round crown of thorns they designed it like the crown of thorns for jesus and you get in this little elevator and you go up now friends i don't stumble at this but i got on that elevator and me and this pastor we went up to the top of that elevator and before the doors open i could feel an atmosphere where people have been praying in there sure but that don't always mean that god's the one listening there's a difference between praying and praying in the holy ghost somebody told me about mother teresa you know and i don't mean to throw off on the woman she's gone to her reward now but they said what a praying woman she was i said yes but who did all the talking here's the question is prayer us coming into a place and saying god i want this and i want that and i believe this and i believe that or his prayer thing where we just wait on the lord father you see the question in my heart you know you don't even have to say a word sometimes just walk in there and just raise your hands up and say here i am and he knows the answer to what you have if you'll just let him lead you step by step last one brother baby said remember an astronaut is controlled by a radar power that's right that's right and we've got radar too prayer amen prayer is the radar that directs the astronauts amen watch the way the prayer is going and you can see the way he's pointing okay watch the way the church is praying and you can see the way the missiles will fly glory you can tell by the way the astronauts are traveling by the way that the church is praying again brother banham said now listen to this last statement i want to thank each one of you you said for singing that song a few moments ago for you i'm praying he said that's what i want you to do it's prayer that i depend on that's the secret of all the mysteries of god that's the key that opens the door to everything of god is prayer and he goes on us a little while talking about that's how he gets his message as he said a little bit ago you thought when i said you didn't get it from the bible this is where you need to understand before brother branham cracked the scripture open he got along with god and started praying he tells us in stature perfect man october 62 if you want to look it up he said i went up there and lean up against the tree before daylight he said i've got a pencil in my pocket he said waiting on the lord he said it comes two plus two is four faster two plus two is four faster two plus two four two four he said all sudden the holy spirit will open it up he said then i get my bible out and go check it all out is all right brother neville get them together at the tabernacle the lord's give us a message that's how brother branham knew what the mysteries of god was in this bible because he took time to pray friends i believe that it is such an important thing that i would rather see a man or woman that knows how to pray than a man or woman that can memorize every scripture in the bible because many people can read the bible but without prayer you don't understand what you're reading you may be able to put it together mechanically but the actual message of it and how you fit into all of it will never be revealed to you until you can come to that sincere place of prayer where god can speak to your heart [Applause] let me show you how important it is jesus looks over the field of the harvest and it's white all these sons of god all these saints of god daughters of god and this is what jesus said to his disciples you pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the field that's how important it was you pray i i mean i've got 12 pages here of one thing after another where paul would tell the people pray for us that god can give us a door of utterance when we go to certain places pray for us that god can give us favor it is the most important weapon that's ever been placed in our hands it's even more important in one direction and one way of looking at it it's more important than the bible in this regard you could memorize the scripture but without prayer you don't understand how to apply it so the bible alone just as the bible is without revelation it's just dead letter to you but listen friends this is this is my last remark but prayer takes you into the dynamics of what you're reading have you ever been there you got the bible open before you and all of a sudden oh i never saw that before don't you know what happened he stuck the key in the lock open up the door and went take a peek inside [Music] no wonder jesus said i am the door no man enters in except he comes by me let's pray [Music] heavenly father lord as the saints of god are bowing their heads over to you to the dust from which we've come one thing is absolutely clear tonight and that is you wanted every one of us to understand how powerful the weapon of prayer is to us individuals i pray tonight lord that you would let your holy spirit so wash over these elect tonight for those that aren't saved maybe not born again maybe not living where they should lord if they're if they're reaching that spot open the door to them i pray [Music] but if not god will you help them to come to that place to where the door can open up help them come to that spot so they can have their hand out and you put the key there for all of us believers here tonight lord there's areas of our life that i'm sure lord we're not completely satisfied with maybe there's mysteries there that we don't know the answers to but i pray that you'll help us to come to such a place of surrender until you can place in our hands the key that opens up the door granted lord in the name of jesus christ i pray hallelujah hallelujah oh bless the lord [Music] sing it down sing it once again oh rest [Music] near the cross [Music] lord [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] reaction [Music] near the cross [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] just [Music] you know that's where prayer put us he put us to the foot of the cross when we enter the ground of prayer [Music] enter the land of prayer we find ourselves at the foot of the cross that's where love and mercy find us tomorrow we will not have our regular sunrise service but at 9 00 a.m we will play the sunrise message until 10 10 a.m and then we will have a time of prayer at 10 30 the service some service will start tomorrow so 9 00 am we just played a sunrise message just like we do for our sunday school played a message but we'll play the sunrise message tomorrow by 9 00 a.m and then we will have our 10 minutes time of prayer and meditation and then the sun service was stat at 10 30 tomorrow we want to thank the lord for what a blessing that he had brought our way if there is anything remember the prophet god told us that's the thing that we can never do too much of is to pray and and how god how it will please god in this time that we are living with everything that is going on around the world to come and remind you of how much he longed to hear from you every day [Music] let's count it a blessing with my hands lifted up let's sing there tonight let's just bless him let's just praise him wave my hands lifted we pray [Music] given [Music] with my hands and my thanksgiving tonight will bless you alone yes will [Music] of [Music] i will bless you yes i will bless i will [Music] thank you jesus father we are so grateful tonight lord we just we just want to thank you the father lord you took
