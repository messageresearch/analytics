[37:23] of god
[37:26] there is no retirement
[37:29] in the service of the king
[37:32] there is no pension
[37:37] you never get tired when you get tired
[37:40] you speak to your body
[37:43] praise be to god yes
[37:47] um you know
[37:51] prayer
[37:56] you can never underestimate that
[38:00] weapon of prayer god has given to us
[38:05] you pray with the physical eyes you
[38:07] don't see
[38:08] anything but spiritual things are
[38:11] happening
[38:14] praise be to god one brother one was
[38:17] leading the prayer something just came
[38:19] to my mind i remembered
[38:20] a few years ago i had a dream that there
[38:23] were two caskets
[38:24] that were sitting in our home and people
[38:28] came
[38:28] to mourn with us and um of
[38:32] all of us there were two that were not
[38:34] in our midst
[38:36] so and in the preceding years
[38:41] they're having three situations
[38:45] each of those situations could have been
[38:48] that time
[38:51] but god has been so faithful
[38:55] last sunday when we pulled up in the
[38:58] driveway
[39:00] joshua no before we even came to church
[39:03] when he was ironing his clothes for
[39:05] service
[39:06] he said dad one of my friends just died
[39:10] and i asked him what killed him he said
[39:13] he doesn't
[39:14] know but two things came in mind but i
[39:17] didn't say anything
[39:19] and then when we pulled up in the
[39:21] driveway
[39:23] he said he got another text the guy
[39:28] overdosed on drugs
[39:35] and he said of all his friends he said
[39:38] all his friends have died
[39:42] with exception of one and that gentleman
[39:45] has been here before
[39:47] very good and i all have died
[39:51] with the exception of one
[39:57] and i started wondering
[40:02] you know
[40:07] never lose hope
[40:11] you can't look at a man and tell what
[40:13] god would do with that man
[40:16] but you can look at them and tell
[40:19] that god has taken a hold of that vessel
[40:22] praise be to god brother brother typed
[40:26] the church to the moon
[40:30] and when the moon comes out
[40:34] you see it's a very tiny thread
[40:37] up in the sky and the greater part of it
[40:41] is dark even though the greater part of
[40:44] it is dark
[40:46] it doesn't stop that tiny tread from
[40:50] shining
[40:52] the moon does not wait
[40:55] to get midway or to get full
[40:59] before it begins to shine
[41:03] praise be to god brother branham said
[41:07] that justification sanctification and of
[41:09] course the holy ghost baptism
[41:11] is the work of the holy ghost
[41:14] so when god has actually taken a hold of
[41:17] a vessel
[41:19] it doesn't matter whether it is in the
[41:20] stage of scientific i mean um
[41:22] justification or scientification you can
[41:25] see
[41:26] that there is something going on in that
[41:28] life praise be to god
[41:30] it doesn't matter how little or how
[41:32] small that light is
[41:34] it would shine to the glory of god
[41:37] and i just want to thank you all for
[41:39] your prayers
[41:41] our prayers would never be in vain
[41:45] if you are here praying for a loved one
[41:47] for a friend
[41:48] for a colleague for a co-worker
[41:51] never lose hope never lose courage
[41:55] it may seem too far the devil would come
[41:59] and tell you
[42:00] god doesn't really even hear what you
[42:01] are saying
[42:03] but the devil is a liar we don't expect
[42:06] him to ever speak the truth
[42:09] he is good at what he does and what he
[42:12] is good at
[42:12] is nothing but lies praise be to god
[42:18] tonight by the grace of god we are just
[42:22] going to talk
[42:24] it's not so much about preaching tonight
[42:28] i don't know how some of the things
[42:30] happen
[42:33] but praise be to god that it happened
[42:35] the way they do
[42:38] so we're just going to have a little
[42:42] conversation
[42:45] you know
[42:49] just on monday
[42:53] he was josh i was looking for a job
[42:56] and i wrote to the hr recommending him
[43:00] where i used to work before the plant
[43:03] and they sent me a text no an
[43:05] email if your son is like you then he
[43:08] has no problem
[43:10] and i really felt very humbled okay
[43:14] those things just humble you and i send
[43:17] them a text back i mean an email back
[43:20] and today he had an interview and the
[43:24] manager asked him
[43:25] how did you get to know of this position
[43:27] he said my father told me about it he
[43:29] said who is your father
[43:31] he mentioned my name he said oh donna
[43:34] lee
[43:35] then ali told me something five years
[43:37] ago and i would never forget then at
[43:40] least your father
[43:41] and i don't know at least also in saying
[43:43] so all that that is not necessary though
[43:47] praise be to god
[43:52] so he told me i said wow
[43:55] i don't remember what exactly i told him
[43:59] but i remember having several
[44:01] conversations with him
[44:04] but what exactly i told him
[44:07] i don't remember
[44:11] and i'm here to say
[44:15] that ways are powerful
[44:19] and that happens to be
[44:22] my message for tonight the power of
[44:26] words
[44:28] praise be to god there is power
[44:34] in white if we can just stand for a
[44:36] moment
[44:38] and read from hebrews 4 12.
[44:45] in the last two weeks this is probably
[44:47] the third or fourth time
[44:50] we've been talking about this scripture
[44:52] 4 12
[44:56] for the word of god is quick and
[44:58] powerful
[45:00] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[45:03] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[45:06] the soul and spirit
[45:07] and of the joints and marrow and it's at
[45:10] the center of the thoughts
[45:12] and intents of the heart praise beauty
[45:15] god may the lord add his blessings to
[45:17] the reading of his word shall we please
[45:18] be seated
[45:25] now what brought about this topic
[45:30] was that there was a
[45:33] short video that i saw
[45:39] actually there were two one was by akira
[45:45] and they had some students do an
[45:48] experiment
[45:50] where they had two plants
[45:55] and then they said very kind words
[45:59] to one plant and they said very mean
[46:02] waste
[46:04] to the other
[46:07] they were the same plant
[46:10] in different vessels by the same soil
[46:14] their growth everything was the same
[46:17] but for 30 days they would come
[46:21] oh i love you you are great you are this
[46:24] you are that
[46:24] and you go here i hate you you are mean
[46:27] and what have you
[46:29] and they did that for 30 days
[46:32] and the one that the priest
[46:36] blossomed looked very fresh
[46:42] was looking very promising but the one
[46:45] that they told a lot of mean ways
[46:48] we did the leaves started yellowing
[46:54] and then again there was this japanese
[46:56] scientists
[46:58] who put um
[47:02] three different i think it was rice or
[47:04] salt in three different containers and
[47:06] labeled them
[47:08] love hate and i think neglect
[47:13] and the wonder was shown love after 30
[47:16] days
[47:18] fermented with the water there looking
[47:20] very good
[47:24] the one he wrote hate on you could see
[47:27] how
[47:27] dark it was
[47:31] and the one that was neglected was
[47:34] anything between the good and the bad
[47:39] so when i saw it
[47:43] something just struck me
[47:46] that's why i said tonight i'm not just
[47:49] here to preach
[47:51] but i just want us to look at a few
[47:52] things praise be to god
[47:56] the power there is
[47:59] in the word
[48:03] i would want us to take the word of god
[48:07] the word of god is quick and powerful
[48:10] there is no doubt about it
[48:14] by the way everything we see in this
[48:17] life
[48:18] with the assumption of mind came into
[48:21] existence
[48:23] from the spoken word
[48:27] god spoke everything into existence
[48:34] there is power in the world
[48:39] it doesn't matter whether it took a day
[48:41] a thousand years hundred years
[48:43] when god spoke it was done
[48:48] that is why you don't have to see to
[48:51] believe
[48:54] believed and see it
[48:58] and if you even believe and you don't
[49:00] see it
[49:01] it's no indication that god has not
[49:04] answered that prayer
[49:06] praise be to god there is power
[49:11] in the spoken word
[49:19] when god speaks it is settled
[49:27] when god told
[49:30] abraham that your seed after you
[49:34] would be in australia's land
[49:37] for 400 years and after that i would
[49:40] come and deliver them
[49:42] nothing could change it because
[49:46] god had spoken
[49:50] when the time came for god to honor his
[49:52] word and to deliver them
[49:54] nothing would change it because god has
[49:57] spoken
[50:02] when moses
[50:05] struck the rock twice and god was
[50:08] displeased
[50:09] god told him
[50:12] you will see the promised land but you
[50:15] will not set foot
[50:16] on that land god has spoken
[50:20] nothing could change it
[50:25] god told the children of israel he was
[50:26] going to give them the land
[50:29] and there was nothing that was going to
[50:31] change it
[50:32] why because god has spoken
[50:37] there is power in the world
[50:43] when nebuchadnezzar saw his achievement
[50:45] and he did not attribute it to god
[50:48] and he thought it was just his effort
[50:51] and he started boosting god told him
[50:56] you are going to be with the beast on
[50:58] the field
[50:59] the man that was so respected and so
[51:03] feared he became a beast
[51:08] lived in the bush
[51:11] at grass like a cow
[51:15] and the deal of heaven fell on him
[51:19] his hair grew as thick as the feathers
[51:21] of an eagle
[51:23] and his nails like the clothes of the
[51:25] beast
[51:27] why because god had spoken
[51:32] there is power in the world
[51:37] the reason why we don't see the power
[51:39] there is
[51:40] in the word of god is because we don't
[51:43] mix it with faith
[51:46] that is why the bible has made it clear
[51:49] that
[51:50] without faith no man can please god
[51:56] i remember helping a sister one time
[51:59] to write something and something
[52:03] i came across something the placebo
[52:05] effect
[52:08] and all he was just talking about
[52:12] is that when patients go to the hospital
[52:15] and they are giving medication
[52:17] and they take it and they get well they
[52:20] are saying that
[52:21] it is they believe they have in the drug
[52:25] that when they take it they will be well
[52:27] that is what makes them well
[52:29] and i started thinking about it i said
[52:32] wow
[52:33] even medical science you can trace some
[52:37] amount of faith
[52:38] in what they are doing
[52:43] and we're taking the word of god and
[52:46] sometimes we don't have the belief
[52:48] we don't have the faith that it is going
[52:52] to change our lives
[52:53] that the world is enough to change our
[52:58] lives
[53:00] and you can never see the effect the
[53:03] full effect of the word
[53:05] if you don't believe that the word can
[53:08] change you
[53:12] you can never
[53:15] the problem has never been with a word
[53:19] the problem has always been with us
[53:24] praise be to god tonight
[53:28] we are looking at the power
[53:32] of words i'm just using this
[53:36] as the basis of the platform
[53:42] because we can go into the word of god
[53:47] i mean we can go over and over and over
[53:49] there is no stop
[53:50] there's no place to stop when we come to
[53:53] what the word of god can do
[53:55] in the life of a man so
[53:59] that is not so much of the focus tonight
[54:04] because i believe we all know that
[54:08] i'm just using that as a platform
[54:11] to get to where i'm trusting to go
[54:15] tonight
[54:16] praise be to god now talking about the
[54:20] way the bible says heaven and earth
[54:21] shall pass away
[54:22] by the word of god would never pass away
[54:26] for the word to pass away is for god to
[54:30] pass away
[54:34] and if god cannot pass away
[54:38] then what it means is that the word
[54:40] cannot pass away
[54:49] god speaks in various ways
[54:55] and one of the surest way
[54:59] that god will speak to his children is
[55:02] through his word
[55:07] but a lot of the times that is not what
[55:10] we want
[55:12] a lot of the times we just want to see
[55:16] a miracle we just want to see signs
[55:20] we want to see wonders but these are
[55:24] things that the devil
[55:26] can impersonate the only thing the devil
[55:30] can never impersonate
[55:32] is the word
[55:37] and sometimes we come and god
[55:40] through the simplicity of his word speak
[55:43] to us
[55:44] and we are not satisfied
[55:49] there is nothing greater than the world
[55:54] if there are signs if there are wonders
[55:57] if there are miracles
[55:58] they will all fail the only thing
[56:02] that would never fail is the word
[56:10] but as i said tonight
[56:19] we'll be changing the course a little
[56:21] here
[56:26] a word we are told is thought
[56:30] expressed
[56:33] so before it becomes a word
[56:37] it must first be a thought
[56:42] the only time
[56:47] that this definition does not apply
[56:51] is when the holy ghost comes upon a man
[56:54] or a woman
[56:56] and takes control of that vessel and
[56:59] uses you
[57:00] to speak in an unknown language
[57:03] you don't even know what you are saying
[57:06] you never thought of it
[57:10] but you are speaking a language you
[57:12] don't even understand
[57:16] that is the only time
[57:20] that we don't meet this criteria but
[57:22] apart from that
[57:24] before anyone speaks
[57:28] it was first a thought
[57:34] i wouldn't say that now but god were
[57:36] those yes i will tell people
[57:40] that when somebody comes to you and they
[57:42] are drunk
[57:43] and they are speaking carelessly to you
[57:46] as if you can whip them with them very
[57:48] well
[57:53] of course i wouldn't tell you to do it
[57:54] now
[57:58] praise the lord
[58:01] when they come and they are drunk and
[58:02] they are talking listen to them
[58:04] maybe they'll say one thing that will be
[58:06] of a benefit to you
[58:12] because i have drunk before
[58:15] i used to drink drink will be the last
[58:18] thing i take for the night around 12
[58:20] midnight
[58:22] and the following morning before i even
[58:24] brush my teeth i'll go and drink again
[58:31] a very dangerous life
[58:34] we give god the glory
[58:37] praise be to god
[58:41] so before somebody comes to you and they
[58:43] say they are drunk
[58:44] and they are insulting you no they had
[58:47] you in mind
[58:48] before visiting the borough
[58:59] we are talking of the power
[59:03] of words
[59:08] someone and i spoke
[59:11] five years ago i don't remember even
[59:13] what i told them
[59:15] but they have not forgotten what i said
[59:18] to them
[59:22] words are powerful
[59:25] and if you know how powerful the words
[59:29] are
[59:30] you would pause before you say a word
[59:35] under every circumstance
[59:41] now in the book of genesis when you read
[59:45] about adam
[59:47] brother branham told us that adam would
[59:50] speak to the mountain
[59:53] just get up and move that way and the
[59:56] mountain would obey
[59:58] he would look at a tree he say i don't
[1:00:00] want you here i want you there
[1:00:03] and right from the roots it would have
[1:00:04] put itself and go and plant it where he
[1:00:06] wants it
[1:00:08] but when sin came he lost
[1:00:11] that authority over nature
[1:00:15] he lost that authority
[1:00:19] but look at it the bible makes us to
[1:00:23] understand
[1:00:25] that even though adam lost that
[1:00:27] authority that power
[1:00:29] he had to speak and this would happen
[1:00:31] even though he lost it
[1:00:33] you realize that man
[1:00:37] the worst we speak still has
[1:00:41] power in it
[1:00:44] praise be to god when we read
[1:00:49] from proverbs 20 proverbs 18 2021
[1:00:55] the bible says you can note it down
[1:00:59] normally because of time i just try to
[1:01:02] you know capture the things i can
[1:01:03] capture so we don't delay
[1:01:07] proverbs 18 20 21
[1:01:10] a man's belly shall be satisfied with
[1:01:14] the fruit of his mouth
[1:01:16] and with the increase of his lips
[1:01:19] shall he be filled death
[1:01:23] and life are in the power of the tongue
[1:01:28] and they that love it shall eat of the
[1:01:31] fruit thereof
[1:01:34] praise be to god so
[1:01:38] death and life
[1:01:41] are in the power of the tongue
[1:01:45] and what comes out of the tongue
[1:01:51] nothing but words
[1:01:54] whether we think we call it lyrics
[1:01:57] it's nothing but word
[1:02:01] whether you are blessing somebody it's
[1:02:03] word
[1:02:04] if you are cursing them it's weird
[1:02:10] if you're advising somebody admonishing
[1:02:12] them it's word
[1:02:14] so there is power in the tongue
[1:02:19] life and death
[1:02:22] rest in the power of the tongue
[1:02:32] there was a man
[1:02:36] that would come out and shout woof woof
[1:02:39] woof
[1:02:40] and the man will come out with their
[1:02:42] spears and then he will stand there and
[1:02:44] laugh and laugh and laugh
[1:02:47] and they will get angry and go back he
[1:02:50] doesn't he did that a few times
[1:02:53] and one day when he shouted woof woof
[1:02:56] actually there was a real wolf
[1:02:59] and the people said don't mind him he's
[1:03:01] up to his games again
[1:03:04] and that cost him his life
[1:03:12] the things that you speak with your
[1:03:15] mouth
[1:03:17] creates an atmosphere
[1:03:21] it creates a world that you live in
[1:03:26] if it is good you are living in it if it
[1:03:30] is bad you are living in it
[1:03:34] death and life rest in the power of the
[1:03:36] tongue
[1:03:37] and there that desire it will eat of the
[1:03:39] food thereof
[1:03:41] you will live in it you create that
[1:03:44] environment
[1:03:46] and then you live in if it is good
[1:03:49] you reap the benefit if it is bad
[1:03:52] there is a price to pay
[1:03:56] there is power in the ways we speak
[1:04:00] be careful what you say praise
[1:04:03] be to god
[1:04:09] first picture 310
[1:04:15] for he that love life
[1:04:18] and see good days let him refrain his
[1:04:22] tongue
[1:04:22] from evil and his lips that
[1:04:26] they speak no evil
[1:04:37] sometimes we think
[1:04:40] that it is only by the sword
[1:04:43] that a man can draw blood
[1:04:48] but you can also draw blood with a
[1:04:52] tongue
[1:04:58] i remember when i was small probably at
[1:05:01] the age of i don't remember maybe
[1:05:03] 14 15 i'm not sure
[1:05:06] i climbed a tree with a friend and he
[1:05:09] cut i don't know whether the right or
[1:05:10] the leg
[1:05:11] right or the left leg with a machete
[1:05:14] almost took my
[1:05:14] my leg off i got home i was scared to go
[1:05:18] home
[1:05:19] i waited outside for so long
[1:05:22] and when my mother saw me she almost
[1:05:24] passed out
[1:05:26] took me to 37 military hospital and i
[1:05:29] said no
[1:05:29] it was dried i couldn't stitch it
[1:05:32] but thank god it healed and sometimes
[1:05:36] i have to look for it to find it and
[1:05:38] even when i see it it doesn't mean
[1:05:40] anything to me
[1:05:42] it just reminds me oh that day i had
[1:05:45] that
[1:05:46] i had that cut
[1:05:49] and you can get a cut on the skin
[1:05:53] it heals so perfectly and you don't even
[1:05:56] see it after some time
[1:05:58] and even if you see it it doesn't even
[1:06:00] mean anything to you
[1:06:02] and sometimes it's so terrible you guys
[1:06:05] are how do they call it
[1:06:09] a plastic surgery
[1:06:12] and if they do a good job you can't even
[1:06:14] trace the injury anymore
[1:06:19] but it is not the same
[1:06:23] it is not the same
[1:06:27] when the tongue is used to slay
[1:06:31] a man because the tongue does not leave
[1:06:35] the scars on the outside
[1:06:38] there is no plastic surgery that can
[1:06:41] take care of that
[1:06:42] that that scar there is no medication
[1:06:46] that can take care of that scar
[1:06:50] that scar is in the inside
[1:06:53] it leaves a bleeding scar it will take
[1:06:57] only the holy ghost baptism to go
[1:07:00] inside there and to heal that scar
[1:07:04] and we take it out completely
[1:07:08] that even if it comes to mind all you
[1:07:10] just do is laugh and
[1:07:13] but there is no longer bitterness there
[1:07:16] is no longer hate
[1:07:18] why because that wound has been healed
[1:07:22] praise be to god
[1:07:26] the tongue is a very dangerous
[1:07:29] element of the body
[1:07:35] it can hack you into pieces
[1:07:39] and kill you while you are still living
[1:07:45] and if we appreciate some of these
[1:07:47] things
[1:07:49] how out we to be very very careful
[1:07:52] the things we say
[1:07:58] when i looked at those two scientific
[1:08:01] experiments i was talking about
[1:08:04] i will soon get there one thing just
[1:08:07] came into mind
[1:08:08] and that is why i am going with all this
[1:08:14] praise be to god
[1:08:17] that is why i am going with all this
[1:08:24] the tongue
[1:08:28] is a very dangerous element
[1:08:31] of the body and the bible talks about
[1:08:36] him
[1:08:46] now if we can read ten our bibles to
[1:08:50] james
[1:08:50] 3 1-12
[1:09:03] james 3 1-12
[1:09:11] okay my brethren
[1:09:16] be not many masters knowing that we
[1:09:19] shall receive
[1:09:20] the greater condemnation for
[1:09:23] in many things we offend all
[1:09:26] if any man or friend not in word
[1:09:30] the same is a perfect man and able also
[1:09:33] to bridle the whole body behold
[1:09:37] we put bits in horses maps that they may
[1:09:41] obey us
[1:09:42] and we turn about their whole body
[1:09:45] behold also the ships which
[1:09:48] though they be so great
[1:09:53] and are driven of fierce wings yet
[1:09:56] are they turned about with a very small
[1:09:59] helm
[1:10:00] wheresoever the governor listeneth
[1:10:04] even so the tongue
[1:10:07] is a little member and bosteth
[1:10:11] greatness behold
[1:10:14] how great a mara
[1:10:20] a little fire can can live
[1:10:24] and a tongue is a fire
[1:10:27] and a world of inequity soul
[1:10:30] is the tongue among our members
[1:10:34] that it defiles the whole body and set
[1:10:37] off on fire
[1:10:38] the cause of nature and
[1:10:41] it is set on fire of hell
[1:10:44] for every kind of beast and of bears and
[1:10:48] of serpents
[1:10:49] and of things in the sea is tamed
[1:10:53] and have been tamed by mankind but the
[1:10:56] tongue
[1:10:56] cannot maintain it is an unruly evil
[1:11:01] full of deadly poison dare with blessed
[1:11:04] be god
[1:11:05] even the father and therewith
[1:11:08] cast women which
[1:11:11] are made after the similitude of god
[1:11:15] out of the same mouth proceed of
[1:11:18] blessing and cursing my brethren
[1:11:22] these things ought not to be so
[1:11:25] do have a fountain sent forth
[1:11:29] sent forth at the same
[1:11:33] place sweet water and bitter can the fig
[1:11:37] tree
[1:11:38] my brethren bare olive olive berries
[1:11:42] either a vine fig salt
[1:11:47] so can no fountain both yield
[1:11:50] salt water and fresh
[1:11:53] water praise be to god
[1:11:59] just know you are children of god
[1:12:04] we are children of god once upon a time
[1:12:09] when the devil had possessed us and we
[1:12:11] didn't know who we were
[1:12:13] we could open our mouths and cast and
[1:12:16] say
[1:12:16] anything i remember one day i
[1:12:21] took dany's phone
[1:12:25] my goodness
[1:12:28] the phone was ringing
[1:12:31] and i wanted to mute i wanted to
[1:12:34] just kill it
[1:12:39] because it woke me up around 11
[1:12:43] and when i was trying pressing
[1:12:45] everything then i ended up answering the
[1:12:47] phone
[1:12:48] whoa my goodness
[1:12:53] the things i had within 5-10 seconds
[1:12:58] it was like an online community and i
[1:13:00] was trying to put it off
[1:13:02] i just tried it wasn't working
[1:13:06] so the following day i told the children
[1:13:08] i said nobody ever touched this phone
[1:13:09] again
[1:13:11] and i asked danny i said what community
[1:13:12] do you belong to
[1:13:15] i said that since i had on this phone in
[1:13:18] 5-10 seconds
[1:13:20] i said if they put you in a barrel of
[1:13:21] water for 10 weeks you never get clean
[1:13:30] wait words have effect
[1:13:36] that is why we ought to be very very
[1:13:38] very careful
[1:13:40] you see music god works a lot with music
[1:13:46] music is so important in every aspect of
[1:13:48] human life
[1:13:50] so important when somebody gives birth
[1:13:52] we play music
[1:13:53] when they die we play music
[1:13:56] when you are happy you play music when
[1:13:58] you are sad you play
[1:14:00] music when
[1:14:03] when soldiers go to work they play music
[1:14:07] music is so important
[1:14:10] and god uses music and the devil to use
[1:14:14] his music
[1:14:16] be careful what music you're listening
[1:14:18] to
[1:14:21] don't just sit down and when mommy or
[1:14:23] daddy is coming
[1:14:24] and then you try to no you're not
[1:14:26] pleasing
[1:14:27] you are not pleasing anybody
[1:14:37] i see people sitting in their cars and
[1:14:38] they are driving and you hear
[1:14:40] boom boom boom and they are sitting
[1:14:42] behind the car and just hitting their
[1:14:44] head like this
[1:14:45] and guess what very filthy music
[1:14:50] the devil comes behind that comes behind
[1:14:54] the lyrics
[1:14:55] those words of the music enters into the
[1:14:58] channel of your spirit
[1:14:59] gets into your soul and before long
[1:15:03] you don't even know who you are anymore
[1:15:12] there is power in the tongue
[1:15:16] and the scripture we just read tells us
[1:15:20] that a tongue is an unruly member of the
[1:15:22] body
[1:15:24] very boastful very arrogant
[1:15:28] it can set the whole city on fire
[1:15:35] and we we ought
[1:15:38] to be very very very careful
[1:15:42] because the bible says be not deceived
[1:15:46] evil communications corrupt
[1:15:49] good manners
[1:15:54] you can be in the same house with
[1:15:56] children they don't even know they are
[1:15:57] friends
[1:16:01] it's not those who are coming in and
[1:16:02] going out
[1:16:05] but facebook has created a different
[1:16:09] community for the young ones that are
[1:16:12] coming up
[1:16:15] and some who say on the phone tell it
[1:16:18] is bad time and they will tell one
[1:16:21] another good night good night
[1:16:23] and leave their force on till the
[1:16:26] following morning the first person that
[1:16:28] wakes up
[1:16:29] just goes back hi hi hello oh yes hello
[1:16:32] how was the morning oh how was the night
[1:16:34] and then they continue from where they
[1:16:35] left of the previous night
[1:16:44] and you come to church by the grace of
[1:16:47] god
[1:16:49] you listen to the word of god
[1:16:54] the word of god is working on you
[1:16:59] there is absolutely no way you will take
[1:17:02] in the word
[1:17:04] and the word would not work on you
[1:17:08] the other time the word will not have an
[1:17:10] effect in your life
[1:17:11] is when you resent it
[1:17:15] it doesn't matter the difficulties in
[1:17:17] your life
[1:17:18] it doesn't matter the storms it doesn't
[1:17:20] matter the problems
[1:17:21] if you can just open up and in the midst
[1:17:24] of it all
[1:17:25] still embrace the word the
[1:17:28] word would work on you
[1:17:35] but a lot of the times we're resented
[1:17:41] and once you resent it
[1:17:45] you get out there and the people the way
[1:17:48] they speak
[1:17:49] the things you guys talk about there
[1:17:53] let people know who you are never hide
[1:17:56] your identity
[1:17:58] let them know you are a christian there
[1:18:00] is no shame in it
[1:18:03] if you are ever ashamed of being a
[1:18:05] christian
[1:18:07] then you don't even have to come to
[1:18:08] church anymore
[1:18:12] let the people know what you stand for
[1:18:15] who you are
[1:18:16] and what you believe if they have to
[1:18:18] live let them live
[1:18:21] i remember one day i was sitting at work
[1:18:24] i came on break
[1:18:25] i was sitting on the table and then this
[1:18:27] muslim friend came
[1:18:29] we were sitting together my last name is
[1:18:30] ali
[1:18:33] so and at least it's a muslim name
[1:18:36] so this guy comes and he's sitting down
[1:18:39] and then there was something on the
[1:18:40] television
[1:18:42] where a man by name muhammad was cutting
[1:18:45] pork meat
[1:18:47] then he was looking at it they said ali
[1:18:49] i said yes
[1:18:50] have you seen what that man is doing
[1:18:51] that's what is he doing he is using the
[1:18:54] name of the prophet to cut pork meat
[1:19:01] then i didn't say anything he said see
[1:19:04] see what he's doing
[1:19:06] and the man actually is was a chef
[1:19:09] so they have this chef something
[1:19:13] on telly he was doing it and this guy
[1:19:15] was offended
[1:19:17] okay i didn't say anything i was just
[1:19:20] sitting down
[1:19:21] and then he turned to me now ali do you
[1:19:24] think you can do this
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:32] i told him i said i don't only touch it
[1:19:34] i eat it
[1:19:36] [Laughter]
[1:19:44] praise be to god and when i said that
[1:19:50] he dressed his food there are two tables
[1:19:53] some round table here another round one
[1:19:55] here he was sitting here i was sitting
[1:19:57] there
[1:19:58] and as soon as i said that he dressed
[1:20:00] his food to the edge
[1:20:02] and that was the last time he ever sat
[1:20:04] with me
[1:20:08] and guess what when he went and he was
[1:20:10] keeping company
[1:20:12] they were even eating pork in the
[1:20:13] stomach before they were they came out
[1:20:16] so what kind of hypocrisy is that that
[1:20:20] is pure hypocrisy
[1:20:22] but i was fine with it never try to
[1:20:25] please
[1:20:26] people let them know who you are what
[1:20:28] you stand for
[1:20:32] they have to go let them go don't try to
[1:20:35] please anybody because
[1:20:37] you want to find favor with them no
[1:20:40] know that you are a child of god
[1:20:47] don't let down your guards
[1:20:51] stand for the word
[1:20:55] they may have problems with you but they
[1:20:58] will tend to respect you
[1:21:02] praise be to god
[1:21:08] what are we talking about tonight the
[1:21:12] power
[1:21:14] of words
[1:21:17] know what the words are coming out of
[1:21:20] your mouth can do
[1:21:23] it can give life and you can also bring
[1:21:29] death
[1:21:30] as the bible says
[1:21:36] i had my idp yesterday with my manager
[1:21:39] and then he said ali
[1:21:42] you have humbled me in a lot of ways
[1:21:45] again
[1:21:46] i don't even remember
[1:21:49] that is the good thing i don't remember
[1:21:54] all i remember is that we've had several
[1:21:56] conversations
[1:21:57] on different things and we disagree on a
[1:22:00] lot of things not on a lot of things
[1:22:01] on some of the things and you could
[1:22:05] see the sincerity in his eyes
[1:22:14] you see people in the street you don't
[1:22:15] know what you're going through
[1:22:20] if you find something in your inner
[1:22:22] circles someone in your inner circles
[1:22:25] and you can encourage them seize that
[1:22:27] opportunity
[1:22:29] don't let it slip by it might be the
[1:22:32] only thing they are holding on to
[1:22:34] or they may be holding onto
[1:22:38] don't let it slip by
[1:22:42] it may be a word or true
[1:22:45] you may not know how far you have helped
[1:22:48] them
[1:22:49] but that is going to abide with them or
[1:22:51] stay with them for the rest of their
[1:22:53] lives
[1:23:00] anytime you hide your identity then you
[1:23:03] are ready to compromise on the word of
[1:23:04] god
[1:23:07] don't be like a chameleon
[1:23:10] it gets among the green grass it turns
[1:23:12] green
[1:23:15] it gets in the yellow yellow grass it
[1:23:17] turns yellow
[1:23:18] no don't be like a chameleon
[1:23:26] children of god are called to live a
[1:23:30] separate life
[1:23:33] god is interested
[1:23:37] in everything you are doing right down
[1:23:40] to the words that come
[1:23:41] out of your mouth god is interested in
[1:23:44] that
[1:23:45] as i said tonight um
[1:23:48] this i would say maybe some teaching um
[1:23:52] i don't know when i was just sitting
[1:23:55] behind the desk this morning
[1:23:57] i was just wondering it's like go and
[1:23:59] talk about something else
[1:24:01] but this was on my heart i said no we
[1:24:04] are not talking about anything
[1:24:05] we are going to talk about this praise
[1:24:08] be to god
[1:24:09] it may be for one person praise be to
[1:24:12] god
[1:24:14] yes the power
[1:24:19] of voice
[1:24:25] so as i said where's create an
[1:24:27] environment
[1:24:28] where you have to live in it if it's
[1:24:30] good you enjoy it if it's bad
[1:24:34] you have a price to pay and we should
[1:24:36] resist from negative confessions
[1:24:40] because when you say those things
[1:24:46] your body begins to adjust to it
[1:24:52] your body will begin to adjust to the
[1:24:55] negative conversions
[1:24:56] and we have to disease from it
[1:25:00] there is one tribe in ghana i have not
[1:25:02] mentioned their name
[1:25:03] if brother andrew was here he will know
[1:25:05] what i'm talking about
[1:25:07] nobody wants to fight them
[1:25:12] they are not easy to fight if you out if
[1:25:15] you never knew about them
[1:25:17] and then you were within their territory
[1:25:19] and when you're looking for a fight
[1:25:21] somebody will come and beg you please
[1:25:24] don't do it
[1:25:25] no don't fight i beg you they will beg
[1:25:27] you not to fight
[1:25:31] because it is an era where you are if
[1:25:33] you want to fight
[1:25:34] the old man and old woman will go and
[1:25:36] get their seat and come and sit down
[1:25:40] and then you will see people fighting
[1:25:43] if you are stronger than they are
[1:25:45] passing and you put them down
[1:25:47] i have seen places where you punch and
[1:25:50] punch
[1:25:50] and punch and the photo is bleeding and
[1:25:53] yet they are telling you
[1:25:54] when i get up you are dead
[1:25:59] praise be to god instead of
[1:26:02] shouting and shouting for help they are
[1:26:05] down
[1:26:06] they are bleeding they come brief and
[1:26:08] yet when i get up you are dead
[1:26:11] and you are beaten you will get tired
[1:26:13] when i get up
[1:26:14] you are dead and you know what
[1:26:17] the fellow that is beating will beat and
[1:26:20] beat
[1:26:21] and beat and now get tired and then the
[1:26:23] one that is beating is rather now
[1:26:25] shouting for help
[1:26:26] help help i mean how do you shout for
[1:26:29] help
[1:26:31] you are sitting on that person you are
[1:26:33] beating them
[1:26:35] they are so bloody and you are rather
[1:26:37] asking for help
[1:26:39] that means the tables are turning soon
[1:26:42] praise be to god let that be your story
[1:26:47] that when the devil gets you in the
[1:26:49] corner and then he is punching you
[1:26:51] and he thinks you are going to cry and
[1:26:53] then give up
[1:26:54] or throw in a towel tell the devil
[1:26:58] when i get up you are dead praise be to
[1:27:00] god
[1:27:03] yes
[1:27:06] praise be to god
[1:27:10] when i get up i will finish you
[1:27:14] and the devil will punch and punch and
[1:27:16] punch when i get up you are dead
[1:27:19] the devil will get confused what sort of
[1:27:21] human being is this
[1:27:23] and let it be told in those
[1:27:26] realms when any filthy demon is coming
[1:27:30] around you
[1:27:31] lest satan himself go through hey don't
[1:27:33] go there
[1:27:34] that guy is a rolling ball of fire don't
[1:27:36] go and look for trouble
[1:27:38] yes praise be to god
[1:27:44] oh my
[1:27:48] so because of that nobody looks for
[1:27:52] fight in that area
[1:27:56] you know better yes
[1:28:00] you may think you are small yes
[1:28:03] we are all small
[1:28:07] but in christ jesus
[1:28:11] we are all giants praise be to god
[1:28:16] you may think you have nothing to offer
[1:28:18] you have something to offer
[1:28:22] when you hear a voice telling you have
[1:28:23] nothing to offer that is the voice of
[1:28:25] the devil
[1:28:26] you have something to offer
[1:28:32] i don't know where the story is coming
[1:28:33] from but once upon a time there was this
[1:28:35] man
[1:28:35] very strong beating people all around in
[1:28:39] the vicinity
[1:28:41] and then he came before this man and was
[1:28:44] threatening this man
[1:28:45] and you know the wrong place
[1:28:52] the place the wrong place you can ever
[1:28:55] go and look for trouble
[1:28:56] is when a man is standing with his wife
[1:29:00] and are you going to tell that man if
[1:29:02] you joke i'll beat you
[1:29:06] if the man will die he will die
[1:29:10] he's not going to shame his wife the
[1:29:13] master no way
[1:29:15] if you joke will fight you think you're
[1:29:16] strong it's a if a joke i'll beat you
[1:29:20] they say you can't beat me then they
[1:29:21] started actually he put the man on the
[1:29:23] ground
[1:29:26] his wife just jumped inside the kitchen
[1:29:29] and went and took a saucepan
[1:29:35] and just came behind this strong man was
[1:29:37] hitting his head boom
[1:29:40] boom and when the man put his hand dead
[1:29:43] then his husband flipped him over
[1:29:46] and now he was on the ground and when he
[1:29:49] held the man
[1:29:49] trying to flip you over the woman came
[1:29:52] on the side with a saucepan
[1:29:53] on his elbow boom weakened it wicked
[1:29:56] this one here
[1:29:58] hit him on the knees weaken him
[1:30:01] the man became like um
[1:30:05] how did they call it letters that has
[1:30:08] been left in the sun
[1:30:13] yes praise be to god
[1:30:17] you might be that woman with a saucepan
[1:30:20] when the devil comes you may be that
[1:30:23] woman who jumps into the kitchen for the
[1:30:25] saucepan
[1:30:27] praise be to god and when you come
[1:30:29] you're going to do a lot of damage
[1:30:32] don't think that your prayer is not
[1:30:34] going your prayer goes somewhere
[1:30:37] when you pray and you believe you will
[1:30:39] see the glory of god
[1:30:42] when we come wednesday's night wednesday
[1:30:45] nights and we come and we are praying
[1:30:47] in fact if god would open your eyes to
[1:30:50] see what that prayer is doing
[1:30:52] you will be forever thankful to god
[1:30:56] god answers prayer god
[1:30:59] answers prayer the little prayer you may
[1:31:03] say
[1:31:04] you may think it's literal it's the
[1:31:07] quality as brother ryan said
[1:31:09] not the quantity the quality of that
[1:31:11] prayer
[1:31:13] and god comes behind those words
[1:31:16] and then he does something that blows
[1:31:18] your mind
[1:31:21] when the devil comes just jump into the
[1:31:25] kitchen sink
[1:31:27] get the saucepan and chase him out
[1:31:32] praise be to god
[1:31:45] amen so
[1:31:48] now to this scientific experiment
[1:31:52] it's nine already it's nine o'clock
[1:31:56] to this scientific experiment
[1:32:01] when i looked at it what just came into
[1:32:04] mind
[1:32:05] was the family unit
[1:32:10] father mother and the kids
[1:32:14] that was what came into mind
[1:32:19] you may say oh i am i am a young sister
[1:32:22] i'm a young brother i'm not married yet
[1:32:24] but you are a potential mother you are a
[1:32:26] potential sister
[1:32:27] ah father it's just a matter of time
[1:32:34] the babies are on their way it's just a
[1:32:36] matter of time
[1:32:38] praise be to god no i was thinking about
[1:32:42] it
[1:32:45] in the home
[1:32:48] when a child does something
[1:32:51] hey you are this you are that you are
[1:32:53] this the next time they do it you are
[1:32:56] this you are that you are that
[1:32:57] the next time you are on it
[1:33:01] those words have a terrible effect
[1:33:06] on the child
[1:33:10] one time danny told me my son then he
[1:33:11] told me that i am a slow learner i said
[1:33:14] don't say it in this house
[1:33:19] i said who told you i slow elena that is
[1:33:21] jesus i said never say that in this
[1:33:23] house you are not a slow leona
[1:33:27] when you keep saying those negative
[1:33:29] things
[1:33:30] those insults you keep pounding the
[1:33:32] children
[1:33:33] with it you don't know how
[1:33:37] terrible how dangerous you are just
[1:33:40] destroying them
[1:33:41] and you don't know it
[1:33:44] it is not only when somebody stands and
[1:33:47] they catch somebody no
[1:33:51] but those words those hard words those
[1:33:54] dangerous ways
[1:33:55] those essels they'll go a long way
[1:34:01] to destroy the children
[1:34:06] and then they get to a point you have to
[1:34:08] spend the rest of your life
[1:34:10] praying for the errors you have
[1:34:16] committed
[1:34:18] there was a single mother i didn't
[1:34:21] verify this story so i don't mention his
[1:34:22] name but his name
[1:34:24] isn't mine that when the other mothers
[1:34:28] were cursing their children
[1:34:32] and insulting them every single time for
[1:34:34] not doing the right thing
[1:34:35] he will catch his little boy and then he
[1:34:38] will whip him
[1:34:39] when i say whip it looks like 20 30 40
[1:34:42] years ago right
[1:34:43] because now in america i don't think you
[1:34:44] can do that
[1:34:46] but that was very easy to do at some
[1:34:48] point i believe in ito
[1:34:55] my boss one time asked me dan have you
[1:34:57] ever yelled
[1:34:58] at your children i said when they need
[1:35:02] it i give it to them
[1:35:08] praise be to god and when he is whipping
[1:35:12] his boy
[1:35:13] you're with me wow mommy i'm sorry sir
[1:35:16] i i bless you in the name of jesus what
[1:35:19] i bless you in the name of jesus what
[1:35:22] you don't go away what what you'll be a
[1:35:26] good boy what
[1:35:28] and the child has grown to be a man
[1:35:32] and his name is a household name as i
[1:35:35] said i have not verified it
[1:35:37] but from the east to the western of this
[1:35:39] country
[1:35:40] if you mention that name everybody knows
[1:35:42] him
[1:35:46] the power of words
[1:35:52] this never did you mention some names
[1:35:56] oh okay it it sounded very close
[1:36:00] to the name very very close i thought
[1:36:03] okay so i'll just also keep it
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:09] yes so the power of voice
[1:36:16] even when the children make mistakes
[1:36:19] they can press your button they are good
[1:36:23] at that
[1:36:27] and when they are pressing it
[1:36:30] most of the times they press at the
[1:36:32] wrong time
[1:36:36] and then they can get you so wet up
[1:36:39] you don't have to go to the gym
[1:36:49] and you go to the gym and you are
[1:36:51] working out and
[1:36:52] if you're not feeling any pain it's not
[1:36:54] helping you
[1:36:56] but when you begin to feel the pain and
[1:36:59] you're still pushing through
[1:37:01] there's something good is happening a
[1:37:04] lot of the times when the children push
[1:37:06] your buttons
[1:37:07] the easiest way to go is to yell or to
[1:37:10] shout
[1:37:11] and that is carrying you nowhere with
[1:37:13] god
[1:37:14] but if you can just bear it
[1:37:18] if you can just bear that pain and push
[1:37:20] it through
[1:37:21] and do something else instead of
[1:37:24] insulting and using hard words
[1:37:28] you'll be getting some way not just with
[1:37:30] the children
[1:37:31] but you'll be getting somewhere with god
[1:37:36] praise be to god there is power
[1:37:39] in words the ways you speak to the
[1:37:43] children
[1:37:45] the words you speak
[1:37:48] to one another in the home it
[1:37:51] creates an atmosphere in the house
[1:37:54] that when people walk in
[1:37:58] they are blessed
[1:38:03] praise be to god
[1:38:07] is eight minutes after
[1:38:11] nine and i have
[1:38:16] um
[1:38:22] okay so all right
[1:38:26] i know i still have a little time but um
[1:38:29] i want but i want to come over maybe in
[1:38:32] the next five minutes or so so i
[1:38:33] wouldn't take much of your time
[1:38:35] yeah so just be mindful
[1:38:41] children would always be children
[1:38:47] the fact that you have said something 10
[1:38:50] or 20 times doesn't mean it should work
[1:38:58] yes
[1:39:04] so it's all i've been saying it all the
[1:39:06] time
[1:39:10] and nothing is happening that means you
[1:39:13] have to say it more
[1:39:19] if we can just refrain or desist
[1:39:26] the bible says do not let your anger
[1:39:28] lead you to sin
[1:39:32] you can cut yourself on a break
[1:39:37] and instead of the yelling and the
[1:39:38] shouting which would not help
[1:39:40] it will not do anything
[1:39:44] there is power in love
[1:39:47] there is no power in hate
[1:39:52] yes
[1:39:56] and if we can do things differently
[1:40:02] do things differently take insults out
[1:40:05] of the equation
[1:40:08] those hard words out of the equation let
[1:40:11] love project and just do normal talking
[1:40:17] and let love be seen
[1:40:21] let love project out of those ways
[1:40:25] it's going to change the situation
[1:40:30] it's going to change the situation
[1:40:39] my next the next thing i was going to
[1:40:42] talk about here
[1:40:43] was thought we said word
[1:40:46] is thought expressed
[1:40:52] now thoughts
[1:40:57] our thoughts are equally very
[1:41:01] very strong
[1:41:08] i'm not talking about waste now
[1:41:12] but the thoughts in other words
[1:41:16] it has not manifested itself into
[1:41:20] a word yet but it is right here
[1:41:25] in chapters in paragraphs
[1:41:29] it's right here and they are equally
[1:41:33] very very powerful
[1:41:39] nobody can look at you and tell what you
[1:41:42] are thinking about
[1:41:43] or what you have in your mind it will
[1:41:46] take the prophet of god to descend your
[1:41:47] thoughts
[1:41:50] but based on what thought you have
[1:41:54] you can't stop thoughts from coming
[1:41:59] it's like the prophet said you can't
[1:42:02] stop a bed from flying over your head
[1:42:04] but you can't stop it from coming to sit
[1:42:06] on your head
[1:42:10] but when the thought comes
[1:42:14] and then you begin to nurture it
[1:42:18] it's like you're putting a plant in the
[1:42:20] soil
[1:42:21] and you are giving it water you are
[1:42:23] giving it fertilizer
[1:42:24] you are giving it all that is necessary
[1:42:27] for it to grow
[1:42:29] that is what happens when you begin to
[1:42:32] nurture
[1:42:32] a thought and if the thought is not
[1:42:35] right
[1:42:36] if it's evil before long
[1:42:39] you begin to act
[1:42:44] according to the thoughts you have
[1:42:48] the bible says of the abundance of the
[1:42:50] heart
[1:42:51] the mouth speaketh
[1:42:58] so people don't know what you have in
[1:43:00] your mind because you have not spoken
[1:43:04] but i thought you have
[1:43:09] people can see it in your action
[1:43:12] and it either draws them close
[1:43:15] or it sends them running away
[1:43:19] based on what thought it is
[1:43:25] so not only are we supposed to watch the
[1:43:28] things we say
[1:43:29] we also have to watch the thoughts that
[1:43:31] come into our minds
[1:43:34] do not entertain it
[1:43:38] if it is not according to the world do
[1:43:41] not
[1:43:41] entertain it if you know that it is
[1:43:44] something that is displeasing
[1:43:46] to god do not entertain it
[1:43:49] if you know that it is evil
[1:43:59] in fact i just have to bring the curtain
[1:44:01] down here
[1:44:04] what i'm left with just half a page um
[1:44:08] i would just i think it's a very good
[1:44:10] place to stop
[1:44:12] so what are we talking about the power
[1:44:15] of words
[1:44:20] the power of words
[1:44:23] learn to think before you speak
[1:44:29] and when the thought comes before you
[1:44:32] speak
[1:44:34] put it on a scale
[1:44:38] weigh what you are going to say
[1:44:42] weigh it
[1:44:45] so you don't have to say something
[1:44:48] people say
[1:44:49] a word is like a bullet when you fire it
[1:44:51] it goes and it never comes back
[1:44:53] that is true but i think in some sense
[1:44:57] pressing the trigger is even better than
[1:44:59] the word
[1:45:00] that comes out of your my 50 if it is
[1:45:02] not right
[1:45:05] because with the bullet you may miss the
[1:45:08] target
[1:45:11] but if it is the wrong word that comes
[1:45:13] out of your mouth
[1:45:15] it goes out it's right on target
[1:45:20] that is a dangerous thing to do
[1:45:25] if you can use your words to empower
[1:45:27] somebody
[1:45:28] if you can use your words to encourage
[1:45:30] somebody if you can
[1:45:32] use your words to bring sunshine in
[1:45:34] somebody's life of darkness
[1:45:36] if you can use your words to bring
[1:45:38] healing to somebody
[1:45:40] if you can use your words to give hope
[1:45:41] to somebody why would you want
[1:45:44] to do otherwise
[1:45:49] there is a lot of power in the tongue
[1:45:53] and we can use it for a lot of good
[1:45:56] things
[1:46:00] praise be to god in fact i just have to
[1:46:04] end here
[1:46:05] god bless you for this time of
[1:46:08] fellowship brother one
[1:46:10] musicians you can please come over
[1:46:14] as i turn i sat 10 over the property one
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:50] [Music]
[1:46:52] uh
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:05] let's pray together heavenly father dear
[1:47:08] lord we want to thank you
[1:47:10] thank you precious lord father for your
[1:47:13] word of god
