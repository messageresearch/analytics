[48:20] take I'm taking I'm taking the thought
[48:22] tonight and uh uh I want to labor a
[48:26] little bit on on overcomers overcomer
[48:29] overcoming. Brother Brandon preached a
[48:31] message uh uh what it takes to overcome
[48:36] all unbelief. He said is our faith. He
[48:39] says uh uh that's what it takes to
[48:42] overcome all unbelief. Then he also
[48:45] preached the message how can I overcome.
[48:48] Now so this evening I just want to uh uh
[48:52] as I trust that the Lord will be able to
[48:54] help. We want to just uh uh uh be able
[48:58] to go in that direction tonight a little
[49:01] bit. I just want to show you something
[49:03] and uh uh I pray that it be is a
[49:07] blessing to you. Amen. Amen. I pray that
[49:10] is a blessing to you. Now, uh, uh, man,
[49:14] if you can pull my image up, please
[49:16] bring my pointer.
[49:18] Amen. Bring my pointer.
[49:21] It's 8:15.
[49:27] I have 45 minutes to preach. If I can
[49:31] become a successful preacher, successful
[49:34] preacher preach in 45 minutes. Amen.
[49:37] never been successful.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[49:47] Brother Brandon committed brother
[49:49] Neville and uh and he said he or he
[49:52] brother Brandon was never a successful
[49:54] preacher because he couldn't preach in
[49:55] 45 minutes. When you listen to some of
[49:57] brother Neville messages, he was able to
[50:00] just stay around the circumference of 45
[50:03] 50 and all there. Can you put my image
[50:06] up? Are we able to
[50:09] in the second?
[50:13] If you go down, it's not part of it.
[50:18] It just gives you a link.
[50:22] What have I done?
[50:25] What in the world have I done?
[50:28] Praise the Lord. Let me let me just see
[50:31] here. U
[50:35] this is that we have used before uh
[50:38] Emmanuel. So uh it should be in our
[50:48] Oh, I see what happened here.
[50:55] I see what happened here.
[50:59] Let me try this again.
[51:06] Let me try again. See if
[51:09] when I look in my
[51:13] I look in my
[51:29] Okay,
[51:31] we will still we can still refer to
[51:34] that. Uh
[51:40] I see exactly what's what's going on.
[51:44] So yeah, uh
[51:50] when we uh when you if you remember, we
[51:54] were talking uh uh one time and I was
[51:57] showing you those images that I said I
[52:00] will come back to.
[52:03] And uh the one that had
[52:07] the
[52:12] it had
[52:16] Okay, man. I've just sent that again.
[52:18] So, I hope it went uh
[52:26] Okay. Yeah, I think you should have it
[52:28] now.
[52:30] You'll soon remember the the one with
[52:32] the paramed and then it had the the the
[52:34] the
[52:36] red the
[52:39] the beast on one side and then the
[52:42] living creatures on the other side.
[52:44] That's what I'm trying to refer to
[52:46] tonight. Praise the Lord.
[52:49] Now, so uh uh when you when you look at
[52:54] that image,
[52:56] uh
[52:58] we uh
[53:04] we were trying to uh you bring it up.
[53:07] Just just pay attention to me. Let's
[53:09] let's just read uh let's let's just read
[53:11] an introduction here. Okay, I think you
[53:14] got it. Let's just read an introduction
[53:15] here and see what brother Brandham said
[53:17] in a message. How can I overcome? He
[53:20] said this. He said, now I choose this
[53:23] because that I think that is a time that
[53:26] we should never let the spirit of
[53:29] revival die. Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He said we must never let the spirit of
[53:33] revival die. So which mean in a sense
[53:36] that we have to overcome. Now you have
[53:38] to remember the subject he's teaching us
[53:40] here is how we can overcome. It does not
[53:44] matter what you have to overcome. It's
[53:47] how you overcome it. Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The devil can come in
[53:52] in in every way. I mean, he he's just
[53:54] changing his max, but he will always
[53:57] come the same way he have ever come.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will always come the same way
[54:04] he have ever come. So no matter how he
[54:06] come, if you know uh how to overcome,
[54:10] you will overcome him. Every word, any
[54:13] time, under any condition, any disguise,
[54:17] you will overcome the devil.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; If you know how to overcome.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Now uh uh uh uh in uh uh Matthew chapter
[54:26] 4, Brother Brandon will let us know that
[54:29] Jesus overcame the devil by saying, "It
[54:31] is written." Amen. He overcame the devil
[54:35] by pointing to the word.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; He overcame the devil by pointing to the
[54:42] word and say it is written. And Satan
[54:44] comes back also and say it is also
[54:47] written.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will give his angels charge
[54:50] over you. So I mean he's challenging the
[54:52] Lord with uh but let's look into the
[54:56] church ages and see how how that we
[54:59] overcame. How how are we overcoming?
[55:02] Because what I'm going to show you is
[55:04] not something that uh uh we we we we are
[55:09] learning to do. It's something that we
[55:11] are already doing.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; It's something that we are already doing
[55:17] because uh the way we overcame over the
[55:21] in the church ages uh is play out in
[55:25] symbols.
[55:27] In the church ages is play out in
[55:29] symbol. But we are living the reality.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to show you
[55:37] tonight. Let's uh throw my image up,
[55:39] please.
[55:42] Amen.
[55:44] So yeah, this is this is what I wanted
[55:46] to show you. I told you that we will
[55:48] come back to this. There there's a whole
[55:50] lot that is around here that I want for
[55:52] us to to to deal with a little bit.
[55:55] Amen. Last Wednesday we read from the
[55:58] book of Ephesians uh uh uh Paul says the
[56:02] weapons of our warfare are not cannon.
[56:04] He says we are not fighting against
[56:06] flesh and blood but we are fighting
[56:09] against principalities and spiritual
[56:11] wickedness in high places. So this dark
[56:15] image here is is is an evil power is is
[56:19] a is a is a is a is a representation of
[56:23] the of of from the bottomless pit. It's
[56:26] a representation of uh a a a a dark
[56:30] smoke uh uh uh you know that is coming
[56:33] out of the bottomless pit.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Now you you'll see that over and over in
[56:38] uh in the prayer line. Brother Brandham
[56:40] will always identify demon power as a
[56:43] dark shadow. He says, "I see a dark
[56:45] shadow hanging over you." Amen. I have
[56:48] one of those picture in my in my office.
[56:50] I printed it for the reason. I will use
[56:52] it when when it's time now. So, so this
[56:56] is a a dark shadow representing the evil
[57:00] power representing demon powers that is
[57:03] streaming out of hell uh to attack the
[57:06] church. Now, you have to remember this.
[57:09] Now, this is a representation of the
[57:12] church
[57:14] because
[57:15] when the image that Daniel saw was hit
[57:19] in the legs, when it fell, the Bible
[57:22] says a great mountain
[57:24] &gt;&gt; grew up to that place.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; So that great mountain was the church.
[57:33] The image was representing the political
[57:36] powers.
[57:38] It was representing Bab Babylon, the
[57:41] head of gold and and and and the M. And
[57:45] so all the political powers that was
[57:48] going to be ruling the ages uh uh the
[57:51] Gentile kingdom was represented in that
[57:54] image that Daniel saw. But when the
[57:58] stone hit the image in his foot, the
[58:01] Bible says a a mountain grew. Yeah.
[58:05] Now, so if you go to Christ in is
[58:08] revealing his own word, that's what
[58:10] brother Brandham says God started
[58:11] building his church from the from the
[58:13] feet up
[58:16] because in the feet age, which was the
[58:18] first church age, that was where great
[58:20] missionary work is done. He said when it
[58:24] came to the Pentecostal age, it was the
[58:26] tongue age. So God gave them the gift of
[58:29] tongue. He says when you get to the
[58:32] tongue that is the mouth. Next to the
[58:34] tongue is the intelligence.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; It's the intelligence. So we are in the
[58:43] age of the intelligence. Praise the
[58:45] Lord. We will get to all of that. But
[58:48] this is where we want to dwarf. I'm just
[58:50] I'm just trying to bring you into the
[58:51] picture of what I want to talk about
[58:53] tonight. So this this image represent
[58:55] the church.
[58:57] Are we together? Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; And uh uh uh all of this will represent
[59:03] each age of the church. We will we will
[59:07] get there.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] So uh uh uh but tonight we we we we want
[59:20] to look at what uh brother Brandon
[59:24] telling us here is that the reason why
[59:26] he said he taught this subject about
[59:29] overcoming is so we can know how to keep
[59:32] the spirit of revival.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; How to keep the spirit of revival. He
[59:38] says that it will never the spirit of
[59:40] revival will not die. We have got to
[59:42] keep in revival constantly.
[59:46] We have to keep in revival constantly.
[59:49] Revive
[59:51] every day. Paul say I I had to die daily
[59:55] that Christ should live.
[59:59] And we must never let that revival die
[1:00:04] in us.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the church revival.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; The revival must never die in us.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can have a lot going on
[1:00:23] around us, but the revival, the revival
[1:00:27] of the word must never die in us.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must never let the spirit of
[1:00:37] revival die. He says here,
[1:00:43] we find here that God has always had
[1:00:47] overcomers.
[1:00:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; God has always have overcomers.
[1:00:56] He had overcomers in every age. So in
[1:00:59] the seven church ages, we will read he
[1:01:03] that overcome.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He that overcome. Now you have to
[1:01:11] remember now you go back there. I mean
[1:01:14] my Bible is open here. So let me be let
[1:01:16] me be very clear before I I say
[1:01:19] something there uh uh that I shouldn't
[1:01:23] say. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You go right over
[1:01:29] uh to the to the first church ages. The
[1:01:32] first church age. Sorry. And uh uh uh
[1:01:36] the Bible says, "He that have an ear,
[1:01:38] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[1:01:40] the church, to him that overcometh."
[1:01:44] Now uh uh I'm I'm repeating this because
[1:01:49] it is not saying to him that will
[1:01:52] overcome.
[1:01:55] It's saying to him that overcometh.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because
[1:02:00] the overcoming is already done.
[1:02:05] Amen. That's why Jesus said, "Be of a
[1:02:09] good chill
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; because I have overcome the word."
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be of a good child." Rejoice.
[1:02:23] Rejoice. So, so what we're doing is that
[1:02:26] as believers when when we recognize the
[1:02:29] word, we recognize the message of our
[1:02:32] age and we come and receive the message,
[1:02:35] what we're doing is that we are
[1:02:37] rejoicing in his overcoming.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; We are identifying with his overcoming.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you can you can think about
[1:02:55] the quote brother Brandham says, "Oh
[1:02:57] yeah, you know, God is not going to
[1:02:59] bring you through a tube and and take
[1:03:01] you on the other side." And he says, "He
[1:03:03] that overcome the word, you have
[1:03:04] something to overcome." All of that is
[1:03:07] truth. All of that is the word. But the
[1:03:09] the truth about the matter there is that
[1:03:12] is him that overcome it.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I don't care how hard
[1:03:19] you try. If you are not having a good
[1:03:23] chill, if you are not rejoicing that he
[1:03:26] has overcometh overcome the word, you
[1:03:29] are not going to overcome.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh
[1:03:40] uh he says uh we we have had overcomers
[1:03:43] in every age. Uh there always been every
[1:03:46] time in every age that there has been on
[1:03:49] earth, God has God has always have
[1:03:53] somebody he could put his hands on.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody he could put his hands on. And
[1:04:02] you know what he's doing? He's putting
[1:04:05] his hands on me and you and picking us
[1:04:09] by the column
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; and lifting us up.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; He's putting us, grabbing us by the
[1:04:19] collar
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; and putting us over all the trials, all
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I've overcome the word.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; He's taking us over all the cosmos of
[1:04:31] the word.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; You know what? If I remind you that if
[1:04:39] we will make it, it has to be all in
[1:04:41] him. Yes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You have to grow in a faith where you
[1:04:45] know that all is in him.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It is him that have done it.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; So that's what I'm trying to bring you
[1:04:55] here tonight. So he says here, God has
[1:04:58] always have somebody he could put his
[1:04:59] hand on as a witness in the earth. He
[1:05:02] never has been without a witness.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No matter how bad the age is,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; no matter how polluted, how sinful, how
[1:05:12] backsliding the people are, God will
[1:05:15] always have a witness.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; There will always be somebody God will
[1:05:21] raise up in that generation
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; as someone that believe his word.
[1:05:26] Somebody that fully trusted in him.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; He has never been without a witness.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Though sometime just one
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; but somebody overcome.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody overcome.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling like an overcomer
[1:05:52] tonight?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel like it, you have to
[1:05:57] believe it.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Believe it until you start to feel like
[1:06:02] it. Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh he said this. I'm going to
[1:06:09] use this as my principle that I want to
[1:06:11] use to go into what I'm what I want to
[1:06:14] go into to again he says in the message
[1:06:16] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[1:06:19] our faith. He says, "Now
[1:06:23] all redemptive blessing to us,
[1:06:28] the human race was paid for for us at
[1:06:32] Calvary."
[1:06:34] When Jesus died for us, he said it was
[1:06:38] finished. Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "God paid for every
[1:06:43] redemptive blessing. Whatever you will
[1:06:45] enjoy
[1:06:47] in this life
[1:06:50] in your body, in your your health, in
[1:06:53] your faith, whatever you will enjoy. It
[1:06:57] will not you will not enjoy it because
[1:06:59] you have a better preacher that now
[1:07:01] makes the message simple to you. You
[1:07:04] will not enjoy it because your life
[1:07:06] status has changed. You will enjoy it
[1:07:09] because it was paid for.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was paid for at Calvary.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now he says that it was uh
[1:07:22] when when when when he when Jesus died
[1:07:25] for us, we believe
[1:07:28] that the works and the complete plan of
[1:07:32] God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Every redemptive blessing was completed
[1:07:38] at Calvary. Do you believe that?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, say amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Let it be your confession tonight. Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; We believe that the works and that the
[1:07:50] complete plan of redemption, every
[1:07:52] redemptive blessing was completed at
[1:07:54] Calvary. That all of God's promises was
[1:07:59] made possible. Everything that God
[1:08:02] promised when from from Genesis 1, every
[1:08:05] seed would bring forth of his kind. It
[1:08:08] was made possible.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Because of Calvary.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman will bruise the
[1:08:18] head of the serpent was made possible
[1:08:21] because of Calvary.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Every promises. Now
[1:08:28] follow me now. You got to follow me. It
[1:08:31] says every promises
[1:08:33] all that all of God's promises was made
[1:08:37] possible to every human being that will
[1:08:41] accept it.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; When
[1:08:46] are we together?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Are we accepting? When Jesus died to
[1:08:52] clear the human before God at Calvary, I
[1:08:57] believe that every man
[1:09:02] I believe that every man in the world
[1:09:05] was saved when Jesus died at Calvary.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Every sick person in the world was
[1:09:12] healed.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; When Jesus died at Calvary.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; But now it's a finished work.
[1:09:23] Now, the thing to do is,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; can we get the people to see it?
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; It's already done, but can we get the
[1:09:34] people
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; to see it?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; And accept it.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6.
[1:09:49] Revelation chapter 6.
[1:09:57] I would get him.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Put Put the image back up for me,
[1:10:05] Emmanuel. Thank you. Revelation chapter
[1:10:08] 6. We read from verse one. Let the image
[1:10:11] stay up and uh I will do the reading.
[1:10:14] And I saw
[1:10:18] when the lamb opened one of the seal,
[1:10:23] and I heard
[1:10:26] as it was a noise of thunder,
[1:10:29] and one of the four beasts,
[1:10:34] which is one of these,
[1:10:36] one of these of the four beasts is
[1:10:39] supposed to be uh the living creatures,
[1:10:41] but one of these four beasts
[1:10:45] Are we together?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; One of the four beasts saying,
[1:10:52] "Come and what?"
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the four beasts saying, "I
[1:10:59] want you to tell me what the four bees
[1:11:01] is saying." One of the four be saying,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; "Come and see." I want you to say it.
[1:11:07] One of the four B saying,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; "Come and see. come and see because
[1:11:12] that's where we are tonight. Now
[1:11:14] remember that remember brother Brandham
[1:11:16] says everything was already paid for.
[1:11:21] Everything is a finished work but if we
[1:11:25] can only get the people to do what?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; To see it.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; To see it.
[1:11:37] Amen. Now, so I'm I'm trying to show
[1:11:41] show you how we overcame how how we
[1:11:44] overcome.
[1:11:47] How we overcome. What's the principle?
[1:11:50] That's what I'm trying to show you
[1:11:51] tonight. I don't want it to go over your
[1:11:53] head. Now, let's let's read on a little
[1:11:55] bit. I'll come back. One of the four be
[1:11:57] saying, "Come and see. And I saw and
[1:12:00] behold a white horse." This is this this
[1:12:03] one now. Amen. I saw a white horse,
[1:12:08] and he that sat on him had a bow, and a
[1:12:13] crown was given unto him, and he went
[1:12:17] forth conquering
[1:12:20] and to conquer. Now when this evil power
[1:12:26] was go was was was traveling
[1:12:29] and trying to conquer the church, it
[1:12:32] first started by arresting Peter and
[1:12:35] John and then they whip them in the
[1:12:37] public place. They said never speak in
[1:12:39] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Then it went down again to grab John and
[1:12:46] they killed him and it went down again.
[1:12:50] Uh so this evil power was moving. It was
[1:12:52] it was conquering little by little. We
[1:12:54] talk about the church of Thessalica
[1:12:56] coming under persecution. It was it was
[1:12:59] all under this this uh h white house
[1:13:02] that was that was that was that was you
[1:13:04] know taking up his heels and beginning
[1:13:06] to run.
[1:13:08] Now listen now.
[1:13:11] How do we overcome?
[1:13:14] The Bible says here, one of the four
[1:13:17] beasts,
[1:13:19] which is the anointing that was in that
[1:13:23] age.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And the anointing was the move of God.
[1:13:30] The anointing was the power of God.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh
[1:13:42] praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go back again to uh Revelation
[1:13:48] 6:1. Don't change the image, leave the
[1:13:50] image up. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; You can write it down and read it. The
[1:13:53] Bible says, "And
[1:13:56] and I saw when the L Now, so there is
[1:14:00] there is uh there is there is uh another
[1:14:04] uh uh uh
[1:14:07] another player. Let me let me say it
[1:14:09] like that. Another person in the whole
[1:14:11] strip here is the lamb.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; When the lamb opened the book,
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; So here we have
[1:14:23] one of the four beats. Here we have the
[1:14:28] white
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; the white house. Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; With bow and no arrow. Yeah,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; we have the
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; the beast.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But
[1:14:44] before we saw the beast,
[1:14:48] before we saw the white house,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; okay,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; what do we see?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; That's That's right. John said, "When I
[1:14:57] saw the lamb,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; are we together?"
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I saw the lamb, who is the
[1:15:04] lamb?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; The one that say I have overcome the
[1:15:10] word
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; be of a good chair.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He is the lamb of God.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; The first person you must see is who?
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; The lamb.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; That's that is the that is the guy that
[1:15:26] is that is particular and major in the
[1:15:28] whole thing. It's not the it's not the
[1:15:31] beast. It's not the living creature.
[1:15:34] It's not the anointing. It's not the the
[1:15:36] the the white horse, the a bow and no
[1:15:39] arrow. The first person you should see
[1:15:42] when John introduced, he said, "And I
[1:15:46] saw the lamb."
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb in your trials?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the lamb with things that
[1:15:57] are happening around you? Or are you
[1:16:00] seeing the devil power? Or are you
[1:16:03] seeing the anointing which is maybe we
[1:16:06] go to church, I feel good, I feel the
[1:16:08] presence of God, but are you seeing the
[1:16:10] land?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; How to overcome?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; How to overcome
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; whatever you are dealing with. The first
[1:16:23] thing how to overcome
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; the first thing you must see is the
[1:16:28] lamb. Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; John said, "And I saw the lamb."
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; What did the lamb do? Open.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; The lamb open. So it is what the lamb
[1:16:52] open that is now going to show us what
[1:16:56] is happening.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And until the lamb open your eyes, you
[1:17:04] will never see what is happening.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; You will never see what God what God is
[1:17:10] doing in your life or why God is alive.
[1:17:13] You will not see it.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Isaiah says, "They have eyes, but they
[1:17:18] can't see."
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the lamb did not open.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; How to overcome.
[1:17:29] how to keep the revival.
[1:17:33] I saw the lamb
[1:17:35] open
[1:17:37] one of the seals.
[1:17:39] Amen.
[1:17:43] And I heard as it was a noise of
[1:17:47] thunder.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; All of those are are beautiful.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; We can get in there and start to and
[1:17:54] start to What is the thunder? The
[1:17:56] thunder is a voice of God. We can get in
[1:17:58] there and start and start and start uh
[1:18:00] you know getting into all of that. But
[1:18:02] what I want to get to you tonight is
[1:18:04] this. I heard as it were a noise of a
[1:18:07] thunder one of the four beasts. Now so
[1:18:12] when the lamb open
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'm the one preaching tonight. I
[1:18:19] represent the lamb.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; When the lamb open,
[1:18:25] this is the book that was sealed. This
[1:18:27] is the book of redemption. When the lamb
[1:18:30] opened,
[1:18:32] praise the Lord.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; From out of this book,
[1:18:36] we heard a noise of thunder. We heard
[1:18:40] the voice of God. And the voice of God
[1:18:43] is the voice of the lamb.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; The voice of God is the voice of the
[1:18:50] lamb. And when you heard that voice,
[1:18:53] what did the voice say?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; The voice call to you
[1:19:03] particular. Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I broke this thing. Okay, fine. I got it
[1:19:08] right. The voice called to you. Come and
[1:19:12] see.
[1:19:14] Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you have to
[1:19:19] remember
[1:19:21] in in in in St. John chapter one,
[1:19:24] brother Brandham always talk about Nata
[1:19:26] and Phillip.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He went to call his friend and what did
[1:19:34] he say?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; That come and see is always the voice of
[1:19:44] the lamb.
[1:19:48] Are we together?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "I gave you water, you
[1:20:03] drink, you never come yet again."
[1:20:06] She said, "I perceive that you are a
[1:20:09] prophet."
[1:20:10] But when the Messiah come and he says,
[1:20:12] "I am he."
[1:20:14] When she went, what did she say?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Come and see. Why? Because the lamb was
[1:20:21] identified.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; When he said, "I am he." Revelation 6:1
[1:20:26] was open.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; The lamb was identified. And every time
[1:20:31] the lamb is identified, you hear the
[1:20:34] voice, "Come and see."
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] Every time the lamb is identified, every
[1:20:44] time the book is open, that is the
[1:20:47] reason why when a person gets saved, uh
[1:20:50] I mean uh h a joy is in your heart. I
[1:20:53] mean you you have seen something, it's
[1:20:56] so easy for you to say, "Oh, come you
[1:20:58] know you can invite somebody to it
[1:20:59] becomes so easy."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you have seen the lamb.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; At that time you don't know you don't
[1:21:08] know the doctrine of the church. You
[1:21:10] don't know that this church they can be
[1:21:12] critical. This church they can be that.
[1:21:14] You don't know all of that.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; When you sit down, you become so
[1:21:19] relaxed.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; When you start sleeping in church, that
[1:21:22] when you can see all the church problem.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But when you are first saved, you are on
[1:21:31] fire. You just are like that. I I just
[1:21:34] love to be in church.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Because what is happening? You have
[1:21:40] hearing the voice of the lamb. Come and
[1:21:42] see.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; When I when I uh when I saw the lamb
[1:21:54] open one of the seal, I heard and it was
[1:21:57] like the noise of thunder. One of the
[1:22:00] four beasts saying, "Come and see."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; So
[1:22:06] it is the lamb
[1:22:13] Maybe I I'll have to I'll have to maybe
[1:22:15] the next time I'm talking talking on
[1:22:18] this I will have to I'll have to add to
[1:22:20] the image. I'll have to put the lamb. So
[1:22:23] it's the lamb
[1:22:25] saying
[1:22:27] to
[1:22:29] the beast
[1:22:31] come and see.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:37] So the lamb
[1:22:39] is exposing this.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; The lamb is exposing
[1:22:48] the power, the spirit that is waring
[1:22:50] against the church.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; The spirit that is waring against our
[1:22:55] life.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; The lamb is saying come and see. Come
[1:23:04] look over here and see.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "We overcome by
[1:23:12] knowing the devil in all of his tricks."
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; How do you know the devil in all of his
[1:23:16] tricks?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; This man that brought David down, he
[1:23:21] brought Solomon, I mean Solomon, he
[1:23:23] brought Samson, the strongest man, down.
[1:23:25] How can you know the devil in all of his
[1:23:27] tricks? You got to hide behind this
[1:23:29] anointing.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason why in every age
[1:23:33] God raised up an anointing to lead his
[1:23:36] people.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; In every age there is an anointing.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; We are sheeps. We don't lead ourself.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; We stay under a shepherd.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; We stay under an anointing. Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; So the anointing that now lead the
[1:23:57] church to see the working of the devil
[1:24:00] in their age.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Because you see the law of restoration
[1:24:07] says when you grab the man that come to
[1:24:10] steal and Jesus said Satan comes to do
[1:24:14] what? Steal and kill and destroy.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; So that anointing comes, the lamb says,
[1:24:22] "Come and see. Come, I will show you.
[1:24:26] Come, I will show you." He has the book
[1:24:29] open. He said, "Come.
[1:24:33] All you behind this lion anointing, come
[1:24:36] and see. Let me show you."
[1:24:38] So the lion anointing comes and the book
[1:24:42] is in the hands of him that was wanted
[1:24:44] to take the book
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; and to loose the seals. Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And then now he's pointing.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You see, that is the reason why you can
[1:24:54] there is no Christian practice you can
[1:24:57] try to overcome.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; For you to overcome, you got to follow
[1:25:03] what
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; the the anointing of your age is
[1:25:06] pointing in the word.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; There must be anointing that saying see
[1:25:11] come and see.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; This is the spirit in your age.
[1:25:16] This is the thing that is bothering you
[1:25:18] in your life.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:25:27] It's not fasting 21 days. It's not
[1:25:29] fasting seven days in a week. All of
[1:25:32] those things are good. Fasting and
[1:25:33] praying is a good thing. It's a good
[1:25:35] thing for the person to be able to draw
[1:25:37] nigh unto God. But you don't fast and
[1:25:40] pray to be able to get straight to
[1:25:42] overcome the devil that you can't see.
[1:25:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; The same way that uh your anointing is
[1:25:53] invisible.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; To be able also to deal with the
[1:25:59] invisible powers that is also waring
[1:26:03] against you.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; So you see that is the reason why if
[1:26:13] this age
[1:26:15] and all the the the the propaganda and
[1:26:19] all the lies and all the deception can
[1:26:22] be able to destroy
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; your interest in listening to the
[1:26:28] messenger of your age. How are you going
[1:26:30] to overcome?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; It's not where all the preachers on
[1:26:34] YouTube
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; the other preacher says this. Oh, you
[1:26:38] you know you must put the Bible under
[1:26:39] your pillow before you sleep. And the
[1:26:41] way you can get good sleep and vision,
[1:26:43] you must be able you can you can listen
[1:26:45] to all of those things.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Is it said the beast
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; is said the anointing
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; to deal with your age.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; The lamb is saying to the anointing,
[1:27:07] "Come and see.
[1:27:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; So everything that is happening in the
[1:27:18] you think about it the early church
[1:27:22] one time they had to pour pour in a
[1:27:24] basket and and and and put him down by
[1:27:27] the war of the city so he can he can run
[1:27:30] away and all the persecution and and and
[1:27:32] and and the slaughter that was taking
[1:27:35] taking place in that in that age. It was
[1:27:38] a delified innocent
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; as a white
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; horse. Innocent. You look at it, it's
[1:27:49] pure.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why all through the
[1:27:53] ages, many people thought the white
[1:27:55] horse was the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; They thought that it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Because it looks innocent,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:06] It can quote the scripture. It quoted it
[1:28:08] to Jesus. He will give his angels charge
[1:28:11] over you.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; When you when you see how Constantine
[1:28:24] came in and merged with the church
[1:28:28] to many of the kind of believers, what
[1:28:30] what is wrong?
[1:28:33] We we are trying to preach the gospel to
[1:28:35] these people and they are accepting the
[1:28:36] gospel. What is wrong for for a a a man
[1:28:40] like Constantine? He's going to build us
[1:28:42] a big church. They're saying that we're
[1:28:44] going from house to house and having
[1:28:45] fellowship under the tree. We would stop
[1:28:47] it now. I mean, God is bringing wealthy
[1:28:50] people in the church. You look at it. It
[1:28:52] it it looks to be good
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; because it's it's white. It's not a
[1:28:56] black. It's not black here. It's just
[1:28:57] white.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Very innocent.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Mhm.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Because all through the ages, men has
[1:29:07] always been trying to find way to make
[1:29:10] the work of God easy. God did not give
[1:29:13] that work to you.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; It's not your work.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Tell it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; All what we can do so so there can be
[1:29:23] peace. What we can do so I mean we can
[1:29:25] feed the spirit. What we can do, you
[1:29:28] know, let's let's uh I mean all sorts of
[1:29:30] things.
[1:29:33] Let's let's bring disco light. I mean in
[1:29:35] the evening when the light you know when
[1:29:36] the lights start changing it it makes
[1:29:38] people to move their body. We we trying
[1:29:41] to find all sorts of things
[1:29:44] to be able
[1:29:46] thing that is asked of us to be born
[1:29:48] again.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; We are not ready to commit to that.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I challenge you tonight if we
[1:29:59] should pass the paper around. You know
[1:30:01] what you think that will be able to help
[1:30:03] this church? Everybody get good ideas.
[1:30:06] Everybody get good ideas.
[1:30:11] Someone said to me the other time,
[1:30:13] brother, why why are we just only having
[1:30:15] Wednesday service?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; At least we can have Wednesday and
[1:30:18] Friday
[1:30:22] when the Wednesday service you are not
[1:30:23] here.
[1:30:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; When the Wednesday service, you are not
[1:30:30] here.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Then you want a you want a a Friday
[1:30:36] service for who to attend?
[1:30:41] You I mean you are so concerned. You are
[1:30:43] concerned. You want a church to grow.
[1:30:45] You want a church to be spiritual.
[1:30:49] Good ideas. It can just it can just fly
[1:30:52] in our mind.
[1:31:00] But all of those good ideas
[1:31:03] is a white horse. Very innocent. No, I'm
[1:31:06] I'm just me. I'm I'm just I'm just
[1:31:08] telling you. I mean, it's just it's just
[1:31:10] my piece of advice.
[1:31:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:24] Don't worry, we'll have a church
[1:31:25] meeting. I will listen to all your
[1:31:26] ideas. Please don't hold them back.
[1:31:29] Okay? Don't hold them back. I won't
[1:31:31] criticize them.
[1:31:34] Don't hold them back. You you just tell
[1:31:36] me how you feel, what you think.
[1:31:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I have a little book uh on prayer
[1:31:49] in bounds. He says man is always looking
[1:31:52] for new method to run the church.
[1:31:57] Say God is not looking for new mentor.
[1:32:00] God is looking for men.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Because the method that God started with
[1:32:06] from the beginning.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; If he can just get a man
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; that will stay with it, it will produce
[1:32:12] what it produced in the beginning.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; We don't need new method and new ideas.
[1:32:19] We just need men
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; that will be dedicated and committed
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; to taking what is what we have.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; We have not even scratched the surface.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; We have not scratched the surface. We
[1:32:35] have not even get wet in what we
[1:32:37] believe. They have not soaked us yet.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And yet we want to pull more over our
[1:32:43] head.
[1:32:48] Praise the Lord. Let's let's come to
[1:32:51] Wednesday service and the service is
[1:32:52] going to 10 10 p.m. in the night. We
[1:32:54] say, "Oh, I mean the the Lord is
[1:32:56] blessing the servant. The the presence
[1:32:58] of God is dead and and and I mean the
[1:33:00] the people are captured in the presence
[1:33:02] of God. So, okay, let's let's just add
[1:33:03] another day." We we can't even fulfill
[1:33:06] we can fulfill to even get it to church
[1:33:09] on time.
[1:33:13] Then we get so concerned when we so
[1:33:16] burdened.
[1:33:18] I mean if we are even having two
[1:33:20] services in a week.
[1:33:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:32] Put ideas for other people to to throw
[1:33:34] it.
[1:33:38] I'm not trying to be critical. I'm just
[1:33:40] trying to see to to let you to see how
[1:33:43] sometimes.
[1:33:52] Come and see.
[1:33:54] That's what
[1:33:56] the the lamb told
[1:34:01] the first anointing.
[1:34:03] Let's go down a little bit. You'll see
[1:34:05] here verse three.
[1:34:08] And when he had opened
[1:34:11] the second seal, I heard the second
[1:34:15] beast saying, "Come and see." So now it
[1:34:19] was the age of the ox.
[1:34:22] Come and see. Come and see the power
[1:34:26] that is slaughtering the church.
[1:34:29] The lamb is saying, "Come and see."
[1:34:34] And the thing about it there is that the
[1:34:37] same anointing here that was innocent
[1:34:41] has now changed its marks.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was white and innocent yet it
[1:34:48] has become red and bloody.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Is the same spirit.
[1:34:53] The same lying spirit is the same thing
[1:34:55] that gossip.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit that that commit
[1:35:00] adultery. It's just the same spirit.
[1:35:02] They are not different.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It's just the same spirit taking another
[1:35:06] form.
[1:35:09] It's the same spirit. It was just one
[1:35:11] spirit moving to another.
[1:35:16] It just changed its mass. Yeah. It was
[1:35:18] looking so innocent.
[1:35:21] Everybody say it's a good idea.
[1:35:24] The church is getting big.
[1:35:28] The Roman people are now believing. Do
[1:35:30] you know the true believers at that time
[1:35:33] they were still gathering in house?
[1:35:36] They were not associating with what
[1:35:38] Constantine started.
[1:35:42] This group that that Paul wrote the book
[1:35:44] of Romans 12.
[1:35:54] How can we overcome
[1:35:56] is by hearing the voice of the lamb that
[1:36:00] says come and see. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; You know when that voice spoke in our
[1:36:04] day, you know what he said? Good morning
[1:36:07] friends.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; He said good morning friends.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; When he say good morning friends on the
[1:36:15] tapes
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; he say come and see.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm about to show you.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's it. I'm about to show you what is
[1:36:23] happening in your day.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into into spiritual
[1:36:32] warfare?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; How did Daniel broke into spiritual
[1:36:37] warfare? The Bible says he went to the
[1:36:39] prophet Jeremiah book.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; He went into the message of Jeremiah.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You will never be able to see the
[1:36:50] weight of your age.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; You will never be able to see uh the
[1:36:54] things that is happening in your day and
[1:36:56] around you.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just listening to brother Ben.
[1:37:00] Where's where's my phone?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I left you in the office. I just
[1:37:05] listening to him today and you were
[1:37:06] saying some things and and it it just
[1:37:09] described the day that we are living in.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Just describe the day.
[1:37:14] It's 9:00. I came I won't I don't want
[1:37:16] to stand for my phone and get into that
[1:37:18] and and you listen to that voice.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; You get into the word
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; and if you are really in the word there
[1:37:27] is something in your daily activity
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Ghost will pick up
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; something you have read
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; something you have heard
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost will pick up.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And when he pick it up, it is that voice
[1:37:47] of the lamb come and see.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's how we overcome.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; It's not by religious practice.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; We overcome by hearing the voice of the
[1:38:00] lamb. The Bible say they overcame by the
[1:38:03] blood of the lamb.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; And the words of his testimony.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; What is that? It's the bleeding word.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It's the bleeding word. That's how we
[1:38:13] overcome.
[1:38:16] That's how we deal with situations.
[1:38:19] When they come, we listen to that voice.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "Come and see. Wash up." It's the
[1:38:24] enemy trying to do something.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; You know, then Brother says, "When you
[1:38:29] get to that place, then you realize it's
[1:38:31] not your wife, it's not your husband,
[1:38:33] it's not your brother, it's not your
[1:38:34] sister. You realize that it's the enemy
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; because you are listening to the voice
[1:38:39] of the lamb and then the anointing of
[1:38:41] your age
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; will not expose the enemy.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; If not you are just cannor. You are
[1:38:50] fighting a losing battle because all the
[1:38:52] cannon you bailing in your mind will
[1:38:54] just frustrate you.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; God will not honor it.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; He will not anoint it because it is not
[1:39:01] his word.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; It will make you mad. It will make you
[1:39:04] angry. You will just you will just be
[1:39:06] nervous. You will just be frustrated.
[1:39:09] Why? Because you are feeling on your own
[1:39:11] dead thoughts.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You are not feeling. You are not
[1:39:14] listening to the voice of the lamb.
[1:39:16] Lord,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; that's why we can overcome.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Because we are we are we are learning to
[1:39:22] believe ourself.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; We are making ourself God.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We establish our thoughts. We
[1:39:32] believe it. We hold to it.
[1:39:34] They said the word of God. They said
[1:39:35] vindicated. They said prove it in the
[1:39:37] word. Can you prove it by the word?
[1:39:42] How do we overcome?
[1:39:47] How do we overcome?
[1:39:51] The Lord bless you. We'll continue.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.

[1:40:02] a hand of praise. Amen.
[1:40:09] Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; You know, as I was studying the subject
[1:40:20] today, I was thinking about a little
[1:40:22] song we used to sing many years back.
[1:40:25] Come and see the man Jesus. The man, the
[1:40:28] man who told me everything that I have
[1:40:31] done. Amen.
[1:40:35] Praise the Lord. Y you never heard it
[1:40:36] before. So we try we try to make it
[1:40:39] happen. Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] I didn't even write itself. I was
[1:40:44] thinking about writing it, but I was
[1:40:45] writing in the midst of steady.
[1:40:50] I think if you checked it, I might have
[1:40:51] sent it long time ago, but I don't know.
[1:40:55] those those songs come to my mind and uh
[1:40:58] let's stand on our feet. We'll pray and
[1:41:00] then we let you go home tonight.

[1:44:29] Amen.
[1:44:31] Let's pray together tonight. Heavenly
[1:44:34] Father,
[1:44:35] you are the lamb.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5, there was no man
[1:44:39] worthy to open the book. There was just
[1:44:42] no man worthy to open the book to lose
[1:44:46] the seal.
[1:44:48] John said one came forth
[1:44:51] a bleeding lamp. You took the book, you
[1:44:54] lose the seal.
[1:44:57] And Lord, you have called us to come and
[1:44:59] see
[1:45:02] through the message of Malachi 4. You
[1:45:04] have opened our eyes, Lord.
[1:45:08] And Father, how can we over these
[1:45:10] things Lord? You are show showing us the
[1:45:14] adulterous spirit in this age. Lord, you
[1:45:17] are showing us, oh God, Father, the
[1:45:19] word, Lord God. Father, even a a 1933
[1:45:23] vision, Lord, Father God, Lord, America
[1:45:26] in in in in the grace, oh God,
[1:45:31] you said come and see.
[1:45:35] Come and see how far how how Lord we
[1:45:38] have turned away from that voice. Lord,
[1:45:40] we are making our own image images,
[1:45:43] Lord. Father,
[1:45:45] instead of looking into the the word and
[1:45:48] looking into the things that you have
[1:45:49] opened, the word you have opened, the
[1:45:52] revelation you have opened,
[1:45:56] Father,
[1:45:58] if it was not because of this message of
[1:46:00] the hour, Lord, if it was not because of
[1:46:03] the grace that came to our heart and the
[1:46:06] things, the little things that you have
[1:46:07] shown us in the word, how God, how can
[1:46:10] we just take little and run with it and
[1:46:12] feel like we know
[1:46:15] when we have not even scratched the
[1:46:16] surface, Lord. We have not even really
[1:46:19] got down there, Lord God. We just hear
[1:46:22] about water baptism in Jesus name and
[1:46:25] one God and the Godhead and and Father,
[1:46:27] all of these little things,
[1:46:30] it have just make us to be so critical.
[1:46:35] When there is when there is more. When
[1:46:37] there is more.
[1:46:39] When there is more.
[1:46:42] You told us to come and see. And now we
[1:46:45] know what is happening behind the
[1:46:46] curtains of time.
[1:46:48] You told us to come and see.
[1:46:52] You said there was going to be an
[1:46:54] American pope and now we seeing it. It
[1:46:57] was right in there.
[1:47:04] The devil get us so busy we can't even
[1:47:07] open your word and say Lord show me to
[1:47:10] see.
[1:47:12] There's no time to listen to uh uh uh uh
[1:47:16] uh uh the prophet message even the ones
[1:47:18] we play on Sunday. I mean uh we thank
[1:47:21] you for the few that are able to get
[1:47:23] here Lord and become part of it and
[1:47:25] those that are streaming online oh God.
[1:47:28] But father are we really into the word?
[1:47:31] Are we really listening with a hungry
[1:47:33] heart?
[1:47:35] It's not for an entertainment, Lord God.
[1:47:37] It's to be able to show us the things
[1:47:40] that we need to know in this age how we
[1:47:44] can be able to overcome, how we can be
[1:47:47] able to overcome bad feelings,
[1:47:50] misunderstanding. You you taught us in
[1:47:52] the word, it's right there in the
[1:47:54] message of the hour. Brother Abraham
[1:47:56] says God God be misunderstood. If God if
[1:47:59] if if if God the creator could be
[1:48:02] misunderstanding

[1:48:18] listen to your voice that say come and
[1:48:20] see.
[1:48:22] Come and see. Lord,
[1:48:24] you are the lamb that has shown us all
[1:48:27] the things that we know. That is the
[1:48:29] only way we can overcome. Not by our
[1:48:32] ideas, not by our emotion. Is all flesh.
[1:48:37] It's all flesh. And your word say it
[1:48:40] stinks. It stings before you. Flesh
[1:48:44] stinks before you.
[1:48:46] When we put our flesh to things and it a
[1:48:50] it a it stick on our bones and it's seen
[1:48:52] in our face and it's in our it sting
[1:48:55] before the father.
[1:48:59] Oh help us Lord
[1:49:01] have mercy. Lord God
[1:49:04] have mercy. Jesus
