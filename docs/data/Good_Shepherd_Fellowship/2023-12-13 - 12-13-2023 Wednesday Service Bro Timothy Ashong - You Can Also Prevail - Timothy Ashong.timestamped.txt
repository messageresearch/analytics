[50:01] unto me to Canada and back and the
[50:03] various brothers and assemblies that we
[50:05] met and fellowship with and we thank you
[50:08] for the blessings Lord that you made you
[50:10] give to us we are together again May
[50:14] that blessing step us out of the way and
[50:17] just minister to our needs in the name
[50:20] of Jesus Christ Our Lord we ask your
[50:23] blessings upon the service amen
[50:27] God bless you so we welcome everybody in
[50:29] the house of the Lord and also I'm
[50:32] welcome back to
[50:34] minota and the brothers asked me to
[50:37] greet
[50:39] uh yeah I ministered in I think many
[50:42] service um
[50:45] about two years about six or groups or
[50:49] somewhere there and uh the Lord was with
[50:52] us and we had good services and I came
[50:55] back yester night so now those who
[50:58] remember to pray for me too thank you
[51:01] those who didn't remember to the
[51:05] same God bless you we thank God for
[51:07] Grace we love the Lord we love his
[51:09] people and I just want to encourage us
[51:12] this evening to let's continue pressing
[51:15] on uh that's all that I want to say
[51:17] let's go we'll make it by his grace H so
[51:21] we just say some few things I really
[51:23] like prayer meetings and uh
[51:25] I love to pray I love the prayers that
[51:28] because that's one thing the prophet of
[51:30] God said we cannot do too much so we
[51:33] cannot pray too much so let's make it a
[51:36] habit of praying and sometime midweek
[51:39] like this and people don't see the
[51:41] importance of but that is the main thing
[51:44] prayer prayer don't forget
[51:47] prayer prayer so don't miss prayer
[51:51] services because that's the time you
[51:54] talk to God
[51:57] you speak to him you you pour your heart
[52:00] you when we come to church the preaching
[52:02] okay we hear it but now when it's prayer
[52:04] we talk to the
[52:06] Lord so also don't let the prayer
[52:09] meeting ends over here in the church
[52:11] Auditorium but we should be men and
[52:14] women of prayer am we should be prayed
[52:17] up every moment of Our Lives am that is
[52:20] what we are
[52:21] lacking we've heard the word we have the
[52:23] Mysteries we have but we are lacking in
[52:25] prayer to Quicken it to make it to live
[52:30] so may God help us my brothers and
[52:32] sisters so that we be men and women of
[52:35] prayer we are taught in the scripture
[52:37] that our fathers of f they were men of
[52:40] fewers but they were men of prayer yes
[52:43] and that made a lot of difference so God
[52:46] help us let's read this morning I'm
[52:48] sorry this evening from The Book of
[52:51] Genesis Genesis 32 that's about Jacob
[52:57] Genesis
[52:58] 32 we try not to you know to just say
[53:03] some few things
[53:04] to encourage our Genesis
[53:09] 32 let's read from verse
[53:13] 24 and Jacob was left
[53:16] alone and there restored a man with him
[53:21] until the breaking of the day
[53:26] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[53:31] against him he T the hollow of his
[53:35] star and the hollow of Jacob's star was
[53:39] out of
[53:41] joint as he Resto with him amen and he
[53:46] said let me go for the day breth and he
[53:51] said I will not let thee go EX except
[53:56] that bless me I pray that each and every
[53:59] one of God will come to and say Lord
[54:02] except you bless me except you do
[54:05] something for me and continue he said
[54:09] except you bless me and he said unto him
[54:12] what is thy name and he said Jacob and
[54:16] he said thy name shall be called No More
[54:22] Jacob but
[54:24] Israel for as a
[54:26] prince hast thou power with God and with
[54:31] men and as
[54:34] prade amen amen and he and Jacob ask him
[54:38] and said tell me I pray thee thy name
[54:42] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[54:45] ask after my name and he bless him there
[54:50] and Jacob called the name of the place
[54:53] panan for I have seen God face to face
[54:58] and my life is
[55:01] preserved may God bless the reading of
[55:04] his word shall we please be
[55:09] seated and the 1st Samuel chapter
[55:14] 17 1st Samuel chapter
[55:20] 17 1 Samuel chapter
[55:24] 17
[55:31] chapter
[55:32] 17 let's read just verse 50 there
[55:37] 1750 so David prevailed over the
[55:41] Philistine with a sling and with a stone
[55:46] and smot the Philistine and slew him but
[55:51] there was
[55:52] no sword in the hand of David therefore
[55:57] David
[55:58] ran and stood upon the
[56:01] Philistine and took his sword and Drew
[56:05] it out of the ship therefore and slew
[56:10] him and cut off his head thereof
[56:13] therewith and when the Philistines saw
[56:18] their Champion was dead they fled amen
[56:22] amen God bless you dear once so um we
[56:26] just love the Lord and we just love the
[56:29] people of God and uh just to encourage
[56:32] ourselves this
[56:34] evening Jacob meeting the angel of the
[56:39] Lord
[56:41] prevailing and what are we saying this
[56:43] evening you can also
[56:46] Prevail amen praise the Lord yes you can
[56:50] also
[56:52] Prevail not only Jacob but you can also
[56:56] Prevail
[56:57] yes every one of us the prophet said a
[57:01] man Prevail over
[57:08] God Jacob
[57:10] stay Jacob stayed there until something
[57:13] happened that made him work
[57:17] different made him a different
[57:21] person because that he stayed until that
[57:26] happened and the Bible said he had on
[57:31] until he Prevail how can a man Prevail
[57:34] over
[57:35] God but you can do
[57:39] it you can do it a man can Prevail over
[57:45] God a man can Prevail over God because
[57:50] Jacob did
[57:51] it the one that he restor with was the
[57:54] Angel of the Lord
[57:58] amen when he realized the situation that
[58:01] he was in he was going to meet his
[58:04] brother he was going to meet Esau he has
[58:07] left home and you know he did many he
[58:11] took his brother's birth right he went
[58:13] to his uncle he deceived his own father
[58:15] and uh he deceived his uncle everywhere
[58:18] he
[58:19] went because listen the place you live
[58:23] does not matter wherever you go your
[58:25] character is there yes you go with your
[58:28] character no wonder the prophet said
[58:31] that does not change a man yes that's
[58:33] right cuz whatever you are today that's
[58:36] what you'll be over there amen so
[58:39] somebody oh the people are not good here
[58:41] the church is not good and they go out
[58:43] and it's the same problem yes so you
[58:46] just have to check
[58:48] yourself so Jacob was there in the house
[58:51] and then he just knock his brother he
[58:53] went to his father he knock him out and
[58:56] but when he met God it was a different
[58:59] story so what we are saying this evening
[59:04] is there is need to meet God that's
[59:10] right
[59:13] personally we must meet the
[59:16] Lord and Jacob realized in and
[59:19] recognizing the situation that I'm going
[59:21] to me my brother I don't know what will
[59:23] be so before I meet my brother I have to
[59:27] settle it with God and when you settle
[59:29] with God you can meet any man you can go
[59:33] anywhere a man that meets God on his
[59:35] knee can stand before any man if you
[59:38] meet God on your knees you can stand
[59:40] before any
[59:41] man praise the
[59:44] Lord so what we need is to meet
[59:50] God when you meet God you will never run
[59:52] away from man again amen
[59:55] Everything Will
[59:58] Change for You Know Moses run away from
[1:00:00] Egypt but when he met
[1:00:03] God he was not afraid of nobody
[1:00:06] again the very Pharaoh that was against
[1:00:09] him the very people that were against
[1:00:12] him the very people that did not want to
[1:00:14] see him he went right into the
[1:00:17] palace he did not go as a fear fear man
[1:00:20] or fear he went there as a champion yes
[1:00:23] amen amen because he met God at the
[1:00:26] backside of the desert prise the Lord he
[1:00:30] met God when nobody was there the
[1:00:34] outcome that came out the evident the
[1:00:37] fruit that came out that this man has
[1:00:38] met
[1:00:40] God and that is why everyone must meet
[1:00:44] God on that sacred
[1:00:46] ground it is very good to come to
[1:00:49] church but we have to meet God because
[1:00:53] we have a lot of talent es before us we
[1:00:56] have a lot of battles to fight and if we
[1:00:59] will be able to fight this battle and to
[1:01:02] stand against the opponent stand against
[1:01:04] our enemies then we must meet God
[1:01:10] individually praise the Lord this is
[1:01:13] very
[1:01:16] important as we have been taught and as
[1:01:18] we have heard we are not in
[1:01:22] picnic Christianity is a
[1:01:25] battle the Bible has told us that we are
[1:01:28] not wrestling with flesh and blood but
[1:01:31] with
[1:01:32] principalities with powers spiritual
[1:01:35] wickedness in high places but
[1:01:39] listen if Jacob Prevail over God we will
[1:01:43] prevail over the
[1:01:45] devil praise the Lord even God Jacob
[1:01:49] Prevail praise the Lord so we if he
[1:01:52] Prevail against over God we can previl
[1:01:55] over anything when we meet
[1:02:00] God hallelujah no matter what the
[1:02:03] challenge might be and so we read about
[1:02:05] this jacob man and uh and then he met
[1:02:09] this man and ah man he said he met God
[1:02:14] in the wrestling
[1:02:18] manth at the back side of the
[1:02:22] desert and he recognized is that look if
[1:02:25] something doesn't happen to me I'll be
[1:02:27] gone I'll be finished so he realized the
[1:02:32] opportunity and he had on and it was
[1:02:35] wrestling it was fighting it was
[1:02:37] fighting it was oh man and the Bible
[1:02:40] said that
[1:02:43] hey Jacob stood there stood on his
[1:02:47] grounds and the angel said let me go he
[1:02:49] said you will not go the meeting is not
[1:02:53] over amen you will not go he said then
[1:02:59] the angel has to touch him and he has
[1:03:01] some this
[1:03:03] location he said to the angel said
[1:03:07] please do bless me you can ask for God's
[1:03:11] blessings bless me Lord change me touch
[1:03:16] me Deliver
[1:03:18] Me Loose me I'm
[1:03:21] bound I'm I'm afraid I can't go
[1:03:25] forward I can't fight on my own I I

[1:04:51] today is that you can also preva
[1:04:58] yes he said today we don't have much
[1:05:03] time and that is why we can't get much
[1:05:06] from
[1:05:07] God most at times we program things so
[1:05:11] much until God has no
[1:05:15] room until we don't give him a
[1:05:19] chance because we have our own
[1:05:23] time
[1:05:24] yes why did he brought the children of
[1:05:27] Israel out of bondage so that they will
[1:05:29] have time to worship
[1:05:33] Him in Egypt they had no time the men
[1:05:37] were working the women were working and
[1:05:39] this one that and this and they had no
[1:05:42] time they had no time to go to church
[1:05:45] they had no time to serve the Lord they
[1:05:47] had no time before God and time they
[1:05:50] didn't have the
[1:05:52] time and go said
[1:05:55] Pharaoh let my people go so that they
[1:05:58] will serve
[1:06:00] me God want us to serve
[1:06:04] him have time with
[1:06:08] him appreciate him tell him how much we
[1:06:13] love
[1:06:15] him how much we appreciate what he has
[1:06:18] done for us just as we were singing he
[1:06:22] has done what this were could not do
[1:06:25] and if he has done what this world could
[1:06:27] not do is that the service that we give
[1:06:29] to him
[1:06:31] amen is that the appreciation that we
[1:06:34] give to him he has done what this word
[1:06:38] what no other power can do for us yes if
[1:06:41] people should be happy praising L the
[1:06:44] Lord people should be happy coming to
[1:06:46] church people should be happy about the
[1:06:48] things of God way yes that's right amen
[1:06:52] it's you it's me
[1:06:56] let the word call us whatever they want
[1:06:59] to call
[1:07:02] us we should be very grateful and very
[1:07:06] thankful to God Amen yes
[1:07:10] Hallelujah Jacob prevailed over God a
[1:07:13] man Prevail over
[1:07:20] God is it possible yes the Bible said it
[1:07:24] we believe the Bible amen yes so if
[1:07:27] somebody Prevail amen you can also preva
[1:07:30] yes praise the
[1:07:32] Lord don't let the enemy disarm you I
[1:07:37] was reading in the book of uh um
[1:07:40] Chronicles and uh let me just see and
[1:07:43] how the children of Israel Judah Prevail
[1:07:45] one
[1:07:46] day and I just want to read it so that
[1:07:49] you hear
[1:07:52] it second Chron chicles Chapter
[1:07:58] 13 Verse 18 thus the children of Israel
[1:08:04] were brought under were brought under at
[1:08:09] that
[1:08:10] time and the children of Judah
[1:08:13] prevailed because they relied upon the
[1:08:17] Lord God of their fathers amen they
[1:08:21] prevailed because they relied upon God
[1:08:26] so the way to Prevail is to rely upon
[1:08:29] God who is the word amen that's right he
[1:08:33] said every time the enemy comes the
[1:08:36] enemy want to cause us to disbelieve the
[1:08:41] word yes that and and to disbelieve your
[1:08:46] weapon that is what he did in the
[1:08:49] beginning it caused them to doubt the
[1:08:52] weapon that God has given to them amen
[1:08:55] is did God really say so did God really
[1:08:58] meant at all he meant this he meant that
[1:09:01] so he created a doubt and remember he's
[1:09:05] doing the same thing
[1:09:07] today right to cause us to doubt the
[1:09:11] word to disbelieve God's word to
[1:09:15] question God's word and when there is
[1:09:18] doubt in your mind you can never get
[1:09:20] anything from
[1:09:22] God so we need that
[1:09:27] revelation of the word of the Lord amen
[1:09:30] and the prophet
[1:09:32] said it is the revelation of God that
[1:09:35] will give you authority over the
[1:09:39] devil there is nothing of such
[1:09:42] prevailing power as the revelation of
[1:09:46] the word of God praise the Lord and
[1:09:50] Satan comes to attack and Satan's attack
[1:09:54] is to cause you to disbelieve God's
[1:09:58] word that is his
[1:10:02] attack to cause you to disbelieve God's
[1:10:09] word may the Lord help
[1:10:12] us give it that
[1:10:15] revelation of the word of the
[1:10:18] Lord the message that has been given to
[1:10:21] us
[1:10:22] today
[1:10:24] hold on to
[1:10:27] it we have been given Divine
[1:10:32] instructions saints of
[1:10:35] God don't let these things become common
[1:10:39] to
[1:10:42] us hold on because that is the only way
[1:10:46] we can
[1:10:48] Prevail and Jacob
[1:10:51] prevailed over God
[1:10:54] over the angel a man fighting with an
[1:11:00] angel
[1:11:02] man until the Ang said let me go he said
[1:11:05] no no no you are not going you are not
[1:11:08] going today
[1:11:11] wow and he realized who he was fighting
[1:11:14] with he realized he was in the presence
[1:11:17] of a supernatural
[1:11:20] being he realized that this is the time
[1:11:23] that I can be changed today or never
[1:11:26] that's
[1:11:30] right I will not let you go unless you
[1:11:35] bless
[1:11:38] me what is your name he said Jacob Jacob
[1:11:42] me
[1:11:43] deceiver so he confess this is who I am
[1:11:47] and what I
[1:11:52] am and the the angel
[1:11:54] said you are no more to be called Jacob
[1:11:59] amen but a prince you have power before
[1:12:03] God a
[1:12:04] man his life was changed he prevailed
[1:12:08] right that's all that he has been
[1:12:10] looking for he has been going to church
[1:12:12] he has been going to the meetings here
[1:12:14] and there but he wants a
[1:12:19] change he want a
[1:12:21] blessing and remember God has a blessing
[1:12:25] for

[1:12:56] late jaob head on I would not want to
[1:12:59] take much of your time I wish we can
[1:13:01] pray
[1:13:02] more Jacob had
[1:13:05] on and he prayed young
[1:13:08] man young

[1:13:21] divine mean itive blessing is there for
[1:13:29] you we are not going to be sons of God
[1:13:32] we are sons of God
[1:13:34] now the promises that God gave is not
[1:13:38] for Angels it's for
[1:13:39] us because a son has more right
[1:13:43] Authority in the sight of God than than
[1:13:46] even the
[1:13:51] Archangel Hallelujah
[1:13:55] you can also
[1:13:59] Prevail why because the lion of the
[1:14:02] tribe of Judah has already
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:05] prevailed he prevailed for us we were in
[1:14:09] him when he prevailed right so you and I
[1:14:12] you can never be a loser you cannot be
[1:14:16] defeated because he Prevail for us so
[1:14:20] you can also
[1:14:22] prevail he
[1:14:24] fought he said your greatest enemy is
[1:14:27] yourself that's right and Jesus fought
[1:14:30] against the
[1:14:32] Flesh and he brought his flesh under the
[1:14:39] word what is it God has said this he had
[1:14:42] power you know when he stood there they
[1:14:44] said he had power he could have C 10,000
[1:14:49] angels He could have done
[1:14:51] it command is he said I have power to
[1:14:54] command 12 Legions and they will come
[1:14:56] down but he had he said he said
[1:14:58] something there he said how then will
[1:15:00] the scripture be fulfilled
[1:15:03] yes he wants the scripture to be
[1:15:07] fulfilled so he submitted this one to
[1:15:11] the
[1:15:12] word and he said father I will be done
[1:15:16] not as I will let your will be
[1:15:20] done and it prevailed
[1:15:23] when he came to the spot he said father
[1:15:26] let thy will be done he
[1:15:31] prevailed you can also Prevail saints of
[1:15:34] God
[1:15:36] Amen we can't fail in this
[1:15:42] hour listen don't get
[1:15:45] tired if the love of God is in our heart
[1:15:48] you love to come to
[1:15:50] church and remember God protects his
[1:15:52] children
[1:15:54] and he watches over his
[1:15:57] children so don't and I want to say to
[1:16:00] you it don't don't get
[1:16:05] weary no no no it's mindful of
[1:16:08] us he cares for us so dear one I'm just
[1:16:12] encouraging you this
[1:16:14] evening you can
[1:16:18] Prevail you know like H
[1:16:21] king um
[1:16:26] hezekia he was told by a prophet a major
[1:16:30] prophet that you are going to die put
[1:16:32] your house in
[1:16:34] order I said
[1:16:37] oh the Bible say he turn his face to the
[1:16:39] war he begin to cry said remember I've
[1:16:41] done this remember I've done this
[1:16:43] remember I've done this give me for more
[1:16:46] years I will do
[1:16:48] more God spoke again to the
[1:16:52] prophet but that man Prevail in
[1:16:54] prayer prevailing prayers amen in
[1:16:59] desperation he
[1:17:01] called in desperation he
[1:17:05] called go back to him and tell him he's
[1:17:08] not going to die
[1:17:10] again he has
[1:17:12] prevailed you can also Prevail sometimes
[1:17:16] I look at her and we think oh I'm not
[1:17:18] that type I'm not part you look at
[1:17:21] yourself and then he said no no I can't
[1:17:24] make it you condemn
[1:17:26] yourself but my brothers you can also
[1:17:30] Prevail that's right because those men
[1:17:34] that we read about in the scriptures the
[1:17:37] Bible tells us they were men and women
[1:17:40] of like passion as we are
[1:17:43] yes so if they Prevail then we can also
[1:17:47] Prevail that's right because it is about
[1:17:49] the same God right it is the same God we
[1:17:52] are talking about it is the same Creator
[1:17:56] we are talking about God has not changed
[1:17:59] his order has not changed his principles
[1:18:02] has not changed he said he takes away
[1:18:05] his man but not his Spirit
[1:18:08] right the same spirit that was upon our
[1:18:11] fathers of old is The Same Spirit here
[1:18:13] with us if we have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:16] amen and if we call even if you don't
[1:18:19] have is there for you yes for he said
[1:18:22] the promise is on to you and to your
[1:18:24] children and to them that are far off as
[1:18:27] many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:18:30] that's right so you can
[1:18:33] Prevail David
[1:18:37] Prevail because he relied on the Lord
[1:18:40] amen he came at a time when everybody
[1:18:44] was looking walking by sight speaking by
[1:18:48] sight looking by sight everything they
[1:18:51] were talking about golad golad golad
[1:18:53] golad golad but when David came he
[1:18:56] relied upon the Lord he said the Lord
[1:18:58] did this for me the Lord deliver me from
[1:19:01] here not my might not by power the Lord
[1:19:04] did this for me the Lord will do it
[1:19:06] again rely on God and you will prevail
[1:19:09] yes praise the Lord rely on God you'll
[1:19:13] Prevail because the battle when you rely
[1:19:16] on the Lord you push the battle to him
[1:19:20] amen he said it's not in my hands again
[1:19:24] Lord I give it to
[1:19:27] you the prophet say you SE God Healing
[1:19:30] The Sick he said come and see God in
[1:19:37] battle rely on go my brothers and if
[1:19:41] there ever was a time and has been a
[1:19:43] time it is now because everything is
[1:19:45] falling apart yes everything is
[1:19:49] failing God will never fail
[1:19:53] Heaven and the Earth will pass away but
[1:19:56] the word of the Lord will never pass
[1:19:58] away and that is what God has given to
[1:20:01] us never never never never has it been
[1:20:06] so much emphasis emphasis lay on the
[1:20:09] word than in our
[1:20:11] day the word all that brother preach the
