[51:19] [Music]
[51:35] foreign
[51:51] [Music]
[52:14] waves
[52:17] [Music]
[52:40] hello bless you you may have your seat
[52:42] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[52:46] morning we want to thank the Lord for
[52:48] his goodness
[52:50] we want to thank the Lord for his grace
[52:52] his love and mercy praise the Lord
[52:55] amen amen amen
[52:59] you know the Lord has a way of drawing
[53:03] us
[53:04] to a place of where he want us to be
[53:14] you know what I serve as a church we
[53:20] the Lord has blessed us with
[53:24] you know good
[53:26] music and good
[53:32] praise singers
[53:34] but I think what
[53:37] maybe he want to bring us to is to bring
[53:40] us to a place of worship
[53:42] because there is a complete difference
[53:44] between praise and worship
[53:47] one of the people I used to praise
[53:49] singing even the slower song
[53:53] they want to make it loud
[53:56] sometimes you just need to think and
[53:59] just lift your hands without clapping
[54:03] and just rest your mind on the Lord
[54:09] sometimes that's that I mean he's the
[54:11] one we are worshiping is not to bring
[54:13] yourself satisfaction
[54:15] is to bring him satisfaction
[54:19] praise the Lord so you see when the
[54:21] worship goes like this then you start to
[54:24] feed it's bad that you're not enjoying
[54:27] the worship you are not supposed to
[54:28] enjoy it he's supposed to enjoy it amen
[54:32] God bless you brother
[54:33] praise the Lord amen he's the one we are
[54:36] worshiping
[54:37] we are now worshiping you you are now
[54:39] worshiping me you are now worshiping the
[54:41] song leader we are worshiping him and
[54:44] that's when we have to be conscious of
[54:46] that
[54:47] because when we are in a situation like
[54:50] this and it looks like the sun is going
[54:52] this way and then we get we get take off
[54:56] in our emotion in our feelings and then
[55:00] you know the devil knows how to get
[55:02] right in there and then he starts to
[55:05] make you to feel miserable and then you
[55:07] think that you are feeling sorry for the
[55:09] song leader or you think that uh you
[55:11] know the worship is going out of place
[55:13] and it's all because we we we we love to
[55:18] bring satisfaction to ourself
[55:21] we want to we want to shake our body we
[55:24] want to move ourself and we are not even
[55:27] conscious that the one that we are
[55:29] worshiping is the one up there
[55:31] and it's to him that we must bring all
[55:34] the praise it is to him that we must
[55:36] bring all the worship
[55:38] you see when you play the the tambourine
[55:41] and you play the the the
[55:44] salsa or shaking thing there you have to
[55:48] realize that you are not leading the
[55:50] service
[55:51] don't play those things more than how
[55:53] the song leader is singing he's the one
[55:55] leading the
[55:57] things you're not leading this
[55:59] so it's almost like you're trying to
[56:01] play it fast so the song can go fast
[56:03] you're another one in the lead
[56:06] is the spirit that is leading the
[56:08] service
[56:10] [Music]
[56:13] praise the Lord
[56:15] that's why we must be conscious of
[56:17] he's the one that we have come to
[56:19] worship
[56:24] and we must be able to bring that
[56:26] worship to him
[56:28] [Music]
[56:29] to satisfy ourselves
[56:32] not to satisfy our emotion if the spirit
[56:36] lead us in a way to dance we will dance
[56:40] if we think that every service we must
[56:42] go around the building know God has a
[56:45] way of grabbing our attention
[56:51] praise the Lord
[56:52] he has a way of grabbing our attention
[56:56] because
[56:57] he deserve Our Praise
[57:00] he won our praise
[57:03] he won he had brought us he has redeemed
[57:07] Us by his blood so we can be able to
[57:09] bring praise and worship to him
[57:13] [Music]
[57:15] are we together
[57:17] let's stand on our faith
[57:21] we are standing on Holy Ground let's

[1:08:54] Matthew chapter 21.
[1:09:00] praise the Lord
[1:09:04] will read all that work
[1:09:07] invisible audience
[1:09:10] those that are following the service we
[1:09:12] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:33] for the services in a weaker I just
[1:09:38] told
[1:09:40] Dr Jordan will make some changes I have
[1:09:43] a reason to be away the uh
[1:09:47] this week so the Wednesday night service
[1:09:51] will be put on Friday night so let's
[1:09:54] have a prayer meeting Friday night and
[1:09:56] then the Sun the weekend stays just
[1:09:58] oscillate but a Mac will fly in uh
[1:10:03] Saturday morning and he will speak for
[1:10:06] us Saturday night and Sunday morning so
[1:10:09] Wednesday night there will be no service
[1:10:11] and uh
[1:10:15] we will meet on Friday evening it's our
[1:10:18] same service time at seven o'clock and
[1:10:21] we will just have a prayer meeting that
[1:10:23] evening
[1:10:24] we were going to have a prayer meeting
[1:10:26] Wednesday night anyway brother Andrew
[1:10:29] boscal from shivac actually was supposed
[1:10:32] to speak for us on Wednesday night but
[1:10:35] he's traveling to Philadelphia
[1:10:37] for their Easter services there with
[1:10:40] brothers and the brothers there and they
[1:10:43] flew in on Friday
[1:10:46] Thursday night Friday we met up with
[1:10:48] them and visited with birming going down
[1:10:51] to preach for better Joe piasco so he
[1:10:53] was supposed to come back on Monday or
[1:10:57] Tuesday pray for us on Wednesday and
[1:10:59] then get on his way to Philadelphia but
[1:11:01] he's driving
[1:11:02] and he's driving with his family
[1:11:05] so leaving Thursday to be in
[1:11:08] Philadelphia for service on Friday would
[1:11:10] have been a little bit tough for him and
[1:11:13] so
[1:11:15] um we just thought okay he should go
[1:11:19] down to Wisconsin preach relax himself
[1:11:21] and then he can have uh uh an easy drive
[1:11:26] to Philadelphia during the week which of
[1:11:28] course you want to stop some of the few
[1:11:30] other places and visit so that's the
[1:11:34] reason why he would now speak for us on
[1:11:36] Wednesday night so then I just thought
[1:11:38] okay since I have some few things on my
[1:11:41] hands to do
[1:11:42] uh my one of my good good old friend
[1:11:46] brother Bill Young he's now well uh
[1:11:49] spoke with his wife he's been in and out
[1:11:52] with his heart so uh
[1:11:56] I'm trusting the Lord to be able to see
[1:11:59] if I can reach there and and visit with
[1:12:01] him and the wife called me now to pray
[1:12:04] for him most of the time he will call
[1:12:06] whenever he's not feeling too well and
[1:12:09] we will pray it on the phone and so we
[1:12:13] want to we just want to see if we can
[1:12:16] get there Wednesday night visit with him
[1:12:18] at home and then get back for the
[1:12:22] service so Friday evening at seven
[1:12:25] o'clock we'll be here for the prayer
[1:12:26] meeting it's not an all-night prayer
[1:12:28] meeting it's a regular weekday prayer
[1:12:31] meeting so don't uh don't sleep don't
[1:12:34] bring food let's just come we'll pray
[1:12:36] we'll let you to go home timely enough
[1:12:38] so we can be back Thursday night for
[1:12:41] service praise the Lord so let's just
[1:12:43] read
[1:12:45] Matthew chapter 21. God bless you Daniel
[1:12:50] Stan let's read
[1:12:55] don't worry
[1:13:10] let's read from verse 1 and when the
[1:13:13] drove night onto Jerusalem
[1:13:16] and we came to
[1:13:19] Bath health
[1:13:21] onto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus
[1:13:25] to disciples saying unto them go into
[1:13:28] the village over against you and
[1:13:31] straightway I try to keep mine
[1:13:35] eye service here and I keep forgetting
[1:13:41] go into the village over against you in
[1:13:45] straight well fine
[1:13:47] uh straight away yes
[1:13:49] and a call with her lose them and bring
[1:13:53] them unto me and if any man say art unto
[1:13:57] you yesha said the Lord have need of
[1:14:00] them in straight way he shall send him
[1:14:04] all this was done that it might be
[1:14:07] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:14:09] prophet saying tell ye the daughters of
[1:14:13] Zion
[1:14:15] Behold thy King cometh unto they make
[1:14:18] and sitting upon on us and Accord
[1:14:22] therefore upon us and the disciple went
[1:14:25] and did as Jesus commanded him and
[1:14:28] brought the eyes and the cause and
[1:14:31] pulled on Port on them their cloth and
[1:14:35] they sat him there on
[1:14:38] and a a great multitude spray their
[1:14:42] Garden in the way
[1:14:43] others cut down branches from the trees
[1:14:47] and and spread them in the way and the
[1:14:52] multitude that went before
[1:14:55] and their follow Christ saying Hosanna
[1:14:59] to the son of David blessed is he that
[1:15:02] cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna
[1:15:04] in the highest
[1:15:06] and when he was come into Jerusalem all
[1:15:10] the city was moved saying who is this
[1:15:16] and the multitude said this is Jesus a
[1:15:20] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee let us
[1:15:23] pray
[1:15:24] Heavenly Father Lord we ask your
[1:15:28] blessing upon the portion of your word
[1:15:31] that we have read we will ask that Lord
[1:15:33] God you will take uh a touch out of it
[1:15:37] Lord and bless us this morning uh with
[1:15:40] the burden that is upon our heart to
[1:15:42] Father we just pray that God you will
[1:15:44] come out of the pages of your word and
[1:15:47] father Lord May something of God be said
[1:15:51] that we encourage us Lord something that
[1:15:53] will draw us closer to the foot of the
[1:15:56] cross that will help us in our walk with
[1:15:59] you Lord we just want to thank you we
[1:16:02] want to appreciate you father as we just
[1:16:04] commit ourselves in your hands now in
[1:16:07] Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord
[1:16:10] bless you you may have your seat sorry
[1:16:12] for keeping you standing very long
[1:16:16] praise the Lord
[1:16:18] I took a little talk year I wrote a
[1:16:23] Brandon priest a series of them who is
[1:16:26] this
[1:16:27] who is this but actually what I want to
[1:16:30] look into this morning is from Marca
[1:16:33] chapter 7 verse 6.
[1:16:35] a Man's enemy are the mans of his own
[1:16:39] house
[1:16:42] praise the Lord
[1:16:43] a Man's enemy are the mans of his own
[1:16:48] house then I was I was uh
[1:16:54] City in there a little bit in and what I
[1:16:56] was trying to to
[1:16:59] write that as a as a sub
[1:17:03] title or subject or inspiration
[1:17:07] whichever way we want to term it
[1:17:11] writing a man's anime
[1:17:14] uh the mans of his own house that's
[1:17:17] that's the way that Mike has said it in
[1:17:19] Micah chapter 7 I was writing there and
[1:17:22] it just it just you're just like a flash
[1:17:24] to my mind a Man's enemy are the members
[1:17:27] of his own house and I was thinking
[1:17:30] about the members of his body
[1:17:33] praise the Lord
[1:17:34] that's where my mind was going uh
[1:17:37] because brother Branham said you are
[1:17:39] your own enemy
[1:17:40] amen he says my worst enemy is William
[1:17:43] Branham
[1:17:44] so uh that's where we want to go this
[1:17:47] morning so don't start don't start
[1:17:49] running your mind on your children or on
[1:17:51] your husband or on your wife look at
[1:17:54] your own house amen look at your own
[1:17:57] house look at the members look at your
[1:17:59] attitude look at your habits amen
[1:18:02] because there are all of the things that
[1:18:04] that are worrying against you amen so I
[1:18:08] think I free myself from the hope this
[1:18:09] morning praise the Lord
[1:18:12] amen we want to thank the Lord for that
[1:18:16] but uh one of the reasons why my mind I
[1:18:20] came to death is because if you remember
[1:18:23] in Marca chapter 5 there was word uh the
[1:18:27] prophecy of little Beth to him came out
[1:18:30] of and and that prophecy was pointed out
[1:18:35] to the wise man when they when they came
[1:18:37] over in uh
[1:18:39] looking for uh the one the Worcester
[1:18:44] they have followed for we have seen his
[1:18:47] side in the East and we have come to
[1:18:49] worship Him amen praise the Lord
[1:18:53] amen uh
[1:18:56] I was I was listening to a friend of
[1:18:58] mine he was preaching he said he says
[1:19:00] this he said he said wise man goes to
[1:19:03] church amen he says wise man goes to
[1:19:06] church they see the star and he goes to
[1:19:08] worship
[1:19:09] he says so if you are watching this age
[1:19:11] that's the best place to go to go to
[1:19:14] church
[1:19:16] praise the Lord
[1:19:18] now so uh that brought the the breath of
[1:19:22] Jesus and then I'm I was looking at us I
[1:19:25] was I was telling this uh during the
[1:19:28] week
[1:19:29] then my mind went over to their
[1:19:31] scripture that amends uh anime the man
[1:19:35] of his own house and uh even our lord
[1:19:39] Jesus referred to it uh you know he he
[1:19:43] referred to that scripture but uh this
[1:19:48] morning before we we do that we want to
[1:19:51] look at this this Grace scene Wednesday
[1:19:53] night we brought a little bit on that
[1:19:56] talking about uh
[1:20:05] the two period of time that Jesus
[1:20:12] how to cleanse the temple it was at the
[1:20:15] beginning of his ministry and the end of
[1:20:17] his ministry now if you read uh
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:22] the gospel and uh and and in a way that
[1:20:25] many many of the the scholars write the
[1:20:29] scripture
[1:20:30] he almost looks like Jesus
[1:20:34] only went to Jerusalem during the time
[1:20:36] of the feast
[1:20:38] but you have to realize that uh there
[1:20:42] were there were many times of the feast
[1:20:45] that he went to Jerusalem praise the
[1:20:47] Lord and uh and and this was the time of
[1:20:51] the Passover
[1:20:53] this was the time of the Passover you
[1:20:56] have to we have to what I want I'm
[1:20:58] trusting the Lord to do is to kind of
[1:21:00] create a a picture in our Imam in our
[1:21:03] mind this morning I'm not a good person
[1:21:06] to dramatize but I will try my best now
[1:21:09] so you have to realize that this is the
[1:21:12] time of the Passover and the Passover
[1:21:14] was very very significant to uh the
[1:21:19] Jewish people
[1:21:21] to the Jews or in their mind they
[1:21:24] remember the time that Moses brought
[1:21:27] them out of Egypt
[1:21:29] praise the Lord
[1:21:31] amen so every time they they celebrated
[1:21:36] this Passover
[1:21:38] they uh they are looking for God to
[1:21:43] raise up their Prophet like unto Moses
[1:21:47] amen they are looking for God to raise
[1:21:51] up their Prophet like unto Moses so
[1:21:55] yerry said now Jesus coming in and they
[1:21:59] are seeing you know uh uh trying to
[1:22:03] identify his ministry with the scripture
[1:22:06] they are they uh I mean Nicodemus came
[1:22:09] up and and and confessed by night that
[1:22:13] we We believe We who we the San
[1:22:16] hindrance
[1:22:17] the council it was made out of the
[1:22:21] Pharisees and the Sadducees we believe
[1:22:23] that you are a man
[1:22:26] sent from God no man can do this
[1:22:30] praise the Lord so these are the things
[1:22:33] that they are talking in their meetings
[1:22:35] they are talking behind those and uh uh
[1:22:40] but yet you have to realize that a
[1:22:44] you have to realize that uh uh the
[1:22:48] people at that time they were at such a
[1:22:51] place where you we know their room at
[1:22:54] the time was ruling the word and they
[1:22:57] were they were on the Roman governance
[1:23:00] but uh uh uh they were not they were not
[1:23:05] willing to submit themselves to that
[1:23:07] because they were always believing that
[1:23:10] God promised them a son of David that
[1:23:13] would come upon the throne
[1:23:15] praise the Lord
[1:23:17] so this was a tense moment this was a
[1:23:22] very very tense moment for the people at
[1:23:25] that time
[1:23:27] with all that they have seen
[1:23:30] in the ministry of Jesus Christ you know
[1:23:34] brother Branham told us there were a lot
[1:23:36] of secret Believers not only Jairus
[1:23:38] there were a lot of them that were
[1:23:40] secret believers
[1:23:42] praise the Lord
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] I mean there is nowhere we heard about
[1:23:48] uh Joseph amateus until after the death
[1:23:54] he showed up too he was a secret
[1:23:56] believer
[1:23:58] so there were many secret Believers and
[1:24:01] all they were all standing by and
[1:24:03] waiting for is there are four
[1:24:06] identification where they can see this
[1:24:09] man just like uh Moses you know
[1:24:12] challenging
[1:24:14] now there are few things as we are in
[1:24:16] this period there are a few things I
[1:24:18] want to point out before I go into my
[1:24:20] message this morning you remember that
[1:24:22] pilot
[1:24:24] uh uh we we would talk about him he was
[1:24:27] a young uh uh Roman prefect okay they
[1:24:33] are they have just started giving him
[1:24:35] some influence so now he's assigned to
[1:24:39] uh uh Jerusalem to be able to come uh
[1:24:46] you know all the little riots that were
[1:24:48] coming up because you have to realize
[1:24:51] John the Baptist has just come
[1:24:53] and then he's preaching the kingdom of
[1:24:56] God he's creating a sin praise the Lord
[1:24:59] and the people are murmuring is this the
[1:25:03] Maasai they went to meet him are you the
[1:25:05] Messiah are you Elijah or are you that
[1:25:07] prophet
[1:25:09] praise the Lord so Rome is getting worse
[1:25:13] that Elena is rising
[1:25:19] praise the Lord
[1:25:20] after the wise man would travel and come
[1:25:24] into Jerusalem where is he born King of
[1:25:27] the Jews
[1:25:29] Rome is getting worse
[1:25:34] that there's a leader among these people
[1:25:37] so now the need to send somebody that
[1:25:41] will be able to calm the crowd and get
[1:25:44] the people down get their loyalty back
[1:25:46] to Rome
[1:25:49] so pilate was the one they sent he was a
[1:25:52] young young man
[1:25:53] he was not an old man he was a young
[1:25:55] prefect
[1:25:57] praise the Lord
[1:25:59] another saying there that we have to
[1:26:01] wash here is there tell when Talent had
[1:26:04] the privilege now to to uh to have Jesus
[1:26:09] uh that there's a beautiful story there
[1:26:11] there's a beautiful picture
[1:26:13] uh
[1:26:16] but
[1:26:17] pilot
[1:26:20] Rome at a time
[1:26:23] was the one that was appointing whoever
[1:26:27] was the priest
[1:26:28] so the priests clarifies it was a
[1:26:31] political office
[1:26:33] it was not a religious office
[1:26:37] praise the Lord it was a political
[1:26:40] office they appointed whoever the priest
[1:26:43] was at the time
[1:26:44] are we together amen I'm trying to
[1:26:47] create a picture here so I can find find
[1:26:50] a place to put my foot amen so uh uh we
[1:26:55] will see here that when uh
[1:26:59] uh pilate was uh you know interrogating
[1:27:03] our lord Jesus he got to a place where
[1:27:07] he uh pick up
[1:27:10] uh
[1:27:12] a place in the Torah where at every
[1:27:14] feast day there is one that must be
[1:27:16] released onto the people
[1:27:19] and then uh the whole scene of barabars
[1:27:22] came
[1:27:22] on the scene
[1:27:24] now the reason why I want to drive to
[1:27:27] this is the other you will see what the
[1:27:30] people
[1:27:31] shouted and says you know crucify him
[1:27:35] give us barbers
[1:27:37] now if you read the gospel you will
[1:27:40] realize that uh Barabas the Bible says
[1:27:44] that uh you know he killed a man
[1:27:48] like amen
[1:27:50] and what was that actually was because
[1:27:53] uh and and and you know a Barabas will
[1:27:56] not be arrested unless this was a
[1:28:00] political sin so it is is looking more
[1:28:03] close like uh this was a Roman soldier
[1:28:06] that he killed
[1:28:11] praise the Lord
[1:28:13] so right at that scene the people who
[1:28:16] see Barabbas to be a more revolutionary
[1:28:23] amen this man Jesus
[1:28:27] he healed our sake
[1:28:29] he's raising our dead
[1:28:32] but he's not challenging
[1:28:35] the Roman Authority
[1:28:37] even though he's talking about
[1:28:40] there's a kingdom that is coming
[1:28:43] praise the Lord
[1:28:46] so you see the people were ready to get
[1:28:49] behind Jesus
[1:28:51] emotionally
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:55] they were they were looking for somebody
[1:28:58] they will you know create a riot so they
[1:29:01] can stand against Rome
[1:29:06] praise the Lord
[1:29:07] you have to remember even just before
[1:29:10] his Ascension
[1:29:11] they asked you is this the time
[1:29:14] that you're going to restore unto us
[1:29:17] the kingdom of David
[1:29:20] praise the Lord
[1:29:22] amen now so you see those were all of
[1:29:26] the things that were happening at that
[1:29:28] time
[1:29:29] there were all of those things that were
[1:29:31] happening at that time I'm going to
[1:29:33] point out some few things here let's
[1:29:35] look in Luke chapter 22 quickly
[1:29:47] when you go through
[1:29:48] the gospel you pick up bit and pieces
[1:29:57] but when you come over here to Luke
[1:29:59] chapter 22
[1:30:08] praise the Lord
[1:30:13] now if you read
[1:30:17] Luke chapter 22
[1:30:19] you get down to verse
[1:30:25] 66.
[1:30:27] let me start from there
[1:30:31] now what what are the what picture is
[1:30:33] going to be uh I create a year for us
[1:30:37] that I want for us to see
[1:30:39] is the other
[1:30:44] Jesus coming into Jerusalem that we just
[1:30:48] read
[1:30:49] he came
[1:30:52] at this time of the Passover
[1:30:55] and now you have to realize that uh
[1:30:59] uh Moses back in Exeter
[1:31:04] this was during the the the the moon of
[1:31:07] Nissan
[1:31:08] and the sacrifice had to be examined
[1:31:12] four days
[1:31:16] praise the Lord
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:18] so Jesus his entry into Jerusalem is
[1:31:23] just around that time
[1:31:26] he came exactly on point of the
[1:31:29] scripture
[1:31:31] praise the Lord and now so when you read
[1:31:33] from uh Luke 22 you will see that
[1:31:39] Jesus there's a place I want us to get
[1:31:42] to so we will not read all of that but
[1:31:44] you will realize that Jesus had the
[1:31:47] privilege to be examined first but
[1:31:51] the priests
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:56] amen they call him to be examined by the
[1:31:59] priests and then after that they took
[1:32:02] him over to pilate for him to be a
[1:32:05] zombie
[1:32:07] praise the Lord and then after that Paul
[1:32:11] has sent him over to herop to be a
[1:32:13] zombie
[1:32:16] praise the Lord
[1:32:18] amen he had to he had to go through all
[1:32:21] of there because I call him towards
[1:32:24] Moses said was that the lamb that was
[1:32:27] going to be sacrificed for the Passover
[1:32:30] have to be examined terribly you have to
[1:32:32] take four days to examine it for no
[1:32:35] blemish
[1:32:38] amen praise the Lord
[1:32:40] so he was examine the first evening by
[1:32:44] the high priest they sent him over to
[1:32:47] college the second day and over to Herod
[1:32:50] and Hera sent him back to Poland and
[1:32:53] every one of them said they found no
[1:32:55] fought in him
[1:33:00] are we together
[1:33:07] so but I want for us to look at chapter
[1:33:09] 23 Luke 23 verse 12.
[1:33:33] Luke 23 verse 12 praise the Lord
[1:33:40] it looks like I have a stinking
[1:33:43] here
[1:33:50] okay then the Bible says and the same
[1:33:53] day pilate and Herod
[1:33:55] were made friends together for before
[1:33:58] they were at immunity between themselves
[1:34:02] now so the the the the
[1:34:11] even at his death he created a
[1:34:14] friendship
[1:34:15] okay
[1:34:18] and about what what the picture here
[1:34:21] that I wanted to for us to see is that
[1:34:24] both
[1:34:25] the the Council of the priesthood
[1:34:30] uh Harem now Hera was a local Governor
[1:34:34] but he was serving under the Roman
[1:34:37] government
[1:34:38] praise the Lord
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:41] if we want to look a little bit into
[1:34:43] their history is the other uh
[1:34:49] you realize that even Jesus he called
[1:34:53] Pharaoh uh you call hero a fox all
[1:34:56] because that he was an Edomite
[1:35:00] he was not a Jew
[1:35:03] praise the Lord but he was appointed
[1:35:07] to be a government or Governor over
[1:35:10] there in Galilee
[1:35:12] so in some sense he was also working for
[1:35:15] the Roman government
[1:35:17] but you have to understand the the
[1:35:20] politics that is playing here these
[1:35:22] people are ruled by the Romans that that
[1:35:26] do not believe in their God
[1:35:28] the Romans believe that the emperor was
[1:35:31] their God
[1:35:32] praise the Lord and wherever that room
[1:35:36] ruled they bring the people
[1:35:39] to believe in the Emperor as their God
[1:35:42] but they could not do their year in
[1:35:45] Jerusalem
[1:35:47] because the Jews will not worship no one
[1:35:50] else but the one God the god of Abraham
[1:35:53] Isaac and Jacob
[1:35:55] praise the Lord amen so you've seen here
[1:35:59] that the Council of the high priest
[1:36:03] the the the the the Roman
[1:36:07] present palette and also the local
[1:36:11] government Governor they all have to
[1:36:14] come into agreement
[1:36:17] for the word to be crucified
[1:36:23] praise the Lord now brother bran I'm
[1:36:25] there with that in United signing time
[1:36:28] he told us that's exactly what is going
[1:36:30] to happen for the word to be crucified
[1:36:33] they have to be a uniting
[1:36:36] so that was the reason why I point out
[1:36:38] that scripture even though they were not
[1:36:39] friends
[1:36:42] but when it comes to this place of
[1:36:44] destroying the word
[1:36:46] they had to put their differences apart
[1:36:51] praise the Lord they have to put their
[1:36:54] differences apart now where I'm coming
[1:36:56] to with all of this is there because the
[1:36:58] same thing is facing you and myself
[1:37:03] okay the same thing is facing you and
[1:37:05] myself that's what that's where I'm
[1:37:06] coming to with all of this but I just
[1:37:08] want to get into into that into that
[1:37:11] history a little bit so we we can see we
[1:37:14] realize that there were many men that uh
[1:37:18] that that that strive to deliver Israel
[1:37:23] even just just before the time just just
[1:37:26] before uh palette was sentient it was
[1:37:30] the rising of uh of uh John the Baptist
[1:37:33] and uh and and and and all the Roman
[1:37:37] that was growing about of one born King
[1:37:39] of the Jews
[1:37:40] that their room had to send a prefect to
[1:37:44] make sure that there is no King that
[1:37:46] rise under
[1:37:48] no King besides Caesar
[1:37:54] are we together
[1:37:59] now so uh
[1:38:02] uh
[1:38:06] there was one slave called Simon
[1:38:09] and uh
[1:38:12] uh there was also a shepherd
[1:38:15] uh I trusted and one Judas of Galilee
[1:38:19] all of these men uh they created some
[1:38:23] some Riot they gathered some group and
[1:38:26] they were determined to deliver the
[1:38:29] people but Rome have to stamp them down
[1:38:34] praise the Lord amen so it brings back
[1:38:38] into picture why
[1:38:41] the people who have prepared Barabbas
[1:38:45] over Jesus
[1:38:49] because whatever his art was they felt
[1:38:52] like he did it for the Jewish people
[1:38:55] he rebelled that he's he stood against
[1:38:58] Rome
[1:38:59] but you see that Jesus Was preparing a
[1:39:04] spiritual Kingdom
[1:39:06] amen he was bringing a king in our
[1:39:09] hearts
[1:39:12] praise the Lord because even even uh if
[1:39:18] he would have set up a physical Kingdom
[1:39:21] they will have still rebelled against
[1:39:23] him
[1:39:24] because their heart has gone away from
[1:39:27] the Lord
[1:39:31] even in the world like unto Moses when
[1:39:33] Moses was saying
[1:39:36] praise the Lord
[1:39:37] amen when Moses was sent to deliver
[1:39:40] Moses never had it easy
[1:39:43] why because the people heart has already
[1:39:46] been taken by Egypt
[1:39:50] Egypt had their hearts
[1:39:53] they were just only wearing an outward
[1:39:57] identification by Egypt had their heart
[1:40:03] history will tell us you will see why
[1:40:06] Quran and dating and all of those men
[1:40:08] that gave Moses problem in a Wilderness
[1:40:11] they were always pointing back to Egypt
[1:40:16] they were always pointing back to Egypt
[1:40:18] and history have taught us this they are
[1:40:21] the uh you know whenever a people are in
[1:40:25] are in captivity or the people has been
[1:40:28] captured what will happen is they are
[1:40:31] the uh uh the the dominant power is
[1:40:35] going to choose some men from among the
[1:40:37] very people so there are uh uh the
[1:40:40] ruling power is going to choose our
[1:40:42] police from ourself
[1:40:46] hmm
[1:40:47] praise the Lord so as long as we can get
[1:40:51] few men that knows what they believe and
[1:40:54] knows uh you know how we can get to the
[1:40:57] depths of their secret we can pin them
[1:40:59] down
[1:41:02] praise the Lord
[1:41:03] during the Holocaust it was the same it
[1:41:06] was Jews on Jews
[1:41:12] praise the Lord
[1:41:15] amen
[1:41:17] and don't and don't think that
[1:41:20] you will be spared the same
[1:41:25] precious Lord
[1:41:27] it would take people that I've hanged
[1:41:29] around this message people that knows
[1:41:32] what the co-h people that knows
[1:41:34] everything about the the five coming
[1:41:36] about Elijah they know what the pillar
[1:41:38] of fire is you know everything about
[1:41:40] this message
[1:41:42] it will take those very same people
[1:41:44] to be able
[1:41:46] to persecute us
[1:41:49] so a Man's enemy is man's from his own
[1:41:52] house
[1:41:55] they have always been like that
[1:41:58] praise the Lord
[1:42:01] a talking
[1:42:03] to commit the first murder
[1:42:06] anime was a man of his own house
[1:42:11] praise the Lord
[1:42:16] are we together
[1:42:20] Ishmael and Isaac came from the same
[1:42:22] house
[1:42:26] but they are at local head
[1:42:28] Issa and Jacob came from the same womb
[1:42:34] but they are at local heritage
[1:42:37] it talked Joseph Brothers
[1:42:40] to sell him
[1:42:43] to Egypt
[1:42:47] praise the Lord
[1:42:49] amen so it would take the ones that have
[1:42:52] hanged around this message but never got
[1:42:54] to a talking life
[1:43:00] they hang around the message but they
[1:43:01] never got a truth talking
[1:43:05] I thought I would speak on the truth
[1:43:06] talking tonight
[1:43:08] for the communion
[1:43:10] they never got a truth talking
[1:43:13] praise the Lord
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:18] and what was that truth talking
[1:43:22] rehab was the one that used that
[1:43:24] statement that told the spies
[1:43:27] give me a truth token
[1:43:31] praise the Lord
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:35] and what they said and respond to her
[1:43:37] our life for yours
[1:43:44] the true talking is not a church
[1:43:46] membership
[1:43:47] the true talking is alive on this plane
[1:43:56] praise the Lord
[1:43:58] it's not how long you've been around the
[1:44:00] message it's not whether you are born in
[1:44:02] the message is now who I mean uh I mean
[1:44:05] how you grew up in the message is the
[1:44:07] life of Jesus Christ on this plane
[1:44:17] are we together
[1:44:19] amen so you see that's that's uh that's
[1:44:23] that's where we are going yet even
[1:44:25] though we we're trying to make this
[1:44:26] picture of the Passover but it has to
[1:44:30] take
[1:44:32] it has to take the Jews and and in the
[1:44:34] way that it was it is it is it is uh we
[1:44:37] we can look at it in the place of uh you
[1:44:40] know of of Prophecy being fulfilled but
[1:44:43] prophecy is always fulfilled when they
[1:44:46] when when the world can be able to get
[1:44:48] the people whose heart are in that
[1:44:51] direction
[1:44:58] praise the Lord
[1:45:05] so we see here the other uh
[1:45:09] we look at a portion of that
[1:45:12] in some on Wednesday night uh Jesus
[1:45:16] coming there in Jerusalem he came he
[1:45:19] came right down that path
[1:45:21] you know he came right down their
[1:45:24] scripture that there was one of the
[1:45:28] first time that Jesus publicly declared
[1:45:31] that he was the Messiah
[1:45:37] praise the Lord
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] for him to go uh
[1:45:43] in the public scene and I said you just
[1:45:47] see the same there let's take a little
[1:45:49] picture Brown spoke about that and
[1:45:52] talking about pre-arranged and uh uh uh
[1:45:56] Jesus sent his disciple and said go go
[1:46:00] down to the setting place you will see a
[1:46:03] coach dead and an eyes you know lose
[1:46:04] them and bring If any man asks you say
[1:46:06] Sir the master
[1:46:09] see I should bring it
[1:46:12] praise the Lord
[1:46:24] Braham said this in perfect fit it's not
[1:46:27] in my note there but I will read it he
[1:46:29] says I want to say that I believe every
[1:46:33] scripture
[1:46:35] he says every bit of it is truth
[1:46:38] there's a credit today that that don't
[1:46:41] want to believe that a Creator once said
[1:46:44] that when Jesus sent those disciples to
[1:46:47] where the cut was tied
[1:46:50] where two ways met
[1:46:53] that he pre-arranged that
[1:46:56] to where the cut was tied
[1:46:59] see they don't understand God
[1:47:03] pre-arrange it
[1:47:05] amen
[1:47:07] he says it was God that did pre-arrange
[1:47:10] it
[1:47:13] now to just to just see the picture
[1:47:17] Jesus telling his disciple you just go
[1:47:20] down there you know where there are two
[1:47:22] Street meets you see the house that is
[1:47:24] there there is a there is a cause and
[1:47:26] and and if you look at it in the
[1:47:28] scripture you will realize that they are
[1:47:31] called that Jesus sent for has never
[1:47:34] been ruled upon nobody have ever sat on
[1:47:37] it before
[1:47:40] praise the Lord
[1:47:43] now for him to know exactly where it was
[1:47:47] and telling them go and get it if any
[1:47:50] man asks you just tell him that the
[1:47:52] master sent for it
[1:47:55] praise the Lord
[1:47:58] and that is the same way that that God
[1:48:03] predestinate Our Lives
[1:48:06] that's the same way that uh he's he's
[1:48:09] he's dealing with us
[1:48:12] there's a time a point of time that is
[1:48:15] set
[1:48:16] we can fool around and play it around
[1:48:19] but uh if if God has placed our names on
[1:48:24] that long Book of Life he has a way to
[1:48:27] be able to get us
[1:48:31] praise the Lord
[1:48:34] is all part of his work of redemption
[1:48:39] let me read this yet I will start with
[1:48:41] this brother Braham said in the uh Angel
[1:48:44] of the Covenant
[1:48:48] he says and sometimes
[1:48:50] some of your own household
[1:48:54] will be the ones that will discourage
[1:48:56] you first
[1:48:59] when you are claiming God's promise to
[1:49:02] yourself
[1:49:11] praise the Lord
[1:49:19] we read a Psalm I mean
[1:49:22] Acts chapter 7.
[1:49:25] when we were talking about how
[1:49:28] Stephen brought it out that uh when you
[1:49:31] look at the way that God deals with
[1:49:33] Israel
[1:49:35] they don't always get it the first time
[1:49:38] and that is not only with Israel that is
[1:49:40] with the Fallen nature of men
[1:49:43] we don't get it the first time sometimes
[1:49:45] we think we get it but we don't get it
[1:49:47] the first time
[1:49:48] praise the Lord he has to bring us
[1:49:50] around the block again before we say oh
[1:49:53] now I see it
[1:49:56] praise the Lord
[1:49:58] now so uh uh uh
[1:50:04] we can look in the life of Joseph and
[1:50:06] then we will see that I mean he's born
[1:50:09] with um he's he's born a dreamer
[1:50:12] nothing he had to do God gave him that
[1:50:14] gift
[1:50:16] praise the Lord
[1:50:19] amen
[1:50:20] and uh and then right there we also see
[1:50:24] the other you know he's he's he's
[1:50:27] dreaming these uh uh uh having these
[1:50:30] dreams how his brothers are buying to
[1:50:33] him and uh uh actually the dream they
[1:50:36] didn't say his brothers you know he's
[1:50:38] talked about the the Stars
[1:50:41] amen let's talk about the you know the
[1:50:43] moon and and the Sun and all of that but
[1:50:46] then his father is uh you know uh kind
[1:50:49] of for reading with the number of stars
[1:50:52] that is buying down in the moon and the
[1:50:54] sun you know uh you know they are
[1:50:57] reading between it you have to realize
[1:50:58] that these people that God was dealing
[1:51:01] with amen and uh they had they did not
[1:51:05] have the Ten Commandments at that time
[1:51:06] but they had a history of how God there
[1:51:09] with their father Abraham and how God
[1:51:12] did with Isaac they had a history about
[1:51:15] the flawed and all of that they had they
[1:51:17] had those things so they knew that you
[1:51:19] know God speaks through those things
[1:51:21] amen so here is sitting down they are
[1:51:23] reading between is this uh what what do
[1:51:26] you mean by these dreams are you are you
[1:51:28] saying that God you know all that you're
[1:51:30] saying that we are going to Barbie for
[1:51:32] you now is creating and every time he
[1:51:35] had the dream you know he just he just
[1:51:37] he don't worry about it he just come and
[1:51:39] tell him praise the Lord now you have to
[1:51:42] realize that he was not giving them that
[1:51:44] interpretation
[1:51:46] he was just telling them that I had a
[1:51:49] dream
[1:51:50] praise the Lord
[1:51:51] did he know the interpretation I guess
[1:51:54] not
[1:51:57] he just know and remember what he
[1:51:59] dreamed
[1:52:01] and he says it to them
[1:52:04] praise the Lord
[1:52:05] but now we realize here that uh uh that
[1:52:10] man has started creating an envied and
[1:52:13] like brother Branham would say jealousy
[1:52:14] because of jealousy they had to sell
[1:52:17] their brother over to to Egypt
[1:52:21] praise the Lord
[1:52:23] the same with David David came out and
[1:52:26] then he's telling his brother how a lion
[1:52:29] came to take a bed and then he used his
[1:52:32] slingshot and he got the lion down
[1:52:36] serious David are you serious
[1:52:40] a lion praise the Lord and then he
[1:52:43] coming back again again another time and
[1:52:46] and uh and and then he's telling his
[1:52:49] brothers how a bear you know was taking
[1:52:51] one of his little lamb and then he used
[1:52:55] his slingshot and then he got the bed
[1:52:57] down
[1:52:58] praise the Lord
[1:53:02] now whether you know the brothers are
[1:53:05] thinking about uh yeah maybe he had a
[1:53:08] good dream maybe he's just dreaming you
[1:53:10] know and all of that but uh uh uh David
[1:53:13] was going through these experiences amen
[1:53:16] he was the woman and and and and as we
[1:53:19] looked back and look into the story we
[1:53:21] can sit here and read the scripture and
[1:53:23] we can say God was dealing with him in
[1:53:26] the infancy of his gift
[1:53:28] which of course he he too never
[1:53:31] understood
[1:53:32] praise the Lord
[1:53:34] maybe he's having this complex why are
[1:53:37] they not believing me
[1:53:41] where I lie to you why why are you guys
[1:53:43] smoking at me like that
[1:53:45] praise the Lord maybe he's having this
[1:53:48] struggle but uh I mean they've been all
[1:53:52] the older than him they know what a lion
[1:53:54] is
[1:53:55] so are you trying to say that you are a
[1:53:57] lot of something
[1:54:00] praise the Lord
[1:54:02] and then you know in in all of that
[1:54:06] but we will see there there because
[1:54:10] they then now believe
[1:54:13] his testimony
[1:54:16] when
[1:54:17] Goliath presented himself
[1:54:21] and David took food to his brothers his
[1:54:25] brothers were the first one
[1:54:28] to count him out
[1:54:32] praise the Lord
[1:54:34] amen because they did not believe his
[1:54:37] the testimony about his experience on
[1:54:40] the backside of the desert
[1:54:43] because Joseph Brothers they met uh uh
[1:54:47] believe his dreams or take it to be a
[1:54:50] spiritual dream and prayed about it they
[1:54:53] they plot
[1:54:55] to get rid of him
[1:55:00] praise the Lord
[1:55:02] amen the plot to get rid of him now you
[1:55:05] see the thing when you look at it uh the
[1:55:08] picture I want for us to see here is
[1:55:10] that is their brothers they lost their
[1:55:13] brother even uh uh uh Ruben the
[1:55:17] firstborn he asked no we should not kill
[1:55:19] our brother unless he got him out of the
[1:55:21] hole maybe let's sell him you know so
[1:55:24] you see the thing there is there it was
[1:55:26] not there they hated their brother there
[1:55:28] was a spiritual gift that they did not
[1:55:31] understand
[1:55:34] praise the Lord
[1:55:36] how can a man that is born of an
[1:55:39] illegitimate parents Open the Eyes of a
[1:55:42] blind
[1:55:43] the Pharisees cannot come to term to be
[1:55:46] able to accept it
[1:55:52] praise the Lord
[1:55:55] it was a spiritual gift
[1:56:00] and it was God that was moving in the
[1:56:02] midst of his people
[1:56:08] are we together
[1:56:14] so brother Abraham says sometimes
[1:56:18] some of your own household will be the
[1:56:21] ones that will discourage you first
[1:56:24] when you are claiming God's promise for
[1:56:27] yourself
[1:56:30] praise the Lord
[1:56:32] and just like it's in the natural also
[1:56:35] us in a spiritual
[1:56:37] our our our world uh uh our our genetics
[1:56:42] and all of those things
[1:56:44] we are born from our parents you know
[1:56:48] with Father you know the 23 chromosomes
[1:56:51] here and there when that new birth comes
[1:56:54] in
[1:56:56] praise the Lord
[1:56:58] it's very strange to our human nature
[1:57:05] we have all of our crisis
[1:57:08] because
[1:57:10] of a strange seed that is in US
[1:57:14] we have all the wars that we go through
[1:57:19] praise the Lord there is something
[1:57:21] Supernatural that is birth in the heart
[1:57:24] of the believer
[1:57:29] that I was seeing for nature
[1:57:32] cannot contend with
[1:57:37] praise the Lord
[1:57:42] a man's anime
[1:57:46] are the ones of his own household
[1:57:49] praise the Lord
[1:57:51] we see it all down through through the
[1:57:54] scripture where you can look at it all
[1:57:56] there in history you know what I said as
[1:57:59] I was looking at they say I mean there
[1:58:01] were just a lot of thoughts that was
[1:58:02] going through my mind just like I said
[1:58:04] yeah I mean you you read about the
[1:58:07] Holocaust and and watch some of the
[1:58:09] things that that took place there I mean
[1:58:12] uh and and the anime knows that he can
[1:58:15] be able to use that
[1:58:18] whenever he can get the wounds of our
[1:58:21] own house
[1:58:23] to turn against us
[1:58:26] praise the Lord
[1:58:28] amen
[1:58:33] I mean if we were testified about the
[1:58:35] Lord
[1:58:36] and then live a life contrary to our
[1:58:39] testimony how we expect the people to
[1:58:41] believe
[1:58:46] amen
[1:58:47] how we expect the ones that we are we
[1:58:49] are testifying to to believe
[1:58:52] they will not only believe our words
[1:58:54] they are looking at our life
[1:59:03] praise the Lord
[1:59:08] and they have always been like that
[1:59:10] David said in the psalm I got some few
[1:59:12] verses I know down yet I want to read
[1:59:14] through them quickly
[1:59:17] Psalm 41 verse 9.
[1:59:39] he said yeah my own family of friends in
[1:59:42] whom I trusted
[1:59:44] which did eat my bread I lifted up his
[1:59:48] Heat against me
[1:59:50] but thou O Lord be merciful unto me
[1:59:53] praise the Lord
[1:59:54] we see David saying that but we know
[1:59:57] that he's also speaking on the prophecy
[2:00:01] praise the Lord
[2:00:05] Psalm 55
[2:00:25] for it was not an anime that reproached
[2:00:28] me
[2:00:29] then I could have bought it
[2:00:31] neither was a he that hated me
[2:00:35] that that uh
[2:00:37] magnify himself against me then I will
[2:00:40] have held myself from him but it was but
[2:00:43] it was death
[2:00:45] and man mind equal my God and my
[2:00:49] acquaintance
[2:00:51] praise the Lord
[2:00:54] you can see they are right in the
[2:00:57] prophecy the Fulfillment there with
[2:00:59] Judas
[2:01:01] being a very one one that was counted
[2:01:04] among the twelve
[2:01:07] praise the Lord
[2:01:08] and all the people that are saying all
[2:01:12] of this nasty thing about Christianity
[2:01:14] now's the thing about the message of
[2:01:17] people that sat in the Pew just like you
[2:01:19] and myself
[2:01:24] praise the Lord
[2:01:27] you see that's the reason why I'm saying
[2:01:29] they're talking life we must not take it
[2:01:32] for church membership
[2:01:38] if we don't come to that place word
[2:01:42] Christ is the center we really have the
[2:01:45] Revelation is not just a head knowledge
[2:01:49] but it's a revelation just like Paul
[2:01:52] said is no longer either liveth but it's
[2:01:55] Christ that is living in me
[2:02:00] if the word If the message don't become
[2:02:02] that to you like I said before is just a
[2:02:06] period of time
[2:02:15] it's just a period of time
[2:02:21] are we together
[2:02:24] but it was the other man money equal my
[2:02:27] God my acquaintance
[2:02:29] we talked sweet Council together and
[2:02:31] walk into the house of God in company
[2:02:38] but he's the very same one that
[2:02:40] reproaches me
[2:02:44] praise the Lord
[2:02:48] we can
[2:02:49] sing the songs of Zion like we said the
[2:02:52] very ones that say hosanna Hosanna was
[2:02:55] the same ones that said crucify him
[2:03:10] God has sent his word to be able to get
[2:03:13] his children home
[2:03:16] amen Amen brother Ben I mean the church
[2:03:19] age book he would say is this
[2:03:23] he says now we can see
[2:03:25] why there were two Vine one Vine uh uh
[2:03:31] one truth and one force now we can see
[2:03:35] why Abraham had two sons
[2:03:38] one after the flesh
[2:03:40] they are persecuted Isaac and one
[2:03:45] and one after the promise
[2:03:49] praise the Lord
[2:03:51] amen
[2:03:53] Paul says uh henceforth we know no man
[2:03:56] after the flesh
[2:04:00] praise the Lord
[2:04:02] so it's not how much a person says I
[2:04:04] believe the message or how much a person
[2:04:07] can give their attendance is how much
[2:04:10] you are Standing on the Promises
[2:04:13] how much you are taking these promises
[2:04:15] to deal with your situations
[2:04:18] man
[2:04:21] God is not counting his numbers by the
[2:04:25] flesh
[2:04:26] of men that I gather together
[2:04:30] amen
[2:04:32] he's looking at his promise brother
[2:04:34] Branham says now we can see why there
[2:04:37] were two Vines the force Vine and the
[2:04:40] True Vine we can see why Abraham Abraham
[2:04:43] had two sons one after the flesh they
[2:04:47] are persecuted Isaac
[2:04:50] and one after the promise now we can see
[2:04:53] how that out out
[2:04:55] of the same parent two boys came forth
[2:04:59] as twins
[2:05:01] one knowing and loving the things of God
[2:05:05] and the other knowing much
[2:05:09] of such truth
[2:05:11] but not of The Same Spirit
[2:05:15] and hence persecuted the child that was
[2:05:18] elected
[2:05:20] praise the Lord
[2:05:22] I will say this and I'm trying to say it
[2:05:25] to be able to encourage
[2:05:27] all of you young people
[2:05:29] praise the Lord
[2:05:31] amen because we are we are we are born
[2:05:35] around the message and we uh you know we
[2:05:38] are gathered by Godly Parents and that
[2:05:41] encourage us to go to church and we do
[2:05:44] all of these things you know is is so
[2:05:47] easy for you to take that as the Holy
[2:05:51] Ghost
[2:05:54] but I'll tell you it's a religious
[2:05:56] spirit
[2:06:01] it's a religious spirit
[2:06:04] until you come to a birth
[2:06:08] amen until you come to a birth until
[2:06:11] that word is able to bring all your
[2:06:15] inner desires your inner struggles that
[2:06:18] we don't see
[2:06:20] until that word is able to bring it in
[2:06:23] subjection
[2:06:26] praise the Lord I read that story to you
[2:06:29] before about John Westlake how he had a
[2:06:33] golly mother Susanna Wesley his father
[2:06:36] was a preacher
[2:06:39] and how he grew in the home and his his
[2:06:41] mom was his first uh Sunday school
[2:06:44] teacher and she taught her children
[2:06:47] praise the Lord
[2:06:52] until the honors too when Mama take take
[2:06:55] her apron and put it over her face she
[2:06:57] was praying
[2:06:59] and she never wanted noise
[2:07:02] and those children will sit and wait
[2:07:04] until Mama take her apron down from her
[2:07:07] face
[2:07:08] that was how how much reference that
[2:07:10] they had but John after that I mean he
[2:07:13] went to school and then uh uh he was he
[2:07:17] was even uh ordained as a priest
[2:07:22] praise the Lord
[2:07:24] he was invited to Georgia
[2:07:31] he was invited to Georgia to come and
[2:07:34] preach to an Indian group
[2:07:37] it was on his way to Georgia
[2:07:41] I think when he was returning back
[2:07:43] that he sat with some Germans
[2:07:47] praise the Lord
[2:07:49] amen
[2:07:52] and then when those men started talking
[2:07:54] about life in Christ and he started
[2:07:56] talking about uh uh uh the new breath
[2:07:59] and experience with God that John
[2:08:03] Wesley realized
[2:08:05] that he just had a form of godliness
[2:08:12] praise the Lord
[2:08:15] amen amen
[2:08:17] and then he went back home and and and
[2:08:20] and and he was praying and asking God
[2:08:23] and uh you know and then looking through
[2:08:25] all of his life after all of this went
[2:08:27] to school and you know I'm I'm a priest
[2:08:30] offer of a chopper you know he was
[2:08:32] preaching doing Evangelistic of work and
[2:08:34] yet he never even had and the spirits of
[2:08:37] the new birth
[2:08:43] praise the Lord just driving by a
[2:08:46] religious spirit
[2:08:50] there's a there's a scripture in the
[2:08:52] Bible that uh that was very very John
[2:08:56] Wesley used that all and were very very
[2:08:58] significant to him because after that
[2:09:00] experience he went back and reading his
[2:09:03] Bible where Jesus says you are not far
[2:09:06] from the kingdom
[2:09:09] that scripture just came alive to John
[2:09:12] that you can do all of those things and
[2:09:15] come so close to the kingdom
[2:09:22] praise the Lord let these very people
[2:09:25] waiting for their Messiah waiting for
[2:09:28] their deliverer they use the very
[2:09:30] scripture reading the psalm and the
[2:09:33] persecute the very one
[2:09:35] that they were waiting for
[2:09:38] how many times we use our own attitude
[2:09:41] and we destroy ourselves
[2:09:47] praise the lord we use our little
[2:09:49] religious knowledge
[2:09:51] and we kick ourselves far from the
[2:09:53] promise of God
[2:09:56] because we don't want to wait on God we
[2:09:58] want to make things happen
[2:10:03] praise the lord we can go right into the
[2:10:06] info base of the message and just put a
[2:10:09] word and bring all the quotes out
[2:10:11] and you can know all the costs on the
[2:10:13] subject but yet without a birth
[2:10:16] you will go far away from the promise
[2:10:24] a man's own enemy
[2:10:26] are the names of his house
[2:10:34] praise the Lord
[2:10:36] amen
[2:10:38] this uh
[2:10:40] this birth This Life of Christ must
[2:10:43] bring
[2:10:44] it must bring joy to us it is it must be
[2:10:47] our life
[2:10:48] it's not something that we put on and
[2:10:51] put off
[2:10:54] praise the Lord
[2:10:56] amen we put it on when when when when we
[2:10:59] when we are happy
[2:11:03] and then when things seems not to make
[2:11:06] sense to all we can throw it off at any
[2:11:08] time and then we put up an attitude
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:17] praise the Lord
[2:11:22] Paul says be not deceived God is Not
[2:11:24] mocked
[2:11:28] amen if you saw to the Flesh of the
[2:11:31] flesh you're going to read
[2:11:37] praise the Lord amen if you saw to the
[2:11:40] Flesh of the flesh you're going to reap
[2:11:43] if you are not feeding on the word
[2:11:45] amen
[2:11:47] the prophet said Rapture it Faith are on
[2:11:50] those steps
[2:11:51] if you are not getting yourself into the
[2:11:54] message you are just holding on to some
[2:11:56] kind of for historical knowledge or
[2:11:58] historical idea of oh that's the way we
[2:12:01] used to do it or I remember when this
[2:12:03] was happening
[2:12:06] it's not going to help you in time like
[2:12:08] this
[2:12:14] praise the Lord
[2:12:16] just like I said on Wednesday night the
[2:12:18] Church of the Living God is supposed to
[2:12:20] be on the offense
[2:12:23] but it looks like we we we feel happy
[2:12:26] being on the defense
[2:12:36] praise the Lord let me let me just
[2:12:39] finish with this quote and since we have
[2:12:41] a
[2:12:42] convenience service tonight
[2:12:58] now we can see how they're out of the
[2:13:01] same parents two boys came forth as
[2:13:04] twins one gnawing and loving the things
[2:13:07] of God
[2:13:09] and the other Nori much of the same
[2:13:13] truth
[2:13:14] Nori much of the same truth
[2:13:20] praise the Lord
[2:13:21] but he cannot just come to a life of
[2:13:25] surrender
[2:13:29] knowing the truth but cannot just come
[2:13:32] to a life of surrender
[2:13:43] praise the Lord
[2:13:47] but not of the same spirit and hence
[2:13:50] persecuted a child that was elected god
[2:13:53] with for the sake of the of reprobation
[2:13:58] he reprobates for the sake of the elect
[2:14:02] illit cannot persecute
[2:14:06] foreign
[2:14:08] [Music]
[2:14:18] praise the Lord
[2:14:19] amen you know every time we we read this
[2:14:23] and we say Amen to the words whenever
[2:14:25] whenever we say Amen to the word you
[2:14:28] know what happened in that place you are
[2:14:30] the illit
[2:14:32] foreign
[2:14:37] I'm not saying you shouldn't say Amen to
[2:14:39] the word
[2:14:43] praise the Lord
[2:14:44] yeah I'm just I'm just speaking from
[2:14:46] from uh from a common human habit you
[2:14:50] you you it takes right into your mind
[2:14:53] and and sometimes you you are you are
[2:14:56] you are immediately addressing something
[2:14:59] that you know that is happening right
[2:15:04] praise the Lord
[2:15:12] I will reserve my coming
[2:15:16] and continue to preach
[2:15:20] the elect cannot persecuted
[2:15:24] it is to reprobate that persecute and
[2:15:27] destroy the illit all those reprobates
[2:15:30] are religious
[2:15:32] very smart
[2:15:35] amen
[2:15:39] now I think the other time I was talking
[2:15:41] here then uh I was I was dwelling in the
[2:15:45] same thought
[2:15:46] you know every word where there are Paul
[2:15:50] will use that word uh uh and and that's
[2:15:54] exactly what brother Branham got his
[2:15:57] inspiration when he preached uh uh uh
[2:16:01] entity spirit
[2:16:03] you know which of course he underlining
[2:16:05] the message that in touch in spirit
[2:16:07] world was intellectual spirit
[2:16:10] praise the Lord
[2:16:12] he was talking about intellectual spirit
[2:16:15] so brother Branham in that series of
[2:16:17] demonology he talks about how sickness
[2:16:20] are demons he talks about cancer then
[2:16:22] tobacco losses and all of these other
[2:16:24] sickness how they are demons and they
[2:16:27] come and they feed on the human cells
[2:16:29] amen
[2:16:31] and then he went and talked about uh uh
[2:16:37] uh demonology in the in the spiritual
[2:16:40] Realm
[2:16:41] were you in that in that realm he talks
[2:16:45] about uh evil spirits and all of that
[2:16:49] honor that message brother Branham would
[2:16:51] take the the scripture of where
[2:16:56] Saul when to meet the wish of Indo
[2:17:01] now there's demonology in the spirit
[2:17:04] ring
[2:17:06] okay then demonology in a religious room
[2:17:09] brother Brandon will take when uh uh
[2:17:13] Ahab
[2:17:15] when it got jealous Shepherd
[2:17:19] depending on his uh 400 priests that
[2:17:24] were all the alive spirit
[2:17:29] to convince this righteous man
[2:17:33] for them to go and get a line which of
[2:17:36] course the land was rightly there
[2:17:38] land was one of the land that was set
[2:17:41] aside for a City of Refuge
[2:17:45] but see the picture here people
[2:17:47] it's now what we are achieving is how we
[2:17:50] are going about it
[2:17:53] praise the Lord
[2:17:55] it's how we are going about it
[2:17:58] he's Alias here to get a land
[2:18:03] amen this was the very same person that
[2:18:07] uh that killed neighbor for his for his
[2:18:10] father's land
[2:18:14] you want to set up a a a warrior an
[2:18:18] invasion to go and redeem that land
[2:18:22] a man that will now walk that will not
[2:18:25] honor the Prophet Elijah
[2:18:29] a man that have got himself married over

[2:22:25] persecute and heal it
[2:22:27] will be a reporbid that will persecute
[2:22:30] and destroy those he says and those
[2:22:33] reprobates are religious they are smart
[2:22:35] they are all the king-line serpency line
[2:22:39] he says they bill
[2:22:43] they build their cities they can build
[2:22:45] their Empires and all the why calling on
[2:22:48] God
[2:22:49] they hate the true seed and they will do
[2:22:52] all they can even in the name of the
[2:22:55] Lord
[2:22:56] to destroy God's illiter
[2:23:01] but what did he says

[2:23:25] we need him to uh to uh to to speak
[2:23:29] something about the message we can go
[2:23:31] back to the word and search it out
[2:23:36] not just feeling from things on the
[2:23:38] internet but you can take those things
[2:23:40] go back to the message you will check it

[2:26:31] the Bible says from verse 28 to 38 the
[2:26:34] Bible says saying bless it be the king
[2:26:37] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[2:26:38] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[2:26:42] and some of the Pharisees from a more
[2:26:45] the multitude said unto him Master
[2:26:46] rebuked their disciples
[2:26:49] quiet we don't want the the Romans to
[2:26:52] hear this
[2:26:53] and he answered and said unto them I
[2:26:56] tell you that if this you hold their
[2:26:59] peace the stones will immediately cry
[2:27:02] out
[2:27:02] [Music]

[2:27:07] beheld the city he wept over a saying if
[2:27:11] thou have known even thou at least in
[2:27:15] this thy day
[2:27:20] praise the Lord
[2:27:22] if they have known
[2:27:25] let's think about this
[2:27:27] praise the Lord
[2:27:28] amen
[2:27:31] let's think about this you think about
[2:27:32] this just before we pray
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:35] if there have known even at least in
[2:27:39] this that day the things which belonged
[2:27:42] to that peace forget about uh you know
[2:27:45] the the the the Jews the children of
[2:27:47] Israel
[2:27:49] but just think about just think about
[2:27:51] what is before us
[2:27:55] this your day this day that we are
[2:27:57] living in
[2:28:00] the thing that is given to us

[2:28:05] home peace in our life

[2:28:11] praise the Lord
[2:28:13] are we making use of it
[2:28:17] of it the thing that is given to you for
[2:28:19] your peace Jesus said but now they are
[2:28:24] HID from that eyes you know what
[2:28:27] happened here when Paul speaks in Romans
[2:28:30] about blindness happen in part to the
[2:28:32] Jews right here Jesus is proclaiming
[2:28:36] he's he's prophesying you shall go blind

[2:28:57] rejecting the word the thing that is
[2:29:00] given to you for your peace

[2:29:07] this message should be unto us
[2:29:10] it's not something that we can join is
[2:29:12] giving to us to bring peace in our homes
[2:29:15] peace in our lives
