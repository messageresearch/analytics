[1:24:30] that grace of God
[1:24:32] don't let the enemy
[1:24:34] reroute you
[1:24:38] don't let the enemy
[1:24:41] reroute you
[1:24:43] oh my goodness
[1:24:46] now you know
[1:24:47] as he experiencing then and particularly
[1:24:50] then
[1:24:52] pastor
[1:24:54] first few of your pastor Pastor one
[1:24:57] all we dealing with people even that
[1:25:00] sometimes they
[1:25:01] one of their uses
[1:25:05] for not receiving
[1:25:07] the word
[1:25:08] come on
[1:25:11] many times he want to blame one another
[1:25:13] and blame others
[1:25:17] because many times are there unbelief
[1:25:19] because of their not really dedicated
[1:25:21] and sealed to the Lord at his shoe that
[1:25:23] once should
[1:25:25] one bling others
[1:25:28] for them not being what he should be in
[1:25:30] the Lord that's right yes sir that's
[1:25:33] right God help us
[1:25:37] and and somehow I don't get
[1:25:40] this came to me that that I shared it
[1:25:44] with the church and I would press
[1:25:47] to share this with you
[1:25:50] maybe that helped some of you and maybe
[1:25:52] sometimes that you uh in church you know
[1:25:55] then sometimes you get distracted that's
[1:25:57] right
[1:25:59] when you come he come too that's right
[1:26:05] and uh
[1:26:06] so that's why we
[1:26:09] have to look we must come ask Lord help
[1:26:12] us to create the atmosphere yes
[1:26:18] that's right
[1:26:20] with him
[1:26:23] yes we come to visit here we come you
[1:26:25] know and look at Fellowship there's a
[1:26:27] time we come to church yes sir you want
[1:26:30] to be you ain't God yeah
[1:26:33] because you want that connection with
[1:26:35] God
[1:26:36] in service
[1:26:38] but you know the inner always pass some
[1:26:40] heart away if you don't be mindful he'll
[1:26:42] try to distract you
[1:26:44] yeah that's right but hearing what God
[1:26:46] has for you that will take the day an
[1:26:48] hour
[1:26:53] Pastor running and it really and then
[1:26:57] was to me was saying something to help
[1:26:59] us
[1:27:01] and this it kind of the story here they
[1:27:04] said that
[1:27:05] you know how assuming they had in this
[1:27:07] church and I guess it was a wide Pastor
[1:27:10] you know and he kind of uh said I'm
[1:27:12] gonna do this I can help some of
[1:27:14] those folks say well past you know uh I
[1:27:16] come to church and you know how many
[1:27:18] times people stay in the back of the
[1:27:20] church
[1:27:21] going on
[1:27:24] and because they're not focus said it
[1:27:26] should
[1:27:27] get distracted looking at other folks
[1:27:30] yes right
[1:27:32] because they would do just that
[1:27:34] right they call you to miss what God
[1:27:36] want to say to you
[1:27:37] as an individual
[1:27:40] so it says here I want to read here what
[1:27:42] that's to say what happened the world
[1:27:44] that he said man I went to the pastor of
[1:27:47] his church
[1:27:48] and said I want
[1:27:51] attending church anymore
[1:27:55] he said may I ask why I said a pastor
[1:27:58] he said that I see people on their cell
[1:28:01] phone
[1:28:02] passing in
[1:28:04] python doing service
[1:28:08] I see some gossiping
[1:28:12] some just aren't living right
[1:28:15] so it just are sleeping
[1:28:18] so much staring at me
[1:28:20] no hear the Chris
[1:28:26] silent
[1:28:28] then he said can I ask you to do
[1:28:30] something for me before you knit your
[1:28:32] final decision
[1:28:35] he said sure what that
[1:28:37] he said take a glass of water
[1:28:40] and walk around the church two times
[1:28:43] yeah and don't let the water fall out of
[1:28:46] the glass
[1:28:48] he said yes I can do that you know
[1:28:51] so he went and got a glass of water and
[1:28:53] walked around the church two times
[1:28:55] he came back and said it had done the
[1:28:58] doctor asked him
[1:29:01] do you see somebody on their phone
[1:29:07] do you see somebody gospeling
[1:29:10] with anybody living wrong
[1:29:13] do you see anybody sleeping
[1:29:16] he said I didn't see anything because I
[1:29:18] was so focused on the glass
[1:29:21] hey come on
[1:29:25] rage
[1:29:31] it's an Open Door preach brother
[1:29:35] he said I didn't see anything I was so
[1:29:37] focused on the glass so the water wasn't
[1:29:39] Spilled Out
[1:29:40] he said he told him
[1:29:42] what to go to church it should be just
[1:29:46] that focus on God
[1:29:52] can you see me
[1:29:55] I believe you know that that that's what
[1:29:58] many times we we don't really focus on
[1:30:02] God
[1:30:04] that's right because it always there
[1:30:07] trying to distract you from the things
[1:30:09] that God has for you
[1:30:12] so I just want to encourage you today
[1:30:15] keep your focus
[1:30:17] on the word amen
[1:30:20] because I tell them to eat then many
[1:30:23] times that's the one that uh some people
[1:30:25] will continue so you know and said
[1:30:29] you know I I see things going on and uh
[1:30:32] so I think I'm just leaving
[1:30:37] that's okay
[1:30:39] so you live for a perfect Church
[1:30:43] I said we just find that perfect Church
[1:30:46] called me
[1:30:50] I'm the John for you John
[1:30:54] because we know they're not penis
[1:30:56] perfect Church within the body of Christ
[1:30:58] well I have thoughts and failure
[1:31:01] but with the love of God in our lives
[1:31:03] that's right
[1:31:17] yes sir
[1:31:19] because our father said how do you say
[1:31:21] God

[1:31:24] right
[1:31:27] can you see you man

[1:33:07] the grace of God and the power of the
[1:33:09] Revelation is out to the message that
[1:33:11] all we know that God given us
[1:33:14] that peace of God

[1:33:20] of understanding to keep your heart in
[1:33:22] Mind through Christ Jesus

[1:47:24] listen because what you telling them
[1:47:25] they can do it their own way yeah but
[1:47:28] you got a holy ghost yeah me
[1:47:31] and hunger
[1:47:33] your Construction
[1:47:38] the seed of God adjourning God in you
[1:47:41] help you to come subject to the word
[1:47:45] well the Paul said in Romans 8 and 11
[1:47:47] The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from
[1:47:49] the dead yeah you say if though
[1:47:52] yeah
[1:47:54] it's also what quickly so guys what word
[1:47:57] quickly read your subject to the word
[1:47:59] that's right
[1:48:00] I ain't got to run you down
[1:48:02] plus they got to fire you around they
[1:48:05] were in you it can you subject to the
[1:48:07] word
[1:48:08] until I tell God thank you oh y'all
[1:48:12] thank you
[1:48:12] [Applause]
[1:48:19] he want us at a lad day spirit
[1:48:22] I'm not tell God thank you thank you
[1:48:24] Jesus that's why
[1:48:29] as a pastor I share these things
[1:48:33] because I heard the father God said
[1:48:35] he said only perfect love
[1:48:39] I'm gonna enter there
[1:48:42] I don't know how you look I said God
[1:48:45] to me they care a lot of weight
[1:48:51] Spirit my God he said a little cure
[1:48:54] things
[1:48:55] and self-love so we didn't mind for
[1:48:58] anything other Spirit of this age
[1:49:02] when you don't
[1:49:06] Satan come to church when you don't
[1:49:09] you know I'm ever getting into that
[1:49:11] church instead of atmosphere then I
[1:49:13] called you know to come with all kind of
[1:49:15] attitudes and I called and see the track
[1:49:17] to think what did God do tomorrow I
[1:49:20] already got to do the next day or what
[1:49:22] they gotta do when I leave church and
[1:49:23] they leave focus on the word
[1:49:26] that's right Satan's going to church
[1:49:31] but that's why
[1:49:33] I shared it faster
[1:49:36] I shared with the church a lot of times
[1:49:39] but then this is
[1:49:42] Christ the initial God revealed that's
[1:49:44] right
[1:49:46] I'll probably say this
[1:49:49] he said love one another amen
[1:49:53] above everything
[1:49:56] love one another
[1:49:58] it's not seen man hey amen thank you
[1:50:01] Jesus he said no matter what that devil
[1:50:03] tried to say he's on the screen then
[1:50:07] now you

[1:50:29] targeted he'll bring in some credit
[1:50:32] Us unbeliever in and set him down and
[1:50:36] call him the fellowship with you under
[1:50:39] the quietness and things

[2:09:59] and talk to you
[2:10:01] they don't have the seed of God in their
[2:10:04] life
[2:10:06] meant to us that man could have seen in
[2:10:09] them
[2:10:11] you got a pretty neat brother
[2:10:14] because some of those things
[2:10:18] in their womb of the Mind
[2:10:21] I caught a lot of damage yeah
[2:10:24] being pregnant without another man
[2:10:26] I thought from Christ you become an
[2:10:28] industrious
[2:10:30] man I'm being nice here
[2:10:32] when you accept another man's word apart
[2:10:34] from Christ
[2:10:38] oh my God
[2:10:40] I know they're strong but it's just the
[2:10:42] message it's just the nurses
[2:10:44] to receive another man we're outside of
[2:10:47] your marriage you commit adultery
[2:10:52] he said on the Antichrist he's taking
[2:10:54] another man's seed
[2:10:56] into the wound your mind
[2:11:01] hello
[2:11:04] yeah now now
[2:11:06] the problem said
[2:11:08] it has to eat this person to the church
[2:11:13] look in the off-screen here
[2:11:15] I just followed the message
[2:11:18] they went as one I have problem with
[2:11:21] some of these actually got two of the
[2:11:23] churches
[2:11:24] we got two or three women's
[2:11:28] oh man I have no one one wife

[2:11:44] here what God said he is he the
[2:11:48] spiritual welcome to the church
[2:11:50] that's right but why you can't have one
[2:11:51] husband you know
[2:11:54] one wife
[2:11:56] so when a man the outside of this church
[2:11:59] and go to another church then to another
[2:12:01] church he can't leave a thousand he got
[2:12:02] he got two or three wives
[2:12:11] living that industry
[2:12:13] oh
[2:12:16] the leader alone
[2:12:18] they're kind of tight there I see right
[2:12:20] now

[2:13:03] that's right
[2:13:06] right you got to take something to stick
[2:13:07] the word
