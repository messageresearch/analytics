[2:53] but every man is tempted when he is
[2:55] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[2:58] then when lust hath conceived it
[3:00] bringeth forth sin and sin when it is
[3:03] finished bringeth forth death
[3:05] now that is a picture of exactly what is
[3:07] happening in the church ages
[3:09] as sin started in nothing but a feeling
[3:12] so the death to the church started with
[3:14] the simple little notice deeds of the
[3:16] nicolaitans from the deeds it went to a
[3:19] doctrine from the doctrine it embraced
[3:21] the power of the state and the
[3:22] introduction of paganism
[3:25] now in this age it goes to its own
[3:26] prophetess teacher and so it travels on
[3:30] until it will find itself in the lake of
[3:32] fire for that is exactly where it is
[3:34] going to end up in the second death
[3:38] now the whole cry of god against this
[3:39] fourth age is found in his denunciation
[3:42] of this prophetess jezebel and to
[3:44] understand exactly why he denounces her
[3:47] so we will have to look up her history
[3:49] in the bible and when we find what she
[3:51] did back there we will know what is
[3:53] going on at this time
[3:55] the first and very important thing that
[3:57] we learn about jezebel is that she is
[4:00] not a daughter of abraham nor is her
[4:02] induction into the tribes of israel one
[4:04] of spiritual admission as was that of
[4:07] ruth the moabitess
[4:08] no sir
[4:10] this woman was the daughter of ethbale
[4:12] king of
[4:14] first kings 1631
[4:16] who was the priest unto astarte
[4:19] he had gained the throne by murdering
[4:21] his predecessor felix
[4:23] so we see right away that she was the
[4:25] daughter of a murderer
[4:26] this certainly reminds us of cain
[4:29] and the way she became a part of israel
[4:31] was not through the spiritual channels
[4:33] that god had ordained for gentile
[4:34] admission
[4:36] but she came in by marriage to ahab the
[4:39] king of the ten tribes of israel now
[4:42] this union as we have seen was not
[4:43] spiritual it was political
[4:46] and so this woman who was steeped in
[4:48] idolatry did not have the least desire
[4:50] to become a worshiper of the one true
[4:52] god
[4:53] but rather she came with the avowed
[4:55] intentions of turning israel away from
[4:57] the lord
[4:58] now israel the ten tribes had already
[5:01] known what it was to worship the golden
[5:03] calves
[5:04] but as yet they were not sold out to
[5:06] idolatry for god was worshipped and the
[5:08] law of moses was acknowledged
[5:11] but from the time of ahab's marriage to
[5:13] jezebel
[5:14] idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion
[5:17] it was when this woman became a
[5:18] priestess in the temples that she
[5:20] erected to astarte
[5:22] venus and baal sun god that israel came
[5:26] to the crisis point of her life
[5:28] with this in mind we can now begin to
[5:31] see what the spirit of god is setting
[5:32] forth in this dietary and age
[5:35] here it is
[5:37] ahab married jezebel and he did it as a
[5:39] political maneuver to strengthen his
[5:41] kingdom and secure it
[5:42] that is exactly what the church did when
[5:44] it married under constantine
[5:46] they both got together for political
[5:48] reasons though they put a spiritual heir
[5:51] to it
[5:52] now no one can convince me that
[5:54] constantine was a christian
[5:56] he was a pagan with what looked like
[5:58] christian trappings he painted white
[6:00] crosses on the soldiers shields he was
[6:02] the originator of the knights of
[6:04] columbus
[6:05] he put a cross on the steeple of saint
[6:07] sophia's thereby starting a tradition
[6:10] it was constantine's idea to get
[6:12] everyone together the pagans nominal
[6:15] christians and true christians
[6:17] and for a while it looked as if he would
[6:18] succeed for the real believers came
[6:20] along to see if they could bring back
[6:22] the ones that had drifted away from the
[6:23] word
[6:25] when they saw that they couldn't bring
[6:26] them back into the truth
[6:28] they were forced to break away from the
[6:30] body political
[6:31] then when they did they were called
[6:33] heretics and persecuted
[6:36] let me say right here that we have the
[6:38] very same thing going on right now
[6:40] the people are all coming together
[6:43] they are writing a bible that will suit
[6:44] everyone whether it be a jew catholic or
[6:47] protestant
[6:48] they have their own nicene council but
[6:50] they call it the ecumenical council
[6:53] and do you know whom all these
[6:54] organizations fight
[6:56] they fight the true pentecostals i don't
[6:58] mean the organization called pentecostal
[7:01] i mean the ones who are pentecostal
[7:03] because they are filled with the holy
[7:04] ghost and have the signs and gifts in
[7:06] their midst because they walk in truth
[7:09] when they have married jezebel for
[7:11] political reasons he sold his birthright
[7:14] you join up with an organization and you
[7:16] sell your birthright brother whether you
[7:18] want to believe it or not
[7:20] every protestant group that ever came
[7:22] out and then went back sold their
[7:23] birthright
[7:25] and when you sell your birthright you're
[7:26] just like esau
[7:28] you can cry and repent all you want but
[7:31] it won't do you any good
[7:33] there is only one thing you can do and
[7:35] that is
[7:36] come out of her my people and stop
[7:37] partaking of her sins
[7:40] now if you don't think i am right just
[7:41] answer this one question can any man
[7:44] living tell me what church or what move
[7:46] of god ever had revival and came back
[7:49] after she went into organization and
[7:51] became a denomination
[7:53] read your histories
[7:54] you can't find one
[7:56] not even one
[7:59] it was the midnight hour for israel when
[8:01] she joined with the world and left the
[8:03] spiritual for the political
[8:05] it was the midnight hour at nicea when
[8:07] the church did the same thing
[8:09] it is the midnight hour now that the
[8:11] churches are coming together
[8:14] now when they have married jezebel he
[8:15] allowed her to take the state money and
[8:17] erect two huge houses of worship of
[8:19] astarte and baal
[8:21] the one that was erected for baal was
[8:23] big enough for all israel to come and
[8:25] worship there at
[8:26] and when constantine and the church
[8:28] married he gave the church buildings and
[8:31] set up altars and images and organized
[8:33] the hierarchy that had already been
[8:35] shaping up
[8:37] when jezebel got the power of the state
[8:39] behind her she forced her religion on
[8:41] the people and killed the prophets and
[8:43] priests of god
[8:45] it got so bad that elijah the messenger
[8:47] to his day
[8:48] thought he was the only one left
[8:50] but god had seven thousand more that
[8:52] hadn't bowed the knee to bale
[8:55] and right now out there amongst those
[8:57] denominations of baptists methodists
[8:59] presbyterians etc
[9:01] there are some that will come out and
[9:03] come back to god
[9:05] i want you to know i am not now and
[9:07] never have been against the people it is
[9:10] the denomination
[9:11] the system of organization that i am
[9:13] against
[9:14] i have to be against it for god hates it
[9:18] now just let us stop a minute here and
[9:20] rehearse what we brought out about the
[9:22] worship in thyatira
[9:24] i said that they worshipped apollo who
[9:26] was the sun god along with the emperor
[9:29] now this apollo was called the averter
[9:31] of evil he turned evil away from people
[9:34] he blessed them and was a real god to
[9:36] them
[9:37] he was supposed to teach the people he
[9:40] explained about worship and temple
[9:42] rights services to gods about sacrifices
[9:45] and death and life after death
[9:47] the way he did this was through a
[9:49] prophetess who sat entranced upon a
[9:51] tripod chair
[9:52] my
[9:53] do you see it
[9:54] here is that prophetess called jezebel
[9:56] and she is teaching the people
[9:58] and her teaching is seducing the
[10:00] servants of god and causing them to
[10:02] commit fornication now fornication means
[10:05] idol worship
[10:06] that is what its spiritual meaning is
[10:09] it is an illegal union ahab's union and
[10:12] constantine's union were both illegal
[10:14] both committed spiritual fornication
[10:17] every fornicator will wind up in the
[10:19] lake of fire god said so
[10:23] now then the teaching of the catholic
[10:24] church the church is female it is a
[10:27] woman denies the word of god
[10:29] the pope who is literally apollo in a
[10:31] modern version has taught the people to
[10:33] join themselves to idols
[10:35] the roman church has now become a false
[10:37] prophetess to the people because she has
[10:40] taken away the word of the lord from the
[10:42] people and given her own ideas as to
[10:44] what constitutes forgiveness of sins
[10:47] what brings the blessings of god
[10:49] and the priests have gone so far as to
[10:51] stay categorically but they have power
[10:54] not only in life but in death
[10:56] they teach on their own that there is a
[10:58] purgatory but you can't find that in the
[11:00] word
[11:01] they teach that prayers and masses and
[11:04] money will get you out of purgatory and
[11:05] into heaven
[11:07] the whole system that is based upon its
[11:09] teaching is false
[11:11] it does not lie on the sure foundation
[11:13] of the revelation of god in his word but
[11:15] lies on the shifting sinking sands of
[11:18] its own diabolical untruths
[11:21] the church went right from organization
[11:23] to denomination and hence to false
[11:25] teaching
[11:26] that is right the roman catholics don't
[11:29] believe that god is in his word
[11:32] no sir
[11:33] if they did they would have to repent
[11:35] and back up but they say god is in his
[11:37] church
[11:39] that would make the bible the history of
[11:40] the catholic church
[11:42] that isn't so
[11:44] look what they did to water baptism
[11:46] alone
[11:47] they took it away from being christian
[11:48] baptism and made it a pagan one of
[11:50] titles
[11:51] let me tell you about an experience i
[11:53] had with a catholic priest a girl that i
[11:56] had baptized at one time turned catholic
[11:59] so the priest wanted to interview me
[12:01] about her
[12:02] he asked what kind of baptism she had
[12:05] i told him i baptized her in christian
[12:07] baptism which is the only kind there was
[12:09] to my knowledge
[12:10] i had buried her in water in the name of
[12:12] the lord jesus christ
[12:14] the priest remarked to me that at one
[12:16] time the catholic church did that
[12:19] right away i asked him when the catholic
[12:21] church did that
[12:22] for i have read their histories and i
[12:24] could not find what he said
[12:26] he told me that it was found in the
[12:28] bible and that jesus had organized the
[12:30] catholic church
[12:32] i asked him if he thought peter was
[12:34] really the first pope
[12:35] he emphatically said that peter was i
[12:38] asked him if the masses were set in
[12:40] latin in order to ensure that they were
[12:41] correct and would never change
[12:44] he said that was true
[12:46] i told him that i thought they had
[12:47] wandered a long way from what they had
[12:49] in the beginning
[12:50] i let him know that if the catholic
[12:52] church really believed the book of acts
[12:54] then i was an old-fashioned catholic
[12:57] he told me that the bible was the record
[12:59] of the catholic church and that god was
[13:01] in the church
[13:02] i disagreed with him for god is in his
[13:05] word
[13:06] let god be true but every man a liar
[13:09] if you take away or add to that book god
[13:12] has promised that he will add plagues to
[13:14] those who add and take away their part
[13:16] from the book of life if they dare to
[13:18] subtract from it revelation 22
[13:21] 18-19
[13:23] let me just show how the roman catholic
[13:25] church believes that god is in the
[13:27] church instead of the word
[13:29] here is an excerpt from the diary of
[13:30] pope john the 23rd
[13:33] my experience during these three years
[13:35] as pope since in fear and trembling i
[13:37] accepted this service in pure obedience
[13:39] to the lord's will conveyed to me
[13:42] through the sacred college of cardinals
[13:43] in conclave
[13:45] bears witness to this maxim and is a
[13:47] moving and lasting reason for me to be
[13:49] true to it
[13:51] absolute trust in god in all that
[13:53] concerns the present and perfect
[13:54] tranquility as regards the future
[13:57] this pope states that god spoke through
[13:59] the church revealing his will how false
[14:03] god is in his word and speaks by the
[14:05] word revealing his will
[14:07] he also stated that he placed absolute
[14:09] trust in the word of men and thereby
[14:11] obeyed it with tranquility
[14:13] it sounds so beautiful but it is so
[14:15] false
[14:16] just like the perversion in the garden
[14:18] of eden
[14:20] now let us get over here in revelation
[14:22] 17 and see this woman the church who is
[14:25] living on false prophecies and not the
[14:26] word of god
[14:28] in verse 1 god calls her the great
[14:31] why is she a
[14:33] because she is in idolatry
[14:35] she has caught the people up into the
[14:36] same thing
[14:38] what's the cure for idolatry
[14:40] the word of god
[14:42] so this woman is a because she has
[14:43] left the word
[14:45] there she is sitting upon many waters
[14:47] which means multitudes of people
[14:50] this surely has to be the false church
[14:52] because the church of god is small few
[14:54] there be that find it
[14:57] notice what she is like in the eyes of
[14:59] god no matter how wonderful she looks to
[15:01] people and how philosophical she sounds
[15:03] she is filthy drunk on her fornications
[15:07] now she was drunk with the blood of the
[15:08] martyrs
[15:09] just like jezebel who killed the
[15:11] prophets and priests and destroyed the
[15:13] people of god who would not bow down and
[15:15] worship baal
[15:16] and that is exactly what the catholic
[15:18] church did they killed those that would
[15:20] not bow down to the popish rule
[15:23] those who wanted the word of god instead
[15:25] of the words of men were put to death
[15:27] usually by cruel methods
[15:29] but this church that dealt in death was
[15:31] dead herself and didn't know it there
[15:34] was no life in her and no signs ever
[15:36] followed her
[15:38] space to repent
[15:40] revelation 2 21
[15:43] and i gave her space to repent of her
[15:45] fornications and she repented not
[15:49] do you know that this church was
[15:50] actually more wicked than ahab
[15:52] do you know that he repented for a while
[15:54] and walked softly before god
[15:57] you can't say that of the roman catholic
[15:59] church no sir
[16:00] she has never repented but has
[16:02] stubbornly destroyed any and all who
[16:04] tried to help her repent
[16:06] that is history now god kept raising up
[16:09] not only the messengers to each age but
[16:11] he raised up some wonderful helpers for
[16:13] those messengers
[16:15] he gave every age some wonderful men of
[16:17] god and they did everything they could
[16:19] to bring the church back to god
[16:22] certainly gave her opportunity and
[16:23] helped to repent
[16:25] did she ever repent and show she did by
[16:27] her fruits
[16:28] no sir
[16:29] she never has and she never will
[16:32] she is drunk
[16:33] she has lost her senses in spiritual
[16:35] things
[16:37] now don't be confused and start thinking
[16:39] that the church of rome has repented of
[16:41] her slaughter of the saints because she
[16:43] is attempting to unite with the
[16:44] protestants by making her creeds to line
[16:46] up with protestant creeds
[16:49] not once has she ever apologized and
[16:51] said she was wrong for her mass murders
[16:53] and she won't either
[16:55] and no matter how mellow and sweet she
[16:57] appears at this particular time
[16:59] she will yet rise up to kill for murder
[17:01] lies in her evil and unrepentant heart
[17:06] sentence against the harlot past
[17:09] revelation 2 22-23
[17:13] behold i will cast her into a bed and
[17:15] them that commit adultery with her into
[17:17] great tribulation
[17:18] except they repent of their deeds
[17:20] and i will kill her children with death
[17:23] and all the churches shall know that i
[17:25] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[17:27] hearts and i will give unto every one of
[17:29] you according to your works
[17:31] what
[17:32] this woman has children
[17:34] and she a
[17:36] if that is the case that she had
[17:38] children by her whoredoms then she must
[17:39] be burnt with fire as the word has said
[17:42] that is exactly true
[17:44] that is her end for she will burn with
[17:46] fire
[17:48] her end is the lake of fire
[17:50] but stop and think about these children
[17:52] for a moment
[17:53] a woman is the one out of whom the
[17:55] children come
[17:56] it is evident that this woman had
[17:58] children that came out of her but they
[18:00] did the same thing she did
[18:02] show me one church that ever came out of
[18:04] organization that didn't go right back
[18:06] into it there isn't one not one
[18:09] the lutherans came out and then
[18:11] organized right back and today they are
[18:13] hand in glove with this ecumenical move
[18:16] the methodists came out and they
[18:18] organized right back
[18:19] the pentecostals came out and they
[18:21] organized right back
[18:23] there is going to be another coming out
[18:24] and praise god they won't organize back
[18:26] because they know the truth
[18:28] that group will be the bride of the last
[18:30] day
[18:32] now it said here that this had
[18:34] children
[18:35] now what were they
[18:37] they were daughters for they were
[18:39] churches just like her
[18:41] now here is a very interesting point
[18:43] jezebel and ahab had a daughter
[18:46] that daughter married jehoram the son of
[18:48] jehoshaphat and in second kings 8 16 it
[18:51] says that
[18:52] johoram walked in the ways of his
[18:54] father-in-law
[18:56] he went right into idolatry by this
[18:58] marriage
[18:58] he brought god fearing and god
[19:00] worshiping judah into idolatry
[19:02] that is exactly what all these daughter
[19:04] churches have done even as i have
[19:06] pointed out to you
[19:08] they start in the truth and marry into
[19:10] organization and leave the word for
[19:12] tradition creeds etc
[19:14] now let me get this across
[19:17] in hebrews 13 7 it says
[19:20] obey them which have rule over you who
[19:22] have spoken to you the word of god
[19:25] it is the word that rules us not men
[19:28] now a man as a husband is head of the
[19:30] woman he rules her
[19:32] but the church is a woman too
[19:34] and her ruler is the word jesus is the
[19:37] word if she rejects the word and takes
[19:40] any other headship she is an adulteress
[19:43] now you name me one church that hasn't
[19:44] given up the word for traditions and
[19:46] creeds they are all adulterouses
[19:49] like mother like daughter
[19:52] what will be the punishment of the
[19:53] harlot and her children
[19:55] well it is going to be twofold
[19:58] first he said
[19:59] i will cast her into a bed
[20:02] according to the last part of verse 22
[20:04] it will be a bed of tribulation or the
[20:06] great tribulation
[20:07] that is exactly what jesus said in
[20:09] matthew 25 1-13
[20:13] there were ten virgins
[20:14] five were wise and five were foolish the
[20:17] five wise had oil the holy spirit but
[20:21] the other five did not
[20:23] when the cry went up
[20:24] behold the bridegroom cometh the five
[20:27] foolish had to run seeking oil while the
[20:29] five wise virgins went into the marriage
[20:32] the five that remained outside were left
[20:34] to the great tribulation
[20:36] that is what will happen to all who do
[20:38] not go up in the rapture
[20:40] that is what will come upon the harlot
[20:42] and her daughters
[20:43] secondly it says that he will kill them
[20:45] with death or as a literal translation
[20:47] says
[20:48] let them be put to death with death
[20:51] this is a strange saying
[20:53] we might say
[20:54] let a man be put to death by hanging or
[20:56] by electrocution or some other way
[20:59] but this says
[21:00] let them be put to death by death
[21:03] death itself is the cause of their death
[21:07] now i want you to see this clearly so i
[21:08] will take our illustration again of the
[21:10] daughter of jezebel marrying into the
[21:12] house of judah and thereby bringing it
[21:15] right into idolatry and causing god to
[21:17] deliver judah to death
[21:19] that is what balaam did too
[21:22] so here was jezebel with her paganism
[21:24] over there is judah properly worshiping
[21:27] god and living under the word
[21:29] so jezebel marries her daughter to
[21:30] jehoram the minute that happens jehoram
[21:33] causes the people to become idolaters
[21:36] the minute that marriage took place
[21:37] judah was dead
[21:39] spiritual death came in
[21:41] the minute the first church of rome
[21:43] organized it died
[21:45] the minute that the lutherans organized
[21:47] death came in and they died
[21:49] the pentecostals came along last and
[21:51] they organized the spirit left though
[21:54] they don't believe it but he did
[21:56] that marriage brought death
[21:59] then the light of oneness of the godhead
[22:01] came
[22:02] they organized and they died too
[22:04] then after the fire of god fell on the
[22:06] ohio river in 1933
[22:09] a healing revival swept the world but it
[22:11] never came through any organization
[22:14] god went outside the pentecostal groups
[22:16] outside of organization
[22:18] and what he is going to do in the future
[22:20] is going to be outside organization too
[22:23] god can't work through the dead
[22:25] he can only work through the living
[22:26] members
[22:27] those living members are outside of
[22:29] babylon
[22:31] so you see death or organization came
[22:35] and the church died or to make it
[22:36] plainer death became a resident wherein
[22:39] shortly before only life reigned
[22:42] as the original eve brought death to
[22:44] mankind so now organization has brought
[22:47] death for organization is the product of
[22:49] the double corrupters nicolaitanism and
[22:52] balaamism propagated by the prophetess
[22:54] jezebel
[22:56] now eve should have been burned along
[22:58] with the serpent for their awful deed
[23:00] but adam intervened taking her quickly
[23:02] to himself so that she was saved
[23:05] but when this satanic religion has gone
[23:07] the full course of the ages
[23:09] there will be no one to intervene
[23:11] and she will be burned with her seducer
[23:13] for the and her children and the
[23:15] antichrist and satan will all find their
[23:17] places in the lake of fire
[23:20] right here i will be getting ahead of
[23:22] myself and maybe i ought to reserve this
[23:24] for the message on the last age
[23:26] but it seems just right to put it in now
[23:28] because it deals so clearly with
[23:30] organization and what is going to happen
[23:32] through it
[23:33] and i want to warn you
[23:35] revelation 13 1-18
[23:38] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[23:41] and saw a beast
[23:45] rise up out of the sea having seven
[23:47] heads and ten horns and upon his horns
[23:50] ten crowns and upon his heads the name
[23:53] of blasphemy
[23:55] and the beast which i saw was like unto
[23:57] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[23:59] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth
[24:15] the lion
[24:16] and the dragon gave him his power and
[24:18] his seat and great authority
[24:21] and i saw one of his heads as it were
[24:22] wounded to death
[24:24] and his deadly wound was healed
[24:26] and all the world wandered after the
[24:28] beast
[24:29] and they worshipped the dragon which
[24:31] gave power unto the beast and they
[24:33] worshiped the beast saying who is like
[24:35] unto the beast who is able to make war
[24:37] with him
[24:39] and there was given unto him a mouth
[24:40] speaking great things and blasphemies
[24:43] and power was given unto him to continue
[24:45] forty and two months
[24:47] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[24:49] against god to blaspheme his name and
[24:51] his tabernacle and them that dwell in
[24:53] heaven
[24:54] and it was given unto him to make war
[24:56] with the saints and to overcome them
[24:58] and power was given him over all
[25:00] kindreds and tongues and nations
[25:03] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[25:05] worship him whose names are not written
[25:08] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[25:10] from the foundation of the world
[25:12] if any man have an ear let him hear
[25:15] he that bleedeth into captivity shall go
[25:17] into captivity he that killeth with the
[25:19] sword must be killed with the sword
[25:22] here is the patience and the faith of
[25:24] the saints
[25:25] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[25:27] of the earth and he had two horns like a
[25:30] lamb and he spake as a dragon
[25:32] and he exerciseth all the power of the
[25:34] first beast before him and causeth the
[25:37] earth and them which dwelt therein to
[25:38] worship the first beast whose deadly
[25:41] wound was healed
[25:42] and he doeth great wonders so that he
[25:45] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[25:47] earth in the sight of men
[25:49] and he deceiveth them that dwell on the
[25:51] earth by the means of those miracles
[25:53] which he had power to do in the sight of
[25:54] the beast saying to them that dwell on
[25:57] the earth that they should make an image
[25:59] to the beast which had the wound by a
[26:01] sword and did live
[26:03] and he had power to give life under the
[26:05] image of the beast that the image of the
[26:08] beast should both speak and cause that
[26:10] as many as would not worship the image
[26:12] of the beast should be killed
[26:14] and he causeth all
[26:16] both small and great rich and poor free
[26:18] and bond to receive a mark in their
[26:21] right hand or in their foreheads
[26:24] and that no man might buy or sell save
[26:27] he that had the mark or the name of the
[26:29] beast or the number of his name
[26:31] here is wisdom
[26:33] let him that hath understanding count
[26:35] the number of the beast
[26:37] for it is the number of a man
[26:39] and his number is six hundred threescore
[26:42] and six
[26:45] [Music]
[27:39] so
[27:45] [Music]
[28:50] [Music]
[30:29] so
[30:34] [Music]
[31:19] you
