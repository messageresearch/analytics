[12:17] in the back
[12:18] and sent them
[12:20] for lab
[12:23] the result should be the result

[12:28] in about two weeks
[12:31] as i usually say
[12:34] if my child come to me for a problem i
[12:38] don't tell them it's your problem
[12:42] my child
[12:43] not mine i don't tell them it's your
[12:45] problem not mine my child's problem
[12:49] effectively is my problem
[12:53] so i do the same with the heavenly
[12:56] father i go to him and say heavenly
[12:58] father
[12:59] you have a problem
[13:01] because your child is sick
[13:04] i would like to leave
[13:07] you with these
[13:09] few words
[13:12] the announcement of this cancer
[13:15] has been a blessing
[13:18] for it has allowed me to get even closer
[13:21] to god
[13:23] [Music]
[13:25] he put a quote down here from brother
[13:27] branham 1960 the message i know
[13:31] and now why do god let trouble come
[13:36] god highness trouble
[13:38] put the bait in his mouth
[13:41] and make it obey him
[13:43] and those troubles bring us in a closer
[13:46] fellowship with god
[13:49] we ask for comfort and peace god gave us
[13:52] the best
[13:54] he who gave us trials and tribulation
[13:58] that's better than comfort and peace
[14:01] our comfort
[14:03] is just beyond the river
[14:06] in those crucial hours
[14:09] that press that pressed us
[14:12] on those
[14:14] sacristy
[14:16] is those crucial hours that press us
[14:20] on those sacrifices
[14:22] praise the lord
[14:23] so we will continue to remember our dear
[14:26] brother
[14:29] but i pathetic that the lord will be
[14:32] able to touch him
[14:33] there are few uh
[14:36] prayer requests here also

[42:00] when
[42:09] he said to him
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] all your children
[42:28] he lost everything he ever had
[42:33] [Music]
[42:55] when i try so
[43:01] [Music]
[43:10] let's try the last verse now
[43:13] when my life down here
[43:17] on this earth
[43:24] [Music]
[43:39] foreign
[43:41] [Music]
[44:06] yeah
[44:06] when i try so hard
[44:11] and i dance
[44:16] [Music]
[44:35] last time i was up here y'all you know
[44:37] gave a little offering and
[44:39] i took it back and i gave it to the
[44:41] church down at home because it's a small
[44:42] church and it really needed the funds
[44:44] and
[44:44] the brother pastor tim calhoun really
[44:47] appreciated it and
[44:48] he just wanted to express his thanks and
[44:51] gratefulness for that it really came in
[44:53] handy for the local church there
[44:55] and uh
[44:59] hey man
[45:00] it's a little different sometimes i have
[45:02] to get used to it
[45:05] so let's just bow our hands
[45:07] dear lord jesus we thank you for
[45:10] your many blessings upon your people
[45:12] father and on our lives lord we just
[45:15] ask that you would have your preeminence
[45:17] in your way and your will and the
[45:18] service tonight lord and
[45:20] just help us to be in your perfect will
[45:22] lord in everything we do father
[45:25] and when we're not in your perfect will
[45:26] lord we just pray that your holy spirit
[45:28] would just nudge us father so that we
[45:29] could
[45:30] just humble ourselves down lord and just
[45:32] follow back into your footsteps lord for
[45:35] the mistakes along the way they their
[45:38] insignificance in the grand thing
[45:40] grand scheme of things lord whenever
[45:42] we are here to fill your purpose lord
[45:44] and to reach that goal which you have
[45:46] set before us so father
[45:48] we just pray lord that you just lead and
[45:50] guide us as we go this journey father
[45:52] for we ask it in the name of the lord
[45:53] jesus christ amen
[45:56] amen
[45:58] i was uh
[46:00] you know
[46:03] i don't really know how to start
[46:04] sometimes you get nervous but anyway
[46:06] we're all on a journey
[46:08] and uh
[46:09] recently in in my family look we had um
[46:12] our son get baptized our second one
[46:15] the first one was baptized for a few
[46:17] years now
[46:18] but
[46:19] as a father to my children
[46:23] i would i was going to express to them
[46:25] that
[46:27] what else to expect beyond that point
[46:30] and since they're not here tonight i
[46:32] can't really speak to them personally
[46:33] but they have promised to to watch the
[46:36] service tonight so hopefully that
[46:37] they'll pay attention
[46:39] and maybe it'll be a stepping stone
[46:41] along the way and maybe since they're
[46:43] not here and we're all on this journey
[46:45] together no matter you know we might be
[46:47] at one place another one might be in
[46:49] another place but we're all on the
[46:50] journey so maybe this message will help
[46:52] you all too i have been listening to a
[46:54] history professor and he said that uh
[46:58] when you're delivering a message before
[47:00] the people there's three things one is
[47:01] the content
[47:03] and we know the contents where is right
[47:05] because it's coming from the message of
[47:06] the hour and it's coming from the
[47:08] scripture and then another one is who
[47:11] you're delivering it to
[47:13] and then the third one
[47:15] is
[47:16] the delivery itself or the person giving
[47:17] the delivery and sometimes i know that
[47:20] that's my strongest weaknesses the
[47:22] person doing the delivery so hopefully
[47:24] you can look over my thoughts and
[47:26] failures and pay attention to the
[47:28] content because the content is really
[47:30] the most important thing
[47:32] so
[47:33] i'm going to start out
[47:35] with a quote from leadership
[47:39] in
[47:39] 1965 1207
[47:42] and sometimes when we're not
[47:44] really where we need to be we'll think
[47:46] something's wrong when it's not
[47:48] and this is uh
[47:50] you know
[47:51] whenever i listen to somebody and they
[47:53] tell me that the message is wrong or the
[47:56] bible's wrong in a certain spot
[47:59] i can't help but
[48:00] change their words for them
[48:02] and and the way i hear them say that
[48:05] well i don't understand what this what
[48:07] this person here is saying yeah
[48:09] because whenever you tell me the word
[48:11] itself is wrong that's a manifestation
[48:13] of unbelief and that's not a good thing
[48:16] so
[48:17] let's read this quote
[48:19] as an overview and i'm not going to give
[48:21] the answer right off maybe we'll come
[48:22] back later to it
[48:24] 1965 leadership
[48:26] in california
[48:27] the choice of your conduct
[48:30] you can't mix it now this is your
[48:31] conduct you can't mix you're either for
[48:34] god or against god and the outward
[48:36] expression shows exactly what's on the
[48:38] inside the outside shows what's on the
[48:40] inside see the cockleberry the cocoa
[48:42] bird you're outside nature
[48:44] many of you think i got the baptism of
[48:47] the holy ghost i'm going to heaven
[48:48] that's a good thing there to have the
[48:50] baptism of the holy ghost
[48:52] that don't mean one thing you're going
[48:53] to heaven no sir you can have the
[48:55] baptism of the holy ghost every hour of
[48:58] your life and still be lost and go to
[49:00] hell the bible says so
[49:02] uh-huh that's exactly right
[49:06] let's just uh
[49:07] read
[49:09] exodus 30 as a
[49:12] as a background here
[49:15] what i was going to do is i was going to
[49:16] preach tonight on the three stages of of
[49:19] grace
[49:20] you know justification sanctification
[49:22] and baptism of the holy ghost but i'm
[49:24] not really going to get into the details
[49:26] of the holy ghost because everybody's
[49:27] got their own opinion of what they think
[49:29] the holy ghost is what i was just going
[49:31] to show from the message because we know
[49:33] from the beginning all the way to the
[49:34] end
[49:35] that brother branham thought this
[49:37] concept sure he might have used
[49:38] different terminology in one place in
[49:40] another place but you can see all the
[49:42] way through the word
[49:43] that this concept is true
[49:48] and
[49:49] right now exodus 30 is just going over
[49:52] the
[49:52] the temple in the wilderness
[49:55] and it's telling you certain points
[49:57] always throughout it and i'm going to
[49:59] use that as an example of these three
[50:01] stages i hope not to keep you standing
[50:03] too long
[50:05] chapter one you notices and thou shalt
[50:07] make the altar
[50:09] to burn incense upon it
[50:11] and to shoot them would show you all
[50:13] make of it that's basically your prayer
[50:15] life so that's that's very important
[50:18] then we'll read uh
[50:20] verses 6 to
[50:22] 8 and i'll let you sit down
[50:25] and thou shalt put it before the veil
[50:27] that is by the ark of the testimony
[50:29] before the mercy seat is over the
[50:31] testimony i will meet with thee
[50:35] and aaron shall burn their own sweet
[50:37] incense every morning when he dresses
[50:39] the lamps and he shall burn the incense
[50:41] upon it and aaron lighteth the lamps at
[50:44] even
[50:45] he shall burn incense upon it a
[50:47] perpetual incense before the lord
[50:49] throughout your generations you may be
[50:51] seated
[50:52] and you notice here
[50:54] i know it says in the uh beginning
[50:57] uh in another chapter it talks about the
[50:59] the lamp stands which is the type of the
[51:01] church ages and and and before this
[51:04] point also it talks about the show
[51:05] breath which is the type of christ being
[51:08] uh
[51:09] the intercessor for through the church
[51:11] ages for us
[51:13] and now it talks about the
[51:15] uh the altar to burn incense upon it it
[51:17] talks about our prayer life that's one
[51:20] of the important things for a christian
[51:21] lock is to in a christian life is to
[51:24] have a good prayer life to pray all the
[51:26] time
[51:26] here it says
[51:28] in verse 8
[51:29] well let me find it again
[51:32] verse 7 and aaron shall burn their own
[51:34] sweet incense every morning when he
[51:36] dresses the lamp he shall burn incense
[51:38] upon it
[51:39] and aaron lighteth the lamps at even he
[51:41] shall burn incense upon a perpetual
[51:43] incense before the lord throughout all
[51:45] your generations so it's perpetual in
[51:48] another place the in the the the prophet
[51:50] says prayer without seasons
[51:52] so it's very important to have a prayer
[51:54] life in this walk with christ
[51:57] and
[51:59] if you could put that picture up
[52:01] brother jordan
[52:02] uh
[52:04] you know you can see the the places of
[52:06] where where that is
[52:08] and exodus uh
[52:10] 32 verse 18
[52:12] thou shalt you notice we're starting
[52:15] from the inside of the holy of holies
[52:17] which is this right here
[52:21] um
[52:22] you have to forgive me
[52:24] before verse six it says before the ark
[52:26] of the testimony before the merciful is
[52:28] over the testimony i will meet thee so
[52:31] you notice he said he will meet you in
[52:32] the holy place which is inside of here
[52:35] and then the incense is right outside of
[52:37] that
[52:38] and then the then he talks about the
[52:40] lamps
[52:41] lighting the lamps that's inside the
[52:43] holy place not the holy of holies
[52:45] because the holy holy of holies is
[52:47] is inside the inside there
[52:51] so we're going from the
[52:53] extreme holy place and we're working our
[52:55] way outwards
[52:57] and then
[52:59] verse 17 that shall make thee a labor of
[53:02] brass and his foot shall also be a brass
[53:04] to wash with all and thou shall put it
[53:07] between the tabernacle of the
[53:08] congregation of the altar and thou shalt
[53:10] put water therein and aaron and his son
[53:13] shall wash their hands and their feet
[53:15] they're out so now we're out into the
[53:17] court this is out here this is the the
[53:20] water right there for it
[53:23] so we're going from the inside to the
[53:25] outside
[53:28] when they go into the tabernacle of the
[53:30] congregation they shall wash with water
[53:32] that they die not so it's very important
[53:34] that they get washed so if you're coming
[53:36] in and these are you know the levites is
[53:38] the type of the ministry so if you're a
[53:40] minister you're supposed to be washed or
[53:42] sanctified right
[53:45] that you die not so it's very important
[53:47] and when they come near the altar to
[53:49] minister to burn offering made by fire
[53:51] into the lord so they wash their hands
[53:52] and their feet that they die not that it
[53:54] may be a statute forever even to him and
[53:57] is see throughout their generations
[54:00] then we can skip down to verse 30
[54:03] because in between there it talks about
[54:05] the anointing oil
[54:06] and verse 30 30 is talking about aaron
[54:09] which he's the high priest and thou
[54:11] shalt this is when he says thou that's
[54:13] moses that's the prophet to the age the
[54:15] prophet to the age is is anointing aaron
[54:19] with this anointing
[54:21] in his sons and consecrate them that
[54:23] they minister unto me in the priest's
[54:26] office so
[54:28] aaron is ministering to the lord he's
[54:30] not ministering to the prophet to the
[54:32] age but it took the prophet to the age
[54:34] to come tell the the people in this age
[54:37] how to be anointed and what word to
[54:40] follow and he did the anointing of the
[54:43] ministry but the ministry is supposed to
[54:45] minister to the lord
[54:47] we are not supposed to worship the
[54:49] prophet even though he was the one
[54:51] that brought us the word to correct us
[54:54] and whenever we went astray in this lady
[54:56] i see in the age
[54:59] and then verse 33 because we have the
[55:01] pro and the con
[55:03] not to dwell on the con but we do have
[55:04] them
[55:05] in verse 33 it says whosoever
[55:08] compoundeth any like the anointing oil
[55:10] or whosoever put any of it upon a
[55:13] stranger
[55:14] even him shall be cut off from the
[55:16] people
[55:17] so right here we have the false vine and
[55:18] the true vine
[55:20] and then the anointing was at the end
[55:22] time the prophet told us it wasn't the
[55:24] anointing on those vessels that was
[55:26] false it was the false vessels
[55:29] and they could teach you the false word
[55:30] but they had the genuine anointing on
[55:32] them
[55:39] i heard a brother juan say a long time
[55:41] ago
[55:42] you know every once while listening
[55:44] listening any services
[55:46] for like a month or two other than my
[55:48] home service but he said this maybe a
[55:50] few months ago he said that some of the
[55:52] phrases or catchphrases you hear around
[55:55] it's not exactly according to the word
[55:57] and one of them is is the parent is the
[55:59] child's holy ghost
[56:00] and that's not right and we know and
[56:03] what he said was exactly true
[56:06] and
[56:07] brother branham was talking he said the
[56:09] young men and women for tomorrow if
[56:12] there is a tomorrow we must train them
[56:15] lord we feel we feel that burden to
[56:18] train them like there will be a tomorrow
[56:20] and there's another common sound which
[56:22] it sounds good and it tickles the year
[56:24] and stuff but it's not right and and
[56:26] that is
[56:27] the children today is the church of the
[56:30] day
[56:30] brother branham didn't say the children
[56:32] today is the church of the day
[56:34] he said they are the church of tomorrow
[56:37] and
[56:38] and all depends on the terminology if
[56:40] you're talk which kind of church you're
[56:41] talking about are you talking about the
[56:42] true church of the living god
[56:44] or are you talking about a nominal
[56:46] church which is nothing more than a
[56:47] social club
[56:48] if you're talking about a nominal church
[56:51] which is nothing more than a social club
[56:52] then yes the child today is the church
[56:55] of the day because everybody is in the
[56:58] social club they don't have the holy
[56:59] ghost that's right but if you are the
[57:01] true church of the living god
[57:04] the only way to get in that true church
[57:06] is by the spiritual birth
[57:09] so potentially they are the church
[57:12] for tomorrow but until they receive that
[57:15] seal themselves they are not part of
[57:17] that true church
[57:18] it is a good thing that they are walking
[57:20] toward that and they're on their right
[57:22] path to become that but until they go
[57:25] behind the correct veil
[57:27] then they are are a part of the
[57:29] laodicean system yeah that's right
[57:34] and uh
[57:37] with this right here from the true sign
[57:39] that's overlooked
[57:40] brother and said this not only do i pray
[57:43] for these who are present but for those
[57:44] who will hear the tape around the world
[57:46] that they may be brought into the church
[57:49] of the living god for we realize there's
[57:51] only one way that we can become a member
[57:54] of this church and that is by the birth
[57:56] of the spirit
[57:57] then we are baptized by one spirit into
[58:01] one body
[58:04] so whenever you're just starting out
[58:07] let's say this guy right here he's
[58:09] starting out
[58:10] and then you got we know we got
[58:12] justification and sanctification and
[58:15] then you got the holy ghost and then you
[58:16] got the holy ghost himself in here
[58:19] but whenever you come out here
[58:21] and you're just starting out
[58:23] and you hear ministers and they all
[58:26] correctly say this is the most important
[58:28] part and they always talk about this
[58:30] bell right here
[58:31] they talk about going behind that veil
[58:33] and that is very important for anyone
[58:36] to be behind that veil right there
[58:39] but the problem we got today is people
[58:41] come up to this veil
[58:44] and then they stop there
[58:46] and they have and you can hear them say
[58:48] we need the word we need the word the
[58:50] word is in here
[58:51] but you notice in the tabernacle in the
[58:54] wilderness the manna fell which is the
[58:56] type of the holy spirit bro grant said
[58:58] that one place he also said it's the
[58:59] type of jesus christ which is the word
[59:01] the word made flesh it's the type of the
[59:03] word but that manna fell out here it
[59:06] fell out here in the congregation
[59:09] there's the courtyard there's the holy
[59:11] place and there's the holy of holies
[59:13] they got the manna they got word
[59:16] but they're still hadn't broke through
[59:18] this veil
[59:19] this bell right here
[59:21] is not
[59:22] even justification
[59:24] you have to go through this bell to
[59:26] receive justification
[59:29] and you got word you got true word this
[59:31] word came down from heaven amen it's the
[59:33] true word of god but you're still
[59:36] blocked by this veil until you walk
[59:38] through it
[59:39] you walk through this veil you can get
[59:40] baptized that's just you can get
[59:43] justification then you come over here
[59:45] and that's the blood covering your sins
[59:48] atonement for your sins and you went
[59:50] through one veil that's great you went
[59:52] through a veil
[59:53] but there's another veil right here
[59:55] that's two veils this veil here
[59:58] you can come in you got the word out
[1:00:00] here coming down
[1:00:02] problem with that word is something it
[1:00:04] don't last forever that's right
[1:00:06] you can come to revival you get all
[1:00:08] happy and shout and excited
[1:00:10] and then it
[1:00:11] then the heat of the day the sun comes
[1:00:13] and melts it away that's right and
[1:00:15] you're left without and you can go from
[1:00:17] this stage here and you can walk off and
[1:00:20] still go to and backslide and reject
[1:00:22] god's word and go to hell
[1:00:27] you can come in here
[1:00:28] you can get justification be baptized
[1:00:31] get get the blood covering for your sins
[1:00:33] and you can be forgiven
[1:00:35] but at this point here if you stop at
[1:00:37] this veil and don't go through that veil
[1:00:39] you can walk right back out
[1:00:41] reject christ
[1:00:43] and go to hell
[1:00:45] you know brother brown
[1:00:47] whenever i was talking about the history
[1:00:48] talking paper uh history uh professor
[1:00:50] talking about the audience you're
[1:00:51] talking to when brother brandon made
[1:00:53] that quote in 65 about you can be
[1:00:55] baptized with the holy ghost every day
[1:00:56] of your life and still be lost and go to
[1:00:59] hell his audience was pentecostals
[1:01:02] the people that that that
[1:01:05] for the fathers of the light of that day
[1:01:07] there was in the furtherance of the
[1:01:09] light of that day
[1:01:10] and what are we here today we claim
[1:01:12] we're in the furtherance of the light
[1:01:14] for this day is that right
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:17] he expressed to him over and over all
[1:01:19] through his ministry
[1:01:20] one way after another to show that what
[1:01:22] they claimed they had they didn't have
[1:01:24] and they needed to go further they was
[1:01:26] out here in this here in this veil
[1:01:29] he said you need to go further
[1:01:31] but they couldn't understand him because
[1:01:33] they was stuck right here in the church
[1:01:35] ages or out here somewhere but he was
[1:01:37] trying to get him to here
[1:01:40] you can come and get baptized that's
[1:01:41] great
[1:01:42] and you can claim that's the holy ghost
[1:01:44] it might be a holy ghost blessing that's
[1:01:46] right but to get the seal himself you
[1:01:49] need to go through all the veils not
[1:01:50] just one veil i ain't gonna doubt that
[1:01:52] you went through a veil you went through
[1:01:54] a veil here there's three veils one veil
[1:01:56] there one veil there one veil there's
[1:01:58] three veils
[1:01:59] you went through one that's great but
[1:02:01] don't stop your journey don't turn
[1:02:03] around and go backwards don't go back to
[1:02:05] the world don't give up hope and this
[1:02:08] right here only thing it takes is simple
[1:02:10] faith that's all it takes to go your
[1:02:12] correct way that's right sure you got
[1:02:15] the word sure you saw the pillar of
[1:02:17] cloud the pillar of fire by day surely
[1:02:19] you walked across the sea in the desert
[1:02:21] like they did with moses sure you
[1:02:24] experienced all these things you and you
[1:02:26] experienced the anointing of the holy
[1:02:27] ghost strong they all did this
[1:02:30] but yet some of them turned around and
[1:02:33] went back to the world
[1:02:40] and uh let's go back and read a little
[1:02:42] bit about the lamp stands here
[1:02:45] this is the
[1:02:48] lamp was lit in a special way the first
[1:02:50] the priest took a fire from the sacred
[1:02:52] altar which was originally lighted by
[1:02:54] the fire of god
[1:02:55] he lit first of all the lamp that was
[1:02:57] sitting on top of the bowl he lit the
[1:02:59] second lamp from the flame of the first
[1:03:01] lamp you know the first chatter change
[1:03:03] you know the the
[1:03:04] i don't know if can't you can't really
[1:03:07] see it real good but it's right there
[1:03:08] the lamp stand
[1:03:09] it's got like uh seven lamps
[1:03:12] and they lit the light from the first
[1:03:14] church age to the second church age and
[1:03:16] then he lit the light from the second
[1:03:18] church age to the third church age it
[1:03:20] was a continual going all the way
[1:03:22] through the church ages
[1:03:24] and this holy fire from the altar being
[1:03:26] passed from lamp to lamp it is a
[1:03:28] wonderful type of the holy spirit in the
[1:03:30] seven church ages the original
[1:03:31] outpouring of pentecost which came out
[1:03:34] pouring direct from jesus on emergency
[1:03:36] is enduring his church through all seven
[1:03:38] ages and showing forth perfectly that
[1:03:40] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:03:42] and forever never changing in his
[1:03:45] essence or his ways
[1:03:47] that's that's a good thing this right
[1:03:48] here is to the church as a whole
[1:03:50] it is true that the fire of god from the
[1:03:53] altar was lit that first church age and
[1:03:56] that same holy spirit which is the type
[1:03:58] of oil that's in the in the cups it was
[1:04:00] the same oil for every one of those
[1:04:02] church ages that's right and the light
[1:04:04] from one went to the other went to the
[1:04:05] other went to the other one to the other
[1:04:08] but you notice it's still in this area
[1:04:10] that's right
[1:04:11] that is a type of the holy spirit that
[1:04:13] is not the holy spirit himself in order
[1:04:15] to get the holy spirit himself you have
[1:04:16] to break through the church ages and go
[1:04:19] into the holy of
[1:04:22] holies so
[1:04:26] and we can look at it a different way
[1:04:28] you can look at well i don't understand
[1:04:30] it that way well let's look at a
[1:04:31] different way
[1:04:32] in 1964 in the masterpiece
[1:04:36] you know sometimes you have to look
[1:04:37] things up wrong on purpose you know
[1:04:39] everybody's always concerned about being
[1:04:41] theoretically just exactly right have
[1:04:43] all your eyes dotted and your t's
[1:04:44] crossed but sometimes you have to look
[1:04:46] it up wrong on purpose to find it right
[1:04:48] because brother branham didn't always go
[1:04:50] by the rules of grammar that's in
[1:04:52] today's english instead of saying
[1:04:53] himself he would say his self or he
[1:04:56] would say itself so sometimes you have
[1:04:57] to do it wrong on purpose to find a
[1:05:00] correct quote
[1:05:01] but yet you're not wrong in writing down
[1:05:03] it incorrect grammar and finding the
[1:05:05] correct thing because what's right and
[1:05:07] wrong is somebody else's eyes is not
[1:05:09] right and wrong in god's eyes you're not
[1:05:11] supposed to be pleasing me you're not
[1:05:12] supposed to be pleasing somebody else
[1:05:14] you're supposed to be pleasing the lord
[1:05:17] and notice notice here in the life that
[1:05:20] was in the husk in the stalk in a tassel
[1:05:23] in the husk all gathers in the seed
[1:05:26] and the life that was in the stalk went
[1:05:29] and went to make another it went to the
[1:05:31] to the seed right
[1:05:32] justification made a way for
[1:05:34] sanctification right sanctification made
[1:05:38] a way for the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:40] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[1:05:43] for the holy ghost itself to come right
[1:05:45] down in perfection back to the word
[1:05:48] again to manifest itself
[1:05:54] now
[1:05:55] let's go back to the uh
[1:05:57] altering the
[1:05:59] tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:06:01] any this is brother brandon this is
[1:06:03] thoma in the hidden life this is where i
[1:06:06] got most of my thoughts was from the
[1:06:07] hidden life and the
[1:06:09] brother brown you know
[1:06:10] in in the message
[1:06:12] a handful on purpose i'll just call it
[1:06:14] that and just go on
[1:06:16] any reader knows that there were three
[1:06:19] two veils two compartments in a
[1:06:20] congregation the set up of god's
[1:06:23] tabernacle in the wilderness the first
[1:06:25] was the congregation
[1:06:27] then the holy place then the holiest of
[1:06:29] holies that's god's house
[1:06:31] god's dwelling place that's your
[1:06:33] dwelling place see that's the same thing
[1:06:35] with us we're body soul and spirit
[1:06:37] now you live in a three-room house
[1:06:40] remember you may have two bedrooms you
[1:06:42] may have three kitchens but you only
[1:06:44] live in a three-room house god lived in
[1:06:46] a three-room house when god was here on
[1:06:48] earth he occupied a three-home house the
[1:06:51] soul the body and the spirit
[1:06:54] of jesus
[1:06:56] you know and whenever i say that
[1:07:00] the holy spirit is a personal affair
[1:07:02] with the individual it's not a group
[1:07:04] affair
[1:07:06] you can't look at one individual and
[1:07:08] tell him he does not have the holy ghost
[1:07:10] or he does
[1:07:12] because you remember the dove and the
[1:07:14] crow the crow can eat every single thing
[1:07:16] to dovey the difference is the crow also
[1:07:19] goes out and eats filth yeah the the
[1:07:21] dove won't do that so whenever you tell
[1:07:23] somebody he has the holy ghost i know he
[1:07:25] has a holy ghost maybe it's because you
[1:07:27] only seen him whenever he was eating
[1:07:29] dove food
[1:07:30] he might be go out and eating crow food
[1:07:31] whenever you're not seeing it
[1:07:34] so you don't know if a person has a holy
[1:07:36] ghost and we had people come in and
[1:07:38] preach around our ranks they ate the
[1:07:40] word the word was all out here all
[1:07:43] around
[1:07:44] but they never went through this first
[1:07:45] fail
[1:07:46] but they preached the word and sometimes
[1:07:48] they was anointed when they came in here
[1:07:51] but if they never been past there they
[1:07:53] could turn around turn their back on
[1:07:54] christ and go out to the world
[1:07:57] so just because somebody preaches the
[1:07:59] truth
[1:08:00] hey
[1:08:01] that right there is manna all this out
[1:08:03] here was manna
[1:08:04] it came and you ain't got to be
[1:08:06] justified to get the manna
[1:08:08] just like a sinner comes in off the
[1:08:10] street and brother juan's up here
[1:08:12] preaching you the true manna
[1:08:15] he could be hearing that manna he can be
[1:08:17] receiving that word but if he came
[1:08:19] through here he ain't even justified yet
[1:08:22] he gets justified baptized
[1:08:24] with the water and with the fire
[1:08:27] then then he got to come through the
[1:08:28] veil
[1:08:29] one veil two veils three veils but only
[1:08:33] thing we ever talk about is the last
[1:08:35] veil
[1:08:36] and that is an important veil to talk
[1:08:37] about brother brandon whenever he was
[1:08:39] talking about the three kind of
[1:08:40] believers he spent most of his time on
[1:08:42] the true believer and then he realized
[1:08:44] that he called himself and he said well
[1:08:45] these other two kind of believers but
[1:08:47] they're not important anyway
[1:08:49] but they're still there yeah this right
[1:08:51] here is most important this is all we
[1:08:52] dwell on we don't talk about it on this
[1:08:54] other and people come up to this veil
[1:08:56] and they and they they say well i need
[1:08:58] to get through that veil they get
[1:08:59] through that veil they go through this
[1:09:01] well they think they're up here and
[1:09:03] they're not they're still back here
[1:09:05] and they think they got the holy ghost
[1:09:07] here but they still got another step to
[1:09:09] go through here through the church ages
[1:09:11] through the show bread see christ
[1:09:13] sitting on the mercy seat then you got
[1:09:14] the prayer for incense
[1:09:16] and and all the way through the churches
[1:09:18] you have the spirit go through there
[1:09:20] yeah and another thing this right here
[1:09:22] doesn't relate
[1:09:24] just for the laity only it's also to the
[1:09:26] clergy because brother branham said in
[1:09:28] the church ages the reason why god had
[1:09:30] to sin a prophet to the age because it
[1:09:32] wasn't just a laity that went off it was
[1:09:34] also the ministry that went off as well
[1:09:37] so and right through here you can see
[1:09:39] brother brown said in quotes
[1:09:41] and right in this area here is where we
[1:09:43] start getting on our fusses and fuse and
[1:09:45] say well we start talking about the
[1:09:47] church of god we start talking oh your
[1:09:48] church of christ oh you're catholic or
[1:09:50] you're that you don't love them you're
[1:09:52] supposed to love them
[1:09:55] you don't go along with their false
[1:09:56] doctrine but you ain't gonna be calling
[1:09:58] them even names all the time
[1:10:00] you call them this and that
[1:10:02] this is through here that's not through
[1:10:04] the last veil let's do this fail
[1:10:06] sure it's justification sanctification
[1:10:09] and sometimes this sanctification don't
[1:10:10] hold out very long that's right
[1:10:19] let's uh read a little more
[1:10:22] on the outside of laborers where they
[1:10:24] washed the sacrifice the sacrifice was
[1:10:27] killed on a brazen altar the blood was
[1:10:29] put in a charger and the high-priced pro
[1:10:32] high priest once a year walked in behind
[1:10:34] the veil to make an atonement
[1:10:37] notice the dressing of this high priest
[1:10:40] before he could enter that veil he had
[1:10:42] to be stripped and dressed right to go
[1:10:43] in
[1:10:45] so we go and the prophet of the age came
[1:10:47] with a message from god amen and he had
[1:10:50] the correct formula to get us even dress
[1:10:52] right we didn't even know how to dress
[1:10:53] right he had to dress us right and what
[1:10:55] if we rejected the messenger of the eye
[1:10:58] of the hour and say he's wrong and go in
[1:11:00] there and he dressed any kind of way we
[1:11:02] want to
[1:11:03] they'd be dragging us out with a rope on
[1:11:05] our on our ankles
[1:11:07] there's a correct way of approach you
[1:11:10] know he spoke sometimes there was
[1:11:11] whenever you met ins and and king
[1:11:14] kings and monarchs you had to approach
[1:11:15] him the right way even when you go to
[1:11:16] court you gotta approach the judge in
[1:11:18] the right way that's right because if
[1:11:20] you're approaching the wrong way you'll
[1:11:21] be hit with a contempt of court
[1:11:23] and sometimes on some of those kings of
[1:11:24] stuff they didn't want you turn your
[1:11:26] back on him you have to approach him in
[1:11:28] the right way and even when he went to
[1:11:29] go see the pope the pope wanted him to
[1:11:31] bow down and kiss his ring and worship
[1:11:33] him he said that's out
[1:11:35] you know you have to find out the way of
[1:11:36] approach and if you want to go worship a
[1:11:38] false god then you can go on but if you
[1:11:41] want to worship christ sometimes you
[1:11:42] gotta
[1:11:43] not get all the opportunities that other
[1:11:45] people get
[1:11:49] and that's what what the church is today
[1:11:51] what it needs is a stripping off of all
[1:11:53] these little cults and things dressed in
[1:11:55] the righteousness of jesus christ and
[1:11:57] enter in his walk must be different
[1:12:00] along the hymns of his garments he had a
[1:12:02] prom grant and a bell and then he walked
[1:12:05] was so perfect until the bells played
[1:12:07] holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:12:10] what we need today is not whether we're
[1:12:12] assemblies of god or churches of god or
[1:12:14] oneness or whatever it might be our walk
[1:12:17] ought to be playing to the public holy
[1:12:20] holy holy unto the lord
[1:12:22] so if we're living like the devil
[1:12:24] claiming we're holy we're not doing
[1:12:25] we're not dressed right we're not
[1:12:27] putting on the word like we should
[1:12:29] it's not cleaning all that filth off of
[1:12:32] us
[1:12:33] you know we believe in predestination
[1:12:34] and that's true predestination but for
[1:12:37] knowledge and
[1:12:39] also by by being an attribute of christ
[1:12:42] but if you're predestinated and you're
[1:12:44] saying that's okay i'm predestinated i
[1:12:46] ain't got to print i ain't got to repent
[1:12:48] i ain't going to do nothing i can live
[1:12:49] like the devil but that's okay because
[1:12:51] i'm going to heaven because i'm
[1:12:52] predestinated well you got a false
[1:12:54] version of predestination
[1:12:56] it might be true that you have to repent
[1:12:58] and be baptized and get the the fire
[1:13:00] from the altar or
[1:13:02] this right here is a type of christ your
[1:13:04] sins was placed on a lamb that's right
[1:13:07] he was the one that took your sins away
[1:13:08] from you wasn't some man it was christ
[1:13:11] that took it away but there's another
[1:13:12] veil here yet you might be justified
[1:13:15] here and you got your sins taken away
[1:13:16] but you got to be sanctified through
[1:13:18] this process here
[1:13:20] and and if you're if you're saying that
[1:13:22] you got the
[1:13:23] got predestination and you ain't got to
[1:13:25] do none of this stuff you can live like
[1:13:27] the devil
[1:13:28] you haven't been behind this veil yet
[1:13:32] you know i do know the word says
[1:13:35] you wasn't born again
[1:13:37] you wasn't predestinated by being born
[1:13:39] again
[1:13:40] but you was born again because you was
[1:13:42] already predestinated
[1:13:44] and you being born again just proved you
[1:13:45] as predestinated you might not have knew
[1:13:47] you as predestinated you might be
[1:13:49] suffering from some spiritual amnesia
[1:13:51] you might not have knew you existed
[1:13:52] before the foundation of the world until
[1:13:54] after you knew birth
[1:13:55] but the new birth didn't mean you was
[1:13:57] predestinated because you was already an
[1:13:59] attribute from the lord
[1:14:01] well if you want to look at it this way
[1:14:04] well i don't want to get into it but if
[1:14:05] you want to study free destination you
[1:14:07] can look at the church age book from
[1:14:08] chapter seven right in the middle all
[1:14:10] the way to the end the second half of it
[1:14:11] it's only two hours long so you can just
[1:14:13] take your little cursor wheel and move
[1:14:15] it over to the middle listen to the
[1:14:17] second half for predestination you can
[1:14:19] also listen to
[1:14:20] who is this melchizedek and the
[1:14:23] invisible union of christ
[1:14:25] but if you look in there it's for
[1:14:26] knowledge and then you're an attribute
[1:14:29] for knowledge is a passing thought you
[1:14:31] know you like the farmer said with a
[1:14:33] crow flew over his head he said you
[1:14:35] can't keep those thoughts from flying
[1:14:37] over your head but you ain't got dwell
[1:14:38] on them yeah
[1:14:39] and but the attribute is something
[1:14:41] different an attribute is actually part
[1:14:43] of you that is part of you
[1:14:46] so if you're an attribute from god
[1:14:48] that's more than just a passing thought
[1:14:50] you're a part of god that's right
[1:14:52] and i got to thinking of it this way one
[1:14:54] day you know what name is nothing more
[1:14:56] than what your nature is that expresses
[1:14:58] your nature
[1:14:59] and you look at the lamb's book of life
[1:15:02] that's a list of names
[1:15:05] and if you look at it another way that's
[1:15:06] a list of natures or his attributes
[1:15:09] that's his attributes listen in here
[1:15:11] that's manifested down through time
[1:15:13] but even with all that if you refuse to
[1:15:15] repent
[1:15:17] you're not you're not really truly an
[1:15:19] attribute you might be a foreknowledge
[1:15:21] you might been a thought
[1:15:23] but a thought can come and go
[1:15:25] it can be done away with that's right
[1:15:28] but an attribute is a part of you
[1:15:31] and then if you come in here and you
[1:15:32] refuse to repent you come back to this
[1:15:34] veil and you turn around and walk away
[1:15:37] we believe in once sealed always sealed
[1:15:40] we don't believe in what's saved always
[1:15:41] saved because you're saved right here
[1:15:44] out here you're probably lost come
[1:15:46] through this bell you go them up here
[1:15:48] and you're saved
[1:15:50] and even with with one of my my children
[1:15:54] before they even came to this point they
[1:15:57] felt the pull of the lord
[1:15:59] they wanted to do right they did what
[1:16:01] was right most of the time as much as
[1:16:02] possible they did they did what was
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] but sometimes they did this out here
[1:16:08] before they even got saved they come
[1:16:09] through here now that they're at that
[1:16:11] point they're
[1:16:12] they've been washed
[1:16:14] they washed their sins away they
[1:16:16] accepted jesus as their savior but
[1:16:18] that's not the stopping point of the
[1:16:20] journey
[1:16:21] you got to keep on going
[1:16:24] it is important this right here is a
[1:16:25] mighty important veil to break i'm not
[1:16:28] going to condemn anybody breaks this
[1:16:29] veil that's a veil we all must break
[1:16:33] we must come through this veil we must
[1:16:34] accept christ as our savior this veil
[1:16:37] here i'm not going to condemn anybody
[1:16:38] who breaks that veil they have to break
[1:16:41] that bail that's a mighty important veil
[1:16:43] to break through that's a good veil to
[1:16:45] break through but the most one the most
[1:16:47] important one of all to break through is
[1:16:48] this one
[1:16:51] and if and if you've been taught only to
[1:16:53] come this far and stop that's as far as
[1:16:55] you're gonna go
[1:16:56] because you're gonna think that you're
[1:16:58] looking at this wall instead of this
[1:17:00] veil
[1:17:01] you're going to think that this right
[1:17:02] here is that wall
[1:17:04] and remember you can't come in no other
[1:17:06] way
[1:17:07] through that veil yeah there was a
[1:17:09] there's a man in the bible jesus was
[1:17:10] talking about he came in another way and
[1:17:13] he was cast out in the outer darkness
[1:17:15] with gnashing of teeth because he did
[1:17:17] not have the wedding garment on that's
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:20] you got to go through the correct order
[1:17:22] through all through veils
[1:17:24] you know and there are some times where
[1:17:26] you can get received the holy ghost
[1:17:28] before you're even baptized there's been
[1:17:30] an example an example an example in the
[1:17:32] bible of that where jesus
[1:17:34] was was tell or
[1:17:37] where what hand are these men to be
[1:17:38] baptized when they receive jesus and
[1:17:40] some of them even receive the holy ghost
[1:17:41] that's right that's right so you can go
[1:17:43] through these veils but you got to come
[1:17:45] back here and get baptized in the
[1:17:46] correct water baptism
[1:17:48] and because you're predestinated and you
[1:17:50] went through this bell that means you
[1:17:51] want to do everything god wants you to
[1:17:53] do so you will do this voluntarily
[1:17:54] that's right you gotta have somebody
[1:17:56] control you to do that you're going to
[1:17:57] voluntarily
[1:17:59] well
[1:18:00] whenever john was in the river
[1:18:03] baptizing jesus he said it behooves us
[1:18:05] to follow all righteousness
[1:18:08] and if you've been through this veil
[1:18:09] you're going to want to do that you
[1:18:11] might not understand it you might have
[1:18:13] come across
[1:18:14] maybe a denominational preacher and
[1:18:16] saying this as far as you get goes
[1:18:17] through this veil and you're going to go
[1:18:19] no further
[1:18:20] you might be sincere but if you're
[1:18:22] really sincere you're going to read that
[1:18:23] bible and say what else do i need to do
[1:18:31] but in the show
[1:18:35] the importance of not stopping
[1:18:38] it says here and brother brandon says in
[1:18:40] 1963
[1:18:42] christ is a mystery of god revealed
[1:18:46] caleb and joshua was the only two
[1:18:48] that stood the test of time and went all
[1:18:50] the way through the rest of them didn't
[1:18:51] do it
[1:18:53] and uh every one of them died in the
[1:18:55] wilderness and jesus said they were
[1:18:57] eternally gone right after they had
[1:19:00] showed his blessing and power in their
[1:19:02] ages like luther wesley and so forth did
[1:19:05] he
[1:19:06] said our fathers did eat manna in the
[1:19:08] wilderness he said they're everyone dead
[1:19:11] that's in in john 6 43-58 if you want to
[1:19:14] look it up so they ate the manna out
[1:19:16] here in the wilderness they did they ate
[1:19:18] it
[1:19:19] everyone did that's it eternally
[1:19:20] separated from god their carcasses
[1:19:23] perished in the wilderness they are dead
[1:19:25] but i'm the bread of life that come from
[1:19:27] god out of heaven they couldn't see it
[1:19:30] they just couldn't see it that's right
[1:19:32] maybe because they had a veil between
[1:19:34] them and the holy of holies all right
[1:19:36] the church has long forgotten it they
[1:19:38] have accepted intellectual message
[1:19:41] intellectuals membership knowledge
[1:19:43] instead of the revelation of the truth
[1:19:46] of the word
[1:19:48] keep that in mind this is the bread that
[1:19:50] the church through every age is fed on
[1:19:53] has been a hidden manner just for the
[1:19:55] overcomer only
[1:19:56] now the church through the ages the
[1:19:58] overcomer is the one that's in behind
[1:20:00] here yeah but the church is out here but
[1:20:02] the overcomers has been this man in here
[1:20:05] not just this out there this matter
[1:20:07] right here always stay fresh this matter
[1:20:10] out here it got stale it got wiggle
[1:20:12] tails in it it got bacteria and it
[1:20:14] rotted away
[1:20:16] out here just shall live by faith that's
[1:20:18] a true message out here that's true but
[1:20:21] then you got a portion of it that's in
[1:20:22] there that still believes of justice
[1:20:24] truth by faith
[1:20:26] but now that this out here done got
[1:20:28] cankered and got wiggle terms and worms
[1:20:30] in it they go up to here and they get
[1:20:32] the just and then they think that's all
[1:20:33] they need and then they go right back
[1:20:35] out into the world then they come to the
[1:20:37] justice
[1:20:37] but this is a true part of the word
[1:20:39] that's true word
[1:20:41] but back here you got the true
[1:20:42] revelation of what it means
[1:20:45] this is the hidden manna this right here
[1:20:47] is open for everybody
[1:20:50] then you go up to the next ages wesleyan
[1:20:52] sanctification that had a good good
[1:20:55] truth to it and this word out here
[1:20:57] talked about sanctification that was a
[1:20:58] good word but back here you have the
[1:21:01] truth of it there's more of it yet
[1:21:03] this man has eaten watermelon he said
[1:21:05] this is good watermelon but there's more
[1:21:06] yet still there's some more of it
[1:21:10] back here there's a hidden truth to this
[1:21:12] and you can go further then we got the
[1:21:14] restoration of the gifts and i thought
[1:21:16] they've arrived
[1:21:18] it's good to have the restoration of the
[1:21:20] gifts this is that word talked about it
[1:21:22] down here got wicked tails and worms in
[1:21:24] it right there they had the restoration
[1:21:26] of the gifts they shouted they sang they
[1:21:28] danced they screamed they hollered they
[1:21:29] did it all that's great that's fantastic
[1:21:32] but there's more of it yet in the hidden
[1:21:34] manner you got to have the holy ghost
[1:21:36] himself in here
[1:21:38] and all screaming and shouting that's
[1:21:40] great there's nothing wrong with it
[1:21:42] nothing wrong with it all but you notice
[1:21:44] whenever moses and joshua moses was on
[1:21:46] the mountain and he came down and talked
[1:21:48] to joshua joshua heard a bunch of annoys
[1:21:52] jumping and shouting hollering screaming
[1:21:54] and that was and he said wow what is
[1:21:56] this is this a war moses says no that's
[1:21:57] not a war that's revery
[1:21:59] so just because you're jumping and
[1:22:00] shouting don't mean you're jumping and
[1:22:02] shouting over the word you could be
[1:22:03] jumping and shouting over a golden calf
[1:22:07] and there right there is another way of
[1:22:08] somebody turning their back on the truth
[1:22:10] because they thought moses was dead they
[1:22:12] talked the pre a minister
[1:22:15] to to make something that was anti-word
[1:22:18] and they went out and followed an entire
[1:22:19] word instead of standing with the truth
[1:22:22] so even though you come up this far and
[1:22:24] you receive the restoration of the gifts
[1:22:26] if you don't go through that bell you
[1:22:28] can still go right back out into the
[1:22:29] world and be lost
[1:22:32] i mean you can you can preach the true
[1:22:34] word all this mana out here that was out
[1:22:36] here
[1:22:37] this is even before you reach the stage
[1:22:39] of justification this mana
[1:22:42] now here it's not not even in the court
[1:22:44] it's out here the manna
[1:22:46] moses was required to get some of that
[1:22:48] manna put it in the golden
[1:22:50] uh
[1:22:51] a pot and put it back here in the holy
[1:22:53] holy and the shekinah glories
[1:22:58] so i'm not i'm going to tell you you've
[1:22:59] got to do this to get the holy ghost
[1:23:00] you've got to do that to get the holy
[1:23:02] ghost
[1:23:02] this is an individual affair between you
[1:23:04] and christ
[1:23:07] you know like i said before you're a
[1:23:08] body soul and spirit
[1:23:10] mostly most of y'all in here we don't
[1:23:12] have a lot of fellowship together
[1:23:13] outside of these walls the only thing i
[1:23:15] can see
[1:23:16] is your outside man this is all i see of
[1:23:19] you right here is this veil
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:22] that's that's the kitchen but if we go
[1:23:24] out and fellowship getting uh you know
[1:23:26] eating food that's that's the kitchen
[1:23:28] and then you got the living room we'll
[1:23:30] go out and fellowship that's the living
[1:23:32] room that's where god can commune with
[1:23:33] you
[1:23:34] and then then every once in a while
[1:23:36] something to slip out and i said well
[1:23:37] that right there is a real true believer
[1:23:39] he says things according to the word
[1:23:42] but i'm not into the i'm not into the
[1:23:44] third room
[1:23:45] only you and christ knows that
[1:23:47] maybe your family members might know a
[1:23:49] whole lot more than i do but your family
[1:23:51] members really are out here that's right
[1:23:54] this is me right here through this veil
[1:23:56] your family members can break this veil
[1:23:58] and they can see a lot more of you
[1:24:00] they might be able to experience hey
[1:24:02] they got really mad at that point that
[1:24:03] he really needs to repent whenever he
[1:24:05] did that
[1:24:06] i might not know that
[1:24:08] i might be out here and i'm thinking
[1:24:10] you're a saint
[1:24:11] but you might be
[1:24:12] you know somebody out there partying all
[1:24:14] the time i don't know
[1:24:16] i don't know that but your family might
[1:24:18] know that but i don't
[1:24:20] but even if you went through this stage
[1:24:22] of sanctification only you and god knows
[1:24:24] what's in here in this holy place that's
[1:24:26] right you notice inside of here
[1:24:29] brother brown said it was curtains all
[1:24:30] the way around that you just sound proof
[1:24:33] you couldn't hear the naysayers outside
[1:24:35] it's along with you and him alone
[1:24:40] and if
[1:24:41] and you know you talk about
[1:24:42] justification this is justification but
[1:24:45] there's another form of justification
[1:24:47] where brother branham taught that you
[1:24:48] have not done it in the first place it
[1:24:51] was the devil that tricked you into it
[1:24:52] it really wasn't even you that true
[1:24:54] justification don't happen until and
[1:24:56] here yeah that's not this justification
[1:24:59] this justification yeah you're you're
[1:25:01] forgiven of your sins but the true
[1:25:03] justification happens in there
[1:25:06] and we we talk about the
[1:25:08] statue of a perfect man
[1:25:11] you know you got faith and then you got
[1:25:12] virtue and godliness and
[1:25:15] and all this this other other stuff
[1:25:17] that's in there
[1:25:18] but brother bran i can read a quote and
[1:25:20] and uh statue of a perfect man i said
[1:25:22] the statue of the perfect man don't even
[1:25:24] start until you're in here
[1:25:27] the base of you the basis of everything
[1:25:29] even a statue of perfect man is faith it
[1:25:32] takes faith to go through this veil
[1:25:33] because you don't know what's on the
[1:25:34] other side of it this is hidden from you
[1:25:36] it's blocked
[1:25:39] unless it's open and you go in here you
[1:25:41] don't know christ you don't even know if
[1:25:42] he's real or not you don't you think it
[1:25:44] might be a story like santa claus until
[1:25:46] you break through that veil you don't
[1:25:47] know and then here you get you get
[1:25:49] washed up and you get your sins forgiven
[1:25:52] then you actually know what christ is
[1:25:54] but people outside here they don't know
[1:25:55] anything about christ
[1:25:57] they might be worshipping muhammad or
[1:25:59] somebody you don't know
[1:26:02] or they don't know they don't know jesus
[1:26:04] is real and even the jews they don't
[1:26:06] think
[1:26:08] they don't think that jesus is the true
[1:26:10] messiah
[1:26:12] i heard
[1:26:13] that history professor talked he was
[1:26:14] talking to one of the roman catholics
[1:26:16] over and they forced him to have a
[1:26:18] debate
[1:26:19] and they was condemning him because in
[1:26:21] their writings they say that jesus
[1:26:22] wasn't a messiah and they said some
[1:26:24] pretty strong things about jesus it was
[1:26:27] that they didn't agree with you can't
[1:26:28] you know
[1:26:30] and they try to nail him to the wall
[1:26:32] with it he said hey you know that's that
[1:26:33] jesus that's a different jesus that's
[1:26:35] not that jesus there's all kinds of
[1:26:37] jesus
[1:26:38] that's not that jesus
[1:26:40] and and you know and he knew what he was
[1:26:42] doing was misrepresenting it so he can
[1:26:44] get out of that charge and he it worked
[1:26:46] for him because they couldn't deny what
[1:26:47] he was saying there's all kinds of jesus
[1:26:51] but he didn't know what he was saying
[1:26:52] was actually the same thing what the
[1:26:53] apostle paul was saying
[1:26:55] in second corinthians in the 11th
[1:26:57] chapter he said that he espoused you as
[1:26:59] a virgin to christ that you would be
[1:27:02] begowed like eve and accept another
[1:27:04] jesus other than the one that's been
[1:27:06] taught to you
[1:27:07] so he was saying the same thing
[1:27:10] and you can't condemn a jew for
[1:27:12] rejecting the jesus of the denominations
[1:27:14] whenever the denomination's got three
[1:27:16] gods
[1:27:18] and that's one of the main things in the
[1:27:20] bible that you're not supposed to do
[1:27:21] you're not supposed to commit sacrilege
[1:27:22] and worship idols and there's all kinds
[1:27:24] of idols always throughout the
[1:27:25] denominational system
[1:27:28] so we can't condemn them for not
[1:27:30] receiving the word when they don't even
[1:27:32] know what the word is they they're still
[1:27:34] out here with the veil
[1:27:38] and we're trying to condemn them and
[1:27:39] we're still stuck
[1:27:41] right here we ain't even went through
[1:27:42] that one we're trying to condemn a man
[1:27:43] that's stuck at this one sure well we're
[1:27:46] trying to condemn a man of stuck at this
[1:27:48] one
[1:27:49] and how how are we any better off when
[1:27:52] we're not there we haven't went all the
[1:27:53] way through but we're condemning this
[1:27:54] man because he went went as far as we
[1:27:56] have
[1:27:58] you know
[1:27:59] whenever one of the disciples asked
[1:28:01] jesus said what what about john what
[1:28:03] what is he going to do and john said
[1:28:06] that has nothing to do with you what is
[1:28:08] it if he stays until i come
[1:28:10] follow you me
[1:28:12] follow you me
[1:28:13] follow christ individual affair
[1:28:16] you gotta worry about everybody doing
[1:28:18] everything
[1:28:20] but you know by their fruits you're a
[1:28:22] fruit inspector
[1:28:23] it's somebody that's claiming they're in
[1:28:25] here
[1:28:26] and they're still doing things that a
[1:28:28] person out here would do
[1:28:30] then they're not supposed to be leading
[1:28:32] the house of god
[1:28:33] you know they can come in the
[1:28:35] congregation this is a congregation they
[1:28:37] can come into the court
[1:28:39] but you're not supposed to be letting
[1:28:40] them in here teaching everybody else
[1:28:42] that what they're doing is right
[1:28:45] living by example that's right
[1:28:47] if you're if you're
[1:28:49] on a platform
[1:28:51] and you're living a life of sin you're
[1:28:53] kind of you're what you're doing
[1:28:55] indirectly without even realizing it
[1:28:57] you're telling everybody out there that
[1:28:58] they can live the same kind of filthy
[1:28:59] life you
[1:29:08] can well let's read the
[1:29:12] statue of a perfect man
[1:29:15] so now let us read now first peter
[1:29:16] serkin second peter the first chapter
[1:29:19] portion of it this is this is where he
[1:29:21] was reading about the statue of a
[1:29:23] perfect man about faith
[1:29:25] simon peter a servant an apostle of
[1:29:27] jesus christ is them to obtain like
[1:29:29] precious faith
[1:29:30] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:29:32] our savior jesus christ
[1:29:35] like that way
[1:29:37] that stated i like the way it stated
[1:29:39] right there because my whole subject
[1:29:40] this morning is based on faith see let
[1:29:43] me read it again this is talking about
[1:29:45] the statue of a perfect man
[1:29:47] simon peter a servant an apostle of
[1:29:49] jesus christ to them that obtained like
[1:29:52] precious faith through righteousness of
[1:29:54] god our savior in jesus christ
[1:29:58] notice he is saying i have obtained this
[1:30:01] faith i am addressing this to them that
[1:30:04] has attained the like precious faith
[1:30:07] it's not to the outside world it's not
[1:30:10] to the outside world
[1:30:11] this is to the church those that are in
[1:30:13] christ the ones that's in the holy of
[1:30:15] holies
[1:30:17] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[1:30:19] through the knowledge of god and through
[1:30:21] jesus christ our lord
[1:30:23] according as his divine power has given
[1:30:26] unto us all things his divine power now
[1:30:29] has given us unto all things that
[1:30:31] pertaining to life golling godliness
[1:30:33] through the knowledge of him that has
[1:30:34] called us to his glory and virtue
[1:30:37] whereby we are given unto us exceedingly
[1:30:40] great precious promises by these
[1:30:44] we might be partakers of the divine
[1:30:46] nature but we are partakers of the
[1:30:48] divine nature and where is that divine
[1:30:50] nature it's inside the holy of holies
[1:30:53] outside you can feel his anointing but
[1:30:55] him himself is where he wants to meet
[1:30:57] you that's what he said in in exodus 30
[1:31:01] he's going to meet you in the holy of
[1:31:02] holies at the mercy seat
[1:31:10] that's uh you know and sometimes
[1:31:13] you know we got people who claim that
[1:31:16] you got to get born again and then you
[1:31:17] got to grow and that's true but what
[1:31:20] they're calling born again is being what
[1:31:22] birth or
[1:31:23] calling the birth is that the water
[1:31:25] baptism will pull
[1:31:27] but brother brandon didn't teach yet and
[1:31:29] then they try to justify it and they say
[1:31:34] well the statue of the perfect man and
[1:31:36] all that
[1:31:38] and the pentecostals was saying you get
[1:31:41] baptized with the holy spirit and then
[1:31:42] he comes and gets spirit filled brother
[1:31:44] brown said that's not right it's not two
[1:31:46] different instances it's one instance
[1:31:52] and let's just read what brother branham
[1:31:54] said about this
[1:31:56] uh this is in the church age book
[1:31:58] page 147
[1:32:00] peter said repent and be baptized in the
[1:32:03] name of jesus christ for remission of
[1:32:04] sin and you shall receive the gift of
[1:32:06] the holy ghost
[1:32:07] paul said have you received the holy
[1:32:10] ghost since you believed this is the
[1:32:12] whole problem
[1:32:14] right here people repent of their sins
[1:32:18] they get baptized in bot and water but
[1:32:21] they don't go on and receive the holy
[1:32:23] ghost you believe unto receiving the
[1:32:26] spirit believing on jesus is a step in
[1:32:29] the right direction don't condemn them
[1:32:30] they're going the right way
[1:32:33] which is toward the holy ghost but the
[1:32:35] people stop there they go as far as
[1:32:38] water and then stop
[1:32:40] they believe and then stop the bible
[1:32:43] does not say that you receive when you
[1:32:45] believe it is have you received the holy
[1:32:48] ghost since you believed the exact and
[1:32:50] literal translation is did ye having
[1:32:53] previously believed received the holy
[1:32:55] ghost
[1:32:56] the people believe and then stop
[1:32:59] you don't receive the holy ghost when
[1:33:01] you believe unto him
[1:33:04] having repented you go on and receive
[1:33:06] the holy ghost do you see it
[1:33:09] that is what is wrong with our
[1:33:10] fundamentalists they have no power for
[1:33:13] they stop
[1:33:14] short of pentecost
[1:33:18] you know i right there
[1:33:20] if you say that to some people they get
[1:33:23] really offended
[1:33:24] but brother branham he said now i want
[1:33:27] to go further and when i do i know i am
[1:33:29] going to cause some emotions to rise but
[1:33:32] that's something i'm not responsible for
[1:33:34] so he wasn't responsible for them to get
[1:33:36] offended he was responsible just to
[1:33:38] teach the word amen
[1:33:40] and if they're getting offended they're
[1:33:42] not getting defended as you they're
[1:33:43] getting offended at the word
[1:33:46] but you're still responsible to tell the
[1:33:48] word so these people they come up so far
[1:33:52] and they stop
[1:33:53] so if it's if it's not two different
[1:33:55] works
[1:33:57] and some people say it's a growing
[1:33:58] process
[1:34:00] then what is it you know you know you
[1:34:02] come up and to a certain age if you're a
[1:34:05] son but then you get adopted later the
[1:34:08] adoption is in the holy of holies
[1:34:10] but the way i see it
[1:34:12] if you look brother brandon talked about
[1:34:14] it as a a a woman carrying a child he
[1:34:17] said that whenever the baby comes forth
[1:34:20] it's water blood and life
[1:34:22] is that right
[1:34:24] so that means up at the point up at the
[1:34:26] beginning
[1:34:27] that's just the conception
[1:34:30] you're being conceived
[1:34:32] and then you got to carry it for nine
[1:34:33] months
[1:34:34] but that's not the baby then there's
[1:34:37] there's
[1:34:37] the water breaks
[1:34:40] that's the water breaking and then you
[1:34:42] get the the blood
[1:34:44] and then it becomes life
[1:34:47] and then after life is the baby itself
[1:34:51] the water is not the baby the blood is
[1:34:53] not the baby the life is set the life is
[1:34:56] not the baby but the baby comes after
[1:34:58] that
[1:35:00] it takes all three of those to make up
[1:35:02] the baby
[1:35:03] and then because if you don't have the
[1:35:05] life you got a baby
[1:35:07] but it's still born it's dead
[1:35:10] and we come up here and we get we get
[1:35:12] into the church and we get baptized we
[1:35:16] come and get the blood and then we go
[1:35:17] through here through sanctification
[1:35:20] water blood but then we fell short of
[1:35:23] the birth we never go through the birth
[1:35:25] and this is your beginning process at
[1:35:27] the bottom of the statue of a perfect
[1:35:29] man where is faith but it took you faith
[1:35:32] to get all the way up in the ear and
[1:35:33] then after this faith is whenever you
[1:35:35] build the statue of the perfect man and
[1:35:37] come up into the capstone
[1:35:40] but you will find brother bran you can
[1:35:41] even find quotes for brother brown said
[1:35:43] you can find people that's out here
[1:35:44] that's not even in through this process
[1:35:46] at all still out here in the lost in the
[1:35:48] world and you can find some of them that
[1:35:50] has some attributes of the statue of the
[1:35:52] perfect man
[1:35:53] but he says like stuffing peacock
[1:35:55] feathers in a crow you're putting it on
[1:35:57] that's manufacturing
[1:35:59] until you get in here you're not resting
[1:36:01] you're just impersonating a christian
[1:36:04] kind of like somebody was trying to make
[1:36:06] a pastor feel bad one day and he said
[1:36:08] you've been preaching long enough you
[1:36:10] know your congregation you know who the
[1:36:12] true believers the unbelievers and the
[1:36:13] make believers are you should know that
[1:36:15] so which ones are they
[1:36:18] well if you look at it correctly
[1:36:21] as a person
[1:36:22] you don't like what i said earlier about
[1:36:25] jesus he said what is that to you
[1:36:27] look at yourself first
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:30] you got the the body the soul and the
[1:36:32] spirit this outside man is an unbeliever
[1:36:35] so look at yourself outside man
[1:36:38] unbeliever you don't have to look out
[1:36:39] there you can look look behind the
[1:36:41] pulpit
[1:36:42] the outside man is an unbeliever the
[1:36:44] spirit in there that's the make-believer
[1:36:47] but the soul that's the true believer
[1:36:49] because the only thing that's in there
[1:36:51] is the truth belief of god's word
[1:36:53] and if it ain't true belief in god's
[1:36:55] word up here
[1:36:56] then you've never went past the most
[1:36:58] important veil
[1:36:59] you might went past these other two but
[1:37:01] you never went past the most important
[1:37:03] one
[1:37:12] maybe i should
[1:37:14] just stop right there
[1:37:21] we'll go back and address
[1:37:23] that quote i read at the very beginning
[1:37:28] this is in leadership
[1:37:30] many of you think i got the baptism of
[1:37:33] the holy ghost i'm going to heaven
[1:37:35] that don't mean one thing you're going
[1:37:37] to heaven no sir you can have the
[1:37:39] baptism of the holy ghost every hour in
[1:37:41] your life and still be lost and go to
[1:37:43] hell the bible says so uh-huh
[1:37:46] that's exactly right
[1:37:49] now where's the bible say that
[1:37:54] we already read one section in john
[1:37:58] we can go back here and look at uh
[1:38:02] if i can find it real quick
[1:38:08] maybe it'd be quicker if i just went to
[1:38:10] it in the bible instead of trying to do
[1:38:12] my notes
[1:38:14] see here in uh hebrews 3 15.
[1:38:18] let's go to it in my bible out hebrews 3
[1:38:21] 15
[1:38:23] new testament hebrews
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:40] while it said today
[1:38:42] if you hear his voice hard not your
[1:38:44] hearts as in the provocation
[1:38:46] for some when they heard so they heard
[1:38:48] the word
[1:38:49] did provoke howbeit and all of them came
[1:38:52] out of egypt by moses
[1:38:55] but with whom he was grieved for forty
[1:38:57] years was it not with them that is sin
[1:39:00] who carcases fell in the wilderness
[1:39:03] and to whom swear he that they should
[1:39:04] not enter into his rest so that's the
[1:39:07] holy of holies that's the rest place it
[1:39:09] was to them that believe not so we're
[1:39:11] coming right back to faith again
[1:39:13] so we see that they could not enter
[1:39:16] because of their unbelief
[1:39:18] so it don't matter where you are on your
[1:39:20] journey
[1:39:22] the morning the moment that you turn
[1:39:24] your back on christ reject his word
[1:39:26] and tell people that the word is not
[1:39:29] right that's the moment you're
[1:39:31] manifesting your own belief
[1:39:34] and that's a very dangerous point to be
[1:39:36] on because it won't be long that you'll
[1:39:38] be turning 180 degrees and walking out
[1:39:41] of the tabernacle walking out of the
[1:39:43] holy place
[1:39:44] walking out of the courtyard and walking
[1:39:47] back out into the world
[1:39:49] so just because you came up to a point
[1:39:51] of baptism that's great we're not
[1:39:53] knocking that at all
[1:39:55] we're not you come to a point of
[1:39:57] receiving jesus christ for covering over
[1:39:59] your sins we're not knocking that at all
[1:40:01] not knocking it but you need to press on
[1:40:04] through sanctification
[1:40:05] you need to press on until you can get
[1:40:08] through the first veil through the
[1:40:10] second veil and into the holy holies
[1:40:12] through the third veil which is the most
[1:40:13] important person in there
[1:40:15] is the one who bought your salvation
[1:40:18] that way you can become one with him
[1:40:21] then you can start on that statue of the
[1:40:23] perfect man
[1:40:25] let's power his
[1:40:27] dear lord jesus we thank you for
[1:40:30] allowing us to see once again that
[1:40:32] you're expressing your love to your
[1:40:34] people lord to show them lord that
[1:40:37] it's not all about tickling other years
[1:40:39] and
[1:40:40] making people feel good so they can
[1:40:42] bubble dance but sometimes lord we got
[1:40:43] to look at the situation and shake
[1:40:45] ourselves lord
[1:40:47] and ask us which avail are we looking at
[1:40:50] are we truly looking into the holy of
[1:40:52] holies but or are we just looking toward
[1:40:54] the outer court we can look at the
[1:40:57] brazen altar we can look at
[1:40:59] the laver but if we actually partaken of
[1:41:02] that father and when we go past that and
[1:41:05] we go to another veil are we
[1:41:07] we're truly looking at what we're
[1:41:09] thinking we're looking at are we just
[1:41:10] looking at another veil
[1:41:12] and when we break through there laura we
[1:41:14] see the the church ages with you your
[1:41:16] holy spirit dealing with the church down
[1:41:18] through time lord and
[1:41:20] we hear the manna
[1:41:22] coming from out from behind the holy of
[1:41:24] holies but unless we go actually go
[1:41:26] behind the holy of holies lord there's a
[1:41:28] sound barrier there
[1:41:29] and we're not hearing what's coming from
[1:41:31] the holy holies but we're hearing what
[1:41:33] people were saying out there in the
[1:41:34] outer courts when they're just reading
[1:41:36] the unrevealed manna
[1:41:38] they can say some mighty good things and
[1:41:40] and it's uplifting you but father but
[1:41:42] what we desire and what we long for is
[1:41:45] to be in there so we can partake of that
[1:41:47] hidden manna
[1:41:48] so we can be one with you lord in that
[1:41:50] bedroom chamber lord where we can rest
[1:41:53] no longer putting on struggling through
[1:41:55] the struffles of life lord
[1:41:58] but lord we're there with you and you
[1:42:00] alone lord with the let the curtain shut
[1:42:02] down behind us where we can shut out all
[1:42:05] thoughts of the evil lord around us and
[1:42:07] we can be truly become one with you lord
[1:42:11] that we can walk hand in hand through
[1:42:13] the promised land father we thank you
[1:42:15] for all things lord we just ask you to
[1:42:16] just bless your people lord
[1:42:19] let them not be looking at others and
[1:42:21] with that person that's that veil that
[1:42:23] person at this veil but lord help us
[1:42:25] each look at our own lives father help
[1:42:28] us determine where we are at in our veil
[1:42:30] and lord if we're thank you one place
[1:42:32] and we're really at a different one we
[1:42:34] just pray that you would send your holy
[1:42:36] spirit to quicken us father to shake us
[1:42:38] out of our lukewarm condition father to
[1:42:40] bring us so we can be on fire for you
[1:42:43] not an outward emotion type of way but
[1:42:46] lord walking with you in the way you
[1:42:48] want us to walk with you father
[1:42:50] regardless of what the outside says
[1:42:53] father
[1:42:54] because we are only wanting to please
[1:42:56] you the most important one father
[1:42:58] and when we please you we are to be kind
[1:43:01] and courteous to others
[1:43:03] but lord you're the most important one
[1:43:05] we thank you for all things lord we just
[1:43:07] ask you just bless us
[1:43:09] as we go about our way and for the
[1:43:10] remainder of the service for we ask it
[1:43:13] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:43:14] amen
[1:43:26] praise the lord
[1:43:38] um

[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:29] to you
[1:45:30] that uh
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:56] well you see just like brother george
[1:45:58] said
[1:46:00] our call is the world
[1:46:02] and the holy supporter
[1:46:05] praise the lord
[1:46:06] the people in the altar call
[1:46:10] they're going through the first video
[1:46:12] i don't know
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:17] anybody enjoy the thing i'm wearing my
[1:46:19] mind mike i'm sorry
[1:46:22] they can
[1:46:24] they have the same daylight they have
[1:46:26] the light that they are living under
[1:46:28] it's the same as the sun and the moon
[1:46:32] the people in the holy place
[1:46:34] they are surviving on the light of the
[1:46:36] seven golden candlestick
[1:46:40] and sometimes it can get smoking
[1:46:44] the people in the holiest of holy
[1:46:46] they don't have daylight they don't have
[1:46:49] candle light
[1:46:50] they have the light of god's presence
[1:46:55] you see so
[1:46:57] i mean and a lot of things we can talk
[1:46:59] about it
[1:47:01] but you see i believe the preacher
[1:47:02] encouragement
[1:47:04] to us tonight
[1:47:07] is for us to
[1:47:08] to press on press forward
[1:47:12] get into the presence of god
[1:47:15] get into the presence of god
[1:47:17] because you see what will happen is that
[1:47:19] a
[1:47:22] you have not hit that present anything
[1:47:25] can turn you back
[1:47:27] you can get tired with the smoke
[1:47:30] it says this place is too smoky
[1:47:32] and you can turn back
[1:47:34] the only time you will ever be satisfied
[1:47:37] when you have gone behind that veil
[1:47:41] somebody can talk to you
[1:47:43] in the auto call you can get angry and
[1:47:45] you can turn back
[1:47:48] somebody can talk to you in the holiest
[1:47:50] of holy
[1:47:52] the only time you can get to the place
[1:47:54] where there is no return is when you go
[1:47:57] behind and find the curtain
[1:48:00] praise the lord
[1:48:03] so i think
[1:48:04] that's a good encouragement
[1:48:07] let's press on
[1:48:11] never feel satisfied of how long you've
[1:48:13] been in the message and who baptized you
[1:48:15] and who is your favorite pastor
[1:48:19] all of those things are wonderful
[1:48:23] but our calling is to go behind the veil
[1:48:27] praise the lord
[1:48:29] i believe the holy spirit will take us
[1:48:31] from there
[1:48:32] wherever the preachers stop tonight
[1:48:35] the lord is able to pick us up
[1:48:38] and fill us with the things that are
