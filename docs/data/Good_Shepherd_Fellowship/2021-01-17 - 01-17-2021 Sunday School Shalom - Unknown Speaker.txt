TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] i think i have that right the symphony uh peter the wolf you remember that the old story how they used to i've heard that how they take the drums and make the little woodpecker pecking and peter going out the growling of the wolf the tuning of the horns a symphony now if you don't understand a symphony it's a big bunch of racket to you if you don't understand it you've got to understand what it is it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out a drama in this sympathy now we notice the only one that understands the sympathy is the composure and those who are interested in knowing it knows it's changes knows what takes place the composure knows every move from the end to the beginning from the beginning to the end did you know that the one who wrote it up he composes this he knows every little junction if he knows every junction so does the director have to do to direct it now how you go twist your creed in that one little miscue of that stick that sign one little missed sign at a junction would throw the whole orchestra off throw the whole symphony out now you know that's true the composure and director has to be in the same spirit that's why the minister and the word of god god's great sympathy he's been playing since the dawn of time the minister at the word has to not look over here it's happening this rpr and make it this way he's got to go the way the sheep music says take it that's the way the gospels got to be preached the way the word says take it i don't know if you throw a creed in there you got the whole thing messed up it's got to go to make the drama just exactly right the director has to go what the composer said beat i just exactly saw the music and watch it's all done by signs it's got to be the right kind of sign to give the right kind of a sound paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who will prepare himself for war now you see the composure god who wrote the bible it's all together the revelation of jesus christ he know the changes of time and amanda the director who's directing them the son of the age has to go just exactly with the bible signs hallelujah thank you oh brother sister what's the matter with the world why am i crazy there's something wrong somewhere amen glory to god the symphony is not in harmony with the sheep music [Music] you're making church creed and everything else when it's the words supposed to be priests to be manifested something wrong with the directors then the whole band's mixed up they don't know what to do they're all funny what happened what this do what this happens how does that happen they don't know what to do now scattered because it never come in harmony with the word that's what samaras are what we call last day revival that's why i smeared our pentecostal message we gotta upbeat with the bible when organized like they did back there she will feed god have mercy i wish i had words that i could make it sink in because it was that i could spit it open and pour it in can't you see my brother sister it's got to be in harmony the director's got to be with the word when it says one thing don't say something else you'll give the wrong sign then the whole thing goes out a rhythm it's ryan god's word is a great sympathy a symphony rather excuse me you must begin like he did in the music you must begin with him notice get in the rhythm of it say well i joined church that's not the rhythm i did saw that i knocked the rhythm i went up to the auburn i said i believe jesus christ son of god satan does the same thing that's not the rhythm see you get out of swing what happened maybe some director told you shake hands and put your name on the boat join our club our organization you're all out of the swing then when the real thing begins to happen out here amongst the little bunch you'll say well what about that they're out of harmony go back to the word and see who's out of harmony see what god promised see what the composer said about it see you got everybody in your audience that's reason the world's looking around with a church army looked upon as a bright shining star a light that's sitting on a hill that no man can hot shine no man condemn it today it's a laughing stock of the world the cause that the directors got out of harmony with the composer see what i mean they're beating out things that isn't in there the musicians hardly knows what to do now the church they're all in a twist we've been talking about all this stuff all years and commitment now joining right in with it something wrong somewhere notice you must begin in the music like he did get into the rhythm of it get into the promised word see the way he'd done it at the beginning see the way you've done it in the middle age see the way he does it now always the same watch the director how he does it if he doesn't do it if he points you into some organization there never was a director done that a director always pointed you to the word the prophets of old pointed to the word they was the word they lived the word and what did it do it manifested god that brought the written word for that day to life because it come to them it was revealed to them that was a rock hallelujah all right jesus christ comes word is our rock upon god the revealed word of god shalom to the real believer peace we're at the end on upon this rock i'll build my church the revelation of the word said well you're a great man you're like moses you're a great man you're like that ain't it but the revelation said darth the son of god said flesh and blood never reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven upon this revealed truth i'll be on my church what is it he is the word in the beginning was the word of words with god and the word was god and the word still god just he is same today manifest himself as he was moses elijah owned down in jesus and the same god today makes him jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8. see they never poured you to a group they pointed you to a person pointed you to a word god what i began brother bram at the cross but again at the cross with him repent believe the word that's what the bible says then follow through the rhythm of the rest of the word you say well what shall i do just keep on following the rhythm of the word if repent is the first thing that you're recognizing do that that's your first step put your next step where the word says all around and marching on with him don't break the rhythm if you're a part of god symphony don't break the rhythm of the word don't ask well why why did this happen i tried it brother brown and when they turned me out to what i done i just like started at them that's why he knows the rhythm how it's got to change and what junctions has got to make yes sir before it's written he knows all about he knows the rhythm don't ask why believe it god has moved down to the time of history with his promised word in each age and has never failed to break the rhythm by the power of god when it comes to the elected and vindicated people the rhythm of his word in the days of noah the rhythm of his word in the days of noah the days of moses in the days of elijah in the days of john in the days of david in the days of jesus on down he keeps the rhythm of the word right on down never has broken he's come right down through history and uh elected seed that seen and bolina fall right into that rhythm with it the others say well but the church says that has got nothing to do with it you're not born do that you're born into the word for you're born into christ christ is the word yes sir each one in its age you say well i'll just say brother graham i can't look ahead then look up god promised if you look up see shown peace god's peace dresses he said and why does others make fun of me brother you know others make fun of me and saying uh um i got long hair i'm old-fashioned to the women the man because i'll be the bible you don't have fellowship with us no more we can't accept you because that you believe such and such and you know it's exactly the way the words written god's duty bound to you to back that up then it certainly is don't matter about that why they say to make fun of god's a jealous god remember suffering for his word's sake is growing pains of his grace when you suffer for his word saying it's just growing pains you know a little kid 10 12 years old gets pains come and say mama my arms hurt my legs are hurting so forth it's growing pains it shows he's got some good vitamins he's growing up and when somebody begins to make money to say she's old-fashioned look at him he's oh i'll tell you he used to be all right just remember it's growing pains that's how persecution is good for you it's growing pains oh yes he permits crosses and crossroads and junctions he always does that in order to perfect us for his service he permits those things to happen can't you understand that he does that so he can perfect you for the call that he's called you for that's your growing pains he did daniel that way you know he did the hebrew children in the fire furnace wasn't it five furniture the five furnace only broke the bands that hadn't bound that's all the furnace did just burnt loose the bands sometimes it takes trials to break the bands of the world off of us take you out of the world might be have to take out your creed first like the man drowning in the river he had to take him out of the river before he get the river out of the man that's about what god has to do sometime let him troll you out one time let me get the world out of you gotta get you out of the world first sometimes these growing pains is what doesn't oh yes god stands on the promised word for each new year he stands on it this year to fulfill what he's got promised for this year whatever it is i want to be right in the center of his will in the future like they did like abraham when he met his crossroads he didn't know how he would do it god told him i'm going to give you a son 25 years he waited for it finally the son come and god said now by this son i'm going gonna make you the father of many nations take him up there and kill him take him up and kill him destroy the very thing that he'd wait 25 years on take him up and kill him abraham never worried it never bothered him he picked up the wood and put it up on a little donkey and took his son tucked him up the top of the hill to offer him up because abraham knew that he had received him as one from the dead sarah's womb was dead he was sterile so there's no way this boy he's 100 years old and she was 90. so he come by a promised word the same god that made the promise that i'll make you a father nations after 25 years and been 100 years old him and his wife received the child if god told him to offer him up god was able to raise him up praise god brother i feel religious oh how could i feel i know there's one thing he's able to raise him up again hallelujah we'll stand on that unadulterated word of light for this hour god will raise us up when this generation comes forth a shining light against this generation amen no wonder he said the queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with her generation and condemn this one because she came from that most parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold greater than solomon and sharon how that little uh queen way down uh heathen saw that light and convert miles through the desert three months on a camel's back to sear the wisdom of solomon them standing right there was solomon being a type a figure of it and then come in seeing wesley luther all the others denominations back here being a figure in a type of what's happening now and they walk right through it oh all right far so the new year is determined by god just determined to stay in his word walk where the word says well as we come now to the close like others elected seed did in their day when they saw the word what did they do it they walked in if they were elected seed in other ages for he is the unfailing word how many believe that jesus christ is the word oh my i heard a program the other day of a certain denomination of people mr hms richard said it wrote the book for the year i don't want to disagree with the man like that although being a seventh-day adventist i don't agree with sebastian's doctrine but i certainly like the man i'll disagree with him that might be hms richard's book for the new year but my book and your book for the new year's the book of the whole year the bible god's word just make it live to what it's promised to live for yes sir and every coming year to come and every year that has been he's the eternal of god living through the eternal word that he spoke when every bible truth and every promise in it has been vindicated as it has been down to the ears how god promised that he'd destroy the world with water and he'd vindicated it by moses or by noah he promised that he would send to the liver and bring israel up out of egypt they sojourned for 400 years he did just exactly that amen and he swore that he'd raise up david how'd david be a son uh christ would be his son through david would come christ hi swore that he would do that he did just that he promised he would send john the baptist before the coming of jesus christ he did just that he promised he would send a messiah he did just that he promised the world would get into a great group of organizations and make a system of power known as a beast and would be up there sitting on seven hills it did just exactly that how the church should be persecuted unto death they did just exactly that how they come out in reformation they did just exactly that how he promised that each agent would be any promise for this age and here he is today making that word live just exactly like he did at the beginning certainly and when every promise is fulfilled death is sworn up in victory jesus will come and the last one is vindicated then there will come an eternal peace upon the earth and an eternal shalom an eternal shalom peace will rest upon the earth when jesus came the prince of peace why wasn't there peace because all the word wasn't fulfilled in his day he's fulfilling it today but when all of his promise were which was a thought of god a word is a thought expressed god in his thinking thought it and expressed it through his prophets and now it has to be fulfilled and when he foretold us of these things so we wouldn't make a mistake and blunder in darkness then when we see it being fulfilled now he promised to send christ the second time and whenever he does when christ comes the second time there will be an eternal shalom listen friends as we close remember the bible is the fountain of all wisdom it doesn't come from dr phdld it comes from the word of god there was doctors of divinity sitting there by the hundreds and a little 12 year old boy i called him down because he was the word a little boy had no education at all yet he was the word because he was the light spoken for that day he was manifesting that word the word was in him it had to be no wonder what he said come to pass because he was the word you understand all i understand say amen he was the word remember the bible not some book of the year that's written by man let every man's word be alive but mind the truth and cults and religions and and so forth all just get it so conglomerate up when you get a bunch of men into it god never did deal in such a group if jesus would come today would he take sides of the methodists but the baptist with the adventist jehovah witness christian science pentecostals presbyterians nasser he certainly would not it's an individual affair you and god there's no two men see eye to eye together alike no two thumbs like god deals with a individual and how you know whether he's right or not then look back and see if he's with the word if he's with the word then god's dealing with me isn't something else is dealing with it that's right remember the bible is the fountain of all wisdom and holds all the hopes of the future in it shalom god's peace like a story is told one time about a little boy lost his daddy before he was old enough to see his father just an infant baby when his father died one day he got about 10 12 years old he had another brother called john he went to his brother and he said john which is several years older said you you remember dad said yeah say what was he like said well he was a tall man and he was a very fine man he's always good to mother he was kind to me and he was kind to everybody he said well is that all you know about him john he said well i'll tell you said henry said everybody says i look like him and said everybody says i got a nature like him he said oh that's good that's what i want to know so when i see you i see my daddy there it is when the world sees jesus christ it'll be in you when this word that's written up today where do you see jesus and david when the word was made manifest through him how do you see christ god and elijah and that chariot going into heaven see jesus in elijah because the word was vindicated how do you see it in moses jesus is in moses the bible said so see that's right here's a burning bush that was with moses in the wilderness how will people know jesus christ one day he sees him in you when they see jesus in you for he said the works that i do shall you do also greater than this shall you do because i go to my father is that right that's how the world knows not because that the pentecostal oneness is greater than the pentecostal tunis or the two this is greater than a three this whatever you have not because of method this is greater than a baptism southern baptist taking the prize this year for all the all the baptist churches all the protestants they've got more members this year than and the rest of them i understand by the count that doesn't make them any different god doesn't know you by numbers the heathens got you outnumbered any time the catholics got you all mohammedanism's got all them see you're known when jesus christ lives in you by his life and promised word of this day reflects itself see now the same word that was reflected in moses could not be reflected in elijah because that's another day same one that was reflected in noah could not be in moses because see noah built an ark moses led a people just exactly what was promised the same light was reflected in one was than the other but one told of the other one all the new testament speaks of this hour jesus christ speaks at this hour who is it then some man it's jesus christ the son of god manifesting reflecting the light on the word that he promised for this day when man see you living like him when he sees your character your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested then man will see jesus christ amen they won't have to look around anymore and say what does this creed teach what does that creed teach they'll know what god is when they see you shalom god's peace be like upon you and when god's word is vindicated in this age completely and you see it and believe it shalom to you face the new year with this but as david said i put him always before me because he's on my right hand i shall not be moved if you meet death this year what difference does it make god promise he'd raise you up if an accident kills you what difference does it make you have eternal life i'll raise him up in the last days amen what if anything happens no matter what it is nothing can separate us in the love of god that's in christ hunger peril nakedness no matter what it is nothing can separate us from the love of god that's in christ and he is the word shalom let's bow our heads everybody keep your head now just a moment god's peace gross as it was in the days of noah where they were eating drinking mary and given in marriage aren't about in the whole world of red light so shall it be at the coming of the son of man as it was at sodom where god was manifested in a human being and abraham called elohim the old sufficient one stood there eat meat drinking milk bread and could tell what sarah was thinking behind her behind him in the tent he said that will return again at the coming of the son of man a little while and the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for i will be with you even in you to the end of the world the jews returning to their land the things has taken place it is in this day would prevent from me from halfway beginning to tell you what's taking place but we see it what is it word made manifest what do you think the hebrews did when they seen the word made manifest well the promise they got ready to leave the land if you're not ready today friend start this new year outright start it with your hand in god's hand god's word in your heart said lord jesus i don't know what part of this symphony that you want me to play but when that junction comes for me to be persecuted laugh that made fun of i still take my stand that your sympathy will not be messed up because of me i'll stay right with your word no matter what it is i'll stay right there and when death beats up to my door that's part of the sympathy i know then this assures it beat death up to my door the resurrection will beat out one of these days too and you'll raise me up again it's part of your symphony lord let me be part today will you how many would like to take that vow and say beginning this new year brother branham starting this meeting right now i now promise god to take my stand to never fail to stay right with his promised word and to live just exactly the way he promised it meekness and humility that god might take my life and place it into his great symphony that that same group he'll raise up at the last days i'm gonna raise my hand brother abraham not to you but to god remember me in prayer god bless you everywhere lord bless you my hands is up to you lord take me lord god don't never let me get my mind like judas upon a extra dollar upon some fashion of the world or somebody to pat you on the back and say oh brother brandon this is no no god never let that happen to me i'll just take the way with the lords this pious few i'll be a brother to man do everything that i can lord love people with all my heart but lord never let me move from this word i want to raise up at the last day and only those who are included in this great symphony lord as i have tried to explain it this afternoon that's the one that comes forth at the end of the of the sheep music on the great resurrection and all the angels clap their hands and the saints go marching in it's those who's acted out that part in this great drama we pray pray lord we know that in a drama they change masks they come from one thing to another and that's what you did you come from the spirit god the great jehovah and put on the mask of a human being change your your your strength you changed you pitch your tent you came down from god and become man that you might die to redeem man you change your mass then again you've changed it and you maxed yourself into the people who will believe and act out according to the word that you have written here blessed are the eyes that see him blessed are the hearts that receive it blessed are the ears that hear it for there will come a resurrection when the symphony is over god let us all be there will you bless this little group speaking like this father we know that this tape goes all over the world and here's a fine little group sitting here today this visible audience here in phoenix oh god uh 15 years of hard preaching and scolding it god don't know us the reason love love is is chastening love is is rebuke love is disciplined oh god may i throw myself of this people this week and may you discipline us lord to your word may we see your power raise up the sick and inflicted the eyes of the blind be open the great holy spirit come visible in the room may every minister and every church be on fire may the coming convention of a businessman lord set every businessman hard in this city on fire for god granted lord we don't know what to do about it no more than to ask and believe that it will be done we commit ourselves to you through jesus christ our lord now let us stand to our feet [Music] me [Music] [Music] you
