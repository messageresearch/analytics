on our hearts father oh god may you minister unto every single soul tonight that going forward our lives would never be the same in the name of jesus father come and have your way in jesus name father we pray with thanksgiving amen while we are so standing can we open our bibles to the book of isaiah isaiah 53. isaiah 53 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he have no form of calmliness and when he shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hit as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he have borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we deem we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed praise be to god shall we be seated good to see you saints and god bless you all for coming it's always a joy to be in the house of the lord we know it is not easy um and we don't expect it to be easy yes it's a very difficult moment we are living in and when we make it to come to service i just want to encourage ourselves that we should try as much as we can to make very good use of the time um we don't come to service just to do it i mean to do a head count we come with expectations on our house and if you come expecting god will surely bless you there is no doubt about it there are no two ways about it so when you come i know you know sometimes you come to church and um sadly you see people just sleeping um i i just don't know how that works yeah i don't know how it works because the bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so by you feeding listening to the word of god you are feeding on the word and how can a man be eating and sleeping at the same time i haven't seen that probably the only time i came across something very close was when somebody got drunk and the food was before him and he will go take food and then he'll miss the soup and the food goes on the table and then you put it in his mouth sleep is a good thing don't get me wrong sleep is a good thing as we said during the prayer series if you are not getting sleep when you have gone to work and you have come back from work and you are tired if you are not getting sleep it's time to pray but if you come to the house of god to come and sleep that is a very dangerous place to sleep because as people sit and they are listening to the word and they are receiving from god demons are being cast out you could be an easy target praise be to god so sleeping in the house of god is no good thing and if you are sleeping it's okay to feel sleepy in the house of god but fight it if you have to get up and stand get up and stand praise be to god by the grace of god this morning i mean tonight yeah it's like my time zone is reversed we are going to look at to whom is the arm of the lord revealed a message the prophet preached and i'm drawing my inspiration from this tonight the scripture we just read there was something that caught my attention so much and i've been a man who loves farming as you all know by now who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed he shall he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a tender plant i spent a lot of time just looking at this as a tender plant now when a farmer finds a piece of land to grow his crops he doesn't just go and in the midst of the bushes and the trees he starts planting if any farmer does that that means there's a problem with that farmer what he does he goes there and what the first things he will do he goes and he starts cutting down the trees just imagine that the head has a voice to speak and then it is covered by these bushes by this wrist and someone goes there with a power soul and you know how noisy that power source is and then he enters that forest and then he puts it on and he begins to cast it cuts down the trees imagine how the land is going to complain who is here to disturb my quiet this person is disturbing my peace and then the chainsaw is just going on and cutting down the trees and then the farmer goes and then he gets a bulldozer and then he comes and then he begins to push down the trees imagine her complain how the heart the land would be complaining and then he approves the storms pushes down the trees and after the bulldozer has done its work when that bulldozer is taken off that land it never comes back to that piece of land again but just think of it all the success story on that farmland is going to be attributed to that work the work the bulldozer did but it is never going to come back to that piece of land again because it has finished with its work after it has leveled the hills and it has filled the slopes filled the valleys and uprooted the storms and thrown them away it is taken of the same but the farmer does not end there and at this point i can hear the land complaining oh you have dug a hole in my back you have put a sword in my back oh you have made life miserable for me and i can hear the farmer say just wait until i'm done with you then the farmer goes for the plow and then he starts plowing the land just breaking the land breaking it apart and when he is done that is not the end of the story he goes and he brings the plow he pulls the plow on the back of the tractor and he walks through and what does the plow do the plow breaks that that that land the lumps into pieces and why is the farmer doing all this is because he has a special crop he is coming to put in that sorry praise the lord praise be to god and when he is done yes he takes that peace the plants the seed and he puts it in the soil thank you jesus now just think about it that before the foundation of this world god placed his seed of life in you and you came into this life and you had a lot of whis growing on your earth man is a piece of head on two feet so now we are moving from this natural edge and we are coming to you as a human being you are a piece of earth on two feet and then you grow into this life and you have a lot of bushes a lot of priests that grow in your life and then by the grace of god god sends a prophet your way and he comes and he begins to deal with your life and a lot of the times what do we do when he begins to level the hills in our lives when he begins to feel the slopes in our lives when he begins to cut down the trees when he begins to approve the storms what do we do we complain and we give excuses because we have grown to love those things and they have more or less become our identity but that is not who we really are who we really are is in the inside and the reason why god will send a prophet your way to come and approve those thoughts and to carry on those trees to level the hills and to prepare that earth to prepare that earth is because of that seed of life god has put in you that seed of life must come to life must come alive praise be to god now think about it when the farmer puts the seed in the soil no matter how much the sun bends no matter how much soil covers the seed the seed would lie there the sunshine would never change its dna it will never change the time it is going to spend on this earth it is never going to change this is its productivity everything that plant is going to be is locked up in the seed thank you jesus and when the rain comes down and then the rain begins to fall there is a change of environment in the soil and the seed senses that that something has changed that is why it is not just good to forsake the assembling of the saints any time the church does have open a child of god you must be here a lot of the times we give good reasons why we shouldn't come to church but when those same conditions come and we are supposed to go to work we'll find a way out to make sure we go to work i have seen several numbers now a lot of times you enter your car you want to go to work you hit the road and the car would make a 180 degree tank because the roads are slippery the car doesn't want to go to work but what do you do you force it to go to work sometimes you enter the ditch you will get out and you will go to work anyhow even though you are going to get laid get work late you still go to work but when it rains a little or when it's not a little the first thing we do we come out and we look at the driveway how much snow is on the driveway it's a good excuse not to go to church today you know technology has made things easy for us and it can be a setback if god does not help you it's a good thing if you cannot come to church to stay in the house and follow the service online it's a good thing when you are working and you can't make it it's a good thing it becomes a good resource but when you choose not to come to church because you can sit home and follow service that becomes a bad thing staying in the house and following service in the house is not a substitute to come into the house of god when we come together and we sing songs of praise and we sit and we hear the word of god preach there is an atmosphere that is created and it is the atmosphere that brings the results you sit down and you hear the word of god and things are happening and you don't even know it praise be to god but tell me that when you sit in your house probably with a bowl of ice cream and you cross your leg and you relax in the couch and you're following the service how do you get blessed i don't want to go too much into that but do not use technology as a substitute when the church does are open a child of god we expect you to be here if you are sick and you can make it that is different if you are working we are not asking you to leave your work and come here because if they suck you we cannot help you we expect you to go to work but if you can make it don't sit down because you can sit down and follow service i don't know how that helps praise be to god so when it rains the seed realizes that something has changed the atmosphere has changed it is the atmosphere that brings the result and the seed now dies for that seed to live the seed has to die for that seed to live the seed has to die and the bible says except you are born again there is no way you can understand the kingdom of god you must be born again of the spirit of god it's a must it is the illness of the resurrection there are no two ways about it you must get it or you must get it praise be to god you must die to your natural self a lot of the times we don't die enough we are half dead and we are half a life and that is how we don't see the power of god and sometimes actually we are in coma and come up to the natural eye in fact when there is a dead man lying down and there is somebody in coma to their natural eye they are both dead sure you can't tell it takes an instrument to tell that oh this one is in coma there is still life here and this one is actually dead and sometimes we are in coma and we think we are dead make your calling an election show this is not time to play church it's a very dangerous moment we are living in that the bible says if it were possible the very elect of god will be deceived because the two spirits are so close together that it takes the grace of god yes praise the lord thank you jesus sir it is no time to play church set yourself make sure that your work with god is locked in and that the devil is locked out thank you jesus that seed in order to get a life it has to die and then this plant dies and then it begins to grow looks very very delicate very delicate and depending on what light it is sometimes the farmer has to give it a support would have to come and take it to make sure it does not fall god giving extra grace to his children to help them to stand until they are able to stand on their feet and this plan begins to grow and then the farmer comes and oh these plants are showing up maybe it's a farm let's just use corn the corn is growing looks so nice then the farmer comes when the weeds are growing he comes with this hole and then he whisks he takes the wheels off here in america i don't think you know what i'm talking about when i talk of hoes here everything is technology technologically advanced praise god you can send your drugs to go and spray the farm you control the wheats when the farmer goes and he looks at the crops and they are yellowing he knows it he can just see it from the list that they need help and then he goes he puts fertilizer when they need water he goes some have whales on their farms others are just by the rivers or the lakes they can just water it and what is the farmer doing trying to sustain the crops give them everything they need to succeed so they have no complaint why they shouldn't do well right now the farmer would give the land water but the water the farmer is giving to the land is actually for the crops when the farmer is going to give fertilizer to the crops he comes and he puts it on the soil but it is not meant for the soil the farmer is not interested in the soil he is interested in the crops when there are whis and the farmer comes and he is taking the whis he is not interested in how nice he wants the land to be no he wants to keep the whis away from the cross god in this life god is going to shower a lot of blessings on us that when we are hungry he will put food on the table now when we are sick he will heal us that when we are in bondage he will deliver us when we are in trouble he will visit us when we find ourselves in any condition god is there to see us through but god is not interested in this earth god is interested in your real you and that is why god is showing his blessings on the earth god would do anything for the sake of his elect and these crops grow and then they bury now it is the same seed the same dna the same variety that is planted on the same soil but they are never going to grow to yield the same a farmer when you go to your corn farm you will see some of the corn that the cups very big and long some are short some are very very small but they're very small one and a very big one they are the same at harvests when the farmer comes to harvest he is looking for the original seed the seed that went into the soil there is a seed he is looking for to harvest yes thank you jesus so he is looking for the original so it doesn't really matter whether the cop is is is is bearing i mean has thousands thousand seats on this and another one has maybe 10 seed no the farmer is not interested in that the farmer goes in he picks every single one of them every single one of them he doesn't leave anything behind if it is hundred he picks it every thousand he picks it if it is ten he picks it why because it is carrying the original seed the sea that went into the soil thank you anything you find yourself doing for god you know sometimes we have the tendency to rate our services to god that we can we say this is the highest this is second this stage and we got to a point and we say oh no this doesn't really matter anything you find yourself doing for god do it with your whole heart if you find yourself on the instruments where is this the piano where is the tire what that is the uh how did they call it the violin i love it so much what is the drum i hope i've not left anything out and if you can't play anything here you can clap and you can sing [Applause] yes before any of these instruments we heard this praise be to god they have never failed they are working wonders praise be to god amen whatever you find yourself doing do it to the best and know that you are doing it for god not to be sin of man you are doing it for the love of god it doesn't matter how small it is god values it as much as he would value whatever victim it is do not compare yourself one to another when we do the bible says we are not wise whatever it is that god has given you use it do not desire to be like another person because you will never hit your potential the farmer goes in at harvest time and all he is looking for is the seed that he put in the soil the bible says do not be deceived god is not mocked whatsoever a muslim that shall he reap as a matter of fact you a farmer if you sowed corn and you went and they went and met watermelon would you harvest it the sort of speed you run to the highway only god knows so whatever seed god has planted that is the seed he is coming for to whom is the arm of the lord revealed who has believed our report this was the prophet isaiah who was crying who has believed our report he was a prophet the murphys of god god's messenger what report was he talking about the word of god who has believed our reports to whom is the hour of the lord revealed thank you jesus whatever seed god has sown that is the seed god is coming for praise be to god and before the foundation of the world the seed god sold was of himself and god is not going to come and harvest anything that is not of him it must be the word the word on two feet it must be the word on the word precept upon precept yes any other thing would not work it must be exactly the same god is coming for must dovetail it must dovetail with who god is it must be a part of him anything less would not work and brother brother gave a very very wonderful story here beautiful story and i would like to read it and then we look at it thank you jesus in the old days when a contract was made you know what they did notice god just telling me to say this i don't know a person would go and write a contract on a piece of paper they'll write the contract and then on the contract they are right what it was they was going to do then they had teared the paper into two and they would kill a beast and over this beast tore the contract they would give one person one and one part the passing the other and when they come together when this agreement was brought together that had to be exactly the same piece of paper cut through the letters and had to dovetail just exactly that's right with that or the contract was no good that's right see the agreement was no good i believe these are a brother one there's a lot of anointing in this order praise be to god yes wherever the corona came and met as the current of go and leave us we are children of god praise be to god yes the same piece of paper that was thrown away had to come right back to dovetail in with the order like that to make it perfect and then as they are pledge they killed a beast when they made their pledge now god made a contract with the peoples of this world therefore he sent his son he sent the son of god and killed him on calvary you believe that amen all rely sheep have gone astray god laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities that the statement of our peace was upon him which is stripes we are healed that was god's contract to the church is that right then god killed the lamb at calvary do you believe and from him he tore his he tore him apart he took part of it the body up into glory set it on the right hand of the majesty you believe it the holy spirit he is sent back to the people is that right then when it comes together when this contract is come together at that day of judgment the same holy spirit that fell on the day of pentecost is grouping around a bunch of people till go right back to that same body to dovetail right into that same body is a contract so therefore the spirit that was in that day is here today the same signs wonders miracles are being performed the same people are believing in the same manner praise be to god and the prophet of god said now the first thing you must do is surrender yourself entirely to christ and surrender your mind to him to his word lord i won't act upon my own feelings upon my own thoughts i will only act upon your word i will have no control of my own thoughts concerning it i will act according to your word now get it straight praise be to god the prophet of god talking about this contract to tell you the seriousness of the contract that a beast had to be killed and the pilots to the contract had to stand over the dead body of that beast to make their agreement to take their off and what were they saying that if i do not keep my sight of the contract i should be like this beast but so long as i keep my side of the contract and you keep your side of the contract there is no cause to shed blood because a blood has been shared already yes thank you jesus praise be to god thank you and the power of god said that god has a contract with his church thank you jesus the church is the body of christ christ is the head of the church now as the power of god said that the contract was turned into two and each party was keeping aside a part of it the church is keeping one side of the contract and the head is keeping one side of the contract so there is no way that the contract can ever be complete without the two sides coming back together and when they come back together the texture of the paper must be the same the size of the paper must be the same the color of the paper must be the same the print must be the same and when they are brought together the worst and the letters must tally together thank you lord praise be to god the church is the body of christ without the head the body is incomplete christ is the head of the church and without the body he is incomplete he has one side of the contract the church has the other side of the contract and the holy spirit is here to make sure that we are walking a fine line that we are keeping to the statues that we are obeying the lord's command that we are doing what we are supposed to do as children of god that we are not led by our feelings and by our emotions we are led by the spirit of god for the children of god are led by the spirit of god praise be to god thank you jesus and what is the holy spirit doing the holy spirit is just keeping us in line to make sure that we are keeping our side of the contract praise be to god because he is keeping his side of it yes the problem has always been the church the problem has never been with him because he will do whatever he has promised he will do thank you the problem is always with the church thank you that is why the holy ghost baptism is a must yes if there is anything we ought to be praying for by day and by night crying and seeking god is the holy spirit that when the spirit of god comes into your soul you know that you know that by the grace of god you are saved that when the head comes down to unite with the church if you are the letter b you are going to be you are just going to unite exactly where you're supposed to be yes thank you you are not going to be off to you who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed so it goes hand in hand if you have believed his report then the arm of the lord is revealed in your life jesus if you have believed this report and whose report should we believe brothers and sisters whose report should we believe his report says we are free his report says we are redeemed whosoever the sun shall set free shall be free indeed his report says we are healed by his stress we are healed whose report should we believe

report should we believe whose report are you believing there are a lot of voices that are calling for attention whose report are you believing christ came to die so we should leave he was the lamp that was turned apart when that contract was made to tell you how serious that contract is to keep your side of the contract is life and not to keep your side of the contract is death the lord who have believed our report that is why i don't care anything anybody says about the prophet i don't care what they say he has done his work like the bulldozer he came and he cut on the trees of the nomination there isn't a dogmas and what have you he cut them down i printed the storms level the hills filled the valleys he's done with his weight he is gone the success story of the church depends on what the prophet came to do outside of what the prophet did there is no victory outside of what the prophet did there is no success outside of what prophecy there is no life the success of the church today the victory of the church today depends on what god sent the prophet to come and do he has lived his life i don't care if the bulldozer was working on one leg i don't care whether the color was yellow whether it was green whether it was brown i don't care i don't care whether it was toppled in a valley or it was taken by a crane i don't care what i care about is the work and the foundation that they lead praise be to god thank you jesus i don't read i just don't some i just look at the caption there i don't worry there are a lot of battles i'm fighting i don't want to add to it anything they want to say they are free to say it i am not compelled to believe it make sure you get a hold of god and it's even better when god gets ahold of you because if it is you getting ahold of god to what extent can you hold on you get tired and you want to live but if it is god has taken a hold of you when you are tired and you let go god will say keep you there praise be to god because god is the one that has gotten a hold of you let god get ahold of you praise be to god let them say whatever they want to say let them believe whatever they want to believe but one thing i know that we were predestinated unto this message nobody can tell me otherwise there is no way i can believe it god forbid that after having come this far would she turn our back and if you ever do it something in you would always tell you that this word is the truth nothing but the truth and you will never have any negative thing to say about this message because you know that it is the truth praise be to god we are grateful to the almighty god for what he has done for us that we have found favor in the sight of god yes we are products of grace when i look myself in the mirror i see nothing but grace anything people tell me that way this that i see nothing by the grace of god for by grace i is saved through faith not of works lest any man should boast we are counting on the grace of god and he that has called us would never let us down praise be to god remember that you have one side of the contract and you are duty-bound you are duty-bound to fulfill the terms of the contract because he is duty-bound to do his portion praise the lord and remember that when he comes with his side of the contract it must dovetail with what you have examine your life examine the things you do it's very easy to behave when you're in a public area but when you are alone what are the things you do what are the things you do how do you use your time where do you go you may not walk out of the door and enter your car and go anywhere but you may sit right in your home and you can travel thousands of miles again technology what do you do at your spare time how do you use your life how are you walking
