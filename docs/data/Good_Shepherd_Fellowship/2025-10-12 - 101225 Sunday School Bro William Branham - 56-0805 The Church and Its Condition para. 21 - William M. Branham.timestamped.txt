[5:29] Jehovah
[5:30] was going to represent himself from
[5:32] heaven.
[5:34] He was represented in the most meekst
[5:37] humblest of all the fowls that fly in
[5:40] heaven.
[5:42] That is the dove.
[5:45] There's no channeler bird than the dove.
[5:49] I made quite a study on bird life and on
[5:53] wildlife.
[5:55] And the dove is a very odd bird from any
[6:00] other bird that flies to heaven.
[6:03] The dove is a a a lover.
[6:08] A dove is gentle. And a dove has no
[6:11] gall. It's the only in the bird family
[6:15] that doesn't have a gall.
[6:18] That's the reason you never see a dove
[6:19] anywhere. But around where there's grain
[6:22] and seed.
[6:24] Now the in the ark there was a dove. And
[6:27] the dove is represented in many places
[6:29] in the Bible as symbols of the Holy
[6:32] Spirit. And also the lamb is represented
[6:35] in many places of the Bible as Christ in
[6:38] the revelation all the way back to
[6:41] Genesis. And so is the dove. In the book
[6:44] of Genesis, the dove was in the ark
[6:48] sitting on the roost with the with the
[6:50] rest of the fowls of the air. And one of
[6:53] them was a raven, a crow. And a crow is
[6:56] one of the meanest birds there is. A
[6:59] crow and a J-bird, I guess, is about the
[7:01] meanest birds that we can find. The crow
[7:03] is a very long life bird. And he lives,
[7:07] they are claimed for sometimes two or 30
[7:08] hund years that a crow, a parrot lives
[7:11] longer than that.
[7:14] But a dove is one animal or one bird
[7:17] that doesn't have a gall. Now the crow
[7:20] could sit over here and eat on a dead
[7:22] carcass. You'll never see the dove
[7:25] around that dead carcass. She can't
[7:29] stand it. The stench of it in her nose,
[7:32] she couldn't stand it. It would make her
[7:34] sick.
[7:36] They just simply can't stand anything
[7:39] that's deteriorating, rotten. They can't
[7:42] stand it. So, she couldn't eat it. If
[7:46] she would eat it, it would immediately
[7:48] kill the Because what digested the food
[7:52] is the overflow of the gall into the
[7:56] stomach, which digests the food. And if
[7:58] there's no gall to go in there to make
[8:00] up this, then it would kill the dove.
[8:03] So, you'll always find the dove around
[8:06] where there's something clean,
[8:09] something that's wholesome.
[8:11] Now the crow is different. Now just
[8:15] notice the crow being a type of the
[8:18] hypocrite.
[8:20] The crow can settle there on the on the
[8:24] dead carcass and eat just as much as he
[8:27] wants to and fly right out in the field
[8:30] and eat wheat, too. But the dove can't
[8:33] eat wheat and then fly over on the dead
[8:35] carcass.
[8:37] So a hypocrite, a man can
[8:42] be a hypocrite and both eat spiritual
[8:45] things and good things and bad things.
[8:50] But a real born again Christian cannot
[8:54] tolerate the things that's wrong and
[8:57] only can eat from the good things.
[9:01] Notice that
[9:03] when you see a fellow that can go to the
[9:06] dance,
[9:07] go out and drink, go out and live in
[9:10] sin, come back to the church, and maybe
[9:13] shout just as much as a saint.
[9:18] What it is, he's a scavenger.
[9:22] He can eat both rotten things and good
[9:25] things. But the real Christian cannot
[9:30] tolerate those things anymore. For he's
[9:33] passed from death to life. And
[9:35] immediately would condemn him so the
[9:38] very thoughts of it till it would
[9:40] condemn him that he'd turn his face and
[9:43] walk away.
[9:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a picture. Now the lamb is a
[9:51] very gentle little fella.
[9:55] He doesn't He can't help himself.
[9:59] He isn't self-reliance because he can't
[10:01] help himself. Here's some time ago, I
[10:05] was going through a pastor when I used
[10:06] to patrol and I found a little lamb and
[10:10] all of them had got away from him
[10:12] somehow and is all wound up in a little
[10:15] bunch of bobwire. And a poor little
[10:18] fellow was laying there bleeding and
[10:20] bleeding. And I come by and I see way up
[10:24] about a half a mile up was a whole herd
[10:27] of sheep. Now he laid right there and
[10:29] the crows would have been picking in his
[10:31] eyes pretty soon if we had to got him
[10:34] out. But I unwound the little fell,
[10:37] picked him up in my arms. He never
[10:40] refused. He laid real quiet. I picked
[10:43] him up in my arms. First first time
[10:45] perhaps a human being had ever had their
[10:48] hands on him. But he was gentle.
[10:52] He was willing to be led.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; He was willing to be helped.
[11:00] I hope you see it. He was willing not to
[11:04] try to resist
[11:07] or to kick back or to bite. Lambs don't
[11:11] kick back. They don't bite. They just
[11:14] humble themselves.
[11:17] And this little fella, I packed him up
[11:19] and set him down and the rest of the
[11:22] sheep. And a few minutes his mammy found
[11:24] him. How happy he was. Now, how typical
[11:29] that is of the lamb of God.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; You know where they go to kill sheep.
[11:38] You know what leads the sheep up to the
[11:40] killing block is a goat. But the goat
[11:44] will lead the sheep right up the chute
[11:46] at the slaughter house and then just
[11:48] time he gets a sheep coming up the chute
[11:50] then he'll jump out. But all they say
[11:53] when they're going to kill the goat then
[11:54] he kicks up a stomach. See?
[11:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the devil will do.
[12:00] He'll try to lead God's children right
[12:03] into the meanness,
[12:05] but when it comes time for him to die,
[12:08] he really kicks up a storm. Man,
[12:11] &gt;&gt; that's the way the devil does it. And
[12:13] that's the way sometimes some little
[12:15] fancy looking girl or some little
[12:18] snickler Fritz boy with a pack of
[12:21] cigarettes or a bottle of whiskey would
[12:23] lead a little girl off a lamb of
[12:26] somebody's foe
[12:27] &gt;&gt; off to the wrong.
[12:30] Oh, it's all right. There's nothing all
[12:32] that goody goody stuff about church. But
[12:34] let strike that old boy one time. You
[12:37] heard him squealing and hollering all
[12:39] over the country. And that's the way the
[12:41] devil does it.
[12:44] But a lamb is so gentle that it can be
[12:48] led. And that's the reason that God
[12:52] represented Christ as the lamb and
[12:55] himself as the dove. And on the day that
[13:00] John baptized Jesus,
[13:03] &gt;&gt; at the River of Jordan, one of the
[13:06] greatest events that had ever taken
[13:10] place, taken place right there.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Notice
[13:15] &gt;&gt; how beautiful
[13:17] &gt;&gt; the lamb, the meakest of all the
[13:20] creatures of the earth, and the dove,
[13:25] &gt;&gt; the meakest of all the f of heaven.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the only way that they could
[13:33] ever be united.
[13:35] It's the only way that the dove would
[13:38] ever come on the lamb.
[13:41] Now, when the dove came down,
[13:45] John saw Jesus and he said, "Behold the
[13:49] lamb of God that take away the sins of
[13:52] the world."
[13:54] And John said, "I bear record."
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Seeing the spirit of God like a dove,
[14:02] &gt;&gt; coming down and abiding,
[14:06] &gt;&gt; on him.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; The dove and the lamb united together.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; That's when God and man became one.
[14:20] That's when heaven and earth embraced
[14:22] each other.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; That's when God was made flesh.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; That's when God came down
[14:34] &gt;&gt; from the spirit form.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And was made a man
[14:38] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; That's when all the eternities embraced
[14:45] each other. That's when the human fallen
[14:49] race of Adam's people and Jehovah God
[14:52] and every angel
[14:54] &gt;&gt; come together
[14:56] &gt;&gt; when God and man was made one
[14:59] on that great memorial day when John
[15:03] baptized Jesus.
[15:06] Now what if they would have been a wolf?
[15:10] The sweet couping of the dove would have
[15:14] never been able to stand by the wolf.
[15:16] What is any prettier than late of the
[15:19] evening to hear the old turtle dove sat
[15:22] out there and cool a wild?
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; After I lost my wife and baby,
[15:29] I wouldn't let no one know what I was
[15:31] doing. I used to get my old car. I drive
[15:35] out across the road here, go out here at
[15:38] Walnut Ridge Graveyard,
[15:41] set up there by the side of the tree,
[15:42] and look down at the grave.
[15:45] I just couldn't give them up. Looked
[15:48] like I couldn't stand it anymore. I like
[15:51] my little baby laying there eight months
[15:53] old. How she used to hold her little
[15:56] hands and would reach for me and I'd
[15:59] blow the horn or say something to her
[16:01] and she'd goooo reach her little hands
[16:04] out. I'd sit down on the side of the
[16:06] tree, especially when it would become
[16:09] evening and there used to be an old dove
[16:12] that would sit out there in the bush.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; She would go to C.
[16:17] Oh my,
[16:20] I once wondered if there was an immortal
[16:22] soul of my baby coming back to try to
[16:24] speak to me.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing sweeter than that kooing of the
[16:29] dove. How she's loving. She brings
[16:34] tidings.
[16:36] How she tries to make peace. Get up
[16:39] early in the morning. Go out in the
[16:42] thicket area close to where I live. What
[16:45] a peaceful thing it is to listen.
[16:47] Setting up on their great tall trees,
[16:50] those doves cooing to one another. The
[16:53] other day down at brother Cox's, an old
[16:56] mother dove had two little babies and
[16:58] they sat right up on top of the building
[17:01] so the cats couldn't get them. And the
[17:03] old mother dove would feed them. Then
[17:05] she'd come down and get them and make
[17:07] them get up in the tree. They would sit
[17:09] there with their necks around one
[17:10] another and coup and make love all day
[17:14] long. Two little gentle baby dove.
[17:18] And I thought of how God
[17:21] the dove is such a loving bird. And the
[17:24] dove God wanting to make love with his
[17:27] human beings. God wants to be loved. God
[17:31] wants to love you. Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world,
[17:36] &gt;&gt; he gave his only begotten son.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; That whosoever believeth in him should
[17:41] not perish
[17:42] &gt;&gt; but to have everlasting life.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Then God wanting to make love, he had to
[17:53] some make something lovable.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; He had to make something gentle like
[17:59] himself.
[18:01] He had to make something that could be
[18:03] love. He had to make something of his
[18:06] own nature.
[18:08] You couldn't love nothing that wasn't of
[18:10] your own nature.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Loving has to unite with love. A husband
[18:15] and wife have to love one another if
[18:17] they ever make the grade.
[18:19] Family has to love one another if they
[18:22] ever make the grade.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Something to be loved. You search
[18:27] everywhere finding a girl to be your
[18:30] wife that you love. She searches finding
[18:32] a husband that she can love. God
[18:36] searches trying to find a soul.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; That he can love.
[18:43] So he represented himself here on earth
[18:45] as a gentle dove and a gentle lamb. If
[18:49] at that lamb would at one minute ever
[18:52] taken on the nature of the snarling
[18:54] wolf, that dove would have tuck her
[18:55] flight immediately. She'd have got away.
[18:59] But the the the lamb, it doesn't have
[19:03] any great minds of its own.
[19:07] A lamb is one thing. When it's lost,
[19:10] it's hopelessly lost.
[19:13] A sheep can't find its way back. That's
[19:17] the reason the goat leads it to its
[19:18] death.
[19:20] It can't find its way. A sheep it's
[19:23] lost. That's the reason God likened us
[19:24] unto sheep. When we're lost, we are
[19:28] lost. There's no way we can find
[19:31] ourselves.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to do it. That's
[19:35] submit ourselves to the shepherd of the
[19:38] flock. And he does the leading.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now as I notice this lamb and the
[19:45] sheep together, the lamb and the dove
[19:47] rather together they made one. Then
[19:52] watch how the dove led the lamb, the son
[19:55] of God. How gentle he was knowing that
[20:00] he was going to the slaughter. How
[20:02] gentle he was to always not to try to do
[20:06] himself, not to try to be
[20:09] self-sufficient. He said, "I do nothing
[20:12] until the father shows me first and the
[20:15] father dwells in me."
[20:17] Now another thing the lamb is the lamb
[20:21] is willing to submit its rights. Now God
[20:26] wants us to be lambs. But there's so
[20:29] many times that we don't want to submit
[20:32] our rights.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Farford our rights.
[20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; So many of you say, "Well, I've got
[20:38] rights, brother Brandon." That's true.
[20:40] But are you willing to forfeit your
[20:43] rights?
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to give your rights that
[20:47] God could lead you?
[20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with our
[20:50] churches today in a great majority that
[20:53] the gentleness of the lamb of God are we
[20:57] are supposed to be lambs. We have become
[20:59] everything else but lambs.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason as soon as we get
[21:03] that attitude, the dove of the Holy
[21:06] Spirit takes her flight and leaves.
[21:08] Amen.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; If the lamb of God would have made the
[21:12] first snore like a wolf or would have
[21:14] done anything contrary to what the
[21:16] general dove would have permitted, the
[21:19] dove would have tucker fight.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Should have left in a minute. And that's
[21:24] the reason today that we're wondering
[21:26] what's the matter with the Pentecostal
[21:29] church.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; It's because we have taken on a
[21:32] different nature. We've taken on a
[21:35] nature that we want our rights. We're
[21:38] going to do what we know it's right to
[21:40] do and we become arrogant. We become
[21:44] hostile. We become indifferent. We let
[21:47] temper come in. We let selfishness come
[21:50] in. A lamb when it comes time, he owns
[21:54] his own wool. That's his rights. He owns
[21:57] his wool. But they take the lamb and
[21:59] throw him up on the blocks and tie his
[22:01] seat down. He never kicks. He never
[22:04] fusses. You just take his right away
[22:06] from him because he's a lamb. He can't
[22:10] do nothing else because that's his
[22:11] nature. But one time cross a Christian's
[22:15] path,
[22:16] &gt;&gt; you'll find out whether he's a lamb or a
[22:18] goat,
[22:19] &gt;&gt; you'll find out what he is.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Cross him up one time. And that's the
[22:23] reason today that our churches is in the
[22:26] condition they are. We've called
[22:27] ourselves a lamb of God. The women and
[22:30] the man together has began to act
[22:33] everything but like lambs of God. You
[22:36] look at them going down the street with
[22:38] short bobbed hair, curly cues all in
[22:41] their hair and a few years ago you call
[22:44] you that you couldn't have hired him to
[22:45] do that. And then you wonder why is it
[22:48] the church is in the condition it is is
[22:51] because you tuck the nature of a wolf or
[22:53] a goat instead of keeping the meek
[22:56] gentlest. And you say that's my
[22:58] privilege, brother Brandham. I know it's
[22:59] your privilege. Barbers cut hair and as
[23:01] long as a barber cut hair ain't I got
[23:03] right. That's right. That's your
[23:05] American privilege. But are you willing
[23:07] to give it up to be around?
[23:10] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to submit yourself?
[23:13] &gt;&gt; And you women not long ago you go down
[23:16] the streets. It's ridiculous to look the
[23:18] way the women dress today. And I'm not
[23:21] talking about Presbyterian and
[23:22] Methodist. I'm talking about you
[23:24] holiness women.
[23:26] go down the street and it's I had a
[23:29] little cross hanging in front of my car
[23:31] and somebody said to me said, "Billy,
[23:33] you know that's a Catholic emblem." I
[23:35] said, "When did the Catholics get the
[23:37] option on the cross?"
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Never. That's not emblem of Catholic
[23:41] faith. That's imland of Christian faith.
[23:44] A Catholic faith is a little dead saint,
[23:47] a marrier or some dead person that they
[23:50] worship. We don't worship dead people.
[23:53] We don't worship St. Sicilian, all those
[23:55] different saints. That's Catholicism,
[23:57] which is a high form of spiritualism.
[23:59] But the cross represents him who died
[24:02] and rose again.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; And I said, I keep that there. Looking
[24:05] on the streets 25 years ago or 30 when I
[24:08] was almost blind. I promised God if he'd
[24:11] heal my eyes, I'd look at the right
[24:13] thing. And I said, "Do they ever you
[24:15] look at some ungodly women, halfdressed
[24:18] and naked women laying in the yards
[24:20] there were I look at the cross instead
[24:22] of looking and remember what Christ did
[24:24] for me and turn my head to the thing." I
[24:27] tell the devil.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that are people don't
[24:31] say that's Presbyterian Catholic. That's
[24:33] Pentecostal.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "I got a right to brother
[24:37] Random." That's right. But if he was a
[24:39] lamb, you'd forfeit your rights.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And when you go to acting like that. The
[24:44] Holy Spirit, the gentle dove, takes her
[24:46] flight right away. She won't be
[24:48] disgraced with you.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; You never think you're going to act like
[24:52] that and keep the Holy Ghost. You can't
[24:54] do it.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. You've got to Well,
[24:59] say the rest of the women are doing and
[25:01] you man, you poor little boldest
[25:04] sissified things you that would let your
[25:06] wife do such a thing as that. That shows
[25:08] what you're made out of. That's the
[25:10] reason you ain't got the Holy Ghost like
[25:12] you profess to have or you'd have enough
[25:14] something about you to make her act like
[25:16] a lady as long as she live with you
[25:18] anyhow.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That sounds oldfashioned cutting,
[25:22] but that's what the church needs today

[25:34] &gt;&gt; What a condition the world's got into.
