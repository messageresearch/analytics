amen i just want to inform you that we have somebody that has invaded us from north dakota this morning with a tim narandi brother it's been a long time and you've just come here to prove that the road goes both ways right now i know you're i your your boys are not here are they because i saw a picture of them just recently and one of them's taller than you have to start looking up to him now how time flies and people and children grow right good to have you here good to have each and every one of you here so sister therese go for it okay uh god bless you sense i really want to say thank you to god because sometimes we pray and god answers your prayer you forget and you don't even pay attention to what you prayed for when i got my baby carrying faith the doctor told me that she they heard they saw a let's say a sound to a heart and then he told me that you don't have to worry about it but it's gonna go away and i was kind of like they always you know they may tell you that you won't go away but it may get worse you never know and then i went to god in prayer said lord i don't want to leave the hospital with this sound with my baby having that sound to her heart before i leave the hospital i would like you to close that opening and then have a healthy baby because i know you always give as good gift you never give worse thing and everything like that and then while she was having that issue all the doctors when they come see in the morning they will try everybody will ask you can i listen to your baby's art can i listen to your baby's art i say okay you can listen and then one day one of the doctors came in the morning she said can i listen to your baby's ath i say okay she listens eastern she listen and then she said i didn't hear anything anything to her heart i think she's fine yeah and then after a while i saw those having two doctors again they came can i listen to your baby's hat say okay they listen oh so there is nothing everything is fun now she's fine and then i forget about it i forget that i asked god to heal her ask god to close that opening and i never say thank you till lately i said no i have to thank god for this one and i have to just be thankful to god for what he has done so that's why i'm testifying this morning [Applause] sister cocine if you want to go ahead and come [Music] and i think that's what gorgeous i came from work this morning and in the shower i just started sinking this song and i call i told my husband said this one is on my heart i would like to sing it and uh it's like oh okay call and find out who reading song i don't normally do that but with sister there's um testimony it's just like we all have been blessed and we sit upon it but we always want for god to raise lazarus in our life before we know that we have been blessed now even the cup of water he gave us to drink at the end of the day it's a blessing i have been blessed with many things god's been good to me i have family and friends who share he knows but if i lose at all and i'm left with nothing [Music] if i have the love i know i make it through [Music] he's the only reason he's the only reason you see there's nothing in this world that's worth living for it oh now leaves you empty and longing for more [Music] is the only reason i live [Music] you may have tried a whole lot [Music] but if you look very low you will know that it just cannot be found until you find the love and you know the power of the spirit has sweet holy spirit he'll be the reason to live and he will never never [Music] what a reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] you see there's nothing in this world that's worthless head on there leaves you empty and longing for more [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there hallelujah amen amen thank you sister amen [Music] amen sister carol if you want to come you know this is a song leader's dream it says couple testimonies a song my oh my amen amen just praying this morning that somehow we could just create an atmosphere by getting ourselves out of the way but glorifying his name and certainly our lord jesus amen when he hears his people coming back to give him thanks for what he's done for them oh my god that's pleasing to him so man so sister carol you got a testimony you're gonna sing too i want the congregation to sing all right what's that definitely want to hear everything you have to say this morning yep it's working okay well i told god if he healed me i would testify [Applause] some of you may already know but i was they gave me a test for uh the carrot that to see what the carroted veins were doing because i had a tia and if you don't know that's a very small stroke and so i went to the doctor and they found that the carroted arteries were almost totally blocked and uh with black or whatever you know but uh we asked the church to pray for us here and i want to tell you all thank you for praying because then the next test i had because he told me i needed immediate surgery and i had to go to the surgeon and so we changed doctors we went to this surgeon and he wanted to take his own sonogram so he took that this was after you prayed for me and they found he found there was blood flow and that there was about a fifty percent blockage is all and he said that he he didn't want to operate unless i needed to this is a risky surgery they were cut into your neck and uh cut into your arteries that your carroted arteries the main arteries in your neck and uh scrape them out and that sounds horrible anyway so i did not really want that surgery and so i asked the lord not to have to take that surgery and i appreciate all the the ladies that called me it was very wonderful to hear from you and and it just is such an encouragement to know people love you out there enough to pray for you and the next test i took it was i wes came back for he had to come up here and take care of some things because we could be there half the summer he had some to take care of some things in our home and make sure everything was taken care of while we were gone and so he came back and we he went with me to the appointment and there is one pill that i did not want to take and i wouldn't take it even though the doctors recommended it because of the side effects included diabetes and and possibly [Music] heart failure that's what you're trying to avoid you know possibly liver trouble and kidney trouble and everything you know well i had told them that they asked of course if you've ever had kidney trouble and i told them that one time they told me i had kidney failure and i asked the church here to pray for me and on monday it came up completely normal on the test just after being prayed for on sunday here and i told the doctor that and then when he asked me this one medicine they thought would help you know help to clear it out a little bit up there and he asked me first did you start taking that medicine that you had and i said well i'm sorry i'm kind of independent i i said i didn't feel comfortable to take that medicine so i did not take it i figured i had to be honest and then i think it's a good thing i told him that because he's he said then the next thing he said to us and me was well there was absolutely no evidence of any blockage at all [Music] [Applause] [Music] he's listen you won't be needing me anymore okay i just wanted the church to sing with me this what a lovely name what a lovely name thank you sister carol is that when you had the screaming fit then after that yeah well i did i did start praising the lord right in the doctor's office i couldn't help [Music] what a lovely name the name of jesus [Music] reaching higher parts than the greatest stars [Music] what a lovely name [Music] r saints of every race shall behold his face [Music] foreign jesus reaching higher let the saints a progress name [Applause] [Music] amen what happened to those clogged arteries hallelujah just savor that for a moment saints of god he said he's the god that he lives all of our diseases saints of god and it's his will that we be in good health saints oh my just want to savor that for just a moment hallelujah amen well we're going to go ahead and change the order of the service that brother blatty come and i think brother george will be coming right after him so brother blatty was thinking about going down to um to iowa but he would have missed all these good testimonies so he must have decided he needed to be here so hallelujah so i told us as if he's here there's only one song we can say so you just tell the parson just to come this way work his way down the aisle we'll sing keep f i woke up this morning with my mind stake of i woke up [Music] yes i'm walking and talking i'm walking and talking with

the lord jesus good to see you in the house of the lord this morning praise the lord amen praise the lord we have a few announcements we want to bring to you but before then uh once again we welcome my brother wesley and sister carol we want to thank the lord for touching our sister again praise the lord and we welcome glenn and his family and the different ones with us this morning i think every one year we are all king folks but uh we we greet you all in the name of the lord jesus amen good to have you in the church in the house of the lord this morning brother tim the randy is from north dakota he's with us this morning praise the lord and i think team came all the way from north dakota to personally invite you amen and he says uh you know brother one is it's a bit slow and quiet i don't know whether you'll be able to do a good job i have to make sure that i personally invite the church to the memorial days meeting so by the time you come up we give you the privilege for you to do it amen praise the lord i greet you all in the precious and the holy name of our lord jesus christ i bring uh greetings from my tiny little group in wahpeton north dakota we are very few that sometimes and yet the church we have is so big we rent from our seventh day church which is probably three or four times this size but sometimes they're only four or five people maybe six maybe ten and sometimes i feel like john the baptist a man crying in the wilderness just shouting to nobody but um i bring greetings from them uh brother steven's actually there this morning brother stephen carlon is there he's been supporting us greatly we plan to have memorial day meeting three meetings or four meetings friday the 28th at 7 00 pm saturday at 4 pm and then sunday at 10 in the morning possibly if the lord willing we would like to have like afterwards luncheon for the young people so i would like to extend my special invitation for everyone the young people are welcome the old people are welcome so that yeah so also ask that you pray for the meetings brother uh israel paul is from tucson i think brother blotte knows him very well him and his family are coming up with some members from this church they're about 12 or 15 of them are coming from tucson but the poor has young people also that play music instruments with national accolades so we look forward to inviting everyone to have people come up if you like to attend please let us know either myself or brother steven we do have enough accommodation that you will not have to go into an expense if you want to spend over or stay over more than anything else we just request your prayers that the lord will bless them as we wait for his coming we believe with all our hearts that he's very close to coming just like he said in john chapter 14 verse 3 i go to prepare place and i will come back and get you also in acts chapter 1 verse 11 the same jesus that you see going up will come back again it's not i'm not making it up i told my kids the other day i'm not making this up the lord is coming back again there's a day that is coming that will burn like an oven and all the proud and them that do wickedly shall be as taboo so before that time comes he sent a prophet uh william branham to prepare our hearts not our minds but our hearts may god bless you thank you so much praise the lord amen amen you know our lord jesus make uh seven goals so easy you know because one he paid the price and so you don't have no price to pay you just have to believe in what he have already done praise the lord and then when he said did uh in matthew 16 i'll build my church amen he says i'll build my church and the gifts of hell when that were not prevailed against my church and that church that he was going to build he says wherever two or three you see he makes it so simple wherever two or three he just need two persons and even if it is one he can make the tool and if he can guess two that's all he needs [Music] praise the lord so we want to thank the lord for what is going on there in in north dakota i know i'm indebted to that group but i pray that the law will help me to pay my debts amen we want to also uh uh announce uh our youth meeting coming up uh next sunday we want to talk to the young people next sunday after after service today after service we'll meet with the different group leaders and then the 12th of june we want to do a brother's breakfast meeting we want to we want to we want for irons to shop in ireland a little bit i want to get your brothers into a cycle unless let's let's do the things that we love to do i want for us to talk a little bit brothers breakfast meeting june 12th please write it down if you can forget just like me amen july 4th weekend and just like brother team said memorial day will be wahpington we will not have a memorial day special meetings like we normally do every year because brother team spoke to me about it since last year so we cancelled our meeting to be able to support what they are doing there and like we said if you want to go uh let bra jordan or brother ben knows talk to brother jordan or broadband and for those that will not be able to go because of work also or one reason or another we will still have a provisional year so the church will not be shut down for those that would not be able to go there will be service here on sunday so uh but for those that will be going wiping to an end when you get out brother jordan printed flyers that are being sitting on the table there of the meeting so you can take one get the address put it into your gps see how many hours it will take you so you can know when to leave from here praise the lord amen july 4th we will we would like to have a service on july 4th i thought we will have a meeting on the weekend the third and the fourth but uh uh i think last year uh brother jordan was that last year year before last he did a kind of uh fireworks for the kids you know he did the fireworks for the kids and so we want to have a service that july 4th and then we want to invite every family to bring something to share and we will have a new honor to change we can sit together and be grateful that the lord has brought us through this entire covey situation we can be grateful for what he has done for us throughout the year uh we are hearing that uh uh pretty soon i will our governor might lift the marks and and all of that but we trust in the lord that everything will be done in in safely in time so that's what we have uh june 12th we will be meeting with the brothers it will be right down here at the denny's denny's right not too far from us that's where we will meet 9 00 am 9 00 am i want us to meet so we can be able to have some time from maybe from nine to eleven or nine ten noon but nine a.m will be our meeting time june 12th and then july 4th for those of us that will be around we will have a service here on the fourth and then we will get right back here and have full to eat praise the lord so that's what we have for the announcement this morning and just like uh brother scat said i was i was to go down to iowa yesterday but i forgot that i had a meeting and uh and coupled with with some other few things too that i needed to to pay attention to also i thought that maybe i'll do it another time praise the lord let just stand on our feet let's think that chorus uh uh that uh the musicians are playing he paid a debt he did not own but george would come in and speak to us this morning but we will sing that chorus and then sister grace you will have the privilege to call your husband to the pulpit whichever way you want to do it whether you want to stand here and say honey come and preach or you want to take the vow lane all you want to get on the piano whatever way you want to do it [Music] he paid a debt oh i owe adapt i could not pay i needed someone to watch my sincere wish i can sing a brand new song amazing grace all day long christ jesus pay the debt that i could never pay oh he paid a debt a cavalry he claims my soul he set me free i'm glad that jesus did all my sinners do you believe that oh and now can sing a brand new song i'm missing grace of the lord cry jesus paid a debt that i could never pay one day he's coming oh one day he's coming back for me to live with him eternally it will be glorious i want to see him on that day and then i will say a brand new song amazing grace oh below christ jesus pay the debts that i could never pay [Music] praise the lord the lord bless you sister grace take the privilege to call your husband you know just like i said last week you know uh uh sister grace is from this this is uh her house church home church is there but house church is here whichever way you want to call it and she and her husband are doing missionary work in tennessee praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seed i just want to testify really quick i've been having some issues with my back last couple days and i feel like in the service it's almost completely gone [Applause] this song has just been on my heart and you all know it so feel free to sing along [Music] like the woman at the well i was seeking for things that could not satisfy [Music] but then i heard my savior speaking [Music] draw from my world that never shared i lift [Music] this fast [Music] fill it up [Music] there are millions in this world who are craving the pleasure earthly things but none can match the wondrous [Music] in treasures christ so my brother if the things this world gave you that won't pass away oh my blessed will come and save you if you kneel to him [Music] no [Music] oh let's just raise our house to him and sing it yeah feel my problems come on brother george [Music] um [Music] fill it up sometimes my wife don't approve of everything i do this is probably one of them i was going to turn around like this and say from this position you cannot tell who i am i could be impersonating a asian man i could be impersonating a mexican man a hispanic man a black man i could be impersonating a white man you have no idea who i am you might be able to tell by the accent and and even if i can impersonate a white man i cannot impersonate all white men from this position because some white men are bigger than i am some white men are smaller than i am so i cannot impersonate them so there's only a short range of people i can impersonate from that position i turn around this way i can impersonate a lot some people but less people because you can see from my eye color that i'm not like that person or another person i could take this off and i can impersonate less people but from my actions you still don't know the true me because my actions i can be impersonating christian i could be impersonating a worldly person you do not know and that's a question we need to ask ourselves when we're walking through our daily lives when we're walking through our daily lives at work we're at church or at the store are we putting on something that we are not are we walking after the impersonation of somebody else or are we sincere in what we do that's a question that only we can answer you know brother juan can have confidence in me that i'm a christian but that he does not truly know that he can have confidence that i would say the right thing but he don't know that he can have faith in that and that's the same way between us and the lord you know the new birth is a personal revelation to you individually it's not a revelation to me that you have it the same way the evidence of the holy ghost is accepting the present day word for your day but i don't know that you've done that only you know that you've done that [Music] so uh let's read from ephesians 4 you know what this is one of those sermons where i'm basically just going to go over some fundamentals again and probably preaching to the choir because everybody already knows the fundamentals but sometimes if we're not careful in our position in place sometimes we'll lose focus of where we are and we'll start acting because we got confidence in what we are instead of what we should be at the individual we know from from the group level of who we are from a group level where the virtuous bride of christ without flaw or wrinkle we know from a group level that we are the called of god but from the individual level personally what are we so i you know i i can speak from a position of uh someone who's who ministers or speaks because you know that's what i'm doing right now so we'll look at it even from that that perspective we'll go to ephesians 4 and yeah y'all probably already know where i'm going i'm not going to read the whole chapter but the portions i'm not reading is really more important than the portions i am going to read so whenever you get home you can go back and read over those scriptures and concentrate on those and see what it's really telling you about the position now this right here is uh ephesians 4 maybe i shouldn't give any more details until i get on into it ephesians 4 uh verse 8 through 14. pay attention to the importance of this calling wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high this is christ himself he led captive captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth so he was already ascended then he descended to the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also the descended above of far above all heavens that he might fill all things he's fulfilling all things and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and to the measure of the statue of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind doctrine by the slide of man and a cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive you may be seated see that's that's an important calling it's very important but that calling is for what is for the perfecting of the saints and he gave these gifts to you the church so he gave the gifts to you who's more important who he gave the gifts to or the gifts themselves it's to the church so the gifts are more important or the or the the people he sent the gifts to are more important until we all come into the unity of the faith is for the perfecting so it's to perfect the saints to perfect them to bring them to fully equip them to bring them to maturity okay we'll just uh read a quote here and it says what's the most important thing in the world it's god's church god made the earth he made it for a purpose to take the church out of it abroad that's the most important job in the world so this is the most important job in the world is calling a church out of the world abroad you know it's it's very important and just because this is important that doesn't mean that you can ignore everything else and just concentrate on the importance and forget what you're supposed to be as an individual because we sometimes if we're not careful we'll concentrate on the importance of our task or the importance of the bride and who we are and we'll begin to act like we're exalted above somebody else when we're not we are supposed to be humble before the lord and if we're not careful we'll act out of character and if you go back and read the whole chapter of ephesians 4 it says one of the places in there says work worthy of your vocation and if we're acting holly and better than everybody else then we're not working working walking worthy of our vocation we are exalting ourselves beyond measure and this is something that we should not do now it's important now just because you're humble that doesn't mean that you are thinking less of yourself because in the scripture it says moses was a meekest man upon the face of the whole earth now meek does not mean he's weak he had the most powerful position that there ever existed up to that point he was anything he said in the camp of israel went he had the power but he also had meekness he was the most meek man upon the face of the earth now meek that is that doesn't mean he had no power he had power but it was in control it was in control of the holy spirit now sometimes just because you have power you have the position of authority but if you take that position of authority and you abuse it you take it out of context and you go and force your will on somebody else even though it's not god's will then you're not meek you are not power in control you're not in control by the holy spirit and whenever we get out of the out of the control of the holy spirit and we take things in our own matters and our own hands that's when we cause great damage to the kingdom of god and to our own selves you know there are you know there i mean it's not to diminish who you are because the bride of christ is the most important body in the world and the ministry that's one of the most important jobs but if you take and you get and then you exhaust yourself to a position it that you shouldn't be then you really really are in danger of doing some real terrible things three uh we'll read seventh in the seventh season that's a real powerful ministry it's one of the one of the most important messages in the message is the seventh seal and brother brandon was talking he said now i don't know the next thing would follow this would be the seven trumpets in another message but the seals practically everything is included the church comes down and we place them first which was the most important so see place in the church is most important but at that time now the opening of the seals where the church goes and how it ends up and now i think the heavenly father has certainly been gracious to us for letting us see what we have see that was important it doesn't diminish who you are you can be humble and still recognize your position in the body you can still you don't have to feel defeated and ejected because you're humble you can recognize that you are important and even in the scripture it says blessed are the feet of them that preach the gospel that's in romans so even the feet of those that plus that preach the gospel is beautiful in another place since first timothy chapter 5 and verse 17 it says that the ministry is to receive double honor now we can take that out of context and we can claim the ministry is twice as important to everybody else but that's not what it says it says double honor and if you go back and read the ain't going to go into it but if you go back and read the context you can understand more clearly what it's talking about because it's talking about the the charity versus those who's actually working so let's uh read uh and uh you have to forgive me sometimes if i talk on a subject it's kind of tight it kind of gets me a little nervous you don't know how people's gonna take it you know you you know we're the people of the whole book you know we we eat the whole book and it's impossible for one sermon at least it has been for me so far is to take and take the whole book and preached a whole book in one sermon so you're going to have to have to take either one portion or another and elaborate on that and then on another time there you're going to have to pick up the other pieces of the book because we don't want to be a partial per people who take a partial portion of the scripture and isolate that partial portion and just go to seed on that because if we do that we'll miss the other part and we're not supposed to do that we're supposed to take the whole book and eat the whole book and consume the whole book so just because one person is is dedicating an emphasis on one portion of the scripture in that service that does not mean he's rejecting another part of the service or another part of the scripture the whole scripture is important and we know that the and just from ephesians 4 there we know that the ministry one of the purposes they have was for the perfection of the saints we'll read in questions and answers now these questions and answers was in relation to the feast of the trumpets in 1964. this person asked the question he said dearly beloved let's see about the scripture of ephesians 4 11-13 do we all do we get all the perfecting of the saint of the saints through the tapes or shall we be here where the gifts of the spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts our hearts have believed all the word of the lord these are same sincere people they are believing the word with all of their hearts they are but they have an earnest question they say do the do the ministry perfect the saints or do we only get that through the tapes does the taste what perfect us and brother branham went down there he recognized who it was and he seen it was a sincere person then he answered a question and his answer was no they come here to the church for the perfecting see that no they want to come here to the church for the perfecting see that we get the fellowship one from another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and god the blood of christ is what perfects us is in the holy spirit so it's the blood of christ that perfects us but in the scripture it says these gifts were given for the perfecting of the saints now some people who don't understand the bible or the message they'll see something like this and they say well i gotta reject what the prophet said because the prophet can't read can't contradict the bible so i'm only gonna take the bible so i'm gonna throw out what he says if you do that you're not really understanding what the bible says and you're not understanding what the prophet is saying okay so you got to take all the word the whole book not just a portion of the book that you like take the whole book and if you don't understand it that's fine that's good i mean you don't have to understand all the word but you do not reject it because when you reject it you will never understand it because you'll know go back never go back to revisit what you don't understand if you go back and visit something you don't understand maybe it wasn't your time to gain that understanding from the lord or catch that revelation at that time but later on down the road whenever you matured a little more or whenever those around you matured a little more then maybe it's become that proper time and season for you to get that revelation and then you can walk further in the faith of god it's not that in our own strength we're doing these things because if we do this in our own strength and we understand these things in our own intellect then that has no value either because then we're just doing it within our own strengths i mean i can still well i should seriously still i can borrow what brother juan said last weekend about the mother sometimes a mother's prayer can do more good than a preacher's sermon over the pulpit that can happen and there's instances of that even even the woman in memphis whenever she was praying for her son which was lost and wayward and she had he came down with a disease of a neural disease and he he was out hey it wasn't that he wasn't raised in a christian home you remember the story she said she prayed to the lord to give her a son and he answered her prayer so whenever he was a child a baby before he was even born his mother was a christian she believed the word and even during that time even a mother she she's doing all she can or father doing all he can to break up his children in the way of the lord and sometimes they get influenced by the wrong influence of their friends and they go do things which they will later regret because they think at that stage you know and in the adolescence they think they know more than everybody else so they don't want to listen and then they go get a bunch of scars and then years later they they they might not say it out vocally but years later within themselves they say i wish i would have listened to mother because she had a lot of experience that i didn't think she had and then they would have been protected from a lot of stuff i mean we can learn from mistakes we can either learn from our own mistakes or others mistakes if we see other people do things and they hurt themselves why would we want to go repeat that same mistake we don't have to now you can say well that's only a story that we heard that's not scriptural but can you say that because in the scripture judah did the same thing judah was hey we got what we got the father of abraham isaac and jacob and then jacob was the father of judah so he had a good lineage he had a good family that taught the truth all through his upbringing but he came to a place where it says in the scriptures he got around friends and whenever he got around to friends he went around and he started dating canaanite women he made a wrong decision and as a result of his wrong decision against his family's prayers it cost the lives of two of his sons and his wife died too and and we know from other other sermons from other people that the devil was doing everything he can to attack outlandish to keep jesus christ from coming forth because the scripture says from the line of the tribe of judah that will come to pass and we we see that somebody else had to step in which looked contrary to everybody else's opinion if it was right or wrong and she went and did it anyway because she was moved by the holy spirit because what is the most important thing in our lives is fulfilling the word of god and even though others might think when we're fulfilling the word of god that we're doing wrong or they think that we're a jonah because we went that way and the word says go this way we went that way anyway and we wind up find out later because it's a permissive will of god he will yank that permissive will back to his perfect will and jonah had to go exactly where he was predestined to go in order to step out of the mouth of the well to convert those people in nineveh we think that what we do sometimes is not correct even in our own eyes because we want to run away but when we're running away we're running straight to god how can you run from somebody that is in you what was it solomon one of them that said that he said i i tried to get away from god i was in the hell and i was looking god was with me i was here and god was with me he's going with you everywhere you are because he is in you praise the lord okay let's uh look at the uh importance again you know a lot of you know the seals are important we know the seals are important we know it is it says the greatest this right here is before the seals he said the greatest thing i preached that message up from here to on one time the lamb and the dove it's the greatest message i ever was given to me of the lord when god represented himself he represented himself from heaven a bird the meekest of all the birds the dove and god in the holy ghost is a self same person so that right there was one of the most important things you know the seals you know it tells us doctrine it tells us who we are it tells us our placing but here is talking about the nature of the individual himself is talking about the individual it's a one-on-one relationship between you and christ that is that was why he said it was one of the most important things one of them might be facts one of them might be revelation one of them might be this but one of them is who you are exactly yourself if you are not in the correct position yourself then you're not going to be able to receive the doctrine you're not going to be able to receive the revelation because you're not going to be in the correct atmosphere or the right spirit in order to receive the word so it's more important that you humble yourself and get on a wonder relationship with god instead of trying to figure out all this other stuff because everybody else is preaching on the eye stuff that's good but until you're humble what does one of the songs say the more i i lower myself down the more he can lift me up it is him that's lifting it up it's not us lifting ourselves up as god is lifting us up well let's go to uh one after the seals this is uh he mentions this in desperations but the sermon he's talking about is a token once again this is talking about the nature that's in you being changed because the nature in you is more important who is more important something external from you or something that's internal to you jesus said one time it ain't the it ain't the uh food that goes in your belly that tells who the person is it's the words that comes out of your mouth it tells who you are that tells who you're clean or clean or unclean said this this morning the message this morning was to me the highlight message of my entire ministry this morning see the highlight message of my entire ministry someday i'll tell you how it came about and i know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving to come to that place that was the capping off time of it you see see he's talking about the token and what is the token that's that's a that's the relationship between you and christ that's you having your old desires die and go away and you take an empath on the desires of christ if you don't have the relationship with christ it doesn't matter what position you are in it will do you no good you can be as high as you want to you can be the president of the united states and if you ain't got that one-on-one relationship with jesus christ you're not gonna go on a rapture it's not gonna happen this is this is a we'll read a another quote here it says now i know you got to go to work in the morning your job is important your job's important even the ministry is important that job is important most important job your children is waiting on you your children is important your babysitter says she'll leave at a certain time okay to get this who's more important you paid a babysitter who's more important the babysitter or the baby baby okay god gave you a gift who's more important you are the gift and if you are a child of god and god gave you a gift to perfect you is it that gift perfecting you or is it god using the gift to perfect you [Music] you know he can use any instrument that he wants to use to perfect you because god is concerned about you he can use an evangelist for that purpose he can use a pastor for that purpose he can use an apostle for that purpose he can use a teacher he can use any gift he wants to and if you reject those and if you are a disobedient child sometimes he will leave the ninety and nine and he will go and find you and he might use a different tool he might not use the ministry he could use the prayers of a mother that was brought out last weekend he can use any gift he wants because you are his child and if you are his child he wants you to come back home to him [Applause] that does not annoy the gifts that he gave that does not do away with the five-fold ministry it does not they are important but what's more important is what he's using them to accomplish so if a man exalts himself and asserts himself as if it's him that's doing it then he could be causing harm to god's child you know you are in the hand of the lord even in revelation he said he had the stars in his hands he was in his hand and if you're not in his hand you're doing it on your own will are you accomplishing what he wants you to accomplish this right here is talking about the uh the token this is in the token message he says every man no matter if he was his loyal man he might have been a pharaoh of egypt he was the most important man of the day but the token had to be applied to him no matter how important he was whether he's a bishop a priest whatever president king potentate monarch had nothing to do with it god only recognized the covenanted covenanted people same thing today the holy spirit will only recognize the covenant people so you you know you think i'll come to church here that's all i got to do what's going to happen if this church goes away one day where are you going to be then you know in the sales brother brown said that he believed the rapture would be will come in what three minutes you know you can look at that in prophetic time but what if that was literal minutes what would you do then because you know as well as i do that brother juan being a god called minister and a god called a pastor would he be here three minutes after after now if the rapture is going to come in three minutes what about four minutes from now what are you going to do now you got all your hope and all your your prestige and all your honor resting upon brother juan but if you haven't been applying what brother juan has been telling you over the years in your life and you haven't been saying lord humble me down so i can really receive your word not just receiving what a man says but what you're saying through that man then where are you going to be in four minutes you're still going to be here trying to defend the flesh are you going to be receiving what god spoke through that flesh in order to get you to come to him what's more important notice the the highest heavens you know if we we get to a position and god can't use us because we think we're so important and god's got to have us you know sometimes we we do that we get our eyes on the wrong thing we know that the ministry is important it's the highest calling in the in the land we know that but if we get our attentions on satan's eating instead of god's eating we'll say well the ministry we we don't get paid a lot of money we don't we're we're not the richest people in the world and we get our eyes we're the most important ministry and look at all these sports stars they're making millions see if we do that we'll lose our focus and we will not be doing our our calling because we got our mind on the wrong thing and if you do that you're on the way down and you're not going to be benefiting the people so what what happens in a situation like this it says notice the highest heavens hastening to honors god's earth the most humble and unlearned the highest of heaven came down to make himself known to the lowest of earth bypassing between to make himself known to common herdsmen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all times there had been many great messengers we would think of it and noah's day the prophets and the great priests and so forth had been in the days gone by great learn man kings potentates monarchs but here comes with the greatest of all messages what was the message the messiah is here and to make that known he bypassed all the train to do to make it known to humble shepherds think of it all the clergymen all the churchmen all the teachers all the theological training all the money had been spent all the churches the doctrines the denominations was all bypassed all the learning they had spent on all the missionaries the proselyting the membership everything they had thought they had done to honor god yet the key message of all of it was bypassed from them strange why why was that the case why why throughout the prophet's ministry whenever he he he was doing discernment and god was healing through his ministry why did he reach down to heal a little fish god is sovereign he can do anything he wants to when i'm even thinking of a situation where brother branham was was prayed for a lady and she was healed and then and then later on in the hospital she told her mother said mother i'm going home and uh her mother said i know you're going home you're going to go home after they dismiss you from the hospital she said no mother i'm going to my heavenly home and she passed away and went went with the lord and the prophet this right here is an important person he had an important ministry he got he he thought he got the wrong attitude and he said god you owe me an explanation god don't owe us nothing and he the prophet said god let him paddle around for a few days until he got humbled down and then the lord could come back and tell him the reason why he took her was because her time was before them but she wasn't right with the lord and what was more important was that she would be right with the lord than if she was here or there isn't that merciful whenever even in our our position whenever sometimes we're in the wrong and we should have died then but because our heart wasn't right we hadn't given ourselves to the lord we still hadn't received his new birth yet or we still hadn't accepted his salvation he postponed our death and said okay i'm going to give you a few more years until you get right and then whenever we get right that lady wasn't angry because she had to die that lady was happy what she realized what was more important wasn't that she could live here and get famous and and celebrate and have a bunch of parties her realization was that she could be with the lord where is our desires is our desire to be more popular to get more celebrations to be the most important person or is our desires to be fulfilling his word fulfilling his desires i can't get away from this microphone can i well you know the most important person of all time is jesus christ he knocks at your door and he gets turned away more than all the kings and potentially ever was you accept him you go out on the street and you say something about the outside world and they'll laugh in your face would you come who would come to your house any greater than jesus christ who would knock at your door greater than jesus christ who would do that the son of god could knock at your house who would be more important yet he knocks day after day and even if if you accept him you're called a fanatic you see the world knows it's on that's right but now he wouldn't come unless he had a reason to come you know you reject him he'll come again he'll knock you in he's coming for a reason he's coming because you are his own and he's trying to get you to respond to him it's not because you're not important you are important to him that's why he's coming that's why he's knocking on your door that's why he's saying respond to me come and accept me i will come into you and you can come into me and we'll have our abode together but if we get get out of out of shape we'll find out that king did this did now we find that this king old did like so many christians today he as long as he stayed humble then god blessed him but the bible said here that he got lifted up when he got everything secured then he became lifted up in his own self and then he was on his road out now that's so it is today with churches it's always been and when men feel that they have become sufficient they don't have to pray anymore they don't have to wait on god for their ministry your pardon the expression this has a backstory am i going to go into the backstory either i agree i agree with a certain writer that that's what has caused many of these men that's been in these latter day revivals or last day revival to fly to pieces some of them found they've been claimed to be drunk in the pulpit and some of them has done wrong so they are this right here was in the prophet's ministry one of the healing revivals was in full swing and they was preaching all over the country and it was it was people responding it was they was jumping and shouting all over the congregation it was really on fire and yet the ministry was found drunk in the pulpit you think i asked real bad but you can take that sin out and plug in another sin and it's just as bad you take the sin of drunkenness out you plug in the sin of watching worldly movies and tvs and all that stuff you can do that too it's the same thing i mean it says don't put any evil thing before your eye you can do that i mean i mean what's the difference one sin is bad as another sin you're saying that you're humbling and you feel sufficient you don't pray that's that's that's where he messed up right there is he quit praying and when he quit praying he wasn't humble and he thought he could get away with something because he thought he could keep it head and even if he thought he could was found out he thought the people wouldn't mind because they they loved him because he was so popular i mean it ain't got to be a obvious scent it can be like being greedy and hoarding on the money or whatever it can be any sin people they got the people sowing their grip that they can just do anything they want to and the people doesn't notice it but god notices it see that's the one i might say like nebuchadnezzar one day he walked out and said look what a great kingdom i have built and then the angel of the lord smote him so he could be the most powerful king of all that region the whole powerful king he was more powerful than anybody and he thought he did it within itself and it wasn't him that did it it was the lord trying to teach his children something and he lost the focus of what god was doing he thought it was him doing it himself and god smote him for it so just because we got an important position and we're an important people we shouldn't lose focus of the individual walk and if we do even though we've got a position that's important look at what it could lead to if we lose focus of our humility this is in the uh the sixth cell he said look there they crucified him pay attention to this the bible said that's the four greatest words there jerusalem the most holy city in the world most holy city you know is it just you know even in the scripture where it says they prayed and cried for the abominations in the city it doesn't mean they're praying and crying for the abominations out in the desert where they have no life it was in this city that's in the message that's in the truth that's where the truth is that's where life is is in the city the the jerusalem the most holy city in the world the most holy people in the world crucified the most brutal death in the world him the most important person in the world the person that he claimed to be worshiping and praising and all this there was the weary ones it was killing him so if you lose the focus of the personal walk and only look at the group overall picture we could be crucifying the very one we're claiming to worship and if you look at the uh well oh well now here's what it is we see there was two most important people that was the wrong way to do what they did then this is the correct way to do it there was two important people on the earth there was john the prophet and there was jesus the messiah they two men had the message of the day they met face to face in the water with their eyes caught one another and john in humility did say i have need to be baptized of thee why thou cometh unto me see john didn't understand but he still want to fulfill the word of the lord whenever we don't understand we still want to fulfill the word of the lord jesus says suffer it to be so that is right but thus it behooveth us or is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness why am i god jesus being god john being a prophet quickly jesus knowed what he said that john being a prophet to who the word came to know that he would understand it because the sacrifice according to the law had to be washed before it was presented and jesus had to be baptized before presented he said suffer to be so that's right for thus it behooveth us to fulfill all righteousness see we don't understand sometimes but we are still supposed to obey the word you know i was speaking with with one person one time and and i was telling him what the prophet said on a certain matter and he said well this urban legend over here says something different so i'm going to believe the urban legend sometimes you know you hear people preach against the urban legends all the time urban legends all the time is all bad and all bad and they only want to take what the tape said but if you find something to tape say that they don't want to agree with then all of a sudden they want to take the urban legend that's not what we should do take both of them and if they don't jive together that means you don't understand them yeah but if they jive together then you can understand it better you see but some sometimes the urban legend ain't even ain't even in the message or anything it's just somebody's personal opinion you know like flying around on an airplane that's an opinion you can tell the difference between an opinion and what actually happened i mean somebody comes and says brother brandon told them something yeah you can you can accept that and my brother adam told him that but if you look at what they're saying they never never told them about an airplane never one time that's their opinion but if they can you can get the testimony and you get the word and you get the message and line them all up then you might have a little bit better understanding of what man say it you don't reject it just because you like the urban legend better you do the tapes you don't reject the taste because you like the urban legends you don't reject the urban legend because you like the taste it might be both of them are right and they might be you don't understand either one of them just like the bible and the message people look at the message says the messages contradict the bible the bible contradicts the message that's because they don't understand either one of them uh we'll find out if how how important we are in romans chapter 12 verses one through eight i have a plus there so there's a lot more but i'm not going to read the rest of it it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service now do we think we deserve a whole lot of stuff because this is one of the most important jobs in the world is to call out a bride out of the world it says that's a reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that which is good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given to me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think that you think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith don't think that you're worth nothing you're worth something but then think soberly you know i read every once while they have some kind of a propaganda thing on the screen at work and one of the things that came up it says being humble is not thinking less of yourself but to think of yourself less think more of somebody else for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another having their gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us with a prophecy let us prophesy according to the portion of faith of ministry let us wait on ministering or of teaching on teaching or on exortus or he that exhorts us on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity that he rules with diligence he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness you know we could we could really abuse those scriptures right there you know with with those who show mercy with cheerfulness they say well this guy trespassed me this time but if he does it again i'm really going to get him that's not cheerfulness you know i forgive him this once you know it says you know what if i want you know as i was speaking earlier and i had that mask on i said i can impersonate anybody i want to if i wanted to try to deceive brother juan i could say well brother juan i tell you what samuel he's going to be real happy with me during his service today and isaiah he's going to be real disappointed and i tell him that and then without his knowledge i sneak out of the back room and i hand samuel 20 bill and i slap isaiah on top of the head and sure enough a self-fulfilled prophecy and he said well what he said was right but that is manipulation that's not what we're supposed to be as saints we're not supposed to be manipulating people i had to use somebody that that kind of respected me and wouldn't take offense of what i said you know one brother one brother asked me a question he said where does the king keep his armies he said i don't know and he said it in sleeves that's why i didn't pick on uh on jordan back here because he got some massive armies you know sometimes it's not the thing that we're doing but it's the concept behind the thing and we find out that brother branham was offered to give to be given a cadillac car in his early ministry and he he turned it down and the reason why he turned it down is more important than why he turned it down more important than him turning it down he said i had a chevrolet truck my phone rings someone wanted to buy me a cadillac car i searched it out and i come down through arkansas men out there in the audience these poor people knew out there with them long cotton sacks on their back picking cotton coming to the prayer line with a little maybe a little corn and bread at supper time and come down to the road do you understand it didn't i didn't come for that friends i come to help you that's what i'm here for is to help you see he could accepted the car and that might not have been a sin but because of the the image it would give to him he couldn't help the people because the people might have thought of him something different and he couldn't help them you know we all grow in grace and wisdom too and even the prophet grows in grace and wisdom and this this next quote here is it shows an example of where he grows in grace and wisdom you know we do things out of good faith but sometimes even though we do it in good faith it's wrong and we don't know what's wrong when we do it but we still do it because we're human and we don't know everything i'm going to read the first part and then the second part is where it really gets into him growing in grace and wisdom says now your contribution this afternoon thank you so much for it the lord bless you brother baxter did a great very nice job of doing that which knows how to do it we don't beg for money never i would never have a manager that would beg for money when come time for our meetings that won't pay out it's time for me to go home we don't want to believe in that we've been amended by many other brethren throughout in the magazines and so forth are keeping the financial part down saying nothing about it we have to have finances to run the meetings that's just common sense you know somebody has to pay the electric bill somebody has to clean the carpet somebody has to do this stuff somebody even has to put the carpet down the carpet didn't come for free you know it ain't like the brothers the church went over to the carpet store or the pa or the audio department over there said well the finances of the church ain't there and since my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills and i think i own at least one i'm gonna take your stuff and i'm gonna go put it in my church it don't work that way i mean these are common sense things we know it takes money to run these things okay i said uh many many times i've dumped the love offering that they give me and to pay for it to pay for the finances see they i took up for the finances of the meetings and then they took up a love offering for him and he said sometimes they do it enough money to pay for the expenses of the meeting so he took the money that they gave him and he put it into the feathering of the meetings it's all into the heart of the person that's dealing with it you know it you know whenever the people give money to the ministry you're supposed to do it out of joyfulness in the ministry in time in in the same kind he's supposed to be in joyfulness whenever he handles it that's what the prophet did in joyfulness he turned it back over to the furtherance of the kingdom all that isn't just exactly what i have to eat the people give me clothes and i don't have to have and that goes right straight to the foreign missions and i know this to be a steward over his welfare it goes to four missions i go myself to take the message that the lord has given me then at that day i know i've done the right thing with god's portion now this is the part where he gets talking into growing in wisdom he found something out by experience sometimes we go into the city and we give it over to different organizations and so forth we couldn't get out of the city till they'll be calling us holy rollers in divine healings and i give it to a certain organization one time i look going down the street in a great big cadillac car a man with a big cigar and diamond rings drawing about six or seven hundred dollars a month just going around to distribute that money so it wasn't even his money it was other people's money that he was distributing and he was cycling off of it to get this big huge salary now the dollar portion is important what's important was his intent because if you look at up in the inflation calculator that goes up to about six to seven thousand dollars a month see it's not the money it's what he was doing with it it wasn't even his money but he was taking it and hoarding a huge portion to himself just like judas was in in the bible he was hoarding a big huge portion of it to himself and he was giving a little bit away to the to the poor to make himself look good just like i said about slapping one of them on top they hadn't even the other 20. he was trying to manipulate to make people think others other others think of him highly more highly than what he actually was on an individual level who's more important what a man thinks of you or what god knows about you you ain't going to manipulate god you can manipulate me you can manipulate with brother juan you can manipulate anybody you want sometimes sometimes you get caught but you are never going to manipulate god and who's more important [Applause] well that wasn't right the poor little children are starving and hungry i know one thing is brother jackson was saying them little natives back there and so forth never heard the gospel don't know nothing about jesus no it's in my heart to take the gospel to them that's the general orders was to go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature that's what this contribution and everything that i have every penny that i don't have to use to keep my meetings going that goes right till we get through to go enough the fun to go and then we go sweden or wherever the lord would lead see it's not just isolated to one person it's everybody okay so you're not supposed to hoard it to yourself just to make yourself look good to other people and just give a little bit out to help people you're supposed to just do it with the sincerity of your heart you know even when you do the right thing sometimes other people are there to accuse you of being wrong even when you're not even when you do it in the right spirit you do it in the right attitude you're not doing anything wrong but somebody will come up and accuse you of doing something wrong i mean we'll find out whenever the fbi brother branham was talking about these fbi agents was going to come and expose him on a platform one day and they came and these now this right here they had an important job the ministry is an important job it is the highest calling there is most important most important job what the prophet said it was was the ministry but look and see who these people was that was doing this to the prophet it was going and this right here reminds me you know you have people on the outside looking in and they see a portion that they don't understand and then they want to accuse you of being false and wrong i mean even like the fbi agents we know that gene and leo set up a little fbi of their own and they're trying to accuse gina leo being the ones the fbi agents that this this was about but it wasn't if we read down here closely it was a real fbi agent where that was converted it wasn't gina leo they got converted too but they wasn't the ones there was a fake fbi trying to come and investigate them as an investigation just to find out on their own but the fbi themselves came in the meeting and they got converted okay so just because you have one story and it's true that don't mean the other story is not true as well because you can have multiple instances that is true i'm thinking of some testimonies now but you know paul said that all things are expedient but not everything is edifying you know yeah you can tell some testimonies and they're real powerful but if they're going to hurt people that that hate you you don't want to tell it because you don't want to hurt the people that hate you so you can tell testimonies and they might be edifying for yourself alone but you're not supposed to tell them before everybody because you can hurt somebody that that you don't even want to hurt you know if somebody hurts you you don't want to hurt them i mean even if you look in the scripture back whenever jonathan went up and fought the philistines you'll find there was there was people it was in hebrew and they was fighting on the wrong side of the battle there was hebrews fighting with the philistines against the hebrews and whenever they seen the hebrews gaining power and strength and they was going to win they changed size and came back to their own and fought the battle with the hebrews so because a brother is fighting me now that don't mean he's always going to fight me because he's my brother he could repent and come to the witness we read the back of the book we already know we're one in we already know we won the war and we have these people on the outside fighting us there might be some hebrews over fighting not recognizing who they are and you also find back there whenever whenever jonathan was fighting with his armor bearer that there was hebrews hiding in the rocks they weren't fighting for the enemy and they wasn't fighting for the hebrews they were scared to death but whenever they seen god moving the camp in the hebrews winning they came out of the rocks and then they have the hebrews too so there's all kinds of people just because they're fighting you now that don't mean they're your enemy they could be your friends so i mean but what is it brother brandon said that the bride don't persecute bride because bride don't persecute anybody i mean i mean humbleness is not just a word to say it's not false humility it's not i mean you can i can come in and act like i'm humble and i can be the most arrogant person in the world that don't mean i'm humble i can go in there and say that i don't i don't need to repent to anybody because i checked and i've never done anybody wrong you know i'm in a i was spit out on the cloud i floated down the earth i'm perfect and innocent all this stuff it's nonsense just walk like a normal human being you ain't got to brag all the time let's just read the highlights of this these uh fbi people put or these fake fbi people put fliers on all the cars out in the parking lots and said they're going to expose the prophet as a frog and uh one of the managers he got aggravated about his telling brother brown and his frustrations and brother brown said that's all right there's a higher law than the earth here that would take care of that but verily i say unto you whosoever shall speak a word against the holy ghost it will not be forgiven him this world nor the world to come and then he said the manager was just a little mentally upset because you know it will get under your skin if somebody's always persecuting you all the time and sometimes you're human you'll flare up i mean that that is a possibility and that was the case with the manager he flared up because it got underneath the skin brother brown said you're just a little upset just don't let it be that let it be for now and then a sister who was prayed for in the prayer line and got healed and knew that the supernatural was real and true came to came to brother branham and he told her he said don't you worry about that sis i've had fbi meetings two or three times and every time they got converted i said sure i like to have them again i mean when you know where you're standing you ain't gonna be afraid sometimes you can be afraid but you ain't gotta be i'm thinking of a time whenever a woman prophetess came and and and tried to control what brother branham did or said and he went letter and then uh mita got pregnant with one of her kids and the woman prophet issued a prophetess and said that god is going to kill me to punish bill for not listening to her and if you go back and read the tapes media was scared because of it somebody can't cause you fear but that don't mean you're in a wrong and it don't mean that that false prophet is true you got to look at your position in the word brother bran brother bosworth remembers one night in my meeting when the fbi came to seattle washington went out the next day and knelt down in the shooting gallery and said brother branham look how can i receive the type of the holy spirit you got i put my arms around him and led him to christ a year from now he retires he's going to go with me that's right i like to see people come in who's really sincere when you come to christ please be sincere you'll go a lot further with christ you're not going to fool christ as i said earlier you might fool me you might fool somebody else but you're not going to fool christ you might as well be sincere with him whenever you're at home in your closet with god you're between just between you and him you can tell him anything you want you ain't got to worry about him whispering and telling the neighbors he you know a lot of times when people is investigating you they're not doing it to your good i never known anybody investigate me for my own good they always want to do something harm to me but whenever you're dealing with christ you ain't gonna worry about him trying to hurt you everything he does is for your good [Applause] it one day while i was down in texas and a little newspaper went busted later on and carried a dirty article and said i was up there and a whole lot said i received so much money in a meeting that had taken two big men to pack the offer and out of the building which i was nothing but a lie it was somebody trying to accuse somebody just because they didn't like them brother sister this right here is what act what's what happened to another answer he said i have five hundred thousand dollars give to me at one time and refuse to put my name on it and told them to take it back that's right i had 25 000 give to me in one check on the platform at texas where a man from the texas oil owner came there and said my mother was healed out of the wheelchair and they just flew in there and i said sir i tore the check up before him i said that's right i'm a poor man it's not the amount of money it's what you're going to do with it if you don't need it why do you need it i mean i mean you're just going to have an excuse for somebody throw off on you somebody to accuse you of something you're not guilty of i mean it would not be a sin for him to accept that five hundred thousand dollars it would not be a sin for him to accept that twenty five thousand dollars it would not be a sin it wouldn't and it was a sin for that person to lie and say it took two men to take out of the offering when it didn't this man made a great remark and i put money in everything and i was just wrong god dealt with him see god dealt with that person that was doing the false accusation you ain't got to deal with them got to deal with them and this this right here gave another chance for him to get a testimony of a brother that was hit by a stroke and this brother was hit by a stroke and he was paralyzed down one side and his wife had to take care of him and everything and he was going to die and he called brother brown his relatives called brother brown on the phone and they pray for him over the phone and god saved his life where he wouldn't die but he still had the after effects of the stroke and he came up to a prayer line in another meeting and brother branham called the prayer cards from one number to another number and his number would have been the next number and and look at the sincerity of this man and just because you might be sincere person you might misunderstand somebody else who isn't seer is sincere they're sincere and you're sincere but you still might misunderstand them and this is the case where brother branham misunderstood this brother he came to him and told him about the prayer cards oh let me find it and uh he said if i could only got to the line and brother brown said well brother reed that wouldn't have healed you brother he said no brother branham but i want to know what i've done if i've done anything god knows i'm sorry for it he said why should i have to go like this through life now i'm glad to be living holding like that the boy trying to hold him and his wife like that see he was just wanting to know what he did wrong so he could make it right it wasn't that he was trying to use brother brown as a ouija board and that's what brother brown misunderstood him was trying to do he said that right there ain't gonna be that's not the key the key ain't me coming to tell you this or that and you're getting healed through me the key is go through christ and and just because brother branham misunderstood him he expressed himself with sincerity and then brother branham had division and and brother branham saw him with a brown suit on straight lifting up his hands and arms walking like a normal person praising the lord that was the vision and he said i don't know when it's going to happen it might be next year 10 years from now i don't know but it does say with the lord sometimes we're we're kind of impatient and we want it to happen right now but sometimes it don't happen that way and then whenever the f this right here years down the road whenever these fbi people came in was trying to expose the prophet brother brown saw this brother on the street and that was another thing the lord had to delay him from going into the hotel room because he's going to go in the hotel room and miss it the lord had to delay him and he delayed him by a certain chain of events and then when he turned around fixing to go back in the hotel room he saw this brother standing by the palm tree raising his hand praising the lord so he would this even though satan attacks you it might be god trying to give you an opportunity to testify of his glory and power so they can attack you that's fine so let's go down here and see even though the most important job in the world is called a bride out to be it to be a minister or to be any kind of cop you can be a doctor or anything you want to and if you get put your emphasis on that instead of who you are as an individual between you and the lord you're missing a boat said i have been told here according to this that the fbi is going to expose me tonight i said all right all right fbi wherever you are my manager is gone and so forth you know they ain't going to worry about having a manager try to fight them or resist them i invite you to come up to the platform and expose me if there is anything i've done that is illegal contrary to the bible anything illegal to the laws of the nation anything you want come up and expose me tell me where i'm wrong which i knew there was no fbi i just stood there a little bit and waited a little while and so on and so on se and then he he waited and he said oops i thought you were going to expose me i said all right you're not fbi agents you're backslidden preachers that's exactly what you are you ask anybody you wish to ask my manager i said you're backslidden preachers i challenge you in the name of jesus christ you wrote this down and said i was a simon or sorcerer if i am simon the sorcerer and you are holy man then you come to the platform and god strike me dead then if i am a man of god and you're wrong then you come to the platform and god strike you dead come on down now these men elevated themselves to such a high position that they thought there was above everybody even the messenger to the age [Music] and they was humbled down because they was exposed for being exactly what they are they were exalted themselves instead of being humble before the lord no matter how high position that we think we are we should not exalt ourselves and think we're better than everybody else when we're not there's another place in 1964 where he talks about that brother being drunk in the pulpit and he says sometimes we get to a place and think that god blesses us he gave me this special blessing whether it's a lexus or cadillac or whatever it is a better job a nice house or whatever it is it don't matter what it is there's no sign that you can't turn his blessings from you when you get lifted up and feel well i i once laid all night and prayed i once did this i do that i don't do it anymore then you're on dangerous ground you're looking back to your experiences of yesterday and you don't have an experience or a personal walk now it's good that you had an experience yesterday but it's important that you also have that walk now yes that's what's the matter with our pentecostal people you can say message people either one well back yonder a long time ago when we had little missions down on the corner somewhere and the women with no stockings on and beating the tambourine down there had to pray all night and everything cops locked you up stayed in jail and so forth you prayed the churches all the denominations laughed at you made fun of you but now god has lifted you up to you got some of the best churches in the country great powerful ministries you begin to feel secure be careful that's when you get lifted up then when god sends something you can't accept it anymore because you've already witnessed to this thing that's real dangerous when god sends us something we cannot receive it because we think we're better than that then you begin to feel secure that's the time you're on your road to fall that's for denominations or nations or whatever what we need in this nation and will never receive it it's not a political house cleaning it's a holy ghost scent revival that'll sweep her from tip to toe that's what our churches need that's what our people needs that's what as individuals we need that's our influence when we get lifted up and say i'm pentecostal i spoke with tongues i shouted i danced in the spirit you might have done that but let me tell you something brother that's no security to you not a bit we find out that uzi got lifted up in his heart we found out that god smote him what did he do he tried so much to take a minister's place he thought that he got lifted up and god blessed him made him a great man so he could do anything he wanted to do he said i heard a young man tell me not long ago he said you know god loves me so much brother branham he just let me do anything i want to he don't care sure he cares people think they can go live out in the world and then come into church and do everything in the church too i mean if you're a sinner then you need to stay in the pew until you repent and get it right you know it's not a shame to be in sin it's a shame to stay in sin you can come out of it you can repent and i mean people want to go straight from the bar to the pulpit straight to the bar back to the bar back to the pulpit again and think they're right and living for god you're not living for god whenever you're lit servant who can serve two masters you can't serve the devil and god at the same time you need to make up your mind well this right here i know this right here is about another church but if we have the same spirit as that church we're just as guilty as that church so pay attention to make sure that we're not guilty you know we as a people we might not be guilty of this but if we're not careful and we let satan come in and give us a wrong attitude we could be guilty of it because we know for a fact that this gospel which we preach is going to go back to the jews and god is going to turn from the gentiles to the jews it might not be now but we know in the future that this even what we call the message in this country is not going to be in god's perfect will anymore they are going to be nothing but foolish virgins caught in a great tribulation because god is going to be dealing with the jews whenever the rapture of the church happens it's gone it's not gone now because the rapture hasn't happened but whenever the rapture happens and god returns to the jews this right here could be happening right in the message churches do you know that this church was actually more wicked than ahab ahab there's a lot of types and symbols in ahab i mean you can look at ahab he had he had he went to war against the mighty army and it was prophesied that he would win that war and he did it with a very very small group of men he did does that mean he could lift himself up and think he did it in his own strength not so long after that god punished him so if we even when we see supernatural miracles in our midst if we haven't got that personal relationship with god if we haven't received that holy ghost if we haven't received that token then what good does all this stuff do you have to have that personal relationship do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before god you can't say that about the roman catholic church no sir she never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that wouldn't be a mean tone everything's trying to help her to repent that is history now god kept rising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of god they did everything they could to bring the church back to god god certainly gave her opportunity to help her to repent did she ever repent show that she did by her fruits no sir she never has and never will she is drunk she has lost her senses and spiritual things now don't be confused and start thinking the church of rome has repented of her slaughter and his saints because she attempting to unite with the protestants and make her creeds line up with the protestant creeds i mean you'll find this i mean it it's it's evident if you just open your eyes and look around i mean they're doing it not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will rise up to kill for murder lies in her evil unrepented heart that's true i mean look how pious they are i mean they'll come out and say we all need to just remove all the borders and we need to just let everybody come up and you know what it is it's just her trying to strengthen her grip on the country so that she can have that force to persecute anybody don't agree with her system or doctrine that's right i mean you had even uh george bush came out the other day he was on a podcast and he was condemning protestants has been in one party versus the other they're they're coming out and saying these things releasing them one day they're going to pounce and they're going to grip and they're going to strangle everybody don't agree with them and it ain't just christians either look they killed galileo galileo and he wasn't even a christian it comes to music i mean they i mean why why do we see these things in the news and then we wonder why are we surprised when they happen i mean they've been said we're going they're going to happen they're going to happen dear lord jesus we uh thank you for letting us stand once again and speak to your people father for your people are the most important ones in the world lord and we just pray lord that you would just help us to not exalt ourselves beyond measure but lord that you could just use this as a tool any way that you would have for to use us father in any means any purpose lord we want to be humble enough to say yes to your will lord we thank you for all things lord we just ask that you come and bless the brother juan and his assembly lord and let them be aware of the things that that could happen lord out there we know that you give us warnings of things that's going to happen in the future maybe that's all this is lord is just a warning of what might happen in the future lord we might lift up and try to claim that we're all that one of our lord we're not we're just your people and you're living through us lord it's not in our own ability father it is you that's living through us father it's not in our own strengths but it's in your strength father we thank you for all things lord we just ask that you would just bless each one and let them meditate upon your word lord and if they haven't had that personal one-on-one relationship with you and if they haven't accepted your present-day word in their own life in their own walk we pray father that you would reach down lord and you would just move in your special way that you would touch them lord they that they would give that full surrender to you we know father that you have dealt in the lives of those around us we seated in their lives we see them pray lord we see them greed when things happen this is contrary to your word and your will lord we need that experience in our own lives it's good that you're the god of abraham you're the god of jacob that you're the god of isaac the father we want you to be our god as well we want you to have a personal relationship with us that way we won't be tempted to act like we're arrogant or out of sort lord even if you choose to put us in a position that is important that it is you that is working through your people no matter what position or place that they are in father we are always wanting just to fulfill your word we thank you for all things lord we just ask that you would just go with us as we go our ways we ask in the name lord jesus christ amen [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] my [Music] my [Music] do not pass me bye we have an important prayer request here we want to remember and there will be a little meeting for the musician right after service you can stay and talk about things but let's remember the most important person in this building is the lord jesus the most important thing that we come to do is to worship him that is the most important thing i hope we we kind of for grab grabs the the message this morning if we would just ask ourselves every day what is the most important thing what is the most important thing in my home they say the furniture you see the television is this the thing that we paid hundreds of dollars for the most important thing in that home is the family it's the family it's not the money it's not it's not the things that we bought and how best we document the house is the family that's the reason why sometimes people lose their mind when children break little furniture they get so crazy you know how much money i spend for this and you know they get so mad because they don't know the important things how's money wife what is the important thing your house money is important than you your wife is important in you if you ever see it like that [Music] you always strive to keep the important thing but if you think that you are important you will get the less important thing to go because you think you are important what is the important thing between you and and maybe even the food you eat [Music] see all these people that you know that has to get alcohol or you know get drunk or something else for them to feel satisfied what is important if you just think about it what is important you can pay for the life that you have if god did not woke you up this morning it would be a complete different story [Music] i think that's what the message was driving to this morning malachi chapter 4 behold i send you elijah the prophet what is important it's not elijah it's the one to whom he sent elijah behold i sent you god love you so much that he send you a gift he send you a message [Music] to get you ready for a rapture what is the most important thing [Music] between you and your clothes that you wear between you and the food that you're eating is the important thing let's buy our house we want to take these needs to the lord [Music] we're the lost and the lonely bring their burdens and their kids this is your house this is your heart [Music] father come and work we are your hearts it's a holy house of [Music] we are your hearts [Music] prayer requests this morning her dad is not feeling well and acts that we lift him up to the lord brother stephen wools uh had to be rushed to the emergency this morning he's not feeling well and let's just take these needs to the lord as we just bought our hearts realizing that the ones that we are praying for are important then the words that we will say the one that we are speaking to is important and as you just think about the message this morning say lord i don't need to tell you what to say [Music] but i sat there listening to the wording i just running through my mind and [Music] trying to rearrange things in my mind and in my heart because sometimes we put the less important things we use all our energy after the less important things and the things that are very important when jesus in his own word said man shall not lay by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of god and sometimes those are the those are the less things in our life what is most important [Music] what is most important [Music] heavenly father dear lord jesus we want to bring these needs to you father lord we stand together this afternoon lord god has to remember our sister dad lord father it was good to see him over the easter weekend lord

us lord god father about humbleness lord in the weight of god father when your word said we must abstain others better than ourselves so god lord if you the god of heaven have bestowed such a honor and grace upon us to call us your children father how can we be so despiseful how can we be lord god father how can we look at another mortal lord and just despise them how can we father become so judgmental and so critical lord god father lord god and and all we can talk about people is just so negative father lord oh god where comes that negative energy lord jesus that seems so godfather dominate our mind and dominate our conversation of god lord father we bring our house before you this morning [Music] dear lord we pray that father god you help us lord lord jesus to go from the service this morning father and when we have faced lord father with daily tax lord and we are faithful father god lord with decision to make lord god and we have faced lord father with things to talk about may we ask ourselves what is important is it my super little pride or just saying the truth what is important and because we think so much of ourselves sometimes we are struggling with things in our lives and and and we know they are not good for us but we we just we just try to to to uh keep a wrong picture i know no doubt in my mind when brother george came out this morning without marks on his face i know floss of thoughts went through our mind and was thinking what is this guy doing sometimes we don't hold ourselves for the meaning to say okay what's going on okay lord help me to to think about this as soon as we see things we start to judge it [Music] yes lord jesus father we asking you this morning lord garden lord is not just to say a prayer for the brother or say a prayer for the need lord is to put our heart before you found it is to place ourselves in a state of another person is to put ourselves in a state of another person so god we ask this morning that god that is touched by the feelings of our influence lord may you touch these ones that are not well father may you heal them o god glorify yourself lord jesus india in their weaknesses this morning father if we have never make you the most important person in our lives help us lord jesus if you are not the most important person in our life father we just asked this morning oh god that you deal with our heart lord [Music] because everything we know lord god is going to pass away one of these days lord father we might be striking with death lord god where we can pray for lord jesus and we will have to stand before the most important person [Music] dear lord we put our house before you father and lord jesus we just pray to god that we will be able to put on these different things so god father that was spoken this morning and lord god and we may we just meditated on a lord father sometimes so god we are caught in the emotion of the preaching than the word that has been preached the word is the most important thing it's not the action of the of the preacher the word is the most important thing [Music] what is important what is most important [Music] father we just prayed and asked that you bless
