[35:35] Crosby was born in
[35:38] 1820
[35:43] born to an immigrant parents
[35:47] uh
[35:49] in New York City
[35:54] and uh
[35:56] he was actually born in the U.S
[36:00] [Music]
[36:04] and from from a little child
[36:10] just when she was few months old
[36:16] she had an inflammation of her eyes
[36:19] [Music]
[36:21] and the number City doctor was not
[36:24] around so
[36:26] there was another doctor that came and
[36:31] uh
[36:33] prescribed
[36:38] a treatment
[36:39] of putting some warm object over her
[36:42] eyes and it destroyed her eyes glands
[36:46] just from a little baby
[36:48] that was even before she was one years
[36:51] old
[36:52] and uh
[36:55] and and she loves her eyes
[36:58] [Music]
[37:01] and it's amazing
[37:04] woman
[37:06] we have so much of
[37:10] trouble in her life
[37:12] before she will be one year old her
[37:16] father passed away
[37:18] [Music]
[37:23] and uh
[37:25] foreign
[37:27] before she was one year old she lost her
[37:30] eyes
[37:32] before she was one year old
[37:35] her father passed away
[37:40] there's a little perm that she wrote
[37:45] [Music]
[37:50] no let's read the next one sister Katrin
[37:54] she said oh what a happy child I am
[37:58] although I cannot see
[38:02] I am resolved that in this word content
[38:06] I will be
[38:09] how many blessings I enjoy that other
[38:13] people don't
[38:18] so we inside because I'm blind
[38:21] [Music]
[38:23] I cannot known I want
[38:27] she wrote that poem when she was just
[38:30] eight years old
[38:32] so when her dad passed away
[38:35] it was her grandmother her mom had to go
[38:38] to work so she was raised by her
[38:40] grandmother and another and another
[38:43] neighbor lady that hosted him
[38:47] and her grandmother taught her how to um
[38:51] or her grandmother will read the Bible
[38:54] to her so it's it's recorded that when
[38:57] she was 10 years old
[38:59] she could memorize the Book of Genesis
[39:02] Exodus Leviticus and numbers
[39:05] and Matthew Mike Luke and John she could
[39:09] memorize those books not just Bible
[39:11] verses She had the books memorized
[39:17] so that will show how much that had a
[39:21] great influence on her life
[39:23] it influenced her so much
[39:27] and then when she was about 15 years old
[39:31] that was when
[39:33] they had just opened the School for the
[39:36] Blind
[39:37] in uh in New York because the parents
[39:40] moved down to Connecticut I mean uh and
[39:44] then that school of the blind was open
[39:46] then she was taken to that school
[39:48] [Music]
[39:51] and uh there she finished her education
[39:55] and she also became a teacher there at
[39:58] the school
[39:59] but I mean just there's just a lot of
[40:02] tremendous story around time cannot
[40:04] allow us I don't want to take time from
[40:06] the preacher this morning
[40:08] but you know we go through different
[40:12] things in life
[40:14] and different experiences different
[40:17] tough times
[40:18] we
[40:20] love uh lost or loved ones that are dear
[40:23] to us
[40:25] but you see there is something there is
[40:27] something that God designed
[40:30] in a way that uh
[40:34] he allows certain things to come our
[40:37] path
[40:38] in all this great statement brother
[40:40] Branham made that he says the other it's
[40:42] only the things that serve God's purpose
[40:44] will rise again thank you
[40:47] because we have to know that
[40:51] we are not here by ourselves
[40:54] the one that brought us here had a plan
[40:57] when he brought us here he had a purpose
[41:00] of why he brought us here so to just
[41:04] to just disregard his purpose
[41:07] and just try to seek our own pleasure
[41:11] and our own satisfaction
[41:14] uh
[41:16] I mean it's not it's not so it's not a
[41:19] pleasant thing
[41:21] [Music]
[41:25] so there was something you know we can
[41:28] sum up her whole life this morning
[41:30] and and says that uh there was something
[41:34] that uh was so blessed is that even from
[41:39] a young age
[41:41] realizing that
[41:43] she never had a day like that she saw
[41:47] she realized that that this was her
[41:51] purpose
[41:52] and she made the best use of her
[41:56] blindness
[41:57] that she even said one time that even if
[42:00] there was medication for me to see she
[42:03] said I would prefer staying blind
[42:06] because by this blindness
[42:09] it was God's gift to me
[42:12] for me to be a blessing to the word
[42:19] and uh
[42:21] with all you know
[42:24] we read a scripture to silence ago Jesus
[42:27] said blessed I yeed that you have eyes
[42:32] but what we are doing with our eyes is
[42:34] only the god of Heaven Knows let me read
[42:36] this from Brother Branham
[42:38] and then I will close here I don't want
[42:40] to take the preacher's time
[42:45] maybe if the law gave us another
[42:46] opportunity we would take a selfie some
[42:48] days
[42:49] I'm just going back and forth in my
[42:52] notes here brother Brandon shared yet in
[42:54] the message Blind by timush let me take
[42:56] this one
[42:57] he says and then when Fanny Crosby one
[43:00] day
[43:02] when they come to her with these big
[43:06] bargains
[43:08] she was
[43:10] poor too and they came to her and said
[43:14] we will give you so much if you will
[43:17] just give your talent over to making
[43:20] Sons for the entertainment of the word
[43:24] she flatly refused it
[43:27] she would not do it praise the Lord
[43:30] it was it was even said there there uh
[43:34] when her mom passed away and her mom
[43:36] inherited and asked it from her brother
[43:38] the mother brother and her two sisters
[43:42] you know deny her all that
[43:45] but she never took a crush against them
[43:50] she just fell there I mean she lived all
[43:53] of her life just to the service of
[43:57] people
[43:59] not only sounds she was a great writer
[44:02] and also she was a missionary
[44:05] because she would go out to the missions
[44:08] house in in the New York district and
[44:11] then she will she will read her perms
[44:13] you know she would sing songs and she
[44:16] was into your Moody Revival she was one
[44:19] of the great singers there and and uh
[44:21] and many of these men that were running
[44:23] during the revival time they were all
[44:26] having Fanny Crosby singing for them one
[44:29] time she was at the mission house and uh
[44:33] she
[44:36] she was called to give a statement a
[44:38] re-apperman
[44:40] and as she said she says
[44:43] I believe that there is uh there's a boy
[44:46] a year that has uh uh that is running
[44:50] away from his mother's prayer his
[44:52] mother's cried and you know and then
[44:56] right after that Revival
[44:58] a young boy came to to hurt and says was
[45:02] I the one you were talking about
[45:05] I promised my mama that I would self
[45:09] the Lord and Mama went to be with the
[45:11] Lord and I got so I attracted
[45:15] she did not only let that young boy back
[45:18] to the Lord
[45:20] but out of that she wrote the son
[45:23] rescued the perishing
[45:25] care for the dying
[45:28] most of her sons
[45:30] were all inspired
[45:33] by the different things
[45:35] that she was going through she wrote the
[45:38] song Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine
[45:41] he had a friend called Phoebe
[45:43] so Phoebe had a music
[45:46] Phoebe was playing on the organ she had
[45:48] the music
[45:49] if any Crosby heard that you know she
[45:51] said if anything I have this music I
[45:53] don't have words for it
[45:55] friendly Crosby said just give me a few
[45:56] minutes she went in the room
[45:58] she played the music in her head
[46:01] she came back with the words bless us
[46:04] assurance Jesus Is Mine
[46:07] foreign
[46:10] years old
[46:12] lost her dad before she was one years
[46:14] old she got married she had a baby
[46:18] and the baby passed away before the baby
[46:20] was one years old
[46:23] praise the Lord
[46:24] amen
[46:26] we go through some of the damn things of
[46:30] life
[46:31] some things that are that are of no
[46:35] glory to God just because of our own
[46:38] pride and selfishness and then sometimes
[46:41] we take an attitude on God and take an
[46:44] attitude not even not even coming close
[46:47] to Understanding God's purpose for our
[46:49] lives
[46:51] praise the Lord
[46:55] and brother Branham says here she
[46:57] refused she flatly refused she would not
[47:00] do it she said if there's anything that
[47:03] I have it belongs to Christ and so they
[47:07] the man who were talking to her said
[47:10] then I suppose that you are expecting to
[47:14] go to a world where there will be
[47:16] eternal life and so forth she said yes
[47:18] so what
[47:20] so what do you expect this Christ to be
[47:24] said he will be a man
[47:27] and said then if you
[47:31] if you are the same over there as you
[47:35] are here
[47:38] you didn't never see him said you are
[47:41] blind she said oh I'll know him anyhow
[47:47] they said how will you ever know him if
[47:50] you are still blind over there as you
[47:54] are never had a sight in your life
[47:57] and on the other side if you had no side
[48:01] there how will you know him then she
[48:04] said I will know him and they laugh I've
[48:08] heard and uh and she turned and started
[48:11] through the house when she had made her
[48:14] decision
[48:16] no sir nothing of this word
[48:19] oh my talent is given to Christ
[48:23] she started back across the house and
[48:26] raised up her hands and she said I'll
[48:28] know him I shall know him as I know him
[48:32] and Redeemed by his side I shall stand I
[48:35] shall I know him I shall know him by the
[48:39] prince of the nails in his hands
[48:42] is those great crucial moments
[48:45] The Strain is put upon us that God Moves
[48:50] In
[48:51] when we make the decision for him that's
[48:54] between life and death
[48:57] that little sharp edge
[49:00] sometimes are the last moment
[49:04] when you think you are not going
[49:08] to be well or somebody making fun of you
[49:12] still hold your testimony
[49:14] it's that time that God Moves In Praise
[49:18] the Lord
[49:19] amen
[49:27] one time I'm going to stop right here
[49:28] one time
[49:30] she was uh
[49:31] [Music]
[49:33] she was uh
[49:35] foreign
[49:40] man
[49:44] and the man had his driver taking her
[49:48] back home and they were talking
[49:52] you know and then the man was dropped
[49:55] you know he was ear dropping on the
[49:57] conversation
[49:59] as soon as he realized that this is
[50:02] Fanny Crosby
[50:03] you know he stopped the the
[50:07] the horses stopped the charity and he
[50:09] jumped down out of the chair and took up
[50:12] his heart and he said sir Mrs Fanny
[50:14] Crosby
[50:16] you know he bowed his head
[50:18] she said yes he said oh and then he saw
[50:22] the policeman and said uh he said he
[50:24] said sir come and see Mrs Fanny Crosby
[50:27] the one that sang safe in the safe in
[50:30] the arm of Jesus
[50:33] praise the Lord
[50:35] that was a song that she sung kind of
[50:37] when she lost her baby
[50:40] so as soon as she the man said that
[50:44] the police took his heart
[50:47] and he said just
[50:49] gone Saturday
[50:52] we bury my baby
[50:54] and we sunk that him safe in the arm of
[50:57] Jesus
[50:58] if any Crosby asks him he says uh you
[51:01] know uh talking about the hands and said
[51:05] she said you know all the police
[51:08] and all the real real guys they are all
[51:11] my boys
[51:12] but when you get home tell your wife
[51:15] your baby received in the arm of Jesus
[51:18] listen to our faith
[51:23] [Music]
[51:28] that will be your
[51:30] that would have been uh
[51:32] my next testimony I would have said if
[51:35] you if you look at her songs
[51:37] most of the songs she wrote at the end
[51:40] of her life
[51:41] [Music]
[51:44] she always had a line there when she
[51:47] like this song vision of rapture
[51:51] I shall see him face to face
[51:53] she had an inspiration
[51:56] that gave her more sight
[51:59] than many people that have eyes
[52:05] you understand why Jesus said
[52:08] except you are born again you cannot see
[52:11] the Kingdom of Heaven
[52:13] praise the Lord
[52:16] because Faith gave us a sight
[52:20] that the word do not have a side that is
[52:23] better than the ones your two eyes can
[52:25] see
[52:27] they give you a side to look beyond
[52:29] Behind Your paints
[52:31] it gave you a sight to look behind your
[52:33] sickness that there is a Healer
[52:36] Faith gave you aside through all your
[52:38] trouble you still see a deliverable

[57:53] process of change
[57:54] we are in the dispensation of change at
[57:57] any moment we could be caught away in
[58:00] the moment in a twinkling of an eye amen
[58:04] Brian Ferry Cosby had visions of us but
[58:07] we are living in the reality of rapture
[58:09] the dispensation that we'll see the
[58:11] changing of the body from Mortal to

[58:17] promise from day to day it could happen

[58:40] morning
[58:42] oh God for a life Lord that was
[58:44] dedicated for your service
[58:46] life of God that fulfilled your purpose
[58:49] year upon the Earth
[58:52] your Prophet taught us Lord that
[58:53] anything that serves God's purpose there
[58:56] is a resurrection
[58:58] father this morning we are here once
[59:00] again to fulfill your purpose Lord
[59:02] we pray father your blessing upon the
[59:05] service
[59:05] bless the reading of your word may you
[59:08] bless the ministry of your word as we
[59:10] look to you this morning in Jesus
[59:13] Christ's name amen amen let us turn to
[59:16] our Bibles for scripture reading
[59:19] just to get an introduction on brother
[59:21] Peterson I'm from Bible Tabernacle
[59:24] welcome to State and our pastor is
[59:27] brother Harold Beckett and I've been
[59:30] with him for 46 years he actually
[59:33] baptized me also in the name of the Lord
[59:36] and we thank God for the fellowship for
[59:39] all these years and I believe it's the
[59:42] time we are spinning upon the Earth as
[59:43] short-lived
[59:45] if you compare it to what is longer to
[59:47] unfold in eternity amen so this morning
[59:51] I bring greetings from the Saints of
[59:53] like Precious Faith from Bible
[59:55] Tabernacle and the pastor amen
[59:58] regardless she bless you you want to
[1:00:00] thank Pastor one for the invitation and
[1:00:04] for the five-star treatment that I
[1:00:06] received here amen Israel he's really a
[1:00:10] wonderful man of God may God she bless
[1:00:11] him and be with him and Grant him the
[1:00:14] wisdom as he guides the shepherd the
[1:00:16] Sheep amen the side of the world Amen
[1:00:19] may God be with him and Grant his
[1:00:21] heart's desire and may his face shine
[1:00:23] upon him
[1:00:25] God bless you amen so we're going to
[1:00:28] read two portions of scripture
[1:00:30] Luke chapter 23 and verse 34
[1:00:34] and First Corinthians chapter 13.
[1:00:38] well there is all the verses in verses 1
[1:00:40] to 13.
[1:00:43] Luke chapter 23 and verse 34.
[1:00:51] then say Jesus
[1:00:53] father
[1:00:54] forgive them
[1:00:55] for they know not what they do
[1:00:58] and they parted his Raymond and cast
[1:01:01] lots
[1:01:03] and now First Corinthians chapter 13
[1:01:05] verses 1 to 13. now brother Brian says
[1:01:10] 13 is the number of a woman
[1:01:12] amen amen and I believe that this is the
[1:01:15] bright scripture yes amen and uh charity
[1:01:19] eight times is mentioned in this chapter
[1:01:22] in First Corinthians chapter 13 and it
[1:01:26] is a number of Eternity that's right
[1:01:28] amen is takes perfect love amen to take
[1:01:31] us into that rapturing phase amen so I
[1:01:35] would just like to speak here and we
[1:01:37] find here that Paul says though I speak
[1:01:39] now we mentions the word though
[1:01:42] whenever he says the word though you
[1:01:44] know it's something that's visible
[1:01:46] he says though I speak with tongue of
[1:01:48] men and angels and have not charity now
[1:01:51] charity is something you cannot see
[1:01:53] but yet it's real yes brother Branham
[1:01:56] says that charity is deity
[1:01:59] it's none other than God himself the
[1:02:02] attribute of God in human flesh
[1:02:05] so we find that God is above all
[1:02:08] and he is the center of everything
[1:02:11] and he says I am become as a sounding
[1:02:14] brass or a tingling symbol and though I
[1:02:17] have the gift of Prophecy again
[1:02:20] something you can see
[1:02:21] and understand all Mysteries you can
[1:02:24] know the older message all the
[1:02:25] quotations
[1:02:27] as all human instrumentality
[1:02:30] and all knowledge and know that I have
[1:02:33] all faith so that I could remove
[1:02:35] mountains
[1:02:37] and have no charity I am nothing
[1:02:41] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:02:44] the poor
[1:02:45] and though I give my body to be burned
[1:02:47] and have not charity it profited me
[1:02:51] nothing
[1:02:52] can you imagine somebody giving his body
[1:02:54] to be burned even crucified
[1:02:57] but if you have no charity you are
[1:02:59] absolutely doing it in vain
[1:03:01] you are nothing
[1:03:02] you see here at the end time we are
[1:03:05] dealing with the attributes of God being
[1:03:07] manifested in a mini-membered body
[1:03:10] worldwide and they are the only ones
[1:03:12] that are counted in Redemption amen amen
[1:03:16] charity suffers long and is kind these
[1:03:19] are not the attributes of charity
[1:03:21] charity envious not charity wound is not
[1:03:24] itself is not puffed up
[1:03:26] does not behave itself unseemingly
[1:03:29] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:03:33] easily provoked think of no evil the
[1:03:36] joys are not in iniquity but rejoices in
[1:03:40] the truth
[1:03:41] Bears all things we live with all things
[1:03:44] hope with all things endureth all things
[1:03:48] charity never fails
[1:03:51] but whether they be prophecies they
[1:03:54] shall fail
[1:03:55] whether there be tongues they shall
[1:03:57] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:04:00] shall vanish away
[1:04:02] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:04:06] part you see Paul said it was only a
[1:04:09] partial of Revelation but the fullness
[1:04:11] was to come at the end time and we are
[1:04:14] living in that dispensation
[1:04:16] but with that which is perfect is come
[1:04:19] When Love Comes when the Capstone comes
[1:04:22] amen then that which is in part shall be
[1:04:26] done away
[1:04:28] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:04:31] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:04:34] child but when I become a man I put away
[1:04:38] childish things I mean I don't When I
[1:04:41] visit your home found you playing little
[1:04:43] cars under on the on the floor and so
[1:04:46] you put those things away why because
[1:04:47] you're now a man yes amen for now we see
[1:04:51] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:04:54] face
[1:04:55] now I know in part but then shall I know
[1:04:58] even as also I am known when the full
[1:05:02] Revelation comes
[1:05:04] and now by the faith hope charity these
[1:05:09] three but the greatest of these is
[1:05:13] Charity may the Lord add His blessings
[1:05:15] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:05:16] seated amen
[1:05:19] now this morning I'd like to throw some
[1:05:22] inspiration
[1:05:23] and
[1:05:25] the title would be forgiveness
[1:05:29] because we are living in an hour that we
[1:05:32] need rapturing faith
[1:05:35] and faith brother Branham says is based
[1:05:37] on forgiveness
[1:05:39] and just to lay a foundation to what I
[1:05:42] would like to speak on this morning I'd
[1:05:44] like to read this quotation in the
[1:05:46] message in the Paradox just to lay a
[1:05:48] foundation
[1:05:50] says I was called on a scene
[1:05:54] a little something going on
[1:05:57] there was a fine young boy very fine boy
[1:06:00] he was going with a little girl
[1:06:03] very fine little girl out of a fine
[1:06:06] family
[1:06:07] and this boy all of a sudden came up
[1:06:09] with some kind of an idea
[1:06:12] and he just walked away
[1:06:15] he did something wrong to the little
[1:06:18] girl
[1:06:19] and much as promised her to do a certain
[1:06:23] thing and then didn't do it
[1:06:27] and instead of coming to her and
[1:06:30] apologizing
[1:06:31] like a gentleman should do he just he
[1:06:36] just wasn't in him to do it
[1:06:40] he couldn't say I'm sorry
[1:06:43] forgive me
[1:06:45] and the father and the mother called me
[1:06:47] to the scene and I believe that this is
[1:06:50] the best person they could have called
[1:06:51] on the scene to deal with this matter
[1:06:54] and I believe that from the manner that
[1:06:57] he approached it
[1:06:58] it's a lesson to us how to approach
[1:07:01] these things
[1:07:03] we would desire to know
[1:07:05] what is wrong with our boy
[1:07:10] now it's not easy to do sometimes but
[1:07:14] you must be truthful and honest
[1:07:16] therefore
[1:07:19] the boy was a Christian
[1:07:23] now we're going to see get the
[1:07:25] the uh what you call it
[1:07:28] what are all the
[1:07:30] what do you call the result the resume
[1:07:33] of the boy yeah
[1:07:35] as far as a believer
[1:07:37] he had repented
[1:07:39] and he had been baptized
[1:07:42] and he had his position amongst the
[1:07:44] Believers
[1:07:45] in other words he could have rejoiced
[1:07:47] with the rest of the Believers you could
[1:07:49] have testified as the rest of the
[1:07:52] Believers could have sang hymns as the
[1:07:54] rest of the Believers he could even go
[1:07:56] to the message like the rest of the
[1:07:59] Believers he did everything like the
[1:08:02] rest of the Believers
[1:08:04] but yet not received the baptism of the
[1:08:09] Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] no matter how much he thought he had it
[1:08:15] so from this we see that you may think
[1:08:17] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] and may not have it
[1:08:24] but the thing is to know that you have
[1:08:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:29] and how would you know it is by the life
[1:08:31] that you live
[1:08:35] those attributes that comes fourth from
[1:08:38] being filled with the spirit of God
[1:08:41] he says here
[1:08:43] you think you have it brother Branham
[1:08:46] says and having it is two different
[1:08:49] things
[1:08:51] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:08:54] and you might be able to show some
[1:08:56] evidence of some emotion
[1:09:00] now many people think about emotion it's
[1:09:03] the evidence that they have the Holy
[1:09:06] Ghost now listen the way brother Branham
[1:09:08] approaches this
[1:09:09] but unless your life is vindicating
[1:09:13] what you are professing to have you
[1:09:16] still haven't got it
[1:09:19] no matter how many emotions
[1:09:22] how much you jump run Sensations speak
[1:09:26] in tongues or shouting or whatever you
[1:09:30] may lay upon it
[1:09:32] which is all right I believe in all that
[1:09:36] when you have the Holy Ghost you can do
[1:09:37] all those things
[1:09:38] but doing it doesn't mean you have the
[1:09:40] Holy Ghost
[1:09:41] amen
[1:09:43] I believe in all still but unless your
[1:09:47] your life copes with your testimony
[1:09:50] then you haven't got it
[1:09:53] because the fruits of the spirit
[1:09:56] vindicates what you are
[1:09:59] just like the fruit of any tree tells
[1:10:02] you what it is
[1:10:04] apple tree will produce apples orange
[1:10:07] tree will produce oranges how would you
[1:10:09] know it's an orange tree by the fruit
[1:10:11] that is based
[1:10:13] so if you are a holy ghost fold
[1:10:16] Christian
[1:10:17] the fruits Jesus Says by the fruit you
[1:10:21] shall know them
[1:10:22] see by the future shall know them now
[1:10:26] this young fellow's parents his mother
[1:10:29] is German now what's the prophet
[1:10:32] purchase it in the genealogy
[1:10:35] he goes into the family
[1:10:38] you see where where does that
[1:10:42] nature comes from
[1:10:44] no reflection on the German
[1:10:47] but there's a strained in that family
[1:10:50] and that is they'll just sit and you can
[1:10:53] talk to them and they'll just stare you
[1:10:56] right in the face
[1:10:58] this girl's sister the mother of this
[1:11:00] boy
[1:11:02] her sister I have come down the street
[1:11:04] many more a morning
[1:11:07] and this young girl being sitting out in
[1:11:09] the yard I'd say good morning to you
[1:11:13] he just looked at me
[1:11:15] and I'd stop and say sure fine morning
[1:11:18] Professor went on Friday so
[1:11:21] many times when somebody ignores us we
[1:11:23] say well I'll just go my way but the
[1:11:26] prophet continued the conversation
[1:11:29] she just looked at me and I'd stop and
[1:11:32] I'd say sure fine morning
[1:11:34] she would just stand look at you an
[1:11:37] intelligent woman
[1:11:39] I'd say come up to see us sometime
[1:11:43] she just stand and look well her
[1:11:47] brothers are that way father and mother
[1:11:50] is that way
[1:11:51] so that same nature is rubbed off on
[1:11:53] this young man that couldn't say I'm
[1:11:56] sorry
[1:11:57] now the father of the boy is strictly an
[1:12:00] Irishman Moody High tempered High Strung
[1:12:04] that's his whole family that
[1:12:07] except one other one out of the family
[1:12:09] converted
[1:12:11] now in this boy
[1:12:13] this father and mother both are
[1:12:16] Christians
[1:12:18] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:20] and they have brought this young man up
[1:12:23] in the way of the Lord
[1:12:25] and now the young man is about 17 or 18
[1:12:29] years old
[1:12:30] something along there very fine Keith
[1:12:33] and he's been a real model at school
[1:12:36] nice kid and he's got a brother that's
[1:12:40] just vice versa
[1:12:43] but the girls the mother's family lives
[1:12:47] to a fine Church
[1:12:49] but do you think they'd ever come over
[1:12:51] no
[1:12:52] and they say it's right but it's not
[1:12:55] just in them to ask forgiveness
[1:13:00] you find many many even Christians you
[1:13:03] know that's my family
[1:13:04] nature my dad is my mom is like that you
[1:13:08] know so
[1:13:09] just take me as I am
[1:13:11] but you don't expect that from
[1:13:12] Christians
[1:13:13] and that's why this morning
[1:13:15] just to sort of uh
[1:13:19] speak on this matter
[1:13:21] on this topic of forgiveness
[1:13:24] how important it is
[1:13:26] to be able to forgive
[1:13:29] he says here they just don't do it is
[1:13:32] not in them now the genes in the father
[1:13:36] and mother of this boy no matter how
[1:13:39] much they are converted Still Remains
[1:13:42] the flesh that's been integrated out to
[1:13:45] this boy
[1:13:47] so the mother and father you can't even
[1:13:49] go on the testimony of his mother and
[1:13:51] father he's got to have an experience
[1:13:54] he's got to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost and many times when children they
[1:13:59] are raised in a God-fearing family
[1:14:02] and they feel that God is a Godfather
[1:14:05] you know he's a grandfather
[1:14:07] amen you know he has grandchildren it
[1:14:10] doesn't work that way brother Brian says
[1:14:12] God is a father each and every one that
[1:14:15] comes forth is a son or a daughter
[1:14:17] you've got to have the baptism of the
[1:14:20] Holy Ghost amen you see it slowly
[1:14:23] remains in the face therefore the boy
[1:14:25] has got a complex with him
[1:14:27] just like his mother's family
[1:14:29] and they are not forgiving
[1:14:32] they will not apologize and that's where
[1:14:36] that boy stands
[1:14:38] now I say to the father no matter how
[1:14:40] much you raise them up
[1:14:42] now look at you out of the family all of
[1:14:46] them drunks they fighting and shooting
[1:14:49] and cutting
[1:14:51] now look at your family to the mother
[1:14:53] there are a bunch of people that just
[1:14:55] sit there and won't speak very
[1:14:58] independent see the prophet goes even
[1:15:01] into the family history to see why that
[1:15:04] boy is in the condition that he's in
[1:15:07] it's not you you're the only one of your
[1:15:10] sisters and brothers
[1:15:12] and you are sweet and kind and forgiving
[1:15:16] so those are the fruits of a spiritual
[1:15:19] Christian they are sweet
[1:15:21] they are kind and they are forgiving
[1:15:25] see
[1:15:26] what does that and you know that you
[1:15:29] you're the three part of the family tree
[1:15:31] yet you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:15:34] that's the thing that made you tender
[1:15:37] and sweet
[1:15:39] it's not your people anymore
[1:15:43] it's your Christ that lives in you
[1:15:46] that's why the Bible says You must be
[1:15:48] born again
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:52] through your genealogy of your parents
[1:15:56] your new birth it cancels all that
[1:16:00] family threat everything that the family
[1:16:02] has left all that contamination of the
[1:16:05] family it leaves you
[1:16:07] when you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:09] Ghost you are a new creation you are a
[1:16:12] brand new man all things are passed away
[1:16:14] all things are now new you are a son and
[1:16:18] a daughter of God
[1:16:19] I say to the boy look at your family
[1:16:21] practically all of them are drunk so uh
[1:16:24] of course I said and how moody and high
[1:16:27] tempered and high strung but you are not
[1:16:30] you're kind and forgiving what is it the
[1:16:33] Holy Spirit
[1:16:35] you're no more what you are it's Christ
[1:16:38] in you now that's the same thing has to
[1:16:42] happen to your son
[1:16:45] and the father raised up and said my son
[1:16:48] went to the altar
[1:16:50] he was baptized correctly in the name of
[1:16:55] Jesus Christ
[1:16:58] see
[1:16:59] and the water baptism in the pool
[1:17:02] said I know my son has come to Christ
[1:17:06] and many believe that it stops with the
[1:17:09] water baptism the water baptism Only
[1:17:11] baptizes You Into The Fellowship of the
[1:17:14] local church
[1:17:16] but is the Holy Ghost baptism that
[1:17:19] baptized you into the mystical body of
[1:17:21] Jesus Christ now you on the body of
[1:17:25] Jesus Christ amen so from water baptism
[1:17:29] they've got to continue
[1:17:31] We Believe unto receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:17:34] Hallelujah I said that may be all right
[1:17:38] or outward emotions as we just read
[1:17:42] what Paul said in First Corinthians
[1:17:44] chapter 13 the outward emotions
[1:17:47] he might be identified as a Believer
[1:17:50] with the Believers
[1:17:53] but until he's regenerated and born
[1:17:55] again
[1:17:56] are advised that young men never to
[1:17:59] marry that woman
[1:18:02] so it puts out the parents on the god
[1:18:05] when the young man wants to marry your
[1:18:07] daughter
[1:18:08] or
[1:18:09] your daughter wants to marry a young man
[1:18:13] how do we know you know maybe they come
[1:18:16] on the come in with the Sheep's close
[1:18:20] the wool you know the skin
[1:18:22] but the Nature has not changed yet they
[1:18:25] have never experienced the baptism of
[1:18:27] the Holy Ghost
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:31] so before you say yes sister first pray
[1:18:34] about it
[1:18:35] they may have been interviewed with your
[1:18:37] dad with Holy Ghost
[1:18:39] and he would be able to discern
[1:18:42] what's in the young man amen oh the
[1:18:45] pastor amen come and see my pastor I
[1:18:49] have a chat with him and see what type
[1:18:51] of you know Spirit that's upon the man
[1:18:54] amen these things are verified because
[1:18:56] after they are married now you see the
[1:18:59] real person
[1:19:01] the professor was lingering behind those
[1:19:03] you know Badger schemes all the time
[1:19:05] that he wasn't a Christian
[1:19:07] amen he might be the most spiritual man
[1:19:10] appear to be the spiritual man but
[1:19:13] unless he's been received the Holy Ghost
[1:19:16] amen see
[1:19:19] brother Branham says he'll make hell on
[1:19:21] Earth for her
[1:19:22] until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit
[1:19:26] of Christ comes in
[1:19:28] then that will be the Paradox in itself
[1:19:33] is it wonderful
[1:19:36] that once the Holy Ghost comes in your
[1:19:38] absolutely changed
[1:19:40] you used to do those things you you were
[1:19:42] you you were that person
[1:19:45] but once the Holy Ghost comes in that's
[1:19:46] when the change comes
[1:19:48] you're uh that the old man is dead
[1:19:51] but now you ought to a Christian
[1:19:55] your desires are different
[1:19:58] your conversation is different your
[1:20:00] conduct is different your nature is
[1:20:02] different because you're on the new
[1:20:04] management now you under the management
[1:20:06] of the Holy Ghost amen let's give the
[1:20:09] Lord I had a praise this morning amen
[1:20:13] and brother Branham says that will be a
[1:20:17] paradox
[1:20:18] unbelievable
[1:20:20] I mean many of your friends might know
[1:20:22] you what you were then
[1:20:24] but knowing you now when you seizure as
[1:20:26] a Christian he says I could never
[1:20:28] believe that you could become a person
[1:20:30] do what you are today
[1:20:32] what is it it's the Holy Ghost
[1:20:34] and that's what we all need
[1:20:37] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:39] without the Holy Ghost we are not going
[1:20:41] to make it amen
[1:20:44] he says in itself and that will take the
[1:20:46] very nature of that boy that's bred
[1:20:49] between father and mother
[1:20:51] and yet in his intellectuals he's trying
[1:20:54] his best to overcome it
[1:20:57] the prophet says you can't do it he'll
[1:21:00] never overcome it
[1:21:02] Christ will have to overcome it
[1:21:05] when he lets Christ in
[1:21:08] then he's already overcome then
[1:21:12] it'll be a perfect paradox
[1:21:16] when a man is born of the spirit
[1:21:21] so what are the marks of an overcomer's
[1:21:24] life
[1:21:25] a spirit full Christian what other marks
[1:21:29] of it
[1:21:30] it's that gentle sweet spirit
[1:21:34] of forgiveness
[1:21:36] because of the young man's natural
[1:21:39] genealogy
[1:21:41] he could not help for the condition that
[1:21:44] he was in
[1:21:45] see and we are in that condition because
[1:21:48] of what happened in Eden
[1:21:50] the love part of God was taken away now
[1:21:53] man is born
[1:21:54] see he's born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:21:58] he comes to the world speaking lies
[1:22:01] that's why Jesus says You must be born
[1:22:04] again
[1:22:06] Hallelujah see so that's the natural
[1:22:09] genealogy
[1:22:11] but there's also a spiritual genealogy
[1:22:15] see and that's pretty spiritual
[1:22:17] genealogy comes from the attribute of
[1:22:20] God
[1:22:21] that overrides your natural human
[1:22:25] genealogy
[1:22:27] see it makes you a son and a daughter of
[1:22:31] God
[1:22:32] because you find in the final moments
[1:22:35] of Jesus mission on Earth
[1:22:39] he had the DNA
[1:22:41] he had the genealogy of God he says
[1:22:45] father forgive them
[1:22:47] for they know not what they are doing
[1:22:50] his life on Earth
[1:22:53] was to forgive
[1:22:55] and to save
[1:22:57] amen and until the day of his death he
[1:23:00] was still saying father forgive them for
[1:23:03] they know not what they are doing
[1:23:07] it's the life of God
[1:23:10] brother Brian says here in his Shalom
[1:23:12] message the other day we were stalking
[1:23:15] the wife and I
[1:23:17] we were talking about the hour that we
[1:23:20] are living in
[1:23:22] it seems there is to be a time that upon
[1:23:25] the people
[1:23:26] that is the most pathetic time that I
[1:23:30] could think about
[1:23:33] I have constantly done my very best to
[1:23:36] try
[1:23:37] doing disagreeing with a man in
[1:23:39] religious terms
[1:23:41] but if I couldn't take his hand
[1:23:42] afterwards no matter how sharp the thing
[1:23:45] might be
[1:23:46] and take a hold of his hand and say this
[1:23:49] is in the light of a better
[1:23:51] understanding
[1:23:53] see and still love that person not just
[1:23:57] from the lips
[1:23:59] but from my heart
[1:24:02] they know then I'm no subject at all to
[1:24:05] go out there and try to talk to people
[1:24:07] because you see we must do that we must
[1:24:12] love that person
[1:24:16] and going among people in all kinds of
[1:24:19] classes and different Cults and Clans
[1:24:23] and religions and so forth and trying to
[1:24:26] lay the Bible down
[1:24:28] let's discuss it not from your Creed or
[1:24:30] from a book of Ethics but from the Bible
[1:24:35] but if I got one thought that I didn't
[1:24:39] like that person
[1:24:41] then I know one thing the spirit of
[1:24:44] Christ has departed from me
[1:24:48] there's one thing that's precious to a
[1:24:50] Christian and that is the spirit of
[1:24:53] Christ
[1:24:56] regardless of what you do
[1:24:58] we must not grieve the spirit of Christ
[1:25:02] see
[1:25:04] if I can feel that I don't like that
[1:25:07] person
[1:25:08] there's something wrong with me
[1:25:13] because the spirit of Christ
[1:25:15] when they were crucifying him
[1:25:18] and his own people driving the nails
[1:25:21] you know sometimes I try to picture
[1:25:24] that nails that steel being driven with
[1:25:27] a hammer through the palms of a human
[1:25:30] being it was a very cruel death yeah
[1:25:34] that Jesus died
[1:25:36] they were driving the nail through the
[1:25:38] hands of Emmanuel
[1:25:40] he was none other than God
[1:25:44] he said he's very creation that he
[1:25:46] created was putting the nails that he
[1:25:49] created back into human flesh
[1:25:54] and yet with a heart full of love he
[1:25:57] cried father forgive them
[1:26:00] for they know not what they are doing
[1:26:04] the prophet says I've come to a spot I
[1:26:07] believe that people don't know what they
[1:26:09] are doing
[1:26:11] those are the people that we bump
[1:26:12] shoulders with every day
[1:26:15] you see this is what he says further
[1:26:18] it comes he says look like it's become
[1:26:21] such a subject of evil
[1:26:25] it's a pathetic thing it seems like
[1:26:28] there's a shadow of Darkness just over
[1:26:31] the people that presses them
[1:26:35] so besides the fact of the birth
[1:26:40] their natural birth
[1:26:42] the contamination of the spirits that's
[1:26:44] upon them there's also the darkness of
[1:26:46] the hour that's pressing upon the people
[1:26:51] that's why the people are not by the
[1:26:54] right mind
[1:26:55] the only people that has sanity today is
[1:26:58] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:27:01] Prophet says the only love that they'll
[1:27:03] be in the world today is amongst the
[1:27:05] saints of God the bride of Christ
[1:27:08] amen he says here
[1:27:13] like for instance
[1:27:16] One Thing Crossing the nation around and
[1:27:19] speaking the Lord God identifying
[1:27:21] vindicating his word and showing that
[1:27:23] exactly
[1:27:24] and never let nothings be said unless it
[1:27:27] comes to pass exactly
[1:27:29] he says speaking it right out into
[1:27:31] existence and so forth as he has been
[1:27:36] doing
[1:27:38] and people sit and look at that and
[1:27:40] continue right on in the same condition
[1:27:44] America should have been a different
[1:27:47] country today
[1:27:48] because of what God has done through the
[1:27:51] ministry of the prophet
[1:27:53] but she's missed the day of a visitation
[1:27:56] amen it's the grace of God that has got
[1:27:59] us here this morning
[1:28:01] God has given you eyes to see as we have
[1:28:03] heard this morning and years to hear
[1:28:05] Jesus says blessed are your eyes for
[1:28:08] they see blessed are your ears for what
[1:28:11] they have heard unto you it has given
[1:28:13] the kingdom
[1:28:14] you have a a sane mind
[1:28:17] you think positive you think on the
[1:28:20] things of God
[1:28:22] he says here and people said and look
[1:28:24] see not disregarding but like our
[1:28:27] sisters many times when I speak to them
[1:28:30] about wearing those clothes
[1:28:32] and cutting the hair and little things
[1:28:36] and man how they'll continue on in the
[1:28:39] creeds and serve under those Creeds and
[1:28:42] things and they're good people they're
[1:28:44] fine people but yet it seems like they
[1:28:48] can't understand
[1:28:49] look like they can't get it I go back
[1:28:52] the next year and instead of being any
[1:28:54] better it's worse
[1:28:58] see it continues on here's a sister that
[1:29:01] once had lovely long hair she cut it off
[1:29:04] here's a man that once looked like he
[1:29:07] took his stand and went out for the
[1:29:09] thing that was right
[1:29:11] he's right back like a dog to his vomit
[1:29:15] see it seems like there's something that
[1:29:18] has struck our people
[1:29:20] it struck the world that they don't seem
[1:29:23] to have the understanding there's
[1:29:26] something wrong
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] we go to the restaurants
[1:29:32] we meet you see different people
[1:29:35] but people are just they are basically
[1:29:38] influenced by the spirit of the day
[1:29:41] see what they weigh what they how they
[1:29:44] speak how they conduct themselves and
[1:29:46] you as a Christians you've got to go
[1:29:48] there
[1:29:49] but as Christians we've got to shine
[1:29:51] with his darkest is the best place to
[1:29:54] Shine the Light to show that you are a
[1:29:56] son and a daughter of God Amen so people
[1:30:00] do not know what they are doing
[1:30:03] because of their natural genealogy
[1:30:07] and the shadow of Darkness of the hour
[1:30:09] is upon them
[1:30:11] see
[1:30:13] so they cannot help for being in the
[1:30:16] condition that they are
[1:30:18] because of their natural birth
[1:30:21] their natural family genealogy so what
[1:30:25] they need is this genealogy of God
[1:30:29] to override that see the natural they
[1:30:33] need a new birth
[1:30:36] and you go to all the churches brothers
[1:30:38] and sisters these things are not taught
[1:30:40] any longer it's more psychology
[1:30:43] philosophy amen but the only place
[1:30:46] you'll hear these things is in the
[1:30:48] confines of the message of the hour you
[1:30:50] must be born again there must be a
[1:30:53] change there's got to be a difference
[1:30:55] amen so there's a spirit of forgiveness
[1:30:58] only in the word bride
[1:31:01] she has the spirit of God with inner
[1:31:05] only the bride can forgive
[1:31:09] amen the prophecies in questions and
[1:31:12] answers
[1:31:13] in law having a shadow
[1:31:16] I want to listen to you to listen very
[1:31:17] carefully what he says here
[1:31:19] forgiving humble spirit
[1:31:23] that's the way we want to be
[1:31:27] that's the way we got to be
[1:31:31] if we ever make the rapture
[1:31:34] you say well forgiveness is part of it
[1:31:36] yes faith is based on forgiveness
[1:31:41] so if we want to make the rapture we
[1:31:43] have to have a forgiving humble spirit
[1:31:48] brother Brian says further now when you
[1:31:50] get like that
[1:31:52] I'll say your Coming Night unto the Holy
[1:31:56] Spirit
[1:31:58] because even sometimes we teach you've
[1:32:01] got to jump you've got to shout you've
[1:32:03] got to make a noise and everything
[1:32:05] teaching that as being the evidence of
[1:32:07] the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] but the Holy Ghost is the life
[1:32:12] the message is not a lot of information
[1:32:15] the message has got to become a life
[1:32:18] we've seen that life lived in our
[1:32:20] prophets the messenger of the hour and
[1:32:23] if that message produced that kind of a
[1:32:25] life in the prophet and that same
[1:32:27] message will produce the same kind of a
[1:32:29] life in you
[1:32:31] Hallelujah you see because every message
[1:32:34] is what he lived
[1:32:36] amen he says in the message spiritual
[1:32:39] food in due season and I want you to get
[1:32:42] built up
[1:32:44] this holy Oracles of God in the faith of
[1:32:47] this hour
[1:32:49] it's going to take more faith than any
[1:32:52] that there ever was in any other age
[1:32:56] for this has to be rapturing faith
[1:33:01] and I would say it was rapturing Faith
[1:33:03] you've got to have rapturing forgiveness
[1:33:06] amen
[1:33:08] Hallelujah and so we want to believe
[1:33:11] tonight that in all that we have seen
[1:33:13] and heard the word that you have heard
[1:33:16] preached the signs and the Wonders that
[1:33:19] you have seen done we want you to
[1:33:21] accumulate all that together in your
[1:33:24] heart
[1:33:25] and considerate whether it be of God or
[1:33:29] not
[1:33:31] and we can all give witness that was not
[1:33:33] other than God himself
[1:33:36] Hallelujah he says here in Abram's Grace
[1:33:40] Covenant we which are alive shall be
[1:33:43] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:33:45] an eye an old man will be young
[1:33:48] an old woman will be young and we'll be
[1:33:52] conditioned
[1:33:54] remember I spoke about that word last
[1:33:55] night condition what does the word
[1:33:57] condition mean to bring something into a
[1:34:00] desired state for use
[1:34:03] and God has given us this message
[1:34:05] to bring us to a desired state to be
[1:34:08] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:34:11] eye
[1:34:12] he says rapturing faith is in the
[1:34:15] message
[1:34:16] and these are one of the
[1:34:18] requirements is in the message
[1:34:21] forgiveness
[1:34:23] amen to meet the promised coming son
[1:34:26] Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's
[1:34:29] honor
[1:34:31] so we find brother and sister that in
[1:34:33] the final stages of the bride's mission
[1:34:36] on Earth
[1:34:38] to make the Rapture she must come to a
[1:34:41] place where she says father forgive them
[1:34:45] for they know not what they are doing
[1:34:48] in other words they don't know who they
[1:34:51] are
[1:34:53] they cannot help for being the condition
[1:34:55] that they are
[1:34:57] because of the hour and the time that we
[1:35:00] are living in
[1:35:01] so when she becomes him she manifests
[1:35:05] the spirit of forgiveness
[1:35:08] she so we won't make the match as a
[1:35:11] Rapture with a baggage of unforgiveness
[1:35:14] you've got a problem with this one
[1:35:16] you've got a problem with that one you
[1:35:17] still got you know forgive this one and
[1:35:19] you are not prepared to forgive this one
[1:35:20] and you know there are still issues that
[1:35:23] so there's a baggage of unforgiveness
[1:35:25] upon you
[1:35:27] we must take the example of Jesus
[1:35:30] father forgive them for they know not
[1:35:33] what they are doing
[1:35:35] we must have rapturing faith and faith
[1:35:39] is based on forgiveness
[1:35:43] now brother Branham says you're in
[1:35:44] perfect faith I actually got this
[1:35:45] inspiration when I listened to this
[1:35:48] message
[1:35:49] perfect faith he says Jesus answering
[1:35:52] them said have faith
[1:35:54] for verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:35:57] shall say to this mountain now if you
[1:35:59] read the scripture we find that Jesus
[1:36:01] first says if you say to this mountain
[1:36:03] be moved and don't doubt but believe
[1:36:06] whatever you said you can have
[1:36:07] whatsoever you have said
[1:36:10] but in the verse immediately after that
[1:36:12] statement he says when you stand praying
[1:36:15] forgive
[1:36:17] so if you do not forgive you cannot move
[1:36:20] the mountain
[1:36:21] amen
[1:36:23] see
[1:36:26] therefore I say unto you whatsoever
[1:36:28] things you desire When you pray believe
[1:36:31] that you receive them and when you stand
[1:36:33] praying forgive
[1:36:36] if you have ought against any that your
[1:36:39] father Also may forgive you
[1:36:42] so we find that the little key thing if
[1:36:45] you do not forgive
[1:36:46] now God in human flesh said your father
[1:36:50] will not forgive you either
[1:36:52] if you do not want to forgive
[1:36:59] see
[1:37:02] but if you do not forgive neither will
[1:37:05] your father which is in heaven forgive
[1:37:07] your trespasses
[1:37:10] now the prophet says now faith is based
[1:37:12] on forgiveness
[1:37:14] scripture says faith worketh by love
[1:37:19] so I worked up a little formula
[1:37:21] for the Rapture is love
[1:37:24] forgiveness
[1:37:25] faith
[1:37:26] they are both on that
[1:37:30] two tears Faith worketh by love and
[1:37:33] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:37:36] so you've got to have love
[1:37:38] forgiveness and faith
[1:37:41] would be equal to the rapture
[1:37:43] Amen brother Branham says and then when
[1:37:46] we say to this moon this morning trying
[1:37:49] to get to a church to a place where we
[1:37:51] could really see the apostolic times
[1:37:54] moving Among Us
[1:37:55] that's what we all hunger
[1:37:58] it's just laying right at the door we
[1:38:01] see it but we want to see more of it
[1:38:05] we want such a flow that will be help us
[1:38:09] flow out to others amen there's a
[1:38:13] proverb that says to uh is human
[1:38:17] but to forgive is divine
[1:38:20] forgiveness is a Divine attribute of God
[1:38:25] only the Holy Ghost gives you the
[1:38:27] ability
[1:38:28] to forgive
[1:38:31] the prophet once learned a dear lesson
[1:38:33] when he went to an ordinary little
[1:38:35] restaurant
[1:38:37] he says he walked into the restaurant
[1:38:40] and he looked and there through the
[1:38:43] policeman with his arm around the woman
[1:38:46] playing a slot machine
[1:38:49] Prophet said he was about his age he
[1:38:51] probably had family at home and Jay was
[1:38:54] in the restaurant with his arm around
[1:38:56] the woman amen playing a slot machine
[1:39:00] and as you look further back into the
[1:39:02] restaurant
[1:39:03] you saw young boys drinking and abusing
[1:39:06] a young girl
[1:39:08] and then his eyes saw something else in
[1:39:11] the restaurant
[1:39:12] a woman about 65 years old
[1:39:16] sitting with old clothes on
[1:39:19] with a purple makeup on a mouth now you
[1:39:22] know as you get older the hand is not so
[1:39:24] steady anymore you can imagine how it
[1:39:26] must have been around here trying to get
[1:39:29] the straight lines and so
[1:39:31] and on her toenails was also the purple
[1:39:33] maker
[1:39:35] and her arms were flabby with a boy's
[1:39:38] haircut with the Kinky Curls
[1:39:41] she was busy lighting a cigarette
[1:39:44] and she had two drunken men that were
[1:39:46] standing with her
[1:39:48] and the prophet said oh God how can you
[1:39:51] look at the thing such as that
[1:39:54] little Sarah and Rebecca is going to
[1:39:57] have to be raised in a world like that
[1:40:01] God why don't you just destroy it
[1:40:05] and while the prophet stood there
[1:40:07] criticizing the woman
[1:40:10] he felt something tugging him
[1:40:12] and he went to sit in a little booth
[1:40:15] and God showed him a vision
[1:40:18] and he looked and he saw the world
[1:40:21] and around the world was a red streak
[1:40:25] like a streak of spray you know when you
[1:40:27] spray aerosol you get a spray a streak
[1:40:30] in the air
[1:40:31] amen and this was he said this was the
[1:40:34] blood of Jesus
[1:40:36] who died to save sinners
[1:40:41] and the prophet says this is the reason
[1:40:43] that God could not destroy her
[1:40:47] because every Mortal being has a right
[1:40:51] to Salvation
[1:40:54] see and you as a mortal you've got to
[1:40:57] make your decision
[1:40:59] see until that day comes where you go
[1:41:02] beyond the blood and then you've got to
[1:41:04] face the judgments of God
[1:41:06] but while you're upon the Earth that
[1:41:08] blood protects you until the day that
[1:41:11] you accept Jesus as your savior
[1:41:13] see the one you accept the blood you
[1:41:17] don't have to stand in the judgments of
[1:41:19] God
[1:41:20] you see and they uh because you have
[1:41:24] already judged so we find that as long
[1:41:27] as we are here we have a right to the
[1:41:29] Tree of Life
[1:41:32] the prophet saw the Lord Jesus in a
[1:41:35] vision
[1:41:36] he saw the Thorns around his Brown
[1:41:40] he saw the drunken
[1:41:43] spit of soldiers hanging on his face
[1:41:48] and as he hung there he was jerking
[1:41:51] and the prophet says what is that my
[1:41:54] Lord
[1:41:55] and he says that is your son
[1:41:59] the prophet saw the blood of Jesus
[1:42:01] acting as a bumper for his sins
[1:42:05] if it went beyond the stream of the
[1:42:07] blood that was around the earth God
[1:42:10] would have killed him
[1:42:13] and the stream of blood was like a
[1:42:15] bumper
[1:42:16] and the bump is used to protect the car
[1:42:18] from being damaged amen it catches the
[1:42:22] blows
[1:42:23] if you knock the bumper it's easy to
[1:42:25] replace the bumper but if you knock to
[1:42:27] the vehicle of course it's going to be
[1:42:28] more costly to you and the blood of
[1:42:31] Jesus catches our sin and cries out
[1:42:34] father forgive them
[1:42:36] they know not what they are doing
[1:42:38] the prophet saw his name written in a
[1:42:41] little old book
[1:42:43] he was condemned by the judgments of God
[1:42:46] because God recorded everything that he
[1:42:49] had done wrong
[1:42:50] and the prophet crawled up to the feet
[1:42:52] of Jesus and said Lord Jesus will you
[1:42:55] forgive me
[1:42:57] I didn't mean to do it
[1:43:00] see he said Jesus took his hand dipped
[1:43:03] it in his side and he wrote across the
[1:43:05] book pardoned
[1:43:07] he looked at the prophet and said I
[1:43:10] forgive you didn't I
[1:43:12] and the prophet said yes Lord I love you
[1:43:15] and he says but why are you condemning
[1:43:18] her then
[1:43:20] you were condemned once yourself
[1:43:24] and he freely pardoned you
[1:43:26] and the prophet says
[1:43:28] his motive change from that very moment
[1:43:33] forgiveness became a revelation to the
[1:43:37] prophet
[1:43:39] to show that God was showing the prophet
[1:43:42] he said he has such a mighty Ministry
[1:43:44] but he couldn't have such a Ministry
[1:43:46] without forgiveness
[1:43:48] he was preparing him for the next phase
[1:43:51] of the ministry to meet the angels and
[1:43:54] he had to come through that school
[1:43:57] Hallelujah may the Lord give us a
[1:44:00] revelation of forgiveness this morning
[1:44:02] Alleluia
[1:44:04] there was another occasion where the
[1:44:06] Prophet was put to the test
[1:44:08] unforgiveness
[1:44:10] he says in a message speak to this
[1:44:12] mountain I stepped out to one side and
[1:44:15] the spirit of the Lord came upon me
[1:44:17] and I'll begin to shake and the spirit
[1:44:21] of the Lord said there's a trap set for
[1:44:24] you
[1:44:25] and be thou careful what you say
[1:44:30] and we left there and I told Brother
[1:44:32] softman something's fixing to happen
[1:44:35] and when we got to the meeting that
[1:44:37] night I said to the audience remember
[1:44:40] thus saith the Lord
[1:44:43] there is a trap that is set for me
[1:44:47] and all of you pray that I'll know what
[1:44:50] to do the right thing when that comes to
[1:44:53] pass
[1:44:54] and the next night it happened
[1:44:57] the devil sent two people
[1:44:59] a young boy and a girl to break the
[1:45:03] meeting
[1:45:05] and so we were in the meeting
[1:45:07] this girl looked like a kind of
[1:45:09] Mongolian
[1:45:11] but the boy was just holding
[1:45:15] they were both at least 25 years of
[1:45:18] peace
[1:45:19] but such immoral acts in the church
[1:45:23] they were sitting about this far from me
[1:45:26] and I started preaching he would just
[1:45:29] grab her and throw her head back and
[1:45:32] climb up on her and kiss her and Carry
[1:45:34] On and just act awful in the meetings
[1:45:39] and the ashes couldn't make him be quiet
[1:45:42] and I said to him from the platform I
[1:45:44] said young man don't do that you're
[1:45:47] attracting attention
[1:45:49] while I'm preaching and he just left and
[1:45:53] right at that time
[1:45:55] I thought oh oh there it is there's the
[1:45:59] Trap right there
[1:46:02] I went right ahead speaking just the
[1:46:04] same
[1:46:05] and oh he got Immortal with her
[1:46:08] tell her I had to stop again and said
[1:46:10] don't do that sir
[1:46:12] if you want to make love to the young
[1:46:14] lady then you leave the building
[1:46:17] but this is a religious meeting and I
[1:46:20] said you shouldn't do that don't please
[1:46:22] don't do that while I'm preaching I
[1:46:25] started again and it just made it worse
[1:46:30] and then I said don't and something said
[1:46:34] to me say what you will
[1:46:36] and it will be done
[1:46:39] I stood there Mr Mercer the table and
[1:46:42] all of them standing by the Fred and
[1:46:44] many of them standing present the
[1:46:47] perspiration was just running all over
[1:46:48] me something said say blindness it will
[1:46:51] be blind
[1:46:52] say death and they'll pack them out say
[1:46:56] what you will I couldn't speak I
[1:46:58] couldn't move and I just left
[1:47:01] I thought God what must I do
[1:47:04] and I turned and he stood and there his
[1:47:09] face white looking at me
[1:47:11] I thought what must I say then I turned
[1:47:14] and looked like before
[1:47:16] I knowed what I said
[1:47:20] see
[1:47:21] what I had said I said I forgive you for
[1:47:25] your act see
[1:47:29] he said before I know what I have said
[1:47:34] in other words the Holy Ghost absolutely
[1:47:37] Beyond his thinking the Holy Ghost came
[1:47:41] and it must have been just the right
[1:47:43] thing to say
[1:47:45] it was God trying a reaction on an
[1:47:49] action
[1:47:50] that night it was revealed to me that I
[1:47:53] said the right thing
[1:47:56] I know it was all leading to something
[1:47:58] but what was it what to do you know you
[1:48:04] have to watch with a Divine gift what
[1:48:07] you do with it
[1:48:09] remember what Moses did God said go and
[1:48:12] speak to the Rock and he went to Smite
[1:48:14] The Rock Moses was the prophet God had
[1:48:17] to do whatever the prophet said
[1:48:19] or did amen and God wouldn't allow Moses
[1:48:22] to go to the promised land because of
[1:48:25] what the act that he did a Divine gift
[1:48:28] that got him into trouble
[1:48:31] amen for you know John the young John
[1:48:35] wanted to burn up some area
[1:48:38] one time
[1:48:40] because they wouldn't feed them
[1:48:42] Jesus says you don't know what kind of a
[1:48:44] spirit you are
[1:48:45] the son of man came to save life not to
[1:48:50] destroy it I actually went to the
[1:48:52] scripture to read what Jesus actually
[1:48:55] said in John chapter 12 verses 47 to 48.
[1:48:59] he says if any man hear my words and
[1:49:02] believe not I judge him not
[1:49:06] remember when he came
[1:49:07] he came as Savior
[1:49:10] he came not as the judge
[1:49:13] but he came to forgive
[1:49:15] he came to love
[1:49:17] he came to die for the sins of the world
[1:49:20] that's why I said I came not to judge
[1:49:23] but to save the world
[1:49:26] that's when they brought that woman that
[1:49:28] was caught in the act of adultery
[1:49:30] they brought her to Jesus and said Jesus
[1:49:34] what do you say
[1:49:35] she was caught in the act now according
[1:49:38] to the law she had to be stoned
[1:49:40] but he said to them If any man
[1:49:44] have the I have no son that him caused
[1:49:47] the first stone
[1:49:49] and when he turned up he said that
[1:49:51] everybody was gone
[1:49:53] and he asked the woman where are your
[1:49:55] accusers
[1:49:56] she said they are all gone
[1:49:58] he says neither do I
[1:50:01] condemned me
[1:50:02] why he did not come as judge
[1:50:06] but he came as the savior
[1:50:08] he came to forgive
[1:50:11] see he said he that rejected me and
[1:50:14] received not my words has one thing that
[1:50:17] one that judges him the word which I
[1:50:20] have spoken
[1:50:22] that's what the very message that we
[1:50:24] believe that will give us rapturing
[1:50:25] faith it's the same message that will
[1:50:28] condemn the world
[1:50:29] the message that will the world will be
[1:50:31] judged by is the message of the hour
[1:50:35] the message that they have rejected amen
[1:50:39] Hallelujah so they'll be judged by the
[1:50:42] word that God has sent in this hour
[1:50:46] see the word that I've spoken the same
[1:50:49] shall judge him in the last day
[1:50:52] see and brother Brandon says then
[1:50:54] scriptures keep pouring over all night I
[1:50:57] didn't sleep but that was a step that
[1:51:00] Satan would get me all worked up and
[1:51:03] then make me say something wrong but the
[1:51:07] Holy Spirit was there and told me
[1:51:09] beforehand to be careful
[1:51:12] he says oh for the goodness of God
[1:51:16] amen amen I think they sing a song
[1:51:17] nowadays oh for the goodness of God Amen
[1:51:21] I'm kept by the goodness of God I'm
[1:51:24] saved by the goodness of God we are all
[1:51:26] sitting here this morning because of the
[1:51:29] goodness of God if it wasn't for the
[1:51:32] goodness of God we would not be here
[1:51:33] this morning
[1:51:35] Hallelujah the prophet says just his
[1:51:37] mercy be careful what you said and from
[1:51:40] then on there was a relief come I begin
[1:51:43] to notice the different things that I
[1:51:45] would speak out unconsciously not
[1:51:48] knowing what I said
[1:51:51] and it would happen that way I begin to
[1:51:55] speak
[1:51:56] about it
[1:51:58] now one would might ask the question
[1:52:00] where did unforgiveness have a beginning
[1:52:04] it started in the Book of Genesis
[1:52:08] God said the day you eat thereof
[1:52:11] that day you shall die
[1:52:15] and When sin come in
[1:52:18] sin came in because of disobedience
[1:52:21] and the prophet says that it separated
[1:52:24] Divine love
[1:52:26] God told Adam and Eve not to eat of the
[1:52:29] fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good
[1:52:31] and Evil
[1:52:32] so what did son do it brought a
[1:52:34] separation
[1:52:36] between the love of God and man
[1:52:39] and it brought him and envy and strife
[1:52:43] and Division
[1:52:44] yeah amen because the love of God was no
[1:52:47] longer there
[1:52:48] Prophet says when you separate Divine
[1:52:50] love then you can't look at your
[1:52:52] brother's mistakes anymore
[1:52:54] you cannot say you do not know what you
[1:52:57] are doing
[1:52:58] you ball him out see you cannot Overlook
[1:53:01] a sister's mistakes because you got away
[1:53:05] from the Divine part that's right amen
[1:53:09] the love part but he says we are really
[1:53:12] love the Lord if the brother or sister
[1:53:14] does something wrong to you you will say
[1:53:17] oh well you didn't mean to do it it
[1:53:21] takes the grace of God to tell somebody
[1:53:23] that if they've done something wrong to
[1:53:24] you
[1:53:25] I forgive you you didn't mean to do it
[1:53:29] you know and I believe that God showed
[1:53:32] his feeling to the world
[1:53:34] when he represented himself in Jesus
[1:53:38] he expressed his nature to the human
[1:53:41] race to forgive and to love those who
[1:53:45] are unlovable
[1:53:46] amen and God revealed his divine nature
[1:53:50] to the end time messenger
[1:53:52] so that we could understand the feelings
[1:53:55] of God to love and to forgive
[1:53:58] amen all these little stories that
[1:54:00] brother Bram told us it was his
[1:54:03] experience the love of God forgiveness
[1:54:06] how that we have to follow walk that
[1:54:09] same path as he will Prophet said Jesus
[1:54:12] was the first representation of love
[1:54:16] that ever
[1:54:17] was on the Earth
[1:54:19] he was the spies of Those whom he loved
[1:54:23] no man ever loved like him
[1:54:26] and no man was ever hated like him
[1:54:30] they hated him despised him they
[1:54:33] rejected him but he did not stop his
[1:54:35] love
[1:54:36] Isaiah 53 says he's despised and
[1:54:39] rejected of men
[1:54:41] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[1:54:44] grief
[1:54:45] and we heed as it were our faces from
[1:54:47] him he was despised and we esteemed him
[1:54:51] not
[1:54:52] you know what the word esteem means
[1:54:54] respected honored
[1:54:57] revered valued admired we did not admire
[1:55:01] him you know we like to be
[1:55:04] respected and revered and acknowledged
[1:55:07] but Jesus Emmanuel God With Us we
[1:55:12] esteemed him not
[1:55:13] he said surely he had borne our grief
[1:55:16] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[1:55:19] esteem him stricken smitten of God and
[1:55:23] afflicted
[1:55:24] but he was wounded for our transgression
[1:55:27] he was bruised for our iniquity the
[1:55:30] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:55:33] and why he stripes we are healed
[1:55:37] Hallelujah
[1:55:39] amen you know what the prophet says that
[1:55:42] he being God understands that's why he
[1:55:46] could love
[1:55:48] that's why he could say father forgive
[1:55:50] them
[1:55:51] they don't know what they are doing
[1:55:53] Isaiah 53 says he was a man of sorrow
[1:55:57] and acquainted with grief
[1:56:01] amen he walked amongst men he dressed
[1:56:05] like ornery men you wouldn't have known
[1:56:07] him from the other men
[1:56:09] amen you could stand in the midst of
[1:56:11] congregation and he could speak
[1:56:13] brother Brandon says when he spoke is
[1:56:15] like the words coming from his very
[1:56:17] heart he spoke it with deep sincerity
[1:56:21] Hallelujah it was the words coming from
[1:56:24] his heart that really knew what he was
[1:56:27] talking about
[1:56:28] did you recognize that Jesus never
[1:56:31] corrected what he said before
[1:56:34] every word he spoke was perfect
[1:56:37] he didn't say well you know I said
[1:56:38] something and I've just come to say I've
[1:56:41] got to correct that no every word was
[1:56:44] God's word every word was perfect even
[1:56:48] the soldiers who came to him they went
[1:56:50] back and said never a man spoke like him
[1:56:54] you could calm the storm Hallelujah you
[1:56:57] could raise the dead why it was God in
[1:57:01] human flesh amen the prophet says we can
[1:57:04] be like him
[1:57:05] he said just get him in your heart he'll
[1:57:08] make you humble when someone smites you
[1:57:10] on the one side of the face God bless
[1:57:13] you brother I know you didn't mean it
[1:57:17] it really takes the grace of God it
[1:57:20] takes a man filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:57:21] you say God bless you amen I know you
[1:57:24] didn't mean it amen they didn't realize
[1:57:28] that they were piercing the hands of
[1:57:30] Emmanuel
[1:57:31] God in human flesh forgiving Hallelujah
[1:57:36] the prophet says that's the way we got
[1:57:38] to be if we ever want to make the
[1:57:42] rapture
[1:57:43] we are preparing for rapturing faith and
[1:57:47] he manifested perfect love for a perfect
[1:57:50] Resurrection when Jesus died upon the
[1:57:53] cross of Calvary the last words that he
[1:57:55] mentioned father forgive them
[1:57:58] because of that forgiveness there was a
[1:58:01] resurrection
[1:58:02] because of forgiveness there was a
[1:58:04] Rapture on the Ascension Day why because
[1:58:08] he could forgive Allelujah him being God
[1:58:12] he died on a cross friendless even
[1:58:14] forsaken by God the prophet says they
[1:58:17] made him a proposition you come of the
[1:58:19] Cross and we will accept you as the
[1:58:21] Messiah not knowing that the Angels were
[1:58:24] sitting amongst the trees as as he was
[1:58:28] hanging upon the cross of calvary
[1:58:30] they said you saved others and yourself
[1:58:32] you cannot save
[1:58:34] but he gave himself for others he came
[1:58:37] as our Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:58:40] amen if he never paid the price there
[1:58:42] would be nobody that was worthy to take
[1:58:44] the book and to lose the seals thereof
[1:58:47] but because that he was the worthy one
[1:58:50] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:58:53] amen as the songwriter says when he was
[1:58:56] on the cross I was on his mind
[1:58:59] hallelujah amen hallelujah and you find
[1:59:03] here as as Paul says though I speak with
[1:59:06] tongue of men and angels and though I
[1:59:09] have faith to move mountains and have
[1:59:11] not
[1:59:11] charity
[1:59:13] I am nothing
[1:59:16] brother and sister it's faith
[1:59:18] forgiveness
[1:59:20] and it's love
[1:59:22] let me just read a little something here
[1:59:23] as we come to the close
[1:59:25] we find here I just want to skip a lot
[1:59:27] of things
[1:59:29] brother Branham says here you know
[1:59:32] that
[1:59:33] so we find that the final stages of the
[1:59:35] bride's mission on Earth
[1:59:38] to make the Rapture she must come to a
[1:59:41] place which is his father forgive them
[1:59:44] they know not what they are doing you
[1:59:47] know we must have rapturing faith and
[1:59:50] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:59:54] Prophet says only perfect love will
[1:59:56] enter in
[1:59:58] perfect love holds no grudges
[2:00:02] perfect love holds no scores to settle
[2:00:07] so there's anything that disturbs your
[2:00:09] spirit you feel anything funny in your
[2:00:11] spirit
[2:00:12] have it sorted out
[2:00:14] amen because with that baggage on you
[2:00:17] you'll never make the rapture
[2:00:19] and I believe we are living in the hour
[2:00:21] of rapture we've got to be cleansed of
[2:00:24] all those contaminations of our family
[2:00:27] lineage of the dispensation we are
[2:00:29] living in we are busy we are in the
[2:00:32] change
[2:00:33] amen a change has come since the opening
[2:00:37] says the visitation of Melchizedek we
[2:00:40] are preparing for to enter a place of
[2:00:43] perfection and only perfect love can
[2:00:47] enter that place and God sent us a
[2:00:50] message to condition us for that place
[2:00:53] to prepare us for that hour of rapturing
[2:00:57] faith
[2:00:58] now can you imagine brother and sister
[2:01:00] looking to a rapture
[2:01:04] and these things will slow on you
[2:01:08] unforgiveness
[2:01:10] you have schools to settle one group
[2:01:12] against the other group you know that's
[2:01:14] man
[2:01:15] but here we have a prophet that came to
[2:01:18] show us get rid of all that baggage
[2:01:21] forgive love amen there's got to be a
[2:01:25] Unity a Oneness the love of God has got
[2:01:27] to unite us together oh love of God how
[2:01:30] rich and pure how fathomless and strong
[2:01:33] it shall forevermore endure the Saints
[2:01:36] an Angel song
[2:01:38] they'd be closed by reading this and I
[2:01:40] Heard a Voice then
[2:01:42] that spoke to me that was in the room
[2:01:45] and says this is what you preached was
[2:01:48] the Holy Ghost
[2:01:51] this is perfect love
[2:01:53] and nothing can enter here without it
[2:01:58] I am more determined than ever in my
[2:02:01] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[2:02:04] there
[2:02:05] there is no jealousy there's no
[2:02:08] tiredness there's no death sickness
[2:02:11] could never be there mortality could
[2:02:14] never make you old and they could not
[2:02:17] cry it was just one big Joy oh my
[2:02:21] precious brother
[2:02:23] we are going to a place of perfection
[2:02:26] and God is conditioning us here to enter
[2:02:29] that place of perfection amen
[2:02:32] forgiveness love hallelujah amen may God
[2:02:37] made us be a help to you
[2:02:40] and what you heard that will help you in
[2:02:43] your Christian walk upon the Earth maybe
[2:02:45] something has opened your eyes this
[2:02:47] morning maybe you never realized
[2:02:49] what does work work entails forgiveness
[2:02:53] love and faith may God does she bless
[2:02:56] you amen
[2:03:02] shall we all stand

[2:07:02] now since
[2:07:06] [Music]
[2:07:14] Powerhouse together
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:27] Jesus laid up
[2:07:29] a parable
[2:07:31] he laid a parable he laid a principle in
[2:07:34] a word where he talks about
[2:07:37] a man that was forgiven
[2:07:41] you know brother Brandon Jesus brought
[2:07:43] the same experience down to brother
[2:07:45] Brandon brother Arrow red brother
[2:07:47] Brandon story theater in the restaurant
[2:07:50] but yet Jesus in his life here on Earth
[2:07:54] tell another story of that about a man
[2:07:57] that was forgiving
[2:07:59] but yet he could not forgive the ones
[2:08:01] that owe him
[2:08:03] lesser penny
[2:08:06] but I think that was that is prominent
[2:08:09] in that story is that Jesus said
[2:08:12] let he be turned over to the tomatoes so
[2:08:16] brother Branham over in the message
[2:08:17] demonology
[2:08:19] make us to realize that tomatoes in the
[2:08:22] Bible are demons
[2:08:24] so he said when we hold unforgiving
[2:08:27] spirit
[2:08:28] in US
[2:08:30] we are subjecting ourselves to demon
[2:08:32] powers
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:34] we are subjecting ourselves
[2:08:37] we are we are relinquishing the liberty
[2:08:41] of the spirit
[2:08:42] to be able to exercise faith
[2:08:45] and then we are giving ourselves over to
[2:08:47] fears and doubts
[2:08:50] and and all of those things
[2:08:55] as humans
[2:08:57] we deal with things we meet with people
[2:09:01] there are things that uh that I've
[2:09:05] hurt us but you see the principle thing
[2:09:08] here
[2:09:09] like our brother share this morning
[2:09:13] you think about it think about it that
[2:09:16] was just that was just before brother
[2:09:18] Branham going into
[2:09:21] the opening of the seals just before he
[2:09:24] could go to that purpose of his life God
[2:09:27] is telling him a trap except for you and
[2:09:29] let me say that to us this morning
[2:09:33] a trap is set for you this word is a
[2:09:36] trap

[2:10:18] things we we the way we deal with it we
[2:10:22] are very embarrassed because it do not
[2:10:24] represent Jesus Christ

[2:24:20] way that he does things
[2:24:22] wow
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:24] talked with him back in 2004. before my
[2:24:28] first trip to South Africa
[2:24:30] and he said brother one you get in South
[2:24:33] Africa let me know after your meetings
[2:24:35] we were having service down in Durban
[2:24:38] and but I think just around that time he
[2:24:42] he lost his brother or his daughter so
[2:24:45] he texts me and oh send me an email and
[2:24:48] said you know because of this who will
[2:24:50] not me but then we kept in contact
[2:24:53] yeah we met towards the early part of
[2:24:57] the 2000s we had a preacher no the later
[2:25:00] part of 2000 I think 2008.
[2:25:03] a convention in Togo together
[2:25:07] he was the principal speaker so we were
[2:25:09] just helping the meetings giving time to
[2:25:12] rest and uh so he said man that we we do
[2:25:16] respect and appreciate
[2:25:18] but send our greetings to to brother
[2:25:20] praise the Lord say brother one say it's
[2:25:23] Salud the next time we are back there we
[2:25:26] will make sure that we stop to see him
[2:25:28] praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's
[2:25:30] stand on our feet
[2:25:31] and uh
[2:25:33] we enjoy the fellowship with our brother
[2:25:36] praise the Lord
[2:25:39] we enjoyed our fellowship you know the
[2:25:41] scripture says blessed are the feet that
[2:25:43] brings good Tiding
[2:25:45] amen so it is not uh it is not uh
[2:25:49] sometimes as a people you know the
[2:25:52] congregation
[2:25:54] can be very selfish you know the the
[2:25:58] just they just look to the place where
[2:26:00] they can kill the preacher you know pull
[2:26:03] everything out of you where you are
[2:26:05] tired struggling for your breath to go
[2:26:06] yeah yeah we enjoy the service but
[2:26:09] sometimes is is uh is is the years of
[2:26:13] experience that the person brings
[2:26:17] a man that has been been following the
[2:26:20] word and living a consecrated life
[2:26:24] think about this brother Branham says
[2:26:26] when when John returned from the island
[2:26:28] of Palm Coast
[2:26:30] he was not a man of
[2:26:32] [Music]
[2:26:34] because of the things that he saw on the
[2:26:37] foreign
[2:26:54] so you see it's not the excitement it's
[2:26:57] not the it's not the emotion
[2:27:00] is
[2:27:01] that it's behind
[2:27:03] because you can get some of these smart
[2:27:05] guys that will come and turn the code
[2:27:06] this way
[2:27:10] praise the Lord
[2:27:12] and they are terrible in their lifetime
[2:27:16] terrible in their lifestyle
[2:27:19] you see some of the things that they are
[2:27:21] doing in the name of the message
[2:27:26] so it's the experience
[2:27:29] is the experience for me
[2:27:31] you know is is more of a blessing for me
[2:27:34] because I learned from those things
[2:27:37] I learned from it
[2:27:39] just sit down with a person talk to them
[2:27:42] there are few things you pick up
[2:27:44] slip them under the fifth rape
[2:27:50] slip it under my fifth rape
[2:27:53] but the Lord bless you let's go in the
[2:27:55] Peace of the Lord I love to see you on
