[16:06] evening
[16:08] brother motifs
[16:12] from philadelphia
[16:15] a little baby melody has not been
[16:18] feeling well
[16:23] even though i spoke to the mother a
[16:26] couple of days ago then
[16:28] and she said the baby's
[16:33] doing much better but
[16:36] there is a birth problem there that we
[16:40] want to constantly bring before the lord
[16:42] they trust in the lord that god will
[16:47] give the child a miracle praise the lord
[16:50] so we want to pray for that
[16:53] little baby harmony her name is harmony
[16:58] so let's just remember a little harmony
[17:01] tonight
[17:02] and those young brothers over in
[17:06] uh mohair
[17:09] uh
[17:12] down here and moses they're having one
[17:16] of their school me
[17:17] a friend from zimbabwe also
[17:20] that is sick in the hospital with a
[17:22] stroke
[17:24] and
[17:28] really not knowing what caused a stroke
[17:32] but i believe is most of stress
[17:35] you know worry and
[17:38] away from home and parents and dealing
[17:42] with
[17:43] some difficulties could cause some of
[17:45] those things
[17:47] and they want us to remember him
[17:50] also in prayer tonight so let's
[17:55] we want to bring those two
[17:58] needs tonight that's what we have as
[18:02] uh our prayer burden for the night
[18:05] and we also want to continue to pray
[18:09] thanking the lord with the
[18:13] statistics we will hear from brother
[18:14] scared on sunday
[18:16] hopefully as he brings to us our monthly
[18:20] statistics but with the general news
[18:24] it looks like things are beginning to
[18:27] flatten
[18:29] many people are
[18:30] [Music]
[18:33] recovering and
[18:36] we want to thank the lord for that
[18:37] praise the lord
[18:39] and so we want to appreciate the lord
[18:42] and continue to pray for those that are
[18:45] in need
[18:46] those that are needing our
[18:49] our prayers needing the touch from the
[18:52] lord
[18:53] i was listening to a news report of a
[18:56] nurse
[18:57] and she was
[19:01] really on the front line
[19:04] in the hospital going from room to room
[19:06] doing all the vital signs
[19:08] and and in the midst of that she
[19:12] got sick and then when she got sick
[19:16] i mean she had been in the hospital for
[19:18] months her situation was so
[19:21] critical until she got blood clogs
[19:24] and she was not having blood flowing to
[19:27] her hands
[19:29] and she's beginning to recover
[19:33] but when she recover finally she will
[19:36] have to lose some of her fingers
[19:38] because of the effect of the blood clock
[19:41] so
[19:44] people are dealing with all of this in
[19:47] different ways some
[19:48] people financially without a
[19:52] job without enough finites to take care
[19:56] of their children

[42:41] just for a minute here jordan i can't

[42:45] of weird you can be seated musicians
[42:47] um all right it's uh
[42:51] it's good to be back it's uh once again
[42:53] just well done on the
[42:54] building and all the work that's been
[42:56] done i'm just super super impressed
[42:58] i guess if well never mind if brother
[43:01] one says he
[43:03] talks about me and he's like well i
[43:04] think of him like my son i'm like
[43:07] all you musicians all the sound people i
[43:10] look at you like my son
[43:11] so i'm very very glad i'm very proud of
[43:14] everybody
[43:14] so i'm very very happy
[43:17] i'm very happy and you know it's funny
[43:20] because there's only a few of us around
[43:22] still that remember when
[43:23] when this place was when i started
[43:26] leading songs all we had
[43:29] was this and then mom started jumping on
[43:32] the guitar
[43:33] this is all we had we broke these things
[43:35] like i literally
[43:36] see look oh yeah good job actually i
[43:38] think i broke most of these off here
[43:40] before i left
[43:41] so um we broke tambourines we bloodied
[43:44] our knuckles on the pulpit
[43:46] and really the the genesis of that came
[43:50] about
[43:50] it's just amazing i mean we had 12
[43:52] people i think it was the
[43:54] the final count and we just saw
[43:56] ourselves
[43:57] as the mighty church of ephesus of 12
[44:00] people and like we're not going to quit
[44:02] there's a lot of people that thought you
[44:03] know wrote us off as a church that's you
[44:05] know they're just a renegade church they
[44:06] don't want a pastor they're just going
[44:08] to go crazy and they're eventually going
[44:09] to fall away
[44:11] but there was something here there was
[44:13] something
[44:14] here and we couldn't deny that you know
[44:17] there was plenty of evidence that you
[44:19] know
[44:20] cassidy should have gone somewhere we
[44:21] should have gone somewhere like it
[44:23] should have just dissolved i mean that
[44:24] by
[44:25] argue by reason it should have all just
[44:28] dissolved
[44:30] but it didn't because god had
[44:33] a reason god has a reason and we just
[44:36] want to talk about that
[44:37] a little bit tonight let's stand and
[44:38] we'll just read the text and then we'll
[44:40] uh go into a few things here
[44:42] there's no clock up there so you guys
[44:44] bear with me i
[44:45] i'm gonna pretend to not see the clock
[44:47] on my laptop here
[44:49] amen we're just going to turn over to
[44:51] psalms 23 it's a very familiar passage
[44:54] many of us can speak it
[44:56] or recite it by heart but as i always
[44:59] say and i say this for myself as much as
[45:01] anyone
[45:02] i want us to look at these scriptures as
[45:04] if we've never heard them before
[45:06] and the reason why is that when we've
[45:08] nev when when you've never
[45:10] heard something before you pay attention
[45:13] and you don't miss things you don't miss
[45:15] what god wants to show you if you're
[45:18] there say amen
[45:20] the lord is my shepherd i
[45:23] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[45:27] in green pastures he leadeth me beside
[45:31] the still waters he restoreth
[45:35] my soul let's pray dear lord father we
[45:39] just come before you
[45:40] tonight lord god
[45:44] father recognizing our own insufficiency
[45:47] father
[45:47] certainly for myself lord god father in
[45:49] my own strength i've got no business
[45:51] being up here father but
[45:53] we don't look to that we don't find our
[45:55] certainty in our own ability we find it
[45:57] in your word
[45:59] father and you said that where two or
[46:01] three are gathered in your name
[46:02] you'd be there and that's what we're
[46:04] trusting on god that you will come
[46:07] and you will speak your word to us
[46:10] father help us to pay attention and hear
[46:13] what you have to say tonight
[46:15] commit into your hands in the name of
[46:17] jesus christ
[46:19] amen you may be seated he restoreth my
[46:22] soul will continue reading the rest of
[46:23] the chapter
[46:24] he leadeth me in the paths of
[46:26] righteousness for his name's sake
[46:29] yea though i walk through the valley of
[46:32] the shadow of death
[46:33] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[46:37] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[46:41] that prepares the table before me in the
[46:43] presence of mine enemies yes
[46:45] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[46:48] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[46:52] shall follow me all the days of my life
[46:54] and i will dwell in the house of the
[46:56] lord forever

[47:24] we'd already be blessed if we were if we
[47:26] really were
[47:27] in that if we put ourselves in this but

[47:54] yeah everyone is here has seen that
[47:56] happen um
[47:58] so um anyways apologize
[48:02] so i uh i obviously don't live here
[48:04] anymore i moved to tennessee and uh
[48:07] my name is loyal and i believe in praise
[48:10] i believe in praise if there's one thing
[48:13] that i just i believe in and so we want
[48:15] to give god glory tonight
[48:16] um i moved and really it it was a long
[48:21] process and a journey for me to come to
[48:23] that decision
[48:24] the reason so i was here um just to kind
[48:26] of catch up to speed i was here in
[48:28] minnesota
[48:29] you know once again we had a bunch of
[48:31] years with 12 of us
[48:33] and for me like in my heart i was like
[48:34] god i just i'm kind of like i
[48:36] should i move should i go somewhere else
[48:38] and god really worked for me in a
[48:40] supernatural way that i wasn't supposed
[48:42] to i was supposed to be here
[48:43] and um brother cadre diggs was here and
[48:46] i was standing right
[48:47] back there by the door which there's no
[48:49] hallway there anymore um but i was
[48:50] standing in the hallway off and do that
[48:52] i don't i don't like to sit i like to
[48:53] stand
[48:54] comes running and points me in the face
[48:56] and says don't stop don't quit you stay
[48:58] where you are and you grow
[48:59] where you're planted and he didn't know
[49:01] what i was praying about he didn't know
[49:02] anything i was standing back there and i
[49:04] knew i was like telling like god
[49:06] have him come say something to me if if
[49:08] if this is your will
[49:10] and that really emboldened me to you
[49:12] know okay
[49:13] i'm here i'm supposed to do something
[49:15] while i'm here
[49:16] and i would say that to all of you if
[49:18] you're here you're supposed to do
[49:20] something while you're here
[49:22] you're supposed to do something whatever
[49:24] you have find in your hand to do
[49:27] do it with your might do it with all of
[49:30] your heart
[49:31] with all of your might with all of your
[49:33] strength even if that means going to
[49:35] work
[49:36] with all of your might we often times
[49:39] we're so divided in ourselves we want to
[49:42] be here
[49:43] and somewhere else we want to
[49:46] um i'm sorry i'm supposed to be
[49:48] testifying i'm already preaching
[49:51] whatever you do put your whole heart
[49:54] into it and i believe that you know
[49:56] looking around now we
[49:58] see the success if this place has had
[50:01] any success the success comes from a
[50:04] group of people that put
[50:05] everything on the line they put that put
[50:08] our reputations we we
[50:10] came and we wanted to see god
[50:13] and i would encourage you i know brother
[50:14] one you guys are starting a prayer
[50:16] meeting again
[50:19] get a hold of god get a hold of god we
[50:21] saw things here a decade ago
[50:24] in some prayer meetings that were
[50:26] absolutely
[50:27] supernatural and it can happen again it
[50:30] can happen again
[50:32] so i moved to tennessee um and i
[50:34] preached a whole sermon on that so we're
[50:36] not going to go back into it but i
[50:37] very much felt led of god that it needed
[50:40] to happen
[50:41] and i hated to go i love all of you guys
[50:47] and it's been a strange thing it's a
[50:50] strange thing
[50:52] to follow god and what i mean by that is
[50:55] if you look throughout the bible
[50:58] look at abraham god called him out
[51:04] to follow him come into a land that i'll
[51:07] show you
[51:08] and we look at that and it's funny
[51:10] because it would it would
[51:12] one would think i would think
[51:15] everything should just line right up for
[51:17] him everything it should be just
[51:19] you know i mean god told them to go and
[51:21] then of course we know he brought his
[51:22] father with and he brought lot with and
[51:24] these different things
[51:27] but god called him to follow him
[51:33] and so for me i well we'll get into some
[51:36] details as
[51:37] i'm gonna preach and testify at the same
[51:40] time because this
[51:40] it this sermon for me and just bear with
[51:43] me i feel like
[51:45] i finally come to an answer
[51:48] in all of this for me personally
[51:51] and there are so many things that maybe
[51:52] we see we think of it as
[51:55] i thought of growing up in the message
[51:57] as being very cliche
[51:59] just like oh well of course you know i
[52:01] had it up here
[52:02] but god has brought me through things
[52:04] now it's not up here anymore
[52:07] it's here and i've experienced it
[52:10] with him with him
[52:15] so um we'll catch up on some other
[52:18] things as
[52:19] as we go through the sermon uh my most
[52:21] recent adventure
[52:23] before surgery i was decided i was like
[52:26] well i'm down here anyways i don't
[52:28] really know which direction i'm supposed
[52:29] to be going i didn't feel like god had
[52:31] given me a grand
[52:32] mission like i'm supposed to do this
[52:33] like okay well in the meantime i'm going
[52:35] to keep myself busy i'm going to do some
[52:36] stuff and you know whatever i'm going to
[52:38] find a way to make money
[52:39] and all this stuff and i decided why not
[52:42] let's be a white water rafting guide so
[52:44] jordan you can throw that picture up
[52:45] there um if you want
[52:47] how many here has ever been white water
[52:48] rafting
[52:50] yes that means i can tell you anything i
[52:53] want
[52:54] i'm just kidding so what
[52:57] white water rafting is is um
[53:03] it's scary it's scary thanks whoever
[53:05] said that
[53:06] so white water rafting the whole concept
[53:08] is you're on a raft you've got six
[53:10] people and you've got a guide there in
[53:11] the back
[53:12] and you go down a section of a river
[53:15] that has rapids in it right
[53:17] the thrill of almost dying is the whole
[53:20] point
[53:21] there are class 3 rapids which are
[53:24] likely
[53:24] not to die that's the term they use
[53:27] class four which is
[53:28] potential to die and class five which is
[53:31] likely to die
[53:32] which we didn't train on any class fives
[53:35] but we did train on class fours
[53:37] uh which are our potential to die i mean
[53:40] there's there's a chance you if you
[53:41] don't do things correctly
[53:44] there's a chance and for me i i like to
[53:46] do crazy things um i
[53:47] i don't know i just i enjoy it and god
[53:49] made me that way and
[53:50] i decided well why not let's be this guy
[53:53] in the back of the boat right back there
[53:54] that's
[53:55] that that almost it stirs the thing
[53:58] he stirs the water and it steers the
[54:00] boat i've been to our laser pointer
[54:02] brother steve
[54:04] it's missing gotta find that ah there it
[54:06] is
[54:07] um thanks faith yeah so um
[54:10] so i decided i was gonna be a white
[54:11] water rafting guide and went through
[54:13] a pretty intensive training process and
[54:15] for me like i grew up on the lakes here
[54:17] in minnesota i'm like this is gonna be
[54:18] no big deal
[54:20] but i learned something and what they
[54:22] did
[54:25] they were so good at breaking down what
[54:28] you thought you knew
[54:30] breaking it down and then teaching you
[54:32] the right way and then
[54:33] breaking that down and scaring you to
[54:36] death and then teaching you again they
[54:38] would constantly put you back through
[54:39] these rapids get you to the point where
[54:41] you felt like you'd mastered it
[54:43] and then they'd add another level they'd
[54:44] add another thing like um a concept
[54:47] it's called back ferrying i had no idea
[54:49] what that is it's basically the concept
[54:51] of rowing
[54:52] backwards with your raft to move across
[54:55] the river because
[54:57] a river is going to be pushing you
[54:58] forward that's your propulsion
[55:00] and it typically we think of like a car
[55:02] or a standard boat we're just going to
[55:04] like
[55:04] just turn the boat and the raft is going
[55:06] to you know the water's just going to
[55:07] push you downstream like a
[55:08] like a kayak or a canoe but it's
[55:11] different uh
[55:12] with and there's a lot to learn with a
[55:13] raft you're you're moving
[55:16] it's more like a sail the whole raft
[55:18] itself
[55:19] catches the water and it moves like a
[55:21] sail
[55:22] so i decided i was going to become a
[55:24] rafting guide and they had us
[55:26] learn to swim class 4 rapids a couple of
[55:29] them
[55:30] and so i mean it's there's a potential
[55:32] to die i mean there's a chance of it
[55:34] don't tell mom
[55:35] um there's a chance to die
[55:38] and it's funny even looking at this
[55:40] you're like okay well
[55:42] which hey hey
[55:45] hey um we'll talk
[55:48] later um so when you're here like even
[55:52] in this picture this doesn't look that
[55:54] bad like you're like okay well it's
[55:56] pretty splashy or maybe to some people
[55:57] this looks horrifying
[55:58] um actually in this particular hole if
[56:02] you
[56:02] there's a rock right here you could get
[56:04] caught up on and you actually could flip
[56:05] this boat right here this guy did a
[56:08] great job and you're going through this
[56:09] v and you're fine
[56:10] um but we learned to swim these things
[56:12] not this particular one i couldn't find
[56:14] a picture of the exact one
[56:16] we learned to swim a rapid called table
[56:18] saw and basically
[56:20] it's a green wave that goes up so you
[56:23] can imagine like a wave that comes up
[56:25] it's two intersecting trajectories of
[56:28] water
[56:29] and it's compressing it's like a funnel
[56:32] it's compressing all this water from the
[56:34] river down into this smaller area
[56:36] so a bunch of water is shooting through
[56:38] it's how how a lot of white water works
[56:40] there's these two like waves coming
[56:42] through and they smash each other and so
[56:44] they create this peak so it rises up in
[56:46] this green water
[56:47] and then drops and then you get hit in
[56:49] the face by a wave called mike tyson
[56:52] because it's just this monster sucking
[56:54] back wave that just
[56:56] pounds you and then there's some
[56:59] more uh there's like six more waves
[57:01] right after that
[57:02] anyways uh we were trained to swim this
[57:05] thing
[57:06] and the the day we decided to do it we
[57:07] split into two groups one group went
[57:09] down
[57:10] i was on the first group to swim it and
[57:15] i sat there not sad i stood there you
[57:17] know waiting for my attorney you get all
[57:19] these
[57:19] all these feelings right the guy who's
[57:22] with us owner of the company been doing
[57:23] this for 20 years he
[57:24] shows us like this what you're going to
[57:26] do what's here's what it's going to be
[57:27] like here's what you're going to feel
[57:28] this is what you're going to think
[57:30] here's the dangers here's your you know
[57:32] like all the stuff he's walking through
[57:34] the whole thing
[57:34] and then he does it and i watched the
[57:36] way he did it
[57:38] and then you know waited for the guy in
[57:40] front of me to go i tried to get ahead
[57:42] of him but anyways
[57:43] um so i was the second person
[57:49] and then it was my time to go
[57:55] and i went so you swim out and then the
[57:57] current grabs you
[57:59] and the key thing is with this one you
[58:01] have to stay
[58:03] in in the lane that he's described if
[58:06] you go too far off to the right
[58:08] so it's called the keyhole you're not
[58:10] likely to go there the current doesn't
[58:11] want to put you there but if you did go
[58:13] over there
[58:14] you'll get sucked under and there's a
[58:15] hole in a rock and you can get trapped
[58:18] you can get trapped and so um
[58:22] you do what the guy the guy said and
[58:23] you're like okay well i'm just gonna do
[58:25] exactly what he said and i hit the first
[58:27] wave and i get i
[58:28] get sucked under monster wave you have
[58:30] only about a half a second to turn your
[58:33] head to the side and grab a breath smash
[58:39] you feel like you're drowning um and you
[58:41] actually do take on some water
[58:43] you do take on some water get through
[58:45] the end of it you finally you feel like
[58:46] you're never gonna come out of the water
[58:48] i mean that's exactly what it feels like
[58:49] you feel like you're never coming out
[58:53] and i pop out and we had people ready to
[58:56] throw ropes like once you got to the end
[58:57] of this and i just like
[58:58] swam towards the shore and grabbed the
[59:00] rope and pulled out and said that that
[59:02] was awesome
[59:03] and uh you know i'm not going to pretend
[59:05] that i'm afraid or i'm not going to show
[59:07] that i'm afraid
[59:08] because everyone's afraid and i decided
[59:15] i decided and this is kind of my rule
[59:17] with scary things like this it's the
[59:18] same thing with public speaking by the
[59:20] way
[59:20] people think i like to get up and talk
[59:22] in front of people i really don't i'm
[59:24] actually not
[59:24] i'm not a natural this it's just
[59:26] practice probably the same thing for
[59:28] brother one
[59:29] you just get you do it over and over
[59:31] it's like jumping into the water over
[59:32] and over you get used to it
[59:35] and i was i sat i got there i was kind
[59:38] of shaky you know nerves you're all like
[59:40] firing off and i got there and i laid
[59:42] back in the sun on the rocks and i was
[59:44] like oh
[59:45] thank god that's over and in my mind
[59:47] something said
[59:49] i should do it again i should do it
[59:51] again to
[59:52] really lock it in because for me and
[59:54] that's that's kind of my rule with doing
[59:56] difficult things you got
[59:57] you got to do it twice you don't just do
[59:59] it once it could have been a fluke you
[1:00:00] need to do it again
[1:00:02] to seal it in like get that experience
[1:00:04] and get do it again
[1:00:06] um it's my rule so i'm just saying
[1:00:08] that's that's the way i
[1:00:10] apply things
[1:00:13] and so i just decided i was like you
[1:00:16] know what
[1:00:17] i'm not going to offer i'm not going to
[1:00:18] try to go again but if anyone else goes
[1:00:21] again
[1:00:21] then i'll go again i'll just i'll put it
[1:00:24] there and i just forgot about it i laid
[1:00:26] down
[1:00:26] like okay i'm going to enjoy this
[1:00:28] everyone else comes through you throw
[1:00:29] the rope at them stuff like that
[1:00:32] and the owner so wrapping it up there's
[1:00:34] a second group has to go so they got a
[1:00:36] hike up
[1:00:36] they got to do it again and
[1:00:42] after it's done you know the owner's
[1:00:44] like all right trying to round everyone
[1:00:46] up
[1:00:46] he gives me a hand standing up because
[1:00:48] we're going to throw ropes next for the
[1:00:49] next group
[1:00:50] and he he looks at me and he looks me
[1:00:53] dead in the eye and says
[1:00:55] do you want to jump again he didn't ask
[1:00:58] anybody else he looked right at me and
[1:01:00] said
[1:01:00] do you want to jump again and i said
[1:01:03] yes i do yes i do
[1:01:08] i do and so we hiked back up to the
[1:01:11] thing
[1:01:12] and he decided on the way over he said
[1:01:14] okay i'm going to have you show
[1:01:15] show them how it's done i'm going to
[1:01:17] have you show them how it's done
[1:01:19] you know i'm going to go over the safety
[1:01:20] stuff but you're going to do it and
[1:01:21] you're going to show them how it's done
[1:01:23] so he went over his stuff and he's like
[1:01:25] yep loyal did it perfect this is the way
[1:01:27] you do it just watch him all this stuff
[1:01:29] it's not to it's a reason for this this
[1:01:32] whole story
[1:01:33] jumped in you know did my thing gave him
[1:01:36] a high five
[1:01:36] jump in did the thing again sure enough
[1:01:39] second time around it's still like ah
[1:01:40] just smash waves choking ah
[1:01:44] and then you jump out you swim to the
[1:01:46] shore as hard as you can because there's
[1:01:48] another
[1:01:48] rapids right after this called uh
[1:01:51] diamond cutter
[1:01:52] you don't want a swim diamond cutter you
[1:01:54] can figure out in the name you're going
[1:01:55] to get cut up pretty good
[1:01:59] and and i did it
[1:02:03] and he told me later it's like you did
[1:02:04] it perfect both times like it was
[1:02:06] fantastic
[1:02:09] and there's something there i thought
[1:02:12] about this
[1:02:15] sin you can put that off is to miss
[1:02:20] the mark we've talked about this before
[1:02:26] i could have swam off the trajectory
[1:02:30] there were places that looked better
[1:02:32] there were parts of the the water that
[1:02:34] actually looked better to me
[1:02:37] but he pointed me exactly where to go
[1:02:39] right
[1:02:40] into the face of the hardest wave
[1:02:46] and it was scary it was terrifying
[1:02:50] i did take on water you do like hurl
[1:02:52] water after you get out
[1:02:59] but i followed him i followed him and i
[1:03:02] saw that he could do it and if he could
[1:03:04] do it i could do it
[1:03:07] if he could do it i could do it
[1:03:13] we'll come back to this we're going to
[1:03:15] go into some scripture and walk through
[1:03:20] sin is to miss the mark
[1:03:25] proverbs 16 25 there is a way that
[1:03:27] seemeth right unto a man
[1:03:29] but the end thereof are the ways
[1:03:33] of death i could have looked at that and
[1:03:36] said
[1:03:36] i got a better way of doing this you
[1:03:38] know i'm just not going to do it that
[1:03:40] way i'm going to you know go over here
[1:03:41] i'm going to do this that doesn't make
[1:03:42] any sense to me
[1:03:49] there is a way that seems right into a
[1:03:51] man but the end thereof are the ways
[1:03:53] of death
[1:04:02] so i i did five days of uh
[1:04:05] actually i did like a month i was we
[1:04:06] were close to graduating and i had just
[1:04:08] done five days of uh
[1:04:10] white water rafting training and zip
[1:04:11] line training it was great super fun
[1:04:14] um having a great time and i was
[1:04:16] learning a lot
[1:04:20] and i i got home from the from rafting
[1:04:24] you know
[1:04:26] hung out with my roommate that evening
[1:04:28] and i was super tired i was very
[1:04:29] dehydrated already
[1:04:31] uh because he's been out in the sun for
[1:04:32] five days you know it's hot it's
[1:04:33] tennessee
[1:04:34] you get used to it but uh it's still hot
[1:04:38] and uh went to bed and about two in the
[1:04:40] morning i woke up and like i was in the
[1:04:42] most excruciating
[1:04:44] uh stomach pain i've ever been in in my
[1:04:46] life and
[1:04:48] immediately i was like oh it's gotta be
[1:04:49] food poisoning josh you
[1:04:51] what did you do you know what did you do
[1:04:53] you brought me chipotle how long was
[1:04:54] that in the car
[1:04:55] you know that's exactly what i thought
[1:04:57] was like it's gotta be food poisoning
[1:05:00] and uh you know
[1:05:03] it's you just grin and bear it it's like
[1:05:05] okay well i guess i'll get better or i
[1:05:07] won't and uh
[1:05:08] you just gotta kind of wait couldn't
[1:05:10] sleep tried to sleep it just got worse
[1:05:12] and worse and it just felt like just
[1:05:13] this horrible feeling
[1:05:16] um i've never gone to the hospital for
[1:05:18] anything in my entire life
[1:05:20] i've never it's funny because dad works
[1:05:22] at alaina
[1:05:23] actually and you know mom worked as a
[1:05:26] nurse's aide and my
[1:05:27] uncles and all those guys are all
[1:05:28] doctors and i literally i mean i went
[1:05:31] i've gone i've scheduled an appointment
[1:05:33] several days out and had something
[1:05:35] checked once or twice i had a weird cold
[1:05:37] one time but like i've never gone to er
[1:05:39] never never gone to the emergency room
[1:05:41] in my life
[1:05:42] and it was funny um you know i called up
[1:05:45] with her tom
[1:05:46] i passed her down there and i'm like uh
[1:05:48] i need to go like it's been 12 hours and
[1:05:50] my stomach is still killing me
[1:05:52] anyways long story short it ended up
[1:05:54] being appendicitis
[1:05:56] great it was actually funny because i
[1:05:58] talked i don't have any insurance i was
[1:06:00] like man i hope that this is just food
[1:06:01] poisoning
[1:06:02] oh this is gonna get expensive um i was
[1:06:04] doing all the math on my head it's like
[1:06:06] die
[1:06:07] pay for bills die man dying sounds
[1:06:10] better
[1:06:14] dying sounds better but i finally you
[1:06:16] know i called up a clinic and they're
[1:06:18] like yeah you should probably go in
[1:06:19] that sounds like appendicitis and i went
[1:06:21] in they do their tests and all that jazz
[1:06:23] and i was like
[1:06:25] lady comes in and i told her you know
[1:06:27] like what i thought it was and she
[1:06:29] the doctor and she comes back she's like
[1:06:31] congratulations
[1:06:32] you have appendicitis and i was like
[1:06:35] good let's get it out
[1:06:38] that's the news i wanted to hear it's
[1:06:40] fine let's just get it over with
[1:06:42] um let's just get over with and thank
[1:06:45] god i was actually
[1:06:46] um the
[1:06:49] i was able to pray with them before we
[1:06:51] did the surgery and the anesthesiologist
[1:06:53] put his hand on my shoulder
[1:06:54] so i knew he was a christian uh which
[1:06:56] was great like it was it was very nice
[1:06:58] and for me going into my first surgery
[1:07:00] ever by myself
[1:07:01] uh and covid like dude they wouldn't let
[1:07:04] anyone in
[1:07:05] the uh the hospital at all it was freaky
[1:07:07] kind of because you see
[1:07:08] you walk down the hall and it's empty
[1:07:11] there's no one in the waiting room
[1:07:12] there's no one
[1:07:13] anywhere you're just like walking into
[1:07:14] an empty hospital it's weird
[1:07:16] um but uh thanks god the uh you know my
[1:07:19] appendix came out and it was all good to
[1:07:21] go and
[1:07:22] there weren't any complications it
[1:07:23] hadn't ruptured yet or anything and
[1:07:25] um and it was good
[1:07:28] but thank god thank god
[1:07:32] and so like man this stinks because i
[1:07:34] was training for a triathlon i was
[1:07:36] running
[1:07:36] uh four to five miles three times a week
[1:07:39] i was swimming
[1:07:40] more than a mile three times a week in
[1:07:42] open water
[1:07:44] i was biking 15 to 20 miles three times
[1:07:46] a week
[1:07:47] and learning to whitewater raft so like
[1:07:49] i was busy but
[1:07:51] it you know i think they call it man
[1:07:53] running from the presence of the lord
[1:07:56] after the fact i you know god uses what
[1:07:59] he does to get your attention
[1:08:01] he uses what he does and
[1:08:04] i uh you know i'm i'm uh
[1:08:08] going into the doctor afterwards i'm
[1:08:09] like man can't wait to get back to
[1:08:10] training i'm ready to go you know i'm
[1:08:12] all amped up it's like you know when
[1:08:13] you're when your body gets pumped like
[1:08:15] that it's just like you're ready to go
[1:08:16] all the time you're just yeah let's go
[1:08:18] you want to go for a run yes let's go
[1:08:20] right now
[1:08:21] um and it's great i love it i plan on
[1:08:24] going back to that still because it's
[1:08:25] it's a blast
[1:08:26] but went into the doctor
[1:08:30] and
[1:08:34] i walked in you know i'm like hobbling
[1:08:37] in there which is very
[1:08:38] weird for someone going from it's very
[1:08:40] strange going from on top your game
[1:08:42] like top at the top of your game to zero
[1:08:46] like hobbling around like with a cane to
[1:08:49] walk around
[1:08:50] that was very weird um
[1:08:53] but i i went into the doctor and it's
[1:08:55] funny because i'm just like all right
[1:08:57] you know
[1:08:57] he starts to take the staples out and
[1:08:59] stuff and he's like
[1:09:00] it's like and i'm like oh that hurts
[1:09:02] he's like taking out staples didn't
[1:09:04] never killed nobody you know whatever he
[1:09:06] just like be a man
[1:09:07] basically you know okay fine um
[1:09:11] and he sits down and he starts to talk
[1:09:14] about
[1:09:18] he starts to talk to me and i'm of
[1:09:20] course i was asking him like okay when
[1:09:21] can i
[1:09:22] get back to training when can i when can
[1:09:24] i do this stuff i'm ready to go
[1:09:25] like that's that's exactly what i asked
[1:09:27] him and he basically was like
[1:09:29] didn't answer that and he just starts to
[1:09:31] talk to me and he starts saying
[1:09:32] the magic words which is i don't really
[1:09:35] want to have to tell you this but
[1:09:37] and then he started saying something and
[1:09:38] it was funny inside my mind
[1:09:41] it's like i saw it as he was talking to
[1:09:44] me it was like
[1:09:45] oh i've been preparing my entire life
[1:09:48] for this
[1:09:49] that's exactly what came into my mind
[1:09:51] i've been preparing my
[1:09:53] whole life for someone to use these
[1:09:56] words
[1:09:57] for a doctor to say i hate to tell you
[1:10:01] this
[1:10:01] but and it just came in into my heart
[1:10:05] it doesn't matter what he says i'm not
[1:10:07] going to let this beat me
[1:10:09] it doesn't matter what it is i'm not
[1:10:10] going to let it beat me
[1:10:13] and that's just what came i it just came
[1:10:15] like immediately to my spirit and he
[1:10:17] told me that i had a tumor
[1:10:18] in my colon and they found it and
[1:10:20] they're like yep it's not that big it's
[1:10:22] only 1.5 centimeters
[1:10:24] but it's got to go like it's it's got to
[1:10:26] go there's there's no way around it it's
[1:10:28] a carcinoid tumor and there's a chance
[1:10:30] that it could be cancerous but because
[1:10:32] of the region and the nature of it if we
[1:10:34] probe at it
[1:10:35] there's a chance it could leak out
[1:10:36] microbes so we really can't
[1:10:38] we can't uh start poking at it because
[1:10:42] we don't want it to go to the lymph
[1:10:42] nodes and stuff like that
[1:10:44] me mom's whole side of the family is in
[1:10:46] the medical world so immediately i'm
[1:10:48] like
[1:10:49] but is it though
[1:10:50] [Laughter]
[1:10:53] let's you know call around let's do my
[1:10:55] research on the internet let me see if i
[1:10:57] need to do this or not
[1:10:58] and of course i'm also thinking like man
[1:11:00] that sounds expensive
[1:11:02] sounds really expensive i don't have any
[1:11:04] insurance i'd rather die
[1:11:06] um
[1:11:10] i'm not kidding like those are the
[1:11:11] things that go through
[1:11:13] and so i did like i i went through all
[1:11:15] the
[1:11:16] i immediately went to the church and i i
[1:11:18] prayed after that because i was like and
[1:11:19] i didn't tell anyone right i was like oh
[1:11:21] man wow this is
[1:11:22] this is something the and in my like i
[1:11:25] it didn't scare
[1:11:26] me which is weird i felt a little
[1:11:27] shocked but i didn't feel scared i was
[1:11:29] like
[1:11:30] huh well i guess i guess this is what
[1:11:33] we're doing now
[1:11:34] um we're shifting gears here this is
[1:11:37] this is different and
[1:11:41] uh you know i i went to the church and
[1:11:43] prayed and it was more of a like okay
[1:11:44] god i want to make sure we're
[1:11:46] we're good like is there some like
[1:11:49] i know i'm using very slang terms but
[1:11:51] that's the way i talk to god
[1:11:53] i talk to him like a friend i really do
[1:11:55] there's the reverence and everything but
[1:11:57] i talked to him like i would talk to
[1:11:59] jordan or something it's like god what's
[1:12:01] going on
[1:12:02] like are we good do i need to patch
[1:12:04] something up like did i miss you did i
[1:12:06] did i just like go way off the deep end
[1:12:08] and god did uh you know he did show me
[1:12:10] some things that uh where he
[1:12:12] threw of all of this not at that moment
[1:12:14] but where i needed to be redirected
[1:12:17] but it wasn't a punishment it's an
[1:12:19] opportunity
[1:12:21] it's an opportunity and it just came to
[1:12:24] me while i was praying you know because
[1:12:26] we
[1:12:26] we i think we have a little bit of a or
[1:12:29] maybe it's just me but i
[1:12:30] i i felt this growing up around the
[1:12:32] message culture as it were it's this
[1:12:34] like
[1:12:35] kind of overzealous healing uh
[1:12:39] it's not doctrine it's like this vibe of
[1:12:42] like if you don't believe for healing
[1:12:43] you must not have enough faith you know
[1:12:45] or something like that
[1:12:46] and i just prayed and i was like you
[1:12:48] know what god you're the same god that
[1:12:50] provides as heals
[1:12:52] it's the same god it doesn't matter it's
[1:12:54] just another attribute
[1:12:55] god you can heal me or you can provide
[1:12:57] for my bills
[1:12:59] one way or the other it's still you it's
[1:13:02] still you
[1:13:02] and at the end of the day i'm not i i'm
[1:13:05] not putting my faith in my own self like
[1:13:07] i'm like i gotta be healed
[1:13:09] like no no no it doesn't have to come
[1:13:11] that way god can have it come whatever
[1:13:13] way he wants
[1:13:14] at the end of the day we're called to do
[1:13:17] what we
[1:13:18] can do and god takes over where we
[1:13:21] can't where we can't
[1:13:25] so i prayed about it thought about it
[1:13:26] did all the research called around tried
[1:13:28] to get insurance oh it was a nightmare
[1:13:30] for like weeks it was like
[1:13:31] called dad talked to him called like i
[1:13:34] just like trying to figure it out
[1:13:36] went ahead and had the surgery thank god
[1:13:39] um
[1:13:41] it went well i'm cancer free i don't
[1:13:43] have any cancer so thank god for that uh
[1:13:45] they took out the lymph nodes they
[1:13:47] tested everything after the fact and i'm
[1:13:48] i'm good to go
[1:13:49] it could have been a different story
[1:13:52] just
[1:13:53] the other day those of you that watch
[1:13:55] movies
[1:13:56] i'm just kidding um there's a famous
[1:13:59] actor he's 43 years old work
[1:14:01] played in a lot of these marvel movies
[1:14:03] and he just died from colon cancer
[1:14:06] just happened he was at the peak of his
[1:14:09] career
[1:14:11] the peak of his career and i saw that
[1:14:14] and it just it
[1:14:15] struck me it struck me as the grace of
[1:14:18] almighty god
[1:14:21] the grace of god let's give the lord a
[1:14:23] hand clap of praise because that's
[1:14:25] it's the grace of almighty god
[1:14:29] absolutely it's the grace of god
[1:14:33] that even if it is even if a tumor is
[1:14:36] benign it can keep on growing
[1:14:38] it can sit inside of you for a very long
[1:14:40] time
[1:14:41] i'm 30 you know in my brain i'm like
[1:14:43] pika mike i don't
[1:14:44] i'm fine you know in my brain and i
[1:14:47] would have never thought to go get that
[1:14:48] get something checked not
[1:14:49] not for till i'm in my 40s or you know
[1:14:51] 50s maybe
[1:14:52] it could have sat there for the next 10
[1:14:55] 20 years
[1:14:57] and here we see even in the news just
[1:14:58] recently you never know
[1:15:00] and so we can look at these things as
[1:15:03] god
[1:15:04] coming in and smacking us sometimes it
[1:15:08] is
[1:15:08] and it maybe still is from god or we can
[1:15:11] see it as a blessing
[1:15:12] god comes in and he allows things to
[1:15:14] happen
[1:15:16] he allows things to happen if my
[1:15:18] appendix hadn't gone out
[1:15:20] i would have never known i would have
[1:15:23] never known
[1:15:25] i would have never known would have kept
[1:15:28] on sitting in there
[1:15:30] forever until something happened with it
[1:15:33] you know until i'm in my 50s or 40s
[1:15:35] and how much more time it would have had
[1:15:36] to grow
[1:15:39] to grow
[1:15:42] so i'm very grateful i'm very grateful
[1:15:44] for that i'm very thankful for that
[1:15:52] i want to share just a couple of things
[1:15:53] on here i'm watching our time
[1:15:56] um i have a much longer sermon we could
[1:15:58] preach on this one i'm going to preach
[1:16:00] the very short version
[1:16:01] or try to
[1:16:08] the guide told me the guy
[1:16:11] that
[1:16:16] the guy that owned this rafting
[1:16:19] thing so i talked to him well it was a
[1:16:21] different story i could tell another
[1:16:23] story
[1:16:23] where i accidentally went flying out of
[1:16:26] the boat and
[1:16:26] grabbed the guy in front of me and threw
[1:16:28] him out of the boat too it was really
[1:16:30] funny
[1:16:30] um it was really funny and
[1:16:36] yeah no it's the same rapids and i
[1:16:37] accidentally i was guiding and i pinned
[1:16:39] the boat the front of the boat up on
[1:16:40] pinnacle rock which is the rock that if
[1:16:42] you go underneath you get stuck
[1:16:44] anyways there's all these rapids it gets
[1:16:46] stuck there
[1:16:47] brent are the owner he jumps up on the
[1:16:49] nose and he's like all right what did
[1:16:50] you do wrong we're talking through it
[1:16:52] while we're in the middle of a rapids
[1:16:53] and there's water pouring i'm sitting on
[1:16:54] the tail it just wants to flip
[1:16:56] it wants to suck under and flip it just
[1:16:58] wants to
[1:16:59] there's just enough weight like he
[1:17:01] jumped up to the front so there wasn't
[1:17:02] quite enough weight in the back for it
[1:17:03] to flip
[1:17:04] water's flying through people are coming
[1:17:06] by through laughing at us and i'm just
[1:17:08] sitting here like
[1:17:09] all right let's do this and he's like
[1:17:10] all right give us a big pry which is a
[1:17:12] move like this to turn us
[1:17:14] out and i turned once again this is
[1:17:17] table saw so it's a rough
[1:17:18] rapids and diamond splitters right after
[1:17:20] it which you don't want to swim because
[1:17:22] you're going to get cut up and i turned
[1:17:25] the boat
[1:17:26] flipped the tail out into the water and
[1:17:28] immediately
[1:17:29] anybody was like i just gave it a really
[1:17:31] strong pull and so the tail went out
[1:17:34] and it pulls you off the rock really
[1:17:36] fast like that's how you get off rocks
[1:17:38] is you actually
[1:17:39] you use the like a lever the
[1:17:42] the mechanics of the physics of the raft
[1:17:44] to pull you off
[1:17:46] we go flying off and i immediately like
[1:17:49] the boat doesn't flip but it does this
[1:17:51] movement
[1:17:52] and i immediately just go flying out of
[1:17:53] the boat you know immediately
[1:17:55] and i see the guy in front of me and i
[1:17:56] think he's got to be locked in you can
[1:17:58] lock your feet like into the raft
[1:18:00] he's got to be locked in so i grab on to
[1:18:02] his life vest
[1:18:04] i grab onto his life vest and i
[1:18:07] throw him out of the boat i'm not even
[1:18:09] kidding i threw him into the air out of
[1:18:11] the boat
[1:18:13] it was so funny it was hilarious and
[1:18:16] i go underwater you know hit the same
[1:18:18] you know punched in the face you're
[1:18:20] sucking in water
[1:18:21] and i pop up and i don't see the boat
[1:18:23] i'm like boom
[1:18:24] i'm going to shore i am not swimming
[1:18:26] diamond splitter like that just instinct
[1:18:27] took over
[1:18:28] boom going to shore
[1:18:32] and then i look up i'm also sure i look
[1:18:33] up and i turn around and brent you know
[1:18:35] he's on the guide position in the boat
[1:18:37] and he yells at me he's like
[1:18:39] all your customers are gonna die idiot
[1:18:42] you abandon your raft you're the guide
[1:18:45] you can't abandon the raft
[1:18:48] and it's actually funny it's a pretty
[1:18:50] good metaphor you see around
[1:18:52] christianity someone falls out of the
[1:18:54] boat
[1:18:56] and they take the next person with them
[1:18:59] they take the next person with them
[1:19:02] ministers they fall out of the boat
[1:19:05] rather than saying
[1:19:06] somebody save me they take
[1:19:09] someone with them
[1:19:12] but i talked to brent about it and that
[1:19:14] was um kind of my last section
[1:19:16] of training before everything happened
[1:19:19] which i've still got great relationship
[1:19:20] with those guys down there so we'll see
[1:19:22] if i ever go back to that probably not
[1:19:24] but
[1:19:25] i talked to him and i felt bad i was
[1:19:27] like man you know sorry
[1:19:29] you wouldn't mean to like throw him out
[1:19:30] of the boat and then abandon you guys
[1:19:33] um and he told me this
[1:19:36] and this stuck with me
[1:19:39] our goal is to make you panic
[1:19:43] over and over and over again
[1:19:47] to get you to the point where you've
[1:19:50] been through
[1:19:51] so much you no longer think
[1:19:54] about yourself you're gonna be okay
[1:19:58] and you know you will be you know you
[1:20:00] have the skills
[1:20:01] to get out you know it doesn't matter if
[1:20:04] you get in
[1:20:04] in a a hydraulic it doesn't matter you
[1:20:07] know you have the skills
[1:20:08] to save to get out and now
[1:20:12] you only care about the people in that
[1:20:14] boat because without you
[1:20:16] they're gonna die they don't know what
[1:20:18] to do they might not totally die but
[1:20:20] they're they're gonna get hurt
[1:20:22] if you're the guy they have no clue what
[1:20:24] to do
[1:20:25] even as for me it starts to become like
[1:20:27] well obviously you just like do this
[1:20:29] they don't have any idea it's pure
[1:20:31] terror for them
[1:20:34] and that just stuck with me that
[1:20:37] in our christians walks that's exactly
[1:20:39] what god is doing
[1:20:42] that's exactly what god is doing god is
[1:20:44] bringing us through
[1:20:46] things into things
[1:20:50] like mike tyson the giant wave
[1:20:53] if it was me i would have picked a route
[1:20:54] around that thing
[1:20:57] but he gave me a route right into the
[1:21:00] greatest
[1:21:01] wave right into the greatest wave
[1:21:08] and it taught me and i learned
[1:21:11] and here it is it's funny i just noticed
[1:21:13] this as i was writing up my notes
[1:21:15] i jumped two times and i had two
[1:21:18] surgeries
[1:21:22] it just struck me that god brings
[1:21:25] us even rafting is as silly as it sounds
[1:21:29] god allows things positive
[1:21:32] negative it's all the same to god he
[1:21:35] allows these things to come
[1:21:37] and to teach us he leads me
[1:21:43] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:21:46] i won't lack
[1:21:48] anywhere he leads me
[1:21:52] he makes me to lie down in green
[1:21:54] pastures
[1:21:55] sometimes
[1:21:58] he leads me beside still waters
[1:22:01] sometimes
[1:22:04] and he all he does restore my soul
[1:22:08] he restores my soul he leads me
[1:22:11] in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:22:14] name's sake
[1:22:18] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:22:20] shadow of death
[1:22:22] he led me there he
[1:22:25] led me there
[1:22:28] i won't fear any evil
[1:22:31] cut why and this is the key
[1:22:34] thing if i could if you can get this
[1:22:37] tonight the whole reason i literally i
[1:22:39] haven't even gone into any of my notes
[1:22:41] i've got a whole nother sermon in here
[1:22:43] but it doesn't matter
[1:22:45] this is the whole point this is the
[1:22:49] whole point
[1:22:51] i won't fear any evil
[1:22:54] for you're with me you're with me
[1:22:59] and i can say for myself that is exactly
[1:23:03] what i've learned in the last two years
[1:23:05] i've learned how to be abound
[1:23:08] and to be abased i've been to the point
[1:23:10] where i was making more money than i've
[1:23:12] made in my life
[1:23:13] and i've been to the point where i
[1:23:14] didn't have two quarters to rub together
[1:23:18] and it doesn't matter and it's so easy
[1:23:23] in these moments of positivity you know
[1:23:26] we're like oh wow things are going great
[1:23:30] we forget god and we lose him and we
[1:23:32] think that we're doing just fine
[1:23:35] and then when things are bad we think
[1:23:39] i must have done something wrong
[1:23:44] he leads me into the valley of the
[1:23:48] shadow of death thou preparest a table
[1:23:52] before me
[1:23:53] in the presence of my enemies you ever
[1:23:56] feel like you're surrounded by enemies
[1:24:00] god led you there
[1:24:03] god led you there
[1:24:12] it's a story and this came to me and in
[1:24:15] in the i'm really only going i'm just
[1:24:17] hitting some highlights
[1:24:18] um because it doesn't matter at the end
[1:24:22] of the day you know i don't
[1:24:25] i had a point was like i i really felt
[1:24:27] like i was hitting the wall
[1:24:31] and i just like long story short was
[1:24:34] like i'm out of money like i'm
[1:24:35] i'm out i'm out thinking your bills are
[1:24:38] piling up i'm out
[1:24:39] like it's it's done like other than my
[1:24:41] ira i'm like god i'm gonna have to crack
[1:24:43] into that and it just finally
[1:24:44] overwhelmed me
[1:24:46] i was in this is not to make you feel
[1:24:48] sorry for me
[1:24:49] god is in control i
[1:24:53] pulled up to the gas state i was out of
[1:24:55] gas i was almost like it was on e i'm
[1:24:57] like i can probably make it a couple
[1:24:58] more miles but you know once you run out
[1:25:00] of gas once you start to get an
[1:25:01] idea of where it is you're like it's
[1:25:03] right about here
[1:25:04] i can go i actually tracked it from when
[1:25:06] the light goes on to being out of gas
[1:25:08] it's 49 miles
[1:25:10] it's exactly 49 miles it happened
[1:25:14] pull up to the gas station and like
[1:25:17] i think i had some change or something
[1:25:19] and that i found like i dug
[1:25:21] into the into the coasters
[1:25:26] and it came to me it's funny dad we were
[1:25:28] watching faith like potatoes last night
[1:25:30] it's a great movie i recommend it and
[1:25:31] that
[1:25:32] that came to me at this moment
[1:25:36] was i just sat there and i was just i
[1:25:38] was ashamed of myself
[1:25:40] it's like god what am i even doing like
[1:25:43] did i miss you and even though i knew
[1:25:46] god was with me
[1:25:47] i st we all still question god
[1:25:51] did i me did i do something wrong you
[1:25:54] know you think about it's like well you
[1:25:55] know
[1:25:56] maybe i shouldn't have done this maybe i
[1:25:58] shouldn't have done and we can
[1:26:00] find mistakes we're going to make
[1:26:02] mistakes
[1:26:03] we're all and then if we're not careful
[1:26:05] we'll go too hard on ourselves and think
[1:26:07] it's because of donald
[1:26:09] made these mistakes this is why this is
[1:26:11] happening see
[1:26:13] and satan will come and use that and
[1:26:16] this just came to me you know for me
[1:26:18] it was important because it's like well
[1:26:20] bills are piling up i don't have a lot
[1:26:21] of money it's like it must have been
[1:26:22] because i
[1:26:24] spend too much money on suits or
[1:26:26] something you know it's like it's my
[1:26:27] fault
[1:26:28] i'm i did something stupid
[1:26:31] and this just came to me for what it's
[1:26:33] worth
[1:26:34] the story of the woman that came to
[1:26:37] elisha
[1:26:38] her sons were going to be sold into
[1:26:41] slavery
[1:26:43] her husband was dead and she had debt
[1:26:47] she had debts and we if you look
[1:26:50] throughout the bible
[1:26:51] that's a bad thing like it's not good
[1:26:53] it's actually very frowned upon
[1:26:55] and you could look at that and say well
[1:26:58] she shouldn't have had any debt
[1:27:00] but she did she did to the point
[1:27:04] so much debt and she wasn't able to make
[1:27:06] her bills that
[1:27:07] they were going to sell her sons into
[1:27:09] slavery
[1:27:14] and she had a small cruise of oil
[1:27:18] and that was it that's all she had
[1:27:23] and she went to elisha and elisha didn't
[1:27:27] berate her
[1:27:30] he didn't say why have you done this you
[1:27:33] know
[1:27:33] what show me your accounts let's make
[1:27:35] sure your accounting is all good
[1:27:37] right you reap what you sow after all
[1:27:39] you know let's make sure i want to make
[1:27:41] sure that you're you're holy
[1:27:42] i want to make sure that you're ready to
[1:27:44] go he didn't do that
[1:27:47] he told her what to do and she did it
[1:27:51] and god provided for her needs
[1:27:55] and that spoke to me
[1:27:59] i don't have a lot but whatever i have
[1:28:01] god it's yours
[1:28:04] just like this movie which is great god
[1:28:07] we're in a drought if you've seen faith
[1:28:09] like potatoes it's fantastic they were
[1:28:10] in a drought
[1:28:11] i give you my farm i give you myself i
[1:28:14] give you my family
[1:28:15] for me is i give you my car i've got a
[1:28:17] car
[1:28:19] and it it just it it broke me
[1:28:22] it broke me and it helped me
[1:28:28] it helped me
[1:28:37] god is with us
[1:28:40] god is faithful and i'm convinced of
[1:28:44] this
[1:28:45] i am convinced of one thing
[1:28:50] that god will bring us through the
[1:28:53] things
[1:28:54] we need period
[1:28:57] and sometimes those are things we can
[1:28:59] look in our lives and we see the
[1:29:01] the actions that led up to it and we
[1:29:04] look at ourselves and say i shouldn't
[1:29:06] have done that
[1:29:06] and sure we should we should repent we
[1:29:09] should say god
[1:29:10] i'm sorry about that but you
[1:29:13] don't know at the end of the day
[1:29:16] we don't know the end from the beginning
[1:29:20] we don't know what's good
[1:29:23] or bad for us in the long run because
[1:29:26] god he leads us
[1:29:29] he leads he allows it to happen
[1:29:32] he allows it to happen we do make
[1:29:34] mistakes
[1:29:35] we get off course we all like
[1:29:38] sheep have gone astray we have turned
[1:29:42] everyone to his own way
[1:29:46] we all have we all do
[1:29:50] we all do
[1:29:53] but i love this luke 7.
[1:29:57] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:29:59] two debtors and
[1:30:00] one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[1:30:04] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:30:06] frankly gave them both
[1:30:08] tell me therefore which of them will
[1:30:11] love him
[1:30:12] most
[1:30:16] which of them will love him most
[1:30:20] and this just it we've heard this
[1:30:23] statement over and over and it always
[1:30:24] kind of rubbed me the wrong way
[1:30:26] is god brings us through trial so that
[1:30:28] we prove that we love him
[1:30:30] that's the way the statement had been
[1:30:32] said and to me that always bothered me
[1:30:33] it's like that sounds so
[1:30:35] sadistic like that sounds wrong
[1:30:38] but it broke open for me and maybe this
[1:30:42] is just for me
[1:30:43] god brings us through trials to
[1:30:46] prove that he loves you
[1:30:50] he does to prove that he loves you
[1:30:55] in those moments of our darkest hours
[1:30:57] and our worst time satan will always
[1:30:59] come just like he came to the prophets
[1:31:01] before god doesn't love you
[1:31:06] he's forgotten about you god doesn't
[1:31:08] care
[1:31:10] and god allows that to happen just
[1:31:13] like job so that he can
[1:31:17] show himself real to us
[1:31:20] so that we can experience him we
[1:31:23] experience him
[1:31:24] and it comes down into an embodiment
[1:31:29] embodiment that you you know it in your
[1:31:32] bones because you've been there through
[1:31:35] it
[1:31:36] with him i'll be with you
[1:31:39] always he said it
[1:31:43] he said it he said it and he meant what
[1:31:47] he said
[1:31:48] because god said so so no matter
[1:31:51] what we're in we're going to go astray
[1:31:55] and that's okay it's okay
[1:31:59] that's why we have the blood that's why
[1:32:02] we have the grace of almighty god
[1:32:04] that we are going to make mistakes even
[1:32:07] and especially after we've become
[1:32:10] christians
[1:32:12] we think too often that wow i'm a
[1:32:15] christian now i should be like this
[1:32:17] i should be like this
[1:32:21] but what a christian is is to follow
[1:32:25] christ to follow him
[1:32:29] to allow him to lead you into what you
[1:32:32] need to produce his
[1:32:35] spirit and his fruit
[1:32:39] and it will happen automatically it will
[1:32:42] absolutely happen
[1:32:44] automatically because there's a way
[1:32:48] it says in isaiah there is a way
[1:32:51] that a fool would not air therein
[1:32:56] that a fool wouldn't miss the mark
[1:32:59] that a person who is not even able to
[1:33:02] comprehend what they're
[1:33:03] doing won't miss the mark
[1:33:08] and so how much more for each of us
[1:33:11] if we can lay aside the weight
[1:33:14] of the sin which sin is to miss the mark
[1:33:18] and we've got you can go look it up it's
[1:33:20] actually in
[1:33:20] i believe romans where paul actually
[1:33:22] identifies
[1:33:23] that sin is simply unbelief
[1:33:27] or misbelief believing
[1:33:30] the wrong things so we carry this weight
[1:33:33] we become christians and we carry this
[1:33:35] weight
[1:33:36] of all the things we have to do
[1:33:40] all the things that we have to do all
[1:33:42] the things that a good christian does
[1:33:46] all of these weights
[1:33:50] of misappropriated belief
[1:33:54] what really matters what really matters
[1:34:02] paul told us
[1:34:06] though i speak with the tongue of men
[1:34:08] and angels
[1:34:10] though i give all i have to feed the
[1:34:14] poor
[1:34:15] though i sing all the songs though i
[1:34:18] wear the right clothes
[1:34:20] though i never make a mistake
[1:34:26] hear that do i never make
[1:34:29] one mistake
[1:34:32] and i don't have love i don't have the
[1:34:35] relationship
[1:34:36] with god it's vanity
[1:34:40] it's vanity and it's the exact same
[1:34:44] thing
[1:34:47] it's the exact same thing if you look at
[1:34:49] it
[1:34:51] solomon came to the same conclusion
[1:34:54] he came to the same conclusion in
[1:34:56] ecclesiastes he walked us through
[1:35:00] vanity of vanities what prophet has a
[1:35:02] man in all his labor which he takes
[1:35:04] under the sun
[1:35:06] and you can read the whole passage i
[1:35:07] won't go through it all the rivers run
[1:35:08] into
[1:35:09] the sea yet the sea is not full i gave
[1:35:11] my heart to see
[1:35:12] excuse me seek and search out by wisdom
[1:35:15] concerning all things that are done
[1:35:16] under heaven
[1:35:18] this sore travail hath god given to the
[1:35:19] sons of man to be exercised there with
[1:35:22] and people some some critics have looked
[1:35:24] at ecclesiastes and just said that it's
[1:35:26] the words of a backslidden preacher
[1:35:28] that's not entirely true he looked at a
[1:35:31] life without
[1:35:32] god and it's utterly vain
[1:35:37] no matter jeff bezos 20 billion dollars
[1:35:41] that's his net worth
[1:35:43] just got a divorce last year you think
[1:35:46] maybe just maybe
[1:35:50] he's still searching for something more
[1:35:54] more it's vanity
[1:36:00] it's vanity
[1:36:04] but there is a way
[1:36:07] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[1:36:10] the life
[1:36:11] no man comes unto the father but by me
[1:36:18] james told us he that comes to god must
[1:36:21] believe that he
[1:36:22] is and that he is a rewarder of those
[1:36:25] that diligently
[1:36:27] follow him seek him
[1:36:30] crave him to walk after him
[1:36:36] and so
[1:36:39] i'm not going to take too much more of
[1:36:40] your time i have a lot more here that we
[1:36:42] could have gone to this is a very
[1:36:43] different direction
[1:36:53] i want to read something just really
[1:36:55] quick i was
[1:36:57] and then we'll close i know we're at
[1:36:58] nine o'clock right now we have 15
[1:37:00] minutes
[1:37:03] nope out of there
[1:37:12] there once was a man who wanted to serve
[1:37:15] god
[1:37:16] he studied he listened to his parents he
[1:37:19] listened to the teachers and the pastors
[1:37:21] and the tapes and the podcasts and he
[1:37:23] read the books
[1:37:25] from a small boy he prayed to know the
[1:37:27] secret
[1:37:28] eternal life he kept himself from sin
[1:37:31] he didn't go to the parties he debated
[1:37:34] and argued with those that would dare
[1:37:36] question
[1:37:38] the word of god he started a business
[1:37:42] he was a good entrepreneur he sought out
[1:37:45] the best teachers and the sages
[1:37:48] in the land everyone told him surely god
[1:37:50] loves you
[1:37:51] look at your life it's perfect
[1:37:54] he joined the political sphere he became
[1:37:56] known as a man
[1:37:58] full of wisdom and yet something
[1:38:02] nod at him perhaps in his studies he
[1:38:06] came across the words of job
[1:38:08] both the man and the beast bo they both
[1:38:10] go into the ground
[1:38:13] he yearned for the knowledge of the
[1:38:14] eternal
[1:38:18] and it just it started coming to me
[1:38:22] that's me that's you
[1:38:26] that's all of us in our hearts we start
[1:38:30] on a journey
[1:38:32] we start on a journey and we'll come to
[1:38:36] the point
[1:38:38] we have questions we have needs we have
[1:38:41] thirsts
[1:38:43] and we will come to the point where we
[1:38:46] realize
[1:38:47] it's not enough it's not enough
[1:38:52] and will meet the one
[1:38:56] the one who can satisfy that
[1:38:59] who can satisfy that
[1:39:06] and that's why i moved
[1:39:10] i already knew christ i'd already served
[1:39:13] god for a long time
[1:39:14] yet something was calling me come
[1:39:18] follow me follow me
[1:39:21] you're not going to know where you're
[1:39:22] going you're not going to know what's
[1:39:24] going to happen
[1:39:25] follow me and i would urge all of you
[1:39:28] tonight
[1:39:30] it's always the same call
[1:39:34] we think that if when we put our names
[1:39:36] on the book
[1:39:38] we got baptized we came to church
[1:39:42] we sang the songs we did the things that
[1:39:45] it's enough
[1:39:49] but christ is calling to us every
[1:39:52] moment of every day to come
[1:39:56] and follow me follow me
[1:40:00] where are we going said thomas
[1:40:05] we don't know the way have i been with
[1:40:09] you this long
[1:40:10] and still you don't know me
[1:40:16] christ is calling out to us
[1:40:20] always
[1:40:25] musicians you can go ahead and come
[1:40:34] i am the way
[1:40:38] isaiah 35 say to them that are of a
[1:40:40] fearful
[1:40:41] heart be strong fear not
[1:40:44] behold your god will come with vengeance
[1:40:47] even god with a recompense he will come
[1:40:50] and
[1:40:50] save you and i think sometimes
[1:40:55] as christians like sheep we go astray
[1:40:59] we get distracted we see something
[1:41:02] and we get caught up in something and we
[1:41:05] feel ashamed
[1:41:08] and we can't save ourselves
[1:41:15] call upon the name of the lord call upon
[1:41:18] the name of the lord
[1:41:20] he will still leave the 99
[1:41:24] to go after the one he'll still they're
[1:41:26] all still his sheep
[1:41:28] it's not just the rank sinner out there
[1:41:31] in the world we think that way
[1:41:33] no it's anyone who has missed the mark
[1:41:36] we've strayed we've strayed just
[1:41:39] slightly
[1:41:40] just slightly off into our own thinking
[1:41:43] often to some false something satan was
[1:41:46] able to get one over on us and
[1:41:49] i had it happen just recently i'm coming
[1:41:52] to a close
[1:41:55] somehow in all of these surgeries just a
[1:41:57] two weeks ago
[1:42:00] something had slipped into my mind i
[1:42:02] don't know if it was in a dream or what
[1:42:03] happened
[1:42:04] but it said all of this is meaningless
[1:42:08] all of it's meaningless and it it
[1:42:10] grabbed me
[1:42:12] all of it's meaningless all of the
[1:42:14] suffering all all of the frustration all
[1:42:16] of the praying all of the
[1:42:18] all of the hurt all of the the agony
[1:42:22] it's all for nothing you made mistakes
[1:42:25] it's all for nothing you're just reaping
[1:42:27] what you sowed
[1:42:31] and it bothered me it gripped me because
[1:42:35] there's a part of it that's true
[1:42:37] satan will come to you and bring
[1:42:39] something that's partially true
[1:42:41] you did do it you did make mistakes
[1:42:44] you did do stupid things and you did
[1:42:46] know better
[1:42:49] you did but the scripture came to my
[1:42:53] heart
[1:42:55] all things work together for the good to
[1:42:58] them that love god and are called
[1:43:00] according to his purpose
[1:43:01] all things all means all
[1:43:04] my mistakes my in and my out my own
[1:43:08] frustrations my
[1:43:09] my own weaknesses my own temptations

[1:43:42] doesn't matter
[1:43:43] what happens it doesn't matter what
[1:43:45] circumstances come against us
[1:43:47] if we can simply hold this then is the
[1:43:50] conclusion of the whole
[1:43:52] matter love the lord your god

[1:44:01] him

[1:44:35] matters is that you call out to him
[1:44:38] you cannot save yourself you cannot save
[1:44:41] yourself

[1:46:40] i'll go with him

[1:47:33] i go away
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:48:02] yes
[1:48:16] i go away
[1:48:19] through the judgment
[1:48:41] the judgment
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:58] psalm 23 let's just read there together
[1:49:02] and we will pray in this tonight
[1:49:10] let's read together the lord is my
[1:49:13] shepherd
[1:49:14] i shall not want he maketh me to lie
[1:49:18] down in green
[1:49:19] pastures he lifted me beside a still
[1:49:23] water
[1:49:24] he restored my soul he leaded me
[1:49:28] in the path of righteousness for his
[1:49:31] name's sake
[1:49:32] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:49:35] shadow of death
[1:49:37] i will fear no evil for doubt i will
[1:49:42] thy lord and i comfort me
[1:49:45] thou prepared at the table before me
[1:49:48] in the presence of my enemies thou
[1:49:52] anointed my hair with all my cup
[1:49:55] run up over surely goodness and mercy
[1:49:59] shall follow me all the ways of my life
[1:50:03] and i will endure in the house of the
[1:50:06] lord
[1:50:06] forever amen
[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:17] just listening to our brother testimony
[1:50:22] and
[1:50:27] a brother and a friend of mine uh sent a
[1:50:31] sent me a call today and i was trying to
[1:50:34] copy that and send it to the mail for
[1:50:36] the prayer meeting tonight i couldn't do
[1:50:37] that
[1:50:39] and brother branham said he said
[1:50:43] that every one of us he says we find it
[1:50:47] difficult
[1:50:48] to pray in a crowd he says
[1:50:52] we speak to god best when we are alone
[1:50:56] he said find a place get along with god
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:00] and talk to him and that's what brother
[1:51:03] branham said in the church order he said
[1:51:04] don't do long prayers
[1:51:06] he said long prayers are for your closet
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:10] because that is the place where we can
[1:51:11] express ourselves to god
[1:51:13] as humans when we come together to pray
[1:51:16] like this
[1:51:17] our human mind tells us people are
[1:51:19] around us
[1:51:22] our human mind always try to say
[1:51:25] somebody is listening even though we try
[1:51:27] to be in the spirit
[1:51:28] we try to turn ourselves loose but when
[1:51:30] we get along with god
[1:51:32] i mean you can cry your heart out you
[1:51:35] can say it
[1:51:36] and i mean you can say some of the
[1:51:38] things that you can never be able to say
[1:51:41] but i mean it's it's being alone with
[1:51:43] god
[1:51:44] it's having the opportunity to allow
[1:51:48] god to speak to you
[1:51:52] having the opportunity to allow god to
[1:51:56] lead you
[1:51:58] young people going back to school
[1:52:02] their peers pressured in school
[1:52:05] you get assignments you get all of these
[1:52:09] things
[1:52:10] you think about reading your bible you
[1:52:12] think about finding time to pray to god
[1:52:15] all what you want
[1:52:18] is to find god leading you in the midst
[1:52:21] of all of those things
[1:52:25] find god leading you everything
[1:52:29] his mercy is renewed because he wants
[1:52:32] us to trust him
[1:52:35] he wants us to trust him
[1:52:42] that just speak to the lord
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:53] to the lord like this
[1:52:57] i love you lord
[1:53:08] a moment like this when you hear another
[1:53:10] person's story
[1:53:12] and you think about yourself you think
[1:53:15] about
[1:53:15] how the lord being dealing with you you
[1:53:17] think about the things
[1:53:19] and you say oh god it's just the same
[1:53:24] thing
[1:53:26] i didn't have to go on the water i never
[1:53:29] needed surgery
[1:53:32] but you brought me to a place for me to
[1:53:34] realize that you lead me
[1:53:36] you brought me to a place for me to pay
[1:53:39] attention
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:43] and when we think about the end
[1:53:49] it pays to appreciate him and just tell
[1:53:52] him how much we love him
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:54:03] [Music]
