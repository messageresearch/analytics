[40:26] last wednesday we gave a little tribute
[40:29] to one hero of fight
[40:31] and
[40:33] william tyndale
[40:35] a man that was willing
[40:38] to be burned
[40:40] that the word of god will be put in the
[40:42] language of the common people
[40:45] amen
[40:46] praise the lord i couldn't get over
[40:48] there wednesday so i just thought i'd
[40:50] give it simon title that i was going to
[40:52] preach i was actually going to preach
[40:57] like jesus said in the scripture you
[40:59] know the common people heard him gladly
[41:01] that's why i was going to preach on
[41:02] wednesday night but my mind was so
[41:04] consumed with
[41:06] what what that young man did for the
[41:09] lord praise the lord
[41:10] amen
[41:12] amen so we gave a tribute to him
[41:15] and
[41:16] [Music]
[41:17] many years ago the same month
[41:20] october
[41:21] 31st
[41:23] will be
[41:24] when
[41:25] martin luther
[41:26] put his thesis on the door
[41:29] of the church
[41:30] that started the reformation
[41:33] so we i mean we we are in a great of in
[41:36] the month where where great things was
[41:37] done for this gospel
[41:39] praise the lord
[41:41] men that uh that gave their lives
[41:44] so we can have a pure word to preach
[41:47] praise the lord
[41:48] and just like i said on wednesday night
[41:51] god watches over his word
[41:54] amen he is the altar of his word
[41:58] man might be inspired to interpret the
[42:01] bible or the message in different
[42:03] languages but the one that watches over
[42:05] the truth interpretation
[42:08] is almighty god
[42:10] and what god will use
[42:12] to bring a man to him is only god that
[42:15] designed it
[42:18] praise the lord so there is there is no
[42:20] there's no need of getting in all these
[42:22] foxes and forces people made oh there's
[42:25] a wrong interpretation all that's wrong
[42:27] you know people came to the law by just
[42:30] reading a track
[42:34] where will you spend your life
[42:36] brought somebody to the lord
[42:38] just a track
[42:40] because god is the altar of his word
[42:45] and many people that have had the pure
[42:47] truth
[42:50] translation of the bible pure true
[42:52] translation of the message and they have
[42:54] gone into idolatry
[42:59] but we just want to thank the lord
[43:01] that we serve a god that still watch
[43:03] over his word
[43:05] praise the lord
[43:07] amen
[43:08] amen
[43:12] i just have to say one thing
[43:17] naomi and i were just talking about you
[43:19] earlier this week
[43:30] thank you jesus

[43:50] and uh
[43:52] [Music]
[43:55] you know
[43:57] i will reserve my comments
[44:00] i will reserve my comments
[44:02] you know uh
[44:04] but it's it goes to say that
[44:11] many people don't see the work that is
[44:13] done in in the background of this church
[44:17] you don't see the work that is done in
[44:19] the dark places
[44:21] and the
[44:23] the nice of praying and
[44:26] and the burden that is pulled into
[44:28] what brings us here
[44:30] you might have your idea of what you
[44:32] think
[44:33] this is all about
[44:35] but your idea does not matter to me
[44:38] it does not matter to me
[44:41] and uh
[44:43] what matters to me
[44:45] is what god is doing
[44:49] and uh
[44:51] i'm glad to be a part of faith

[51:08] lord praise the lord
[51:09] amen
[51:11] amen
[51:13] you know while this week
[51:16] kind of for reflecting on a lot of
[51:17] things and
[51:18] and
[51:20] uh read a story about dear moody
[51:25] and
[51:26] being a 15 years old
[51:29] boy
[51:30] a shoe shine board with shiny shoes and
[51:33] repairing shoes
[51:35] on the street of chicago
[51:37] when he got saved
[51:38] [Music]
[51:40] and when geo moody got saved
[51:43] there was
[51:45] there was one burden that he had
[51:48] and if you look at that you look at
[51:50] their true
[51:52] history and even through the scriptures
[51:55] you will see that uh
[51:58] uh that the hearts of man the house of
[52:01] god calls man
[52:03] always goes to the people that are less
[52:05] privileged
[52:07] praise the lord
[52:09] because sometimes the people that are
[52:12] that are privileged
[52:13] don't even know the privilege they have
[52:16] amen their privilege gets so much in
[52:18] their hair that they don't know the
[52:20] privilege they have
[52:21] and uh and you know uh
[52:24] instead of appreciating the privilege
[52:25] that has been given to them they want to
[52:27] be the privileged one they want to be
[52:29] the one you know there must be worship
[52:31] the one that must be praised the one
[52:33] that must be you know everything so
[52:36] he moved it down
[52:39] live before he you know got
[52:42] uh
[52:43] into the place of the ministry and
[52:45] became you know even even after his
[52:48] ministry
[52:50] he talked to the hearts of children
[52:55] and
[52:57] he started one of the most powerful
[53:00] ministry
[53:03] and what he would do is that he would
[53:05] take his card
[53:07] and his hearses
[53:08] and he'll go around and pick up children
[53:10] from the street
[53:12] brother branham referred to that story
[53:14] what he called he said sunday school
[53:16] started from what they called the rare
[53:18] cage
[53:20] because all of those kids no matter what
[53:22] their status whether they have place to
[53:23] sleep they didn't have a place to sleep
[53:26] geo moody will pick them up
[53:28] and he started what we have today at
[53:30] sunday school you know where the church
[53:33] tried to make very classic and they
[53:35] tried to put different classes and
[53:36] different grades and different things
[53:38] when dear mother started that he was he
[53:41] has so much burden for these young young
[53:44] people young children
[53:46] and
[53:49] [Music]
[53:52] and that grew
[53:54] and there were a lot of a lot of
[53:55] preachers a lot of men that came out of
[53:58] that
[53:59] you know and that became revivalist that
[54:02] god saved and you know went on you know
[54:05] preaching
[54:06] and and serving the lord
[54:08] when i when i when i was
[54:11] reading there listening to that and and
[54:13] just thinking about it
[54:15] i just thought about what a generation
[54:18] that we are living in
[54:20] you know
[54:21] that
[54:23] we no longer see those those burden
[54:27] where people have just burden for
[54:31] the less privilege
[54:33] people have burden for people
[54:35] they are the
[54:36] you know that don't have
[54:39] opportunities
[54:40] you know and like brother branham said
[54:42] they are missionaries that don't have
[54:44] shoes on their feet
[54:46] and as long as this gospel will be
[54:48] preached
[54:49] that would still remain the
[54:50] truth praise the lord it's hard for you
[54:54] to imagine it because you have more than
[54:55] two three four pair of shoes
[54:58] but they are still missionaries that
[55:00] don't have shoes on their feet
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] praise the lord
[55:06] and uh so i have some some comments that
[55:09] i wanted to make this morning but i
[55:11] didn't then i thought just before i came
[55:13] out
[55:14] i just thought no i would i would
[55:15] reserve my comment and i would just i'll
[55:17] just be able to give the time to the
[55:19] preaching of the world this morning
[55:23] because we have a we have a missionary
[55:25] brother with us
[55:26] uh brother brother jeffrey
[55:29] and
[55:31] he's
[55:32] he's a brother uh he's he's a nigerian
[55:34] but a nationality uh ethnic nationality
[55:38] but a man that had a burden to go
[55:41] in the nothing part of ghana
[55:44] he actually came through malay
[55:46] and before he finally settled in that
[55:49] nothing part of ghana
[55:51] working uh
[55:53] malay bokina faso
[55:55] uh is uh uh on on the religious map is
[55:59] called is along the red zone of africa
[56:03] why is called the red zone is because
[56:06] naturally is hot

[56:12] area
[56:13] so it's called the red zone naturally
[56:16] it's a very hot place
[56:18] and it's a predominant muslim area so
[56:20] it's called the red zone of africa
[56:23] and
[56:24] and
[56:27] he's been working there now a couple of
[56:29] years
[56:30] and
[56:33] it's kind of a strange uh
[56:35] talking to
[56:37] sister muscle hussman
[56:39] and
[56:40] it turned out to be
[56:42] the same
[56:43] brother that honor wu's ministry her
[56:46] husband came to the message he's the
[56:48] same one on the wu's ministry brother
[56:50] jeffrey also came to the message that's
[56:52] brother c praying
[56:55] so uh
[56:56] uh

[56:59] comments and let the missionary speak
[57:01] he's the missionary
[57:03] he's the one that is out there on the

[1:07:17] uh that to me i said he has finished
[1:07:20] everything
[1:07:21] so i didn't see anything left i was
[1:07:23] saying
[1:07:24] so
[1:07:26] i want to say i thank god to be here

[1:07:37] part of the world
[1:07:38] especially in the u.s

[1:07:42] prophet said the greatest privilege
[1:07:45] that the servant of god will have is to
[1:07:47] speak to his pride
[1:07:49] so i count it a privilege
[1:07:51] and i thank god for your humility
[1:07:54] that
[1:07:57] you are here this morning to listen to
[1:07:59] listening to
[1:08:00] some common man like this from some
[1:08:03] horrible interior
[1:08:05] so god bless you for your humility
[1:08:08] and the god
[1:08:09] who have made us this day and i'm ready

[1:08:20] i don't want to do that to you people
[1:08:22] hallelujah
[1:08:25] and somebody asked me in the church i
[1:08:26] said pastor why do you like doing that
[1:08:28] yes
[1:08:29] when you when i say sit down you feel
[1:08:31] relaxed
[1:08:33] and when you feel relaxed you don't want
[1:08:35] to be
[1:08:36] you don't want to be on fire
[1:08:38] so you see
[1:08:39] you ask me how how come that when i'm in

[1:08:57] quickly so god bless you all i don't
[1:08:59] know if there is anything i supposed to
[1:09:01] say so pastor you forgive me and maybe
[1:09:04] you remind me and you help me to do that
[1:09:06] later
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:08] but i want god bless you
[1:09:12] you see your pastor i say
[1:09:15] it's something
[1:09:18] i don't i don't have the worst english
[1:09:20] expression to express him
[1:09:22] whether he's humble i don't know
[1:09:24] he tells you
[1:09:26] he's not a preacher man preacher man is
[1:09:28] here but he will preach and everybody
[1:09:30] will
[1:09:31] everybody heart will be on fire and
[1:09:33] looking for somewhere to run and hide

[1:18:23] oh hallelujah
[1:18:26] as we open to more scriptures
[1:18:30] just one
[1:18:31] one or two few more scriptures
[1:18:34] first john chapter 3 from verse 20
[1:18:38] in 22. if i'm not mistaken
[1:18:48] okay it's respite i got you
[1:18:51] killing me professor
[1:18:57] fair john chapter
[1:18:59] 3 yes that was it
[1:19:01] 20-22
[1:19:11] for if our hearts
[1:19:16] condemn us
[1:19:19] god
[1:19:20] is greater than our heart
[1:19:23] yes yes
[1:19:26] yes
[1:19:27] thank you lord
[1:19:28] thank you somebody smiled for me this
[1:19:30] morning
[1:19:31] i want somebody to smile let me look at
[1:19:33] your face
[1:19:39] the bible says if your heart condemns
[1:19:41] you
[1:19:43] the mercy of god that is what is telling
[1:19:45] you
[1:19:46] is greater than your heart
[1:19:50] thank you jesus
[1:19:52] if your heart condemned you
[1:19:55] we are not giving people
[1:20:01] uh how they call it liberty to go and
[1:20:04] mess
[1:20:04] yourself in the water
[1:20:07] no we are strictly against it
[1:20:10] because when you are saved
[1:20:12] by your fruit we shall know them
[1:20:15] but this is his mercy
[1:20:19] concerning his inheritance
[1:20:23] this is the portion of the heritage of
[1:20:25] the lord
[1:20:28] if your heart condemns us
[1:20:32] our god is greater than your heart
[1:20:36] and he know what all things
[1:20:40] now let's come down again
[1:20:43] but if our hearts
[1:20:46] condemn us not
[1:20:49] then we have confidence towards god
[1:20:53] good one
[1:20:54] in both sides
[1:20:57] we have
[1:20:58] grace
[1:21:00] when we fall we have grace
[1:21:02] when we are when we are standing we will
[1:21:04] have more grace
[1:21:06] yes so as for this
[1:21:09] bride
[1:21:11] they cannot be defeated
[1:21:14] because even if they are falling there
[1:21:16] is also a grace
[1:21:18] god made the way there
[1:21:22] in standing you are more than conqueror
[1:21:25] therefore the prophet said
[1:21:27] if the weakest
[1:21:29] hallelujah
[1:21:31] the weakest christian
[1:21:33] in your fallen states
[1:21:37] don't let the devil deceive you anytime
[1:21:41] and point you back to your your your
[1:21:43] fault
[1:21:44] and say for this reason god will not
[1:21:46] answer your prayer is telling lies
[1:21:52] you know that's the trick
[1:21:53] he weighs down we cannot even pray you
[1:21:55] know when you pray you're in trouble so
[1:21:57] we try to let you know that oh you have
[1:21:58] done this oh you know way back you see

[1:22:14] their knees down
[1:22:18] and pray
[1:22:20] the god that gives them courage
[1:22:23] to have faith
[1:22:26] in his word and still pray in that
[1:22:28] condition
[1:22:29] you just watch that
[1:22:31] it's still in that condition there is
[1:22:33] still a stink
[1:22:35] of love inside there

[1:24:33] but when he come to a place
[1:24:36] he remember
[1:24:39] why because no matter what he is he is
[1:24:42] going through he has involved himself
[1:24:44] there is still something inside there
[1:24:47] that can never be washed away
[1:24:50] that can never be taken
[1:24:52] no amount of bleach can clean it no
[1:24:54] amount of anointing that comes from a

[1:28:25] somebody was asking the prophet said
[1:28:29] now if somebody is a son of god

[1:28:44] god has a way to save him
[1:28:47] god has a corner to pull him to
[1:28:49] he himself know how to cry and come back
[1:28:51] to god
[1:28:56] that's what the prophet said
[1:28:58] all these trials and temptations
[1:29:04] are signed
[1:29:07] hallelujah
[1:29:08] now we have found favor from god
[1:29:14] god permitted it
[1:29:18] to drive us to his feet
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:23] to remember that
[1:29:25] we have a father
[1:29:27] who specializes
[1:29:29] in doing these things
[1:29:35] so our situations are even a blessing to
[1:29:39] us
[1:29:40] so why did you cry and shout
[1:29:43] i cannot i don't know why
[1:29:45] who told you you cannot you are more
[1:29:48] than cochlear
[1:29:52] you are born holy
[1:29:54] bo russia
[1:29:56] as peculiar people
[1:29:59] and royal priesthood
[1:30:01] holiness is your passion
[1:30:03] righteousness is your passion
[1:30:05] victory is your passion
[1:30:08] what you can say again
[1:30:09] i shot off english expression because
[1:30:12] i'm not deeply
[1:30:13] learned so is there anything you think
[1:30:16] you can say in addition and i will tell
[1:30:19] you it's your person
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:22] think it yourself
[1:30:25] just think it is your person
[1:30:27] [Applause]
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:31] it is not you who desire to be it
[1:30:34] it's not you who desire to be christian
[1:30:37] the prophet said
[1:30:39] hallelujah it's not our will
[1:30:43] that we'll be a christian
[1:30:45] it is not who we who desire god
[1:30:48] it is god who desires
[1:30:51] it is not one who seek god
[1:30:53] it is god who seekers
[1:30:55] if he cannot able to preserve you he
[1:30:58] can't do it
[1:31:02] doesn't stand retreat in anything he do
[1:31:05] so when he desires you he desires you
[1:31:07] forever
[1:31:09] you say what about those who fall away
[1:31:11] in the first place they were not there
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:15] so that's it
[1:31:16] don't tell me about those people no in
[1:31:18] the first place they were not there
[1:31:24] because we have personators
[1:31:27] is that right
[1:31:29] we have it the prophet said
[1:31:31] the devil will bring in some catholic
[1:31:33] and some methodists and they believe
[1:31:34] like judas to the end and find a way so
[1:31:36] in the first place they were catholic
[1:31:39] in the first place they were methodists
[1:31:41] in the past place they were
[1:31:42] denominational as psychologically
[1:31:45] experienced people
[1:31:47] they were not there
[1:31:50] so at the end
[1:31:52] everybody to his journey
[1:31:54] everybody to where he comes from
[1:31:58] it's not fight
[1:32:02] not argument amen

[1:36:25] it's because they are afraid of the
[1:36:26] thing
[1:36:30] when they are scoffing at you
[1:36:33] trying to say all kind of words because
[1:36:35] of your nature
[1:36:38] of god love in your heart
[1:36:41] it's not that they are better than you
[1:36:43] the secret is that they are afraid of
[1:36:45] you
[1:36:47] so know that today
[1:36:49] so don't be ashamed
[1:36:52] they look at me they laugh at me
[1:36:55] they are afraid of you
[1:36:59] they are wondering
[1:37:01] where in this world in this
[1:37:04] generation
[1:37:06] somebody will still be living like this
[1:37:09] [Music]
[1:37:13] we must try to talk him out
[1:37:16] because we don't know where this kind of
[1:37:18] nature comes from so they are wondering
[1:37:23] what happened and this man can live like
[1:37:25] this
[1:37:26] this woman can live i don't understand
[1:37:29] it
[1:37:29] they are afraid of it
[1:37:33] we find many people who can't understand
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:39] why we are so happy
[1:37:43] we have crossed over this world
[1:37:45] but they don't know the world and they
[1:37:47] are thinking where in this world
[1:37:50] where this new thing thinking come from
[1:37:54] what kind of understanding
[1:37:56] makes them to be living like this
[1:37:58] why
[1:37:59] they cannot do it
[1:38:04] they can't understand it
[1:38:08] until they come through the same process
[1:38:10] like you yes
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:17] they are afraid of you let me tell you
[1:38:19] the truth
[1:38:23] it's just like
[1:38:27] back at home our dogs
[1:38:31] the back when you are coming they start
[1:38:33] backing go go go go
[1:38:34] go
[1:38:37] go go
[1:38:39] but when they back
[1:38:42] and you do a silly mistake and run
[1:38:46] then you know how powerful and dangerous
[1:38:48] the dog is
[1:38:52] that's right
[1:38:54] the dogs see you you don't understand
[1:38:56] what you are coming to do
[1:38:58] just ask the people in the world they
[1:39:00] don't understand they see your life they
[1:39:02] don't understand what kind of life
[1:39:04] living
[1:39:05] what is this man up to
[1:39:07] what's this sister up to when they bring
[1:39:10] issue he raises to this place what is
[1:39:12] this we are talking about business we
[1:39:14] are talking about every kid you are
[1:39:15] talking say yes
[1:39:18] they are just like that dog
[1:39:20] when you are coming even you are
[1:39:23] visiting the house you might even be a
[1:39:25] brother to the owner of the dog but
[1:39:30] you don't know who he is
[1:39:32] you don't know what to do what he's can
[1:39:34] see
[1:39:35] whether he's an alien whether he when he
[1:39:37] runs a chasing
[1:39:39] but when he say go go go go
[1:39:42] you stand
[1:39:44] and he said whoa whoa whoa
[1:39:46] you take a step forward
[1:39:49] watch the dog he will take a step
[1:39:50] backwards
[1:39:52] he will not run
[1:39:55] he will not run
[1:39:56] he will take a step backwards
[1:40:00] he will look at you he will not leave
[1:40:02] you he will still look at you
[1:40:04] it will continue
[1:40:06] world war
[1:40:08] and watch when you take another step
[1:40:10] forward he will take another step
[1:40:13] backward
[1:40:14] he does it right
[1:40:16] but he will still continue
[1:40:18] work work
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:22] that is what it is
[1:40:24] when you are living for the glory of god
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] the bible says we are royal
[1:40:32] priesthood
[1:40:34] holy nation
[1:40:36] peculiar people
[1:40:38] to live for the praises
[1:40:41] and the glory
[1:40:43] of the one
[1:40:45] who called us
[1:40:49] and that life
[1:40:51] is the life of god
[1:40:53] the character of god
[1:40:56] the power of god
[1:40:57] the prophecy the life and the character
[1:41:00] the character of god is the power of god
[1:41:04] and that power
[1:41:06] cannot be defeated
[1:41:08] that power is the light
[1:41:10] that shines upon darkness
[1:41:13] and darkness cannot hold it back
[1:41:27] god is our portion
[1:41:36] royalness
[1:41:37] there is something about ruins you have
[1:41:39] them here
[1:41:42] look at the rope running robin graham
[1:41:46] they have a name that
[1:41:47] we give them back to when they want to
[1:41:49] fool yourself
[1:41:50] as they say are they calling sweeping
[1:41:52] the floor or something like that
[1:41:56] a whole lot of name they
[1:41:58] give but no matter what you say about
[1:42:01] them
[1:42:03] they have the authority over you
[1:42:09] are you with me now
[1:42:11] they still have the royal authority
[1:42:14] [Music]
[1:42:18] and when they are doing it they are
[1:42:20] doing it in hiding
[1:42:21] because they knew if you know
[1:42:24] they know what your god can do to them
[1:42:30] you speak ill of aruya
[1:42:32] and he ate
[1:42:34] if god mercy didn't remember you you are
[1:42:36] gone in that
[1:42:37] in that country
[1:42:45] the bible said
[1:42:47] in this world you will have sorrow
[1:42:50] and they will rejoice
[1:42:53] but be of good courage
[1:43:00] i will be with you amen
[1:43:04] and he said
[1:43:08] either enjoy it to the end yes
[1:43:12] shall see me
[1:43:14] and i will wipe up you your tears
[1:43:18] and he said
[1:43:19] the door that the satan has locked he
[1:43:21] will open it
[1:43:25] so we don't have any cause
[1:43:27] to be afraid
[1:43:29] and we don't have any cost to
[1:43:32] be distabbed
[1:43:34] we don't have any cause to be worried
[1:43:40] the spirit of our sonship
[1:43:43] has all the result of everything in it
[1:43:48] it is only we who can disregard it
[1:43:54] the devil can do you nothing
[1:43:58] the only person
[1:44:00] you say what about god i say this
[1:44:03] morning
[1:44:04] god can do you nothing
[1:44:10] why
[1:44:13] but god is not god can do you nothing
[1:44:17] it is only you can do yourself something
[1:44:27] god put everything in your hands
[1:44:30] your decision will tell your direction
[1:44:32] and what you will go through
[1:44:36] because we are made of free moral agents
[1:44:43] so who even god can do you nothing not
[1:44:46] because god don't have the power he made
[1:44:48] his law and god cannot go contrary to
[1:44:51] his law
[1:44:57] god is obligated to his law the prophet
[1:45:01] said he made the law he can't make a law
[1:45:03] and give you and he will leave another
[1:45:05] one say no
[1:45:07] you say we do if we if he can give you a
[1:45:09] law to follow and he will do another one
[1:45:12] he will not come down and suffer in the
[1:45:14] hands of his recent creation
[1:45:17] when he has power to just speak and
[1:45:21] wipe all of them out of the world and we
[1:45:23] start another new world
[1:45:25] and that same man will have that power
[1:45:27] came and be suffering for you to slap
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:32] god can do you nothing
[1:45:36] the reason is that
[1:45:38] god loves you
[1:45:40] more than jesus christ
[1:45:45] the prophet said it amen say god love
[1:45:48] you mother jesus christ
[1:45:54] you have your money
[1:45:56] you are hungry
[1:45:58] will you eat your money
[1:46:01] the money is the power
[1:46:03] but eat your money let me see
[1:46:05] you need to buy bread
[1:46:07] so therefore
[1:46:09] god has to give jesus christ to get you
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:20] god has to give jesus christ to get you
[1:46:25] so who is more important the money and
[1:46:27] the bread
[1:46:28] the bread
[1:46:32] hallelujah
[1:46:35] may god have mercy
[1:46:37] brother we need to know the
[1:46:41] oration
[1:46:42] of our breath
[1:46:46] only that
[1:46:47] nothing can move you
[1:46:52] nothing can overtake you unaware
[1:46:55] you have everything in control
[1:46:58] when you know the origin of your best
[1:47:02] this sin is just nothing
[1:47:05] because you knew
[1:47:07] that he has paid it
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:11] hallelujah
[1:47:13] gave his life
[1:47:15] hallelujah
[1:47:18] to deliver every one of them that is in
[1:47:20] bondage of sin because of fear
[1:47:26] so whosoever the son of man is suffering
[1:47:29] he's free indeed
[1:47:31] for the son of man have come
[1:47:34] to destroy the work of the enemy
[1:47:39] where
[1:47:41] if it's in the atmosphere then you
[1:47:43] wouldn't have seen the devil again
[1:47:47] in the life of his elect
[1:47:52] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:47:54] the world
[1:47:58] god is moving
[1:48:00] a little while you see but they don't
[1:48:02] see him
[1:48:07] you can see you can experience
[1:48:10] you can witness the power of his
[1:48:12] presence but they can see nothing
[1:48:18] that's the difference
[1:48:23] the power of god is the very most alive
[1:48:28] fresh for them
[1:48:30] that
[1:48:42] that one tells you
[1:48:46] the kind of authority you have over this
[1:48:48] life you are living
[1:48:54] praise the lord
[1:48:57] a true christian is born to be decent
[1:49:02] it's not a quote i'm just telling you
[1:49:04] something
[1:49:05] hallelujah
[1:49:07] and that is perfect truth
[1:49:12] in a way appearance
[1:49:15] because they are born royal
[1:49:18] carrying
[1:49:19] a royal blood
[1:49:25] and in them
[1:49:27] decision
[1:49:29] of life of god
[1:49:34] and that cj creates the love of god in
[1:49:38] dance
[1:49:40] and that makes them desire
[1:49:43] always to want to do the will of the
[1:49:46] father
[1:49:48] no matter where they find themselves
[1:49:51] though is not difficult
[1:49:53] though is not easy
[1:49:54] but there is still something telling
[1:49:57] them
[1:49:58] that is why you can do wrong and you can
[1:50:00] cry and know you have done wrong
[1:50:02] when people have done multiple of wrong
[1:50:05] and they didn't even know whether they
[1:50:06] have done wrong but you once you did
[1:50:09] wrong you go crow
[1:50:11] how come you know you have done wrong
[1:50:13] and somebody did more than that
[1:50:15] worse and he didn't know that i have
[1:50:17] done nothing
[1:50:21] that tells you you are still a child of
[1:50:22] god
[1:50:24] you are still a victim
[1:50:27] you can still overcome
[1:50:28] [Music]
[1:50:30] because something tell you what you did
[1:50:32] was wrong
[1:50:33] and that voice that spoke to you
[1:50:36] that is the seed gem of god in you
[1:50:39] telling you you are still carrying god
[1:50:45] are you with me
[1:50:53] let me go help us in jesus name
[1:50:55] that caused them to always want to do
[1:50:58] the will of god
[1:51:04] to please the father
[1:51:06] as we just read now right now in the
[1:51:08] scripture
[1:51:09] hallelujah
[1:51:10] in the book of first peter
[1:51:14] hallelujah
[1:51:16] praise the lord
[1:51:19] that we are holy pursuit
[1:51:23] listening to offer
[1:51:26] amen
[1:51:29] of spiritual sacrifice
[1:51:35] now not just a sacrifice of every kind
[1:51:38] of
[1:51:39] way you want to serve god or religion or
[1:51:41] denomination
[1:51:44] but the scripture said a sacrifice that
[1:51:47] is acceptable
[1:51:51] that's why you are very careful
[1:51:53] that is why when you do things and you
[1:51:55] went wrong you're ah you cry you shout
[1:51:58] because you there is something telling
[1:52:00] you
[1:52:01] you are born to offer a spiritual
[1:52:04] sacrifice that is acceptable
[1:52:08] not just a sacrifice
[1:52:11] not just a church member
[1:52:14] and come here and be fighting everything
[1:52:16] that they said
[1:52:17] think you are somebody else or
[1:52:19] whatsoever you think
[1:52:23] when you are born again
[1:52:28] your nation become different
[1:52:33] listen a spiritual sacrifice
[1:52:36] now
[1:52:37] we are coming back to where i say we'll
[1:52:39] come to again
[1:52:41] acceptable
[1:52:44] to god
[1:52:47] so how do you know
[1:52:49] it's acceptable to god
[1:52:52] it must be by jesus christ
[1:53:00] hallelujah
[1:53:03] to god by jesus christ
[1:53:07] means to god by his words
[1:53:11] to god according to his word
[1:53:14] christ the words hallelujah
[1:53:19] first john said
[1:53:21] in the beginning was the word
[1:53:23] and the word was with god
[1:53:25] and the word was god
[1:53:26] and the word was made flesh
[1:53:29] we saw him as the son jesus christ so a
[1:53:32] spiritual sacrifice
[1:53:35] acceptable unto god according by his
[1:53:39] words
[1:53:41] christ that was made flesh
[1:53:46] and
[1:53:48] the bible said
[1:53:50] in the book of isaiah
[1:53:52] he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:53:58] that's the word
[1:54:01] meet flesh
[1:54:04] a man of sorrow
[1:54:06] when we look at him
[1:54:09] there is no beauty in him
[1:54:12] hallelujah
[1:54:15] praise the lord
[1:54:16] that we may love to associate ourself
[1:54:18] with him
[1:54:24] hallelujah
[1:54:28] i want us to read that scripture i
[1:54:30] always like reading that scripture
[1:54:32] praise the lord
[1:54:34] let's just go through it say common
[1:54:35] scripture about there is good it's good
[1:54:38] to read it once while again
[1:54:40] he said isaiah chapter 54 is 53. he said
[1:54:43] let me start from verse 2.
[1:54:45] he said
[1:54:48] for he shall go up before him the word
[1:54:52] we are talking about the word now
[1:54:55] he shall go up before him
[1:54:58] as a tender plant grow rather sorry
[1:55:02] he had no form
[1:55:05] is that right
[1:55:06] no comeliness
[1:55:09] and when we shall see him
[1:55:12] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:55:15] him
[1:55:18] he is despised rejected of man
[1:55:22] a man of sorrow
[1:55:26] and acquainted with grief
[1:55:29] and we hide as
[1:55:30] it were
[1:55:33] ourselves from him
[1:55:37] he was despised
[1:55:39] and we esteem him not
[1:55:42] surely he had burned our grief
[1:55:47] is
[1:55:48] hallelujah
[1:55:50] and carried our
[1:55:52] sorrow
[1:55:54] yet we
[1:55:56] esteem him
[1:55:58] striking
[1:56:00] smithing of god
[1:56:03] and
[1:56:04] afflicted
[1:56:06] but he was wounded for our transgression
[1:56:11] he was bruised for our iniquity
[1:56:15] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:56:18] him
[1:56:19] and with his stripes we were here
[1:56:23] can somebody say amen
[1:56:25] or you become too familiar with the
[1:56:27] scripture
[1:56:32] may god help us
[1:56:35] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:56:40] we have
[1:56:41] turned away one two is always are you
[1:56:45] with me now
[1:56:47] and the lord had led on him the iniquity
[1:56:52] of you and me
[1:56:56] oh
[1:56:56] hallelujah
[1:57:01] he was oppressed
[1:57:03] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[1:57:07] his mouth
[1:57:09] i love that particular place
[1:57:13] it kept quiet not because it's not
[1:57:15] painful
[1:57:16] because you have something in his mind
[1:57:19] you want to
[1:57:22] achieve he knew the bible said
[1:57:26] he knew because
[1:57:29] we are bad men
[1:57:32] so therefore he had compassion
[1:57:35] and go through for us
[1:57:37] he knew we had our failures we we have
[1:57:40] our shortcoming we have our obstacles
[1:57:43] but he has loved us
[1:57:49] not because we are somebody better
[1:57:51] but because we were within in him before
[1:57:55] the foundation of the world
[1:57:57] we are his offspring
[1:57:59] we are his sibling
[1:58:02] hallelujah
[1:58:03] elohim become jehovah
[1:58:08] how can he afford to lose his own
[1:58:12] so he opened not his match
[1:58:15] because he's all his mind is to get back
[1:58:18] his dreams he need his sibling back
[1:58:21] he can't afford to lose their fellowship
[1:58:24] you don't know what your fellowship
[1:58:26] means to god
[1:58:28] and satan will put in your heart and you
[1:58:30] think to come to serve the lord is come
[1:58:32] to churches
[1:58:33] it's just
[1:58:34] it's just a religious stuff
[1:58:36] regular things
[1:58:39] okay
[1:58:40] don't forget that the prophet said the
[1:58:43] greatest victory satan can have over you
[1:58:46] is to hinder you from coming to church
[1:58:48] go and google it me i'm not a good
[1:58:50] google man but he's there in my mind
[1:58:52] i cannot tell you
[1:58:56] so when you are thinking it's just a 99
[1:58:59] it's nothing something that it's not
[1:59:01] something it's not something
[1:59:06] it's not a strange thing for you not to
[1:59:07] come to church
[1:59:09] any little thing you you just sit in the
[1:59:11] house any little thing you just throw
[1:59:12] church away
[1:59:14] don't forget the prophet said
[1:59:17] the greatest victory that satan can have
[1:59:20] over you
[1:59:22] is to hinder you from coming to church
[1:59:26] if i want to break it down we will leave
[1:59:28] the sermon again let me stay here so you
[1:59:30] go do your research
[1:59:32] hallelujah
[1:59:34] so it is a terrible and a horrible thing
[1:59:37] it's a thing of do or die or to cry
[1:59:41] for you to miss church just one service
[1:59:46] you don't need your pastor
[1:59:48] that is why the reason satan is mad over
[1:59:51] the pastors
[1:59:53] and the ministers and those that go
[1:59:55] encourage you
[1:59:56] anyone can encourage you in the house
[1:59:58] he's in ten thousand trouble when he's
[2:00:01] going back home
[2:00:07] yes
[2:00:09] because that is his greatest victory
[2:00:11] that is the first step he used and
[2:00:14] finally sideline you
[2:00:16] so when you when your pastor prayed for
[2:00:19] you
[2:00:20] sister allah didn't come to church
[2:00:22] pastor and his house is in trouble
[2:00:25] so you don't know that
[2:00:28] any brother sitting there saying pray oh
[2:00:31] sister this is in the hospital god
[2:00:33] delivered that brother and the sister is
[2:00:35] in trouble
[2:00:37] you see
[2:00:38] don't say them brother jeffrey will not
[2:00:40] pray again because i don't
[2:00:46] you are ordained for that
[2:00:51] [Applause]
[2:00:54] god made you go to the situation
[2:00:57] that is why the prophecy you are the
[2:00:59] solution to all the problems
[2:01:02] so as god cannot draw from his
[2:01:03] responsibility you cannot draw from your
[2:01:06] responsibility
[2:01:08] because you are manifestly declaring god
[2:01:10] to the people
[2:01:12] you are showing that god is alive
[2:01:14] and he's still the same
[2:01:16] yesterday today forever
[2:01:20] so in you if god is healing today it's
[2:01:24] you
[2:01:25] if god is setting free today is you yes
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:31] god gives you authority to remit
[2:01:33] people's sin
[2:01:34] amen whosoever see you remitted is
[2:01:37] remitted
[2:01:39] so god put salvation for your gift to
[2:01:41] people
[2:01:42] that is why anybody that tried to help
[2:01:45] you in your time of difficulty god gave
[2:01:47] him salvation
[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:51] whatsoever you do to this little one
[2:01:54] for that reason
[2:01:56] go into the rest
[2:01:57] that the father came for you you didn't
[2:01:59] want it you didn't believe the message
[2:02:02] but because of what you do to support
[2:02:05] and make life a little bit bearable
[2:02:08] comfortable for one of these little ones
[2:02:12] there you go
[2:02:14] free road access
[2:02:17] work your way to the kingdom
[2:02:24] are you with me
[2:02:31] god make you that
[2:02:35] let me give you one example
[2:02:38] so sometimes when we are fighting
[2:02:41] ministers because of what they preach
[2:02:44] or maybe they encourage us
[2:02:47] something we start
[2:02:49] straight
[2:02:51] going around like a rattlesnake
[2:02:54] looking for somebody to just
[2:02:56] why
[2:02:59] don't forget the money so if anything
[2:03:01] sometimes we see when the ministers are
[2:03:03] in situations
[2:03:05] there is become the opportunity for the
[2:03:07] satanist
[2:03:08] every time he's talking with his life
[2:03:11] he's suffering for a sin he's not
[2:03:13] sacrificing
[2:03:15] maybe suffering for the prayer i pray
[2:03:17] for you
[2:03:20] so be careful with your pastor
[2:03:22] because god will not take it
[2:03:24] so ah brother gave me but i won't bribe
[2:03:26] this guy today
[2:03:28] i don't i didn't even know this i'm
[2:03:30] coming to this but since he come here i
[2:03:32] want to let you know something
[2:03:34] you are made for that to pray it's not
[2:03:36] only him that's why i said not only
[2:03:38] pastor when you pray for his sister and
[2:03:41] encourage the brother
[2:03:43] to be restored
[2:03:44] you are in trouble a danger with the
[2:03:47] city they sit down
[2:03:51] for doing that
[2:03:53] i went to a city called sunderman to
[2:03:56] share tracks
[2:03:57] and
[2:03:58] after i would share the tracks i came
[2:04:00] back again
[2:04:01] and i went back again
[2:04:04] i rented a place took a brother
[2:04:07] that would stay with me
[2:04:09] start a little service
[2:04:12] when i went to the when i get back home
[2:04:13] in quintan pool
[2:04:15] all my house is in trouble
[2:04:18] i was sick almost to death
[2:04:20] i won't pass on and god brought me back
[2:04:23] because god answered my wife's prayer
[2:04:26] that's why i say you are dead for that
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:30] amen are you with me
[2:04:33] and
[2:04:34] we went to the hospital
[2:04:36] what doctor said and i asked him
[2:04:39] say pastor we could not find anything
[2:04:41] but the only thing is that you people
[2:04:44] are dying
[2:04:45] so when i saw when she said that i said
[2:04:48] sister i want no problem i know the pro
[2:04:50] no don't worry i know the problem
[2:04:56] we are all dying but all the whole lab
[2:04:59] tests and everything they can do shows
[2:05:01] new results
[2:05:04] but we are dying before the eyes
[2:05:08] i said don't don't don't just worry
[2:05:11] about it
[2:05:12] i know the issues
[2:05:15] but i don't know where it's coming from
[2:05:17] but i know
[2:05:18] what is behind it
[2:05:23] so
[2:05:24] when we get back on
[2:05:27] the team become worse
[2:05:30] seriously sick
[2:05:33] and i had a dream
[2:05:36] and that dream
[2:05:38] i was in my house lying down
[2:05:40] a whole lot of demons were just coming
[2:05:44] and they were approaching me
[2:05:47] and when they approaching
[2:05:49] the spirit said that
[2:05:51] these are the
[2:05:53] ghosts of the land of santa monica
[2:05:56] and i said
[2:05:57] for what
[2:05:59] they are coming to me because
[2:06:01] i've gone to deliver the people
[2:06:06] so when they approach
[2:06:07] in the dream
[2:06:09] i was lying in my house they are outside
[2:06:12] but they don't have any access to entire
[2:06:13] house
[2:06:14] and they were just making noise outside
[2:06:17] that
[2:06:18] why did you come to sandman
[2:06:22] because you have come to sanima we are
[2:06:24] going to deal with you and you are gone
[2:06:27] tonight
[2:06:32] and immediately i dreamed that dream
[2:06:36] i don't know what happened
[2:06:38] i found myself
[2:06:41] in a
[2:06:42] open feet
[2:06:45] walking
[2:06:47] beautiful grassland
[2:06:50] bright the buildings are far away but
[2:06:53] bright just like light
[2:06:56] wonderful land
[2:06:57] and i say what beautiful place is this
[2:07:01] wow so i was walking
[2:07:04] close to something like to a gate
[2:07:09] such a beautiful grassland all over
[2:07:11] green grass and everything that was
[2:07:13] bright
[2:07:16] so when i was walking walking i started
[2:07:20] hearing
[2:07:21] the voice of someone praying
[2:07:25] but i was approaching the gate
[2:07:27] i was hearing somebody
[2:07:29] praying
[2:07:31] so immediately i get to the gate
[2:07:35] and the one that was with me
[2:07:38] said
[2:07:39] you cannot go back
[2:07:41] somebody is praying for you
[2:07:47] and when i woke up
[2:07:50] my wife was praying i was just looking
[2:07:51] at her
[2:07:53] crying
[2:07:55] i woke up more than 30 minutes at least
[2:07:57] turn it out because i woke up i saw her
[2:07:58] praying so
[2:08:00] was she the one that was here in a
[2:08:02] prayer
[2:08:04] more than 30 minutes
[2:08:08] i don't know what happened and she
[2:08:09] stopped i don't know maybe i push
[2:08:12] i mystically pull her or and she noticed
[2:08:16] that
[2:08:17] this man is alive
[2:08:19] and she stopped
[2:08:20] and she grabbed me and she was crying
[2:08:23] i see why are you crying
[2:08:26] what's the matter
[2:08:28] i'm asking him
[2:08:30] see for the past one hour
[2:08:33] i didn't
[2:08:34] breathe i'm gone
[2:08:39] the past one hour
[2:08:42] she has been praying
[2:08:43] and i said how how did you know he said
[2:08:46] i was coughing and she woke up
[2:08:48] i coughed for more than 30 minutes
[2:08:52] and the last cough i
[2:08:54] the last one i made that i just was like
[2:08:58] i
[2:08:58] something pulled me up from the bed and
[2:09:01] hit me back to the bed
[2:09:03] and immediately that
[2:09:06] try to
[2:09:08] see if i'm still having
[2:09:10] whether something is wrong or still
[2:09:12] alive and she found out that no breath
[2:09:16] he do all he's good no brill shake me
[2:09:18] pull me no movement
[2:09:20] does she know something has happened
[2:09:23] i'm gone
[2:09:24] and she was crying
[2:09:26] praying
[2:09:30] then i remember when the spirit said
[2:09:35] somebody's praying for you so you can go
[2:09:37] back oh yeah
[2:09:38] amen
[2:09:44] and she also had a dream
[2:09:46] the same like me
[2:09:50] and the demons said
[2:09:52] to her that they are going to destroy my
[2:09:55] life
[2:09:56] take my life tonight because i went to
[2:09:58] san dima so my dream and her dream took
[2:10:02] me into that trance and go into that
[2:10:05] land and the spirit told me somebody is
[2:10:07] praying for me i cannot go back
[2:10:11] what am i trying to tell you i just want
[2:10:13] to let you know that anybody who pray
[2:10:16] for god to intervene in your life is in
[2:10:18] danger with the devil
[2:10:21] so that is why we must be careful
[2:10:23] with our ministers our pastor because in
[2:10:25] their house they are praying for you
[2:10:28] and they are doing that prayer
[2:10:29] unconsciously to the attack of the devil
[2:10:38] there was a sister
[2:10:40] before i left and come
[2:10:42] 12 months you haven't delivered
[2:10:45] and i didn't know and they told me
[2:10:48] and i it happened that i came for
[2:10:49] service that day at the church
[2:10:52] and she couldn't she was not in the
[2:10:54] church
[2:10:56] and he told me that 12 months no
[2:10:58] deliverance he's going to take him 14
[2:11:01] months
[2:11:02] and i said
[2:11:03] why
[2:11:05] everybody let me know what is going on
[2:11:07] so i was there that
[2:11:10] sat friday evening for service
[2:11:13] and i have to come back on sunday again
[2:11:15] for the morning service
[2:11:17] so that saturday struck on sunday
[2:11:21] i had
[2:11:22] something like a dream whether i see
[2:11:24] trans i can't tell
[2:11:27] but what i saw
[2:11:30] was that a little child was hung on a
[2:11:33] very tall tree
[2:11:36] and that child was calling my name and i
[2:11:39] was inside the house sleeping
[2:11:41] so i was still lying in the bed and i
[2:11:43] heard it like as we are sitting down
[2:11:45] this is midnight
[2:11:47] who's calling my name when i want to
[2:11:49] live sleep it's time to sleep
[2:11:53] and the name the child was calling
[2:11:56] it's just like what the prophet said he
[2:11:58] said
[2:11:59] zacchaeus was calling
[2:12:01] he said thou son of david hallelujah
[2:12:05] he was calling my name
[2:12:08] that nobody knew it's you have to be a
[2:12:10] member of my family back at home from
[2:12:12] nigeria where i come before you can know
[2:12:14] me in that name
[2:12:17] what kind of baby crying and calling my
[2:12:20] name like this
[2:12:21] and how
[2:12:23] did he know me
[2:12:26] and when i started hearing the cry
[2:12:28] something started telling me
[2:12:31] he's my shy my wife is not pregnant
[2:12:36] how this is my child
[2:12:39] so i felt within me
[2:12:41] it was the demo
[2:12:43] so i wanted to rebuke it
[2:12:45] and i could not rebuke it my hands was
[2:12:47] tight
[2:12:50] i struggled to rebuild my hands was
[2:12:52] tight so it's like when i opened my
[2:12:54] house
[2:12:55] i was on the bed
[2:12:57] my blanket
[2:12:58] that i'm using to sleep
[2:13:00] tied my hands
[2:13:04] and i heard a voice and said
[2:13:09] he's calling for you today for
[2:13:11] deliverance
[2:13:13] but the name i don't know the particular
[2:13:15] side
[2:13:17] then i kneel down and commit that dream
[2:13:20] because the prophet said
[2:13:22] when god reverses this to us it's not
[2:13:25] something to scare us
[2:13:27] it's not that we are we are defeated
[2:13:30] he said god make you to see it
[2:13:33] because he has kept in you
[2:13:36] what it takes to handle it
[2:13:38] so when you see your dreams don't come
[2:13:40] here and be waking up
[2:13:42] i'm dead and you want to go outside
[2:13:44] you're afraid when you start your key
[2:13:46] your car you enter your car you start
[2:13:48] you remember that you got accident and
[2:13:49] you are afraid to go out i won't go out
[2:13:51] today i will not go to
[2:13:54] god has just showed you what he wants
[2:13:57] you to handle
[2:13:59] and he knew that you have what he takes
[2:14:03] that is why he make you to see it
[2:14:07] so anytime you see horrible dreams of
[2:14:09] vision
[2:14:10] don't be scared that is the evidence
[2:14:13] that
[2:14:14] god has kept in you the solution
[2:14:18] it's just on your knees and faith
[2:14:21] that is all
[2:14:24] my father went so we also
[2:14:27] work
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:32] and i prayed through the night
[2:14:35] so that sunday service
[2:14:37] so when i came to i was ushered into the
[2:14:40] puppet
[2:14:41] i was supposed to start my cement
[2:14:43] but i was just talking about
[2:14:46] what i s the experience i had in the
[2:14:48] night
[2:14:49] and i said i don't even know who the
[2:14:51] person is
[2:14:52] but the name that child is calling
[2:14:54] and he's referring eyes my shy
[2:14:57] my wife is not pregnant
[2:14:59] so all of a sudden
[2:15:01] we turn it
[2:15:02] to a prayer service that morning
[2:15:05] and we have to pray
[2:15:07] and send somebody
[2:15:09] because she can't get up she's just
[2:15:10] lying on the stomach he's there going to
[2:15:12] the 14th month
[2:15:15] somebody to go lay hers upon her that we
[2:15:17] have prayed for her
[2:15:19] and i went back
[2:15:21] and that weekend in my house we were
[2:15:23] praying again in my house
[2:15:25] on saturday
[2:15:26] and on sunday
[2:15:29] they called me and said
[2:15:31] on saturday night they rushed to the
[2:15:33] hospital and she delivered
[2:15:35] [Music]
[2:15:38] now you say
[2:15:39] what happened
[2:15:41] what have that got to do with me
[2:15:43] when she delivered
[2:15:46] she said
[2:15:47] a spirit came and meet her and told her
[2:15:49] that
[2:15:52] brother jeffrey
[2:15:54] he's in trouble
[2:15:57] what did jeffrey did say yes pastor
[2:16:01] because he has stood to deliver you
[2:16:05] now it is not for him
[2:16:08] so she quickly called my wife
[2:16:10] and told my wife i was in the mission
[2:16:12] field and i told my wife i said that
[2:16:14] devo
[2:16:15] he doesn't see where
[2:16:19] the devil lack revelation
[2:16:21] for him to say brother jeffrey deliver
[2:16:24] is the wrong revelation
[2:16:26] jesus christ delivered
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:31] so by revelation he has failed
[2:16:34] he missed the wrong the right the right
[2:16:36] person
[2:16:37] and by the time we get there i see the
[2:16:39] right person he himself is in trouble
[2:16:44] so i told my wife oh that is the
[2:16:46] evidence that the devil is defeated
[2:16:49] because he said it was brother jeffrey
[2:16:51] and i was not the one
[2:16:53] and my wife could know that i said call
[2:16:55] the sister back and tell him that the
[2:16:57] devil is defeated
[2:16:59] he went and said i am the one whereas i
[2:17:01] was not the one
[2:17:05] now why did i say this
[2:17:09] i am saying when you go and pray for
[2:17:12] somebody
[2:17:14] you are in trouble
[2:17:17] why because you are trying to deliver
[2:17:19] somebody
[2:17:20] from the hands of the enemy
[2:17:23] and the devil don't want that
[2:17:28] how did we jump come to this place
[2:17:32] the prophet said
[2:17:34] when you the greatest victory satan can
[2:17:37] have over you
[2:17:39] is to hinder you from coming to church
[2:17:44] because he knew faith coming by hearing
[2:17:49] and faith is our victory
[2:17:51] over him
[2:17:53] so he don't want you
[2:17:55] so anytime you message
[2:17:57] you miss a lot
[2:18:00] it's better you be crying don't take it
[2:18:02] as a a common thing
[2:18:04] oh this is america you know that's the
[2:18:06] nature of our country yes but the
[2:18:07] prophecy told you that when you miss
[2:18:09] church is the greatest victory satan has
[2:18:11] value it's not even your sickness you
[2:18:13] have it's not even the problem it's not
[2:18:15] even the thing you fall into it's when
[2:18:17] you fail to come to church one it's a
[2:18:20] big victory satan heart
[2:18:24] now you think that
[2:18:25] why because god made us for fellowship
[2:18:30] and he could not afford to lose his
[2:18:33] fellowship with us
[2:18:37] because we are a sibling
[2:18:41] before the foundation of the world we
[2:18:43] were the one who were existing with him
[2:18:46] we were the one that encouraged god
[2:18:48] and made god happy to continue his work
[2:18:51] see
[2:18:52] new doctrine
[2:18:54] the new doctrine
[2:18:56] it's not a new doctrine
[2:18:58] what did the scripture say
[2:19:00] solomon said
[2:19:02] hallelujah i was by him when god was
[2:19:05] asking joe where were you god gave
[2:19:07] solomon the solution he said i was by
[2:19:09] him
[2:19:11] doing what
[2:19:12] rejoicing and what the prophet said he
[2:19:15] said when god said let there be light i
[2:19:16] was like and we jump up and say oh papa
[2:19:23] we are giving him fans
[2:19:25] we are encouraging it
[2:19:27] let water come out and water come out we
[2:19:29] are by him and we see you say wow
[2:19:39] we were giving him first and he was in
[2:19:40] courage
[2:19:44] we were his fans so he cannot
[2:19:47] cannot do without us
[2:19:49] we are encouragement to god
[2:19:53] may god have mercy and help us
[2:19:56] hallelujah
[2:19:58] we are a great medal yeah because our
[2:20:02] father
[2:20:03] is the king of all kings
[2:20:08] god is our father
[2:20:10] and he is the king of hawkins
[2:20:13] so we are the priest of priest
[2:20:17] hallelujah
[2:20:19] we are the souls and daughter kings and
[2:20:21] queen

[2:23:23] i came to that and his sister was with
[2:23:24] you where is she
[2:23:26] so
[2:23:27] this is a wish
[2:23:29] i'm not telling you

[2:24:54] but when they are in the world where
[2:24:56] their power can walk they walk
[2:24:58] but in my house
[2:25:00] is the lord jesus christ
[2:25:02] and the holy ghost

[2:28:15] justifies you
[2:28:19] it is christ but it is still christ that
[2:28:23] justify you
[2:28:28] so in death
[2:28:30] in sickness in problems in temptation
[2:28:33] and trials we
[2:28:37] are more
[2:28:43] so no matter what the devil will do
[2:28:46] get me that last quote my friend the
[2:28:48] prophet said
[2:28:50] god
[2:28:51] we
[2:28:52] disintegrate
[2:28:56] you got that
[2:28:59] god i'm cutting because time is not so
[2:29:01] i'm cutting my i'm rounding up with oled
[2:29:03] accord
[2:29:04] hallelujah
[2:29:06] we have to run it on
[2:29:12] no
[2:29:13] let me pick it here for my phone
[2:29:18] i want to read
[2:29:24] the message yeah his voice is that right
[2:29:28] the prophet said
[2:29:30] because already when we read the
[2:29:32] scripture said
[2:29:33] fear not
[2:29:34] for it is what your father good
[2:29:37] pleasure to give you
[2:29:39] so now we want to hear what the prophet
[2:29:41] said
[2:29:42] he said yeah the message 1958
[2:29:47] hear his voice
[2:29:49] don't be scared
[2:29:51] to take god at his words
[2:30:00] just what
[2:30:02] real life
[2:30:08] there is no cause
[2:30:10] be still
[2:30:12] and know that i am gone
[2:30:16] just relax
[2:30:20] don't just be troubled about the
[2:30:22] atmosphere
[2:30:24] and the situation that is not your
[2:30:26] business
[2:30:28] and you know when you are doing
[2:30:29] something that is not your business
[2:30:31] whether you do it right or or better you
[2:30:34] are wrong in the first place because it
[2:30:36] will not be accepted for you because you
[2:30:38] are doing what is not your business
[2:30:42] so that did qualify you whether you do
[2:30:44] it right or wrong
[2:30:45] it is not your business you are not
[2:30:47] super you are not called for it so
[2:30:50] you will receive a query rather than a
[2:30:52] good job done
[2:30:56] it is not our business
[2:30:59] how jordan we go away
[2:31:02] it is not our business
[2:31:04] how we can achieve our future
[2:31:07] how we can achieve our goal
[2:31:10] because it is the father of good will
[2:31:14] and the prophet said we came in by
[2:31:17] predestination
[2:31:18] so our destiny
[2:31:20] is predestinated
[2:31:23] and when you are predecimated to
[2:31:25] something it is not your willing it is
[2:31:28] not your ability it is not your making
[2:31:31] it is the one
[2:31:33] who could the good pleasure of the world
[2:31:36] who predestinated you to be obligated to
[2:31:39] his way and carry you through
[2:31:42] therefore he said i will never leave you
[2:31:44] comfortless
[2:31:46] i will never leave you comfortless
[2:31:48] brother i will never leave you
[2:31:50] comfortless i will be with you
[2:31:53] even i am already in you already
[2:31:56] don't think about what you did yesterday
[2:31:58] god said i am already in you
[2:32:02] and i will carry you through
[2:32:04] you will definitely overcome this body
[2:32:06] you will definitely overcome this flesh
[2:32:09] you definitely overcome fears you
[2:32:11] definitely overcome unrighteousness you
[2:32:13] definitely overcome everything that your
[2:32:16] heart is not in love with everything
[2:32:19] that makes you to know that you have
[2:32:22] failed god you have what it takes
[2:32:25] god will give you grace
[2:32:31] as long as something you tell you that
[2:32:33] this thing is not good for you
[2:32:35] no matter how difficult it is god will
[2:32:38] give you grace to jump over
[2:32:41] oh hallelujah
[2:32:43] god
[2:32:45] he said just relax where is it he went
[2:32:48] out
[2:32:50] i have it to my phone so when your
[2:32:51] system is doing
[2:32:53] even with the system go down my phone
[2:32:54] god will still bring it in here
[2:32:56] whether the devil like it or not because
[2:32:58] as concerning us even in the church is a
[2:33:01] failure
[2:33:02] hallelujah
[2:33:05] anything you are in your washroom is a
[2:33:07] failure
[2:33:08] know where you are don't say oh i can
[2:33:10] pray
[2:33:11] anywhere you are you can pray
[2:33:14] [Music]
[2:33:18] and anything you say heavy is on their
[2:33:21] own
[2:33:22] because satan can never prevail
[2:33:25] because there is a prophecy that you
[2:33:27] will never present
[2:33:29] against them that are built upon this
[2:33:31] rock
[2:33:32] this rock of revelation so anywhere be
[2:33:36] not afraid
[2:33:37] just relax
[2:33:39] and be still
[2:33:41] and know that he is the god
[2:33:44] that caused you
[2:33:47] let's read the quote bring it let's
[2:33:49] finish it and we'll close with it

[2:34:04] care
[2:34:08] let me go help us in jesus name
[2:34:10] he always have his best but his best
[2:34:12] cannot hinder us
[2:34:13] because we are working on god's purpose
[2:34:15] and the purpose cannot be defeated
[2:34:17] so we are banned from victory anyhow so
[2:34:20] let's keep on
[2:34:21] hallelujah
[2:34:23] he said
[2:34:27] just relax
[2:34:28] and do what
[2:34:30] have faith
[2:34:33] and believe
[2:34:35] he washes over
[2:34:40] let them read
[2:34:43] let them read my sister
[2:34:45] we are all in the prison together
[2:34:48] hallelujah
[2:34:51] hear his voice
[2:34:53] hallelujah
[2:34:55] praise the lord
[2:34:56] he washes over you
[2:34:59] and now this is the main part
[2:35:02] lana read it himself put it there
[2:35:04] he will
[2:35:06] disintegrate
[2:35:08] anything
[2:35:10] oh oh
[2:35:13] what is the issue now
[2:35:15] just say it anyhow
[2:35:16] the prophet said
[2:35:20] can somebody talk with me i said
[2:35:23] [Music]
[2:35:26] any issue anything any grammar you want
[2:35:28] to use is fine
[2:35:30] but the prophecy he will just
[2:35:32] disintegrate
[2:35:34] anything
[2:35:37] whatsoever
[2:35:39] you got any river you cannot cross
[2:35:42] jordan is uncrossable
[2:35:44] we have a god
[2:35:46] that specializes in things
[2:35:49] that is impossible
[2:35:51] and therefore he said
[2:35:53] no matter the situation
[2:35:55] our god
[2:35:58] pay the price
[2:35:59] by his own blood so he cannot afford
[2:36:03] to leave you on a defeat to bring his
[2:36:06] sacrifice to shame therefore
[2:36:09] in all things
[2:36:11] god have mercy
[2:36:13] and the bible says he is ready
[2:36:16] to disintegrate
[2:36:19] anything

[2:36:41] but it can harm you
[2:36:44] amen
[2:36:45] for all things

[2:36:51] it could be nothing else
[2:36:54] for
[2:36:55] is working together
[2:36:58] for good
[2:36:59] to them that love

[3:05:07] king kingship
[3:05:09] everybody belongs to you you can't favor
[3:05:12] certain people
[3:05:13] it's the royal law
[3:05:15] you have to law you have to love the
[3:05:17] people

[3:05:42] according to the scriptures thou shalt
[3:05:44] love the neighbor as that self ye do
