[46:51] to continue
[46:52] uh on our thought from sunny we were
[46:55] talking about
[46:57] uh in his presence his fullness of joy
[47:00] and what we were trying to do is to to
[47:03] uh look through the word and see how
[47:07] his presence you know as the scripture
[47:10] talks about it
[47:12] and yeri's year is uh uh moses year
[47:16] just like we said he went through the
[47:18] red sea
[47:19] and and uh
[47:22] you know he he called the flies the
[47:25] fleas and darkness
[47:28] and uh and even death in the land
[47:31] and all of those things but yet he came
[47:34] to a place
[47:36] he needed an assurance of his abiding
[47:39] presence
[47:41] he says if you will not go with us then
[47:44] i don't want to take the next step
[47:47] praise the lord i don't want to take the
[47:50] next step
[47:52] and just like we were saying on sunday
[47:58] that's the place where the believer need
[48:00] to come
[48:02] because we have to realize we are not
[48:06] dealing with an idol that we come and
[48:09] worship in church
[48:10] and we leave here and we go home
[48:14] praise the lord amen
[48:19] oh it would be so easy to do amen
[48:22] shut the door cut the light off your
[48:24] eyes you said can i see so when you make
[48:26] it dark it works for him
[48:30] it would just be so easy praise the lord
[48:34] and you see that's the reason why all of
[48:36] those
[48:38] other religions has to come up with
[48:40] rules and
[48:41] regulations and things to discipline
[48:44] uh their people because the god the
[48:47] worship don't go with them
[48:51] amen
[48:55] the only way they can contact the god
[48:57] they worship is when they get in line
[49:00] with their rituals
[49:03] that's the only time they are in contact
[49:05] with the god that they worship
[49:07] out of that they are free their god you
[49:09] know he don't know
[49:10] much about what they are doing until
[49:13] they get to that place but it's not the
[49:14] one that we worship amen
[49:17] praise the lord and uh so uh
[49:21] uh
[49:24] and if if ev ever the time as we get
[49:27] as we get close to the rapture the
[49:31] changing of our body
[49:34] going home and getting away from here
[49:37] it is it is how much conscious
[49:40] we want to be of his presence
[49:46] praise the lord is how much
[49:49] conscious we want to be of his presence
[49:52] you know i was i was meditating on that
[49:55] today
[49:56] and i was just thinking about
[50:01] men that god has called
[50:04] to a higher office look at the lives of
[50:08] the prophets
[50:10] of all the people that god has called
[50:13] to sacred office
[50:17] the life on this earth was not what you
[50:20] would call
[50:24] fun
[50:26] your life on this earth was it was not
[50:28] what you were called fun
[50:31] the men that were going in the presence
[50:33] you know
[50:34] the other day i was i was looking i was
[50:36] listening to
[50:37] uh rebecca smith uh
[50:40] a testimony brother branham's daughter
[50:43] and
[50:43] uh and in in her testimony
[50:47] she showed brother branham office you
[50:50] know
[50:50] brother brown was talking about over
[50:51] robert and uh
[50:54] you know and went to overall office and
[50:57] all of that
[50:57] i wish i could be able to get that
[50:59] picture and show it to you
[51:01] when when i saw it i i just sunk
[51:04] in my stomach it is this small
[51:08] mobile home very small mobile home
[51:12] i just i felt so i it just sunk in my
[51:15] stomach
[51:16] because i mean you hear it on tape you
[51:18] read it
[51:19] in in the message but you don't have a
[51:22] picture
[51:24] of what it was
[51:27] the bed that brother branham was lying
[51:30] on before he went behind the curtain of
[51:32] time was not a king-sized bed
[51:36] it was not a king-sized bed
[51:44] praise the lord
[51:49] and you can see why god will have to
[51:52] make their life
[51:53] that way i was just thinking about that
[51:55] today as i was driving
[51:58] i was just thinking about that i see you
[52:00] look through the scriptures
[52:04] like like even men men like moses moses
[52:07] grew up
[52:08] in pharaoh palace moses knew
[52:11] better life than many of us
[52:16] we had some of us have never even
[52:18] visited the governor house yet
[52:22] moses was in the king palace
[52:29] the king of egypt that's where he grew
[52:32] up
[52:35] he was served as a prince
[52:39] but because he was born for a higher
[52:42] calling
[52:43] god had to strip him
[52:46] of all of that
[52:50] he could never find joy in that
[52:56] and let me let me give you good news
[52:58] tonight the bride of jesus christ
[53:01] she's born for a higher calling
[53:08] she's born for a higher calling
[53:12] glamour is not going to be your
[53:14] prosperity
[53:17] god wants you to prosper in his word
[53:21] prosper in health just as
[53:24] your soul prospered
[53:28] and the only reason why you need good
[53:30] health is to be able to live a good
[53:32] christian life
[53:38] that's the only reason why i think
[53:41] i don't know but it's gotta am i wrong
[53:46] oh praise the lord amen
[53:51] glory be to god
[53:58] that's the only reason why i would think
[54:03] we need good health but yeah you see
[54:06] even some of those men paul
[54:08] he had an eyes problem two minutes he
[54:12] had a stomach problem
[54:19] and even some of those men i was i was
[54:21] that was
[54:22] in this higher calling that had a closer
[54:25] walk with god they had
[54:27] they had i mean they could go in the
[54:30] presence of god
[54:32] man like isaiah get in the presence of
[54:35] god the glory of god came down
[54:38] he i mean he was he was transported
[54:42] he was he was off his feet on earth but
[54:44] yet off his feet
[54:46] in the presence of the angels
[54:51] amen
[55:04] and when it came to the last moment his
[55:06] last movement on this earth
[55:10] they had to saw him asunder
[55:16] they had to saw him asunder cut his body
[55:19] into two paths
[55:23] now i'm not trying to scare you tonight
[55:27] praise the lord amen we have the word of
[55:30] god we don't have to preach
[55:32] you know fearful gospel for god i'm not
[55:36] giving up the spirit of fear
[55:38] amen but i'm trying to call you to
[55:46] consciousness
[55:49] barbarian says whatever you do
[55:53] he says don't miss it
[55:56] because only perfect love for god
[55:59] will enter there amen
[56:03] so uh uh i will talk about about
[56:06] impressions
[56:08] and uh uh and sunday we were saying that
[56:12] uh the presence of god is is is
[56:16] associated with his name and his word
[56:20] because he's an only present god amen
[56:24] is every word we know that
[56:27] and uh but you know it's it's just like
[56:32] you know you you leave the service and
[56:34] you and you start meditating upon the
[56:36] word
[56:37] and sometimes it comes clearer to you
[56:39] even the even the preacher
[56:41] i don't have full authority over this
[56:43] world
[56:45] i'm just only a china and sometimes i
[56:48] preached him
[56:48] i go home and then because before it
[56:50] became it even struck me and i said
[56:52] wow
[56:56] praise the lord and i was thinking about
[56:59] this that god
[57:00] in the old testament would give the
[57:02] people a place
[57:04] where he will meet the worshipers i
[57:07] mentioned that
[57:08] on sunday and he says that's the place
[57:11] where i will put my name
[57:16] that's the only place where he said he
[57:19] will meet the worshipers
[57:21] that was the provided place of worship
[57:26] praise the lord
[57:31] and we we we can even see in the old
[57:34] testament tabernacle
[57:35] how the how the holiest of holiness was
[57:39] preserved in so much
[57:42] that when the priest is going behind
[57:44] there he have to
[57:46] he i mean he has to be dressed right
[57:53] he has to walk right he has to be
[57:57] anointed right
[58:03] because one thing
[58:06] out of other
[58:09] god will not take it you have to
[58:12] remember now
[58:12] when we talk about the sacrifices
[58:16] there is nothing of the flesh god don't
[58:19] take nothing of this flesh
[58:23] amen so in
[58:27] all the preparation of the priests
[58:30] was not the cream he used on the on his
[58:33] body or the spray
[58:34] or the the deodorant he used under his
[58:37] arm no
[58:38] all his preparation was to prepare his
[58:42] spirit
[58:44] to prepare his mind
[58:49] the emphasis was more on his spirit man
[58:52] not glory in that presence of the lord
[58:54] with no anger no
[58:56] vestation he had to make sure
[58:59] when it was time for sacrifice he
[59:02] confessed his sin
[59:03] and the sin of the people
[59:12] praise the lord
[59:19] and what this age want to give god as a
[59:22] as the presence of god
[59:24] is disco light and people come dressed
[59:26] anyhow
[59:27] with chewing gums in their mouth they
[59:29] come with their soda pop and set it down
[59:31] their coffee cup and and it's just
[59:34] all about them and nothing about god
[59:38] that's that's what this is want to give
[59:40] god and that's what we call the presence
[59:42] of god
[59:52] we just show up to keep our church
[59:55] membership
[59:59] but the age in itself is completely
[1:00:02] absent why are they absent
[1:00:07] because they don't have the word
[1:00:11] with other words you are absent from the
[1:00:13] presence of god
[1:00:20] if your desire is not the word if your
[1:00:22] praise is not the word
[1:00:24] if your sacrifice is not the word
[1:00:31] praise the lord amen
[1:00:37] we'll refuel close to you tonight and
[1:00:40] we'll let you go
[1:00:45] but i'm thinking about that
[1:00:48] and just like i said as a church we are
[1:00:51] moving in a direction
[1:00:54] it is not just to get a good salmon to
[1:00:57] make you feel good
[1:01:01] it's to find the man of god is to find
[1:01:03] the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:01:07] because he's the pastor of this church
[1:01:15] you see that we come here and mean
[1:01:17] business with god or we just forget
[1:01:19] about it
[1:01:29] are we together
[1:01:36] even solomon
[1:01:47] we'll find a time and talk on the book
[1:01:49] of ecclesiastes but
[1:01:50] the beautiful thing there is that when
[1:01:52] he started the book
[1:01:54] he first started with the natural life
[1:01:58] of man
[1:01:59] when he came to the end of the book then
[1:02:02] he stopped
[1:02:03] he started going to things that are very
[1:02:06] important
[1:02:09] i thought on that book as i read through
[1:02:12] it and said it through it
[1:02:14] i says i need to preach a semmel out of
[1:02:17] this book
[1:02:18] and i will tie to it the only thing
[1:02:22] worth living for i don't know what kind
[1:02:23] of title i give it
[1:02:26] but uh it's the things that you do for
[1:02:30] god
[1:02:31] that will last
[1:02:34] as he started getting to the end of the
[1:02:37] book
[1:02:38] he said it's better to go to the house
[1:02:40] of mourning than to go to the house of
[1:02:41] feasts
[1:02:43] he says because that is the end of every
[1:02:44] man
[1:02:47] wash your fourth step as you go into the
[1:02:49] house of the lord
[1:02:53] consider your youth
[1:02:59] he started talking about things that
[1:03:02] matters
[1:03:05] well we're not in the book of
[1:03:06] ecclesiastes tonight
[1:03:10] abiding presence brother graham said in
[1:03:12] supernatural he says
[1:03:13] abiding that's one of my scriptures i
[1:03:16] will read tonight
[1:03:18] if ye abide in me
[1:03:21] my word abide in you then
[1:03:24] ask what you will
[1:03:28] it will be given to you amen
[1:03:32] now you can see jesus was not joking
[1:03:38] he made what he said
[1:03:41] but a requirement for you to have what
[1:03:44] you asked for
[1:03:46] the requirement was to abide
[1:03:50] was to abide
[1:03:59] praise the lord
[1:04:02] the requirement to have god
[1:04:05] in your business the requirement to have
[1:04:08] god
[1:04:08] right there to do what you say
[1:04:14] you think about it this is almighty god
[1:04:23] that you're just going to give komento
[1:04:26] or ask him and he sent his angels to do
[1:04:28] it
[1:04:33] praise the lord
[1:04:36] see how serious it is
[1:04:40] i mean a person that don't even know
[1:04:42] what they are doing
[1:04:44] they don't even have a a good grip of
[1:04:46] sense of
[1:04:47] what they want to do with their life
[1:04:55] the church world especially the care
[1:04:57] master church
[1:04:58] is just breeding arrogant people
[1:05:01] people that are arrogant they have no
[1:05:04] respect for the word of god
[1:05:05] nor regard for the presence of god they
[1:05:08] just get arrogant
[1:05:10] the god of the universe is my father
[1:05:12] whenever i ask him he will do it
[1:05:15] whatever he asks you are you doing it
[1:05:25] that abiding presence asks what you will
[1:05:32] we talked about the terrible it never
[1:05:34] took our brother branham to just get
[1:05:36] there by the snap of his finger
[1:05:40] it takes discipline church it takes
[1:05:43] discipline
[1:05:44] we have to be disciplined in every area
[1:05:47] of our life every area of our life
[1:05:51] that's what it takes
[1:06:00] you think about that priest coming from
[1:06:02] the presence of god
[1:06:04] and as soon as he come outside he made
[1:06:06] that sacrifice as
[1:06:07] now he steps outside says oh i thank god
[1:06:10] then go i made it
[1:06:12] oh you just go take out his clothes and
[1:06:14] chunk it down and take her everything
[1:06:17] mary thank god i made it today my
[1:06:19] goodness
[1:06:20] praise the lord oh oh then he's just
[1:06:23] going about
[1:06:24] and and living the careless life waiting
[1:06:26] for the next ceremony
[1:06:28] when he comes out of that place
[1:06:31] the way he takes his clothes the way he
[1:06:34] preserve it
[1:06:36] when he comes out he's preparing to go
[1:06:39] back in
[1:06:41] he lived his life daily thinking about
[1:06:45] glory in the presence of god
[1:06:58] praise the lord
[1:07:01] well tell the minister to church before
[1:07:03] you start looking for your shoes and
[1:07:04] your clothes and
[1:07:06] i don't want to get down that road i
[1:07:09] just want to give you a little bit thing
[1:07:11] to think about
[1:07:12] that's why we get to church late
[1:07:16] as he comes out of the presence of god
[1:07:20] he lived dearly thinking preparing
[1:07:23] himself
[1:07:24] to go back in
[1:07:33] what would it be i mean uh uh 10 minutes
[1:07:36] for him to go by he realized that uh
[1:07:39] uh his little son came and touched his
[1:07:41] robe and oil is on it
[1:07:44] and the people are waiting for him to
[1:07:46] make sacrifice is that the time that you
[1:07:48] will be
[1:07:49] mira will be washing the clothes bring
[1:07:51] the iron let's press it
[1:07:54] john why you have to do this don't you
[1:07:57] know i had to go all in
[1:07:59] no his spirit has to be right
[1:08:05] his spirit has to be right
[1:08:15] even when he's walking to the to the
[1:08:18] tabernacle
[1:08:19] with his family they're not arguing in
[1:08:22] the car because
[1:08:23] argument just turn your spirit up
[1:08:31] wash your foot as you go into the house
[1:08:33] of the lord it's not entering this door
[1:08:36] it's leaving your house the preparation
[1:08:39] you make
[1:08:44] praise lord i don't know who's carrying
[1:08:47] me there it's not part of my notes
[1:08:50] somebody should be the one pulling me in
[1:08:51] this direction
[1:08:53] glory be to god i'm not guilty of there
[1:08:56] because i don't have it in my notes
[1:08:59] let's go ahead abiding if you had
[1:09:01] abiding me my word about in you then ask
[1:09:03] what you will
[1:09:05] it will be giving to you and that was
[1:09:07] one of the things i thought about
[1:09:09] through the week and i hope i can come
[1:09:12] back to data
[1:09:13] and all a long time ago we spoke a
[1:09:16] little bit on that but
[1:09:17] uh i was thinking about their
[1:09:20] discipline
[1:09:23] discipline that's what preeminence is
[1:09:27] all about
[1:09:29] christ having the preeminence in his
[1:09:31] church is all about
[1:09:35] a life of discipline
[1:09:42] you see the failure of the church the
[1:09:45] pentecostal church the medivis the
[1:09:47] baptist
[1:09:48] and all all
[1:09:52] all all means all
[1:09:55] all means all which means it don't even
[1:09:58] stop to the denomination there it comes
[1:10:00] over the message oh
[1:10:06] it's a failure to that abiding grace of
[1:10:11] god
[1:10:14] it's a failure to that abiding grace of
[1:10:18] god
[1:10:22] coming time when god is blessing us with
[1:10:24] our prayer life
[1:10:25] we enjoy it and pretty soon we think
[1:10:28] that we are spiritual
[1:10:29] above everybody and and and now we want
[1:10:32] to regulate it and
[1:10:34] we just abide just above
[1:10:40] the failure is to that abiding grace of
[1:10:42] god tonight
[1:10:44] you will shout clap your hands dance in
[1:10:47] your eyes
[1:10:48] speak in tongues he says that's gift
[1:10:51] gift is no good unless you are
[1:10:55] abiding in the shackana glory
[1:10:58] is not only the preacher that wait on
[1:11:00] the lord the son-servant leader must
[1:11:02] find time to wait on the lord
[1:11:04] the musicians wait on the lord the
[1:11:07] people wait
[1:11:08] on the lord
[1:11:13] that abiding presence that abiding grace
[1:11:20] a time to just say lord
[1:11:23] ye i am
[1:11:31] he says that's the failure gift is no
[1:11:40] good
[1:11:41] unless you are abiding in the chicana
[1:11:44] glory seed
[1:11:45] those things are fine i have nothing to
[1:11:48] say against them
[1:11:49] they are of god shouting and blessing
[1:11:53] god is
[1:11:54] wonderful speaking in tongues or
[1:11:56] translation of tongues and
[1:11:57] and and and all i mean interpretation of
[1:12:00] tongues
[1:12:01] is the same and all these other things
[1:12:05] gifts of healing prophecy you know and
[1:12:08] and the church today just focus on that
[1:12:12] they just focus we want manifestation
[1:12:14] what brings manifestation
[1:12:17] what brings manifestation
[1:12:21] the bible talks about the beast of
[1:12:23] revelation 13 that
[1:12:24] uh he will he will he will he will he
[1:12:28] will perform miracles
[1:12:30] even though brother branham said his
[1:12:32] miracle that he will perform is to be
[1:12:34] able to bring
[1:12:35] all the world religion together
[1:12:39] that would be a miracle that they all
[1:12:42] will agree
[1:12:43] yet they are divided from one another
[1:12:49] that's a miracle that is only the beast
[1:12:51] can do
[1:12:53] he's the only one to have that anointing
[1:12:55] to do it
[1:13:04] all these things gifts of healing
[1:13:06] prophecy all these things
[1:13:07] are marvelous but they are no
[1:13:11] good they are not fruitful
[1:13:14] they are not fruitful if they are not
[1:13:17] fruitful they are what
[1:13:19] prideful
[1:13:23] they are not fruitful they are just
[1:13:24] prideful
[1:13:27] i have the gift of healing i can pray
[1:13:29] for the sake
[1:13:33] they are not fruitful they can yell
[1:13:38] the right unless you are living
[1:13:41] in the presence of the shakana glory
[1:13:45] atmosphere around you is
[1:13:48] galling praise the lord

[1:13:58] no
[1:14:03] if that's the way you understand me
[1:14:04] you're listening to the devil you're not
[1:14:06] listening to me
[1:14:08] that's not what i'm saying
[1:14:18] living in the presence of the shakana
[1:14:20] glory
[1:14:25] we say his word
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:33] and what was the second thing
[1:14:37] sauna we said his word
[1:14:41] in his name
[1:14:44] we sing the song take the name of jesus
[1:14:46] with you
[1:14:48] everywhere you go breathe that holy name
[1:14:51] in prayer
[1:14:52] as long as you are taking the name with
[1:14:53] you you are in his presence
[1:15:03] unless you are living in the shaking
[1:15:04] glory the atmosphere around you is going
[1:15:08] that's the reason that men and women
[1:15:12] are not permitted to these things to
[1:15:15] what things
[1:15:17] gifts that's why they are not permitted
[1:15:20] to
[1:15:20] to the supernatural
[1:15:24] because it takes a life
[1:15:27] to be able to stay in that presence
[1:15:34] that's why men and women are not
[1:15:35] permitted to these things
[1:15:41] because they go out here
[1:15:45] and call a blessing over something
[1:15:48] that god has cursed or cursed something
[1:15:50] that god has blessed
[1:15:55] why because they are not
[1:15:58] disciplined i heard brother branham
[1:16:02] using the word today
[1:16:03] in the message paradox he said he said
[1:16:08] how we need to be schooled
[1:16:11] we need to be schooled we need to be
[1:16:13] taught
[1:16:16] and one of the hardest people to teach
[1:16:18] is the message people
[1:16:21] message people are hard to be taught
[1:16:27] you say one the line of 20 courts
[1:16:40] verbum says that's why we are not
[1:16:41] committed to these things abiding
[1:16:43] presence
[1:16:46] we have to realize with all of these
[1:16:48] things happening
[1:16:50] all of the confusion that is in the
[1:16:52] world and the chaos
[1:16:54] god is calling his bride away
[1:16:58] but branham says there's a secret
[1:17:01] going of the bride she's being called
[1:17:05] away
[1:17:06] into his presence daily
[1:17:11] she's been called away into his presence
[1:17:14] daily
[1:17:17] in his presence is fullness of joy
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:26] he says is an abiding presence to
[1:17:29] know the will of god what a confidence
[1:17:33] it gives you
[1:17:34] and says if god tells me to go in and
[1:17:37] and
[1:17:38] and and raise abraham lincoln up i will
[1:17:41] invite the entire world
[1:17:45] it was an abiding presence jesus right
[1:17:48] there to the grave of lazarus
[1:17:54] he wanted more of the skeptics to come
[1:17:58] he wanted more
[1:18:02] he wanted them all to come all the ones
[1:18:04] that were gossiping
[1:18:05] and talking in the ears of mary and
[1:18:07] martyr and talking inward about him he
[1:18:09] wanted them to come
[1:18:13] praise the lord at times he would come
[1:18:17] and he would just sneak back
[1:18:18] and visit but this time he was he was
[1:18:21] talking in the street
[1:18:23] making his voice loud so everybody can
[1:18:25] hear it
[1:18:26] where did you lead him what what
[1:18:30] what what
[1:18:33] let's go show me where you lay him i'm
[1:18:36] the resurrection and the light
[1:18:42] because it was a vision it was doubt
[1:18:44] said the lord
[1:18:46] it could have never failed that's the
[1:18:49] confidence
[1:18:50] the abiding presence gives you
[1:18:53] it gives you such a faith
[1:18:57] that you know and you know and you know
[1:19:00] and you
[1:19:00] know
[1:19:04] you can say like shadrach meshach and
[1:19:06] abednego
[1:19:07] even if our god don't deliver us
[1:19:12] abiding presence
[1:19:19] it's an abiding presence to know the
[1:19:21] will of god
[1:19:24] then don't look what the word going to
[1:19:26] say about you
[1:19:28] is what god thinks about you
[1:19:32] then you are living in his presence
[1:19:37] let the people think what they want to
[1:19:39] think like the church says what they
[1:19:42] want to say
[1:19:42] i mean it will soon stop putting you in
[1:19:44] three counts of believers there was a
[1:19:46] quick
[1:19:47] message believer i've ever quit with
[1:19:48] that there are three kinds of believer
[1:19:55] but what you want is that inner
[1:19:57] assurance
[1:19:59] the lord is my shepherd
[1:20:02] i shall now one
[1:20:06] that is an abiding presence
[1:20:13] that is an abiding presence
[1:20:19] verb talks here in jehovah jarrah he
[1:20:22] brings lord out here in the picture he
[1:20:24] said there was lord
[1:20:25] walking right along with abraham
[1:20:30] who was a believer but he didn't have
[1:20:34] the constant abiding
[1:20:37] presence means he was in
[1:20:40] and out in and out
[1:20:44] in and out he did not had
[1:20:49] a constant abiding presence
[1:20:52] so what did it do it affected his choice
[1:20:59] because he did not had a constant
[1:21:01] abiding presence
[1:21:03] it affected his choice
[1:21:08] abraham said look left look right choose
[1:21:11] wherever you want to go
[1:21:21] praise the lord
[1:21:25] amen okay i have a few minutes
[1:21:30] he didn't have that constant abiding
[1:21:33] presence of god
[1:21:34] so when the hirst man got to iger and
[1:21:38] abraham said we are veterans let us not
[1:21:40] have
[1:21:40] any more argument he and he said you
[1:21:43] take the east i would
[1:21:44] i would take the west or if you take the
[1:21:47] west i would go
[1:21:48] east which way you go
[1:21:51] i would go vice versa that's the way
[1:21:55] to make decision
[1:21:59] god you do the leading god
[1:22:02] you do the leading now god
[1:22:06] this is what i want to do but god you
[1:22:10] do the leading
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:20] he never had that constant abiding
[1:22:23] presence
[1:22:24] and that's what abraham had the constant
[1:22:27] abiding presence
[1:22:29] now even when he went down to egypt he
[1:22:33] went down to egypt
[1:22:35] yet god came to his defense
[1:22:39] because he had the constant abiding
[1:22:42] presence
[1:22:43] it does not mean that you will not make
[1:22:45] mistakes you will not make
[1:22:46] wrong choices but
[1:22:52] the blessing of that constant abiding
[1:22:54] presence
[1:22:55] is that mercy and grace
[1:23:00] his grace and mercy will follow me all
[1:23:03] the days of my life
[1:23:04] and i shall dwarve in the presence of
[1:23:07] god
[1:23:13] are we together
[1:23:21] in his presence his fullness of joy
[1:23:33] let's take let's take a few more year
[1:23:35] and see
[1:23:36] how the law will help us okay actually
[1:23:40] it's the last one i have on abiding
[1:23:41] presence but
[1:23:42] i've i added i added something on
[1:23:45] on constant so so uh
[1:23:49] uh yeah let's let's just take him let's
[1:23:52] look at this one brother branham says
[1:23:54] and we pray that you
[1:23:57] will all together gather us tonight
[1:24:01] under the wings of his
[1:24:04] abiding presence you see jesus said
[1:24:09] israel jerusalem jerusalem
[1:24:12] how i would have wanted to spray my
[1:24:16] wings
[1:24:18] over you like a hand due to her cheek
[1:24:23] how a desire to draw you into my
[1:24:27] presence
[1:24:29] but what took them away from his
[1:24:31] presence
[1:24:32] it was the religious system of that day
[1:24:35] it was the teachings
[1:24:36] of that day it was the religious
[1:24:40] leaders of that day now just like i said
[1:24:44] the last
[1:24:45] last wednesday i think that thing became
[1:24:48] so strong to me
[1:24:49] because that was the the first time
[1:24:53] that scripture really came to light to
[1:24:55] me
[1:24:57] that jude i mean
[1:25:00] barabas was not just a murderer
[1:25:06] he was not just a murderer he was a
[1:25:09] religious fanatic
[1:25:13] he was just like paul
[1:25:17] that went and talked a letter from the
[1:25:19] sahendra's council
[1:25:21] gave me the bit of right that when i
[1:25:24] asked
[1:25:25] any man to be executed the council would
[1:25:27] stand behind me and speak to rome
[1:25:34] he was not just a vacable and i was just
[1:25:36] joking people with knife in the street
[1:25:41] he was doing it because he thought that
[1:25:43] if i
[1:25:44] killed just just like out of these uh
[1:25:47] islamic finances who do
[1:25:48] po bomb around them and say if i go and
[1:25:52] blast people off god would give me seven
[1:25:54] virgins
[1:26:00] what why is he doing that he's doing
[1:26:03] that with a religious
[1:26:05] concept in his mind
[1:26:08] that's the kind of a person that barbara
[1:26:10] was
[1:26:12] because that even the council even the
[1:26:15] religious
[1:26:16] people of of of of uh the sanhedrin's
[1:26:19] council
[1:26:20] will stand there and say give us
[1:26:22] barabbas
[1:26:28] that is the reason why they always shout
[1:26:30] for barabbas
[1:26:43] we pray that you will gather us together
[1:26:45] tonight honor
[1:26:47] the wings of his abiding presence
[1:26:51] as a hand gather her cheeks may we
[1:26:55] be gathered this night and may the holy
[1:26:58] spirit visit
[1:26:59] us with great power
[1:27:04] amen may we be gathered
[1:27:08] this night and may the holy spirit visit
[1:27:11] us with great power
[1:27:17] and that's what we are laboring
[1:27:21] under we want god
[1:27:25] to gather us in his abiding presence
[1:27:28] that whether we are in church or
[1:27:32] out of church
[1:27:38] we will be so disciplined by the word
[1:27:43] so disciplined
[1:27:47] those are those are the things that when
[1:27:50] the holy spirit achieve
[1:27:52] in in an assembly it makes it
[1:27:56] so sweet to save the lord but it's now
[1:28:00] when people come to church to come with
[1:28:02] their own mind
[1:28:03] it's hard for them to take instruction
[1:28:05] they get angry for every little thing
[1:28:13] i mean when such a discipline comes
[1:28:16] among
[1:28:16] the people it pleases the law so much
[1:28:26] now even if we spend 30 minutes in his
[1:28:29] presence
[1:28:31] or we spend an hour or two hour it will
[1:28:34] make no difference
[1:28:35] some people just think the long service
[1:28:38] means that the anointing was there no
[1:28:42] sometimes this preacher is just
[1:28:44] struggling through atmosphere
[1:28:46] just to be able to get us to that place
[1:28:50] because it took five minutes in the
[1:28:52] presence of god
[1:28:53] for moses to be changed from an angry
[1:28:56] man
[1:28:57] to the most meekest man
[1:29:01] we don't need a two-hour service
[1:29:04] five minutes is enough
[1:29:08] but there's a lot of background work
[1:29:11] needed
[1:29:13] there's a lot of background work needed
[1:29:17] for us to come to that place
[1:29:28] but bram says this it's it's a little
[1:29:31] bit off but
[1:29:33] you you you enjoy the blessings of a
[1:29:36] position in christ he says and he called
[1:29:38] him
[1:29:39] and and and he sent jesus
[1:29:43] that his blood might be
[1:29:46] on atoning blood i to me
[1:29:51] to make a propertation
[1:29:54] or exception or
[1:29:57] a cleansing a cleansing
[1:30:01] process to constantly now that work
[1:30:05] constantly
[1:30:06] uh many years ago i kind of picked this
[1:30:08] up studying
[1:30:09] studying adoption series
[1:30:13] and uh it helped me to see
[1:30:17] why god wrapped adam and eve
[1:30:21] in the bleeding sheepskin
[1:30:28] because as they were walking the blood
[1:30:30] was dropping
[1:30:32] so as they were going they had constant
[1:30:35] atonement
[1:30:36] they were walking in their sacrifice
[1:30:42] because he was driving them away from
[1:30:45] his presence
[1:30:46] but he made a provision for them to
[1:30:49] always be in his presence
[1:30:51] because every step they make blood is
[1:30:53] dropping
[1:30:56] so our constant atonement make a
[1:30:59] provision
[1:31:00] for an abiding presence
[1:31:06] amen what does that mean to the young
[1:31:10] people
[1:31:11] if you made a mistake get on your knees
[1:31:13] ask god for forgiveness
[1:31:18] if you have to apologize to the person
[1:31:19] that you're wrong apologize to them
[1:31:21] because when you walk in that constant
[1:31:24] atonement
[1:31:24] it will put you back in abiding presence
[1:31:29] but if you feel so proud and and
[1:31:32] stubborn to stick in your ways then you
[1:31:35] will go just like king away from the
[1:31:37] presence of god
[1:31:44] are we together
[1:31:48] cleansing process took constantly
[1:31:52] not just one time at one revival
[1:31:56] but living ever
[1:31:59] living everywhere you are
[1:32:03] if you put your eyes on the wrong thing
[1:32:04] oh god forgive me what a sinful world we
[1:32:07] live in god have mercy what what what
[1:32:12] you have done you have pulled on your
[1:32:14] attorney and because you have pulled on
[1:32:17] your atonement
[1:32:18] abiding presence come closer
[1:32:32] not just one time at one revival
[1:32:35] but ever living making intercession
[1:32:39] that the christian is kept clean day
[1:32:43] and night because we have
[1:32:47] a constant attunement
[1:32:54] there is the blood of jesus christ that
[1:32:56] makes
[1:32:57] an exception on the cross there in the
[1:33:00] presence of god
[1:33:03] that cleanses us constantly constantly
[1:33:07] if you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:33:10] light
[1:33:11] the blood of jesus christ claims us
[1:33:15] yes constant to me
[1:33:19] and what is the light the word
[1:33:23] so you see the presence his name
[1:33:26] his blood all of those things are the
[1:33:29] element of his presence
[1:33:34] to be constantly in his presence you
[1:33:36] need a constant atonement
[1:33:42] praise the lord
[1:33:50] are we together tonight
[1:33:58] but abraham says this we read this one
[1:34:00] and we close he says
[1:34:02] by faith you are safe
[1:34:05] that's your faith in god i love this
[1:34:09] i just i just put this one in because
[1:34:11] it's something that i love amen
[1:34:13] and i love to share with you what i love
[1:34:16] praise the lord i hope you love it the
[1:34:18] same
[1:34:19] he says by faith you are saved that's
[1:34:23] your faith
[1:34:23] in god the blood keeps you
[1:34:27] clean from sin
[1:34:30] your faith saves you
[1:34:34] the blood keeps you clean
[1:34:37] not the chemical blood but the bleeding
[1:34:40] world
[1:34:44] amen we are watched by the watching
[1:34:48] of the word of god your faith
[1:34:52] saves you
[1:34:56] but the blood keeps you clean
[1:35:02] because it makes a sacrifice the blood
[1:35:06] doesn't save you
[1:35:08] i plead the blood of jesus i plead the
[1:35:11] blood of jesus it doesn't save you
[1:35:16] what saves you is your faith in god
[1:35:27] the blood doesn't save you the blood
[1:35:29] keeps you clean
[1:35:35] by faith you are safe and that's what
[1:35:39] god's full knowledge
[1:35:43] calling you you are safe
[1:35:47] by faith and the blood makes an
[1:35:50] atonement
[1:35:52] constantly keeping you clean
[1:36:02] that's why the christian reads their
[1:36:04] bible
[1:36:06] and pray every day
[1:36:12] praise the lord amen
[1:36:15] and pray every day
[1:36:19] just just just just
[1:36:22] imagine it like this if we were asked
[1:36:26] to use the literal blood and put it over
[1:36:29] our head
[1:36:30] this thing is not close i'm wasting
[1:36:32] water on my head that's fine
[1:36:36] and and and pull it over our head we
[1:36:39] will not get there every morning and try
[1:36:41] to
[1:36:42] understand oh let me understand this no
[1:36:46] sometimes that's where our struggle is
[1:36:48] just read the word
[1:36:50] read the word of god because you love
[1:36:51] the word of god
[1:36:56] yes because the devil comes in and makes
[1:36:59] you frustrated you're not even
[1:37:01] understanding what you're reading
[1:37:04] then you get bored
[1:37:08] because he want to take you away from
[1:37:10] your atomi
[1:37:14] just read the word of god because you
[1:37:16] love it
[1:37:29] and then by one spirit you are baptized
[1:37:32] into the holy ghost into the fellowship
[1:37:35] of the believers
[1:37:36] into the fellowship of the holy spirit
[1:37:39] to be led by the spirit
[1:37:41] doing signs and wonders so your faith
[1:37:44] your faith
[1:37:44] saves you the blood keeps you clean
[1:37:49] amen and by one spirit
[1:37:52] we all are one body
[1:37:57] praise the lord
