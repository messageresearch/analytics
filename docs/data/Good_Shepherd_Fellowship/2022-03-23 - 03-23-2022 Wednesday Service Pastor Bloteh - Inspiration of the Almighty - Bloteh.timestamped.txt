[50:17] upon him
[50:19] and went out
[50:20] the lord bless you you may have your
[50:22] seed as we continue to read
[50:24] but i'm thinking here that she told her
[50:26] husband
[50:28] but because it don't looks like she told
[50:30] her husband
[50:32] amen
[50:33] let's just get into the drama of this
[50:36] uh
[50:37] chapter it don't appear like you would
[50:40] soon see that it don't appear like she
[50:42] told her husband
[50:43] they bought shots on her knees and died
[50:47] almost like he fall asleep
[50:50] praise the lord
[50:52] and she knew because he was not
[50:54] breathing
[50:56] but she took him
[51:00] in the kind and quietness
[51:04] into the prophet's room
[51:06] lay the boy on
[51:09] the bed of the prophet
[51:11] took the key
[51:13] to make sure that nobody go in there
[51:16] and lock the door
[51:18] praise the lord
[51:22] shut the door and went out she called
[51:24] unto her husband
[51:26] and said send me i pray dee
[51:29] she called to her husband and says our
[51:31] son has died
[51:33] no
[51:34] she called to her husband and she said
[51:38] send me i pray thee one of the young men
[51:41] and one of the isis that i may run to
[51:44] the man of god
[51:45] and come again
[51:49] and he said
[51:50] wherefore will thy go unto him so he did
[51:53] not even knew
[51:56] that his son has died
[52:01] now my question
[52:03] this was before the holy ghost
[52:08] and this woman was not even a jewish
[52:10] woman
[52:12] she was a gentile woman
[52:14] praise the lord
[52:16] this was before what what was it that
[52:19] gave her such a compulsion
[52:25] what was it
[52:30] inspiration
[52:35] praise the lord
[52:38] inspiration
[52:49] when peter said lord
[52:52] if it is you be me come
[52:56] he was he was inspired
[53:00] to go and meet the lord he never thought
[53:03] he did not reason in his mind
[53:06] that oh our lord is walking on water
[53:10] no
[53:11] he said lord if it is you build me come
[53:14] when he got out of the inspiration then
[53:16] he started to sink
[53:30] and he said wherefore will that go to
[53:31] him today
[53:33] it is neither new moon non-saber
[53:36] and she said
[53:40] it shall be well
[53:44] praise the lord
[53:47] you mean that this man has lived all of
[53:52] his life or much of his life with this
[53:54] woman
[53:57] and he he can tell
[53:59] that she's in
[54:02] a moon in in in a ceremony you mean that
[54:05] he can tell
[54:08] sure praise the lord
[54:11] certainly he knew that she want to go
[54:13] and see the prophet for something
[54:18] but this is the matter of life and death
[54:24] this is the my the model of losing her
[54:27] only
[54:29] beloved son
[54:34] the only
[54:36] child that she
[54:39] have ever had
[54:42] praise the lord

[55:41] the covenant coming back he draw he
[55:44] throw his priestly robe down
[55:46] and and and i mean he just he just got
[55:49] down to worshiping they never he never

[1:01:32] the situation that should make you
[1:01:34] better
[1:01:36] and make you all filled with complex
[1:01:41] it takes it away
[1:01:43] it's beautiful when we look at this
[1:01:45] together tonight and trust that the lord
[1:01:47] will
[1:01:48] will will will minister to us let's
[1:01:51] continue to read
[1:01:56] and she answered it's all well
[1:01:59] and when she came to the man of god now
[1:02:02] she answered geiser
[1:02:04] when she came to the man of god to the
[1:02:06] hill
[1:02:08] she caught him by the feet
[1:02:11] praise the lord
[1:02:16] and gaza came now to trust her away and
[1:02:20] the man of god said let her alone
[1:02:24] for her soul is vexed
[1:02:28] within her and lord have hated from me
[1:02:33] and have not told me
[1:02:37] then she said did i desire a son of my
[1:02:41] lord
[1:02:42] then i did not i say
[1:02:45] do not deceive me
[1:02:49] then he said to get his
[1:02:52] get of the lands and take my staff
[1:02:55] now when she said that
[1:02:57] she have not said anything yet as the
[1:03:01] boy being dead
[1:03:04] but elijah elijah could pick up
[1:03:10] by her supplication
[1:03:12] that something has
[1:03:14] happened
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:17] so she he he takes his staff and and
[1:03:20] says you know go
[1:03:23] gold and he called uh uh geheza
[1:03:28] oh i'm reading some words now
[1:03:31] and he said yes get up their lungs take
[1:03:33] my staff in the hand and go that way
[1:03:37] if thou meet any man
[1:03:40] salute him not
[1:03:42] and if any saluting
[1:03:44] answer him not again
[1:03:48] do you see a parlor
[1:03:51] of the same behavior of the woman
[1:03:56] praise the lord she didn't even get into
[1:03:59] conversation
[1:04:00] so it shows a sense of urgency
[1:04:05] amen
[1:04:07] a man that is burdened with the lord
[1:04:10] don't have time to argue with people
[1:04:13] and satisfy people's opinion this is
[1:04:16] what i think what you think about this
[1:04:18] and and and you know no
[1:04:20] only gimmicks do that brother and say
[1:04:23] gimmicks are the people that have
[1:04:25] answers to every question
[1:04:27] sure a man that is on the mission for
[1:04:29] god he's burdened with what god tells
[1:04:32] him to do
[1:04:33] and he goes and do it
[1:04:38] are we together
[1:04:46] lay my staff upon the face of the child
[1:04:50] and the mother of the child said
[1:04:53] as long as the lord liveth
[1:04:57] and as thy soul
[1:05:00] liveth
[1:05:01] i will not leave thee
[1:05:04] praise the lord
[1:05:05] but branham said on that verse he says
[1:05:08] the woman of faith was not in the staff
[1:05:11] the woman of faith was in the prophet
[1:05:15] praise the lord
[1:05:17] so she never got emotion and says well i
[1:05:20] will follow you uh uh i guess let's go i
[1:05:22] will direct you nope
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:25] she was certain she knew what she wanted
[1:05:29] her faith was in the in in the in in the
[1:05:31] prophet
[1:05:33] her faith
[1:05:34] and look at the expression here
[1:05:37] as the lord
[1:05:39] god live it as the lord your god
[1:05:42] live it
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] and as your soul
[1:05:48] live it living
[1:05:50] now it shows that the confidence that
[1:05:54] that was the reason why
[1:05:56] the woman never had an attitude that was
[1:05:59] the reason why she was not disrespectful
[1:06:02] because it shows that she has come to a
[1:06:06] level of confidence
[1:06:10] she she have come to a level of
[1:06:12] confidence where she can overlook the
[1:06:16] the man's mistake
[1:06:18] because she knows
[1:06:24] that in his soul he's genuine
[1:06:30] and that's the place where the church
[1:06:32] has failed
[1:06:35] praise the lord
[1:06:37] let's let god start to use a man we
[1:06:40] deify him
[1:06:43] and when he makes a mistake we demonize
[1:06:46] him
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:50] oh we deify him that brother his
[1:06:52] ministry is special who made that you
[1:06:54] know we we just set him like that it's
[1:06:56] all in the mind
[1:07:04] and as soon as he makes a mistake we
[1:07:06] turn around 360.
[1:07:12] and we make him a demon he bound to hell
[1:07:14] he is
[1:07:16] and we just say all sorts of things from
[1:07:18] our mouth
[1:07:20] who even know the kind of a life he's
[1:07:21] living
[1:07:28] but it shows that the confidence of this
[1:07:30] woman
[1:07:32] and i believe that's the reason why it
[1:07:35] pleased almighty god to put this in the
[1:07:37] text of the bible
[1:07:39] yes not just to give us a story for us
[1:07:41] to amuse ourselves but it shows that the
[1:07:44] confidence that this woman had
[1:07:48] was not in the ability of the prophet
[1:07:50] was not in the way he looks
[1:07:52] not in the way he dress
[1:07:55] her confidence
[1:07:57] was in
[1:07:58] his sword
[1:08:01] to know that from the inside he's
[1:08:04] genuine
[1:08:06] and genuine people from the inside makes
[1:08:08] mistake on the outside
[1:08:18] praise the lord
[1:08:27] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:08:28] says you have to pray
[1:08:30] before you choose a pastor
[1:08:34] you know why you have to pray
[1:08:36] because you are dealing with a man that
[1:08:38] is born insane
[1:08:39] right
[1:08:41] a man that has all sorts of mistakes
[1:08:44] praise the lord this is not part of my
[1:08:46] notes i don't know why i'm going this
[1:08:48] way but it's okay
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:52] you know uh
[1:08:56] the reason why you have to pray because
[1:08:59] there has to be something
[1:09:01] that uncles you
[1:09:04] it's the same thing as a man looking for
[1:09:06] the wife you have to pray
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:10] because uh uh i mean uh
[1:09:13] you know you can have more than one wife
[1:09:16] you only have to choose one
[1:09:18] and just like a woman you are praying
[1:09:21] for the husband you are you have to pray
[1:09:23] that's why you have to take it serious
[1:09:29] you have to know that
[1:09:31] it's life and death for you it's not fun
[1:09:38] to just leave it in haircut the way he
[1:09:40] talked to me and all of those things
[1:09:44] that life and death
[1:09:51] it can even either start your heaven
[1:09:53] here or your health begins
[1:10:00] there have to be something
[1:10:03] that anchors you
[1:10:07] something that you have seen and you say
[1:10:10] i've
[1:10:11] i've
[1:10:13] i trust this man
[1:10:18] praise the lord
[1:10:21] amen
[1:10:24] and as soon as you come to that place to
[1:10:26] say i trust this man then now the tests
[1:10:29] begin
[1:10:31] then now the tests begin
[1:10:34] and the different things start happening
[1:10:39] praise the lord but we're talking about
[1:10:41] inspiration i'm just i'm just trying to
[1:10:44] show you when inspiration takes over
[1:10:48] now you you realize
[1:10:50] that it's when the word
[1:10:52] possesses
[1:10:53] possesses a person
[1:10:56] praise the lord amen
[1:10:58] the bible says
[1:11:00] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:11:05] the word that is
[1:11:08] prophesied in the bible
[1:11:11] we capture your body
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:17] you taking your flight it will be the
[1:11:19] world that will capture your body
[1:11:22] enoch
[1:11:23] you know
[1:11:24] kept
[1:11:25] meditating on the word that god
[1:11:27] you know the word became so real to him
[1:11:30] until it captured it lift him off of the
[1:11:32] earth
[1:11:36] that's how the rapture that's the reason
[1:11:38] why the rapture is not by chance
[1:11:41] the rapture is a process it's a group of
[1:11:43] people that are engaging in the word you
[1:11:46] know they are loving the word they are
[1:11:48] meditating they are moving in the word

[1:11:57] are you going to be raptured it's not by
[1:11:59] chance

[1:12:12] you are in fellowship you are in
[1:12:14] connection with this word you are
[1:12:16] thinking about the word it's on your
[1:12:18] mind it's part of your life you ask the
[1:12:22] word shall i do it or should i not do it

[1:12:44] they are not ready for the rapture yet
[1:12:47] they are just afraid to go to hell they
[1:12:50] really don't want to go in the rapture
[1:12:52] they are afraid of going to hell
[1:12:55] but yet they want to be lucky
[1:12:59] to be cut away

[1:15:34] i said glory be to god
[1:15:37] praise the lord you know job was the one
[1:15:40] that said his wife turned away from his
[1:15:42] birth you know and and and you know he
[1:15:45] was he was all so up and and and never
[1:15:49] even had the strength to brush his mouth
[1:15:52] and now she's you know the
[1:15:54] the man that she loved and slept by the
[1:15:56] nanny she can't even stand the breath
[1:15:58] from his mouth
[1:15:59] but i'm here to tell you tonight that
[1:16:01] god don't have no bad breath
[1:16:04] there is no bad birth from almighty god
[1:16:08] praise the lord
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:11] god don't have no bad breath
[1:16:14] praise the lord
[1:16:20] are we together tonight
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:24] so
[1:16:26] the reason why this is important the
[1:16:29] reason why this is important that we
[1:16:32] have to realize
[1:16:33] is that just like i said as we as we get
[1:16:37] as we get close to the rapture which of
[1:16:39] course we are getting close to the
[1:16:41] rapture we are we are in the sequence of
[1:16:43] the rapture with everything that is
[1:16:45] happening around us the opening of the
[1:16:47] word and all of that
[1:16:50] the people of god
[1:16:52] the the bride of jesus christ
[1:16:55] is going to take on
[1:16:57] uh
[1:16:58] a similar characteristics like this
[1:17:02] woman
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:05] she's going to be like paul said sons of
[1:17:08] god are led by the spirit of god
[1:17:10] she's going to move slowly into the
[1:17:13] realm of inspiration
[1:17:16] you see but inspiration is not what we
[1:17:19] made up
[1:17:22] praise the lord it's not why we met up
[1:17:25] well you know i was sitting there and
[1:17:26] something just came over me i don't know
[1:17:28] why i did it
[1:17:32] something just came over me and i just
[1:17:34] did it
[1:17:35] that's not inspiration
[1:17:38] praise the lord
[1:17:40] that's not inspiration
[1:17:44] inspiration
[1:17:47] is by the word of god
[1:17:51] inspiration foundation
[1:17:54] is the word of god
[1:17:55] if there is nothing in the world that
[1:17:58] says that it's not inspiration
[1:18:01] you might have been inspired by the
[1:18:03] wrong spirit
[1:18:05] sure
[1:18:06] praise the lord
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:10] and and and and and what i want to say
[1:18:13] and as i talk about this
[1:18:15] is it's very important
[1:18:19] it's very important
[1:18:21] the reason why it's important is because
[1:18:24] as we come to church tonight
[1:18:27] and you sit in the pills
[1:18:30] and i come and preach to you tonight
[1:18:33] or anybody that comes behind this puppet
[1:18:35] to preach
[1:18:37] now
[1:18:38] if if my vessel
[1:18:41] is not
[1:18:42] consecrated and devoted to to be able to
[1:18:45] preach to you tonight i can say a lot of
[1:18:48] things
[1:18:50] to convince you that this message is
[1:18:52] true you hear what brother cop said on
[1:18:54] on on sunday but
[1:18:56] brother brown and abraham lincoln you
[1:18:58] got to believe that i can say all of
[1:19:00] those things your soul will not feed on
[1:19:03] it
[1:19:09] you see so that is it's not games
[1:19:12] that we are playing
[1:19:16] that's what the prophet of god says no
[1:19:17] man must come behind the sacred this
[1:19:20] until he has spent time with god
[1:19:30] it's not just so i've come and put some
[1:19:32] few cults together and just no
[1:19:35] this is the channel
[1:19:39] where god breathed upon the people
[1:19:46] praise the lord
[1:19:56] i was i was just thinking about that
[1:19:58] uh
[1:19:59] you know i was thinking about that in
[1:20:01] and i was saying oh my god
[1:20:04] oh my god
[1:20:06] you realize why why peter and those
[1:20:10] apostles say she says sir
[1:20:12] uh you know you people find men that can
[1:20:15] be able to take care of your affairs
[1:20:17] let's give ourselves to the world
[1:20:20] and to prayers
[1:20:26] praise the lord
[1:20:27] because the ministry is not just a place
[1:20:30] of
[1:20:30] privilege right
[1:20:33] no it's not a place of privilege
[1:20:40] and every and everything in anything
[1:20:42] that we do for god
[1:20:44] is not just a place of privilege
[1:20:57] praise the lord
[1:21:09] it's hard to to understand how to put
[1:21:12] into words
[1:21:21] i'm just i'm just cut into the shimmy
[1:21:23] knife story there so well so we're
[1:21:25] talking about the inspiration of the
[1:21:28] almighty
[1:21:29] you know let's let's read this quote
[1:21:31] from the message pride
[1:21:33] uh
[1:21:34] that might be the only quote i'll refer
[1:21:35] back to some of the quotes i've i've
[1:21:38] read during this series
[1:21:41] but i'm hoping that i can be able to
[1:21:44] to
[1:21:46] to wrap this up
[1:21:48] pray for me i'll be away this weekend
[1:21:51] and
[1:21:53] be helping
[1:21:54] uh group somewhere
[1:21:58] so just just keep meaning pray
[1:22:00] be back on sunday by the grace of god
[1:22:04] and uh uh
[1:22:08] brett bram says here just listen to that
[1:22:11] he says how the bible
[1:22:13] means so much more
[1:22:18] than it speaks
[1:22:21] how it means
[1:22:22] so much more
[1:22:25] can you imagine just the few
[1:22:27] verses that we have just read
[1:22:32] the picture that we have taken from indy
[1:22:38] another person with with fancy english
[1:22:40] and can can pick up those few verses and
[1:22:43] just read it like a newspaper
[1:22:49] how the bible means so much more than it
[1:22:52] speaks
[1:22:56] if we can only have the holy spirit to
[1:23:00] interpret it for us
[1:23:02] we only read it
[1:23:05] as we look down upon it
[1:23:08] that's what we can do as humans
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:12] with our human ability
[1:23:15] praise the lord we can only look down on
[1:23:17] it and read it
[1:23:19] we try to read it
[1:23:22] mispronounce the words
[1:23:24] that's all that's all human can do
[1:23:27] right
[1:23:29] praise the lord
[1:23:31] but oh how the holy spirit says
[1:23:35] when you pick up the bible
[1:23:38] and open it oh i love this quote
[1:23:42] and you and you are reading it
[1:23:49] and take the
[1:23:50] 10 loaves
[1:23:52] and you are reading it he says
[1:23:56] you can only read it as a human king
[1:23:59] but but
[1:24:00] if you can listen
[1:24:04] he says and who oh how the holy spirit
[1:24:07] says
[1:24:09] child of mine
[1:24:12] you are looking
[1:24:14] into my face
[1:24:23] as you are reading the bible
[1:24:30] sounds of solomon chapter two
[1:24:33] i am
[1:24:35] the rose of sharon
[1:24:38] and the lady of the valley
[1:24:41] as the
[1:24:42] lady tones
[1:24:45] so
[1:24:47] it's my beloved
[1:24:50] among the daughters
[1:24:54] principles
[1:24:59] this is all how the holy spirit says
[1:25:03] child of mine
[1:25:05] you are looking
[1:25:07] into my face
[1:25:12] you are looking into my face now
[1:25:15] when you look into the bible
[1:25:22] praise the lord
[1:25:24] you are looking into my face
[1:25:31] do you see why sometimes
[1:25:34] when you are reading the bible
[1:25:38] and you have a little inspiration
[1:25:42] that brings an understanding to you
[1:25:45] you get stuck
[1:25:47] and you look at it again
[1:25:52] because you are not looking at words
[1:25:55] you are looking
[1:25:59] at his face
[1:26:04] oh child of mine
[1:26:06] you are looking
[1:26:08] into my face
[1:26:15] praise the lord
[1:26:17] oh how we how
[1:26:20] we wish that we knew this all alone
[1:26:26] we would take the habit to look in his
[1:26:28] face
[1:26:30] every morning
[1:26:32] praise the lord
[1:26:34] and look at his face
[1:26:37] praise the lord
[1:26:41] say that's that's what happened when the
[1:26:42] person just got saved and and and and
[1:26:45] the love of god becomes so real to them
[1:26:48] and you know they read the bible the
[1:26:50] kiss
[1:26:59] they all didn't like the only ordinary
[1:27:01] mind just look at that person that it's
[1:27:03] a fanatic
[1:27:05] that's sacrilegious
[1:27:07] what are you reading that paper
[1:27:13] it don't make sense to you
[1:27:16] but when inspiration
[1:27:18] make you to realize
[1:27:21] that you are looking into his face
[1:27:36] children young people
[1:27:40] if we only kneel
[1:27:44] if we only knew
[1:27:48] that
[1:27:50] it is just
[1:27:51] 10
[1:27:53] of the reality of what takes place in
[1:27:56] service that you grab
[1:28:03] ten percent
[1:28:10] praise the lord
[1:28:17] have you ever
[1:28:19] come to church
[1:28:20] being in service the word of god
[1:28:22] preached and you go back home again and
[1:28:23] say let me play that service
[1:28:27] and then when you play the service you
[1:28:29] ask you it looks like was i really in
[1:28:31] that service
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:35] was i did
[1:28:37] my goodness
[1:28:40] where was i when that happened
[1:28:43] why i missed a lot of things when i was
[1:28:45] in church
[1:28:50] i challenge you play it again
[1:28:54] then you ask yourself oh my goodness
[1:28:57] even just before the service end the
[1:28:58] anointing that came down
[1:29:00] but you were here
[1:29:07] praise the lord but you know what we do
[1:29:09] we go back and we play the service and
[1:29:10] we are looking around he says see how
[1:29:13] josh was sitting there in our church
[1:29:19] oh it sounds funny you only lie because
[1:29:22] you feel guilty
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:29] look at the services
[1:29:31] see how he's sitting down
[1:29:38] see the other one moving his hair like
[1:29:40] that just chicken you say
[1:29:41] that just all we look at
[1:29:51] only 10 person
[1:29:53] sometimes we get less than 10 percent
[1:29:57] especially when you come to church to
[1:29:59] sleep
[1:30:03] sleeping in church party just negative
[1:30:05] zero
[1:30:17] praise the lord
[1:30:19] it was better you just stay home stay to
[1:30:22] your house
[1:30:24] enjoy the comfort of your bed
[1:30:31] praise the lord
[1:30:32] because you know what happened it sounds
[1:30:34] funny to you but what happened is that
[1:30:38] when a person is in is in that kind of a
[1:30:40] state and the word being preached the
[1:30:43] devil tried to look for the most
[1:30:45] vulnerable person
[1:30:47] as he retreats
[1:30:49] and people are celebrating amen thank
[1:30:52] you jesus he retreats and look for the
[1:30:55] most
[1:30:56] vulnerable person the person that put
[1:30:58] themselves in a critical state
[1:31:01] they're not a get more thing to
[1:31:02] criticize
[1:31:03] because all thy evil spirits start
[1:31:06] creeping in your corner
[1:31:09] the person that wants to sleep then you
[1:31:11] feel more sleepy
[1:31:14] because all that evil spirit is just
[1:31:17] getting right in your corner
[1:31:31] praise the lord
[1:31:37] so it's a
[1:31:39] church
[1:31:45] there are a lot of things that take
[1:31:47] place
[1:31:48] people get healed and god comes in a
[1:31:51] supernatural way they break people from
[1:31:53] hobbits
[1:31:54] and
[1:31:55] and we don't see those things with our
[1:31:57] eyes
[1:31:58] we don't see it
[1:32:00] the way each individual receive the word
[1:32:02] and the different things that happen
[1:32:05] while the preacher is preaching
[1:32:08] talking and he can just say one thing
[1:32:12] and this person in mind just pick up
[1:32:14] something else and and god is dealing
[1:32:16] with them on it and that other person
[1:32:17] picks something and god is dealing with
[1:32:19] them on it and
[1:32:20] and you don't even know how god is
[1:32:22] dealing with the other person
[1:32:25] you can't even fathom how god is dealing
[1:32:28] with you how much will you know about
[1:32:30] the other person
[1:32:39] do you see how
[1:32:40] we ought to be serious
[1:32:45] now brother braham says we come to
[1:32:46] church we have to pray we have to be
[1:32:48] prayed up
[1:32:57] now using the church
[1:32:58] quiet time to start cleaning your nails
[1:33:00] and and and all all of that
[1:33:03] looking at your nails looking at your
[1:33:05] fingers what were you doing home
[1:33:19] but we're talking about the inspiration
[1:33:20] of the almighty tonight let me just take
[1:33:23] time and get and go into this
[1:33:26] yeah because as i was as i was thinking
[1:33:28] about this you see how the that shimina
[1:33:31] woman
[1:33:32] the confidence that she had like i said
[1:33:34] was was in was in the prophet it was in
[1:33:38] the
[1:33:38] the
[1:33:40] the quality of of his spirit
[1:33:43] the quality of what she knows that that
[1:33:46] man possessed
[1:33:48] as the lord live it it's actually as the
[1:33:51] lord your god
[1:33:53] leave it that's what she said
[1:33:56] as the lord your god
[1:33:59] liveth
[1:34:02] and as your soul believe it
[1:34:06] she's saying i know your god liveth in
[1:34:09] you
[1:34:15] the god that you talk about he's living
[1:34:18] in you you see that that was the reason
[1:34:20] why she had such
[1:34:25] such a character because she knows she
[1:34:26] was not dealing with a man and men don't
[1:34:29] give life
[1:34:30] amen can i give time
[1:34:34] praise the lord
[1:34:37] a man can give child
[1:34:39] a man that tells you that
[1:34:41] by this time
[1:34:43] i call in tol
[1:34:45] the time of life you will be carrying a
[1:34:47] child
[1:34:48] she knew that it was god almighty god
[1:34:52] that was dwelling in that man
[1:34:55] so when she says that
[1:34:57] ask the lord your god
[1:35:00] liveth
[1:35:03] and he's living in you
[1:35:06] i'm not going to leave you
[1:35:10] i don't want a staff
[1:35:13] i want a living god
[1:35:16] i want a god with skin on
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:24] that was the kind of confidence
[1:35:26] that she had
[1:35:29] in the prophet
[1:35:32] praise the lord
[1:35:37] she has such a confident that she was
[1:35:40] not going to make noise about it because
[1:35:42] she knows that when the critics takes it
[1:35:45] they will blow it
[1:35:48] i told you that that matter was just
[1:35:50] fake he just wanted to come in your
[1:35:51] house and you know what she never wanted
[1:35:54] people saying things
[1:35:59] you have to realize that she was the one
[1:36:02] that convinced her husband
[1:36:05] she had a conviction
[1:36:07] for them to build him a room
[1:36:10] so she even never wanted her husband to
[1:36:13] speak ill
[1:36:15] of the prophet
[1:36:19] because she knew
[1:36:20] that almighty god
[1:36:22] was living in that man
[1:36:30] she knew that almighty god
[1:36:32] was living in that man
[1:36:35] praise the
[1:36:37] she don't want her husband to say
[1:36:40] anything ill
[1:36:42] i'm going to see the man of god uh
[1:36:44] hunting is not the new moon yet it's not
[1:36:46] sabbah what's going on
[1:36:49] it would be well
[1:36:56] how we have to have such a character
[1:36:59] when people start to say oh thing you
[1:37:01] can grab any media and say no don't say
[1:37:03] that
[1:37:03] don't say that
[1:37:07] not to stop blowing the film yeah i
[1:37:09] might say i was thinking on that very
[1:37:10] same thing i i just been watching i i've
[1:37:13] just i've been observing
[1:37:17] all the politics and all the things i
[1:37:19] just been was there
[1:37:21] blow blood and talk and talk and talk
[1:37:23] and talk
[1:37:26] you know what brother braham says when
[1:37:27] you take that kind of attitude
[1:37:30] you put
[1:37:32] the holy ghost
[1:37:33] into a corner in your home
[1:37:39] because you are talking
[1:37:43] about a child of god
[1:37:45] you are talking about a seven of god
[1:37:48] you're talking about a daughter of god
[1:37:50] someone that god is working in their
[1:38:00] life it shows the amount of confidence
[1:38:04] that she had
[1:38:07] she did not want her husband saying
[1:38:09] anything she didn't want her workers
[1:38:13] even the man that was driving her
[1:38:18] never had no conversation
[1:38:20] he never even knew where he was going
[1:38:23] get on the road let's go don't stop
[1:38:25] until i say stop that was only her
[1:38:27] conversation
[1:38:28] right
[1:38:31] and he was just going
[1:38:37] since of god that was before the holy
[1:38:40] ghost
[1:38:42] that was before the holy ghost
[1:38:46] she was not even under the coveted yet
[1:38:56] but she could identify god in a man
[1:39:01] and have such a respect
[1:39:07] many of us we only know brother branham
[1:39:10] by what they say brother branham
[1:39:13] we only know him by what we hear on the
[1:39:14] tapes
[1:39:16] and what we read in the box
[1:39:19] you never met the man
[1:39:24] you never sat in his presence
[1:39:29] praise the lord
[1:39:35] why would people choose to believe what
[1:39:37] is on on the internet
[1:39:42] if it is not the devil
[1:39:46] why would make people to choose to
[1:39:48] believe

[1:40:26] you're just calling it
[1:40:29] you know and talking
[1:40:30] says yeah i got your number then uh uh
[1:40:33] and you know i was looking at some video
[1:40:36] on the internet uh oh my goodness uh
[1:40:38] what a man i mean what a testimony and
[1:40:41] this is not somebody that's in the
[1:40:42] message but this is somebody that has
[1:40:43] been around pentecost
[1:40:45] and are just looking at you know when
[1:40:47] and just you know go from one thing to
[1:40:49] another and so you start asking me
[1:40:51] different questions
[1:40:52] and all of that
[1:40:53] now in my mind after a while we talked
[1:40:56] we had a nice conversation talk about
[1:40:58] different things you know he talked
[1:41:00] about different revival as a alain and
[1:41:02] different people over rival and all of
[1:41:04] that
[1:41:05] and uh then you you realize that a
[1:41:08] person like that has been around the
[1:41:10] movement the pentecostal movement
[1:41:13] because he just he just appreciated the
[1:41:15] testimony and uh just to be able to
[1:41:18] watch a
[1:41:20] 20th century prophet and all of that
[1:41:23] in my mind i'm saying to myself
[1:41:27] with all
[1:41:28] there is just only
[1:41:32] two possible videos of brother branham
[1:41:34] ceremony other ones are images that are
[1:41:36] put together you know of him traveling
[1:41:38] and all of that and you know with his
[1:41:40] family and different things and all of
[1:41:42] that
[1:41:43] and uh
[1:41:44] uh
[1:41:46] there and and there are more things that
[1:41:48] are placed i mean uh things lies in and
[1:41:51] you know all sorts of things that people
[1:41:53] put up there you know uh
[1:41:55] broad brand i'm thinking to myself
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:03] you have just
[1:42:04] read about this man and talk maybe
[1:42:06] making research and looking at youtube
[1:42:08] about different people and then you you
[1:42:11] learn about william branham and
[1:42:12] in
[1:42:14] i mean
[1:42:15] what is it that never drove him to start
[1:42:18] looking at all of the negative things
[1:42:21] that he said about this man
[1:42:26] praise the lord
[1:42:34] and we just talk and we plan to meet
[1:42:36] some time in in fellowship and all of
[1:42:39] that
[1:42:40] and now just think yes i said oh my
[1:42:41] goodness
[1:42:43] in the mess of believe the sound in the
[1:42:46] midst of people going away from the
[1:42:48] message
[1:42:49] there are still people that are
[1:42:52] believing that god can still use man
[1:42:56] there are still people that are
[1:42:58] believing never been to a message church
[1:43:00] you'll look at something on youtube and
[1:43:01] say wow
[1:43:10] and you know the thing the thing there
[1:43:11] is there there is is it's all about
[1:43:16] which one of the dogs you are feeling
[1:43:21] it's all about it if if there is an if
[1:43:24] there are just
[1:43:25] negative things in you you it would just
[1:43:27] draw you to negative things
[1:43:31] it would just be looking for every
[1:43:33] negative thing because that is what is
[1:43:34] in you sure
[1:43:36] you know and that is that is one of the
[1:43:38] amazing thing i'm all over the place
[1:43:40] from that but it's fine that is one of
[1:43:42] the amazing thing about the power of
[1:43:43] transformation romans chapter 12 be you
[1:43:46] renew bob uh you know the transformation
[1:43:49] of your mind like
[1:43:51] our brother preached on saturday night
[1:43:53] you know one of the things that blew my
[1:43:55] mind is that
[1:43:56] uh when you when you when you read the
[1:43:59] power of transformation you realize the
[1:44:02] way you think about it is that uh uh
[1:44:08] transform is to move from one state to
[1:44:11] another
[1:44:12] praise the lord
[1:44:14] but if you go in the message and you
[1:44:16] study when brethren preach the power of
[1:44:17] transformation
[1:44:19] the way he preached it is that this word
[1:44:23] brings out of you what is in you
[1:44:28] and because you are a son of god you are
[1:44:31] a daughter of god and the seed of god is
[1:44:34] lying dormant in your soul when you hear
[1:44:37] the word and keep feeling the word then
[1:44:40] encourage that see and keep giving you
[1:44:42] desire to move towards god because that
[1:44:46] is what is in you
[1:44:51] so the change that is taking place is
[1:44:53] not coming from fire
[1:44:55] no
[1:44:56] the change is coming from your soul
[1:44:59] because deep down in your soul that's
[1:45:01] there's a seed of god just like a button
[1:45:07] and the more you hear the word the more
[1:45:09] you hear no matter how much your mind
[1:45:12] has been polleted with master thing
[1:45:14] there is succeeding your soul the more
[1:45:17] you hear the word the more it draws you
[1:45:20] to do what is right
[1:45:25] this is not a magic show
[1:45:28] what a person says i would change this
[1:45:30] bottle of water to an oil they bring it
[1:45:32] down here and says whoa
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:45:35] that's night
[1:45:37] that's not the transformation we are
[1:45:38] talking about
[1:45:44] power of transformation is to bring out
[1:45:46] what god
[1:45:48] has placed in you from the foundation of
[1:45:50] the world
[1:45:51] that's the power of transformation that
[1:45:54] is what god is doing
[1:46:03] if it is not there you can practice it
[1:46:06] you can learn the language you can know
[1:46:07] the dress call you can know
[1:46:10] everything and do everything that you
[1:46:12] want to do
[1:46:14] go to all the conventions and just go
[1:46:16] everywhere
[1:46:19] if it is not there
[1:46:21] you will put your own
[1:46:22] list on facebook pretty soon
[1:46:30] praise the lord
[1:46:32] so you see that's the reason why
[1:46:34] the the power of transformation
[1:46:37] is in the word
[1:46:40] it was the word that transformed the
[1:46:42] earth
[1:46:45] when the earth was in darkness
[1:46:47] it was the word god said let there be
[1:46:51] it was the spoken word that transformed
[1:46:53] the earth
[1:46:55] because those seas were lying in the
[1:46:58] earth god never went breaking the ground
[1:47:00] plenty seats he said let the earth bring
[1:47:02] forth
[1:47:03] the sea was there
[1:47:06] that's what the power of transformation
[1:47:08] is is to bring what is already in the
[1:47:10] earth
[1:47:15] this is not a pentecostal movement
[1:47:18] to make people work out
[1:47:21] right praise the lord we're not running
[1:47:23] the boss scout
[1:47:27] let's go left right everybody left
[1:47:29] everybody right
[1:47:42] this word is only looking for what is in
[1:47:44] you
[1:47:48] it's looking for what is in you
[1:47:52] if i were you just like i myself
[1:47:56] i will be looking for what is in me
[1:47:59] what is in me lord what's my desire
[1:48:04] what's my desire
[1:48:06] what's my desire
[1:48:09] not making it up here
[1:48:11] but what is really down here
[1:48:17] do you really want to change
[1:48:21] do you do you really want the holy ghost
[1:48:24] oh it's just a show up
[1:48:28] if it is one it's not going to last
[1:48:32] children
[1:48:33] it's not going to last
[1:48:35] right
[1:48:39] that's what a prophet god will tell you
[1:48:41] you have to look at your motives
[1:48:43] and objectives
[1:48:45] all the time
[1:48:51] don't make it up
[1:48:54] don't cover up
[1:49:11] the inspiration of the almighty
[1:49:15] let me let's take something here
[1:49:17] maybe the law will give us another
[1:49:19] opportunity
[1:49:21] again but let's let's look at something
[1:49:23] here
[1:49:24] that that woman she was captured in an
[1:49:27] inspiration
[1:49:29] okay
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:32] and when she came to me the prophet
[1:49:37] the prophet saw how solid she was
[1:49:42] that this woman
[1:49:46] paul did not reveal anything to me he
[1:49:47] said he said but take my staff so the
[1:49:51] inspiration of the woman inspired the
[1:49:55] prophet
[1:49:56] sure
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:00] her inspiration
[1:50:02] inspired the prophet
[1:50:05] praise the lord preachers does that all
[1:50:07] the time one preacher preached a message
[1:50:09] another preacher is inspired to preach
[1:50:11] something else
[1:50:16] praise the lord
[1:50:17] amen when verb brian preached we saw the
[1:50:20] bride the the restoration of the bride
[1:50:22] tree he said i heard a brother talking
[1:50:24] about the enforcing anger
[1:50:26] you know he says that that enforcing
[1:50:28] that that that you know
[1:50:31] uh he says you know it struck him for
[1:50:33] him to go looking the hard talk about
[1:50:35] how the holy ghost is our you know our
[1:50:38] enforcing agent
[1:50:41] so her inspiration
[1:50:44] inspired the prophet
[1:50:46] sure
[1:50:48] praise the lord
[1:50:50] then he took his staff and said
[1:50:53] go and lay on the baby
[1:50:56] praise the lord
[1:50:59] his inspiration
[1:51:03] inspired the apostle paul
[1:51:08] verb says is from is from elijah
[1:51:12] inspiration of taking his staff to go
[1:51:15] and lay on the baby
[1:51:17] as chapter 19 paul took things from his
[1:51:20] body
[1:51:22] his clothes to go and lay on the sick
[1:51:30] his inspiration inspired the apostle
[1:51:33] paul
[1:51:37] they asked chapter 19 to talk things
[1:51:39] from the body of paul
[1:51:41] to lay on the sick
[1:51:46] that inspiration inspired brother
[1:51:49] branham
[1:51:52] praise the lord
[1:51:53] and what abraham says he says he says
[1:51:55] some he says take that he says take the
[1:51:58] the the prayer claw off or take that
[1:52:00] prayer and need and just lay it right on
[1:52:03] us chapter 19.
[1:52:10] praise the lord
[1:52:11] you see it's the inspiration of the
[1:52:13] almighty nobody have a franchise to it
[1:52:18] it's what god breaks down is what god
[1:52:20] gave to his people for the benefit of
[1:52:23] his people
[1:52:24] praise the lord
[1:52:27] amen you see the elijah elijah was
[1:52:31] inspired by the woman but he did not
[1:52:34] impersonate the woman
[1:52:36] there's a difference between inspiration
[1:52:38] and impersonation
[1:52:40] praise the lord
[1:52:42] paul was inspired by elisha but he did
[1:52:45] not impersonate elisha
[1:52:48] well now he's going everywhere with her
[1:52:50] staff take my staff and lay on him
[1:52:52] take my staff and lay on him
[1:52:55] take my staff and lay on them no
[1:52:59] praise the lord
[1:53:03] amen
[1:53:08] oh praise the lord
[1:53:11] i'm a little over nine o'clock tonight
[1:53:17] you love the lord
[1:53:18] i didn't even go into my scripture
[1:53:21] uh uh
[1:53:23] saint john chapter nine
[1:53:25] jesus
[1:53:28] saw the blind man
[1:53:30] the blind man came to him
[1:53:32] and uh and and he was inspired
[1:53:37] and what he did
[1:53:39] the bible said he spit on the ground
[1:53:44] and play in his own spate
[1:53:47] mix it with the dirt
[1:53:49] and rub it on the man eyes
[1:53:54] inspiration
[1:53:56] it looks stupid to medical science
[1:54:03] but it is the breath of god
[1:54:06] because it's the breath of god because
[1:54:09] it's god breathing in that instance
[1:54:12] is bound to give a result
[1:54:17] it's bound to give life
[1:54:20] because it's god's breath
[1:54:22] in that very moment
[1:54:24] you are just a china that god is
[1:54:26] breathing through
[1:54:28] to do what you are doing
[1:54:30] go back and try again it will not work
[1:54:35] because it was only good for that moment
[1:54:41] go smith on the ground and dropping on
[1:54:43] somebody either like you're in jail
[1:54:50] right
[1:54:53] praise the lord
[1:54:58] amen it will lock you open jay uh uh uh
[1:55:04] brown did uh by faith moses
[1:55:08] he talks about how moses uh you know the
[1:55:10] persecuted for the world he says yeah
[1:55:11] we'll be pers he said but don't do
[1:55:13] things
[1:55:14] to be persecuted
[1:55:17] don't do things to bring persecution on
[1:55:19] yourself and say they are persecuting me
[1:55:24] you are misrepresenting the world
[1:55:31] you are misrepresenting
[1:55:33] the truth
[1:55:39] that's the reason why as children of god
[1:55:42] we have to live
[1:55:45] every day
[1:55:47] our best
[1:55:50] we have to be in the right state of mind
[1:55:54] no matter how the devil tried to blast
[1:55:56] our mind from year to
[1:55:58] day we came in the right state of mind
[1:56:03] in the right attitude
[1:56:06] because you will never know when god
[1:56:08] will want to breathe for a situation
[1:56:11] he will just want to inspire you
[1:56:14] right there for you to do something
[1:56:17] to give life to somebody
[1:56:40] god breathed into man
[1:56:43] a man became a living soul
[1:56:45] every time the breath of god
[1:56:48] every time the breath of god
[1:56:51] goes into man
[1:56:54] he lives
[1:57:00] when the church comes together
[1:57:05] and by the word i was going to talk
[1:57:06] about different things anointing oil
[1:57:09] and there's no time for that tonight the
[1:57:12] church comes together and it says we
[1:57:13] have a media church this brother is
[1:57:16] sacred this sister is sick let's buy our
[1:57:17] heads and pray
[1:57:21] when the church comes together and pray
[1:57:26] and there is nothing that handles that
[1:57:28] prayer god sees the the attitude of the
[1:57:32] people
[1:57:33] everybody is involved everybody is
[1:57:34] engaged
[1:57:36] there is no nothing there
[1:57:38] he just
[1:57:46] and the sister or the brother says
[1:57:48] oh thank god when the church pray for me
[1:57:52] i was healed
[1:57:56] is god finding a china to breathe true
[1:58:03] it's you being a china it's me being a
[1:58:07] china
[1:58:08] for god to breathe through
[1:58:10] to give life
[1:58:13] if god is not breathing through me to
[1:58:15] give life to this church
[1:58:17] we are just working ourself up yes
[1:58:21] we are just working ourselves up pretty
[1:58:24] soon we will catch ourselves that we're
[1:58:26] going nowhere
[1:58:33] but if his god is breathing through the
[1:58:35] ministry
[1:58:36] the life of people will change
[1:58:40] people will be delivered people will be
[1:58:42] challenged
[1:58:45] people will be encouraged
[1:58:51] is because god is breathing true
[1:59:02] that's the reason why the church don't
[1:59:03] run
[1:59:04] by people idea
[1:59:06] oh i think we must do this i think we
[1:59:09] must do that
[1:59:10] i think we must do that
[1:59:13] instead of you thinking
[1:59:15] be praying
[1:59:19] that's how inspiration comes by praying
[1:59:21] not by thinking
[1:59:26] why we can't do this why we can do this
[1:59:30] why we can do this
[1:59:38] musicians you can come tonight
