momentarily praise be to God okay oh God bless you brother Derek my bless you Sister and the entire family happy to have you in our midst tonight praise be to God yes um I know you you were expecting brother one uh so do I I was expecting him to I spoke to him on um on Monday and he told me he'll be in town this afternoon and uh he'll be in in a very good time to take the service and I woke up this morning and I saw a text saying that there is a flight delay and I should prepare for the service tonight and God was so good I got to work and I no wonder some of the people say I get away with everything I was sitting at the computer so busy I know if they should set a trap for me it's very easy to get me I was just sitting down just typing and then just uh what have you and my manager Works in with some papers I said I guess you want to see me oh no not you has your pastor come because I told him a pastor has traveled has your personal come I said no he's not come yet um and he's asked me to prepare for tonight's service so I'm just so okay and then she was just standing and looking at what I was doing and I had been there for probably over two hours and um it's not very common in that building first day to God but we thank God for his grace yes good to see every one of you yes um praise God we'll just thank God for everything you know last night um I wouldn't say last night because I went to bed uh probably a quarter to 12. so it was the early hours of this morning and I had a dream and before then when I dropped my wife off work for me sleeping at 11 30 is normal um after 12 is normal 18 after 12 is abnormal for me so because I dropped my wife off work by 10 and then I get home by 10 30 and I take time to pray before I go upstairs so I sleep anywhere between 11 30 and 12. and uh so my manager hears that she says so well done you are crazy yeah it looks it looks very much like it fresh beat together so when I got one when I was on my way home yesterday and I was driving in fact I felt the presence of God so much in the truck that I started cheering and in fact I just didn't know how I got home because I was so much consumed and I was just going I got home I just find time to pray as usual and I went up um and I went to bed probably close to 12. and I had a dream the early hours of this morning I was on the field I have been thinking and I believe it was brother Johnny I think it was brother Johnny we were on the field I don't remember what we were doing and then all of a sudden I looked in the skies and there was light very Shining like the star so I was looking at it then it started expanding expanding you know when you flash a Searchlight in the air you can see the race so there was a ray coming down from that light horizontally and I was looking at it and I said wow I wish this thing could come down and then it was coming down gradually gradually gradually and then it just came right where I was right from the heavens and it just came right where I was and stopped right there and it started Shining and immediately in the dream I started feeling hit and then he started penetrating my body it went through the marrows of my bone and it was so sharp that I just started the heat was so terrible and I just I was just lying down and I started praising God I said thank you Jesus praise be to God I was just praising God and crying in my dream and then I woke up no I didn't wake up one day that portion of the dream was over it took quite a while in the dream when that portion of the dream was over I was still lying down and I was just praising God just praising God just worshiping God and crying and then you know sometimes you get a dream and you wake up I just slept through until my alarm went off at 4 30. and I woke up and normally I'll just wake up get ready and go to work I woke up somebody said look at your phone I took my phone and I saw by the once message say get ready for service tonight in case I do not come I say okay so I replied him and said well every delay is according to God's plan so don't worry about coming in early we just want you back safe praise be to God so what I believe it was a Divine visitation nothing can take that away from me I have had several dreams probably that was the third or the fourth dream I have had seen light but this was different praise be to God something happened praise be to God whatever it was I do not know but something happened wonderful by the grace of God we have made Saints it is not to say we are going to make it we have made it by the grace of God by Grace we have made it you know one time I had a dream I shared that dream that morning we want to see snowman's Place were invited you know to go and get some coffee um by the way I've never forgotten of that coffee we'll have to talk about it sometime and I shared a dream there I had a dream somebody asked me why are you going to spend eternity it's an answer we all know I believe that you would answer it without even thinking about it and as soon as I open my mouth something took over my vocal cords something took over that it was no longer I that was in control over my voice and then the voice that took over said and then I was lying down I wanted to take over and let's say heaven but I couldn't something took over my voice then I was lying down in the dream I was saying that the place we all want to go starts with her and a place we don't want to go nobody wants to go we don't even want our enemies to go there also starts with her foreign and then I had heaven so even when I had heaven I had to catch myself then I rehearsed in the dream heaven before I started shouting I said praise God Heaven praise God so you know it is just by grace it is not our efforts it is not what but what we can do it is what God has done never trust in your abilities in the foolish works of God and God will never let you down praise be to God I have as I've said before and I'm going to say it again God did not deliver us from that life of Darkness only to leave us Midway no God forbid God delivered us from point A and he is bringing us to an expected end there is no doubt praise be to God we are Overcomers we have overcome in Christ Jesus the Bible says that we already seated in Heavenly places through Christ Jesus it doesn't matter one day could be the last it doesn't matter what happens when you have salvation it doesn't matter how you go yes it doesn't matter how you go praise be to God and I don't go to bed thinking how I go I don't care whether it is by air by sea by land I don't care what happens praise be to God just remember Who You Are praise be to God this morning oh my God I don't know what I'm doing here praise the Lord tonight there is a thought I want us to talk about and um if we may stand and open our Bibles to Psalm psalm 91. Psalm 91 7 to 16. it looks like time is already trying to run away from me Psalm 91 7. I think just for the sake of time I may probably Jump Ahead uh you can read it when you get home uh let me just drop down to 11. for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall birdy up in their hands lest thou touch their foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and other the Young Lion and the dragon shout out trample on their feet because he have set his love upon you are upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him praise be to God I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and shoot him salvation praise be to God Isaiah 65 Isaiah 65 24 Isaiah 65 24 . and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear amen praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated I titled this message calling his direct line praise be to God calling his direct line God saved us because he wanted to have a relationship with us we know that being a father was one of his attributes and to be to be a father was to have children and not to have children and be running behind them down the valley and up the hill every day every with a whip no God wanted to have a relationship with his children so much so that the fall could not even stop it right amen godward was determined and even though there was a fall that did not stop God from having a relationship with his children God did not just create us just for us to be on our own God wants to be in our lives God is interested in your success even in your failure God is so interested he is interested in every detail of your life whether you raise or you fall whether you eat or not whether you are Sleepless not or not whether you are going to try us through trials or Temptations God is interested in that life and God wants to be a part God doesn't sit on the fence no only to look on while you are going through trials while you are going through troubles while you are just struggling in one world the other whatever it is that you may be going through praise the Lord now the fall could not stop God and that a lot of the times actually has become our problem that we can look at our lives and we can see where God took us from and we can actually put on paper almost every button we did all the places we have been all the life we have lived and then you tell somebody God has forgiven you I said and he has forgiving me everything yes God has forgiven you everything God never holds anything against you when you accept that sacrifice when you accept the Lord Jesus as your personal Lord and savior and your sins are confessed under the blood God does not hold anything against you and brother Abraham said that in God's eyes it was like you never did it to begin with that is how strong and how powerful the blood is it doesn't matter how dirty how filthy that life is that sin is one is being confessed and it drops in the blood it dissolves it it dissolves it that God looks in there and all he sees is the blood praise be to God does not see your wrongdoing because the blood has covered it there is enough Power in the Blood to cleanse any sin there is no sin that is too great ah to be to be dangerous to be forgiven praise be to God and why would God do it because God cannot Fellowship with sin and for God to have fellowship with his children he has made a provision so God can have fellowship with his children what what son or what daughter is it that does not want to have fellowship with the father I don't kept they do wrong your heart still goes after them yeah and I am talking about the natural Realm right hey think about God and his children we can talk about the Prodigal Son I believe he did he just didn't come to the father one time that you know what I just want to go somewhere give me my part of our inheritance um you are you are living too long I don't think you are going to die now just give me what belongs to me probably he was pastoring the Father Day in day out and the father said you know what Come Get It Go and when he left the father never stopped thinking about him he went I believe for every day his father was living the father was praying and looking in the direction that his son went hoping that one day he was going to return through that same path and he may have got to God praying let his boy hit a brick wall let him hit a brick wall so hard that he will think of coming back home let him blow off all the wealth probably he went and he this time he spent he was getting great gains by The Father's Heart was after him and the father was always and looking in hoping that one day he was going to retire you know the story no he came back and his father was already in the field waiting for him he was probably thinking how am I going to go back off he may have thought about it for days and weeks and months and he guided courage let me go anyhow I know I don't deserve to be a son anymore but probably he could take me in as as a servant that alone is okay and then he was probably thinking you know what I'm just going to get it in the night and I'm just going to hide you know see planning maybe planning his own way how to do things right little did he know that his father was having sleepless nights because of him and that he was on the field always looking for him waiting for his return praise be to God that he came he kissed a servant cows now the whole room for him as a servant he was always a son and he would always be a son praise be to God he was a son and he would always be now when a child of God when you stray from the path of righteousness look when you decide you want to go God will never stop you we are free moral agents you can choose what you do God would never stop you he will let go of you but because you are a child of God God will be waiting for you while you left off a child of God God will be waiting for you praise be to God Revelations 2 5. remember therefore from West Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and we remove that Candlestick out of his place except thou repent remember therefore from West Thou Art Fallen when you fall a child of God when a child of God Falls when a child of God stress on the path of righteousness God has not just come and condemn you and destroy you no a child of God God is waiting for you you can go and go and go and go with the foolishness of this world God is waiting for you while you left off to go forward repentance is not for the unbelievers repentance is for the children of God for the unbelievers what we call sin is a normal way of life but for a child of God when you do anything that is contrary to the word of God something in you tells you that you are not supposed to do this you know better or you should know better you are a child of God and you go back and you repent and they feel like oh it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it matters right I remember one time a guy at work was telling me there is no God he doesn't believe in God and I told him it's because of you God has brought me to this company praise be to God but after a while I saw that it was he was offended I believe so I went to him one I don't know what I think it was in the morning and I called him I said John you know you and I had this conversation he said yeah I've noticed that um I offended you uh and I'm sorry about it I said no no no no no I said I said are you sure I said well whichever way um you know a repentance is is good for the soul sometimes you will think that oh when I go and I and I tell the fellow I am sorry oh I tell the person oh I told a lie oh I tell the person how I I did this I stole this oh I'm sorry this is it I we think that that belittles you no it doesn't belittle you and if it does praise God a child of God it shouldn't be too difficult nothing should be too difficult for you to repent of if people want to laugh let them laugh at you if they want to write a book about you let them write it but make sure that your life with God Is Right make sure your life with God Is Right now when you are going to bed you are going to bed with the hope that if Christ comes tonight I am going by the grace of God that I'm not going to be left behind right we have a place to go Saints God would not condemn you for being a sinner but God would condemn you for choosing to remain a sinner after the provision has been made for your salvation if you turn it down what else do you have what else do you have if you take Christ down what else do you have if Christ doesn't mean anything to you what else is the value of life if there are other things in life that means a lot more to you than Christ why else my goodness God have mercy God have mercy what just look at your life you know yourself better than anybody knows you of course God knows you better than you know yourself look at your life and ask yourself where your heart is it's not about putting up think about just just salvation is an individual affair ask yourself ask yourself look at yourself in the mirror of the word of God ask yourself that the life you are living if Christ should come tonight where do you stand why do you stand what matters to you the most why your treasure is there your heart will be let your mind stay on God school is good go to school work is good work if you don't work don't eat praise the Lord but do not let work take all your time that you don't even have time for God praise be to God money is good at the end of the day it's just a piece of paper right man that doesn't just mean anything what are we carrying it to it's just to make life a little comfortable while we are here right we don't need money to go to heaven if God gives it to you praise God if he doesn't praise God the Bible says that this is therefore the condemnation that light has come into the world and man loved Darkness because the ideas were evil that after the light is shown after the sacrifice has been made and then you still are comfortable living in sin you still are comfortable living the old way life you still are comfortable doing things you know a child of God should not do go into place you know a child where God should not go just I mean then there is trouble then there is trouble we are talking about calling his direct line calling his direct line so God made man to worship God made us to worship so when you are not worshiping God void there gets occupied with something else you worship something because that is what you are made for make sure that God is occupying in that void why again because God wants to have a relationship with his children praise be to God you can have children and the children grow you know they are just very very interesting when they are small and when they got to 18 some of them cannot even wait till they are 18 and they want to leave the house praise the Lord when they are small you are just running around and then I remember it was just Joshua alone who escaped by Dani Emmanuel and gospel we used to be on the bed just rolling and biting their chicks and they were showing me that the mother would run in when I do it to my son I say we are playing thank you yeah we are playing and they are so nice and then they'll grow and then they want to run away but even when they grow even when they grow and they get married they leave the house still you still want to have a relationship with them in one way or the other they are still keeping contact either through social media are through letters through um phone calls they are still keeping their relationship alive they are still keeping the relationship yeah I watch a documentary of a mother whose daughter I believe she was the only Dora no she was not the only daughter I think that she had a lot of dollars yes not a lot of children but out of those children it was that girl that lady forever every single day at a particular time she will call her mother every single day when that time is reaching she's getting to her phone so much so that when that time was reaching her mother whatever she was doing she would leave it and they'll go sit by the phone because she knew that there was a call coming and it never failed for years until one day she got up and sat by the phone and the car never came she wanted the call never came she wanted it wasn't coming she said no there must be something and she took the phone no there was no response called no response then she called the police and said she thinks there was something wrong and indeed when they went there there was something wrong they so much had a relationship that at a particular time in the day daughter was just daughter couldn't wait to talk to Mommy couldn't wait to hear from Dora and that is the type of relationship God wants to have with his children that when that time is coming that time you have set for you and God when that time is coming God cannot wait because he knows his daughter is going to call he knows his son is going to call and he is sitting down and waiting for that call unlike the mother who couldn't see what was going to happen until it happened we are serving a living God who knows the end from the beginning and he knows every move of the devil that whatever move the Devil Makes he knows about it and the Bible says that when the enemy comes against us like a flood the spirit of God will lift up a standard against him any move the Devil Makes God makes a move our lives are protected there is we are protected praise be to God I mean you look at your life look at my life my life is just a mystery praise be to God I can tell you several places in my life I've said it a thousand times over I'm not supposed to be living right but here I am and the devil cannot do anything about it he doesn't have to like it praise be to God we are going to live to declare the glory of the Lord we are going to live to serve the purpose of God in our lives we are going to do the will of God before we come to the end of our road we are going to live here as old as God's own time yeah they keep talking about Ted World War Ted World War missiles Russia we don't care about that let it come right let it come just make sure that your life with God Is Right I killed I tell this voice they think they are small boys they are not small in Ghana there was a little boy he was 12 years old my time is running out praise be to God Amen he left mommy and daddy and he was evangelizing following buses everywhere one day we'll tell that story praise be together yes um yes so calling his direct line now at the red line is a special line for a special people right it is a is different from the normal business line which everybody has access to right calls that are made to a direct line do not pass through anybody either a secretary a teller an intermediary no it is going straight to the end that is a direct line to have this have this line of a particular person yeah you are a business friend a schoolmate a close friend a son a father a wife a husband a relative you must belong to be able to get a direct access yes it's not just given to anybody no no praise be to God you must be long in order to be able to have it and God has a special line for a special people and what makes you special it is not your birth it is not the hospital you were born in it is not your parents it is not your wealth it is not your political affiliation no it is not your social standard not the educational background what makes you special your relationship with God that makes you special your relationship with God that makes you special let's read from Matthew 27 51. Matthew 27 51 Matthew 27 51. okay married 27 51. and behold I think I went ahead of myself oh no I'm sorry Deuteronomy 7 6. Deuteronomy 7 6. Deuteronomy 7 6. for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth talking about the natural Israel which applies to us the spiritual Israel praise be to God so what makes you special is not you the Lord for thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord that God has chosen thee to be a special people it is the chosen of the Lord it is the chosen of the Lord it has nothing to do with you I don't care what do you do it has nothing to do with you it has everything to do with God praise the Lord every child of God has a direct access to the throne of God on Calvary on that day when the blood of the Lord Jesus was shared and the Earth shook and they write the Rocks rent the Bible says in Matthew 27 51 that the veil that was before the temple read from top to bottom right to give access to the throne of God this was a Preserve of the high priest that for him to even go there he had to follow some protocols right if he missed one he would go in but he will not come out but today you and I we can just go in anyhow and God will still open his arm of love so wide to embrace us as we come in praise be to God that it is no longer the high priest that just goes in to atone for you and me that we have direct access to the throne of God that we can walk in every time of day and we can just tread unto him and he hears us praise be to God Matthew 27 51 you can read that later now in the message the Mighty God unveiled brother says when the veil was read at Calvary The Mercy Seat came in Plainview but what happened it was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood as they had took blood year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary and the sprinkling of the messy seat there God with his Great Mighty stroke of lightning lightning power split the old budget Veil from top to bottom and the messy seat came in Plainview the real genuine Lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary the real messy seat when God had paid the price himself and become one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we to be acquainted with him again relationship The Mercy Seat was in plain view of all Israel on that day of the atonement but alas the traditions of the church fathers in that day had their Traditions had their veiled not had veiled the true Mercy Seat from the people if they would have known the scripture each piece would have come like the Chinese tag the Old Testament prophecy would have been fulfilled and it was and if they had been taught the scripture they would have seen The Mercy Seat when the blood of the atonement touched the ground praise be to God it gave us an access unlimited access unlimited access praise be to God what excuse would you have for not saving God can you think of one can you think of one excuse that you have my goodness the other day I saw um somebody singing um he was born crippled from birth he has no legs and uh he was singing and then thanking God that God has given him legs and yeah this man has no legs and he was happy he was very happy with what he has the Bible says godliness with contentment is a great game do not covet be happy Who You Are be happy with what God has given you be satisfied with it right and I looked at him singing with her shoes on because he doesn't even have the leg for shoes and he was so happy praising God that God has given him legs I looked at it and it broke my heart yes Lord have mercy what excuse what excuse one one excuse if I ask for two I may give you headache yes I'm asking for only one can you can you can you think of one excuse one one excuse you would have for not serving God that on that day God will ask you what did you do with my word and you you have one excuse that you give God that this was the reason and God was so well done my son come in well done my daughter coming can you have one in whatever situation you find yourself in no that as a child of God that God is satisfied with your life if his wealth God can give you wealth in abundance you can live your whole life and never get headache you can just touch anything to be I mean God will just open but but but you know the Bible says Jesus suffered he led obedience from the test he suffered I'm a father I have children those who will not come to me and say Daddy I want a butcher's knife and I'll just get up and say this is one it's very very short take it I know there are a lot of things we ask for and sometimes it is for is to our own destruction but we do not have the first side we don't have the eyes to see and we are so bent upon it there was a man in Ghana not bought a car it's also the brand new car it was a used car and that's that Christmas that's that the year that same year in that Christmas before the Christmas he took his wife and children in that car and that was the last they had an accident and all of them died then you wonder was it a blessing there are a lot of things we ask for we do not know what we are asking for if God gives it to you praise God if God doesn't give it to you praise God your salvation is the most important thing nothing else matters right your salvation is the most important thing your salvation is the most important thing what God is doing in your life that is the most important thing not what you are doing what you are doing as Solomon said is buried you upon vanity not just vanity but vanity upon vanity yeah vanity times vanity yes we have mathematicians in the house praise God that is how useless life is without God praise the Lord I didn't know how we got there so God has a direct line and the right line brings you into direct contact with god without an intermediary you don't have to go through somebody and no if I have a challenge and I'm praying and I'm trusting God for something yeah I can tell you brother help me in prayer I can tell you sister help me in prayer I can bring you to the church church help me in prayer there is nothing wrong with that praise be to God there is nothing wrong with it but we are not going through anybody we are not going through anybody you can come before God talk to God and God will hear you the same way he will hear the other person right God has no grandchildren we are all children of God if God can hear you God can hear me if God can hear me God can hear you yes we are not going through anybody you ought to have a personal relationship with God you ought to no two ways about that you have an Express attention from God the angel of the Lord Daniel 10 12. you can read that when you get home poor Daniel not from the first day from the very first day he set his face to seek the face of God answered his prayer by the praise of the kingdom of Persia we stood him and Daniel didn't stop praying no that is the how good it is when you know pick God hears you that you have no doubt no second thought you speak that you know God hears you so even when the result is not coming you know that is for a good cause praise be together you can read that way I know we all know the story from the very first day we are not going through any intermediary sometimes God will test your patience in a lot of ways praise be to God now faith is the Bedrock we are not talking of abstract faith faith that is just hanging in the balance no our faith must be anchored in the world for Faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of God the word of God is the foundation of our faith Miracles are good signs and mothers are good we love them brother said they would increase your faith but they don't give you Faith No what gives you faith is the word how you ought to entertain the world how you ought to live by the world how you ought to let the word of God become your absolute that you take it and you just enjoy it whether you are reading on the computer on your phone you are having your Bible you just you know sometimes you laugh and people look at you they think you are crazy you know I mean I just oh my goodness we are seven our our heavenly father is so good I look at me and I ask myself oh the trouble have been through why would God so love me so much brother Derek I have not forgotten your request I spoke with brother one one time and I was telling him brother Derek asked for you know some of the dreams I've been having a lot of dreams God has a way of dealing with every one of us God deals with me through dreams a lot the first dream I had was in um was not I I think it's 1988 1989 to be on the same ground 98 1989 and from that time this year alone I've had three spiritual dreams including what I just shared with you tonight three okay and uh I don't write anything down but by the grace of God everything is here I don't go to bed praying that I want to drink no I don't know I'm going to drink no it just comes and I try reading something about dreams from the prophet and he said it's just the way God has wired you we are wired differently very good so I have not for watching that request I was telling me the one I want to find a day it doesn't matter whatever I direct is here or not or just come and encourage ourselves with all those dreams and um and I'll let you know praise the Lord yes oh my so faith is the word I mean of the word cause is attention it brings Fellowship between God and man the area code because if you're making a call there is an area code before the number and the area code I have here just for the purpose of this meeting the area code is faith faith that is uncaught in the word of God that is the area code because First Carry by hearing and hearing by the word of God faith has a resting place and that is the word it is not your emotional appeal to God it is not the jumping and the shouting and the screaming and the rolling no it's in the life right because without faith the Bible says no man can please God if you don't have the right code you can dial the number a thousand times and it will not go through right right and I have here again just for the purpose of this meeting the number is prayer prayer does not hang in a balance neither faith the area code alone does not make a phone call neither the number without the code yes as an area code and a number move together prayer and faith move together you need the area code and a number to be able to make a call yes you can just make a call with a without a code no buff they need one another and for you to be able to call the throne room of God you need that area code and the number Faith does not hang in a balance you need faith and prayer and I think I have a scripture here James 5 6. that says that the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous much your faith would produce a life because the Bible says faith without words is dead by the life you live people would know what you have believed right and where you stand yeah so Faith must produce whites faith without works the Bible says is dead there are times you call a number without an area code like calling a number that has the same area code with your number like our seven safety number 5763 number if I want to call my wife I don't have to dial a 763 that is the area code I just go in straight and I'm talking to her that is what I mean here I don't need faith to talk to you to talk to you praise the Lord because we are in the same area code on Earth we're in the same code better talk to God you need faith you need that area code you are on earth and he is in heaven yeah a completely different Realm but if there are different Realms you must prefix it with an area code and a prayer is calling in a different dimension brother Brandon said prayer is divine you are talking to God is divine you are making a call to a different realm and you need that code right you need that area code you need faith for without faith you can never receive anything from God that is how important faith is to them that belief the Bible says all things are possible prayer is your number faith is your area code you need a two together to be able to get to the throne room of God if I was asked in an exam who the father of Faith was I was probably going to mention Elijah or Joshua because this was a man that stopped the Sun from moving Elijah stopped the rain there was no even due for a special three and a half years but when it comes to the father of faith the Bible says it's Abram so faith is not getting an instant result When you pray right Abraham did not get an instant result but yet he is the father of faith right so when you pray have patience with God When you pray believe that God has answered your prayer but have patience with God it doesn't have to be instantaneous the man has Faith he does he just happens right if it doesn't happen it doesn't mean there is no faith as a matter of fact it takes a lot more faith to wait that to get it immediately it takes a lot more faith than when you have prayed and you have not seen the result and you believe you have seen it right and evidence of things hoped for a substance of his hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen you haven't seen it you have prayed you haven't seen it but you believe is that oh man yeah probably you are still working with the same problem and people are looking at you and they're laughing at you and he said I am healed but they say nobody look at you you are saying the same person let's have a sin I am healed it takes place with God it doesn't have to be on the moment if it happens that is good but we need faith learn to trust in God praise be to God when you have the area code we saw we can talk about a few people in the scriptures how Jonah in the belly of the whale dialed goes direct line I am here on Earth if you take me right now if you ask me where East West North is I can try but if you just pin me around 10 times and I get dizzy and you ask me what is East I bet you I may try for answers because I know north east south west therefore right if the face is not right the second will be right if my second is not right I'll get it the third time if I don't get it the title I saw the fourth I'll never miss but can you imagine a man in the belly of the whale and he remembered that wherever you find yourself if you can just turn and face the temple and you cry out to God God will hear you what does that what does that he was not just in the he was not just in the sea he was in the belly of the whale in the sea my goodness and the Bible says by faith praise God the Bible does not play with words the Bible says by faith he turned my goodness it doesn't matter whether he was facing west it doesn't matter whether he was Facing East and the temple was North that didn't matter to him he said this is why you are Temple and he prayed and he prayed and God spoke to the will to carry him on land goes the red line calling his direct line you can talk about Elijah a liar did not even pray as I was saying that when you are on the same area code if you have the same area code with somebody you can dial their number using the area code that is fine right so a child of God nothing stops you from prayer and if you have the same area code with them you can dial that number without the area code and the number is going to go through I think I have something here I may have gone ahead of myself by a paragraph we'll be closing very soon bear with me praise the Lord now I don't know if I have jumped it somewhere um when you have an area code with this with someone okay you don't need to call the area code um so when you are in the same area code with God sometimes you just speak I have John 15 5 to 7. let's see what is there John 15 John 15 John 15 five to seven all right so I read I am the Vine here are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringer for my fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast off as a branch and it's with it and man gathered them and cut them into the fire and they are bent if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you praise be to God when ye abide in me and I in you praise be to God that it is no longer you it's Christ in you you are in the same area code with God you can pray all right and a gust moment in your life where you just speak right something happens you just speak and you see this happen before your very eyes I remember in Tema in Ghana Ghana Tema the city the Port City a man went into a little girl to take advantage of her in her absence of her parents and this girl when she turned and saw this man closing the door behind her she said she she just shouted in the name of Jesus I struggled with blindness and the man just screamed and turned and was looking for the doorknob to get out of the door he got blind right there and then hey just a point in your life there is no time to pray you just speak and you see God move on the scene praise the Lord we saw that in the life of Moses when the children of God were delivered and they got to the Red Sea and they saw the Egyptians coming and he'll look at them and he just spoke these Egyptians you see you shall see them no more he had already passed judgment on them and God withheld it God withheld it yeah and all of them perished none of them survived they all perished Elijah he said according to my word there is not going to be rain no deal until I call for it praise be to God Amen we are children of God with authority never underestimate what God can do with you praise be to God Heaven is counting on us we are children of God praise be to God Heaven is counting on us Heaven is counting on you don't say I am small no it's the small one God wants because if your big God cannot use him don't say you're small praise the Lord now the musicians can come over calling his direct line God has his direct line and that direct line is not given to anybody everybody that direct line is given to people that are in his inner circles not to anybody not with just anybody and we all have that direct line God has given that direct line to that special group of people and we are those special people it has nothing to do with you you are special because God has made you special just keep feeding on the word keep living by the word keep entertaining the world just live the life you must be special to have the word of God entrusted in your career if God knows

some customers and he doesn't care how many people are there in that company but when somebody speaks he can tell who is speaking it doesn't matter if million people are calling at the same time that your voice is unique to God that when that voice comes through God can tell [Music] this is my son this is my daughter I don't want to start mentioning names because we are not here tonight if I mention whenever I have to make sure I mention everybody's name before they say oh the brother left me out foreign is unique to God [Music] that God is always waiting just waiting to hear from you he is waiting and when God is not hearing from you he is worried he knows what is going on in our life he knows it there is nothing that is hidden before you God wants to have a relationship with you on a daily basis not when things go wrong for some of us that is when we know to go to God when things are not going well then we know where to run to but when things are okay we hardly think about God how heartwarming is it to know that the father is just waiting to hear from you and the Bible says pray without cease prayer without Caesar foreign you feel like praying as a matter of fact there are times I've got before my knees and I hardly know what I'm going to say but it turns out to be the most wonder some of the most glorious times I've ever had before God did I just go and I don't even know why those words are coming from and I just feel the presence of God if you want to follow your feeling you will never even pray because you pray when you feel like prayer without season pray in season out of season prayer when things are good prayer won't kiss her bad Pray when you're on your back do you want to find yourself hanging in the sky still pray always remember that when you open your eyes to call to call his direct line he is there there is no intermediary he is there waiting for your call and that your call goes straight to the throne room of the almighty God praise be to God that God wants to hear your voice and when you go believe it God believer for to them that believe all things are possible shall we stand on our feet I wanted to talk to God tonight as I've said
