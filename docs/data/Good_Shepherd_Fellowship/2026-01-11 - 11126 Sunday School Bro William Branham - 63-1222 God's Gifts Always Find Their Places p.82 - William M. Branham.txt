TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] Jesus in the city of Nazareth, the meanest city there was in the land. But God chose a little lady to give birth to his son. &gt;&gt; A decabator, a womb that had to a baby had to be born by. He took such a person to do it. God works through human beings to redeem human beings. He can take you work through you to redeem humanity. If you'll completely dedicate everything you are. If you're a young woman, dedicate your morals. You're a young man, dedicate your morals. Dedicate your mind. Dedicate your thinking. Dedicate your heart. Dedicate your soul. Dedicate all you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let Christ work through that. What a glorious thing. Got the rivers to cross. You got the the bridges to go over. You've got the You got the fire patches. You got the thicket. You got the woods. You got the dark places. You've got the high hills. You got the high climbs. What are you doing? Someday you'll have to stand there and look back. See where you come from. And you're going to be judged by the course you take. Put your your all your mind and your thoughts on that north star, the center of God, and don't move from it. Stay right with it. It'll bring you straight like it did the magi, right straight to the Christ. All right? Anointed him with mira. We find out now in John 12 1 and 7, that's just exactly what he done. He was a perfect servant of God and had him anointed with all of his divine gifts. He was anointed with all God's gift because he was God. He was God. See, they brought him gifts. Now we'll be I wish the people here always uh most of you know send you something. Now when he comes back to send him back, I couldn't do it. See, it's a world over. I just couldn't do it. And I appreciate the little little things and things that people does to express herself and their thankfulness and so forth. Now this is what these rich men done. These men are magi. They bought gold, pure gold. They brought frankincense, the best they could find. They brought mura, the best they could find. We realize over here in St. John 12, we find out that this woman, if we had time to read it, but I don't want to keep you too long to see cuz I know tomorrow is Monday. You know, somebody had to work. Look, they brought this this woman brought this mirror, that anointed costly something to take the smell of dead away. And she broke this alabaster box and poured it up on the head of Jesus. And Judas said, "Why, this ought to have been given to the poor." said not that he had respect for the poor but he was a thief to begin with. He carried the money and said this ought to have been sold instead of part and Jesus said let her alone for she did this she anointed him until his burial. Right. &gt;&gt; See this woman so grateful that her sins were forgiven until she spent all her money she had and took it out of the pastor box and broke it and tore the oil and just ordered the room with fine smell of this mirror that she had anointed him for his death. Now see she did the service not knowing what she was doing but she was so grateful to God. And if you're so grateful for Christmas, just not to say, "I I give Jones as a gift, they give me one back, I'll see what I got in the morning." Won't you open up your heart and see what's in there? &gt;&gt; Find out what you got in here. And except if you find it empty with just negative creeds and and and cares of the world, why not ask Christ to fill it tonight? &gt;&gt; Tonight. so that you can get the real meaning of Christmas. It it's Christ in you, God dwelling in the human heart. That's what the real Christmas means. But you see, today we become so negative. It's a devil getting us through that. It's painted candy sticks and and a reindeer and and a whiskered man and flies through the air like an airplane and visits the whole world and every home with a little fun of toys on his back and visits every child. It's it's just a lie. It's just right out of line. See? Now, see, but what the devil did that so we could twist the minds of people. The commercial world got into it and they well, they make enough through Christmas time until they can retire the rest of the year almost. I talked to a merchant the other day. He said, "You give me these two weeks and if I didn't have to keep my band here," said I'd wait till next Christmas. I could go fishing or whatever I want to do till next Christmas. He said, "But I keep the boys going to just keep me here just enough to keep my business open and it keeps it keeps my hands paid off and things I don't pay nothing till Christmas time comes on." You see, it's become a great commercial thing when it ought to be a worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Worship. Now God so anointed Jesus with the fullness of himself to the he was God's gift to the world that the wise men are clearly identified that their offering their gift to him showed that in their heart they knew who he was and what he was going to do for them. So no wonder the first thing they did, they fell down perfectly in order and worshiped him before they could even understand it. They fell down and worshiped it and then presented their gifts. That's the way to have real Christmas. Worship him then present your gift. Presenting your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. But you know what? The wise men did that. The father and mother of Christ that foster father of course and also a mother because God was both his father and mother. But we find out that they Now God has so anointed Jesus with the fullness of himself to the he was God's gift to the world that the wise men are clearly identified that their offering their gift to him showed that in their heart they knew who he was and what he was going to do for them. So no wonder the first thing they did they fell down perfectly in order and worshiped him before they could even understand it. They fell down and worshiping and then presented their gifts. That's the way to have real Christmas. Worship him then present your gift. presenting your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. But you know what after the wise man did that? The father and mother of Christ that fostered father of course and also a mother because God was both his father and mother. But we find out that they accepted these gifts from these wise men. No wonder they were called wise men. They were wise. They were really had wisdom. If man today would just be that wise just as w it takes a wise man to come to Christ. A man that turns away from him is an unwise man. But it takes a wise man to come to Christ. Now notice and after that the wise man identifying him what he would be and we find through the scripture that's exactly what he was deity in service or death. What's Paul? Deity in service to God or death. Jesus was deity in service or death to redeem the world. But what did the world do to it? They refused. They rejected. Why? Some of them, a big part of them did that because this because he did die. They said he couldn't be deity enough. The man, the body was not deity, but deity was in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This body has to perish. The very Christ that's in you is the only thing that can raise you up. That's deity. God in you. Now notice now the same as now they reject identified deity. Do you get it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will certainly put their name on a church book and say I'll try to live with this creed. They'll take an oath by this. But when it comes to accepting deity and expressing back the same kind of a gift like they did that you are identified by your gift that you give your entire being to it to identify deity. Then you identify yourself with the deity by giving all you are what you are to deity himself. Now Christ in this day that we now live in is still de identifying himself deity among the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's still deity because he is the word. &gt;&gt; And when we see the word living itself, then we know that man can do that. It's deity, the word being made manifest by man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus said himself, "The Son can do nothing in himself. I can't do nothing. I'm a man." Jesus said, "But my father that dwelleth in me, HE SHOWETH THEE ALL things that himself doeth." Amen. There you are. What is it? Deity being identified in man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the same thing is today that deity the promised word for this day can identify itself in you. Amen. Then give your whole to it. Show that you believe in it. Give it deity. Believe it. Service. Be ready to die onto yourself in your own thoughts. But today it's rejected as it was then. Notice God guided the magi with them gifts for practically two years. They followed that star. See, and that shows it couldn't be one of the natural things that happened. See, because if the stars crossing their orbits would have crossed, it would show there was something different because unless those magi saw it long time before it happened and know they had to cross that way, see then the path they were coming in and they crossed just at Bethlehem at that time started from up there beforehand knowing that these heavenly bodies were moving that way. Now God guided the magi because they had the right gift. God guided these wise men because they had the right identified gift to identify his son. &gt;&gt; Can you get it? &gt;&gt; Wise man today. Wise in the name of the Lord. not with some fictitious something but with the GIFT THAT GOD PROMISED FOR THIS DAY AND GOD WILL GUIDE you to identify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are. Wise man. God guided those gifts because they were the gifts to identify him. and wise man today who can look away from church entity and all the things of the world to the living word of God and God will identify his son by his word because that's what he is. I my father are one and in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the same word today he's the same yesterday today and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a wise man follows that because that's what God takes care OF TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF BY IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; A gift, a real identified gift of God, God brings up to everything like that TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF BY. AMEN. And that's how Christ was identified. By gold, my frankincense by damn man foreshadowing and showing in type what his life was to be. See deity manifested for service to die that he might redeem the nation because he was to save his people from their sin. Not save the world, save his people from their sin. The Bible say you're but and in his name will the Gentiles trust. &gt;&gt; The Gentiles will trust in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, the bride, the called out of the Gentiles will be trusting in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In his name shall the Gentiles trust. Now, God guided them for they were the gifts that they were giving were fitting to the time. Notice God said God has he he divided his word at the beginning in Genesis. I can take Genesis and show you every age in the Bible down to this age here. All the cults and things we had there. I can show you exactly where there was in Genesis. See, God gave his word so much here, so much here, so much here for each age. And then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and support the other that was coming. See, like the Messiah always supported every prophet in his own life, his own being, the word that was given for that day he come and fulfilled that written word and fortold of what the other was going to be &gt;&gt; and every one of them spoke of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he was the fullness. HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE PROPHETS. HE WAS THE WORD OF GOD. HE was the prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is. Notice how wonderful what he was. Each one of those prophets. Then when he comes, he was the fullness of all the prophets manifested because they were the word of the Lord. And he said himself, if you call those gods whom the word of God come to, how can you condemn me when I say I'm the son of God? &gt;&gt; Even those in that age was identified as gods. God called them himself gods. What were they? They were manifestations of his word. &gt;&gt; And here WAS HE THE FULLNESS of the word. Deity in body. &gt;&gt; Deity manifested in the flesh. What? For these gifts that these men brought. They couldn't have brought that to a prophet. Would have been right. See them gifts couldn't have went to Elijah. They couldn't have went to Moses. They had to come to him. And then those gifts were strictly meant for that day and was to identify who he was by these gifts. Then here come along and protected it and kept them two years down there until they found the perfect life. How fitting. Same thing today. We got people. This is loyal, nice people, genuine people. But you see in that there's going to be something come forth that God's always done to identify this day. This is the day when these things are spoken to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There won't be many, just a very, very few that'll be saved. The Bible said so. There'll be just a handful. Jesus said himself as it was in the days of Noah. We're in eight souls were saved. Eight souls. out of a a generation like into this as it was the days of Noah. What was it? Great cultured people, great workers, great builders, great everything as they had made civilization just like it. Great things that they had as it were in the days of Noah. So will it be in the coming of the son of man. See, God had Noah to identify his promised word. It was very fitting. The ark was fitting to the word of God that he spoke and he would destroy man. But he saved what he could. Now these wise men bringing their gifts identified their gifts identified what it was. And that's the reason God protected those gifts to every move that they made. He protected until they arrived with those gifts because they were fitting for the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does my church understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's going on now. I hope it ain't over your head. I have to speak it in parable almost. You see, but do you see it's the thing that's happening is fitting for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lady Gia, &gt;&gt; it's a fitting time. That's reason God has protected. See, brought it right through to identify himself gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though it cost a death and put a stomach block in their waist, it's a bending time. That's right. Fitting for the day. That's the reason God has protected the way he has. He will protect it until his purpose is served. &gt;&gt; Oh, I read a story come to my mind not long ago of something on that order. was in a great city here in this nation and New York and it was on Christmas Eve and there was a poor family little daddy he had TV and he was his wife had TV they had been underprivileged and he he kind of he's weakly and so nobody would hire him he had no education and he he people didn't want him he just as an outcast become a trance trust you know What a is just go by and pick up something and paddle it and get what they can. What little uh royalty they make on it. They try to live by just a like a peddler or something on the street. Go buy some pins and needles and thimbles and whatever they can and and take it and and maybe buy them for a penny a pack and sell them for a nickel and make four cents on the pack. Maybe in the run of a day that's a great commission. But just think all he sell in a day maybe make 20 30 cents a day and he had a family and the little wife being weakly she she died and it was coming Christmas time and the little girl she had developed from malnutrition not having the right food and things uh she took TV also and she had a little fella about eight nine years old 10 and she never had a dog for Christmas and that's what she wanted for a gift was a dog and the father not able to give her medical attention and so forth and he you seen the little girl was going fast and he tried his best to to to to get enough money together to get her a doll for Christmas if he could just get enough to buy her a little doll. And so the Christmas time was coming on. The bad weather set in. The little girl developed some kind of a pneumonia and and she died just a few weeks before Christmas. And the father of course brokenhearted went to his little tin can and got the money out and he thought of his little girl that she wanted a dog like little girl. See, it's a little mother coming on. You notice how a little girl she goes to the doll because she's that's her nature. She's a she's a coming mother. She will be mother someday she lives and everything nor nature. That's a little girl likes a little doll. She want take care of because after all she she's a little potentially a little mother and she wanted a little doll. She never had one. And daddy had saved everything he could to get her a little doll. And so she died and the father kind of had a lapse of mind. His wife had been taking the little girl and his mind kind of got to a place that he still he go to bed every night and talk to this little girl though she was been buried but he thought he he was talking to her and tell her now honey it won't be long. Daddy's going to get you this dolly for Christmas and daddy's promised you the dolly and I I'm I'm going to get it. Finally Christmas arrived. And of course you know how it is. The rich had their their big parties and the candles burning and the great high masses in the churches and talking about Jesus and and so forth. the churches were going through all kind of routines of mass and singing and carols and everything. Little did he know what was going on back in the alley behind all this. This uh little fella back there and he got beside himself. He wanted that little girl to have that dollar back cuz she had begged so for this little doll. So he went out and he bought her a little rag doll, a little uh little thing, probably about 30 cents, a little dirty something bought down on the side of the street. And it was a real cold night. the the blizzard winds are blowing, snow falling hard there in New York, down on the coast, the streets filling up and the people in their great big limousine, cars and drunken parties out drinking the celebration of the birth of Christ and of these things that we speak of tonight trying to think that that's the right way to do it is to drink off their old sorrows and things and that's that's the way to do it. call up stay in the store the other day and a woman talked about what two girls met who won't know what they got for their daddy and one of them said well she got him a carton of certain kind of cigarettes and the other said she got him a fifth of whiskey and a and a and a deck of car that ain't given a memorial gift for the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's way it goes you see it's just a big bunch of tinsel it hasn't got Christmas in it at all and so we find out this little man. He wandered along and he know his heart his little girl was gone, but he went and bought the doll anyhow. And he thought, I'll just start walking. I'll find her somewhere. She'll be along the street here and I'll find her. And he started walking. He he couldn't fool himself. She wasn't back there in a little shanty and in the little ragged dirty bed, but uh she was buried. So he he knew he thought he'd find her on the street. He said, "I'll just keep walking." And he's going down through the alleys while they were singing their carols and going on and going down the alley packing this little dirty doll holded in his coat up to his heart thinking of his little girl. And finally a policeman happened to see him and policeman had a few drinks himself and he run into the alley and grabbed the old man and turned him around. He said, "What are you doing hanging here?" He said, "I'm taking this little doll, sir, to my little girl." He said, "Where do you live?" And he told him, "Where you live?" He said, "Well, you're going away from that place. You're drunk. Go back the other way." He said, "Sir, I'm not drunk. I promise my little girl I' I'd get her a gift for Christmas." And said, "An appropriate gift for a little girl is a little doll." And he said, "Let me see it." So he showed him a little dirty rag doll is holding in his next to his bosom holding a little doll as he. So the policeman half drunk himself shoved him on and started down. The old man went down the alley. Snow falling fast and well the midnight parties broke up. The next morning the snow lit up. The sun had come out. So there was all the people from their great gay parties. eye sacks on their heads from too much drinking and celebration of the the birth of Christ and and many of them were forced and caring all from all the going on. But way down in the alley they found the old man and when he turned him over he had little doll next to his heart. I suppose he tuck his gift to him. He bound her in a way not here. &gt;&gt; Right. He he he tucked the gift. It was an appropriate gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God merciful. Yet it cost him his death. There's no other way in the world he could have given her the gift. She was buried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the only way he could do it would be go like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Little doll. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't mean too much. I guess a little dirty face doll. But it What did he do? It fulfilled a promise he had made. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what the people thought about it, his dirty hands and a little dirty doll, but it fulfilled a promise to his little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen.
