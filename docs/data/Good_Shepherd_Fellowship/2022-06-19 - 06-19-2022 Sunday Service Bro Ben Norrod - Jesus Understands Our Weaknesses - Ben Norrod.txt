[Music] as well [Music] foreign [Music] with me [Music] oh [Music] please amen let's stand together let's get right i just adored that i could listen to that all day long amen amen amen sure appreciate god's grace to us if you've got your bible this morning i'd like for you to turn with me if you could to the book of galatians now the lord helping us i want to speak to you this morning upon jesus understands our weaknesses jesus understands our weaknesses galatians chapter 2 we'll look at verse 20 the lord helping us galatians 2 verse 20. now uh as you're turning we're going to just look now at a little thought here the lord helping us upon what we are as christians and how we operate as christians how we function as christians and what i'm going to try to do if the lord will help me is i'm going to try to offer you a lot of liberty and deliverance and grace and to give you a little bit more of a reprieve from a legalistic mindset the lord will help me now i'm going to bend grace so so much that you may start thinking well this sounds like disgrace well i'm going to stay right in the bible with all of my limits and boundaries and limitations so you just remember that when i'm preaching this that this is not me saying live any way you want to live do anything you want to do act any way you want to act let me say right out the gate if that kind of thing is in your heart anyways to do anything you want to do if it's pleasing the lord displeasing doesn't matter well then in that regard you really don't have the baptism of the holy ghost like you might think you do because christians want to please the lord yes amen galatians chapter 2 verse 20. paul says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god amen do you notice he doesn't even live by his own faith that's right now i'm going to tell you right now if i had to live by my own faith heaven help me because sometimes today i want to be a christian tomorrow weekend after that yeah i feel amen praise the lord hallelujah two days after that wake up the next morning glory to god his mercy is new by the afternoon anybody know what i'm talking about that's what living by your faith looks like but living by his faith it doesn't matter if you're or you're just straight on through the course amen notice he says i do not frustrate the grace of god i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness came by the law come by the law then christ is dead in vain so for you that are standing here this morning you that might join on the internet or get this sermon later if in your opinion in order to be a genuine christian to be born again of the holy spirit the idea is you've got to live a life if that's the idea that you've got that you have got to live a life then you really don't even understand calvary in the first place figure y'all would react that way so i'm going to quote it now that i'm going to read it later it's not whether you live the life right i'm going to leave you hanging right there and then we'll talk a lot that's right let's pray together with the word thank you lord jesus thank you for your great message of the hour thank you for this great apostle paul this prophet of god who wrote to us eternal things lord jesus as we have this great spiritual book laying ahead of us and fathers the bible lays open here on this platform today i lord know that you said your letter would kill but the spirit would bring it life and so i pray that you would anoint and quicken every word of god that'll be spoken today use my mouth and my mind to be a instrument that you can use me for your glory and lord jesus anoint their hearts and minds that they might receive directly from the throne of god as we commit this to your hands both speaker and listener in the name of jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen god bless you you may be seated may the lord bless you really good now let's just get it all on the table while we got a chance to because i don't want you guessing for the rest of the service where i'm going there are two schools of thought in every type of movement be it even the buddhists islam christianity the catholics there's always two schools of thought when it comes to religion and that is the legal aside and the grace side now depending on how a group or a group of people would uh define the way that that that looks or what's said about that or how that is approached of course it might be a different thing i talk to many catholics some of the online teaching that i do i teach in poland to older people and business people and leaders and things of that nature and you know poland is predominantly a catholic country like 80 percent catholic they all take holidays during the catholic holidays and what more and some of them will tell me well there are practicing catholics that are very devout about their religion they are just strict when they don't eat they're not eating and we're not drinking they're not drinking and when they eat they're supposed to eat they eat and they're just right every letter of it and then there are those that believe within that movement that god has a lot of grace on people and you know if they slide by mass every now and then or you know or they just maybe not get to confessional right at that moment ah you know the lord understands and they just kind of keep moving along with their momentum of life and you know when they get around to it they get around to it and they practice their piety when they feel like it and hearing that of course you know being a message preacher one of the first things my mind goes to is the same kind of stuff that i've heard around our ranks there are those that are so spiritual and they're so religious and they're so pious for this message that they wouldn't even so much as even buy a chocolate bar after on on church on sunday and they are so spiritual and so high and so elevated in the things of god and many times people like that usually are no earthly good whatsoever their head or two heads too high in the clouds then you have the people that are like i don't hurt you it won't bother you you're a believer your name's on the book of life and god put it on the lamb's book of life and you know you can get away with this and get away with that now here's the amazing thing about both of these schools of thought there is truth in both sides of it and in order to balance the christian walk with god we have to learn where those balances lay and in order to really convey the message i want to convey to you this morning i'm going to use one word and that word is leniency looking at what paul said here in the book of galatians that 21st verse he said i do not frustrate the grace of god now that in itself gives us the indication that it is possible to frustrate god's grace to the point to where he wants to deal with you but then it also hints to us that there is a level of leniency and an amount of leniency that god gives to a person before he becomes frustrated and all of the fathers and the mothers this morning screamed hallelujah you're talking about me and my children for sure amen now you understand that to be a genuine christian there is an element of holiness that comes with our walk with god but i want you to think about the other side the legalistic side of holiness is something that is manufactured something that is built up by the person themselves and sisters please understand i'm going to pick on you just a little bit on account of the fact that you're the most visible out there but you know your hair and your dress and these type of things they are in place not because in order to do that you get a free pass into heaven but we do those things to be pleasing to the lord jesus as we know the bible taught us that a woman is supposed to have her hair a certain way men are supposed to have their hair a certain way and uh you know it's something that we follow not for the letter of the law so that we might gain favor with the lord but that we might show by our life that we love him that we're willing to do what he asked us to do in spite of all the persecution and all of the back and uh the back back biting and the backlashing and the uh all of those things that we go through just the terrible stuff sometimes that women in this day and age have to go through that choose to serve the lord you know i really feel for you sis because you're living in an environment where every store every gas station every mall every place you might go the women will look the complete opposite of you and yet the same time you hear come come to church like this and you hear a preacher saying oh you better live right or else or you better have that hair or else or you better not do or else and see i really feel that in the years that i've served the lord and preached that we have gotten so out of balance when it comes to those things and we hear brother branham of course just hammering away on the tapes at how people are supposed to live how they're supposed to behave but something we need to remember about the prophet's ministry is that brother branham was in an environment of all of these different denominations there was no message churches there was no message pastors there was no established message of the hour all they know is that this man from kentucky indiana william branham had come from a bad background that's got some gifts from the lord is preaching and establishing things from the bible in a way that was different from many other people but in his day and age in order to make all of the boundaries very clear brother branham had to get very very hard in order for you to know what a good woman looks like he had to so expose the bad till he got right down to being insulting he got offensive and he said things that a modern-day woman in 2022 just doesn't want to hear out of anybody's mouth much less a preacher a prophet of god and yet the real bride of jesus christ that can understand the purpose behind why brother branham chose to preach the way that he did the real sisters that catch the revelation of that of that part itself the behind back part of why he was doing it those are the ones that will join them on the other side beyond the curtain of time screaming and running our precious brother our precious brother so but the the idea amongst message people is that well if i live right i live clean i believe the message if i press play and obey well i've got it and friend here's where the misconception has come in and i dare say that for the last 60 years we have had so much confusion about what it means to look like a christian act like a christian walk like a christian we use all kinds of of of of proof and backing of what we believe a believer is you know i i'm wearing a beard and i have for some years now and when i've hot for years for years i always kept clean shaving because i heard preachers all the time preaching ah these men with these worldly beards and these men and i i just got to thank him one day where's that in the bible where did brother branham actually ever preach such things as that i found a few statements where he said that if jesus come to us in the 20th century he'd be in a three-piece business suit he'd be clean shaving standing there just like a normal person then a guy got onto me one time he said see there the prophet said he'd be clean shaven i said yes but you come to church in overhauls i want to see you sunday in your three-piece suit amen now what we've done is we've taken things in such a literal manner when brother branham was only trying to create a picture for us of what it's supposed to look like remember friends even though he was the messenger of god predestinated before the foundation of the world to reveal the secrets of god and the mysteries of god to you and i brother branham was not given the gift of micromanagement he was not given the gift of meddling and he was not given an anointing to go into your homes into your refrigerator amen into your into your place where you'll be hiding your tv or your christmas tree or any of the such life and try to accuse or get into your closet try to throw you in hell for every little thing that went on the prophet of god no no friend that's what we've done in this message well you can holler amen or just stare at me it's up to you but fair warning i'm coming on anyhow right i'm coming on with it anyways now and see even things like i mentioned christmas and every time i say that from the bible i can feel the jolts from people it's like lightning bolts oh god where is he going well that's the thing i am not called of god to drive by house to house if i was a pastor and i had a local assembly i wouldn't want to get out on christmas tribe and go straight by street by street to figure out okay are there blinking lights in the corners of those curtains uh ask the wife uh sam do you see is there a blue or red is it reflecting through the windows get your notes ready take notes we got to figure out who we're going to preach against on sunday but you see the bible said that you are to work out your salvation with fear and trembling the message of the hour was not designed to meddle into every detail of a man or woman's life come on preach to me a little while amen this is why friends that when you start reading the message and the bible for that matter there are certain things that are silent in the scripture for example i've lost count of the times that young men and married men and women will come to me and talk to me about relationship type things that go on in the bedroom and they'll ask for scriptures they'll ask for quotes they'll ask for evidence and proofs of how a man or woman is supposed to behave sexually one to another do you ever notice that very little has been wrote in the bible or in the message about those very things do you know why because god will leave it up to you and your wife how that you decide to express yourself one to another and those that have clean minds oh that have clean hands the holy ghost will lead you in what goes on behind your bedroom door amen brother ben preach i think i will it's not the pastor's job it's not the evangelist job it wasn't brother branham's job it's nobody's job but your own to figure those kind of things out now there are certain things if it's crude and rude and obvious then you know in your own conscience whether you're crossing lines or not and don't act stupid like you don't know what i'm talking about you do you understand it i'm in a room full of adult people for the most part and you say oh god oh god don't say that in front of our young people these men up here probably know these girls probably know more about it than you do praise the lord that's right because they've been exposed to more through the telephone through the internet than we ever experienced some of the things that my daughters are challenged with through tick tock and instagram and all of the things you see in social media and youtube and what more it absolutely completely baffles my mind that the generation of young people we've got in this message today they are confronted and exposed with every imaginable thing under the sun it's hard to believe that some of the things my girls have already been exposed to and the middle one just turned 13. and yet she's got friends suicidal that cut themselves that are hooked on drugs that's already been in juvenile jail and they're not even out of the seventh grade people the world as we are living in it today is completely different than when you were growing up and it's different from when brother branham was coming up that's why there are elements of this message that remain between you and almighty god and you can see that attitude whenever they start talking to brother branham brother branham is it all right if a woman wears pajamas to bed can i shave my legs brother turn around hand the thing to billy paul did you see that well they can ask some burners can't they you see and this is the reason why brother branham didn't spend time you never hear him start out all right i'm going to get you all together here at the tabernacle and we're going to start a sermon series on these ungodly jezebels plucking their eyebrows you never find the prophet of god going to extremes to identify such things as that why he trusted that if you got the main part down and the main elements of the holy ghost and the revelation that jesus would lead you in all the rest of it [Applause] but be careful to sweep your own steps keep your broom off mine you ain't got no business on my steps and i ain't got no business on your steps come on preach me a little while you sweep your steps i'll sweep mine [Music] amen you go to some churches and the women are not allowed to wear any jewelry you go to some churches they better not have an open-toed shoe or you'll wind up in hell you know what the problem is people are trying to bring you into the holy ghost via legalism you know what i found that if a man or woman gets truly born again god will tell them whether the thing is right or not i i'm gonna pick on jordan for five seconds but his shirt reminds me of an experience i had i used to have one of the flowery types thing i like those now this is nice i'm not i'm not throwing off on that shirt but years ago i'm talking about like 1991. my mother had bought me a set of shirts like that and that particular time they were all the rage very very popular and i'd wear that thing and i'd feel so condemned i wouldn't even know how to think about it because of course back then we were taught in the message that a man wasn't even allowed to wear a colored shirt to the pulpit you african saints would be absolutely in trouble [Music] because you know our stupid ignorant intelligent brilliant americans we have been preaching our pentecostal apostolic tommy rod for 60 years now and i can't think of an african church going back a hundred years that ain't dressed in bright colors when the prophet has the vision of the bride they were all in their national garb he said colors and everything like that y'all getting quiet but here we come you realize this is why if we're not careful we will form our own doctrines of holiness and start sweeping everybody's steps off instead of leading them to jesus and letting him do the work we have an expression catch the fish before you clean it that's right amen but the problem is is that we have because of such exposure in the message of the hour we have such a knowledge of what the prophet said and of course when it comes to length of dress if a woman had did not have her dress plumbed to the ground where she's stepping on it somehow she's a sinner until you see a picture of brother branham's daughters and his wife and their dress came just below their knees standing in sitting well hallelujah oh but men and women better cover up yeah especially from you because you got that old spirit on you you heathen you a lot of times when you got men standing there blasted at the women like that to stop dressing sexy to stop looking this way that way it's because old boy's got a problem and not you [Music] amen right a real son of god doesn't have to worry amen about the women walk in this world amen it's got the power of god down inside of his heart that gives him the understanding of how to live and how to act some men are so filthy some boys are so filthy they lust after a dress hanging on a fencepost that's in their heart so anything they see their goal women you better not curl your hair you better not you better not why she's a woman it's what she wants to do she's made and built to want to look pretty sis if you're going to haul a man now's your time right now i will go on record quickly and say if any of the brothers want to curl their hair and look pretty i'm having a prayer line expeditiously at the end of this service right it's not built into the men them with their shorts on but the rest of those sickly knees knocking together amen but a woman is designed in a different way she's made to where she wants to look beautiful the prophet said your beauty was given to you for your mate so you know how it is of course if a woman doesn't have the flattest of shoes that jesse bell i eyeballed it she had an inch heel on her foot heels in the house of god and you don't even know why the heels are bad right the reason the prophet's mother had the dream and he used it was because the heels were getting so tall that they were contorting the shape of the woman making her rear and her breast stick out when your heel gets that high get rid of that heel [Applause] amen oh but see here comes the holiness police i can feel him i can feel him oh my god did you just get through saying that a woman could wear a heel i just said the holy ghost will lead you on what's decent and what's not it ain't my job a woman told my wife some years ago that you're a married woman you ought to put your hair up on top of your head you know you couldn't wear your hair down just kept on kept on kept on until i finally got enough of it i said to her i said tell her this next time next time she says to you how to wear your hair you let her know that your husband likes that hair down [Applause] and you know what that's all that really matters if it's not offending the lord because you see her hair don't belong to her anymore the bible said it's mine uh-huh you are reading the bible right paul said the woman's body becomes his and his becomes her so she don't own her hair anymore i own it all of it is mine i reckon that gives me a right to have an opinion on what i like praise the lord right but notice the idea becomes that we as message people have got to strike a standard yes we need to strike a standard and provide an example but not based on man-made ideas this is why people get so tripped up at christmas time we know that christmas is a pagan holiday but deny me one holiday that ain't pagan name them i'm waiting on you a hot february valentine's day uh-huh oh you sister like him flowers don't you some of you all anti-christmas people in here i wouldn't have one of them devil eye dollar trees i wouldn't talk about i wouldn't go see lies i'll hide in a cave on the 25th of december but when the 14th of february comes along how do i love feet let me count the waves brother everything we look at is pagan but the holy ghost leads you on what is right and what is wrong why do you think brother had a tree because brother branham wasn't only stinking legalists that made everything the devil and you can tell by the lack of amens in this church i'm right where i need to be [Applause] right and we're scared to even holler at men about this kind of stuff all right be careful now you punch some of you men and probably punch in your wife be careful don't tell on us don't say nothing don't you blink your eyes this church will know we got a treat and that treatment in that attic i like christmas now and i want my presence i want my goats you know i don't like anything going on and there's how don't you let nobody know it hide it in the name of jesus hide it and yet when it comes to salvation look at how some of our children have been raised in this country they've come up hating the message of the hour because we have so grieved them with our legalistic ideas from the message of the hour i know what brother banham said that anybody that celebrates this much attention will burn with it but he also come to the tabernacle and thanked him for their christmas gift that they gave him every year a brand new suit of color of clothes yes well maybe didn't know this but while i'm here i'm going to build a few tabernacles brother branham used to like to go from house to house every year and see the christmas trees and how they'd been decorated in the saints house sure y'all didn't know that did you i can hear legalistic bubbles [Laughter] now remember the idea that i'm trying to show you is that in christianity it is not about a rule of do or don't a child of god knows when something is right and when something is wrong come on somebody help me this morning right this is why paul said i do not frustrate the grace of god he said not all things are lawful not all things are expedient but i serve the lord on the dictates of my old conscience [Music] the only thing he cautioned us against was to watch your example before weaker believers younger men and women that have not established themselves yet and they can study and read and sin they don't know how to balance things you need to watch your example don't be cavalier when it comes to how you live to some brand new believer oh that won't bother you that maybe it will leave them alone and let them learn how to do it just like you learned how to do it right you look at the critics when believe the sign rod bergen jeremy and all the rest of them and john collins and the bunch started out with their websites and they started attacking this message you can hear john call and say how that they said they believe the message but every time in halloween you can see the light flickering from where they were watching their televisions in the basement too holy to people going trick-or-treating but not holy enough for a television don't you understand these broken people that are projecting to the believers of this message that those are the things that drove them out it was not it wasn't a television that caused a man or woman to fall it wasn't halloween or christmas that caused in the fall it was a false revelation and understanding of how a christian can conduct himself with freedom and liberty and yet remain holy all the days of their life you know who i blame by the one preachers we have preached according to our own agendas we have preached according to what we think will please the people we've tried to tickle their ear and get the offerings bigger and yet we have failed to preach where they're living at if god gives me grace the next 31 years i've got on this earth if god give it i want to preach to you and where you're at [Applause] who in here don't know the revelation of the hour who in here doesn't understand the son of man we all understand water baptism and the wonders of the godhead but whether or not you're allowed to wear a certain thing or not that's where you get tripped up at and you start looking for answers so you go to one person they'll tell you about some spiritual dream they had one time i said sister tell samantha that's one time she was looking at a christmas tree and the spirit of the lord spoke to her see that's where it gets your attention right god spoke to you it's nothing but a painted i even heard some amens just then but that's all right to feel like that if you want to feel like that but before you start throwing people in hell don't forget your prophet had a tree in the house and presence in the car when he got hit on the armadillo highway in texas right before he died i'll just let you amen that a while the idea is not to get so caught up in the legalistic notion that your works are going to make you have a spot in heaven or in the rapture of the resurrection legalism never produced a birth from the word that's why jesus come y'all amen that's why jesus go paul just got through saying it right here he said if righteousness came by the law then christ died in vain no man can live the truth every word no woman can live it to every letter it took jesus christ amen to put us in a condition where we can live this gospel 1 000 [Music] you can't live it of yourself it takes the lord to get you there well i did have friends and here i can hear the facebook unlike block unlike unfriended amen well that's all right if they unfriend me maybe some of you will friend me back the point i'm making is not whether it's right or wrong the point is we've taken our ideas and made doctrines out of them do you wonder there's a reason why the bible said as for me and my house in other words other houses ain't my business do you know the only time the scripture actually records that we're to be concerned about what somebody else is into is if you see them overtaken by it if your brother becomes overtaken in a fault then you that are spiritual go and restore such a one to the lord outside of that we don't need measuring tape when we come to church how long was her dress a dress is awful long because them heels are even longer they keep notes upon what they think is righteous and not righteous you can feel the oxygen sucking out of the air on these remarks because you know you're guilty you're just like when i preached it in kentucky and indiana you like it when i preached over in arkansas you're just the same type of people as everybody else i preach this to so we might as well just go ahead and repent say lord i'm sorry i'm guilty i've messed up you're right i'm wrong thank you jesus moving on right just that simple notice the quality of that god he he exhibits to us a leniency which is a fact or quality of being more merciful and tolerant than what we expect because you see we have been trained to believe that god is a just god and we've also kind of played off that a little bit so whenever our children start doing things wrong we try to threaten them with hell you better live right you better do right you don't want to wind up in hell do you why why do we always go with the negative road why don't we look at our children and say you know how much jesus really loves you do you know he loves you so much that he wants you to do the right thing and he's throwing everything in your pathway to help you do the right thing i i told my middle daughter just the other day about the little story about the shepherd breaking the sheep's leg remember when he went over to palestine he saw him carrying up on his shoulders like that and he said you broke his leg he said oh you're a mean shepherd he said no no he said you don't understand he said i am a real shepherd and i love this little sheep up on my shoulders and that broken leg may look bad to you but those wolves and those lions and those bears are way worse of a result than what you're seeing right here and i put it on my shoulders and broke its leg so i could train it to my voice hallelujah that it can learn to love me and listen to me and obey me so it won't run off the next time but we spend so much time threatening people preachers you hear them do that you better don't you say a word about this message let me tell you something boy if they're not predestinated to see it they're going to talk anyways no matter what you say or how you say it and truthfully if we presented the message of the hour in a manner in which it could be embraced and loved and appreciated if we didn't always try to act like a bunch of weirdos people could probably embrace this message a little quicker but we are guilty in this message of doing the very thing brother brown told us not to do don't make yourself odd don't make yourself strange don't try to be super spiritual just live a simple christian humble life come on somebody help me this morning right but on the other side of that coin somebody said to me that's the problem with the message of the hour you message people a bunch of adulterers and liars and thieves and i said you mean the baptist ain't got them i don't know if you saw this it was national news but just just the other day they had a baptist convention in tennessee and it turns out imagine this that in a church organization like the baptist the president is up for charges of multiple manifold underage molestations and a few of his aides and other people are being investigated as well because of molestation almost to the catholic level that's the baptist i'm referring to um you ever studied on the history of walmart no anybody ever study on the history of another organization if i ever look into a bank how it got started or look into a certain business how they got started would anybody like to talk about mcdonald's anybody would like to go back and find out how mcdonald's actually was stolen from the original mcdonald brothers y'all are looking at me like a mule staring at a new gate because you know where i'm going what i'm saying to you is it doesn't matter wherever moves at we've got problems everywhere we turn around so we can't turn around blame this message for child molesters and rapists and thieves and adulterers and all kinds of things we can't blame the message that's not what brother branham preached to us the people are people i don't care what room or what what place they're in right and until they get born again they'll use anything for an excuse to do what they want to do and live how they want to live brother if you don't think so all you got to do is just start studying some people that's right go back and look at some of the greatest hockey coaches that you've ever seen i'm in minnesota so i'm going to talk about your sport go back and look at some of the greatest hockey teams and go back and look at the miracle and all the other things and then start digging down to find out what was going on in some of them people's lives while they were performing the miracle you'll never find anywhere in any movement i don't care what it is being a sport be business be a church where everybody walks perfectly because without christ it is impossible [Music] amen praise the lord well some of y'all ain't falling off the wagon yet so i guess i'm doing pretty good let's move on now notice this paul's saying i do not frustrate the grace of god now i see two things in this remark first of all i see paul in his own dispensation pointing at the jews and seeing how that they frustrated god with their rituals ceremonies even the lord said it's become a stink in my nostrils all your feasts and your new moons and your keeping of sabbas and the washing of pots and pans and this and that he said it's become a stink in my nostril he said your lips say great things but your heart is far from me [Music] and that's very telling if you'll pay attention to it because god don't want you just performing an act of religious osity he wants your heart behind what you're doing and brother even if you're not doing it completely right sister even if you're not a hundred percent if your heart's behind it jesus is all behind you [Music] now see that was positive that was encouraging i'm not just being a bully and being mean now watch this in second peter chapter 3 verse 8 8-9 you love the bible me too but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day now in the whole of your existence on this earth i'm 45 years old uh sister naomi's 25 years old sam is 19. uh you brothers are probably what in your 60s 50s 60s something like that come on brother but in the lifetime of even the oldest human being what was it 119 years i think in china in a span of 119 years what do you think that really looks like to a god that goes through seven church ages looks down at his watch after the white throne and goes what a week that was comes to the end of a thousand years and says wow what a day you see when you look at it in its proper scale then that five or six minute mistake or that week-long fight you had with your husband or wife or that six-month battle you've had with your kids or whatever it may be or that besetting sin that's been knocking you around for 15 years or so in the eyes of a god who a thousand years is like a day is it really that big of a deal compared to how we look at it to him it really is not that big of a deal but now we treat sin and we treat it in a certain manner that's actually not in the characteristic of how god looks at it i know god is holy he's so pure he's so holy he's so righteous the least little thing will disturb yes all of that is true but don't forget to flip your coin over and preach the other side too that the very same god that hates and abhors sin and even the least little thing will grieve his heart was the same god that let man go for nearly two thousand years to the analuvian destruction and came after 2000 years and said you know what it grieves me i cries what the meaning of that word was i cry in my heart that i even made man for him to fall in this mess in the first place and yet god still had such leniency on humanity that he gave him a chance to get from one spot to another 2000 years just trace it from the time of abraham god hates sin but that very same prophet not only lied before his name changed but after it not only was he a liar in those moments like that but his boy did the same thing and guess what that followed his family because grandkids done the same this grandma's son done the same thing go back and read your bible that was a strain that fear thing that followed down through them that people-pleasing type thing wanting everybody to like them type thing getting under pressure and wanting people to think that there's somebody or something or whatever it may be and abraham says she's my sister he probably thought oh that was a good one i can get out of that she's half but god knew the nature of his prophet so god was not doing this to be mean to abraham he was training abraham he gives a vision to the king that night a dream and in this dream he tells him you're as good as a dead man and the man begins arguing with god lord or pleading with god lord jesus could you imagine what it must be like to do something that you think was the most honorable thing you could have done and almighty god wake you up in the middle of the night and say you committed a horrible mistake but watch god's grace did not she tell me did not he tell me she was his sister do you know the integrity of my heart he said i know the integrity of your heart that's why i wouldn't permit you to sin against me but that man is my prophet and you have him pray for you or your whole nation's gone [Music] now watch the grace of god was not dealing with abraham in an avenue of meanness nor cruelty but he knew the nature of his very son and he understood the weakness that abraham had in that family oh god this is as fresh as big bread amen he understood the weakness that laid in that family so what do you make abraham do go face it cause him right up to the throne room you told me a lie oh i imagine by this time abraham was going uh i i i i i i'm the king here god woke me up in a dream and told me what you did amen all right abraham let's see you run now boy god didn't throw this man in hell because he made a mistake god didn't persecute him because he made a mistake he just trained him how to walk better so one year with the lord or a thousand years rather is like a day and the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is short-tempered mean-spirited aggravated impatient [Music] really so you mean he doesn't get mad at us over every little thing that goes on [Music] he is [Music] amen oh listen to us words now you see the rest of the world they don't have a dog in the fight if they're not serving him and they're not in the service of the lord then it's not really a matter of whether he's long suffering or not humanity is humanity and they're just going to do what they're going to do he has no obligation to those that will not perform by faith right he's not willing that really should perish and yet in the message we throw everybody in hell that don't agree with us amen well i don't like the way that guy operates i don't like what he does i don't like well maybe he don't like you don't ever think on the other side of it maybe he don't like you either so now you're in a real fix huh so what are you going to do well i bless him out then he smacks you in the mouth then you come back with a baseball bat and break his kneecaps then he comes back with a with a machete sword and cuts your arms off and then that grandkid comes by with a tank where does it end at some point as god's people we have got to learn how to forgive and show leniency one to another amen praise the lord right you can't hold hard feelings in your heart toward no one and make the rapture a resurrection you can't do it friend bitterness and having an attitude and having those things against people you don't like that'll get you kicked out of the kingdom quicker than anything you can count on one hand [Music] right y'all don't forgot how to say amen can i help you okay lower the jaw this is called a voiced sound a man i know you were doing as a voiceless sound you know i could hear all that going on but you need a voice today man you got to make your voice box work god wants to hear you say it boy you can shout at the seals you can shout at the thunders shout elijah the prophet love your brother [Music] see this is what i'm talking about but we put ourselves in such a condition to where we feel like god will not be lenient with us while we're learning but if a thousand years is like a day then in my 75 year lifetime or 70-year lifetime 20 school a three three score and ten if my lifetime i produce one mistake after another but yet the whole time i'm trying to serve the lord in that 70-year span how much of that you think god is keeping a record of and saying okay this is the 400th time i've had to speak with him about that matter i've had to speak with this girl 3 375 times y'all just don't understand the blood of jesus if you got that idea because you see when you repent of it make it right it goes into the blood you are forgiven as though it never happened then the next time you do it it's as though it was the earth first time now don't omit the responsibility that comes with your mistakes if you sow one sin you'll reap a whole washtub fool right but not because god's trying to be mean to you but maybe he's trying to teach you a lesson because he knows how you are and he knows how i am glory to god now watch us in james chapter five verse seven y'all doing all right so yeah anybody need to take a break for a heart pill or an insulin shot or blood pressure pill or okay james five and seven be patient therefore brethren so who is he talking to saints of god behold the husband waited for the precious fruit of the earth boy paul and james and these guys they all had a good way of putting things didn't they and have long patience so you see the lord jesus is not short fused even though brother banham said sometimes he gets so mad at us he feels like kicking us that's when we begin to frustrate the grace of god do you realize that the only time you'll ever get a weapon from the lord is when your behavior demands that he needs to take care of you some people just whip their kids for the fun of it i think that's one reason they go to walmart just to whip their youngins it's all you hear all over the whole place but the very idea of god giving us a whipping is not when we're trying to walk right let us when we refuse to keep walking or refuse to keep trying there's one thing god always hated was a quitter he loves a hero but he hates a quitter [Music] amen until he received the early and the latter rain now now we're in the seasons we're coming up through the road up here i was watching they were watering the crops and they're about yay high certain places around here same in tennessee they're starting to come up a little bit but could you imagine what it must be take a psychologist or somebody that understands the human mind and put them at the roadside and let that farmer plant his first i don't know three or four hundred seeds in the ground he's got it all tilled up he's got all the right nitrogen and things in the ground it's exactly as it needs to be and then watch him get out there and walk up and down after he puts his seeds in and then start running up down the road and throwing his arms around acting like a crazy guy said why are you growing up yet let some psychologists on the side of the road see that happening and they will put one of them funny little beautiful colored white jackets around him that he hugs himself and he'll go to a rubber room because anybody that knows anything about nature knows you've got a planet and then you got to wait for it well look at all them pretty amens coming out of your mouth but isn't that amazing you'll give grace to a seed out here in a in a bunch of a bunch of dirt but you don't give yourself that mercy you throw yourself in hell over a little thing that moves well i'm stupid i'm dumb and i'm ignorant i'll never amount to nothing and who said that about you what scripture what verse where did the prophet teach that when the seals come open was that with them special revelations i never heard about no that's us doing that to us some message it was communicated from mother or father or somebody up the line or some uncle or some little experience you had that tainted you and left a mark on you to make you feel that way but the word doesn't talk that way about his bride amen now if you do something stupid the preacher looks and said that was the stupidest thing he's talking about your humanity not your soul because humans can be quite dumb go ahead and say man just just that'll suffice just do that we can do the dumbest things on the face of life come on preach me a little while we can make the most rotten decisions that could ever be made we can choose to do things to get in the middle of stuff we know that we shouldn't have done it we did it anyway so what does the lord do i just scrap the whole thing throw it away it's no good well it depends on how you respond to the correction and here's where it gets good y'all just letting you know if you respond well to the correction there's all kinds of grace that comes with that if you don't respond well to the correction well then that's another story if you've got an attitude or you're hard-headed or whatever you are that's usually where you start hearing them belt loops and heaven go on you know sometimes have you been serving the lord for a period of time you can you feel it when you're about to get it you know that you haven't been living like you should you know you've been fooling around with things and saying things or doing things you shouldn't do and you could almost feel daddy standing in the corner looking around the side of the wall i'm going to get you if you don't knock it off that's right but jesus doesn't make us live our lives that way we live our life with leniency until we frustrate his grace and then he deals with us i understand god has never ever ever ever ever wanted to punish his children never that's not in his nature punishment doesn't belong to the children of god correction belongs to the children of god he didn't say every son that comes to god shall be punished first no that's a catholic idea trying to find peace with god martin luther ran around laid in the snow and uh froze himself to death and would beat himself until he was almost completely uh drained of all the blood in his body if the monks and other people who loved him had been standing by that man he'd been dead trying to find peace with god until one day a revelation hit his heart that the just shall live by faith hallelujah when god revealed it wasn't my faith that keeps me here but the faith of god is what keeps me going [Music] cause there are times i don't have enough faith in myself to get to church when i lose my faith remember your faith has an expiration date on it it has a weakness built into it where you can only believe god for so long and that's where if god ain't living in your heart and god's faith ain't living in you you'll fizzle out just as sure as there's a a backslider to be now notice paul in 2nd corinthians chapter 10 verse 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee lord my eyes but oh lord you know please god please paul knock it off it's not going to hinder your purpose i'll see to it that you are able to do the job you did yeah now while paul was going through that i'm sure he was quite grieved you know he probably remembers what it was like to have good strong eyes and could read the the torah and and and look at the documents that was written by holy men and study the bible and go through all the great things of god and then he comes to writing the new testament his whole life is turned upside down now he has to write with large letters because the swelling would get into his eyes and he couldn't see well enough to see what he was writing but he said it was given to me like a messenger of satan to buff at me [Music] god didn't do it to be mean to paul he did it because he knew how the man was he understood his weaknesses and he worked with him according to his weaknesses did you ever stop to think the very thing you cry for god to take away from you is the only thing keeping you saved yes [Music] praise god some of them things you ask god to take away from you that's one of the very things that keep you humble and on your knees asking god for mercy every day of your life and the lord is intelligent enough i could be so bold to say it this way intelligent enough to know if he took it away from you you'd be nothing but an absolute sludge of goo you give up you quit you wouldn't pray no more oh here come the angels not me i'm a believer i will always pray i will always yes and you'll always run that mouth too won't you till you learn your lesson that's right [Music] amen right because we are not as big as we think we are you let some guy coming out here i mean he got muscles bulging out of his eyeballs nearly you know and just let cancer strike his body some of these big handsome guys you know models and things that walk around tough guys can lick up the uh the back end of trucks and everything else like that and then take him individuals and let some things strike his body my sister-in-law who's a respiratory therapist my brother's wife told me the multitude of people that would come through in ohio with covet up there strong men firefighters and athletes and everything else be strong as they can be and that disease hit their body and within hours some of them are laying completely and totally helplessly dead so we try to walk around like well glory to god i'm a believer in this message and then amazing how arrogant we've become i am a believer not because of my faith and not because of my choosing and not because i desired it and not because i wanted it but i'm a believer because god wanted me to be a believer and god had confidence in me and god made the choice for me come on preach to me now and god's the one that'll see fit every hour every day every moment of my life to make sure i'm living in the faith and walking on that road to heaven even in the message we put your choice your choice let me tell you about your choice your choice was just enough of an open door for god to jam his foot in there and take over and do the rest of the business because this is what your choice looks like we come here after church uh where would you all like to go eat let's go eat mexican i ain't gonna eat mexican i want chinese i've ate mexican four days this week i don't want chinese i've been eating chinese for lunch ever i want to have this i want to get some fufu [Music] before you get to the front door of the restaurant you want to go to you've done changed your mind and made a different choice ah somebody preached to me your choices i have enough power in it to keep you safe god is the one that did the choosing for me god is the one that brought me into this hallelujah hallelujah and without his grace without his mercy i would never survive another day of my life most gladly therefore paul said i will glory in my infirmities yes i'll take pleasure in reproaches in necessities in persecution in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong hallelujah and praise the lord it proves something to us it proves that we're not as smart as we think we are you see friends this is where saul got to this is why the anointing left this man the bible said he got big in his own sight he got to thinking look at my kingdom that's what happened to nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar was a tool in the hand of god the prophet said he actually had a very soft heart that god could deal with and the lord anointed this man to put israel in bondage as a tool to make them pay for the rejection of christ's word remember when they were laying underneath every green tree playing the part of a harlot that he had to put him away in divorce and he set him out there for 70 years and nebuchadnezzar standing on the bow amen on the landscape looking across his kingdom he became uplifted and thought i've done some big stuff around here and the lord said you have have you well let's see how big you are when your nails are grown out like a and your hair is grown out like a and you're down with the rest of the i'll just let you fill in the blanks there because we've all been in them places that's right right the moment we begin to think that we can accomplish anything at all that's the moment you start backsliding hey man oh i hope this is all right brother here i am i'm not trying to meddle you have a job i have a job but i'm just preaching you're no different from anybody else i've been preaching this everywhere i go because i think the people of god need to hear these kind of sermons like this would you agree with me [Music] [Applause] praise the lord jesus amen i've got to burn i want to i want our young men and women to understand that this message is more than a rule book we follow it's a life it's a lifestyle and let me tell you if the gays and all the rest of them can have their lifestyle so can the bride of jesus christ have a lifestyle of service to the lord amen a life to live for jesus christ a life to live in the presence of god amen it's not just my ritual to read the bible i do it because it's a part of my lifestyle amen listen to this at the message adoption now the prophet says how can you preach predestination of god for ordaining and setting now this is an old country expression meaning positioning of the bride uh like an old hen will set and they'll say well what's the hint she's setting brother i'm using this for the for the position of the bride the foundation the forward running excuse me the predestination and the setting of the position unless there's a sin atonement somewhere so folks run around you got to know your position you got to know you're the bride you've got to find your place how can you preach that and not preach the sin atonement that goes with that because the very people we hear being preached to in this day and every message they preach is one of these big one-liners you're the bride you're the elect you're going in the rapture them very same people they're preaching to many times winds up in my meeting a month later and they're even more defeated than they was when they were shouting and running these other big campaigns you know why because when the dust settled down they found out they were still a human being that needed training on how to be a christian that's right me screaming up here to you you're the bride i know your position know how you that doesn't help you get there i've got to train you as a god-called man to show you how to live that life you say ain't none of your business i'll have you know the prophet of god sending spoken words original seed that you can only serve god as god's servants interpret the word to you so yes sir i have a responsibility as a ministry i have a responsibility as a god-called man to teach the people how to become the kind of people that can serve the lord when they don't feel it inside the lord when all the chips are down and silent when everything is looking bleak we need that great emotional campaigns and getting people to an altar and shouting and screaming and falling in the floor that is wonderful it serves a purpose but when your feet hit them floor and you the floor and you are face to face with the devil you better have more than a chill down your back to know how to make that kind of life but it says why is it each day you make a mistake each day you do wrong now for all of you of an angelic quality here this morning i dismiss you from the rest of these quotes and all the humans that would like to remain please stay put for the rest of the story amen i'd have stood up too but i'm standing oh i am standing so i guess that counts too don't notice brother man says but if you're born again a man or woman as soon as you make that mistake god knows you're sorry for it you know he doesn't even wait for you to say you're sorry not according to this quote here the moment you do the wrong that moment god already knows you're sorry for it now if he is the word hebrews 4 12 a deserter of the thoughts and the intents of the heart not only does he know my thoughts about matters and how i'm thinking and the confusions and the complexes and the fears and all that goes with those things the positives and whatever more might be associated but he also knows my intention he knows that that certain thing may pull on my flesh and i may be weak to that and in a certain period of time as a human i may even want to do that but the intention of my heart is god i want to be right god i want to get victory over that i want to find a way that i can get liberty from it and god knows the intention of your heart amen the moment you say i am sorry god already knew that you were sorry for the thing that you were talking about you notice he says that sins s-i-n-s a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sin now some of y'all wouldn't say it when i said it now brother branham's saying it so where are you at now i can't be a message believer you'll be able to say man to this quote the church commits sins i'm looking for a bride without spot or wrinkle and how does she get there the bleach that's why there's an unlimited supply of bleach you know how it is sisters whenever you hit a spot and you you know you're trying to get your clothes clean your house clean and all these kind of things and you'll be running around all of a sudden you go to the wash and you go to ah phooey i'm out of cleaner but you know there's never been a time that i've ever went to his fountain filled with blood that i've ever said fool yet it's empty i better run to the store i better run back to church i better run back and find that evangelist or find that camp meeting no every time i've went to the throne under the fountain of god's blood it has always been full of the blessing and the thank you cleansing all i got to do is just dip but the church does wrong i'm just waiting for you you say we get it move on yes that's fine but i want you to say amen to it first yeah don't shoot don't speed past these little things like i don't just get it all over and get to the punch line oh no no no no and here's where the good eating's at i'm not getting past that to that scarecrow this is where we are so defeated you look at your life even this morning some of you may be looking in the mirror and thinking i am the worst i can never do anything right i just mess everything up i touch how does god feel about you though right has anybody this morning received a sickness unto death because of your behavior anybody an angel of the lord come to you this morning and strike you on the head with a sword and say i'm done with you no has the lord stepped into your living room pointed his finger in your face and looked at you in your beady little eyes and said you are done i'm done with you i want nothing else to do anybody your liberty to speak really how many of you prayed to him this morning i asked him to help you did you what was the answer what was the message i forget it huh you mean the lord is still just listening and monitoring and paying attention hallelujah why does he shine he's giving you an opportunity to figure it out do you ever notice that the first time you do something wrong as a new christian it's like this church is sitting on your heart you feel so bad about it it just grieves you so deeply but then the next time it comes around it ain't like that and many times you'll look back on your life the very first things that god checked you on and made you feel that way those things have repeated themselves in your life but you haven't felt it that same way do you know why because he made his will known to you in the beginning that that wasn't pleasing to him and then he took the ball and pitched it to you and said your turn now you figure it out amen y'all have an amen tape made up in this church for moments like this feel free to press play and obey i know i'm a smart like i know i know i don't mean to be a smart like but i guess i am sometimes but watch us the church commits sin does wrong gets the wrong thought makes a wrong impression have you ever got the wrong impression about someone somebody tell you a bunch of stuff about this or that or somebody say or maybe maybe somebody having a bad day and they just acted a little off and then you got a wrong impression about them this person could turn out to be your absolute best friend in the whole wide world but you as a human allowed something to penetrate your mind that give you the wrong impression about the person that's amazing me as a preacher people tell me things all the time about you know i never thought you were like this i never dreamed you was easy going i listened to you preach i never dreamed you was as carefree as you are some people look at me they don't think i know how to laugh because they hear me preach and i'm taking that sword cut and coming and going and then they tell a joke i've literally had him apologize for telling a joke in my presence what are you apologizing for well you're a servant of god i'm not going to kill you for it i'm going to laugh at i thought it was funny what is that wrong impressions and they never pick up the phone to call you and tell you what they're thinking they never say you know brother we need to discuss her sister we need to talk about uh sir i'm just been battling and i they never do that right you ever notice that but everybody knows how to put it on facebook somehow it always leaks you know it leeches into the instagram posts and into their tick tocks amen but that's human beings brother and said they make scruples wobbles now i'm sure in africa they don't use this terminology but that just basically means that you don't how you're not walking correctly this is old kentucky english right here i'm sure like a little child walking trying to learn how to walk he just don't know how to walk good yet right because he's a little boy but we have a hand that reaches down glory to god and gets us and studies us and says make the step this away son he doesn't pick us up and spank us because we've made a mistake he doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk he loves us like we love our children now you take some of these little kids like you take when my jessica was a baby and she was learning how to walk and she'd wobble and stumble and crash and burn now if i'm a real daddy i don't look at that baby so you are the stupidest baby i've ever laid my eyes on you are the dumbest kid i've ever met watch her out or get up off the floor and walk she can't right she don't have enough strength she don't have enough skill she don't have enough mental prowess or ability to get them legs to match what she's hearing daddy say oh glory to god so if he's a real daddy if he's a real father hey man he just grabs that little kid by the hand picks her up or picks him up and says try it again this is what i'm preaching to you leniency [Music] [Applause] he doesn't look at you and say why didn't you get it right the first time he lets you work on it until you get it and according to the bible here he has long patience waiting to watch you get it friends if we can really see it the way jesus looks at it he's actually like a parent you know when they see that kid beginning to walk parents get so excited i know some of you young people are not going to understand i'm getting ready to speak foreign tongues to you okay but we used to get polaroids not a thing not clueless [Music] we used to get our our our our our video cameras out and back then they were about as big as that box and this speaker up there get the tape we'd slap the tape in that video camera and we started watching look at him now take the step junior take the step and the whole video when you look back on it is this crazy little kid falling down every five seconds and mama going come on now do it again do it again if we can only see what jesus says he doesn't look down on you he doesn't disgrace you or feel disappointed in you but the lord jesus christ is on the other end of the camera he's egging you on cheering you on come on you can do it come on john you can do it come on sir you can do it daddy has got confidence in you [Applause] amen because you're made of the same material i made up and if i can walk you can do it too [Music] [Applause] praise god oh no wonder jesus said the works that i do shall you do also but if he falls down he doesn't look at him and say you are the dumbest kid what is a matter with you you've seen your mother and i walked for two years now [Music] you see how we are with people we don't display the patience of jesus christ forget about brotherly kindness we're not even on the radar yet we need to come to the place of having godly patience one for another come on say amen don't get quiet on me say amen we need to have god's patience one for another have patience with him patience with his word and and patience with ourselves whether you like this or not you are your own worst critic [Music] that's why the devil has really had an easy job in lady ocean he's planted all the seeds he needs to to plant and everything's just cruising along and it's just kind of one of them self-contained situations you know but when it comes to you he don't even have to fight you half the time because all he knows he has to do is drop the idea in your mind and you'll take the ball and run with it the rest of the day remember when you're done that's all he has to say and you'll spend the rest of the day yeah i remember oh i remember what i was i remember do you ever stop to think when you're doing all that and stop to say yeah but you know what i've done that thing 10 000 times yet here i am right here it didn't kill me it didn't take me out i'm still going i'm still breathing i still got a heartbeat and the lord ain't hit me with a lightning bolt right right between my eyes i smell no smoke i feel no flames i went to church and i felt the grace of god come through the message i sang them songs and felt god's mercy hallelujah falling pressure on me amen again the prophet of god said a real daddy wouldn't whip his child when he's trying to walk he falls down on the floor he just reaches down with a big strong hand picks him up takes both hands a hold of him old and new testament and says this is the way you do it son walk like this oh praise song oh you say well walking ain't that important enoch thought it was right that's right and god thought walking was pretty important with him i also thought walking was pretty important with the children of israel they've done it for 40 years he also thought it was important with abraham he said every place the soul of your foot shall tread i bless that and you're coming in i'll bless it and you're going out he said the same thing amen when he comes all the way up to the 20th century and there's brother braddon after he spoke to that storm and god said you want to walk with me amen walking must have been pretty important whenever he called to peter lord if it be you let me walk on the water how about to that woman that saw brother bradham go into the building if i could just walk in his footsteps i know that i'll be healed hallelujah walking is quite important at least the children of jezreel and jericho thought so hallelujah the most important thing in your entire existence with jesus christ is your walk with god in that same book of ephesians where he said we are caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus also said we are predestinated in him to a holy walk now in question's answer is 1961 can i get a little bit more of your time thank you i was going to take it anyways but i thought i'd be gentleman enough to ask first thank you for your pity amen now watch this and questions and answers brother batman is dealing with the gifts of the spirit coming back into the church now for you that study the message you'll actually be able to trace this out this is the second time in the tabernacle's history that brother branham is dealing with the gifts the first is a very silent matter we don't have any record of it and evidently at one time maybe back in the 40s 50s everyone it was brother brown had already established the gifts in the church but now because of the new ministry and the evangelism and things that are coming on the gifts are beginning to cycle back into branham tabernacle so then they're asking brother branham about the ones that are hidden and missing and it's false and it's in air and then it's true and then it's god and then it's right and they're asking him well when somebody prophesies or speaks in tongues interprets he said could that be the god could that be the lord could that be god he answers this way now sometimes it could be god and he said and those little fellows he's talking about the people in the tabernacle using these gifts they're just like a little kid trying to walk now if he falls down four or five times well when it comes to your brother seventy times seven in one day any mathematicians in here would you like to take 70 times seven and then do that times 364 days that goes to prove what kind of patience the bride's gonna have to have you're gonna have to be way more patient than what you are way more lenient than what you are amen praise the lord brother said now i've seen it since i've been here at this church and and well i'll i'll just leave it like that i only wish brother bannon would have been a little had a little bit more liberty to speak what was going on at the tabernacle that he saw i'd just be nosy just to be nosy not to be spiritual i would have liked to know what he saw because you know to me i'm sure it was the same old stuff like we see today a bunch of human beings doing the same thing human beings have always done in a human way humanly speaking he says now i'll just leave it like that but you see but what of it would you say then brother branham why didn't you correct this sure no no you mean to tell me the prophet of god saw error in the church and didn't correct it right away sure wow this was a smart man because he understood the benefit of giving people leniency even if you don't have them you can always borrow an amen from your neighbor if you need it now we're so you know hyper spiritual about everything right somebody comes on the platform they better look the part act apart what would you do with the statement when brother brandon's got a woman sitting on his piano with a short dress cut hair and makeup on her face and they're tearing brother brown to pieces about it and the prophet answered that jess about she's gone tonight you know what he said leave her alone she's a baby in christ [Music] shall i go a little bit further thank you there's a man in christiansburg virginia his name is ernest fulcher brother fulcher's wife is going to be the lord now sister marverine now if you don't know who brother folter is he's barry coffey's father-in-law becky coffee his wife this is her mother and father now back in the old days when the tent revivals were going on brother fulcher was a big deal him billy andrews and a bunch of those others that you'll hear if you go down south they had tents that sometimes would go 10 15 20 000 people in a night 70 80 nights in a row in pentecost and at certain points the message had crossed their path sister marvariem was the one that heard it first she was in such a relationship with those at the branham tabernacle that doc branham brother branham's brother they called him doc doc would keep a folding chair in a closet just for sister marverine to have a spot when she come to the tabernacle and it was overrun because she'd be on the field with her husband and when she catch a spot to slide down to the tabernacle she could never get there in the right amount of time because at that time brother ernest wasn't following the message and she needed a way to get and brother doc always made a point of keeping a chair in there just for her well it was a long about i forget the exact date but it was along about the time that they were really beginning to get into the message that she wrote brother branham a letter and in this letter she asked brother brandon brother branham my husband is an evangelist who preaches and i've heard your message about where women belong and not in the pulpit but we have no trusty song leader so i she was an organ player and a good one god anoint these hands to play like sister marverine my goodness that woman could play and i would say she'd say now i'm i'm playing for my husband and i'm leading singing but brother branham i feel so condemned about this because i heard what you said about a woman in the platform i saw the letter with my own eyes and if i'm telling you wrong then i'll meet it at judgment but let me tell you and share with you what i read sister marverine sister fulcher brother batman said for the time being because there is a need it doesn't hurt anything for you to lead singing for your husband because the bible said you wasn't allowed to preach but it doesn't say anything about singing now it would be better brother adam said if a man was leading it because of what we know from scripture but otherwise i have no scripture against it so continue until the lord sees fit to provide another way now here we go what if you were to come to church this morning and faith would have been your song leader oh or any other woman for that matter don't have to be just sister faith could be that sister or this sister here or the ones that sang them great songs that choir up here what if all the women come up here and decided let's have a song leading choir what would some of you brothers in this church do you would get on that table app so fast the computer memory and speed could not keep up your tablet would not be fast enough to keep up with you pounding out quotes about a one inch place but you see in certain situations we need to practice leniency rather than hypocrisy well hallelujah amen [Applause] right now again as i told you before i started this don't think that i'm saying you don't have to live right don't think i'm giving you a license do whatever you want to do if that's in your heart you need a holy ghost but friends there needs to be an element of leniency for us to serve god without total complete everyday condemning and condemnation and every step we take living in misery because we think god's gonna throw us in hell at any moment can i share something with you i've got the holy ghost i am born again it is impossible for god to send me to hell [Applause] i'm just waiting till that translates if you've got the holy ghost if you are born again amen hallelujah it is impossible for god to ever send you to hell do you realize with that little piece of god inside of you to send you to hell would be like sending him to hell hallelujah he can't send himself to hell no more than he can send you you that are born again of the holy ghost it's impossible to send you to a place that is not your heavenly home amen even the prophet of god sent questions and answers that those that have a real eternal life in their heart he said they're only reflecting the inheritance that's waiting over there if you're wicked indifferent he said if you've got hate in your heart he said you're reflecting that dimension over there but if i am born again of the holy ghost i am only reflecting what's waiting for me on the other side i can't go to hell it's impossible [Music] so this fear that all of a sudden the other shoe is going to drop you need liberty from that right now [Music] i said you need deliverance from that right now listen to this brethren says but you see why didn't you correct it brother brahma no no when billy paul back there first started to walk he was up and down and down more than he was up well that sounds more like me than any other quote i can read he didn't know how to walk but i believed he had a gift of walking [Music] [Applause] and people think brother didn't know what he was talking about some ignoramus didn't know how to put things all the wisdom in what we're hearing he said so i would let him walk a little while but when he got to stumbling those big feet then i would tell him about it see what i mean he'd go along looking at something else popping or some kind of thing like chewing gum and he said oh my i'd say pick up your feet boy where are you at right that's the difference right so when you don't know how to do it god shows you leniency when you do know how to do it he'll tan your hide that's the difference so that's why people oh i'm pretty sure i can live any way i want to live if you're a child of god i triple dog dare you to try it [Music] if you are god's child and you try to that arrogant attitude you just watch and see you'll hear that thing i said after that y'all know what that is don't you that's daddy's belt pop pop pop going through the belt loops friends he loves us so much he won't let us get away with an arrogant attitude amen and amen look here in st luke chapter 7 verse 19. john calling two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another when the men were come they said john the baptist has sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another and that same hour he cured many of their infirmities plagues evil spirits many that were blind gave sight jesus answered said go your way and tell john what things you have seen and heard how the blinds see the lame walk the lepers cleanse the deaf hear the dead raised and the poor the gospel is preached you ever noticed jesus always preached to the poor why do message preachers all want to preach the rich bigger offerings i guess i get maybe that's the reason amen anyhow but notice now here brother bam is telling us a message called it wasn't so from the beginning he said now notice john's eagle eye had gotten filmed over he was in prison because of this great marriage and divorce case that he was up against he had taken a stand for the word it was going to cost him his head but while he's in prison the anointing for introducing the messiah has now lifted off of him and while he's in prison now that human part begins to kick in oh did i make a mistake did i do something wrong did i miss this sure this is where i got the me the title for this message brother adam said now john paid jesus the worst compliment he could have ever paid him and jesus turned around and paid him the greatest compliment he could have ever paid him never miss a man greater born of a woman than john the baptist he said and his eagle eye got filmed over he said here he is a gentle fellow pushed around here and there a strange messiah and after he announced that he was he'd come back saying is this him but jesus understands our weaknesses amen hallelujah praise god amen because you realize friends that if the lord didn't understand these parts of us understand how we think how we feel are the emotions and all of the stuff that is attached to us do you realize many of the battles that you fight are not really your battles there are battles that were handed down to you i've got laying right here the prophet of god said all that sin and all those curses and all that stuff visited on the sons amen it come all the way from adam and eve and it's passed through the genetics passed through the bloodline passed through the stream of time until it's made up you so that temper that you battle with that ain't your temper that was your great great great great great great great great great great granddaddy's temper and it multiplied and it multiplied don't you see rather why this bride is going to be one of the greatest overcomers of any age as i'm not just whipping my temper but i'm whipping generation before me that fell into this body to make me what i am that's right so here's john sitting in prison is this him his little eagle eyes filmed over where he couldn't see too clearly now jesus could have said what in the world is a matter with you john right you saw the light above me when i come into the river that day you heard the spirit of god speak from that dove and say this is my beloved son and whom i'm well pleased to dwell in you saw the vindication and the anointed and you even humbled yourself and said i'm not even worthy to unlatch your shoes or latch them up even but jesus understands we don't have time to read it but in the rapture message brother rem is saying to another man that he's just preaching and he says because he says he calls his name mike said in that wonderful mike and he said think about it he knows all about us and he loves you before there was a world he knows your nature he knows your weaknesses he knows your habits he knowed all about you and what she was going to be and he looked all across this great universe and he said i choose you amen do you realize that nothing of what you earn was evidence nor nor a criteria for whether he accepted you or rejected you not only does he know your family and know you but he knows what kind of stock what kind of ilk you come from he knows all the way back into the generations of the generations of the generations plum from the creation of adam on down to make up you six thousand years later god knows all of them lifetime time and he knew before the world ever began what she was going to be what she was going to look like what your strengths would be and what your weaknesses would be what your good parts would be and what your bad parts would be and none of that stopped him from saying but i love you i love you i love you i love you hallelujah to his holy name let's bow our heads together can we now if the musicians have just played quietly for me with your heads bowed now nobody looking around i just want you to listen to the sound of my voice for a minute as you stand here today i'm sure that in your heart you already know how the lord's been dealing with you little things maybe is working on you about things he's talking to you about now look friend that's up to you and the lord what he's dealing with you about okay it's not up to me not up to some other preacher not up to some other person not your mama your daddy not cousins aunt uncle it's up to you and the lord but while you're standing here in his presence like this don't you think it would be fitting just to allow a lot of these shackles to fall off us right now [Music] these chains fearing hell fearing god's judgment fearing god's whippings or spankings or don't you think it would be fitting for us just to start opening our heart right now and say okay lord i now see what kind of grace you have for me in an age where every human on the
