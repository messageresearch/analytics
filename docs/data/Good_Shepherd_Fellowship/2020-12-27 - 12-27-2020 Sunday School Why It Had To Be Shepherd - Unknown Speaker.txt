TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this speaks of true atonement coming for sickness and sin that staff itself had turned into a serpent before pharaoh and the same pharaoh tried to mimic by magicians and so does the modern pharaohs of today and make believers carnal impersonators of the message trying to mimic the same thing without knowing where it's coming from and throw it into some denominational something when it's just free from it as a aries from being pinned up sure but try to mimic it make a mimi but notice this same shepherd's staff eat up the other snails where was that snake's at they were rods on the floor and there's only one rod picked up both heavens and earth will pass away said jesus but my word shall not speaks of true atonement coming for sin also israel's future offered know how spoke of israel now in the future there they were offered deliverance from bondage of death by a prophet shepherd they were brought out of bondage by a prophet shepherd with the staff see it was speaking of israel's future delivered from death and hell by a shepherd prophet that we'll speak of now to all that all as we know israel did not receive the prophet's shepherd's word all of israel didn't receive it now notice they was complaining oh when he was performing the miracle she was a great fellow but when he come to his message that was different all great signs follows a new message coming we know that in the wilderness they complained in the wilderness and died by the thousands frankly there was only two of them that ever went through that was saved out of a mid two and a half million two out of two and a half million you say that what happened to them they are eternally gone all of them brother branham jesus said so they said our fathers eat man in the wilderness and they drank from the rock and he's jesus said and there are every one dead eternally separated see everyone notice they complained about god's provided way was the reason they died i closely don't miss these last few remarks they complain what made them die in the wilderness they complained about god's provided way by a one-man message a prophet a leadership of one man tell me when god ever used a group to leave you won't find it in the bible one man they the word came to moses cora we all know that um he uh he got himself together and complained about god not being just to do a thing like that to make one man with a message he said we're all holy why can't we have a denomination and why can't we have set up this and do this and do that god told moses separate yourself from me i've had enough of it and remember jude speaks the same thing in the last days that's right they perished in the game singing of gokora we all so know what happened to korah and the and the rest that questioned god's word and god's wisdom of that one man leadership every one of them perished now we will notice god in the shepherd prophet showing his future plans in the next sign voice now watch we see it there now let's watch it in the next time now notice he was sent to his brethren in slavery under bondage with a message of deliverance with a god-given sign to prove his claims israel went for his message they believed it every one of them but in the evening time they went for his miracles but in the evening time when they he gave his message it was different all that did not believe that message died that's right what was the message the message was of the coming judgment at the evening at the evening time god went out through the camp of israel defined if the people had believed his shepherd prophet's message and all had not believed it perished now notice we're going to bring it over to the great shepherd just in a few moments notice the great shepherd prophet's ministry of these miracles every church opened and would receive him they wanted their sick healed they wanted to do great things his popularity was great but when the evening time came one day after he had turned water to wine and had fed thousands bread and performed miracles he began to sit down and talk to them and he said to them uh i and my father are one why sayeth thou show us the father oh brother are this man making himself equal with god that was too much for their ecclesiastical thinking but it was the truth he was but when they did many did not follow him then he turned around and said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you now what do you think a smart intellectual person would thought i imagine the priest that had him in the temple was very was very ashamed of them having in there just thinking that a man would stand up and say a thing like that except you people eat my fresh and drink my blood said this is a human vampire man eat my flesh and drink well it's a cannibal you good thinking people you get away from such a lunatic as that he never explained it he just said it he did it to stumble him to separate his sheep from goats he needed to throw them all and then nobody wanted to cooperate with him they had no cooperation from there notice at the evening time god went out to the camps and seen who had believed and he did the same thing in the days of the great shepherd notice the great shepherd prophet's ministry but notice this to believers of his message but not this evening message they wouldn't believe it they wouldn't believe that he was god they wanted to make him a nice man they wanted to make him a prophet he was a nice man and he was a prophet but he was more than that that's a common teaching today that he's just a good man he was a prophet he was nothing short of emmanuel he was god manifested in jesus christ his son making him and the father one that's all he could be zechariah 14 7 i might say this speaks of the evening lights and message again at the end time did you notice that as many as followed moses seen the pillar of fire that identified him on mount sinai he had testified of and spoke of this pillar of fire being in a bush and had told him this message many of them wouldn't believe it but as many as followed him out of egypt come up out of the world across the sea of separation and went into the wilderness saw the same pillar of fire that he spoke of vindicating that shepherd prophet to be the shepherd of the sheep they saw it and many of them still didn't believe it after they saw it notice how again the never change in god the great shepherd prophet them that stayed by him and with his ministry to mount olive the great shepherd prophet the one we're speaking of jesus came and heard the father the same pillar of fire vindicate him that vindicated moses the same god that moses spoke of come over moses and prove by a pillar of fire that he was jehovah that was leading moses god was in his shepherd prophet here he takes the other shepherd prophet the great prophet the real sheep jesus and takes the choice of three men and takes them up on top of mount olives and there a vindicated jesus and even excommunity himself from all other people said this is my beloved son hear ye him and when they looked up they saw no man save jesus only that's right he was the one now that settles it as far as i'm concerned moses within the presence of the shekinah on mount sinai it changed his face when he come down he had to put a veil over his face the shepherd prophet moses who jehovah was in in a potion just to potion his faith he had the word in his mouth but notice when the great shepherds was in the presence of the shekinah what did he do it changed his whole countenance he wasn't just part of god he was all of god he was emmanuel why did it have to be shepherd look see now god almighty patrol portraying himself brother in moses the shepherd prophet watch how god made himself known that's my last remark see him standing anointed in the presence of the pillar of fire nobody on the mountain at all but moses and jehovah hey amen means so built watch put thy hand in thy bosom watch this second sign out of the voice put my hand into the bosom we have no reason to believe that moses is left-handed so he must have put his right hand into his book because most men are right-handed they put his right hand now watch what a picture we see here of jehovah in moses the shepherd prophet moses representing god because god was in moses watch him put his hand in our bosom what a sign now there he stands holding his right hand over his heart standing like this where the hidden secrets of redemption had been hid since the foundation of the world here's why shepherds jesus is god's right hand we all know there's moses betraying him exactly he helped the secrets of the father and it showed them to us notice watch him pull from his bosom his right hand smitten with deadly leprosy show what god would do with his right hand notice the leprosy has no cure notice again it wasn't just common leprosy it was in its last stage why does snow his hand was smitten with a horrible thing how moses must have felt when he pulled his right hand from over his heart out of his bosom and his hand was smitten with leprosy leprosy symbolizes sin incurable and especially in its last stage brethren that's where the world was when god pulled his right hand from his bosom a world was smitten with deadly leprosy and no cure at all for it so is it tonight because they won't receive the remedy the remedy was made at calvary but people wants to take some man-made prescription instead of god's prescription for sin notice it never gradually come on as the course of leprosy does but all at once when he pulled his hand it was smitten it was full of leprosy notice what god said now you won't gradually drift into sin but the day you eat thereof that day you die that's right the day you either notice it was the prophet shepherd that smote himself he's talked by the commandment of god and put his own hand into his bosom and pulled it out smith with leprosy the prophet shepherd did it himself and the great prophet shepherd jesus did it himself i'll lay my life down no man takes it from me he was the great shepherd the great prophet shepherd no man takes it from me i do it myself notice it didn't gradually come it'd come in a minute the great shepherd himself took our guilt and smote himself took our sins and laid it upon him no wonder the poet wrote mid-rendering rocks and darkening skies my savior bowed his head and died the opening veil revealed the way the heavens joyous and endless day that secret had been in god's bosom all these years covered by his right hand jesus the great shepherd took upon himself our guilt for us isaiah 53 6 said he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastim our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the secret of god's healing laid in the bosom of jesus christ our god he was on the right hand of god that the only sheep that held in his bosom the secret that's reason the four shadows of it had to always be a sheep the first was the sheep the last of the sheep that's reason that had to come to a shepherd to know how to take care of his sheep you get it notice he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chasm of our peace upon him notice it came quick and it left quick no sooner the right hand was withdrawn from the bosom the second time the deadly disease was gone when he drew it the second time and when the great shepherd the sheep prophet when he said on calvary's cross when he had paid this penalty of sin for us all he said it's finished sin was over the penalty was paid debts were settled it didn't take a year to finally come into it the days of some other reformer or something it was finished right then sin came in a moment by transgression of god's law by breaking one word the night my brethren your soul is over hell on a chain and that chain is not some theological seminary's teaching that chain is not some denomination or some creed that you're living by that chain is god's word jesus gave the human race his word to live by and eve only broke one little link of it and the any chain is no stronger than its weakest link when you take one word out that was the first of the book jesus came in the middle of book said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that prostituteth thou the mouth of god that is the middle of the last of the book he said whosoever shall take one word mistranslate one word take one word out of here i'll take his part from the book of life you're passing over hell hanging on the word of god don't you let somebody squeeze something into you it's not thus saith the lord oh i see well they say surely oh we've done all we've done that's what maybe the high priest then thought in the days of the great shepherd that's what he thought that's what satan told us surely god will not but he did because he said he would and that's reason he'll do it again today no wonder he says as it was in the days of no whoring eight souls were saved by water so shall it be in the coming of the son of man very few or straight is the gate and there is a wave that leads to life and few there will be that will find it that's right because broad is a way that leads to destruction many will go in there when the great shepherd was smitten the great sheep prophet one of his smitten backer he said it is finished and that minute as soon as this shepherd was smitten sin is settled there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished that very minute that jesus said it was finished he the great shepherd had come for his sheep it was finished god's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten then on easter he returned it amen raised it up again to his bosom and extended it down to you and i in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us from the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepherd it was revealed by a shepherd prophet shepard no wonder the mountain jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit his face and screamed for joy no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees until they shook and shook and joyed and jumped they steamed the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on the book of life and they seen it their own nature was redeemed they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake and the mountains rent and the rocks fell out and the sun went down and everything taking place like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you that it's finished there are seeing jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out and the the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt and i've seen meetings for the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord killed the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never did see anything disorderly there's always writing orders because they had recognized that their name that had been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered the prophet shepherd no matter what the other ecclesiastical rim said about it they knew what had happened just as them shepherds did back there they know what took place no man has a right to enter the sacred desk to preach the word until he did as moses did meet god himself upon grounds word that there's no theologian can explain it away moses was there no matter how israel's messenger said or the nonsense you just imagine you saw this it's nonsense you couldn't take it away from him he knowed he was there he was the one it happened to and no man by a theological degree or some doctor's degree has her right behind the pulpit to claim the message of jesus christ until he's first met god face to face in the pillar of power there's a little right to call himself a messenger because all the theologians in the world couldn't explain that away from you it happened to you you were there you didn't know about it care what anybody else says or how much they can say the days is gone it isn't so it happened to you it's according to the word yes that's the reason moses knew this voice that spoke to him was a word voice he know that god has told abraham your seat your soldier for 400 years but i will deliver them and he knowed the 400 years was up and he was called to do it man and women god promised in this last days that he had poured out his spirit upon all flesh he promised he'd send it back to the holy ghost it is called a bride that's spotter wrinkle he promised to do it he'll do it don't listen to these harlem shepherds they'll lead you astray the holy spirit is a shepherd to feed you sheep food from this word it always comes by the shepherd he is our shepherd listen to him you are the sheep of his foe if you are you hear his voice not what somebody else says you hear what he said a strange voice you know nothing about it oh my listen to the mighty shepherd prophet again interpreting and introducing to them john when he stood in the river of jordan look what he said standing there preaching he said the hour is coming notice john was a priest son they always follow the line of their father that's why we got our names but whatever they did they called him and john was supposed to be a priest like his father and you know his mother uh when she uh had been conceived at the age of the lord met his father zachariah and went home to elizabeth and she was already six months in to be mother but she had no life yet she was scared because the baby hadn't moved that's not normal and the holy ghost the angel of the lord appeared to mary and told her that she's gonna have a baby knowing no man and told her about elizabeth's condition she went up the hills of judea to tell elizabeth and when she met elizabeth she told her that she was going to be a mother and she couldn't understand it knowing no man but she said uh the holy spirit overshadowed me and said that this holy thing that'll be born to me will be called the son of god and i'll call his name jesus and the first time that the name jesus has ever spoken in human life a little dead baby in its mother's womb leaped for joy and shouted and jumped in the womb of a mother and it never had received life yet the name of jesus christ spoke life into a dead baby what ought to do in a church that claims to be foreign again and we set as towerism bumps on a pickle and let such things go and on to raise and testify your conviction and condemn all this nonsense make jesus christ the same yesterday and forever it's christmas time get out these santa clauses and stuff away with that nonsense of commercializing wherever he hears about santa claus in the bible it's a roman mythology there's nothing to it at all there is no such a thing don't teach your children such nonsense is that when one day you'll have to tell him that it was all a blind story then you've lied to your child and it'll hurt your testimony about jesus christ you'll say maybe it's the same thing but jesus christ the great shepherd prophet back into the christmas world belongs notice listen to this prophet john as he stands there we all know it is a great shepherd prophet now he had a message the angel know that he was going to introduce jesus now he couldn't go to some seminary they said now you know that dr so-and-so is just the man to take the place now you're to introduce him and you know that just see he couldn't get mixed up with man at the age of nine years old we're told he went into the wilderness to prepare before god that's where the shepherds come from notice this message wasn't like a theologian with some great big swelling words of some degree he said oh you generation of snakes telling religious man you're a bunch of snakes that's what he'd seen the wilderness he saw the snake lowest thing he could find was a snake and he called them priest and clergymen and theologians of that day a bunch of snakes said who's warned you from the wrath to come don't begin to say we belong to this and we belong to that for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to rise children abraham stones what had seen the wilderness also the axes laid to the root of the tree that's what he'd been seeing snakes trees wilderness and see that was his message he didn't know the great swelling words of some great doctor of divinity could explain it all away he just preached exactly the line of nature that's why we're showing here the shepherd's staff the shepherd the sheep the lion of nature what did he do he had a great thing to do he was the one that would know the messiah he said i say he's standing here among you now and you don't know him because your theology has got you so tied up you don't know where you're at one day jesus come walking out he says behold there comes the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world the lamb hallelujah the real atonement there comes whatever sheep from the garden of eden down has shattered an ordinary man walking down the earth they said john how did you know it i didn't see one thing different but i bare record i saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and a voice saying this is my beloved in whom i am pleased to dwell in watch the dove and the lamb yeah what if it had been a what if it had been something what if it had been a wolf standing there well that lamb could not have went upon or that dove god symbolized himself with the dove the most sneakers of all the birds of the heaven his son by a sheep the most meekest of all the animals on earth neither clean bird of the heaven not a crow not a vulture but a dove not a pig but a lamb any other nature wouldn't have blended together and notice when the dove come upon the lamb it let him not the way he would but the way the father would leave that's the way our real lamb is today oh christmas time sheep don't you know that god only leads by his word that's his staff notice nothing would have took place but john said the rest of them didn't see it but i bear record i saw it introducing behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world may i not introduce my christmas message and when i'm closing now jesus christ is saying it should be delayed forever it's that same lamb he's just as much the lamb today as he was then he's just as much here as he was there for his word is the same wherever two or three are gathered in mining there i am in the midst of them that's exactly what he said he never changes he's god the word he never changes still giving his sheep and feeding them by his shepherd prophet his sheep food first not to the theologian to his sheep they won't how can their mothers eat it but the wise notices but the wise and intellectual well-trained of the world still desire to say there is a santa claus there's all kinds of fiction and stuff that they worship because they won't accept him the word because in their denominations it doesn't fit their taste the harling shepherds of the day the hirelings from creed that'll want to unite you under one goat don't you believe it [Music] they'll lead you to the slaughter pen here the great shepherd that was born 1900 years ago this month sometime out honoring his message come to true shepherds that knowed how to take care of sheep notice him they still desire they won't accept it today just the same as they didn't then because it does not affect their ecclesiastical taste they turn that word around and make it suit their organization and they won't preach the word they won't they say well that was for the day's apostles it doesn't mean this it means just exactly what it says this needs nobody to improv interpret it for him now let us at this hour bow our heads and hearts towards the dust of the earth and hasten real quick to a manger [Music] you
