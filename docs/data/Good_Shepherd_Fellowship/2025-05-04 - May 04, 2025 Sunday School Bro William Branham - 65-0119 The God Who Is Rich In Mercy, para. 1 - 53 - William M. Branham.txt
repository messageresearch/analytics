========================================

[Music] I was sort of packed away coming in seeing brother Moore and all of them here on the platform. The friends that I've known for so many years. It's certainly a privilege to see them here tonight. I feel kind of small to stand here and speak with such theologians behind me. And uh maybe they'll correct me when I'm wrong. I hope so. We are very happy tonight to have a certain person here, Sister Rose. We is coming down with brother Shores and his assistant today for a little lunch. And on the road down, Brother Williams said that Sister Rose was very sick. And I we went in to see her just a moment, knelt down, and she had a high fever and really sick. Just a few words of prayer and the Lord spoke to us and said she's going to be healed. Said she'll be there tomorrow night. And here she is tonight sitting right here. That's right. Sister Rose, stand up just a minute. So we're thankful to the Lord. She's bed. She said the devil just beat me out of everything. I come over here and then break down with this uh some kind of a throat disease and so forth, but the Lord has brought her through. So to that we're happy. Yes. Amen. Thanking the dear Lord. Now we've been having wonderful times. And tomorrow night now we go over to the the Ramada. And don't forget now it won't be here tomorrow night. It'll be at the Ramada. And the convention uh begins the next night. Had to put up with me one more night. So last night I uh went so far off a scale I kind of made a little promise to myself that the first of the year that I just go to cut them messages down from three four five hours to maybe along about 30 40 minutes. And as I told you last night my wife commented me Sunday said you did real well. So so and then of course I had to come along last night and ruin it. see about I was 55 minutes instead of 38 last night coming down tonight. Billy said, "What are you going to speak on?" I said, "Well, I got a few little notes wrote out here and some scriptures. I don't know some of them." Four or five different messages. I say a few when I get down there and see what's going on. Said, "You promise pray for all them sick people?" I said, "Yes, sir." "How many cards you got?" I said, "200." I said, "I better start on them tonight." And he said, "Now remember, you only get 15 minutes to speak." Said, "You talked the rest of it up last night. But I had to hurry up, won't I?" Well, we are made a promise to you that we would pray for those people who had prayer cards. And we're we're obligated to a promise. Of course, we can't bring them all through these lines. Neither could I be able to call them individually out in the audience. Even though the Holy Spirit would give it to me. I just can't stand to do it. It just too much on me. And uh but we're all acquainted with those things. We know that God's still God. It isn't that that heals. It's that that only builds faith to let us know that that we're in his presence. And we're going tonight to pray for all those sick people. every one of them. It's got those prayer cards to be prayed for. And then tomorrow night over at the rimada, we'll try to give out some more and start praying for them over there because I still have tomorrow night and I think I have one night of the convention maybe of breakfast also. It depends on how things come out. The some of the one of the speakers that never showed up hasn't as yet. I don't think brother Hamburg or is that Hamburg? Hamburger. Hamburger. Cashious hamburger. So I I get it all wrong. That's um that German name. I I guess that's German. So um I may have to kind of pinch hit as we call excuse expression for him. So we've been having a wonderful time in the Lord. Oh to all you be some strangers here tonight. We're sure glad to have you in. Trust that the Lord will bless you. I pray that there won't be any sick people in the building when we leave tonight. That our Lord will come down in his great power and will heal all that's sick and afflicted. Here some time ago, he used to take the individuals in on special interviews, some of the hard cases that we couldn't get through. Then it build up so fast that it got to be the Lord kept blessing it to we got three or 400 on waiting. And so then people get their feelings hurt because that wait maybe on that much time you'd have to wait maybe a year or two so to get into it. See just in between the meetings to take them on the interviews and we just sit and wait on the Lord until he told us just exactly the case. There's no doubt there's people sitting here tonight's been on them special interviews. Israel, let's see you raise your hands on the special interviews. Yes, there's it. So and know that's right. We just wait to see what the Lord would say, what that case. And then I had to stop that here. Some time ago, I told Billy that we couldn't have any more private interviews. See, I I just passed 25 recently, second time, and way up towards the third time. So u as you get a little older while you don't um you somehow can't keep up like you used to your steps shorten and and you of course brother Moore don't know anything about that yet. He's I think we're somewhere around the same age with a lot of waters down the river since you and I and brother Brown come here the first time with brother outlaw and brother Garcia and brother Fuller. I wonder if them man would be in here tonight. Brother Garcia, Brother Fuller, Brother Outlaw. Are they here? Raise up your hands if you are there. Yes, there's Brother Fuller, I believe, if I'm not mistaken. Brother Outlaw over here. Brother Garcia. Uh, I believe, oh, that he left Phoenix. I think that's right. He he left Phoenix and he's over in California. Well, certainly grand days and I still believe the same message I had then. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I guess that's been about Well, Becky was a baby. That's about 19 years. And now she's a big old fat ugly girl sitting out there somewhere. 19 years old. Where are you, Becky? Boy, she'll get me for that. I remember packing her in on my arm. I'd sure have a job doing that tonight. remember over at brother Garcia's church one night, she's little bitty fella, little and I said, "We have an international meeting tonight." I said, "I'm speaking to the Spanish." And I said, "My wife here is a German." I said, "I'm an Irishman." And I said, "And my little girl's an Indian." And that was Becky. So when I went out the back door, there's a little Mexican girl out there said, "Brother Brandon said, yes, honey. What do you want?" So, don't you think your baby is a bit pale to be an Indian? She's a blonde, you know. And I said, just an Indian in action. Well, we're thankful that to be here again tonight. Now, before we approach the word, let's approach him for he is the word. When the word is made manifest, that's him in you. as we had last night on the seed of discrepancy. Did you appreciate that? The Lord bless me. I I certainly appreciated bringing the message to you and uh we see what the seeds are. Now, is there a special request tonight? Just something special. Maybe some of you all it's going to be in this prayer line. Say, "God, be merciful and I come to be prayed for. Let my faith rise up to meet the conditions." And and maybe somebody's got a loved one sick and and something. Would you just raise your hand so God would just look down and say now if that you don't how that makes me feel to look there just look at the need in here minister brothers just look at that see now if it makes me feel that way what does it do to our father certainly now let us pray dear Jesus we are approaching now the great throne of mercy through this allsufficient name for there's no other name given among man whereby we must be saved but only this name of the Lord Jesus. And we are coming in his name. And we pray, heavenly father, that you will receive us tonight as your believing children and forgive our unbelief. Lord, help it tonight that it may uh be that we will completely believe every word of God tonight for all the things that we have need of. You know what's beneath these hands that's been raised up? There's sickness. Some of them may be domestic troubles. Some of them financial troubles. Some of them are weary. Maybe some backslid. Some sinner. Whatever their need is, thou art more than a match for any enemy. So we pray Lord that that tonight that we will recognize that our enemies, everyone has been defeated even to death itself and that we are more than conquerors in him who who loved us and gave himself for us has washed us in his blood. We pray Lord that all unbelief, all doubt, all flusterations, all that's unlike God will flee from us tonight. That the Holy Ghost might have the rightway in our hearts. May he speak to us in a mysterious ways. May he speak to us in his power. May he resurrect those that are are spiritually dead. Bring back health to those who are sick and afflicted. Lift up the feeble knees, the wearied hands that's hanging down. May there be a time of rejoicing. May it break forth tonight, Lord, to leave this place to the Rematada in start one of the greatest conventions that's ever been held in this city. Thank you, Lord. While we're assembled together and pray, you said if the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then I'll hear from heaven. God, we pray that this will be so tonight. Now, Father, as we read the word, no one can interpret it but you. You're your own interpreter. And we pray that you'll interpret to us the things that we read tonight. Lord, we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Now, if many of you like to just mark down scriptures that a minister reads, and I would like for you to tonight, if you would to turn to Ephesians, and I was speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians, how that the book of Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old Testament. and how it was a book of redemption. And redemption has two different parts. Come out of and entering into. First you have to come out. Some people wants to bring the world in with them. But you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ. You have to come out of unbelief to enter into faith. There cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine faith. You must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind to enter into faith. And that was the book of the Ephesians of the Old Testament. Joshua where Moses represented the law could not save no one but grace could. And here Joshua is the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior. And now then we find out that we have come to another Ephesians, another Ephesus. Now where that in our intellectual denominations and so forth, all of our educations programs has come to its uh its Jordan, then we must have an Ephesians again. We must have an exodus. we to come out and to go into for the rapture. Now, we're going to read tonight from the second chapter of Ephesians. I was just saying that so you could get to the the spot or the turn to the chapter. You and you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses in sin. wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh, fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath. even as others. But God who is rich in mercy or his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin has he quickened us together with him or quickened us together with Christ. By grace are ye saved. I want to take from there a few part of of the verse. But God, the God who is rich in mercy. I want you to notice Sharon uh the prophet apostle rather Paul who um who how he made mention of this. How you has he quickened who were once dead. You have he quickened who were once dead. Dead in sin and trespasses, walking after the things of the world, the desire of the flesh and fulfilling the desire of the mind has uh what caused this change? You see what caused it from one time being dead to quicken? Quicken means made alive. There was a change from death unto life. There's no other there's no other thing that could happen to any person so great as to change him from death to life. Amen. A man if he was dying physically and could be healed physically, that would be a great thing. But nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and God has quickened him to life. You once in times past dead. You were dead. Even many here tonight, one time can look back and know that you were dead. But now, why aren't you dead tonight as you were then? You deserve to be that way because you was a sinner. But God who is rich and mercy that's the that's the thing. God who was rich all these things that we were but God that made the change right there. God who is rich in mercy. Oh, I'm so glad for that. Amen. that he being rich in mercy, if he was just rich in money, if he was just uh rich in materials, which he is, but yet the greatest thing is being rich in mercy. Oh, what a great word that is. How that we were once dead. And we speaking the other night on how the seed must die and everything around that germ of life must not only die but rot. If it doesn't rot, it cannot live. And rot is completely done away with. It's finished. And until we get to the place that our own ideas and our own thinking is completely gone and it's rotted away from us, then the germ of life can begin to live. Now, now we might I might inject just a little bit of doctrine here that I don't if you don't believe it, all right, that's just okay. I do believe it. I believe that that a man when he's born in this world that when you're a little baby born into the world you could not have been here without being the fornowledge of God because he is infinite and he knows all things and when that little baby is born into the world there's something in that baby if he's ever going to have life there's a little something in in there in that child then that he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him. Now if you'll take the scriptures plainly declare that now if you've got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life. We always were. And the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is the only thing that's eternal. And like as Mel Kazdc received tithes from Abraham and it was lauded to his greatgrandson Levi who was yet in the loins of Abraham paid tithe for he was yet in the loins of Abraham when he met Melzdc. I want to speak on that or the other place one morning. Who is this Melzdc? Now notice that way back God knew this boy coming down. He knowed all things. Now we are a part of God. You always was. You don't remember because you were only an attribute in God. You were only in his thinking. Your very name. If it ever was on the book of life, it was put there before the foundation of the world. He knew what you were. I'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine, but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare. You don't know who you are. You are not going to be. But now you are the sons of God. You always were the sons of God. See, when God had you in his thinking at the beginning, you have to be some part of you. Your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he before you even become material here on earth before there was anything but God. You were one of his attributes. He know what your name would be. He know the color hair you'd have. He know all about you. The only thing happened is when you being a sinner, many of you can can uh fellowship with me on this thought. When you was a little boy, a little girl, you'd walk around and there would be certain things that would just word it wouldn't bother the other kids. It seemed like there was something in you that cried out there was God somewhere. Yet, you were a sinner. You remember that? Certainly. Now, what was that? That was that little form of life in you then. And then after a while, you heard the gospel. Maybe you went to church. You picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination. But one day you being part of God, you had to be part of the word. And when you heard the word, you know where you come from. You know what was the truth. You were always the seed was in you. Always. the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it like my little eagle story how the little eagle was hatched out under a hen and the little fella uh walked with the chickens he the hen clucked and he didn't understand her clucking and and the little chickens their diet they had in the barnyard he he didn't understand That's uh how that they did that. But there was something in him seemed to be different from what that chicken was there because at the beginning he was a eagle. That's right. One day his mama come hunting him and when he heard that scream of the eagle, it was different from the cluck of the hen. Yeah. And that's the way it is with every bornag again believer. You can hear all the theology you want to and all the man-made discrepancy. But when that word flashes out there, then there's something takes a hold. You come to you who were once dead in sin, that life has he quickened. There has to be a life there to quicken to first. God by his fornowledge know all things. And we were predestinated to be sons and daughters of God. Ye who were once dead in sin and trespasses were worry and we all had our times past but hath he quickened. Look at Paul when Paul was a great theologian. But when he come face to face with that word Jesus it quickened. He come to life right quick because he was ordained to be that the he was part of the word and when the word saw the word it was his nature. All the clucking of the hins and the orthodox churches didn't have no effect upon him. He had saw the word. It was part of him. He was an eagle. He wasn't a chicken. He was just in the barnyard with him. But he was a eagle to begin with. I heard a similar little story, I hope it don't sound sacriiggious, about a little duck being born under a hen one time. He couldn't understand a funny looking little fellow, odd guy, and he couldn't understand the dust and everything. They were playing in the barnyard. But one day, the old hen led the little brood out behind the barn and he got a smell of water. Well, he tuck out towards that water as hard as he could go. Why? He had never been on a pond before. or he had never been in the water, but he was a duck to begin with. Only thing he had to do is come to himself. That's the same thing the believer is. There's something in him that when he meets God face to face, he comes to himself. That seed is in him and it's quickened. My That's right. And he flies away from the things of the world. They become dead to him. My remember we all had our life in the past in those things of the world. But once we got a hold of that real thing, something that quickened us, a little seed that come to life, then all the things of the world rotted right there. We had no more desire of it. [Music]
