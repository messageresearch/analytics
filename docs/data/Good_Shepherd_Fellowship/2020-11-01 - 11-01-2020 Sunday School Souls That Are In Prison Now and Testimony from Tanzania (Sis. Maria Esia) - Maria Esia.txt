TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] for this privilege of assembling together one more time knowing that someday we will assemble for our last time as mortals and then we'll assemble in a glorified state with thee and all the redeemed of all ages shall be assembled there all our hearts beat hive and of great anticipation waiting for that hour to arrive with that all fears vanish from us we have nothing to fear nothing to dread we look forward to the promise that the eternal god has made us and we know that it's true that is why we live we live for that that hour that time when this mortal will be changed and we'll be made like him and there will be no more sickness no more sorrow no more heartaches oh it'll all be over then and with joy of heart we in faith and courage we look forward for that day that's why we are gathered here today lord to confess our wrongs and ask for mercy that's why we face this altar this morning because that we know we're immortal and there's many mistakes in us and we're full of fault but we come to confess our wrongs and then look to our heavenly father with open hearts for the blessings and renewal of strength and faith that he would give us in this hour as we have assembled here according to the promise in heavenly places in christ jesus or we claim that we have passed from death unto life by his promise and we are caught up in a heavenly atmosphere setting with him now may he teach us this morning the things that he'd have us to know and give us the bread of life that we might be sustained for the future that lays before us grant it lord this is our prayer that we asked in jesus christ's name amen good morning to everyone and it's very good to be assembled here with you again this morning in this heavenly atmosphere of worship just a teeny bit late you had a some real real bad call just a few minutes ago boy laying there dying and it's as sure as i'm standing here the lord touched his body [Music] hallelujah a boy standing here which is my cousin's son they were really catholic to begin with but they went to mass this morning and something told him to come here and so they there's a change so they're they're coming out the house and prepare for water baptism so then um there's a uh there's a just wonderful things that our lord does all time he's just constantly doing things they come to get in and uh they couldn't get in they said there's just no way to get in i said well you want to talk to me and i said just come on up the house and we'll talk that over there so i thought on my road to new york now to this meeting coming up that it would just be so nice i know i'd be refreshed to drop in and help light my fire from what far you all have and we stopped for a day this morning and we got in yesterday day before yesterday at noon and then uh we got to leave i was going to leave this afternoon but i think i'll go and we start in the morning early real early we might have some snow on the roads and things between here in new york i'd go through virginia through the mountains and all through the alleghenies just in the bottom part then of the uh of the adirondack so we began it i forget it's the arena there i knew when they told the old saint nicholas serena down i understand they built this new one and as far as i know we're getting about some of the first nights that's ever it's been let out so we're grateful for that for the greater new york uh pentecostal people and i think we've got several churches cooperating and we're expecting a great time and we'll be back the lord willing uh uh sometime next week and and if it be the will of god well we hope to get the stop over for sunday a week for for the sunday morning service and then uh uh boards right in owner pastor again is always doing the scene and uh and i thought maybe if i got into the evening out asking and then being there's a nice group here and people i see from out of town are here i thought maybe tonight if the pastor hasn't got anything special that it would be uh we'd have a little service tonight just a short one maybe pray for the sick hallelujah thank you we are hoping to pray for the sick tonight talk on divine healing and and pray for the sake start early so we can get out early and if the pastor will uh what you usually start at 7 30 is that right how about starting seven tonight seven let me get on at 7 30 did i let me out by 8 or 8 30 to give people time then to to go if that's all right everybody laughs i said 8 or 8 30. i'm i i hope to be out at that time praying for the sick you know we never know so we have had a great time since leaving you in this last fall early and uh the lord has blessed us in many great things and and tonight if the lord willing i want to tell you on the last visitation i had from god in colorado a few weeks ago and that's what i thought i'd bring in now maybe stimulate faith for a good healing service tonight for the sick and the afflicted now this morning to get right into the service uh something struck my heart about a month ago and uh it might be now i think they're or they're taping this tape and they'll say all right so don't know what the tape gets out to others i can't say that while i'm going to speak on this morning uh i can't say that it it is i know it's right see the message part will be right but the thing that i want to do is a question in my mind it looks so real and yet since i come in and since i it was revealed to me i have been so scared that i'd say the wrong thing and might leave the wrong impression upon people and it's a and i what i had notes wrote down on what i was going to say i cut part of it out so that i might not make it too strong because you see if a person i i love the lord god and the only way i know i love him is because i love you that's the only way i know and yet i don't want to have anything that's revealed to me and then i'll tell you if it's to tell you and then i'm afraid that if i say something a little too strong it might hurt somebody and you know it's uh you just have to almost just get to the platform and feel led to say what you're going to say that's all and then sometimes you might say something and someone would get the another slant to it and they'd run off on that side and then somebody say oh this is this but i want you to know that what i'm going to say is just pursuing and the word pursue means to adventure without authority so uh i am uh i don't say that this is true but it's just a little thought that i might drop along to you that you might weigh it out and see what you think about it and then it'll of course it'll be scriptural because i wouldn't preach nothing but is that the hour yet has this arrived to this hour and uh has these things meant that i pray with all that's what's in me that it isn't i pray that it isn't right that it isn't that it's going to be but has it come to that time yet that's what i want everybody understands thoroughly that i don't know i just is it this time if it is god be merciful to us but if it is in that time that it's going to come now as soon as we can we got a great itinerary in front of the lord willing and i've got to go overseas right after christmas in europe and asia uh europe especially and then i come back here to the united states for a few services and then it go back down into south africa beginning on the second of september in durban and go from the second i think to about the 10th and then have three days to go married johannesburg and begin again but i think it's the month of april we start in the scandinavian countries in norway and sweden and and finland and and holland and switzerland and germany and through europe there so be in prayer for us we have a few meetings here christmas time now right after christmas by the way we want to be here through christmas at home the kids wants to come home through christmas and we we love arizona but you know the thing that we miss and just can't get over it is this church and you people no matter where we go what we do it's just kids me wife and all there's just no place like this that's right there's just no place i've sailed with seven seas and i i've been everywhere but there's no place that seems hallowed to me like this little spot right here yes just get away from it once if you want to there's just something about here i've preached all over the world frankly now i've never any time any place ever felt the spirit of god with freeness and things like i do standing right here this is it god let it it's the day i laid that cornerstone over there i said lord god don't let it fall people said in a two months it'll be a garage i said don't let it fall lord let it be standing and people in here praising you when jesus returns i trust it'll be that way now uh let us turn in the bible now and and expect the lord to give us of his blessings and we want to read some scriptures i got some scriptures wrote down here that i want to refer to and some notes and i want to read out of three places out of the bible and i'll give them to you first i want to read in jude five and six jude's just one book you know and then i want to read second peter the second chapter four and five now i want to read first peter 3 18-20 and my subject this morning the lord willing is souls that are in prison now souls that are in prison now shut up forever condemned never no way of being saved see souls that have been imprisoned now now let's read over in the book of jude first i believe i have mark down here for the first place in jude and then over in second peter and then um oh then over first peter now jude uh would like to read it all but just to save time because it's 10 30 already i'm going to begin with the fifth verse now jude was a brother foster brother of jesus christ as we all know he was joseph's son i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not saved them first brought them out of egypt and then had to destroy them because they didn't continue with their message you see and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting change on chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day angels which once stayed in heaven and kept not their estate and the way that they were in fell away and now is an eternal chains of darkness everlasting chains of darkness kept in this condition until the judgment of the great day when they'll be judged with all the rest of the unbelievers now in second peter the second chapter beginning with the fourth verse which will be just a book or two behind it for if god spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved into judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah and eight persons a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly spared not the angels put them in chains of darkness and condemned the whole world by the destruction of of noah now in first peter the first chapter and the first peter the third chapter and beginning with the 18th verse we read again now listen close now for christ also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit but to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison he preached to these people in prison which sometimes were disobedient when once the long suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water like figure warranty even baptism does also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answering of a good conscience towards god by the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him let's pray again now heavenly father such a a line of scripture here three witnesses three places in the scripture giving testimony and thou hast said in thy word that in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established now i pray thee o god that thou will come to the people and will interpret this word this message in the light that it should be in that every man woman boy or girl might understand in the capacity that you have ordained for them to understand him and now knowing that these three witnesses bear record of truth and i pray that you will send the holy spirit upon us now and we'll look to him who is our king in our midst this morning the lord jesus christ where we have raised now by faith sitting in these heavenly places in him we wait for his message speaketh through us lord hear it through us as we ask you to circumcise the lips that speak and the ears that hear that it might be to the honor and glory of him who is the scripture for we asked it in his name amen now remember the services tonight a healing service i don't think it'd be necessary to give out prayer cards so we just pray for the sake i have something i want to tell you and i i hope that it'll just bring the congregation into a place to where there'll just be all kinds of healing i know it will be if we'll just believe it that way now this souls now in prison souls that are now in prison now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's uh the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hitting god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is uh is god if you're born again if it's not it's out of the world anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when god breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then but when you that nature that was in you by nature you was of the world alienated from god you were actually an animal that's exactly right anyone knows that we're a mammal how many knows that we we are mammal we are a warm a blooded animal but that is what we are by our earthly creation but you see what made us different from other mammals that god put a soul upon us see now the other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us we're the only ones that because we have a soul but see god in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the earth and brought up all kinds of animals from the very lowest to the highest and the highest animal come forth was man and then first man was made he was a spirit man in the image of god which god is a spirit saint john 4. now he is a a spirit and they that worship him worship him in spirit and in truth and thy word is the truth now we worship him his spirit and truth he is a a spirit being [Music] [Music] actually there's a helicopter and drop you in that's the only way that we can possibly get you there but i would love to go now this is the the old church building that they had and all the congregation met together in that church building just to show you where it is it's right in the center and again i can't i can't do this the uh right in the center where the word tanzania is you see there's no roads there's no cities this is just jungle wilderness area conservation areas where a lot of the animals roman tribal people live so this is very primitive many people who live here live in houses that are built in the ground in the dirt and and they're probably four or four and a half feet tall and they keep all their animals in there overnight every night because people will steal their animals and these are very very primitive people well let me introduce you to somebody who's in that uh village uh these are the this is uh the brother on your on your left uh his brother elias palangio and he's the pastor in arusha there and the other brother is brother theo and he is a missionary of missionaries he travels in very remote remote parts of the world of this world we bought three motorcycles for the missionaries there and they just crisscrossed the country they were they wrote me and said they traveled through a game reserve by motorbike for seven hours on bad or no roads many times there are no roads that go there and so this is the inside of the church at gungah and they wanted to go and visit the saints there because they hadn't been there in a long time there's seven people in this picture and two children and there's another sister who's not in the picture right here but that's the church in gungah they don't have a pastor and so they do the very best they can they said little bible studies and sometimes they'll read a book or they'll listen to a tape that's all they have unless the missionaries come through so it's very difficult for them in that part of the world to have any type of regular services at all i asked brother elias he's getting ready to preach there and i asked him what it's like to preach in that church he said well there's two things he said you don't want to stand up quickly as you'll bang your head and he said the second thing is you pray it doesn't rain because if it rains everybody goes home and they wait until the rain stops and then they come back again and finish the service that's just the way that it is let me introduce you to sister maria sister maria ese is the sister on the right and the red over here and she is married to a man who is a who was a muslim and he was a polygamist had several wives and this is him right here he's considered a wealthy man in that village because he owned two cows and had his own house now sister maria because they're considered on the wealthy side in that village she for a number of uh a number of years would just glean in the field she was truly was a gleaner and would gather the stubble that's left over and sell it in the marketplace and save up her funds now the interesting thing about sister maria is that she was a muslim as well and she has relatives who live in another part of tanzania who are in the message and she didn't know anything about that but one one a couple of years ago she decided to go and visit those relatives who were in the message in another part of tanzania and when she went they witnessed to her it was just the right time and the right word given to her and she just embraced the message she was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and she believes the message just like you do so she left home a muslim one of the wives of a polygamist and came back a believer well the family back home obviously i mean your reaction is is i mean you you've reacted but you can imagine how they must have reacted because here now she is talk carrying a bible she's talking about a prophet she's talking about the end time and all the things like we would believe she's witnessing those things back home and so the family says well the only thing we can do to straighten this situation out is to kill her so the first thing they did was to fill her cook stove with explosive gas they have a burning gas and then they have an explosive gas and sister maria was back home she didn't know they did this but they figured it would explode and kill her and she had her hand on the knob to turn on her little stove and she just she just felt no it's not going to do it she took the gas canister outside and unscrewed it and she smelled it immediately and it was full of explosive gas and so she just poured it out so the family said all right we have our we have another way to do it and we'll just poison her now let me assure you in that part of the world they know how to poison people all right they still have blow darts and they still have poison tip arrows they know how to stop an elephant in their tracks and they know how to poison somebody they watch sister maria ingest poison and it never affected her it never affected her naturally then they became afraid and they said we better leave her alone so they just let her be [Applause] sister maria in her gleaning she wanted to have a bigger church for her community she wanted to have something a little bit more reputable because you know it's nice when ministers come to have a nice place like you have here and it's also you know in the village people would mock them because they had a little church made of sticks and they said is your god only this big that he can make a church this big made of sticks and so she wanted to have a church for the for the local body there so she would gather gleanings from the field and sell them and buy bricks she would just save up the bricks and over time by herself she managed to hire a bricklayer and build this by herself just gleaning in the fields so when brother elias told me this story and showed me this picture i said oh okay you need money to finish the church put a roof on there i said it's no problem we could probably help you do that and he said no he said sister maria sent a message to you through me and she said don't worry about the church we built this much we'll finish the rest we don't need money for the church we want you to send money to bring ministers into this village because even if we have a church or we don't have a church or we have a roof or we don't have a roof none of that's going to give us rapturing faith it's the word that gives us rapturing faith and she said we want we want a minister to come and preach to us so if brother bear is going to send any funds send them to the missionaries who can come on their motorbikes and come in and preach for us that's really what we want until god raises up a pastor well i told this story enough around that you know people sent money and they decided to go ahead and put the roof on there so we've got a fund set up so the missionaries travel in there on a regular basis and uh the uh the the church now uh was being completed and they were just so excited about that so now this is the picture at the end of the story if you look over on your right there's the old church so now we've got a skyscraper i mean in goonga this is a skyscraper folks this is this is like uh i mean this is like the mall of america this in terms of size but they're just excited and but here's the thing as brother branham said you know the things that were at the beginning they're repeated at the end so as a result of this now uh the whole village is standing back and looking at this and saying wow they do serve a real god a living god who's able to turn that little thing into something great like this and this is the end of the story this is sister maria's husband the muslim being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] [Music] i love to tell that story because it's just a great complete little story testimony and uh you know their hearts were just so set not on having a fancy building but they just wanted to have the gospel preached and and that was their desire and i thought wow those are the kind of people you love to help we'll probably never meet the people from gunga on this side of eternity but when you get there i'll guarantee you they'll be over there seven or eight of them i believe they'll all be over there on the other side [Music] you
