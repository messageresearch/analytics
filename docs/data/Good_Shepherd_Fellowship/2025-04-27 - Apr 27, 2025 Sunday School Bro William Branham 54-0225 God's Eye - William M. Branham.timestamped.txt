[0:18] And that is but the Holy Spirit
[0:21] all through the audience now and the
[0:25] angels of the Lord
[0:31] present. I was reading a scripture this
[0:34] afternoon while
[0:36] studying in the book of the Psalms.
[0:40] And I wish to read it just for a moment
[0:43] a few verses of it especi I'll say two
[0:47] verses that's the 32nd Psalm the seventh
[0:51] and eth
[0:55] verse. Thou art my hiding
[0:59] place. I love that David speaking that
[1:04] God is his hiding place. How uh
[1:10] love to think that we have a hiding
[1:14] place that God's great
[1:17] presence can be our hiding place where
[1:20] we can hide from the things of the world
[1:23] and when trouble arrives he's our hiding
[1:27] place and in the eth verse he said and I
[1:31] will guide thee with mine
[1:35] eye was thinking
[1:38] God speaking there, how he would guide
[1:41] us with his
[1:44] eye and to know that his presence is
[1:48] ever
[1:48] near
[1:51] and he does guide
[1:54] us. Now I was thinking how becoming that
[1:58] scripture is to the true servant of
[2:00] Christ in St. John
[2:03] 5:19 or when he says, "Verily, verily, I
[2:06] say unto you, the Son can do nothing in
[2:10] himself, but what he sees the Father
[2:13] doing, that doeth the Son
[2:16] likewise." The great eye of
[2:20] Jehovah, Jesus was looking through his
[2:24] eyes.
[2:26] It must have been Jehovah's eyes that he
[2:29] was looking through
[2:31] when Simon came
[2:34] up and he told him that his name was
[2:37] Simon and he was going to change it to
[2:41] Cphus and told him his father's name was
[2:46] Jonah. It just had to be God's eye that
[2:51] he was looking through.
[2:53] God's eye has been with the prophets
[2:56] through the ages that could see ahead of
[2:59] time what was going to
[3:02] happen. It could been nothing else but
[3:05] God's
[3:06] eye when Nathaniel was brought by
[3:10] Philillip into his presence and Jesus
[3:13] said to him behold an
[3:17] Israelite and he said when did you know
[3:19] me rabbi? He said before Philillip
[3:23] called you when you were under the tree
[3:25] I saw
[3:26] you. It must have been God's eye that he
[3:30] was looking
[3:32] through. It must have been God's eye in
[3:36] St. John 4 when he seen the woman have
[3:39] five husbands.
[3:43] It was God's eye that he was looking
[3:45] through when he the woman touched his
[3:48] garment and virtue had gone from him and
[3:51] he looked over his audience until he
[3:54] found the woman and knew what her
[3:56] trouble
[3:58] was. It could have been nothing else but
[4:01] looking through God's eye when he
[4:03] perceived the thoughts of the Pharisees
[4:05] when they said, "You are Beelzeub." in
[4:09] their
[4:10] hearts. It was God's eye that he was
[4:13] looking through when he perceived the
[4:15] thoughts of the disciples when they said
[4:18] reasoning who would be the greatest
[4:19] among
[4:23] them. It was God's eye that he was
[4:26] looking through when he went out into
[4:28] the pool of Bethesda and looked around
[4:31] to find a man on a
[4:33] pallet and knew that he had been in that
[4:35] condition for 38 years.
[4:39] And what a consolation it is in our
[4:42] scripture reading last night that we
[4:44] found that Jesus said the scriptures
[4:47] cannot be
[4:49] broken. And then when Jesus went away
[4:54] and that great eye of God that was to
[4:57] guide he promised the things that I do
[5:01] the works that I do shall you
[5:04] also. And that guiding eye wasn't to
[5:09] be gone at the going of the Lord
[5:13] Jesus. He was to continue forever in his
[5:16] church.
[5:19] And when he rose on the third
[5:22] day and ascended up on high and sent the
[5:26] Holy Spirit back, that the church
[5:28] tonight looks through that same guiding
[5:32] eye that guides his people to all
[5:37] truth and he is truth. And how happy we
[5:42] are tonight to know that that scriptures
[5:44] cannot be broken. And know that that
[5:46] same ah that will guide us is in our
[5:50] presence
[5:51] tonight or we are in its presence
[5:54] tonight. That shall guide us from
[5:57] sickness unto
[5:59] hell. That shall guide us from our
[6:01] afflictions to the
[6:03] [Music]
[6:04] cross. that will guide us
[6:07] from
[6:09] affliction to good
[6:13] health. That will guide us from a sinful
[6:15] life to a saint set aside life in God.
[6:21] That presence of God is ever near. Jesus
[6:26] said, "Lo, I am with you always, even to
[6:29] the
[6:30] end." And we're nearing the
[6:33] end. And as Jesus
[6:36] confirmed that guiding eye being with
[6:40] him in the days when he revealed himself
[6:44] to the Jews before the ending of that
[6:47] church age for the Jews or their
[6:50] dispensation, he manifested it by
[6:53] looking through the eye of God. He did
[6:56] the same thing to the
[6:57] Samaritans. And now we got the Gentiles
[7:00] left. And tonight, God still looks
[7:04] through that same eye because Christ is
[7:06] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[7:10] And he still looks through the eye of
[7:12] God as he can with his grace and
[7:16] sanctifying power cleanse us and has
[7:19] called us to be his sons and daughters
[7:21] to use us as the vines or the branches
[7:25] in the vines to still look through the
[7:27] eye of God to see what has been and what
[7:30] will be. And we will not walk in
[7:33] darkness as long as we look through
[7:35] God's eye. God's eye reflects his will.
[7:39] reflects his spirit, reflects his word.
[7:44] What good would it do with all of our
[7:47] training? What good would it do with all
[7:50] of our teaching and our
[7:52] theology if there wasn't something to
[7:55] keep us even
[7:56] keel? What good would it do a ship to
[7:59] have great sails and great fine boughs
[8:02] and sterns and pockets in
[8:04] it? A great compass on the inside if it
[8:08] didn't have a
[8:10] rudder. What if it had neither compass
[8:12] nor rudder? It would just be drove about
[8:15] with the winds from place to
[8:18] place. But we're thankful that God has
[8:21] both rudder and compass.
[8:25] He lets us know where we're standing
[8:26] today and what we'll be. He'll He said,
[8:29] "I will never leave thee. I will never
[8:32] forsake thee." So, let us look through
[8:35] the eye of God tonight and we will see
[8:38] that he'll lead us to
[8:39] Calvary. And at
[8:41] Calvary, everything was finished. He was
[8:46] wounded for our transgressions. With his
[8:48] stripes, we were healed. Every sinner
[8:51] here tonight was he was saved when Jesus
[8:54] Christ died at Calvary. Every sick
[8:57] person was healed when Jesus died at
[9:00] Calvary. He finished the work. The only
[9:03] thing that God can do now is to anoint
[9:06] ministers to preach the word or set
[9:09] gifts in the church to to point you to
[9:12] the finished work of our Lord Jesus. May
[9:15] God grant it tonight. Here's my prayer
[9:17] while we pray.
[9:22] eternal and blessed
[9:24] God, who brought again the Lord Jesus
[9:27] from the
[9:29] dead and raised him up and set him at
[9:34] the right hand of the Majesty on
[9:37] high making intercessions upon our
[9:41] confession. And we come
[9:43] tonight with a confession to say that we
[9:47] believe every word that he taught us in
[9:50] his
[9:52] word. And to confess is the say the same
[9:56] thing. And we believe that he is the
[10:00] same yesterday, today, and forever that
[10:04] in his presence this year. and will
[10:06] declare him alive after 1900 years at
[10:11] the closing of this age or gentile
[10:15] dispensation. Come Lord
[10:18] God, one word from you will mean more
[10:22] than all the words that we all could
[10:25] say.
[10:27] just to see you speak with your great
[10:33] power. It would send the
[10:36] hearts into a place that they have
[10:39] perhaps never reached
[10:42] before. And it would bring faith to a
[10:46] level for the healing of the sick and
[10:49] conviction to the sinner that would
[10:52] repent of his or her sins.
[10:56] And we pray then Lord tonight that our
[10:59] bodies may be yielded to thee in such a
[11:02] perfect way that you would speak to us.
[11:08] Grant Lord these
[11:11] blessings realizing that our voice going
[11:15] through this
[11:17] microphone declares that there is
[11:20] something alive because the microphone
[11:23] would be a mute if there wasn't
[11:26] something to make a noise behind.
[11:30] And so would we be, oh
[11:33] God. But speak, Lord
[11:36] Jesus, as we yield ourself to thee for
[11:41] service. And in humility, we'll bow our
[11:45] heads and give thee praise while we call
[11:49] for thy
[11:51] presence. We have a right to do it
[11:53] because you promised you would do it.
[11:58] And you do it on those bases, not
[12:01] because you have to, but because you
[12:04] promised it. And the scriptures cannot
[12:07] be broken. They must be fulfilled.
[12:11] Therefore, Lord, we wait humbly as
[12:13] servants of yours on the manifestation
[12:16] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. For
[12:20] we ask that in his name. Amen.
[12:31] Now it depends now upon
[12:38] God. And if he will bless us by his
[12:41] presence, we shall go away with happy
[12:44] hearts like those who came from
[12:46] Emmas. If he will reveal himself to
[12:50] us, the minister has spoke. The songs
[12:53] has been sung and the prayer has been
[12:58] made. The scripture has
[13:00] been preached. Now it's God's time to
[13:05] speak. And God can't speak to her in
[13:08] this manner just and perform things
[13:12] unless somebody will be here to hear
[13:17] it. Many mighty works he could not do
[13:19] because of their unbelief. So tonight,
[13:22] may our conscience and our emotions be
[13:25] moved if he shall so bless us to come in
[13:30] in our billing here tonight and make
[13:34] yourself known that he is the lovely
[13:36] resurrected
[13:39] Jesus. Now we shall call the prayer
[13:42] line. Not too many but just a few to get
[13:44] them to the platform.
[13:46] I believe they said the prayer cards
[13:48] were prayer
[13:50] card P was giving out tonight back in
[13:54] Paul. Last night we took a group of
[13:56] them. So tonight I believe there's some
[13:58] from 50 on till something 75 or
[14:01] something last night. So let's start and
[14:04] just get a few been times fading
[14:06] fleeting fast from us.
[14:09] Let's begin and start with the 85 and go
[14:11] to
[14:12] 100 just to get someone up here. And who
[14:16] holds prayer card P85? Would you just
[14:19] raise your hand so that we could see you
[14:23] here? Maybe I got the wrong place. I
[14:27] will What's it
[14:29] P85 or the lady here? All right, lady.
[14:33] Come right down here.
[14:37] 86. Would you raise your
[14:40] hand? Prayer card
[14:43] P86. The lady, everyone's got prayer
[14:46] cards. Look in those who can't uh uh get
[14:51] up or something or can't move your hands
[14:53] or if you're Look at your neighbor's
[14:55] car. They may be deaf and
[14:57] dumb. 85 86 87
[15:04] prayer card 87 way up in the balcony.
[15:08] They're just give out all over the
[15:09] building. The boys give them out. 87
[15:12] [Music]
[15:16] 88. Oh, in the All
[15:18] right.
[15:22] 8889 prayer card P89 the lady there.
[15:26] Thank you lady for helping her. She may
[15:28] be dead.
[15:32] 8990. Would you raise your hand or can I
[15:34] see it? Someone prayer card P90. The
[15:39] lady. All right. 91.
[15:43] Prayer card P 91
[15:50] 92
[15:54] 93
[15:55] [Music]
[15:59] 94 94 All right.
[16:05] 95
[16:07] 95 prayer card T 95. Would you raise
[16:11] your hand?
[16:14] in the line
[16:19] 96. See, it may be someone coming up
[16:22] here doesn't mean you're going to be
[16:25] healed. Not by no means. You can be
[16:28] healed in your seat just the same as you
[16:31] can be healed here.
[16:33] 96 97 98 99
[16:40] 100. Now, if we can get these out in
[16:43] time, we'll start back somewhere else
[16:45] and just keep bringing them
[16:47] up. But now, coming up here doesn't mean
[16:50] that you're going to be healed. The you
[16:53] can be healed out there just the same as
[16:56] you can be healed here. God will heal
[16:59] you on the merits of your faith. And
[17:02] that
[17:06] alone, just as you believe. Now, how
[17:10] many out there does not have a prayer
[17:12] card and you want God to heal you? You
[17:16] won't be called up the platform, but you
[17:17] want God to heal you. Just raise your
[17:19] hands anywhere in the
[17:21] building. That's the reason we have to
[17:23] give out cards just to get them lined
[17:25] up. All right. You do
[17:28] this. You just look to Christ. The Bible
[17:32] said that he is a high priest that can
[17:35] be touched by the feeling of our
[17:37] infirmities. How many know that the
[17:39] Bible teaches
[17:41] that? Well, a woman touched his garment
[17:44] and he said, "I got
[17:47] weak." And she went off into the
[17:50] audience somewhere and Jesus said that
[17:54] he was weak, that virtue had gone from
[17:56] him. Then he he looked around until he
[17:59] found the
[18:01] woman. How many ever read that story?
[18:04] Well, then does the Bible say in Hebrews
[18:06] 13:8 that Jesus is the same yesterday,
[18:09] today, and forever?
[18:11] The scripture says he's still a high
[18:13] priest that can be touched by the
[18:15] feeling of our infirmities. Then you
[18:18] look tonight, not to a preacher, not to
[18:22] one of your brothers or sisters, but
[18:24] look to Calvary. Look to
[18:27] Christ who is not exactly Calvary.
[18:30] Calvary is where the price was paid. But
[18:33] Christ is away from Calvary tonight.
[18:36] He's in the presence of God, ever living
[18:39] to make intercessions upon our
[18:41] confession. The spirit of Christ is here
[18:45] in our midst
[18:47] tonight. And notice why they're lining
[18:49] the people
[18:51] up. When Christ was here on earth, he
[18:54] said, "I came from God and I go to God."
[18:59] Do you know that to be true?
[19:02] How many believe that Christ was in the
[19:04] wilderness with the children of Israel?
[19:07] That pillar of fire that led the
[19:09] children of Israel was Christ. Do you
[19:11] believe that the angel of the covenant
[19:14] was in the burning bush? He said he was
[19:17] before Abraham was I am. And I am was
[19:22] the one that spoke to Moses in the bush.
[19:26] Then God was manifested in flesh to take
[19:29] away sin which was in his son's body
[19:32] Christ because God was in Christ
[19:35] reconciling the world to himself. He
[19:37] expressed himself through
[19:40] Christ and Christ said I come from God
[19:44] from the pillar of fire and I returned
[19:47] back in that condition. After his death,
[19:50] burial, and resurrection, Paul met him
[19:53] on the road to Damascus, and he was
[19:57] again back into light. How many knows
[20:01] that's
[20:03] true? Well, any spirit will bear record
[20:06] of
[20:08] itself. Any life will bear record. A
[20:11] life of a, as I have said before, a life
[20:13] of a pumpkin vine will bear life bear
[20:16] pumpkins. Grapes will bear grapes. Jesus
[20:20] said, "I'm the vine. You're the
[20:22] branches. The life that's in you, if I
[20:24] told you the spirit of an outlaw was in
[20:27] me, you'd expect me to have big guns and
[20:29] be dangerous." If I told you the spirit
[20:32] of an artist was in me, I would be able
[20:34] to paint the pictures that the artist
[20:36] painted. And if we say the spirit of
[20:39] Christ is in us, we do the things that
[20:42] Christ did. Amen.
[20:45] Think the picture here not of me. I have
[20:50] nothing to do with it at all. It's
[20:53] Christ expressing himself to his people.
[20:57] Then if this this being photographed
[20:59] here in Germany and different places and
[21:02] before the great man even FBI examined
[21:06] the picture, George J.
[21:09] And if it was proven to be a
[21:11] supernatural being and it looks like the
[21:14] same pillar of
[21:16] fire, then it was Christ still with his
[21:20] church. I'll never leave thee nor
[21:22] forsake thee. Then the works that I do
[21:25] shall you also. It'll do the same kind
[21:27] of works he did if it's the spirit of
[21:30] Christ. If it isn't the spirit of
[21:32] Christ, it won't do those works.
[21:35] upon this. Let us
[21:42] say, are you the lady that's to be
[21:44] prayed for? I want to know how many in
[21:47] the building that would raise your hands
[21:49] that I do not know you. Let's see your
[21:51] hands. Everybody in the bill in the
[21:53] prayer line, too, that I do not know
[21:56] you. Here's a picture of the Bible. Now,
[22:00] remember, the Bible was written by the
[22:03] Holy Spirit.
[22:05] And the spirit that wrote the Bible
[22:08] still lives. He doesn't get any
[22:10] different. He doesn't know any more
[22:13] today than he knows then because he was
[22:15] infant to begin with. And if God did
[22:18] anything in the beginning, and if the
[22:21] same circumstances rises again and if he
[22:23] acts different than what he did in the
[22:25] beginning, he acted wrong when he
[22:27] acted. He's got to remain the same. He
[22:31] doesn't get smarter like we do because
[22:34] he was he was infant to begin
[22:37] with. And the Bible is a both a
[22:43] history, it is a prophet, it's a love
[22:48] story and it portrays Christ to us. Then
[22:53] if the Christ of the Bible is not dead
[22:56] but alive, he's got to manifest himself
[22:59] just like he did in the
[23:01] Bible. Now, here's a
[23:03] woman, the dear beloved person is I
[23:07] never seen her. She looks about the age
[23:09] of my
[23:10] mother. I never seen her in my life. And
[23:14] we are totally strange to each other.
[23:17] And here is a
[23:19] picture of the a Bible scene like it was
[23:23] in St. John the 4th chapter when a man
[23:26] and woman Jesus at the well with the
[23:30] woman and he spoke to her. Now notice he
[23:35] was on his road to Jericho but need go
[23:37] by Samaria. Why? He just said in St.
[23:40] John 5, I do nothing till the father
[23:43] shows me first. Do you believe that
[23:45] scripture?
[23:47] Then he never performed one miracle
[23:48] without God showing him
[23:52] first. Verily, verily, I say to you, the
[23:54] son can do nothing in himself, but what
[23:56] he sees the father doing, that doeth the
[24:00] son likewise.
