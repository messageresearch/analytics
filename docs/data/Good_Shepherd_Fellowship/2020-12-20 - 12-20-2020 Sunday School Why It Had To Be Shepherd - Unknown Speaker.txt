========================================

[Music] man Ador Emmanuel in a stable the most and there were people out there at the same days teaching their theology great crowds drawing everywhere from all over the land they come to sacrifices which Jehovah said was a stench in his nostrils and here was humbl Shepherds in a stable adoring Emmanuel God himself made flesh and land in a stable see how we with our great learnings and our head sticking back like we know something and God bypasses the whole thing he does what he promises to do and he always does that but think of these lowly Shepherds out there now adoring a Emmanuel in a stable it's most striking sure is then out at they had adored him and realized that the message that they had been preaching was Vindicated there they were out praising God with the most incredible message of an Angel I'll compare that with today just stop a minute and think man out adoring God and praising him for what they had seen what they had heard what they knew was the truth with a message that was incredible to the intellectual mind it was contrary to all ecclesiastical thinking and yet it was a truth it's the truth they believe it and now how foolish can the wisdom of man be then saying that an angel choir sang to them the first noil could you imagine that that a Shepherd That Couldn't Write his name smelling like a sheep pen walking down the street Hing glory to God in the highest we know that he's on Earth the priest said that man's out of his mind look up on the books and see if he's a member of our congregation he certainly embarrasses Us by un ethical teachings get him away from us we will not be embarrassed amongst the people well you can be embarrassed amongst the people and glorified in the sight of God or take your choice because remember the ecclesiastical tastes of the day don't fit God's word there's not no 969 different tastes of it it's one taste one word one God that's all saying that Angels sang The First Noel to him and also sing that uh they got a message from an angel an angel appeared to give him a message and they went and found out that message was truth and say besides that the angel sing the first oil to us could you imagine they said that poor fell they never had anything like that to happen among them you know so it was kind of strange Doctrine to them that's the reason they couldn't find it in the Scriptures it wasn't for him to find it incredible to the wise no such experience had ever happened to them unbelievable but still it was the truth it's the truth we know it's the truth think Christ first Converse and first congregation was Sheep Man not clergy man Sheep Man herders wow Shepherds notice out praising and glorifying God for what they had seen and heard heard Angels Sing for their first time to a human being Angels Are Never sing to human being before and look at the choirs how they had stood and trained and trained those voices they had sang at the birth of the Messiah and they were all bypassed and Angels came down and sang to Common Sheep Man not with clergy clothes on but with Shepherd's clothes on and look who got the first message is incredible and where it was given not in the cathedrals but in the wilderness out in the wilderness where the angel of the Lord came not in the church in the wilderness he wasn't even welcome in the church they thought he was they thought they had it but God proved that it was wrong he's able these stones to rise children to Abraham that's right the first time Angels ever sang at a celebration it was in heaven if you look in job 38:7 I to see some of you taking notes when God first planned on making his first creation the Earth job was a great smart man and he had all kinds of wisdom he said when I go up to the markets the young princes they all bow before me in just want a moment of my wisdom and he couldn't figure out why he had to be treated the way he was and so God asked him said g yourself up like a man because I'm coming down to talk to you and when God came down in a horor wind he said job where was you before I laid the foundations of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you then job and he was deflated at that time where was you see the first time Angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven but the first time they ever sang on Earth was the Shepherds at the birth of God Emmanuel on Earth first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble Shepherds when we take our painted faed women bobbed hair wearing shorts and swing some kind of a church robe around him and stand up and sing like something and then we think if God has to listen to that he he got Angels back on who can entertain him sense before he ever made a human being get out and live and wear clothes that's an Abomination to God and how can you expect that to be of God you say well I belong to where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth tell me where I fasten them to where is the axle that they turn on where were you then you think God has to ask us for some of our wisdom our wisdom is only foolish to him he does what he says he will do now notice God is fixing to make another creation he creating mortal Earth mortal life Angels sing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he sing to his objects through Angels on the earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life see and he saying they sing to the heavens when the Mortal creation come in and here the immortal creation is coming in and now they're singing to Earthly people the first time the Shepherds striking isn't it he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the Bible said in the beginning of the creation of God God was created in human Farm in Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a house to live in it so he could respect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ remember there is always singing at the birth of a king how many know that of course you did well now do you think of this king would have been born down there a a woman would have come run into the cathedral somewhere and said make a bed ready right quick and get the doctors because I'm going to bring Emanuel to the earth a poor woman out of Nazareth the lowest city the meaner than Tucson or any the rest of them and yet this little woman comes running up there to the great high priest and said I'm fixing to give birth to you man know that throw her in jail you sure would they certainly would such a hares is that to be brought amongst his people he wouldn't have stood for it nether would he today but just the same is happening just the same notice there has to be singing Kings would he wouldn't have been sing to the people wouldn't have sang to him because they didn't believe him that's the reason here it comes you might as well get it that's the reason today the people's ashamed to praise God they're ashamed of Christ the great Cathedrals won't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're so set in their ecclesiastical ways that they will not receive it God's going to find somebody that he can get praised through He's Able of the stones to rise children to Abraham as I quote John again notice his subjects must sing to him and his subjects then was his angels and they sang to his Shepherds which was to take his message who should hear it first of course his subjects that's who would hear the King singing first would be his subjects and what was his subjects kind he striking isn't it brother it wasn't his clergymen it wasn't the theologians that's right it wasn't the denominational people no it was Shepherds why there a sheep born that's the reason see his subjects heard it who God knew would believe God sent his message to those who would believe it he's all wisdom he knows where to send his message who will believe it the highest of Heavens sent to the lowest of man upon the Earth Jesus said in Matthew 5 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is a kingdom of heaven marry and if you're putting scriptures down that's Matthew 5 and if you're putting scriptures down what I have written here scriptures Mary said in luke2 when she was anointed with the spirit the Holy Ghost upon her she said he has exalted them of low degree Mary said that the mother of Jesus said he has exalted those of low degree Luke also said the Common People heard him gladly not the the elite the the theologians the doctors of the law and of divinity but the Common People heard him gladly people of low degree throughout all Sacred Scriptures the message of redemption has been given by Shepherds and through sheep I have to come to a close because we're getting time to close I'm bypassing many scriptures just so I can get you to this thought throughout all scripture Redemption has been represented through Shepherds and sheep that's right we all agree that why it was in Shadow and tight and anything if I never had seen my hand and I look down here at my hand Shadow and I see I had five fingers I would know that it was reflecting the negative was reflecting a positive and that's why the message always came to uh Redemption by sheep because calls from the very beginning and it was through sheep and by Shepherds that he revealed himself all was shadows and TI now let us look at the beginning Adam and Eve standing there in the presence of God to hear his message to them they had greated about their loins the skin of sheep the first message was ever heard was given over the top of a dead sheep that God had slew and wrapped Adam and Eve in him after they tried to make their own religion of fig leaves it wouldn't work sheep sacrifice has been instituted for atonement since the very beginning sheep sacrifice now we're going to close this off now and show you why it had to be Shepherds and why it had to be he had to be a sheep now the prophets of the Old Testament graped themselves in sheep skins we know that uhhuh signifying their faith in his word word of the coming perfect lamb that's why the prophets now the word of God does not come to a theologian there's no he he's one messes it up that's right there's no such a thing as ever seeing you say well this guy's a theologian that just puts him farther away from the word than anything I know of the word of the Lord God the unchanging God never does change anywhere in the Bible the word of God always way did come to prophets am not to theologians or doctors the prophets and they always every time was refused and rejected prophets was usually herdsman also prophets graped themselves in sheep skins because they wore the skin of the sheep they were hurden and the first message to A A A condemned generation was over the top of sheep skins prophets I say again wor sheep skins raped around themselves because they were testifying by that that they believed that there was coming a perfect lamb for that sacrifice and the word of the god came to them over the top of sheep skins these herdsmen or these prophets usually were herdsmen Abraham was a herdsman Isaac was a herdsman Jacob was a herdsman Moses was a herdsman David was a herdsman amen all of God's Representatives usually were herdsmen now we're going to find out why it come to Shepherds they knew the Sheep is helpless without the shepherd to guide them they a sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot go by himself that's the reason God likened his believing children un sheep they've got to be guided but watch what's guiding you don't get a goat amen he'll walk you to the slaughter pin God never give us a goat he gave us his son the holy spirit to guide us he is our God not some manmade herdsman but a god-given herdsman who feeds the Sheep upon sheep food now you take a pig and you say to this pig I'm going to make you a lamb and you washing and you paint his toenails and and so forth and give him food like a sheep uh give him uh some kind of a a dive and put him out on the floor or out in the where the the Sheep her in the alaly field or something and if there's a mud hole anywhere that hog will go just as straight to that mud hole as he can go why is because his nature is still a hog and that's the reason that church members today indulge in the things of the world see is because their nature hasn't been changed they'll eat any kind of a ecclesiastical theological sloth that's right but the word of God they can't stand it they'll go in and listen to the word you know the biggest hypocrite in the world is a old crow in the Bible there were two let out of the Ark the old crow went out and he never did return because he's a vulture a scavenger he set on the bodies of the dead carcasses and filled his belly with the dead carcass but when he turned the dove out the dove could not stand that stench so she returned back to Father's house and Noah and beat at the door until Noah let her in now a crow can s out are and eat on a dead horse all day and fly out there in the field and eat grain with a dove but a dove cannot fly over there eat on the dead horse and then eat grain it to kill him see the dove don't have any Gall and he can't digested and when any Dove of God any word eaten Dove or sheep a clean beast when you go to give them the things of the world they know their master that he that loves a world of the things of the world the love of God's not even in him you give him something contrary to that word of God he cannot stand it amen but the devil can take that in the world too and call it all God you can't mix oil and water it just won't mix they all these Shepherds they knew the Sheep was helpless without the shepherd and they were shepherds and knew that he must be guided what a Pity it is the seed that a that they try to feed sheep slop but but a sheep won't eat it no sir see they was trying to feed sheep back there slop and when the word come they've been so used to slop they didn't know the word that's what it is today when the same thing Vindicated and prove that God would do a certain thing then they s used to slop and slop fed to you well there no talking to them they just won't listen to it that's all the dog Bible said as a dog returns to its vomit and a hog to its Waller so to they hear the word and go back right through the same old water and say oh it's fanaticism don't believe such a thing as that God sheep uh does the same today they must trust in the word diet they will not take any other diet you can't give them an ecclesiastical diet the real sheep no no you go tell them I look we'll all be together now Jesus prayed that we all might be one you just heard the same thing in Tucson not long ago if days ago but it's a lie Jesus never prayed how do he how can you make the word condemn itself backfire on itself then God's more than any other man Jesus said how can two walk together L they be agreed how you go take Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic and throw it all together and be one you might be one under a man's head but Jesus said that they might be one even as as I and you are one now he wants us all to be one in him which is the word amen there it is one with the father and the father is the son is the same and it's the same word the word manifested display itself in this day as it did in any other day that you might be one notice he said as the father sent me so sent I you the father that sent him went in him to confirm the word and the same Jesus that sends his people goes in the people that he sends and saying the works that I do shall you do also sure he prayed that we might be one one with him not one with an organization not one with a system but one with God or God in his word is one and Jesus and God was one and you and I and the word must be one that's right we must be one in agreement with the word now what somebody else says is this no private interpretation take it what it says and believe it and God will vindicate it prove that's right you think it's just for disciples only take his word for it go try it once and see you'll find out that it will work for you just the same as he promised yes sir they won't eat on sloth they have to have a sheep died St John 10 declares that my sheep know my voice and if he is the word then what kind of voice does he have my sheep know my voice strangers they will not follow see Jesus said a strange voice they would not follow so his sheep doesn't follow strangers voice they won't follow prophets Shepherds and sheep all testify of the coming now I see the unchanging God in his unchanging plans of his word this day now just think a few minutes the unchanging word now look if if Moses would have come with Noah's message it wouldn't have worked if John the Baptist would have come with Moses message it wouldn't work if Jesus would have come with Moses R Noah's message it wouldn't work and Wesley come with Luther's message it wouldn't work if the Pentecost come with the Wesley message it wouldn't work we just heard that testified now God just keeps moving just watch the word you see where we're at then why should not the Shepherds first announcement if all these prophets all these great men were shepherds then why should God the unchanging one change his method right here and bring it to theologians it was Shepherds the arrival of the perfect lamb the sin offering should come to the shepherd the shepherd knows the Sheep better than anyone else there's no one knows a sheep Like a Shepherd he's trained to it also new knew what kind of food they would eat they he knew what the Sheep would eat and he knows his sheep are what they eat but you see a sheep go out to slop pen and start eating slop you'd say get that scavenger away see amen so God knew where to S them now let us call one of Jehovah's great Shepherd prophets to confirm that God was in these prophets under this sheep skin watch now we will call first Moses let's look at him his ministry will show us Jehovah in his Shepherd Prophet now we'll just take maybe one if we have time for about next 10 minutes we'll take two of them but maybe this one will be all right Moses Jehovah displays himself here in this Shepherd prophet he was given three gifts to vindicate his ministry and calling to the Elders of Israel and to to Pharaoh notice this Shepherd Prophet now he give always His prophets the supernatural sign to vindicate that it was God in them for there cannot be the presence of God without Supernatural things happening never did Jehovah ever appear without Supernatural folling it has to be so he always Vindicated himself that he was with these prophets by confirming what they were prophesying of if it was according to his words now the first the first sign he gave to the this Prophet Shepherd look turn his Rod to a serpent second his hand turned to leprosy third to take water out of the Nile river in Egypt and turn it to blood now he giv him three signs to vindicate to Egypt and also to Israel that he he was God's spoken word am now remember Moses called into creation that's right picked up sand and throw it up in the air and said let fleas come and fleas came so let flies come and flies come let frogs come and frogs come he brought into creation Now a man cannot create but it wasn't man to begin with it was Jehovah and his Prophet Shepherd amen watch the third sign he giving was not related to his occupation nor either was it related to his person his third sign notice the first two signs related to him his and his occupation and they was the only two signs that the Bible says that had a voice the other sign didn't have a voice but the two signs that was given from his own person and to his people had voices but the third sign I notice it was given the sign the third sign was a sign of death water turning to blood if your if your uh if your blood would turn to water then you would die and where there's blood shed blood is a sign of death so it was to Pharaoh the third was to turn the Niles water into blood was to show uh to show uh his message to Pharaoh that our God is God over the Nile over the god of the Nile he's God over everything and he's going to bring death to that Nation that's what the sign of blood was oh my direct sign of death blood but the other two had voices of Prophecy I I hope you're reading now between lines I'm saying it but the other two signs had voices of Prophecy to Israel concerning their future now to you that's up on the mountain not long ago when The Rock was through up now and going he was going to change nature to make it work for them watch the pole watch the serpent watch the Red Sea and whatever that he did now look at that Shepherd's uh gold making a way for them to go that stick that was in the shepherd's hand bypassed every bit of Theology and all the things a priest had said and that Shepherd's Rod LED them right on down through every impossible thing to man when Pharaoh tried to think that the cataracts erupted up in the mountains and thrilled the water then made it turn into blood then God reigned fire out of heaven and he reigned hail out of heaven and he and he reigned Li upon the Earth in everything what did he do by that Shepherd's staff not a a textbook not a theologian idea but a shepherd's staff we're coming to it in a minute a Shepherd staff did it not a a denominational prayer book but a Shepherd staff Shepherd's Rod guiding his sheep making the way clear as they went towards the promised word in the land what a beautiful thing that is today of the shepherd staff today guiding his sheep to the promised land bypassing all Theology and everything else of this world the things of the world the denominations everything opening up the way of proving his word to be the truth the shepherd staff going ahead and notice that same Shepherd staff that was guiding the Sheep you believe that he certainly did guide the Sheep he delivered them out of Egypt with that staff in his hand we can say much more about it but hit the highlights he guided the sheep and sent judgment upon the rejecting of the same staff that become a blessing to one become a curse to the others the same Waters of Noah's preaching that saved him condemned the world the same staff that led Israel to the promised land condemn those who refuse to follow the prophet Shepherd that's right become a stick of judgment nature notice how God speaks in his nature we just had time a old there God speaking his nature we Haven time to prove it but proving later by the brass serpent on the shepherd's sheep go [Music]
