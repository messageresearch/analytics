and uh i thought i'd maybe teach it to the congregation this morning it has a little story that goes behind it old brother gerald hughes down in columbia south carolina has been pastor for as far back as i can remember probably for 45 years and in his church he had a song leader brother neil storm and brother neal when he was younger had had an accident and actually had to have half of his arm actually amputated but he didn't let that slow him down here he was this long leader wonderful song leader and he would he when he gets stirred up he would take the tambourine with his good arm and bang it on the stump of his other arm and uh his wonderful brother but there was a song that he sang and for some reason this is the one i was thinking about this morning i know i wondered i said where'd this come from and thought about it um but as the story goes he got up to lead songs and he kind of just looked around looked around there and he started singing i'm going to praise the lord while i have this chance i'm going to praise the lord while i have this chance i'm gonna praise the lord while i have this chance for i may not have this chance anymore well i'm gonna praise the lord while i have this chance i need to praise the lord while i have a chance i'm gonna praise the lord while i had this chance for i may not have this chance anymore gonna sing and chow well i'm gonna sing and child while i have this chance i'm gonna sing and child while i have this chance i'm gonna sing a child while i have this chance well i may not have this chance anymore i'm gonna run and dance i'm gonna run and dance while i have this chance while i have the chance going to run and dance bro i may not have the chance for i may not have this chat anymore all that's singing now i'm going to praise the lord why i have this chance i'm going to praise the lord while i have a chance i'm going to praise the lord while i have this chance or i may not have this chance anymore i'm gonna

chance for i may not have this chance and the people all said amen amen you know we don't know our prophet said that one day they turn this these buildings and church buildings into a storehouse and so we want to praise the lord while we have this chance so amen [Music] so we're going to go ahead and change your to the service have brother blante come reach out and touch the lord [Music] he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he is past sing by this moment your needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he goes by reach out and touch the lord as he passes by oh lord you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts dry [Music] your needs to survive reach out and touch the lord as he goes by musicians just play that play that quietly now my mind goes back to a man a blind man blind's name was bartimaeus [Music] and he thought he was just going to be there that day just to get some alms so that he could continue to live to buy food but he heard a commotion saints have gone and he asked somebody about it and he said it's jesus he's passing by and blind bartimaeus he just began to shout and call out the name of the lord and they even tried to shut him up he was gonna let jesus pass by without stopping to touch his heart i think about the woman with the blood issues yes he was passing by there was a crowd that pressed in and she says i've just got to get there and no matter what it looked like she did whatever she had to do to press through and received her healing are we still serving the same jesus christ this morning oh my we may not physically see them yes but those those ones on their road to emmaus amen their hearts burn within them as they walk along the way and so as he breaks the bread of life to us this morning our hearts can burn within us and we can reach out so let's just sing that one more time as our brother comes reach out [Music] he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry oh jesus [Music] and touched us i see he's not too busy [Music] i see praise the lord it's going to be in the house of the lord this morning the lord bless you you may have your seat praise to the lord praise the lord we want to thank the lord for giving us this uh opportunity again to be in the house of the lord praise the lord jesus hallelujah what a wonderful what a wonderful savior we self amen amen praise the lord and uh i realized we had a list of jones birthday yesterday was aries the day after was his niece abi gelding brother wesley was on thursday and uh berskell was uh on the the eighth regime on the seventh so we want to say happy birthday to all yes jordan on the seventh thing i knew i missed i miss uh i missed there praise the lord and jordan on the seventh thing and we want to say happy birthday to each and every one of you and i think uh i pray that lord will be able to help uh to help us i think one of the the ways wonderful way that we can be able to you know i mean he's he's the one that kept us out of these years and and uh sustained us and and i think it's good for us to be able to i was just i was just thinking about that yesterday what i was you know uh praying and waiting on the lord and and different things i said with i mean with all of the house the the entire month filled with birthday and uh and yet uh i mean we were supposed to have less of uh thanksgiving and prayer requests and in one of you i think that's a good way for us to learn to celebrate our birthday and the birth date of our loved ones bringing thanksgiving bringing prayer requests praise the lord but we say happy birthday to each and every one of you amen praise the lord and i want to greet one of our young friend brother joseph moncoco it was good to have him coming to come by and visit with us i was saying a little bit about him on wednesday night and then i got into something else uh uh joseph dale was the voice of god represented there in africa and i can say that i got to know him back since uh 1990 late 1994 when i first went to the average cost and that's when i got to know him 95 95 to be exact because i went to the agriculture 94 in november but i didn't travel to to abigail until the following year 9 to 5. so i got to know him because since i was moving to the average coast i just left our little church there in in the town in in liberia that went across the border because we were planning to move because of the unrest in liberia so while we got down to to abidjan and we wanted to meet with a person in charge of the voice of god to make sure i mean we will be able to have some materials because we have very little materials those days praise the lord you see that's what i love my bible because i really started seeing the message in the pages of the bible before i even hear it on tape praise the lord so we had just few boxing so we wanted to make contact and we went down there and met brother eric and we became good friends we became good friends and uh over the years we will go down for his convention and sometimes we will visit with him i was i was telling telling joseph you know uh before his dad even got married to his mom where i knew him knew the dad and we will spend some time to his house and and at the time he was in school also uh he was a student i came to study in africa and and had the burden to start a work day so uh we will be walking from his house you know and going to church and and then uh he says he was saying to me bro sing this song uh one of them one of them you know you know then i'll start singing and we're just walking on the street you know one of them and we're going to church you know and and we we have some good time together amen we have some good time together and uh but uh it pleased the lord to so to take our brother home uh some part of last year if you remember we we announced the passing of uh brother eric moncoco last year that's uh joseph there so i thought that world okay i will i think i will i can have him come over because i mean he was small when i left you know and uh so uh i just thought of having come over and spent some time with him and he just graduated too so we say congratulations joseph and uh and he's he's he's a young preacher too so uh maybe he could preach for me this morning but we were having to come in and greet the church come on joe town god bless you everyone as the pastor said my name is joseph coco i'm the firstborn of my family actually i have a twin sister too and two little brothers so everything the pastor said is true uh it was a very close friend to my dad back in those days i was just a little kid so i have like some clues of him and my dad but when he started talking he started mentioning stuff that only like my dad knew so i realized that he was very close to him and it was it is a very blessing for me to be among you i've had time to go around brother ariel brother joseph and his wife and brother samuel chesa and some other brothers fellowshipping giving testimonies spending time talking about the lord it was very a blessing for me and even i had time to talk with the pastor too in his house and it was truly a blessing to me the lord spoke to me through him so i was very encouraged during my moment that i spent with you unfortunately i would like to leave on tuesday because i have to go to work and i have to continue my studies but i i will come i will come back in minnesota for sure god bless you [Applause] praise the lord amen uh we we just uh yeah brother sam chaser was around two he had to be preaching there in des moines but brooks is over uh in uh guyana

you know we we said that uh uh according to the scripture uh you know uh john the baptist received the holy ghost while in his mother womb and we have a scriptural proof that a dead man thrown over an

lips i gave you [Music] thank you jesus [Music] thank you musician revelation chapter 5 praise the lord revelation chapter 5 let's read about the book of redemption let's read about our inheritance praise the lord praise the lord and just like i said yesterday we had we had the opportunity to go at the hospital yesterday the my wife and myself were thinking to pastor today after the service but when i got that text from our dear sister that uh they have done some mri some scan and we're going to do one this morning to be able to finally declare that the little child was there we decided to go through the hospital and we stopped by there and and talked to the parents a little bit encourage them and uh you know just like brother brandon said you know as i was driving to the hospital i just put up uh they called the injured of the law where brother brandon was talking about those two boys that was raised in finland from the from the car accident you know and like the prophet said he was talking to the parents you know if you are christian you meet your your child on the other side amen if the lord gave him back to us you will have him here so i was i was just playing that as i went over to the hospital and i stopped there then uh went in the room uh talked to the parents a little bit and uh [Music] prayed with the child we read james chapter 5 uh verse 13. uh uh there's one's sake called the editors anoint him of oi you know how to make the parents to know that what i was doing was i was just trying to follow scriptural principle i was not uh kind of for performing anything that was out of order so i had to read that scripture and just tell them this is exactly what i'm i'll be doing you know so we announced the child but a strange thing took place while we were praying and one of the monitor they had on the child started to go it started to beep you know and i could tell that the mother was so anxious for the miracle as soon as we said amen she said call the doctor call i mean call the nurse call the nurse and when the nurse came and she says it was beeping it was beeping you could just tell how she was so anxious to have her baby back in her hands you know and the nurse the nurse re read that and says well yeah it was it was its temperature you know it was it was the baby temperature i think she said uh decreasing or increasing one of the two and then uh so we visited a little bit and then i left and uh and i came over here at the church and uh i just wanted to be alone a little bit and pray but i would say that uh uh having that burden on my heart to go over to the hospital you know turn out to become a blessing for me you know let's read the scripture so i won't keep you standing long revelation chapter five let's read from verse 1. and i saw in the hands of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven none in earth neither honor the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found walter to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the others said unto me weep ned behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals the seven seals thereof i want to read verse five again and one of the elders said unto me weep net behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof let's pray together father lord jesus with with heavy heart lord we come to you oh god but lord father we are so grateful to know you in the way that you have revealed yourself to us in this day lord precious lord jesus we thank you father we appreciate you lord we glorify your holy name we have just read your word and you are the altar of this word father we pray to god that you will come take your word release it to our hearts lord bless us now father the rest of the service is in your hands in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you you may have your seed all glory be to god amen this morning i want to i want to speak on uh on water what i want to use as a title i've never never been fond of making a long title like this but it's just to make sense of what i want to talk about the losing of the seals makes the bible a new book the losing of the seals make the bible a new book now the reason why i want to talk or i try to use this this as a title is is because we talked about you know brother branham used the phrase i was just looking at it in the office before i came out he used that phrase i mean many times all through the scripture of the bible being the new book and and you will realize if you go back to search that brother branham even started using that scripture before the seals were open or he started using that statement before the seals were open praise the lord glory be to god are we together amen you know that's the way we have ever been able to achieve anything in this church when we stay together praise the lord amen amen so uh just i mean just like i was saying praise the lord amen just bear with me a little bit i'm trying to brett branham says here this is 1955 he said it's not part of my quotes to be projected so you'll forgive me but i'm just trying to make a point here by reading this the bible is not a western book he says it's an eastern book and a few trips across c will let you become more acquainted and custom of what the bible and thinks he said it's a new book to you when you once live with the jewish people where the bible is written so this is back 1965 and uh faith 1965 he says the bible becomes a new book to you if you are ever in palestine in oregon country so i'm just reading this to say brother branham started making their statement before the seals were open that the bible is a new book but when the seals were open and [Music] it gave us clarity let me see like that he gave us clarity of what he meant that's right praise the lord and the reason is because many people think that when brother branham says the bible has become a new book somewhere says you know that uh uh uh you know brother branham what whatever he says you know we would take what he says than what the bible says you know someone says uh you know i no longer read the bible again because the message make the bible the new book so i read the message and leave the bible you know and and and people and and this when you study history you realize that this is not the first time there has been fanatic amen there has been financial right from time people just get fanatical idea ideas and you know and and do different things to do strange things and and by the way you know uh when i came right after the the sunday school message this morning uh it was just to be able to to help myself uh you know announce uh what what was happening since we had the church praying all through the week you know i wanted to use that time of praying to kind of settle my spirit that i would not get so emotional because uh uh uh yeah you yeah i mean you know what it is so uh that's what i decided to and i know uh you know all of you being pouring out your heart and and different ones can can relate to uh to death and especially when i saw brother wesley praying this morning and we all know that you know what that would mean to him and uh their beloved john wesley went to be with the lord from a similar situation so uh that was the reason why i came came up and decided that we just we just prayed and uh and be able to settle ourself down praise the lord you know so uh it's it's all it's part of life you know part of life we live and then we pass on when the lord turrets when our time reaches you know i was talking to young people and the laws they lost their pastor and uh and they grew up and they were going to pray and they were praying and he said they refuse you know they refuse death you know and they believe that god is going to raise him up so i was talking to one of the young man and you know trying to encourage them after i heard about it and then i told him i said i said sir i said let me tell you boy if you if you if you if you live in the night if you refuse that he's dead there is no way you can raise him up because only a dead man can be raised up you have to come to term and accept that this has happened but i believe that god can change the situation praise the lord living in denial is no way is it's a complete hindrance to god when you're living in denial when there is a reality you have to accept the reality and believe that god can change this reality to a better reality so i told him i said if you want if you want the miracle then you have to accept that he's dead [Music] praise the lord so you see that i mean they're just fanatical views man has heard all the time so uh uh looking at this subject brother brennan will will help us now as we will look through the the message or the little thought that is on our heart you know how the the loosening of the seals make the bible a new book praise the lord amen glory be to god water wonderful water wonderful we know that this is the the the book of redemption the bulk word no man was walking amen amen no man was walted a strong angel proclaimed with a loud voice who is walking to open the book and to lose the seals now you have to keep that in your mind who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals praise the lord now when you read you will you will see the scripture also talking about uh no man was wanted to look upon it no man was worthy to read it praise the lord but there is two major effect to this book is the opening and the losing praise the lord oh i pray that the holy spirit will help us amen there is two major effect to this redemption book is the opening of the book and the losing of faith praise the lord no man was worthy to look there on in verse four it says uh and no man was found water to open the balkan to to read the book neither to look there on so open the book look upon it read it and loosen the book praise the lord now if you think about the the way revelation chapter 5 described this book being sealed with seven seals then in the literal understanding it will be that the book have to be loose before it can even be open are we together praise the lord that the book has to be loose before it can be opened because if the book is sealed you cannot open the book before you lose it [Laughter] glory be to god amen oh thank you jesus what a wonderful jesus we serve amen glory be to god we realize that revelation chapter 10 let's just read revelation chapter 10 amen glory be to god revelation chapter 10 reads and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were as it were the sun and his feet as pillow of fire and he had in his hand a little book open praise the lord and then he's he he set his right foot upon the seed and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with a live voice as the lion rolith and when he crossed seven thunder out of their voices praise the lord amen so we find here that the book that was closed no man was worthy to open became an open book in revelation chapter 10 praise the lord and as we as we as we read down we'll realize that the in uh in verse 8 and the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me saying speak again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hands of the angel we stand upon the sea and and we realize that the book now was taken the book was opened by the lamb the book was handed down to the seven angel of revelation chapter 10 after it has been opened and that book yet in revelation chapter 10 verse 8 and now is now handed over to john that is a type of the bride the book wants that no man was warping to even look upon to even read is now in the hands of man and he's not only hindering the book and reading the book but he's asked to eat the book and that book is going to become part of his life praise the lord amen so we would just we we would trust the lord this morning and ask that he would help us i might be doing uh kind of for a little bit of reading but i believe that the law will be able to help us this morning praise the lord i read from the breach and brother branham says now the book remember is seal year is one year it is this seal then another one wrap seo another one is wrap now he's he's describing how the book was sealed with seven seals he said before it was a book it was just a straw amen it was a straw that was rolled up you know so uh he's he's he's now describing that's the way he's uh uh you know he he choose to describe that he says uh uh remember the seal and yeris won and here is this seal then another one is rob a seal another one is wrapped a seal is a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and and it's sealed with seven seals and then on is on the back side is because it's worn up because it's worn up or it's rolled up let me see that way the seal mystery is on the inside amen the seal mystery is on the inside are we together the lord revelation chapter 5 1 says and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within is written within are we together and on the backside sealed with seven seals so brother branham here is helping us to understand that the mystery is in the book amen now when people think about the seal being on the backside of the book they think that is an extra interpretation that is not in the scriptures the thing that is an extraordinary it's a flying thought that the prophet will just come up with a flying thought that is not in the scripture a book written within but is still on the backside are we together the seal mystery is on the inside and it's owner said the white house rather or the black house rather and walk more on the outside now understand now he's saying the seal the mystery is in the book but we see this how a white house rather and black house rather and then see what he said he says and what more on the outside praise the lord now let me see it this way that's the reason why a preacher would read the book of revelation and think that john might have overeaten and got a bad dream why because the things that are written there looks like something that is outside praise the lord if the word of god does not make sense to you if you read something from this bible praise the lord just like a god says in his word that uh that that illegitimate children will not come into the presence of god after 10 generations praise the lord amen now when you read that and then you see roof coming into the picture of redemption it looks like it throw you off you try to understand what is happening here are we together but let me show you something glory be to god amen are we together now when we we read last week we were studying about we were studying about tema last week over in genesis chapter 38 and the child that there might give birth to if you look in the scripture there you will see that uh this child was called ferrance are we together i will give you a little assignment because it's taking me off of mine but i'm just trying to show something here and then when ferrous was born you have to know that what took place was made of an abominable act now you have to you have to also realize that judah was prophesied upon the out of his lyon would come the king of israel praise the lord now but with this child being born it kicks the kingship out for 10 generations now so take this scripture go and read over in ruth after boss got married to ruth terrance is also called in the lineage go and read matthew chapter one you will also realize that from pharah's and you count down david is the 10th generation praise the lord what is your homework for your bible studies but why why i say this is because you see something here in the scripture and it stumbles you praise the lord it looks like it's on the back side because you it almost like you cannot run it through the scripture it stumbles you but the mystery of that thing is is in the it's in the book it's not going to come from a theologian some word it's right in the book it's in the pages of the book that's what david said in the volume of the book it's written of me that's speaking about jesus in the volume of the book it's written about me i come to do that well oh god amen now i just used that example to be able to help us to see your brother brandon says the seal mistreat is on the inside of the book but then if you read a white house rather or the black house rather and what mall on the outside because it just until god can be able to give us an understanding and important interpretation and show us in a scripture for us to be able to understand this is just on the outside of the book are we together but the mystery of the whole book is in themselves from genesis to revelation their complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seals all is an important time praise the lord he says is an important time feast of the trumpet he says the seventh seals and there if i have ever said anything that was inspired it was in debt there where the angel of the lord met us and the bible become an ebook there it opens up and reveal all the things that the reformers and things are left out it was the complete revelation of jesus christ altogether new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture praise the lord perfectly exactly with the scripture that's what brother branham said if you cannot run it from revelation to uh from genesis to revelation just leave it alone you might not be wrong you might just need more grace for god to help you praise the lord a lot of the financial scene that had raising around this message is because people think that brother branham brought us think outside of the bible praise the lord if there is any teaching in this message that is outside of the bible then that is a cut amen praise the lord so the bible being a new book is not a slogan that we have something extraordinary all we have is grace that have come to us to make god's word plain to our understanding are we together glory be to god amen amen statue of a perfect man he says this now and after we get through with the seven seals then at the time of the sounding of the seventh seal or the losing i want you to pay attention here now at the time of the sounding of the seven seal all the losing of the seven seal cause we know when a seal is is to lose a ministry so actually what is the losing of the seals the losing of the seals church is nothing but the releasing of christ [Music] the christ that was bound by tradition and dogmas is now released the loosing of the seals is god coming from the pages of the bible and becoming real to the people praise the lord amen he says the losing of the seals because we know as seal is to lose a ministry and it's the ministry of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen praise the lord we know that a seal is to lose a ministry to lose seven seals and we will see that right on the chart is losing a message something that's seal up praise the lord you realize that in revelation chapter 1 he used the same word he they have lose us by his own blood praise the lord we have to realize that the book of revelation is a book of symbols and god popped those symbols there in the book of revelation just to get our attention the same way he pulled a butch on the hill burning with fire but yet the leaves are not consumed it was only to get the attention of the prophet it was to get the attention of moses that's all it was and that's what the symbols in the book of revelation and therefore is to grab the attention of the elect it's for us to pay attention are we together so you understand that the losing of the seal that's what makes the bible a new book because a release christ he's no longer a historical god but he's a present tense god the sin yesterday today and forever praise the lord we don't need to go to jerusalem to experience him it's good to go and see the promised land see the tomb but jesus christ is here this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever that's why the loosing of the seals was it was to release christ amen praise the lord amen it was to release christ let me let me tap it like this it's just like eliza went and picked up rebecca and she started telling rebecca everything about isaac and rebecca was in a sealed car at chariot and she was bringing rebecca and she asked this question how does it look and you know they and everything and as the chair gets closer she saw a man on the field the man starts to fit the description yes sir or whatever is i was saying she pull herself together and say hello it's that man praise the lord when elijah said yes she put down her veil glory be to god because the picture is becoming clearer the seal is loosening it's no longer picture in your mind but the presence you've been told about is now becoming real [Applause] [Music] she can see his beer [Laughter] she can see the form of his face she can see his physique the seal is loosening praise the lord and rebecca is going to be a new book because the loosening of the seals make the bible a new book [Music] praise the lord when god takes away the tradition of the church [Applause] and all the fanaticism praise the lord all the dogmas that have helped us bowed on a legal lazy when god takes it away it's that's what jesus says they were loose because a losing is to release a person and when the person is loose from sin they become a new book all things are passed away and all things becomes new praise the lord amen the loosening of the seals the releasing of christ a ministry has come to declare that he is here that's why he could preach lift him out of history amen calling on jesus because he's here that's right that's exactly right are we together are you getting the picture well if i disappoint you i'm sorry if you think i was going to be pulling things you know black cloth and red cloth out of my heart i don't have it yeah sure come on preach i i don't have anything just the word just what the word of god says [Music] [Laughter] oh praise the lord my goodness he says we know what a seal is it's a losing that's right alpha ministry it's a losing of a ministry brother bryan said this in the message pattern oh glory be to god he says the pardon is not a pardon until unless is being accepted as a pattern god gave us all things and he give us pardon it's pardon to those who want to accept god's word as pardon understand this praise the lord a pardon is now how much you feel sorry for what you did it's not how much you feel sorry and you regret that is not a pattern praise the lord amen the parliament is not how much the george how he deliberates or how he shout what he says or what the preacher shot is not the emotion of the preacher he says it's a pattern to those who want to accept god's word anything less than that is not a pattern amen now what the church says now what the doctrine says but what god's word says a pattern those who want to accept god's word as a pattern listen to this he says just to read it it doesn't means that you are pardoned amen amen just to read it and love the reading does it means that you are pardoned just to narrate and enjoy amen it doesn't mean that you are pardoned you have to embrace it you have to accept it you have to embrace it he said just to read it it doesn't mean that you are pardoned it means that you have got to accept it as your pardon that god gave his son to die in your state then it's a pardon he says a pardon from god is there release is the same word loose and power don't lose you amen a release are we together a pattern release from guilt a release from guilt amen so a pattern is an action word a pattern has action a pattern has effect they release you from guilt now you realize that i'm trying to establish the word loose because the losing of the seals that's what makes the bible a new book amen praise the lord it's not the sepancy it's now water baptism in jesus name praise the lord amen but the releasing of christ brother branham said this in the message talking he says this he says now we notice in this that that blossoms being broken release god amen god was in christ reconciling the word to himself where no other one could do it nothing else could be done is taking that holy blood himself so he said that the blood cells being broken when the pierce him in his side he said it was the releasing of god the fullness of god that was dwelling in that body is now released to a church is now released to a many member body amen so he's no longer a historical god he's a present tense god he's a god that is living among his people praise the lord can you can you can you imagine it almighty god was bound almighty god the most powerful god strong and mighty in battle but yet he was bound god was bound because his word was broken when adam left the word of god god was bound he couldn't move because his word was broken god only had on his word he don't act on your emotion you don't add on your your your your syncrete god add on his word feast of the trumpet but branham will explain how those two thousand thousand demons bound the holy spirit how how can god be bound do you know when you choose to follow your own idea lean that to your own understanding like solomon says praise the lord you make god powerless because he cannot act in your life you are having your own way you are choosing to do things the way you want to do it just to please and satisfy your flesh god can you god cannot move praise the lord the desires of the flesh not being subject to god abounds god it bounced god praise the lord when people choose to take father son and the holy ghost for baptising instead of getting down and talking to almighty god and saying you are my father if they're just too to do father son in the holy ghost you are bound in god you don't expect god to move on man's ideas you are limiting god you are limiting god glory be to god and the prophet of god said that's the worst thing you can do to almighty god is to limit him i'm telling you there is so much power there is so much power to change your body send you back to the best of your age praise the lord there is so much power but you see the church holding on to creeds it's limiting god from moving praise the lord see what happened on the date of pentecost when 120 percent in the upper room decided to surround themselves in one accord they decided to just surround themselves abandon their tops and just surrounded themselves coming no thought coming they did not make no plans for the future they didn't make no plans no thoughts they just surrounded themselves and when god's zero down when he's zero down for all the base because you know what it is the first day they got there they all answered say oh no expectation nothing and the second day nothing they sat down and talked well are we doing it the way he said we should do it he said we should gather the promise of the father will come and don't you think it's just and and and they struggled around their own ideas nothing and the bible says this starts to pray in one call in one mine when that unity of the spirit god among the believers were to surround himself right saying be it unto me now calling to your words they surround themselves just like jesus said in in in gethsemane not my will but your will be done praise the lord those men that were that were that was scared to death because of what the sahebrush council would do to them they were scared to death because of the roman empire and the roman soldiers praise the lord religion and politics was joining to come against the church they were scared to death but when they surrendered themselves to god and the holy ghost came praise the lord amen they care not for their own life they're running to the street prophesying singing praising god glory be to god and on that day the church was born amen that's right on that day the church was born god bless god release himself he released himself praise the lord god released himself that one time there was only jesus that was healing the sick and raising the dead but god released himself when peter and john went by the gate called beautiful they said seven and god we have none but what we have received we give unto you amen praise oh god want to do so much he want to do so much with you so much but we are allowing our own personal ambition and own personal things we are struggling with in our mind if we would just let go and let god have his way praise the lord he released himself on the days of pentecost not only to the 12th not only to the 12th amen not only to the 12 and there were babies in the upper room just like this little baby son thank god for the holy ghost when god released himself he's no respecter of a person he's not respected of person or age he released himself a seal was broken a book was opened that's the reason why brother branham says if the if the first church of pentecost who put out a book a book was open on that day a book written within was open amen oh you are a written episode amen that is supposed to be read by all men but many of us are keeping the book close but i'm telling you almighty god is here to break that seal to break that suit upon your life now your book will be open praise the lord that your book will be open and your neighbors and friends will start reading because your book is a new book all things are passed away behold all things hallelujah i knew amen the losing of the seal makes the bible a new book are we together so brother branham says the blood cell broken he says thy release god praise the lord the presence of god unrecognized brother branham says but you see the tradition had got him cut down todd down that's the way it is today if he did have only been taught right if a man had would have believed what the scripture has said but his tradition got him off of it his tradition got him off of the scripture praise the lord when jesus came he says the scripture but it's what they have spoken of me and i will say the same thing if god has brought us the ministry of jesus christ then search the scripture young people search the scripture because if you don't search the scripture you'll misinterpret what brother branham said when jesus resurrected and he met those men on the road of immigrants the bible says from the psalm and the prophets he took them through the scripture he took them through the scripture and he opened the scripture to their understanding praise the lord people come around the message they are just screaming to understand mystery they want to understand the seals they want to know the bridge what is this bridge they are just streaming out for mystery just asked him what is john 3 16 praise the lord amen praise the lord they are just streaming out they want to understand what is worse down here seventh a week they want to understand you know while uh and they're just out you know that the the thing about it did is that people we we have to you know i like i said and i continue to say this thing because it's just my own personal thing that the way i see it you know people gets disappointed they get disappointed because when brother branham talked about a quick a short quick work and brother branham talked about missing ling would be restored and brother brown talk about how the dynamics of this church is and how important of the holy ghost we put all of those things into mental conception and we start to reason it out instead of just falling in love with god amen instead of just loving god and loving his word amen we start to work out things in our mind pretty soon we are putting we are putting our dates to events verb said this so when by this time they're supposed to happen and pretty soon we get ourselves in trouble instead of just falling in love with god amen god interpret his word by bringing it to pass that's what we were taught god interpret his word by bringing it to pass but abraham says his tradition got him off of it seem it is today people will take the real gospel where the holy ghost is coming in and the power and the glory of god releasing sinners from sin and making them free and and baptizing them in the holocaust and healing the sick and showing signs and wonder and people will walk away they will walk away praise the lord because they want this classical church of entertainment they want to be entertained by the choir in purple rob with a pop organ they want to be entertained god is not here to entertain you god is here to release himself in you because he wants sons and daughters he's looking for hands that he can use he's looking for feet that he can use he's looking for mouth that he can use he's not here to entertain you he's not here to have you sit back crank yourself in the chair blow yourself with fan no he want to make you hot in your seat he want to make the seat so hot for you praise the lord glory be to god where brandon says they will leave that because that's what their church believe praise the lord oh my goodness oh my goodness are we together the releasing of the seal so we understand that the loosing of the seal is god releasing himself praise the lord is god releasing himself out of the pages of his word to become personal in our life praise the lord you can seek for understanding you can seek for i mean revelation that will move your spine in your back but if god is not personal to you your revelation will not last if god has not come from the pages of his word if he's not personal to you your revelation will not take you across the street now watch see what brother branham says here junction of time brother brandon preached this message he was trying to place the church describing his final junction that we have come to he says god said so in the bible jesus said before noah's time at the end they were marrying and giving in marriages how a great turmeric is in the world today and we realize that one thing that caused that the bible said that the spirit great spirit came down evil spirit and got into these people and done these things evil spirit influenced them a time where spirit is impressing himself on the earth using whatever medium it can that's the reason why we have to guide our spirit like i said wednesday night we have to guide our spirit he said and we see the same evil spirit working in our day and now notice again that not only that when all hell turned loose he said all heaven turned loose also when the enemy coming as a flaw the spirit of god raised up a standard against it he says these two forces has always show at the junction at every junction that's a depressing spirit that have us over the world i want to keep the minds and the spirit of men to be depressed we sit in church and nothing of god seems real to us because we have built false expectation praise the lord instead of just simply faking god at his word and say lord i love you amen praise the lord amen depressing spirit comes down and in that same time right the spirit of god is raising up extended amen praise the lord now he goes ahead he describes the spirit that is impressing himself upon man influencing the way they think the way they dress and all the things that is happening unnatural man without the spirit of god and you go ahead he says all the prophets in the same junction of time he says all the prophets and the samples point saying this they the angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if god did that for those little junction back day yes sir what will he do now when all hell is turned loose praise the lord all hell is turned loose hell being released he says the lead is ticking out of hell and demons are streaming out to the people amen [Music] praise the lord when all hell is turned loose he said all heaven will turn loose angels appearing signs and wonders on the earth the count of faith arising god proving which is right and wrong praise the lord now see brother branham said this back in 1954 junction of time he says all the prophets all the scripture pointing to a time where joy said i poured out my spirit in those last days he says all pointing to that time signs and wonders angels will appear glory be to god he says god started his church he initiated his church with the visitation of angels when the church started in the book of us we know the angels visited peter in the in praise and open the present gift for him praise the lord angel open the present gates angels two right on the mountain and witness to those men and say the same jesus you see ascending will descend god initiated his church with the visitation of angels praise the lord glory be to god people can say what they want to say amen glory be to god by the grace of god as long as you keep me here as your pastor i love that photo i put out there i one of these days i would tell you my inspiration that drew me to blow that photo up amen i paid i paid i paid i don't even remember but more than 500 i paid to blow up that for them i will tell you not not today praise the lord amen glory be to god you know because you see let me let me just go go yet a little bit so i'll help you to so you can be able to understand brother branham there in houston where that pillar of fire came over the prophet praise the lord you have to realize that brother branham was standing on god's word he was standing and saying the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the meal but branham never even wanted to go down it was uh uh uh what's the brother name ff bosworth that went down and took the challenge amen he took the challenge and and asked the man what can you say about the redemptive name of jehovah are they applied to jesus praise the lord and after he took the challenge he said well in brown is in the crowd oh that prophet he never even wanted to go up praise the lord but let me let me let me let me help you you will have to realize that that was on the the first port word divine healing campaigns was running around the country god dedicated his prophet all of the first port by the pillar of fire and then when the word was opened which is the temple god also vindicated now only the prophet he vindicated the bride amen that's right by seven angels praise the lord amen i'll leave you right in there let me continue i'll leave you right in there he dedicated the bride the opening of the word the loosing of christ by seven angels praise the lord when brother brandon preached a message influenced all this influence series he read isaiah chapter 6 to show how angels influenced the prophet isaiah ministry when isaiah came out of that experience with the angel his ministry was not the same amen amen amen amen the prophet god emphasis was we are under the influence of angelic pain we are under the influence of angelic being yes sir we have access to jacob ladders because angels are ascending and descending praise the lord that's the reason why all things are possible to them that believe we have a quick access to the throne of god because angers are ascending and descending amen praise the lord that's the reason why don't allow the church to bow you down amen yes glory be to god to bow you down and think that you have to break the wall and break the benches all you have to do just step on jacob's ladder step on the promise of god say god your word said amen when the weakest christian cry out you a year god your word said and every step on the word we take you higher on jacob's ladder because the loosening of the seals make the bible a new book god has been released that's right and when he released himself all we can do just embrace him [Laughter] all we can do we just embrace him that's why the scripture says when there is a chariot arrived rebecca could hold herself no longer she leaped out of the chair right into his bosom amen she was released she was loose a seal was broken a new book was open don't be looking for something in the far end god want to break the seals of your life because you are a written episode so man can read what is written in your life that he having sons and daughters of god young people that can stand for god and turn their back on the under the sinful word it's there it's there written within written within brother branham says god watch over you for four generations before you could get down here four generations he watched over you preparing you for this day and age that devil is no match to you praise the lord don't allow him to boss you into a corner amen there is something down within that you can say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the word praise the lord glory be to god he's been taking the lair off little by little yeah and every time he takes it off he says wow your life has changed why are you not coming to the party anymore then another seal is broken praise the lord you that never use the law of church starting to love church then another seal is broken you just love the present of god you like you like daniel you open your window why don't you left for your hands and you pray glory be to god and then he takes another layer off when you don't read the bible it looks like something has happened it looks like you lost something god taking the layers off your life little by little because there is something written within that's been sealed that's been locked up yes sir with all the cells that came down from your grandfather and all of that that's why science science call it a cell it's a cell that is keeping the original you you have a cell that is keeping you from being revealed you are healing behind those cells cells upon cells but in there there's a sun they have received a pattern and somebody has received a pattern glory be to god oh man praise the lord i gotta hold myself here i gotta hold myself oh my goodness verbum says when the eyes were open he says when all important speaks he said miracles happen praise the lord you believe that only putting speaks at every junction and when the church cooled off cooled off like nothing is happening and people start to see nothing happening around the message when the church cool off like nothing is happening and when the church go off then unimportant speaks that's right a miracle take place and this is the junction of all junction this is the end time the end of the whole history of the world is right now at hand so you can expect unimportance to speak amen amen praise the lord but you see brother branham said it's not a public show unimportance is speaking but is that still a small voice glory be to god because it's not a public show you can expect unimportance to speak and you can expect the great greatest and mightiest miracle that ever happened on earth will happen in the next few years he said if jesus is tired it will be praise the lord amen amen the great years and my tears miracle where is it it's right here exactly it's right here praise the lord do you know the things that satan is being is is pouring out against this message brother branham doing his doing his uh uh uh ministry he called few fbs and men that impersonated as fbs he called them out but let me tell you i'm not a security personnel but i think i have a little idea the united states of america just like everything that has been on the news with all the different groups and all the riots that have been happening the fbi takes time to study every big movement just at the time word william branham minister was calling crowd the fbi followed the mama movement they follow jehovah witness movement right now there's a case in california for for child abuse around the jehovah witness movement the mama movement with all of that they keep their eyes they follow every movement that is influencing the public and when people come from overseas and go to jeffersonville to go to willem branham grave the fbi is keeping their eyes on you if you think you will not follow you i follow you've been watched praise the lord we have an unseen eye that is watching us as well glory be to god amen and when people start financing and stats us you know things that cause emotion how did they pick them up in russia that the message would have problem in russia praise the lord are we together and all of the things men that have followed this message for over 40 years 45 years they are feeding things on the internet they are projecting things oh this is what they believe this is what they do this is what they do praise the lord church that's the reason why the holy ghost is right the holy ghost the holy ghost cannot be overemphasized praise the lord it can never be overemphasized because we know what i see have been with our fathers of all there will be a time where we will be squeezed praise the lord will be squeezed we have an fbi office right down the road here from us [Laughter] that's why the holy ghost cannot be overemphasized it's no time to play church and to play religion this thing is either real to you or it's [Music] not praise the lord because god has released himself that's right he has released himself we can have four assets to him you don't have to go through the preacher you don't have to go through a bishop or go through the pope you can have access to god if you get down on your knees you can have access to god he has released himself thank you lord praise the lord glory be to god man has made camps and counts around the years and some has helped the bride some has just enriched himself praise the lord by in the midst of all of this yes sir god has a bride praise the lord in the midst of all of this there's a tender plane that is rising up there's a new testament church that is rising up there is there are people that will of all the name of jesus christ they will lift the word of god above everything that's what make this bible a new book amen because god has released himself praise the lord amen when we read the bible it's not just a history amen praise the lord there's a present tense god there amen i mean when you pray and you just fall in love with god the angels can take you through the pages of this bible [Laughter] amen oh my goodness i know to some i'm speaking in tongues but it's okay the holy ghost were interpreted to you amen praise the lord he said all importance to speak and you can expect the great years a mightiest miracle that in the midst of all of this scandal god said have a people that are in love with this message he still have a bride praise the lord amen see that miracle and how god is changing you amen amen how he's changing you and he's making you yes sir to love your loved ones love your wife love your children praise the lord amen it's not a god that just wants you to love him and then you hit everybody around you no but he affects you with his love now you cannot understand it you love the ones around you praise the lord oh glory be to god amen amen praise the lord hallelujah you just enjoyed his presence he has affected your heart so much like oh brother first farmer will say there is no condemnation unto them that are in christ he says god do not condemn you in so much that you do not hold condemnation in your heart for anybody praise the lord amen our hearts has been in throne with mercy it's been in throne with mercy all you can say god be merciful lord be merciful our hearts are enthroned with mercy amen on importance have spoken praise the lord and his word is changing the atoms of our body it's drawing us closer to him amen but says you can expect the greatest and mightiest miracle however happening on earth will happen in the next few years to come he says if jesus started he will be then watch for satan to rise up rise up his tool when all heaven turned loose all hell turned loose too and it's prophesied that there will be james and jambros impersonators in the last day who almost impersonate the real thing so close to deceive the elite if possible verb says so my christian friends the best thing for you to do and i to do is to stay just as close to the lord jesus as we can that's right praise the lord now move close to the church if you find an apartment or the building that's good i mean we have somebody close we can call you when we need of you but what is really needed is close to jesus [Laughter] close to jesus just a closer walk with thee close to jesus love him and pray dearly that god will help us and guide us yes that we will be on his side when the end finally comes say close to jesus pray daily that god will guide us the brethren says speaking here the junction of time he told us trouble waters are coming praise the lord men will rise up they will bring evidence i mean now they are searching behind everything they are searching behind he says uh uh uh going on to uh uh how you call it now if they can even sessions dna they will do it they are searching everything praise the lord the devil has got on this wagon he's throwing everything at us he said but the best thing to do is to stay close to jesus stay close to jesus don't allow your pastor to take the place of jesus in your life don't allow your church to take the place of jesus in your life and i would say don't allow the prophet to take the place of jesus stay close to jesus and he say pray daily that god will guide us because there are evil spirits streaming out there every word trying to entrap us yes trying to entrap us that's the reason why we have to apply the talking amen before we leave our homes yes sir praise the lord amen we are living in a day in an age where christ has been released he's so real he's so real that when you get in tune with him you feel his presence he's been released that's what make this bible a new book that's what makes this message so sweet like honey in the rock it's because of the presence of jesus christ the presence of jesus christ he's coming out of the pages of his word that's right musicians you can come time tested memorial brother branham says now the scuffle's too bad and said it will not hold up it can do it he says that's what they are saying today this year holy ghost religion you are talking about it won't be long that tree will burn down but it don't burn down he said the fire only water it it only gave us new hold every trial is to give you a new grip on god he wanna give us a new hold and own strengthening every trial testing every time a wayne hits a tree and shoves it back and forth back and forth and only losing yes that word again a losing a release the only losing the roots so it can go deeper and get a better hold every time sickness track at home every time trials track your home
