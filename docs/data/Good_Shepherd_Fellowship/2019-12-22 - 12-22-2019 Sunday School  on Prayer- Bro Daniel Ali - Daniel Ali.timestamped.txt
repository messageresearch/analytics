[0:00] praise the Lord shall we go to the Lord
[0:05] in prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus
[0:13] wait thank you so very much for this
[0:15] morning we are so very much grateful
[0:19] dear Lord Jesus for what you've done in
[0:21] our life that before you laid the
[0:24] foundation stone of this earth you knew
[0:26] us we are no strangers to you we belong
[0:32] to you and to you we shall go that right
[0:37] from the cradle all through this life to
[0:41] the grave and beyond

[0:46] lives we are so very much grateful Lord
[0:49] for what your grace has done in our life
[0:52] we all you dear Lord Jesus everything
[0:55] there is in this life and in the life to
[0:58] come for by grace are we saved not of
[1:01] works lest any man should boast we are

[1:08] and the finisher of our faith and we

[1:25] for everything you've done for us we
[1:28] worship the Lord we bless thee and we
[1:30] uplift and glorified in holding him this
[1:32] morning father we have just gathered
[1:35] once again to go through the adult
[1:36] Sunday School today happens to be
[1:37] probably I think the last day just going
[1:41] to run up what we've started probably
[1:43] eight nine months ago just trusting in
[1:47] your grace father and in your divine
[1:49] leadership - ladies topic to rest this
[1:54] morning come and honor yourself Lord we
[1:59] praise thee father once again and we
[2:02] bless thee in Jesus name Amen
[2:06] god bless you since you welcome sister
[2:11] good yes so I had a very rough week I
[2:28] didn't know I could even make it in this
[2:30] morning as I was telling some writers
[2:34] yesterday on Thursday
[2:35] between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. I went to the
[2:41] bathroom 12 times and my my the previous
[2:46] night I took my wait before coming to
[2:48] church that was Sunday night and it was
[2:51] 2 or 4.9 for no reason but after the
[2:59] 12th time on Thursday for a very good
[3:01] reason I said no let me go on the scale
[3:03] again and when I took my way to drop to
[3:06] one 99.7 in eight hours I lost I think
[3:10] 5.2 pounds yeah thank God my wife gave
[3:15] me some medicine to stop it but I've
[3:17] been very weak
[3:19] tango we've been able to make it praise
[3:22] be to God
[3:23] yes so I'm just trying to bring this
[3:29] topic to an end we've been looking at
[3:32] the topic prayer for I think it's nine
[3:35] months I'm not very sure it's been a
[3:37] while and as I was thinking of you know
[3:43] just summing it up I was wondering a
[3:46] topic we've treated for so long what is
[3:49] the conclusion started going to be like
[3:51] I couldn't just find a place so I'm just
[3:55] trusting that a few minutes was spent
[3:57] before the Lord you know what we just
[4:00] help us in any way it pleases him praise
[4:02] be to God so we're going to look at
[4:06] let's turn our Bibles to John 15:7
[4:19] John 15:7 I read if ye abide in me and
[4:34] my words abide in you ye shall ask what
[4:39] you will and it shall be done unto you
[4:43] praise be to God so we have looked at a
[4:56] lot of things concerning prayer so very
[5:00] much and it was just a burden on my
[5:04] heart to teach this it was not because I
[5:13] knew better than anybody but I just had
[5:16] that burden and I have had some personal
[5:21] testimonies here and there about how
[5:23] much it has been a blessing to some of
[5:27] us and personally it's been a blessing
[5:30] to me because I have had to read and to
[5:35] do a few research here and there you
[5:38] know full of Scripture here and there
[5:42] it's been wonderful to say the least and
[5:45] I have enjoyed every moment of it it's
[5:48] changed my prayer life and you know I'll
[5:58] probably get there I don't want to lose
[6:00] my line of thought the Muslims pray five
[6:04] times a day they will get up at dawn
[6:12] pray in the afternoon pray at 3 o clock
[6:16] five and seven five times a day for them
[6:20] is aware of life I don't care what they
[6:24] are going through they would make sure
[6:27] that they pray five times
[6:29] I don't care how sick he is he never
[6:36] gives an excuse he would make sure he
[6:39] prays five times a day I don't care how
[6:43] poor and wretched he is he would pray
[6:46] five times a day I don't care what a
[6:49] huge down or up he will pray five times
[6:52] a day and it's interesting apart from
[6:57] having been a Muslim myself I have lived
[7:00] in that community and sometimes you take
[7:03] a vehicle you are in a transport that
[7:06] driver is going and all of a sudden
[7:07] their driver stops he doesn't even tell
[7:10] anybody anything and then people are
[7:12] asking is anything is everything all
[7:15] right is everything all right and then
[7:17] you hear somebody say oh the driver
[7:18] wants to pray he will stop the car stop
[7:23] everybody get out of the car and then
[7:26] he'll perform his ablution and right
[7:28] beside the road he'll be praying he's
[7:30] not ashamed of it I don't care what it
[7:34] is you would have to sit in the bus and
[7:39] wait till he is done and yes imagine if
[7:43] he's going to drive you for 24 hours
[7:46] just be ready five times during the
[7:50] journey in that day he is going to stop
[7:51] the car and you have no complaint pray
[7:56] five times a day that is what they do
[7:59] for them is the will of life I remember
[8:04] in northern Ghana one time the Orthodox
[8:06] Muslims and the fundamentals had a
[8:08] problem they were fighting that didn't
[8:11] stop them from still going to their God
[8:15] and pray five times a day they would
[8:18] worry along down and under it there is a
[8:21] long life and when he goes down he says
[8:25] allah wahda when you look on the day you
[8:28] will see a very long knife to egg Assad
[8:30] his brain and he's ready to cut off
[8:33] people's head they don't care what you
[8:38] are going through
[8:40] they don't joke with the appraised think
[8:46] of the children of Israel Daniel in in
[8:50] Babylon the Bible said he prayed three
[8:53] times a day so when even the King issued
[8:58] a decree that nobody should make any
[9:02] petition to his God Daniel still open
[9:05] his windows towards Jerusalem and he
[9:10] prayed three times a day it was aware of
[9:14] life not even the Kings decree could
[9:18] stop him and until prayer becomes a way
[9:24] of life until prayer becomes a way of
[9:28] life you are not going anywhere yet you
[9:35] don't pray only when you feel like it
[9:39] you know prayer only when things are
[9:42] good you don't pray only when you feel
[9:45] well you don't pray only when you have
[9:49] some big bonus no prayer should be aware
[9:56] of life prayer ought to be an integral
[10:00] part of your Christian life when your
[10:03] prayer life is under attack your
[10:06] Christian life is under attack if the
[10:11] devil can get you to sucked in your
[10:16] prayer life if the devil can give you a
[10:21] reason why you shouldn't pray then guess
[10:25] what
[10:25] very soon your Christian experience will
[10:30] come crumbling down
[10:34] never never never joke with your praise
[10:41] praise be to God for a Christian
[10:46] the Bible says would you pray without
[10:49] ceasing
[10:52] there is no special time for prayer and
[10:56] as I said before every prayer time is a
[10:59] special time I don't care what the of
[11:06] the morning what time in the afternoon
[11:08] what time in the evening and you know
[11:11] what that times that you don't just feel
[11:15] like praying that you feel so down and
[11:18] out you feel so sick nobody cares about
[11:22] me nobody calls me nobody loves me and
[11:25] you are down I am sick that is the time
[11:29] that your prayer sounds rings so loud in
[11:37] the presence of God those moments you
[11:40] don't feel like praying at all
[11:45] wonderful I just told you guys this
[11:49] topic has helped my prayer life on well
[11:55] on Friday night I was so down and out
[12:01] feeling very sick normally I would when
[12:04] dropped my wife at work pick up in the
[12:07] morning that morning I didn't pick her
[12:09] up I asked her to type uber and in the
[12:13] night I was supposed to carry her I said
[12:15] you know what can I just go Oba excuse
[12:18] me and she said I don't have much time I
[12:22] may be late I woke up under that
[12:26] condition to tell you the truth I will
[12:29] just lie in bed and then say a few words
[12:33] I took her to wake came back I was so
[12:38] heavy in my body I said you know what
[12:41] let me just I have a special corner
[12:44] where I pray I went out on my knees and
[12:48] it was one of the best moments in my
[12:52] life praise be to God I prayed and I
[12:56] prayed and I prayed and I could feel a
[12:58] presence on my right side
[13:02] it was not an imagination normally when
[13:06] I'm prey and the trainer sleeping and I
[13:08] hear my voice they will come down and
[13:10] then come and kneel beside me and we
[13:13] operate I felt a presence and I knew
[13:17] they were sleeping it was a wonderful
[13:20] moment no Wes could ever describe it in
[13:23] those moments when you don't just feel
[13:25] like it where you feel very heavy
[13:30] something says you know what just light
[13:32] and pray you know just if you can just
[13:35] drag your caucus get on your knees and
[13:38] cry out to God is going to give you a
[13:40] different experience praise be to God
[13:44] remember that every prayer time is a
[13:48] special time praise be to God now as I
[13:57] said I guess didn't know where to start
[14:01] from
[14:02] because we have said a lot and I'm just
[14:06] concluding this whole story and when I
[14:10] say I am just concluding it it's not
[14:12] just to say that oh we have concluded on
[14:15] prayer no it's just a discussion we are
[14:18] bringing to a conclusion where there is
[14:22] no way we can ever come bring a
[14:26] conclusion to prayer so long as we live
[14:31] in this life till the coming of Christ
[14:36] prayer ought to be something you should
[14:40] just love to do it love to be in the
[14:44] presence of God there is nothing that
[14:47] can compare to it it's just a joy I mean
[14:52] praise be to God so you know what we are
[14:56] just ending the topic but then you
[15:03] should pray more often
[15:09] the Bible says without vision the people
[15:11] perish have a revelation into what you
[15:16] are doing there isn't why sometimes we
[15:21] just do taste anyhow is because we look
[15:25] revelation of what we are doing take
[15:33] your prayer life to the next level and
[15:38] don't just pray as I said before most of
[15:43] the times oh it's just me if it's not me
[15:46] that it is we I'm so part of it if it's
[15:49] not we that is us I'm so part of it when
[15:53] does it become he/she them they don't be
[15:59] selfish in your prayer life praise be to
[16:03] God
[16:04] I remember one another before the Lord
[16:08] bear one another before the Lord carry
[16:13] one another before the Lord standing for
[16:16] one another sometimes I just have a baby
[16:21] for somebody without any reason
[16:24] I just have a burden and I'll go before
[16:27] the Lord that happens then when you have
[16:30] a bed in it's a different in all
[16:32] together sometimes there's no pattern
[16:35] but try to carry one another before the
[16:38] Lord don't wait til something bad
[16:41] happens it's part of the human nature
[16:45] sometimes we just sit and wait till
[16:48] something goes wrong that is not a good
[16:53] thing to do I remember one time I had a
[16:56] dream a sister was standing beside me on
[16:59] my left side and we lost hands like this
[17:02] like a father was walking her Dora to
[17:04] give her out to Mary for marriage
[17:07] ceremony and then I saw she moved fast
[17:11] forward then I groped her back and I
[17:14] right away she just give up in my arms
[17:16] oh it was it was just so real I just
[17:20] started crying and I started shouting as
[17:22] no I will not take this I will not
[17:24] accept this I refuse it
[17:26] Sarah Prynne and I realized it was it
[17:28] was a dream I told my wife we call the
[17:32] sister ceased are you okay she said yeah
[17:34] I'm fine
[17:35] you know it's not everything you tell
[17:36] people and then we've got to be down to
[17:40] business we didn't know what was going
[17:42] to happen but we prayed and prayed and
[17:45] prayed and prayed that week we do not
[17:49] have to wait until such things happen
[17:54] just make it a part of your prayer life
[18:00] let it be a joy to just bet someone in
[18:04] prayer to bet a family in prayer to I
[18:07] mean as much as God gives you grace
[18:10] praise be to God
[18:12] do not be selfish because we can be very
[18:18] very self-centered and that is not good
[18:20] for us
[18:21] and it is not also good for anybody now
[18:27] there are a lot of things that would
[18:29] hinder our prayers
[18:31] you can pray from morning to evening and
[18:35] so have you Priya ended and these are
[18:40] things we should watch out the items
[18:44] we've talked about I'm not going to go
[18:46] just kind of run over a few things and
[18:49] then
[18:50] oh just pray now watch pride
[19:00] the Bible says pride goes before a fall
[19:03] and sometimes you can be proud without
[19:06] even knowing you're proud I attended a
[19:12] seminar I didn't know a heart fear
[19:15] because I don't feel anything I attended
[19:19] a seminar and the expert came and said
[19:22] what she feared was any time she was
[19:25] live in the house she would double check
[19:28] yes afraid that the house was going to
[19:30] be on flames then I said oh is this one
[19:34] to fear
[19:36] she said yes it is fear I saw oh but I
[19:40] also do that anytime I'm leaving the
[19:44] house i watch and I make sure everything
[19:47] is off I didn't know it was fear but I
[19:55] don't fear it's not part of me so right
[20:03] exists in many forms and it's a good
[20:09] thing when you are proud and you know
[20:10] you are proud the bad side to it is when
[20:15] you don't do it watch pride it can
[20:29] hinder your life it can hinder your
[20:32] spiritual growth it can hinder your
[20:34] prayer praise be to God anger
[20:49] the first stage of madness they say is
[20:51] anger when you see somebody angry and
[20:55] you see them displaying there is no
[20:58] difference between that person and a
[20:59] madman the only difference is that maybe
[21:03] one looks a little clean and the other
[21:04] looks a little dirty but you know that
[21:09] this is somebody that is out of his mind
[21:16] anger raw anger can be a hindrance our
[21:25] forgiving spirit sometimes we don't
[21:30] forgive we only sweep the problem under
[21:33] the carpet and we think we have forgiven
[21:35] it goes back it goes and I come back to
[21:40] haunt us we have talked about this and I
[21:46] know we spent a lot of time on this
[21:50] unforgiving spirit can hinder you in a
[21:54] lot of ways it can hinder your praise it
[21:58] can hinder your deliverance it can
[22:00] hinder your healing it can hinder your
[22:02] walk with God when you don't learn to
[22:05] forgive and there is no limits my Peter
[22:14] is the Lord Jesus Christ how many times
[22:19] should I forgive my neighbor when they
[22:21] sin against me seventy times seven you
[22:26] have time to count then you have a lot
[22:29] of work to do
[22:34] I liked it when one preacher said that
[22:37] life is short that it is okay to get
[22:42] angry it's okay to keep grudge but do
[22:46] not let the Sun set on it then when you
[22:49] are angry just look at a time when it's
[22:52] 559 let go of it I don't know why he was
[22:55] when he was talking about this probably
[22:58] he was somewhere along the equator where
[23:00] you have 12 days of sunlight and 12 days
[23:03] of darkness but if it is in winter here
[23:10] we know we have longer nights and we
[23:12] have shorter days you have less time to
[23:15] keep that anger and if it's the other
[23:22] way around maybe in summer you have a
[23:25] long time to keep it but for how long
[23:29] and you are saying is the reason why
[23:31] some people are getting too old older
[23:33] than the idea idea age some people I got
[23:36] you are necessarily too sick some people
[23:39] are bottled up why because you are
[23:43] keeping too much in you life is short as
[23:46] it comes so let it go
[23:51] what has your neighbor done to you that
[23:54] is so much that you cannot forgive which
[23:57] you have now you have not done it to
[23:58] Christ if you have experienced
[24:03] forgiveness what makes it difficult for
[24:06] you to forgive your neighbour if you can
[24:10] hold your neighbour sense against them
[24:13] it shows the experience you have praise
[24:18] be to God these are tens to watch these
[24:21] are things that can hinder your prayer
[24:23] life just watch us sin we are running my
[24:27] time is almost up
[24:28] sin I don't intend to talk about this
[24:32] next week because I just want to close
[24:35] this today
[24:38] sin can hinder your life bitterness can
[24:41] hinder your life in several ways and
[24:45] hinder your Prius remember we are
[24:48] talking about Prius here now these days
[24:51] I have mentioned pride and feel to live
[24:56] in st. bitterness and forgiving spirit
[24:58] oh that as bad as the they'll also help
[25:03] you to check yourself the Bible says
[25:10] that let he that thinketh he standeth
[25:15] take heed lest he falls at times we T
[25:20] was hundun
[25:22] as a matter of fact sometimes you think
[25:25] oh I am standing and I'm standing show
[25:28] not knowing you're not even standing if
[25:33] you are standing maybe on one leg and
[25:35] sometimes you're on your back and you
[25:38] think you are standing now it takes some
[25:42] of these things to tell you where you
[25:44] are because if you are living in the
[25:47] spirit these things do not bother you
[25:52] but if you can be grappling with them
[25:54] and dealing with them it tells you that
[25:57] you have lived for too long in the flesh
[26:02] and it's time to get out praise be to
[26:05] God
[26:09] I'm Foreman is alway in your prayer life
[26:16] and closing be resilient never give up
[26:24] the more you pray and you don't see the
[26:29] answer coming the more you should pray
[26:33] it happens that most of the times that
[26:36] is when we give up oh I have prayed for
[26:38] too long I'm not seeing results let me
[26:41] forget it no that is the time you should
[26:42] pray
[26:44] - shows how much faith you have in God
[26:47] to honor his word
[26:51] praise be to God Daniel prayed for 21
[26:55] days
[26:56] he was very resilient he never give up
[27:00] he didn't know that from the very day he
[27:03] started praying the result was on the
[27:06] way coming but a Bible says the Prince
[27:10] of Persia withstood the angel it was on
[27:21] day number 21 that the angel Gabriel
[27:27] came and for that demon and got an
[27:31] answer to Daniel sometimes when you
[27:35] begin to pray God sends the results
[27:37] right away but this happen in the
[27:41] spiritual realm and you will sit down
[27:43] once the O God has not answered my
[27:45] prayer your prayer has been answered
[27:46] there is something that is going on and
[27:49] if you can just keep holding on in the
[27:52] face of defeat if you can be resilient
[27:55] believe it in God and trusted in God
[27:59] what happened to Daniel what happened to
[28:02] you also praise be to God be resilient
[28:08] in your prayer life when you pray
[28:16] believe we can talk about Jonah and I
[28:25] linked that to faith without faith the
[28:29] Bible says is impossible to please God
[28:32] have faith in God
[28:36] believe that God is more than able to
[28:39] honor his word and when you pray the
[28:44] scripture we just read if ye abide in me
[28:48] and my words abide in you ye shall ask
[28:50] whatever you will and it shall be done
[28:53] unto you
[28:57] have faith in God when Jonah in the
[29:01] belly of the whale now I am standing on
[29:04] land right now if you ask me what is is
[29:06] the worst waste it will take me a little
[29:08] time to figure that out and a man that
[29:11] was in the belly of the whale in the
[29:14] deep waters what makes him tame and he
[29:20] says that this is the direction this I'm
[29:23] facing the temple right now what is it
[29:25] if it is not fit the Bible says by faith
[29:28] he turned to face the temple by faith he
[29:33] didn't care whether it was enough what
[29:36] it was the East when it was tough
[29:38] whether it was whatever he didn't care
[29:40] about it he didn't care what at the
[29:42] table was behind him I was beside him
