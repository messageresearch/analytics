[37:43] has we're not walking in the counsel of
[37:46] the ungodly we're not standing in the
[37:48] way of sinners we don't have the same if
[37:50] we're not careful we'll be like Asaph
[37:53] where we listen to the call of the world
[37:55] the same fears that apply to them don't
[37:57] apply to us they do in our body we feel

[50:35] [Music]
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] and the people all said out of the young
[50:54] we got a text from sister Rekha a sister
[50:57] Rebeka brother David writes a youngest
[50:59] daughter was at yesterday early
[51:01] yesterday morning yep
[51:04] anyway she attacks in the Oh me to tell
[51:09] me that I needed to call brother David
[51:11] even made a list of different people
[51:13] that he wanted to talk to you and he
[51:15] wanted to say goodbye to you just in
[51:19] case and so anyway I got the phone
[51:24] number from her and then when I got to
[51:25] work I gave brother David a call and my
[51:31] his voice sounded perky and I told was a
[51:34] brother Dave and I was in the office on
[51:36] Saturday and I meant to call you at that
[51:37] time but I you know I just didn't get to
[51:41] it and so he said brother on Saturday he
[51:44] says I was really in a world of hurt he
[51:47] said I was I couldn't even get up out of
[51:49] bed and if when the nurses and doctors
[51:51] tried to come in and move me every time
[51:55] they tried to move me I'd just be an
[51:57] excruciating pain and he said then on
[52:00] all that day and all the decks all the
[52:03] way up through Sunday night he said he
[52:06] couldn't pass any fluids he says his for
[52:09] 36 hours
[52:12] and so his kidneys were shutting down
[52:14] and so then by Sunday night he was able
[52:17] to he was able to pass some fluids a
[52:19] little bit just a little and then Monday
[52:23] morning he said by Monday you know the
[52:28] nurse want to do that you know I'm
[52:29] trying to help him to see if he could
[52:30] pass some more fluids and he and he just
[52:33] told her so we'll just leave the urinal
[52:35] by my bed and and then he says oh you
[52:39] know let me try to do it myself you know
[52:41] and so anyway a little little later on
[52:46] he got he actually got up out of bed
[52:48] stood up over there David has been in a
[52:52] wheelchair for years and he was actually
[52:56] - able to pass fluids normally um keep
[53:03] in mind when they tried to do
[53:05] exploratory to find out what was wrong
[53:08] besides his blocked artery they he
[53:12] actually they had to resuscitate him
[53:14] twice that's when they went in to look
[53:16] see what was wrong and it was they
[53:18] thought it was a couple of heart valves
[53:20] were not working right and so the
[53:23] doctors have basically told them you
[53:25] know where do we we can't risk doing
[53:27] surgery on you because like I said we
[53:30] had to you know we had to bring you back
[53:31] to life twice already and so we won't
[53:35] even try so they were done
[53:37] doctors had all they feel they can do so
[53:41] anyway he was able to stand up his
[53:43] daughter Rebecca said this is the first
[53:46] time I've seen him stand in five years
[53:50] and so he doesn't have any pains in his
[53:55] hearts anymore and so when I was talking
[54:01] to him I said well brother you know it
[54:06] says it now that you're up
[54:07] you know you can stand up says I'm just
[54:08] looking I says I'm still holding you to
[54:10] coming up here it's about time you get
[54:13] up here he says well be chasing each
[54:14] other down the aisle and so anyway so I
[54:20] told I was gonna call him back so I
[54:22] called them just before service and and
[54:26] then when he answered the phone
[54:29] before I even said anything I just said
[54:31] I woke up the small one with my mind
[54:34] stayed on Jesus and he broke right in on
[54:39] a tube so we were singing at each other
[54:41] on the phone his voice even sounded
[54:44] stronger and he said he says brother
[54:47] Scott he said you know I just had a
[54:50] sister from Mississippi call me today
[54:53] she had been looking she couldn't find
[54:56] brother David's phone number and of
[54:58] course he's the pastor a church down
[55:00] there and but she had been looking for a
[55:03] year to try to find his phone number
[55:05] tried to ask others and couldn't find
[55:07] him she said lo and behold this morning
[55:10] she opened up her phone book and there
[55:12] was and so anyway so there was and she
[55:18] called him she says that we need for you
[55:19] to come down to Mississippi and so
[55:23] brother David told me today he said Russ
[55:25] God he says I feel this is the best I've
[55:29] felt in 10 years 10 years since so
[55:41] anyway he was actually it instructed his
[55:44] son you know he has this handicapped dam
[55:46] and he had instructed his son to sell
[55:49] that I am so it could cover the cost of
[55:52] his funeral and so he went back to sons
[55:56] as his son said whoa whoa whoa this is
[56:00] stop that I says you can sell it when
[56:03] I'm done with it
[56:08] and so he said he's got his and then his
[56:11] sister I think I think has been calling
[56:13] him from Rockford Illinois and so so I
[56:15] says what you try to tell me is you're
[56:17] gonna go down to Mississippi first then
[56:19] you're gonna go hey he told me says I'm
[56:20] gonna go down to Mississippi I'm gonna
[56:23] come up through Illinois up to Rockford
[56:25] and I'm coming to Minneapolis and then
[56:27] I'm going over to Michigan and I'm going
[56:29] up into Canada
[56:30] to preach for those Saints up there he
[56:36] said the doctors look at him they are
[56:39] just amazed he says he has pain but it's
[56:43] in his in his muscles and he says it's
[56:45] because I am I haven't been doing
[56:47] anything I just wasn't laying around
[56:49] he says if I get up and start moving
[56:51] around he said I'm gonna be I'm gonna
[56:53] feel even better but he says he's not
[56:55] having any pain I can't doctors can't
[56:58] figure out why he's not having on any
[57:00] heart pain or anything like that and so
[57:03] I just told us that what you just tell
[57:04] them that you had a consultation with
[57:06] you with the chief physician doctor
[57:09] Jesus amen so I was I was telling him
[57:14] about brother Moses I said brother I
[57:18] says that's just very interesting to me
[57:20] I says because I told my brother Moses
[57:22] testimony now that the doctor and he
[57:24] came back and doc says you shouldn't how
[57:26] can you even see out of that eye
[57:28] and by the way your suppose you should
[57:30] be blind in your other eye to doctors
[57:33] can't figure that one out either and I
[57:35] think brother bloody was going to share
[57:37] a testimony they're looking and it's
[57:39] doing the same thing with sister Keisha
[57:40] and now they're trying to figure out at
[57:44] that hospital why she doesn't look like
[57:47] she's on death's doorstep Oh everything
[57:51] that the doctors can do all their charts
[57:53] all their technicalities other all the
[57:56] things that they can measure says that
[57:59] she should be ready to pack it in I says
[58:01] but she just looks like she's ready to
[58:03] come out you know just it makes me think
[58:08] of Elijah saints of God he said he went
[58:12] he went and told her servants just go
[58:14] look on the horizon go look again he did
[58:17] seven times and he said that's seventh
[58:20] time he says I see what do you see I see
[58:23] the cloud the size of a man's hand he
[58:27] like just said it's time to get moving
[58:29] right now and you better get going as
[58:31] fast as you can
[58:32] so saints of God I believe we're serving
[58:34] the same God I believe we're seeing the
[58:36] same cloud on the horizon I just have to
[58:41] sing one thing
[58:43] it's gonna rain again it's gonna rain
[58:49] again there's a downpour coming I can
[58:55] feel it in the wind it's gonna rain

[59:42] blotting gum
[59:44] Alleluia so I'm looking forward to I

[1:08:52] it the same spirit that raised Jesus
[1:08:55] from the dead word in us and we're
[1:08:57] quicken our mortal body and father we
[1:09:00] want to thank you for the quickening
[1:09:01] power Lord upon brother David right
[1:09:04] through God Heavenly Father Lord Jesus
[1:09:06] and we believe that same quickening
[1:09:08] power that's upon sister quiche and that
[1:09:11] same quickening power to support all of

[1:09:28] we just commit this time into your hands
[1:09:29] so father that you would come down Lord
[1:09:32] and speak to us O God out of your word
[1:09:34] tonight we are grateful or we appreciate

[1:09:39] in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen
[1:09:43] amen Allah bless you you may have your
[1:09:46] seat amen praise the Lord we stay
[1:09:56] talking on the bounding power and losing
[1:09:59] power but tonight we want to go in
[1:10:02] another last week we look at that under
[1:10:05] the the dream of Joseph and tonight we
[1:10:10] want to locate honor the scapegoat amen
[1:10:17] that is we want to we want to look at
[1:10:22] the bounding and the losing power
[1:10:25] realizing that is it's a power is the
[1:10:29] key that was giving to
[1:10:32] appealing jesus said upon this rock I
[1:10:36] will build my church but here is the key
[1:10:38] when this when this house is built when
[1:10:41] this body this bill this is the key that
[1:10:43] you will use and with this kid whatever
[1:10:46] you bind on earth will be bound in
[1:10:48] heaven amen
[1:10:49] and whatever you loose on earth will be
[1:10:51] loosed in heaven
[1:10:53] praise the Lord so we've been talking
[1:10:55] about this bonding power as awesome as
[1:10:58] as a power of the Holy Ghost it's almost
[1:11:01] like in in us in John chapter 12 a
[1:11:05] pentakus has not come but the Bible says
[1:11:08] after Jesus came resurrected he breathed
[1:11:12] upon the disciples and he said receive
[1:11:15] here the Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[1:11:18] so in another sense Jesus was giving you
[1:11:22] know just just an earnest to the church
[1:11:25] that you you will have such a power
[1:11:28] that's that's what the Holy Ghost is is
[1:11:30] the keeping power is the bounding power
[1:11:33] praise the Lord and and that's why we
[1:11:35] want to look at tonight in in in this
[1:11:38] type of Leviticus chapter 16 now in the
[1:11:42] Leviticus chapter 16 when you read there
[1:11:46] you realize that God told Moses and when
[1:11:52] it come down to this to this sin
[1:11:54] offering he was supposed to take to
[1:12:01] God's praise the Lord amen he was
[1:12:06] supposed to take to God's let's look in
[1:12:12] Leviticus chapter 16 and we can read
[1:12:17] from verse 20 Leviticus chapter 16 I
[1:12:20] want us to just see a picture of the
[1:12:22] bounding power in the losing power year
[1:12:27] and when he had made an end of
[1:12:32] reconciling the holy place and the
[1:12:35] tabernacle of the congregation and the
[1:12:38] altar he shall bring the life God
[1:12:44] and Aaron shall lay his hands upon the
[1:12:48] head of the life God and confess over
[1:12:53] him all the iniquities of the children
[1:12:56] of Israel and all their transgression in
[1:13:00] in all the ascent spotting them upon the
[1:13:04] head of the God and she sent him away by
[1:13:09] the hand of a faith man into the
[1:13:12] wilderness and the God shall bear upon
[1:13:15] him all their iniquities onto the lane
[1:13:21] net inhabited and he shall let go the
[1:13:26] gold in the wilderness praise the Lord
[1:13:29] Amen now so we see here God is assuring
[1:13:36] year true the priesthood as we looking
[1:13:40] at this at this bound in power now
[1:13:42] remember over in in some chapter 103
[1:13:47] that we have just read David said you
[1:13:50] know the law being mindful of us has not
[1:13:55] there with us according to our
[1:13:58] iniquities he Naurang our frame he nor
[1:14:02] him you know who we are he knowing that
[1:14:06] even some of the things that you know we
[1:14:09] are trapped into his is you know there
[1:14:13] are things that comes down from you know
[1:14:17] through our change that comes from our
[1:14:20] grandfather you know God knows all about
[1:14:22] this he understand everything about it
[1:14:25] praise the Lord amen
[1:14:27] but yet David says this that ask the
[1:14:30] east is far from the west and also
[1:14:34] listening to the statement also he said
[1:14:36] as a father pitieth his children amen
[1:14:42] then we know that the mind of the Father
[1:14:46] Jesus expressed the mind of the father
[1:14:49] when he said all that the father has
[1:14:51] given me will come and now one will be
[1:14:57] lost
[1:14:58] praise the Lord that's what this
[1:15:01] bounding power is all about it's almost
[1:15:05] like butter bread I'm talking about that
[1:15:07] great magnet speaking about the rapture
[1:15:11] it's a power that keeps it's a power
[1:15:14] that draws he says if I be lifted up I
[1:15:17] will draw all men and we together so
[1:15:23] it's in in in God's mind in his infinite
[1:15:27] mind he lays out out of this so you ever
[1:15:30] said he's telling Moses here
[1:15:32] when you come to this place and of the
[1:15:35] same offering you bring to God and he
[1:15:39] says the first God is going to be for
[1:15:43] the Lord that is the God that is going
[1:15:47] to be killed that's going to be
[1:15:50] sacrificed for the people and then the
[1:15:53] next God is going to be a scapegoat
[1:15:57] praise the Lord
[1:15:58] so the priest comes he laid his hands
[1:16:01] upon the scapegoat he confessed his
[1:16:04] scene he confessed the scene of the
[1:16:06] people he confessed the scene of the
[1:16:08] nation then is given to this man you
[1:16:13] know and then he goes as far into a
[1:16:16] place in the wilderness where nobody has
[1:16:19] inhabited he's going to go to a place
[1:16:22] where the God will now be able to trace
[1:16:25] his way back that's odd
[1:16:28] that is as far as he's going to go
[1:16:32] praise the Lord and that God is going to
[1:16:36] be it let loose it will wonders and
[1:16:40] wander and Wonder and wander until it
[1:16:43] dies praise the Lord
[1:16:46] when it does huh is that it's neither
[1:16:50] priests business he don't know anything
[1:16:51] about it he just said that God I'll and
[1:16:58] it goes out that's the losing power
[1:17:02] praise the Lord the God that is
[1:17:05] sacrificed for the people writing the
[1:17:08] camp that's the bound in power
[1:17:11] now listen to brother branham as he as
[1:17:13] he as he talks about this a little bit
[1:17:15] now before we get to that we read this
[1:17:18] the last time and I want to take that
[1:17:21] again poor the best there test that year
[1:17:32] he says our Heavenly Father you said
[1:17:34] whatever you bind on earth shall be
[1:17:37] bound in heaven whatever you loose shall
[1:17:40] be loosed in heaven Lord that's your
[1:17:44] word is that the Word of God let's say
[1:17:48] amen amen
[1:17:50] he says who so ever seen is remade now
[1:17:56] what is happening here is that he's
[1:17:58] taking these two promises together
[1:18:01] whatsoever is bound on earth will be
[1:18:04] bound whatsoever is loosed will be
[1:18:07] loosed who so ever seen is remade it
[1:18:11] will be remitted who so ever seen is
[1:18:13] retaining it's trying to bring their two
[1:18:16] promises together it looks like two
[1:18:19] different promises but they are speaking
[1:18:21] of the same thing are we together
[1:18:33] also ever seen you remain to them it
[1:18:35] would be remanded who's ever seen you
[1:18:38] retain to them it will be retain it
[1:18:40] that's what you promised and now in
[1:18:45] obedience to your word I lay my hands
[1:18:48] upon our sister and bless her and to
[1:18:52] lose her from this trouble in the name
[1:18:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ and just like I
[1:18:58] said if you go instead of brother
[1:19:01] Branham caught on on the places that he
[1:19:03] used this bounding and loosing he used
[1:19:06] them all in the prayer line rebuking
[1:19:09] sicknesses from off of God's children
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:13] claiming them for healing that's the
[1:19:17] binding power that's what the burning
[1:19:18] power supposed to do is supposed to keep
[1:19:21] healing in the camp it's supposed to
[1:19:24] keep us healthy amen
[1:19:27] and the losing power supposed to set us
[1:19:30] free from the things that are not of God
[1:19:34] like he says the Word of God is a
[1:19:37] two-edged sword we can also look at it
[1:19:40] like that because all that is that
[1:19:45] wishes not of God and it keeps in that
[1:19:48] wishes of God in the church ages he says
[1:19:53] this is a good principle for us to learn
[1:19:55] he says for us to encourage what is what
[1:19:58] is right and discourage what is wrong
[1:20:05] the bounding and the losing power so
[1:20:09] yeah he takes those two promises in a
[1:20:12] word he brings them together because in
[1:20:15] the mouth of one of two or three let
[1:20:18] every word be established he stands upon
[1:20:21] death and he rebukes sickness from upon
[1:20:24] their sister let's take this one again
[1:20:28] Jehovah Jireh Woo's whosoever seen you
[1:20:30] remain to them they are remitted
[1:20:33] whosoever sins you retain to them they
[1:20:36] are retain it but how did they do it
[1:20:39] Peter said the one that had the keys to
[1:20:43] it on the days of Pentecost he
[1:20:46] say repaint every one of you and be
[1:20:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:53] for the remission of your sin praise the
[1:20:59] Lord
[1:21:00] amen he says that's how it is done by
[1:21:03] accepting the word praise the Lord
[1:21:12] because that word as ayah said his word
[1:21:16] go out and it will now return back to
[1:21:18] him vow when the word goes out it goes
[1:21:21] and it attracts the ILIT all the ls are
[1:21:24] attracted to the word praise the Lord
[1:21:29] that's the burning power to bring God's
[1:21:32] children home
[1:21:44] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost is that rice he show it's not
[1:21:50] nothing man can do is what God has done
[1:21:56] amen so right here in Leviticus chapter
[1:22:00] 16
[1:22:02] Christ is the high priest
[1:22:05] Christ is the God that was sacrifice and
[1:22:11] Christ is also the scapegoat
[1:22:16] He fulfilled oh praise the Lord amen
[1:22:25] he's also the man that takes the
[1:22:28] scapegoat just as he is the high priest
[1:22:30] that sacrificed the life God he's the
[1:22:33] man that takes us that the scapegoat
[1:22:36] into the wilderness where burns a seared
[1:22:41] position of a believer any stripped and
[1:22:46] a scripture to logic teacher who know
[1:22:50] the scapegoat of the Old Testament and
[1:22:53] so far he was both Christ I know you
[1:22:59] have there Brethren's here believe that
[1:23:02] the devil was the scapegoat but no no no
[1:23:05] no Christ was both both death and
[1:23:12] resurrection you see and he bought ours
[1:23:18] our sin away and then came forth in the
[1:23:22] resurrection and so it so it was Christ
[1:23:26] being represented for for the church he
[1:23:31] took the church place of sin and was
[1:23:35] cast into outer darkness into hell rose
[1:23:39] again the today God raised him up for
[1:23:42] our justification and he did that all
[1:23:47] the basis of one scripture I love that
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:51] he says on one Scripture and off a
[1:23:56] meaning
[1:23:57] sir who'll it's a backslide spoke the
[1:24:00] scripture was that Minister David he's
[1:24:03] just taking it in that time you know I
[1:24:08] will not leave his soul in Hell neither
[1:24:12] will I suffer my Holy One to see
[1:24:15] corruption
[1:24:16] the owner scripture I find in the Old
[1:24:19] Testaments book by prophecy that God was
[1:24:23] going to do it so he did he did not
[1:24:27] leave his soul in hell and the reason
[1:24:31] Jesus knew that within three days he
[1:24:36] will rise up again because it was poking
[1:24:38] there he will not leave his holy one in
[1:24:41] hell
[1:24:42] praise the Lord amen and then brother
[1:24:47] Branham is even making it beautiful year
[1:24:50] that that the resurrection of Jesus
[1:24:53] Christ
[1:24:54] hang on the prophecy of a backsliding
[1:24:57] preacher
[1:24:58] David David crying to God in repentance
[1:25:04] of his sin
[1:25:06] he was crying to God take not your Holy
[1:25:11] Spirit away from me restored onto me in
[1:25:15] the joy of my salvation he says I know
[1:25:17] you and I'll leave your Holy One in Hell
[1:25:21] crying to God in repentance but yet it
[1:25:24] was a prophecy to bring our Lord out of
[1:25:27] the grave praise the Lord
[1:25:32] what is that is the bound in power the
[1:25:37] same thing that will bring him closer to
[1:25:39] God will also lose him of the things I
[1:25:42] want to take him far away from God are
[1:25:48] we together I want us to see it here in
[1:25:53] in the life of of the scapegoat he says
[1:25:56] he represented in Old Testament they had
[1:26:00] a sin offering at the cleansing of the
[1:26:03] center order he says and they are seen
[1:26:06] offering was dead they taking to God's
[1:26:10] and one was killed in the other God how
[1:26:14] the same debt was placed upon that upon
[1:26:20] the dead God put upon the lifeguard
[1:26:23] remember Jesus was a sheep I love this I
[1:26:26] mean he was a sheep he was alarmed but
[1:26:31] in this case he became a god he was
[1:26:39] righteousness because he was God the
[1:26:44] Sheep but he came a God saying that he
[1:26:49] might be the sin offering for me and for
[1:26:53] you from a sheep to a God and Jesus was
[1:26:59] represented in in in both animals and
[1:27:02] also in both goat for one he died he
[1:27:08] died for the atooma in the second one
[1:27:10] the scene from the Atomium was put upon
[1:27:13] the Skip God and the Skip go talk the
[1:27:16] scene of the people and when fire into
[1:27:20] the wilderness to bear the scene of the
[1:27:23] people what was it it was the death and
[1:27:28] the barrier of our Lord Jesus amen he
[1:27:38] says and that God had to go out into the
[1:27:41] wilderness and dine and to be out there
[1:27:44] alone among the beasts and so forth
[1:27:49] Jesus had to be their God I want you to
[1:27:55] notice he was alarmed he was a sheep but
[1:28:00] he was made good for you and I that we
[1:28:04] being God might be made sheep amen
[1:28:10] we brain being seen a guilty of the F
[1:28:13] subject to death and also out on the
[1:28:17] condemnation yet Christ became me that I
[1:28:20] through His grace might become him
[1:28:23] a son of God seated at the right hand of
[1:28:27] God in glory the love that he had how he
[1:28:32] expressed it how he had to to make
[1:28:37] himself what he was to die to save us
[1:28:42] praise the Lord and we have that bound
[1:28:47] in power today praise the Lord
[1:28:51] remember whatever we bind on earth will
[1:28:56] be bound in heaven you ever think about
[1:29:00] it the 1000 year reign with Christ and
[1:29:06] the Bible says Satan will be bound for
[1:29:12] 1,000 years
[1:29:14] it's that bound in power
[1:29:16] I mean God is going to get his Saints
[1:29:20] and we're all going to be 100% now we
[1:29:26] all as a body makes hundred percent well
[1:29:29] at that time every individual is going
[1:29:31] to be hundred percent now we are now
[1:29:34] hundred percent as an individual but I
[1:29:37] support it we are hundred percent are
[1:29:40] you honest enemy amen
[1:29:42] but at that time every son of God and
[1:29:45] every daughter of God is going to be one
[1:29:48] hundred percent and Satan will be bound
[1:29:54] praise the Lord
[1:29:57] amen he will be bound we will live in
[1:30:01] there in in in the fullness of
[1:30:04] righteousness the abounding power is
[1:30:10] going to keep evil to us from our mind
[1:30:13] 1,000 years praise is going to be on our
[1:30:18] left
[1:30:19] amen our torch is going to be God's
[1:30:23] taught and we together and then one
[1:30:30] right after the 1,000 years he will be
[1:30:34] loosed
[1:30:36] so we would come right back to the place
[1:30:39] again of fighting my battles and making
[1:30:42] decision praise the Lord
[1:30:47] whatsoever power or whatsoever you bind
[1:30:51] on earth will be bound what am i driving
[1:30:55] toward with this verbatim says the
[1:30:58] church is almost losing its bounding
[1:31:00] power praise the Lord it's where we get
[1:31:12] to the place and and you know we live in
[1:31:16] on a privilege and you know it's almost
[1:31:19] like we want to get in by the skin of
[1:31:23] our teeth in and and think they're all
[1:31:26] yeah we we have to know that we
[1:31:28] ourselves and daughters of God now that
[1:31:30] we are going to be now we are praise the
[1:31:36] Lord and the prophet of God said we you
[1:31:38] have that power in you it's lying
[1:31:40] dormant amen
[1:31:42] you have to know you have that
[1:31:43] quickening power in you you have that
[1:31:45] bounding power in you and you can go
[1:31:47] right back to the word and keep away
[1:31:49] from your life what is not of God praise
[1:31:58] the Lord
[1:31:58] I was talking over to those galaxies in
[1:32:03] the air in the book of Galatians and
[1:32:05] then you were selling them the very same
[1:32:07] thing that Christ has free us from it
[1:32:09] looks like we are entangling our set
[1:32:11] back in it in the church age Bock he
[1:32:14] says he that have loosed us with his own
[1:32:18] blood we're balances then it has to be a
[1:32:22] perfect Muhsin
[1:32:31] praise the Lord now what I'm trying to
[1:32:35] establish with this stud aside ragged is
[1:32:38] it's in the place that the both the
[1:32:42] bounding powered and the losing power
[1:32:44] was what was given to the church to be
[1:32:46] to be used by the church let against the
[1:32:50] church even when it comes over to to
[1:32:54] Matthew chapter chapter 18 as we as we
[1:32:56] said it together and and a man that that
[1:33:00] has get got himself in in a rebellious
[1:33:02] form and we're not listening to
[1:33:04] correction the how power is even used
[1:33:06] against him to bring him back to God
[1:33:11] because he's a son of God amen because
[1:33:21] he's a son of God he has Christ here
[1:33:23] fulfilling the sacrifice God and he's
[1:33:28] also fulfilling the scapegoat
[1:33:38] even though he said God is an animal but
[1:33:42] you think about it that innocent animal
[1:33:44] cut taking from all from him on his
[1:33:47] friends and he's going to be walk into
[1:33:51] the wilderness and even the man that is
[1:33:52] carrying him have to be careful before
[1:33:54] he gets lost because he got to carry
[1:34:00] this gold up the mountain down the
[1:34:03] valley carry him to a place where he
[1:34:11] would not be able to find his way back
[1:34:15] and he was loose and that is how much
[1:34:20] that God want to lose us from habit from
[1:34:26] the nature of sin from this life praise
[1:34:30] the Lord
[1:34:32] experiencing the power of God people
[1:34:37] that has been delivered the knows the
[1:34:38] knows exactly what I'm talking about
[1:34:42] that you can even thing in your mind
[1:34:44] that I used to do this and you can even
[1:34:47] trace your way back that's how much the
[1:34:50] blood of Jesus Christ moves us it takes
[1:34:53] it as far as the East is from the West
[1:34:59] praise the Lord
[1:35:06] so there's a power that the church has
[1:35:09] that God has given to his children just
[1:35:13] like jesus prayed in a matthew chapter
[1:35:16] 17 he said father these are mine don't
[1:35:19] take them out of the world but keep them
[1:35:21] here praise the Lord
[1:35:23] keep them right here but keep him in
[1:35:28] your loving I just like go see and also
[1:35:33] as a time it was right there in Egypt
[1:35:37] but Elsa ban empowered I kept light and
[1:35:40] gushing that free Goshen from all the
[1:35:45] Flies and all the frogs it was right
[1:35:50] there in Egypt but it was free from all
[1:35:52] of those plagues that was coming we have
[1:36:03] that burning power praise the Lord Amen
[1:36:08] or in the end is being used over and
[1:36:11] over glory be to God that is the reason
[1:36:17] why as a child of God and at the Church
[1:36:21] of the Living God we don't give up
[1:36:25] amen we don't give up because the father
[1:36:33] never give up on us I mean people come
[1:36:39] and you know they get strewed struggle
[1:36:42] to get discouraged and you know and then
[1:36:44] and that is the reason why God you know
[1:36:47] he will raise all people in the body he
[1:36:50] would take them through things and he
[1:36:52] would just give them such a faith even
[1:36:54] though they happy I own about about God
[1:36:56] will always keep them there it's almost
[1:37:04] like brother Branham says in in spoken
[1:37:06] word is old regionals he he said life
[1:37:08] comes through the body
[1:37:10] I mean life comes through the body we
[1:37:17] can have Church here we can we can have
[1:37:19] Church
[1:37:20] can have and have an assembly here today
[1:37:22] because there was a body that was here
[1:37:24] for life to come here whether it was two
[1:37:29] or three amen
[1:37:31] as long as that body was here life would
[1:37:34] definitely come here life comes through
[1:37:38] the body that's the power that's been
[1:37:47] given to the church is to be able to
[1:37:50] keep the good things in the things of
[1:37:54] God in the promises of God in and keep
[1:37:56] that thing of the enemy out there are
[1:38:05] some things I can say that you know that
[1:38:07] I really broke my spirit and I knew that
[1:38:10] God was sitting on his throne amen you
[1:38:16] know brother Branham said in the church
[1:38:19] order he says you know right you yo your
[1:38:24] requests and things and you see just
[1:38:26] laid him on the altar you know if you
[1:38:29] can lady on the auto or give it to the
[1:38:31] Deacons and they will lay on the altar
[1:38:33] and the son leader will come you know
[1:38:36] and and it's easy to just take those
[1:38:39] things in in a kind of a routine waiter
[1:38:44] in you know just like a church order and
[1:38:47] their end and the song leader come or
[1:38:51] that they can come and read the prayer
[1:38:52] request and you know and and we prayed
[1:38:56] about it then but sometimes God will put
[1:38:59] some things on your heart praise the
[1:39:02] Lord I felt so blessed last week
[1:39:06] preaching on the bound in power
[1:39:10] there are couple of checks that I've
[1:39:13] written and I sign it you know I I put
[1:39:19] my request here it's signed by Jesus
[1:39:22] Christ and co-signed by me praise the
[1:39:27] Lord and I keep them right here
[1:39:29] believing that God is going to cash them
[1:39:33] praise the Lord
[1:39:35] and talking on the bounding power and
[1:39:38] how God with that power that is given to
[1:39:41] the church we can call backsliders back
[1:39:43] to God amen
[1:39:46] we can pray strain into the weak and
[1:39:48] feeble once amen we can we can give
[1:39:51] desire to the ones that have no desire
[1:39:54] to serve God because when you get
[1:39:56] assaulted they will get testing that's
[1:40:00] what we're Branham said I mean internal
[1:40:04] life is living for others and on this
[1:40:13] check I wrote tough I don't know how it
[1:40:18] just came I was just sitting right here
[1:40:19] last week and I wrote sister Catherine
[1:40:23] Internet I've signed that thing and
[1:40:26] cache it believing that God is going to
[1:40:30] cash it oh my goodness me
[1:40:35] and I'll just preaching last week and
[1:40:38] now I'm not even knowing they're going
[1:40:39] to be here and I'll be the same and all
[1:40:42] of these people you know you know the
[1:40:46] aghast children praise the Lord
[1:40:49] if we believe that we has a binding
[1:40:51] power and with that bound in power and
[1:40:57] God's promise that whatever we bind on
[1:41:00] earth and we can do that for our loved
[1:41:03] ones
[1:41:05] amen we can do that for them you have to
[1:41:10] keep them close to your heart you have
[1:41:13] to love them you have to pray for them
[1:41:17] you have to clean them that's what the
[1:41:21] bound in power is the church on the
[1:41:25] Reformation you know talk that and win
[1:41:29] in an extreme you know and and apply s
[1:41:33] communication and I mean in a sense that
[1:41:36] the the kind of a base on the discipline
[1:41:40] but the purpose of the discipline is to
[1:41:43] keep all of God's children
[1:41:45] because jesus said now one the father
[1:41:47] would last so in whichever way that we
[1:41:53] have to get them back we have to get
[1:41:55] them back
[1:41:56] praise the Lord and realizing there they
[1:41:59] are they are fighting spirits that is
[1:42:01] even bigger than them that we can use
[1:42:03] the flesh to go out after them amen
[1:42:06] if you're not praying for them you just
[1:42:08] using the flesh if you hate to see them
[1:42:11] you just using the flesh whenever you
[1:42:15] see them and you put your eyes up or
[1:42:17] this one is just you just using the
[1:42:19] flesh that that would never be able to
[1:42:21] redeem God's children trace a lot jesus
[1:42:33] said he says when a strong man has taken
[1:42:37] over in your home and most of the time I
[1:42:42] tell people sometimes people are dealing
[1:42:44] with things that is bigger than them
[1:42:48] praise the Lord they are dealing with
[1:42:52] things that is bigger than they main and
[1:42:54] and sometimes they think they know what
[1:42:55] is didn't we
[1:43:02] but whatever you dealing with that you
[1:43:05] can get under control is bigger than you
[1:43:07] and you need to call for the man of the
[1:43:12] house amen
[1:43:15] you need to call for the man of this
[1:43:17] house to come and take it over because
[1:43:26] the purpose of the bounding power is to
[1:43:28] kick out anything that does not belong
[1:43:31] in the house amen
[1:43:34] Barbara I'm said it in restoration of
[1:43:41] the bride trained on one of those
[1:43:42] messages you see why if you go to your
[1:43:44] house tonight he says and you get home
[1:43:48] and then you just you meet intruder in
[1:43:50] your house playing music you know
[1:43:57] drinking alcohol and doing all of those
[1:44:00] things I mean just abuse in your home
[1:44:04] what are you going to do is about law
[1:44:06] the state has given us the right to call
[1:44:09] 9-1-1 I mean to ask those forces or axis
[1:44:19] people to get out of our house to keep
[1:44:24] them out because they do not belonged in
[1:44:30] that's the bound in power and the losing
[1:44:33] power you only want to keep in your
[1:44:34] house what you need to keep thee and
[1:44:37] that is the same thing about this house
[1:44:42] praise the Lord
[1:44:43] if the enemy bringing discouragement and
[1:44:47] he bring him pains and he brings in
[1:44:48] sickness he's trying to bring in all
[1:44:53] habits you have the right to call the
[1:44:56] enforcing agent which is the Holy Ghost
[1:45:00] to kick to kick it out
[1:45:08] praise the Lord we have the right to
[1:45:14] live as a son of God or to think as a
[1:45:16] son of God to believe as a son of God to
[1:45:21] enjoy this Holy Ghost enjoyed this
[1:45:24] promise of God praise the Lord so we see
[1:45:30] the principle right there of the
[1:45:32] bounding and the losing power in the
[1:45:37] life of the of this sacrifice that is
[1:45:42] made of the scapegoat and Christ
[1:45:46] forfeited all their birthday and she's
[1:45:47] also year let's read the end and we find
[1:45:50] a place to close here
[1:45:52] praise the Lord Amen sir we will see
[1:45:58] Jesus he says you don't have to know a
[1:46:01] whole lot like we sang tonight just used
[1:46:06] a little you have praise the Lord you
[1:46:11] don't have to know a whole lot you only
[1:46:13] have to know one person that's the Lord
[1:46:17] Jesus Christ to know him it's life
[1:46:20] that's the owner person you have to know
[1:46:23] to have eternal life to know him not
[1:46:28] know the Box not know the Creed's but
[1:46:32] know him is internal I've know him as
[1:46:36] your personal Savior know him as the one
[1:46:40] who has fill you with His goodness in
[1:46:43] His mercy that send the word away from
[1:46:48] you discharge it send it away like the
[1:46:53] scapegoat lose you that's the losing
[1:46:56] power
[1:46:58] Amen he have loosed you if we know that
[1:47:10] the prophet of God preached a message
[1:47:12] the cruelty of sin and a penalty that
[1:47:17] was paid for our sin praise the Lord
[1:47:22] that's the reason why Paul says over
[1:47:25] there in a book of in the book of Hebrew
[1:47:30] there for us to turn this grace down
[1:47:33] it's almost like trumping over the blood
[1:47:37] the very same blood that was paid for
[1:47:42] our sin it's in blood they have set us
[1:47:44] free that it's like we are walking over
[1:47:47] the blood of Jesus praise the Lord
[1:47:55] what should people keep anger and keep
[1:47:57] molly's and keep bitterness if we think
[1:48:08] about what Christ have done to set us
[1:48:11] free why should we hold dearly to these
[1:48:14] things why should people hold to to to
[1:48:18] unconfessed sin in their life
[1:48:24] he's not going back to the cross again
[1:48:26] to die why should we hold things in our
[1:48:32] life when there is a sacrifice when
[1:48:36] there is an atonement to set us free why
[1:48:41] can we exchange that and it's easy just
[1:48:52] accept the sacrifice accepting the word
[1:48:55] like Peter said believe repent and be
[1:48:58] baptized when we accept the word that
[1:49:05] word loses us it set us free
[1:49:11] it does not only set us free but it has
[1:49:15] the power to also keep us
[1:49:22] and those things will now roll back in
[1:49:25] our lives they might come and hang
[1:49:29] around and go around like like bees but
[1:49:34] we have faith to blow it away every time
[1:49:38] praise the Lord
[1:49:39] that's the bounding power you've been
[1:49:42] given the power to keep those things
[1:49:44] away that's the power that is in the
[1:49:51] church you be giving the power to keep
[1:49:57] the one you love so close to your heart
[1:50:01] and keep believing for them like Peter
[1:50:05] said believe you and your household
[1:50:08] shall be safe we have the bounty power
[1:50:21] to pray for all of these ones brother
[1:50:25] Antonin sister Esther all of these
[1:50:27] people amen
[1:50:29] you know the thing about it is it's not
[1:50:32] just church it's to realize that people
[1:50:36] come and sit on this blessed gospel they
[1:50:42] confess faith with us
[1:50:44] they sing glory be to God I am a child
[1:50:48] of the king it goes down into water
[1:50:54] baptism they walk down the aisle and
[1:50:58] take communion with us praise the Lord
[1:51:03] and then out of a sudden we don't see
[1:51:07] them again oh it's so easy to think of
[1:51:13] they are not serious all those people
[1:51:15] they're not serious they don't want to
[1:51:16] serve God and just feel with wardeness
[1:51:17] and all of that and we just going to
[1:51:23] give up like that you know how much work
[1:51:26] is put into getting someone to the water
[1:51:30] to be baptized you know how much work is
[1:51:33] put into getting people together from
[1:51:34] the house and come to church you pray
[1:51:37] for the service this morning you know
[1:51:44] how much work you put into when you say
[1:51:46] Lord just bless the service this morning
[1:51:48] we were the brothers and sisters as the
[1:51:49] travel sibling you know how much work
[1:51:51] you put into that because every power
[1:51:57] and spirit in hell is against that if
[1:52:02] it's left with the devil we should we
[1:52:05] should not have Wednesday service let's
[1:52:07] just be religious Sunday morning is
[1:52:09] enough we shouldn't even have special
[1:52:12] meetings let's just be like you know all
[1:52:19] the other churches so it's just so in
[1:52:20] the morning and everybody can come in
[1:52:22] their best suits in and comment and we
[1:52:24] can just get a good dedicated for the
[1:52:27] five minutes or 30 minutes service
[1:52:38] and after we have work someone like
[1:52:45] sister Esther
[1:52:46] we saw how coming to church in pains
[1:52:48] walking through those doors and so had
[1:52:51] the grace of God redress her and how can
[1:52:55] we for our hands church how can we be
[1:52:59] comfortable that someone like that we
[1:53:01] just go away from the grace of God what
[1:53:05] is our trophy what does our work the
[1:53:12] church you have a power to keep
[1:53:20] just as it is half for souls to coming
[1:53:23] to be safe issue we we must work hard to
[1:53:27] not let them go if they are sons and
[1:53:32] daughters of God we must keep him that's
[1:53:36] the power that is given to the church
[1:53:41] that was water the the the the church in
[1:53:45] the book of Acts belief as long as much
[1:53:48] as they could not give darkest unto
[1:53:51] death even the ones that were
[1:53:54] backsliding him and weak in faith the
[1:53:58] church was not just folding his hands
[1:53:59] and just giving up on people and we just
[1:54:04] find led to excuses if they were now of
[1:54:07] us that's why they left those are just
[1:54:10] poor excuses it just poor excuses do you
[1:54:23] know what we do into that sacrifice on
[1:54:25] cavalry because Christ did his work now
[1:54:33] it's our time he was the scapegoat when
[1:54:38] he was going to cavalry it was him and
[1:54:40] him alone the disciples could not even
[1:54:45] stay up to pray with him
[1:54:53] and you know what brother that was seven
[1:54:55] God before and you know a sister that
[1:54:57] was seven God before and you're getting
[1:54:59] out and we we just so easy give up I
[1:55:06] said well then maybe they are not elect
[1:55:10] or maybe they were come out I was fully
[1:55:13] virgin and we get all of these
[1:55:15] terminology flow in our minds let me
[1:55:23] tell you tonight water it is bright or
[1:55:25] it is foolish virgin all the ones that
[1:55:29] would be saved at the white throne
[1:55:31] judgment it was one blood that paid the
[1:55:34] price for all the redeemed the blood the
[1:55:39] bride don't have a different blood then
[1:55:41] the foolish virgin blood the bride don't
[1:55:44] have a different blood and up then the
[1:55:46] the the souls that will be saved in
[1:55:49] denomination there's not two different
[1:55:51] blood that saves them it was just one
[1:55:54] blood
[1:56:04] praise the Lord that's what I'm talking
[1:56:11] about they're bound in power
[1:56:20] we will not be able to give up in our
[1:56:23] lives we won't give up on our selves we
[1:56:27] when I give up on others
[1:56:37] musicians who can come let's bow our
[1:56:39] heads tonight
[1:56:55] that's why Jesus said he that would
[1:56:58] bring on offense is better a millstone
[1:57:01] be hanged on his neck he that would
[1:57:04] cause a stomach block to stop any of my
[1:57:07] little ones from coming in and Mail
[1:57:11] stone would be hanged on his neck is
[1:57:13] rather he Hank a millstone and drying
[1:57:15] himself because as far as the father is
[1:57:19] concerned he's not ready to lose any of
[1:57:21] his he can leave the ninety-nine and
[1:57:26] straight and go after one
[1:57:31] and that's what the burning power would
[1:57:33] do the binding power in you
[1:57:39] we scribe to keep that fire burning to
[1:57:41] keep to keep to keep a sacrifice on the
[1:57:44] altar
