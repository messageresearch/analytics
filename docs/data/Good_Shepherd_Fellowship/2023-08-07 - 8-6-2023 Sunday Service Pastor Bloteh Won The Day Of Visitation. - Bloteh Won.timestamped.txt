[35:42] that's a good thing uh Psalm chapter
[35:45] eight
[35:46] Psalm chapter eight this morning we want
[35:49] to speak on what is man that thou are
[35:52] mindful of him
[35:53] that's why we want to talk we want to we

[36:12] thank you
[36:14] praise the Lord
[36:17] Psalm chapter 8.
[36:20] Psalm chapter 8
[36:23] and let's let's do uh that's nine
[36:27] nine verses let's do a responsive
[36:29] reading if that's okay with you
[36:33] oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy
[36:36] name in all the Earth
[36:38] who have said that Glory above the
[36:40] heavens you read the next one
[36:53] when I consider the heavens The Works of
[36:57] thy fingers the moon and the stars which
[37:01] thou has ordained
[37:06] what is
[37:10] for thou had made him a little lower
[37:12] than the angels and have crowned him
[37:16] with Glory and Honor
[37:26] All Ships and oxen yeah and the beasts
[37:29] of the field
[37:37] let's read the last verse together
[37:40] oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy
[37:44] name in all the Earth praise the Lord as
[37:48] a Hebrew chapter 2.
[37:51] Hebrew chapter 2. now when you read the
[37:54] book of Hebrews not only read the book
[37:57] of Hebrew but if you study the book of
[37:59] Hebrew you will see because Paul was
[38:02] sending this letter to his people the
[38:05] Hebrews that's the reason why you see it
[38:08] does not have no introduction like Paul
[38:11] the Apostle no
[38:13] he did not introduce himself why because
[38:15] he was not accepted by them he was an
[38:18] apostle to the Gentiles
[38:20] so when he was sending this book to the
[38:22] to the Hebrew believers
[38:25] Paul from Hebrew chapter 1 to the last
[38:28] chapter you will see how he connected
[38:31] the Old Testament he kept showing them
[38:33] see this in the psalm see this what
[38:36] David says see this what Moses said
[38:39] he kept pointing them to the psalm I
[38:42] mean to the Old Testament over and over
[38:45] praise the Lord
[38:47] just to bring them to the place for them
[38:49] to realize that everything that was
[38:52] given honor the Lord was a time all of
[38:55] those things were fulfilled in Jesus
[38:57] Christ
[38:59] are we together
[39:01] praise the Lord so uh we take Hebrew
[39:05] chapter 2
[39:13] let's read from verse 5.
[39:17] I think we read a little bit of that it
[39:20] was chapter one we read on uh on
[39:22] Wednesday night
[39:24] For unto the angels have he not put in
[39:29] subject
[39:30] the word to come whereof we speak
[39:33] but one in a certain place testified who
[39:37] was that one David that we have just
[39:39] read one in a certain place testified
[39:43] saying what is man
[39:45] that thou are mindful of him
[39:48] or the son of man that thou visited him

[40:56] thinking about they are just just uh
[40:58] singing that song this morning that the
[41:00] word is working mightily in us so God uh
[41:04] above what we can feel what we can see

[42:18] thoughts in mind the reason we have we
[42:22] are focusing towards the word that is
[42:24] working my telling now we're going to
[42:27] see how the word uh uh work for for
[42:32] Entergy Mama the world worked for enter
[42:34] your mama uh because she was able to
[42:37] identify a scripture in the Bible
[42:41] praise the Lord in the book of Kings
[42:43] chapter 4 she was able to find a woman
[42:46] that looks just like her she was able to
[42:49] place herself in a scripture and so when
[42:52] she says that this woman condition looks
[42:54] like my condition Lord where is my
[42:57] Elijah God was able to bring her Elijah
[43:00] that's how the world works it does not
[43:03] works with our complaining
[43:05] it does not works it works with you
[43:08] identifying a promise
[43:10] and say Lord this is your word bring it
[43:13] to pass in my life
[43:15] are we together
[43:17] so let's let's let's read that
[43:19] uh
[43:21] does God God does encouragement to judge
[43:24] me with our first warning him that's
[43:26] what better Branham take this from but
[43:28] uh uh I think I look through the message
[43:31] close to about 29 different times uh he
[43:36] mentioned this testimony of Auntie
[43:38] Jemima
[43:40] then there there used to be a little

[44:00] about uh uh there are people every word
[44:03] one of them okay that's that's the song
[44:06] he was trying to refer to where I met
[44:08] this little color red woman you know
[44:10] standing out there let's continue to
[44:13] read
[44:14] [Music]

[44:54] wouldn't let it go somehow and they told
[44:57] me uh come get the holy the holy spirit
[45:00] said take a little trip and go down this
[45:03] way
[45:05] and I went
[45:07] walking down through there singing I
[45:09] talked
[45:11] my my plane about ready to leave just
[45:15] kept saying move on the Holy Spirit kept
[45:18] saying move on keep going keep going
[45:20] just that early part of my Ministry
[45:25] and I look
[45:26] leaning across the fence there and a
[45:30] little bitty uh Shanty a little place
[45:34] there there was an old sister standing
[45:38] there oh she was looked like one of
[45:43] these sisters
[45:45] on the antique Jemima pancake
[45:51] great big fat cheeks you know and her
[45:55] hair her shirt
[45:57] uh brought on back she leaned across the
[46:01] gate like that I will stop right there
[46:04] and if you can put up my picture
[46:08] and uh
[46:11] just pull up the picture
[46:14] okay
[46:15] just like how brother Brandon preached
[46:17] the message uh
[46:19] uh tinky's man fitter
[46:22] from a secretary Park this was the
[46:24] picture that he was referring to
[46:27] and that's where he took the name entity
[46:29] mama
[46:34] praise the Lord
[46:37] we got till tomorrow we don't know the
[46:39] woman name
[46:42] okay
[46:44] at first I wanted to
[46:46] to name myself wake up to enter your
[46:49] mama pancake
[46:52] I have to look for an inspiration to
[46:55] preach that because I found the court
[46:58] he said just like one of those sisters
[47:01] on the entity Mama pancake
[47:05] so because
[47:07] of this tine of the hair and he saw the
[47:10] lady tying her hair leaning over the
[47:13] fence that's the only thing he could
[47:15] remember
[47:16] to be able to put a name to the story
[47:21] so that's where the story entered your
[47:23] mama was birthed from that action in
[47:26] this picture
[47:28] so I hope you wake up this morning to
[47:30] empty your mama pancake
[47:33] praise the Lord God bless you take it
[47:34] down
[47:36] now so just like I said but the the
[47:39] interesting thing there is that uh
[47:44] she was able to find a place in the word
[47:48] right
[47:49] she find a scripture
[47:52] she says I'm just like this woman the
[47:54] shimmy night woman
[47:56] Lord where is my Elijah
[48:00] praise the Lord
[48:02] and out of desperation she went out and
[48:05] and she was just there waiting
[48:07] and brother bear I'm coming and uh uh
[48:10] you know not even know where he was
[48:12] going the Holy Ghost kept telling him
[48:13] you walk down there you go down there
[48:16] and you go down there and uh uh you know
[48:19] uh and uh
[48:23] and then the Holy Spirit kept telling
[48:26] him to go he didn't know where he was
[48:27] going praise the Lord never gave him a
[48:30] vision to describe the house or
[48:31] everything but it was one
[48:35] poor woman
[48:36] that had a dying child
[48:40] that was able to find a promise in the
[48:42] Bible
[48:44] it was her faith that was controlling
[48:46] the man of God
[48:50] praise the Lord
[48:51] how Faith was controlling the man of God
[48:54] and when brother Branham got down there
[48:56] she said good morning Pastor and you
[48:57] know the story just like bird brand said
[48:59] you know so that's why we are not
[49:01] reading everything he said good morning
[49:03] Pastor she said good morning Pastor Ben
[49:05] look over his shoulder he realized he
[49:07] was the only person there he says have
[49:09] it you know that I'm a passion
[49:11] praise the Lord and the thing about the
[49:14] story also that uh uh we must also
[49:18] realize we will have to know that there
[49:21] was a time where the the country had a
[49:23] lot of racial attention
[49:25] and the place that he was walking
[49:28] he was not supposed to be there
[49:31] okay
[49:32] but yes a man that was obeying the Holy
[49:35] Spirit not paying attention to what the
[49:38] atmosphere was around him he kept going
[49:41] he kept going he's looking at his watch
[49:44] uh uh well I mean when my plane leave
[49:46] then they leave but I felt in my heart
[49:48] that the Lord want me to go keep moving
[49:50] and he keep moving I believe everyone
[49:53] that was out there early morning was
[49:54] saying so what is this is that an FBI
[49:56] officer or you know what was going on
[49:59] here everybody looking at him strange
[50:01] but he's just obeying the Holy Spirit
[50:05] praise the Lord
[50:08] until the woman identified him as a
[50:11] preacher good morning person
[50:14] how do you know that I'm a passion the
[50:17] conversation started and then before
[50:20] brother Branham really understood that
[50:23] this was the reason why I was making the
[50:26] train
[50:28] praise the Lord before he honors to that
[50:32] this was the reason why
[50:37] after he went into the The House of the
[50:39] woman pray for the boy and uh you know
[50:43] uh the boy confessed and said Mama
[50:47] there is light in this place
[50:50] you know but Brian knew that well work
[50:53] was gone pick up his bag went rocking
[50:56] straight back there was no uh lift to
[50:58] other lift and he had to walk the same
[51:01] way he walked down he had to walk that
[51:02] way back got to the airport the scene
[51:05] the the his name was on the overhead
[51:07] William Branham William Branham this
[51:09] flight is about to leave
[51:12] so the word is working
[51:14] the word works
[51:17] this word it works

[51:22] it is the word that is governing the
[51:24] universe

[55:00] of the world and so he he's asking that
[55:04] we really really keep him in prayer
[55:06] praise the Lord amen the Lord was work a
[55:10] very tremendous thing in brother Farmers
[55:12] Health recently so we want to thank the
[55:14] Lord for that
[55:16] amen
[55:18] yeah I got uh I'll completely get out of
[55:22] what I was saying but Wednesday night we
[55:24] were we were talking about the word we
[55:26] were trying to the word of God is
[55:28] Shepherd in the two-edges swore okay and
[55:31] you uh I wanted to but you can go and
[55:33] search it out just you can just go and
[55:35] search it out uh you can put it right on
[55:38] Google and just and just look for the
[55:40] Bible verse that says the heart is
[55:42] incurable men in uh uh many uh different
[55:47] uh version of the Bible I think I think
[55:51] the I think the amplifier used the same
[55:55] let me let me quickly get there
[55:59] and what was that verse that we use on
[56:02] uh that was from Jeremiah we can
[56:04] remember
[56:07] on Wednesday night
[56:09] Jeremiah
[56:12] it's just anybody to remind us
[56:17] Jeremiah 17 9.
[56:23] okay
[56:27] Jeremiah 17 9.
[56:30] thank you
[56:36] if you if you read it out of the
[56:38] Amplified it says the heart is deceitful
[56:42] Above All Things
[56:43] and it is extremely sick
[56:48] it is extremely sick
[56:50] who can understand it fully and know a
[56:54] secret motives all the versions say the
[56:58] heart is incurable
[57:01] you see for the wicked and incurable
[57:05] so like I said on Friday Wednesday night
[57:08] that's what God has to give us a new
[57:10] heart now uh uh
[57:15] he has to give us a new heart
[57:18] so we were talking about how it takes
[57:20] the word
[57:22] it takes the word to be able to to
[57:26] address that's the only thing the soul
[57:28] of man can feed on
[57:31] praise the Lord
[57:32] that's the only thing the soul of man
[57:34] can feel on we read a cold weather band
[57:38] see science found that place in the
[57:40] heart of man where there is no blood
[57:42] vessel entered it's a little chamber and
[57:45] they believe that that compartment is
[57:48] where the soul is
[57:51] that's where the word gold is sharper
[57:54] than a two-edges sword to divide
[57:56] dividing asunder of the Soul and Spirit
[57:59] so we realize that in that chamber
[58:01] that's that's where our our rear brain
[58:05] is
[58:07] in that chamber where the world goes
[58:09] there
[58:10] and just like when we eat food
[58:13] the food goes to our body and then the
[58:16] the the the the you know the the the
[58:19] intestine does this work it breaks down
[58:21] the food there is there is other parts
[58:24] of the body that change HIV you know and
[58:26] and the blood the heart stop pumping it
[58:29] as a blood Distributing it all over the
[58:31] body you know so that that is the same
[58:34] way with uh with the word when we when
[58:37] we when the word is preached or we read
[58:40] the word and the Holy Spirit can drop
[58:42] that word down in our heart drop that
[58:44] word in that compartment then you know
[58:48] the Holy Ghost break it and then he
[58:50] distributed to our body the portion of
[58:52] the word that is for for healing he give
[58:54] it to you for healing the little part of
[58:56] it that is for knowledge you think that
[58:58] all you know too much that is just a
[59:00] little part it's a residue that he gives
[59:02] to you and you think now you know I get
[59:05] a revelation I just a waste product
[59:10] amen the actual thing goes in you for
[59:13] you to live the word
[59:16] God is more interested in us living the
[59:19] world
[59:21] amen
[59:23] then then just talking about it
[59:27] are we together
[59:29] now so uh as we as we talk about that
[59:32] and and then we we we read we read a
[59:36] quote about uh the the the cherubins I I
[59:39] kind of folk did not have time to go
[59:42] through all of that but what actually I
[59:44] I what I was doing was that or trying to
[59:48] achieve was to make us to know that uh
[59:51] the cherubim that were guarding the
[59:54] treat of life was actually they were
[59:56] guiding is the word
[59:58] the word is the Tree of Life
[1:00:01] amen man shall not lay by bread alone
[1:00:04] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:00:07] the mouth of God
[1:00:09] are we together amen you might you might
[1:00:12] run ahead of me and see the truth of
[1:00:14] life is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the
[1:00:16] word
[1:00:17] the tree of life was not Jesus Christ
[1:00:19] yeah uh it was Christ it was I was it
[1:00:23] was the anointed word for that time
[1:00:25] praise the Lord yeah
[1:00:28] because I know that we are all smart
[1:00:31] people you know more smart people in the
[1:00:34] building they mean so let me help myself
[1:00:36] out quickly before I get in trouble
[1:00:40] praise the Lord now so uh so uh so the
[1:00:44] the cherubins were guiding the word
[1:00:48] now you have to realize there as as they
[1:00:51] were they will partake of that word they
[1:00:53] were to live forever but they break the
[1:00:56] word
[1:00:57] they left the word
[1:00:59] amen so the child being was was keeping
[1:01:03] them from the word that will keep them
[1:01:06] to live forever because they have
[1:01:09] already brought the word and a portion
[1:01:10] of the word say the day you eat of this
[1:01:12] fruit that day you will die
[1:01:15] so for them to constantly be going back
[1:01:17] going that honor his word
[1:01:19] they have already eat of the fruit they
[1:01:21] must die
[1:01:24] praise the Lord now so brother Branham
[1:01:27] says something here that is very very
[1:01:28] interesting I want I want you to listen
[1:01:30] to it so we can we can be able to go on
[1:01:33] right here he said earnestly concerning
[1:01:36] for the Fate
[1:01:38] praise the Lord and enslake containing
[1:01:41] for the faith he says right here then
[1:01:43] they both come up to worship before God
[1:01:46] talking about uh Aaron and Eve and I
[1:01:50] believe it was it was east of the gate
[1:01:54] and I believe they come right up before
[1:01:56] his presence their word
[1:01:59] where their flaming sword was running
[1:02:02] around the east side of the gate that's
[1:02:06] the cherubins now like that guiding the
[1:02:09] treat of Life Look yerry said I hope you
[1:02:11] get it just as sure as man is man is
[1:02:17] born of a woman he has to die
[1:02:21] praise the Lord he says I hope you get
[1:02:23] this they were the the cherubians were
[1:02:26] guiding the tree of life because they
[1:02:29] have broke the word so it was sure that
[1:02:32] man born of woman Must Die
[1:02:36] they cannot Escape that
[1:02:40] and live forever
[1:02:42] they have broke the word they must die
[1:02:45] so for God to ever
[1:02:48] take that
[1:02:50] curse of death away he have to take it
[1:02:53] upon himself
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:55] okay so he says just as short as a man
[1:02:58] born a woman
[1:03:01] has to die
[1:03:03] is just that show if he's born of Christ
[1:03:07] he got to live
[1:03:10] praise the Lord
[1:03:12] amen so you see why now
[1:03:16] the the the the the the the the
[1:03:19] cherubings
[1:03:21] gathered their soul back like we said on
[1:03:24] Wednesday night
[1:03:26] they have to put their soul back why
[1:03:28] because one has come and he has taken
[1:03:32] the curse of death
[1:03:34] so now instead of then God in the treat
[1:03:37] of Life they have to now lead us back to
[1:03:40] the treat of life
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:45] so the man born a woman without Christ
[1:03:48] will surely die and perish
[1:03:51] but when a man is born in Christ
[1:03:55] better man says nothing can stop it
[1:03:58] are we together
[1:04:00] if he's born of Christ he got to live he
[1:04:03] got to live
[1:04:05] he can help it you just can't help it if
[1:04:09] you are just stubborn God will just call
[1:04:11] you of the earth that's all you can help
[1:04:13] it
[1:04:14] if you are born of Christ there is
[1:04:16] nothing you can do
[1:04:20] to drive yourself by you go to hell hair
[1:04:22] will reject you
[1:04:27] right are we together
[1:04:31] if he's born of Christ he got to live he
[1:04:33] got to live he can't help it he got
[1:04:36] eternal life Christ said he had it now
[1:04:40] in that day God in a treat of life then
[1:04:43] forgetting it they were guiding the
[1:04:46] children of life so they can't get it
[1:04:48] they can't get to it now their sword
[1:04:51] turned right back the other way running
[1:04:54] them down to the treat of life
[1:04:57] the soul has turned now so the cherubins
[1:05:00] were guarding the word and the reason
[1:05:02] why I'm making the emphasis on that is
[1:05:04] because that the anointing of God in the
[1:05:08] word is the same anointing that has come
[1:05:11] on the five for Ministry
[1:05:14] when we talk about the the Apostle the
[1:05:17] the the the the
[1:05:19] evangelists the the the the the
[1:05:23] prophet the pastor the teacher you know
[1:05:27] uh uh I'm using my five fingers to
[1:05:29] remember you have to realize that until
[1:05:31] I place them in the five fingers so I'm
[1:05:33] using my five fingers to remember them
[1:05:35] so uh uh uh
[1:05:39] is that seem anointing and the reason
[1:05:41] why I want to make that emphasis is
[1:05:44] because the purpose is what to lead us
[1:05:47] to the tree of life not to make a church
[1:05:50] not to make a denomination
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] praise the Lord and is that same
[1:05:57] anointing God in the word that comes on
[1:06:00] the believer
[1:06:02] as the gifts of the Spirit
[1:06:05] it must lead us to the word not to make
[1:06:08] one person spiritual in the church
[1:06:11] not to make you an idol
[1:06:14] is the same spirit that has come they
[1:06:16] are same anointing has come even in our
[1:06:19] home
[1:06:20] it must guide us toward the word
[1:06:24] now that in our family that's it we are
[1:06:26] not protecting family dignity what we
[1:06:30] are called to protect is the word we are
[1:06:33] now protecting family property ananias
[1:06:36] and so far I try to do it
[1:06:38] they died
[1:06:39] because they were not protecting the
[1:06:41] word
[1:06:47] everything must lead back to the word
[1:06:51] praise the Lord now you see when we have
[1:06:54] that understanding when we have that
[1:06:57] understanding
[1:06:59] even even as a preacher as a pastor and
[1:07:02] when I understand that that is my
[1:07:04] responsibility and I realize I'm not
[1:07:06] Leading the People Back to the word I
[1:07:08] must I must I must caution myself
[1:07:13] praise the Lord the same thing in in in
[1:07:16] in you know in in every in every part of
[1:07:19] uh the church in every part of our lives
[1:07:22] praise the Lord
[1:07:27] take for example under the Old Testament
[1:07:29] type if you take what is what was
[1:07:31] happening there in uh in in Jericho or
[1:07:35] in in Canada land with with with aircon
[1:07:40] they had a promise
[1:07:42] there was the the word was they were not
[1:07:44] supposed to take nothing from nothing of
[1:07:47] the land
[1:07:49] we spoke about it God told him
[1:07:52] everything Jericho is mine
[1:07:55] the whole city will be burned down the
[1:07:57] only thing that will be saved was Rahab
[1:07:59] in her household
[1:08:01] that's the only tie that God took out of
[1:08:03] Jericho
[1:08:06] are we together
[1:08:11] so you see it gets to the place where we
[1:08:14] don't protect
[1:08:15] personal interests
[1:08:19] the only thing we must protect is the
[1:08:21] word
[1:08:24] that's the only thing we must protect
[1:08:27] if we want the word to work for you
[1:08:30] you must protect the word
[1:08:33] not personal interests
[1:08:37] praise the Lord sometimes erupt against
[1:08:40] us as parents sometimes erupt against us
[1:08:43] even as husband and wife
[1:08:47] praise the Lord
[1:08:51] but if we want the word to work my
[1:08:54] telling
[1:08:55] for you
[1:08:57] lead your husband back to the word say
[1:08:59] honey that's not the word
[1:09:02] lead your wife back to the website I
[1:09:05] love you but this is not the word
[1:09:13] praise the Lord
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:20] I mean Lord never talk
[1:09:24] he stood there and never talked but then
[1:09:27] his wife turned to a pillow of salt
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:34] are we together
[1:09:36] that that that is the principle I'm
[1:09:38] trying to bring out that's that's word
[1:09:41] I'm trying for us to be able to to
[1:09:43] understand
[1:09:45] the position of these cherubimes
[1:09:51] because the word was broken they were to
[1:09:53] protect
[1:09:54] so that's the reason why I honor the Old
[1:09:57] Testament they were all under the blood
[1:09:59] of bulls and goat
[1:10:01] eternal life will never struck the human
[1:10:03] soul until God came and gave his own
[1:10:07] life
[1:10:09] are we together
[1:10:11] then the the cherubies now took their
[1:10:14] sword and put it in their shade
[1:10:17] let's go this way
[1:10:19] and they are now driving us so that
[1:10:21] anointing comes on the fight for
[1:10:23] Ministry God uh Paul says when he has
[1:10:26] sent it up high he gave gifts to man
[1:10:29] that's what we want to do is he gave the
[1:10:31] same anointing that was guiding the Tree
[1:10:34] of Life to come back on the church to
[1:10:36] lead us back to the presence of God
[1:10:39] you'll realize that the same anointing
[1:10:41] came on the church ages if you read the
[1:10:44] church ages book you a real life better
[1:10:46] man said the first three Church Ages
[1:10:48] were the ages of great missionary work I
[1:10:51] was trying to do a PowerPoint this
[1:10:53] morning and uh just it was I was just
[1:10:55] going crazy about it so the first
[1:10:57] Three Ages is the age of
[1:11:02] a great missionary work he said what was
[1:11:04] that he said that was honor the Lions
[1:11:06] anointing
[1:11:08] amen
[1:11:11] it was honor then the Lions anointing
[1:11:13] now you have to know that this these are
[1:11:15] the ages
[1:11:18] praise the Lord
[1:11:20] the fourth age there was the Dark Age
[1:11:23] was honor what
[1:11:25] the ox anointing
[1:11:28] right they have the anointing to walk
[1:11:31] right into death
[1:11:33] they were the bed and Bearer
[1:11:35] the stool for his name
[1:11:37] they never back off
[1:11:40] amen that was the age of persecution God
[1:11:44] put that anointing on them
[1:11:46] some of them got married right in the in
[1:11:49] their Arena before the lion will eat
[1:11:51] them
[1:11:53] they took the about kiss their loved
[1:11:56] ones say I'll see you on the other side
[1:11:59] they had the anointing to bear that
[1:12:04] amen cities and uh and Philadelphia came
[1:12:08] under the man's anointing
[1:12:13] praise the Lord
[1:12:15] it came under the man's anointing that's
[1:12:18] the reason why when you look in in the
[1:12:20] church ages you will realize that you
[1:12:23] look in history it was just about the
[1:12:25] very same time where the printing press
[1:12:27] was born
[1:12:29] right
[1:12:32] praise the Lord
[1:12:35] now laudisha Church age is on the ego's
[1:12:40] anointing War to call a people out
[1:12:45] the ego's anointing comes on loudish
[1:12:48] your Edge and cry Revelation 18 4 come
[1:12:51] out of all my people
[1:12:53] to call a people out so you see and what
[1:12:57] all of this is doing God in every age is
[1:13:00] guiding the people back to the Tree of
[1:13:01] Life guiding the people back to the true
[1:13:04] word of God
[1:13:06] when Paul and and and and and and all of
[1:13:09] those men Arenas in the in the in the in
[1:13:11] the first three Ages were were carrying
[1:13:13] our missionary work they were putting
[1:13:15] the people back to to the to the word
[1:13:18] pointing the people back to the word so
[1:13:20] you see that is the anointing of the
[1:13:22] cherubings that's their same anointing
[1:13:25] they are stood in the Garden of Eden is
[1:13:28] the same anointing that has come on the
[1:13:30] church but the work is changed now
[1:13:35] is to call the people back to God
[1:13:39] are we together
[1:13:42] and don't forget my emphasis my emphasis
[1:13:45] is only the word can do it
[1:13:48] church program will never do it we can
[1:13:51] come up with different programs let's
[1:13:53] let's do this program Let's do ribbing
[1:13:55] let's let's do uh let's say a flower it
[1:13:58] will never do it the only thing that
[1:14:00] would bring people back to the world the
[1:14:02] only thing that will line up our home is
[1:14:05] the word the only thing that will
[1:14:07] strengthen our church is the word
[1:14:10] amen the only thing that was
[1:14:13] strengthened our individual life is the
[1:14:15] word men shall not live by bread alone
[1:14:18] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:14:21] the mouth of God
[1:14:26] praise the Lord
[1:14:28] Barbarian said you want to start
[1:14:29] anything he says stop with the word
[1:14:35] if you don't start with the word you
[1:14:37] will have trouble
[1:14:39] because the word is the original seed
[1:14:42] that we bring forth of its kind
[1:14:46] are we together
[1:14:48] I'm trying to use this and uh and and
[1:14:52] and and and try to wrap this whole thing
[1:14:54] up because uh uh just like I said I want
[1:14:57] to get back to to Paul a prisoner
[1:15:00] we went the weight of Paul and Apostle
[1:15:02] that's what took us into the gifts and
[1:15:04] and Paul at seven of Jesus Christ the
[1:15:07] purpose of the ministering is to save
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:12] you are called
[1:15:14] as an apostle you are sin
[1:15:18] that's your office
[1:15:20] your office is an apostle
[1:15:24] your job duty is to self
[1:15:29] praise the Lord
[1:15:31] your office is Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:34] your duty that God called you is to self
[1:15:40] praise the Lord
[1:15:41] so if you sit there and think that
[1:15:44] because you have the office now so
[1:15:47] you're the one that's supposed to be
[1:15:48] self
[1:15:50] you get it wrong
[1:15:52] praise the Lord you get it completely
[1:15:54] wrong
[1:15:58] are we together
[1:16:01] it's just like I was running on the
[1:16:03] trail map
[1:16:05] when I talked so fast just now
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:15] I want for us to look at this
[1:16:17] let's look at this this promise over
[1:16:19] there what is man that died of mindful
[1:16:21] of him
[1:16:23] and the son of man that thou visited him
[1:16:27] now you see there the the worst son of
[1:16:30] man came in that prophecy
[1:16:35] that is something I want for us to look
[1:16:37] at because
[1:16:38] the way David said it
[1:16:41] that is a very strong prophecy
[1:16:45] very very strong
[1:16:47] is so deep
[1:16:49] I was looking at there
[1:16:52] yesterday was telling and I took the
[1:16:55] word visit what is man that thou visited
[1:16:58] him
[1:16:59] praise the Lord
[1:17:01] now if you look at that it's a it's a
[1:17:04] Hebrew word
[1:17:06] and is supposed to be pronounced Paul
[1:17:10] Carter that hope is the right
[1:17:12] pronunciation but uh uh you know Hebrew
[1:17:15] you have to know how to make your tongue
[1:17:18] to stick up in your mouth and for you to
[1:17:20] hold your worst I don't know how to do
[1:17:22] that but it says here that uh primarily
[1:17:26] root the root of that word
[1:17:29] to visit
[1:17:31] it could be friendly
[1:17:34] or hostile intent
[1:17:38] so what does it give you the idea there
[1:17:41] is that God visit his people friendly by
[1:17:45] blessing them and he also visited with
[1:17:49] joshmin
[1:17:51] now so if you go back in the Bible which
[1:17:54] of course will look at some few few
[1:17:56] verses here to be able to lay that down
[1:17:58] let it out so you can understand it what
[1:18:01] is man that thou visited him
[1:18:05] in a man you are mindful of him and the
[1:18:07] son of man that thou visited him and so
[1:18:11] you you will realize that the Bible says
[1:18:15] when he uh descended he that ascended
[1:18:18] descended first and he ascended of heart
[1:18:20] and he gave gifts to man
[1:18:23] praise the Lord amen so when he gives to
[1:18:27] man in one sense what God was doing he
[1:18:31] was visiting us
[1:18:34] you see that's the reason why we want to
[1:18:37] be sure of The Giver
[1:18:40] before the gift
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:46] we want to be sure of The Giver
[1:18:52] are we together
[1:18:54] because
[1:18:57] you will see over and over in the
[1:18:59] scripture as we as we were studied
[1:19:01] together uh this morning if we can run
[1:19:05] quickly and look at Psalm 106 verse 4.
[1:19:09] Remember Me Oh Lord wave the favor
[1:19:13] that thou beareth upon the people oh
[1:19:17] visit me where visit me with thy
[1:19:20] salvation
[1:19:23] amen now keep that scripture in your
[1:19:27] mind look at another one that that we
[1:19:29] that we that we read all the time that
[1:19:31] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:19:34] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:19:36] keep that in in your mind now and see
[1:19:38] and see how beautiful these these two uh
[1:19:42] uh scripture were kind of a line of you
[1:19:45] are we together
[1:19:46] second Corinthians chapter six
[1:19:58] you know because when you look at this
[1:19:59] principle about Lord
[1:20:02] uh uh uh you know Savior and Lord
[1:20:05] Brothers since the people don't want him
[1:20:07] to be Lord
[1:20:09] to rule over them they just want God to
[1:20:11] be an Aaron born when we have a need oh
[1:20:13] Lord help me oh Lord help me praise the
[1:20:16] Lord you will understand it there that's
[1:20:18] that is the reason why uh uh uh churches
[1:20:22] has been run like a casino Center
[1:20:26] people go in and they think that if they
[1:20:28] cash in a lot of Praise or they cash in
[1:20:31] a lot of shouting they can cash our
[1:20:34] blessing
[1:20:35] they don't work out like that the church
[1:20:37] is not a casino
[1:20:41] are we together
[1:20:44] now second Corinthians chapter 2 chapter
[1:20:47] 6 verse 2 listening to this the Bible
[1:20:49] says uh verse 2 for he said I have heard
[1:20:54] thee in the in a Time acceptable
[1:20:58] and in the day of salvation
[1:21:02] have have a circled thee behold now is
[1:21:08] the acceptable time behold now is the
[1:21:12] day of salvation what do you hear when
[1:21:15] you hear now is the day of salvation it
[1:21:18] sounds as the same as is the day of
[1:21:20] visitation
[1:21:24] praise the Lord so the day that God
[1:21:27] saved you he visited you
[1:21:32] praise the Lord it was a day of
[1:21:34] visitation
[1:21:38] he came down to visit you
[1:21:44] praise the Lord
[1:21:46] he knocked at your door
[1:21:48] and you open the door
[1:21:51] praise the Lord
[1:21:52] and he came in
[1:21:55] and you welcome him
[1:21:57] praise the Lord
[1:22:00] so that's the same year where the Sami
[1:22:03] is saying yeah he says oh visit me
[1:22:08] oh visit me with that salvation
[1:22:13] the day of salvation is your day of
[1:22:15] visitation
[1:22:18] praise the Lord
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:23] and when you take this over to the bulk
[1:22:26] of Sons of Solomon sons of Solomon in
[1:22:29] chapter 5 he he described a visitation
[1:22:32] of the bridegroom
[1:22:34] when he came and he was knocking the
[1:22:36] door the bride got so busy
[1:22:40] she was looking at all the gifts that he
[1:22:43] had given her
[1:22:45] and she didn't open the door and he went
[1:22:47] she had to go outside in the dark and
[1:22:50] start looking for him
[1:22:52] that's why some people never get settled
[1:22:55] they never get settled
[1:22:59] they never get settled they want to move
[1:23:01] to this church when they get there they
[1:23:03] want this other Pastor they want they
[1:23:05] never get settled
[1:23:11] because why you are mad you are not
[1:23:14] entertaining this visitation
[1:23:19] you are not recognizing your day of
[1:23:21] visitation
[1:23:22] you are just rejoicing in the in the in
[1:23:26] the moon in the movement and and you
[1:23:28] know and the emotion that is taking
[1:23:29] place oh praise God that was a beautiful
[1:23:31] old man we enjoyed that you didn't see
[1:23:34] the visitation
[1:23:38] what is man
[1:23:42] that you are mindful of
[1:23:45] and that you visit him
[1:23:47] are we together
[1:23:50] Let's uh let's let's take few here
[1:23:53] uh
[1:23:54] look at this also Genesis 21
[1:23:58] Genesis 21
[1:24:00] Genesis 21.
[1:24:03] brother Brown would take this he would
[1:24:05] take this here in a message is there
[1:24:07] anything too high for the Lord why
[1:24:09] Abraham he would take this he says why
[1:24:12] Abraham
[1:24:13] uh went to meet them he turned them
[1:24:16] aside and said come in and sit down
[1:24:18] talking to those angels that came to
[1:24:20] visit Sid honor the the little the the
[1:24:23] sit
[1:24:25] under the ox a little wide and let me
[1:24:29] fetch a little water and you wash your
[1:24:31] feet and I will give you mussels of
[1:24:33] bread and just rest a little while then
[1:24:36] you you may go on your way oh when he
[1:24:40] sat him down there
[1:24:44] though they didn't look any different
[1:24:47] from any other man because they were
[1:24:51] dressed dust on their clothes and come
[1:24:55] from some other country probably their
[1:24:58] feet Dusty and their clothes wrecked but
[1:25:01] Abraham knew inside there there was
[1:25:04] something real
[1:25:06] as Spirit declare a why he kept himself
[1:25:10] in a spiritual atmosphere all the time
[1:25:13] that he could recognize right from wrong
[1:25:17] all the time that's the way the church
[1:25:22] the Christian ought to do today is keep
[1:25:25] yourself prayed up on a spiritual
[1:25:28] atmosphere
[1:25:30] never seen by side look to the good side
[1:25:34] you are you are children of God
[1:25:36] expecting his Blessing
[1:25:41] after he stopped them I can see him run
[1:25:44] run in and grab Sarah by the hand and
[1:25:47] said come inside darling just a moment I
[1:25:50] want to tell you something I believe I
[1:25:52] believe we are getting our day of
[1:25:56] visitation right now what the Bible says
[1:25:59] he entertained him
[1:26:02] praise the Lord he wanted to keep that
[1:26:05] presence
[1:26:09] he wanted to keep their presence
[1:26:14] sometimes we be we we behave as if that
[1:26:18] this virtue are they are our personal
[1:26:21] property we went to buy them you see
[1:26:24] people boasting in prayer life Boston in
[1:26:27] the in the world I mean the Lord had
[1:26:28] raised my Revelation and and all of that
[1:26:31] it is not yours God is just visiting you
[1:26:36] he's just visiting you
[1:26:38] and your attitude matters
[1:26:42] when the Lord is dealing with your heart
[1:26:44] and he's giving you Grace where he's
[1:26:46] drawing you inside you can spend some
[1:26:48] time with him entertain that
[1:26:51] acknowledge that he's the one doing it
[1:26:53] don't make it or seem like Lord I'm
[1:26:55] giving myself to you Lord I'm I'm
[1:26:57] surrounding myself you have nothing to
[1:27:00] do with it
[1:27:08] praise the Lord
[1:27:11] remember when brother Branham refused to
[1:27:14] go to the Pentecostal people
[1:27:16] in the early part of his ministry he
[1:27:19] said he went six months with no
[1:27:21] visitation
[1:27:23] of the Lord no vision
[1:27:28] he was just preaching like every
[1:27:29] preacher and I mean he was going to
[1:27:32] church but I mean when you are having a
[1:27:35] moment people that have spent time with
[1:27:37] God you have been in the present with
[1:27:39] God you have gone in the chamber before
[1:27:41] when you are having a visitation you
[1:27:44] know it you know it
[1:27:47] is different
[1:27:49] it's not an ordinary life it's different
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] it's not something that you are making
[1:27:54] up and you want for people to notice
[1:28:05] praise the Lord I believe we are getting
[1:28:07] our day of visitation right now out
[1:28:10] through
[1:28:12] the herb he went he got a little card he
[1:28:14] dressed it and he brought it out and he
[1:28:16] fed them and that that was what the
[1:28:18] Apostle referred to when he said
[1:28:20] entertain strangers you might be
[1:28:22] entertaining angels that was the
[1:28:24] scripture he was referring for but let's
[1:28:26] look at Genesis chapter 21
[1:28:30] verse 1 Genesis 21 verse 1.
[1:28:34] I'm trying to go here I'm doing well is
[1:28:37] uh
[1:28:38] uh 12. 33 amen
[1:28:43] 12 33.
[1:28:46] when do you want me to stop just let me
[1:28:48] know
[1:28:50] praise the Lord
[1:28:57] if you see right now and I would say
[1:28:58] just walk out
[1:29:05] but also I pray now not a whole year
[1:29:08] long I've been I've been trying to train
[1:29:09] myself and I'm not I'm not becoming
[1:29:12] successful so just pray for me Genesis
[1:29:14] chapter 21 verse 1 listen to this listen
[1:29:17] to this listen to this very carefully
[1:29:19] because it's not the same
[1:29:22] it is not the same and the law visited
[1:29:25] Sarah
[1:29:27] as he have said
[1:29:29] and the Lord did unto Sarah
[1:29:32] as he has spoken
[1:29:34] it's not the same
[1:29:39] it's not the same
[1:29:44] two things took place what was the two
[1:29:47] things the changing of the body and the
[1:29:50] promised son
[1:29:56] the changing of the body
[1:29:59] was her personal visitation
[1:30:03] the Lord visited Sarah
[1:30:09] are we together
[1:30:10] the law of visitor how she was an adult
[1:30:13] woman 90 something years old and Yara
[1:30:15] said she's bouncing all like a young
[1:30:17] girl
[1:30:19] praise the Lord
[1:30:22] putting up some move that even a bit
[1:30:24] like can loss after her
[1:30:27] praise the Lord lost him after his
[1:30:30] grandmother
[1:30:31] the Lord visited Sarah
[1:30:34] as he have said our countdown
[1:30:39] I will come down it was God himself
[1:30:44] changing the body
[1:30:50] he visited a serum and the Lord did unto
[1:30:53] Sarah as he have spoken
[1:30:56] two different things two things took
[1:30:58] place
[1:31:00] the changing of the body
[1:31:02] and she receiving the promised seed
[1:31:05] two different things
[1:31:10] are we together what is man
[1:31:13] what is man that you are mindful of him
[1:31:18] and the son of man that you visited him
[1:31:24] praise the Lord
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:28] God's mind what is in his mind is is how
[1:31:33] how he can how he can come close how how
[1:31:36] he can visit us
[1:31:39] and we know our visitation in this in
[1:31:41] this uh in this age is a changing of the
[1:31:44] body just like Sarah
[1:31:46] true
[1:31:48] we have we have promised that we will
[1:31:50] receive above the change
[1:31:54] are we together
[1:31:57] and we will receive the promised son
[1:31:58] which will be Christ in Bride form
[1:32:05] we will experience the very same thing
[1:32:07] here Genesis 21 1 we go into experience
[1:32:10] that we will have a bothered change we
[1:32:13] will have a nature change there is a
[1:32:15] token life that was struck in and it
[1:32:18] would be Christ having the preeminence
[1:32:20] in our church Christ having the
[1:32:22] preeminence in our home Christ having
[1:32:24] the preeminence in our life
[1:32:30] we will not be driven by Ambitions
[1:32:33] listening to our part of prison of
[1:32:35] listening carefully as we play that tip
[1:32:37] you see how brother Branham is teaching
[1:32:39] on that we will now be driving by
[1:32:41] Ambitions and driven by career and
[1:32:43] driven by finances and driven by the uh
[1:32:46] uh uh uh
[1:32:48] uh political opinions
[1:32:50] it will be Christ
[1:32:52] in you the hope of glory
[1:32:56] are we together
[1:32:57] two different things
[1:33:00] he visits here
[1:33:02] and he did unto Sarah
[1:33:04] two different things
[1:33:06] they are not the same
[1:33:09] yeah give me some few minutes here
[1:33:11] I just want to
[1:33:13] for us to be able to cap this Exodus
[1:33:15] chapter four
[1:33:18] I said a chapter four I have a few
[1:33:20] quotes behind all of these but I'll try
[1:33:22] to to spare you if I can paraphrase them
[1:33:25] I would do Etc 4 verse 31 and the people
[1:33:29] believe
[1:33:31] praise the Lord when they heard that the
[1:33:34] Lord have visited the children of Israel
[1:33:36] how did he did how did he visited them
[1:33:39] how we come down
[1:33:42] that's what he said to Moses I will come
[1:33:45] down
[1:33:51] I will come down
[1:33:52] so it was a visitation
[1:33:57] it was a visitation
[1:34:00] whenever God comes down it's a
[1:34:02] visitation when the Lord comes down in
[1:34:05] your health it's a visitation
[1:34:08] amen when he comes down you are dealing
[1:34:11] with a situation and God comes down
[1:34:16] and give you a word
[1:34:21] don't fuss with it all you are doing you
[1:34:23] just driving him out
[1:34:25] that's all you're doing
[1:34:27] you're just driving him out
[1:34:31] why because you have your mind so set
[1:34:35] praise the Lord
[1:34:37] if he does not meet what is in your mind
[1:34:39] or you don't want it
[1:34:47] are we together
[1:34:49] amen
[1:34:53] see the visitation of entity mama
[1:34:56] God visited her now with her favorite
[1:34:58] pastor
[1:35:02] amen she asked God for an Elijah God
[1:35:06] never sinned I mean they are they are
[1:35:08] God never send her favorite pastor
[1:35:19] even in such a time like that
[1:35:26] yeah
[1:35:27] and she never she never she never even
[1:35:30] asked a guessing question are you a
[1:35:32] preacher
[1:35:34] why because he's a white man are you a
[1:35:36] preacher why are you doing in this
[1:35:37] community in the first place
[1:35:40] no she was on an expectation
[1:35:44] she said person it was brother Brandon
[1:35:47] that was surprised
[1:35:49] brother Brandon was the one that was
[1:35:50] caught off guard
[1:35:52] because he was just going and he didn't
[1:35:54] know where he was going when the woman
[1:35:55] said passion he looked behind him who
[1:35:57] was she talking to
[1:35:59] how did you know I'm a person
[1:36:01] she said I've just been reading
[1:36:04] I just been looking in the word
[1:36:07] I found a place that identified my
[1:36:10] condition I'm a woman just like that
[1:36:13] that that woman I have a son
[1:36:17] her son was there mine is dying the only
[1:36:20] thing that is missing is an Elijah
[1:36:27] are we together
[1:36:30] God visited the children of Israel you
[1:36:33] look over in sin Luke chapter one
[1:36:36] Simon did uh uh uh dedicating Jesus
[1:36:40] bless the Lord of Israel for he have
[1:36:43] visited and redeemed his people
[1:36:49] so I'm only reading visitation on one
[1:36:52] side because when we read visitation It
[1:36:55] was friendly or hostile
[1:36:57] the Hostile part is judgment
[1:37:00] I don't think we want it
[1:37:02] amen I don't think we want it because
[1:37:05] God is about visiting the Nations
[1:37:12] God is about visiting the Nations
[1:37:15] praise the Lord
[1:37:19] it is just it is just things for for for
[1:37:21] for we the illest to wake up to that and
[1:37:25] realize that our God is on the move
[1:37:29] praise the Lord
[1:37:39] we just we just we just need we just
[1:37:42] need the Lord amen
[1:37:43] we just need the Lord
[1:37:45] uh
[1:37:47] both are the the the
[1:37:49] [Music]
[1:37:52] the wheat basket of the word
[1:37:55] uh Ukraine and Russia
[1:37:57] with everything that is going on now is
[1:38:00] is going to tell on the prices of food
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:08] and that is beginning to shake all the
[1:38:10] nations
[1:38:14] because there is there is there is uh a
[1:38:16] lot of involvement is is dropping on uh
[1:38:19] on on on Africa as much as it is
[1:38:22] dropping on Europe
[1:38:29] are we together
[1:38:39] now in Luke chapter 19 this is one of
[1:38:42] the the famous one that we know Luke
[1:38:44] chapter 19 Jesus was speaking to Israel
[1:38:47] speaking to Jerusalem
[1:38:50] amen Luke chapter 19.
[1:38:56] let me let me take it from somewhere I'm
[1:38:58] I'm closing up right here
[1:39:00] I just wanted for you uh I hope that you
[1:39:03] you were able to
[1:39:05] to see what we are talking about amen
[1:39:10] I hope that you were able to grab it
[1:39:14] Jesus here talking to to Israel
[1:39:18] 43 he says
[1:39:20] 1943 Luke 19 43 for the day shall come
[1:39:24] upon thee they have an enemy shaka's
[1:39:28] attention about thee and compass
[1:39:31] uh uh the round and keep the
[1:39:36] in on every side
[1:39:38] so this was a visitation when Titus
[1:39:41] surrounded the city
[1:39:43] for the fall and Chalet the evening wave
[1:39:48] the ground and that children with indeed
[1:39:51] and they shall not leave
[1:39:53] in the one stone upon another because
[1:39:56] they are nowhere not the time of that
[1:40:00] visitation
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:03] so you see when the friendly visitation
[1:40:05] is refused then the Hostile visitation
[1:40:09] comes
[1:40:10] when you refuse God friendly visitation
[1:40:13] then he brings the visitation of
[1:40:15] Correction
[1:40:19] are we together
[1:40:21] yeah
[1:40:24] so what what actually that I want us to
[1:40:27] to see to be able to cap this is that uh
[1:40:31] when God brings his word even when you
[1:40:33] look at the son of man Ministry you know
[1:40:36] we can go right into that the son of man
[1:40:38] Ministry is a visitation
[1:40:41] God visiting visiting a generation with
[1:40:45] a Ministry
[1:40:48] amen with a Ministry manifesting the
[1:40:52] same work that he did to the Jews the
[1:40:55] same work that he did to the Samaritans
[1:40:58] he's bringing that same thing to us the
[1:41:00] Gentile it's a visitation
[1:41:03] amen it's not it's not something for a
[1:41:06] copycat you will never have another one
[1:41:11] praise the Lord
[1:41:14] you won't have another one
[1:41:16] you know it's a visitation so that's
[1:41:18] that's what I want us to be able to
[1:41:20] understand that's what I want us to see
[1:41:22] is that uh you know like like brother
[1:41:25] Branham said you know if if uh you know
[1:41:27] a God can visit us in different ways you
[1:41:31] know in in different ways
[1:41:34] praise the Lord
[1:41:36] what is man that you are mindful of him
[1:41:42] and the son of man that you visited him
[1:41:45] visited him
[1:41:47] God visit us in different ways
[1:41:51] praise the Lord
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:55] like the Bible says uh you know after
[1:41:57] salvation the good and that's good thing
[1:41:59] that God gave to man
[1:42:00] is a woman
[1:42:02] it's a visitation when God gave you a
[1:42:06] good Godly wife
[1:42:09] praise the Lord
[1:42:12] because when things are approached by
[1:42:15] the word then you can now be able to to
[1:42:18] rightly function as a man
[1:42:23] in the same place also when God gave a
[1:42:26] woman a Godly husband
[1:42:29] praise the Lord
[1:42:31] it's a visitation
[1:42:39] praise the Lord
[1:42:43] when God gave us uh you know men that
[1:42:46] would be able to bring the word
[1:42:51] not in a legalistic way
[1:42:56] but in a way where we can be able to see
[1:42:59] ourselves like that little boy looking
[1:43:01] at himself in the mirror and say that's
[1:43:03] me
[1:43:08] that's a visitation
[1:43:12] you see as a church that's the reason
[1:43:14] why you know why uh uh we we we
[1:43:18] entertain Ministries to come you know to
[1:43:21] to be able to speak we want to be right
[1:43:23] there on the word
[1:43:24] praise the Lord if anybody comes
[1:43:26] speaking their own thoughts something
[1:43:28] that is not a calling to the word if we
[1:43:30] can't get them behind the pulpit because
[1:43:32] we don't want to destroy their influence
[1:43:34] before the people who set them down and
[1:43:36] say look this is not the word I don't
[1:43:38] see it like this
[1:43:41] sometimes we don't do it before the
[1:43:43] people because we don't want to destroy
[1:43:45] that person influence
[1:43:48] unless the person is stubborn then we
[1:43:50] will bring you right before the
[1:43:52] congregation and we'll treat you
[1:43:53] according to what the scripture says
[1:43:59] because the purpose is to lead us back
[1:44:02] to the word
[1:44:06] that's that's all we want to achieve
[1:44:11] that is the thing that has the absolute
[1:44:13] year that's the thing that has the
[1:44:16] absolute that's why we come here for
[1:44:20] amen
[1:44:23] if it is just a concept then we would
[1:44:25] just sing all through the service why
[1:44:26] can't we have singing service
[1:44:30] because singing is not the absolute
[1:44:37] right all of those things are just to
[1:44:39] create an atmosphere so the world can
[1:44:41] come
[1:44:45] that's why we want the right kind of for
[1:44:47] music if God can help us with it the
[1:44:49] right kind of for songs if God can help
[1:44:52] us with it amen not just pulling
[1:44:54] everything from from the internet that
[1:44:56] moves the body
[1:44:58] we want to sing songs that can that can
[1:45:01] that we can be able to catch a promise
[1:45:03] in a song the word is working mightily I
[1:45:06] mean I mean that was my team son the
[1:45:07] entire week
[1:45:14] because it's the word is the word people
[1:45:16] that realize that it's the word it's not
[1:45:19] our ideas it's not our feelings it's the
[1:45:23] word
[1:45:26] if we don't narrow it down to the word
[1:45:28] we I mean we will just miss the Mac
[1:45:31] that's what sin is to miss the mark
[1:45:39] that's what unbelief is to miss the Mac
[1:45:45] are we together
[1:45:48] am I am I am I honest too yeah but Peter
[1:45:52] said this First Peter chapter 2 verse 12
[1:45:54] he says having your conversation Earnest
[1:45:57] which means having an Earnest Behavior
[1:46:00] among the Gentiles among the unbelievers
[1:46:03] that whereas they speak evil they speak
[1:46:07] against you as an evil Doer
[1:46:11] that they
[1:46:12] are they made by your good works
[1:46:17] which they Shall Behold glorify God
[1:46:21] in the day of visitation
[1:46:24] praise the Lord
[1:46:26] so you see that's how the sins will
[1:46:28] judge the word it is not that we will
[1:46:31] just sit down there and say yeah you
[1:46:32] come here you are not good to me no
[1:46:35] God is going to use the earnest life you
[1:46:38] live
[1:46:40] right in the community
[1:46:41] and then when he brings them up it's
[1:46:44] just going to flash to their mind
[1:46:46] you have no excuse if a young woman was
[1:46:49] living pure to the world why were you
[1:46:51] running around and and living filthy
[1:46:53] right
[1:46:59] right so Paul says I mean Peter is
[1:47:01] saying in a day of visitation which of
[1:47:04] course this can be in the time of
[1:47:05] judgment
[1:47:06] God is going to use your testimony
[1:47:10] your earnest testimony your earners
[1:47:12] Behavior
[1:47:19] praise the Lord
[1:47:22] amen
[1:47:28] they asked Jesus they say sir we shall
[1:47:31] we shall the Commandment is the greatest
[1:47:33] say oh Israel love the Lord your God
[1:47:36] with all of your heart your mind your
[1:47:37] strength
[1:47:40] Israel God is one Lord loving with all
[1:47:42] of your heart that's the first
[1:47:43] commandment the second commandment love
[1:47:45] your neighbor as yourself
[1:47:49] foreign
[1:47:51] there's a big thing in there because
[1:47:53] Jesus was talking about the Samaritans
[1:47:57] when he when he went into death so to
[1:48:00] the Jews and the Pharisees that was
[1:48:02] around it was abominable
[1:48:04] but the mystery that is in there that it
[1:48:06] did not realize is that Jesus was trying
[1:48:09] to tell them that uh uh God has come to
[1:48:13] dwell with us as our neighbor
[1:48:16] why because it was God in flesh
[1:48:22] amen God had took on 16 elements
[1:48:29] and he come to the Earth among them just
[1:48:33] like a human
[1:48:36] praise the Lord so you see the thing
[1:48:38] about it there is the other you know uh
[1:48:41] it is it is not it is not uh uh uh uh
[1:48:45] you know it's it's more about how we
[1:48:48] treat
[1:48:49] the ones that are close to us
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:55] how we treat the ones that are close to
[1:48:57] us so we're talking about this
[1:48:58] visitation
[1:49:00] the gifts in the church is God's
[1:49:02] visiting his people
[1:49:05] when God blessed one with with with a
[1:49:07] singing gift for God bless one with uh
[1:49:10] it is it is a way for God to visit his
[1:49:13] people
[1:49:18] are we together
[1:49:20] amen he says I will visit the Gentiles
[1:49:23] uh the people that sat in in darkness
[1:49:25] great light will shine and what did he
[1:49:27] choose he choose better man say a crook
[1:49:30] uh knows Jews Paul to fulfill that
[1:49:33] prophecy and make him an apostle
[1:49:37] to the Gentiles that was God's
[1:49:39] visitation
[1:49:40] in as much as Paul had a desire Paul was
[1:49:43] burning in his heart to bring this
[1:49:46] Revelation to his people
[1:49:48] but they rejected him why because they
[1:49:50] were blinded
[1:49:52] because it was time for great light to
[1:49:54] shine on us
[1:49:56] it was God visiting us people
[1:50:00] amen
[1:50:01] is what God's visiting us you think
[1:50:04] about it think about it I'm I'm close in
[1:50:07] here there's there's one uh quota left
[1:50:09] up here and then brother bam says this
[1:50:11] let me let me close up with this he said
[1:50:13] Ephesians Church age he said and the
[1:50:16] church corporate has never learned this
[1:50:20] lesson listen to this the church
[1:50:22] corporate the church word has never
[1:50:24] learned this lesson and it always says
[1:50:27] that if you don't learn from history you
[1:50:30] are bound to repeat it
[1:50:36] amen the church corporate has never
[1:50:39] learned this lesson from the from the
[1:50:41] scripture not from history every time
[1:50:44] God gave a visitation of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:47] and the people gets free
[1:50:50] every time God's free the people
[1:50:53] after the why they bound themselves
[1:50:56] right back
[1:50:57] to the very thing
[1:51:01] they came out off
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:07] every time why because
[1:51:09] we we we take it as our Personal
[1:51:13] Achievement
[1:51:16] we take it as our Personal Achievement
[1:51:19] we start to condemn others
[1:51:21] we think that we are more spiritual now
[1:51:23] God have to speak to me
[1:51:26] yeah I hear what you say but let me pray
[1:51:28] about it let God speak to me first
[1:51:31] and then pretty soon you are just going
[1:51:33] around the circle to come right back to
[1:51:35] the same place you were
[1:51:43] is this every time God gave a gave a
[1:51:47] visitation of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:51:48] people gets free that's that's why Paul
[1:51:51] was crying to the church in galatia who
[1:51:54] have been with you
[1:51:55] for you to be bounding yourself to the
[1:51:58] same thing that God brought you out of
[1:52:02] praise the Lord
[1:52:07] always always say it's not bad it's not
[1:52:10] bad
[1:52:12] it's not bad we don't we don't want to
[1:52:13] be legalistic
[1:52:15] so now because we don't want to be
[1:52:17] legalistic
[1:52:19] then we we are running right back into
[1:52:21] the the hands to be bound by by sin amen
[1:52:25] Bound by the things we come out of you
[1:52:27] see every time God visit
[1:52:29] give the people the visitation of the
[1:52:31] Holy Ghost and and and and and and the
[1:52:33] Holy Ghost and the people gets free
[1:52:35] after the why they bound themselves
[1:52:37] right back to the very thing they come
[1:52:39] out of when when when Luther came out of
[1:52:42] of capitalism the people still free for
[1:52:45] the wine but when he died the people
[1:52:48] Simply Organized what they they thought
[1:52:52] they believe and and uh and set up their

[1:58:30] he don't want a seasonal visit

[1:59:24] the beginning that's why he made man
[1:59:26] so he can leave his self-existing State
[1:59:29] and come down and dwell with men that's
[1:59:32] why God became man
[1:59:35] because what is on his mind is to visit
[1:59:37] his people
[1:59:39] he told Israel I would make you a
[1:59:41] kingdom of priests
[1:59:43] I would dwell in your mess
