[1:15] a bird singing like their own Hearts
[1:18] research
[1:19] Joy because
[1:22] there is an Easter
[1:26] we believe that you raised up Jesus from
[1:29] the dead
[1:30] many years ago today and we celebrate
[1:34] this Memorial Day
[1:37] and let there come on Easter among us
[1:40] all today
[1:43] may we as disturbance
[1:46] understand his word that we were in his
[1:50] Fellowship then and that now that we are
[1:54] risen with him and setting together in
[1:57] Heavenly places
[1:59] bless the service
[2:01] here in the Tabernacle and across the
[2:04] lands where it goes by this telephone
[2:12] may it be an Easter for them also and an
[2:16] exodus
[2:17] from sickness onto strength
[2:23] and those who are dead in sin and
[2:26] trespassed may they live today through
[2:29] Christ
[2:31] and we'll praise thee for we asked it in
[2:33] his name amen
[2:41] I certainly deemed this a marvelous
[2:44] privilege this morning to be back here
[2:46] in Jeffersonville
[2:48] Indiana with
[2:50] this great congregation the church packs
[2:53] and standing in the round and outside
[2:55] and in the lots of every word to you
[2:58] people on the phones Across the Nation
[3:01] It's a beautiful morning here
[3:03] five o'clock this morning
[3:05] my little friend with a red breast blew
[3:09] up at the window and
[3:10] woke me up he's like his little heart
[3:12] would burst and he is risen
[3:19] I've always thought of this little bird
[3:21] being a friend to me because I like him
[3:25] the legend about him says the little
[3:27] brown bird saw him suffering on the
[3:30] cross for sin had placed him
[3:33] of course the little bird had noticing
[3:36] it has to die for the little bird
[3:39] but he flew into the cross and tried to
[3:42] pull the nails out a little bit
[3:45] they got his breath all red
[3:49] and that's the way I want mine too as
[3:53] this Shield
[3:54] of trying to protect
[3:56] the Glorious thing that he died for
[4:01] realizing that our time is limited here
[4:06] especially for those friends who are
[4:08] listening in by this telephone
[4:11] I would like to call your attention this
[4:14] morning to a
[4:17] a picture
[4:18] that some time ago
[4:21] was taken by
[4:23] the
[4:26] camera
[4:28] Vision that I had here at the Tabernacle
[4:30] of leaving Indiana to Arizona where I
[4:34] was to meet in a form of a pyramid
[4:37] seven angels
[4:39] not knowing what would happen
[4:42] later when I got there thinking it was
[4:44] the end of my life but no one could
[4:46] stand the blast and I'm sure all of you
[4:48] are acquainted with the story
[4:51] and
[4:52] then in sabinia Canyon one morning like
[4:56] this while in prayer there had been a
[4:58] sword placed in my hand and said this is
[5:03] and stored of the word later the Angels
[5:07] appeared as was prophesied and at the
[5:11] same time a great cluster of light left
[5:14] where I was standing and moved
[5:17] 30 miles high in the air
[5:20] and around the circle like the wings of
[5:22] the angels and drawed into the skies the
[5:25] shape of a pyramid in the same
[5:28] constellation of angels that appeared
[5:32] Scott stuck the picture all the way from
[5:35] Mexico as it moved from northern Arizona
[5:38] where the holy spirit said it would be
[5:40] standing 40 miles Northeast of Tucson
[5:43] and it went into the air and Life
[5:45] Magazine packed the pictures of Mystic
[5:48] something way in the Spheres where there
[5:51] can be no moisture where there can be no
[5:54] evaporations or anything 30 miles high
[5:57] and 27 miles across
[6:00] and coming right up from where those
[6:03] angels were now they asked to know
[6:06] science the or one of them is Tucson
[6:09] wanted to know any significance but I
[6:13] didn't tell them you all do it all
[6:14] beforehand but it wasn't for them
[6:21] and so there he spoke to me and said
[6:25] Seven Seals will be open the seven
[6:28] Mysteries Sevenfold mystery of the Bible
[6:31] is Saint Paul and closed up since the
[6:33] foundation of the world will be revealed
[6:35] and we yet humble little group compared
[6:38] with all the world we've enjoyed these
[6:41] blessings a hearing those Mysteries
[6:44] marriage divorced serpents seeds all
[6:47] these different questions has been
[6:49] completely
[6:51] revealed to us not by man but by God
[6:55] himself that's opened those seven
[6:57] mysteries of what the church was how it
[7:00] was in Christ at the beginning and how
[7:02] it would be revealed in the last day
[7:04] and now as this went up
[7:06] we have the picture outside on the on
[7:09] the plaque
[7:10] but then
[7:12] I have the picture League present here
[7:14] if you notice as Life Magazine had it
[7:18] but
[7:19] I wonder if my audience visible here as
[7:24] ever really looked at the picture
[7:28] and a way it should be
[7:30] you remember I was preaching when this
[7:33] Vision came
[7:35] upon the subject of the book of the
[7:38] revelations were the old judges
[7:41] where we see Jesus in Revelations 1 when
[7:44] we started to open Seven Seals of the or
[7:47] the church ages rather
[7:50] just prior to the opening of the seventh
[7:52] field Christ was standing with hair like
[7:55] wool White
[7:57] and I described that to you that the old
[8:01] English judges and judges of long ago
[8:03] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[8:06] in their supreme authority was given
[8:09] them they wore a white wig as it was
[8:12] over their heads to show their supreme
[8:14] authority
[8:16] well if you'll turn the picture like
[8:19] this and look you probably stiff in the
[8:21] audience
[8:22] it's Christ
[8:24] these eyes looking here just as perfect
[8:27] as it could be wearing the white wig a
[8:30] dream deity and judge of all heavens and
[8:34] earth
[8:35] can you see his eyes his nose his mouth
[8:38] just turn the picture from this way they
[8:40] had it this way the way
[8:43] can you see it
[8:46] his Supreme judges none other but him
[8:51] and that is a perfect identification
[8:54] again of vindication
[8:57] this message is the truth
[9:02] and making him not a third person but
[9:05] the only person
[9:07] maybe White so you can see the darkest
[9:10] faces near his eyes and notice he's
[9:12] looking from him comes this light
[9:15] shining on the right hand side to which
[9:18] he's looking to on the cross that's
[9:21] where he looked to the right
[9:23] where he pardoned The Sinner
[9:26] and the blight of his resurrection
[9:29] still go forth in his name
[9:35] I wish this morning that I had just much
[9:39] time to
[9:41] stand upon these phenomenas
[9:43] that's beyond any Shadow of Doubt it's
[9:46] been proven for the past 30 years or 35
[9:50] years right here at this church that's
[9:52] down on the River on that same light
[9:54] came down here in Jeffersonville in 1933
[9:57] and spoke those words
[10:00] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[10:03] the first coming of Christ your message
[10:05] before on the second
[10:07] we're at the end time and we see it we
[10:10] wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread
[10:12] over the Earth Maybe
[10:15] sometimes we'll have a chance to explain
[10:17] that if God willing now
[10:20] I want you to turn in in your Bible as
[10:23] we always believe that the word must
[10:26] come first of the reading of the word I
[10:29] always read that because if my words is
[10:32] the word of a man it will fail but the
[10:35] word of God can never fail now
[10:40] we're going to to read from the holy
[10:43] scriptures a text and we want you to
[10:46] turn first
[10:48] uh to uh
[10:51] three places in the Bible that I have
[10:54] chosen to read from one of them is
[10:58] in Revelation
[11:00] the first chapter
[11:03] and uh
[11:04] 17th and 18th verse
[11:08] this is where he appeared with his hair
[11:12] white as wool
[11:14] and his feet was like brass
[11:18] and then I want you also to get in your
[11:20] Bibles Romans 8 11.
[11:24] I've chosen this morning three places to
[11:27] read from the holy scriptures for my
[11:31] message today that the Lord is placed
[11:33] upon my heart for the resurrection
[11:36] and then I want you to also
[11:39] Mark 16 1 and 2. there I will draw my
[11:46] context
[11:49] now in Revelations 1 18 we read these
[11:53] words a 17 and 18.
[11:57] and when I saw him I fell at his feet as
[12:01] dead
[12:03] and he laid his right hand upon me
[12:06] saying unto me fear not
[12:09] for I am the first and the last
[12:13] I am he that liveth and more dead
[12:18] and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen
[12:22] and have the keys of death and Hell
[12:27] and in Romans the eighth chapter
[12:31] and the 11th verse we read this
[12:35] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[12:39] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[12:42] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[12:46] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[12:50] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[12:55] and now in Mark the 16th chapter
[12:59] the chapter of the Resurrection
[13:02] the 16th chapter the first and second
[13:05] verses
[13:09] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[13:13] maganese
[13:15] a mother and Mary the mother of James
[13:18] and salami
[13:20] has
[13:22] brought sweet spices that they might
[13:25] come and anoint him and very early in
[13:28] the morning the first day of the week
[13:32] they came unto the suppleter at the
[13:35] rising of the Sun
[13:38] now my text this morning I want to take
[13:43] for a text
[13:45] it is the rising of the Sun
[13:50] and for a subject I want to use
[13:54] the quickening power
[13:58] now
[14:01] you know you perhaps have been hearing
[14:03] the radio
[14:05] and the different ministers speak in our
[14:09] Noble brother Neville this morning
[14:11] speaking his
[14:13] Easter subject
[14:15] uh on the resurrection
[14:18] and
[14:20] I thought maybe I would take it a little
[14:24] different path
[14:26] not to be different but just to add a
[14:29] little more
[14:30] maybe in another angle
[14:33] or use the scriptures every angle you go
[14:37] with the Scriptures it always declares
[14:40] Jesus Christ
[14:43] you cannot get away from it any way it
[14:46] always declares
[14:48] now as the world
[14:51] today in a
[14:53] memorial service
[14:56] or at least in the United States and
[14:58] this side of the Earth this morning
[15:00] and the churches and throughout uh
[15:03] celebrating
[15:04] a memorial of of the greatest Triumph
[15:09] that man ever has
[15:12] I think as
[15:14] savior when he died
[15:17] or as an infant when he was born he
[15:20] could not
[15:21] being here less being coming into the
[15:24] Earth and when he died shortly he atoned
[15:28] for our sins
[15:30] but yet there's been many
[15:33] fine little babies born
[15:36] and there's been many men who have
[15:39] suffered and died for a real cause
[15:43] but there never was one
[15:46] that could raise yourself up again
[15:49] until this day
[15:51] now that it is the greatest
[15:54] week in history
[15:56] the greatest celebration of all times
[16:00] this Easter is where he proved
[16:04] what he had said
[16:06] man can say things
[16:08] but yet it isn't exactly can be believed
[16:13] upon thoroughly until it's been proved
[16:16] to be the truth
[16:18] and as God who said prove all things
[16:21] hold fast to that which is good he would
[16:25] not tell you to do something that he
[16:28] would not do himself
[16:30] so he proved
[16:32] who this was
[16:35] that died for our sins
[16:39] and now not only is it a Memorial Day
[16:44] of all these great Easter flowers Easter
[16:48] bonnets and the pink rabbits and so
[16:51] forth that we've got into
[16:54] and holy celebrations
[16:56] which is all right
[16:58] but this is not the real thing
[17:02] and that way
[17:05] as people today are trying to say we
[17:08] should worst beat once a year on on uh
[17:14] Thursday
[17:16] now on Friday we should take the
[17:18] communion and all different doctrines
[17:21] and they argue about where they should
[17:23] be this day or that day or what should
[17:25] be established they are the first day of
[17:27] the week or all these things are just
[17:31] merely traditions
[17:34] what good would any of it do you where
[17:37] you had lit or not lit
[17:40] if there's no life in you
[17:43] it's only a memorial which is nothing
[17:47] against it but they have
[17:49] certainly carried out their Traditions
[17:52] but left off the main thing
[17:55] Satan doesn't care harm religious you
[17:58] are a how right you are in your Doctrine
[18:01] if you miss that line yours won't come
[18:06] up anyhow
[18:08] no matter how religious how good how
[18:11] many churches you belong to or will
[18:13] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[18:17] unless you have been born again
[18:20] therefore if God raised up Jesus from
[18:24] the dead did he raise him up for a
[18:28] memorial and is this Resurrection
[18:30] morning only uh one day in the year or a
[18:35] certain day that we celebrate this are
[18:38] are we benefactors of his resurrection
[18:43] what does it mean to me
[18:46] what does it mean to you not we believe
[18:49] by faith that he raised from the dead
[18:53] but what has that got to do with me
[18:56] that was 2 000 years ago
[19:00] now to find this text
[19:02] as I
[19:04] was tired
[19:06] my arm hurting me from shots
[19:10] that the nurse gave me for leave
[19:13] overseas now as you know in a few days
[19:17] and I'm but have these shots not enough
[19:21] and with calorie yellow fever and
[19:24] everything I was pretty weary making me
[19:27] sick which seizure requires to have
[19:30] these shots before you go into the other
[19:32] nations
[19:34] and he said give Caesar that which is
[19:37] Caesar
[19:38] but then give God that which is God
[19:42] and as I was sitting there wondering
[19:45] what would I speak to this waiting
[19:48] audience this morning
[19:49] which I'm very thankful for
[19:52] and man and women who would lay their
[19:55] life on the line for what you would say
[19:59] how should I do it what should I take
[20:02] for a text
[20:05] and then while I was sitting there
[20:07] almost asleep
[20:09] my door rattled
[20:12] out on the front side of the house
[20:14] nobody being there but myself
[20:17] as far as I knew I listened I didn't get
[20:21] it just right
[20:22] after a while
[20:24] the den room door where I have turned
[20:27] into my study
[20:28] it rattled
[20:30] and someone kept shaking the door and I
[20:33] I went to the door and opened the door
[20:37] and to my surprise
[20:40] a pretty little
[20:42] yellow-haired blue-eyed girl standera
[20:46] looked like a little Easter flower a
[20:49] steady here looking at me now
[20:52] she handed me a card
[20:56] and it was the uh
[20:58] uh of course I guess when I get home
[21:00] there'll be Easter cards and so forth
[21:02] but the only one being leaving home that
[21:04] I'd received
[21:07] and
[21:09] she said
[21:10] brother Branham
[21:12] this is from Daddy and me
[21:16] sure be sure that me was in it
[21:19] and or arthritic father
[21:23] sitting in a wheelchair
[21:25] had sent this card
[21:29] when I took it and thanked the little
[21:33] darling as she turned
[21:36] and walked away from the door
[21:39] I opened up the card
[21:42] and in the form of this car I drew my
[21:47] text
[21:48] for on the card
[21:50] was the Saint
[21:52] March 16 1 and 2.
[21:56] shut up the sun was Rising
[21:59] and then I thought of that and then the
[22:03] subject of the quickening of Jesus
[22:07] Christ to be raised up from the data
[22:10] through my subject
[22:13] now
[22:15] the Sun
[22:17] at the rising of the Sun
[22:21] well
[22:22] there was a time when the world was
[22:25] laying in utter Darkness
[22:28] it was without form
[22:30] and was born
[22:32] and it was all covered with water
[22:37] and was laying there in the dark dismal
[22:43] gloomy atmosphere
[22:46] and the spirit of God moved up on that
[22:49] water and said let there be light
[22:55] God had a reason to do that
[22:58] for down beneath that water
[23:02] there were seeds that he had planted
[23:06] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[23:10] it live
[23:12] and the first light was ever given in
[23:15] the Earth was God's spoken word
[23:20] first life that ever struck the Earth
[23:22] was God's spoken word he said let's bear
[23:26] be life
[23:28] and there was like that turned Darkness
[23:31] into light in order to bring forth a
[23:35] creation
[23:36] of joy life upon the Earth
[23:42] then the spirit of God as it moved with
[23:44] love and compassion and that great day
[23:47] the first day of the dawn of creation
[23:50] upon the Earth
[23:52] the sun rose and swept across its raised
[23:57] and dried up the waters from the earth
[23:59] and made an atmosphere above
[24:03] and for its first time it was to bring
[24:06] joy and life to the Earth by a seed that
[24:10] was a great hour
[24:13] but oh it wasn't nothing that Sunrise
[24:16] like the sunrise on that Easter morning
[24:20] this time
[24:22] with the sun leading into the sky
[24:25] it brought forth a greater Sunrise than
[24:29] ever because it came greater news with
[24:33] this thunder rise
[24:35] than it did with the sunrise at the
[24:38] beginning
[24:39] this Sunrise brought a news
[24:42] that he is risen
[24:47] he is quickened from the dead as he's
[24:50] promised he's risen from the dead
[24:56] the first time the sun rose in Genesis
[25:00] it was bringing a message that there
[25:02] will be life upon the Earth more to life
[25:05] but this time when the sun rose
[25:08] that was a a dual sun rising another sun
[25:14] rising it was a not only if you in
[25:17] Rising it was a s o n had risen
[25:22] to bring eternal life to All God's
[25:26] promise seeds
[25:28] that by foreknowledge his seen laying
[25:31] upon the Earth
[25:33] no more could the the botany life live
[25:37] back there at the beginning without the
[25:39] s-u-n to bring it to life no more than
[25:43] the day when sons of God is up on the
[25:47] earth it takes a s o n light to bring
[25:50] them to eternal life
[25:52] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[25:56] foundation of the world he had chosen
[25:58] them in himself before the foundation of
[26:01] the world on Easter morning
[26:04] then in this dirt somewhere
[26:07] laid our bodies at that time
[26:11] for we are the dust of the Earth
[26:14] and In Heaven There was a book of memory
[26:18] and his attributes was in him knowing
[26:21] that they're called this son of God
[26:24] raised it would also raise the life
[26:27] every son that was for our days to this
[26:30] great time
[26:32] he knew it would be and what a more
[26:35] glorious Sunrise that was than it was at
[26:39] the beginning at times when it first
[26:41] gone
[26:43] now this great breaking of the Easter
[26:47] seal
[26:48] now
