========================================

understanding what time of day is it what about the scripture for this day the conditions of the church are the conditions of the church today in the world politics our world system is just as rot as it can be I'm not a politician I'm a Christian but I got no business taught by politics but I just want to say they're rotten on both sides I voted once that was for Christ I got to win the devil booted against me Christ voted for me depends on which way I cast my vote I'm glad I cast it on him let the world see what they want to I still believe that he's the same yesterday the day and forever he'll prove it certainly will certainly the increase in crime juvenile delinquency look at our nation what's the power of the earth our great democracy was born back then and the Declaration of Independence and decoration made a bit of society we had a democracy that our great forefathers are the things that they've done we had a great nation but she is an old rotten egg from me and shaking and giving away you're trying to tax people money to stand around to buy friendship with their enemies they're throwing it back in her face One World War II world wars still moving on to the third one certainly politics is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom just just like what Matthew 24 said it would be they should be against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom all these things would take place let's consider this now all right notice another the increase in scientific research now at one time Mr my grandfather went to see my grandmother in an ox cart now it's a jet or even a orbit into the Earth in the outer space great who said this Daniel 12 4 said knowledge shall increase in the last days we see the hour We're living notice uh the the conditions of the world the condition of Science and notice again today in our educational system I don't try to now this I've got the newspaper clippings teaching sex in our church in our schools of young students that have one others see if they can mate in the world yes sir how about our priesthood tonight I got a piece out of paper over in Los Angeles California over a bunch of clergymen Baptist Baptist Presbyterians ministers brought a bonus to homosexuals and in practice homosexual Sanders trying to win them to God when that's why the curses of the hour a sodomite and the law even arrested him that where we at our whole system is rottened up and unders I've seen the increase of homosexual across the United States has increased 20 or 30 percent were last year think of that man living with man just exactly like they did in Sodom increase in crime juvenile delinquency what art are we living this day this word of Prophecy is fulfilled the religious world the church itself the church the call-out church that we call to call our church the last Church AIDS the Pentecostal Church where is it it's in laosiah as the scripture said they they let down the bars their women are half just their manner it's a horrible thing some of them married three or four times on Deacon boards and everything else they fled down and brought in corruption because they set a castles and took the place with the world and today they got better feelings they ever had some place one of them's building a 50 million dollar Auditorium 50 million dollar Pentecostals it used to be down on the corner 25 years ago beating a tambourine said we because the scripture said in Revelation 3 that you are rich said I'm rich I said as a queen I have needed nothing and Norse thou not that dark wretched miserable poor naked minds and the Lord this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes amen amen he's so be it I'm not Amen in myself but I mean I believe it's the truth this day this scripture is fulfilled the Pentecostal church is in a lady of sea condition or they still jump and holler and carry on When the Music's beaten when the music stops beating or the beatnik music someone playing call it Christianity and whenever that stops all the Glory's gone this is it's a real praise of God there isn't enough whistles and enough the power in the world to stop it when it really comes from God it don't take music to be beat up it takes a spirit of God to come down that is long forgotten the cause of class the gift of the Holy Ghost initial evidence of speaking in tongues and I heard devils and witches speak in tongues the Holy Ghost is a word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting that word kind of that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit denies one word that Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not notice another great sign the Jews are in their Homeland their own Nation their own money a member of the United Nations they got their own armies they got everything they're in their Homeland which Jesus said learn a parable of the fig tree there they are right back in their Nation this day this scripture is fulfilled the Jews in their Homeland this day this scriptures fulfilled the lady I see a church age this day this scripture Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in corruption the whole thing nations against Nations earthquakes and divers places great whirlwinds coming down shaking the Nations and so forth great disasters everywhere this day this scripture is fulfilled now we found out the condition of the world we see where the church novel the normal organization the nomination we see where they are we see where the nations are and we see that this day these promises is fulfilled now but in this okay there is to come a super raw Seed of Abraham that's exactly you want to be with the Aurora bride to the Royal concern is not it will be a natural City it'll be a spiritual seed there has to be a spiritual bride things up which will be the Royal seat of the royal faith of Abraham's royal son she is to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise is given to her according to Malachi 4 of scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again there's a rise one on the scene in the power of Elijah that arrives on the scene of wilderness man that'll come out and will have a message out from right straight back to the word again that's the hour that we're living in then consider that is in this hour you people here of Jeffersonville in 1933 the supernatural light that fell down here on the river that day when it was baptized with 500 in the name of Jesus Christ that was about a 20 year old boy what did it say Jeffersonville what was it at the foot of Spring Street there when the Courier Journal I believe is a little hurdle packed the article of it went from across the Associated Press come into Canada Dr Lee Bale cut it out of the paper way up in Canada in 1933. well it's baptizing my 17th person under this witness and you know the rest of the story they must stand there and baptize the 17th person a light come down from heaven Shining as has just hit the forerun the first coming of Christ your message shall Fallen foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign what happened this day is what around the world and when God came down there and said that when I was a little boy I had a burning bush or bush up in her own fire with a pillar of fire up here at Walter's place on Utica water back there from that Barn to the moonshine still you know the truth of it he said don't you never smoke or drink or defile your body for us to work for you do we get older I testified that that means the truth that I saw it and God as he did with Moses spoke out before the congregation down there and said this is the truth the state this scripture is fulfilled you miss Dennis watch what he said about the discernment and how it would be from laying hands upon to knowing the secret of the heart this day this scripture is fulfilled before our very eyes these promises that was made in other words all these promises have been Vindicated and fulfilled by the god of the promise look hanging in Washington D.C tonight the picture of the Angel of the Lord as George J Lacey the head of the FBI fingerprinting document for the United States government examiner from Houston Texas and said this is the only supernatural videos ever photographed in all the world the ought to know he's the best is in the world or notice that thanks as a truth the same Pillar of Fire that let Israel that counter in the wilderness is leading today [Applause] come up out of Egypt this day this scripture is fulfilled you know the message that he said look at the beach of Tucson three years ago we're standing up down the lane when five years before that he said the day that the city drives the state down in front of that gate turned herself towards the West my Tabernacle of folks that sure knows that that time that's right have a day that Mr going Sam is up there at drove that state down I said the wife is something about this she said what is it now when he looked in my little book there it was and that next morning at 10 o'clock sitting in my room there about 10 o'clock the angel of the Lord came down he said go to Tucson you'll be in northeast of Tucson and there have come seven angels in a cluster that will shake the whole Earth around you and said it'll be told you from there how many remembers that here way before it happened there's a man sitting right here in this Billy guy it was standing right there when it happened and said the seventh feels all the hidden mysteries of the entire Bible be open and fulfill Revelations 10 that in the seven angels message these things should come to mind this day this scripture is fulfilled before our eyes this day this scripture is fulfilled last year standing in the same place Mr Woodshire and I going up the hill in a kind of mourning about his wife being sick the holy spirit said pick up a rock laying there throw it up in the air when it comes down say thus say at the Lord there will be judgments strike the Earth telling that he'll see the hand of God the next few hours I told him Mr Woods's present tonight and I guess eight or ten of a man of 15 that was there at that time when it took place the next morning where the Lord came down in a of wind and ripped the mountain out around us and cut the tops of the trees and made three flags and said Johnson but it's headed towards the West Coast amen two days after that Alaska almost sunk beneath the Earth I had since then up and down the coast of belches of God's judgment against that spiritual screen there is a iron curtain there is a bamboo curtain there is a sand curtain civilizations travel with the Sun so has the gospel they've come from the East and went West like the sun goes and now it's on the west coast it can't go no further if it goes further it'll be back East again the prophet said there will come a day there cannot be cold night or days a Discord a lot of rain has fallen just enough how to know how to join a church or what's your name on a book but it's shall about the evening [Applause] this day this scripture is fulfilled the same [Applause] the same s-u-n that rises in the East is the same s-u-n that sets in the west and the same s-o-n of God that come in the East and Vindicated himself as God God manifested in the flesh is the same so in a thought in the Western Hemisphere here that's identifying itself among the church tonight the same yesterday that Israel [Music] evening eyes as the sun has come this day this scripture is fulfilled before us what are we at in this abrahamic age where are we in this great time we're standing the great hour that we're living all the Visions has been fulfilled how about one little Minister friend of ours your associate sister Church Junior Jackson come running up to us one night me downstairs to the head of the dream Brother Band That's bother me I've seen older brother and gathered upon a heel instead of on this hill you were teaching us out of letters that was wrote look like in some letters at time they carved out in The Rock when he finished that all that was finished you told us said come close and we all gathered up said you reached from somewhere and look like God like a crowbar and with the top of this little Pyramid open and when it did said granite rock with no writing on it and you told us to look in upon this and you always we all started looking so I turned my head and I noticed you going towards the West just as hard as you could towards just setting up a sun how many remembers it now I stood down a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name and all these things has been revealed but various secrets that's hid inside because the Bible seal with Seven Seals I must go there to find it that morning when there were seven angels come down and blasted the Earth and rocks through every way seven angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the seventh seal to the seven Mysteries we all be opened here we are today we're understanding serpency in a few days of God willing to understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that God's open to ever seal the message sets the foundation of the world John the presence of his presence that is true this day the Scripture A Life Magazine packed an article of it Mystic Circle of Life goes up in the air about Tucson and Phoenix in the same way that I told you nearly a year before it happened how to be in a like a triangle the picture hangs in the church down there you took that magazine has it there it was just exactly it said it's 27 miles high and 30 miles across they don't understand yet what happened it appeared mysteriously and went away mysteriously and brother Fred Savin brother Gene Norman asked and there are three as a witness I get up all the top of the mouth Peter James and John they give Witnesses there it is hanging in the sky so far there's no humidity no moisture nothing to make them a fog how could it come there was the angels of God returning back add to their message this day that prophecy has been fulfilled and on this this day this scripture has been fulfilled watch Seven Seals has been opened the world wins to the West Coast like they did backyard now our attention a little closer to our day what does the scripture say about today and about the time we live in Jesus speaking won't have time to take them all but I want to take this one before we close Jesus said in Saint Luke the 17th chapter the 31st Jesus Christ the word himself you believe that Jesus Christ the word himself made flesh spoke and said what the word would be in the end time what would be the sign of the end of the world he told him they should arise against Nation but he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed now when Jesus came to the Earth he came in the name of Three Sons son of man which is a prophet Son of God and Son of David now he literature on Earth he never did say he was the son of God he said I'm the son of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man because he had to come to fulfill scripture as a prophet Moses said the larger God shall raise up a prophet likened into me that's the reason he could not be the Son of God there because he was a son of man he the word came to the prophets and he was the word in his fullness amen son of man the major prophet not the major prophet but the god prophet fullness of the godhead bodily was in it therefore he was the son of man now for two thousand years he's been known to us as Son of God spirit and in the Millennium he'll be son of David upon the throne we all know that he would believe the scriptures now Jesus said just at the end of this church age that we're living in that the son of man would be revealed again in the same manner it was as it was as Sodom [Music] thank you [Music] [Laughter] thank you
