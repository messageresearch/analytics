live every day in order of his resurrection praise the Lord so we just want to thank the Lord for for placing it upon our heart burning your heart to be here tonight I know many of you have to work around your work schedule in different things but it's a good thing to be in the house of the Lord praise the lord we also want to greet those that are streaming into the service tonight we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and I'm telling you uh this place was milky last night amen say that we praise the Lord that was just such a sweet spirit in this place so that's that's what brought that song to my mind I just been thinking about it sweet sweet Holy Spirit praise the Lord amen and uh how many of you young people turn into the youth meeting this uh this afternoon praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord it was it was wonderful it was wonderful thank you for participating and I think for the beginning that was it was very impressive it was very impressive if you if you were in that Tony and you you missed a whole lot and now uh you know uh youth meeting is just it's just it's just a title I would say just like brother Harry Beckett in Cape Town South Africa he says the Rapture is a Nintendo youth meeting right yeah praise the Lord amen this is the rapture it's an eternal youth meeting and so youth meeting is is just it's just a title that we that we pulled over there but uh is is the word of God amen and uh and because it's the word of God there is just no subject in the word of God that you are ordered in to think that no it's just for young people that's a misunderstanding and especially you parents is good for you to follow praise the Lord I've seen many parents comes from youth meeting and then they get they get uh you know a little bit upset because their child is saying something this is I don't know even what they are teaching you don't know what they are teaching go there and know right because it might not be the teacher it might just be the child that misunderstand what he said sure praise the Lord so I think that was that was a good stat that was I was very very I was I was proud of the young people participating reading and uh you know sharing and I was I was very very proud of of that I was proud of that praise the Lord amen yeah you might not see my name but I was I was telling me amen praise the Lord I was I was tuning and I was following but I was I was glad I was glad that uh the fellowship and the things that were shared they were all wonderful praise the Lord so tonight we are here for the word of the Lord praise the Lord and it's good to have our brother brother Michael Halloween and his wife sister Tracy sister Tracy is sitting back there gonna have them coming to you to be with us this weekend and I'm sure that the

minutes amen everyone appreciate their worship service appreciate the musicians appreciate for the wine giving this opportunity to be here tonight my name is brother Michael Holloway I heard him introduce my wife Tracy back there we're from Charlotte North Carolina we attend the small Fellowship down in Dallas North Carolina just outside of Gastonia calling blue Tabernacle and uh Pastor Harris Mark Hall senior and he wanted me to pass on a greetings to the church here in Minnesota first time being here amen we just pray to be a blessing all right pastor and I've been talking a couple of times excuse me since last year and uh didn't seem to work out at different occasions but this one worked out so we're glad we're here we're interested it's going to be for his purpose for your blessing amen amen so uh you know my Ministry I uh consider myself to be a teacher for what that's worth and uh but we just trust that we can yield to God that he can use the gift however he wants to use it don't consider myself to be a long-winded preacher and uh certainly consider myself to be a simple preacher but uh but I love the Lord I love his word and so uh so I enjoy the Mysteries but I having times tried to teach those myself sometimes those things get confusing so I finally keep my gift where God placed it and that's the simple things and the brothers that know how to fly their way and take it I'd pray for him and said thank the Lord for him and I just care to keep minding where he placed me and we work together and keep it balanced so uh so thank God for his grace his mercy and the opportunity to be here tonight so not grow up alone a time if you have your Bibles I'm going to invite you to determine the book of Romans the eighth chapter and I just ask that you pray for me and uh give me an about attention for about 45 minutes per hour maybe somewhere along in there I have the long should lead sometimes a little shorter sometimes a little longer but we committed to him and uh and if I say something that maybe doesn't quite seem correct to you then I sincerely say chocolate to migrants pray for the preacher put that aside but keep eating because I believe there'd be something good on the table there's something good on the table if you have your Bibles look at Romans the 8th chapter verse 28 and before we read I'll ask you to buy you hit me forward of Prayer dear heavenly father Lord I want to give you thanks for your grace tonight thank you for the safe travels you've given us to be here thank you for the fellowship we had this afternoon Resort enjoy being built the Saints Lord the trip has been a blessing thus far we've been treated very well tonight the purpose for coming Lord is as much as we love the fellowship was not so much to Fellowship the Lord there's a will of God to be done Lord there's no way a man can do it in the self even understand what it is to be done Lord that'll take you forgive us of our sins me chiefly God use the service For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen Romans the eighth chapter one verse and it says and we know that means there's a security you say I know something this is Surety we know we are sure that all things work together for good to them love God to them who are the called according to his purpose it's about it's once again dear Lord we thank you once again for the reading of your word Lord used to give speak to your people we actually give you thanks in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated now after my long introduction about I don't consider myself a teacher that goes out in a deep things my title of night is the mystery of redemption the Mr Redemption and I don't call it a misredemption because I plan on making this very mysterious I call it a mystery Redemption because redemption in itself is a mystery amen you understand just like the godhead in itself is a mystery so it's not that I'm planning on making it some great swelling words of Mystery but the topic in itself is a mystery and the reason it's not a mystery is tonight is because by God's grace he sent an angel Messenger to unfold the Mysteries amen so the mystery tonight my title is the mystery of redemption what is redemption let's just take a look at how the prophet explains it let's see how simply makes this Redemption in a message paradox brother Brown says Joshua here is a book actually it is the book of redemption of the Old Testament just we have to consider it to be that the book of redemption because its Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts now I like this no matter whether we're talking about spiritual Redemption we're talking about natural things that are being redeemed Redemption anywhere by its definition for the Ramses has two parts amen he said that is out of and I want you to catch this it's very important for tonight out of and into he said it takes two parts to make Redemption out of and into it goes on to explain how the Old Testament was a type of redemption he said Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and whereas Joshua represented Grace that took them into the promised land so you see there had to be a coming out of and then there had to be something that takes them into to be Redemption just coming out of Egypt was not Redemption there had to be something to complete the process and the process wasn't completed about coming out the process was completed by the act of going in so he said I called Joshua the book of redemption because Joshua's where it was completed Moses did the first half he brought them out but Joshua completed their Redemption because he was the Angel God used to take them in Now You Follow Me so it means come out of one condition or one order and to go into another because the two conditions listen cannot coexist at the same time you can be in this condition and in that condition at the same time brother Brown said there's no such thing as a sober drunk man you can be a drunk man and be a soul man at the same time you got to come out of the space for being drunk in order to truly be in the state or being sober or you follow me so there has to be two farts and the two parts cannot coexist at the same time the Church of Israel could not come out or live in Egypt watch this they could not in live in Egypt and at the same time enjoy the flowing milk and honey in the promised land in order to enjoy the floor and milk and honey they had to first come out before they could go in to enjoy it to others so you farm you see what I'm getting at Redemption has two parts two different places and two different conditions that was the Redemption of Israel God's natural Sunrise was in type and so is it with God's spiritual sons and daughter us this New Testament Church we have to be willing and able to make a change in order to be The Heirs of redemption now Redemption listen that's only one part of the Redemption when we talk about out of and into that's one part of it I want you to watch how brother Brandon brings another part of redemption in and Redemption also means to restore it means to put back in the hands or the rightful owner so why Redemption has two parts out of and into the actual meaning of the word means to restore Now watch how brother bam describes this in a message who is this Melchizedek he said the predestinated is the only one that's considered in the Redemption now we're going to get to that in just a minute he said did you get it he said let me say that again the predestinator is the only one that's considering the Redemption people might be making like or thinking they are but now watch this but the real Redemption is to those that are predestinated because the very word redeemed marriage get into the definition the very word redeemed means to bring back now I'm not getting into the deepness of predestination so kind of relax a little bit that's not my point but I want you to catch this very point he said the very Act of redemption means to bring back is that right he said the redeem is something to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place so now watch this we're coming out of and we're going in too but what are we coming out of we're coming out of one condition to go back to its original place or you'll follow me so if we just stay out of the oven into out of what and into what Redemption means you're going out of one condition and you're going back to an original place and I want you to watch this he said Hallelujah he said so it's owning a predestined it'll be brought back because the others didn't come from there he said see he said to bring back so now in order for Israel to go to the promised land get this there had to be some seed that placed them in their land before they can ever go back or you follow me now I want you to watch this so in order for them to come out of Egypt and go into Promised Land there had to be something that connected him to the land before they ever got there and I want you to watch this they came out of Egypt as the people to enter into Palestine but that country of Palestine listened was the same country that was once promised to their father Abraham so the son that was going to Israel was only going back to the land that was promised to their father Abraham while you're watching this they left listen they left the land and they left the land in the days of Jacob there was a land the time that God had given to Abraham and the Isaac and Jacob they left the land of Jacob and they went down to Egypt but in order to be redeemed they were only going back listen to the same land it wasn't a different land it wasn't a different promise it's just a different time why in a different generation that was being redeemed out of one country going back into the country that they should have been in they entire I want to say it again they should have been in the entire time you see you and I are included as part of God's Redemption we're in his hands tonight I heard a brother say we're serving a living savior we're in his hands tonight and guess what we should have been in his hands the entire time but there was something that took us away it was called a fall of the garden but Redemption is to bring you back and to the power of the hand you should have been in the entire time now watch this sister take Jacob's seed back to the same land in the Book of Genesis chapter 15 verse 7 it goes like this and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of Earth accordions God's speaking to Abraham I brought thee out of the Earth the Chaldeans to give thee this land to inherit it so God had Abraham standing in a place he had called him out of one place and he brought him into listening to the Palestine and he said I've given you this land for you to inherit it I want you to watch this and he said unto the Lord whereby shall I know that I shall inherit in other words can you give me a sign that I could have confidence that this inheritance is mine he said now watch the sign he gave them the sign he gave Abraham was a sacrifice how do I know that I'm going to be brought back to my inheritance God Gave Me A Sign it was a man that hung on the cross it was a sacrifice it wasn't by Abraham's work he was going to get this land but it was by the sacrifice he was to put his confidence because the sacrifice became a covenant between man and between God and this sacrifices my Covenant that God made to me and said I make your promise brother Holloway that by the sacrifice I'm going to bring you back to where you belong so in our good days I'm happy in my bad days I'm happy why it's not me that matters It's My Sacrifice and I want you to watch this and he said unto him take me a heifer of three years old and if she go to three years old all these type in Christ in a rama three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took them on he took unto him all these and divided him in the midst and laid them each piece one against another but the birds are divided not and when the files came down upon the carcass Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lower horror of great Darkness fell upon him and God said unto Abram no other surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs now I want you to watch this he just told him I give you this land he said but Abraham you're going to need Redemption you're not you but your seed is gonna need Redemption why I'm going to tell you even though I give you this land to you and your seat after you they're going to leave this land and they're going to go into a land of a stranger that's not theirs but watch this watch what he says he said and they shall serve them and they shall afflict in 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve I will judge and after what they should come out and with great substance and thou shall go to be with our fathers in peace and thou shall be buried in good old days but listen but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again Redemption the same land that you're standing on that I'm promising to you there's going to be a generation of seed after you that's going to come back and stand in the same land and possess the land that you're not living in so they have to come out of wet land of strangers in order to enter back into something that they should have possessed the entire time that's Redemption they were going to a Strange Land that I did not promise them I never said they had to go to Egypt I said they would I never said it had to but they would but because they would I promise to bring them back so after 400 years they should come out and enter into this place that have promised them now watch this but in the fourth generation they should come hither again not to a new land here hither right here again Redemption coming back to the same place back to the same land now how does this apply to you and I today let's look at my title again my title is to miss Redemption but my sub topic is call for a purpose my title is the mystery of redemption my subtitle has called for a purpose God called Israel out of Egypt to establish them at a certain land listen for a certain purpose that purpose was that they might serve him for 400 years they knew what it was like to serve pharaoh they did not know what it's like to serve God but God's Redemption was not to bring them out to serve him the same way that served Pharaoh they serve pharaoh and fear they serve Pharaoh with task Masters God didn't want them to serve him that way God wanted to serve him but you have to learn what it's like to serve a living God so God wants them to come out to serve him watch What God Says in the book of Exodus chapter 8 verse one and the Lord God speaking of Moses go on the Pharaoh and send to him thus said the Lord let my people go that they might serve me say any Redemption not everyone will come back to a land but they came back to a land for a purpose they were called out of Egypt for a purpose yes if they only came out it was in the wilderness and didn't recognize their purpose they missed the call of redemption but the real Revelation was not just to come out but to recognize I'm a free man and I've been called now for a purpose [Music] you were not called out by Malachi 4 for wander we were not called out just to be another movement but every one of us tonight that have received this Malachi 4 call God called you for purpose [Music] and that purpose is a part of your Redemption You See Redemption was not only bring them back to their inheritance but God was bringing the people back to his own inheritance the people belong listen not to pharaoh you and I don't belong to this world but we have Redeemed by price in order to fulfill God's purpose Paul put it this way in First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 19. Paul says what know he not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you you know now watch this Israel was called back to that land to dwell with God right there was a tabernacle that was established in that land and that Tabernacle was the place in which they would have come and fellowship with their God and offer sacrifice and bring Thanksgiving and tell God how good he was for bringing him out of Egypt they were to Fellowship listen with God and that lamb and the real belief of the day was not called out of the world just to wander but we're going to come back into the same Fellowship that Adam had in the Garden of Eden God wants you not to have the same Fellowship back with God again amen Adam was not afraid of God when God came down animals looking forward to the presence of God and in Redemption we've been restored back side Fellowship Fellowship not the fear of the law but the power of Grace to know God is redeeming for a purpose Paulson knowing that your body's the Temple of the Holy Ghost which he have of God listen and ye are not your but he had been brought with a you see in the Redemption God paid the price to bring Israel out of Egypt but not just to being a promised man to do what they wanted to God said I'm calling to this promised land that they might serve me there was a real purpose for God creating that Nation he wanted the people that was going to be separated from all of the Nations not to follow a law of per se but to worship God and true Holiness recognizing that they had a redeemer that could bring them out and they were not to mingle with the rest of the world and watch this but you're not your own but you've been brought with a price therefore listen glorify God in your body and in your spirits which are are you following me you've been called and redeemed for a purpose see a Satan can keep our minds down to a certain level we all make mistakes as long as you got breath in your body you're gonna have them yeah he said but you shouldn't judge yourself by your mistakes he said judge yourself by the desire in your heart what you desire to do for God he said in the blood of Christ takes care of everything else but see saying keeps us so low that I'm not worried that our Lord knows I'm not I'm not worthy to get in the plane to fly to Charlotte to come to me the answers to speak to this group I'm not worried that but for some reason for some purpose I gotta get beyond my own sight of myself and say Lord what are you doing can you use this Crystal and vegetable Clay is there something you're doing for the Holloway that's going to help our people and meaning if it's just one can you do it Lord if you can yield yourself to me these little boys sitting here in the front row tonight to be used to God I don't care what they know what they don't know I don't care where they've been and where they hadn't been if the Holy Spirit could get a hold of one of these boys tonight he could do more than boys that he could do with any other person in this building if you need to hold his boys because why it is not the power of the vessel but it's the power that's able to work in the vessel did more in David than he can do his entire Army of Israel why he had one little boy that the Holy Ghost could hold up and what are gonna do he can destroy Army that the army of Israel couldn't touch because of what God can do and he gets a hold of a person now I want you to watch this God called you for a purpose let the Holy Spirit have you for that amen let me keep going see our purpose there's a purpose by which we recall we have been separated from the world not to relax but to find and to fulfill the purpose in which we were called out for this age and I called out for another age but for call now why did God redeem me call me out of the world to bring me back to himself just like he called Israel out of Egypt to bring him back to himself why did God want to call Michael Holloway out to himself in this age let me keep going the first step listen in this Redemption if we must recognize the place that we're living listen was not where God ordained us to be you see in order to be redeemed you have to want to get out of that condition you take a man as happy in the world leaving there said brother how well you just said a big thing I just I did leave him there brother Brandon saw a man one time when Billy Paula backslid and Billy Paul was sitting in church and they had altar called the man came to build upon tab on the back and said Billy Paul don't want to go to the Altar and burn down to that man don't you touch my son again right he said you leaving right there to God calls him because if there's not something in his heart where he's ready to change you're wasting your time praying to the altar you see Jesus Christ to say coming to me the world he said come unto me all you that labor and I want heavy lady there's got to be something in the man heart that's ready for a change even though Israel was going to be in the Redemption God had to raise the Pharaoh that knew not Joseph because as long as they have metals and leaks they were happy but when the Taskmaster started beating them and taking down a bridge they said Lord get us out of here there's got to be something in the man that's reading for attemption [Music] the man's happy in the world in there oh that man could be Christ said brother I'm tired I'm tired cigarettes I'm tired now you got something to work with nothing is wrong he's never I love my past I love my church then stay there but when that man starts saying brother something wrong I ain't happy I ain't getting fed my soul is hungry now you got something to work with you can offer them a better way he's ready to come out of that condition to enter into a better condition [Music] now watch this no matter how a person if he's happy in a certain condition there's not a whole lot you can do but once that person recognizes I'm not satisfied anymore I'm not said now now you're dealing with a soul that the Holy Ghost is brewing on you follow me that on the happiness because now they were happy in the world for 25 30 40 years sometimes they were happy but all of a sudden one day they're not happy no more what is that that's the holy ghost coming down starting to brood over that Soul or your father he's calling him back to something the same thing brother Brown said about the man that was a car salesman he said oh he said when his wife got saved he said honey why don't you come to church and get the she said uh what is it uh get happy like I did he said get the religion or something like he the wife told her husband and he said oh no honey that ain't for me you going to church I don't mind you go to church I give you the checkbook you pay tiers you help the print Ministry out you do what you want to do but all that religions that ain't for me I'm happy doing what I'm doing she left him alone then one day he reached his pocket yeah he put out a track the track said where will you spend eternity all of a sudden something came over me what was it it was the Holy Ghost you see his wife words wasn't enough but when the Holy Ghost came down and anointed that man and said where he's been eternity all of a sudden he recognized something's different [Music] I don't know I'm gonna turn it he said but I realized this I gotta settle that question now he's ready to listen See Redemption means you've got to be ready to come out of that condition in order to rightfully enter into the next condition you know back in the Redemption in the Old Testament when a man had six cities a refuge yes one on three on one side of the river and Well on one side the uh uh the the Jordan and one three on the other side of Jordan but before a man could enter that City you know he had to make an agreement he couldn't come in that City fussing no no you ain't got enough food here I don't like the way they cook and the way that people act around here you're just too religious for me in order to go in that City of Refuge you had to want to be there you had to feel that that smash Slayer that was looking for your life you had to feel he was bad enough I don't care what's in that City I'd rather be that City let out here with the manslayer [Music] he had to be happy to be there he said boy it feels so peaceful in here that boy has to love it so much that why he didn't have to worry about him going back out because he was happy to be there but if a person not happy there you're better off leaving it when it happened until they're ready to make a change [Music] let me keep going they had to recognize something else and when the gospel come to you and I what do we recognize there was a better way sister I don't care what I've been through in my life a nightclub that partied I was one of the boys with a little red and black jumpsuit so I'm spinning on my back that was brother Holloway but one day the worst the message came and God began to deal with my heart and I realized I wasn't happy spinning on my back I might have thought I was having fun with the boys but it wasn't satisfied but I found something that's satisfied because I got to inspired my life my bills started piling up and all of a sudden my business started failing and I said I'm just not happy no more and all of a sudden somebody came to me said would you like to come to church and I said yes I would and I came to church and a man had a call and I gave my life to Christ and you said brother my dad's a denomination it might have been but there was something real came in my heart because why I was ready for it even back then before the message came there was something in my heart said I need God and when I received Christ that lick I used to drink every night I came home all over the cabinets I took the top off at the pan and probably 30 a bottle and I pulled it right down and say wow something told me you don't need that no more I understand I'm saying I'm talking about Redemption there's got to be something you ready to come out of then God can say now here's something you can enter into and he ain't worried about you going back because you're gonna enjoy it when you get there now watch this you will call from what you once were to now you're here to recognize your true purpose you were never born to be a sinner you never born to struggle with bills you never stronger have body aches and pain makes that comes with age and I'm telling you you know yeah the internet experience that brother told one time keep breathing it comes with age but you weren't born for that right your purpose in being born in this Earth was to be a child of almighty God do you realize if Adam would have never seen in a garden every one of us would have been born from birth as Sons and Daughters from God Adam would have said let there be and he didn't look at that book and he saw your name he said it's time for the Holloway Let There Be and endure would have done this and God was a woof and then have been a breath of life in me not a war just like Adam explicit if it were to come God's intending way yeah but in the fall we've come another way so now God has revived away called Calvary to redeem us to bring us back to what you should have had now the only name that was in that book Brothers said was not your name like Michael or or Brother Juan or anything like that or brother Steve that's not in the book he said what's in a book is your purpose that you were to fulfill in Asian when she was to live John the Baptist is going to be a voice of one crying in a building is what preparing with the Lord it wasn't written that he was John the Baptist but it was written what that man would do when he came in his age it doesn't say William random but it said behold I should send you Malachi for but it's talking about a certain man in a certain age at a certain time and you and I will call for a purpose and you know you're gonna find it right here in the book [Music] but because we were born in sin we bypassed it right but by preaching the gospel God brings it back and opens it up and shows you you miss something you miss something that's right you missed something and when I see it right there I said I sure did Lord forgive me I want that right there [Music] it is right there in a book and when God saw you for the foundation world he didn't see me break dancing on my back he didn't see me in the club drinking liquor that ain't how he saw me when God saw him for about his word he saw me as the Son of God walking on this Earth that was his purpose now how do we get to this listen there's got to be something in you that hungers for a different life then once you begin to hunger God can show you what a different life is all about now I want you to watch this he can show you the real purpose to bring a person back to the purpose for which they were born watch how Paul puts us in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20. Paul said I am crucified with Christ in other words he was so tired of that life he did as a Pharisee he was ready to die to it in order that he might come out of that to enter to a new revelation not the Revelation that his father's taught him but the revelation of Jesus Christ now watch this I'm crucified with Christ never listen now watch this I Live Now watch this you're not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live that's what he entered into I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me what was Paul doing he was describing two lives one time his life meant being a Pharisee and he was a good one Paul said when they come to the law I was blameless I didn't I didn't do this I didn't do that when it come to law I knew exactly how to be a good Pharisee but when the Revelation came he realized God had a different purpose for that Jew than being a good Pharisee now I want to take my time on this it's not a matter of how good we are at anything it's recognized a purpose for which you were created and there's only one man can show you what that is right it ain't the preacher it ain't even the prophet there's only one man that can show us what that is it's the same man that came to Paul and said Paul Paul wild thou kicking the Pricks it takes that man to come to you personally to show you who you are and what you're created for president said what is a new birth in Christ the mystery said what is it he said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally our preacher can teach you our preacher can help you he can point you the right way but until that Christ comes to you personally now watch this and when he came to Paul personally Paul said a life I now live in the flesh it was the same flesh God never changed Paul's body he never said let me give you new sales in New Adams he never said let me put you in the ground and pull you back up again Paul said I live a different life what was so different if the Bible didn't change it was the Revelation that was in his heart something changed him from the love of the law something changed him to the love of Jesus Christ or you following me now watch this his Horrors will change and some Creed not some Creed a new doctrine but a personal experience by the revelation of Jesus Christ that brought Paul to this new life not his old life patched up the passing out riding today going to lunch he had the youth meeting on and I don't know who was doing instructing but I like what he was saying this message it's not about how hard you can try to live with that Prophet taught and the used example of About a Boy brother Bram said that was about to marry a girl and that boy was doing everything right as far as the Christian duties that people would say it's oh he's a fine young man he's a Christian brother I'm saying but it's still in him there's something that's not quite right I will leave everything's there but annually where the real change has to come whoever that was teaching I appreciated the way you brought about something in that boy had not changed something inside of him still loved he had a connection to that old life but it's not a matter of whether your flesh gets tired of working but when the soul Jesus Christ said he that heavy Lane and his soul will get rest not the flesh the soul has to be the one that's tired of the way things are then the Soul could find his change but religion could teach this man hear how to walk better our brother I'll talk number one today he said he used to hang out around the Seminary to see who we could find a witness to he said his sort of boards of assembly they're practicing the sermon no honestly I hit you up yeah I like that you see he's working on the flesh but if the Holy Ghost you're getting the pulpit yell that gift and watch God use it [Applause] and it works outside the pool because it doesn't work in the Pulpit are you follow me but it's something that changes the man from the inside and I think that's what the brother was emphasizing the boy had lived a good life but there had not been a change on the inside let me keep going there's got to be literally a new life comes in and that new life makes you a new creation the old man has passed away and behold All Things become new and that new man isn't just a new doctrine it's a person Jesus Christ the word come into you now let's watch how Paul got there with himself Paul was a starch Pharisee as I said as a Pharisee Paul carried the word the prophet Isaiah said tell us Paul break it down oh righteous shall conceive and here she go walking right by him no clue what's happening the voice of one Crown in the wilderness there he is on the corner call him an old crank the spirit of laws that fall upon All Flesh and here they are listen now preaching the gospel in flesh and Paul looking at the same people with that Bob in his hands and locking them up you see what I'm getting at that was Paul's first life Paul said listen but listen for I was least amongst the apostles and not meet or worry that it be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God see he didn't understand the mystery of redemption Not only was God going to have a church but he was going to do some Paul really couldn't understand she was gonna be a gentile Not only was he going to have a church that he could live in but Paul it isn't going to be your people I put them to the side she's gonna be a gentile so here's the man that thought he knew the word but yet he was persecuting the word because he had not met the person of Revelation [Applause] or you follow me now watch this watch how this work for Paul Galatians chapter 1 verse 13. Paul said if I've heard if you've heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion Paul said that's a religion once he met this all that law that was a religion he knew the real thing now if you heard my conversation time passing a Jewish religion how'd that beyond measure I persecuted who the Church of God and wasted it here's the Paul the man that thought it was such a big man as a Pharisee saying I was wasting my time because the thing that God was actually doing the real move of God instead of me propping it up I was trying to tear it down let me keep going you see Paul's Choice it was the speak against the church and to persecute it that was his choice now watch my title again call for what a purpose God never called Paul to tear down nobody's Church he did call Paul to take down the law but not to take down nobody's Church Paul was actually ordained to help establish a church and not one but one in galatia one in ever since one Colossians follow me Paul was an apostle he went all around the region to work propping up churches everywhere he went so the thing that he once torn down was actually contrary to what he was called to do but in Revelation had to show him you're going wrong come out of that condition Paul come into your real predestinated Calling in Redemption it called him out of what he was to reveal to him his real purpose in life this message is revealed to me my real purpose brother Brown said I'm not a son of Charles Miller Branham my real purpose in life was to be Son of God I used to want to be a big businessman when I used to be on my back spinning around in my little black and red jumpsuit thinking I was cool when I was in college getting my education you know why because I was gonna make money and to make money you gotta go to school so I'm going to school to learn I'm gonna show these folks something they don't take a little black boy out of the Bronx can learn how to make money all they think we can do is spin around our back and go poop I'm gonna show him I'm gonna get magication I'm gonna go down and start my business I'll make me a bunch of money I'm gonna drive right up into the business district say who's that Thug he said that's the man that owns that building right there cause I'm gonna show them what a little boy out of Bronx New York can do and while I'm in a process they're getting my education yeah I had a car accident the doctor said I wasn't supposed to make it matter of fact they called my mother said you got a bow before they die if you want to say goodbye to your son I was there give me up I was in intensive care on respirators machine keep them alive they said come say goodbye to him I wasn't saved I was lost but I wasn't predestinated for that purpose so God had to change circumstances because if you're ordained to be a certain thing listen there's not the death nor Hell no power no principality nothing in this life or the world could come to separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus I don't care how much I spent on my back no matter how much I was dealing drugs no matter how much I was drinking liquor God said That's my boy and I've already paid for him so this you cannot have him and the boy that was dying the doctors gave up all of a sudden the body started stretching it again and it regained conscious again it could talk it could walk they said we wouldn't be the walk again I can walk and I could jump and I ain't gonna try to jump too high my 57 I might hear some but I can jump what brought me back Redemption [Applause] Israel didn't deserve that land but how did they get it Redemption by God's elective love he made a promise to Abraham and he was going to keep that promise or you follow me so God has a purpose for every elect person you didn't come to this message because your mama was in this message or your dad was in his message or Brother Juan was such a good teacher he knew how to break that thing down and though he's a good teacher you break it down that wasn't alone wasn't it there had to be something deeper working in you and what you got to learn to do is to like Abraham Lord how should I know I'm gonna get it let me show you Abraham there's a sacrifice and if you can have confidence in this confidence nothing is going to keep you out of that land [Music] have your confidence and your sacrifice and My Sacrifice revealing me as a bleeding blood and word of this age I'm not on the Lutheran sacrifice that was a good sacrifice and I don't know where's the sacrifice that was good sacrifice I'm not even under Pentecostal sacrifice I'm under Malachi 4. sacrifice the fullness of the lamb be slain I can eat lutherans that'd give me a little strength in my legs strength around my loins I get the Pentecost to give me a little stretch of my lips I speak in tongues but I wanted to poor lamb I want the whole body the hell listen to have the fullness of redemption what is that fullness of redemption go to the Book of Genesis look at what the first man was the first Adam when Christ came as the last Adam he came to demonstrate what the first Adam looked like when he cursed that tree he shows what Adam could do are you following me when you talk to the storms to the winds he shows what Adam could do and he came to redeem me back to that not to a church order we've gotten good at church order and I'm thankful for it because without order without Doctrine for the best of church got no backbone but he didn't call me back to church harder I'm feeling pretty good not Rohan he didn't say brother Holloway when the Jews came out of the promised land and the Wilderness Brother Juan they got church order but they would call the church order they will cause the fullness of Redemption where Abraham walk you walk the same streets where Abraham Fellowship you Fellowship the same streets where Abraham prays to God you build an altar right there and praise your God Abraham then Worship in the wilderness he was in the land I don't want to stop in the wilderness order was established in the wilderness but it was necessary yes I want the order but my heart's hungering for the promise how many said I'm going to spend when I'm getting that yeah God called me out for a purpose what did that reward in this age tell me that purpose would be he told Brother Branham and Rising the son he said that in the first age there was a wave Chief weighed said there was one his name was Jesus Christ the word but God waved him saying what to the world he was just a first but on the day of Pentecost there's coming more just like him yeah there was so much like him the Bible said they called him Christians because they were so christ-like when they saw those men they saw Jesus Christ and Paul said how did I do it he said it's not I that liveth is Christ literally living in me you see I find that some people can come to church and they get satisfied there that's the two and a half tribes that stay in the wilderness but there's some that kid in church by the one they're good people but they just can't seem to satisfy that hunger don't feel bad about yourself that's a good thing listen to him now that's a good thing why because you're hungering for something greater that's something greater is that Christ that can live in you in such a way that you can say just like Paul it's no longer I that liveth but see I like to use that type of like the color man I'm like that color man I thank God for the mess you give me I'm and I eat it I enjoy it but I wipe my mouth I said but there's more of it I'm not going to be satisfied to that little something inside of me said that greater portion that's mine that's what this age has that learn the others did we were promised a double potion are you following me and in order for there to be thank you my brother you know I got one in my pocket I'm just too lazy to pull it out you people make a preacher feel good you're easy to talk to you I mean that sincerely it ain't in every Church don't you let that lift you up I don't mean it that way but sometimes there's an atmosphere as a preacher but the one knows I'm talking about you feel the Liberty you can say what's on your heart and you feel like the people receiving it I believe you received what I'm saying tonight Redemption isn't just coming out you have to have a revelation of what you're going into now let me read Paul and I'm gonna stop I'm gonna finish in the morning let me read Paul's the rest of Paul's message Paul said I persecute the Church of God and wasted it and profiting the Jews religions above many of my equals in my own Nation being more exceeding zealous of the tradition of the fathers see he got caught up in the framework but the Revelation was Jesus Christ the word to him personally yes you follow me now watch that watch what changed it wasn't gamelia's teaching it wasn't some new doctrine but Paul had to receive a personal revelation Jesus Christ appeared to him personally Paul says First Corinthians 15 verse 9 again for I'm the least of the Apostles and not meant to be called an apostle because our persecuted Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am you see he never worked himself up to become an apostle Paul's Choice listen was to be a chief amongst the Pharisees and he had achieved it brother one he was so cheap among the Pharisees they said who can we get to stop this church everybody said Paul Austin I was waiting for y'all to say that says the little boy I wanted to be chief of Muslim Pharisee and I'm there they got such confidence they think I'm the man that can stop this Holy Ghost no no way to stop a holy ghost Revival the Holy Ghost hit him and Paul found out hey it is so bad at all and he become they said now he who once persecuted us has now come one of us I can't tell you how many men I'd have met that told me they first heard this message they got their Bible said I'm gonna prove it wrong they started reading they started reading and said wait a minute these people got some are you following me that's what's Paul's testimony now watch this Paul's desire was to be a chief of the Pharisee but God's desire was to make him an apostle Paul said I'm not impossible because I ever wanted to be one I am what I am by the grace of God now watch this watch this Ephesians chapter one let's look at how Paul becomes an apostle this is what I'm going to let you go I want to show you now if you believe this message if God's dealing with your heart that's not your decision brother Brown was said in so many messages he said it's something you desired that wasn't even in there because you could not desire it he said it's in the center to be like Adam when God calls they run he said God had to give you the desire do you understand now watch this Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ how about a will of God I am what I am by the grace of God it was not my will it was his will now watch this Acts chapter 9 verse 13. an ananias answered now Jesus Christ coming to ananias he said ananias you're servant I got a job for you to do I need to go witness to somebody and I say who is it Lord he says Saul of Tarsus he really got to fasten it is I'd had a bad dream for a minute I had a dream I was talking to the Holy Ghost it made it come back to him again said I'm nice he said oh man what is it Lord I caught somebody to baptize who is the Lord solar tarse now watch out ananias I've heard about many about this man how much evil he has done to thy Saints in the Jerusalem and that he has Authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go that way for he is a [Music] there's a purpose for Paul it ain't to prosecute you it's to join you you understand the mystery of redemption is to take you out of that condition you live most of your life in and bring you back to you're literally a walking talking son and daughter of God and in this age manifesting listen because the promises ages what the manifestations of the sons of God literally manifested what Adam had in the garden you're not going to have it so much soul to listen we're going to have a body without sin we even in this hour Redemption comes to the Redemption of our bodies in a moment in the twinkling of eye I'm not going to have a redeemed Soul Brother one I'm gonna have a body without sin and that little 19 year old boy that's the spirit is back I'm going back to that 19 year old boy [Applause] come on now not spitting on my back but said to the wind peace be still because this is what God meant for me to be but for the foundation of the world and sadly couldn't stop it because I'm called for that purpose don't let Satan beat you down oh yes while we're in this body isn't that what the body is saying Paul said woe unto me for this body of sin and his flesh I deserve the devil let's serve the world but in my spirit I serve God you're going to fight it every day of your life but just make sure you stay prayed up and you can whip him he'll raise up and Paul said I beat him dated black and blue [Music] I ain't going to church shut up where you want to go eat after we get out of church I feed you but we're going to church you see you the Lord he's the Lord of this and you're the Lord of this or you following me yeah how many of them tonight amen let's bow our heads and musicians come that's about his dear heavenly father I want to thank you for your grace tonight there is a mystery called Redemption it's for a people Lord that were foreordained to a certain place but sin made a great blockade but it couldn't stop your purpose so you prepared a lamb Abraham had to provide his own Lambs but for this Redemption it wouldn't be a lamb that was a man offering he'd be a lamb of God that you offered every head by every head bowed Lord I stopped right now for a moment I'm not exactly sure what you desire to do but I do believe you're present I do believe you met me today you talked to me [Music] you give me a thought for tonight I've done all I know to do to this point Lord to heal it to you act as soon as I know how that you forgive me in my sins anything that I would have thought done that would have hindered your move tonight but God may you finish what you started tonight [Music] if there's any here tonight to desire more of that Redemptive power [Music] desire that Jesus Christ would do something for you to take something from you that you're tired of you're ready to let go you're ready to come out of one condition and you're ready now to enter into another condition a preface that God calls you for before the foundation of the world just raise your hand say Lord I'm raising my hand to you I've got a need tonight Lord help me get from this condition that I'm struggling with that I'm battling with Lord take me from this condition and Lord put me into that place that you ordained for me to be or for the foundation of the world God you see the hands you see the hearts Lord mine up too Lord there's things that I'm Desiring to Greater move to Greater Revival for greater power for greater surrender Lord I pray that you bless every hand that's went up tonight every heart that's hungry tonight God made the Holy Ghost move in such a way Lord that you literally tear it from them Lord that they'll be free that they'll know tonight that something has changed not the power of just a decision but the power of God behind that decision God we thank you tonight as we commit all into your hands blessed name of Jesus Christ we ask May the Church Say Amen amen amen amen amen foreign [Music] our such versus when he was on the cross my yes he knew me and he loved me he will glory [Music] so one word our best Mercy when he was on the cross [Music] you understand why I brought up random shadies only those that serve God's purpose thank you Resurrection is promised to the purpose of God because when God is calling the Saints out of the Earth he's not calling one area Joseph Simon God is calling his purpose brother Branham says Resurrection is sure for the purpose of God and that's what all Redemption is about is it's about a purpose [Music] and that's what the devil is trying to keep us from is occupying our mind all you have not achieved this or you are your you are you have not he's just trying to distract us but the word is drawing us to God's purpose and and when you can recognize that just just look at this Simon when they brought Jesus because the Lord has told him you will not die until you see the salvation of Israel and the day that Joseph and Mary entered the temple he said Lord let your servant depart in peace because my eyes have seen the salvation of Israel this is your purpose whatever can happen let it happen I have hit the climax or church when we identify their purpose your life will never be the same you will become one of the most happiest person the problem of Life the struggle of life you will still have them but they will not matter to you foreign [Music] [Music] they ask you just who I am oh tell them I am ready oh yes I am breathing I'm hard with the price Jesus has changed my whole life [Music] oh just who I am telling that I am breathing oh let's sing it to the Lord mouth you believe that tonight yes I am repeat oh I'm bored with a price Jesus has changed [Music] anybody asks you oh and just so I am tell them that I am your brother Max says something tonight you know that's that's the thing with preachers I mean teachers they are very organized they still write in time I just feel like running tonight praise the Lord there's more time to preach tonight I just feel ironic tonight with the thought of our brother but he says something tonight brother Branham said in souls in prison the prophet of God said all the ages now you see when God sent a messenger the message of the messenger becomes the blood of the Covenant for the people now when the age passes that sacrifice becomes the sacrifice of bulls and goats praise the Lord because the blood of bulls and ghosts was just a substitute so now that you have the message of the hour looter message Wesley message is just a substitute praise the Lord it was good for that age but you need the sacrifice for your age praise the Lord that's the reason why you you cannot go along with your old church ideas praise the Lord it was good for that age the Pentecostal message was good for their age it restore the gifts praise the Lord but you need the sacrifice for your age for your bae [Music] I mean there is a lot of things running to my mind now and I can preach at one hour service if you just allow me praise the Lord amen this is the sacrifice for your Bay blood that is speaking better things on your behalf those things on the tapes that's the reason why brother Branham said it would give you Rapture in faith because it's speaking on your behalf it's not speaking against you those things on the tips are not speaking against you the things that brother random said in marriage and divorce is not speaking against you is speaking on your behalf praise the Lord when the message says uh uh you know this is the way you should go about certain things it's not speaking against you it's actually speaking on your behalf just like the blood of everybody cry out of the earth that's the same with the voice of God on those tapes are speaking on your behalf thank you if you're playing a tip and brother Branham says something and it hits you it is just God's mercy to you it's not there to condemn you the reason why the devil will like to make you to feel like is condemning you because he don't want you to have access to the mercy of God this is the sacrifice if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood speaks on our behalf praise the Lord now you see the way the human mind runs [Music] if we had a a a a distribution of the blood the literal blood of Jesus Christ I'm telling you everywhere you go you're going to keep that in your purse praise the Lord before you you get in a car in the morning you will take the blood on your finger you put it on your wheel because you have electoral blood it will become so precious to you but that's how the world's supposed to be that's how the message of the hour is supposed to be that's the sacrifice for this hour that's the thing that is going to change our life [Music] I mean I was sitting there there were just a lot of things going through my mind but I think the preacher has left us on a good atmosphere let me not ruin it praise the Lord amen let me not ruin it tonight let's just stay under Thy word the mystery of redemption praise the Lord the provision that God has made to bring us back to our inheritance to bring us back to Power you love the Lord tonight you appreciate the word let's give the Lord a hint of praise thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you for speaking on our behalf tonight praise the Lord to think about it think about it amen pray for brother Michael tomorrow that the Lord will use him the Lord will give you in the Labor Day that he will be able to just bring the word but you see and I'm going to say this because he he kind of shared that with us to see that uh you know he talked about a testimony of God raising him up after an accident praise the Lord and how the Lord has has healed him miraculously from addiction is back and everything and he's holding uh the the word the talking because the doctor told him that he's having a bad heart praise the Lord now you think about that tonight think about that if a man never met his purpose and the doctor he having a doctor order is just a place where he will stay in his bed and start mourning his death and start looking for sympathy praise the Lord think about it what the purpose of God would do to your life recognizing the purpose of God will take away your excuses because some of the excuses we have they are silly they are silly they are not helping you to advance in your work with God you are making poor excuses for no reason no reason a man honor a doctor diagnosis with heart problem is preaching to you tonight he's deferring down order because he has the word that is talking foreign [Music] we start looking for some kind of for sympathy look for excuses to stay away from church therapy for people sympathy nobody Call Me Nobody sent me high [Music] if you meet God's purpose if God's purpose of redemption is revealed to you it will kick you from from off of your high horses that's what it did to Paul on the road of Damascus [Music] that's when a man found the purpose of God and when you recognize that it drives your life it gives you energy everything it gives you energy even when your body is tired it gives you energy [Music] praise the Lord [Music] you know sometimes that's the reason why you know people would think that you know uh uh the the preachers are in water because we never hear them complain we never see them you know uh no it's because there is something that is driving them there is something that is driving them and that's all you see [Music] praise
