[4:00] tuck one here at Hot Springs and one
[4:02] somewhere else and one down there and
[4:03] one there will make up literally
[4:05] millions of those that come up out of
[4:06] the ground and there's at least 500
[4:09] people every day missing the world and
[4:11] we don't even know where they went to
[4:12] see the raptures going to make up of all
[4:14] those who sleep in the dust of the earth
[4:17] that's right with God they'll say well I
[4:19] thought a raptures take place that's
[4:20] already passed and you knew it

[4:38] people were sleeping in worldliness and
[4:40] the church all in worldl and all of a
[4:42] sudden the cry come and away they went
[4:45] listen you've heard so much of the
[4:46] Christian business man the Full Gospel
[4:48] man saying oh you know Reverend Holy

[4:54] beginning to receive the Holy Ghost the
[4:56] lutherans are beginning to receive the
[4:57] Holy Ghost you sleeping bunch of people
[5:02] don't you know Jesus said when a
[5:03] sleeping virgin come to by or it was
[5:06] that very time that the brro
[5:09] come remember they did not get
[5:16] it is that right right as Booth clber
[5:19] said
[5:22] huh they might went through some
[5:24] emotions but they really didn't get it
[5:27] when they come to buy o it was too late
[5:30] [Music]
[5:31] and here they are now the Presbyterian
[5:33] the Lutheran look at that little gospel
[5:35] business man's voice and that bunch of
[5:37] Pentecostal
[5:39] grandchildren with these denominational
[5:42] Brethren thinking that that's something
[5:44] great you might ask somebody well I
[5:46] thought this it's already passed and you
[5:48] knew it not right let me stop there
[5:51] because I I'm not here to preach
[5:53] Doctrine but the
[5:55] possibilities don't you take that chance

[6:02] a possibility right now maybe not at
[6:08] 5:00 there's a possibility
[6:11] Lord I know you're
[6:14] God I know you are I'm away from you but
[6:18] I know that these fibers of mine once
[6:21] Buzz with the power of

[6:32] let your wives wear them shorts and do
[6:34] them things and that call yourself a Son
[6:36] of
[6:37] God shame on you I went to a certain
[6:41] great denominational church not long ago
[6:43] till they had a meeting and I went out
[6:45] to Vis him and the pastor take me out
[6:48] and he was going to introduce me to his
[6:50] wife she was a
[6:51] Pianist and that woman had on a dress so
[6:54] tight that the skin was almost on the
[6:56] outside she had makeup on and all kinds
[7:00] of things in her ears and I said brother
[7:04] do you mean to say that your your wife
[7:07] is a saint said yes sir I said she looks
[7:10] like a Han I said I never seen such in

[8:22] first before you make the start he know
[8:25] if his prayer was answered but he was
