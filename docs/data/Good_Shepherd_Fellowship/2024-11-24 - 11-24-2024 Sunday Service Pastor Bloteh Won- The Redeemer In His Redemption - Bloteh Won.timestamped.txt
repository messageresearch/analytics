[42:34] that's how much that's how much the
[42:37] grace of God
[42:41] uh has bound us together
[42:44] amen praise the Lord so we want to thank
[42:46] the Lord and we thank God also for uh uh
[42:52] young men back there that had that uh uh
[42:55] trouble uh and we thank the Lord for
[42:58] stepping on the scene amen and I believe
[43:02] that's the reason why God gave children
[43:04] guiding Angels because he know that we
[43:07] can't take care of them
[43:09] enough praise the Lord amen so uh that
[43:14] gu in injured is right there from the
[43:16] beginning I saw uh uh a kind of a kind
[43:19] of a scary uh uh uh video for two twins
[43:24] boys that were that were playing in the
[43:26] room and uh they were trying to climb up
[43:29] on their little cubby and the cubby came
[43:32] right down and the other one was he
[43:35] could quickly escape and the other one
[43:37] was caught under the the cabinet and I I
[43:40] mean I'm just jittering my body oh my
[43:42] God where where you know where're you
[43:44] know we're at the parents and and uh the
[43:47] other twin boy was just going around the
[43:49] cabinet trying to see how he can help
[43:51] his brother he's standing he's looking
[43:53] and he's just that little man just
[43:55] struggling on that thing and I'm saying
[43:58] oh my God and and finally he came out
[44:01] with you know he came out his brother
[44:03] you know trying to potion and I just I'm
[44:07] just saying I said surely there have to
[44:08] be a garden in J there amen because
[44:11] there is no way that that cabinet weight
[44:15] is more than the two of
[44:16] them there is no way he could push that
[44:19] over I saw another fake video a long
[44:22] time ago and uh there there was an
[44:24] earthquake and this little baby was
[44:26] playing with a toy right in the corner
[44:28] of the house the mother was in the
[44:30] kitchen and uh and I mean it was a very
[44:33] serious earthquake I can't remember the
[44:35] country but uh uh when the building came
[44:39] down the the the the the braks from the
[44:43] house hit the mother and I think she
[44:45] broke her back and and I mean she was
[44:48] flat on the ground and uh uh I know what
[44:52] I thought why why all of this coming to
[44:54] my mind but it it kind of for works well
[44:57] because uh I want to speak on a redeemer
[44:59] this morning amen I want to talk about a
[45:01] redeemer that is in his
[45:04] Redemption there is no Redemption if the
[45:07] Redeemer is not in it praise the lord we
[45:11] are we will just be having a ceremony if
[45:13] the redeem if the Redeemer is not in his
[45:15] Redemption praise the Lord I mean uh
[45:18] because he does the work he's the one
[45:21] that does the work he pay the price he
[45:23] the one that come after us we don't go
[45:26] after him praise the Lord amen I want to
[45:29] talk about a redeemer that is in his
[45:31] Redemption this morning so I mean uh uh
[45:34] in there in that in that
[45:36] video uh the the search team came and
[45:40] they wanted to know if there were still
[45:41] survivors so they drill into the earth
[45:44] into the robbers and then they put uh uh
[45:48] uh a little instrument like a like a
[45:50] microphone down in the rubber I mean the
[45:52] duck down in the rubble and and and they
[45:56] had this to their ears to see if they
[45:58] would hear people
[46:02] crying I mean this this was about over
[46:05] over 15 story building that came down by
[46:09] an earthquake and and I mean they they
[46:12] put that thing down in the earth trying
[46:14] to find out uh uh you know how if there
[46:18] were people stay there and and as they
[46:21] were listening they year people groaning
[46:23] you know out of pains and they year
[46:26] people crying you know so uh with that
[46:29] also they send a camera down there to be
[46:32] able to search because they're going to
[46:33] dig into the Earth and they don't want
[46:35] to dig these people alive so they send a
[46:38] camera down there to search down in the
[46:41] earth and see where the person was the
[46:43] beautiful thing about this brought me
[46:46] into tears I mean that night I just cry
[46:50] right into praying and say God how's
[46:52] good you are the camera will picked the
[46:55] little baby in the corner
[46:58] innocent Baby Stay
[47:02] playing mother is lying down there in
[47:06] pain and you know the the more amazing
[47:09] thing about it it was not the same day
[47:11] that did that in my mind I'm thinking
[47:14] who sustained that
[47:17] child when a mother is helpless laying
[47:20] down on the on on the on the bed crying
[47:23] out of pain and uh and and I think there
[47:26] I think there the other siblings got
[47:28] killed or something like that uh and and
[47:31] all of that but the little baby was
[47:34] unharmed because she was right in the
[47:37] corner there you know and the the the
[47:40] you know they were able to get down
[47:42] there you know dig and brought that
[47:44] little baby out and I'm I'm just
[47:46] thinking in my in my mind they have to
[47:48] be
[47:49] God they have to be God amen
[47:53] amen that sustained that child
[47:57] the same God that fair Elijah took care
[47:59] of that little
[48:01] baby and I I think he knows that we can

[1:02:33] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:02:37] your seat we want to speak this morning
[1:02:40] like I said the redeem the Redeemer in
[1:02:43] his Redemption praise the Lord the
[1:02:47] Redeemer in his Redemption brother B
[1:02:49] preach a message back that he
[1:02:51] entitled Redeemer Redemption I was
[1:02:55] listening to to that message and and
[1:02:58] then uh uh I I got this thought of the
[1:03:02] Redeemer in his
[1:03:03] Redemption so uh uh I just thought that
[1:03:06] okay maybe we can be able to share that
[1:03:09] with you but uh before we get into what
[1:03:12] we want to share with you this morning I
[1:03:14] have one quote just one quote that I
[1:03:17] will read this morning and that is out
[1:03:19] of the church age book and that's what I
[1:03:22] want to take uh uh my fellow my my
[1:03:25] exhortation from but let's go back to
[1:03:29] the scripture that we have read first
[1:03:31] let's go back to the scripture because
[1:03:34] uh you have to remember that this was
[1:03:37] Paul that said in the Bible I've seen a
[1:03:41] man uh uh whether in this body or out of
[1:03:44] this body praise the Lord he was
[1:03:47] testifying of
[1:03:49] going behind the curtain of time or
[1:03:53] going uh uh to the tear heaven
[1:03:56] but he said I saw a man you know he says
[1:03:59] whether it was in this body or it was
[1:04:01] out of this body I can't tell you know
[1:04:04] he says but there were things that were
[1:04:06] so wonderful that was where he took that
[1:04:09] state that statement from eyes have not
[1:04:11] seen ears have not heard neither have it
[1:04:14] come close to the heart of man what God
[1:04:17] has installed for them that love him
[1:04:20] praise the Lord amen that that that
[1:04:24] shows to us there is there is more
[1:04:28] reality than the reality that we
[1:04:31] behold there is more to the world that
[1:04:35] we live in and I believe those are some
[1:04:37] of the things that Paul was dabbing into
[1:04:40] when he spoke about the birth the length
[1:04:44] the depth and the height he says here
[1:04:47] again I go back to that again uh uh he's
[1:04:52] bowing his knees to our lord Jesus of
[1:04:55] home the whole Heaven and Earth the
[1:04:57] Bible says there is no name given on a
[1:05:00] heaven whereby uh we can be saved I mean
[1:05:04] God took a human name and that's the
[1:05:07] name uh Jesus uh uh but he's being Lord
[1:05:12] idona uh uh and also being Christ the
[1:05:15] anointed one uh uh which of course is
[1:05:19] what he left to be able to guide and
[1:05:21] govern his people on earth is the
[1:05:23] anointing is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:26] so he's called the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:28] praise the Lord so Paul is saying here
[1:05:31] and and and God took that name Among Us
[1:05:36] uh uh that's what the angel said to Mary
[1:05:39] but Paul is go he's making us to
[1:05:42] understand that God glorified the name
[1:05:47] in so much that God took it as his
[1:05:50] family
[1:05:51] name he took the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ as his family name couple of
[1:05:58] weeks ago we spoke about uh uh the
[1:06:02] making and the giving of names and we we
[1:06:04] show how there were many many people
[1:06:07] that you know that uh that were called
[1:06:10] Jesus Through the Scripture it was a
[1:06:12] common name I mean it was it was uh
[1:06:14] Yeshua it was Joshua you know uh many
[1:06:18] people named their children after that
[1:06:20] but yet God it pleased the Lord to also
[1:06:23] take that name it was uh it was was a
[1:06:25] name on Heaven it was an Earthly name
[1:06:28] but God will magnify that name God will
[1:06:31] exalt that name amen that every need and
[1:06:35] every tongue will bow and uh uh that
[1:06:39] that Jesus is Lord so Paul is is also
[1:06:43] being grateful here and and and showing
[1:06:46] his worship to the name of the Lord
[1:06:48] Jesus Christ and then he's he's making
[1:06:51] us to to to see here he's bringing
[1:06:53] something to the church he's says uh
[1:06:56] that he who grants you according to the
[1:06:59] riches of his glory Paul says that God
[1:07:02] who grants you that God will give to you
[1:07:05] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:07:07] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:07:12] in the Inner Man now he's talking about
[1:07:15] uh God giving us strength Beyond this
[1:07:19] flesh amen God giving us strength Beyond
[1:07:23] this flesh because you see this flesh is
[1:07:26] just a
[1:07:27] vehicle there is something that drive
[1:07:30] this flesh praise the lord it's just a
[1:07:34] vehicle when God made man we we will get
[1:07:37] to that when he make man at Genesis 1:26
[1:07:40] that's where we going this morning when
[1:07:42] he made man he made man a spirit
[1:07:46] being you were made a spirit when you
[1:07:50] leave from here you go back a spirit if
[1:07:53] we will come back to the Earth will pick
[1:07:55] up another
[1:07:57] body praise the Lord amen this is not
[1:08:01] our
[1:08:03] reality this body is not our
[1:08:08] reality it's just a
[1:08:11] vehicle so where Paul is wanting us to
[1:08:15] have strength is in our inner
[1:08:18] man amen if the inner man is
[1:08:22] strengthened you can command this body
[1:08:24] to do anything
[1:08:28] are we together amen praise the Lord you
[1:08:31] will you will you will soon you will
[1:08:33] soon see and understand why he's asking
[1:08:36] for strength uh in our inner man that
[1:08:39] Christ May dwell in Your Heart by
[1:08:42] faith that yet being rooted and grounded
[1:08:46] in
[1:08:47] love that yet being rooted and grounded
[1:08:50] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:08:54] all things to comprehend with all sin
[1:08:58] that we must be able to understand Paul
[1:09:01] is saying there is something before us
[1:09:04] there is something that is in our midst
[1:09:07] there is something that we are living in
[1:09:10] that we need to
[1:09:12] understand that we might be able to
[1:09:14] comprehend with all sins what is the
[1:09:18] breath and the length and the depth and
[1:09:21] the
[1:09:22] height that we must be able to honor
[1:09:25] understand what is
[1:09:28] that he's talking about us getting
[1:09:30] strength in our spirit man why because
[1:09:34] Paul here is dealing with
[1:09:39] Dimensions he's trying to make us to
[1:09:42] realize that we need to be able to be
[1:09:46] strengthened in our spirit man to to to
[1:09:49] see and understand the word that we live
[1:09:52] in
[1:09:55] amen praise the Lord amen to understand
[1:09:58] the word that we live
[1:10:00] in are we
[1:10:02] together glory be to
[1:10:07] God we need to understand
[1:10:11] that and to know the love of Christ
[1:10:14] which which passes knowledge that ye may
[1:10:17] be
[1:10:18] able that you might be filled with all
[1:10:22] of the fullness of God
[1:10:25] because we realize that God one time the
[1:10:29] great Elohim interal Spirit he fell all
[1:10:33] time in all
[1:10:37] space you will see you will see that
[1:10:39] Paul is talking about something far
[1:10:42] beyond our word that we live in as he
[1:10:44] closes this chapter let's read a little
[1:10:46] bit and I'm enjoying the reading
[1:10:49] amen he says uh now unto him that is
[1:10:53] able to do the exceeding and
[1:10:56] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:11:01] think praise the Lord do you realize
[1:11:05] that God can open our eyes this
[1:11:08] morning just like he did to Gaza on the
[1:11:12] mountain when Elijah said Lord open open
[1:11:16] this boy eyes let he see this morning
[1:11:20] that there is more with us than them
[1:11:22] that are against us praise the Lord
[1:11:26] hallelujah I I'm telling you if God can
[1:11:30] open our eyes this morning and I mean we
[1:11:33] can be so captur with his presence that
[1:11:36] it will be hard for us to leave this
[1:11:40] place praise the
[1:11:43] Lorden I mean God can he can he can he
[1:11:46] can take us beyond the the the three
[1:11:49] dimension that our B this B you know is
[1:11:53] is is is is is is is have a much
[1:11:56] understanding of three dimensions but he
[1:11:58] can take us beyond
[1:12:00] that praise the
[1:12:04] Lord that you will you you can even HH
[1:12:08] have an idea of when did the service
[1:12:10] started when did they
[1:12:15] end have you ever been in a service so
[1:12:17] long and you and and and you think that
[1:12:19] it was
[1:12:21] shot when you ask for the time you say
[1:12:23] oh wow I can't believe it wow
[1:12:27] why why make you to feel that
[1:12:30] way it's because your spirit went beyond
[1:12:35] the time
[1:12:37] element your spirit went beyond the time
[1:12:42] element there is more to this word there
[1:12:44] is more reality to this word in the
[1:12:46] things that we see and the things we
[1:12:49] year amen praise the Lord amen
[1:12:56] that the love of Christ which passes
[1:12:59] knowledge that ye may be filled with all
[1:13:03] the
[1:13:05] fullness now unto him that is able to do
[1:13:08] the exceeding abounding above all that
[1:13:10] we can ask or thing according to the
[1:13:13] power that worketh in
[1:13:17] us the power that work in US is a power
[1:13:21] that is beyond what we can think
[1:13:26] we have such an exceeding power that is
[1:13:30] working in Us Praise the Lord amen such
[1:13:35] an exceeding power that is far beyond
[1:13:39] all we can ask all we can think that's
[1:13:43] why Paul said in Romans we we don't even
[1:13:46] know what to pray for the spirit have to
[1:13:51] make intercession on our
[1:13:54] behalf praise the Lord because when we
[1:13:56] get to that place our mind is so
[1:14:00] limited praise the Lord our mind is so
[1:14:03] limited we we we think about all the
[1:14:06] things around us all the needs around us
[1:14:08] but yet the spirit make
[1:14:11] intercession and he brings us to the
[1:14:13] place and make requests on our behalf

[1:14:52] Redemption was before the foundation of
[1:14:55] the word amen he planned this thing
[1:14:58] before the foundation of the word that
[1:15:00] word foundation means beginning before
[1:15:04] he began the word he had his Plan of
[1:15:07] Redemption praise the Lord but you see
[1:15:10] God just did not write out his Plan of
[1:15:14] Redemption and and and left it or find
[1:15:17] someone else to come and carry it
[1:15:20] out
[1:15:22] no praise the Lord even the man that he
[1:15:25] choose throughout the ages to use as
[1:15:29] Messengers as prophets and and different
[1:15:32] he never left them to them
[1:15:34] themselves for them to be able to carry
[1:15:37] out his plan when he met Moses he said
[1:15:40] he gave Moses a vision and said build a
[1:15:43] tabernacle according to this Vision but
[1:15:46] yet he never left Moses the Bible says
[1:15:49] he came down and he gave men and women a
[1:15:53] spirit of wisdom amen for them to be
[1:15:56] able to design the
[1:15:59] Tabernacle to make the curtains to make
[1:16:02] uh you know he gave them so God never
[1:16:05] left his work of

[1:16:38] uh that's that's why we want to see this
[1:16:41] morning but let's go let's go to Genesis
[1:16:44] Genesis chapter
[1:16:45] 1 let's look at some few
[1:16:48] things uh they caught my mind this
[1:16:51] morning and I thought that I will share
[1:16:53] those things with you
[1:16:57] amen Genesis chapter 1 in the beginning
[1:16:59] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[1:17:01] the Earth was without form and vow and
[1:17:03] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:17:05] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:17:07] face of the water and God said let it be
[1:17:10] light and there was
[1:17:12] light and God saw the light and it was
[1:17:16] good he divided the light from the
[1:17:19] darkness and he called the light day the
[1:17:24] night the darkness he called night the
[1:17:26] evening and the
[1:17:27] morning were the first day now if you
[1:17:31] read this account you will
[1:17:33] realize praise the
[1:17:35] Lord you will realize that uh
[1:17:41] uh the Bible says
[1:17:46] here in verse 7 God made the
[1:17:51] fmen uh I'm I'm trying to okay in verse
[1:17:54] 4
[1:17:55] 14 in verse 14 the Bible says and God
[1:17:59] said let there be light in theen of the
[1:18:03] Heavens to divide the day from the night
[1:18:06] and let them be for signs and for
[1:18:10] seasons for days and for years you will
[1:18:15] realize here that this was when God
[1:18:19] created
[1:18:23] time praise the Lord
[1:18:25] amen
[1:18:27] amen if you look at that again the Bible
[1:18:30] says in the F he says and let and let
[1:18:34] them be for
[1:18:37] seasons for signs for days for
[1:18:42] years praise the Lord
[1:18:45] amen so for us to be able to have our
[1:18:48] calandar and know we are in winter and
[1:18:52] summer and have all of days and was
[1:18:55] right here when God placed the light in
[1:18:58] the farming and and and he divided the
[1:19:01] day from night so right here time was
[1:19:06] created praise the
[1:19:08] Lord but the question I want to ask you
[1:19:11] before time was created the Bible says
[1:19:15] back here when he said let there be
[1:19:17] light he called the light day the night
[1:19:20] he called Darkness the evening and the
[1:19:23] morning were the first
[1:19:25] day how could God have the first day
[1:19:29] before he created
[1:19:35] time praise the Lord amen I want you to
[1:19:38] to think about that a little bit amen
[1:19:42] what I want really want to do this
[1:19:43] morning is that uh I just want to I want
[1:19:47] to get there in your spirit and just and
[1:19:49] just you know turn things outside down
[1:19:54] praise the Lord Lord think about it you
[1:19:57] think about it the Bible says there in
[1:20:01] Genesis chapter
[1:20:02] 27 that uh and God made man in his h h h
[1:20:07] and he formed Man Out of the Dust and he
[1:20:11] breath into the nostril of man and Man
[1:20:13] became a living
[1:20:15] soul that was Adam's birth
[1:20:20] day
[1:20:23] amen th was Adam's birthday that was the
[1:20:26] day that he took
[1:20:28] form but yet when Adam was born Adam was
[1:20:33] 21 years

[1:21:03] says in the book of ecclesiast God made
[1:21:07] man upright he made Adam upright and he
[1:21:11] birth into the nost of Adam and Adam
[1:21:14] became a living Soul Brother Bram says
[1:21:17] his toes were stuck in the earth like
[1:21:19] Roots When the Breath of Life got into
[1:21:22] his body he had to shake his foot out of
[1:21:24] the Earth
[1:21:25] to start
[1:21:28] running but then when he was
[1:21:31] made on his birthday he was
[1:21:37] 21 praise the
[1:21:41] Lord amen you see that's that's what
[1:21:45] that's what prove that even in Divine
[1:21:48] Healing if God will give a man a brand
[1:21:51] new heart or give a man a brand new
[1:21:54] organs of the body God can create an
[1:21:57] organ that will capture where your
[1:22:02] age if a person is 35 years old and God
[1:22:06] will give them an organ God will create
[1:22:09] an organ that will be 35 years old to be
[1:22:13] able to meet with your
[1:22:22] body praise the Lord
[1:22:26] are you understanding what I'm saying
[1:22:28] you see because the the the the the the
[1:22:32] the thing about it is that we need to

[1:22:43] that we live
[1:22:45] in science is talking about all of these
[1:22:49] years now they've been telling us about

[1:29:27] amen the Bible says there is God talking
[1:29:31] to a people that he had just brought out
[1:29:34] of
[1:29:35] Egypt a people that is rebelling against
[1:29:39] him in the wilderness and he's telling
[1:29:42] them love the Lord with all your
[1:29:47] heart and all your
[1:29:49] mind and all your soul amen amen praise
[1:29:54] praise the Lord what is that have we
[1:29:56] ever taught what what actually that
[1:30:02] is how can we love God with all of our
[1:30:05] heart how how are we ever able to get to
[1:30:10] this place that is the thing that Baff
[1:30:12] me when I went back and start looking at
[1:30:13] that scripture God is talking to a
[1:30:16] rebellious people he said these people
[1:30:18] are stiff neck these are the very people
[1:30:20] he wanted to eliminate of the earth and
[1:30:23] Moses had to stand in the
[1:30:25] Gap and he's telling these people love
[1:30:28] the Lord with all of your heart I think
[1:30:31] God knows
[1:30:32] better praise the Lord that these people
[1:30:35] all that is on their mind is the garlic
[1:30:38] in
[1:30:40] Egypt praise the
[1:30:43] Lord somebody said that's what I don't
[1:30:46] like
[1:30:50] garlic because that's all they wanted
[1:30:53] and
[1:30:56] anyway I love
[1:30:58] GC and I love the Lord amen I love the
[1:31:02] Lord more than garlic Amen Let me see it
[1:31:04] that way praise the Lord people quick to
[1:31:07] go from church with Doctrine we
[1:31:09] shouldn't like garlic because they
[1:31:10] wanted garlic that's not what I'm
[1:31:12] preaching I love garlic but I love the
[1:31:15] Lord more than garlic praise the
[1:31:18] Lord amen now so what but here say God
[1:31:22] is talking to these people people and
[1:31:24] then when you really come down to it and
[1:31:27] you look at the the uh the atonement of
[1:31:30] the human body you look at the human
[1:31:32] body you realize that actually that
[1:31:35] compartment that God was referring to is
[1:31:38] not the compartment that your blood
[1:31:40] pumps out
[1:31:41] of God was referring to something that
[1:31:45] you hold something that is your
[1:31:49] makeup that you don't have control over
[1:31:54] you have
[1:31:55] it you have a spirit where part of your
[1:31:58] body is your
[1:32:00] spirit where part of your body is your
[1:32:03] spirit residing you have a soul where
[1:32:07] part of your body your soul is residing
[1:32:09] re re I mean resident in your body
[1:32:12] brother talks about that little
[1:32:14] compartment under the heart you know
[1:32:15] where blood have not pped the prophet of
[1:32:17] God giving giving us an
[1:32:20] idea because if you really take it and
[1:32:22] you go down to that little compartment
[1:32:24] can you open it and get your soul
[1:32:28] out can you tell the doctor say doctor
[1:32:31] you know there's a little compartment
[1:32:32] the prophet of God said let me read a
[1:32:34] quote here to you the prophet of God
[1:32:35] said there's a little compartment in my
[1:32:37] heart that no blood is uh goes there
[1:32:40] that's where my soul I want you to
[1:32:42] operate on me this morning and get a
[1:32:44] hold of my
[1:32:45] soul can you do that no you can't do
[1:32:50] it you can do it
[1:32:54] even love the Lord with your heart is
[1:32:57] not what is beating in your chest here
[1:33:00] that's what Paul is referring to Here
[1:33:02] There is a dimension About
[1:33:05] You Even in our physical body amen we
[1:33:10] have a trinity of ourself a body a
[1:33:14] spirit and a
[1:33:15] soul praise the
[1:33:19] Lord so we have we have this Dimension
[1:33:22] there is something that is around you
[1:33:24] there is something that is of your
[1:33:27] makeup that is more real amen than this
[1:33:32] body there is something about you that
[1:33:35] don't
[1:33:36] age there is something about you that
[1:33:38] don't age there is something about you
[1:33:41] that don't get
[1:33:42] tired you have it it's in
[1:33:47] you amen that's why we can say the body
[1:33:50] is weak but the spirit is willing the
[1:33:52] body is weak there is something about
[1:33:54] you that can't get tired there is
[1:33:56] something about you that don't get
[1:33:59] sick Hallelujah your body gets sick but
[1:34:02] there is something in you that you just
[1:34:04] want to get
[1:34:05] up because that thing that want to get
[1:34:08] out of bed is not sick this body is sick
[1:34:11] but that thing is not sick whatever it
[1:34:14] is you call it whatever you want to call
[1:34:17] it but I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:34:19] there is more reality to
[1:34:22] you Hallelujah amen than this thing you
[1:34:25] are looking
[1:34:30] at oh
[1:34:32] my praise the
[1:34:35] Lord
[1:34:37] hallelujah love the Lord with all of
[1:34:39] your heart then the Bible comes back
[1:34:42] again and say the heart of man is
[1:34:44] desperate Wicked how can you love God
[1:34:47] With A desperate Wicked heart how
[1:34:54] how how can
[1:34:57] we but yet we love the Lord amen you
[1:35:00] love the Lord this morning you you love
[1:35:03] the Lord this morning praise the Lord if
[1:35:05] you love the Lord let's give him a hand
[1:35:06] of
[1:35:13] Praise
[1:35:16] Hallelujah do you see why you love the
[1:35:20] Lord yet there are things in your own
[1:35:22] very life that you are not pleased
[1:35:26] with Lord praise the Lord amen
[1:35:30] amen and you see the lack of the
[1:35:34] understanding of those things throughout
[1:35:35] the ages that's what make the age to
[1:35:38] always live onor his
[1:35:41] privilege why because the people were
[1:35:44] the they were they were trying to
[1:35:47] qualify their Earthly lifel stand up
[1:35:50] with what God is doing in their life
[1:35:53] praise the
[1:35:56] Lord if they go down to the market and
[1:36:00] and they made a mistake they come back
[1:36:02] you know they have to do Penance walk on
[1:36:04] breaking glasses share their own blood
[1:36:06] knock their head against the wall and
[1:36:08] they say oh God how how could I do this
[1:36:12] how Lord how could I do this if if you
[1:36:14] are really in me I would not do
[1:36:20] this praise the Lord
[1:36:25] if you read church history and tell
[1:36:27] church history you will realize some of
[1:36:30] some of the atrocities some of the
[1:36:33] things men committed suicide in good
[1:36:37] faith because they wanted to please God
[1:36:40] they wanted to stop thinking
[1:36:45] evil praise the Lord
[1:36:48] right and they could not stop thinking
[1:36:52] evil so the best way they thought they
[1:36:55] can please God is so just take their own
[1:36:59] lives what was happening it was because
[1:37:02] the mystery of understanding their
[1:37:04] reality was not
[1:37:06] revealed this message brings the mystery
[1:37:10] of understanding your
[1:37:15] reality that's why God sent a prophet
[1:37:18] what did the angel of the Lord told him
[1:37:20] I'm sent from the presence of the Lord
[1:37:22] to tell you about what your mysterious
[1:37:26] life I will tell you about the
[1:37:31] reality of yourself that you don't
[1:37:40] understand
[1:37:44] hallelujah praise the Lord

[1:40:53] before you realize
[1:40:55] that their minds have been this virgin
[1:40:58] exposed to
[1:41:02] things and some of those things they are
[1:41:04] trying to ask themselves in their mind
[1:41:08] they say why my body is feeling this
[1:41:11] way and sometimes un known to their
[1:41:13] parents they are exercising their body
[1:41:16] to be able to understand why their body
[1:41:20] is feeling the way they were feeling
[1:41:23] couple of years back I never felt like
[1:41:27] this I never thought of this but before
[1:41:31] you

[1:44:45] brother BR said in the message come
[1:44:47] follow me he says uh uh uh he says most
[1:44:52] conversion that that is done to Christ
[1:44:54] he say it is
[1:44:57] done he say it is done mostly under the
[1:45:00] age of
[1:45:03] 21 it say most conversion that is done
[1:45:06] to
[1:45:09] Christ it's not the fact that God don't
[1:45:12] save people after that age but what
[1:45:14] brother Brandon was trying to bring is
[1:45:17] there uh after 21 we are in another
[1:45:20] cycle we are in another change of our
[1:45:23] our life he says when people grow up to
[1:45:25] be older they get so so strong in their
[1:45:30] ways they have they have buil a very
[1:45:33] strong character and because of all of
[1:45:36] life experience that sometime the
[1:45:39] reality of God God will have to do
[1:45:42] something
[1:45:45] Supernatural praise the Lord amen I'll
[1:45:49] just I'll just listening to the message
[1:45:51] I'm all over my my myself today but it's
[1:45:53] wonderful I was just listening to the
[1:45:55] message uh path of Life brother Bram
[1:45:57] read that scripture he will show me the
[1:45:59] path of Life uh uh uh I woke up in the
[1:46:02] morning I remember the day and and after
[1:46:05] praying I I had that scripture on my
[1:46:07] mind so I went through the Bible and I
[1:46:10] and I read through all where the Bible
[1:46:12] was talking the path of life because I
[1:46:15] was thinking on what we are talking
[1:46:17] about and and and actually it has to do
[1:46:21] with a dimension there there's a path
[1:46:24] that that the same
[1:46:28] God that make signs only discover the
[1:46:31] path in the
[1:46:32] air for them to call a
[1:46:36] airplane
[1:46:40] route praise the Lord there's a path in
[1:46:43] the sea David talks about
[1:46:50] it and there was a there was a US Navy
[1:46:54] officer a Christian boy I've shared that
[1:46:56] with you before that read that
[1:47:00] scripture and it trigger him for him to
[1:47:02] go instead to draw the map that ships
[1:47:06] travel on the
[1:47:08] sea so in the US Academy the the the the
[1:47:13] they name there after him because he
[1:47:16] came up with that and where did he took
[1:47:18] it from because the Bible said there's a
[1:47:20] path in the sea
[1:47:24] praise the
[1:47:26] Lord God told Moses why cry why why you
[1:47:29] crying to me if God brought them down to
[1:47:33] that place God knew that there was a
[1:47:35] route for them to go he pull a route
[1:47:38] there that's why he said why cry speak
[1:47:42] and go
[1:47:44] forward but what do our reality does our
[1:47:47] reality say there is water I don't see
[1:47:49] no

[1:47:53] limited the human our human being our
[1:47:56] assisting element say there is water I
[1:47:58] don't see no Road that's why Moses was
[1:48:00] crying oh God what we are doing now the
[1:48:02] mountain is here the mountain the
[1:48:04] Egyptians are behind us God said why cry
[1:48:06] to me why are you
[1:48:08] crying just go

[1:48:13] Joshua learned better when he got to
[1:48:15] Jordan he never needed to cry he just
[1:48:18] told the Levi you get the presence of
[1:48:19] God you go in the water he made way back
[1:48:22] there he will make way
[1:48:30] again praise the Lord so thinking about

[1:48:40] a
[1:48:41] reality amen you see science is breaking

[1:57:28] amall what am I preaching this morning
[1:57:31] it looks like I'm all over the
[1:57:34] place praise the Lord you know but you
[1:57:37] see I got so caught up in Paul talking
[1:57:40] about
[1:57:41] Dimensions he talks about the dimensions
[1:57:44] that we live in the dimensions that we
[1:57:47] live in the the thing about Dimensions
[1:57:50] that we don't understand is that that
[1:57:52] Dimensions is all about
[1:57:56] reality amen praise the Lord amen it's
[1:57:59] all about reality
[1:58:01] amen this three dimensions that we live
[1:58:06] in Praise the
[1:58:14] Lord what is our three
[1:58:18] dimensions space time it
[1:58:20] matter everything think
[1:58:24] everything
[1:58:25] everything it's hard for me to convince
[1:58:28] you this
[1:58:29] morning that I don't have a
[1:58:34] poopet why because you can see
[1:58:37] it praise the lord it's hard for me to
[1:58:40] convince you that you we don't have a
[1:58:44] poopet so dimenions goes to
[1:58:49] reality it goes to reality
[1:58:52] because
[1:58:55] because you can see this poopit to you
[1:58:59] is
[1:59:00] real amen amen there is no way you can
[1:59:03] say that we might we might we might
[1:59:06] differ with the color maybe I'm color
[1:59:10] blind praise the Lord I can say right
[1:59:13] now I'm standing at this white poopit
[1:59:15] and you say no what is he talking
[1:59:18] about we might def about the
[1:59:21] color but in our
[1:59:23] reality your mind can say that there I I
[1:59:26] can see it there's a cross on it it had
[1:59:28] two wings I mean I I don't know what he
[1:59:31] was talking about but there was a poopet
[1:59:33] there praise the Lord and that is the
[1:59:36] same way our faith declar that he is
[1:59:41] here amen it's not a slogan if we are
[1:59:46] only saying it as a slogan we are
[1:59:48] deceiving
[1:59:50] ourself praise the Lord but our faith
[1:59:54] must be
[1:59:55] able to create a vision that makes him
[1:59:58] real we know that he's in our midst yes
[2:00:02] Lord amen praise the Lord what what what
[2:00:06] makes him real Faith brings that
[2:00:10] reality amen faith in his words says
[2:00:14] wheresoever two or three I gather in my
[2:00:16] name I will be there and because we
[2:00:19] believe that word the reality grabs us
[2:00:23] that we are in God's
[2:00:26] presence praise the
[2:00:28] Lord
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:32] hallelujah that's Dimension here is Paul
[2:00:35] saying he said 14 years ago I know a man
[2:00:39] he's talking about
[2:00:41] himself but this reality hit him so
[2:00:45] hard being a Jew being a
[2:00:50] Pharisees that he will
[2:00:55] experience leaving his body and entering
[2:00:57] into a dimension and I mean they are
[2:01:00] taught the Torah they they they they are
[2:01:03] confined to the
[2:01:04] Torah but Paul had an experience that
[2:01:07] took him beyond the
[2:01:09] Torah that make God real to him he had
[2:01:13] an experience that make him to
[2:01:15] experience the same thing that Moses
[2:01:17] experienced on the backside of the
[2:01:19] desert
[2:01:22] Paul could say I see why when he came
[2:01:25] there was so much glory on his face that
[2:01:28] the people could not behold his
[2:01:30] face what was that Moses has entered
[2:01:35] into a
[2:01:38] reality he has entered into a more
[2:01:42] reality praise the Lord and I believe
[2:01:45] that's where the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:48] is our reality must not be the for
[2:01:50] corner of these walls when we just come
[2:01:53] to church no praise the Lord if God is
[2:01:57] real to us and and I mean the promise of
[2:02:00] God the promise of the hour is real to
[2:02:02] us I mean that's why the prophet of God
[2:02:04] said we can't we will not wait for those
[2:02:05] doors to open
[2:02:08] amen because we want to get in there and
[2:02:11] be able to experience what each and
[2:02:13] every one of us bring to the table we
[2:02:16] bring the lake of Lake of Fire we bring
[2:02:20] our experiences our a and our shout our
[2:02:23] hand

[2:02:38] Redeemer is in his
[2:02:42] Redemption amen he's in his Redemption
[2:02:47] glory be to
[2:02:49] God the Bible began
[2:02:52] with in the beginning
[2:02:54] God that how it begins in the beginning
[2:03:00] God so the very Plan of Redemption
[2:03:03] begins with
[2:03:05] God it does not begin with what church
[2:03:07] you goes
[2:03:08] to what family you from no it begins
[2:03:12] with
[2:03:14] God and the Plan of Redemption ends with
[2:03:18] God because it is his plan amen it is
[2:03:22] his
[2:03:24] program
[2:03:26] Hallelujah it was God that came and says
[2:03:29] Adam Adam where are you it was not Adam
[2:03:32] and saying oh God I have lost you oh God
[2:03:35] where are you no it was God going after
[2:03:39] [Music]
[2:03:41] him praise the Lord if God would leave
[2:03:44] it to us we will make a mess out of
[2:03:49] Faith amen we will make a mess out of it
[2:03:52] we will mess our own life we will mess
[2:03:54] everybody around
[2:03:56] us but God don't leave the Plan of
[2:03:59] Redemption he don't leave your salvation
[2:04:03] he don't leave the things that concern
[2:04:05] you to anybody your health thing he
[2:04:08] don't leave it to Medical signs because
[2:04:11] he's the Lord that Health all our
[2:04:17] diseases praise the Lord let's read this
[2:04:20] together this is the the one and only
[2:04:22] quote I had to read to
[2:04:25] you thank you for helping me preach this
[2:04:27] morning amen
[2:04:31] amen these things said this is from the
[2:04:33] laia church
[2:04:35] age these things said the faithful and
[2:04:38] Truth witness now I want to show you
[2:04:41] what I
[2:04:43] find in the thought of faithful but I'm
[2:04:46] talking about the faithful and true
[2:04:48] witness he said when we talk about
[2:04:50] faithful let me show
[2:04:52] you what faithfulness
[2:04:55] is praise the Lord amen
[2:05:01] amen you know we often talk about a
[2:05:04] great unchanging God whose word does not
[2:05:06] change and when we speak of him after
[2:05:10] that manner we often get a view of him
[2:05:14] that makes him seems very
[2:05:18] impersonal
[2:05:20] amen we talk about God do not
[2:05:23] change but we we normally get a view
[2:05:26] that makes him impersonal why because
[2:05:30] when we talk about a God that do not
[2:05:32] change we leave him back in
[2:05:36] history we leave him in history and
[2:05:39] because we leave him in history so yeah
[2:05:42] he's not personal he's not
[2:05:46] real praise the Lord but if he was if
[2:05:50] the Redeemer was in his his Redemption
[2:05:52] there he's in his Redemption
[2:05:56] today are we together let's continue to
[2:06:01] read he says we often get a view of him
[2:06:04] that makes him very impersonal it is as
[2:06:08] though God made the whole universe and
[2:06:10] all the laws that pertain to it and then
[2:06:15] stood back and become a great impersonal
[2:06:18] God
[2:06:21] when we are going through trials when we
[2:06:25] are going through tough times in our
[2:06:27] life and dealing with things that we
[2:06:29] don't understand is so easy for us to
[2:06:33] feel like
[2:06:35] de praise the lord it's so
[2:06:39] easy he was the
[2:06:42] god the Fourth Man In The
[2:06:45] Fire is he in my
[2:06:48] fire praise the Lord amen he was the god
[2:06:52] that came down in the Lion's Den is he
[2:06:56] in my Lion's
[2:06:58] Den but I'm here to tell you this
[2:07:00] morning the Redeemer he's in his work of
[2:07:05] redemption praise the Lord he's in
[2:07:11] it it looks like God just made the
[2:07:14] entire universe and people says where is
[2:07:16] God there is war in in in in Ukraine
[2:07:18] there is war in the Middle East you're
[2:07:20] talking about God where is God
[2:07:22] God praise the Lord
[2:07:30] amen we know that God is there he's real
[2:07:33] why why why why makes us get that faith
[2:07:37] that he's real that he had not just left
[2:07:39] these things to run themselves why
[2:07:41] because his word said it
[2:07:43] am amen his word declared it
[2:07:47] am praise the Lord he told us it's going
[2:07:51] to be like
[2:07:55] that if we are not just filling our
[2:07:58] minds with with with with everything and
[2:08:00] and we're looking at how things are
[2:08:02] playing out I mean the last time I spoke
[2:08:04] on the Redemption money and I told you a
[2:08:05] little bit about uh uh you know the the
[2:08:08] the the the international market and and
[2:08:11] all of those things the Rival on
[2:08:13] disappreciate the US is what causing all
[2:08:16] of those things dis appreciating the US
[2:08:19] dollars because if Russia and China and
[2:08:23] North Kore Korea can be able to
[2:08:25] influence other people to get away from
[2:08:27] the US
[2:08:29] dollar it breaks the the the US economy
[2:08:32] and it affects the rest of the world
[2:08:38] right there are a lot of things that is
[2:08:40] behind our reality
[2:08:43] [Music]
[2:08:45] people our politicians don't know uh uh
[2:08:48] their reality they don't know their
[2:08:50] reality
[2:08:53] we can't depend on them because they
[2:08:54] don't know their
[2:08:56] reality this word is this Bible is more
[2:09:00] real than you and myself sitting in this
[2:09:02] building this
[2:09:04] morning there are a lot of things that
[2:09:06] are behind our
[2:09:07] reality we are just looking from the
[2:09:09] surface and sometimes we think we
[2:09:14] know sometimes we think we
[2:09:19] know even with with think things that we
[2:09:22] we we battle with in our mind and habits
[2:09:24] that we struggle with in our lives and
[2:09:26] things that is happening you know what
[2:09:29] there is lot of things behind those
[2:09:31] realities demon powers that is trying to
[2:09:33] make the word of God of non effect in
[2:09:36] your
[2:09:38] life if the devil can just give you the
[2:09:41] comfort of coming to
[2:09:43] church and make God a a historical God
[2:09:47] that's all he wants
[2:09:52] praise the Lord there is more to that
[2:09:59] amen but we have a redeemer that is
[2:10:03] faithful in truth amen everything he
[2:10:05] have said he will do it that's the
[2:10:08] reason why every morning he gave us a
[2:10:10] brand new Mercy he gave us a new Mercy
[2:10:13] because he want to he want to start a
[2:10:15] new work with us he want to bring us to
[2:10:17] New Reality let's not live in the past
[2:10:20] let's come to every new
[2:10:24] reality amen amen Our Redeemer is
[2:10:27] faithful in
[2:10:29] truth let's read this that's the only
[2:10:32] quote I have so I read it and then we we
[2:10:34] Fellowship around and we close amen you
[2:10:37] love the Lord amen and when we speak of
[2:10:39] this these things after this manner we
[2:10:41] often get a view of him that makes him
[2:10:44] seems in personal as though God made the
[2:10:48] whole universe and all the laws that
[2:10:50] pertain to it and then he stood back and
[2:10:52] became a very impersonal God it is as
[2:10:56] though God made the way to Salvation for
[2:10:59] lost
[2:11:01] mankind that way being the cross and
[2:11:05] then when the death of Christ was atoned
[2:11:08] for our sin in his resurrection gave us
[2:11:12] an open door to him God just F his arm
[2:11:16] and stood back and say well I paid the
[2:11:18] price
[2:11:19] already I've gave my life for y y like
[2:11:22] it y can choose it or not Redemption was
[2:11:25] not our
[2:11:26] plan Redemption was his
[2:11:30] plan amen like I said to you the last
[2:11:33] time salvation is an individual Affair
[2:11:36] it's not your Affair you are not the
[2:11:38] individual he is the individual it is
[2:11:41] his affair he thought about it from the
[2:11:44] beginning he choose you before there was
[2:11:47] a
[2:11:48] word he's now folding his hands praise
[2:11:51] the Lord because he said all that the
[2:11:54] father has given me all that the father
[2:11:57] has given me he says I will not lose
[2:12:01] one praise the Lord if he will not lose
[2:12:04] one then he's in the Redemption business
[2:12:10] amen he didn't just die on the cross
[2:12:13] resurrected and just for his hands and
[2:12:14] say okay let me see what you would do if
[2:12:16] you have done my
[2:12:18] part praise the Lord if he didn't call
[2:12:21] you will not
[2:12:23] come praise the Lord if he did not call
[2:12:26] you will not come you must start from
[2:12:30] there praise the Lord and then if you
[2:12:33] have come ask him what you call me
[2:12:37] for amen
[2:12:40] amen are we together if he did not call
[2:12:44] you will not come he watch over you full
[2:12:48] generation to make sure that you sit
[2:12:50] down on
[2:12:51] salvation for you to hear the word of
[2:12:54] God the Gospel of Jesus Christ he watch
[2:12:57] over you full
[2:12:58] generation that's how much he's
[2:13:00] concerned that's how much he's
[2:13:08] involved every religion have an
[2:13:11] idol praise the Lord amen every religion
[2:13:16] has an
[2:13:18] idol and many of them they made their
[2:13:20] own Idol
[2:13:22] and their Idol is just
[2:13:24] there praise the Lord you see and and
[2:13:27] and that's the way we try to make
[2:13:30] God that's the way we try to make him we
[2:13:34] think we can slam this door go behind
[2:13:36] this door and do something he will not
[2:13:38] see us because we left him in
[2:13:41] church Jesus praise the Lord he knows
[2:13:44] our very thought he knows the intents of
[2:13:48] our heart
[2:13:51] and the Bible says all of our ways are
[2:13:53] naked in his
[2:13:57] eyes are we together amen that's how
[2:14:01] much God is involved people that is how
[2:14:05] much he's
[2:14:11] involved he's not just sitting down on
[2:14:13] his throne okay I will judge these
[2:14:15] people let me see what they have done
[2:14:17] I'm waiting for them to come here I will
[2:14:18] judge them
[2:14:21] that's the kind of a god denomination
[2:14:23] gives to us that is the kind of a God
[2:14:26] that religion has given to
[2:14:29] us but the god that we serve this
[2:14:32] morning he's a present tense God he's a
[2:14:36] god that is real he's a god that is
[2:14:38] involved in our
[2:14:41] Affair praise the Lord that's why the
[2:14:44] prophet of God will tell you when you
[2:14:45] are stopped in traffic don't get too mad
[2:14:48] maybe God is keeping you from something
[2:14:50] from some kind of
[2:14:53] danger start hitting the
[2:14:55] wheel and being angry just thank the
[2:14:58] Lord Lord thank you I mean your angels
[2:15:01] are in charge I don't know what's going
[2:15:03] on maybe you are keeping me from some
[2:15:04] kind of a
[2:15:05] danger because God is
[2:15:08] involved he's in
[2:15:14] charge he's not an impers impersonal God
[2:15:17] I just set there for his hands and said
[2:15:19] let me see what they will do
[2:15:24] praise the Lord he have made us and now
[2:15:28] we
[2:15:28] ourself that's what the Simon said he
[2:15:32] have made us and now we
[2:15:35] ourself let's Fellowship here as we
[2:15:37] bring this to a close
[2:15:39] amen it is as though God made a word of
[2:15:43] salvation for lost
[2:15:44] men th that way being the cross and then
[2:15:49] when the death of Christ was atoned for
[2:15:52] our sin and his his uh his resurrection
[2:15:56] gave us an open door God just F his arm
[2:15:59] and he sto back it is as if we major in
[2:16:05] believing in a great Creator who having
[2:16:09] created lost personal interest in his
[2:16:14] creation that's what the a years want to
[2:16:16] tell us that's why they don't believe
[2:16:19] that there is God
[2:16:21] if there is God while we have all of
[2:16:23] this trouble right praise the
[2:16:28] Lord if there is God what what what my
[2:16:31] life is going through all of
[2:16:34] this he want to create that question and
[2:16:37] create that question in our mind what is
[2:16:40] he after killing the effect in your
[2:16:44] heart you will just be a b in church but
[2:16:48] you have no interest of taking go God at
[2:16:51] his word you have no interest of taking
[2:16:55] God
[2:16:57] instruction that's the reason why this
[2:16:59] age is just to the place where the
[2:17:02] people want to be
[2:17:03] entertained just confront them with the
[2:17:05] word they get they get the gets uh uh

[2:18:36] again but yet you can tell him about
[2:18:40] your
[2:18:41] life and sometimes he gets into the
[2:18:44] personal things about

[2:24:20] said that as how too many people are
[2:24:24] able to
[2:24:27] think but that is that is wrong
[2:24:32] thinking for God is govering in the

[2:24:40] governing in our
[2:24:43] Affairs praise the
[2:24:46] Lord he's govering in our affairs
[2:24:51] if you have get close to the Lord a
[2:24:54] little bit and you are sensitive of his
[2:24:57] presence sometimes you know when an
[2:25:00] angel wakes you up in the morning you
[2:25:03] will know because it's different it's
[2:25:08] effortless amen and sometimes you wake

[2:25:31] absent from this realm of
[2:25:34] Life praise the
[2:25:37] Lord and don't even know what is
[2:25:40] happening when you lie
[2:25:42] down do you know that when you lie down

[2:25:49] the body of
[2:25:52] Moses there are evil powers and evil
[2:25:55] spirits trying to possess your
[2:25:58] body but just like how almighty God
[2:26:01] Genesis chapter 15 he was watching over
[2:26:03] the sacrifice when Abraham F asleep he
[2:26:07] was the one keeping the sacrifice he's

[2:27:28] this glorious calling and just left us
[2:27:30] to

[2:34:39] Sun sometime he would do he would do
[2:34:42] things in the creation that will catch
[2:34:45] our attention
[2:34:50] because he had not left it to
[2:34:52] us you know this great
[2:34:55] God our work in the work of
[2:35:00] redemption when I think about
[2:35:05] Jesus being 10 11 years old and going to
[2:35:10] the Cal
[2:35:12] shop and Joseph would teach him how to
[2:35:16] take a Harmon on the nail you have to to
[2:35:19] hold it like this no you don't you don't
[2:35:21] do it you knock your finger you have to
[2:35:23] hold it like this this is the way you
[2:35:25] hold your Harmon and Joseph will teach
[2:35:27] him that's what Redemption is when the
[2:35:31] father call you it's not for you to do
[2:35:33] the
[2:35:37] work it's not for you to do the work
[2:35:40] he's only holding your
[2:35:43] hands he want that
[2:35:47] relationship sometime we complain and
[2:35:50] I've been doing this I've been doing
[2:35:51] this I've been doing
[2:35:53] it maybe that's what is not working
[2:35:56] because you've been doing
[2:36:02] it the father to take his
[2:36:05] hands and yet God
[2:36:08] Almighty standing right there and Joseph
[2:36:10] is teaching him how to put a ham on on
[2:36:13] the
[2:36:16] nail Joseph is teaching him how to S
[2:36:21] and everything that is going through his
[2:36:23] mind this is the Redeemer in his
[2:36:29] Redemption that's all that is going
[2:36:31] through his mind that the father came
[2:36:34] down on man and said be me a tabernacle
[2:36:38] according to the vision that I've given
[2:36:40] you it was now for Moses to do it all by
[2:36:44] himself but God came
[2:36:46] down and he started Distributing the
[2:36:49] spirit of
[2:36:50] wisdom and start giving people uh H H
[2:36:55] skills for them to make
[2:36:58] curtains is the Redeemer in his
[2:37:01] Redemption holding our hands and
[2:37:04] teaching us how to knock a hammer on a
[2:37:09] nail praise the
[2:37:13] Lord just like a mother holding the
[2:37:16] daughter hand and teaching her how to
[2:37:17] stir in the pot
[2:37:22] that's how almighty God is to you and
[2:37:25] myself amen we not serving the buy
[2:37:29] God no that just stand there and fold
[2:37:32] hand say let me see what do
[2:37:36] it if you look through scripture I'll

[2:37:55] Lord there's no service till Wednesday
[2:37:58] why not preach till tomorrow but let me
[2:37:59] leave this with you it's a subject that
[2:38:02] we will talk about if you look through
[2:38:04] the
[2:38:05] Bible the Bible brings us the character
[2:38:09] of two
[2:38:12] sons it's
[2:38:15] either an adopted
[2:38:18] son or
[2:38:20] a bastard
[2:38:23] son two sons throughout all the
[2:38:28] scripture that was what was reflected in
[2:38:30] the
[2:38:31] twins King and
[2:38:34] Abel one son will come to
[2:38:37] adoption the other son will be bastard
[2:38:49] and when the Redeemer comes in his
[2:38:54] Redemption he's looking for the son that
[2:38:57] is
[2:38:59] interested in the father's
[2:39:02] business praise the
[2:39:06] Lord the one he can teach how to put a
[2:39:08] hammer on the nail no matter how many
[2:39:12] mistakes he make but he has a heart that
[2:39:15] is willing to be
[2:39:18] taught but there is one that have no
[2:39:21] time to be around that was what Esau was
[2:39:25] Esau had no time to be
[2:39:29] around he wanted to be out there he was
[2:39:32] out all the he was out never had no time
[2:39:35] to be
[2:39:36] around two
[2:39:39] sons we'll talk about it it's a subject
[2:39:42] I want to bring to you you know my
[2:39:44] subject is not just one day amen take
[2:39:47] months to talk about it but I want you
[2:39:49] to think about
[2:39:51] it and with the Redeemer in his
[2:39:55] Redemption what he's looking for is that
[2:39:58] son and that
[2:40:01] daughter that is interested when he came
[2:40:04] down to to uh Mary house what did he
[2:40:07] said Mar you are too incumber about
[2:40:15] things that what he said he said but
[2:40:18] Mary has has
[2:40:20] choosen the best
[2:40:23] thing because she's giving herself time
[2:40:26] to sit and
[2:40:30] listing two
[2:40:32] sons you can run it
[2:40:36] everywhere when a redeemer comes down in
[2:40:38] his
[2:40:40] Redemption he's looking for that
[2:40:46] son like he can show how to solve a math
[2:40:49] problem problem he's looking for that
[2:40:51] son you can show how to put a toy car
[2:40:56] together that's what Redemption is all
[2:40:58] about it's not laws rules don't do this
[2:41:01] don't do that it's
[2:41:04] relationship is the Redeemer the
