tonight we greet you all once again in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you musicians praise the Lord amen Hallelujah we know when God shuts the window when he shuts the heaven his judgment amen so if we can think that the windows of Heaven are open tonight then we shall believe that uh His blessings are with us amen because when God opened the windows of Heaven he pulled manner down uh uh for his children and he took care of them through the Wilderness he met their niece it was a sound that the windows were the windows of heaven was open Amen in the dead of Elijah he shot the heavens amen that there was no rain for three years and six months until the Prophet Elijah called for it so we want to be glad we can say the windows of Heaven are open because we believe that every time we come in his presence you will be able to pull manner down from heaven he will be able to give us something of internal value that uh that that will become of comfort and strength to us let's take our Bibles tonight we will go to the Book of Genesis on Sunday we were speaking on uh on the subject the the restore call equality is is a part of uh like I said a part of a message that uh how to speak on the the the condescending of God so what I was standing on that on that message uh that would be Genesis chapter 32 tonight praise the Lord let me try to see if I can get there before you because I'm always calling the wrong thing huh now we want to read a little bit of there with Jacob uh his his razzling match with the angel that's what we want to read tonight because that is one place in the scripture where the Bible use the phrase that they are uh uh for our Supremes they'll have power with God the phrase power with God because we were looking at Power Wave and power over Power Wave and power over that's why we were looking at on on Sunday so uh as we will look into the scripture verse 24 and Jacob was left alone and their Riser and man with him until the breaking of the day praise the Lord and when he saw that he prevailing that against him he touched the hollow of his tie and the hollow of Jacob died was out of joint as he riseled with him and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will net Jacob said I will not let thee go except thou bless me praise the Lord amen is there someone here that want to get a hold of the Angel tonight amen praise the Lord I mean you got to be determined it will not just take a mental reasoning to to get you to that place you know it has to take a lot of determination I will not let it go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob by Israel for us a prince have their power with God and with men and have prevailed and Jacob asks him and said tell me and I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore it is that thou Dost acts after my name and he blessed him there amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 6. now in Ephesians chapter 6 our Paul is now going to put us in our own opposition to be able to experience the same thing that that Jacob experienced Ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse 10 finally my brethrough is being strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wells of the devil for We rise on that against flesh and blood but against principalities against power against the rulers of Darkness of this word against spiritual weakness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that yea may be able to withstand in the evil days greater battle ever fought brother Branham say in this day amen when he read the scripture he says this is the evil day praise the Lord uh that Year may be able to withstand in the evil days and having done all to stand stand there for having your learns guilt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your future with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shared of Faith well with ye will be able to quench the fairy dots of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the swore of the spirit which is the word of God praise the Lord praying always that is the that is the seven uh uh armor yet that uh and this one is uh is uh it's not a visible arm of Praise the Lord all the other ones Paul took a visible element to represent them but this seven one praying always with all prayers and supplication in the spirit and watching they're on tour with all perseverance in supplication for All Saints may the Lord our blessings to the reading of his word you may have your seat tonight praise the Lord amen so well just like I said we were talking about the the bride called equality restore Power Wave versus power over and that we were trying to show that uh that when God made man in the beginning and he gave man dominion over the Earth uh Adam was uh the Son of God he was an amateur God over the Earth So Adam position as the Son of God he was sharing power with God praise the Lord amen with with with with Adam God have power with Adam over the Earth and God have power over the Earth he gave adam dominion over the Earth and that so we realized that under the first Covenant when God made man and and brought the uh you know both male and female they were co-equal so Adam have power with Eve he never have power over he because they were called equal he have power with Eve now we're brought the changing of the Covenant was the form when men fell then now now power was now exercised over uh there that God made that coveting and that he would have the root over you now it's it's strange enough you know I mean uh strangely we we living in such a dying and uh sometimes we try to bring you know uh the the way that we we understand things the way that words are used and express and understand in uh in the world we try to sometimes apply it to spiritual things or scriptural things and because most of the time you know when people talks about this sense of power you know uh uh the local strength and and uh uh the local right the local Authority and and all of that but what we were trying to show on Sunday is that uh uh through our our new birth through the Lord Jesus Christ like Paul expressed there that how God had made us joined hearers with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we might also be glorified with him so being made John Heroes with Christ through the death of our Lord Jesus Christ everything that Adam lost lost was restored and one of the things that Adam lost was his co-equalness praise the Lord he lost that because no no no more that he had dominion over the the animals anymore praise the Lord and uh so he lost that he lost that core equality and now we realized that's that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost has restored to the Believers that's why Jesus says you shall receive power amen their power that we did receive was power with God and power over sin amen power over sin power over the world now so uh uh uh looking at that thought of uh uh Power with God and our power wave and power over I was actually the uh going to go in that direction but while looking at the subject I got drawn into into this and I just pray that the Lord will bless it as we Fellowship together tonight and also seeing the other uh we have the services coming up this weekend with brother Brooks uh he said he'll be coming with his wife so we will be we'll be glad to see brother Brooks as being a wife praise the Lord so I think he should be here on Friday if uh if everything Remains the Same so uh Saturday at 7 pm 7 30 service will start and then also Sunday morning so we are all welcome praise the Lord and then next week Wednesday we will not have service because of the Thanksgiving and then we will see ourselves on the weekend praise the Lord pray for me and I should be having some meetings on that weekend of Thanksgiving our brother delay and myself will be will be speaking on the convention in the UK so just pray for me that the Lord will will just be able to to help us give us a straining his leadership praise the Lord so uh I was then I was looking at that as I said Power with God I was I was thinking on the thought and then my mind tried to draw back a little bit to some some few things that brought Brandon said how did Jacob came to that place to have power with God praise the Lord amen we know for the believer uh you know by by grace that's what is given to us uh by our birth Jesus uh said that in Saint John as many as receiving to them he have given power to become sons of God praise Lord so uh we we realized that uh it is it is something more than the natural man can think you know when the natural man thinks about power he look at his strength he look at his ability you look at his muscles and and and different things but realizing that what God is giving to the to the believer restoring us to the place of where we're supposed to be as Sons and Daughters of God praise the Lord so this power with God and like the scripture says here even with Jacob the scriptures his power with God and also with men I was I was really something here and uh in the bridge brother Branham also expressed it a little bit yeah he says he says John wept because no one could do it Revelation chapter 5 and everything was lost and there came a voice from one of the others standing in the midst of the four beasts and all that that great host of Heaven praise the Lord said don't weep John all mine the grace of God don't don't be broken-hearted John don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah the root and The Offspring of David he has prevailed praise the Lord he says Prevail means to rise away and overcome praise the Lord all mine in the Garden of Gethsemane when his blood dripped down out of his face he was overcoming so we we realized that uh uh uh this morning uh Before the Throne of God is telling John weep net because one uh uh the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed and yeah brother Branham now is associating there with what took place in the Garden of Gethsemane amen so he's showing that Jesus all through that night when he was you know he was he was submitting his will surrounding himself to uh to to the father not my will but your will be done uh brother Branham is associating the same experience that Jacob had wrestling with God he's as he's associating there now with our lord Jesus praise the Lord so Jesus was in his own rosly match he asked the disciple can you you pray with me one hour and every time he left him he came back he met them sleeping he was there the Bible says he prayed and he wept in agony until the sweat from his face was as thick as blood not only the swear the tears from his eyes I mean he was crying just just surrounding himself so I'm trying to say this so we can kind of forget the picture because you see yeah I remember some some uh one time ago I was I was I was talking with uh I think with a with a Muslim guy one time uh uh I think true brother John Bibi we had we had a conversation with with one uh Muslim scholar somewhere here in Brooklyn Center and then he brought this scripture he sees uh he says I mean how how can you say it in the Bible that that Jacob razor with God and his side to say that many many even many Christians as they read this portion of the Bible they just they just take it in their little sins in that common sense as safe to say God was you know playing in the dirt with Jacob praise the Lord sure as if it was just some kind of for you know uh uh uh uh playing game but we realized that as as we look into the subject tonight we'll realize that that that is that is more than that amen that is more than that the scripture says here they're the uh uh Jacob met a man which of course we believe that uh you know that that was that was a body just like when God visited Abraham he created a body and stepped in it praise the Lord Hallelujah but before I go I go uh any father I will I would like to come back again to uh to uh the uh the inspiration on Sunday for us to realize here that uh you know one of the one of the reason uh just like I said I was looking at the the God condescending the way that he have condescended you have a step out of Eternity and to calm down and and be born by a virgin take on fledge and all of the things that he had to go through and like brother Branham shared a man fell from the place that God put him God made him in the image of God and he fell from there so God had to become man to be able to bring us back to that image praise the Lord now so uh having this thought in mind as we travel this way what I want for us to realize uh because brother branham's here we are in a spiritual Kingdom he called it the Masonic Kingdom that's what the church is the Church of the Living God is a mystical body praise the Lord it is not just we here as as a body and we have a name that we give the church Good Shepherd we we see uh ourselves you know we come in on Wednesday then on Sunday the way we address the where I mean the the vehicle we drive and we talk to one another uh some we know some we don't know and all of that but we realize that the Church of the Living God they are more Supernatural elements that make this body praise the Lord then just us here this Wednesday night praise the Lord amen and uh I mean even with the ones that are streaming into the service I mean we get down and we prayed and everybody prayed and we called upon the name of the Lord you know we lift our voices to God we realize that uh uh there is there is more just like uh uh take for example the uh Elijah and his seven praise the Lord uh he could only see he and the prophet and realizing that uh the army or the syrians were coming he could hear the cherish sign he could hear the noise but then Elijah had to ask for God to open his eyes amen for him to be able to see that there were more with them than them that were coming against them praise the Lord it is in that same sense I'm trying to say tonight that there is more with us praise the Lord there is more with us when God gave gave a promise and God called call his people and he's leading his people he equipped his people praise the Lord he's not depending on our physical strength all our physical ability he's depending on his promises amen God is able to come behind his word to be able to back his word uh praise the Lord halleluia if he promised us signs and wonders to be able to move in our men is he is able to come behind his word and to be able to back his word or praise the Lord just like how he did with the people in the wilderness traveling 40 years there they never had no shopping center to go but because he called them because he gave them his word his word was able to preserve them now that was what Moses said in Deuteronomy chapter 8 Jesus used the same statement men shall not live but bread alone in another sense it was not the bread from Heaven that the ate it was not the manner you know that sustaining them but it was the word of God praise the Lord so as long as God had his word in the midst of the people it was enough to be able to take care of the clothes that they were wearing to be able to take care of their shoes that word was enough to be able to preserve their body praise the Lord amen the word was enough to keep them healthy just imagine they have babies in the wilderness they never have maternity Center and and but the world was able to take care of them oh I believe children children fail some broke their legs some God's sake but the word India mess was enough to be able to take care of them are we together praise the Lord so we realize that their shout of the king is still in the camp amen and then we also look at this principle when we spoke about the five kingdoms how uh uh we look we talk about the five kingdoms and we realize that how the plain Kingdom how to reach down to uh the mineral Kingdom praise the Lord if the mineral Kingdom ever wanted to come from Another Earth to come on top of the earth and how immediate the help of the plain Kingdom to stretch its roots down in the Earth to be able to draw all those minerals from out of the Earth praise the Lord amen that is the way that the the the the minerals can can be able to transform into a plant by the roots of the plane reaching down now so uh it's it's all of this uh is all of this principle Jesus said if I be lifted up I would draw praise the Lord I would draw all men unto me so you see in God's mind he was not this God I want that one to be distanced from his people praise the Lord neither God I just want us to come to church to come and meet him that's the reason why in Exodus chapter 19 he told the people if you would keep my word I will make you a kingdom of priests God desire is to have his uh uh uh his children around him like brother Brown I mean in a uh uh question answered in Genesis when he talks he says uh let's let's just take a trip he says I see the logos and I see all the children of God right out at the throne you know they're all around the Throne of God praise the Lord so he's not this God that wants to be distanced away from us the prophet of God also said in the in the church age book he says uh many people think that God just created the word and just left left us here then he packed himself somewhere else and that he's very impersonal I mean we have to come to church and beg him God yeah our prayer please Lord we need you praise the Lord amen you realize on my camera when uh when when Elijah told the prophets of God to pray it and call on their God and they were praying and yelling and and and and and cutting themselves and and you know expressing all their emotion Elijah said maybe he have gone on vacation you got to yell more that's that's not our God praise the Lord that's not our God Hallelujah he said if I be lifted up I would draw him amen meaning that I will bring you closer my presence will be felt he want to move in and out of our mess he want to be seen amen praise the Lord he want to be heard and he also hear our voice and hear our prayers praise the Lord you see how how uh what what what the religion of the word and and and and denominational has done he has put a barrier between us and God and and still keeping the the the the veil that was rent in the temple trying to make us to believe that uh the one that we are coming to worship he's so far away and and I mean we have to do this thing I mean we we have to go on a 21 day fast to really bring God down in our midst when he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you praise the Lord Hallelujah now so uh uh that's the reason why God has to restore this uh equality he has to bring bring us back to the place that's the reason why the the Mistress of God was revealed that's the reason why the seals were open for us to realize that we are serving a god that is in our midst praise the Lord and just like I said you know when God make man in Genesis chapter 1 he make man male and female the scripture said created he them but then we realized that God first put the took the masculine spirit and then put it in a body of Flesh now so you realize that that order of sequence is uh is is the author that is referred to in the scripture when the Bible says and and the man was made first before the woman man is before the woman and all of that it is not the it's not the place of of uh uh is just a place of sequence which means in expression God expressed the man first praise the Lord and like the prophet said in invisible Union then he held the woman back because of redemption and then he expressed her taking her out of the rape of Adam just because of redemption so you see it was never in God's mind to have one of his child ruling over the other one praise the Lord because the reason why he manifested us the prophet of God said it was because of Fellowship praise the Lord how are we going to have Fellowship when we are when we are distance amen we are destined by either class or group or by title there is no way that God will have a a a perfect fellowship with his children if you have make Adam anything lesser than himself that's the reason why he had to make Man In His Image because what he wanted was Fellowship praise the Lord amen he wanted Adam to be able to experience everything that was in him that's the reason why when he brought Adam forth I mean he was not he was not using him with a remote control he had a liberty to call the planes whatever name he called him name the animals whatever name he gave him and whatever name he gave them the father was pleased with it that's Fellowship are you are you grabbing the Saints praise the Lord because that's that's that is exactly what the Holy Ghost must do in the life of the children of God that's why we cannot use our position or our offices as a great place of authority to think there you see that's that's the reason why uh uh uh the spirit of uh uh Nickelodeon destroyed the church in the beginning because the fellowship that God wanted among his children when that Spirit came what it did it separated the clergy from the people right praise the Lord so whenever that sense of Separation come you cannot have True Fellowship are we together praise the Lord so we realize here that uh uh character is a victory it's not a gift and a man with High character can't Reign because powered apart from that is satanic that is an outstanding uh quote a quote that has that has stood out in the message why it takes power with character to root now so when we go back to this whole uh uh Jacob thing yeah let's let's just take a quote here from Brother Branham and uh and we'll be able to find a place here but Branham says putting on the the whole armor of God he says the Bible says that we don't rather with uh tall holes flesh and blood but we rise up against spiritual powers now if uh you did only realize it as I said a while ago as I said a while ago we we are raising with him now and and you are not going to die you are already dead see but our spirit is alive in him so we are not razzling against Natural scientific things we are razzling against spiritual power praise the Lord you know razzler the practice on uh breaking toe holes and things but you don't break those Thor hole no you could uh could you imagine a wrestler come out now mine with his fingernails polish and and Trunks all with all kinds of a gold base around like that now but I'm talking about is someone coming out to a physical wrestling match you know well I mean he has to practice he has to prepare himself now so what where I want to go with with this thought tonight is that um we know that Jacob being uh uh you know a deceiver struggling with uh with a nature in him but there was something in Jacob that that was longing for the birthright praise the Lord and uh uh and he was able to get the breath right even though he got the breath right and he got the blessing also but there was just something that was in him that he needed to put at rest praise the Lord Hallelujah he knew his mama I have called him and she told him what the angel told her that night that older one would save the younger one and honor that inspiration she dressed uh Jacob to go and get the blessing and all of this thing was done right and he was gathered this word he was guarded that way he was guided to go to the house of Lebanon and all of that we see all of the but in Jacob there was just something in him that needed to come to rest praise the Lord amen and I believe that that was that was why that wrestling match was important I believe that was the reason why Jacob needed to meet that angel or meet that man whatever it was which of course we believe that it is God because it is only God that can port at rest whatever we are razzling with in our mind in our spirit only God can put it at rest can you imagine what an almighty God did when that angel of the Lord came that night to brother Branham in a cave and says I'm an angel sent from the presence of God to tell you why he went to the cave in the first place because he was wrestling with something in him praise the Lord he having all of these dreams and then and he even started praying for people before he met the angel he was having Vision before he met the angel but yet there was something inside that needed to be put at rest praise the Lord Hallelujah and you see that God will now put that arrest the devil will always use that to make you feel that you are just playing religion you are not a son of God you see you did this yesterday you see you did that yesterday and that's the reason why we need to meet the angel oh my God we need to get their account set up are we together but I'm talking a little bit of that here let me see if I can if I can be able to pick up this now let me continue in here he says you know erasler will never come up with uh his fingernails or polished and you know having bees all around him look like a pretty good wrestler but that's only intellectual if he hasn't got a hidden strength there that's when the enemy gets gets a tall hold on him there he can pull him out his intellectual base around him and everything don't make don't make much different so all of our intellectual means nothing if there isn't a hidden power of the Holy Ghost there to break the hold of the devil but when we are in a rously match we are rising that we find dresses intellectual psychology but we are wrestling with the power and the promise of God which can break any whole on any devil at any time praise the Lord now I want I want us to go back to that again let's read that again praise the Lord because pretty soon we will understand just like I said you know when uh it was not just uh uh uh playing in the dark game God was trying to settle something in Joseph I mean in Jacob he was trying to put arrest his fears the fear that he always had that he would be lost praise the Lord amen you can just just imagine uh uh all of the things that he had there with cheating his brother on the on the breath right he has always washed his back that Isa will come after him and then when he got a blessing again he always washes back that's why he had to run out of the house so there was there was this element of fear there was there was this shadow that was hanging over Joseph I mean Jacob sorry it was a kind of a shadow of fear praise the Lord when he went over again to to 11 house and uh and and and he cheated him on the on having Rachel and he had to marry uh uh Leah the fear came up again in the back of his mind if I worked this other seven years is he going to cheat me again so you see there were there is a fear element that will always around his faith now you have to remember he met he met the angel the vision of of uh of of Jacob ladder before he went over to leban house and the angel spoke with him I will be with you I will guide you I will protect he heard the word of God but there was just this element of fear that was around his faith all the time anytime little thing Springs up he goes back to that sense of fear he has to look for ways to protect himself praise the Lord now the angel already told him I will be with you he never needed to cheat it I mean to cheat 11 to be blessed God always already told him I will bless you but you see why why was he stayed in that attitude of trying to hustle why was he still trying to hustle to make his way it's because there was that element of fear praise the Lord I know God will bless me but I I mean I have to do something amen I have to do something you hear this kind of a statement you know uh Heaven help those who help themselves it's a it's a it's the gospel of fear amen it's the gospel of fear it's not in the word of God God only help us because we cannot help ourselves so let's go back to that again let's let's read it read a portion of that quote again see what Brother Brad I'm saying here he says that a man never comes down first he goes back he says uh [Music] um we are not razzling against Natural uh scientific things we're razzling against spiritual power spiritual power something that I would say that came by our natural birth something that came from the form that is always seems to be like a shadow that is haunting our lives is always in the back of our mind oh yeah we know that God is with us who believe that the angels of the Lord and income about us but sometimes we still have a sense of fear looks like something is haunting us let's let's travel a little bit then he talks down here and says uh uh that's what he talks about a man going to fight and he cannot go with uh you know his pretty fingernail polish and you know bees around his neck and all of that he said you cannot do that if he hasn't got a hating strength there that's when the enemy gets a tall hold on him that can pull him out his intellectual Beast around his neck or around him and and everything don't make much a difference so all our intellectual means praise the Lord our knowledge of the message our knowledge about God and uh you know when and everything yes they are all wonderful praise the Lord but there is something more than there that we need we need a heading strength praise the Lord a strength that when our knowledge when we cannot make sense of things around us something that we keep holding us amen something that will keep holding us inside is that hidden strength that we need praise the Lord so our intellectual means nothing if there is if there is a sin there if there isn't a hidden power of the Holy Ghost to break the hold of the devil but we are in a razzling match razzling net with fine dresses of intellectual psychology but we are razzling with the power and the promise of God praise the Lord amen now you see it's very important for us to realize there because uh uh in a way that the religious word or the way that people will imagine this thinking you know the person getting down and and says well you know I'm razzling with God I'm claiming my blessings and everything now brother Branham is trying to make us to realize here that we can only rise their way the promise of God we have because God is obligated to his word amen God is not just coming because we are expressing all our fears and all the you know uh uh uh uh trying to look for his sympathy so you will realize that the hidden strength of the believer is the word and that is the thing that God wants to see in his children because this power that we have with him it is not uh uh like a physical strength it is not seen in our muscles or in our in our intellect the power we have with God is seen in his promises as a child of God as son or a daughter of God being identified with God in his word amen because heaven and earth will pass away but the word of God will never pass away how much that God is expecting us for our confidence in his promises to rise to such a level that when he said I will never leave you never forsake you no matter what we are going through we know that he's there with us praise the Lord praise the Lord okay let's let's take this code over in on changing God what a way to meet God in a razzling match but it was God regardless of whether he's in the burning bush or in in a wrestling match it was God and the main thing was that Jacob he had a dream and a vision and so forth but this was one thing he could lay his hands on something and and say it is God even though he had all of this wonderful religious wonderful blessings he have vision he had a dream but he needed something that he can lay his hands on and say this is God when every other thing we filled around him he will know that this thing praise the Lord Hallelujah because he could feel it just like Paul says I bear in my body the mark of God something that he can all talk he can point on and say that this is God yes he's now only talking about uh uh uh uh you know a reason or or an honest thing I was reading and yeah and and this talk just came to me but something that he can hold amen praise the Lord he had dreams he had vision and so forth but this was one thing he could lay his hands on something and said it is God and he was able to hold on to it until the blessings come praise the Lord and now what I'm supposed to be amen and now what I ought to be I know that I'm now what I used to be praise the Lord amen but she had an experience amen that she was holding on until what she was supposed to be were coming View are we together and he was able to hold on to it until the blessing come and we could do that if we could find a spot to where we could see God whether it is in this world whether whether it is and recognize recognize it's it's God and hold on to it until the blessing come rise out with God promise to do it praise the Lord amen now you see that was that was worth Jacob needed to get told to be able to get back with power with God he needed to get to the place where he has loose confidence in his ability to lie and cheat all his strength all his physical strength was gone praise the Lord he said God dramatize it in such a way you just think about wrestling all through the night I I don't know about you I just I just need 30 minutes I will be a Wipeout amen so God placed it in a in a way for us to be to for us to be able to understand a man or the woman coming to the place where we have exhausted all our physical strength oh our physical ability praise the Lord because if Jacob was holding on to that man or holding on to thy Angel bless me and trying to clean blessing in every way all through the night he had asked for financial blessing he asked for children blessing bless me with a car bless me with a house he have exhausted everything and all he needed was just a touch of the angel all he needed was just a different walk praise the Lord amen We rise on that against flesh and blood but we wrestle against spiritual wickedness in high places especially in the time that we are living in and everything that is going on in the day where the word of God is just Twisted in every way praise the Lord and come up with our own reasoning and you know while we see something in in you know in the message and the prophet said this but you see there is that place where God will bring an individual with her praise the Lord that we will not be relying on what we read or what we understand we'll be relying on hidden strength that is inside praise the Lord a hidden strength that God has been able to give a son or being able to give a daughter when they don't have an answer they can stay whole to God's word praise the Lord Hallelujah I believe that is the place where we have power with God our power with God is not how much we can be able to exercise power over another person but how much we can be able to bring ourselves in in in submission to God's word how much we can be able to wait on the Lord how much we can be able to trust God and believe that he stayed a provider he's still a Healer he stayed a deliverer how much we can trust God not to take things in our life and just and just attribute it to ourselves that's that's my weakness as if to say God don't have power to deliver you from that I believe that's worth our core equality with power with God comes it is not how much we can argue use the word to argue about how much like our lord Jesus right there wrestling With God all night it was Lord not my will but your will be done praise the Lord why he gained power with God we realize because brother Brown says right there you know why uh the spirit of God left him because that body was going to be crucified amen when he turned uh uh uh multiply the bread he never had to think about it he had all about power the enemy just fully lifted up bless it and he was able to feel 5 000 people but right there in the Garden of Gethsemane he was left alone now own about the disciples but even by the father praise the Lord right there in the Garden of Gethsemane he fell was something fell when he shake his head and praise the Lord when he shake his head and there was no strength he never had no Inner Strength the thing that would make him to live up the gates and beat the Philistines I left him praise the Lord and There Our Lord was in that state he was forsaken God my God why have that forsaken me but constantly constantly he was bringing himself to that place not my will Lord praise the Lord that was word the system elements that deity was dwelling in knew what it is when he left Adam praise the Lord he knows what it is when the Son of God or the daughter of God trying to serve God and really don't have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and it comes to that Showdown where we are put on a one trial or one temptation he knows what you go through praise the Lord amen because because For the First Time for the first time he will experience being in the body without deity praise the Lord even at the time he was there when they were calling illegitimate child and and every all the way that the the Pharisees and they were treating him he could stay there because deity was in that body praise the Lord but the first time that he was experienced being separated being just left to assist in element body with other presence of of God he knows what it is when we get to our tight corner when we are left alone praise the Lord when it's almost like you feel like you want to throw the towel in knows exactly what that feeling is praise the Lord amen I would just say that in a sense of expression when Jesus said you must be born again he had deity in him but that night in Gethsemane he realized how much the Holy Ghost was important praise the Lord that's that's the picture what I'm trying to bring to to us tonight if we should rise up with God that's the place he want us to get her you want us to get to the place word even though the the the the the that that that what I call the the restore equality that power is he's been given to the church by the Holy Ghost through his promise of the Holy Ghost you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come unto you but you see for many it is just it is just an intellectual thing yeah praise the Lord for many it's just an intellectual we we just take it to the fact that we have we we are staying in church I mean I come to church every every Wednesday I come to church every Sunday that's beautiful praise the Lord but we need that we need that hidden strength when you are real honor a mind battle when nobody sees what goes on in your mind you need our Inner Strength praise the Lord amen brother Brown says that he says the decision of the whole world lies on his shoulder the prophet of God said and he had right to turn it down he had the right you see so God bringing us back to that place that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what the message of the hour has come to restore back to us not just to give us a sense of uh of of of religion or the sense of understanding the word of God but God wants to restore in his people and ain't no strength something to hold us in these dark days that we are living in praise the Lord amen and to see the grace that we have to be able to worship God and and serve God let us not take it yeah I mean let us let make the best views that we can when we come to the house of God let's let's put ourselves into the world let's Worship the Lord if there is anything the enemy trying to use to to to battle your mind try to cast it away put yourself into the world put yourself into the worship try to break away from it because just like how Jacob had a haunting fear it comes with our fallen nature when things are happening around us we get we get afraid let a child starts doing something you get a friend and that child is going to to be lost that something start happening in our home you see you get a you get a friend as if I'm going to lose my home or I'm going to lose my child or or this time or are we going to lose this brother or the sister all of those things happen we always have those constant fear that keeps haunting our mind and as long as we we we we we we we stay in this body we will always have it it's a it's a sense that came with the fall God hath not given us the spirit of fear that spirit of fear came with with our fallen nature it haunts us praise the Lord but to realize that there is a hating strength amen that's a heading strength and it's in you as many as I received him he had given them power is in you it's always there brother Baron said it's lying dormant we need the atmosphere of his presence praise the Lord that's the reason why we need to come into the atmosphere of his presence when the word of God said for sick not the assembling of the sins because as we Fellowship together it revived that strength within us we we gain strength we gain courage that's the reason why sometimes you can come to church so discouraged but let the worship starts going on praise the Lord let the singing start going on let our atmosphere is being created you don't know where the strength comes from you start Clapping Your Head it's in you amen greater is he that is in you and he that is in the word the strength that you need to overcome it does not comes from anywhere else it's already in you it have been deposited in you by your birth you don't need a 21 base fast to have it you don't need to go on a hunger strike praise the Lord it's already in you foreign [Music] amen John in first John chapter one he says uh let me read that and close musicians you can come tonight praise the Lord your faith is stronger than your fears Hallelujah your faith is stronger than your doubt John says first John 5 1 5 this then is a message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is Lighting in him and him is no Darkness at all he talks about uh no let me drop back again to verse three that's what I want to read that wish we have seen and I've heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us for truly our fellowship is with the father and with Christ he says so John was referring to the word that has been revealed the word that has been opened in the beginning was the word this was the same John that said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the world became flesh he we handle it we got into that Fellowship he said we want to bring you also into that Fellowship what it is is God's children fellowshipping around the logos because the logos is that light [Music] so God don't want us to be distance away from him [Music] God don't have special class of children that must only enjoy a privilege of close relationship and the other ones don't have a no if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you have every right [Music] you have every right to lay in the boson of the father you have every right to come close praise the Lord you have every right that's why we don't have no sin of bench here now all you I mean you are a weak believer you need to be in the back the one that is falling from Grace is the one that must even come closer is the one that the father wants to lift up and draw to his bosom [Music] praise the Lord he's a person of God he's he's real he's I mean uh he just he just he won all of his children to enjoy every benefit whether it is healing it is forgiveness it is Deliverance he wants us to enjoy it we must get out of them that that that church member mindset when you are out of that mindset you don't have no favorite preacher the word of God is your favorite preacher amen every time the word of God sounds whether it is on the tip or is from the back of the pulpit you are ready to enjoy the world you are ready to lift your head you are ready to jump into fellowship with God you don't have to follow the emotion of the preacher to be happy what you want you want the word the word I will be able to open the father to you a word that will bring encouragement that will bring strength to you a word that you can identify yourself with [Music] thank you he has given us power with him Jacob was able to have power with God and also with man praise the Lord there is the old scenes that said this one time he says amen or a woman that is able to kneel before God as a child will be before their father you are able to stand before any man praise the Lord if you can live before God not just me in your room as a need be for God pour your heart before God you know you are in the presence of your father you are talking to your maker you can stand before any man praise the Lord for how I'm looking for God to be able to raise us up you see when when that thing is breaking more on us Church it will change the way we worship it will change the way we respond to the word we will not be listening to the world like the spectators we will be worshiping the word as we are listening to the word we will be receiving the world we will be rejoicing in a word who will be embracing the word let's stand to our feet tonight give me the heart like that oh come to my soul God to my soul blessed Jesus my Lord me oh savior open the fountain a place [Music] The Fountain and Christmas [Music] oh yes come to my soul blessed Jesus [Music] oh savior [Music] Lord Jesus Christ [Music] yes Lord God to my soul blessed Jesus my Lord [Music] give me yeah the scriptures say if one is overtaking in a thought he that restored that one praise the Lord see what what what actually it is what it is you are drawing you are bringing that one to to an equal stand with you that's the reason why when when Abraham went out and fought for lot the king of sword and wanted to get his gifts he said I don't want your gifts praise the Lord he said I don't want your gifts [Music] I may get into that place where we understand that God is raising his children up no matter what we go through the through the dead or go through the weak as the Son of God as a daughter of God it must not be the things happening around us that should determine that I mean that I detector us how we should worship God I ain't no strength knowing that we have a father that will never forsake us never leave us he's always there with us but you see things his body that's what brother Branham call it the curtain of time is holding us back from that reality because that power is in you tonight the power to create another word and go live in it is in you tonight foreign [Music] you tonight the power for you to walk down to the hospital and lay your hand upon a sick and pray for that sake it's in you tonight you don't need a seven day five before it will come down it's already in you it's in You by birth the power to live right is in you tonight the power to become an overcomer is in you tonight [Music] Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given to me that's why he says when you are faced with your mother don't even think what you were saying in that very hour the father will Empower you sometimes we make it so complicated we try to process things through our mind what would I be able to say to this to this friend of mine or how would I be able to test somebody about Jesus it's all in your mind we are just so caught up in our mind foreign just let go and let God have his way just surrender to the word of God surrender to his will that the world may know your songs [Music] oh yes that you said oh God no that was great Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just want to thank you tonight oh God almighty God I pray
