has done for us praise be to God so feel at home there are no visitors in the house of God God knew you before there was a world we maybe see you for the first time and hopefully this wouldn't be the last but God knew you before there was a world praise be to God now brother Hilary if you can help me sing this song I know when I'm over there I do I do very well [Applause] because when I'm singing

drive [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] my [Music] thank you delicious you can please take your seats before I forget but one sends his greetings he is doing very well in Liberia I spoke with him I think three days ago but the joy I spoke with him yesterday and he conveys his greatness he is there physically but spiritually he's here yes so yes by him in prayer originally his planning he was planning to come back live Liberia on the third but when I spoke with him he probably will be living on the 11th but he has up until tomorrow to determine that according to the conversation I had with him praise be to God so bang him up in prayer yes so by the grace of God today there is something I have here which we are going to look at but before then why I sank we I made us to sing this song last two three weeks when brother Scott was ministering he made mention of a gentleman I think the song was well he had to go he went through a lot he had to he lost his business empire lost his children and it was in that process that that him came out and when he was sharing it with the church and as our see today listening to him this song just came to mind and this was a song actually it was first written as a poem but yourself screaming now this was a German and Irish German who after his university education went back to his hometown in the Oscars of Dublin and he was going to marry his childhood sweetheart and a date to the wedding they agreed to meet at the banks of a river and then this lady took her horse was just going down and when she got to the banks of the river according to the story the horse scuttled and then threw her over and then she fell headfirst in the river went unconscious and then got drowned so here comes the man who was willing to take her hand in marriage I'll let you see that her sweetheart had just got him drowned just a day to their wedding and as they were pulling her out of the water he saw her face and according to the story he said it looked like it seemed like the bottom of his world had just disappeared life was never the same and everywhere in Ireland while he looked he saw nothing but that day that never happened that day that never came he waited for it prayed for it rejoice to see it but that day never came so he decided to leave Ireland and then he went to Canada he was living in a town called Port Hope in Ontario and he devoted his life to help the widows the poor and the sick and this he did very well because he by the nickname the Good Samaritan of Port Hope that he was just helping people so much so one day he was walking along the road holding his soul and then somebody said oh this is just upcoming and another person said oh I need somebody to sew my wood for me so I will pay them I think I asked for his services and the person told him that no you can't get his services he only provides his services to those who cannot pay but you have money to pay he would not give you his services he devoted his life just for the service of the Lord and then in 1954 almost 11 years after the first incident he saw another beautiful lady now in Canada who wanted to marry her and a week to the marriage she took ill and died of pneumonia and again he was so so so crushed but every single moment he turned to the Lord every single moment he turned to the Lord that never took him away from God it brought him closer to God now when he first wrote this as I said he wrote it as up for him to his mother and to think of such a beautiful song that was written in 1855 now we sing it and it's like it was just written yesterday so inspired a timeless song to think of such a song coming through tragedies in a man's life the Bible says that his ways are past finding out there is no way you can understand God it's mind-blowing now whatever it is that you may be going through never think you had the first fessing people may have gone through it before you and after you people who still go through it you will not be the first and you'll not be the last people are going through things for the love of Christ what a friend we have in Jesus he is a friend when friends are around and when friends decide to leave you alone he is still a friend that can be trusted he is a friend in good times and a friend in bad times he is a friend when we are on top and he is a friend when you are down he's her friend when you are in the light and when you are cutting the darkness and everybody forgets of you he's still a friend he still comes looking for you praise be to God and when you have come to the end of life and friends and religions and loved ones have carried you and they are bidding you farewell and goodbye he is still there to see you true praise be to God what a friend we have any Jesus if you can't give your life to Christ and live a godly life do the will of God walk apprentice organize then there is something wrong seriously we are living in a day I mean the end is just here the grace of God is here the Bible says where sin abounds grace abounds and even more sin has abound that tells you that Grace has abound and even more there is more of grace to know than you have ever known if you don't give your life to Christ you have no excuse on that day you have no excuse whatsoever because people have gone through Westing's and they live to please God what would be your skip on that day praise be to God this brings me to my topic for the day can we please stand and take our Bibles look 9:23 something brother can you please check in there I left my glasses yes the ice are messed up so need something to help me see I guess don't know why I see very far I don't only see that yes when you are close praise be to God yes that's an irony god bless you look nine 23 I read and he said to them all that is Jesus speaking if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me praise be to God shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank this so much old God for this opportunity we've had once again father all God to draw closer we are so grateful Lord that you have preserved our lives and have preserved our souls even unto this day we are so grateful dear Lord Jesus that you can get us together as a hen goddess is young ones old God and to speak to us in a language that we would understand we are so very much grateful that the Lord our God is our life and you'll rain even in the affairs of men where Frank killed Jesus for your goodness for your grace your love and your mercy we worship the father and we bless you for the old God in Jesus name father we have come with various knees on our house and we are looking up on today we are trusting in your sovereign grace old-guard to minister unto us from lip to ear further just search me aside nobody has come here to look at me father and let your word both of order the power and the anointing of Laurel spirit may you diello Jesus touch every light touch every soul and quicken your weight father old God even into our souls Lord there are many of us that have guided father this morning would never leave your presence the same granted onto us father we pray thee in the name of Jesus father brother Scott is not here today this new me is not here and of course where the one is not here um brother Wesley is his Carol are not here with us father we lifted them all before you this morning wherever they are father old God keep them by your mighty right hand and order the shadow of their mighty wings Oh God may you dear Lord Jesus do with them in any way that would bring glory and honor and praise on today a new holy name and let not the enemy ever cash in on their lives in any way former ship in the name of Jesus we pray and we thank you so much old God that you have had an address this morning amen shall we be seated I title this message take up your cross take up your cross and as we just read the Bible says if any man will come after me let him take up his cross daily deny himself and follow me take up your cross If any man if now the word if is a conditional clause anyway the word if it's used it says a hypothetical analysis of events if in other ways you are not compelled to it is not a do-or-die affair like is some other religions they'll put a knife in your truth and they will ask you to accept your fate else they're going to take your head off Christ didn't want that he doesn't want his children to serve him in fear he was a love relationship if God should compel us to serve Him who is going to do otherwise there is nothing you can do better serve him but right from the beginning it was not so and it will not be so in the end we are free moral agents in other ways you can choose to serve God and you can choose not to it is your decision whether you want to serve God or not if bird is God save him if he is no god bird I don't need your sympathy 500 something you don't believe it is not going to help you if God is God save him and if you think he's the bird you have your way remember the way of men is the way of death so Jesus wants a love relationship so he is not compelling in a man nobody has ever been compared if if in other ways you can choose what you want to do there was a story about one slave girl that a rich man was passing by and then he looked at his slave girl and he loved her she was tied to the sticks and he went to the owner or the slave master and told him I want to buy this lady and in the back end and then he paid the money and then instructed the slave master to set her free to loosen it to take the chains off and it's nervous I said no I can't do that if I take the chest off and she runs away you are coming back for your money it is not going to happen the man said take the chains off I have paid you if she run away I am NOT coming for the money take the chance of the slave girl herself was shocked because it is not something that happens whoever buys you wants to make sure that they have a grip on you so they got you while you are going the slave girl herself or shot the slave master took their chains off and then the rich was started going and then the slab caster a following then they were going just booming and buried on going and got to a place and then I rich my turn today young girl and told hey you are free she was shocked what I talking about he said you are free you can go your way and instead of going and then the guests are following him again then he stopped and turned to her I say you are free you can go and she said that you know what I am free I reckon I am free I appreciate that but I want to come with you now wherever you are going even though I am free I have chosen out of my own will out of love to save you till I die and he said come over and this is the type of relationship crisis looking for then we shall serve Him out of love and not out of fear out of love and not out of bondage you know when a man or a woman is seven in fear or in bondage they can give you all but they never give their best and Christ is not just looking for your own but looking for your best and that can only come when there is a love relationship but under pressure you can probably good those trees to please your master but you know that it's not if there is no love there if any man Christ didn't come for the poor he didn't come for the rich he didn't come for the Kings he didn't come for their servants he didn't come from there for the red for the blue for the green he didn't come for the educated they illiterate no he came for everybody if any man a broken and a contrite heart the Bible says God would not turn down he would not reject any man the Bible says for God so loved the world that He gave us his only begotten Son that whosoever you cannot align that whosoever and we qualify today whosoever will qualify whosoever believeth should not perish praise be to God the kingdom of God was likened unto a rich man that was throwing a feast a wedding feast for his son and when everything was ready and those that were supposed to come and then feast during the wedding refused to come and having killed some of his servants and then he sent his other service to just go and stand by the road and whatever is passing it doesn't matter what that you have taken the above or not if they can only accept the invitation they should come in it doesn't matter who they are they should just invite whose soever whosoever if any man if any man will come after me now there is no way somebody can tell you to come after me when you are not going anyway when somebody tells you come after me and they are not going in any way it tells you the a mental state praise be to God and in this day and age sadly though there are people there are not go in anyway and yet they have followers they're not they are not going anyway and they have followers when you take their political realm they are day you take business they are they you take Christianity you shall find them in surf faith they know that you are not going anyway you go on Facebook you going ham Instagram call the names the people that are know going in a way and they know within themselves I am NOT going in a way and sometimes they are pleasantly surprised that they are not they are not going in a way and yet they have people following them praise be to God and it's sad that even those who are following him know that this relationship has no meaning this person I am following will not carry me anyway and yet I'm going to follow him why he dies they all die where they bury him there I will be buried the swear allegiance it is sad but it is not so with our Lord and our Savior Jesus he said if any man will come after me in other ways he has charted a course he has charted a course he has led a path praise be to God if any man will come after me the Bible says there is a wider seemeth right unto a man the end thereof is death the Bible says wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat and narrow is the gate Strait is the gate and narrow is there is a that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it in other words you have to look for it under Broadway everything goes the homosexuals the lesbians the robbers the t's oh you find men with dreadlocks earrings the body I mean also addresses everything goes letter right it's so broad that everybody's contained but on the narrow path on the narrow path the path is so narrow that you it's one at a time I remember the broad this is her this with us as individuals he does not deal with us as a nation as individuals one at a time there are is so narrow that you walk on the road and you walk and you get to a place and you are wondering am I on the right road because you look ahead of you and you are not seeing anybody you look behind and there is nobody coming but you know what stop it and you tells you that you are on the right Road praise be to God and you go you go you go to a place it's like the road is it's like it's like their purpose this is disappears but by the grace of God praise be to God oh this reminds you of that song do not go with me yet I will follow I have decided to follow Jesus no turning back no no no not go with me yet I will follow if I look behind us nobody coming I am going anyhow if I don't see anybody ahead of me I can see the footprints of those that I've already gone ahead I am going anyhow praise be to God is so narrow a path praise be to God that you can't carry all your baggage with you he has chatter dad cause he has laid the part all you need is just come true if any man for that matter if any woman will come after me praise be to God let him take up his cross daily daily not weekly not take your cross monthly not take your cross yearly not take your cross I know when you feel like you take your cross daily there is no weekend in Christ that I have served him for five days the next two days let me fool around there is no weekend you don't go on leave praise be to God there is no vacation in Christ as a matter of fact there is no retirement when you iron it you iron it so deaf do we part praise be to God take up your cross daily daily it's a daily walk with Christ and follow me I've already talked a little about follow me and coming after me so just add a little here take up your cross and follow me walk in his footprints what in the footprints of the Lord Jesus Christ the more you walk in his footprints the more you become like him take up your cross daily and follow me what does the cross stand for that is what I want to look at take up your cross and follow me what does the cross stand for you don't get to choose your cross you don't decide how heavy your crush should be and it's a good thing man does not have the the opportunity to choose his cross if I had the opportunity to choose my cross that would mean that I have the opportunity also to decide what cross you carry and the day I don't like you I'll make sure you carry the heaviest of them but it is God who decides how big your cross is going to be how long you are going to carry that cross how heavy is going to be is God who decides that it is not in enemy's hands what does the cross stand for when we look at the Scriptures we see it Friday Jesus was betrayed by one of the twelve so betrayal you are going to be betrayed because of your love for Christ people will betray you now attend your butt's on you it doesn't matter where you are family what are their neighbors what are your friends for having decided to walk with Christ they are going to betray oh they are gonna turn their backs on you praise be to God there is a story about lady in fact i was a 'muslim before as I've said it time and again and they're Muslims their cities differently if you have never been one you have probably seen some if you have never seen song you probably may have head of other stories if they can't kill you for turning the faith down they believe that you have done go to service that is what they believe and there was this lady there are certain Christ with an Islamic background and a hate that has so much her Paris hated her her brothers hated her the whole community ten against a because she has decided to walk with Christ one day she went to church she'll close from church she got home she didn't know what they had planned against her she entered a house her own brothers stripped her naked and three out of the house and she started running and crying running and crying and the other place she knew was the church and as soon as she got to the child the check those were so open she opened a dog jumped in and started crying Oh somebody help me help me help me and is what is the problem I said I need somebody should cover me up they better say you are covered she was covered from neck all did all the way down in a long rope and she didn't even knew about it we are serving a Living God the Lord our God is our life our God is not dead we are not serving a historical God we are serving a present tense God there I am the great I am praise be to God people I went to tenure boxing you why because of your decision to walk with Christ he was betrayed he was persecuted just think about the logic says Christ himself hurry in the cross was under the weight of that cross and not only that the way they were whipping him on his back where a brother said they whipped him so badly that you wouldn't find any skin on his back that was how terrible it was very terrible only the weight of the Cross spitting on him calling him names the Lord of glory he could have decided not to do it but he went this route because of the love he has for his you enemy he went this route because of the love he has for her he was persecuted he was afflicted he was in great agony great pain extreme pain and you are going to be afflicted not because he did anything wrong not because you're a sinner not because God doesn't know you but your decision to walk with Christ would expose you to afflictions you are going to be afflicted that is the lesson the cross stands for afflictions persecution death we can talk about a duck ages between 60 and 90 million Christians where make tired killed because of their love for Christ because of your decision to walk with Christ they were married they were killed but it's a good thing Christ said do not fear he that kills the body and has no power over the soul to cast it into hell all I can do the worst they can do is to kill this body if Christ her is this body in a way this body will live this body if Christ terrorists it doesn't matter when it happens that is how the Pope who say for me to live is Christ and today's game the most important in for you make sure that you are living in the perfect will of God if you have to drop this body drop it but fear he that after killing this body has power over the soul to cast it into hell so we are not moved we are now moved by editing the Devadas the devil remember is a coward there double inside of portunus --tz-- it's when you give the devil room that ever comes in but if you don't give the devil room he knows where to stop he one time but in my name bugged him so much and a mind just went and took a chair and then brought it into his prayer prayer closet and he said the chair down it's a Satan come I have a chair for you sit down and watch me worship my god praise be to God sit down and watch me worship the God was it my god don't give the devil room if you give him a yard he would take a mile a lot of the times we make room for the devil and we don't even know we've done that how does the cross stand for digestion persecution affliction agony death if any man comes after me let him take up his cross daily and deny himself and follow me to deny yourself in other ways you have the right to do certain things there are things that are legally okay to do the food that is legal does it make a spiritual now all the laws of the country permitted it's okay according to the statutes so I can do it it doesn't make it right if the word of God condemns it it condemns it alright therefore that it is lawful that doesn't mean that it is edifying so watch what you do watch the steps you take don't just give in to any spirit you have to disown yourself this only tease and the phrase and they say you are so used to some of us are so attached to this world that we'll want to live with the world can you imagine this world is done with the word on which we are living is in crisis is murder time I'm Tanner shall pass away this act is passing away and we have people who want to build castles on this earth that shows the mental state of people that a world that is dying people want to live on it deny yourself deny yourself take up the cross and follow him there was a story about some men that were asked to carry the cross brother like I told the story and I believe a lot of you here know the story but you know sometimes when you know the story before the story is even started you make your conclusions and you don't even pay attention because you know the story but I urge you to pay attention today praise be to God because the certain highway brother brother Johnny will tell you I awaken in an R&D environment and what do we do we just add and subtract every day and we don't add and subtract because the original recipe has a problem no it doesn't have a problem something that has been on the market for years and the customers like it but what do we do we come and then we take some little salt from here we take little sugar from here and then we add instead of canola oil maybe we'll add sunflower oil and then we give the different name that's all we do and it's working very well and the customers didn't like it and then there we go business is flourishing so I am going to add to that story and I'm going to subtract from that story it doesn't mean that the original story has a problem there is nothing wrong with our original story praise be to God to let you know there were five men that were asked to carry the cross I know in his story he said three so this tells you again that I'm dealing with my rnd bugra five men where as to carry D across right away one said I am NOT carrying it he turned it down he said he was not carrying his cross and that is the problem with a lot of us there are people you can never preach to there are people you can never tell the truth there are people who never hear the word of God they are so proud they are so big to the Word of God doesn't mean anything to them he said I am NOT carrying it they refused it so four people decided to carry their crosses and as they were apparently across and going they met people that were making fun of them calling them names holy rollers you are a cake old-fashioned and one of you and one God so discouraged by the name-calling that he threw his cross away and then he was just following them the first was the refuse to carry his cross is still following now the second person has passed away his cross and his was a following and yeah I'll only away and just think about it how some people have gotten so offended by the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ so they have ten but yet they have turned their back on God because they want to gain favor with the world they want to be friends with the world they just want to write and forward the world they want to be accepted in the world they live in this is not our home we have a better place to go if this was our home among the creations of God we should be the most miserable before they ever was what about this F what about this F would you layer that your life form there is nothing whetted praise be to God because they were calling him names making fun of him you Holy Roller he threw his cross now it came down to three they were currently across going and then they go to a point one just decided you know what I am yes I am NOT going to go instead of maybe 10 miles a day I am just going to go at my own pace I am NOT going to go at whatever pace you want me to go so he was on and off just go rest here sleep here the others were gone they left him behind so a wild beast came and consumed him and that is the problem of some of us that we want to serve God on our own conditions based on our own timing that it has to be our way you either serve God according to the will of God or you forget it total obedience it's what brings go down partial obedience is equal to disobedience last week we're gonna preach about select self surrendering is we are called to a total surrender because partial surrender is no surrender you don't serve God your way God has his way and man has his way you come by Gauss provided way if you want like come by girls provided way for that is the way of life any other way you are surely going to be disappointed he was seven god running the race according to his timing and then they were down to two people they were carrying across and as they were going one decided when they had almost gotten to the end of the road he didn't know that is one thing we have to be very very cautious sometimes you are so close to the end but you don't have the eyes to see and then based on your hero feelings you decide to do something else and then you lose your testimony are you've been standing for you lose it because of one stupid mistake he had gotten to almost the end and he said you know what the cross is too heavy and he decided to cut his cross into half to make his soul light so he can out courage oh yes think of it how people do it there you know what I am going to serve God and I'm still going to be in the world and your thing you are smart you can never ask my god you can never outsmart God you have one leg in the world and you want to have one leg in the kingdom of God it doesn't happen that way you are either here hundred percent or you are a hundred percent praise be to God he cut his cross in halves never see shortcuts in the kingdom of God there shudders cut there is in the kingdom of God is going the long route never take any shortcuts he cut his cut in half but praise be to God there was one that was faithful to the cause he didn't care how heavy the cross was he didn't care how many times he fell with a cross he didn't care how many times I mean he was faithful to the course he was under the width of the Crofts ask him for grace ask him for strength ask him for grace ask him for strength training and going on and on and on and then they go to the end of the road and in our samantha was standing and it was a deep trench a deep trench and anima said okay you're all warmly welcomed this is the promised land I'm standing on so go ahead put your cross across the trench and then walk over it into the promised land praise be to God then the first one just came where his cross he threw it over did the trench and it was exactly the length of the trench it was exactly the length of the trench hey true it over the trench and then he walked over it onto the from his land then the angel just pulled that cross over he said yes number two no matter who came he had cut his cross in half he just threw it over it fell short and it went inside the trench the other people didn't even have your cross they taught it divide outsmarting God there are taste we may never understand and a further you don't understand e doesn't give you room to do it the way you want it pick up your cross take up your cross there is a cross for every one of us there is a sunder says must Jesus bear the cross alone why orders go scot free and no there is a cross for every one of us if he being a load of glory carried his cross when he had the opportunity are the option are the choice to say no then you and I do not have a choice but to carry our cross there is a cross for everyone and as I said before you don't decide how big your crusher be you don't decide when to carry your cross and how to carry your cross it has to be by God provided way praise be to God we are called to the cross we are soldiers of the cross and as soldiers you need to count the cost just take the soldier in the natural take the sugar in the natural you don't just sleep sleep sleep and one day you get up and then become a soldier now you get up one morning and you said I want to be a soldier you would have counted the costs you sit down and then you count the costs because it's not an easy thing I have seen people my dad was a soldier and in the barracks you see people come to be enlisted and people come with your pants hanging down and I had their hair hanging but like the Bible says it's a shame for a matter how bushy hey it's a shame to have bushy a and they come later to be enlisted here in America I believe is different somebody has come from behind and they give them a dirty slap and then they land on the ground and then they get up if they don't run away and they stay that means they are ready and then they will pull up your pants and then go through and there to be enlisted and when they are training they carry these locks you can say you are not carrying it you signed up for it nobody forced you they paradis look I burn and you end the street singing singing and it's sad sometimes you see somebody following the leg is so swollen they can't even walk but you know what they are not giving up they are not giving up if they have to walk or crawl they are going to do it and on that day when they are graduating you will see him also in the language with him praise be to God they count the cost that the friends you grew up with their friends you went to school with their friends you love hanging around with you arise on four together you love to be around them that you are going to lose them very soon they count the costs now you go to the training and then you come back and you are not the same person I don't care how stupid you are the military put sense into your head by the time you're done when you come back you see things differently and those friends those lose friends they were around you you are either catching away from them or they're getting away from you because there is something about your life they count the cost there are family you belong to which you call your family you love so much that they are going to be secondary on the list of things that you'll be lying down in the house and then before you aware the siren goes off you get up you don't even tell your wife sweetheart I'm going there is the Tsarina so I need to go you just dress up and then 2015 15 20 minutes you are there and you go there you don't ask why did you guys someone else you don't ask you don't ask where are we going you are gues finally ready fortune and their car comes and they say you know what you guys enter the truck you know ask where are we going you signed up for it you are ready for anything that comes your way you go to war the soda is now your brother you fight shoulder to shoulder I don't care how much you disagree in the barracks in the army barracks and on the fruit of war you are brothers if you see an enemy aiming at him you wanna say oh no this guy is my enemy let the enemy take him down oh you are going to take the enemy time before the enemy even gets to him why because he's your brother I'm the food of war you have one common enemy the natural sugar counts the cost that when this happen he is not taken by surprise he knows that he made room for he counted the costs you counted the cost and we are spiritual soldiers praise be to God we are soldiers of the cross the Army is very good at shipping you I don't care how proud you are don't make you humble when I tell you to do something they'd have an adage or a slogan do before you complain so if the thing does it make sense to you they say do it before you come and complain so if I do it or they need em complaining I just have to keep go ahead they would discipline you they would take the pride out of you know make you humble do you think they hit you they don't hate you they are trying to mold you go in as a civilian they'll make a soldier out of you you build as a woman they'll make a man out of you yourself there are women that go to Sajal they also join the army it's true even though I would not agree for women to go join the army they do it but I tell you those women who go and get enlisted by the time they're finished they fill their training they are not the same woman Union they are men in women clothing you joke with them don't take me down before you realize it they are not the same you go as a code they'll bring the gallantry out of you now when you hear the sign of the bullet instead of running away you are running towards the bullet you go in as a boy they'll bring the man out of you they know how to shape you and to get you ready and as so you saw the cross how much more praise be to God we are soldiers of the cross you know the other day somebody said something to my wife on her I don't know is it messenger that's I think so and she forwarded to me and as I was thinking of this a part of it just played and last night I kind of transcribed it and I just want to take it in here we are soldiers of the cross there is no retreat there is no surrender we are in today praise be to God just think of it as I read this if the natural soldier would go to any expense and would never give up that he's ready to die for the sake of love love for country my goodness how about you as a child of God how about you as a child of God knowing that your life is in the hands of God that if in the perfect will of God you give up the ghost my goodness I don't care just think about it o mine john the baptist's was listed in this army then his head was taken off for the love of the gospel oh I think of when John the Baptist was in prison awaiting execution and they here called two of his disciples and told them go out Jesus the money had already baptized go ask him whether he is the one or we should still look forward for another I was wondering why would John the Baptist do that because he mean their power the Lord Jesus heard he knew who he was and here he was behind bars in prison he probably may have thought oh that he could even speak and the prison doors will just open and how come out and how come on up here it doesn't even seem concern or maybe what is going on his head or stick you know I think of Stephen when Stephen was be stoned for his love for the world Oh every stone that landed on him he may have said Oh have I believed in vain have I believed in vain oh lord have mercy what's going on yes hit him with stones left right oh he may have wondered whether he was in the will of God he may have wondered whether everything was all right oh that praise be to God praise be to God now be fine he kept he gave up the ghost God just opened the windows of having a little that he could see the turn of God praise be to God we are 7-eleven God I don't care what it is you're going through I don't care how heavy your cross is I don't care for how long you've carried your cross I don't care how the ups and downs we're you know what it pleases God that you should go through it and as God told Paul that my grace is sufficient for you remember whatever it is that you're going through remember that the grace of God is sufficient for you I look at Nataniel in a layout then Oh Nathanael we have Daniel the layers there and Ateneo if you've read the materials of the Lord Jesus Christ styling the Lions name and they lose the lion that Alliance we're coming looked at and if you saw him it was just a drawing but it was like a lion I have been waiting for you too long you have kept so long I have been waiting for you I need to cross on the other side when the Word of God has taken ahold of your life nothing else matters in this life you just want to please God and not a flesh well I said I I transcribed to read it's I am a soldier it just goes into what I'm talking about today I am a soldier a prayer warrior of the army of God the Lord Jesus Christ is my commanding officer the Holy Bible is my code of conduct faith prayer the word are the whoppers of my warfare I have been touched by the Holy Spirit trained by experience and tried by fire I am a volunteer in this army I am enlisted for eternity I will either retire in this army at the rapture or die in this army but I will not get out sell out or be talked out I am faithful dependable and capable if my god needs me I am day I am NOT a baby I do not need to be pump it pet it dreamed up pumped up or picked off praise be to God no one has to call me remind me rate me visit me and place me looming I am a soldier and a prayer warrior I am in place saluting my king obeying his orders praising his name and building his kingdom I am a soldier a prayer warrior no one has to send me flowers gifts food cars candy or give me a nose I don't need to be cuddled cradled careful or Kirito I am committed I cannot have my Phyllis had bad enough to turn me around I cannot be discouraged enough to tell me a sight I cannot lose enough to cause me to quit when Jesus calls when Jesus called me into this a me I had nothing and if I end with nothing I will still come out even I will win my God will supply will supply me all my needs I am a soldier a prayer warrior I am more than a conquerer I

captain and bring me back to rule with him I am a soldier a prayer warrior in this a me and I am matching Clemen victory praise be to God I will not give up I will not turn around I am a soldier a prayer warrior and God has my back praise be to God bird has your back and not only you but he also has your front and not only up front he also has your left side and your site how do I know job told us when the devil went to go to tell job he say you have cast a hater on him now nobody can even get help lay a hand on him so we are whirled around we are worried around there is no way the devil can come to us and anger the devil comes we are sealed in praise be to God the devil is sealed out we are children of God fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God and we are here to serve the purpose of God and we shall sell the purpose of God and nothing will stop us praise be to God I am a soldier God has my back he has my front he has my left he has my right I don't care what it is that I go through the name of the Lord is going to be glorified oh praise be to God remember bread ring as a rapper remember we all have a cross the car we all have a cross the current and a good thing about all of us having a cross to carry is that you don't look at somebody's cross and they make fun of it because already you have so much beddings under your old cross and you can only cry out and ask for God to help them if you see somebody cry I mean making fun of other people's cross it shows that they have nothing to carry and if you have nothing to carry it's a good time to ask yourself a question why is it that there is a cross for everybody and I am NOT carrying one [Music] there is a cross for everybody your cross is different from mine is different from yours everybody's causes different if you're not carrying your cross there is something wrong that is why you can talk about other people's crosses and make fun of it but when you are carrying your cross and you are carrying your cross faithfully you have not cut it in half you are carrying it faithfully you have not thrown it away some way you are carrying faithfully and you are under the weight and the burden of that cross you pray for mercy you ask for grace and then you prefer messy and you ask for grace for your brother pray for mercy as for grace for your sister praise be to God so remember that we all have a cross to carry we all have a cross the current and the purpose of carrying this cross is to bring the God that is me you out when a civilian joins the army he goes as a civilian and then they bring the Suja out of him he goes as a boy they bring the man out of him it goes as a woman they bring the men are of him he goes as a coward they bring the gallantry the bravado are of him when you come come as you are I've had people say time and again I want to stop sinning before I come to God and then they end up dying in their sins and as a matter of fact if you can do it without Christ then you don't believe him if you can't do it without the help of God you don't need God come as you are in your condition as you are just come forget of the risk come in the way you are and God is going to take care of the rest praise be to God God as you carry your cross on a daily basis you are faithful to the cause of Christ walking according to his will doing what he wants you to do what is going to one gradually he is bringing the mind inside out he's bringing the money inside out you don't realize it before you away certain things you used to do we don't do them anymore some places used to go we don't go there anymore before you realize the Word of God has become your absolute before you realize nothing else matter in this life apart from God before you realize your relationship with God as soon as the owner to new esteem in this life before you realize the beauty of God is shining through your life that people look at you and they get inspired people look at you and they get encouraged people look at you and the two constellation that you walk into a place I don't care how that the place is the light in you just shines abroad and that peace people around you enjoy it and you don't even know it once in a while people come to you and tell you brother sister there is something about your life praise be to God is to tell you how much influence God has given you in that environment there is a cross for every one of us there is a cross for every one of us are you carrying your cross if you are not carrying it where have you left your cross have you cut your cross in half or you are under the full weights and the bedding of the cross are you doing what God wants you to do if he being God didn't run away from it why are you ran away from your cross the cross is lying there waiting for you it's not because God hates us is the love of God towards us that drives us towards that praise be to God musicians you can come over we are going to go to the Lord in prayer just talk to God God understands every language Under the Sun because he is the author of all language talk to God in any language you are comfortable talking to him in for your heart before
