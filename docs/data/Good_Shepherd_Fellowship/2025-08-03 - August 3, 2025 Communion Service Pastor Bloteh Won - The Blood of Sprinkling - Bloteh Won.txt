So, as we uh we just go right into our little exitation before we we get into the community service tonight, I want to I just want to go over something that I've I've spoken on here tonight just to be able to encourage you. Um we not have much of a co projected tonight. We'll just read u scripture and few things that brother B said here just to be able to encourage ourself. Praise the Lord. Let's stand on our feet and we read from uh Hebrew chapter 12. Let's read from Hebrew chapter 12 tonight. Hebrews chapter 12. Let's read from verse 22. But yeah, I come unto man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Mount man Zion and onto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirit of just man made perfect. and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just uh thank you oh God for this portion of your word that we have read. We pray oh father that you would just put blessing upon it now. We love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. Paul is speaking here that that uh we have come onto Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem and innumerable company of angels. We have come to the general assembly that is the mystical body. the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the jo the and to the God and to God the j of all and the spirit of just men be perfect. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. My tongue is beginning to stick at the roof of my mouth. Amen. And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling. That's what I want to talk on a little bit tonight just before we pray the blood of sprinkling. But before then, I also want to I want for us to just do a little review here. And uh the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. So like I said this morning, Hebrew is uh is a promise uh uh book. It's a promise book. It's a book of better things. Let's look at it that way. Amen. Because right in the book of Hebrew, there's there's a whole lot of promise there where God uh uh uh I mean Paul speaking to the church, he speaks of uh of better things. And I want to like I said I'll do a little review. Let's go back uh to Hebrew chapter 1. We will just uh go through few verses here and just and just look at some of the things that Paul speaks about. Hebrews chapter 1 let's look at verse 4. Hebrew chapter 1 verse4. So you will see that from Hebrew chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3 up to chapter 5, Paul is uh uh Hebrew chapter. Hebrew chapter one. Oh, found myself in the book. Hebrews chapter 1 verse4. So you see right here Paul speaks here talking about Jesus from verse three who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. When he h when he have by himself porch, I was saying sat down on the right hand of the majestic on high being made so much better than the angels. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As he have by inheritance or fain a more excellent name than they. So you will see how the the uh the apostle Paul he's trying to bring to to his Jewish brothers uh and and to to make them to understand that this Jesus that we crucify and uh uh uh if you look over in the Torah or you look over in the book of Moses, you will realize that uh Moses spoke of him and everything that was done in the tabernacle, everything of the prophet ETS was pointing to this Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you know the difference between the the Pharisees and the and the Sadducees, you will know that the Sadducees do not believe in angels. The Sadducees do not believe in resurrection. And uh and and uh like like brother George Martins uh uh of blessed memory will say, he says that's the reason why they are side. You see, praise the Lord. Because they don't believe in angels. They don't believe in resurrection. Praise the Lord. But the Pharisees believe in angels. The Pharisees believe in resurrection. And and uh and to them, you know, angelic being angels were were were great thing because angels came to the prophets. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul is now trying to bring to them that this man Jesus, praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the angel of the covenant. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to make them to see how he was better than the angels. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's trying to he's trying to magnify the person of Jesus Christ to to uh to the to to the Jewish church or the Hebrew believers to make them to see that he was better than an angel. Let's go down to uh chapter 6. chapter 6 verse9 he picks up another better thing because if you look there he talks about the the the angels he talks about the priesthood in chapter four and five and and and and all of that but let's go to chapter six if you actually search it out in the book of Hebrew there are 13 better things 13 better that uh Paul speaks about chapter 6 verse9 N But beloved, we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany the salvation though we do speak. Praise the Lord. Amen. Encouraging the believers, he says that uh uh you know we are persuaded better things. Let's look at chapter 7 verse 7. And we read from verse six. But he whose he who desend is not counted from them receive tithe of Abraham and bless him that had the promises. And without all contradiction, the less is bless. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who was the better? Mechisedic was the better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So Paul is now also bringing that uh uh the the the Levites were asked to receive tithe, but he's trying to tell the the Jewish church, let's go back to where it began from. Amen. that the less was blessed of the better because it actually started there in Genesis when uh uh when he came down Mechisedic came down to Abraham and then he bless him. When you go down you see how he's talking about the Mechisedic priesthood which of course he's trying to establish that that priesthood was a better priesthood than the Leviticus priesthood. Praise the Lord. So that is our uh another better uh chap uh verse 19 verse 19 chapter 7 verse 19 reads for the Lord made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope. Praise the Lord. So he's he's he's trying to emphasize Moses gave us the law. He came down from the mountain with with the tablets in his hands. But those commandment those h commandment laws that was given to him, it made nothing perfect, but all it did was just to give us a better expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can look forward to something better coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. chapter uh verse 22 in the same chapter 7. The Lord be nothing perfect at verse 19 but but but the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw nigh unto God. Verse 22. But so much was Jesus made a assurityity of a better testament. Are we together? &gt;&gt; We are having a better hope. We have a better testament. We are persuaded of better things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's better than the angels. Let's look at chapter 8 verse 6. I'll get out of my bed here soon. If we read from verse 5, chapter 8 verse 5 and six, who unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was uh admonished of God, when he was about to make the tabernacle, for seeth he that thou make it all things according to the pattern show thee in the mountain. Verse six, but now have he orain a more excellent ministry. Talking about Jesus, but how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses came down uh uh from the mountain with the tablets in his hands. He came down with the commandment of God and and he and and and he and he told the people that God show him, you know, the pattern of this tabernacle that was going to be built. But yeah, Paul now is taking it much farther as he talks about Jesus. He said, but but now he have obtained a more excellent ministry than than that of Moses. But how much he how much also he is a mediator of a better covenant which also establish upon better promises. It it can just be better for a child of God. It can just be better. &gt;&gt; It can never go back. It can never get worse. Your trials is just to make you better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says and even our Lord Jesus says if if we as a parents know how to give good gift to our children how much more about the heavenly father he just don't give us good gift he give us better gift &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; praise the lord &gt;&gt; oh I love the lord amen &gt;&gt; I just love it we have a better covenant and we get better promises because our promises is the duration of our promises are not only for this life. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is also for the life to come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Better confident, better promises. Let's look in chapter nine, verse 23. I hope you're having a good time like I'm doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this. Uh uh the book of Hebrew is is a is a special book to me and I I like it. Amen. Chapter 9 verse uh 23. It was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heaven should be purified with these. But the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. Now, what Paul is talking about here is that God gave Moses a pattern to build a tabernacle and all the things in the tabernacle, it was it was was given to Moses in a vision, he was instructed where to place them, everything. But the Bible tells us that every time every time a sacrifice was made and and the high priest would made a sacrifice for himself and a sacrifice for the people, he would take the blood the water of separation mixed with hassel. After he sprinkle it on the people, he will also have to sprinkle it, which mean he will have to sanctify the entire tabernacle and the people wave the water of separation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every sacrifice it was a repeated thing. So what what Paul is now saying over to the to the Jewish brothers here and here is it now we have a better sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the sacrifice of bulls and goats. We have a better sacrifice and which of course it makes the preaching of the word the sprinkling of the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are not mixing you know a lamb blood with house sap and arches from the sacrifice to sprinkle it upon the people but we are sprinkling the promises of God. Amen. When the word is preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have a better sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. We are closing up here. You know the beautiful thing about this. I was I was just in the office going over there again and I was counting my better like you know we we love to do and uh uh you count the better actually they are 13. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And 13 is the number of the church. Amen. It's the number of the woman. So Christ is going to get a better bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a better church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hebrews chapter 10:34. Verse 34. For years had compassion of men abound and took joyfully the spoils of your ghost, knowing in yourself that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So he's saying there are better things that is waiting for us on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we gave our time, we gave our services to the Lord, we gave our substance to the Lord, there are better things that are waiting for us on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 11, that's the fifth chapter. Praise the Lord. Let's read these three and then we will close here and then just look into what we want to share with you tonight. 11 verse 16. Let's go back to verse 17 a little bit. It give us a good picture here. Verse 14. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a city. And truly, if they have been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might they might have had an opportunity to have returned. &gt;&gt; But now they desire a better country. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was Abraham looking for that that uh a city who maker and beta is gone because we know that all of these country are going to die. Everything is going to perish. Everything is going to be dissolved. We are looking for a better country. &gt;&gt; With a better government. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For now they desire a better country that is unheaven. Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he have prepared for them a city. &gt;&gt; Every country has a capital city. Amen. &gt;&gt; So our better city has a better capital. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; The word of God is just so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at verse 14. Oh, I love this. We read this this morning. Verse 39. And these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. God having provided some better things for us that they without us should be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We can read about the characters in the Bible. You read about Samson. You read about David. you know, you read about Abigail and uh and and you know, and and and sometimes you you know, there there's a sense of spiritual jealousy. I wish my name was in the Bible. Amen. I wish my art was uh recorded. But you see uh uh uh just like what Paul is trying to bring to his brothers to see, you know, all of those people with all of the good report and all of their good testimony that he had, they did not receive the promise. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is the promise? Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were led by inspiration. They were inspired to do what they did. They were inspired to to pray like David in the psalm. They were inspired to sing songs. But now we have the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have better think &gt;&gt; which is Christ in you. Greater is he that is in you. &gt;&gt; He that is in the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we might sometimes we you know you you think about the the the three Hebrew boy going in the fire. Think about what we have to deal with in our age. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, we will be in sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean we will be in sin. We will be piercing our ears and hanging our pains down and and and maybe drunk on the street also. But God God has possessed our body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We might be dealing with one thing or another, but we have a better hope. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever we have in us is better. That uh that uh uh they without us are not made perfect. We have to be here. We have to come. There's uh chapter 10 verse 40 and uh chapter 12 verse 24. That's what we read as our opening scripture. But let's read that again. Chapter 12 verse 24. We go back again to verse 22. But yeah, I come onto Mount Zion and onto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels. Can you imagine Jesus there in Gethsemane? He said, "I can ask the father to send me legions of angels, but you have it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul is saying here. &gt;&gt; He gave his angels charge over us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the company. Brother Brandham will say in a message uh uh revelation is uh uh what symbols. How did he title that? &gt;&gt; Revelation the book of symbols. You will see that uh he has make us uh angelic association. &gt;&gt; He has brought us in the company of angels. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says once in a while when you feel the joy of the Lord you just bump into angels. &gt;&gt; Those things sound common to us. They are reality. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine on that mountain and Elijah is telling his seven boy don't worry. &gt;&gt; There is more with us than they that are against us. &gt;&gt; But the young man was so terrified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He believed his pastor but he was so terrified. Are you sure? Are you sure? God. Elijah said, "Lord, just give him a vision." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And God just opened the corner of his eyes and he saw the angels &gt;&gt; all over. And Paul is saying, "We are right in the company of them." &gt;&gt; Then what are you afraid? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why are you afraid? Why can't you hold God's word? &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; To the general assembly, the church of the firstborn, which which are raised in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirit of just just men made perfect. and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the last of the better. Paul is talking about the blood that speaketh better things &gt;&gt; than the blood of Abel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. the blood that speaketh better things and I believe that uh uh uh let's let's go to the book of uh Genesis here I should take just few minutes here when I get excited then I'm taking more time amen I should not be a side I should just be myself amen I should just praise the Lord You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I sure you do. &gt;&gt; I'm very well sure you do. Let's Let's look down here. Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3. I thought about this the other day. You know, this morning we read where Jesus says, uh, you know, don't rejoice in all these things. Rejoice because your name is on the book of life. That's something we have we have preached before. &gt;&gt; And John the Revelator was in that group. When Jesus was saying, "Rejoice because your name was in the book of life." It was not real to him. It was sounding. It just went over his head. Revelation chapter 5, that's when what Jesus said became real to him &gt;&gt; because he saw his name on the book. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's let's watch this one. That's what tonight I want to I want to see with your faith before we pray. Verse 20. Revelation 3:20. And Adam called his wife named Eve, because she was the mother of all living. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham would let us to know which of course if God took clothes of skin and and and uh uh uh you know he if he took coat of skin and clothed them then which mean God killed Elam? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then which mean God kill a lamb on the east side of Eden. And he has to take the skin to dress his son and his daughter. Take off their their fake leaf apron that is sold for themselves and dress them in bleeding skin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same way that we are dressed in the bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, but this is where I want us to come. Paul is speaking about the blood that speak better things than the blood of Abbe. Now, but uh before Abel blood will speak, we realize that Abel uh King and Abel went down here to church and they were they were you know trying to bring some worship to the Lord and bring sacrifices to the Lord. Now Paul in the same book of Hebrew would tell us in Hebrew 11 that Abel by faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abel by faith offer a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now many times I've been there before where sometimes and many times uh uh uh uh that scripture looks like something just struck a from the blue. Okay. Something just just reveal open to a eyes that uh oh it's is it was blood or blood is the right sacrifice or animal was killed or blood that was shared in the garden of Eden. But what I want to bring to your mind tonight is that uh I believe that God can give revelation because I mean we sitting down on a h a message that uh God has given many revelation to the prophet of the hour. But just like how Paul will says that faith cometh by hearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And hearing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now let me take you through a little drama here. Imagine Adam and Eve and and and Cain and Abel asking their parents, "How was it in Eden?" You talk about Ed. How was it in Eden? And uh and Adam is explaining how he why he gave the name to the lions and why he gave this animal the name. He says, "You see that hill there? It used to be down there, but I thought we needed a valley there. So I put it on this side and and and and and the boys start asking but why are we not having this? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing happened to us as uh as parents when you telling your children when we came to the Lord and when we came to the message how it used to be and uh you know and and and the things that we experience and and the move of God. We used to go to convention. We used to go to services here and all of that and they are now looking at the present day this church and I says why is it different? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What happened? Then I believe that uh uh uh uh uh Adam and Eve had to tell them the why. &gt;&gt; How we got here. Like your child will ask you a question. Uh h who made a car? Okay. Before men started driving car, how were they how are they traveling? Now this it's it's more question now for you to start going back and start explaining how we used to walk from one town to another and and you know and then you get into the countdown and explain from Henburgie to uh to uh uh uh cod and and then you can explain all of that. But think about it this way. Think about it this way that that that that uh uh uh King and Abel, they are sitting right there and and their parents are testifying until they came down to the place of where Eve said that she listened to the serpent. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And think about it. And daddy, what did you do? question to Adam. When mama did that, what did you do? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Adam saying, I look right in the eyes of your mother. &gt;&gt; I knew if I reject her, I will have to be alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because Adam never had no second choice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We get a lot of choices around us. That's why sometimes people are stupid. And I realized I knew what it was when I was all alone. And I love mama so much that I just couldn't allow her to to go into God's wrath and identify myself with her. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And what happened? Adam saying, "For the first time, I saw the animals running after one another. &gt;&gt; For the first time, I lose control. &gt;&gt; I couldn't say stop. They won't stop." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then what happened? What's about the evening time? You remember when you used you talk about God coming down in the evening time. What happened that evening? Says, "Oh boy, I heard his voice. Praise the Lord. I heard his voice and I hid myself." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now he's telling, you know, all of this now to to to his sons and we got ourselves some fake leaf and and everything and but yet God came so close and he kept calling. He knew exactly where we are. I think we never knew where we were but God knew where we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God calling Adam, it was not because that he didn't know where Adam was. It was all because Adam did not know where he was because he was out of his position. He was out of his place. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But then when he came around the first time I would see blood, I saw a skin dress maybe hanging on a tree. and fresh blood was dropping from that and he told us to take off our our leaves and go and wear those skin. Now think about it now. He's he's he's testifying. He's saying the word ether by faith and faith cometh by the word. &gt;&gt; It was not a vague thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when you hear the word and the word being preached to you and you are reading the word &gt;&gt; your faith generates &gt;&gt; from what you have heard &gt;&gt; your faith in believing God generates from what you have been reading &gt;&gt; it was not a big thing that just dropped in Abel's mind &gt;&gt; it was from what he heard amen &gt;&gt; because we have a record here &gt;&gt; that God slay the lamb &gt;&gt; and he dressed him in his Amen. &gt;&gt; And Adam saying all of this to the boys and every time when we walk out of his presence brought them over to to uh uh uh Genesis 3:15, we heard God saying the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent and all of that. And he asked them to go and and and and and Adam talking about every time you know they would take a step they would see the blood constantly dropping &gt;&gt; from the skin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know brother Brandham called that constant atuming. &gt;&gt; That's what we have when you walk in the light &gt;&gt; as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's your that's your bloody skin that you are dressed in. &gt;&gt; You have a constant atonement. &gt;&gt; As you walk in the light as he is in the light. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we have a constant atonement. &gt;&gt; So that's what I wanted to bring to you tonight. That in their faith that Paul testify of was just not an imagination. &gt;&gt; It was a faith that was generated. from what he heard &gt;&gt; because that is the same thing to the believer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Service is over. They gone home and everybody went to their place and everything and and and and over and over and over this shepherd board is thinking in his mind, I I can't imagine it. Kill one of my sheep. God killed a sheep. Oh my, that's terrifying. But the word talks to his mind. &gt;&gt; He's thinking about it. &gt;&gt; As horrible as it may seem, sometimes the preacher preaches and it looks like he's blasting and it looks like I mean he he's sounding angry and sometimes something sticks on your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mind do not accept it in the first. Why? Why did he say that? &gt;&gt; But God will use that thing &gt;&gt; and keep turning it around your mind and every time you meditate on it, &gt;&gt; faith is being generated. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every time you think about it, you meditate upon it, faith is being generated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just waiting for the time to get into action. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As much as I will have think that oh it was a horrible thing that they killed an animal. Why would they kill an animal for what you did daddy? As much as he think that it was a horrible thing &gt;&gt; when he was faced with the choice of bringing a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has generated so much faith that he had to do the same thing that God did. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because he had generated so much faith from that word that he heard &gt;&gt; that an animal was killed in the east side and my parents were dressed in the blood. It was horrible. It was terrifying. But as time goes by, &gt;&gt; that word starts to generate faith in your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam said, "If you don't understand it, pray about it." &gt;&gt; Amen. Just prayed about it. Don't reason it out. Don't make an interpretation. Just say, "Lord, I don't understand this thing." Amen. And you just prayed about it and God will start, you will realize that that thing will start haunting your mind. I wonder why did the Bible say that? I wonder why did the preacher say that? But that's God's way of generating faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He start generating faith in you. And that's the way that Abel brought a more excellent sacrifice to God. It was not from an imagination or a vague revelation. It was from a word that was given to him. A word that was preached. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God will say he would die on the very same altar of his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Sometimes if uh you know we turn to think that it means the same place. No, you will die for what you believe. You die for what you hold to obeying the truth. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not facing a fiery squad. It's it might not be going to prison. But it's because you hold dear to your heart. Hold dear in your heart what you believe that God were said by his tribe I'm healed. &gt;&gt; You hold that dear in your heart. You believe that God word says uh uh uh uh he have blessed us with all spiritual blessing. And you hold those things dear in your heart that God's word says I will be adopted. His word says if you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I will hold I I will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And as a believer you hold that dear in your heart. &gt;&gt; Even though things are happening around you, you are bing with it in your mind but you are holding what you believe in your heart. And if you should die, you will die on that altar. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. And there's a blood that speaketh better things &gt;&gt; than the blood of Abel. Praise the Lord. And I believe that this evening that blood is speaking grace &gt;&gt; and peace. is speaking mercy. Praise the Lord. It's speaking on our behalf. It's speaking so loud. Is re-echoring the promises from this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Musicians, you can come while we just want to take their thought in prayer tonight. a blood that speaketh better things. So you we see right there in u in the book of Hebrew, you know, I' I've learned this every time uh the devil try to push you against the word, just tell him it can only get better. &gt;&gt; When I read the word, I only see better things. &gt;&gt; It can only get better. &gt;&gt; Amen. You tell him boo devil, it can only get better. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's what the word says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The grace of mercy. Let's sing that. [Music] [Music] Yo, Grace and mercy has brought me true. Oh yes, your grace and mercy has brought me true. Oh, I'm living this moment. All because of you. I want to thank you and praise you too.

When Jesus resurrected and Mary saw him, he said, "Touch me not, I go to my father, your father." He was going to present the sacrifice. Brother Brandham said it stands as a memorial before God. &gt;&gt; A blood that's speaking healing for you tonight. A blood that's speaking deliverance. A blood that is speaking breakthrough.

For I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed. That's reading from verse 23 1 Corinthian 11 that the Lord Jesus the same night he was betrayed [Music] night in which he was betrayed took bread. 24 [Music] And when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup when he have sed saying this cup is the new testament of my blood. This do ye as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unwartiling shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the cup. This we have told you before that the worshippers were never under examination. It was the sacrifice. So when Paul speaks for us to examine ourself is to examine ourself in accordance to our sacrifice. Are you accepting your sacrifice? Are you counting your sacrifice better than you? Praise the Lord. Are you believing in your sacrifice? Is it sufficient for you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For for he that eatth and drinketh and wallet, eat it and drink it damn nation to himself. Not discerning, [Music] not discerning your body, but you are not discerning the Lord's body. [Music] Praise the Lord. St. John chapter 13. [Music] So John chapter 13 we read from verse two. And supper being ended, the devil having put having now poured into the heart of Judas as Simon's son to betray him. Jesus knowing that the father have given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God. He rises from supper and lay aside his garment and took a towel and g himself. After that, he pou water into a basin and begin and be to wash the disciples feet and to wet them with a towel wherewith he was gathered. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord, does thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest, not now, but thou shall know hereafter." And Peter said unto him, "Thou shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash that, thou has no part with me." Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my feet on it, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said unto him, he he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet, but is clean everywhere, and ye are clean, but not all. For for he knew who will betray him. Therefore he said, Ye are not all clean. So after he has washed their feet and has taken his garment, and he was set down again, and he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done unto you. Ye call me master and lord, and ye said well, for so I am." [Music] If I then your lord and master has watched your feet, you also ought to watch one another feet. For I have given an example that ye should do as I have done unto you. Verily I said unto you, the seven is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If he know these things, happy are ye if you do them. I will cling to the old rocketed cross. No endless change is some days for the craft. [Music] Oh, so I cherish the old rocked cross. And to my trophies I last I lay down. I will cling to the old rocket wash. And there's exchange some days for the ground. Let's sing that one more time. Lord, so I cherish the old rock. [Music] Till my trophies are last lay down. Oh, I will cling to the old rocked cross and exchange your pain for the Christ.
