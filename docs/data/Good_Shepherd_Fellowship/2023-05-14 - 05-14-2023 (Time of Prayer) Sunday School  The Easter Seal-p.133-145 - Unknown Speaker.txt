[Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] the Jews what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this creightoning power fell from heaven there was a bravery set upon them there was something an understanding where they wasn't too sure of it a few hours before they know he had he had died they know he had risen they talked to him on the way but was that thing for them or was it just for them for Jesus himself but here on the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit the abstract fell upon the Believers that made them part of his resurrection made him part of his Fellowship the Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised then from cowards to Brave man they were they were afraid of the very word that they thought don't let this pass over you they were afraid they know that he was that word even the Jews had to admit it Nicodemus said Rabbi we know that you're a teacher that come from God no man that could do the things you do except God be with him now we know that we recognize that so the disciples Peter had even sworn in his presence all of them had forsaken him at the crucifixion but here they are now up in this Upper Room in the presence of God then all of a sudden here come this Holy Spirit down from heaven and it quickened them and the quickly took place they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed in known to be the truth otherwise they were afraid of it amen how many Presbyterians how many methodists how many Baptists in the world today how many Pentecostals that's a knows the truth and afraid to make a standalone I'm persuaded to wonder what was that fell on you are you a part of his resurrection would you dare scream all for some man's Therian idea harv you got the real bonus in the the real manhood it takes to stand out and call right right and wrong wrong are you a part of his resurrection are you a worshiper of a bunch of Creeds or you're going to church do you have your name on there and dad is sin and trespasses he that believes not the full word of God is a sinner those Pharisees believed in many things to be the truth they said we're God's children and they were until that word was preached but when that word was preached and Vindicated then they become sinners for rejecting the thing that they know was right and witness that we know the harder teacher come from God for no man could do the things that you do without God being with him hot water today where are we at where is this Resurrection finding us are you dance are you dare to take God at his word that's it if you're ordained alive you sure will do it if you're an eagle you can't help doing it there's something in you or do you want to serve a Creed somewhere say I go to church I'm just as good as you are see if you hold old birth rights you will never see it you can't see it but if you do hold a possession of this Birthright you can't help from seeing it because it's part of you and you're a part of it my other mother give me birth how could I have a father that his own blood is in me how could ignize Charles Brown for me and my father I could not do it I'm willing to stand his reproach or anything else because I am his son Hallelujah then being the son of God and he was the word of God how often I deny that Bible being truth that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and see the hour that we're living in we need our Easter in the church Resurrection we need a resurrection to power of pain man we need to stand out for that which is God's Vindicated word say well we have in our Youth for Christ that's all right our church is having a meeting we want to know so many members nothing against that that's all right but that's only the atmosphere that might be an old hens feathers but if you'll get in the right atmosphere the aerial hatch an eagle if you're a eagle egg and if you were for our date of God to Sid you gain help from seeing it you're coming for their Resurrection that's the way the Baptist is born that's where the Methodist is born in the resurrection that day but they turned off to him instead of an eagle I said not long ago going down from Tucson I watched a very strange thing I've seen a hawk sitting on the wire down there that Hulk has long lost its identification it used to be a bird next to the eagle it could not follow the eagle no by no means nothing can fall an eagle but he was a hawk Christ is the eagle and the church should at least be a hawk they could fly higher than any other rest of hers but that Hawk has become soft amen this lost his identification he sits on the telephone wires and waits for some dead rabbit he hops like a vulture and instead of flying like a hawk and all my brother's sister you Pentecostal people which is my own dear people the church is losing its identification it's coming down and depending on some dead formal Creed instead of buying in the heavily shutter for fresh matter a Hulk used to hunt his own manner but today he takes what the automobiles run over what the vultures eat he hops like one he looks like one we saw adorned ourselves in the modern world are women cutting their hair and wearing shorts are a man but not enough backbone to stand the pulpit and tell the truth we've long gone soft on the word whole gods and the Holy Ghost and look out them Eagles somewhere that's ready to stand now no matter what takes place that'll soar into the unknown not set on the telephone wires and look for some Sunday school literature to come in let me have the word in it as precious of the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost we need a Easter a resurrection that's potentials my friend if you're satisfied with such a Karen of the world there's something wrong my sister my brother let me say to your sin Godly fear knowing that I may never live to Sinister again but there's one thing sure what a genuine four Dean Son of God by the word of God hears that voice of God he'll rise and go to me it's the potential that is going to meet the real living word as he was the bride will meet the groom she's a part of his body notice long have we we're losing our identifications we come on Wednesday night some of us others stay home to watch who love Susie televisions all kinds of worldly things all kinds of entertainments to keep you away from church long have we lost it our seminaries our schools are putting out a bunch of rickies with a whole lot of Theology and entertainment and everything in the church to take the place of the prayer meeting we've talked dressed and try to fulfill what the modernists try to do bring them in you will never win them by that they got more of that you have you ain't got no business on your ground on their ground let them come over on yours for their real baptism is shining or the real power of the Resurrection don't try to build a church like theirs don't try to have a pastor like that don't try to do this other or cooperate with the world they shot with Hollywood the real gospel goes with power Eagles hear that they don't look for a shine they look for a goal going with humility glowing with love glowing with power that's what the real Eagle hunts you can't scratch in a barnyard and please him you'll never be able to do it you'll never touch him because he don't believe him let that voice scream from the heavens I am he that was the place you need a damn forever and it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out of myself upper Hall's flesh glory to God I'll Quicken your Immortal language I'll Quicken your Immortal tones I'll give you the evidence so I'm going to bring in the resurrection with me hungry hearted Eagles reach for that just as hard as they can it's a pearl of great price that they sell everything else to go by God help us friend our churches are losing their identification It's Quickly now how to go to Sun what's the action of those disciples a scared they know Jesus was the truth but to see it was against a popular idea the proper religion of the hour the most strictest religion Sarah Pharisees Sadducees now and so forth they're close to Clans and denominations they were they were against that heresy but Jesus was the identified word and Jesus is the Holy Ghost in spirit a little while in a world see if you know more you shall see me not the body the life that was in in God it is upon the church to call Sons like he did that obedient I'll always do that which is pleasing to my Father which one of you can use me of sin in other words sin is unbelief what has the word said about me that I haven't done show me what the word said that I do it I didn't do which one can accuse me which one can lay your fingers on me and say that I haven't fulfilled my father's word or when the Pentecostal Church gets to that spot who can accuse me of unbelief oh Christians be identified not as a hawk but an eagle that Hulk is soft he'll come down you never see an eagle doing that you don't ever do that he hunts his own food out of the blue God's prepared him so he can see it he gets fresh Manna not something is dead in the Hebrews when he crossed to the Wilderness they eat try to eat dead Manna it'll become stagnant it had it had wiggle tails in it you know what we mean it's a contaminated rotten maggots is in it amen why would I eat a food that had been dead years ago it might be in form and shape but it isn't fresh we got to get food every generation new so does the eagle look for that food every generation as we're in our journey notice now let's take some people again let's take some of the Old Testament prophets see what they did let's look first at Stevens house Stevens in the midst of that Sanhedrin Council well that counselor brought him up there that great assembly of the Believers there are supposed to be Believers brought him up and tried to condemn him why he said you stiff necks uncircumcised and heart and ears you always resist the Holy Ghost that's that eternal life is your father's did it back on Earth through the prophets so are you doing it today and they asked upon him with their teeth they didn't want to hear that here's the gifts their Credence against their denomination and they stoned the man to death and he raised his hands up and look towards him and say I see Heavens open and Jesus stands the right side why he had the resurrection quickening power in him that took him into the bosoms of Jesus notice quickly now look at Philip down there in a great Revival having a Revival for it had been garrisoned for any man well if we had got a big cooperation amongst the churches and everything down there is having a great Revival and the quickening power of God spoke James said Stephen may have said this you're having a great Revival but I got one man I want you to talk to and Stephen's obedient no matter what it is how much criticism oh Stevens you can't leave but I can God said so and he went out into the desert and out there he found this eunuch and what happened he said has uh if thou believe us with all thine heart that Jesus is the son of God uh I'll baptize you when he baptized him look he was quickened by this quickening power to leave a Revival of thousands of people to go out into the desert to one man oh that'll be against all reasons see while these ten thousand won't you hear but there's one wanting out there see and the quickening power sent into God's provided place Hallelujah man and women it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do the things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about the neighbor said well that person's lost her mind pray all night they'll read the Bible I don't care what they say it's what God called you to do yes that's right or they say we can't have these old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals like oh yes we can too you can have it in yourself and you are the majority in God no matter what the rest of them think notice after in obedience listen close now after obeying God to his word when he fulfilled his mission that quickening power that he received at Pentecost caught him away quick in his body miles and miles away he was taken in the spirit and was found over in another country somewhere quickening power of God and if we be Pentecostals that same power that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in your mortal bodies amen all right notice let's take another man with his quickly power there was a man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch want a new thing come along with something come along and say well now we have to go back to the old school or this side the other Enoch walk with God whatever God said dude Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was the son of God he was an eagle and been called to that day and when he come to him he was so full of that quickening power remember he'd walk 500 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself not one time do you do but kept the testimony everything that God told him do he went and done it no argument about it he just wasn't done it no matter what anybody else thought he went and done it why he was full of that quickening power and when it comes time for the old man to die God is sent out a letter and he walked up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture amen that's that quickly power look at Elijah after his work was finished on Earth he was so full of that quickening power he condemn them Jackie Kennedy haircuts in his day he told Jezebel what he thought of her he told them preachers and Priests what was right and wrong and they didn't believe him but he condemned them painted face women they so bad and he's so full of that quick and empowered to nothing could harm him God had fed him in the heavens tuck him out and set him aside and he was so full of creating power come time to Die the Jordan opened up and he just walked to sit down a chair and took him up home so full of their quickening power he become a true genuine Son of God notice he had a successor and his name was Elisha and Elisha had a doubled Post in this quick and Power see he had a double potion of it now he preached for about 80 years or he was about 80 years old he took sick and die he didn't get to go home like Elijah did see both of them is represented there in the church some Saints Go in some resting but notice when Elijah was taken up in the rapture then Elisha went to sleep and God full of quickening power look at his prophecy just before he died okay now let me show you I don't care if you're dead or where you're at that quickening power never leads years and years after his death his meat and rotted away the skin worms and eat it up but they were packing a dead man one day throwed him in on that bones and they were so much quickening power there actually man come back to life again Hallelujah raise him up from the dead because that quickening power that was up on that saint of God never left him stayed right on those bones all remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power at all though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God glory to God I don't know what to say not a hope for an old man like me knowing I see my end time right I understand that's 56 years old that's that's a little bitty boy I've stood here trying to Proclaim this but I know that in me nothing good that I have nothing I've done but in me is that quickening power it quickened me one day for the things of the world [Music] thank you [Music] [Laughter] [Music]
