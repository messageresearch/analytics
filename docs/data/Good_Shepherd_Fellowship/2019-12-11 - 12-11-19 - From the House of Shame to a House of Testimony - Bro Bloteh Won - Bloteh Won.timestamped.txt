[51:48] you were not praying then you'll be
[51:49] telling lies amen praise the Lord in
[51:52] John chapter 4 it's a familiar story
[51:55] that we all know but I want I just want
[51:58] to pick up a little thought here tonight
[52:00] I've been kind of a thinking on this I
[52:03] was I was driving one time and they
[52:06] start drop on my mind I want to talk a
[52:09] little bit from the house of shame to
[52:11] the house of testimony amen
[52:15] moving from the house of shame to the
[52:18] house of testimony praise the laws in
[52:21] John chapter 4 and
[52:31] just for the scripture reading tonight
[52:40] verse 5 then cometh he to the city of
[52:43] Samaria which is called Sychar near to
[52:49] the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to
[52:53] his son Joseph now Jacob well was there
[52:57] Jesus therefore being weary with his
[53:02] journey sat dust on the well and it was
[53:07] about the sixth hour the Lord bless you
[53:10] may have you see Amen let's continue to
[53:13] read there come at a woman of Samaria to
[53:15] draw water and jesus said unto her give
[53:18] me to drink for his disciple would gone
[53:21] away on to the city to buy meat then
[53:26] cheese then then said a woman of the
[53:29] world then said the woman of Samaria
[53:31] unto Him how is it that thou being a
[53:35] Jews acts dream of me which I'm a woman
[53:40] of Samira praise the Lord and every time
[53:48] I think about this I think about the
[53:52] effect of a generation problem amen
[53:57] the world this woman said this because
[54:00] of what she has heard she was not there
[54:04] when the Jews and the Samaritan
[54:06] separated but because of what she heard
[54:09] on the news and her parents seen in the
[54:12] different things a kind of a bill they
[54:14] are feeling in her even though she was a
[54:17] daughter of Abraham amen
[54:19] she was a seed of God praise the Lord
[54:21] standing right before her Messiah but
[54:24] year because of how much this earthly
[54:27] world affect us sometimes and sometimes
[54:30] we come so close and but we we are
[54:35] affected you know we lean on the same
[54:39] times we you know we think about the
[54:41] past and all of these things praise the
[54:43] Lord let's just read a little bit down
[54:45] jesus answered and said unto her if they
[54:49] are lower the gift of God and woo it it
[54:53] is that said unto
[54:54] give me to drink they I would have acts
[54:57] of him and he who have given the living
[55:01] water and the woman said said unto Him
[55:04] sir
[55:04] they have nothing to draw with and the
[55:06] well is deep from things then have Dow
[55:13] that living water that greater than our
[55:17] Father Jacob which gave us the well and
[55:20] and drank thereof himself and his
[55:23] children and his cattle how much
[55:26] important there was to gain praise the
[55:28] Lord that was Jacob's Well they could
[55:31] identify themselves back to the promise
[55:33] of Abraham he men because they had they
[55:36] had a witness of Jacob's Well India
[55:39] myths
[55:40] now what I wanted to pick up tonight is
[55:42] their Jesus the scriptures say in verse
[55:45] 6 and that Jesus therefore being weary
[55:50] of his joining he sat doors on the world
[55:54] and it was about the sixth hour that was
[55:57] about the evening time he meant now
[55:59] brother Branham picked there from there
[56:01] to be able to give us a kind of a story
[56:05] or a vision of this woman life because
[56:09] of the colourful life that she was
[56:11] living she had to wait for the evening
[56:15] time she had to wait when all the young
[56:17] the married women and all the virgins
[56:20] and all the nice people the college
[56:22] graduates and every one of them go to
[56:24] draw their water she had to wait for the
[56:27] evening time praise the Lord
[56:30] so in in all or through the day she stay
[56:34] in the house of shame because of the
[56:37] lifestyle that she was living praise the
[56:41] Lord
[56:41] she was in the house of shame she could
[56:44] not associate with with with with the
[56:47] women of her age and even though she was
[56:49] she was a Samaritan living in Samara but
[56:53] because of the life because of her
[56:55] policy of her five men going through her
[56:59] life amen
[56:59] promising her that they will marry her
[57:02] and they disappear in III I just don't
[57:05] believe that you know
[57:08] justjust like brother branham said he
[57:10] top it with the church age he said every
[57:13] age because the age the church is a type
[57:16] of the womb of a woman he says like
[57:18] every woman is born a virgin he said
[57:20] every age was was virgin to God amen
[57:26] when that when the denominational
[57:28] doctrines increased are coming into the
[57:31] age that's when the age was defined but
[57:34] when God started dealing with the
[57:36] messenger of every age it was on the
[57:39] pure virgin word of god praise the law
[57:42] and that is the way every child was born
[57:46] every child was born a virgin unto God
[57:49] until one day they told a lie or restore
[57:53] something or they did something wrong
[57:55] that affected the spirit even though we
[57:58] were born in sin shipler in iniquity not
[58:01] I was saying that our parents in are we
[58:07] together
[58:08] Amen so so she was she was born she I
[58:13] mean she never just grew up right there
[58:15] than thinking about just running around
[58:16] with men and just you know living any
[58:19] kind of a lie something happen amen
[58:25] something happened somebody destroy her
[58:28] trust somebody broke her trust praise
[58:38] the Lord
[58:40] and whenever Trust is breaking people
[58:45] goes into a house of shame praise the
[58:54] Lord
[58:58] this and this and this woman this young
[59:01] pretty girl if she was not ready five
[59:06] men will not be running after her amen
[59:12] praise the Lord they were all attract
[59:16] her to her beauty her beauty the beauty
[59:28] that would say I perceive that you are a
[59:31] prophet that's beautiful
[59:33] when a person can perceive that this is
[59:37] the truth when a person can be able to
[59:41] perceive that this is the Word of God
[59:44] this is not church grease it's not just
[59:47] to be identified with a church but this
[59:49] is the Word of God that's the most
[59:52] beautiful thing that can happen to an
[59:54] individual some people just want to be
[59:56] they just want to be part of a church
[59:59] but it can perceive anything today
[1:00:03] everything is it's not different
[1:00:06] churches Church but there is something
[1:00:09] in the heart of a son of God or a
[1:00:12] daughter of God when they see the beauty
[1:00:15] of truth even if it condemned him it's
[1:00:20] beautiful
[1:00:23] praise the Lord I mean when you when you
[1:00:29] follow the composition she's talking
[1:00:31] with Jesus that gave me water you don't
[1:00:33] have nothing to draw and sad you have
[1:00:36] nothing to draw in are you greater than
[1:00:38] our Father jesus said unto her verse 13
[1:00:43] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:00:46] thirst again
[1:00:49] but whatsoever drinketh of the other
[1:00:52] water - I give him shall never thirst
[1:00:57] but the water that I shall give him
[1:01:00] shall be in him a well of water
[1:01:03] springing up into everlasting life
[1:01:11] praise the Lord he's talking about water
[1:01:14] talking about everlasting life and
[1:01:18] seeing this woman in her condition
[1:01:22] trying to sneak out and sneak right back
[1:01:25] into her shame but there was something
[1:01:29] in her when he says something ever
[1:01:32] everlasting life she says sir give me
[1:01:38] that water that is the beauty of the
[1:01:44] child of God the thing that attracts you
[1:01:50] to a lie beyond this life the thing that
[1:01:55] attracts you that convince you that this
[1:02:02] world is not your home that's the most
[1:02:05] beautiful thing that can ever happen to
[1:02:07] you are we together tonight sure give me
[1:02:14] this water and how we did that our
[1:02:18] church that neither come hither it's
[1:02:23] sneaking out and sneaking back in if I
[1:02:26] can just have that water that would be
[1:02:29] in me that would bring satisfaction
[1:02:39] jesus said go call the husband Jesus
[1:02:46] sent her right back to her shame
[1:02:57] it's becoming good tonight
[1:02:59] amen that's what happened when the
[1:03:02] people begins to pray praise the Lord
[1:03:07] then the preacher can preach effortless
[1:03:11] it's your prayer that is preaching to
[1:03:14] you tonight and I mean praise the Lord
[1:03:22] go and call your husband and come hither
[1:03:25] my goodness talking about he just told
[1:03:31] me something interest
[1:03:34] something so I can just lock myself in I
[1:03:40] don't have to come to this well and draw
[1:03:44] it anymore because she's looking over
[1:03:50] her shoulder when she comes in and she
[1:03:55] goes straight to the well because all in
[1:03:58] her mind they are looking at me I wonder
[1:04:00] what they are saying praise the Lord
[1:04:05] so she wanted this water world she can
[1:04:07] she can just she can just stay right in
[1:04:10] her Sheen but no Jesus wanted to take
[1:04:13] her from the house of shame to the house
[1:04:16] of testimony praise the Lord and that's
[1:04:20] what he want to do to you tonight amen
[1:04:22] that's what he want to do that's the
[1:04:24] reason why he redeem us to take us from
[1:04:27] the house of shame because our first
[1:04:29] birth put us in the house of shame
[1:04:37] praise the Lord
[1:04:46] and until we meet Jesus we will leave
[1:04:50] the rest of our life in the house of
[1:04:53] shame we just be looking for a time to
[1:04:57] slip out quickly and come back praise
[1:05:02] the Lord we can do when you are in the
[1:05:04] house of shame you don't do things in
[1:05:06] confidence because you are always
[1:05:09] considering what other people are
[1:05:10] thinking even if nobody is looking your
[1:05:13] mind tell you somebody is looking at me
[1:05:17] you can never do anything in confidence
[1:05:30] praise the Lord if you if you are doing
[1:05:34] anything that you have to look over your
[1:05:35] shoulder before you do it and there's a
[1:05:37] problem there is some kind of a
[1:05:40] confidence problem praise the Lord
[1:05:44] oh there was something that you don't
[1:05:48] want for somebody to see or nobody to
[1:05:51] look at you or who's looking praise the
[1:05:54] Lord
[1:06:07] go call your husband
[1:06:09] I believe she might have just to back
[1:06:15] everything I was trying to hide the very
[1:06:20] thing that put me into this situation he
[1:06:23] goes right there amen
[1:06:29] because if you if you kill the head of
[1:06:32] the serpent an entire body would die you
[1:06:38] deal with the problem right from the
[1:06:40] head he went right to the problem
[1:06:48] because he was just not he was just now
[1:06:51] playing games with her he said I must go
[1:06:53] by the will of Samira it was a daughter
[1:06:56] of Abraham in Samara he wanted to bring
[1:06:59] her out of shame and I believe that's
[1:07:04] what God is doing he's not playing games
[1:07:06] with our life praise the Lord God sent
[1:07:12] this message to give you confidence
[1:07:14] because it tells you where you were
[1:07:17] where you came from and where we are
[1:07:19] going back to that's why God sent a
[1:07:21] prophet to give you a life of confidence
[1:07:30] that's why he promised the Holy Ghost
[1:07:35] people can brag about their degrees they
[1:07:38] can brag about their school the goal
[1:07:39] they can brag about how much money they
[1:07:42] are paid in but if you know that's the
[1:07:44] Son of God that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] praise the Lord and they want to
[1:07:51] intimidate you on the job and are
[1:07:53] intimidated all my goodness if you just
[1:07:56] know how much you caring how much you
[1:08:00] are contributing to this word praise the
[1:08:06] Lord
[1:08:13] he went right down there to to the
[1:08:19] problem go and call your husband and a
[1:08:23] woman answered and said I have no
[1:08:25] husband
[1:08:26] jesus said unto her thou hast said they
[1:08:30] have well said I have no husband praise
[1:08:36] the Lord they have well said I have no
[1:08:40] husband for there have five husband and
[1:08:45] he won't they are now had is near the
[1:08:49] Houseman praise the Lord indeed they
[1:08:55] were there truly amen praise Lord yes
[1:09:01] there's that's the identification of a
[1:09:04] child of God because that's that's what
[1:09:08] he promised to the church the Spirit of
[1:09:10] Truth all in our you know our our
[1:09:17] mistakes in and and foolish things we
[1:09:20] get ourself involved in there's a spirit
[1:09:23] of truth there are predestinated see is
[1:09:26] a spirit of truth that's the thing that
[1:09:29] condemns you that's the thing that
[1:09:31] convicts you because in you where you
[1:09:39] know and you know and praise Lord you
[1:09:50] are you are stammering and seeing or
[1:09:54] there because truth is boiling inside
[1:10:10] and the woman said unto him sir I
[1:10:13] perceive amen
[1:10:19] praise the Lord I perceive the very same
[1:10:24] thing that happened to the Shimon our
[1:10:27] woman when she saw the Prophet passing
[1:10:33] she perceived that were perceived it's a
[1:10:38] word beyond the ordinary I mean it's a
[1:10:48] word it's almost like a visionary word
[1:10:54] praise the Lord
[1:10:58] now like a vision from the Lord but it's
[1:11:01] almost like an envision you know like
[1:11:05] you close your eyes and then you start
[1:11:06] to see someone I perceive and this time
[1:11:13] you're now looking with your your eyes
[1:11:15] is your praise the Lord the one that the
[1:11:26] little children says the devil was
[1:11:27] telling me to take it back and answer
[1:11:30] and something was telling me not to take
[1:11:32] it you perceive from your soul yeah this
[1:11:40] is the truth praise the Lord
[1:11:46] I mean now you see that that did not
[1:11:51] have anything to do with her physical
[1:11:55] condition even if she was right from the
[1:11:59] bed of adultery that didn't have
[1:12:01] anything to do with her physical
[1:12:03] condition
[1:12:10] praise the Lord Jesus never give it to
[1:12:13] her - you always had it she needed the
[1:12:18] right moment she needed that time for
[1:12:22] that thing to come up she needed to be
[1:12:25] in the environment
[1:12:28] praise the Lord if people would just
[1:12:31] keep themselves in an environment of
[1:12:33] reading God's Word
[1:12:34] praying being in fellowship that God
[1:12:37] that is in you will come out praise the
[1:12:44] Lord
[1:12:45] oh it looks like oh that DA that brother
[1:12:51] it looks like he loved the Lord and
[1:12:52] sometimes people just look like he lost
[1:12:55] I wonder how to do it they just keep
[1:12:57] himself in the right atmosphere amen
[1:13:05] that's all she needed start talking
[1:13:09] about Jacobs well I perceive high-profit
[1:13:23] praise the Lord she never went home to
[1:13:29] take shower she was not in her best
[1:13:32] dress she never even knew he was coming
[1:13:36] she were caught right in that state I
[1:13:40] perceived you our prophet our father
[1:13:43] taught us Russian she's going right into
[1:13:46] the scriptures the word praise the Lord
[1:13:59] we're branches
[1:14:00] word that you feel when you read that
[1:14:06] word and makes it with faith and every
[1:14:08] time you say amen to the word the word
[1:14:11] that you feed on one of these days who
[1:14:14] realize that it will materialize and
[1:14:20] become real praise the Lord
[1:14:25] but then you might be needed out there
[1:14:30] are we together now so we realize you
[1:14:38] she said our Father shares you know we
[1:14:45] should wash if she's now she started to
[1:14:48] wash it well what is happing to ride him
[1:14:51] the atmosphere has changed for her to
[1:14:55] perceive that he was a prophet she
[1:14:58] starts to feel the sense of holiness she
[1:15:04] wants to start worshipping praise the
[1:15:07] Lord but what is trying to hold her back
[1:15:11] from worshiping is hashim all the things
[1:15:19] that she knows she have done all the
[1:15:20] things that are the life that she knows
[1:15:22] trying to hold her back but but worship
[1:15:26] is coming from inside of her praise the
[1:15:33] Lord
[1:15:39] and Jesus said unto her woman believe me
[1:15:41] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[1:15:46] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[1:15:49] worship the father praise the Lord
[1:15:53] he worshipped you know network amen
[1:15:58] then Jesus got in it you know talking
[1:16:02] about worshiping or there well you see
[1:16:06] what happened he have exposure to the
[1:16:15] atmosphere liber Branham call it
[1:16:19] contacting hot spirit he mean and she
[1:16:28] was able to allow Jesus to come into her
[1:16:31] house of shame which Jesus said go and
[1:16:38] call your husband he never started
[1:16:41] becoming arrogant and trying to be
[1:16:44] defensive praise the Lord
[1:16:57] she said I have no husband now you might
[1:17:01] look at that and think yeah well well
[1:17:04] Jesus said she was living with a man so
[1:17:07] she lied to the Lord
[1:17:13] she was caught up trapped into a
[1:17:15] situation praise the Lord
[1:17:24] but yes she was able to open up and
[1:17:27] allow Jesus to come into her house of
[1:17:31] shame
[1:17:35] remember birdman talked about those in
[1:17:37] doors he said they are setting those we
[1:17:40] will not want to allow him to come into
[1:17:43] but he want to come into every dose of
[1:17:46] our lives
[1:17:51] praise the Lord
[1:17:53] he want to come coming in you know
[1:17:57] that's there that's that's the kind of a
[1:17:58] man he he was like I was preaching last
[1:18:01] Wednesday it's only the the one that is
[1:18:05] him that don't need a physician he took
[1:18:09] my tea right down there and he started
[1:18:11] eating with publicans and sinners he
[1:18:15] were identified himself praise the Lord
[1:18:19] there is no way that he's embarrassed to
[1:18:21] enter that is the reason why you know
[1:18:28] you find people you know pray Lord you
[1:18:32] know you know my problem he yes he knows
[1:18:34] but he want you to invite him into their
[1:18:37] problem talk about it talk about it call
[1:18:42] the problem by name it has a name it has
[1:18:47] a name call the problem by name when you
[1:18:54] call the problem by name you are
[1:18:56] inviting him into it in a human mind we
[1:19:02] change that all my goodness you know
[1:19:04] what this this this thing is you know
[1:19:06] what it says it's so it's so abominable
[1:19:10] it's almost like the Bible says you know
[1:19:13] what if we are guilty one we are guilty
[1:19:15] you know so if you're taught is guilted
[1:19:18] about thinking about it your Moffatt
[1:19:20] must be guilty about talking about it
[1:19:28] but that is the way to bring him into it
[1:19:31] it's not embarrass that's the reason why
[1:19:35] he could sit right there in Simon house
[1:19:37] and that woman can come in and and and
[1:19:40] fall right there and start praying is
[1:19:42] that he was not embarrassed the people
[1:19:45] that were looking the spectators were
[1:19:47] embarrassed but he was not embarrassed
[1:19:55] and sometimes that's what the devil does
[1:19:59] he makes us embarrassed of our situation
[1:20:02] thinking that you know making us to
[1:20:05] believe that no you can bring that thing
[1:20:08] to God no you can be in that situation
[1:20:10] and go to the house of God while he's
[1:20:13] trying to do keep you in the house of
[1:20:15] shame praise the Lord Jesus said God is
[1:20:30] a spirit and did a worship Him must
[1:20:33] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:20:35] praise the Lord amen oh my goodness I
[1:20:42] can I can imagine Jesus saying all of
[1:20:44] these things and then and she's she's
[1:20:48] she Feeny
[1:20:49] forgetting about her embarrassment she's
[1:20:52] just feeling good
[1:20:53] amen God is spirited I worship him must
[1:20:59] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:21:00] she dropped anything I know the Messiah
[1:21:06] cometh praise the Lord
[1:21:14] she never said this thing
[1:21:16] wishing feet I know them as I cam II
[1:21:20] know I know the Messiah cometh which is
[1:21:31] called Christ and he would tell us about
[1:21:35] these things the word should make you
[1:21:38] aside
[1:21:40] you must be happy for the things that
[1:21:43] you know and the things that you believe
[1:21:45] see with excitement
[1:21:50] now with guessing praise the Lord that
[1:21:56] is the reason why when Jesus said I just
[1:22:00] speak it unto you I am here the Bible

[1:22:08] woman that were just watching watching
