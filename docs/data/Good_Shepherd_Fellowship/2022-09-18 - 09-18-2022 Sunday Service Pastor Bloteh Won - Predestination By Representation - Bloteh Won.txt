to Minneapolis amen Hallelujah could be in the house of the Lord this morning thank you musicians that will be all for the song praise the lord we want to just read a portion of the scripture this morning uh Romans chapter 5 just for the scripture reading to read Romans chapter 5 and then we will take we take our get into what we want to talk about this morning praise the Lord follow a little bit the tape on the on the Sunday School the seed is not here with the shock this morning and yeah brother Brian talking about three women there is talking about uh Hagia the bandwoman Sarah the free woman and Mary the woman of the Royal Sea praise the Lord I think it's important for us to pay attention to those things because uh I mean we the the scripture is a shadow of things speaking of us and we will not understand our our journey unless uh uh praise the Lord unless we understand some of those things let's read that Romans chapter 5 verse 12. I just I just thought about this scripture this morning I was sitting in the office and I says well maybe I might just read that for the scripture reading and then we can quickly get into what we want to we want to talk about Romans chapter 12 chapter 5 did I say 12 5 12 here 5 12. wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death pass unto all men for that all have sinned it for until the Lord's sin was in the word but seeing is not imputed when there is no law nevertheless death Reign from Adam to Moses even over them they had now seen after the similarities of Adam transgression who is a figure of him that was to come Adam was a figure of him Christ that was to come but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be there much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ have abound on too many praise the Lord and that asks it was by one that Senate soul is so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is too many the free gift is of meaning offenses unto justification so what Paul is dealing here with is actually representation by condemnation and representation by predestination so he's saying one man represented the whole word in the beginning but one man's sin Adam falling away from the word we all are honored that condemnation we are all born under thy curse so he represented us there and and one man represented us on the cross of Calvary when he took our sin on him amen so he represented us through him our sin is painful through him the devil had no right to hold us down or hold us guilty for anything only if we refuse his sacrifice then we have to provide our own sacrifice if we refuse why Christ did on the cross of Calvary then we have to provide our sacrifice so what part is dealing here with he's dealing with representation and that is something that is very important that we have to realize every one of us in the building this morning is year by representation praise the Lord amen in a sense to say there was someone that went before us there was there was uh there was a forerunner there was somebody that that made a sacrifice there was somebody that paved the way for us to be here if those Apostles did not give their life we will not have a pure gospel to preach today praise the Lord there are men and women that have stood for holiness and righteousness in the face of all the critics and the mockery because our God is never without a witness praise the Lord so we must we must realize that and if there will be a generation after us it would depends on our stand for the gospel it would depend on the sacrifice we are making now praise the Lord but God is never without a witness 17 for by one man offends death ring by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore asked by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation representation by condemnation or condemnation by representation if we would say that way even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justify unto justification of life praise the Lord amen for us by one man one man Disobedience many were made Sinners so by their Obedience of one shall many be me righteous praise the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father realizing oh God that before there was a word before there was a molecule in your mind you made some representation you took a lamb slain from the foundation of the word and we know that was in your mind the foundation of anything is the beginning father in your mind to be able to bring out your attributes you thought of us you knew that we would be in such a day and age father well we don't know with all of the the political Wars that is around us and we see great uh Russia in China blending together the Iron Curtain and the baboon curtain father we see the U.S having the purple curtain behind her and we see all of these Powers Lord that are playing out and yet oh God we have no idea what is behind the scene what is behind those curtains Lord Russia continuing to church in the world with nuclear power and weapon of blowing the whole world out and in all of that but father we know that God that we stand on your word your word is thou said the Lord father God your bride will be out of here before one of those measures you touch the ground it might be anything down father and that's why we say Lord may you help us Lord and we make the best use of this time that is before us we want to come approach your word now I'm rededicating ourselves and Lord father asking that you would just Lord speak to us this morning dear God we just want to pray father Lord for our loved ones so God and meaning that don't know you in the light of your word oh Father we pray for them this morning we pray to God father Lord for people that are dear to our hearts Lord weak once in the Faith Lord of God people that are being wounded by preachers that have been wounded Lord God father Lord Jesus you know down in their heart they have all some sense of love and respect for you but God the world will just misrepresented to them and they are hurting Lord they cannot trust another preacher neither they cannot trust even the Church Fellowship because they've been so hurt but God this morning we come Lord look into our representation the one that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities God we pray this morning that you will just come now Lord and break your word to us Lord speak to us so Father Like Only You Can we thank you we appreciate you what a wonderful savior you are what a precious Lord just to know o God that we are here by representation you spoke about a bride that's why you have us here you spoke about a people the father that will be living when the Rapture will come a people that will experience the change in their body so father we know oh God as long as this Earth remains Lord there will always be your people that will be standing for you until that day so help us now Lord help us we pray for our children we pray to God for the young ones who God that I stay Lord father in in the walls of their members trying to find the identification Lord and different things that is happening around their lives ones that are still struggling oh god with an error of sin nature oh God we want to bring all of that under the blood now you say father God that we just have access to you through the preaching of your word the sprinkling of the blood Come O God and bless us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat you may have your sick praise the Lord so this morning I want to speak on uh uh predestination by representation so you see why we read that scripture because that's what I had on my mind I didn't hide it in my notes though and I was thinking this morning while we had what we had read for the scripture reading and uh so uh last Sunday we spoke on uh Mary Magdalene in the first resurrection you know I type it like that because uh you know she was the first there and Wednesday night we spoke on the woman called in adultery in the pardon and we realized that the pattern uh is very important to the believer the pardon addressed the guilt praise the Lord the pardon address the the nature of guilt in our hearts that's what the pattern addressed so uh it comes to take out guilt and and when God deals with that because that that's where the curse is Satan is the accuser of the brethrens in why he accused us is because he wants to go and stir their guilt that era of guilt and see if there is any sense of guilt there because if he can make makes you guilty then he has a right to punch you the devil is never Brave to touch you until he makes you feel guilty he cannot touch you with sickness he cannot touch you with anything unless he makes you to feel guilty praise the Lord and so that's the reason why the pardon and we we said uh Wednesday night Jesus said to that woman calling adultery neither do I condemn they go and sing no more it was not just a step and he was making to her he was actually dealing with the guilty nature he was dealing with guilt down in her heart in her soul praise the Lord he was telling her that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ they are passed from Death unto life that is not just a good Bible verse to remember that is what the Christian experience the grace of God want to bring us to the place where we have that feeling in us that there is no condemnation amen we don't feel condemned and then we don't condemn others praise the Lord we don't speak on them because we are not condemned and not because of our effort we appreciate the grace that have come unto us why will you hold something against somebody what right do you have what make you so brave why you want to be possessed of the devil because that's just the devil's work you have your work to do be a Son of God be a daughter of God that's your work don't do the devil's work oh so you think there there is no condemnation unto them that are in Christ Lord thank you I've come in I locked the door nobody else can come in I mean Christ no come to me you are all dead you don't have the key let me tell you you don't have the key since it was not by your choice you kill me you cannot also choose who we're coming and who we're not it's not your choice it's a work of Grace and Let the church say Amen praise the Lord amen so this morning we want to look at predestination uh uh in in in in a different way and we want to look we want to use the woman at the well we want to use the woman at the well but as as I was thinking on on this subject I remember many years back the Lord the Lord helped me to look at this in a way they had a you will see that uh uh the prophet of God make make statements like this listen to this message why he says now remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man otherwise a visitation of the same listen to this now a visitation of the same and if God show his sign at the end to the Jews and at the end to the Samaritan dispensation and let the Gentile get in just on common theology he did wrong he's infinite his first decision how to do anything always Remains the Same now what is he talking about here he's talking about Jesus meeting Nathaniel and says that you you are an Israelite in whom there is no God Amen he said how do you know me he said even before Philip called you when you were under the tree so Jesus was using a gift of discernment right praise the Lord so he said the Jews saw that right amen it was the same thing he did when he met the woman at the well you have five husbands even the man you slept with last night he's now your husband she said son I perceive that you are a prophet but this thing it is what the Messiah is supposed to do when Jesus said I am he she did not struggle are we together so he's he's he he's saying here that the Jews had an opportunity to see that manifestation the Samaritans also had an opportunity to see that manifestation but the Gentile never had it so it was a promise in Luke 17 30 that the son of man will be revealed man amen amen praise the Lord and and and and and that's where we identify the Fulfillment of that scripture in the ministry of the brother Branham because he had the grace to know the thoughts of the people praise the Lord and uh uh in the message the son of the Messiah he says uh just like Abraham and in the 70s he turned his back to the people and said you woman there in a care role your name is this you live into this place it was not just for the public show but what he was doing was trying to show that the same manifestation of the gifts that were to the Jews the same gift that told the woman as a mirror what was her problem this is the same gift that have come to us foreign but you see this is what it is people then I want that's what I want to lay down this morning it's only there predestinated can see it [Music] it's only the predestinator that are elected to see it in every age now this is where we got it wrong it is not only the predestinator that are safe amen no that's why we got it wrong because for many years we think that if people don't believe the message they are not safe you got it wrong your teaching is wrong you got an evil spirit on you amen and you need to go to Calvary praise the Lord because even people in the Catholic church are safe by their faith in Jesus Christ [Music] they are saved by their faith in Jesus Christ that's what the scripture says and that's what our Prophet taught now but it's different when it comes to the elect of the age how did he taught it just like so in a Welling gown or sowing a shirt or whatever you get a cloth and you cut the pattern your measurement that will be able to give you a nice shirt you cut it out of that material the material that I left is the same is just as seen as the one you're going to use for the clothes but you just choose this one because you are being able to get your measurement out of it they are the sea it's just that one is choose praise the Lord amen amen the clothes you are wearing this morning there was some other material that was thrown away the tailor just got your measurement maybe he never even threw it away he just kept it and saw something else for somebody praise the Lord so you see we go around with this notion and we condemn everybody to hell and and then we think now we have we have made a Rapture for the fact that we we are not even understand God's Plan of Salvation shows that we not even started our journey we are just becoming radical we just becoming radical with a misunderstanding in our minds it's only they're predestinated that sees it now so what I want us to do this morning like I was saying many years ago I was I was looking at this and and you know when and and brother Brown said this he he goes over it but uh uh and and and and that's that's the reason why people I say this over and over and which of course is true if I'm not only the only one you know uh this message is out of the scripture is not something out of the Blues praise the Lord the failure of the Christian church is because they have make the Bible a stranger to them praise the Lord if a man or a woman is in the scripture not only to learn to argue or not on it to to learn to prove their point but you are in a word just because you love the Lord and you just want you know that the word is God and you just want to to know him more and get closer to him you will see God every time you read a scripture so we realized that the Samaritans had a visitation the Samaritans had a visitation Luke chapter 10. Luke chapter 10 let's let's go there quickly we got to run through some scripture here this morning Luke chapter 10 and then when you read down you read in Luke chapter 10 you realize you get over to verse 29 now Jesus here talking the Bible says uh uh in verse 25 is setting lawyer through tempting him saying Master what shall I do to inherit internal life then uh Jesus said what is written in the Lord and how rid of doubt there's two different things there what is written and how do you read it it's two different things you can read it completely different from what is written praise the Lord so Jesus is saying what is written and how read it down and he answered Thou shalt love the Lord that God with all the heart and with all that sold and with all that straining with all the mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him they all have answered right this do and thou shall live but but he willing to justify himself so you see he was reading the word not because of what is written but the way he was reading the world was to justify himself so sometimes we read what is written different either with a preconceived mind with a mind just to argue praise the Lord willing to justify himself he said unto Jesus and who is my neighbor praise the Lord now Jesus now will will try to tell him try to tell him who is his neighbor now remember now this was a lawyer he was a strive not a lawyer like a professional attorney there in a court but a lawyer this these are the guys that steady the straws you know the state of the Lord now so Jesus here now bring out the story of the Good Samaritan realizing that he was talking to a Jew there is nothing that hurt a Jew then for Jesus to bring up a story of a Samaritan or to talk about a gentile the Bible says when he said was that was were there not many lepers in Israel but Nehemiah the Gentile General got healed the Bible said they took storms to Stone him praise the Lord but still wash their contacts here he's asking Jesus what is ready in the Lord and Jesus telling him and his preconceived mind he want to trap this man he want to justify he wants to show that this guy is nothing but just a carpenter's son so Jesus take him on a journey I said I said a man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho even by saying that he trembled in his body Jericho wow abomination right yeah and he failed at my own teach and Jesus went on he says in verse chapter one about change there came down and setting priests amen there came a priest secondly there came a Levi and man leaving Jerusalem and going down to Jericho and he and he and he was beating by thieves now this man trying to justify himself you can now see how his mind is running he already left the word if they beat him he looked for it he's supposed to be in the world you have already left the word so whatever happened to him it was so that the priest came and saw him and the priest left him the priest said oh wow a man that is a priest a man that's supposed to be the one that is in charge of a hurting people nobody a religion has told them as long as this man has left church and he's in this problem have nothing to do with him and he was too clean he don't he don't have to get his his his uh uh uh Rob Derek he saw the man he left and Levi and the Lioness that was chosen now see where Jesus was going to see where he was going to the man that were respected by other Jewish people the ones that they look after that kneel the Commandments of the Lord praise the Lord so as Jesus went down he says but then a second Samaritan as he joining came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him and he went unto him and he banned out his wound and pouring oil and wine and he even took him to an inn entrusted him to a man praise the Lord what was the question that he asked Jesus who is my neighbor praise the Lord now the Bible says they are the Jesus saying this to him Jesus said which one of these three think Adele was never to him that fell among the thieves he said he that sure have mercy to him Jesus said then go go and do likewise if you really believe that in your heart go and do likewise praise the Lord but not realize now talking about disposition of visitation you'll realize that Jesus then not just use the Samaritan as a person taught but he was building a story he was trying to show us that even though why it was prophesied that he would be born in Beth's at hand and he would do all of those things he was on his way somewhere and there will be a group of people that will recognize his visitation praise the Lord amen Jesus was trying to show how Mercy will come to the Samaritans by recognizing their day of visitation praise the Lord are we together you have your seat belt on Saint Luke chapter 17. sin Luke chapter 17. foreign [Music] Jesus is also going to deal with a situation here where he will meet ten lepers Hallelujah glory be to God he will meet ten lepers and the Bible says that he will speak unto these lepers and he would tell them that they were claims they should go and show themselves unto the priests you can read the entire scripture when you when you get home and the Bible says they are the verse 15 and one of them when he saw that he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice he glorified God and failed them on his face at his feet at Jesus feet giving thanks and he was a Samaritan it is only the elect that can recognize the move of God India day praise the Lord Jesus healed him and told them go and show yourself to the priests Hallelujah which is uh uh the the Lord of Leviticus for them to go show themselves to the priest and the priest will pronounce them Clint but here is a Samaritan for some reason something in his heart told him that that priesthood in Jerusalem is dead there is a priest glory be to God amen we are building you so just help me bring the stakes to put this building up something in his heart make him to realize that that priesthood in Jerusalem there in the synagoguese they didn't have actually what it takes to pronounce him claims praise the Lord Jesus said Go and show yourself to the priests but he recognized that there was a priesthood that was standing that was higher than the priesthood of Arab is praise the Lord and the Bible said he was a Samaritan I love it when the Bible do that and Jesus answered and said were there not ten claims but where are the nine there are not formed that return to give glory to God save this stranger the other ones was running back to their religious order but this man wanted to give glory to God why he had to do that because it was in a season where God was dealing with the Samaritans there was a move that was going over to the Samaritans because he had to do it to get to the Gentiles he had to pass that way just like now me how to go down out of Beth to him and bring Ruth into Beth to him she had to pass that way because of redemption praise the Lord glory be to God so we see Jesus here building a story about a Good Samaritan which of course that would be completely abomination to the Jews he's pronouncing 10 lepros cleaning giving them the Lord of Leviticus and said Go and show yourself to the priests but there were just one that realized I think this is the priest I think this is the priest praise the Lord I think if this man said I'm cleanse I can take his word now you see you have to realize that every Revival comes at the end of the age when the people finally realize they have a Revival it has already ended praise the Lord every Revival comes at the end of the age when the people really realizing that God is doing something is already at the end praise the Lord Hallelujah so then we get into our stories in John chapter 4. you pick up these little clues in a scripture and your mind starts to think and wonder why why they're aligned and you see the prophet of God talking about Samaritans had their visitation how did they hide their visitation when did it happen well why Jesus was moving among the Jews and healing their sake there were Samaritans and Gentiles that could realize there was a gentile Center and that says don't come to my house just speak the word I'm a man of authority they could realize they could recognize the gift why the people that they give for centuries say he's a vegetable are we together and then we all know the story of this woman of Samira it's in John chapter 4. praise the Lord amen and then if you read this in John chapter 8 you'll realize after Jesus had that confrontation with those men and and tell them if any one of you here do not sin cast the first stone and he went into talking to them about uh you know uh Abraham is not their father they are born from from the sin of of the serpent he says that the devil is your father because he was a murderer in the beginning after that that their entire conversation just read them you know what he told Jesus he said now we realize you have you have a devil and you are even a Samaritan they call him a Samaritan now let's let's just talk about this woman a little bit here this woman of Samira she's the one we want to hold for this inspiration praise the Lord she's the one that we want to hold for this inspiration you love the Lord amen he cares do you kids brother Brown said this before we we get we get on our journey here he says now he did that they're elected we know he did that told the elect on and told the election now there was there was the one who had accepted the gem of life they were the ones who were predestinated to see it they were the ones we are if we believe the Bible we have to believe in predestination that's right not uh God is willing that energy perish but he knows who will receive it and who warned praise the Lord amen exposition of the church ages the same that church it says this illids were not only the internal thoughts of God which were to be expressed in flesh in their due season but this same elect are called by another name what was their name and that is exactly what we have been saying these who are of the royal seed amen now so if you follow the tip that brought up there this morning we were playing the seed is not here with a shot but a man was talking about Hagar he was talking about Sarah and he was also talking about Mary praise the Lord these were the three women through Whom The Seed of Abraham came God promised Abraham a seed praise the lord we know that it was not a natural seed because after Sarah died Abraham married ketoria and had 12 more songs those are the Arabs and all of the people there in the Middle East so every one of them claimed inheritance to Abraham so but the son by whom Abraham will become the father of all Nations is the one that came true Mary and so what he was saying is that the promise that God gave to Abraham from the beginning it looks like a natural promise amen but we realized that it was a spiritual promise when when he got her son it was true sexual relationship of the flesh when Sarah had her son it was the same it was just that or with way far with uh Higa it was a form of adultery because she was a woman that was taken in polygamy that's that's what it is amen and and even even uh uh uh Sarah to whom Isaac was promised she doubted the promise she brought Hagar along praise the Lord but to realize that these women were there like like like the way the prophet said they were there just to transport they were there they were carrier carrier off the sea carry all the promise they had their place amen Hagar was speaking about our flesh this is our Hager the stubborn son that is born Sarah a woman of the promise speaks of our spirit Mary the Virgin birth speaks of our soul the soul remains virgin to God under one seek and go in there it's either Faith or doubt are we together now so that's the reason why when he taught that he says you have to pay attention and speaking about a natural woman but the the message is for the church is concerning the church but we get stuck in a place of the Natural Woman and we take that and and we just became you know uh so rough and rude on women and we think that it's a spirit of Elijah right it's just a misunderstanding of the grace that have come to us but he goes down here and says and and that is exactly what what we were saying these who are the Royal seed are the elects of God are the predestinated for known of God and we're in the mind of God and His Thoughts in a plain language the True Blood of Christ was in the mind of God or yeah was in the mind of God internally do not express until each came forth in their destinated decree season and each member came forth to be expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the rich was spoken word see praise the Lord now and Abraham was teaching there also he said you have to also realize that Mary even though she was a virgin but she was not the seed the seed was Christ so she herself even though she was a virgin it was not a sexual art but she was just a carrier she was just a carrier the Seed of Abraham was Jesus Christ are we together so the I mean receiving the word of the age receiving the Holy Ghost Gonna Make You deceit you have to realize the seed is Christ [Music] you must always keep that place that it is no longer I that leave it but Christ that leave it in me now so we goes on here then uh uh we are in we are over in uh uh see John chapter 4 is a story that we all know beautiful story of the woman at the well amen beautiful story beautiful Story I mean they are just they are just a lot of a lot of texts and context you can take from out of that scripture beautiful story the woman at the well now but there was something I also share with you here uh we we see here that the Bible says and and uh verse 1 there uh when therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees have heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John okay we go through all of that then coming to the city of Samira which is called Sacramento the password of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph and Jacob well was dead and and Jesus and his disciple and they come at a woman of Samira to draw water he said give me to drink praise the Lord so Wednesday night the reason we signed that song this is my story because we read a quote what brother Brandon says if you don't know the story behind somebody's life you could you will not rightly think of them and we all have stories behind our lives praise the Lord the things that make our story beautiful is the grace of God that has come unto us amen praise the Lord is the grace of God that have come unto us the grace of God there there they have they have entered in our story how we God save how we met the Lord that's what made the story better nothing you did in the past that is ever prayed to hear well you never know me I was this I don't even want to know you that way I'd rather know you who you are now so everyone have a story about a brand new in the message uh uh God Rob gave he talks about Rahab he said Rahab the halot they are there there we all are familiar with she's being a young girl that was turned on the street by her hidden father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and she was to bring an income to them is that strange having you hear a story like that praise the Lord right her parents who turn their children on the street praise the Lord yeah because they want them to be be become an income part how to meet one in his age he cast the evil spirit out of her and the whole city ran against him because they were using that evil spirit in her for money but this one was uh uh uh using their child to you know to live a better life and yeah down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard that there was a God who answered prayer that's why she told us price we have heard how your God opened the red seed praise the Lord maybe she was just standing behind and and reading the local newspaper or hearing some men talking about it and in her heart she says I would love to serve a god like that yeah a God that can open the rest praise the Lord that was the thing that made her to be attracted to the spies when she knew that these men were identified with the god that could open the Red Sea the god that fell them in the wilderness with Mana the Nations around in the night they can see the pillar of fire they see light in the fire they could see a circle of light they were eyewitnesses just like there were men that were eyewitnesses that saw those angels flying they're in Arizona and took the picture they couldn't explain it but they knew that every evening there's a light that would come up we can see it from far I think it's those people that came through the Red Sea [Music] I wonder how they are eating somebody said in the morning my food comes down and go out in Tech hmm all the nations around her their story she heard about a God that can answer prayer and the first opportunity she got that's what the elect will do the predestinated in every age the first opportunity at the world because there was something in your heart that was Yearning For Truth right the first opportunity that they have other word they just said this is what I was looking for I can't explain it but this is what I was looking for this is what my soul was hungering for I always wanted truth first opportunity that she got she accepted the god or do something for him she did it and God spared her life and save her father and mother and her family praise the Lord fairly Lord with a Roman general and true Hall came boas the root of David came through that girl because in her was a representation she didn't understand it why she could raise her life when the army of Jericho was looking for those men in her soul praise the Lord amen you can never Master there boy you can never Master it will make you feel odd praise the Lord you always feel like you need something more from God it create a hunger and a constant test for God in your heart praise the Lord so we see that's that's the way it is in every age in every visitation every Revival so just like this woman at the well or just like this rehab was the same with this woman at the well and uh we pretty much see right here that uh she started talking to Jesus she says then the woman at the world verse 9 Omar of Samira how he said that thou being the Jews acts I drink of me which I am as uh I'm of Samira for the Jews have no dealing with us how did she got there that verse write their shows a generation problem the Jews have no dealing it's a generational problem it goes back it goes back to many years when the Assyrians took over because one time Samira was part you remember Ahab was the king of Samira it was power when they said when when the Assyrians capture Israel had a a captivity under the Assyrians they tried to change their identification so over the generation the people started speaking different language and there was a form of Separation that that came between that group so actually the Samaritans they are a mixture of Jews and gentiles but over the years a feeling in the propaganda started going around and saying they have no dealing with us we don't have no dealing so this was a generation crisis and whatever you are dealing with in your body whatever habit is a generation crisis there's something that was handed down to you from your great great grandfather praise the Lord it's trying to take your identity that spirit is trying to make you what it is that was a generation crisis we'll keep that for another time and Jesus said if thou knew the gift of God and who it is that said unto thee give me to drink thou who have asked him and he who have given he identified something if you knew the gift of God that was what that was what attracted what attracts the predestinated seed is the gift of God the predestinated seat is attracted to the gift of God because they know that that give will stay behind the word they are not attracted to a man and his personality praise the Lord if thou knew the gift of God and when she heard that she pay attention and the woman says you don't even have anything and this world is deep from whence comment that Living Water praise the Lord are that greater than our father Jacob who gave us this will to drink and his children in Jesus answered and said unto her whatsoever whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drink out of the water there and and that's and that's the place where we have learned also on the brother Brandon Ministry that all he was doing in that conversation is to contact her spirit praise the Lord he was trying to bring her in the right atmosphere he was trying to have a conversation he says you want to preach to the newspaper man he said talk to him about what is on the newspaper say what is on the news today praise the Lord you want to talk to the cow the the milk Setter ask him how many cows you get a bottle of milk from he said you got to talk about that you got to create an atmosphere so he was contacting her spirit trying to set her because you know that is that is one of the thing that we we have learned and we are learning right praise the Lord and that's what many people don't realize the preaching of the word the preaching of the Gospel the purpose of the word is to contact your spirit because that's word your greater battle is that's where that's what has been mad it has been wounded and like Solomon said a wounded Spirit who can heal praise the Lord so you see her defense her defense to Jesus it was because she has been wounded in the spirit she has given herself to six men and she can trust him praise the Lord I don't believe she what she just wanted to be that useless but she was looking for somebody to love and somebody that would love her back praise the Lord better man will talk the same build a story of the same for this woman he says and one day he was going down to Jericho that's right straight down from Jerusalem instead of going there he had need to go by Samira which the Samaritan was looking for for a messiah too so he came told the city of Sacrament and he sent his disciple away to buy food and while they were gone praise the Lord a little woman came he knew that they would have first started creating doubt because she was a Samaritan secondly they would think why is he around such a woman don't he know that by this time of the day it's only women that are not right can come out praise the Lord he did not want to know hindrance to the move of God he sent him away and he sent his disciple to a way to buy food and why they were gone a little woman came out probably a pretty little woman maybe a child was turned to the street by parents and let her go anyway and about like today praise the Lord and that's what I say is uh you know is is is uh we send our children to school that is that is for academics school don't teach morals so you cannot trust the child he says well I send you to school you know what that we used to hear that back home I sent you to school then you come with pregnancy because because we trust the system we think the system is responsible nobody is responsible you are responsible you the parents you are responsible when it comes to morals and and and and and and and God in that young mind praise the Lord and protecting them you can find the best teacher to teach them all they will learn is just math and science for how to behave themselves around girls or around boys they will not learn it from learning math some of those teachers in a way are perverts so brother Brown says see just by turning her out it just take a common sense of a parent now spending much time with the child that's just the common sense it can be applied to our society maybe the child was turned on the street by her parents and let her go and and about like today they talk about juvenile delinquent delinquent hates his parents delinquencies just exactly what it is maybe that try hard the same thing a mother let her do anything praise the Lord that's our responsibility it is our world's responsibility today the word the fuss about prestigious School it's just a new ticket praise the Lord is just a meal ticket and it brings me down to this hope I can be able to close here before 1 30. you bring me down to this what I said on Wednesday night when you look at the scripture you look through the Old Testament or Through the Bible and we as we're going through the series you get down to to marriage and divorce it sounds almost like you know the Bible was so hard and tough rough and rude on women you think about that but what what people never realize and I will say this to to you this morning and uh to tell you that there is no I've not read in no Christian literature maybe it's out there but I've not read it there is no preacher that have ever brought this subject to light like the way brother Branham did and uh and what the subject is talking about the three sacred virtue that God gave the woman now if you realize that if you realize that uh God empower the man after the fall but before the fall God empowered the woman and that is the place where the word don't see all the me too movement and all the woman liberation sure equal rights is because they don't go back and see there they will not be able to see it because it was only given to a prophet and you have the privilege to know it you have the privilege to know it that God will shut down the entire creation the first time where God will put deep sleep on the earth and you check that word every time through scripture the next time he did it was on Abraham he created a deep sleep to fall on Abraham why because he was making a covenant of redemption he will put this sleep on the entire Earth even the animals will go to bed when he starts to form the woman that's why he says there is no no creature on the earth is like the woman praise the Lord when he starts to form the woman and he will entrust her with three Divine sacred virtue praise the Lord amen he would give it to her as her protection when Paul over there are instructing to me to let a woman keep silence in the church for it's not permitted to a woman to speak he was talking about Authority having Authority which is preaching the word now for you to say Amen okay but what did he says he said she shall be safe that was one of her virtues that was given to her motherhood a man can change his body foreign he can adopt a child you can never be a mother because it's not given to him it was never built in his Gene to be a mother you can buy all the toys and talk like one he can never be a mother is is is is God designed science can't give it to you it's about you that is given to given by God young sisters you have the privilege to know these things it's not taught in school it's not taught in school you have the privilege you have to be a proud child of God you have to be a proud daughter of God that you are taught these things praise the Lord that you will not allow any kind of a stupid ball to sweep you off your face feet and kiss you and defy you just to drop you and then run away praise the Lord you have to be proud of it that the first man I would kiss me would be before the altar if you are not ready to go to the altar you can carry your shining teeth praise the Lord carry your shiny teeth is God God designed God give it to her as a protection you think about it whether in church or out of church a young woman coming up in a in a community in a society she's looking so bright she is appreciated by anybody you think about it what happened the devil starts to raise all sorts of uh uh uh crazy boys around and what they want to do they want to just defy her that's all they want to do and when when that is done she's no longer at the pretty girl again everybody have her news in the in the entire Community why because the devil knows that if he can do that yeah yeah that's the word amen she will not find the strength to be able to make something out of her life unless she has the support unless she has the support praise the Lord and parents will use that instead of realizing that they did not provide protection they will use that and continue on trashing their children down right true okay you did that to yourself and you allowed there to happen to realize she having two movements she's a woman you can build her up back to decency right she can be a decent lady so she can be a mother having a bunch of things here I want to read to you but I'll do it another time time is not allowing us praise the Lord and message Paradox what what makes a paradise is when somebody believed God and take him at his word God word spoke the word into existence that's the same thing that the same thing you have to believe tonight is God's promised word are we together look uh look at that poor little woman standing there at the well she said we know when the Messiah cometh he will tell us these things he had he had told her what her trouble was she says sir I perceive that you are a prophet you know when Amazon we know when the Messiah cometh he will tell us those things watch God talking to a halot glory to God amen and we Sinners saved by grace we will not try we're not there trying to do it but God talking to a Herald we see not saved by grace our first attitude would to despise her God talking to a hall of Glory to God God talking to a prostitute amen and asking a favor bring me a drink think of it pause think of it almighty God what is our attitude we first stop despising them using our eyes to go from head to toe if God will look at us like that would disappear from the Earth talk about a paradox and water Paradox that their sea of eternal life predestinated before the foundation of the word who group out in such a thing as dead by the desired of the flesh how thou poor little woman probably turned on the street but down in her heart she was a she was predestinated to internal life praise the Lord amen and that's where the battle comes young people you you you don't have to make the walls of your body the battles in your mind and in all the battles in your in your in your in your in your flesh and your your your uh you know everything that is happening all of those desired you have you have to you have to you have to draw the Divine line look at the things your soul desire do you really want God you really want the Holy Ghost you really want to be a son of God or you just so overtaking and dominated by the by the desired of the flesh I want a wife and I want it now I want to get married I want my home now praise the Lord is that where you are you have to you have to realize you are coming forth by God's promised word amen you are coming forward by God's promised word and God have all of those things in store for you he have it in store for you praise the Lord amen there are some young women they have you know they have missed fortune in their lives but they have been able to pick up themselves up from the arches and they have made themselves decent and respected women even in their area of profession people respect him why because they help the whole to their virtue of Womanhood they have made themselves decent and respected women they are not going to make themselves a victim praise the Lord so we see Brother Band identifying the other the desire for flesh you know she she she struggled it turned her on the street but down in her heart and she brought a Revival to Samira that in Acts chapter 8 when Philip went to Samira he met people that believed the Lord Jesus it was from this one woman testimony because in her was a predestinated scene I was ready to pick her up pick her up from her wrong praise the Lord she did not care who says what she says come and see the man they have told me the things I have done what have he told you he told me that I had six husbands I don't know how he knew about it even told me the one I slept with she was I mean that is the effect of the pattern when the pattern drops in a destroy guilt you don't order your life by what people think you order your life about what God says about you you don't have to look over your shoulder either praise the Lord you step as a Son of God or as a daughter of God identify Christ in all ages now what what if I'm I'm speaking here to a person that could actually cannot receive it there's nothing in him to receive it but the Bible says she delivered in pleasure is there why she liveth why was it those Pharisees look at Jesus all that we know he was the manifested word of God we believe that the Bible said it was well watch when when he done his Masonic sign the Pharisees that had a little bit of light they had a little bit of light because everything they were doing they were doing that by the Lord amen they had a little bit of light those men that had a little bit of light there was good people they lived a good Christian Life or a good religious life they had a little bit of light about them their heart they have organized in a priesthood they had a little light but down in the bottom of their heart they had no internal representation in glory they can play religion play righteousness pray play better than everybody else but deep down the heart no internal representation praise the Lord how do we know that we have internal representation it is not an emotional feeling right no no it's not an emotional feeling we call it a revelation it's not a dream that you had it's your faith the only thing that we hold ties all to Heaven is our faith praise the lord it's not your dream you hide or the way you feel in your heart it's just emotional praise the Lord but is that fate what's God said I believe you because he said it and the one that said it do not lie praise the Lord I believe it on his child I believe it because I know where I was I know what I am now I believe it and I believe that Grace is able to carry me father on is that fate is that fate it's not a conception it has to be a fate something you hold on in the bottom of the heart they have no representation in glory all they were hauling to is because I'm born of the Trap of Joseph and born of the Trap of Benjamin I'm born on the Trap that's all they were holding to all right that's all they were holding to and holding to Rachel's dressing right and walking right down in the no internal representation so when they're seeing the supernatural done they said that man it's a vegetable a devil how could they reject the very one that they were waiting for the one they call their Messiah you ask them where is the Messiah they would say he had to be God in flesh why they couldn't see it because it's not your intelligence that make you to see it people it's not your intelligence the predestinator see that God deposited in your heart because there are people that are out there that are more smarter than you and what happened when they did that this man is a vegetable and what happened they pulled out they put what lie they had out because they refuse it but yes a little infinite woman a prostitute down in her heart she had a representation of one of God's thoughts that's the reason why he had to go by Samira because one of his thoughts was caught I was just reading setting on this and as I saw something brother Graham said in Masterpiece it just it just it just caught my attention of standing on it and preaching it you know he talks about how God's Masterpiece was kind all of God's children are his masterpiece but we were all scar by sin and scarred by different things some of the things that God will have to pull us out of the abuse and all the things that neglect and things that we went through they have Sky us but you see God watch over that seed in you praise the Lord and he said all that the father has given me will come and I will not lose one down in her house she had a representation of the one God of one of God's thoughts there she was waited in sin heaven with embarrassment on her shoulders she cannot show up with the other women she had the weight of sin burden on her down in her heart it's a representation when the Messiah come he would do these things when Jesus said I am he oh my God there was nothing to stop her there was no wrong that she have ever done that she can be embarrassed of when Jesus said I am he it hit her it went straight down to that predestinated soul and as he rise up in her give her such a strength and she ran down and said come and see the man that have told me the things that I've done praise the Lord people if we would just realize if we will just realize the grace that have come to us in this age this message has not come to wash your mind and make you smarter find quotes where you can run other people down this message this word has come to heal our spirit it has come to heal our spirit it goes out to some of the dark areas of Our Lives the area that only you God and the devil knows praise the Lord come to heal our spirit amen because a wounded spirit who can heal who can heal and most of the time people that have been wounded because those things lay back in our subconscious we take protective measure sometimes on our surrounding or even on our children and we don't realize that we are reacting to the heart we don't realize that why because it's in your subconscious praise the Lord statistics have proven that then there are abused out of 10. the end of abusing others not in an intentional way not in an intentional way they either become overprotective or they just shut everybody out see a person behaving like that a person has been being wounded they just love the dark but he that his son is free in there this word has come to set us free he has come to raise our spirit up praise the Lord amen he has come to raise our spirit up I'll have another time and talk on these three virtues the other things that are concerned the church that I want to bring in in the full light so I'll have a time to talk about it but uh uh that's that's that's a that's that's the representation to realize that every one of us in our past life and things that we have done out of our family we were born in the things that happened praise the Lord we all should talk about things that are happening or growing up and different things I mean we can have it the rest of the year service and we will still not be done we all have a story [Music] we all have a story praise the Lord amen but the beauty of our story the beauty of our story praising the savior all the day alone amen he has changed our story amen that you can we cannot talk about anything of the past we found praising the savior now glorifying the flesh taking the credit or the boss or praising the Savior that Grace has been able to cut us and bring us here is because of that deposit that God put in you face that we have gone through things that we inherited from our our parents that run down through our Jain that we struggle with the down in your soul there's a seed of God there is something that keeps pushing you to God something that keeps pushing you even if you feel so bad and says you know I'm done with that you wake up Sunday morning you're lying on the bed you say what shirt am I going to wear praise the Lord amen and something picks you up is that seed of God yes is that thing inside wanting you even if you never had the best of father they want to make you a better father if you never have parental love or care something inside you is telling you I want to be better praise the Lord you are not looking to the past to make excuses musician you can come you're not making look into the past to make excuses or I grew up this way well that's the way I grew up no you are fine the hope you find the source you have found a fountain that's giving you the desire to be better praise the Lord to realize [Music] that God in his Mercy will teach us these things and we get down to uh the mauritian devil series brother Branham will start to speak there and say because of misinterpreted to your logic the church instead of pointing us to Christ they all took their form of Doctrine many of us [Music] grew up for all of these different things but God has come in this dead and age he has come in our time while we are still alive we breath in our body
