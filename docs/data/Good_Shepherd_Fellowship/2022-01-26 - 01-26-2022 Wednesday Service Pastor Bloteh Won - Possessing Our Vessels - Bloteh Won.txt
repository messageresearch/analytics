first testimony reading from verse one furthermore then we best you brethren and assault you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how you are to walk and to please god so you will abound more and more for you know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus for this is the will of god even your sanctification that yes you extend from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel all her vessel in sanctification and honor praise the lord let's pray together father we just want to thank you again that we have the opportunity to read your word and lord god and uh it's written that heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never fail so dear lord we just want to ask tonight of god that you will come oh god father and and bless uh a few verses that we have read tonight we might read other ones law but we ask the lord you will take this tonight father and bless you to our hearts of god take every um spirit lord god or saying of destruction away father and dear god may we be able to receive from you tonight we just love you we appreciate you father in jesus name amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you amen uh uh josh that's your cursing okay good to see you young man and it's gonna be in the house of the lord tonight praise the lord now we've been talking about what we've been talking about amen and we keep talking about what we've been talking about praise the lord amen just just to remind you now this whole subject you know started from crossing over jordan and going into uh our promises to possess our inheritance praise the lord to possess our inheritance so i want to take a little talk tonight just a little talk to talk on possessing our vessel remember now we're talking about possessing our inheritance you know so we want to speak tonight on possessing our vessel incentivification and honor for possessing our vessel we want to use that they are taught to knight in and were and where they taught goals on on tonight is that i was going i was going to read uh setting biblical historical things to to us tonight but i will i will i will let that let that go for for for the evening and and just try to narrow down on on on this subject that we we want to talk about so where the thought of the whole thing is coming from we have to remember when we talk about possessing our our inheritance we won't think us as a believer that we must remember now you see we started talking about uh crowns and and rewards and and sunday we spoke about you know god rewarding us for whatever we have done in this body what a good or evil now so because uh uh we realized that uh our bodies were giving to us you know god made us important in this body that we have for him to manifest his attribute you know i was i was thinking about while driving to to church tonight uh um i i read i read through commentaries and and and i listened to different you know writers and and thing but i was thinking about it uh uh to realize that when you read through a lot of uh bible commentary people talk about you know the names of god the greatness of god they talk about the the fall you know they talk about you know uh adam position they have many men out there like brother branham says that how wonderful they're having wonderful knowledge god has blessed him i mean they are men that god has blessed to make a lot of research you know that's why brother branham used to appreciate the scoff of this coffee bible you know but uh to be able to grab this understanding of uh uh god wanted to manifest his attributes you know that god there were attributes in god he was a healer he was a savior you know uh a deliverer and and all of these wonderful attributes even he was a judge you know all of this attribute was in the great intent of spirit but being you know uh [Music] an internal spirit the invisible god there is no way that he could manifest uh you know his attributes all of those attributes that were in him so god now have to now turn to creating you know he had to now turn to making his subjects you know create man in his image and and and everything so the great thought that was in his mind and also that he will be able to have the privilege of manifesting his attributes now so uh with all of that taught you know realizing that our body was given to us for the house of god the temple of the living god and uh and all of that and then when we talk about uh possessing our inheritance i don't want you to look very far from yourself i want you to look at possessing this guy amen possessing this guy praise the lord there's uh uh because just like the thought of god you know uh creating us supporting man that he has made as a spirit man coming down to the dust and forming the dust the clad of the earth and and breathing men into that body just the very thought of that you know uh uh make us to realize that god had a purpose for our body praise the lord and if there are a things of god that we will have to enjoy in this life it has to be in this body now if you were sick tonight you will not be sitting down yet i mean if you were seriously sick tonight uh on uh uh you know uh you know at home uh uh i mean uh you you get to that place where i mean you're shaking and especially when you love to be in the house of god you think about it's wednesday night oh i wish i was there or sunday you know and and all of that you know so when we have limitation in this body it's hard for us to be able to enjoy the full you know blessings the full you know uh uh things that god want to achieve in this body praise the lord so you see where we we we trying to go with this thought uh is is uh is to bring us to the place to realize that you know what god has has he has invited us he has invited us for us to be co-workers with him praise the lord he wants for us to join him and in a way of uh enjoying his blessings in this body he want us to join him in a way of subjecting this body of ours to uh to the word of god because we have to realize that uh uh we we we are born on a same nature we are born on uh uh uh the fault of of our father adam you know so with that with that we realize we are born into the word you know born coming into the world speaking lies so there is a sin nature that we are born with that that is always wanting us or wanting to rob us of enjoying the full blessings of god but you see that is the beautiful picture because god is not living there unto you to be able to do it but he's making himself a partner with you to help us to be able to come to that place and bring the same nature on the suggestion to god amen so uh uh that is just a way of trying to explain what is on my mind to you tonight so as paul talks about this uh uh this thought of possessing our vessels you know uh i thought about god giving abraham the promise of possessing the gates of the enemy praise the lord and uh uh you know and and joshua and and and the spires going to the promised land you know and and possessing their inheritance and driving out uh you know the canaanites and and all the knights that were there amen the jebusites and all of those guys that were in the promised land god sending caleb and joshua and the men of israel to go and possess the slain but you see in all that god was doing the thought that was behind god's mind was coming to us praise the lord amen was coming to us in the sense that we we we don't have a physical land amen we're not going to to fight against another nation we are not going to fight against another tribe or uh no he was he was laying principle he was laying shadows in in the scriptures so when it comes to our time we will realize that we have a land and it's this body amen we have a land that uh god wants us to be able to enjoy his blessings within praise the lord he wants you uh uh as a young man to be able to find bring yourself in obedience to god's word you know when and and uh when now you are in obedience to god's word and now you have the grace to be able to make a choice you know uh a choice for work even choice for family you know i mean if you don't if you don't have yours you you know you don't have yourself on the suggestion to god's word how are you going to rule your home praise the lord how are you going to rule your home and even as a young woman so you see all the promises you talk about you think about the guiding of eating and and and before sin came in and adam and eve living peaceful you know and all of that you think about all the promises and the blessing you know that is that that god speaks about in his word and and uh uh for us to be able to enjoy it i mean it's not just uh uh uh uh stories for us to read you know and just and justice our mind it's a reality the holy ghost is real the promises of god are real amen god is able to bring you you see when i when i read that uh a portion of the statistics that i read on sunday morning like i said i was using that as a bed you know to be able to to to grab your attention and and and draw you into what i wanted to speak about but you see uh we realized that uh uh uh you know is is the order of the day you see the life of young people you see family life you know uh uh being distraught in and and and all of that is it even sometimes it makes uh young people you know without the spirit of god they are so afraid what what to do you know try to imagine what the future is going to be but uh god is faithful amen just like i said we cannot say amen to that because that is statistics that man has gathered praise the lord we can say amen to god's word praise lord we can say amen to god's word because god has taken people from from from ugly past and people you know uh uh uh even think about the apostle paul he had a blood on his hands he has stephen blood on his hands because he had their cults and he gave the order for stephen to be stoned to death but yeah he's one of the greatest man in the scripture the man that was entrusted the mysteries unto the gentiles praise the lord god turned his life around or i would like to talk about paul one of these days there are a lot of things i've been i've been i've been looking at in the scripture and being being studying about oh my goodness what a life that he had praise the lord amen so you see where we're going we are going with this stuff because just like i said if you know if we put our hearts in it not just to come and have a good service and not to be a good speaker and you being a good listener and say oh i enjoy the service tonight but if we grab what the holy ghost want to do and bring and and to bring us you know into a life of dedication i'm telling you we can have a pentecost here amen we can have a pentecost i mean god can come in in in in an amazing way and just and just pour his spirit in our lives you know and just raise us above the things that we are struggling with all the mind battles and the bad feelings and and all the negative things that is going on god can raise us above it because it's a promise he says when the enemy come as a floor the spirit of the lord will raise up a standard and that's tender is for god's people praise the lord he even he either raise you up on the standard or he makes you the standard he raised you up to be the standard praise the lord so as we as we look at this subject of possessing our vessel there's a place i want to go tonight there's a place i want to go tonight now remember now we're talking about rewards we're talking about crowns and and we're talking about possessions inheritance and all of that praise the lord amen i want to go somewhere tonight with this you know when when we were we were sunday we we took a uh a quote from the sixth seal that we were reading talking about brandon reward the prophet of god reward there was there was something there was a word that stood out to me as there's a phrase that brother branham said he used the word they're recalling angel it caught my attention amen caught my attention and then uh i thought i said well okay uh uh i'll go i will read a little bit and see uh uh you know what what we can be able to pick up from there so tonight i want to i want to talk about uh this possessing our vessel which have to do with our body now in in the book of james james brought it in a very beautiful way you know and the way he brought it is that a man that can control his tongue is able to bring his entire body praise the lord amen can bring his entire body on a suggestion so you see possessing you know our vessel to identification i want for us to start with the least element which is the tongue praise the lord are we together i want for us to start with the least element which is the tongue are we together tonight now i remember that i said this will be a a bible study don't turn it into a preaching service because if you turn it into a preaching service i won't know how to stop are we together praise the lord amen now let's let's look over in the book of matthew let's look over in the book of matthew i won't hold you alone tonight i pray not to unless you allow me to but i thought it was it would be good for me to allow you to see where i'm going praise the lord amen because i'm i'm telling you this is not just uh you know the pleasure of taking the topic to come and speak to you there is something that i have on my heart as you know uh uh believing that the lord will will will be able to to do you so you know we we are using january to sow a sea for this year because we i don't know what this year holds you know i don't know what is going to come again you know and uh they might shut the churches down and and and all of that and you know and we have to stay home and you know and everything uh you know i was telling a family last night i had something on my on my notes uh i never noticed them but it was part of my study you know uh uh for on on sunday and what what actually it is is the other i was i was thinking about you know uh uh the scripture paul speaks there you know you know to the corinthians and he's telling them you know uh you know encouraging them and correcting them and he and he made this statement he says you know a young man or a young woman that is not married they have they having more time for the lord than the young then the young woman and all the young men that is married now it does not means that when a young person is now married or you know young or older person is not married they are more spiritual he's just talking about the time you have on your hands so i was going to drive into that a little bit on on sunday i don't know how he slipped away from me but uh uh the the talk there is that uh you have the time now to make yourself a better son of god you have the time to make yourself a better daughter of god praise the lord you know it's always this thing where people you know uh like to put things up for the future i mean you know maybe if i get married i would get serious you know if i'm settled down i'll be serious if you can do it now you will never do it [Music] you will never do it praise the lord you will never do it and now uh uh uh you know uh uh the thought also goes in a sense that it's not that the the one that is married uh you know uh uh uh don't have time for the lord but here is here is it yes here is the the the mystery that is under the marriage covenant man god is going to now now you you you have moved up to a level where god is is not going to deal with you not only through your life but through the life of your husband through the life of your children praise the lord amen he's going to deal with you and now you i mean you have to you have to take care of your husband or take care of your wife you have to take care of your children you have to work you know you get all of these responsibilities and and and and but god is still dealing with you praise the lord so the the the concept of what i had on my mind you know it was it was to be able to you know uh uh encourage the young people you know uh i mean uh uh god is the one that uh uh separated the feminine you know nature from the from the masculine nature and and make man and make woman praise the lord amen and uh and he knows the desire of of of every one of your hearts so what what you must be looking for now be looking be sick in the lord praise the lord amen be seeking the lord i mean you know if you just sit down there and worry all the time is passing i'm now marrying and and i mean if they give you the the marriage and the house and everything what are you going to do is that going to be the end of your life you see where i'm going with the thought you know it's it's not that it's a bad thing you know but paul is saying that why now get that thing get that you know get that cornerstone down get that solid foundation get a stand with god that tomorrow when you when you have a family and there is trials and and there is trouble you know it's not going to sweep you up because you have a solid foundation with the lord you have a relationship with him it's all in the thought of possessing your vessel praise the lord you don't allow people actions to control your vessel praise the lord you know so all of that all of that okay so i think uh i forgot about that but i redeemed myself tonight so let's take let's take this uh matthew chapter 12 and see where we want to go to tonight by the grace of god praise the lord now you have to remember matthew chapter 12 in my two record was a very very important junction in jesus ministry you have to remember that now if you if you have said it before and you have to remember it's a very major junction in jesus ministry and what this junction is this is the place where jesus felt the rejection amen this is where he felt the rejection this is where they call him belsible they call him son of the devil are we together so in response to that in response to the rejection and the the the the insult of the people jesus took a turn in his ministry and it started from right here from this time jesus never spoke to the to the public again every time he spoke it was in parables matthew 13 will start the parables every time he spoke it was in parables now so watch here praise the lord verse 25 and jesus knew they had taught and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation in every city or house divided against itself shall now stand and if satan casts out saturn he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if by bestiable if and if i by bestiable cast out devils by whom do your children cast him out amen therefore they they shall be your judge you you you can see how you know how just just watch the language the way that he's even responding to them the sense of rejection a man that did nothing but healed their sick amen fell the the ones that were hungry but if i cast out devil by the spirit of god he says then the kingdom of god is come unto you or as how can one enter in a strong man house you know when he goes about and he he talks he talked about all of that verse 31 he said wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blaspheming shall be forgiven unto men but the blaspheming against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiving him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiving him neither in this world neither in the world to come praise the lord are we together now so jesus year he see he's he's he's kind of for bringing uh a strong judgment on uh people speaking against the things of god amen people you know speaking against the things of god or uh because you have to realize that uh uh uh this is a mystical body there is very little that we know of what is happening even as we are in church tonight there is very very little we know of how the spirit convinced men of sin of how god deliver his children from habit how he claims our lives there is very little we know about it and whosoever speak at a word okay let's let's go a little bit neither either make a tree good or his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his full corrupt for every tree is known by this fruit all generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the moth speaketh a good man out of out of the good treasure of his heart bringing forth good tidings and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth for evil things but i say unto you that every other word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment so in one sense god is going to reward us for every word that we speak so you see how it's important for us to be able to bring this body on a suggestion we have to deal with this little guy called the tonga for by the words for for by thou words thou shalt be justified and by thy words there shall be condemned now you can see how god almighty god the god that is rich in mercy you see he he never he never leave us without consolation amen he always have a way to comfort his people and god will do things through the ages to be able to help his children praise the lord now let me let me let me let me just talk a little bit here on uh on our dear sister uh uh head right and and hope in her songs which of course we we all know the story but think about it she was a widow and she had to bring us those two boys you mean trying to do the best that she can and jerry said that i mean they're they are teenagers and you know and and they're having peer pressure and and everything following you know uh their friends and and all of that and and you ever said her heart is crying out you can just think about uh the sons of zebedee their mother coming to jesus and even asking jesus oh lord let my two sons when you come in your kingdom said one on your right and another one on that's that's a mother's heart that goes for her for her babies and you can just think that and brother branham giving that challenge and saying ask whatever you will for her to for you know uh uh clear out everything from her mind whatever need that she need her sister sick in the we cheered and bound there and then all the needs for her to be able to just block everything and ask for the salvation of her boys it tells you how much she had them on her heart praise the lord but you see it never just came by just asking for the salvation of her voice it came by what she said from her mouth praise the lord which of course we know the word is a taught express brethren i'm talking testifying about speaking those scores into existence she was not there praise the lord amen she didn't ask for uh uh a physical proof now look at the scene here let me let me show you the scene right here right in that conversation warner brother branham deacon's brother tony he said brother branham he says if god if god if god show it to you you know it have to be there and brother branham says i pick it up he said brother tony are you doubting me he says i pick it up since i knew our brother was an earnest brother but you you know the the prophet of god who just could just speak that little sense of doubt but years to watch woman here yes so we watch woman no position in the church and i mean she's one of the least and a single mother struggling with her boys and she just said brother branham that's nothing but the truth now the thing about it there is that she was it was it was not like brother branham was just talking to her alone there were a lot of people there and again i don't believe that she was the only one that knew that that was the truth there were a lot of people that have experienced the gift of god healing and different things they have witnessed in brother branham life to know that what he was saying it was the truth but why did god pick her among the many praise the lord are we together tonight every other word that a man speak every other word you think about it young people if signs signs the invention of men can be able to create you know uh uh equipment by which they can be able to pick up a video if there was an accident on this road they can be able to do whatever whatever by the satellite or by the camera on the street they can be able to to zoom that video down to be able to see what actually happened then you think about the god that make man praise the lord now so it's it's not just you know if if if men will be rewarded for other words that they speak i also want to encourage you that we will be rewarded if we seize in our words with grace because the apostle paul said we must seize in our conversation with grace praise the lord god rewarded our sister in this life with the salvation of her boys with the salvation of her boys now people have their their you know their their their thought and their explanation what happened to haiti rise on and you know all all of these information sessions i want to go on youtube and google and sasha or haiti raw boy what happened to them did they say in the faith before they died and you know and then all of this they don't mean nothing to almighty god praise the lord because salvation is a free gift it's a free gift it meant nothing to god to give salvation to the thief on the cross and says let me let me see everything that you have done in your life oh i'm not going to give it to you until your last birth even though you're saying this i will wait until because i don't know if you are going to change your mind praise the lord so you see we will get to to the james chapter there maybe not tonight or another time you know you you will see that how very important it is brother brahm talks about elisha the bible speaks about it but a prophet of god pick it up and talks about elisha and you know calling the bed on those children because of them insulting him or teasing him and all of that and brother branham said that is because they heard their parents talking you know that cranky prophet who know that where he came from brought her in and all of that now so you you realize that because of the things that they said god rewarded them that way yes a woman because of the thing that she said god gave her the salvation of her children praise the lord think about solomon being young and david getting old the throne is now threatened even before uh solomon came on the scene you know you have to remember it was the the prophet mitten that instructed david that solomon is the one that inherited the throne but david loved his son absalom he was one of david's favorite the bible say he was a handsome man with a lot of afro on his head praise the lord amen he didn't find the bible so his head caught him in the tree his own hair hang him but solomon being young and you think about it the history of his birth what everybody knows and the throne being threatened and and and the prophet will now install him to be a king this young boy young boy went crying before god lord how can i do this i'm just a young boy how can i do it your people are great but the things that he said the things that came out of his mouth the things that came out of his mouth tells the thought that was on his mind the things that we say oh i i just made a mistake i don't even know how i said it no it's generated from our thoughts just a young boy saying oh god oh god if young people would take that
