[44:09] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[44:12] the kingdom of God that which is born of
[44:16] the flesh is flesh and that which is

[44:23] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[44:25] his word praise be to God shall we be
[44:32] seated God bless you all for coming
[44:36] tonight um it's been a tough week so
[44:39] far but the Lord is mindful of
[44:42] us and it's always a blessing to come
[44:46] before his throne of grace in spite of
[44:49] the work Lo in spite of the the
[44:54] demands in spite of the difficulties um
[44:57] the things we have to go through that we
[45:00] can still make it a point to come to the
[45:02] house of God when the doors are open
[45:05] praise be to God I know that are a few
[45:07] that would still go to work but even
[45:09] then they try to tune in um we thank God
[45:13] for what technology has done for us
[45:15] praise be to God and um very very very
[45:19] grateful to see every one of you and uh
[45:22] we are just here to encourage ourselves
[45:24] and tonight we are just going to talk
[45:27] praise the Lord yes um I just went into
[45:31] something I had down I didn't know where
[45:35] to start from I just picked something
[45:38] from the beginning went to the middle
[45:40] picked something went to the end and I
[45:43] picked something and put all that
[45:45] together I don't know how that is going
[45:47] to come together praise be to God the
[45:51] intention is not to finish uh of course
[45:54] uh what I have extracted I hope to can
[45:57] come to an end of I mean bring it to an
[45:59] end but um hopefully by the time we are
[46:04] done talking I believe you may have
[46:06] heard the voice of God in one way or the
[46:08] other praise be to
[46:10] God the days are getting to
[46:14] ahead
[46:16] time is running
[46:20] out when you are used to listening to
[46:23] news I don't listen to
[46:27] news per se but there is a place that I
[46:31] can trust their news so much that once
[46:33] in a while I go in and I listen to what
[46:36] is going
[46:37] on and I remember telling
[46:40] brother um Tim when he came around that
[46:45] scientists have discovered that the core
[46:48] of the
[46:51] Earth stopped spinning in the direction
[46:55] it was going
[46:57] and I liked the way the the news caster
[47:02] put
[47:04] it what the newscaster said
[47:07] was the
[47:08] Earth has a change of
[47:13] mind because it stopped spinning in the
[47:16] direction the the that is the core the
[47:19] the the the the core of the Earth
[47:21] stopped spinning in the direction it was
[47:24] spinning and now it is spinning in the
[47:27] opposite
[47:28] direction and
[47:30] science has no clue what is going on
[47:34] apart from coming to that
[47:37] realization that the core of the earth
[47:40] is no longer spinning in the direction
[47:42] it was
[47:46] going so I was just saying that even the
[47:50] Earth has to realize that there is no
[47:52] time for it and the Earth has changed
[47:56] its mind
[47:57] mind how about me and you that are
[48:01] walking on this Earth and that are
[48:03] looking forward to building um a castle
[48:07] on this earth when this Earth has
[48:10] already started folding ITS
[48:18] m
[48:20] time is running out so fast
[48:26] we have heard this time and
[48:29] again till we hear it and it doesn't
[48:32] mean anything to
[48:34] us time is running out oh I have heard
[48:36] it a thousand
[48:38] times Jesus Christ is coming very soon
[48:41] oh I have heard it a thousand
[48:44] times I was a year old when I started
[48:46] hearing this and I'm 40 I'm 50 I'm 60
[48:49] I'm 70 and he hasn't
[48:53] come time is not on our side
[48:58] when you get up in the
[49:00] morning it's good to do an
[49:04] introspection examine your life on a
[49:07] daily
[49:12] basis Search Your
[49:16] Heart if there is anything to repent of
[49:19] repent of it don't wait till another
[49:22] time that another time may not come I
[49:26] have heard stories of people just being
[49:28] in the in the in in the in in traffic
[49:30] and there is a stop sign or traffic
[49:33] light red they stop and that is where it
[49:36] ends and I told you guys of a story if
[49:39] it wasn't for the grace of God I
[49:41] wouldn't have made it home that day when
[49:44] I stopped and my heart just I don't know
[49:47] you know the story praise be to God so
[49:52] if there is anything to repent of don't
[49:55] wait till tomorrow
[49:57] tomorrow may never
[50:00] come when you go before God
[50:04] remember sometimes we think we are
[50:06] before another man remember you are
[50:09] before
[50:10] God he is looking in the inside he sees
[50:14] you as you are as a man think in his
[50:17] heart so is he God sees you inside out
[50:21] there is nothing to hide before him so
[50:23] what have you got to
[50:25] hide when you go before God get
[50:34] clean everybody is dealing with one
[50:36] thing or the
[50:38] other the fact that you are dealing with
[50:40] something doesn't
[50:43] mean that you are not a child of
[50:48] God God wants you to be better he wants
[50:52] to make you a better
[50:55] person count yourself worthy count
[50:59] yourself
[51:00] blessed if God counts you worthy to put
[51:05] something in your life to deal with
[51:09] it God has also given you that strength
[51:12] to overcome
[51:15] it God wants us to see his
[51:20] glory it doesn't come on a silver
[51:24] platter the Bible says that Christ Ed
[51:26] obedience by the things he
[51:31] suffered and the Bible says that if any
[51:33] man comes after him he should take up
[51:36] his cross daily
[51:40] daily and follow him praise be to
[51:48] God it's good to take stock of our
[51:52] lives and you can see where you are
[51:55] going by the grace of God God when you
[51:57] compare yourself to the
[51:59] word
[52:00] tonight I have just taken a little
[52:03] subject as I said we are just going to
[52:06] talk and I have titled it dimensional
[52:13] influence I was listening to the message
[52:18] demonology and I got to a place and
[52:21] something came it's been a
[52:24] while that I I don't even remember
[52:27] anymore but I started writing and when I
[52:31] started actually I was looking at a
[52:34] threedimensional
[52:37] influence a threedimensional
[52:41] influence that man is a tring being you
[52:44] have a body Soul and Spirit living the
[52:47] three
[52:48] dimensions God works in three the devil
[52:51] Works in
[52:52] three and that was where I picked up
[52:55] from but for nice service I thought I
[52:59] should just um go a different way uh so
[53:04] um bear with me and pray for me praise
[53:07] the
[53:08] Lord
[53:09] so as we have just
[53:13] read verily verily I say unto
[53:19] thee except a man be born of water and
[53:22] of spirit he cannot enter into the
[53:24] kingdom of God this was when Nicodemus
[53:27] asked the Lord Jesus can a man go back
[53:29] into his mother's womb and be born again
[53:31] the second time praise the Lord and he
[53:34] went on to say that that which is born
[53:36] of the flesh is flesh and that which is
[53:38] born of the spirit is spirit so we have
[53:44] a physical world and we have a spirit
[53:51] world
[53:53] now do not confuse
[53:57] the spirit
[53:59] world with a spiritual
[54:02] Kingdom the kingdom of God is a
[54:04] spiritual
[54:08] Kingdom that aside we have a spirit
[54:12] world praise the
[54:15] Lord
[54:17] now God gave man five senses and I'm
[54:21] talking of
[54:23] mankind praise the Lord God gave
[54:26] everything every man every woman five
[54:29] senses and these five
[54:32] senses are given to us to contact this
[54:36] physical
[54:38] Dimension now you can see you can hear
[54:42] you can feel you can taste you can smell
[54:47] these are the five
[54:48] senses and these senses influence our
[54:53] lives greatly
[54:58] they are
[54:59] physical but they influence our lives
[55:07] greatly what you
[55:09] see influences your life so
[55:14] much that is what adverts are
[55:18] about when you are driving on the
[55:21] highway and you see a
[55:24] billboard maybe with some um nice meal
[55:29] sometimes you are not even
[55:31] hungry but as soon as you see that your
[55:33] eyes go on it and then it communicates
[55:35] you to your brain and then then you
[55:39] realize that you are
[55:43] hungry
[55:44] signs have noticed that and they are
[55:47] cashing in on
[55:49] it so the things you
[55:53] see influence your life
[55:57] so so
[56:00] much and also the things we
[56:04] hear that is why we ought to be careful
[56:08] what we give he to as much as we ought
[56:11] to be careful the things we
[56:15] see I remember at work once upon a time
[56:19] it was just the beginning of this year I
[56:21] went to a place to place an order and
[56:23] then when I was seated with that
[56:25] gentleman
[56:27] a lady walked in and I saw his eyes
[56:30] scanning around her and I was looking at
[56:32] him like this and when he turned to
[56:36] me I said what were you looking
[56:39] at and then he saids
[56:45] something I said that was
[56:49] wrong he said no I mean he's just I mean
[56:53] some funny funny stories
[56:57] and he tried to argue and I told
[56:59] him your
[57:02] motive the motive behind the looking is
[57:06] what makes it
[57:08] evil I say it is not just you looking I
[57:12] said the motive you have for looking I
[57:14] say it's what makes it
[57:16] evil and then he said no you are right
[57:19] you know sometimes it's
[57:21] amazing that you can even talk to
[57:23] unbelievers the way you do
[57:26] and they don't get so much
[57:29] offended that sometimes if you want to
[57:31] talk to a brother or a sister you have
[57:32] to fast and
[57:35] pray so they don't get angry who are you
[57:37] to talk to me that
[57:40] way so we ought to be careful the things
[57:43] we see the things we look at it is not
[57:48] everything you
[57:49] see that you should give H
[57:54] to you can pick up a spirit just like
[57:58] that and you would have to deal with it
[58:00] for the rest of your life if God does
[58:02] not help
[58:06] you so the see the things we see
[58:09] influence our life so so so much and we
[58:13] ought to be
[58:15] careful pray for God to anoint our
[58:20] eyes that we can see through the
[58:24] lens of God
[58:27] that when you look at something and you
[58:30] know that no this is not what a child of
[58:32] God should be fisting on take your eyes
[58:34] off
[58:37] it don't go looking at it
[58:42] again so
[58:44] oh the brother said maybe if you look at
[58:48] it the second time that is when there's
[58:50] a problem so since I have my eyes on it
[58:53] for the first time let me just stay
[58:54] there you are a dead
[59:00] man praise the
[59:03] Lord if it is not pleasing to
[59:06] God it should not be pleasing to you
[59:10] remember who you are that you are a
[59:12] child of God you are here to
[59:16] express praise be to God God before the
[59:21] people God is counting on you and me
[59:26] he knows he has a people here he is
[59:29] counting on you and me I have not gone
[59:31] any anywhere at all praise the
[59:36] Lord the things you hear has so much
[59:39] influence on
[59:40] you the music you listen
[59:44] to somebody can just listen to some
[59:47] music and then they get up out there and
[59:49] they get a gun and they start shooting
[59:51] people because the music says they
[59:53] should go out there and kill and you you
[59:56] see them behind their cars and then they
[59:58] are just relaxed and you hear Boom Boom
[1:00:00] Boom and they behind the steering wheel
[1:00:02] and you wonder what it is that they are
[1:00:03] listening
[1:00:06] to but they enjoy what they listening
[1:00:11] to so all these five senses the teste
[1:00:15] you have the feelings your feelings
[1:00:18] influence your
[1:00:22] behavior so when you look at these five
[1:00:24] senses
[1:00:26] they are not given to you to contact
[1:00:33] God these five senses are given to you
[1:00:36] to contact this
[1:00:38] Earth how be it sometimes we want to use
[1:00:43] that to contact God we serve God based
[1:00:48] on the things we see we serve God based
[1:00:51] on what we hear we serve God based on
[1:00:55] our feelings
[1:00:58] that is why sometimes you can just tell
[1:01:01] yourself oh I know I am a child of God
[1:01:03] because you just feel like it another
[1:01:06] time when you don't feel like it then
[1:01:07] you begin to wonder who you
[1:01:11] are your
[1:01:13] feelings should
[1:01:15] not dictate your relationship with God
[1:01:19] it should not dictate your work with
[1:01:23] God it is just a physical or a natural
[1:01:27] element that is giving you to contact
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:31] Earth praise the Lord as I
[1:01:35] said oh I I we praise the
[1:01:43] Lord okay
[1:01:45] now so we are talking about a
[1:01:48] dimensional
[1:01:51] influence and the three dimensions in
[1:01:54] which man lives so as the prophet of God
[1:01:57] told us or taught us there are seven
[1:02:01] dimensions and we live in the first
[1:02:04] three
[1:02:07] dimensions praise the
[1:02:10] Lord and even the first three dimensions
[1:02:14] as physical as they are they also come
[1:02:17] with their
[1:02:18] influence when you talk of time time
[1:02:21] comes with its own influence things you
[1:02:24] know today
[1:02:26] or probably okay I just started school
[1:02:29] today so I don't know much by the time I
[1:02:32] get my U my bachelor or my masters now I
[1:02:37] know a
[1:02:38] lot that now becomes an
[1:02:41] influence I'm just born I'm just
[1:02:43] crawling I have nothing I'm just a child
[1:02:46] I don't know what I'm doing I grow I
[1:02:49] have a mind of my own and that changes
[1:02:51] my life I mean we can go into that but
[1:02:54] that is not even where my attention is
[1:02:56] tonight there is a place I want to get
[1:02:58] to and that is my motivation tonight and
[1:03:02] that has to
[1:03:04] do with the fourth
[1:03:08] dimension praise the Lord so time has
[1:03:12] not been our friend it will never be our
[1:03:14] friend and it's not going to be our
[1:03:16] friend tonight so I am just going to do
[1:03:20] some little exercise here praise the
[1:03:24] Lord okay okay
[1:03:28] so
[1:03:30] now when you look at the Spirit
[1:03:35] man man has a soul he has a spirit and
[1:03:39] of course he has a body the spirit man
[1:03:43] is also given five
[1:03:48] senses and they are
[1:03:50] reasoning memory conscience affection
[1:03:55] and Imagination
[1:04:01] now the physical is
[1:04:04] given to contact the
[1:04:08] physical and the spiritual is also given
[1:04:12] to contact the spirit
[1:04:15] world note that the five
[1:04:20] senses of the spirit are not giv you to
[1:04:24] contact God
[1:04:26] they are not giving you to contact the
[1:04:28] kingdom of God they are giving you to
[1:04:32] contact the spirit
[1:04:36] world there is only one thing that is
[1:04:40] given you to conquer the kingdom of God
[1:04:42] and that is in your soul and that is
[1:04:48] Faith when it comes to the five senses
[1:04:51] of the spirit it Wills a lot of
[1:05:00] influence if I don't know if we can take
[1:05:02] them one by one if time would permit us
[1:05:04] we'll do it now when you take
[1:05:09] imagination you would ask yourself how
[1:05:12] can my spiritual sense of
[1:05:16] imagination how can I use it to contact
[1:05:19] the spirit
[1:05:20] world sometimes we wonder sometimes we
[1:05:23] ask questions
[1:05:26] now you can be seated here right
[1:05:31] now and not be
[1:05:34] here you can be seated here
[1:05:38] physically but then you can engage your
[1:05:42] sense of
[1:05:44] imagination and you are anywhere in the
[1:05:47] world but this
[1:05:49] place that you have such a wild
[1:05:53] imagination that it doesn't matter what
[1:05:55] what we say here you will walk out
[1:05:58] through these doors and would not
[1:06:00] remember
[1:06:02] anything sometimes you can sit down and
[1:06:06] then you begin to imagine things and it
[1:06:09] gets so so
[1:06:12] real till sometimes you can begin
[1:06:14] shedding tears you get so
[1:06:19] emotional and it's just your sense of
[1:06:22] imagination that is at work
[1:06:25] you have entered into the spirit
[1:06:28] world you just entered into the spirit
[1:06:34] world that somebody can just walk to
[1:06:37] you and come so close to your face and
[1:06:41] you don't even know they are
[1:06:43] there because you are absent in the
[1:06:49] body it is such a
[1:06:53] strong it it C so much
[1:06:57] influence on
[1:06:59] you you can take memory your sense of
[1:07:03] memory you can go down memory
[1:07:06] lane and then pick some
[1:07:10] trash in your laundry
[1:07:12] basket and then you relieve
[1:07:19] it can you
[1:07:21] imagine that before you met Christ or
[1:07:24] before you gave your life to Christ
[1:07:26] the life you lived or even when you
[1:07:28] started your journey what you went
[1:07:30] through nothing to be nothing to be
[1:07:32] proud about and sometimes you can just
[1:07:35] go down that memory
[1:07:37] lane and then you pick those things
[1:07:40] up and then you are living in
[1:07:42] it you just went right back into the
[1:07:45] spirit
[1:07:52] world you have just gone into the spirit
[1:07:58] and so does
[1:08:02] reasoning you can just sit
[1:08:05] down your mind will pick something and
[1:08:08] then another thing and then another
[1:08:10] thing then you keep going and you keep
[1:08:14] going and you don't even know how you
[1:08:16] got to where you
[1:08:20] got that is how powerful these senses
[1:08:24] are
[1:08:27] and sometimes again we want to use them
[1:08:32] to contact
[1:08:35] God sometimes we want to use these
[1:08:39] spiritual senses to contact
[1:08:43] God we want to just imagine God we want
[1:08:47] to imagine our Salvation we want to
[1:08:50] imagine just raisen raisen things out
[1:08:56] just try to fantasize with things in the
[1:08:58] spirit and want to use that to serve
[1:09:08] God a dimensional
[1:09:12] influence and all that I'm doing is to
[1:09:15] get to the fourth
[1:09:18] dimension praise the Lord that is where
[1:09:21] all my interest is
[1:09:24] tonight not not so
[1:09:26] much about any Dimension tonight my
[1:09:31] interest is actually so much on the
[1:09:35] fourth
[1:09:39] dimension in the message leadership 1965
[1:09:45] 1247 look here you are a outward person
[1:09:51] you have five senses that contacts that
[1:09:54] outside body God gave you five senses
[1:09:56] not to contact him your Earthly home see
[1:09:59] taste feel smell and hear then you have
[1:10:04] a spirit on the inside of that and it
[1:10:08] has five Outlets conscience love and so
[1:10:10] forth five Outlets that you contact the
[1:10:14] spirit world with that but with your
[1:10:18] spirit your physical contact is the
[1:10:20] physical your spiritual contact is the
[1:10:23] spiritual but inside of of that you've
[1:10:26] got a soul the soul is that Gene that
[1:10:30] comes from God praise the Lord now I
[1:10:34] just um talked a little about some of um
[1:10:39] the spiritual senses and um how you can
[1:10:42] just you
[1:10:44] know forget of yourself and W into the
[1:10:47] spirit without even realizing you did
[1:10:49] praise the Lord now
[1:10:58] inside of the
[1:10:59] Soul you have either Faith or
[1:11:03] doubt and the only way we know you can
[1:11:06] contact God Is by faith and Faith also
[1:11:11] has a lot of
[1:11:13] influence praise the
[1:11:17] Lord
[1:11:19] Faith would make you dress
[1:11:23] differently faith in God
[1:11:26] would make you speak a Heavenly
[1:11:29] language faith in
[1:11:33] God would make you see life completely
[1:11:39] differently faith in God would order
[1:11:43] your
[1:11:44] footsteps that even though you have the
[1:11:47] right to go anywhere you want to go but
[1:11:50] because of the faith you have in you
[1:11:53] based on the word of God There Are
[1:11:56] Places you would never carry yourself
[1:12:04] to
[1:12:07] Faith would make
[1:12:09] you see
[1:12:11] something and turn on the other side
[1:12:15] because something in you tells you that
[1:12:17] this is not
[1:12:22] right faith has so much
[1:12:29] influence that people would look at your
[1:12:32] life sometimes they'll make fun of
[1:12:36] you but that does not deter you because
[1:12:39] you know where you stand and what you
[1:12:41] have
[1:12:43] believed that is what faith
[1:12:46] does it doesn't matter what they do you
[1:12:48] are not going to conform to their norms
[1:12:56] faith has so much
[1:12:59] influence they will look at you and say
[1:13:02] you have lost it and yes you indeed have
[1:13:07] lost it because you have to lose your
[1:13:09] mind to get the mind of
[1:13:11] Christ because they look at your life
[1:13:14] and they can't just put that together
[1:13:16] with what everybody is doing that they
[1:13:18] think is all
[1:13:23] right faith in the word
[1:13:26] praise be to
[1:13:29] God would bring you to that
[1:13:32] place where this world and all its
[1:13:35] fantasies and what have you would not
[1:13:37] mean anything to
[1:13:39] you that is how much faith
[1:13:44] is the prophet of God said is the super
[1:13:49] sense not the five senses of the body
[1:13:52] not the five senses of the spirit but
[1:13:55] faith in your
[1:13:57] soul hanging on the word of God praise
[1:14:01] the
[1:14:02] Lord and God has given us
[1:14:07] Faith to contact
[1:14:13] him
[1:14:17] now the fourth
[1:14:22] dimension has a lot
[1:14:26] of influence on
[1:14:31] man now remember that
[1:14:35] influence can be positive and it can be
[1:14:41] negative so you can be
[1:14:44] influenced positively or
[1:14:50] negatively the fourth
[1:14:52] dimension is a very very busy Dimension
[1:14:57] there is a lot that is happening in this
[1:14:59] Dimension and it's happening so so
[1:15:04] fast praise the
[1:15:08] Lord this
[1:15:12] Dimension is a
[1:15:14] gateway either to heaven or a gateway to
[1:15:21] Hell we are getting into it praise be to
[1:15:24] God
[1:15:25] the fourth
[1:15:27] dimension is a
[1:15:30] gateway either to heaven or to
[1:15:35] hell but it is certain certainly a
[1:15:39] Gateway the Bible says broad is the way
[1:15:43] that leaded to
[1:15:46] destrction that way is not here in
[1:15:48] America it's not in Asia it's not in
[1:15:51] Africa it's not physical it's not in any
[1:15:55] of the first three
[1:15:58] dimensions it is
[1:16:00] spiritual that Dimension is in the
[1:16:02] fourth
[1:16:04] dimension straight is the gate that
[1:16:07] leaded to
[1:16:09] life it is not physical it is spiritual
[1:16:13] and that lies right in the fourth
[1:16:17] dimension as to whether or
[1:16:20] not that your life on Earth comes to an
[1:16:24] end and you go to The Fifth Dimension or
[1:16:28] you go to the sixth Dimension depends on
[1:16:31] what you do with your
[1:16:34] life in this fourth
[1:16:39] dimension
[1:16:41] remember we live in the first three
[1:16:44] dimensions we don't live in the fourth
[1:16:48] dimension but the fourth dimension has
[1:16:51] so much influence on us that it is not
[1:16:55] even possible to live our lives without
[1:16:58] it it has so much influence on
[1:17:05] us and that
[1:17:09] determines what we do while we are still
[1:17:12] alive and that determines where we go
[1:17:16] when this life comes to an
[1:17:17] end whether to the fifth or to the sixth
[1:17:23] Dimension the Fifth Dimension is for the
[1:17:26] lost
[1:17:27] souls the sixth Dimension is for the
[1:17:30] redeemed Souls Souls that are redeemed
[1:17:33] praise be to God so what is this we are
[1:17:36] talking about here
[1:17:43] tonight God
[1:17:46] operates in the fourth
[1:17:51] dimension God operat there
[1:17:55] and also the devil operates in the
[1:17:57] fourth
[1:18:00] dimension remember it is a spiritual
[1:18:05] Dimension God is a
[1:18:08] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:18:11] Worship in spirit and in
[1:18:13] truth the devil is also a
[1:18:20] spirit they don't live in this first
[1:18:22] three dimensions
[1:18:26] they are in the fourth dimension which
[1:18:28] is a spir spiritual Dimension which is
[1:18:31] just all around us it's a
[1:18:33] dimension it is not a physical location
[1:18:37] that we can say that oh this is the
[1:18:39] first Dimension up to this this is the
[1:18:40] second dimension this is the third and
[1:18:43] this is fourth that you know the
[1:18:46] geographical location of it no it's a
[1:18:48] dimension is all around us right here
[1:18:54] right here it's a dimension God is here
[1:18:59] right now in that
[1:19:01] Dimension the devil is here in church
[1:19:03] right here in that
[1:19:06] Dimension you can sit in church
[1:19:09] tonight and may walk out of the doors
[1:19:12] without receiving anything why because
[1:19:15] you didn't enter into that Dimension to
[1:19:16] receive
[1:19:18] it for you to benefit from it you must
[1:19:22] get into that Dimension to be able to
[1:19:24] tap into the blessings of God to receive
[1:19:28] it you must enter
[1:19:32] in but when you come and you are still
[1:19:35] in your physical
[1:19:37] element and you are still sitting down I
[1:19:39] mean um it doesn't matter what they
[1:19:46] say you may walk out of the
[1:19:49] door and you don't even know why you
[1:19:51] came
[1:19:55] the
[1:19:56] blessings are in the spirit for you to
[1:20:00] be able to tap in and get anything you
[1:20:03] must just go in
[1:20:06] there so God operates in the fourth
[1:20:10] dimension the devil also operates in the
[1:20:14] fourth
[1:20:15] dimension praise the
[1:20:20] Lord now
[1:20:26] God will take His prophets or his
[1:20:28] servants into this
[1:20:31] Dimension to give them
[1:20:34] Visions to give them
[1:20:37] prophecies and to give them dreams about
[1:20:40] things to
[1:20:41] happen or things that are going to
[1:20:48] be this is where God takes them to show
[1:20:52] them these things
[1:20:58] the Bible says that the angels of the
[1:21:01] Lord have encamped right about
[1:21:06] us they are around
[1:21:09] us when you take a step out there they
[1:21:12] are with you they are around you the
[1:21:14] reason you can't see them is because
[1:21:16] they are in that they in that
[1:21:20] Dimension your eyes this eyes here
[1:21:23] cannot see
[1:21:25] anything in that
[1:21:26] Dimension except God opens your eyes to
[1:21:31] see it you cannot see
[1:21:33] it that is why we don't believe that sin
[1:21:36] is
[1:21:37] believing the fact that I don't see it
[1:21:39] doesn't mean it is not
[1:21:43] there when Elisha's PR I mean when
[1:21:45] Elisha Elisha's servant came out one
[1:21:48] morning early morning and he saw that
[1:21:51] they were surrounded by the Syrian Army
[1:21:53] and he run ran in and he told the
[1:21:56] prophet oh there is
[1:21:58] trouble we've been surrounded by the
[1:22:00] Syrian Army they are here to take
[1:22:04] us elishah
[1:22:06] said they that are with us are more than
[1:22:10] they that are with
[1:22:11] him that didn't make any sense to him he
[1:22:15] didn't know what that was he didn't know
[1:22:18] what that meant and go Elisha prayed and
[1:22:22] asked God to open his eyes so he would
[1:22:24] see
[1:22:25] and when he went and looked again praise
[1:22:28] be to God he
[1:22:30] saw angels on chariots ready to go to
[1:22:37] war they were there in that
[1:22:42] Dimension so they are there they around
[1:22:45] you never think you
[1:22:47] alone the fact that you are not seeing
[1:22:50] them doesn't mean they are not there if
[1:22:52] God should open your eyes to see praise
[1:22:54] be to God but a lot of the times that
[1:22:58] doesn't
[1:23:00] happen but they are there in that
[1:23:02] Dimension all around
[1:23:06] you in this
[1:23:10] Dimension there are
[1:23:13] angels that we keep bumping into
[1:23:17] them here and there without even
[1:23:19] realizing
[1:23:20] it the Lord Jesus told his disciples
[1:23:23] that this words I speak they are spirit
[1:23:27] and they are
[1:23:29] life now
[1:23:31] listen
[1:23:33] 1963 0606 show us the father in that
[1:23:37] message the prayer of God said when
[1:23:40] Jesus Christ spoke these words they
[1:23:42] never
[1:23:44] die science claims in 20 years from now
[1:23:48] they can pick up the literal the the
[1:23:52] literal voice
[1:23:54] they can pick up the the the literal
[1:23:57] voice they will be able to pick up the
[1:24:00] literal voice of
[1:24:02] Jesus is still in the
[1:24:05] earth CU see is
[1:24:09] ascending post you
[1:24:14] are then there has to be a receiving
[1:24:18] post and if you can be a receptacle see
[1:24:23] receiving post to
[1:24:25] receive the word of
[1:24:28] God so the words that the Lord Jesus
[1:24:33] spoke they are still
[1:24:36] here because they are
[1:24:40] Spirit a man comes and he does
[1:24:43] everything he has to do his time comes
[1:24:46] to an end he goes but the things he says
[1:24:49] are left behind they don't go away they
[1:24:53] don't die words don't die words are
[1:24:56] Spirit the words that the Lord Jesus
[1:24:58] spoke they are here in what dimension in
[1:25:02] the fourth
[1:25:06] dimension not in the first not in the
[1:25:09] second not in the 10 not in the
[1:25:13] fifth not in the
[1:25:15] sixth in the fourth dimension those
[1:25:18] words are here they are spirit and they
[1:25:21] are in that spiritual Realm
[1:25:26] I think we are doing good on time praise
[1:25:29] the
[1:25:38] Lord
[1:25:40] so the pr of go goes on to say it's it's
[1:25:44] real and then he says that Abraham
[1:25:48] picked that
[1:25:51] voice you are going to have a baby by
[1:25:54] Sarah your
[1:25:56] wife praise the
[1:25:59] Lord have you ever
[1:26:03] wondered I was thinking about it
[1:26:07] today that you in the house maybe doing
[1:26:10] some cleaning or maybe you are
[1:26:13] cooking or maybe you are meditating upon
[1:26:16] the word or maybe you are at work or
[1:26:20] maybe you are just behind your steering
[1:26:22] wheel and then all all of a
[1:26:26] sudden your mind picks
[1:26:29] something a
[1:26:31] word and an inspiration just comes over
[1:26:34] you and that sweet feeling that sweet
[1:26:38] feeling that anointing just comes and
[1:26:41] then you just you just begin to shed
[1:26:44] tears and sometimes you cry like a baby
[1:26:48] and you don't even know why you can just
[1:26:50] tell you just broke into that
[1:26:53] Realm you just broke into that realm it
[1:26:57] is not
[1:26:58] physical praise be to God something just
[1:27:02] happened to you you had an Angelic
[1:27:08] visitation God just paid you a
[1:27:15] visit praise the
[1:27:19] lord we bump into the spirit of God just
[1:27:23] every day of our life
[1:27:27] praise the
[1:27:35] Lord
[1:27:37] now this is where it gets more
[1:27:42] interesting that we are not only bumping
[1:27:45] into
[1:27:47] angels and into good spirits or the
[1:27:50] spirit of God but we are also bumping
[1:27:54] into
[1:27:56] demonic uh
[1:28:02] demons
[1:28:04] demons the Bible says in Ephesians 6:12
[1:28:08] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:28:10] but against principalities against
[1:28:13] Powers against rulers of Darkness of
[1:28:15] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:28:18] in high
[1:28:21] places these are the forces
[1:28:24] we are wrestling
[1:28:26] against we are not only bumping into
[1:28:30] angels and bumping into the spirit of
[1:28:32] God we are also bumping there was a time
[1:28:36] I think it was somewhere last year a
[1:28:39] colleague came to work and then he
[1:28:41] showed me something on his phone he said
[1:28:45] his phone vibrated he had um a a
[1:28:48] doorbell a
[1:28:50] doorbell camera and then his phone VI
[1:28:54] ated and then he looked outside there
[1:28:58] was nobody outside so he went back to
[1:29:01] bed when he woke up the following
[1:29:03] morning he said let me check my phone
[1:29:05] and see the phone
[1:29:08] vibrated probably there was a deer or
[1:29:10] something that came close and when he
[1:29:12] looked at it it was something
[1:29:15] else you know what it was just like the
[1:29:19] form of a human being that looked like
[1:29:23] smoke
[1:29:24] that was just pacing
[1:29:27] away from the camera in front of his
[1:29:30] door just pacing
[1:29:32] away and he just see my camera my dog
[1:29:37] camera just picked up a
[1:29:40] spirit and I started wondering how many
[1:29:44] times do we run into such
[1:29:49] atmosphere that you don't know what you
[1:29:51] are getting
[1:29:52] into that you you are just walking with
[1:29:55] your eyes on you don't see anything
[1:29:58] around you and then you are walking into
[1:30:00] things like this it's amazing what God
[1:30:04] delivers us
[1:30:06] from we don't know what God delivers us
[1:30:10] from this is not to put fear in
[1:30:13] you if those things could do anything to
[1:30:16] your life you will not Beed here
[1:30:19] tonight the fact that you are here
[1:30:21] tonight shows that they did not have any
[1:30:24] power over you and they will not have
[1:30:27] any power over
[1:30:31] you we are Sons and Daughters of the
[1:30:33] almighty God our father knows what is
[1:30:37] ahead of us even before there was time
[1:30:40] and he has made Provisions for
[1:30:42] it you don't have to worry about
[1:30:45] that we have enemies out there praise
[1:30:49] the Lord your enemy is not your brother
[1:30:53] your enemy is not your
[1:30:55] sister we have enemies out there to
[1:30:57] fight we are wrestling with spiritual
[1:31:00] forces evil spirits these are the forces
[1:31:04] we are fighting against can you imagine
[1:31:08] living this life without Christ can you
[1:31:11] imagine living this life without
[1:31:15] Christ why you are wrestling with evil
[1:31:19] spirits you are
[1:31:21] wrestling with forces of Darkness you
[1:31:24] are wrestling with
[1:31:26] principalities forces you don't
[1:31:29] see it's even
[1:31:32] unconventional for them to put a boxer
[1:31:34] in the ring and put a spiritual boxer
[1:31:37] and in and ask them to fight it's going
[1:31:40] to be a oneway
[1:31:41] fight I don't know how that is going to
[1:31:44] look
[1:31:47] like so can you imagine that you are
[1:31:51] fighting forces That You Don't See
[1:31:54] but we should be thankful to
[1:31:56] God that the barrle is not ours the
[1:32:00] barrle is the Lord's barrle he is the
[1:32:03] one doing the
[1:32:04] fighting just make sure that you stay
[1:32:08] with the
[1:32:09] word it doesn't matter how much the
[1:32:11] Devil Comes roolling
[1:32:13] Around stay under the umbrella of the
[1:32:17] world and see the protection of
[1:32:22] God praise the Lord
[1:32:24] so in this in this in this
[1:32:27] Dimension there is a lot of good things
[1:32:30] happening and there is also a lot of bad
[1:32:34] things going
[1:32:37] on in the message enticing spr 1955
[1:32:41] 0724 just recently even cancer has been
[1:32:46] declared to be a for Dimension
[1:32:50] disease so even sickness sickness and
[1:32:54] diseases are fourth dimension
[1:32:58] diseases and brother BR said that
[1:33:01] sicknesses are what
[1:33:03] demons they are demons you cast out that
[1:33:07] devil the sickness
[1:33:12] goes so in this
[1:33:17] Dimension there are
[1:33:19] sicknesses there are diseases
[1:33:24] that we are fighting against there are
[1:33:25] demons forces that we are fighting
[1:33:31] against and this is just the spiritual
[1:33:33] side of things now when we go
[1:33:38] further this Dimension is also a
[1:33:41] dimension of Science and Technology
[1:33:44] there is a lot going on in this world
[1:33:48] through Science and
[1:33:51] Technology there is no way
[1:33:54] of telling what goes on in this
[1:34:00] Dimension because no man can see with
[1:34:04] his eyes what is going
[1:34:10] on but what we cannot see in this
[1:34:15] Dimension science and technology has
[1:34:18] made it possible for us to see it what
[1:34:22] we cannot hear in this Dimension science
[1:34:25] and technology has made it possible for
[1:34:28] us to hear
[1:34:30] them because they have developed
[1:34:33] machines and gadgets and technology that
[1:34:37] by tele the use of television now there
[1:34:40] are there are there are
[1:34:42] pictures that are going through this
[1:34:45] wall there are voices that are going
[1:34:48] through this
[1:34:50] wall but they is so fast that we cannot
[1:34:54] see them with our Naked
[1:34:56] Eyes but they are
[1:34:59] here the Olympics is going on right
[1:35:05] now if you want to be part of it all you
[1:35:08] have to do is just get your phone go on
[1:35:12] the website or get a television station
[1:35:15] L onto the channel once you get that
[1:35:19] channel the picture comes to you
[1:35:26] you tune into a radio
[1:35:29] station K
[1:35:32] KT um there's one channel I love so much
[1:35:36] you just tune in
[1:35:40] and you catch everything they doing real
[1:35:44] life they don't have to record it on
[1:35:46] anything to send to
[1:35:49] you but before you tune in to that
[1:35:52] channel those pictures were just flying
[1:35:56] around before you tune in to that radio
[1:35:59] station those voices were just going
[1:36:04] around somebody can sit somewhere in
[1:36:07] Africa and be part of today's
[1:36:09] service all they have to do is go on
[1:36:12] YouTube go on um our website and then
[1:36:17] catch this event and they are listening
[1:36:19] to it and watching it in real time
[1:36:25] and all this is happening in the fourth
[1:36:32] dimension all this is happening in the
[1:36:35] fourth
[1:36:37] dimension
[1:36:49] now
[1:36:51] I have a code here
[1:36:59] there is the Lord um let me see where to
[1:37:02] start
[1:37:17] from I think I lost the part of
[1:37:21] this I lost the part of of
[1:37:24] this but uh what the prophet of God is
[1:37:26] trying to tell us here is that
[1:37:29] um just as we tune into a particular TV
[1:37:34] station or a Channel or radio station
[1:37:37] I'm just paraphrasing them now um to
[1:37:40] catch a
[1:37:42] program um he's saying
[1:37:46] here that there is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:50] the resurrected Son of God standing here
[1:37:54] and the reason that you can't see him is
[1:37:58] because our house hasn't become tuned
[1:38:02] down to
[1:38:04] it and the reason we can't see the
[1:38:07] television pictures our bodies are not
[1:38:10] set as in as instruments to pick up
[1:38:14] mechanically mechanical sent things but
[1:38:18] when our body becomes in tune with God
[1:38:21] becoming a part of him then our soul can
[1:38:24] pick up the power of the Holy the Holy
[1:38:28] Spirit to vindicate the presence of the
[1:38:31] Lord Jesus Christ and all of his power
[1:38:35] and
[1:38:36] omnipotence he has risen from the dead
[1:38:40] he lives among us
[1:38:42] today and he wants Fellowship back with
[1:38:45] his people again his great Majesty his
[1:38:49] glory is now spreading forth and he's
[1:38:52] Desiring to Fellowship again with
[1:38:56] his Fellowship by
[1:38:58] Redemption PR praise the Lord like in
[1:39:02] the Garden of
[1:39:03] Eden
[1:39:05] so as we just tune
[1:39:08] in
[1:39:10] scientifically whether on the on on the
[1:39:13] internet whether on the television
[1:39:15] station whether on the radio to catch a
[1:39:18] real time a real time
[1:39:20] program the prayer of God is saying that
[1:39:23] the Lord Jesus is in our midst here and
[1:39:29] now the reason why we don't see him is
[1:39:33] because we have not tuned down into that
[1:39:39] Channel Once you tune in into that
[1:39:42] channel it's a spiritual
[1:39:45] Channel you are going to see him you are
[1:39:48] going to hear his
[1:39:50] voice praise the Lord
[1:40:03] in the message Fellowship by Redemption
[1:40:06] 1955
[1:40:07] 043 in the four dimension people can
[1:40:11] prove that right through this building
[1:40:13] now radio is going okay I just we we
[1:40:15] just um talked about that um so now you
[1:40:21] look at it
[1:40:25] there is no television here or should I
[1:40:28] say a television station right here that
[1:40:32] if there was a program we could tune in
[1:40:34] and get the program so because we have
[1:40:36] the television station right behind
[1:40:39] there there could be a television
[1:40:41] station somewhere in
[1:40:43] Australia the farthest end of the
[1:40:47] world and then you can tune in and be
[1:40:50] part of that program
[1:40:55] it is not because that television
[1:40:57] station is here with
[1:41:00] you God does not live is not in the
[1:41:04] fourth
[1:41:05] dimension God is in
[1:41:09] heaven but he
[1:41:12] operates in the fourth
[1:41:15] dimension that you can tun
[1:41:21] in and tap into his blessings you can
[1:41:24] tune in into that Dimension and see God
[1:41:28] you can tune in and hear the voice of
[1:41:32] God like you tune in to catch any
[1:41:35] program around the
[1:41:38] world this Dimension we are talking
[1:41:43] of has become so so so
[1:41:48] dangerous that the devil is using this
[1:41:52] dimension a
[1:41:55] lot against the children of
[1:41:59] God when you look at AI that is
[1:42:03] artificial
[1:42:05] intelligence and what they are
[1:42:10] doing in fact it's it's it's it's just a
[1:42:14] dangerous place to
[1:42:16] be I can't imagine how this world is
[1:42:19] going to
[1:42:20] be 50 years from now if Christ car
[1:42:26] that they are coming out with very very
[1:42:28] dangerous theories and what is the devil
[1:42:31] trying to do the devil is
[1:42:35] trying to just F you with
[1:42:40] technology to get you to sleep
[1:42:44] off get you away from the promises of
[1:42:49] God just kill your spirit
[1:42:53] kill the influence of the white in your
[1:42:56] life all the devil is trying to
[1:43:00] do is take you away from the
[1:43:05] word if the devil can succeed to take
[1:43:08] you away from the word he has no I mean
[1:43:10] you have become a friend and not an
[1:43:14] enemy and now they have their
[1:43:18] version of life eternal
[1:43:23] and what they are
[1:43:25] saying is
[1:43:28] that they can put a person's pictures
[1:43:32] together from their infancy all through
[1:43:36] their life and the things they have gone
[1:43:37] through and then they store
[1:43:42] that you know artificial intelligence
[1:43:45] works with
[1:43:47] algorithms it's not a program you feed
[1:43:50] it like uh we used to have with our I
[1:43:53] mean computer
[1:43:55] programming but with the age we are
[1:43:58] living in if you ask the machine to tell
[1:44:02] you something and it doesn't have the
[1:44:04] answer it goes looking for
[1:44:09] it and they say that the machines are
[1:44:12] sent which means that they are aware
[1:44:15] they
[1:44:18] exist and man is getting to a place to
[1:44:22] hand over his authority to
[1:44:27] machines that one day machines are going
[1:44:30] to rule our
[1:44:31] lives and already they say the dest
[1:44:35] machine is smarter than
[1:44:39] um who is this
[1:44:42] scientist this scientist U physicist
[1:44:48] Einstein he had an IQ of
[1:44:51] 160 and this machine already have an
[1:44:55] IQ of
[1:45:00] 3,500 in Einstein's time when he started
[1:45:04] talking about those
[1:45:06] theories 99% of the world didn't know
[1:45:09] what he was talking about because he was
[1:45:11] in a different
[1:45:12] class and now men are producing machines
[1:45:17] that are going to be 100 times smarter
[1:45:21] than us so why where do we
[1:45:24] stand and then what they are saying is
[1:45:26] that they have their own way of eternal
[1:45:29] life and they say that they will store
[1:45:31] all these things on a machine and
[1:45:37] then your
[1:45:39] grandchildren if they want to talk to
[1:45:41] you they will just come and they go and
[1:45:44] they put your I don't know what it is
[1:45:46] they'll put in and then you would come
[1:45:48] on the
[1:45:51] screen and then your grand child will
[1:45:53] ask you hey Grandpa how are
[1:45:56] you remember he is dead and
[1:46:00] gone he is dead and gone but here your
[1:46:04] grandchildren your great great
[1:46:06] grandchildren would come go on a machine
[1:46:09] and then they'll put in whatever it is
[1:46:10] and then you appear on the screen and
[1:46:12] they'll ask you Grandpa how are you oh I
[1:46:15] am fine Grandpa when you were small at
[1:46:17] this age how was life and then M will be
[1:46:20] talking to you and you are seeing the
[1:46:23] image the picture the real picture of
[1:46:25] your grandparent whom you never
[1:46:29] saw and they say that is their verion of
[1:46:33] eternal
[1:46:34] life the devil will always make sure
[1:46:37] that he gives you a
[1:46:41] substitute he always has a substitute
[1:46:44] for
[1:46:45] you and people are falling for it people
[1:46:49] are falling for it who CL and sinker
[1:46:55] the other day at work I was talking to
[1:46:56] somebody and he told me somewhere in St
[1:46:58] Paul they have um a scientific a
[1:47:02] scientific there's a church that worship
[1:47:04] worships a scientific God I said what
[1:47:07] did you
[1:47:09] say he said there's a church that
[1:47:12] worship a scientific God I said what
[1:47:13] what is a scientific God it's just it's
[1:47:17] just it's just shocking where we
[1:47:20] are it's just shocking where where we
[1:47:24] are anything the devil can throw at us
[1:47:29] he would make sure he does
[1:47:33] it everything the devil has to throw
[1:47:36] against us he will make sure he does
[1:47:40] it and we ought to be
[1:47:44] wise we ought to be
[1:47:50] wise the devil can trap you in this
[1:47:54] Dimension he knows he can't get you to
[1:47:57] disbelieve the word of God he knows he
[1:48:00] can't get you to turn away from the word
[1:48:03] he knows he can't tell you there is no
[1:48:05] God he knows he can't bring that
[1:48:07] foolishness to you that eternal life is
[1:48:10] taking your picture and doing this he
[1:48:11] knows he can't do that but do you know
[1:48:13] what the devil can do he can trap you in
[1:48:17] there that you will spend your precious

[1:51:02] praise the lord the devil is using this
[1:51:06] Dimension so
[1:51:10] much to destroy our relationship with
[1:51:15] God that even when you decide to
[1:51:18] pray you are thinking of some some show
[1:51:21] on the internet
[1:51:26] there are people that can just go all
[1:51:28] through night all through the night they
[1:51:31] can't even keep a job why because they
[1:51:34] are playing games with some faceless
[1:51:36] people people they have never seen in
[1:51:38] their lives and they are playing games
[1:51:40] with
[1:51:41] them and they in the they will just play

[1:51:51] homes it affects
[1:51:53] marriages it affects
[1:51:56] relationships why

[1:52:28] not
[1:52:32] working we ought to have time for one
[1:52:37] another we ought to have
[1:52:39] time keep the technology
[1:52:44] aside we are in that age I'm not saying
[1:52:47] abandon it all together
[1:52:52] some people cannot go a day without
[1:52:54] their phone they will go
[1:52:57] crazy as soon as they get out of the

[1:53:30] Our Lives
[1:53:32] now as if we have no
[1:53:36] life technology is what is dictating
[1:53:38] what we should
[1:53:43] do no wonder people are worshiping the
[1:53:45] god of
[1:53:47] science because that is all they beli in
[1:53:53] there was a story of a little
[1:53:55] child who want start by his mother and
[1:53:58] then he started crying then the mother
[1:54:01] turned to him and said why are you

[1:55:19] it it can make you a better person or it
[1:55:23] can make you a worse
[1:55:25] person all the good things and the bad
[1:55:28] things are out there it depends on what
[1:55:31] you go shopping
[1:55:37] for and sometimes when you go shopping
[1:55:40] you go with a good intention you know
[1:55:43] what you are looking for and the devil
[1:55:45] brings an advert a
[1:55:47] popup and some of us are quick to follow
[1:55:50] it and before you realize oh I didn't
[1:55:53] intend to be here and you are already
[1:55:55] there and your soul is feeding on
[1:55:57] something
[1:56:00] nasty you have to guide against it you
[1:56:04] ought to be a wise son and a wise
[1:56:06] daughter of
[1:56:08] God you have to use the technology don't
[1:56:11] let the technology use
[1:56:15] you know when you are out there know
[1:56:19] what you are fishing out for
[1:56:22] it's a dangerous territory to be
[1:56:27] in that you can be in the Dangerous
[1:56:29] Waters and you don't even know
[1:56:32] it before you aw you are getting
[1:56:40] drowned it's a dangerous
[1:56:48] place don't allow
[1:56:55] anything
[1:56:56] anything that you know deep down in your
[1:56:59] heart that is against the word don't
[1:57:03] allow that to be your source of
[1:57:07] entertainment we ought to be better in
[1:57:10] our work with God on a daily
[1:57:13] basis you get to a place in your life
[1:57:15] you have to take account of your life
[1:57:18] see how far have I come with the Lord
[1:57:20] how many years have I been in this how
[1:57:22] many times have I been going back and
[1:57:24] forth have I made any
[1:57:30] progress am I doing something that is
[1:57:32] pleasing to the Lord am I in his perfect
[1:57:35] will these are questions you should be
[1:57:37] asking yourself on a daily
[1:57:43] basis we should keep consecrating
[1:57:45] ourselves we should keep praying for one
[1:57:49] another we should keep fighting
[1:57:53] because we are here to fight we are
[1:57:55] soldiers in the army of the Lord we know
[1:57:58] no
[1:57:59] defeat praise be to
[1:58:02] God just
[1:58:06] realize that that fourth
[1:58:09] dimension there is a lot that is going
[1:58:13] on already there's a lot of battles
[1:58:17] there do not add to
[1:58:20] it be wise
[1:58:24] when you go shopping in that
[1:58:28] Dimension when I mean shopping I'm not
[1:58:30] talking of going to buy clothes or going
[1:58:32] to buy food when you go there and you
[1:58:34] are you are browsing that's what I mean
[1:58:37] know what you are looking
[1:58:40] for know what you are looking
[1:58:46] for you could get yourself into
[1:58:49] trouble this is not to scare you it is
[1:58:51] the real reality of our time we are
[1:58:54] living in
[1:58:58] it be
[1:59:02] careful do not let
[1:59:07] technology be your
[1:59:10] wife do not let technology be your
[1:59:14] husband do not let
[1:59:17] technology be your
[1:59:20] friend use it
[1:59:23] don't allow it to use
[1:59:27] you the
[1:59:29] devil is behind all this
[1:59:34] trying to kill the influence of the word
[1:59:36] in your
[1:59:39] life and when you get to that place
[1:59:42] where the influence of the word of God
[1:59:44] in your life is killed I wonder where
[1:59:47] you
[1:59:49] are praise be to God
[1:59:53] it's
[1:59:54] 9:23 I think it's a very good place to
[1:59:56] close I would ask the musicians to come
[1:59:59] over as we think over these
[2:00:01] things praise the
[2:00:05] Lord praise the
[2:00:08] Lord thank you
[2:00:11] Jesus praise the
[2:00:18] Lord dimensional influence
[2:00:35] it is the grace of
[2:00:37] God that has brought us this
[2:00:41] far there are a lot of things we are
[2:00:43] going
[2:00:49] through but he that has promised
[2:00:53] that he will be with
[2:00:54] us that he will never leave us nor
[2:00:58] forsake us he is more than able to keep
[2:01:01] his
[2:01:02] word just trust and
[2:01:06] Obey just trust and
[2:01:10] Obey do not let this world have a part
[2:01:14] of
[2:01:16] you we are called to live above this
[2:01:19] world
[2:01:22] we know the Lord Our God in whom we have
[2:01:24] put our trust we are serving a living
[2:01:27] God not the god of
[2:01:30] science that there is life in the word
[2:01:32] of
[2:01:33] God we know better we know
[2:01:38] better we know
[2:01:40] better if we choose not to serve God
[2:01:42] tomorrow we can never blame God because
[2:01:45] we know how loving he is how faithful
[2:01:48] God has been to
[2:01:49] us you look at our lives
[2:01:52] and you can
[2:01:53] tell the love of God in
[2:01:57] you the grace of God upon your
