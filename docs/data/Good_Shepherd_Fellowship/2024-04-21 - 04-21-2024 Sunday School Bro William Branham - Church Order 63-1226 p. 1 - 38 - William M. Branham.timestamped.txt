[0:29] [Music]
[3:26] yeah you be ready to turn them off I
[3:29] motion my head do you like that
[3:31] please keep my motion my head to you
[3:39] [Music]
[3:41] [Applause]
[3:46] you Brethren we've called this meeting
[3:49] together here tonight for the purpose of
[3:53] knowing
[3:55] how that operate the Church of the
[3:58] Living God
[4:00] which we believe to be a part of this
[4:03] church I want to first thing I want to
[4:07] uh
[4:08] say that in my
[4:11] travels around the world so far as I
[4:15] know this is
[4:18] one of the most spiritual places where
[4:23] you feel the spirit of God more than any
[4:25] other place I know I had two other
[4:28] places in mind that used to
[4:30] be but so far we we don't uh seem to see
[4:37] those places one of them has went into
[4:39] the
[4:39] organization and the other has U has
[4:43] kind of fallen so uh I was called uh
[4:49] yesterday and was was told me that you
[4:52] all wanted to meeting to ask me these
[4:54] questions concerning your duties in this
[4:58] church
[4:59] and I um that's what I'm here for
[5:03] tonight is and to to set the church or
[5:07] to give to you the things that I think
[5:09] that that is what's
[5:12] substantial to make this church to
[5:15] continue on Brethren I'm sure that you
[5:19] do
[5:20] realize that as I've made this remark
[5:23] about uh this being a spiritual place it
[5:26] isn't the biggest place in the world and
[5:29] it isn't what we have the most singing
[5:31] the most screaming and the most
[5:32] hollering or the most speaking in
[5:35] tongues and things that isn't it but
[5:38] it's the
[5:39] quality of the spirit that's operates
[5:42] here in this Tabernacle and so far I
[5:45] want to command and thank brother
[5:48] Neville and and you Brethren here
[5:51] trustees and deacons and Sun School
[5:53] superintendent and all for for what you
[5:56] have done and helping keeping this us
[5:59] away it's been a long prayer of mine and
[6:02] a desire since a boy to see the church
[6:05] put in order and kept in order now we
[6:09] dedicated the church I told you a little
[6:12] later I had something to talk to you
[6:14] about how to set this thing in order the
[6:18] way it should be run and um you started
[6:23] off uh after leaving here we had
[6:26] ministers and so forth but now brother
[6:28] Neville being just young Among Us come
[6:31] Among Us I thought it'd be better for
[6:33] brother Neville to get better
[6:34] established in the faith before I
[6:36] presented such things as I'm about to do
[6:39] now but now after I find out that he is
[6:43] uh getting well established in the faith
[6:45] and understands what the doctrine is and
[6:49] and has uh played the part of a faithful
[6:51] witness to Christ and holding for what
[6:54] we believe to be the truth I think it's
[6:57] the hour now would be a good time to
[7:00] approach him and among you elders and
[7:03] things of the church that you would take
[7:07] these orders and remember them they're
[7:09] the best of my knowledge before God and
[7:12] then I'm looking to you to carry these
[7:15] things out the way that I'm saying
[7:18] because somebody has to be a head around
[7:20] here you have to have now I'm not trying
[7:23] to Asser Authority or something like
[7:26] that but you see a man or any anything
[7:29] with two heads to it it it doesn't know
[7:32] how to go God never did have two heads
[7:34] to his church he never did it's one head
[7:38] he always dealt into every generation as
[7:40] we've studied through the scriptures
[7:42] there's always one individual that he
[7:44] deals with because you get two many you
[7:46] got two opinions it's got to come to one
[7:50] final
[7:51] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[7:56] Bible and as a pastor here of the church
[8:00] my absolute is the word and I I know you
[8:04] Brothers you kind of look to me to be
[8:06] your absolute to what as long as I
[8:09] follow God as Paul said in the scripture
[8:12] you follow me as I follow Christ and
[8:15] then I'd expect you Brethren at any time
[8:17] that you see me to get away from this
[8:20] scripture to come to me privately and
[8:22] tell me where I'm wrong I don't care if
[8:24] you're one of the trustees or if you're
[8:26] the janitor whoever you are your duty
[8:28] bounds me as a brother in Christ to tell
[8:32] me when I'm wrong scripturally if it's a
[8:34] question let's sit down and solve it out
[8:37] together and that's why you've come I
[8:39] suppose to me tonight brought me in here
[8:41] is because that there's questions here
[8:43] that seems to be questioning you in your
[8:45] mind for the things that I have have
[8:48] here now remember brotherr I don't know
[8:51] there's no name signed on any of these
[8:53] tickets but and they wrote and I can't
[8:56] don't know who wrote them but there are
[8:58] questions that's on your mind and I'm
[9:01] here to answer them the best of my
[9:03] knowledge and remember God is looking to
[9:06] me to see that I stay in the word and
[9:10] I'm looking to you to see that you carry
[9:12] out the word see in this church and keep
[9:16] it spiritual or remember all the forces
[9:22] of of the dark kingdom of Satan will be
[9:25] turned against you as you begin to grow
[9:28] and the Lord
[9:30] and you must be
[9:31] soldiers not just fresh recruits you're
[9:36] age soldiers now I've been trained to
[9:38] fight and Satan will come among you
[9:41] cause you to dispute with one another if
[9:43] you can turn him down just immediately
[9:46] you're Brethren and it's the enemy and
[9:50] we're here to hold a standard in this
[9:54] evening light time that when the world
[9:57] is darken and the whole Church kingdom
[10:00] is going into the Council of churches
[10:03] and pretty soon they'll try to tack a
[10:06] sign on this door you're
[10:08] closed now we're going to have to meet
[10:11] other places because they'll certainly
[10:13] close these churches one of these days
[10:15] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[10:18] and uh we're depending on staying true
[10:22] to god Till Death sets us free and
[10:25] that's what we intend to do now straight
[10:28] to the and I would ask that if ever a
[10:32] time that any of these things come into
[10:35] question that this tape may be played
[10:38] before the members of this church at
[10:41] your meetings or prayer the meeting just
[10:43] before the meeting starts turn this tape
[10:46] on and play it and may the congregation
[10:49] here understand that these men are Duty
[10:53] bound to God is there oath in this
[10:56] church to help hold these principles you
[10:59] may disagree with them and if I let you
[11:02] run it then I disagree with you we've
[11:05] got to have some Source somewhere where
[11:07] there's got to be an
[11:09] ultimate and the best that I know I'm
[11:12] giv it under the Holy Spirit letting him
[11:15] be my ultimate and let this tape be your
[11:19] ultimate on these
[11:21] questions now the first one is how shall
[11:25] the church act towards calls for
[11:28] financial help
[11:30] of for food and
[11:34] clothing what what act what what should
[11:39] the church do now we realize that the
[11:43] church is responsible for its own for
[11:48] our members here of the church we are
[11:51] totally responsible as far as we have
[11:54] needs to supply them with we are
[11:58] responsible for for our own that's
[12:01] steady constant members of the
[12:03] Tabernacle come here and worship with us
[12:06] we are Duty bound to them as our
[12:08] brothers and sisters who have proven to
[12:11] be our members of this
[12:14] Gathering now we realize that there is
[12:18] millions tonight without food without
[12:21] clothing and we would love to be able to
[12:23] help the whole group of them to do
[12:25] everything we could but financially we
[12:28] cannot do that we can't support all the
[12:31] world but we are Duty bound to our own
[12:35] and I think in that and then if we have
[12:38] anything left over that you would want
[12:40] to contribute to people who are
[12:43] not members here of this church
[12:47] something that you want to give to them
[12:50] it should be met between the the board
[12:54] of the
[12:56] deacons the deacons is the one that that
[12:59] has to meet this opposition or this
[13:02] problem rather because that in the Bible
[13:07] when the dispute come up about food and
[13:10] clothing and so forth in the book of
[13:12] Acts they call the apostles in about it
[13:16] they said go look out for yourself uh s
[13:20] a man of honest report and full of the
[13:22] Holy Ghost that they might attend to
[13:25] these things because we will give
[13:26] ourselves continually to the word of of
[13:29] God and in prayer and it isn't the
[13:32] pastor's duty to look out to the for the
[13:37] food and so forth that's supposed to be
[13:39] by the deacons it isn't the
[13:41] trustees it is the Deacon's office to do
[13:44] this and then this should be remember in
[13:47] the Bible they was contributing to their
[13:51] own the Greeks and the and the Jewish
[13:55] where the argument come up that one was
[13:57] getting a little more than the other but
[13:59] it was people who had sold all their
[14:01] goods and had given into the church for
[14:05] its support and then to to be divided
[14:09] out among them equally and there was a
[14:11] little dispute come up and there's where
[14:13] we got our first deacons and that's one
[14:15] of their duties is to do that I think
[14:19] that as our own as our own people uh we
[14:23] should take care of them and it should
[14:24] be turned in any complaint to the
[14:26] chairman of the deacon board and then it
[14:29] should be met by the Deacon board and
[14:32] see what they're able to do about it and
[14:34] all of those things which is clothing
[14:38] and food and financial help or whatever
[14:41] it is should come through the deacons
[14:43] then the deacons when they decide that
[14:46] they are that they are what they're
[14:48] going to do about it then it should be
[14:51] presented then unto the U the treasure
[14:54] to see if the treasure is able at this
[14:57] time to pay this certain amount of
[15:00] Finance or or buy these clothing or
[15:02] whatever it is to that but the the
[15:04] Deacon board should meet on that and it
[15:07] doesn't go to the trustees or to the
[15:09] pastor it's a Deacon's thing
[15:12] altogether now then question number two
[15:17] is it s sufficient to say openly from
[15:22] the pulpit that tongues and
[15:25] interpretations should be done in
[15:29] meeting before the service that's the
[15:32] second question on this uh slip of paper
[15:35] that I have here which is a little card
[15:37] now this would be uh pertaining to the
[15:42] pastor here see because he after all
[15:45] over the spiritual part he's the head of
[15:48] that deacons are a policeman in the
[15:50] church to keep order and to take care of
[15:53] these things and feeding the poor and so
[15:54] forth the trustees are over the finance
[15:57] in the building that's what they to look
[15:59] at but the pastor is over the the
[16:03] supervising of the spiritual part and
[16:06] this would go to you brother nille now
[16:10] there some time ago when the uh order
[16:15] was set the
[16:17] church uh I do believe in speaking in
[16:20] tongues and interpretation and all the
[16:23] fine spiritual gifts that's ordained of
[16:25] God to be in the church but
[16:29] we are living in a day just like it was
[16:33] in the Bible time where the churches now
[16:36] you notice Paul he founded the church at
[16:40] Ephesus the Ephesian Church which is a
[16:42] well-established Church did you notice
[16:45] we believe that Paul and did say so
[16:48] himself that he spoke with many
[16:50] tongues and we know that he had gifts of
[16:53] tongues not ones that he had learned but
[16:55] those who were spiritually given to him
[16:57] because how he speaks it Corinthians
[16:59] there and the same time I'm not just
[17:02] turning in the Bible and reading it for
[17:04] you because it would make our our stay
[17:06] here too long tonight as I don't have
[17:08] too much time and now but just so that
[17:11] you could openly
[17:12] see
[17:14] now uh Paul never one time had to speak
[17:18] to the Ephesian church or to the Roman
[17:20] church or any of those other churches
[17:22] about their spiritual gifts about how to
[17:24] put them in order but he did have to
[17:27] speak to the Corinthians continually
[17:29] about it because they made it an issue
[17:32] all the time and Paul said when he come
[17:35] among them if uh they found out one had
[17:38] a tongue and one had a Psalm and he
[17:40] thanked the Lord for all their fine
[17:43] gifts and things like that and if you
[17:45] notice in the first chapter or two of
[17:47] Corinthians Paul was telling
[17:49] positionally what they were in Christ
[17:51] how he they were positionally in Christ
[17:53] then after he told him and like a father
[17:57] he be to let the whip down on them and
[17:59] say I hear there's contentions among you
[18:01] and I hear that you get drunk at the
[18:03] Lord's table he didn't un christianize
[18:06] them and don't you Brethren do that un
[18:08] christianize them but it's a way they're
[18:11] behaving themselves in the house of God
[18:14] that's where it's said now I would say
[18:17] this that as Paul of old said that when
[18:21] you come together if one speaks let
[18:24] another uh interpret there be no
[18:27] interpreter then hold your peace
[18:29] but if there being an interpreter now
[18:31] I've watched The church here and I've
[18:33] seen you grow up I've seen many
[18:36] spiritual gifts operating among you
[18:37] frankly one I had to come to brother
[18:39] Neville about with a word from the Lord
[18:41] to correct him on something that he was
[18:44] doing and if I if the Lord is the Holy
[18:47] Ghost has made me an overseer of the
[18:48] flock then it's my duty to tell you the
[18:52] truth and I'm very grateful for brother
[18:55] Neville he heeded to the truth I can
[18:56] only say it as he tells me now on this
[19:00] as I noticed your church growing and
[19:02] noticed it and in the church here's the
[19:05] way we had it first and this is the way
[19:07] we we want it again now if you don't
[19:10] watch when
[19:11] babies the first thing a baby does is
[19:15] try to talk when he can't talk he makes
[19:18] a lot of bubble and noise and and so
[19:21] forth but he thinks he's just he can out
[19:24] talk the preacher at that time well we
[19:27] find that not only in the natural life
[19:29] but we find that in the spiritual life
[19:31] also it's a little one and if you try to
[19:35] correct that baby and spank him a little
[19:37] bit because he's gooing and trying to
[19:39] talk you'll ruin the child and you'll
[19:43] hurt him and it's best to let that baby
[19:46] grow a little while until he actually
[19:48] can speak his words right and then tell
[19:50] him when not when Papa's talking or When
[19:53] Mama's talking but when it's appropriate
[19:56] time let him have his say
[19:59] do you understand me now let him talk
[20:02] when his time comes to talk now if I've
[20:05] ever had anything that's been a thorn in
[20:07] my flesh out in the meeting is someone
[20:10] to rise up when I'm speaking and then
[20:13] give a message in tongues and break the
[20:15] spirit I've just come out a meeting in
[20:18] New York and different places to where
[20:20] ministers let that go on time after time
[20:23] and it's nothing but but a
[20:26] confusion see when God is dealing in one
[20:29] line of thought he it would be it would
[20:33] he would be defeating his own purpose if
[20:36] he's trying to get a line of thought to
[20:38] you to the congregation to make an alter
[20:40] calling something budding for instance
[20:42] like this we're sitting at the table
[20:45] talking and we're talking uh about the
[20:48] Lord and Junior runs into the table real
[20:51] quick takes all the attention away from
[20:53] what we're doing and hollers scream out
[20:56] dad mom my my I just hit a home run down
[21:00] the team and we doing all this that and
[21:02] the other and when we're right on a
[21:04] real right down sacred subject now him
[21:09] hitting a home run that's all right at
[21:12] the baseball game that's all right but
[21:14] he's out of
[21:15] horor when he breaks in on the message
[21:18] that we're talking about let him wait
[21:20] till his time comes and then tell us
[21:22] what he did at the baseball game now
[21:24] that's just the same thing we find with
[21:26] gifts today that's the reason God cannot
[21:29] trust too many spiritual giftss with
[21:30] people they don't know how to control
[21:32] them that's what's the matter today the
[21:34] reason we don't have no more than we do
[21:36] and we do find there's a lot of
[21:37] impersonation of spiritual gifts but I
[21:40] don't believe that's so here in our
[21:42] church I'm thankful for that I don't
[21:43] believe it's an impersonation at all I
[21:45] believe we have genuine gifts but we
[21:47] must know how to control those gifts
[21:49] then when you go to doing something good
[21:51] just like you working for a boss and you
[21:53] start out on the first year job and
[21:55] you're willing to take
[21:57] ERS then the boss has confidence in you
[22:01] and will keep raising you up to a higher
[22:03] office all the time now I believe that
[22:05] time is struck the brandom Tabernacle to
[22:08] know what to take the gifts that God
[22:11] gives us that God can trust us with
[22:13] something even greater and what we have
[22:16] got but we cannot uh go along and you
[22:19] see a man that's always had to be tell
[22:22] him and everything and remember the
[22:24] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[22:28] prophets says the scripture when you see
[22:30] a man that you have to correct or a
[22:33] woman and that person gets out of order
[22:36] and then you're telling him the
[22:38] scriptural
[22:39] truth then it shows that the spirit
[22:41] that's on him isn't of God because the
[22:44] Bible said the spirit of the
[22:47] prophets are prophesying that's
[22:49] testifying preaching speaking in tongues
[22:52] or whatever it is because tongues
[22:54] interpreted is prophecy so it's subject
[22:58] to to the prophet and the word is the
[23:02] prophet so we we see that it's out of
[23:06] order for a man or woman to jump up and
[23:10] give a message no matter how much they
[23:11] want to do it while a preacher is in the
[23:16] Pulpit now I suggest this for the
[23:19] brandom
[23:22] Tabernacle that being that our our gifts
[23:24] that we find and we have some very fine
[23:27] gifted people
[23:29] here now each one of those gifts are a
[23:32] Ministry of their
[23:34] own they are gifts just like preaching
[23:37] is a gift like healing is a gift like
[23:41] other things are gifts these are gifts
[23:44] they are ministries of their own and
[23:47] each man is commanded to wait on his own
[23:52] Ministry therefore let the brandom
[23:55] Tabernacle be operated like this and in
[23:58] the day today especially this day when
[24:00] we've had so
[24:01] much um I don't want to say this but so
[24:05] much make
[24:06] belief we don't want make belief no man
[24:09] no honest person wants to have a make
[24:13] belief we we don't can't have the real
[24:15] let's not have any at all let's wait
[24:17] till we do get the real I believe you
[24:20] you man would agree with that we don't
[24:23] want nothing make believe brethren we
[24:24] can't start on make believe something
[24:26] and leave in this world we got to have
[24:28] what's real what's genuine if we haven't
[24:31] got it let's wait till we do get it and
[24:33] then say something about it see
[24:36] now I would say let all these men and
[24:40] women who speak in tongues and prophesy
[24:44] and give messages and I I'm believing
[24:48] with you men that they are
[24:50] genuine
[24:52] now the Bible has said prove all things
[24:55] and hold fast to that what's good or
[24:58] with stammer lips and other tongues will
[24:59] I speak to this people this is the rest
[25:02] that I said that they should enter into
[25:05] over in the book of Isaiah
[25:08] now I would suggest this so that the
[25:13] sanctuary will only be ministered by one
[25:16] gift at a time or it brings us straight
[25:19] back in order again of what I'm trying
[25:20] to say if one Speaking let the spirit of
[25:23] the prophets be subject to the prophet
[25:27] do you understand
[25:29] now let those who have a Ministry to the
[25:32] body of
[25:33] Christ and now it's being said now let
[25:37] it be done let those who have a

[26:07] prophecy that's to be given to the
[26:10] church let them come among themselves
[26:14] early in the before the meeting starts
[26:18] let them Gather in an appointed room and
[26:21] wait on the ministry of the Lord as the
[26:25] pastor has to do himself before he comes
[26:27] in to the audience he must take the
[26:30] Bible study in the quietness of his room
[26:35] in the spirit and be anointed to come
[26:38] out before the audience to speak if he
[26:42] doesn't he's going to be confused when
[26:43] he gets out there let each man and each
[26:47] woman with a spiritual gift come before
[26:49] the Lord and being that the pastor has a
[26:54] single Ministry he is a prophet the Eng
