voice of God in the last days that's when we only in the voice of God in the last days on us do it Adam curve is full how much on it you're the most populous area divorce exotic use your own friends your community have a kernel talking about receiving receiving what the message of the hour really has for you Adam this is very rare century heard his voice and the mood of eating amen and so I said battleship for them there was no condemnation to had a little of it even her back to the full he heard the voice of God and he said father now I lay these down Bruce's in other words I'm not ready

Tigers and the Wiley later right around the pole think about what a magnificent the tiger in the wild leaf blade what's around him are you within that was no heart left because animals is no he's a God was all he had heard the next class again to get her the message therefore he will his fellowship with God and no no way I'm getting oh how we be definite no like a wandering here we know they're going to wake up very boys in the way that he ought to have her hey I said we can do that contagious we can hear God's voice the way that we walked through yeah so I have should I hear raise it up and if you say your voice is all that haunted me you should hear the voice without fear and if you should hear the voice without inside because it's been cleaned again amen the best-fitting employed is to bring you a tactical position in class which is his right for every day along with all of our amen to be able to impart he and myself the ability to hear God's Word correct to hear his word the way that it ought cleaner such as nature that's a nice thing to hear his voice the ways been often heard I didn't realize you had heard his voice so wait a minute ought to be good thanks for women to their millennia that I didn't think we're all here in our nation as a nation loser we heard his voice the way that it ought to be heard right and if the brother gossiped we went even need in our memory and we would need a hospital yeah hurting boys so they said it should have been through - walking with God in the cool of the evening got sucked down that great outdoors of people in the our abortionist on his little congregation together as it it's time to go up to the house of God or worship or to the British because they worship a man who can walk up into that group of evil and there's no condemnation the only thing they're doing here from God a message said that how lazy and what it has to do day one that is right the church and here a man Compeyson no sir a heavier hidden elimination you'll only hear God get off the wall of God who says you have the same kind of encounter that Agatha said in the garden but then there was a visited and there was another voice that came along amen in fact we have 74 sickness brother Graham said one day you heard five boys never thought I didn't want to comment about them he said I better leave that alone for a while but he listened to the Rome rules didn't want his life the closest had he had why didn't I kill thou speakest like a movie and it was a hope you Grace would be pretty instead of dying it changed the course of human beings impact but he heard a voice of God he had fellowship with it so many turn how did he know that his wife is wrong remember it was says Amen oh watch this church I'm going to comment on the last step of the first part of it I've already talked how they made about these both Marcus service already how did he know that his wife was wrong as she had heard the same essence together but always is that way always that because this moment I think God gives to the husband or kids in the problem probably gives you to the bride is that right to the husband and I'm going to give to the wife also forbidden women were inside what's that what's that what's that it's not as law an advocate here actually has long had heard the voice of God correct he walked indisputable knowledge but here in Hades voice beginning to direction away from the voice of God amen look at the tales that it produced when Adam heard the world wars every sickness every did rather a hard evidence that immediacy carbon/carbon was given this very moment of unity auditory the very West three sons his youngest son I got jumper South Yungas shot and then already conceding 15 hours I believe me is not worth the thought he had the science is beautiful my dear should be gentle the world and at night did nothing to stop me and be about 21 hours to live attribute to the I'm glad you didn't bother about that taken care of even on that he did also be small but if you waited oh nice would not have been and having continued in the voice of God all chaos that we had oh oh oh that's been brothers were lost with a healthy to get political and that is a little bit about the city yeah remember both oh man now has been killed by a police officer dealing is me on the neck left man and that man is now that all that kind of thing what actually [Music] with Abraham she was and also a desire to do sir no there's one for the purpose of reproducing himself uber alright you realize you're so sir you have success if Christ has a desire to produce no.3 bride this was the master happen it won't peace I had not resting while Monday or stop or change strategy rashly and a lot of cries out this world by deficient rock the Abraham has a desire and his bride crazy for his son God deserves your name partners slavery Cossack Genesis chapter 15 and verse out and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward it are with an anthem of the song now this is bigger Silver Star Abraham 10 all the stars as if Abraham is to go out and preach the stars and seek literally to the star anise ace of the Google Calendar yes that'll be able to live with him and he said to him so shall thy seed be King James version of the Bible any we're not telling no star but I want you to relax on teachers and Abraham is doing without pollution fiscal evasion to the because you won't really up there and it is not just a slightly bizarre again feeling to start with a husband you can see the river long ha hey that's what we need to do is focus your eyes and see the kingdom of God I think a lovely everything moral made and we can't even imagine our genetic pollution and drive a ball Priscilla's arse stars I'm going to have any seizure as there are of you isn't it they men you may have no idea what Abraham is confirmed he has no son he has a child again Sarah is barren nothing is going home but Abraham has to see nothing oh maybe we need to start talking and speaking of making and rather than negativity I yeah the Spanish version of the Bible which I was preaching this Condors 100 brother claims door and he was interpreting and I was running over to this window looking out him and then saying this versus the keep getting version and the Donner rocket understand my mistake because it's not the way survival easy amen survival reason just a little bit of copy that you smart again look at the Stars and many have they are show with more see Bea Haven so I ran in Abraham is a brief estar and the way that this Spanish language said Amen if he goes over a and stars and it's got a revelation his heart that God is speaking to me God and God to save a ram I'm in love as far as they are so salad horse you see what kind of they did they we haven't have to have in what you hear oh I think about of truth and in your club brother Napa said God spoke to Abraham and totally there now your get a particular lattice all that man is talking about and if God is telling Abraham about its baby it's coming me is why it is berry there is no I had offspring and all but God is telling a favor hey and if your chances are if you're just the word hey that's your hearing eyeball and I am Telling You as your see our mamas are then you must hear the voice of God no man any we're going back to this very one and say what I just heard from God I gotta told me.there you and I are going to have season like the star that is you know and then as far as I can remember correctly the Bible does not say April and Sarah you are going to have a child and some of my congregation so already I had a freedom and ceremony Sarah is here for the Bible or say that Abraham and Sarah the bush spot hey but it does Sekhmet affecting all Abraham heard that not Sarah also oh do not stop with his neighbor him because Abraham heard Sarah heard the same man what was amiss Abraham under the star your secret will be hotness Sarah heard that message you have here I'm just apologizing to you for the balance of payment because everyone heard it Sarah understand I'm talking about your school into one of the Restatement Jesus classes come on what Jesus Christ fears about you you say man oh Jesus Christ about do it we all lose Jesus kind of heard a certain way Miss Sarah her and what pay for Hamburg not you just hear the same thing and that you and it's focused and the console you the device sir major rift on the land of the lot and we are sure sure heard the message from Abraham for a while the bruises a ternary which is really the miss faith of a century I keep it before March 20 a minute other madam says now the only thing that Sarah had to do long ride a maybe make it too hard now the only thing that sinner who wants to believe what a for him and the Lord that you have to do that what he said this is as good as done he said I know thank you now the only thing that Sarah had what to believe money remember in essence a potato sack Abraham told her he was going to have the baby what a beautiful fish unit Abraham told her he wouldn't have a baby and you realize Sarah and just like that right hey baby it's not going to be a baby about someone who this problem is not for these that's another one about the safety called her Sarah Harrison is a Heuer we is going to happen it and once you heard him say Sarah God told me I'm gonna have a baby she is that inverted Oh beautiful at this point in their life sure I've heard the word obey me that's what I'm talking to you now but we know all cheater they never changed her not why did there was an old Cheney issue I mean does he hurt her so she walk later add some sugar later and follow him were everyday calling him lord if she didn't hear whatever [Music] [Music] [Music] all the calls Shivan could not hear we were part but she good with reviews key empirical work God by carnal reason God you know he's not fully contacted you look for revelation of God now initially when I was a wooden pole II know Sarah and if names of past behind and our world our room share a word of the Lord this year she's gonna have to take her hand off the work and this god of your salvation you gotta let go you know that initially Sarah her Lord Lu theory and then we know that while we're out there thanks to them the three entities come the alley rock they wish an heir of God manifesting the army level and the doing is going down this up once they to make Abraham said amen Sarah here's the speech that the Lord is giving to her Abraham at this time I mean God has told Abraham that is them but Abraham and that his wife's name is no longer so high but now is no one else has heard of that mess God told Abraham Abraham is so Sarah and there they all into the nose and then if God has Abraham your name is now no longer able it is Abraham and Sarah's conversation that having refresh ready the Lord [Music] [Music] through 30 of those Sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was a little child because she judged him safely through funds he secured the more significant abraham abraham believed member sarah.hatton to work out percent what are you trying to say motivator and it's sometimes not that believers have problems I never believing that the law has completed the workers foundation is a liberal what a beautiful picture but what a beautiful dictionary truth in Christ I see the veterans there's not any minute okay man Sarah with Abraham black black both a man and told him no this is a sheriff was April she Ottawa never got to see Chiana I got a revelation Oh reasoning pendel works the same in deeply and she just humans a living from so it is Sarah Genesis order capable at what point was very big and you love her and then the problem Bob say I will overcome too right now Jesus Christ because you're not Church or not not me we're about these issues but rather than see you've known the quote and God speaks to crime now what it is whatever God spoke to Christ is for you to answer I'm not really a Sunday morning and his congregation here finish you begin so is it in just in Revelation moral law where he says come up good now we'll be getting into that tomorrow line through my mouth and God tasted Christ and we are doing why is bride that's right what a beautiful dictionary I don't understand it neither did Sarah but Abraham her the world of now admittedly because Abraham her horse showed you share and the result was the birth body we're believing all in the program so Jesus heard from God and told us what would Jesus Christ ever tell you with anything but the police don't believe that I need these words speak of me so he's heard by vivid Holly you should have a cannot leave a man loses that right and we believe the things that is possible to my sick days before today no one calls every activity I can see her baby brother and every call she knows before person be found do sir [Music] [Music] you did almost safe but they didn't restraining the prophets of the Lamb of God decided not met so what they thought was unreasonable crise total a community goals in cold Francisco regardless of that settles it we just really talk about some more let's go talk about another character and actually my life when we got home suddenly she taught more about Moses that she didn't deserve an internet service and I was wrong without odor and although I've been here ability to keep you amen as long as I want to amen yes I would be merciful tonight and I'm going to begin to close this out and leave some of these characters are how many will be that there's more than one way to do not hear in your hear the voice speaking but when you hear the voice speaking see then you're here in sneakers don't get these messages up just from years ago a man will not read or other answers before speaking but when you hear in your heart poppy seed in here you understand what we're trying to say go Robert a property sure we should have something going on with the wings of God but God did you do more than here to be few people to hear it in your heart so is only after hearing from your side when Abraham able to fulfill the prophecy or she be Moses other people fill the proxy that was about Moses and I said I want to skin but this mystical things you heard it from his mother a murderer from marrow result your liver Moses or Moses parents and managed on a bed or joe sanella hey had heard that he was born in Cracow they do know something about they all his barrel number five most his mother is all talking I promise that he was born for he-man and both of them said the most got ready to act on the tradition in stocks unfairly they do ride and a truck full of

the word of God tonight I know Jordan was trying to find out with some of the things out there how they were following the service and now but the thing that is necessary tonight is the other I believe something where Peter said tonight that the Holy Spirit my have spoken to your heart or my have quick into your mind tonight or he might have just been that word for you I mean to your remembrance tonight you know I was just thinking about it one better Twitter started reading the scripture yeah we are talking about the book of art saying he goes right into the book of us tonight to

confirm we right steady in the book of Acts and the Holy Spirit led a seven of God tonight to bring that message to us and speaking on year-in the voice of God correctly I was sitting there writing my notes and I just thinking about hearing the voice of God addressing your situation because the message is preached and as he preached the message the Saints were able to make sacrifice tonight to come

an atmosphere that he can be able to minister to us there is no need for us to be able for us to complain even if the Sun was not coming up right all we need to do is to just put our heart before the Lord and and and trust that God was able to say something just the title of the message hearing the voice of God correctly and it's enough to be able the Holy Spirit can just pick that up and deal with our hearts are we hearing the voice of God addressing our needs are we hearing the voice of God addressing situation in our life Abraham heard the voice of God he came to Sarah and he told Sarah the exact thing that he heard but she heard something different and and and she brought he got into the picture and and and until when God came down and spoke to her when she heard just what Abraham
