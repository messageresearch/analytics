radiation therapy then the doctors told her that she didn't have to have immunotherapy because she's got a gene in her body that gives her fortified fortified immuno immunization and so the Lord already placed something in her body before she even needed it and so but the prognosis is really good and so she's gonna sounds like she's gonna make a full recovery and then also my one of my

we go right into our service so on behalf of my family and the Good Shepherd fellowship in Minneapolis we want to send our sincere condolence to sister peace and the children and also Christian Fellowship of DC we heard of the sudden passing of our brother but Miran was such a good friend to us he worked with us yet in this assembly coming and preaching for us and we know what you are going through we are standing with you in prayers if there was something I was said about burl Maron that I do remember instead he had I mean Sasha burning for the word and you always wanted to do something in and I mean put the young people right into the pages of the word he was an and a lot to seeing the world being a revival among the people our prayers will be with you sister peace and also with the assembling you god bless you richly once again on behalf of our assembly we sent our sincere condolence to the family and the church god bless you thank you I thought that it would have been good for us to just do it together I know if you standing with me and we can be able to achieve the praise the Lord God bless you sister now me tonight huh we want to we want to just look at something and but before we do that and a couple of testimonials here and once again we pray for that gentleman David and then Monday morning we got a call that he went to be with the Lord so our prayers will be with the wife and the children and but you know is it's just some of those things there phase part of life you know we live in two died in and what matter is our home beyond this life that's that's what matter in all of this so we pray for the wife and the children that the grace of God will I know sister Cosima why they been giving their support to the lady so and and then just at a time where the devil thought he was going to you know once again discourage us spit in our face like I was saying I have another testimonial year from from sister bureau our sister she been with us for a while and she had the opportunity to do the work of a nanny she goes you know she helped different families with their children so after she came back and she was working with her family and then they found another family for her to go and help him and this time this family that she's working with the from Somalian Muslim family and and two of the young kids you know they're in the health condition I think the little one that she told me in had to be fed through feeding tube and and I think the next try after also is having a disability so I mean when she when she went into the home normally she stays in the home with the family and you know and she helped the kids and you know do some other things in the house so she said she actually started praying and asking the Lord you know why he sent her here I know every time she have a new you know assignment to do she always talked with talked to me about it you know she was playing everything give us the contact so we can be able to pick her up for church you know and we will check on her to find out how everything is going and for some reason I mean the grace of God has been with her with their family and in so much that she she said I mean the the people and and the children I mean they're just so much in love with Hardin and the children mother kept telling her there is something special about you you know and they get you know kept saying that to her but last Monday there was there was a situation and this child has a nurse that comes to the house you know to come and do all the cleaning of the tube and putting the tube in and you know setting everything right you know they're supposed to be done by a medical professional so this day the the nurse came and and the mother you know has gone out so it was only the nurse and sister beer to the house but the nurse was you know doing the tube in every the testing the child you know doing all the vital signs and different things that she would do as a nurse so right in that moment since tobira says she heard the north that the nurse stream you know she she streaming you know I mean in in a kind of scary sound and and she ran there to find out what was happening but apparently it looks like the child was losing its life in the hand of the nurse and the nurse was so afraid I mean she was crying in you know streaming and and our sister told her that don't cry the child is not going to die she says that's why I'm here you know and and the nurse was just shaking all over I mean she told me in his testimony I think a few days ago my goodness and I was just so I was just so in and she said right there right before the end I mean the child was was I mean color was changing I mean life was growing out of the child and the nurse was just there you know streaming and so afraid shaking you know I mean all her medical experience have gone through the window she didn't know what to do she was saying the child is dead and and and sister Bureau just to right there lay her hands upon the child pray for the child and the child revived back you know and the child revived back and she told me she says and the child went from their moment without the tube or the connection you know all the medical connection that was on the child she went with with our and I mean the nurse surprisingly also because you know that's a Muslim family the nurse also is a Muslim girl you know and I mean she was just standing there and asking the sister what watch was she dead you know and all of that but I just thought that that was tremendous testimony you know praise the Lord so when when the devil thing is coming to spit in our face God is still moving a many God is doing things in the life of his people praise the Lord amen so I was kind of for thinking on what to speak about I first prepared to talk tonight I wanted to brag on Jesus a little bit and so I was I was I was you know thinking about the errand and my mind was just going in between a few different tarts and like we spoke about you know apostolic time before us so tonight we will we would just talk a little bit from the book of Acts and then while I was home this afternoon sometime around I think around the morning a brother called me also you know and and I mean he we talked on the phone and he kind of for testified you know she has some things would mean in you know what the Lord I placed on his heart to do and I thought about this after we got off the phone you know I just stood up right there you know I was doing some work I just stood up I said Lord you know what a good girl you are you know brother Branham talks about standing at your post of duty and many times the way we have honest to that over the years is there either you are a song leader or you are a musician or you are a deacon or you are one on an officer or you have a position but but I think as a believer our post of duty is to stand with the word when we are standing with the world we are at our post of duty so whether in church or out of church when we are making decision on the base of the word you are standing at your post of duty and remember better Branham says that's the only place that God can bless you amen so if we only gave the post of duty to people that have offices in a church then God will not bless the rest of the congregation you know so whether in church or out of church our post of duty is to stand with the Word of God that's the believer post of duty because that is the I mean the believer position in Christ to stand with the Word of God so and I just and any reason why I thought about that is because you know when a man or a woman make a decision or make a choice based on the Word of God you know you just make a choice I'm going to do this you know even though I mean it's beyond your reasonable you say I'm going to do this because the Word of God says I must do it you know you have just given God an opportunity you know this almost like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he says okay even if he will not deliver us you know even if we know our God can deliver us but if he choose not all this time we are not going to buy them I mean you gave God the opportunity you have taken yourself off the scene and you have given God the opportunity to step on the scene and and and defend his name and defend his word praise the Lord so we just thank the law so let's take our our posts of duty and as we will read the scripture 290 amen as Chapter one asked chapter one oh yeah thank you for a scared there's a habit amen praise the Lord as chapter one that just reverse one now based based on these two testimonies I want I want to I want to speak on this subject tonight I'm just introducing this in and we pray that the grace of God would be able to continue with us you the former treating have I made all two fellows of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after death he true the whole Eagles have given command on to the apostle's whom he have chosen let's pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord we talking about apostolic time among us love father we want to go back to the wrecker Oh God where you started to move ammonia postures father net-net at a time word you are in a fleshly form but moving through the hearts of the believers so God we just prayed in acts the Lord you were coming and bless your word tonight father Oh bless your people in your homes of garden and Lord Jesus we want to thank you Father Lord Oh God for standing with our sister Lord Jesus and back in your word our poor father Lord God we just pray that you would glorify yourself Lord Jesus oh god father Lord may she be a witness in that home of father Lord Oh God if there's a purpose of salvation or we know that purpose will never be defeated Lord so we just prayed committing those little children in your hands or father we asked a Lord God you will just move on behalf god of your word we thank you for our dear brother also father we pray you strengthen his faith in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you Lord for the bride of Jesus Christ Oh God around the world your people that are standing for your name's sake in this hour we just ask the Lord you bless the service now Lord bless your word as we bring a fine father tonight come and break the world God speak to our hassle father may something be said that we draw us closer to you we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you can have your seat I read this quote from s position and I will find my my subject from there the revelation of Jesus Christ I just want to read this line but Branham says now remember this Christ in the truth church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen now if apostolic time is a Manas then I believe we are in a continuation of the book of Acts I was looking a lot of statement abroad branimir on dish and he compared it to writing another book of Acts and that their statement and not a book of adds you know I thought about it and I says well I know brother Brandon really never meant you know writing a separate book of ads but it is just the continuation of the book of ads and and and this is where it comes out beautiful to support that statement of brother Branham when Luke that wrote the book of ads when he wrote this this treaty toe-to-toe Phillips where he made the statement about the formal treaty now their former treaty that he was referring to is the book of look it's a book of look so in one sense Luke was telling to you fellas I give you a report of what Jesus did when he was alive this is a continuation of their report so it's a continuation of the book of odds just like where Branham saying you know and the beautiful thing year is there let's look in Luke chapter 1 verse 3 let's look in Luke chapter 1 verse 3 reading from one for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seems good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent to your Phillips now this even in this introduction Luke put out that I'm not a disciples I was net and eyewitness of many of these things because he was net counted among the twelve no he was not counted among the twelve now that's what would make the book of us beautiful because even just just imagine right from the beginning of the book of ad God use a man that was not the disciple he was not a minister Luke says right here in his book he well he was not a minister of the word so it just showed that the book of Acts is starting with common people it's going to speak about common people people that God will use in India in India profession God will use as a housewife and as a mechanic as a physician you know and in different people how the Spirit of God will just move not only the twelve that was with Jesus not only the 120 that was in the upper room but God is now pouring out his spirit just like he prophesied but joy of the Prophet and he's going to use common people pray so long so look here is is writing this account to TIA Phyllis now for some reason my mind I just got stuck on there this afternoon and I started reading different accounts to find out who these two fellows was that he was that he was sending this message to praise the Lord and but with this address that look give us here in Luke in his episode where he says here verse three it seems good to me also having having her perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus I point out here that your Philips was he was a man of high office let me say that way he was either a Roman general you know and this also shows that beside the twelve disciples that was walking with Jesus there were other people that the gospel affected there were other people like Jairus we know that he was a secret disciple like Nicodemus even though he was in the sahih Drance council but there was something about the Ministry of Jesus that he testified no man can do this work and said God be with him so beside the twelve disciples that Jesus was what working with the Bible even told told us about a Joseph i'ma tell them the one who gave his he stone for Jesus to be burying now we realize that at a particular point that the scripture is starting to bring these people are to show them the Ministry of Jesus was having effect in the life of people that were secretly believing whether they were Roman soldiers whether they were innocent hindrance Council you know one better Branham talks about Jairus he talks that I mean Jairus was trying to keep his repetition he tell us about Zacchaeus the business man and he talks about these different characters in the Bible so we realized that I mean it was not just the twelve disciples that was with Jesus it was not just they in their wives and their children there were other people that the gospel of Jesus Christ was affecting their life praise the Lord now yeah Luke comes in and it's so please the Lord God was so pleased with Luke report inspire him in such a way and you will realize that I mean look account that he gave he says I gather these things from eyewitnesses and I mean he did it almost like what's the brother that wrote that book Owen you know but yeah Owen juggling the same way he writes he he take the story bit and pieces and he puts it together and it becomes more clearer because he's taking it from eyewitnesses this person said oh okay I remember you know Peter told me in this and Jim is the same thing that James about Peter left this information out so I'm going to bring James information that's what I mean now the story is more clear up that's why he means when he says here I have perfect understanding because he was going around gathering information and dog telling it together to make the picture more clearer God using common people he was not he was not part of the twelve disciples you don't have to be a minister God can bless you in your profession and he can bless the ability you have he can be able to bless just that little China of gift that he gave you whatever that you love to do and you can be happy to do it God can bless that and use it for his purpose what an introduction you think about the book of Acts and you think about the Apostle you think about the Holy Ghost it's so easy for you to jump over as chapter 1 and stand and talk about the days of Pentecost and talked about the Holy Ghost coming but let's go back to the introduction the introduction of the book the man that wrote the book and the one that he was addressing the book tour praise the Lord if we will if we will be looking forward to the continuation of the book of Acts I want to tell you this continuation is not God using special people it's God using common people the common people that make themselves available for God to use if you make yourself available God will use you he will use you in your own situation he will use you to overcome your own weakness he will use you to help somebody he will use you in any way that he want to use you God will use you that's what we are looking at here this is the continuation of the book of art because the thing about it there is that we when we talk about a book of ask our mind goes to the miracle our mind goes to the Holy Ghost coming down there and in everybody speaking in tongues our mind goldstone that the lame man being walk and I mean raise up and get a beautiful for him to walk and and all of that we just look at those special events in a book of us but before those events it look never wrote this this episode we will not have no account if he did not have the burden to go down to Peter house and sit down with him and said tell me tell me that Testament I love to hear those things and you go down to John house and he said tell me and I said tell him his story he goes home it's on his mind he takes his book he starts to write oh my goodness CEO Phyllis you were enjoy this one I Peter just told me something again I love what he told me oh my goodness I'm going to compile all of those things and send him to you God using common people that make themselves available that's the continuation of the book of Acts it never stopped in the Apostles it never stopped in every farmer he never stops in the man that God has raised up through the ages it never stopped in brother branham ministry God is still using common people that would dedicate himself they will make themselves a channel for God to use I mean god bless some people they know how to put details together I mean I'm for me I just hit the highlights you asked me one thing I hit the highlights I get out of it some people that goes to the details I mean that's the way that God used people and as the go to those detail is easy for other people to get the full picture of what happened that's why you were realized in the gospel you go to Matthew Gospel he hits some highlights why by calling he was a tax collector he was a tax collector he just hit he just hit highlights but you know a physician brothers can they love details you go to the doctor office and then you actually actually what happened to you he says I have a headache okay you have a headache when there is started you know how many times I mean do you have this all the time he keeps asking you questions he keeps asking you because he wanted he want to get down to the point and that's the kind of a person that look was because he's a physician oh praise the Lord oh man my goodness my goodness how can we have the continuation of the book of us if we just keep it only in the preachers and all the preachers are fighting against one another there must be common people there must be common people there were people the Bible even talks about the women that were around Jesus ministry let me tell you those women they never just left their husbands no they were supported by their husbands in in all that they were doing for the ministry when the scripture brings them out and talks about Solomon it talks about me remodeling talks about all of these different women it's not because the belief that the message of Jesus or believe the Ministry of Jesus oh the judge decided to live single I know they had children they have husband they have house duty but when it came to a place where the top they could be effective in a ministry of Jesus they stepped out to the plate if it was to make bread if it was to make a juice if it was so I mean make a pillow for him to rest his head on where the table they were needed in a ministry they stepped out to the plate but they had their normal life they believed in his ministry they knew that he was the Messiah after what mirror modeling experience being seven devil being cast out of her you know all the stubborn spirit and fighting and everything that she was doing being cut a humble heart she loved the Lord Jesus but if she must follow Jesus she must also be respectful to her husband they never just left their family life and just ran behind Jesus what would they have done when he was crucified what would they have done when he had sent it up God using common people praise the Lord amen so we look at Luke a little bit look at this brother Luke a little bit collusion chapter four let's let's let just get a few record on him here Paul talks about this man the Bible says he was a physician amen and you know it's right here you know it put us to the place where we we want to use this and encourage our young people you know don't I mean don't seek the Holy Ghost and and and and don't do well in school the Holy Ghost will help you to do well because the Holy Ghost supposed to remind you praise the Lord so you can't tell me you're looking for the Holy Ghost and you feeling in your test you're looking for the wrong spirit because the Holy Ghost supposed to remind you he's supposed to bring back to your mind those things that you have been taught God show it over and over through the scripture that he used come on people marty was a tax collector he was very good to be in the body when Jesus told him come and follow me it did not it did not troll his tax collecting skills out of the window it did not roll his career out of the window see the reason why God would bless us in in the things that we do and give you better career is because God want you to go into the into the work market because there's some of his children in that place and the only way he can get them is to get somebody working in the same of is somebody working in the same company and then he can use you as a channel to be able to fish his children out if God makes every one of us to be just I mean all his children just doing one thing nobody will be safe out there he will have to take a supernatural move of God to get people from from from in the car in industry to get kept in touch to be said it will have to take but God will receive a man that has the ability to do certain things because they are more of his children in their line of work and he can use that man or that woman as a testimony that's the reason why wherever we find ourself as we go down into this book I mean Luke talks about it wherever we find ourselves we want to be a witness of Jesus Christ because birdbrain says that's what internal life is living for others living for others so that life can flow through us and influence others praise the Lord Amen that's what we are net I mean we are not ashamed to testify you know to tell people when people get attracted to your weight of light and people get attracted to I mean and since there's just something about you I mean I just I just I just appreciate the way you do things you know we found an opportunity to tell them that we are saved by grace to tell them that once I was a sinner this this this nice person you've seen how I was not always nice but God grace get hold of me amen you have to find a way to tell because sometimes we just love to stock in the praises oh you are a nice you are a nice guy and and then pretty soon you stick your head out I mean and it equate to put a proud spirit on you and the devil knows how to do that and you and he would just misplaced I think he said it to be I mean a pure love of God that is flowing through you he gets right in there and start to pervert it to be lost and then it turned to all sorts of things when someone starts to appreciate the grace of God in you and you just point them to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ it gets their attention if this person used to be or if they were now like this and the grace of God helped them to be like this then I think I want that same grace you know but sometimes we just want to take all the praises and we don't give nothing to God oh you are a smart guy yeah you know what I went to this school I get this degree you know when and and you just leave Christ out of the picture you will never be a witness that way amen that's the beginning of the book of Acts praise the Lord Paul year speaking in a book of collusion verse chapter four verse 14 he talks about Luke Luke table of physician and you know he brings our look here and and there is there is another chapter somewhere where Paul he spoke about Luke I think there is 2nd Corinthians chapter 8 let's look at that I have few of them reading down here so I hope I'm giving you the right one now yeah 2nd Corinthians chapter 8 verse 18 listen to what what what Paul said about Luke II am he says and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is is in the gospel throughout all the churches whose praise is in the gospel which means look account of the gospel it brought out some things that make the story of Jesus in his disciple more clearly so all the churches enjoy just like when people takes brother always book you know and and they listen to those little story the way he don't tell the stories together and he makes the picture clearer now that was the same way Luke account was I mean all the churches talks about this guy oh my goodness and then and and and even some people mistake him to be a disciples you're told that he was one of the twelve and many Christians today mistake Luke to be a disciple they thought that he was one of the twelve he was not number with the twelve but he went around and gather all of these testimony had a burden on a high just to do something for the Lord and he had this testimony in him on the brothers whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches they talk about Luke account praise the Lord amen Peter and all of these disciples they had the pressure of the responsibility after Jesus has left and they were all afraid waiting there in the upper room now if God did not give us a male like look we will not even have an account of what happened on the day of Pentecost if God did not give us a male like look we will not even know what were what the first church was who have no idea and years said he rides to this man chill Phyllis most excellent to you Phyllis he gave him the respect to realize that T Oh Phyllis no matter what his position was there was something about the gospel of Jesus cried I was trailing him every time Luke was sent a report to him man I really enjoyed that testimony last night look oh my goodness I went to work you know I was I was there there and they were talking something about Caesar and they were talking about I mean uh Rome has conquered the world but I mean just raising a little gear back to life my goodness I mean that thing was just on my mind God using common people using Luke testimony if he was a physician he went to medical school that day and what he was doing was taking the gospel of Jesus among his professors taking a gospel of Jesus and more the people that he's caught to associate with we're venom said son I made to go out he said god bless him he said just like Paul Paul was a learned man and God bless him Paul could stand before anybody he had the education tool to put his words together I mean he would stand before Caesar and he would even talk and and I mean those Roman gods their hat would be so moved won't tore him apart shut up you almost destroyed me to be a Christian because that was the way he was caught Peter was a fisherman so God caught him to be able to go in the area you know and that's the way he made every one of us we are very different that's the reason why you gave God too much of work when you try to be like somebody because he can use you that way he have to bring you back for you to be yourself and then use you in a way that he want to use you the continuation of the book of Acts he says remember Christ in the truth church is the continuation of the book of Acts Christ in common people if we just start appreciating what God is doing in our life instead of looking at file and and looking at other people and comparing just bring it back to yourself see how much the grace of God has helped you praise the Lord having a Bible study with brother Brad laughs nodding and I mean we just had such a good time there you know in the church in and then I mean at the end he says he says oh I feel so sad that you have to drive all all the way back in you know less less I mean let's move there the Bible said it somewhere else I mean close to that side I said no I want the Word of God to be in this church why it is staying in rooms while the rubbles are all over let keep preaching the word here it might help these guys to go faster amen we have such a good time and and you know trusting the grace of God and just working on something and and I believe that God grace came down last night and and he got it praise the Lord you know he got it you know and and we there with that scripture where Peter said you know baptism show us a good conscience towards God you know and I was telling him at that's that's where God begins with with us if you don't have a good conscience to what God you can never live right if you don't have a good conscience toward God you will never appreciate what God is doing for you if you're conscious to us God is just church membership just to be identified with a church I don't know how you survive it because the first thing that God starts with his children like any parent when that child is born because of the nine months experience the father being around the mother you know a caring for the child why to try to stay in a warm they try in some ways some mysterious way that little life is conscious of the beam that is around and when the child is born she she or he stop becoming conscious to the voices that's the reason why even Dahl is a month old child when it gets in the hands of a stranger is able to differentiate a stranger from the parent the first thing it becomes conscious that this field likes my mama there's a feeling there's an atmosphere that is around and that is the first thing that God brings to his children a good cultures that God is God and he's a holy God that's the thing that brings the fear of God that gift of wisdom to do the right thing praise the Lord amen what I'm just I'm just having a good time here amen I mean I'm having a good time here because I mean I just I just I just got captured in the top I mean the whole afternoon I was just staring ass chapter one the very first verse that's where my mind was I was just I was just reading history on the verse just to see the different things you know and in the different historical account out there about the life of Luke praise the Lord verbatim said is the message talking 1963 he said and so does the bride and Christ becomes one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the scene now see what what Luke said let's go back to Acts chapter one he said a former treaty the former treaty have army and their former tree like I said is the Gospel of Luke all cheerfulness of all that Jesus began both to do and teach that was what was in the first treaty in the first account he said all to your fellow watcher now you know everything that I sent to you about Jesus life he live did not ending his life denied and because you have to realize the Adam till Phyllis is the one I mean Luke is the one that recorded right here Jesus ascension he's the one that recorded the angel said to Jesus at the same way you see me going I will come back so he's telling he's selling that to Philips the account that I sent to you it does not finish it does not end this story getting better it's getting better all the time to your Phillips my goodness these guys are telling me things that is blowing my mind I mean at the Ascension of Jesus there were two angels you know just like as I said who have believed our report the arm of the Lord is revealed unto them and that was what was happening to look because he leave the report of the eyewitnesses God was making a more real and clearer to him praise the Lord because he believed the the the testimony of those witnesses God was just lowering his in I mean his mind I mean I mean the picture become more clearer he said I got a perfect understanding from everything that I've gathered it's getting better to your fellows hey man I hope you got to your feelers tonight he says until the day in which he was taking up the story continued praise the Lord because washing out the gospel stop wave the the death the burial and the resurrection praise the Lord the gospel stop with the death the barrier in the resurrection so Luke is telling to your fellows that's the first account I sent to you he says tattoo of this book but two of this book it's until the day in which he was taking up which he would tell us down here after that he true the Holy Ghost see how hip licit II I mean he puts his whole account in one verse the entire life of Jesus the accession and when the Holy Ghost came he's just given an introduction this is the continuation so the Book of Luke is the first book of Acts we can say that that is a just like first samuel a second summer that is first act he's telling this is a continuation man I don't know where I'm at tonight I'm just enjoying this thing it just looks like I'm sitting down in my basement in reading or city night in my room I mean I read these things I did jump off from my seat and walk around us oh my goodness this thing is becoming so sweet praise the Lord I'm just enjoying it I'm sorry if I'm just too myself tonight I'm supposed to be preaching to you but it's like I'm doing good to myself tonight amen after there he true the Holy Ghost who true the Holy Ghost Jesus true the Holy Ghost the comforter that he promised him I have to go for the Holy Ghost to come he said him true the Holy Ghost have given commandment unto the Apostles whom he has chosen to whom verse 3 also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs Lucas bringing out more storage he showed himself after his passion after his suffering after the cross after the whipping after everything that he went through he show himself through infallible proofs been seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God now Luke comes right in here he's talking about this one verse covered the two men walking on the road of a myers he show himself to them infallible proof when he came through the water and show himself show his hand to Thomas and Thomas crying o my Lord and my god he showed himself and at the graveside he showed himself to the woman and all of these scriptures praise the Lord show himself true infallible proof I don't know what what is the time he okay it's just eight thirty eight I try to find a place to close here praise the Lord Matthew 27 let's look at Matthew 27 praise the Lord Matthew 27 verse 50 oh praise the Lord Jesus the scripture says here you know in there are Jesus when when he when he cried with a loud voice the other of the ghost and behold the veil in the temple rain in twins from the top to the bottom and the earth quake and the rocks rain verse 52 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose now look it's just a firing year in in apse is just a moaning to tear fellows referring to this to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible protein seen of them for today's scene of them for today's who adores I that was seen 40 days now you realize that's what brother Branham took the scripture where he says hey Abraham and Sarah was walking through the city you know he was hauling Sarah Haines they were walking through the city said this is the city this is Jerusalem who you know they are looking at us let's go this way you know he says just in their 40 days period why because the Saints has come from out of the grave and Bourbon says they had a 40 days period on the earth and when Jesus extended he went with them in Chapter 15 I mean these are just all notes I wrote down here I can hardly see them but yeah first Corinthians chapter 15 remember the Bible says and the dead in Christ will rise first and we that alive will we will meet them and wear bottom since we'll have a time here on earth that is the very same thing that Luke testifying year because it happened if you happen the first time it's going to happen again some of these things are not just brother branham teaching there are biblical teachings they are right in the Bible first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 3 for I believe for I delivered unto you first of all that that wish I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of Cleophas them of the twelve after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep now so Paul year also testifying of this very same experience after he ascended he was seen of people you know he's testifying of this very same thing that the Luke is telling us here you know they're after Jesus resurrected before his ascension there was a forted for today's period of time that he's painting and there were many poor evening pleasure to the place were he testified he was seen of about five hundred at a time none of the gospel I mean that I give us that record I don't believe that Paul was just making up the story he says this is what I receive from all the testimony that I've gathered in people that testified they say yeah I was there in a meeting you know we were just gathering a little prayer meeting and our Lord Jesus just appear and the glory was around his face praise the Lord you know the thing about it there is that we just we just think about ourselves and sometimes we think that the little children that comes to the meeting and now also our witnesses but you ask this little kid they will tell you some of the things to see in service that you did not see praise the Lord you ask them they will tell you some of the things that see that you didn't that you know your eyes were not looking - oh yeah I saw the preacher when he did that praise the Lord you know how the kids will talk about oh yeah I saw one brother when when I better take a flint shake take off his shoes you know that's the thing that catches the eye attention you use you are flowing into the mystery and you are hearing the hallelujah amen the little kids are just looking at those little little information that when you when you get their account so when Paul talks about the 500 don't want to count the men and the women count the little ones that were there because some of these little kids that were over in Branum Tabernacle they can give us testimony or what they saw in the meeting sister Carol always talked about her experience at Marian devil's service just a young girl you know an innocent man go into the service and she's preparing for the service and I mean she she tells of what what she knows other time the thing that capture her mind that to honor my we never leave her model until she goes to glory pretty low let me go ahead yakking I can't highly see some of the verses that I wrote down the Minister of the bride and the minister of Christ is to seem a continuation now remember these former treated all to your fillers have I wrote to you that Jesus began to do and continue to do you know so better Bernal is putting us right back there in Acts chapter one and and and Happiness to understand what Luke was saying the thing that Jesus did and he taught he's continuing to do it he talked about a comforter to come he talks about a Holy Ghost the experiences in the upper room I'm again I'm getting to that authority of Allah I'm going to tell you what happened he talks about the Holy Ghost to come he talks about what you see in my ministry the work that I do greater works you would do and Peter just told me he and he and joined the race and lame man up and get beautiful you know and and and the things that he began to do the things that he taught it never stopped in his earthly ministry is continuing by the Holy Ghost he's back in the midst of the church in the form of the Holy Ghost these things that we read in the message they are not just there for brother Branham they are there for the bride are there for Christians today people to seek God or blessed are those that we know believe with our sin you know and I believe that's the people that we are that's the people that we are praise the Lord that we will believe all of these all of these testimonies that we that we hear you know I don't I don't seem so I don't want to be you know a little bit different but sometimes most of the people that was around I mean and it was so familiar with a lot of the things that I was happening in Jefferson there I mean some of these people are all going into crisis you know because some things that that is all and with information that they have today it's just it's just creating a lot of crisis for them why because they are looking at some some some physical things now um I said we received those things by testimony and bringing it back to the Word of God the Holy Spirit is happy also passed by the man it's taking us beyond the man praise the Lord some of the people they have sat right there and saw the healing ministry and all the things they saw I mean this picture is so much in your mind that they cannot pass the man they want him to come back from the grave but God by the Holy Spirit and the information that he has given us it makes us to go beyond the man into what God want to do in this age don't want to pick us up from where we are and use us in the little way there will not be an impersonation of what God did in that ministry Roberta Branham but God can use us in a little way he can use us as a housewife he can use us as a loving husband to our wives and our children he can use us in the simple way the book of us who go on and on and on us who will go through it if the Lord give us grace the former treaty all chile's have already that Jesus began to do and continue to do and it did not stop there in the book of ad he's continuing to do it today that's the place where we are getting home where Branham says continuing to do his death did not stop him no sir he returned again so two fellows were banished putting emphasis there on Luke conversation that his death did not stop him the things that he thought he never owned it a taught the disciples just for them to have notebook and have I mean oh yeah he said this year in 1957 he said this year no no no no the thing that he taught them he has come in the form of the holy spirit to make those things real among them deaf did not stop him but scared even when he died he went down to the grave he preached to those souls in praising I mean he's a busy God praise the Lord he went down there he's a busy God he went down there amen he went and testified to those people the first thing the scenes came up they were running all around Jerusalem waiting for him so they can take a flight up he went down and testified to those souls that did not believe the gospel I mean believe the message I was preaching Noah's dead in Moses day in Ezekiel day he testified to them and and and I mean wow every one of them coming to consciousness of war this is the one that Abraham talks about all this is the one that Moses was talking about the lawyer gosh I raised of a prophet he gave them a testimony he went down there talked to the tear dimension of Hell and took the keys of life from the devil I mean he was busy he was busy he were not just lying down in a grave as as a sorrowful day about it no he was busy and that is the same thing with our loved ones when we get down here why they carrying the funeral reception and people are crying we get busy on the other side shaking loved one here is good to see brother it's good to be here you know we get busy there is no Dom woman in this calling a man there is no door moving praise the Lord nor door moving his death did not stop him no sir he returned again not a tear person bought the same person returned again in the form of the Holy Spirit to continue the work continued on said the book of Acts Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Byrd Branham said that is the talking that is the talking we are talking about that's the talking life that's why he gave his he want to give us that talking life so he can continue on the work that he had promised praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord if I keep going like this I can preach for another hour Revelation chapter 1 I will stop on this verse and give you something to read and steady Revelation chapter 1 let's read the scripture says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him who is to him the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him many times we think is John no that's not John Jesus had a revelation that he was baring he was supposed to reveal the father in flesh the revelation of Jesus cried with God gave to him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his injured on to his seven John we will stop right there while he was bearing the revelation why in flesh he revealed a father he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost to revere the father in the many other bread reigns in the meaning of God's attributes he had a revelation of the father it was not a revelation of himself the revelation that God gave to him he was to declare the father and today we have the same revelation to declare the father because we are a continuation of that revelation the revelation we can see that God has given to us we have a revelation to declare the father that's the continuation of the book of Acts that's what the Holy Ghost is giving form that's what Luke is all excited here to share with you fellas he said all that Jesus began to do and teach and continue to do he continued to reveal himself he continued to show himself he loved to show up hey man why he was here he always had himself he goes by the riverside he goes and into the desert to stay there alone but when he came in the form of the Holy Ghost he loved to show up hey man he loved to show up he says wherever two or three I gather in my name I would be there he wants to show up in our homes he wants to show up in our situation give God an opportunity to show himself up in your situation oh you get a nice idea to solve the problem all of us it's beautiful but just keep God an opportunity Tim when you say Lord I place it in your hands don't start making planes place it in his hands and say Lord I'm just watching amen we put it in his hands and we made backup plane if you don't show up before this weekend this is what I'm going to do amen all give God an opportunity so he can show up in your situation because he loved to show up he loved to show up he loved for his children to see him so we can have a testimony we can have something to talk about the continuation of the book of Acts is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what it is it's the revelation of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's why the talking is all about that's what the talking life is all about it's Christ coming in bright form Christ coming in bright form the scripture says when Lazarus was sick the same for him he told him he was coming but he went a couple of days Johnny the more they were calling him the father he was going away praise the Lord the Father he was going away well after Jesus resurrected he was in that he was innocent in a celestial body so in their Celestra body he could travel as a thought he could move a little bit faster year there and other that's how he was showing himself to these many ones in 40 days it just gave me a little touch here that you were just trying to encourage showing showing up in a different prayer meetings going to the widows that believe in going in and even visiting the secret believers and encouraging them because of the sahih Drance council under the roman government there were many that was not showing himself up as disciples the because they did not wanted to be persecuted there were many secret secret believers and I believe when he resurrected he visited these ones in a special way maybe he never just went down and says well Joseph I'm alive but he passed by in a special way in his wife oh I saw someone like I was lon you know every time when he comes around you know that that sweet feeling someone just passed by let's go outside and check because all of this Romans was going around among the believer He is risen even Thomas did not believe it he says no or this your conspiracy theory I'm not going to believe it until I see it until I see I'm not going to believe it Lonnie oh how much how much Thomas loved him but there were just a lot of second stands around that was weakening his faith and when he showed up to that meeting that night it was not for everybody it was for Thomas he called him by name and say come on come on come on Thomas yes my hand put your finger he never called everybody he showed up at the meeting many saw him but he did that thing particularly for Thomas just to be able to raise his phone in such an hour God is moving he's doing things some things that will be testified and so sooner we get into the supernatural and started talks about what God is doing why should it be difficult for a brother or a sister to believe that God did this for another sister when a preacher come around is easy for us to believe it when the preacher says it but when the brother says it why should it be difficult is the same yesterday today and forever he's using common people he's showing himself to common people if you are expecting him and create an atmosphere of expectation he will show up in your situation he when I give you if he was show up and you would know that he was the one just like Thomas he said oh my lord oh my god praise the Lord let's bow our heads tonight we so appreciate I mean in our local assembly we have all of these little ones we have a lot of our sisters that are in the medical fee working in these nursing homes and fuel as they trust in the law to be to be nurses we have some you know working at the airport we have I mean people lab technicians we have I mean people that are in in different places different places [Music] wherever wherever grace have put us grace want to use you grace want to be seen through you in that situation or in their through their position wherever grace have placed us that's the reason why if you apply for a set for a certain job and you don't get it don't feel bad friends have a place that he want to use you maybe go who have never used you in that place oh I think if Christians will start asking God for a job where he will use them then just looking for the higher paid job we will get job so easily we will love it and we will glorify the Father because God will use their to meet our every need what an awesome God he is let's just sing that chorus Jesus
