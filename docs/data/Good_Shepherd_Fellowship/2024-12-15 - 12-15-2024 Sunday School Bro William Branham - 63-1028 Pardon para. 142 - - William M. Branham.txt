[Music] who is any sweeter than the old priest who is any greater than their priest he comes to you when you're born if he's a fuss the neighborhood he comes and settles it and he's always a peacemaker he's a loving man you know he is when you're in trouble you can go to him he helps you what about an nice man then speaking of this Jesus of Nazareth this priest we know who his father was his father's father father's father's father we got a school here that identifies him who is this Jesus of Nazareth what school did he come from what organization is he belong to what does he do but always fussing what does he say about that gentle old priest of yours he's of the devil Jesus said you you're the the devil is your father and his works you'll do could you imagine he went up in the temple looked up on the people with anger kicked over the uh sacrifices that Jehovah required and screamed out it's written my father's house has made a house of prayer and youve made it a dend of Thieves what would he do today if he come to our modern churches there'd be some more table moving there'd be some more H jumping or t to Pieces it would be the same thing don't you see Jesus is very scriptural he was the word he had not to write anything he was the word he was the Living Word and the people failed to recognize it and how can a man today upon the principle of what Jesus Promised these signs to all the world and this blessing to all the world and the Holy Ghost to fall just like it did in the beginning on whosoever God would call how can a man call himself a Christian and deny that word and say the holy spirit's in him amen the Holy Spirit Will punctuate every word of God with an amen that's exactly right oh brother our Educational Systems has draw us away from it and there are are denominations that separate us from one another and from Christ but what they continue to do that and you take a subtitute any other thing is no more than fig leaves again God rejects it but when the church comes under the blood of Jesus Christ with a token of the Holy Spirit upon them then you're going to see Brotherhood again you're going to see a church full of power you're going to God hates a powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as Jesus Christ promised they zeroed in on the word of God back there and believed it it hit the target you zero the same way on the word of God and it hit the target again it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever God don't like a powerless religion God does not want that God wants to perform God wants to show himself alive our very hopes is the resurrection is that right our hopes of life is Resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ you see God wants to work in this church Jesus said I'll be with you always even to the end of the world the works that I do shall you do also St John 12:14 The Works that I do shall you do also even more than this shall you do for I go to my father now the church tries to deny that to get away to get more members to be more popular now I want to ask you something the God is trying to perform perform in his church and the church is trying to perform by the Creed and the two can't work together you've got to get rid of the Creed and get Christ in and how can you do it when he sees the blood when the blood has been applied with a sincere heart and a hand laid Upon Jesus Christ and a heart that's true before God to confess his wrong and be borned of the Holy Spirit then the works of God would follow as he said it would do yeah Church wants to perform through the Creeds the see enemy members that can get God wants to perform through the power of the blood to get Christians born again that's exactly the difference of do you must hum must reject to do this they you've got to reject the Holy Spirit and his performing power to accept the Creed you have to see the truth before you can accept an error if you're going to be a Christian you can't you have to walk over God's promise and order to get an arrow because there's a red light flashing before you all the time this is the word they say well that was for some other day it's for today because Christ is the word is that right St John 1 in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever so if Christ is the word every promise is true and it's the same yesterday today and forever it has to be it takes a born again Faith to believe it and make it operate just you can't do it with tradition it won't work you've got to come to that blood just as sure as anything after Israel told after Isaiah told Israel that they had polluted their substitute by their Traditions there appeared another Prophet before we Clos another great prophet come on the scene that was John the baptizer now he pointed them to a lamb that would take would do not only for Israel but all of Adam's Fallen race he said there was God was go to send a lamb and this lamb would be for Gentile Jew and whosoever would come it wasn't very long until the lamb was nailed to his alter cross his blood was shed the Holy Spirit came back now when the old animal lamb died the spirit of the animal could not come back so that blood was just applied to a nation but now for all of Adam's race the Lamb of God that was shed his blood the token came back in the form of the Holy Spirit to come upon the worshipper now that's what God requires that's what they did at that day and that's what they they do today now if any person feels the weight of sin and you know that you're wrong listen there is pardon and that pardon is through God's lamb do you believe that amen it's through the lamb through the blood of the Lamb I was told a little story once that help help me lot there's a boy that was kidnapped in the early days I suppose all of he's taking Bible History and taking the history of the church and then I believe it was the fox but no it was an Nia fathers or the life of St Patrick St Patrick was actually that was just the name was giving his name was susat and he was he was kidnapped by a bunch of of sea Rovers and was hired out to be a hog Riser and this story goes at this kid was kidnapped and taken a aboard of a ship and he was working his way and the old Captain taken sick one day and was just about ready to die and he was so sick way out on sea the old fellow with his gry beard laying in his cabin and he called his hands his deck man said is there a Bible among you said when I was a a child I had Christian raising and said I I'm dying and and and man I I don't want to die like this he said have you got the word of God any man here has got the word of God finally way back in a bunch a man a little boy stood up and he said sir I have a Bible I am a Christian I pack it with me he said come here Sunny he said do you mean you pack a Bible he said yes said my mother and father was Christians and I gave my life to Christ when I was just a teeny little fell and I packed his word with me wherever I go said I put it up on my heart and it's been in my heart he said read me something out there son before I die and the little fellow turned over to Isaiah 5 three and five and it reads like this he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the Chast of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and when he said that the old Captain said can you read on the little boy said may I comment here and the old Captain said to the lad said go ahead he said my Christian mother before I was taken from her said you know she used to read that scripture to me so much and you know way she read it and the old Captain said no son I like to hear the way your Christian mother read it she said he said here's the way she read it he was wounded for Willie PRS transgressions he was bruised for Willie puits iniquity the chastisement of Willie pritz was up on him and with his stripes Willie puit was healed the old Captain said I like that I like that said oh if my name could only be read in there he said you think you could do it son he said I'll try it he said he was wounded for John Court's transgressions he was bruised for John Court's iniquity the chastisement of John Court's peace was up on him and with his stripes John Court was healed with tears running down his beard he said fetch me my clothes Jesus Christ says healed me I give my life to him see oh friend if you can only read your name in there oh if I can read my name he was wounded for William bram's transgressions he was bruised not the church not this not Creed but he was bruised for a i iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon on him and with his stripes William Brandon was healed oh if we can just read our name into scripture and really mean it it's that what does it read our name into it makes a uh uh receiving the pardoning for when we realize that he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity another thing we find out in Hebrews 911 that pardoning produces p Purity the worshipper having no more conscience of sin and has cleansed itself from Dead traditions when we really come under the blood we are cleansed from Dead traditions the scripture says so Hebrews n watch cleanse your conscience from Dead traditions then if you do that forget that you are a Baptist forget you are a Methodist forget you are a Pentecostal whatever you are and forget those Dead traditions and come to the blood come to that read your name and that and then do this then come to the communion table then come and find out who's right and wrong whether it's going to be a closed communion or not see if you can shut your brother out you can't do it you just can't do it there's something in you won't let you do it there's just something you see your name is read among those and you can't do it it purifies you it cleanses you remembering him as we kneel at the cross let him be a Catholic priest Presbyterian whatever he may be let that man come as he reads his name in there he was wounded for this priest's transgressions he is wounded for this Methodist this Baptist this Pentecostal what wounded for our transgressions my name your name whatever you are let us believe that not what the Creed says what the word says then let us kneel down on the cross together we're brothers oh yes the itions we cleanse oursel then from All Dead traditions they could be 40 State presb there could be 40 High priests there could be Cardinals and Bishops and popes and everything else H get up from there don't pollute yourself but you got your arms around your brother there's something real you've got pardoned under the same atonement that he's pardoned by your brother's it sticks closer than a brother it's something about it that draws you so close to God and when you draw close to God you draw close to each other how can you hate your brother who you do see or despise him and say you love God who you have not seen you become a liar and the truth's not in you but when we come to a place where the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin then we are brothers then there's no difference in us our little old brands that we attacked on us don't mean a thing I remember there I passed the gate the other day and was referring to one of the brothers sitting here where used to heard cattle and coming through there the ranger would Mark those cattle as he went through in the spring Roundup and he watched he never they had all kinds of brands on him but he never noticed the brand he watched for the blood tag and it had to be a third bred Herford or it couldn't go on the repit forest for the Herford Association graay there it had to be a third Brad Herford I think that's the way it'll be at the end time he won't say are you a Methodist was you a Baptist that's a big question today what what are you are you a Methodist Baptist I said no or what are you uh president Luther Nazarene Pentecostal no what are you a Christian a Christian the blood tag see under the blood that means that every brother sister under that blood is my brother sister very deep sincerity there before Christ we the priest the preacher what more lay our hands upon our sacrifice and say we are guilty Sinners we're not worthy of your mercy oh God but you sent your son to die in our place and we freely accept it oh we're brothers then all the old fussing is over it's all gone we're sincerely pardoned you go pardon and cleansed from sin cleansed from tradition old things has passed away old fusses is over all the Baptist methodists and Presbyterians are all cleansed by the same blood and we become brothers traditional fusses is over then can Fellowship here and there only can we Fellowship amen I've seen Presbyterians stand in these Full Gospel businessman's meetings speaking in tongues and shouting as hard as he could and some of the most outstanding Presbyterians is in the United States Jim Brown how many ever met him well an outstanding Presbyterian stand here and dance in the spirit and speak in tongues and carry on here and a pastor of one of the most famous Presbyterian churches in the United States Lutheran methodists pray all together what is it they have come under the blood there's no tags there's no denominational bearers we're one we are Christians we have things in common yes you're not long ago in closing there was a man and a woman husband and wife was separating and they tried to make up they went to psychiatrist to find out if he could draw their minds together but he couldn't they went to everything that they could think of to try to stay together but they just fussed and contined they were divided and they just couldn't stand each other and couldn't stand in each other's presence and they go to fussing so they decided that they had divorce so they hir a lawyer to give him a divorce and he said well now before we do it said we'll sell the place and said you all better go down and divide the spars between you before you get the divorce and the place is sold so the husband and wife went together they went to the home and they went into the living room and she said I'm going to take this and he said I'm going to take this and they get pussed and they stewed and carried on with one another after a while they'd say well I'll give you this if you take this all right that went on a while then they went into the Parlor and a different places and into the kitchen and into the bedroom they divided their spars then finally they remembered there's some stuff in the Attic So they went up into the attic and they pulled out an old trunk and they begin to lay out different things say you can have this and you can have this and finally both of their eyes fell on a certain little object and they both grabbed for and they look at each other what was it a pair of little white shoes that belong to a baby that had deceased it was part of both of them there with their hands claps like that over this baby's shoe really who did it belong to whose was it it belonged to both of them they had things in common in a few minutes as one looked to the other tears begin to run down their cheeks what they could divide everything else but when they come to they had something in common the child and it was in heaven then the fuss was over in a few minutes they were in each other's arms the divorce was settled peace reign brother let me say this to you tonight we're not wanting you to join a church but I'm asking you this there's one thing that we have in common that's Jesus Christ he's in common with us we can't all be Baptists we can't all be method we can't all be Oneness or threeness or whatever it is we can't be that but there's one thing we have in common that's the pardoning offer of God his son Jesus Christ we have all things in him but that's the first thing for us to accept then we can get other things when we accept the pardon that God has offered us and that won't be through our educational system through our denominational system but it'll be through the blood of Jesus Christ we all can meet there of the Cross and be one and have things in common you believe that let us bow our heads just a moment while we pray with heads bowed surely Hearts bowed let's bow our hearts just a minute now with our heads saying Lord with my heart bowed now with all that of my tradition am I right or wrong let the Holy Spirit search through the heart now and if it's not just where it should be and you would like to be remembered in prayer in the closing that you know that we can all meet under one thing the blood the atonement and when we do then we're cleansed from all the things of the world and you'd like to be remembered in prayer would you let it know by uplift your hand to God say God bless you oh my the hands Remember Me Oh Lord do you realize that we haven't got many more days to stroll through this Earth you say well I'm young I know I don't know sister brother there'll be a many teenager di tonight across the world hundreds of them no only thing you have is what breath is left in you will you at this time say with my hand up Lord God I accept the pardon that you offered the blood of Jesus Christ now let the broken from the blood the Holy Spirit come upon me I haven't received the Holy Ghost I I know it and I I want to receive that something it makes me feel the way you're talking about that my sins are all gone and the world the love of the world is passed from me and I'm a new creature I want to know that in my heart and God I'm not raising my hand to brother Brandon but I'm raising it to you and you know in my heart and don't anyone look up just let God see this alone and say God I I I want the token that the blood has been applied to me and I want to raise your hand say pray for me brother brandom Lord bless you that's fine no matter what you are Methodist Baptist Presbyterian it's for whosoever will now I have seen nothing against those churches that they're all right but what I'm trying to say that that won't save you see it's got to be God's pardon uh uh pardoning Grace and it's only represented not through a church but through the blood of Jesus Christ that's your substitute when you can lay your hands upon him and say now I accept this substitute God be merciful to me and maybe there may be church members here that has join church with all good sincerity I believe that with all my heart you drawn with sincerity but you say brother random really my heart hasn't been cleansed from all these traditions and things I I believe if someone to speak against the very church that I if the Bible would even say tell me I we prove of the Bible that my church is wrong I I still couldn't accept it from my heart I couldn't do it but I want to pray for me would you raise your hand say pray I'll do it yes I sure will God Bless you that's good that's fine I I want to be able to accept everything that God said just the way he did in his Bible and I want the blood of Jesus Christ to come upon me and if the blood is applied the token see there is a token given of the blood and that's the Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit came down on the day of Pentecost you know what it did to the people and every time that it ever will come upon the people it'll do the very same thing Peter said for the promise isn't to you to your children to them it's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call this same promise if 10 cents is 10 cents here it's 10 cents out there it's wherever it's at it's 10 cents if this is a diamond here it's a diamond there if this is a house sh it's a house there and if this is the holy spirit it fell on the day of Pentecost it's a same Holy Spirit today and you have never ex found that experience accept it now while we pray will you our heavenly father knowing that that the sun is swiftly going down time shall be no more one day the great Archangel will step out on the scene of time from out of Eternity and the trumpet of God shall sound and every man and woman will answer to what we know to be the truth the word of God there's got to be some standard that God has to have here on Earth that we're to be judged by and if we took the standard of our church our denomination how far would we miss it and which denomination would be right therefore we' be confused we wouldn't know what to do but there is a standard and that is your word and your word said except the man be born borned again he cannot even see the kingdom of God in other words he cannot understand it he must be accepted by faith and be born again and then he will understand it see is to understand and we pray God tonight that many of those hands going up tonight all over the building businessman of the city and women boys and girls I believe with sincerity they raise their hands now they could not raise their hands unless there was a conviction and the Holy Spirit by them has proved to them that they are wrong and brought conviction that they want to be right and they raised up their hands to you the great Creator knowing that they have to meet you someday and they were sincere I believe Lord and I'm interceding for each one I trust tonight Lord as I pray that not one hand that went up will ever be able to have rest until the Holy Spirit has filled their life granted Lord I claim them for the trophies of Jesus Christ do it Lord I pray Save The Lost fill those who have accepted Christ with the Holy Ghost pour it out upon their souls father get Glory unto thyself Jesus you have said to us no man can come to me except my father draws him first and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God and now word of God being preached faith comes by hearing and they have been drawn because the Bible said those who he forne he predestinated and those who he predestinated he called and those who he called he gave eternal life and now back in the beginning before the world you put their names upon the Lamb's Book of Life and tonight the Holy Spirit has called and they rais their hands now Lord give them eternal life I asked it for the glory of God that the holy spirit will come down in their hearts and circumcise them from all dead works and traditions and give them free pardoning and fill them with his presence that they might go forth from this day in the hour of Darkness like it was in the days of Sodom when painted faed women immorality shook the Nations oh Lord God May men and women go forth as burning blazes May the Holy Spirit literally send Holy Fire upon them Lord until they'll be so filled with God's goodness and and that they'll go forth to call every sinner that they come in contact to the Cross Grant it Lord where they too can fall and find pardoning do that to the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals and all Lord granted they are yours now I commit them into your hands that you will grant this to them in Jesus Christ's name amen you Lov him [Music]
