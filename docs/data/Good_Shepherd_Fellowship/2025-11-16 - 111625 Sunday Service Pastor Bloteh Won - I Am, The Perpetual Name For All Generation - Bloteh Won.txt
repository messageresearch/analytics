Sorry. All right, let's sit as we listen to Sister Naomi's testimony. God bless you. Want to give God the glory for protecting me Wednesday night. Wednesday is my day off and so I have a lot of work to do that day up at my house and seeing my brothers and all kinds of stuff. And I just love to come to church. So, I come even if I'm tired and I've been praying that the Lord would um please get rid of all the construction going up to St. Cloud so that it's not so hard over the winter. And I was just so blessed. Um initially of course when my daughter actually my daughter Esther taught me always pray before you drive mom you know. works because the Lord protected her once on a major thing. And so she always would do that. So I just like breathe a quick prayer as I take off. And as I'm traveling up to St. Cloud, I'm seeing uh wait a second. Where was that? Uh wasn't there construction over here? And and like looking Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I know there was How come the roads are so good? Am I on the right road? And things are going so marvelously well. I was just praising the Lord all the way to St. Cloud. Well, there was a 22 miles from my destination. That's when the construction stopped normally. And so when I got to that spot, I was like, it's it really is done. I am on the right road. This is the right thing. And I just thought, wow, this is just so awesome. I just was having such a feast just praising the Lord all the way there because I was thinking, okay, we got winter coming, icy roads, construction, just, you know, it's got to stop. Well, I was driving behind a semi and I decided, uh, you know, I I just feel like I want to pass him. So, I just went in the left lane, threelane road. Right after I moved over now, there was a deer in the lane on the right side just standing right away after I had turned over. And you know, I was praising the Lord. It didn't even phase me. There he was. The semi was right in the middle. Um I was driving. I just kept on driving. I was having fun with the Lord and I was just like, "Where wait a minute? Where'd that semi go?" And I am I still to the I I don't check reports, but all of a sudden the semi was gone and all the all the traffic that was behind me that was there was quite a bit of traffic. All of a sudden there was no traffic. I just saw little lights off in the distance. I just want to give glory to the Lord because I feel like had I gone in the right lane, I would have hit the deer right off. Had I stayed behind a semi, you can figure out what that would be. So you guys have stuck with me for a little while longer. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus this morning. Amen. We want to bless God for such a wonderful miracle. Amen. May God continue to bless and protect us as we drive on um the traffic. Let's go ahead and stand as we praise the Almighty God this morning. Amen. We are here to sing and dance and just worship this morning. Forget about everything. Just focus on him this morning and just bless him. Amen. Yeah. I'm pressing on the upward way. New heights I'm gaining in every day. Stand still and pray as onward bound. Lord, plant my feet on higher ground. Lord, lift me up and let me stand my feet on heaven. A stable land, a higher plane that higher found. Love plant my feet on higher ground. I'm s and let me stand by faith on heaven. A stable land, a higher plane that I have found.

We feel blessed to have you with us this morning. Going to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Good morning, Aunt Jackie. &gt;&gt; Morning. &gt;&gt; I have to come over and greet you personally &gt;&gt; just from a distance. Amen. Praise the Lord. So good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. We just want to thank the Lord for all his goodness, his love, his mercy. Praise the Lord. And we greet you all this morning that you see the grace of God on your faces. Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh this morning we want to greet uh uh brother Kenneth and uh and his wife, Sister Kenny. Praise the Lord. Kenneth, if you and your wife would stand up. And uh it been a while for us to be able to introduce them like this because uh we were we were working on all the the things that needed to be worked on. Amen. But we are glad to have them. They are just from home. They were down with Sister Ke mother and uh George is from there in Connecticut. So I I spotted him on the on the video entering. So I I sent for him to give me the report. So the report is well. So uh we are glad to have both for you with us. Amen. God bless you Rich. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And our sister not being well, but for good cause. So, we will continue to keep her in our prayer that the Lord will continue to strengthen her. Amen. Praise the Lord. And uh before I forget u uh I was just listening to uh uh the tape on my way here and and brother Bon was talking about uh the the sovereignty of the local church and uh so we want to thank God that that God has given us such a thing to be able to guide us. you know that uh that uh one man not me not anybody can have. Uh so there there was a proposed uh uh Thanksgiving dinner that the sisters wanted to to get us together. And uh uh by the way there's there's no service on Wednesday. There's no service on Wednesday. Uh because Thanksgiving some of you will be having your family Thanksgiving. So it's next week, not this week. Oh my god. Praise the Lord. I'm too ahead of myself. Thank you. Thank you for catching me. Not this week. So Wednesday this week we have service. Please. Wednesday this week we will have service. Can you remind me to announce it after service because I'm just too ahead of myself. Praise the Lord. But that week of Thanksgiving, there will be no service Wednesday. We normally do that because either we have a Thanksgiving service on the weekend and Saturday and Sunday. So then we we allow people to spend time with family and friends. And uh and I think the reason why I got ahead of myself a little bit is because uh uh I became a little bit passionate last night or the or the day before just thinking about this whole thing. And the most recent, you know, I was talking with uh uh uh brother Steve or uh brother brother Max uh u you know the reason why I think u uh it is important for us to be able to encourage this is because just having uh time to spend together is also part of our spiritual growth. Time to spend together out of these four walls with me not being behind this pit and and the deacons don't have to put people in their seat and you know and everybody can be able to just be free and converse with one another is a big part of our our growth as a body that we don't we don't get to do much because beside having service we don't want to use this place for anything else and uh so we just cannot organize anything year we we we have uh we want to keep this place just for worship just for prayer and uh uh and then for the preaching of the word but uh so uh so we were able to convince oursel that yeah it's good for us to be able to support that normally we would meet on July 4th we have an outdoor event we never did it this year because uh I was dreaming for the young people to go for camp to have their first experience to be away from home for the week. That was where my my strength was. My my my zeal, my energy was into that. So whatever was happening on on July 4th, I was my mind was not in it. And so I really want to encourage that and and not only for this uh coming uh uh Thanksgiving weekend, it will be on the weekend. It will not be on Thanksgiving day. It will be that Saturday. So you can have your your family time, you know, or visit family and friends on Thursday, but then on Saturday, I think there's a print out of the direction and uh that we will be able to hand out to you. We have uh some copies out there, but we will give them out on Wednesday. we will give them out on uh next Sunday so we can have enough time to to be able to uh prepare ourselves. So uh I think it's almost like a lot of people sisters are different sisters are preparing food and you know bringing uh what to share. Bring your leftovers from your Thanksgiving. I love leftovers. Amen. So uh if I just if one table is just set for leftover, let it be for me. Praise the Lord. So, uh, with that being said, uh, Christmas also falls on Wednesday. Wednesday or, uh, is that right? Wednesday. &gt;&gt; Thursday. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, uh, uh, that week also, we would not have service on Wednesday night, but we will have service on, uh, on the weekend. uh uh Saturday night and Sunday morning. I hope to be able to have our friend, brother Zia Jason, to come and minister for us that weekend. And uh uh and then um and then the 31st falls on Wednesday. Okay. Okay. Okay. We'll get it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Okay. So, the 31st should be on Wednesday and then we will have our 31st service. for our tele first night service and u we will come in uh uh we'll be seated around about 9 9 a.m. 900 p.m. Somebody help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. will be seated around 900 p.m. that night and uh if the Lord will lead us the way that feeling lay for the service to go uh uh we will do our worship and thanksgiving and everything just into the the new year and then uh we will now start our our service. We have anything to preach we will do that after but I want for us to express our gratitude in praise and and so one thing I would encourage is that if you want to write your testimony, if you want to express a thanks, you want to write it and give it to the deacon, we will appreciate that. If you also want to write u uh uh a song from the from the songs we sing that we should sing it as a congregation, just write I would love for us to sing this song. Give it to the deacon. We will we will uh because I know we have uh a lot of good singers. They're just shy to come up to sing. So we will now want to call you to uh to to embarrass ourself. So just write if you would love for us to sing a song. Just write our love for us to sing this song and then we will see how much we can be able to accommodate that night. Another thing um I'm I'm thinking on and uh I have to work on uh uh if we stay based on how we going to plan the service uh I will I would like to u offer the u breakfast that morning but uh normally we would use the denny's down the street here but they have just closed so they do not operate. Now I need to find a place. Normally I would go and talk to them and I after the service we would go there but they have shut down. They are closed. So we need to find another place that I need to work for before that time. So uh that is just in the air. Praise the Lord. we can get a place that can be able to accommodate every those that will be here and those that will come. Uh uh I would like for us to have our first meal together. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So uh that is the plan. Uh if I can remind you and remind myself uh not this uh Wednesday, the next Wednesday there will be no service on Wednesday night uh uh for that will be receiving family in and and all of that. Uh you see uh well let me let me just leave you as let me just leave you as there'll be no service and uh if you'll be traveling you have a safe travel those that will be in town and uh uh you can you can visit one another at home and uh meet up You know, I know uh most of us spend our time working. That's that's also good. But we have to realize that the uh the people that God put in our lives and the people that he put around us are very important. Praise the Lord. They are very important. Uh sometimes we don't we get so used to it, the thought of it and even uh you know that we don't we really don't put it in perspective of how much they are important to us until something major happen that uh they can you know they can be there like we would want them to be there. So let's let's uh you know let's let's put in time to really treasure the ones that God has given us. Amen. Praise the Lord. I know for some of us and many of us, you know, loved ones are far away, but you have you have people that you come to church with, you know, that you can visit and you can, you know, go out for for for breakfast, you know, go out for for some form of visitation. Let's uh let's let's let's appreciate that. I will wish that you know in the future as we work on our building project if the Lord blesses it we have a fellowship hall I mean more of that we will do all the time praise the Lord amen so that is it for uh for announcement this morning that is it for announcement there's no service on uh uh the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and the Wednesday before Christmas we won't have no service And we plan to have a weekend service uh Saturday night and Sunday morning uh for Christmas. Praise the Lord. And then our all night on the 31st of December, we will choose to start at 900 p.m. the service will start and then uh we'll trust the Lord to see how he will bless the night service. Praise the Lord. So that's it for the announcement this morning and uh we just want to we want to u let's stand on our feet and praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let's sing this song by the area. I wanted to kind of merge this song. Hallelujah. I'm walking with the king also with uh if you are not walking start what I'm talking So let's let's try the Hallelujah. I'm walking with the King. I'm walking with the King. Praise his holy name. Oh, I'm walking with the king. Hallelujah. I'm walking with the king every day. I'm walking with the king. Oh, hallelujah. I'm walking with the king. Praise his glory. I'm walking with the king. Oh, hallelujah. I'm walking with the king every day. I'm walking. Let's do it one more time. Oh, hallelujah. I'm walking with the king. Praise his holy name. Walking with the king. Oh, hallelujah. I'm walking with the king every day. I'm walking with the king. Oh, if you are thou walking, that's what I'm talking the king my way. I am glorying walking on the gates high. There's a highway to heaven. One can walk again. It's a highway to the heaven. Walking on the king high. Hallelujah. I'm walking with the king. Praise his holy name. Walking with the Oh, hallelujah. I'm walking with the king. Every day I'm walking with the king. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was beautiful. That was beautiful. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless you. Thank you, musicians. Let's take our Bibles. Amen. Let's take our Bibles and turn to Genesis chap chapter 3. Exodus chapter 3. Oh my God. Oh my God. Exodus chapter 3. I want to preach a message of faith this morning, trusting that the Lord will bless it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. While we were over away in Zimbabwe in August, there's one of the speakers, brother Lubanza from our language, uh, he he spoke during the meeting. So he said at the beginning that uh he was he was not going to preach like a preacher. What he wanted to do was to bring something that we all can practice. So he says I mean we know the word. I mean before the preacher called you know exactly what he's going to say. The biggest problem is that we don't put into practice the things that we preach. So he started preaching. Uh wonderful, wonderful speaker. He started preaching and then uh uh there was something he said and I I wrote it down. I took a note of what he was preaching and then I came home. You know, he's he's a brother that is he's very blessed in u in looking at what he called the soul science. He called it the science of the soul. And and the way what he does is preaching on the consciousness, you know, he likes to preach on the consciousness. And uh and because he says uh he thinks that's what the message of the hour has brought us. It's a consciousness of God. &gt;&gt; It's not a historical God that is far away. It's a God that is here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is a God that is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we if we just enter in a little bit, you will feel his presence. You can get a hold of him. You can talk to him. So he's he's gear in that way. He love to to go in that direction. So a little thought I talk in uh studied on and I want to bring to you this morning. So uh uh Exodus chapter 3 just uh uh for the scriptural reading, let's read from verse one. Now, now Moses kept the flood of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flood to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Herod. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush, and he looked, and behold, the bch burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burned. And the Lord saw that he turned aside to see. God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Yeah, am I. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here am I. And he said, "Draw not nine, hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the place where on thou standed is a holy ground." Moreover, he said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the conversation went on and the Lord start to tell him the reason of this visitation and we drop to verse 13. And after Moses has listened to the Lord, verse 13. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers have sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, what is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said, "Thus shall thou say unto the children of Israel, I am have sent me unto you." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we want to ask blessing upon your word this morning. Lord God, we uh labor with prayers and and uh just keeping ourel availing upon your children. So father we pray this morning may you just come and help us Lord as we go into this direction. We love you, we thank you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have your seat. If uh if the detecting can just post my co there this is uh maybe the one quote I might use I might quote some other things but this will be the warning uh one be reading this morning praise the Lord this is from Hebrew chapter 1 he said before Abraham was that's Jesus speaking in John chapter 8 Jesus speaking is in John chapter Before Abraham was I am, there he is. Who was the I am a perpetual name for all generations. Praise the Lord. That's what I want to speak on this morning. I am the perpetual name for all generation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray that I I be able to find the the grace and the liberty to be able to bring this to you this morning. Amen. The per the perpetual name for all generation. That was that pillar of fire in a burning b. I am that I am. There he was. that till finally he made you called the son of God the I am the Jehovah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I am the Jehovah. The perpetual name for all generation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is going to be a little bit out of my my my character, but I will try to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will try to. Now, uh uh as we look at this, I was looking at that word perpetual it defined as this in the Bible. Perpetual can means either uh continuous uh without interruption or everlasting in enduring forever. The specified meaning depends on the context what perpetual is used for in the Bible. It talks about uh uh the perpetual coveting uh means uh the perpetual statue uh speaking about the continuous law. Uh perpetual coveting will be the everlasting coveting. So perpetual uh uh you know uh speaks about an enduring okay an enduring uh uh uh you know uh an an everlasting a continuous a continuous name to all generation. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me let me start by saying by by introducing my thought like this. When the great creator, praise the Lord, when the great creator uh uh started his creation, uh we we we we we have to know and understand that uh one time God dwed by himself. It was just he and he alone. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was he and he alone. And at the time he der by himself, he filled all space and and and it was just interned to God. There was not a beginning. There was not an end. Praise the Lord. Amen. But uh this great God with all his abilities thought that he should be able to display his abilities and his characters and make himself known. So for God to start a creation, he has to move from that state of being an internal spirit to have a beginning. Because eternity does do not have a beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So for there to start anything up out of eternity, there has to be a beginning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the great internal God in in one sense had to condense himself and give himself a beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. living from the state of being internal spirit. That process of condensing himself to take a form. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That begins the beginning. &gt;&gt; When Moses said in the beginning, when John says in the beginning was the word, the word was with God. The word was God. That is the beginning. The beginning was when the great internal uh uh uh God decided to condense himself, take another form and start a beginning. So uh uh uh in that way we will understand that when God started creating everything that was created had a part of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God in some way after creation, even when you read the Bible and you look at nature, you will see that he's all in his creation. &gt;&gt; His fingerprints are all over the creation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it was such it was such uh uh you know, beautiful work start by being messy work. It all start by being messy and then it turned out to be beautiful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe with the anxiousness in his thought of of of creating expressing his ability it was it was all messy. Let me say it that way because the the Bible say the earth was without form and body and the darkness was all so it was messy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has to be gathering this and gathering this just just to drama. I told you people it's out of my character. Amen. But I'm trying my best. So bear with me. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh and and and and it it has to be messy. But the the what I'm trying to bring out is that his fingerprints &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; is in everything that he has made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in everything. go on the mountains and just stay on the mountains alone and you look down, you see the height, you look at the cloud, pretty soon you will see his fingerprints. &gt;&gt; Just go by the lake and and and and and enter into the quietness of the lake. Let the lake speaks to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will feel you will see his fingerprints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fingerprint is in everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this great uh uh uh story of uh these uh uh you know uh uh people trying to trap Jesus. And the Bible says that you know they were trying to trap him. They were trying to to get him in trouble with the Lord. I believe they waited to see some some some Roman soldier was around and he came around and asked Jesus you know uh uh you know about paying uh tribute. Praise the Lord. And uh and and and we find that there the you know when the disciples came to Jesus he told them well you gave to Caesar what is Caesar and then give to God what is God. Praise the Lord. But you see before he told them that he took a coin. He took a Roman coin. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He took a Roman coin and uh uh uh and that coin had an image on it. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when he took it, he told them whose image is this? &gt;&gt; They say Caesar. If you can identify that that Caesar image is on this thing, then you give to Caesar what his image is on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then give to God what is God. But you will not be able to give to God what is God until just like you are able to identify Caesar's image on this coin, you must identify what the image of God is of &gt;&gt; for you to give it to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you can tell me that this coin is Caesar image, then give to Caesar what is Caesar. &gt;&gt; Then you give to God what is God. But for you to be able to give to God what is God, you must also be able to identify &gt;&gt; God's image. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in another sense also Jesus is also uh uh you know uh uh proving to us that yeah God put his prince. He put uh his his his image in in in in making us. is not just a statement that we are made in the image or the likeness of God. But uh just like every faction uh uh designer would like to put a little tie on the uh on the uh the uh you know their design or the clothes that they have they have sworn. God also has put his signature. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has also put his signature. He has put his his fingerprint. He has put his image &gt;&gt; on his creation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Until when he was making known his ways to the children of men, he showed himself to us as uh even in the different creatures. We've been looking at uh those images. We've been using talking about the anointing. It is the power of God. The anointing is the power of God. But yet God took images through the scripture to show his anointing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm coming down to this to this thought that I have in my mind of this perpetual name that I am. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and he sees is a is a is a is a perpetual name to all generation. It's an everlasting name. Not only referring to the the pillar of fire that was in the bush, not only referring to when Jesus in St. John chapter 8 told the disciples that I am the one that was with Abraham. But Jesus in the gospel of John, you will see he used this I am seven definite times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was called he says I am the bread of life. I am the light of the word. Yes. These were Jesus direct statement. I am the door to the sheepfall. &gt;&gt; I am the good shepherd. He said &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; Yes. I am the way, the truth and the life. &gt;&gt; And you also say I am the vine and you are the branch Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was not just only identifying with that I am that that met with Moses or the I am that he proved that was with Abraham. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will realize that uh God never used that phrase I am to Abraham. But when Jesus came, he said before Abraham was I am. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which mean the I am met Abraham. &gt;&gt; But in a different way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we want to look at this morning because uh in in in a simple way that I would say it is that we all do bear the I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's I mean that is the most common way that we introduce ourself. I am brother one time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am brother one. Now, it's it's as as as simple as as it looks like. &gt;&gt; I want us to see the the seriousness of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we must realize that the I am IS GOD'S PERPETUAL NAME. &gt;&gt; It's his perpetual name. That's that is the emphasis I want to make this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. That's the emphasis I want to make this morning for us to realize that that is God's perpetual name and uh and if we realize that pretty soon we will be we we will come to consciousness that that all of our life we have we have misused the name of God. Praise the Lord. which of course in the ten commandments God told the children of Israel that his name must not be taken in vain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Like I said, if you would just if you would just channel this thought to faith. Yeah. Uh like I said, I want I want to I want to speak in a line of faith this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in a common way we all we all identify ourself with the I am. Whatever we add to I am that is our human part. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the part that came after God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever we we are to I am. I am brother one. Brother one came after God. Do &gt;&gt; you grab the thought? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother one, he came after God. &gt;&gt; Because after God has made me &gt;&gt; and my parents birthed me, &gt;&gt; then they name me one blooded. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when WHEN WHEN THAT LIFE was formed Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that life was was was carried by my mother. My parents had to take on a name to attach to that life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But that life was the life of the I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where I'm going with THESE THOUGHTS? &gt;&gt; THAT LIFE was the life of the I am. And then whatever comes after the I am that's that's the human part. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you will realize that whatever we connect to I am we become. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am is the perpetual is the uh uh everlasting name of God. His enduring name. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will see even the the the the seven redemptive names of Jehovah. It reveals the I am. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I am the Lord that health &gt;&gt; your diseases. &gt;&gt; I am the LORD THAT PROVIDE for you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even in the seven redemptive name just as Jesus seven time in the in the gospel of John identified himself with the I am. Praise the Lord. So what I'm trying to bring across to us for us to be able to see is they are the uh it's it's something that I want for us to to to be conscious with conscious about. Now on uh on on Wednesday night we talked a little bit there in uh uh Matthew chapter 22. Let's go back there. Let's go back there. Matthew chapter 22. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 22, before we get to our reading, our reading there is in 34, but let's look at verse 31. Matthew 22, 31, and 32. Praise the Lord. Now uh uh 31 right right there you will realize that the the Sadducees were trying to trap Jesus. That's where the story began from. They were trying to trap Jesus. So they came up with this story and said well you know in the in the Lord Moses said when a man's dying his brother must be able to marry his wife to raise up child in his name. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to realize it's under that same law that Boaz married Ruth. It was under that very same law. It's a law of redemption. Now, so uh so they were trying to trap Jesus and they said, "Well, okay, this woman has seven brothers and uh uh uh you know, the first died, the second died, the tear died, the fourth died." And and and so they said, "Well, then in the resurrection, whose wife is she going to be?" If you say there is a resurrection, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says uh uh uh in verse 29, Jesus answered and said unto them, you heard and know not the scripture, not the power of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know the scripture and you don't know the power of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I love that because why? The power of God back the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The power of God is the life behind the scripture. You don't know the scripture. You don't know the power of God. He said, "For in the resurrection, they neither marry. None are giving in marriage, but they are they they are they are as the angels of God in heaven." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So another sense there is that you don't know the power of God. When we get out of this body, the power of God is going to take every sinful desire from us. Amen. When we get out of this body, the power of God is GOING TO TAKE EVERY SEXUAL DESIRE FROM THIS BODY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; So you don't know the power of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you don't know the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now he goes on and he says in verse 31, "But as touching the resurrection &gt;&gt; of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, what is he quoting?" Exodus chapter 3. Jesus is quoting Exodus chapter 3. That's why we just read here in Exodus chapter 3 when he met Moses. &gt;&gt; He says, uh, I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I AM THE GOD OF ISAAC. &gt;&gt; I am the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you do you see it there in the scripture? &gt;&gt; You see what Jesus is identifying &gt;&gt; being the perpetual name of God. HE NEVER APPEARED to Moses and said, "I was the God of Abraham." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; IN ANOTHER SENSE, EVEN IF OUR LOVED ONE PASS AWAY, THEY ARE NOT DEAD. AS CONCERNING THE RESURRECTION, as concerning THE MIND OF GOD, IF GOD'S name is is is if if the I am is the perpetual NAME OF GOD, THEY ARE AS REAL AS we are real this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, you don't know the power of God. &gt;&gt; You don't know the scripture. You don't know the POWER OF GOD. DEATH DON'T KEEP THEM IN THE GRAVE. AS FAR AS TO GOD'S MIND, THEY ARE EVEN AS PRESENT as we are present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO HE NEVER APPEARED UNTO YOUR FATHERS AS I WAS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I WAS the God of No, no, no, no. He says, I am the God of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Because I AM NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD. I'M THE GOD OF THE LIVING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So another THING THERE IS THAT WITH THE I AM EVERYTHING LIVE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO DEAD WITH THE I AM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING LIVE WITH THE I AM. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I am the God of the living and not of the dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not the God of the dead, &gt;&gt; but the God of the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how much powerful &gt;&gt; this perpetual name is. That's how much powerful having a consciousness to know that when I say I am, I'm not talking about my abilities. &gt;&gt; When I say I am, I'm referring &gt;&gt; to the I am. &gt;&gt; Are we together this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I I want to labor. I want us to labor together to be able to grasp the concept. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an everlasting name to all generation. AND THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT has been able to grab the consciousness of this, they have enjoyed the benefit of it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They have enjoyed the benefit to know that uh the I am has attached his personality to them. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As touching the resurrection is not the God of the dead, but he's the God of the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; Yes. So with the I am everything live. &gt;&gt; Everything live. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And with the I am everything is in perfect health. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me not go ahead of myself. Let's let's continue the reading. We were supposed to go over to uh uh verse 34. the same reading. I'm not the God of the dead and the God of the living. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Verse 33, the Bible says, "And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine because that was a complete new teaching." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those that were dead were referred to that they was they were they were dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't refer to them as in the present tense. It's a new teaching. They were astonished as this. What is what is he saying? Praise the Lord. But it was not something that Jesus was introducing. It was something that God himself introduced when he met Moses. He said, "I am the GOD OF YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the God of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yeah, just another thing also I I want us to see in there. Do you realize that the that the Jewish people took that as a pattern of praying and they never understood what it was all about? When the Jew when the Jews pray, they pray the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, &gt;&gt; that how they pray, &gt;&gt; but they really never understood &gt;&gt; what what it was all about. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT ONLY REFERRING TO A GREAT MAN that lived and died. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT GOD WAS REFERRING TO A GREAT MAN THAT HE WORKED through and he still that same great one today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he says I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, WHICH MEAN I WAS THE ONE THAT CHANGED HIS BODY, I CAN CHANGE YOUR BODY TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE HOW WE can become religious and take self as common you know you we will YELL OURSELVES THE GOD OF WILLIAM BRANDON AS BEAUTIFUL as that was &gt;&gt; he's not a god of the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A GOD OF THE DEAD. HE'S STILL A LIVING God today. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see the principle here. The Bible says, "And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine." &gt;&gt; But when the Pharisees heard had heard that he had put the Sadducees to Salem, they gathered together. They says, "Well, we must attack this man." &gt;&gt; I love this chapter because when you read it from the beginning, it was the Herodians that came to tempt him. He dealt with them. Then the next group was the Sadducees that came. &gt;&gt; He put them to sleep. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now the Pharisees gathered themselves and said, "This guy, we got to deal with this guy." I love it. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THE SADDUCEES heard that he had put the Sadducees to silent, they gathered together. Then one of them which was a lawyer, this guy was a student." When they say lawyer means a student of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can tell you where Moses says the page &gt;&gt; 1963 August 5th. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; At 2 p.m. Brother Brandham said he was a student of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that one which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying master which is the greatest commandment in the Lord. Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind. This is the first and the great comming." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the second is likely unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor &gt;&gt; as thyself. On these two commandment hang all the laws and the prophet. So Jesus broke the ten commandments into two. &gt;&gt; And what he did was he TOOK THE FIRST FOUR commandment as the greatest commandment. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because the first four commandment pertain to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, oh Israel, the Lord your God is one God. Amen. AND YOU MUST HAVE NO OTHER GRAVEN IMAGE. YOU MUST WORSHIP NO OTHER GOD BESIDE THIS GOD. Praise the Lord. The third commandment is you must not take the name of your Lord God in vain. That's the third commandment. It pertains to God. And that's what I want to focus on this morning because that I am is God's name. &gt;&gt; And I want us to be conscious how we are using I am. &gt;&gt; When you say I am, you have to be conscious how you are using I am. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Did you grab my line of thought? Have I lost you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Let's stay together. &gt;&gt; And the fourth commandment is the rest. The Sabbath day is also pertaining to God. Now it's it's it's is it's beautiful when you look at it that Jesus here will split the ten commandments into two. He will take six, which good is the number of men. Just like I said Wednesday night, you don't need to be a Christian to love your father and mother. &gt;&gt; There are SOME THAT DO IT BETTER THAN PEOPLE IN CHURCH. &gt;&gt; You don't be you don't need to be a I mean A GOOD NEIGHBOR WILL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE HE BROKE IT INTO TWO THAT THERE IS ONE THAT IS OPERATED BY A NATURAL LORD &gt;&gt; AND THE OTHER ONE THE OTHER FOUR THE FIRST FOUR THAT HE CALLED THE GREAT COMMANDMENT IS OPERATED BY A SPIRITUAL LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IT'S A SPIRITUAL LORD THAT GOVERN THE MAN NOT TO WORSHIP IDOLS. WHY? BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE ANYTHING AN IDOL. &gt;&gt; THERE THERE HAS TO BE A SPIRITUAL LAW THAT IS GOVERNING YOU IN YOUR BODY FOR YOU NOT TO TAKE THE NAME of the Lord God in vain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THAT LORD I want to activate this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to activate that Lord &gt;&gt; so WE WILL NOT TAKE THE name of our Lord in vain. When you say I am. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will watch what you are associating I am with. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know the the Lord have a sense of human. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was listening to the song and brother Lawrence was singing uh uh Jesus lamb of God. Amen. I wrote it here so I won't forget forget. The song says, "You are my strength when I am weak." &gt;&gt; That's what the song says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he s you are my strength when I was weak. So when he sank it, I felt funny. I he can't see. I said I in my mind I says well the words are up there. exist when I am weak. Then right away I thought in my mind because it's on my note here. &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to I am. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to I am because I am is never weak. Let the weak say. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't associate weakness to our name. It is the perpetual name of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, okay, let's let's read uh Okay, I'm talking about these two commandments. Let me stay right in here. I went ahead of myself. But now so you see here is that he he breaks the ten commandments into two and he show us what is called the great commandment. What he called the great commandment is is is the portion of the commandment that is operated on the spiritual law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There there there are people that don't believe uh in uh uh in the God of Israel. They don't believe that there is one God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But yet when it comes to the rest of the sis commandment, they can be dedicated to it. They they love their parents. They they will not steal. They will not commit adultery. I mean those things are operated in the natural law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You find people that God has blessed. I mean maybe they they never had the grace to be able to see truth. They never had the grace to be I mean to to really be able to convince that there is a living God. So they don't go to church. But yet they keep those natural law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's govern. It's a natural law. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't need to be born again. You don't need to be baptized. Just simple. There was a man and a woman that brought you in this world and you owe him that respect. Simple. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is no We don't need to preach mystery about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need to convince you that there is a promise that is attached to it before you will obey your parents. &gt;&gt; It's a natural law. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when IT COMES TO THE FIRST FOUR, I want to dwell on the tier one. taking the name of the Lord God in vain. That's what I want to spend my strength this morning. But before that, let's look at the fourth one, keeping the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which of course are religious people have argued about it whether it is Saturday, whether it is Sunday and and I mean whether we can do this or we cannot do that. But you have to know h or realize this morning church is that because of disobedience the breaking of that commandment to the Jewish people that's what make them to spend the years they spent in Babylon &gt;&gt; GOD SAID BECAUSE YOU HAVE REFUSED TO allow the land to rest &gt;&gt; I will take you away into captivity and I will give the land rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God demand rest. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he want you to honor it. &gt;&gt; He want you to honor it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I mean they they started prospering and and and they got so busy they need to they I mean they need to get their product out you know they have they have now h make a trade agreement with this nation and that nation and all of that. So they were just they were just sewing the land and plotting the land and plotting the land and plotting the land and plotting the land. And sometimes that is the very same thing we do to our body. &gt;&gt; That's right. Sometimes that's the very same thing we do to our body. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's the very same thing we do to our body. I need to &gt;&gt; I need to preach this to myself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh so as as you look in the scripture, you will realize that uh uh Paul took that subject when he understood that the rest was not just h a physical rest. He he took that in the book of Hebrew and he explained to us what the rest was. He took it right back to Genesis that after God has labored sixth day, he rested the seventh day. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so so we we we we get to the place to to see and understand in one sense the rest was not just uh you know uh uh uh uh natural lying down to rest it for God it was a change of dispensation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a change of dispensation because now God has made a man in his image. He got a man that could do the work. So what he did? He rested. Amen. &gt;&gt; He rested by transferring authority to that man. That's what make Adam the God of the earth. Amen. He transfer every authority to that man and he rested. He was no longer That's why Adam had to name the creatures. He had to name the plan. God was not doing any work again. So in another sense, God was resting in his son. &gt;&gt; That's why comes the concept of the Holy Ghost being our rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's THAT'S WHAT BRING THE CONCEPT THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS our rest. AND THEN PAUL WILL say in the Hebrew, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; that uh uh uh uh he says in the Hebrew, he he type it in a way that uh until you rest, until you come to rest, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The remaining rest. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. They enter into the rest. Okay. there remain in the rest for the people of God. That's what he said. And uh uh but he brought it in a way that uh uh uh is it's in two ways. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God comes to rest, he has found a son or a daughter. that he has trusted for that job. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And on the other hand is that God cannot really get to work &gt;&gt; until you come to rest. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a competition here. Both of you not going to be working at the same time. &gt;&gt; You got You got the concept. There's not going to be a competition between God. I want to do it. No. Let me do it. Let me do it. No. No. It's either one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO GET THAT'S WHY PAUL WHO SAYS HE'S THE HIGH PRIEST OF OUR CONFESSIONS. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO GET HIM TO WORK, you must come to rest on the matter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. FOR HIM TO GET YOU TO REST &gt;&gt; OR GET YOU TO work &gt;&gt; in your calling. He also come to rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you grappling the the concept? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean it's it's not striving. Let me do it. No. God said let me do it. No. He said let me do it. No. No. &gt;&gt; He his spirit will not strive with men. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not striving with men. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU EITHER ALLOW GOD TO DO IT OR YOU DO IT YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL EITHER DO IT OR he will get a man to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO THEN WE UNDERSTAND WHY THE SABBATH DAY IS UH h the the the fourth commandment. Why? Why it is why IT IS DIVINE? WHY it is operated supernaturally or spiritually? Why is it not under a natural law like the rest of the six? BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF CALLED THAT DAY MY DAY. He said it is my day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is my day. Do you know that it is out of the Sabbath that comes the tithes? Whatever we whatever we give to God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Out of the Sabbath comes it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now you will understand here when we go further here. He says here the first commandment. WHAT DID HE SAYS? LOVE the Lord God with all of your heart AND ALL OF YOUR SOUL and all of your mind. You will see that if you go back, Moses said this uh uh uh let me let me just uh I never thought about it until now. It just it just came to my mind. So let me take this also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you if you look in in in the Gospel of Mark, you will see where Jesus referring to this very same thing. Mark uh 12:30, he says, "And thou shall love the Lord with all of your heart, all of your soul, all of your mind, and all of your strength." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's the word I wanted to put there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. In all of your strength. Uh uh Mark chapter 30. Now, so you will see that uh the reason why the reason why uh uh uh he demanded the rest of the land, he demanded a Sabbath because he's the God of our strength. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we must we must acknowledge there that he gave us strength for us to wake up in the morning. He gave us strength for us to do whatever that we are doing. &gt;&gt; We must be conscious of that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the one that gave us strength says we must rest, then let's honor it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's honor it. And it's not just only uh you know uh uh having a good night rest. That's good. If is is important. Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking the day off to sleep, that is good. Is is important also. Praise the Lord. But we must realize that true rest is in the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; True rest is in the Lord. It's is uh is is connecting with your maker. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's returning back to him and bringing thanks and and and bringing praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As much as it looks like, you know, we we we rush here to service, we sing and dance, uh I mean, in another sense, we are bringing a sense of true rest to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everything we do here, we want to rest upon him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We want to depend upon him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You know, that's the reason why brother Brandon says something like uh uh you know, if a person will forsake church and go fishing on Sunday, he says uh that that looks like dishonoring the Sabbath. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now try just we're trying to bring ourself to a sense of consciousness. &gt;&gt; We're living in a changing word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're living in a changing world. We're living in a word that is getting that is getting busy. We cannot hold this word like like like it was held before. Everything is falling apart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh uh uh uh sometimes we we we we have to take care of our family. We have to take care of ourselves and you know take care of our home and every other thing. But then also we must be conscious that he told us to love him with all of our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Loving him with all of our strength. So if if it turn out to the place that I I can't be in church on Sunday morning uh because I have to be to work and and and that's what my work required of me and I'm going to go to work. &gt;&gt; But I'm also going to be conscious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm also going to be conscious. &gt;&gt; I must find a way to be able to honor the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I must find a way to be able to honor the Sabbath than to just cast it away and says, "Well, you know, I supposed to be to work today. You know, it's just work." No, I must find a way because we have to realize that the the the Sabbath, he says uh uh uh the Sabbath uh uh was not uh made for men. Man was made for the Sabbath. That what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the Lord of the Sabbath. come unto me all you that labor &gt;&gt; and have heavy laden. So you see there is there is more consciousness than just honoring a day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or just honoring uh h certain rituals that we must not drink water on a Sabbath, we must not eat meat on a Sabbath. You know instead of just organizing it, there is a concept &gt;&gt; that he's trying to bring to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's not the God of the dead, &gt;&gt; he's the God of the living. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, knowing that it is his day, WE WE WE TRY TO HONOR IT. For a MATTER OF FACT, EVERY DAY IS HIS DAY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO, EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE, WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO HONOR GOD IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO BE CONSCIOUS TO BRING OUR PRAISE, OUR GRATITUDE, OUR thanksgiving to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether I can do IT IN THE MORNING OR I CAN DO IT IN THE AFTERNOON OR I CAN DO IT AT LUNCH, WHATEVER TIME. BUT I TRY TO FIND A TIME IN MY EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We cannot cast honor in the Lord. There are things that life demand. &gt;&gt; We have to attain onto it. &gt;&gt; But then we must also have the consciousness. Now I need to honor the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love him with all of my strength. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Love him with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. love him WITH ALL OF MY mind &gt;&gt; and my then my thoughts will go my question will go to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we love God with all of our heart? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How do we love him with all of our mind? What what is that all about? How do we love God with all of our strength? What is it all about? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it all about? And then we will soon realize here that uh uh uh when the scripture speaks in this sense because no one goes to the theater at the hospital and go and do a surgery to be able to reach down in their heart to even find your soul &gt;&gt; or to even be able to take out that element of the love of God that is in your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Science cannot find it. Medical doctors cannot search it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They cannot go in your brain and and look for your mind. &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in your brain called your mind. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's another word is what the Apostle Paul would call your spirit man. It's another word. It's another being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit being. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the real you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is just your vehicle. This is not you. This is your vehicle. The rear you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is WITH THAT REAR YOU THAT YOU LOVE the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART AND ALL OF YOUR MIND AND ALL OF YOUR STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT REAR YOU THAT PICKS UP THIS BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT TAKES THIS BODY FOR A SHOWER. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes they don't even want to brush his teeth. You got to tell him to brush his teeth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So you we realizing that uh uh uh uh there is something uh uh uh uh more about you. &gt;&gt; There is something more about our self. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So that first and great commment is operated by a spiritual lord. The second one is operated by a natural lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we want to dwell on the terror one taking the name of the Lord thy God in vain. &gt;&gt; That's why we we try to wrap this thing up this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have I given you faith? Did you see that you have got some sense of faith? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. just just having uh having that consciousness, you know, of of who we are, who really we are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what we supposed to do in every given time. So just like I said here, if we if we use the I am whenever we connect the I am whatever we connect the I am to we become because it's powerful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you say I'm sick, &gt;&gt; you are sick. You are really sick. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you say that, you know, I'm poor, then you are really poor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But that's that's not really the sense of what I'm where I'm going to this morning. where I'm going to is that uh uh you know somewhere where Abraham talks about speaking the devil's language. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's more in a sense that those are things that we must not say. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we use the I am wrongly we are using the Lord's name in vain. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because because it is his perpetual name. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So whatever you attach the I am told you are giving life to that thing. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want us to see it in that way. That's the reason why the scripture will will will speak to us in this way. Let the weak says I'm strong. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not a place of deny. &gt;&gt; I can say I'm feeling weak but I'm strong by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me let me bring another one that is very common for us. &gt;&gt; Let me bring another one that is very common for us. Uh uh Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2. You know sometime these things just become good sermon and then we go away &gt;&gt; and never put it into practice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I hope that the Lord will help us. Amen. You read Ephesians chapter 2, Ephesians 2:5, the Bible which says uh uh verse 4, but God who was rich in mercy for his great love were when he loved us even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by grace. Yay, I saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that it is from this scripture that that common saying we are sinners saved by grace? &gt;&gt; That's where the scripture that's where that phrase came from &gt;&gt; from this scripture. We are sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; How are we associating saved by grace &gt;&gt; with sinner? &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner saved by grace then you are no longer a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. How are we associating the two? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But you see that's the way the human mind, our human mind try to accommodate God's word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because it makes us to feel right &gt;&gt; that I know I'm a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if IT'S A WORK THAT IS ALREADY DONE, &gt;&gt; if the save BY GRACE IS A WORK THAT IS ALREADY DONE IN YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; THEN YOU ARE NO LONGER a sinner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like you saying, I'M I'M A SICK PERSON that is already healed by his strife. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS STRIPES YOU ARE HEALED. &gt;&gt; Then you are no longer sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are are you seeing what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's it's a it's a realm of faith. It's a it's it's a it's a it's a it's a channel that God trying to bring us through because Peter said whereby he has given unto us his divine nature. &gt;&gt; How can we have God's divine nature and we have such a poor confession. &gt;&gt; Tell it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN WE BE POSSESSOR OF HIS divine nature? Now you will see that the the the the church word and uh and and and and and the care master word has run with this without wisdom. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have run with it without wisdom in a sense that people are professing wealth. People are professing you know whatever they are professing they don't have nothing on God's word to base their profession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. BUT WE HAVE HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE CAN GO BACK TO ISAIAH 53. WE CAN GO BACK TO THE PROMISES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; We have something that we can rest our FAITH ON. &gt;&gt; THEN WHY SHOULD WE BE AFRAID TO EXPRESS IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE NOT DEPENDING ON OURSEL BUT WE ARE DEPENDING ON what God has promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are giving you are giving life or you are giving birth &gt;&gt; to whatever negative things &gt;&gt; you attach to our image. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see an I am is God speaks until you add another word to it. &gt;&gt; And whatever you are to it, you are speaking the father's language or you are speaking the devil's language. &gt;&gt; Praise praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I could say, well, my head is hurting, but I am healed. That's good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's what that's what I am. My head is hurting me. &gt;&gt; But when it COMES TO I AM, I am don't have headache. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; Or am I just in my own word? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My body is weak, &gt;&gt; but I am strong. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because that's what I am is. I am is strong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am is not weak. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just it just it just some of these things uh you know uh as as as as as Christians we we don't we don't realize. See what Paul says here in in in Philippian he says he being God speaking about Jesus &gt;&gt; taught in not robbering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus could be robbing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. if he just choose to be called the father of Joseph and Mary. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE TOLD HIM I must be about my father's business, &gt;&gt; he was not robbing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So take that principle and apply it to what we are saying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How we can rob God when we associate the I am &gt;&gt; to our failures. &gt;&gt; I'm just a failure. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just nothing. No, I am may all think. &gt;&gt; I am was the one that make all things. I am is not nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU TAKE THAT PRINCIPLE of robbing God, robbing God is in is is is the SENSE OF NOT ALLOWING GOD TO BE ABLE TO REVEAL himself through you and in you as he's supposed to. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find another way to say this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to find another way to say it to to to make sure that that it lands because what I I was I was thinking about this and and then uh uh when I when I when I fell on this thought that uh this is the perpetual name of God to all generation. &gt;&gt; It just blew my mind. I've I've just I've meditated on this uh night and night. The perpetual name of God to all generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Almighty God, the great internal one attach himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; brother will tell us about keys. Keys to life. This is a key. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is a key. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a key to be able to to to be able to to to help us alone because a a It have you to go with the consciousness &gt;&gt; of the God youself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not breaking in your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you you you are you are having this consciousness that he SAID I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU. &gt;&gt; I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. &gt;&gt; I WILL GO WITH you even to the end. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND IF HE'S WITH YOU THEN I AM IS NOT THE GOD OF THE DEAD. I AM IS THE GOD OF THE LIVING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's a key. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something and I close here. I was I was I'm I'm standing on the subject of of backsliding. I fell on a beautiful material that I that I've been I've been reading listening to and is on the subject of backsliding. &gt;&gt; And as I look into the material and look at the subject, I start to see it very different. I start to see it very, very different. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, just last night, I was meditating on this thought as I lay back there and just reading on my phone. Bird says, uh, you know, he is talking about backsliding. We backslide every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said we backslide every day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then he says, carrying on that thought, he says we don't backslide before God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We backslide before one another. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Then carrying on the thought he went on and says and that's the reason why the apostle Paul says I have to die daily. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Now if you think about backsliding in that way you realize that it's good. &gt;&gt; It's good. &gt;&gt; It's not good BECAUSE I HAVE PLEASURE in backsliding. is good because it gave me the consciousness to to to to to take an inventory of my life. It gave me a consciousness that if I'm GOOD IN THIS AREA, this area I might not be good in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It does not make me a a one lane believer. IT MAKES ME A BALANCED BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; YES. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BACKSLIDING. The thought OF IT TAKE ALL UH UH UH uh you know uh uh a religious spirit. It takes every religious spirit from you. BASHID PUTS YOU TO THE place where the rubber meets the road. &gt;&gt; You are real with yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are real with others. You're not putting on anything for nobody. &gt;&gt; That's right. If it meet the rubber meets the road because you become CONSCIOUS THAT I HAVE TO DIE DAILY. If Christ will live in me then there is SOMETHING IN MY LIFE I NEED TO FIND OUT TO give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need to GIVE SOMETHING UP. I NEED TO SURRENDER SOMETHING. I NEED HIS GRACE every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that's not what we're preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE UH WE NEED THAT CONSCIOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; WE MUST NOT JUST BE GOING WITH THIS FLAG OVER OUR HEAD. I'm a message believer. I baptized in Jesus name. You know, I I I believe the prophet OF THE HOUR. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; That is not enough. What are we doing with it? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THIS GRACE THAT HAS COME TO US? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we look for an opportunity to share this glorious grace &gt;&gt; that has come to us? &gt;&gt; Or we just wear it like an identification &gt;&gt; and everybody should leave the role because I'm a message believer. I'm the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I have the ego anointing on me. &gt;&gt; So just clear the way. Can you see me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we announce oursel by our sweats. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But think about it this morning. The perpetual name of Jehovah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. was given to you right from birth. He attached his name to you that through you Mary can see his greatness can see his mercy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And whenever he says I am, &gt;&gt; we don't use it like the word use it. We become very conscious that whatever I associate I am with and giving life to that thing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We become conscious of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That is by no means for us to live in deny. &gt;&gt; We can feel our pains. We can see our struggle. But if God is not the God of the dead and he's the God of the living, then let us also believe and realize that he knows our pain and he knows our struggle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And by confessing his name is is an avenue of breaking him under sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come while we close up here with our continuous reading here in in all gospel of Ephesians. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 2:5 even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and have raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace. in in his kindness towards to us uh towards us through Christ Jesus. For by grace I saved through faith and that's not of yourself. It is the gift of God, not of work, least any man should boss. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, so you see, I think that's the thing that tricks our mind because Paul says, "So, so so, so no man can boast." So, we think that we are humble if we say, "I'm a sinner saved by grace." That's not what he said. That's not what he said. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what the Apostle Paul said. He don't want for us to boast in ourself. &gt;&gt; We don't have nothing of oursel to brag in but to trust in his grace. We want to play that song. I also sing by grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now I lay and breathe in freedom. with each breath of life by walk and for that. I was a sing by. Oh Jesus, save by grace. When I saw my place, now I live and bring the freedom for each breath of love and for I was a sinner by &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads down. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we have this uh little thought on our mind. Oh God, how to just be able to bring to your children, Father, Lord. Oh God, father bringing us Lord God to the consciousness Lord. Oh father God of uh just uh um being conscious Lord of what your grace is doing in our life of God. Father Lord and oh God father how we can trust in your grace. How we can learn to say the right thing Lord God. Oh father we bless your name. We thank you Lord. We appreciate you oh God this morning.
