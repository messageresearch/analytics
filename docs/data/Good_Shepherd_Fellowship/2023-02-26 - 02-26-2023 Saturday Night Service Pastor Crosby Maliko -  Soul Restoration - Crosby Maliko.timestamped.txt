[1:05:47] scriptures to tell us that the letter
[1:05:49] kill it but the spirit giveth life
[1:05:52] unless you come and breathe your Holy
[1:05:54] Spirit upon these words
[1:05:56] Lord they will not bring the desired
[1:05:59] results
[1:06:00] we do not want to be like those folks
[1:06:02] who did not mix the word with faith but
[1:06:05] we want to be able to have all the
[1:06:06] ingredients required for a body change
[1:06:09] in this Den in this hour father help us
[1:06:11] and undertake for us and above all
[1:06:14] almighty God would like to appreciate
[1:06:16] the pastor for availing his pulpit and
[1:06:19] also for the invitation father it's such
[1:06:23] a solidarity in the body of Christ that
[1:06:25] people can be friends from various walks
[1:06:28] of life and still have the common
[1:06:31] message of the hour as their commonality
[1:06:34] and Common Ground father we truly love
[1:06:36] you we appreciate you for all the those
[1:06:39] that are in divine presence and even
[1:06:41] those that are online who are part of
[1:06:44] this fellowship and also want to be a
[1:06:47] part of what we are sharing around the
[1:06:49] world
[1:06:49] may they receive their portion we truly
[1:06:52] love you we thank you we appreciate you
[1:06:54] and also almighty God I would like to
[1:06:57] also throw in
[1:06:59] my fire of prayer upon the sister I've
[1:07:01] had with the cancer situation may you
[1:07:04] undertake almighty God there is
[1:07:06] something we can never overdo that is to
[1:07:09] over pray oh God we ask the Lord may
[1:07:13] this time transform the situations
[1:07:16] around
[1:07:17] oh God the ailments and everything
[1:07:19] that's surrounding us because you are
[1:07:23] a master strategist you always know how
[1:07:25] to do your things
[1:07:27] and therefore Lord we do not
[1:07:28] underestimate the power of a service the
[1:07:31] power of prayer the power of your
[1:07:33] presence in our midst we still pray that
[1:07:36] you might be comfortable to those
[1:07:37] families as well in the name of the Lord
[1:07:40] Jesus Christ I pray amen and amen praise
[1:07:43] the Lord amen
[1:07:45] I greet you once again in the name of
[1:07:47] the Lord Jesus Christ and I truly
[1:07:50] appreciate once again
[1:07:52] the opportunity to preach
[1:07:55] and the opportunity to be in your
[1:07:58] presence
[1:07:59] praise the Lord amen I believe it was
[1:08:05] in the Book of Luke in the book of Acts
[1:08:07] that Luke speaks and says let's
[1:08:09] Fellowship around the things that we
[1:08:11] commonly believe
[1:08:13] amen praise the Lord
[1:08:15] we believe that we are in the end times
[1:08:18] even unbelievers believe that
[1:08:21] so it's
[1:08:23] I think that God has given us to share
[1:08:26] that one of these days the last prayer
[1:08:29] is going to be prayed the last song is
[1:08:32] Going to Be Sung
[1:08:33] it's going to be ongoing time
[1:08:35] yes praise the Lord so while we remain
[1:08:37] standing I'll ask you to tend to your
[1:08:39] Bibles
[1:08:40] to the Book of Psalms chapter 23
[1:08:43] amen praise the Lord
[1:08:48] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:08:52] I shall not want.

[1:09:49] the house of the Lord
[1:09:51] praise the Lord let me ask one more time
[1:09:54] I do not know what sport is in this
[1:09:57] vicinity uh
[1:09:59] if we were in Los Angeles I would have
[1:10:01] probably predicted that basketball is
[1:10:03] their thing
[1:10:04] we're in New York maybe basketball as
[1:10:07] well I do not know these parts I
[1:10:10] probably think ice hockey or something
[1:10:12] like that
[1:10:13] and I don't suppose when you go to
[1:10:15] Wizard is that right
[1:10:17] ice hockey what they call that uh
[1:10:22] ice hockey all right praise the Lord I
[1:10:25] don't suppose if you go to an ice hockey
[1:10:27] game you are muted and
[1:10:30] composed
[1:10:31] you are excited before the game even
[1:10:33] starts praise the Lord I come from a
[1:10:36] place where they love football and rugby
[1:10:39] so they start to get noisy and Rowdy

[1:10:54] happen you see the crowd cheering yeah

[1:11:06] uh
[1:11:08] just the idea that something is fixing

[1:11:14] the Lord amen most of when fish we've
[1:11:17] had a song called Praise the Lord the
[1:11:21] The Shepherd of our souls

[1:11:26] exactly the song So it gives me to
[1:11:28] understand I'm in the spirit praise the
[1:11:31] Lord so that gets me excited praise the
[1:11:34] Lord and uh excuse me if I'm a little

[1:11:46] little bit on the quiet temperament I'm
[1:11:48] not like that so I like a bit of noise

[1:14:09] Amplified says he restores my life and
[1:14:14] in Brackets my self
[1:14:16] it means there is something that needs
[1:14:19] to be delved into and made particular
[1:14:23] attention to based on that my title
[1:14:26] tonight is soul restoration
[1:14:30] praise the Lord that's why brothers and

[1:14:43] understand the depth of dealing with
[1:14:46] your soul because in your soul is where
[1:14:49] there is the power of transformation
[1:14:51] whatever it is that you are supposed to
[1:14:54] accomplish you are not your body you are
[1:14:58] your soul amen allow me to throw in this
[1:15:01] quotation just before I get into uh my
[1:15:05] little lesson and then I'm building it
[1:15:07] for a foundation for what I'll say
[1:15:09] tomorrow
[1:15:10] praise the Lord if you understand who
[1:15:13] you are in your soul there is not very
[1:15:16] many things that are beyond your reach
[1:15:18] there is not very many things the devil
[1:15:21] can do with you there is not very many
[1:15:23] things you can't accomplish as long as
[1:15:26] you are in the will of God that is why
[1:15:28] the beginning of Salvation is the new
[1:15:30] birth praise the Lord not in your spirit
[1:15:33] but in your soul the reason it's got to
[1:15:36] be in the soul realm is that in there
[1:15:38] praise the Lord is where God dwells
[1:15:41] somebody say Amen to that so David in
[1:15:45] the psalm gives God the absolute he says
[1:15:48] Lord you are my absolute leader you are
[1:15:51] my shepherd because you are my shepherd
[1:15:53] I shall not want because you are my
[1:15:56] shepherd there is nothing that I would
[1:15:59] rather be than your sheep he understood
[1:16:02] sheep and Shepherd relationship him
[1:16:04] being a Shepherd himself knew that the
[1:16:07] best carer to ever care for anybody or
[1:16:10] anything has got to be a Shepherd now if
[1:16:13] you give and surrender your life to God
[1:16:16] to be not The Shepherd of your body but
[1:16:19] the shepherd of your soul praise the
[1:16:22] lord it's imperative and it's needed
[1:16:24] that at that point God has got to
[1:16:26] restore your soul to such levels that
[1:16:29] the real you will be able to do what
[1:16:32] you're supposed to do while you are here
[1:16:33] on Earth somebody say Amen to that we
[1:16:37] are not here on Earth to just be praise
[1:16:40] the Lord people that place second field
[1:16:42] or just items and objects at the messian
[1:16:46] pity of the devil where if he looks at
[1:16:49] your face and he thinks that well
[1:16:50] there's no need to tempt this one he'll
[1:16:52] let you go by we are here because God
[1:16:54] has a purpose we are here because God
[1:16:57] saw from the foundation of the world
[1:16:59] that there is a special breed of people
[1:17:02] that ought to be on earth at such a time
[1:17:05] after the seals have been opened in 200
[1:17:07] million Devils have been released yet
[1:17:09] these people have the power to
[1:17:11] counteract every demon in Hell they've
[1:17:14] got the overcoming power whatever the
[1:17:16] devil says he can throw to us we've got
[1:17:18] the power over him why because greater
[1:17:21] is he that is in us than he that is in
[1:17:23] the world the in the one that's in us
[1:17:26] where is he in is in the soul somebody
[1:17:29] say Amen to that and that is why there
[1:17:32] is any an
[1:17:34] urgent appeal for people to explore and
[1:17:36] understand what their soul is capable of
[1:17:39] achieving praise the Lord in the message
[1:17:41] things
[1:17:42] I'm in paragraph 26 says if we know the
[1:17:46] word of God we know where we are living
[1:17:49] just that statement alone makes me happy
[1:17:52] by knowing the word of God you know
[1:17:55] where you are living we know the hour we
[1:17:58] are living in we know what lays ahead we
[1:18:03] see what we have passed and the Book of
[1:18:07] God is the revelation of Jesus Christ he
[1:18:12] works through the edges that was up to
[1:18:15] the Book of Revelation and then his
[1:18:18] promises that is to come so all of his
[1:18:23] promises are true
[1:18:26] God cannot speak any word without it
[1:18:30] being confirmed
[1:18:32] in other words equality tests his own
[1:18:35] word
[1:18:36] he would never allow a scripture to be
[1:18:39] put in the scriptures or to be made in
[1:18:42] scripture to be put in the Bible unless
[1:18:44] he is Thoroughly Vindicated in himself
[1:18:47] he has a program that is perfect and
[1:18:52] entire he would never ask you for
[1:18:55] something uh to believe in something
[1:18:58] that he doesn't know that your faith is
[1:18:59] capable of reaching it amen so before
[1:19:03] there could ever be any Scripture be put
[1:19:05] in the Bible God had to
[1:19:09] troubleshoot it see its ins and outs
[1:19:11] we'll see if it's capable of still
[1:19:14] possessing the power of transformation
[1:19:16] in the end times see whether that
[1:19:19] scripture will be able to counteract
[1:19:22] every spirit that is in this day and in
[1:19:26] this hour so there is nothing Beyond
[1:19:28] God's power in this day and in this age
[1:19:31] praise the Lord and every scripture in
[1:19:34] the Bible praise the Lord if you know
[1:19:37] the word of your day you will know what
[1:19:39] God expects of you and when you know
[1:19:41] what God expects of you you will know
[1:19:43] what you are capable of
[1:19:45] praise the Lord praise the Lord I
[1:19:48] believe there are people that are in the
[1:19:49] army or have been soldiers before they
[1:19:52] know to trust in the ammunition of what
[1:19:54] they have
[1:19:55] right praise the Lord which gives me to
[1:19:57] understand that Believers should come to
[1:19:59] that level
[1:20:00] of having a thorough appreciation of the
[1:20:03] power that lays in the scriptures having
[1:20:06] an appreciation of the power that lays
[1:20:09] in the message of the hour once you have
[1:20:12] a full appreciation of what is at your
[1:20:14] disposal the devil is nothing but a
[1:20:17] bluff praise the Lord whatever he throws
[1:20:20] your way the first and foremost thing
[1:20:23] that comes to your mind is if you've
[1:20:25] come my way God's already measured and
[1:20:28] God has already known that he's already
[1:20:30] possessed in me a power that can
[1:20:32] counteract this power because he can't
[1:20:35] come and put in the Bible a scripture
[1:20:37] that says greater is he that is in you
[1:20:40] and then the devil whipped you at every
[1:20:42] turn it must mean that indeed greater is
[1:20:46] he that is in you praise the Lord that
[1:20:49] is why when David caught the revelation
[1:20:51] of who he was he wasn't a man writing
[1:20:55] that Psalm out of a situation of defeat
[1:20:57] or out of a situation it was inspiration
[1:21:00] that struck him and he said the Lord
[1:21:01] indeed is my shepherd
[1:21:04] to lead to guide to protect and to feed
[1:21:07] praise the Lord and then he goes on
[1:21:09] further and he says he will restore my
[1:21:12] soul amen amen
[1:21:14] amen why has there got to be a need for
[1:21:17] a restoration of the Soul because if you
[1:21:19] if you want the best out of a man you've
[1:21:22] got to delve into the soul realm amen
[1:21:25] you are not your body praise the Lord
[1:21:28] you are far deeper than what your body
[1:21:31] is amen hear what the prophet says in
[1:21:34] the message Messiah praise the Lord he
[1:21:37] says messiahship
[1:21:39] so has the eagle has got it we know what
[1:21:43] now you say is the man
[1:21:46] before I leave the subject
[1:21:49] the man what is he
[1:21:52] he's got a hand like God good eyes like
[1:21:55] God God eyes ears like God got a body
[1:21:59] like God he was fashioned after God he
[1:22:01] was given an if in the Dominion he was
[1:22:04] made God over the Earth to rule the
[1:22:08] Earth a Lesser God God rules the
[1:22:11] universe
[1:22:12] everything but man given the Earth to
[1:22:17] rule the Earth he was a messiah
[1:22:22] that's what he is tonight if he gets
[1:22:25] back to God
[1:22:27] if you get back to God you are a messiah
[1:22:31] he is a messiah a little Messiah
[1:22:36] if Messiah means anointed one and you
[1:22:39] are anointed then where are you that's
[1:22:43] exactly right a messiah we call it that
[1:22:47] just for the world's sake for the word
[1:22:50] sake till we get a little further down
[1:22:52] the scripture to eat all right did you
[1:22:56] ever think of this let me ask you
[1:22:58] something
[1:22:59] look at me for a minute this is my hand
[1:23:05] is that right
[1:23:06] that's right this is my finger this is
[1:23:09] my ear this is my nose but who's me
[1:23:14] that's not
[1:23:16] that's not me that something belongs to
[1:23:19] me see this is my end
[1:23:24] but who's got who's is me that owns the
[1:23:28] hand
[1:23:29] see this is just a house I'm living in
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] amen what kind of well there is
[1:23:37] something to be something to be called
[1:23:40] me
[1:23:42] amen amen amen me it's got to be
[1:23:45] somewhere because he this is mine
[1:23:49] you see it me is somebody because I own
[1:23:55] something
[1:23:57] I have a hand it's mine well who's me
[1:24:01] that that belongs to that's right
[1:24:04] that's right that's your spirit well it
[1:24:06] depends on what kind of a spirit that is
[1:24:10] who you yield your members too
[1:24:13] that's whose servant you are now if you
[1:24:19] can crack a glass of water because you
[1:24:21] have telepathy or mental conception and
[1:24:24] a certain power that you can put off to
[1:24:26] a human being a power of mental Force
[1:24:29] that's unseen and are known of only
[1:24:31] through the cycle if you can bust a
[1:24:34] glass of water
[1:24:36] but the kind of a spirit a human
[1:24:38] perverted damned spirit because you are
[1:24:41] fashioned in the image of God what you
[1:24:44] can do
[1:24:45] do when you let God that Fashions you
[1:24:48] coming to you and control you see now
[1:24:51] you can bring every promise of God to
[1:24:55] pass
[1:24:56] let me just pause there for a minute
[1:24:58] brother Prime is making a comment I
[1:25:01] after having seen a telecom
[1:25:07] of concentration you looked at the glass
[1:25:11] and he broke it not having been near the
[1:25:14] glass just using the faculties of his
[1:25:17] bodies now program looks at that and he
[1:25:19] says if a man with a perverted Spirit
[1:25:22] can look at that and break it how much
[1:25:26] more a man with the spirit of God how
[1:25:29] much more are you able
[1:25:31] to make the promises
[1:25:34] so your power is not to break glasses
[1:25:38] but to bring Jesus on the scene and make
[1:25:41] a few promises in your life come to pass
[1:25:45] in other words if a man can concentrate
[1:25:49] on a glass and break it you can
[1:25:51] concentrate on your healing by taking
[1:25:53] every other scripture that has to do
[1:25:56] with your healing and if you concentrate
[1:25:58] on that enough you will get your healing
[1:26:02] are you getting it
[1:26:04] says you can bring every promise of God
[1:26:08] to pass yes sir every promise of God God
[1:26:12] promise will come to pass all right
[1:26:15] God's gift is in his word
[1:26:18] God's promise made a gift sent a gift
[1:26:22] you take the gift and then with this
[1:26:24] word
[1:26:25] there's your conductor
[1:26:28] with a gift praise the Lord allow me to
[1:26:31] step out from my Prophet so that I don't
[1:26:33] use my glasses because I really have to
[1:26:35] uh uh nail this the way I feel in my
[1:26:38] spirit praise the Lord Amen brother
[1:26:40] Brahm is going into this situation
[1:26:42] because he really sees how other people
[1:26:45] who are not Living Christian Are
[1:26:48] exploiting Spiritual things and getting
[1:26:50] results yet the believer he's got the
[1:26:53] scriptures with which if they are
[1:26:55] conducted with the word of God and their
[1:26:58] Spirit they can make that scripture
[1:27:00] praise the Lord step out of the Bible
[1:27:02] and come into their lives praise the
[1:27:05] Lord so he gives this example he says we
[1:27:07] are Messiah because of the spirit of God
[1:27:10] that's within us so if there goes on
[1:27:12] says now there's your conductor with a
[1:27:15] gift of God if God give you the gift of
[1:27:18] the Holy Ghost you believe that well the
[1:27:21] word of God is a conductor
[1:27:24] to use that power with which means as
[1:27:28] long as the word lies dominant in the
[1:27:30] Bible and there is no candidate with the
[1:27:33] Holy Ghost to pull out the scripture of
[1:27:36] what they require that thing won't come
[1:27:38] to pass so yours is to receive the Holy
[1:27:41] Ghost and when you receive the Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost you unlock you are you align
[1:27:45] yourself with a particular scripture
[1:27:47] with a promise you want to achieve and
[1:27:49] let me tell you 100 you will achieve
[1:27:53] exactly what the scripture says you are
[1:27:55] able to achieve somebody say Amen to
[1:27:58] that
[1:28:00] praise the Lord
[1:28:02] listen to this
[1:28:05] the word of God is a conductor to use
[1:28:07] that power with right praise the Lord
[1:28:10] whatever the Holy Ghost promised you
[1:28:13] that's what you can do
[1:28:15] are you with me
[1:28:16] next sister
[1:28:18] see
[1:28:19] that's the thing that delivers the word
[1:28:22] the word goes right out and the Holy
[1:28:26] Spirit follows the word well whatever
[1:28:29] the words preached see you see your
[1:28:33] pastor preach it the first thing you
[1:28:36] know
[1:28:37] blah blah makes a blowing sound across
[1:28:40] the building
[1:28:41] goes the Holy Spirit that's light it's
[1:28:44] the conductor of the word let me put it
[1:28:47] let me break it down in plain language
[1:28:49] your pastor comes on a Sunday with a
[1:28:51] humble service and simply says today we
[1:28:54] just want to deal with the power we have
[1:28:56] and there is a believer in there that
[1:28:59] says you know what actually I believe
[1:29:01] that scripture then the power that the
[1:29:04] Prosper is speaking about if it finds
[1:29:06] somebody that says amen over there the
[1:29:08] Holy Ghost says oh okay we are on duty
[1:29:10] now let's go and locate the person and
[1:29:13] then he starts to move then he moves
[1:29:14] from this person no no one is interested
[1:29:16] in this scripture goes on to the next
[1:29:18] and then he finds the actual conductor
[1:29:20] because in them is an identification of
[1:29:24] that scripture and if you can identify
[1:29:26] with your that scripture then the next
[1:29:28] thing that thing comes to pass amen
[1:29:31] praise the Lord that is why you find in
[1:29:34] the message no matter how powerful we
[1:29:37] preach the scripture of sister had to
[1:29:39] write will never apply to a single
[1:29:41] sister because there is nothing in there
[1:29:43] to conduct that but there's got to be a
[1:29:46] widow with a blessed and son and that
[1:29:48] better than mother that big children son
[1:29:50] is giving that Widow a challenge and
[1:29:53] then the pastor comes as remember Sister
[1:29:55] Hetty light that it becomes a word then
[1:29:58] that sister praise the Lord says Pastor
[1:30:01] I was listening to a type with sister
[1:30:03] healthy life I believe that then the
[1:30:06] Holy Ghost says right there is a charge
[1:30:07] over there let's go and fulfill that
[1:30:10] part of the scripture somebody say Amen
[1:30:12] to that
[1:30:19] it's the conductor of the word the word
[1:30:22] goes the word is the conductor of the
[1:30:24] spirit because where the word is
[1:30:27] preached
[1:30:28] the spirit follows it
[1:30:30] right whatever it goes why the spirit
[1:30:33] follows the word oh I like that
[1:30:37] I like sound Bible teaching and the
[1:30:40] Bible holy ghost coming back to church
[1:30:43] praise the Lord do you see that
[1:30:47] can I use this all all right praise the
[1:30:49] Lord tonight if the Holy Ghost doesn't
[1:30:51] confirm it then you got your wires
[1:30:55] crossed what is the prophet saying
[1:30:57] you will never anoint your pastor to
[1:31:00] come with a weight that's got no conduct
[1:31:03] whatever word your pastor receives or
[1:31:06] whatever word your preacher receives to
[1:31:07] come and give to you there must be a
[1:31:10] conductor somewhere a man because that's
[1:31:13] the order of the word
[1:31:15] and if that conduct that's why you find
[1:31:17] every service has different types of
[1:31:20] breakthroughs praise the Lord because
[1:31:23] when God has his mind on a particular
[1:31:26] person that he has been believing he he
[1:31:29] wants to make sure that the electrical
[1:31:31] wires are drained correctly so you must
[1:31:34] be a conductor not an insulator
[1:31:38] praise the Lord an insulator repels the
[1:31:41] power a conductor attracts the power
[1:31:44] somebody say Amen to that you can't sit
[1:31:47] in church and behave like a plastic and
[1:31:50] expect electricity praise the Lord
[1:31:53] plastic has been known by its qualities
[1:31:56] to be an insulator but a Believer has
[1:32:00] been known to be a conductor somebody
[1:32:02] say Amen to that
[1:32:05] amen that's why you never come to church
[1:32:07] without an expectation because you are
[1:32:10] coming as a complete circuit to
[1:32:14] something that God will energize and
[1:32:17] then you walk out there to make the
[1:32:19] scripture come to pass somebody say Amen
[1:32:23] to that it is God's method he never
[1:32:27] brings a word without a candidate
[1:32:30] he never brings an inspiration without a
[1:32:33] conductor we could all be audiences
[1:32:36] today for just one person who's got the
[1:32:38] right conductivity for what I've come
[1:32:40] from England to come and preach for you
[1:32:43] somebody say Amen to that praise the
[1:32:46] Lord amen listen to what the prophet
[1:32:48] says
[1:32:50] then you've corrupt your ass because
[1:32:52] you've got a ground somewhere
[1:32:55] see yes if you can get the wire hooked
[1:32:58] onto the Dynamo that great thing that
[1:33:01] puts out the fullness of the courage
[1:33:04] he will he will just set the little wire
[1:33:06] a fire
[1:33:07] for you that's right all it will do oh
[1:33:12] and it will do things for you
[1:33:16] a lot somebody asked me one time says
[1:33:18] brother Crosby what's your mode of
[1:33:20] preaching I said my mode of preaching is
[1:33:22] application
[1:33:23] I'm not so much into Mysteries I already
[1:33:26] know the mystics but I've seen Mysteries
[1:33:28] we have seen people with Mysteries and
[1:33:31] yet still go home depressed I've seen
[1:33:33] people with Mysteries still go home
[1:33:35] broke I've seen people with Mysteries go
[1:33:37] to a dysfunctional marriage at all I
[1:33:40] want to tell you brother we've got to
[1:33:42] now come to the point of taking the
[1:33:44] right components of the word so that we
[1:33:46] create a currency of the thing that we
[1:33:49] require
[1:33:50] It's gotta be manifestation that's why I
[1:33:53] said all all of Humanity's problems if
[1:33:57] you are a child of God they are all
[1:33:59] sorted out in the seven compound
[1:34:01] Redemptive names whatever you require
[1:34:03] it's got to be in the seven compound
[1:34:05] Redemptive names there is everything for
[1:34:08] everyone it's an open check amen say
[1:34:11] Amen to that family praise the Lord now
[1:34:14] that code I've put you will notice
[1:34:17] when the Amplified speaks about he
[1:34:20] restoreth my soul it says my soul is
[1:34:24] actually equated to my life or in
[1:34:27] bracket myself remember I'm in this
[1:34:30] message the Messiah he is now saying
[1:34:33] right who's me
[1:34:34] me is not my hand me is not my foot it's
[1:34:38] not my ears it's not my eyes me is not
[1:34:40] this is who these things belong to me
[1:34:43] who's me
[1:34:44] and the me is the soul praise the Lord
[1:34:49] so brother
[1:34:52] do we agree that if we know how to
[1:34:53] connect our wires correctly it will do
[1:34:55] things for us
[1:34:57] you want to go home and find stuff
[1:35:00] you've been believing God for done and
[1:35:02] say this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:35:05] in my home
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:08] praise the Lord
[1:35:13] praise the Lord are you watching me
[1:35:15] sister if you got good visibility
[1:35:17] next
[1:35:20] I figured I would be more time
[1:35:22] conservative if I I step out so that we
[1:35:25] read together praise the Lord
[1:35:27] amen
[1:35:29] if not
[1:35:30] okay hidden life
[1:35:33] so follow in the order that I've given
[1:35:35] you there is I'm not going to skip any
[1:35:37] quotes I'm just going to make sure that
[1:35:38] every quote has been well read praise
[1:35:40] the Lord now brother I'm in the message
[1:35:42] hidden
[1:35:45] here in life in Christ he says tonight
[1:35:48] I want to speak on the subject that's
[1:35:50] very close to me and nowadays we are
[1:35:52] reasoning I'm trying you know I'm trying
[1:35:54] to get we need inside healing
[1:35:58] before we can get
[1:36:01] we need inside healing before we can get
[1:36:06] he restore it
[1:36:10] we need inside healing before we can get
[1:36:14] outside healing I know that to be true
[1:36:18] from dealing with people we will have
[1:36:21] physical healing all right well that
[1:36:24] will take care of itself but first we
[1:36:27] want to have inside healing now that
[1:36:31] brings in perspective the reason why
[1:36:33] Psalm 23 is structured the way it's
[1:36:36] structured it's structured by David
[1:36:39] giving God the absolute leadership to
[1:36:42] his life the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[1:36:45] not want amen he maketh me to lie down
[1:36:48] in Green Pastures yeah and then it goes
[1:36:51] on to say he restoreth my soul and if
[1:36:54] you remember well last night we said
[1:36:56] there will never be no soul restoration
[1:36:59] unless there is proper diet and feeding
[1:37:02] of the weight is that right so the
[1:37:05] coming of the word is like you take a
[1:37:07] journey as a new believer you walk into
[1:37:09] church praise the Lord the first thing
[1:37:11] that happens is the word is preached
[1:37:13] praise the Lord and that word that
[1:37:15] preached praise the Lord takes away
[1:37:16] spiritual Amnesia then something within
[1:37:19] you starts to say I think I identify
[1:37:22] with that I am not there yet but
[1:37:25] something in me says that's nothing but
[1:37:27] the truth there is a familiarity with
[1:37:29] the word that I have received there is
[1:37:31] something in me that makes me think that
[1:37:34] you know what if I stick around a little
[1:37:36] longer these things will will add up is
[1:37:40] that right and once your soul is fed you
[1:37:43] will have strength to start making
[1:37:45] Christian baby steps then you start to
[1:37:48] move on like that a man man because
[1:37:51] you're on the road to saw restoration
[1:37:53] there can never be no soul restoration
[1:37:56] before the hearing Fest before the
[1:37:59] eating of the wet so now we are at the
[1:38:02] stage where brother Brahm says I'm
[1:38:04] dealing with a lot of people I notice
[1:38:07] that I've dealt with people for their
[1:38:10] matters for healing for their matters
[1:38:13] for needs for everything they require
[1:38:15] but I've seen one thing people need them
[1:38:18] inside healing and then the outside
[1:38:21] healing will take care of itself
[1:38:24] in other words if you get the soul
[1:38:27] restored the rest of the body will line
[1:38:30] up with what power is in the soul
[1:38:33] somebody say Amen to that it's never if
[1:38:36] you gave you heal me then I'll worship
[1:38:37] no no no no no no no no no we are not
[1:38:40] here to talk about the pools because
[1:38:42] that was for our Prophet but as far as
[1:38:44] we are concerned we need to give you the
[1:38:46] word because somehow God by
[1:38:49] predestination you are not an incident
[1:38:51] you just starting to identify yourself
[1:38:55] God knew you before you knew yourself
[1:38:58] God knew you before your mama and your
[1:39:01] daddy met God knew you before you were
[1:39:03] even born so as you hear the word
[1:39:06] something in you is starting to say you
[1:39:09] know what I can't understand let alone
[1:39:11] when you are in the message a little bit
[1:39:13] while while longer then you start to
[1:39:15] understand our Dragon then I will say I
[1:39:18] bypassed my theory off and says
[1:39:22] right but what starts first
[1:39:25] something keeps you coming to church
[1:39:27] despite despite thinking I'll never go
[1:39:30] back to that church they preached too
[1:39:32] long they are service Rises but somehow
[1:39:34] you can't stop from coming because the
[1:39:36] thing that's calling you is bigger than
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:39] somebody say Amen to that
[1:39:42] praise the Lord
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:46] says no matter how much
[1:39:49] how loyal will try to be how much we try
[1:39:52] to think that Christ is with us yes
[1:39:55] which is
[1:39:57] but yet it is something the healing has
[1:40:00] something to do with absolutely with the
[1:40:03] individual that's being prayed for
[1:40:05] has to have faith themselves all it will
[1:40:09] not take place
[1:40:10] unless
[1:40:12] it's a vision send for an individual
[1:40:15] you see for an individual case that God
[1:40:17] has his foreknowledge he has foreign
[1:40:22] and you know those things but even in
[1:40:26] Christ's time
[1:40:27] when he was here on Earth the Son of God
[1:40:30] it was according to their faith
[1:40:34] so let's backtrack a bit Faith cometh by
[1:40:38] hearing hearing from the words of God so
[1:40:41] what must start first that you must hear
[1:40:43] and then your soul gets restored it
[1:40:47] starts that Journey now
[1:40:48] praise the Lord praise the Lord and then
[1:40:51] he says here
[1:40:52] it was according to their faith unless
[1:40:55] the father showed the vision remember
[1:40:56] the blind man and the different ones if
[1:40:59] thou can't believe is thou Believers all
[1:41:01] things are possible if thou can't
[1:41:03] believe and so forth
[1:41:05] it's always based upon the faith of the
[1:41:08] individual
[1:41:10] then today the church is in such a temer
[1:41:13] oh my hate to think of it but it's the
[1:41:16] truth
[1:41:17] the church is in a terrible Tema I mean
[1:41:21] universally speaking everywhere you go
[1:41:24] it seems like that there's just
[1:41:26] something going on
[1:41:27] so what we need is an inside healing
[1:41:32] of real fundamental faith in Christ
[1:41:36] Jesus then the outside
[1:41:39] we will just automatically take place
[1:41:43] then the healing starts for the physical
[1:41:48] healing it will begin from the inside
[1:41:51] going out and then something will take
[1:41:55] place it will be lasting and something
[1:41:58] that will be real
[1:42:00] that is why David says He restored my
[1:42:03] soul he knew without a soul restoration
[1:42:05] he's not going any further
[1:42:08] let me tell you brothers and sisters I
[1:42:10] listen until we get a soul restoration
[1:42:12] within us a lot of the things that we
[1:42:14] claim We Believe don't come to pass and
[1:42:17] brother is not saying this statement as
[1:42:20] inspiration he's saying it from research
[1:42:22] because he's saying I've crossed the
[1:42:24] board when I've been going around I see
[1:42:27] this thing
[1:42:28] so it's a research-based quotation it's
[1:42:31] not if people had already shown that
[1:42:34] they understand there was no need for
[1:42:36] him to preach that quotation but because
[1:42:38] people were showing an ignorance they
[1:42:41] were putting the the cut before the
[1:42:43] horses and he said no no let's correct
[1:42:46] things let's have the horses in front of
[1:42:49] the cats
[1:42:50] most people put their physical ability
[1:42:53] their physical needs their physical
[1:42:55] requirements before they are sold
[1:42:59] that's putting the the cut before the
[1:43:02] horses praise the Lord when you deal
[1:43:04] with your soul a lot of the problems
[1:43:07] that you have issues with they somehow
[1:43:10] automatically disappear that is why the
[1:43:14] Bible says You must be born again you
[1:43:17] can kick out an addiction if your soul
[1:43:20] gets right but if you go for Rehab rehab
[1:43:24] is taking care of your physical you will
[1:43:26] go back you will go to a relapse you
[1:43:29] want another high because you are
[1:43:31] dealing with your physical but if you
[1:43:33] deal with your soul the drugs will beat
[1:43:36] you somebody say Amen
[1:43:39] [Applause]
[1:43:41] so you can take out 10 steps
[1:43:45] 10 steps to how to break free
[1:43:48] as long as your soul
[1:43:51] has not been conducted with the word of
[1:43:53] God you are wasting your time after a
[1:43:57] little while you shall go back to that
[1:43:59] rehab again you will start to get high
[1:44:02] coming from this search you will get
[1:44:05] high on the day of discharge after
[1:44:07] having been in there for three months
[1:44:09] because you are dealing with the
[1:44:11] physical you are masking symptoms you
[1:44:14] are not going to the cause but the soul
[1:44:17] possesses the power of transformation
[1:44:20] somebody say Amen to that
[1:44:24] praise the Lord how many believe what
[1:44:26] I'm saying tonight let's save my slides
[1:44:28] my sister we are going somewhere now
[1:44:31] listen to this very carefully brother
[1:44:33] brought him in the message countdown
[1:44:34] goes to a show
[1:44:37] like a Trade Fair like a science show
[1:44:41] and he sees something there praise the
[1:44:44] Lord remember our sermon is soul
[1:44:46] restoration every one of you right now
[1:44:49] has the ability to transform every
[1:44:52] situation in their life be it poverty be
[1:44:55] it addiction everything that is ever
[1:44:58] affecting you you've got the power if we
[1:45:02] just adjust your soul you will know that
[1:45:05] you've got the power somebody say Amen
[1:45:07] to that listen to this
[1:45:10] brother man says but my point is this
[1:45:13] what scientific things has been able to
[1:45:15] achieve
[1:45:16] they were there at the welfare showing
[1:45:20] by scientific research what science has
[1:45:23] been able to achieve in the natural
[1:45:25] things now we are here showing by
[1:45:29] spiritual research what God is able to
[1:45:32] achieve with people who will believe the
[1:45:34] word are you hearing that now to achieve
[1:45:39] scientific things
[1:45:40] you got to work in scientific life to
[1:45:44] achieve spiritual things you got to work
[1:45:47] in spiritual life do you believe us now
[1:45:50] this
[1:45:51] I don't suppose any one of you has ever
[1:45:54] seen coffee but we knew that coffee is
[1:45:56] here and we were all wearing masks we
[1:46:00] were all washing our hands we were all
[1:46:02] staying at home but nobody ever met a
[1:46:04] covet
[1:46:06] praise the Lord but science declared
[1:46:08] that coffee this day and we believe that
[1:46:10] science cannot be wrong because we saw
[1:46:12] people dying we were told symptoms if
[1:46:15] you feel no taste in your mouth and if
[1:46:18] you feel praise the Lord a little bit
[1:46:19] flourish with a bit of temperature and
[1:46:22] no taste go and check you could be
[1:46:24] affected and even when you you know your
[1:46:27] taste buds are already gone because
[1:46:28] you're old you just thought that because
[1:46:30] today I'm not feeling much of my eggs I
[1:46:33] could be having coffee you would have to
[1:46:35] go for a test and be told you are
[1:46:37] negative praise the Lord all that based
[1:46:40] on science how much more the science of
[1:46:42] the Bible what we tell you is going to
[1:46:45] come to pass somebody say Amen to that
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:52] listen to this
[1:46:53] now
[1:46:55] brother Brahm
[1:46:56] go back I don't go back to the previous
[1:46:58] coach I want to to put a continuity to
[1:47:01] it right it says we must operate in
[1:47:03] spiritual lines and then
[1:47:06] he goes to what he saw a it's the
[1:47:09] science fair listen to this
[1:47:12] now
[1:47:14] you think that that looked horrible
[1:47:17] which it did
[1:47:19] you should have seen it wish I had a
[1:47:22] picture of it so brother Brown sees he
[1:47:25] is going in a science fair he goes to
[1:47:27] the sideway there are having guinea pigs
[1:47:30] rats that they were testing for cancers
[1:47:33] and he goes there and he sees a care a
[1:47:36] rat that they put nicotine and poison
[1:47:39] and and cigarettes in there and then he
[1:47:43] says like you think he says you think it
[1:47:45] looked horrible you should have seen it
[1:47:47] and then he said wish I had a picture of
[1:47:51] it yes even to shop so brother wanted to
[1:47:54] take the picture of the rats that was
[1:47:57] infected with cancer from the science
[1:48:00] fair right so that he could come and
[1:48:02] show the church
[1:48:03] what it's like
[1:48:05] says right
[1:48:07] but notice because that red just lives a
[1:48:10] few hours
[1:48:13] some of them don't even live seven days
[1:48:16] out
[1:48:18] is that right
[1:48:19] but think of it you think that looked
[1:48:22] cankered you ought to see what a soul
[1:48:25] looks
[1:48:27] that turned down the gospel
[1:48:30] you ought to look what a hideous looking
[1:48:33] thing they are
[1:48:35] how a devil gets a hold of a man and can
[1:48:39] possess the Son of God into a hideous
[1:48:41] looking thing like he is in the eyes of
[1:48:44] God
[1:48:46] oh he might be a six footer tall or
[1:48:50] shoulders like I don't know what and
[1:48:52] tell her and what and that don't mean
[1:48:55] nothing it's the inside that's Lusty
[1:49:00] the outside just dust anyhow amen do you
[1:49:05] see how
[1:49:06] I've seen people we have been in
[1:49:09] situations of addictions and stuff if
[1:49:12] you ask them deep down there at they'll
[1:49:14] tell you this is not me
[1:49:17] because in there is the seed of God so
[1:49:20] they know that this is not me
[1:49:22] they are yearning for a way out so the
[1:49:25] only way out is to preach the word and
[1:49:28] if the word has been preached and the
[1:49:30] Soul says yes this is this is what I've
[1:49:32] been waiting for the rest of my life
[1:49:36] raise it up sister
[1:49:39] because babram couldn't bring the
[1:49:41] picture I brought the picture for you
[1:49:44] brother Brahm says right this is a rat
[1:49:49] this is a growth of a cancer
[1:49:53] that's how the soul of a person who
[1:49:56] rejects to rejects the word is like
[1:49:59] so every time you see somebody that's
[1:50:01] backslidden and you are very unkind you
[1:50:03] don't realize they need as much care as
[1:50:05] the person that's got cancer
[1:50:07] they have it in the soul
[1:50:11] palliative care they require next sister
[1:50:14] I brought two images look this this
[1:50:17] whole thing here this whole stuff
[1:50:20] is the elongation of the growth of the
[1:50:22] cancer
[1:50:23] and problem says I was not allowed to
[1:50:25] bring the picture from the world fair to
[1:50:28] show off the church how the soul of a
[1:50:31] person who's rejected the word looks
[1:50:33] like
[1:50:34] so when David said he restores my soul
[1:50:39] he was saying that God gives me a
[1:50:42] scriptural therapy
[1:50:45] not a chemotherapy
[1:50:47] the word is pounded on you in such a way
[1:50:51] that you are left with only one choice
[1:50:52] if this is the truth I'll walk in it
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:58] says you ought to see I'd say he just
[1:51:00] looking to go back to the court and then
[1:51:02] come to the picture and then I'll take
[1:51:03] it up why we ought to have a soul
[1:51:06] restoration
[1:51:08] praise the Lord never underestimate
[1:51:11] the need to pray for somebody who's not
[1:51:15] in the position that you are in
[1:51:18] care for them and love them just like
[1:51:21] you do when you hear that sister
[1:51:22] so-and-so has cancer if a brother is
[1:51:25] backslidden know that their soul is now
[1:51:28] can cut
[1:51:30] they need just like those that have
[1:51:33] physical cancer they go for chemotherapy
[1:51:36] radiotherapy let me tell you my brother
[1:51:39] when you come into an atmosphere with
[1:51:41] the amens and praise God in hallelujahs
[1:51:43] it creates an atmosphere where all
[1:51:46] things are possible the devil can stay
[1:51:49] in that kind of an atmosphere
[1:51:52] praise the Lord praise the Lord and I
[1:51:55] give you to understand never judge a
[1:51:57] person because in them could be a soul
[1:52:00] of somebody if God gives his word
[1:52:04] therapy
[1:52:06] and if that's where the therapy works
[1:52:08] let me tell you you have a big better
[1:52:11] wonderful worshiper and praise of God
[1:52:14] than you can ever imagine
[1:52:16] somebody say Amen to that praise the
[1:52:19] Lord I tell you brothers and sister will
[1:52:21] you allow me to tell you a bit about my
[1:52:22] background since I've got a witness
[1:52:24] right here I grew up in the worst
[1:52:26] neighborhood in my town
[1:52:28] praise the Lord I was born there I was
[1:52:31] raised there I grew up there we were
[1:52:33] gangsters from start to finish praise
[1:52:35] the lord we were people that you could
[1:52:37] never mess about praise the Lord but
[1:52:40] when the word struck my heart praise the
[1:52:43] Lord if you saw me walking down the
[1:52:45] street you could never think that there
[1:52:46] is a preacher locked up in that sinner
[1:52:49] but all I needed was to hear a familiar
[1:52:52] voice a voice that I was with from the
[1:52:55] foundation of the world somebody say
[1:52:57] Amen
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:01] praise the Lord
[1:53:03] if you go to my neighborhood you need me
[1:53:06] to survive
[1:53:08] praise the Lord all the gang bangers in
[1:53:10] my neighborhood if I go about don't
[1:53:13] worry it's Crosby praise the Lord don't
[1:53:16] worry it's Crosby ask my my cousin right
[1:53:18] here the west of the West
[1:53:21] if you have a West neighborhood in a
[1:53:25] first world at least it has toilet seats
[1:53:27] that you can actually sit
[1:53:28] where I come from there's little holes
[1:53:32] praise the Lord in the shower upright
[1:53:34] you have to have praise the Lord
[1:53:36] Integrity of knowing that once I take a
[1:53:39] shower I don't move to the left or the
[1:53:40] right until I'm finished otherwise you
[1:53:42] put your foot where it's not supposed to
[1:53:43] go
[1:53:46] praise the Lord
[1:53:47] we saw people whose who
[1:53:50] were spilled
[1:53:52] buildings by knife fights
[1:53:53] praise the Lord you could never think
[1:53:56] that out of that environment can come
[1:53:58] out a preacher
[1:54:01] and when we were again banging we didn't
[1:54:03] like it
[1:54:05] from God but we were conditioned we
[1:54:08] bypassed our fear family so we we did
[1:54:11] what we had to do to survive
[1:54:14] praise the Lord but every time we went
[1:54:16] home something within would say is there
[1:54:19] no better life somewhere
[1:54:21] that was the result speaking now the
[1:54:24] body was testifying otherwise
[1:54:27] praise the Lord
[1:54:29] let me tell you brother never
[1:54:30] underestimate one guy that just steps
[1:54:33] into church
[1:54:34] you never know
[1:54:36] who your right Moody will come from you
[1:54:38] never know who's holding the keys to the
[1:54:42] Rapture somebody say Amen to that
[1:54:44] because until that soul is saved amen
[1:54:48] that's why we've got to have a soul
[1:54:51] restoration
[1:54:53] and don't underestimate when David says
[1:54:56] he restores my soul because this is a
[1:54:58] guy that was once caught up in sin
[1:55:01] such thing that wasn't something that
[1:55:04] happened on a private street corner he
[1:55:07] seen trended praise the Lord but when
[1:55:10] God dealt with him amen David had this
[1:55:14] thing in his heart
[1:55:15] no matter what happens Lord don't cast
[1:55:18] me away no matter what happens what
[1:55:21] creating me a clean heart renew the
[1:55:24] right kind of a spirit in other words if
[1:55:27] it's cancer in my heart you can heal it
[1:55:29] restore my soul
[1:55:31] he restoreth my soul
[1:55:35] that's why I'm preaching about Soul
[1:55:36] restoration
[1:55:38] let me tell you brother if you come out
[1:55:40] of church with the right perspective and
[1:55:43] value to your soul
[1:55:45] every other thing around you ceases to
[1:55:47] matter
[1:55:48] praise the Lord you start to concentrate
[1:55:51] on the the real you inside and the real
[1:55:54] you is a child of God that is why no
[1:55:57] matter what others did there were
[1:55:59] certain lines you could never cross your
[1:56:01] heart will tell you you know what I'm
[1:56:02] dead but I'm not that bad right praise
[1:56:05] the Lord praise the Lord amen are you
[1:56:08] hearing me tonight amen how many saying
[1:56:11] Lord we want a soul a restoration this
[1:56:14] gives you whenever you know somebody
[1:56:16] that was once in this church that's
[1:56:18] bexleyden don't write them off start to
[1:56:21] say almighty God start a chemotherapy in
[1:56:25] their life almighty God give them a word
[1:56:27] therapy in their life almighty God let
[1:56:30] the words be preached in their life
[1:56:33] praise the Lord that's why I thank God
[1:56:35] we're the prophet who could see things
[1:56:37] what he saw in those rats
[1:56:40] was able for him to see what the soul of
[1:56:42] a big sliding person looks like
[1:56:45] praise the Lord and I believe as I'm
[1:56:48] preaching this if the word has its
[1:56:51] customer tonight there is conductivity
[1:56:53] the Holy Ghost is going bench to bench
[1:56:56] looking for that person who says that
[1:56:58] word is me and if you say it's me you
[1:57:01] say Lord start the healing process it
[1:57:04] will be an inside out type of a healing
[1:57:07] somebody shout amen maybe you've never
[1:57:10] shouted for crying out loud but tonight
[1:57:13] it could be the trust you see when you
[1:57:15] are ill you go to the doctors they give
[1:57:17] you a prescription you don't question
[1:57:19] most of the times that why are you
[1:57:20] giving me this it's only when it has
[1:57:22] side effects praise the Lord but at
[1:57:24] least you try it have you ever tried
[1:57:26] saying praise God one time see what
[1:57:28] happens in your spirit have you ever
[1:57:30] said Hallelujah see what happens in your
[1:57:33] spirit your driver said I'll say thank
[1:57:35] you Jesus if I had ever thought to
[1:57:38] yourself
[1:57:41] that's how we all got saved
[1:57:44] when we walked into church everybody we
[1:57:47] felt like we didn't belong everybody
[1:57:49] looked like they were already saved
[1:57:51] because all my days these people wow wow
[1:57:56] they have it all together praise the
[1:57:58] Lord but when the word was being
[1:57:59] preached I forgot about the people
[1:58:01] around me I said hey the Lord is my
[1:58:04] shepherd I shall not want somebody say
[1:58:07] Amen to that
[1:58:09] I came out of my comfort zone
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:12] you see someone that came with you to
[1:58:14] Jesus
[1:58:17] because when you when the word hits your
[1:58:20] heart there's no predicting what you do
[1:58:23] see because you are not a plastic
[1:58:25] there is conductivity around you you are
[1:58:28] copper wires just waiting for the
[1:58:30] generator to be connected properly and
[1:58:33] then you shout out an amen
[1:58:36] even your wife say hey what happened
[1:58:38] today says I can't explain but there was
[1:58:40] some healing happening and I the doctor
[1:58:43] will say they are responding to their
[1:58:45] word therapy Hallelujah
[1:58:48] praise be to God you must have something
[1:58:51] within you that Echoes to the power of
[1:58:54] God
[1:58:55] praise the Lord Brother Brahma went into
[1:58:57] a place where there was a sister
[1:59:00] praise the Lord and that sister was in a
[1:59:02] Mental Health institution and that
[1:59:04] sister was given up by everybody and
[1:59:07] brother Brahm walks in and the sister
[1:59:09] says start with me says but sister you
[1:59:12] don't look like you need help he says oh
[1:59:14] no I'm far gone you know I was here I
[1:59:16] was once arrested I'm an alcoholic and
[1:59:19] blah blah blah you know the long story
[1:59:20] that your body tells you you are that's
[1:59:22] why today we are not preaching to your
[1:59:24] body right because we noticed that when
[1:59:26] we preach to your body you go back to
[1:59:27] your things but if we preach and address
[1:59:29] your soul you say Amen this is where I
[1:59:34] belong
[1:59:36] praise the Lord
[1:59:38] so he has this conversation with his
[1:59:40] sister what went wrong says Ah you know
[1:59:42] I was the child of a Preacher my grandma
[1:59:44] used to go to church but somewhere there
[1:59:46] I got into wrong company and when I got
[1:59:48] into wrong company things begin to
[1:59:50] happen and I went with so and so and
[1:59:51] this is this and now you know what
[1:59:53] nobody will ever don't you desire to be
[1:59:56] married one day be somebody's lover you
[1:59:59] know like the mother and somebody that
[2:00:02] someone will say I've got to rush home
[2:00:04] to my wife
[2:00:05] sure it says well who death me
[2:00:09] because obviously his story was on
[2:00:11] Facebook Instagram everybody knew her
[2:00:14] story
[2:00:15] it would be so ridiculous to say you
[2:00:17] want to melt that one so she already
[2:00:19] discounted herself out of the race
[2:00:21] so brother now is trying to now connect
[2:00:23] with her soul
[2:00:26] despite being in now you are not even in
[2:00:28] a mental institute you are in church
[2:00:32] in church
[2:00:34] on a flight where on a Saturday and
[2:00:37] right now people are busy
[2:00:39] yeah partying praise the Lord because I
[2:00:42] came from the ghetto I can do that a
[2:00:43] little bit praise the Lord people are
[2:00:46] busy right now stuff is going down and
[2:00:49] you found yourself in the house of the
[2:00:51] Lord
[2:00:52] it's because God he has orchestrated all
[2:00:55] our audience with you in mind
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:59] praise the Lord you are the important
[2:01:01] one tonight
[2:01:04] praise the Lord so now the sister says
[2:01:07] nobody will leave me says no no no your
[2:01:09] case was diagnosed wrong
[2:01:12] that's what the prophet said that's the
[2:01:13] words he uses
[2:01:15] diagnosed
[2:01:17] so it means there was something about
[2:01:19] the soul that needed diagnosis
[2:01:22] for case was diagnosed wrong says okay
[2:01:25] right do you believe
[2:01:27] change you now says oh yes I've always
[2:01:30] believed somehow that but I've never had
[2:01:31] an opportunity
[2:01:33] it's okay let's pray
[2:01:35] and then the sister started praying and
[2:01:38] she was praying as if she's just been
[2:01:40] you know scratched
[2:01:43] she didn't realize that it's far more
[2:01:44] deeper
[2:01:45] so she prayed as if all she needed was a
[2:01:49] little bandage
[2:01:51] not thank you thank you thank you Jesus
[2:01:54] and the prophet stops it stop it pray
[2:01:59] until something happens
[2:02:01] then they continue playing now when she
[2:02:05] yelled out says it's done now it Prophet
[2:02:08] said I knew from that very moment that
[2:02:11] she is safe
[2:02:16] for all we know for all we know from
[2:02:20] that moment on
[2:02:22] you could think that it was the person
[2:02:24] you saw last night but from that moment
[2:02:27] on program preaches a sermon he calls
[2:02:29] from that time you can have your own
[2:02:33] from that time tonight
[2:02:36] Not Another Day tonight can be you from
[2:02:40] that time
[2:02:43] and you will always have something to
[2:02:45] say about your night from that time you
[2:02:48] say I don't know where brother one got
[2:02:51] this short crazy preacher he couldn't
[2:02:53] even stay behind the pulpit he was
[2:02:55] walking all over the place laughing and
[2:02:57] puffing but let me tell you brother
[2:02:59] there is always something significant
[2:03:01] when your soul says yes
[2:03:03] [Applause]
[2:03:04] Hallelujah
[2:03:05] right about now we are not asking you to
[2:03:08] join a church we are asking you to
[2:03:11] explore yourself
[2:03:12] we are asking you to decide to take the
[2:03:16] scripture say I'll give the word a
[2:03:19] chance
[2:03:21] I wish I could go and preach in all the
[2:03:24] rehab centers and by the way I'm a
[2:03:26] psychiatric nurse by the way I will know
[2:03:28] I wish I could go because you go there
[2:03:31] you are addicted to heroin they will
[2:03:33] give you a lesser substitute of the same
[2:03:36] drug
[2:03:37] they'll give you methadone
[2:03:39] praise the Lord which is the exact same
[2:03:42] problem you have it is less it's like a
[2:03:45] step down but it can get so much that at
[2:03:48] least you will know there are people who
[2:03:49] actually go and do what is called I
[2:03:51] don't know about America but in England
[2:03:52] we call it speed meth where you will go
[2:03:55] for rehab and you will get methadone and
[2:03:59] you drink it before the nest so that
[2:04:00] they can sign you off and you don't
[2:04:01] drink it you have a way of gargling it
[2:04:03] and holding it in and then as soon as
[2:04:05] you're away from the presence of the uh
[2:04:07] the nurse you go and spit it out in a
[2:04:09] little cell you can actually go and sell
[2:04:11] it
[2:04:14] oh yeah when your soul is like that
[2:04:16] right
[2:04:17] you don't mind drinking people's alive
[2:04:19] talk about hygiene
[2:04:23] you don't mind because all you want is
[2:04:25] your eye
[2:04:27] because it's not it's not any the devil
[2:04:31] is taken hold
[2:04:32] of your soul
[2:04:34] so your your soul is like you see cancer
[2:04:37] will make you do stuff that you never
[2:04:39] thought you would do
[2:04:41] so what you need is something that's
[2:04:43] bigger than that cancer
[2:04:45] so we've got to attack it
[2:04:47] from radiotherapy attack it from
[2:04:51] chemotherapy attack it with alternative
[2:04:53] medicine because cancer is stubborn
[2:04:56] that's what addiction is like whether
[2:04:59] it's addiction to drugs addiction to sex
[2:05:01] addiction to anything in addiction will
[2:05:04] wake you up in all the hours you ever
[2:05:06] seen anyone addicted to cigarettes
[2:05:08] nicotine
[2:05:10] they know how to light the cigarette
[2:05:12] with their eyes closed in bed
[2:05:18] faster sleep
[2:05:23] it's that drug it's that that's that
[2:05:26] cancer
[2:05:27] demon eating your nutrients
[2:05:29] right do you know that if you develop
[2:05:31] cancer in the body you will have a sweet
[2:05:34] tooth
[2:05:35] it's because the life of the cancer
[2:05:38] wants to grow and it needs sugar for
[2:05:41] energy
[2:05:44] so right now as you've been able to
[2:05:46] endure Church sitting there attentive
[2:05:50] paying attention right now you are more
[2:05:53] than an overcomer
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:56] you've said the devil trying to make you
[2:05:59] say come on stand up go to the toilet
[2:06:01] and you're saying no I'm not going it's
[2:06:02] your soul that's now overcoming the
[2:06:04] devil's saying get out of church get out
[2:06:06] of it now come on get out you've heard
[2:06:08] enough it's taking too long and your
[2:06:10] soul is saying
[2:06:12] nobody goes to a concert and it's played
[2:06:15] for 13 minutes and they don't demand a
[2:06:17] refund
[2:06:22] where people are particular about things
[2:06:24] that they don't need to pay particular
[2:06:25] attention to I praise the Lord
[2:06:28] amen how many episodes are praise the
[2:06:31] Lord let me go back to my quotes my
[2:06:33] sister
[2:06:34] praise the Lord are we getting our
[2:06:36] little lesson yeah
[2:06:38] praise the Lord now brother Brahm goes
[2:06:40] on to a message the thinking man's
[2:06:41] future he says now to follow that in the
[2:06:45] continuity of the message
[2:06:47] the word of God
[2:06:51] the anointed ones in the last time the
[2:06:54] outside
[2:06:55] the middle cycle
[2:06:57] life cycle of the human senses
[2:07:00] the second cycle is the spirit's senses
[2:07:04] will self you desire
[2:07:09] that's why
[2:07:11] nobody
[2:07:12] is born with a love to smoke the first
[2:07:16] time you smoke
[2:07:17] you coughed like you had never coughed
[2:07:20] before
[2:07:22] and your friends there to strengthen his
[2:07:24] uh first timer don't worry you see your
[2:07:27] body your lungs were rejecting
[2:07:29] nicotiness
[2:07:31] you have to actually force it by your
[2:07:34] will until you become a seasoned smoker
[2:07:37] right
[2:07:39] alcohol is never tasty
[2:07:43] no you you can't substitute Kool-Aid
[2:07:45] with alcohol but along the way your
[2:07:48] palate
[2:07:49] palette gets used to it so brother I
[2:07:52] mean the message thinking man's filter
[2:07:53] says desire and sufferth but the inside
[2:07:57] is that
[2:07:59] oh help me open your mouth somebody help
[2:08:01] me preach the inside is that
[2:08:06] soul
[2:08:08] was predestinated
[2:08:12] this is where you say to a sister and a
[2:08:14] brother that's conscious don't judge me
[2:08:15] my friend we are all looking for the
[2:08:18] same Quest going back where we come from
[2:08:23] praise the Lord don't mind my hairstyle
[2:08:25] I'll get right one day leave me alone
[2:08:28] praise the Lord I need to identify
[2:08:31] myself listen to this
[2:08:33] so you can anoint this Spirit to make
[2:08:37] the outside body come into subject to
[2:08:40] the spirit but the soul
[2:08:42] that sinneth that Soul shall die
[2:08:47] in other words the soul that disbelieves
[2:08:51] that Soul shall die praise the Lord
[2:08:54] listen to this let's leave the rest line
[2:08:56] together the soul that rejects
[2:08:59] in unbelief the word of God which is a
[2:09:04] part of that Soul Child
[2:09:07] eternally is always
[2:09:09] I believe in an eternal death
[2:09:12] we know that it's it's forever
[2:09:14] same as I believe in Eternal heaven but
[2:09:17] not in eternal hell
[2:09:20] there is no such a thing as an eternal
[2:09:23] hell there is an eternal death for the
[2:09:26] people that many of them religious
[2:09:29] in the world today has always been dead
[2:09:33] think about places where they are
[2:09:35] gathering and not preaching the word of
[2:09:37] the day
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:09:39] it's a an oncology word full of cancer
[2:09:43] victims
[2:09:45] because they don't have the right word
[2:09:46] that can bring a power of transformation
[2:09:50] praise the Lord listen to this
[2:09:54] the woman that lives in pleasure
[2:09:56] with a bobbed hand-painted face is dead
[2:09:59] while she's alive the Bible said so see
[2:10:01] she may be religious but she never was
[2:10:05] saved she's got an outward emotion
[2:10:08] she might sing in the choir she might
[2:10:10] dance in the spirit she might speak in
[2:10:12] tongues and they have all these
[2:10:14] manifestations of the spirit but unless
[2:10:16] that Soul on the inside is a daughter of
[2:10:20] God
[2:10:23] and you couldn't be
[2:10:26] there is no better evidence that you are
[2:10:28] a daughter of God than the fact that God
[2:10:30] brought you today
[2:10:33] God brought you to church today because
[2:10:36] he knows in you is the soul of God
[2:10:39] so now you need a word to energize and
[2:10:42] conduct with your soul and then you make
[2:10:45] a decision somebody say Amen to that if
[2:10:48] the devil is saying to you maybe you are
[2:10:50] not a daughter of God it's actually
[2:10:51] evidence that you are because those that
[2:10:54] he has he never talks to them
[2:10:57] the devil has no business trying to
[2:10:59] convince his subject
[2:11:03] he will never have an effort to convince
[2:11:06] you that it's not you if he's already
[2:11:08] got you
[2:11:11] but if the devil is Whispering to you to
[2:11:13] say what if I'm not a child of God you
[2:11:15] are a child of God Amen right
[2:11:17] and let me reiterate that you are a
[2:11:20] child of God
[2:11:22] you see you never planned the same for
[2:11:24] me
[2:11:25] but you walked right into it
[2:11:31] it's not something that has come
[2:11:33] freestyle
[2:11:36] it's already been there
[2:11:38] remember I told you last night I'm
[2:11:39] preaching about the Lord is my shepherd
[2:11:41] I've been preaching about that since the
[2:11:43] beginning of the year I'm still on verse
[2:11:45] 4. right now I only skipped the other
[2:11:48] part to go to this one because I feel in
[2:11:51] my belief that it's far more important
[2:11:52] then tomorrow I'll keep it up with like
[2:11:56] with a sermon called I shall fear no
[2:11:58] evil because if your soul has been
[2:12:01] converted all your fears you cease to be
[2:12:04] a prisoner to them
[2:12:07] somebody say Amen to that
[2:12:10] says
[2:12:11] unless that's all on the inside
[2:12:15] is God's daughter
[2:12:18] amen see she is gone no matter what she
[2:12:22] does
[2:12:23] raise that my sister now brother brother
[2:12:25] was hunting one time and in his notes
[2:12:28] there was a little diagram scribbled he
[2:12:31] was trying to explain to the hunting
[2:12:33] party that he was with that listened
[2:12:34] Brothers for you to understand this so
[2:12:36] I've actually more like uh made it
[2:12:39] neater it's on a scribble note
[2:12:42] so he says like thou the greatest
[2:12:44] distance
[2:12:46] is like from the mind
[2:12:49] right
[2:12:50] to the soul
[2:12:52] yeah the mind is the womb of the spirit
[2:12:57] the problem draws this and he says if
[2:13:01] you if you notice if you notice only
[2:13:03] I've put it like wiggling like a snake
[2:13:05] he says every one of us has a little
[2:13:08] snake right that starts to affect from
[2:13:12] the mind and that's the snake you need
[2:13:15] to kill for your soul to have a chance
[2:13:19] it's in brother Brown's notes and that's
[2:13:21] the bed so he says the body has five
[2:13:25] senses
[2:13:26] see here taste feel smell that's the
[2:13:30] body now blah blah mean dealing with
[2:13:32] people he saw that people are
[2:13:34] concentrating on
[2:13:37] the body
[2:13:39] and they are concentrating on
[2:13:42] the spirit
[2:13:46] imagination these are the senses
[2:13:48] now if your mind if you just imagine
[2:13:52] that what we are saying is the truth
[2:13:54] yeah you've overcome the first step yes
[2:13:58] and then if your memory remember
[2:14:00] something good that
[2:14:02] than your life
[2:14:06] you know what this guy is from England
[2:14:08] he doesn't know me he just came with his
[2:14:10] sermon you can check it on my website
[2:14:13] I've been preaching I've been preaching
[2:14:14] this very sermon
[2:14:15] some three Sundays ago
[2:14:17] and I've brought it here and if you can
[2:14:20] reason to think to yourself that you
[2:14:21] know what what if it's the truth
[2:14:24] this is the Bible this man has said
[2:14:26] nothing but red quotes and scriptures
[2:14:30] praise the Lord I read for you the
[2:14:32] scripture the quote where problem says
[2:14:34] you know what I went to the world fair
[2:14:36] and I saw red skin card with cancer
[2:14:40] and I wanted to take a picture but they
[2:14:43] didn't allow me but I now today by
[2:14:46] technology I just have to Google and say
[2:14:48] rate with cancer and I brought the
[2:14:50] images she says that's how the soul of a
[2:14:53] person that rejects the word looks like
[2:14:55] in other words those rats with cancer
[2:14:58] are an x-ray into a big sliding soul
[2:15:03] say Amen to that somebody
[2:15:05] now brother Brahm says
[2:15:08] in the message there is barely ever
[2:15:10] fought says it's the Glitters where I
[2:15:12] ever thought it's in the mind right
[2:15:15] right now if I say make a decision to
[2:15:17] serve Christ the first thing you'll ask
[2:15:20] will my boyfriend agree
[2:15:22] what about my mom
[2:15:24] what about
[2:15:25] tomorrow next week we're supposed to go
[2:15:27] to uh Saint Paul's we got this party and
[2:15:31] you you might that's where the greatest
[2:15:33] battle is
[2:15:34] that's why the soul
[2:15:37] has to outrun the mind
[2:15:41] the soul will affect your conscience
[2:15:43] your conscience will tell you be honest
[2:15:46] be honest that's nothing but the truth
[2:15:50] be honest
[2:15:51] you know you don't like the life you
[2:15:53] live
[2:15:54] your conscience is kicking in
[2:15:56] your memory will remind you
[2:15:59] when you almost died coming from a party
[2:16:01] because both of you were drunk the
[2:16:03] driver and the passenger
[2:16:05] everything will start to point to your
[2:16:08] survival the things you've survived then
[2:16:11] if your soul says you know what I love
[2:16:13] the word yeah
[2:16:15] there is conductivity that starts now
[2:16:26] myself the real you is your soul
[2:16:32] the answer to who's me
[2:16:34] is your soul
[2:16:39] everything else
[2:16:41] can be subject to your soul
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:46] praise the Lord
[2:16:47] and then your soul only has two senses
[2:16:52] Faith or doubt
[2:16:54] I never said faith in unbelief I say
[2:16:56] doubt because doubt is not absolute
[2:17:00] denial right
[2:17:02] it's pots
[2:17:04] complying
[2:17:06] and parts denying
[2:17:09] doubt is a lot more dangerous than
[2:17:11] unbelief
[2:17:15] doubts means at some point you say I see
[2:17:18] your point
[2:17:21] but you still don't agree
[2:17:24] and you contemplate other things right
[2:17:26] so when David
[2:17:28] was caught up in sin
[2:17:32] did he say restore my soul he said
[2:17:34] create me a cleaner heart and he said
[2:17:37] restore the joy
[2:17:40] of my salvation
[2:17:43] because once the joy has been taken away
[2:17:46] your mind will start saying you see you
[2:17:48] were never safe to begin with it wants
[2:17:50] to kick in the doubt sense so David by
[2:17:53] understanding his inner man he
[2:17:57] challenged that right
[2:17:59] right I wonder what would happen if we
[2:18:01] challenge our doubts yeah
[2:18:04] praise the Lord
[2:18:06] praise the Lord
[2:18:07] sister I'll have you come to our church
[2:18:09] anytime you respond very well
[2:18:12] there's something seasoned about you and
[2:18:14] this message praise the Lord do you love
[2:18:16] the Lord
[2:18:17] amen it's good when you preach and you
[2:18:19] know that it's sucking real in
[2:18:22] praise the Lord
[2:18:24] now
[2:18:25] when program preached the greatest
[2:18:27] battle ever fought he says Satan
[2:18:30] deals with your brain
[2:18:32] your brain considers what your friends
[2:18:36] will think about your decision right
[2:18:39] your brain thinks about so where do we
[2:18:42] go from here but once your soul says yes
[2:18:46] your soul behaves like buddy Robinson
[2:18:48] says I will not I will not go home until
[2:18:52] you save me that's right your song
[2:18:54] behaves
[2:19:01] change me
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:06] praise the Lord
[2:19:07] brother I don't know what to say from
[2:19:10] this point on but what I can tell you
[2:19:12] brothers and sisters is that God is
[2:19:14] bigger and better and has better plans
[2:19:16] for our lives than we actually suspect
[2:19:19] raise it up sister I'm about to wind
[2:19:21] down
[2:19:22] listen to this
[2:19:24] listen to this very very carefully
[2:19:28] this is not skimmed milk things that are
[2:19:31] to be
[2:19:33] and if you ever was in the audience
[2:19:37] Israel China and all those places which
[2:19:40] I preached in there many times after the
[2:19:43] wedding supper still carried out on the
[2:19:44] way it was the bridegroom
[2:19:47] that all he has so many guests that is
[2:19:50] going to have probably brother cope
[2:19:52] probably you've watched it there in
[2:19:54] India see they have so many guests he is
[2:19:57] going to ask say he is going to ask 30
[2:20:00] guests now the bridegroom has to furnish
[2:20:03] the robes
[2:20:05] he has to furnish them therefore there's
[2:20:08] a there's a man that stands at the door
[2:20:10] and you come up with your invitation he
[2:20:14] examines your invitation and puts on
[2:20:16] your Garment of a robe I wish we had
[2:20:19] weddings like that where when you are
[2:20:21] invited
[2:20:22] the one who's invited you send you a
[2:20:24] suit
[2:20:26] that's what they do in the audience
[2:20:29] praise the Lord
[2:20:33] that some of them are rich and some of
[2:20:35] them are poor and some of them are
[2:20:36] different but
[2:20:39] when they get the wrong
[2:20:41] they all look alike
[2:20:45] and you have to all be alike
[2:20:48] you ain't going to say a Methodist here
[2:20:51] I'm Presbyterian oh no you ain't going
[2:20:54] in the first place you see you've got to
[2:20:57] come by the door
[2:21:00] I Am The Shepherd of the ship no man
[2:21:04] comes to me but through the door and
[2:21:07] then after saying through the door he
[2:21:09] says I am
[2:21:10] the door
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:13] praise the Lord and to understand the
[2:21:16] door tonight is the word that's been
[2:21:19] preached
[2:21:20] that's what ushers us in
[2:21:23] we came because we had a message
[2:21:27] yes are you with me
[2:21:29] I am the door to the shipfold
[2:21:32] I'm Pentecostal I'm this I'm that
[2:21:34] problem is being sarcastic that don't
[2:21:37] mean one thing you come by that capital
[2:21:40] D though
[2:21:42] and if you come by that door you get the
[2:21:45] robe
[2:21:46] and this man when he said how did you
[2:21:49] get a friend
[2:21:52] it showed that he comes some other way
[2:21:55] and come in the window come in the back
[2:21:58] way but not through the door not through
[2:22:01] the door the way that Jesus came through
[2:22:05] self-sacrifice
[2:22:06] giving you all to God
[2:22:09] and walking to Calvary and be crucified
[2:22:12] with him and Rise Again to where His
[2:22:16] Garment of sacrifice and death to the
[2:22:19] things of the world
[2:22:22] taking a decision to be a Christian
[2:22:25] wearing the Garment of sacrifice
[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:29] if you love the world all the things of
[2:22:32] the world the love of God is not even in
[2:22:34] you
[2:22:35] see if you still have the love of the
[2:22:38] world want to act like the world do like
[2:22:40] the world
[2:22:41] you are you you are you are in the
[2:22:44] church
[2:22:46] in the patch with wheat Shout with the
[2:22:49] rest of them Rejoice with the rest of
[2:22:51] them
[2:22:52] all the spiritual blessings is Right
[2:22:56] upon you you say well I prophesy so did
[2:22:59] carefus yes
[2:23:00] so did Balaam that is nothing to do
[2:23:03] because many people want to pin their
[2:23:06] Eternal destination to their experience
[2:23:08] that's what the prophet is denying
[2:23:12] right he's taking it to one thing
[2:23:16] I've got the baptism the holy spirit
[2:23:18] that still has nothing to do with it
[2:23:22] that's just only a temporal gift
[2:23:27] for you
[2:23:28] what's the real gift let's leave that
[2:23:30] together
[2:23:31] the real gift is your soul down in there
[2:23:39] that was born of God that controls the
[2:23:43] whole thing to the word of God and the
[2:23:47] will of God
[2:23:48] [Music]
[2:23:51] this is where I say I don't like church
[2:23:53] members
[2:23:55] I like people with the soul connection
[2:23:57] with God
[2:24:00] when your soul
[2:24:03] that's the gift
[2:24:05] the holy spirit is a temporal one
[2:24:08] it can flow in the wrong place
[2:24:09] but when your soul says yes
[2:24:12] to the word of God now we are talking
[2:24:16] amen praise the Lord and then he says
[2:24:21] the real gifts
[2:24:23] is your soul down there
[2:24:26] see
[2:24:27] that was born of God that controls
[2:24:31] the whole thing
[2:24:33] now brother Brahma is saying the real
[2:24:36] gift is your soul in 1965 1955 you are
[2:24:40] saying in dealing with people I've seen
[2:24:43] that they concentrate on the wrong thing
[2:24:45] because if you concentrate on the soul
[2:24:47] if your soul has been restored it means
[2:24:50] control has been given back to you
[2:24:52] that's right amen
[2:24:53] you can now control where you go you
[2:24:56] have the power to say no and you know is
[2:24:58] your no your body won't say no but we
[2:25:01] want it
[2:25:02] you've got power over your Cravings
[2:25:03] you've got power over addictions you've
[2:25:06] got power over desires you've got power
[2:25:08] over anything
[2:25:11] because when you don't have that power
[2:25:13] you are a victim you are a captive
[2:25:16] and the gospel came to set captives
[2:25:19] does your soul agree with the way
[2:25:21] tonight
[2:25:22] listen to this
[2:25:25] I feel like reading it again do you mind
[2:25:28] says yeah the real gift is your soul
[2:25:32] down in there see that was born of God
[2:25:35] and that controls the whole thing
[2:25:40] to the word of God
[2:25:42] and
[2:25:44] the will of God
[2:25:47] and there you grow up
[2:25:49] see then you are a son and daughter of
[2:25:52] God you are a child of God and these
[2:25:56] things as you come up like the mother
[2:25:58] now you are in the powers of the Earth
[2:26:02] trying to come forth you are a son of
[2:26:05] God coming forth and you see the word
[2:26:09] says I should do this I should be born
[2:26:11] again well I belong to church that don't
[2:26:13] mean one thing
[2:26:16] so now
[2:26:18] with this I'd like to submit to you the
[2:26:20] importance of the restoration
[2:26:23] of the Soul
[2:26:24] that's where we've got power
[2:26:26] that's where all that the message
[2:26:30] is trying to address
[2:26:32] not your physical being
[2:26:35] your soul
[2:26:37] because that's the gift of God
[2:26:39] that's what came from God that's what
[2:26:41] that's what goes back to God as we rise
[2:26:43] to our feet
[2:26:52] okay
[2:27:04] praise the Lord
[2:27:07] your soul is yourself
[2:27:12] that's who you are
[2:27:15] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[2:27:19] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[2:27:22] Pastures for feeding
[2:27:26] then the next thing is he restoreth
[2:27:29] my soul
[2:27:35] sing that song song leader my soul says
[2:27:37] yes
[2:27:41] [Music]
[2:27:53] say yes
[2:27:55] [Music]
[2:28:04] birthday
[2:28:07] s
[2:28:12] oh my soul say yes
[2:28:17] say yes say yes say yes
[2:28:24] my soul says yes yes
[2:28:29] [Music]
[2:28:31] you know
[2:28:33] my sources yes my soul say yes
[2:28:40] say yes yes
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:55] the way
[2:28:58] can I give you a clue how some of us got
[2:29:00] saved
[2:29:02] there was never a day
[2:29:04] my heart ever beat
[2:29:07] [Music]
[2:29:08] like the day I walked into church
[2:29:12] I'd heard church I did preaching
[2:29:15] but that day
[2:29:17] it was like my life was made bare
[2:29:21] with my upbringing I wasn't even
[2:29:24] religious at all no one in my family was
[2:29:27] a church member
[2:29:29] it was so bad
[2:29:31] but the way my heart was under
[2:29:34] conviction the way it did it was as if
[2:29:38] this man that was preaching
[2:29:41] all he ever did was just address me
[2:29:44] here it was in a congregation
[2:29:47] as big as this one
[2:29:49] gave my heart to Christ
[2:29:52] and I've been 35 years in the message
[2:29:54] now
[2:29:55] since that time my life got right I
[2:29:59] married right I live right
[2:30:02] but I come from the west of the
[2:30:04] backgrounds
[2:30:06] what made me respond was if I don't
[2:30:09] respond to this
[2:30:11] what shall be my life after this
[2:30:14] with this that I know
[2:30:16] that I've had shall I clean this away
[2:30:19] from my life
[2:30:23] that was my
[2:30:25] point of conviction
[2:30:27] and when I told my friends that I've
[2:30:28] made my mind up
[2:30:30] I want to follow Jesus the correct way
[2:30:34] this wasn't a popcorn sermon
[2:30:37] where are you going says Jesus loves us
[2:30:39] we know he does
[2:30:41] but this is a question about the
[2:30:45] restoration of your soul there is no
[2:30:48] restoration of the Soul outside of the
[2:30:50] message of the hour
[2:30:52] because that's where the correct diet
[2:30:55] praise the Lord one of my sermons prior
[2:30:58] to this is led by a prophet Shepherd
[2:31:01] his brother but I'm in the message why
[2:31:02] it had to be Shepherds he dramatizes
[2:31:05] something that is so poignant and
[2:31:08] Powerful
[2:31:09] he takes the I the the drama of Exodus
[2:31:14] chapter 4.
[2:31:15] Exodus chapter 4.
[2:31:18] when Moses stood before the burning bush
[2:31:23] and the Ben burning bush spoke
[2:31:27] Moses said it
[2:31:28] who will I say has sent me he said the I
[2:31:32] am
[2:31:34] says well but the people who not believe
[2:31:36] me
[2:31:37] says what's that in your hand
[2:31:39] throw it down pick it up again
[2:31:43] and then after that he says take your
[2:31:46] right hands
[2:31:48] and put it inside
[2:31:52] take it out
[2:31:54] it was leporous a type of sin then he
[2:31:58] said put it back in
[2:32:00] then he took it out it was clear
[2:32:04] and the prophet of God says I don't
[2:32:07] suppose Moses
[2:32:10] was left-handed because program was now
[2:32:13] locating the fact that brother when he
[2:32:15] put his hand he was putting it to the
[2:32:18] left where his heart is it says right
[2:32:21] there it's the heart he was hiding the
[2:32:24] mysteries of redemption
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:29] that's what he did at Calvary those
[2:32:32] three days was the hand coming in when
[2:32:35] he said it is finished it was the end
[2:32:37] coming out
[2:32:40] message
[2:32:43] the situation under control
[2:32:46] but not from another Corporal body
[2:32:50] a restored soul
[2:32:52] [Music]
[2:32:55] your soul has got to be restored to take
[2:32:58] control
[2:33:02] let's sing it one more time my soul says
[2:33:04] yes
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:14] yes
[2:33:25] [Music]
[2:33:39] [Music]
[2:33:48] [Music]
[2:34:00] [Music]
[2:34:04] but my soul says yes
[2:34:09] my sources
[2:34:11] [Music]
[2:34:22] yes
[2:34:25] [Music]
[2:34:40] gracious father
[2:34:42] almighty God In The Name Of The Lord
[2:34:44] Jesus Christ we realize Lord that
[2:34:47] without the message of Malachi 4 5. Lord
[2:34:50] will be having diets that's not
[2:34:53] conducive for a body transformation
[2:34:55] father your word has come to tell us
[2:34:58] that when we feed in the stored food
[2:35:00] then it brings a restoration to our
[2:35:03] souls and if that transformation starts
[2:35:05] within if that makes us to understand
[2:35:08] Lord that all the other elements will
[2:35:11] follow suit father because the greatest
[2:35:13] gift you gave us is our souls therefore
[2:35:16] Lord we understand that we come from God
[2:35:18] and we go back to God it was so
[2:35:21] imperative and important for David to
[2:35:23] say he restoreth my soul and I pray
[2:35:26] tonight through these humble words
[2:35:28] you've allowed us to utter before your
[2:35:30] people may you so anoint them and give
[2:35:33] them conductivity in the hearts of your
[2:35:35] people and start a journey of Soul
[2:35:37] transformation may your people so be
[2:35:40] healed inside that it becomes an inside
[2:35:43] out job that Lord dear God if ever it
[2:35:47] takes a power of the scripture for a
[2:35:49] therapy May there be such a weird
[2:35:51] therapy that your people will start a
[2:35:53] journey back to the America like you did
[2:35:56] with that sister from that time May
[2:35:58] tonight be from that time for somebody
[2:36:01] Lord I plead your blood and I pray in
[2:36:04] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Have
[2:36:06] Thine Own Way bless your people almighty
[2:36:09] God undertake for them undertake for our
[2:36:12] youth the young men the brothers the
[2:36:15] sisters Lord our mothers our fathers and
[2:36:18] all the Believers in divine presence
[2:36:19] Lord may we pin it down to the
[2:36:22] relationship of the word and the soul
[2:36:24] and we say tonight our soul says yes
[2:36:27] europa's Father restore our souls Lord
[2:36:30] the word of God can never be preached
[2:36:32] and returned to your Void but it has to
[2:36:35] accomplish that with your purpose for it
[2:36:37] I plead your blood and I pray in the
[2:36:40] name of Jesus Christ May Lord such a
[2:36:43] power of transformation begin to happen
[2:36:45] in the hearts of your people father as
[2:36:48] you are building us up for a climax
[2:36:50] tomorrow I pray that you might have your
[2:36:52] way in our lives Bless the people
[2:36:54] mightily in the name of of Christ we
[2:36:57] thank you tonight we bless your name
[2:36:58] tonight Lord we celebrate the gift of
[2:37:01] Life you've given us and the greatest
[2:37:03] gift you've given us is our souls now we
[2:37:06] understand Lord that the Holy Ghost is a
