[24:48] brother branham said if you want to
[24:50] start
[24:51] he says start with the word
[25:01] when great elohim would come from
[25:04] being self-existing
[25:06] into a form he started with a word
[25:10] he condemns himself into a body called
[25:12] the word the logos
[25:15] that's the beginning of god
[25:18] and that's the beginning
[25:20] of everything
[25:22] [Music]
[25:26] brother branham said we read that on
[25:28] sunday if you want deity
[25:30] in your midst
[25:33] then welcome and receive the word
[25:40] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[25:43] between you and that word
[25:48] when we say i love you
[25:50] a moment like this i love you are you
[25:53] making love to the world
[25:55] are you embracing the promises of god

[26:48] want to acknowledge him we don't want
[26:51] psychology we don't want man's reasoning
[26:54] we don't want man's commentary

[26:58] the living word
[27:00] brother branham says when the man post
[27:02] that that word on his left
[27:04] he said it is the same as deity speaking
[27:08] that's why we want the word
[27:10] [Music]
[27:16] let's just pray tonight and ask the lord
[27:20] to impress our life with his word

[46:25] we may hear from you
[46:27] we are so grateful that we stand before
[46:29] you and you know us inside out
[46:32] there is nothing that is hidden before
[46:34] you father and we pray that you will
[46:36] touch every heart oh god may you touch
[46:39] every soul
[46:40] when we look at our lives father there
[46:42] is always something that makes us feel
[46:45] insufficient
[46:47] and you knew all about it before you
[46:49] even called us
[46:50] and father oh god we are in your hands
[46:53] and we are trusting that you will deal
[46:56] with us

[46:59] father we thank you so much oh god
[47:02] tonight
[47:03] we pray

[47:27] over tonight's service father and speak
[47:29] to your children from lip to ear that we
[47:32] shall not leave your presence the way we
[47:34] came in
[47:35] in jesus name
[47:36] amen
[47:38] shall we be seated musicians god bless
[47:41] you all
[47:42] good to see you brother ariel
[47:45] i wasn't expecting to see you tonight
[47:47] the praise be to god
[47:50] yes
[48:03] it's good to see everyone of you here
[48:05] tonight
[48:09] the life in america is very busy
[48:13] and until i came to america
[48:16] i never understood that
[48:19] uh what did they used to say
[48:23] um
[48:25] time time is precious the money
[48:28] i never understood that
[48:31] yeah there are people that will give you
[48:33] their money
[48:35] but it will be very difficult to give
[48:36] you their time
[48:38] and in the midst of the busy schedules
[48:41] the busy life
[48:43] if you can make time
[48:46] to come and seek the face of god
[48:48] it will be a blessing
[48:50] i know work is keeping some people away
[48:53] from service
[48:54] and we understand that god understands
[48:57] that
[48:58] and there are people that cannot be here
[48:59] tonight
[49:01] for a good reason
[49:03] so to speak
[49:04] and god knows all about that
[49:07] yes so for every empty seat you see
[49:10] it means that somebody is either tuning
[49:13] in watching online or something of the
[49:16] sort
[49:17] praise be to god
[49:19] yes so
[49:20] um just trusting god
[49:24] because as the days are getting to a
[49:26] head
[49:28] the devil would make sure he keeps us
[49:30] very busy
[49:32] and
[49:33] we just
[49:34] have to find time
[49:36] you have to
[49:37] we have to
[49:39] there are no excuses whatsoever we have
[49:42] to find time
[49:44] to serve god
[49:46] praise be to god
[49:49] just this morning
[49:51] around between 6 and 6 30
[49:55] i was standing with my supervisor
[49:58] and
[49:59] somebody just came
[50:01] he said donnelly
[50:03] it was a note
[50:05] i wrote it very very small very very
[50:07] very small letters
[50:09] and normally when something comes to me
[50:11] i write it down when i go to work i put
[50:12] it on the computer
[50:14] so i got to work on monday day something
[50:16] like that
[50:17] and i didn't know why i kept the paper
[50:20] so he comes with it donna lee donnelly
[50:23] i saw a paper in the office
[50:26] and it's written
[50:28] god is written on it
[50:29] and i thought
[50:31] it has to be yours
[50:33] and i said thank you
[50:35] it didn't mean anything much until 30
[50:38] minutes later
[50:41] and this is somebody that i have not had
[50:43] any conversations with
[50:46] the only conversation i ever had with
[50:47] him was he asking me probably a year ago
[50:51] that i hear you are a preacher then i
[50:52] said yes then i said oh i'm sorry
[50:56] uh all the cursing i've been casting
[50:58] around you i'm sorry forgive me
[51:01] and i saw you are forgiven then we all
[51:03] laughed about it
[51:05] but um and he said i will never do that
[51:08] no more i said good
[51:10] and it was just like
[51:12] making
[51:13] a new year resolution
[51:16] that you make the new year resolution in
[51:18] those days we used to do them
[51:20] before nine o'clock in the morning you
[51:22] have already broken every one of them
[51:26] i don't know about you
[51:28] but before nine on new year's day i
[51:30] broke every one of them
[51:32] praise be to god
[51:34] and he never kept it but at least
[51:36] you know just live your life in a way
[51:39] and let the people around you know who
[51:41] you are
[51:43] never try to be like somebody else
[51:46] never desire to be like somebody else
[51:49] know
[51:50] that you are special in the sight of god
[51:53] it doesn't matter what people say
[51:55] know that you are a son and a daughter
[51:58] of god and you are special in the sight
[52:01] of god
[52:02] praise be to god
[52:05] now
[52:06] when i was thinking of what to come and
[52:08] share tonight
[52:10] i had a lot of things sitting down
[52:14] and i was wondering
[52:16] on a wednesday night
[52:18] looking at our time
[52:21] and this came to me
[52:26] and it's one of those random things that
[52:28] just come and i put it down
[52:31] and tonight by the grace of god
[52:34] we'll be looking at this
[52:36] if we can just take our bibles and turn
[52:39] over to the book of romans romans 9
[52:43] romans 9.
[52:48] 20 21
[52:52] romans 9
[52:54] 20
[52:55] 21
[53:03] nay
[53:04] but o man
[53:06] who add thou
[53:08] that replies against god
[53:12] shall the teen formed say to him that
[53:15] formed it
[53:16] why has thou made me thus
[53:20] have not deported power
[53:23] over the clay
[53:25] of the same lamp
[53:28] to make one vessel
[53:31] onto anna
[53:32] and another unto this honor
[53:36] may the lord add his blessings to the
[53:38] reading of his
[53:41] amen
[53:43] shall we be seated
[53:58] now when you look at the scripture we
[53:59] have just read
[54:04] there is no unrighteousness with god
[54:11] from the scripture we have just read
[54:16] god being the potter
[54:20] could have decided
[54:22] i am going to make one vessel
[54:26] as a vessel of honor
[54:28] and another one as a vessel of this
[54:30] owner
[54:32] and that is the end of the story
[54:35] it doesn't matter what you do nothing
[54:37] would change it
[54:40] now man is a vessel
[54:44] so we are not talking of any other
[54:45] vessel we are just talking about man
[54:51] the title of my message tonight is
[54:54] broken vessels of honor
[54:57] broken vessels
[54:59] of honor
[55:03] now
[55:05] when you look at a vessel
[55:09] that is a vessel of honor
[55:12] why
[55:14] should that vessel be broken
[55:17] because we are talking about
[55:20] two vessels here
[55:22] one of honor
[55:24] the other of dishonor
[55:27] probably
[55:28] it may make a lot of sense to say
[55:32] broken vessels of this owner because
[55:34] they are dishonorable they should be
[55:36] broken
[55:37] because naturally the word broken
[55:40] when it's been attached to anything
[55:43] it doesn't give a good picture
[55:46] is either spoiling it or destroying it
[55:49] or something else
[55:53] but you talk of
[55:54] a broken vessel of honor
[55:58] a vessel that is honorable
[56:00] to be subject to that to be broken
[56:04] and you ask yourself why
[56:07] and the reason is simple
[56:10] the reason why
[56:12] a vessel of honor would be broken
[56:16] is because it's a vessel of honor
[56:20] that is why it must be broken
[56:25] and as simple as it is
[56:28] the reason why a vessel of this owner
[56:30] would not be broken
[56:32] it's just
[56:34] because
[56:35] that vessel is dishonorable
[56:42] now breaks
[56:45] and satan breaks
[56:52] so you don't have to worry
[56:55] when you are broken
[56:56] it depends on the house in which you are
[57:03] because god does not break to kill
[57:06] god does not break to destroy
[57:12] because the bible tells us
[57:15] in the book of jeremiah 29 i believe it
[57:17] is
[57:18] that i know
[57:21] that thought i have concerning you
[57:24] a story of good and not of evil
[57:27] to bring you to an expected end
[57:30] and for god so loved the world that he
[57:32] gave us his only begotten son
[57:36] i came that you may have life and have
[57:38] life more abundantly
[57:41] i am the way the truth and the life no
[57:43] matter the father except we can go on
[57:46] and on and on and on and on and we know
[57:49] that when god is breaking you
[57:53] he doesn't break to destroy
[57:58] it's like in those days
[58:01] here in america i don't get to see a lot
[58:03] of things
[58:05] especially in the hinterlands you'll
[58:08] find some of these you know herbalists
[58:11] that are helping people
[58:12] somebody is sick they go to the bush
[58:14] they just get some leaves put it
[58:15] together the people drink and they are
[58:17] okay
[58:20] and sometimes
[58:21] they bring a child
[58:24] a child with a broken limb
[58:28] and sometimes the parents bring this
[58:30] child when it is too late
[58:35] and the leg is healed or the hand is
[58:37] healed
[58:39] and the child is now comfortable
[58:42] in the position they are living in now
[58:45] even though they are not working right
[58:48] but they are comfortable that at least
[58:50] they are not feeling the pain anymore
[58:52] they have adjusted to walking up and
[58:54] down and they are okay with it
[58:58] but the father or the mother sits on the
[58:59] side
[59:01] and looks at the child and say no i will
[59:02] not allow this
[59:05] to go on
[59:06] i have to find help
[59:08] for this child
[59:10] because if they grow with it
[59:13] they will get to a point where it will
[59:15] be too late and nothing can be done
[59:17] about it and now they carry this child
[59:21] to this village herbalist
[59:24] and then he sits and he looks at this
[59:26] child
[59:27] and they are also parents
[59:30] they are human beings they have feelings
[59:33] and sometimes it's so difficult for them
[59:36] to to do it because when they the wound
[59:39] is already healed
[59:41] they have to break the bone all over
[59:44] in order to realign it
[59:46] and sometimes they sit and they put
[59:49] their hand on the leg and as the word is
[59:51] okay this is why it's misaligned
[59:54] and then the child is sitting down on
[59:56] the mother's lap
[59:57] and wondering what is going on what are
[1:00:00] they doing here
[1:00:03] and then the man just takes the leg
[1:00:06] breaks it
[1:00:08] and the child just yells
[1:00:11] and at this point
[1:00:13] this child will be wondering
[1:00:15] oh i didn't know mommy hates me this
[1:00:17] much
[1:00:18] why would mommy do this to me oh mommy
[1:00:20] is wicked
[1:00:21] who is this man here he has broken my
[1:00:24] leg
[1:00:25] what is it
[1:00:29] that pain
[1:00:30] is not meant to destroy
[1:00:33] it's meant
[1:00:35] to make that child better
[1:00:38] but at that point when they are going
[1:00:40] through that pain they wouldn't see it
[1:00:45] but when they are healed
[1:00:47] and they begin to walk right
[1:00:51] and life comes back to normal that is
[1:00:53] when they begin to appreciate it
[1:00:56] and that is how it is with god
[1:00:59] god does not break to destroy
[1:01:03] he doesn't break
[1:01:05] to kill
[1:01:07] we know as the bible says
[1:01:10] the devil has comfort to steal to kill
[1:01:12] and to destroy
[1:01:13] and when he is breaking he breaks to
[1:01:15] destroy
[1:01:17] if he is breaking he breaks to kill
[1:01:20] but not without god
[1:01:22] praise be to god
[1:01:25] we are talking about
[1:01:27] broken vessels
[1:01:30] of honor
[1:01:32] i was trying to print a lot of things at
[1:01:34] work
[1:01:35] and for some reason i couldn't just get
[1:01:37] through
[1:01:40] and i just took a few notes down
[1:01:44] and i'll just read them off here
[1:01:46] so bear with me
[1:01:50] now
[1:01:54] in the massage supernatural the
[1:01:56] supernatural
[1:01:58] the prophet said we realize that
[1:02:01] this is like experience sometimes we
[1:02:04] have to go through terrible chastening
[1:02:06] of the lord
[1:02:09] and
[1:02:10] i mean i was just writing with my pen i
[1:02:12] just put the dot um
[1:02:14] you can you can you can go and visit it
[1:02:16] to correct us
[1:02:22] to make us fruit-bearing christians
[1:02:27] and god would prune you
[1:02:30] he would cut certain things
[1:02:32] off and he will take sentence away
[1:02:39] in the message exhortation of divine
[1:02:41] healing
[1:02:43] mary brown said i have to admit it
[1:02:46] that sometimes our heavenly father
[1:02:49] testing us with sickness
[1:02:52] permitting satan to do it
[1:02:55] to try
[1:02:56] to bring us back
[1:02:59] if
[1:03:00] we were to go astray
[1:03:03] but it only is only for the good
[1:03:08] praise be to the lord
[1:03:10] it's only for the good
[1:03:13] so
[1:03:14] god will chasten you in triumphs
[1:03:18] and god would allow satan to also come
[1:03:21] in temptations
[1:03:24] and we know as the prophet has said
[1:03:27] satan is also awake man for god
[1:03:31] god uses him as a whip
[1:03:33] to put you in line
[1:03:35] and we can see satan
[1:03:38] in the life of job
[1:03:39] it wasn't because he did anything wrong
[1:03:42] or he was of course
[1:03:44] but we saw how
[1:03:46] god permitted him
[1:03:48] but when god does permit satan to come
[1:03:52] the boundaries are set
[1:03:54] because when he is coming
[1:03:57] he is coming with a destructive mind
[1:04:00] and god is not allowing him to come and
[1:04:04] destroy
[1:04:05] but there is something good
[1:04:07] god wants to bring out so god says the
[1:04:10] boundaries praise be to god
[1:04:15] the testing of our father is not
[1:04:17] pleasant
[1:04:18] for a season
[1:04:20] but it works together
[1:04:22] for good
[1:04:24] and it is not easy i don't know if i'm
[1:04:26] going ahead of myself that is fine
[1:04:29] when you are going through chastening
[1:04:32] it is
[1:04:36] a very difficult
[1:04:38] time in every every christian life
[1:04:41] and i believe
[1:04:43] some of us can attest to that
[1:04:50] in the message the efficient church age
[1:04:55] no matter how just and upright a
[1:04:57] christian is before the public
[1:05:00] and how gracious
[1:05:02] he is to his fellow man
[1:05:05] doing not but good
[1:05:07] let him confess christ
[1:05:10] as his savior and acknowledge the
[1:05:11] oppression of the gifts of the holy
[1:05:13] spirit in tongues prophecy healing and
[1:05:16] miracles and he will be condemned
[1:05:20] the spirit of this world has the spirit
[1:05:22] of god
[1:05:24] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[1:05:26] of the lord it tries to destroy the
[1:05:28] vessel in whom
[1:05:30] the spirit of truth dwells
[1:05:34] persecution and trials are natural
[1:05:39] normal part of christian life
[1:05:42] this is only one thing you can do about
[1:05:46] them commit them
[1:05:48] all to god judge not
[1:05:51] and leave their outworking
[1:05:53] and final judgment to god
[1:05:57] persecution
[1:05:58] brother branham is saying is a normal
[1:06:02] part of christian life how many of us
[1:06:04] are ready for that
[1:06:07] praise be to god
[1:06:10] it is not going out there
[1:06:13] and looking for trouble
[1:06:15] no
[1:06:17] the trouble will find you anyhow
[1:06:20] but what it does come
[1:06:23] are you ready for it
[1:06:26] a lot of the times
[1:06:28] when we are going through trials and
[1:06:30] temptations we dishonor god
[1:06:34] we fail to see the hand god is pulling
[1:06:37] the strength
[1:06:39] and we complain
[1:06:41] we murmur
[1:06:43] we say things we shouldn't say we do
[1:06:45] things we shouldn't do
[1:06:49] and we let god down
[1:06:53] broken vessels
[1:06:57] of honor
[1:07:01] there is honor in royalty
[1:07:05] when you look at
[1:07:07] the queen of england
[1:07:09] the king of wales
[1:07:11] and in any in every country why they
[1:07:14] still have this monarchy
[1:07:16] you see
[1:07:17] that
[1:07:18] there is
[1:07:20] honor
[1:07:21] in royalty
[1:07:24] the kings
[1:07:26] even right down to the village chiefs
[1:07:29] sometimes you go to a place and there
[1:07:30] are only 10 15 buildings
[1:07:32] and you go there you want to go and cut
[1:07:34] trees and hotel you have to see the
[1:07:35] chief
[1:07:38] and not just the chief
[1:07:40] but you see their children parading in
[1:07:42] the street
[1:07:43] and people say oh that is the king's son
[1:07:45] that's the king's daughter that's the
[1:07:46] prince that's the princess
[1:07:48] there is honor
[1:07:51] attached to it
[1:07:52] i know in america here
[1:07:55] the system is different
[1:07:59] but we can look at the president
[1:08:02] there is honor
[1:08:04] in being the president of this country
[1:08:08] it's an honorable position
[1:08:12] but there is no honor that is bestowed
[1:08:14] on man
[1:08:16] that is greater
[1:08:18] than being a child of god
[1:08:20] you being a son or a daughter of god
[1:08:25] there is more honor in that than being
[1:08:28] the president of this country
[1:08:30] there is more honor in that
[1:08:33] than being the king of wales
[1:08:36] there is honor
[1:08:39] honor
[1:08:40] in being a child of god
[1:08:43] just know who you are
[1:08:45] and appreciate what god is doing
[1:08:52] a lot of the times we don't see what god
[1:08:54] is doing in our personal lives
[1:08:58] because we are carried away
[1:09:00] by the things that are happening around
[1:09:04] here is on social media
[1:09:06] in the community at work we got carried
[1:09:08] away
[1:09:11] and we forget
[1:09:12] who we are and what god is doing
[1:09:16] there is honor
[1:09:19] in being a child of god
[1:09:22] and we are honorable children of god
[1:09:27] we are not here tonight to talk about
[1:09:30] verses of dishonor
[1:09:32] no
[1:09:33] we are here to talk about vessels of
[1:09:36] honor
[1:09:37] to talk about ourselves
[1:09:39] as children of god
[1:09:42] our sons and daughters of god that is
[1:09:45] what we are here to talk about tonight
[1:09:48] vessels of honor
[1:09:52] and don't forget we are talking about
[1:09:54] broken vessels
[1:09:55] of honor
[1:09:57] now
[1:09:58] when you look at the earth
[1:10:01] or the land
[1:10:04] for the land to be useful
[1:10:07] the land must be crushed
[1:10:13] until that piece of land is crushed it's
[1:10:16] of no use to the farmer
[1:10:18] because there are trees and there are
[1:10:20] grasses everywhere the farmer will now
[1:10:22] go and throw his seed on the ground
[1:10:26] he would go
[1:10:27] cut down the trees
[1:10:30] plough it put implements through the
[1:10:31] through the soil
[1:10:33] turn it upside down
[1:10:36] level it and what have you
[1:10:41] so for the land to live to its full
[1:10:44] potential
[1:10:46] the land has to die to itself
[1:10:49] he said the land two dies yes
[1:10:52] the land two dies
[1:10:56] year in year out as you cultivate the
[1:10:59] piece of land
[1:11:00] the land is dying
[1:11:03] and that i know it by example i did i
[1:11:05] don't i didn't learn that from school
[1:11:08] because you guys know i love farming
[1:11:11] after some time the land begins to lose
[1:11:13] its nutrients
[1:11:16] and you have to leave that land to
[1:11:17] follow
[1:11:18] for some years
[1:11:20] so you can come back to it
[1:11:22] so it tells you that the land is dying
[1:11:27] so for that land
[1:11:29] to be able to yield its full potential
[1:11:34] the land must die to itself
[1:11:36] and that is when it becomes useful to
[1:11:39] the farmer
[1:11:41] until then
[1:11:43] the land is only living for itself
[1:11:48] if you ever knew that piece of land
[1:11:50] before
[1:11:52] and you came back to it
[1:11:55] you would realize
[1:11:57] that there is a nature change
[1:12:02] that the land is no longer the land you
[1:12:04] used to know
[1:12:07] you will realize that all the trees are
[1:12:08] gone
[1:12:10] and the land has been turned upside down
[1:12:15] the nature has changed
[1:12:18] it's ready
[1:12:21] to yield its potential this time
[1:12:25] it's also like a grain of which
[1:12:29] for a grain of wheat
[1:12:32] to become useful
[1:12:34] and to support life
[1:12:36] it must be crushed
[1:12:43] it must be crushed
[1:12:46] until then
[1:12:47] it is living for itself
[1:12:51] they would have to carry it to the mill
[1:12:54] grind it
[1:12:55] sifter it grind it over
[1:13:00] and when they are done that is not the
[1:13:01] end
[1:13:03] either they are going to cook it or fry
[1:13:05] it
[1:13:07] or put it through the oven 375 degrees
[1:13:11] it must die to itself
[1:13:14] in order to be able
[1:13:16] to give life to others
[1:13:19] in order to be able to yield its full
[1:13:22] potential it must be crushed
[1:13:29] and for the bull or the cow
[1:13:32] to be able to give life
[1:13:36] you go to the farm and you see a very
[1:13:38] big cow in its majestic colors with his
[1:13:41] hunch back
[1:13:42] just walking on the field
[1:13:44] if you were the farmer
[1:13:46] you will stop to death
[1:13:49] the only way
[1:13:53] that cow be that's useful to you
[1:13:56] is when that cow is crushed
[1:14:00] now when you come back
[1:14:02] all you see you don't see a cow anymore
[1:14:06] all you see is a bloody pile of mess
[1:14:10] yes
[1:14:11] there is a nature change
[1:14:16] now you go to the dining room
[1:14:18] on the dinner table
[1:14:20] and there is food
[1:14:22] there is a steak
[1:14:24] but a cow had to die
[1:14:26] to produce that stake
[1:14:30] praise be to god
[1:14:33] broken vessels
[1:14:35] of honor
[1:14:39] and anything that is crushed
[1:14:45] or anything that dies to itself
[1:14:49] you would never see
[1:14:53] is
[1:14:54] a its origin
[1:14:57] because it has died to its natural self
[1:15:02] it is now a new creation
[1:15:06] if you knew it before
[1:15:09] and you are now looking at it
[1:15:12] you see a complete picture
[1:15:18] and for man to be useful in the hands of
[1:15:20] god
[1:15:22] man must be crushed
[1:15:25] and we are not just talking about man
[1:15:27] per se
[1:15:28] we are talking about children of god
[1:15:33] for you to be useful in the hands of god
[1:15:36] you must be crushed
[1:15:40] you must die to yourself
[1:15:42] but in your original sinful state
[1:15:47] you are of no use to god
[1:15:49] it doesn't mean you are not a child of
[1:15:51] god
[1:15:53] you are a child of god all right
[1:15:58] but
[1:16:01] you are not yet useful in the hands of
[1:16:03] god
[1:16:06] you have to die
[1:16:08] to your old nature
[1:16:13] in order
[1:16:16] for the holy ghost
[1:16:18] to take over
[1:16:20] and begin to live through you
[1:16:28] the lord jesus said if any man comes
[1:16:30] after me
[1:16:32] let him deny himself
[1:16:36] take up his cross
[1:16:37] daily
[1:16:39] and follow me
[1:16:46] and you don't get to choose your cross
[1:16:54] deny yourself there are tales we ought
[1:16:56] to deny ourselves from
[1:16:59] every day we live there are things we
[1:17:01] ought to deny ourselves of
[1:17:06] and daily you take up your cross
[1:17:16] and the cross
[1:17:18] is the sound of persecution
[1:17:23] shame reproach
[1:17:26] you bear it
[1:17:29] there is a cross for every one of us
[1:17:35] if you are not carrying your cross
[1:17:37] you better look for
[1:17:39] look look at where you left it
[1:17:41] but there is a cross for every one of us
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:51] you think christ
[1:17:55] was the only one to go through
[1:17:57] what he went through no
[1:18:00] every one of us
[1:18:02] has a cross to carry
[1:18:05] there is persecution
[1:18:07] that we all
[1:18:09] must go through
[1:18:11] in one way or the other
[1:18:14] we are going to be broken
[1:18:16] but it is not because god wants to
[1:18:18] destroy us
[1:18:20] but there is something in the inside god
[1:18:22] wants to bring out
[1:18:24] and that thing can only come out
[1:18:29] when god harms you down
[1:18:32] breaks you here and there in order to be
[1:18:35] able to get to that thing
[1:18:38] and it doesn't come
[1:18:40] easily
[1:18:45] praise be to god amen
[1:18:49] behold
[1:18:51] before that i want us can we turn to
[1:18:53] hebrews 12
[1:18:56] hebrews 12
[1:18:59] hebrews 12 5-11
[1:19:05] hebrews 12
[1:19:07] 5
[1:19:09] and ye have forgotten the exaltation
[1:19:11] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:19:14] my son
[1:19:16] despise not doubt the chastening of the
[1:19:18] lord
[1:19:19] nor faint went thou art rebuked of him
[1:19:24] for whom the lord loveth
[1:19:27] that he chasteneth
[1:19:29] and scourgeth
[1:19:31] every son
[1:19:33] whom
[1:19:33] he receiveth
[1:19:35] every son
[1:19:36] whom he receiveth for that matter every
[1:19:39] daughter whom he receiveth
[1:19:42] if ye end your chest in him
[1:19:44] god delivered you as with sons
[1:19:48] for what son is he
[1:19:50] whom the father chestness not
[1:19:53] but if ye be without chastisement
[1:19:57] whereof
[1:19:58] all are partakers
[1:20:01] then
[1:20:02] are you bastards and not sons
[1:20:06] furthermore
[1:20:08] we have had fathers of our flesh
[1:20:11] which corrected us
[1:20:13] and gave
[1:20:15] and gave them reverence
[1:20:19] and we gave them reference
[1:20:21] shall we not much rather be in
[1:20:24] subjection
[1:20:26] unto the father of spirits and leave
[1:20:30] praise be to god for
[1:20:32] they verily for a few days
[1:20:35] trusting us
[1:20:36] after their own pleasure
[1:20:40] but he
[1:20:41] for our prophet
[1:20:43] that we might be partakers of his
[1:20:46] holiness
[1:20:47] praise be to god
[1:20:50] now no chastening for the present simmer
[1:20:53] to be joyous
[1:20:54] but grievous
[1:20:56] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:20:59] peaceable fruit
[1:21:01] of righteousness unto them which are
[1:21:04] exercised thereby
[1:21:08] yes
[1:21:10] our parents oh now we are also parents
[1:21:14] sometimes
[1:21:16] we're chasing the children
[1:21:18] after our own pleasure
[1:21:22] and sometimes in those days i'll tell
[1:21:24] you i'll not pay your school fees
[1:21:29] you are you you are going to starve to
[1:21:30] death
[1:21:32] you are not coming home
[1:21:35] just after our own pleasure
[1:21:38] praise the lord
[1:21:41] but god when he is doing it
[1:21:44] is for our prophet
[1:21:50] and the bible has made it clear
[1:21:53] no chastening for the present time is
[1:21:55] joyous
[1:21:57] you would cry
[1:21:59] you would will you have sleepless nights
[1:22:02] you'll go through torture
[1:22:04] but it is all in the design of god
[1:22:09] praise be to god
[1:22:12] it's all in the design of god
[1:22:16] and behold
[1:22:18] i send you a sheep in the midst of
[1:22:20] wolves
[1:22:24] be therefore wise as serpents and
[1:22:26] harmless as doves
[1:22:29] what do wolves do to sheep
[1:22:34] they tear them apart
[1:22:36] they eat them
[1:22:39] so right away
[1:22:41] you know what you are getting into
[1:22:44] going were those days where they used to
[1:22:45] preach as this prosperity gospel
[1:22:48] and make you think that i mean
[1:22:51] a christian the life has to be rosy
[1:22:55] you don't have to encounter any problems
[1:22:58] you don't have to encounter any
[1:22:59] difficulties
[1:23:02] life has to be good every day
[1:23:05] you have to get everything you want
[1:23:07] everything you need
[1:23:09] everybody has to be a friend
[1:23:11] anywhere you go the door should be open
[1:23:13] for you
[1:23:15] and with that mindset
[1:23:18] people get into trouble
[1:23:20] and immediately they want to quit
[1:23:24] because that is not what they have been
[1:23:25] told
[1:23:27] but don't be deceived
[1:23:30] that is not the way
[1:23:36] god would chasten
[1:23:39] every son
[1:23:41] and every daughter
[1:23:43] that comes to him
[1:23:47] and the bible has made it clear
[1:23:51] if you are not going through any
[1:23:52] testimony you are a bastard
[1:23:55] but we are not bastards
[1:23:57] we have a father
[1:23:59] praise be to god
[1:24:01] and we have to endure
[1:24:03] whatever it is
[1:24:05] that comes our way
[1:24:08] eternal life as a prophet says is living
[1:24:11] for others
[1:24:16] and you can't even be a christian
[1:24:18] until you begin to live for others
[1:24:23] we are so selfish sometimes
[1:24:26] that even in our prayer lives
[1:24:30] we don't even remember others
[1:24:35] it's just we we me me me me me
[1:24:43] christianity
[1:24:47] living for others
[1:24:50] and there is no way you can live for
[1:24:52] others
[1:24:53] until you are truly dead to yourself
[1:24:58] that is when you actually begin to live
[1:24:59] for others
[1:25:00] but until then life is all about you
[1:25:08] if you are not in the picture
[1:25:10] then it's not worth it
[1:25:15] it becomes difficult
[1:25:17] putting somebody else
[1:25:23] ahead of
[1:25:24] you because life is just all about you
[1:25:31] a life that is not worth
[1:25:35] being disturbed
[1:25:38] it's not worth living for
[1:25:45] i lived in a mining area for a while
[1:25:51] and you see two pieces of land line
[1:25:54] adjacent each other
[1:25:57] and there is one that people don't
[1:25:59] disturb at all
[1:26:02] but there is this one here
[1:26:06] people go there with their excavators
[1:26:09] and they excavate the land they are
[1:26:11] pushing down the trees
[1:26:15] getting down to the rocks
[1:26:17] digging holes like foxes
[1:26:20] why
[1:26:21] because that piece of land is rich
[1:26:27] that piece of land hardly
[1:26:31] groceries
[1:26:33] because the people will not allow it to
[1:26:35] even grow trees
[1:26:37] why because that land is rich with
[1:26:40] minerals
[1:26:43] but there is this other one here nobody
[1:26:46] even bothers it
[1:26:51] and they come
[1:26:52] they excavate the land they get to the
[1:26:55] roots
[1:26:56] they gather the rocks
[1:26:58] out
[1:26:59] and they grind it
[1:27:02] with machines into powder
[1:27:06] and then they go through the process
[1:27:08] just to extract the gold out of it
[1:27:14] because of the wealth
[1:27:19] hiding in that piece of land it attracts
[1:27:22] attention
[1:27:27] now people are going to torture it
[1:27:30] they are going to persecute it
[1:27:34] why
[1:27:35] because
[1:27:36] it is holding a mystery
[1:27:40] the land itself doesn't know what it is
[1:27:43] holding
[1:27:45] and that is the same way with our lives
[1:27:48] sometimes we do not even know who we are
[1:27:51] sometimes we don't even know what we are
[1:27:53] worth
[1:27:55] sometimes we think we are like any other
[1:27:57] person
[1:28:00] but the devil looking at us knows who we
[1:28:03] are
[1:28:04] sometimes more than we do
[1:28:08] and you wonder why
[1:28:09] the devil would not let you rest
[1:28:12] it's because you are holding a mystery
[1:28:15] in your life
[1:28:17] the devil looks at you and he sees
[1:28:20] something you are not seeing
[1:28:24] because the gold the the gold miners
[1:28:27] when they come with their instruments
[1:28:29] their prospect and they can tell you how
[1:28:31] rich the land is
[1:28:36] and they will do anything
[1:28:39] to get to the roots of it
[1:28:43] they will do anything
[1:28:45] why
[1:28:47] because
[1:28:48] there is a wealth
[1:28:51] sitting
[1:28:52] in the heart of that land
[1:28:55] they must get to it
[1:28:59] if the devil is not tormenting you you
[1:29:00] should be disturbed about it
[1:29:03] you should be worried
[1:29:06] you should be worried
[1:29:08] if the devil is not
[1:29:10] if you have not attracted the devil's
[1:29:13] attention
[1:29:15] if the devil is okay with you you should
[1:29:18] be worried
[1:29:24] but you should bless the name of the
[1:29:25] lord
[1:29:27] if all hell
[1:29:29] is turned loose against you
[1:29:33] it shows that something good is
[1:29:35] happening inside there
[1:29:38] for you to attract
[1:29:41] the devil's attention
[1:29:44] and for the devil to come against you
[1:29:47] it shows how much you are blessed
[1:29:50] it shows how much something good in your
[1:29:53] life is happening
[1:30:02] we are here to serve one purpose
[1:30:07] is good to work
[1:30:09] as we have always said is good to go to
[1:30:12] school
[1:30:14] it is good to do anything you want to do
[1:30:16] if the word of god does not stop you
[1:30:19] that is okay go ahead and do it
[1:30:23] but when it comes to your christian
[1:30:25] faith
[1:30:26] never compromise
[1:30:28] never
[1:30:30] there should be nothing in this life
[1:30:33] that should let you compromise on your
[1:30:35] faith
[1:30:38] all the degrees we get
[1:30:41] one day
[1:30:43] we will leave them hanging on the walls
[1:30:45] and will be gone
[1:30:47] they are not going to speak for us
[1:30:51] all the money we wait for
[1:30:53] one day
[1:30:54] if we still have them in the banks
[1:30:57] we are going to leave them and go
[1:31:00] the money
[1:31:02] would not help you out
[1:31:07] i like something steve jobs said
[1:31:11] before he died
[1:31:13] he was a billionaire
[1:31:15] very rich
[1:31:17] but he said
[1:31:19] whether in his sick bed on his dying bed
[1:31:22] he said
[1:31:24] that if it is money he has the money
[1:31:26] but the money cannot save him
[1:31:34] conditions are going to get harder
[1:31:36] they are not going to get any better
[1:31:39] so if you think that over time
[1:31:43] it's going to help it's not going to get
[1:31:45] worse
[1:31:47] because what is going to happen
[1:31:49] that eventually
[1:31:51] you are going to be distracted
[1:31:54] and you will spend more time
[1:31:56] working more time making the money you
[1:31:59] don't even see
[1:32:01] to pay the bills
[1:32:03] and you never catch up with it
[1:32:06] you never catch up
[1:32:07] i don't catch up with my bills
[1:32:10] so i don't worry about them
[1:32:13] they compile
[1:32:16] if they are not tired piling up that is
[1:32:18] fine
[1:32:22] because the harder i try
[1:32:25] the more i fail
[1:32:28] so
[1:32:29] i just do my best
[1:32:34] i will not overwhelm myself
[1:32:37] because
[1:32:38] i want to catch up no
[1:32:41] i will not use time i should use for god
[1:32:44] to go to work
[1:32:45] when i can come to the house of god i
[1:32:47] will not do it
[1:32:50] there is not not enough money you can
[1:32:52] pay me
[1:32:54] to come to work on a sunday
[1:32:58] it's not worth it
[1:33:01] all the things we are struggling for in
[1:33:03] this life
[1:33:07] we are not carrying them anywhere
[1:33:12] to sum it all up
[1:33:14] it's a waste of time
[1:33:18] does it mean we shouldn't work no
[1:33:21] the bible says if you don't work you
[1:33:22] shouldn't eat
[1:33:24] so if you want to stop don't work
[1:33:27] so the work will do it
[1:33:29] but we will not allow the devil to
[1:33:32] exploit us
[1:33:38] every time the doors are open and we
[1:33:40] ought to be here we'll be here by the
[1:33:42] grace of god
[1:33:44] do not let anything stop you
[1:33:54] just know it because
[1:33:57] this life
[1:34:00] if you take god out of the equation
[1:34:03] everything else is useless
[1:34:07] can you imagine
[1:34:10] living a life without christ
[1:34:15] we have all been there once upon a time
[1:34:19] but in those days you didn't even
[1:34:21] realize it
[1:34:23] but now that you are seated in christ
[1:34:27] god forbid if the world should ever
[1:34:30] happen and you find yourself back in
[1:34:33] that condition
[1:34:35] that darkness is very gross
[1:34:38] that condition is very terrible
[1:34:41] when you take god out of the life of a
[1:34:44] man he is left with nothing
[1:34:49] pity those people out there
[1:34:52] pray for them
[1:34:54] you look at them you think they are
[1:34:55] enjoying life they are not enjoying life
[1:35:00] it's better to die
[1:35:02] penniless
[1:35:05] than to have all the wealth of this
[1:35:07] world and die without god
[1:35:15] praise beauty god
[1:35:19] jeremiah 23
[1:35:21] jeremiah 23 29
[1:35:32] jeremiah 23
[1:35:36] 29
[1:35:41] it is not my way
[1:35:42] it's not my word like
[1:35:45] as a fire
[1:35:47] say of the lord
[1:35:50] and like a hammer
[1:35:53] that breaketh the rock in pieces
[1:36:01] and that is the word we have believed
[1:36:05] jeremiah is saying that the word of god
[1:36:07] is like hammer
[1:36:09] it breaks the rock into pieces
[1:36:15] broken vessels of honor
[1:36:19] you accept christ as your lord and
[1:36:21] personal savior
[1:36:24] the whole of hell is turn loose against
[1:36:26] you
[1:36:30] and we also know
[1:36:31] that when the whole of hell is turn
[1:36:33] loose against you the whole of heaven is
[1:36:34] behind you
[1:36:37] but there are things that god will allow
[1:36:38] you to go through
[1:36:40] god himself will chasten you
[1:36:43] and he will also give the devil chance
[1:36:46] to come and afflict you
[1:36:50] all because
[1:36:53] there is something good in you
[1:36:56] as a daughter of god
[1:36:58] all because there is something good in
[1:37:00] you as a son of god and that pain must
[1:37:03] come forth
[1:37:05] and except
[1:37:06] you are broken down and
[1:37:10] that that thing is never coming out you
[1:37:12] must be broken down
[1:37:15] the flesh must give way
[1:37:24] and when you are going through those
[1:37:26] trying moments
[1:37:29] all you can do
[1:37:31] as the prophet of god said just praise
[1:37:35] god
[1:37:36] ask god to help you
[1:37:41] a lot of the times
[1:37:43] we see the storms
[1:37:44] we don't know where they are coming from
[1:37:48] there is a hand behind
[1:37:50] that is pulling the strings
[1:37:54] if you are not careful
[1:37:56] by the way you react
[1:37:59] you can dishonor god
[1:38:02] and it is meant for your own good
[1:38:06] there is nothing that god would do
[1:38:09] just because god wants to inflict pain
[1:38:11] on you that is not the god we are
[1:38:13] serving
[1:38:17] oh say yeah it's painful it's painful
[1:38:20] i'm dying yes
[1:38:22] it may be painful you may be dying
[1:38:24] but it is not meant to kill you
[1:38:31] there is something in you
[1:38:34] god is bringing out
[1:38:37] and god will bring it out anyhow
[1:38:40] praise be to god
[1:38:42] the bible says jesus led obedience by
[1:38:44] the things he suffered
[1:38:46] and the obedience here is character
[1:38:48] and we saw what he went through
[1:38:53] he being the son of god was not left out
[1:38:56] he been the word made flesh did not live
[1:38:59] above the flesh did not leave did not
[1:39:01] live about above the world
[1:39:04] he being the word made flesh did not
[1:39:06] live above the word
[1:39:09] he was
[1:39:10] obedient even unto death
[1:39:16] he learned obedience
[1:39:18] by the things he suffered
[1:39:21] praise be to god
[1:39:23] we know what he went through how he was
[1:39:26] afflicted
[1:39:28] bruised
[1:39:30] scarred all over
[1:39:34] finally hung on the cross
[1:39:37] for our sake
[1:39:42] and a man who came to introduce him john
[1:39:44] the baptist
[1:39:46] how did he go
[1:39:49] he was beheaded
[1:39:58] and when you read
[1:40:02] all through the ages
[1:40:04] especially in the dark ages
[1:40:07] the believers
[1:40:08] what happened to them
[1:40:10] and it was all
[1:40:12] for the love of god
[1:40:16] you think god was asleep
[1:40:21] but it pleased god
[1:40:27] for them to go through what they went
[1:40:28] through
[1:40:34] job
[1:40:36] job lent obedience
[1:40:39] character
[1:40:42] job when he was going through his
[1:40:43] affliction
[1:40:47] he got to a point
[1:40:49] he said naked i came from a mother's
[1:40:51] womb and naked i will retain heater
[1:40:55] and the prophet of god brother branham
[1:40:57] said naked we came but we are going back
[1:40:59] with character
[1:41:01] praise be to god
[1:41:03] now job learned character he did
[1:41:10] just look at job a prophet of god
[1:41:14] a prophet of god
[1:41:18] when job made that statement
[1:41:22] he had not yet gotten
[1:41:24] that revelation
[1:41:28] it was just a natural man
[1:41:31] even though a prophet of god
[1:41:34] with his natural mind
[1:41:38] in a natural setting
[1:41:41] if you listen to his conversation
[1:41:44] because job sees
[1:41:46] the grass they just grow
[1:41:49] they die
[1:41:50] and when the rest begin these grasses
[1:41:52] grow off again
[1:41:54] he sees the trees
[1:41:56] they die
[1:41:57] they shed their leaves
[1:41:59] when the seasons change here they come
[1:42:01] again you cut out a tree it will burn on
[1:42:04] the side
[1:42:05] and then he would ask himself
[1:42:07] but
[1:42:08] how about man
[1:42:10] when a man dies
[1:42:12] where does he go
[1:42:14] how about man
[1:42:16] i know about the trees i know about the
[1:42:18] grasses but how about man
[1:42:20] it was just a man in his natural
[1:42:23] environment
[1:42:25] with his natural mind trying to peace
[1:42:28] out trying to figure out something
[1:42:32] and when you look at it from that point
[1:42:34] on
[1:42:35] till when he had his trial
[1:42:38] he was still the same man nothing had
[1:42:40] changed yet
[1:42:44] but when
[1:42:45] he was going through those trials
[1:42:49] in one day you know the story
[1:42:53] all that happened
[1:42:55] losing his
[1:42:56] some of his house man losing his animals
[1:42:59] losing his children
[1:43:01] everything
[1:43:02] what did he say naked i came and naked i
[1:43:05] would go praise be to god anyhow
[1:43:08] he did not let god down
[1:43:11] and when the devil came back again and
[1:43:14] afflicted him this time with boils
[1:43:16] painful boils
[1:43:18] till this man didn't even know what to
[1:43:20] do anymore
[1:43:22] he was
[1:43:23] just down and completely out
[1:43:25] and yet he will not cast god
[1:43:28] tell his wife
[1:43:30] the only person that was supposed to be
[1:43:32] encouraging him
[1:43:34] said why don't you curse your god and
[1:43:35] die he said don't speak to one of those
[1:43:37] foolish women
[1:43:39] tell me what is this this was character
[1:43:42] at his best
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:44] character at this at his best
[1:43:48] praise be to god
[1:43:49] and when he had pleased god and god just
[1:43:53] opened the curtain a little praise be to
[1:43:55] god shall we just read let me see
[1:43:59] job
[1:44:00] let's go to the book of job
[1:44:04] job
[1:44:04] 19 job 19
[1:44:08] 25
[1:44:11] job 19 25
[1:44:15] yes
[1:44:16] for i know that my redeemer lives
[1:44:19] and that he shall stand at the latter
[1:44:21] day upon
[1:44:22] at a later day upon the earth
[1:44:25] and do after my skin worms
[1:44:28] destroy this body
[1:44:30] yet in my flesh
[1:44:32] shall i see god whom i shall see for
[1:44:35] myself and my eyes shall behold him and
[1:44:39] not another do my reigns be consumed
[1:44:43] within me
[1:44:44] but
[1:44:45] ye
[1:44:48] should say
[1:44:50] oh
[1:44:51] okay i act 27 i'm good with 27
[1:44:56] whom i shall see with my eyes
[1:45:00] praise be to god
[1:45:01] and not another do my reigns be consumed
[1:45:04] within me praise be to god
[1:45:08] at this point
[1:45:11] job
[1:45:13] the job you knew before the trial
[1:45:16] was different
[1:45:18] after
[1:45:20] this revelation
[1:45:22] he was not he was no longer trying to
[1:45:25] imagine
[1:45:27] trying to think
[1:45:29] but he now knows for sure
[1:45:32] what happens
[1:45:33] when a man
[1:45:34] dies
[1:45:35] praise be to god
[1:45:39] and brother comes and he says
[1:45:42] that we shall go back with character yes
[1:45:45] we are going back with character
[1:45:50] when you look at job that was character
[1:45:52] at its best
[1:45:54] and there is that trying moment
[1:45:56] for every one of us
[1:45:59] job didn't do anything wrong
[1:46:02] the reason why he went through what he
[1:46:04] went through was because god had so much
[1:46:06] confidence in him
[1:46:10] because he was living right
[1:46:12] because he was doing the right things
[1:46:15] because he was standing for god
[1:46:18] because he had declared his position
[1:46:21] because he had made himself known
[1:46:24] and when you have taken your position
[1:46:26] with god
[1:46:28] when you have taken a stand
[1:46:30] with the lord's despised few
[1:46:33] when you have decided
[1:46:35] to walk with christ
[1:46:38] and no longer to go back into the world
[1:46:42] you are going to go through trials
[1:46:45] you are going to go through temptations
[1:46:48] life is not going to be easy
[1:46:51] life is not going to be rosy
[1:46:53] your cross may be different from mine
[1:46:55] they don't have to be the same
[1:46:58] but everybody has a cross to carry
[1:47:01] everybody is going through one
[1:47:02] persecution or the other
[1:47:04] whichever way it comes is a persecution
[1:47:07] anyhow
[1:47:10] god is the one who decides
[1:47:12] what to bring your way
[1:47:15] you don't call for it
[1:47:18] and he doesn't bring it when you're
[1:47:19] expecting it
[1:47:21] he doesn't come and ask your opinion or
[1:47:24] your permission no
[1:47:26] that is why you just have to stay
[1:47:28] consecrated every single moment
[1:47:32] keep pushing on
[1:47:33] whether rain or shine just know whatever
[1:47:37] it is that you're going through also
[1:47:39] remember that there are believers all
[1:47:41] over the world that are going through
[1:47:43] the same thing
[1:47:45] some are even going through westerns
[1:47:48] and if they are standing
[1:47:50] it shows that you can also stand
[1:47:53] praise beauty god on that day when we
[1:47:56] all meet together and everybody is
[1:47:57] telling their stories you also have a
[1:47:59] story to share
[1:48:02] praise be to god
[1:48:05] broken vessels
[1:48:07] of honor
[1:48:08] because we are children of god
[1:48:11] we are honorable children
[1:48:14] and because we are honorable children of
[1:48:16] god
[1:48:17] god is going to break us anyhow
[1:48:20] but the intention is not to kill the
[1:48:24] intention is not to destroy
[1:48:26] the intention
[1:48:28] is to bring the best out of you
[1:48:32] so whatever it is
[1:48:34] that you may be going through it may be
[1:48:36] on the job
[1:48:39] that will promote everybody
[1:48:42] people you train on the
[1:48:44] job don't promote them
[1:48:47] and every time
[1:48:49] you are still at the same place
[1:48:51] when the year ends
[1:48:54] you don't even get a quarter of the
[1:48:55] bonus they get
[1:48:58] they got all the race
[1:49:02] but somebody is sitting on yours
[1:49:06] it might be in a form of sickness
[1:49:10] now god would allow
[1:49:12] it just for your own good
[1:49:17] it can be anything it can be anything
[1:49:21] yes
[1:49:23] but whatever it is that you are going
[1:49:25] through
[1:49:26] always remember that you are a child of
[1:49:29] god
[1:49:30] and that the reason why you are going
[1:49:32] through that
[1:49:33] is because you are a child of god
[1:49:40] and you can get to that place
[1:49:43] to stay with paul for me to leave is
[1:49:45] christ
[1:49:46] and to die
[1:49:48] is gain
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:52] i have just one thing here our time is
[1:49:55] i didn't have much to share
[1:49:58] i just wanted to make gurus of the time
[1:50:03] and
[1:50:06] praise be to god
[1:50:23] yes
[1:50:26] so the love of god
[1:50:30] the love of god
[1:50:33] would take you through anything
[1:50:37] there are storms
[1:50:40] that god will say this time i'm not
[1:50:42] taking over the storm
[1:50:45] this time i am not taking you beneath
[1:50:47] the storm
[1:50:48] you are going to go through the mail
[1:50:52] and then you stand and you look inside
[1:50:54] there
[1:50:55] and you know
[1:50:56] that to go in there is starting by death
[1:51:00] and god is going to take you through
[1:51:02] that meal
[1:51:03] and then you are going to come out on
[1:51:04] the other side hole
[1:51:06] and at that point
[1:51:08] life
[1:51:09] makes a lot more sense to you than it
[1:51:12] has ever been
[1:51:13] and you know that it is not your effort
[1:51:17] you know that this is the hand of god
[1:51:19] and you know that if it hadn't been for
[1:51:21] god
[1:51:22] there is no way
[1:51:24] this can happen because there is no way
[1:51:26] of explaining it
[1:51:28] there is no way of explaining it
[1:51:33] and if you have to die in those moments
[1:51:36] the bible says
[1:51:38] that the death of his sins
[1:51:41] is precious in his sight
[1:51:44] if you die believing you have not lost
[1:51:47] anything
[1:51:49] you have not lost anything
[1:51:52] if you die a believer you have not lost
[1:51:55] anything
[1:51:56] if you die a child of god standing on
[1:51:59] the word of god standing on the promises
[1:52:01] of god you have not lost anything
[1:52:06] never fear death
[1:52:08] anyway death meets us we are ready to go
[1:52:12] the devil cannot torment you with with
[1:52:14] the fear of death
[1:52:16] that is not a portion
[1:52:19] what you should fear
[1:52:21] most
[1:52:22] is to live in sin
[1:52:25] what you should fear most is to
[1:52:27] compromise
[1:52:29] belief
[1:52:31] but so long as you are living by the
[1:52:33] world
[1:52:34] so long as you are staying your grounds
[1:52:37] so long as you can see yourself in the
[1:52:39] pages of the scriptures so long as you
[1:52:41] are doing that which is pleasing in the
[1:52:42] sight of god
[1:52:44] do not care
[1:52:47] where death meets you
[1:52:49] it doesn't matter what time of day
[1:52:53] john the baptist went without his head
[1:52:56] but on that day we shall see him with
[1:52:57] his head
[1:52:59] praise be to god
[1:53:00] others were fed
[1:53:02] to the lions
[1:53:03] they didn't even have a carcass to bury
[1:53:06] but on that day praise be to god
[1:53:10] we shall see them face to face
[1:53:13] there is life beyond the grave
[1:53:15] the grave is not the end and the devil
[1:53:18] cannot use the grave
[1:53:19] to threaten us
[1:53:21] no
[1:53:22] don't let the devil get into your
[1:53:24] territory
[1:53:25] own it it is yours
[1:53:27] you are a child of god with promise
[1:53:30] praise be to god
[1:53:32] broken
[1:53:33] vessels
[1:53:34] of honor
[1:53:36] musicians can you please come over
[1:53:39] so know who you are
[1:53:41] know what you have believed
[1:53:43] we have not believed canningly devised
[1:53:44] fables
[1:53:46] we have believed the truth of the word
[1:53:48] we are standing for the word nothing by
[1:53:50] the word
[1:53:52] nothing else can take the place of god
[1:53:53] in your life
[1:53:55] if you want to look
[1:53:57] outside there and you look at people
[1:53:59] outside there
[1:54:00] and sometimes you are tempted to be like
[1:54:03] them
[1:54:05] never try it
[1:54:08] never try it
[1:54:12] you can look at the lives of other
[1:54:13] people
[1:54:15] how they drifted away from the truth
[1:54:18] and god by his grace brought them in and
[1:54:22] you look at it and say oh i can also do
[1:54:24] it god will bring me
[1:54:27] it may not be the same for you
[1:54:31] praise be to god
[1:54:35] brother one
[1:54:38] god bless your sense

[1:56:19] to follow jesus
[1:56:29] to follow jesus
[1:56:34] no turning back
[1:56:43] i'll read this uh verse in the bible
[1:56:45] before we pray tonight
[1:56:47] that's over in revelation chapter 2
[1:56:53] and it's it's to the message i mean to
[1:56:56] the church
[1:56:57] of pajamas
[1:57:00] and to the angel of the church
[1:57:03] in pagamos right these things say he
[1:57:08] we should have the sharp sword
[1:57:11] with two edge which is the word
[1:57:14] verse 13 i know that works
[1:57:18] and where thou doer
[1:57:21] i know that works
[1:57:23] i know exactly where you are
[1:57:26] even where satan's seed is
[1:57:30] and thou hold as fast my name
[1:57:35] and have not denied my faith
[1:57:38] now there were three things present in
[1:57:40] that age
[1:57:41] the word which is the the two actual
[1:57:45] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:57:48] and the faith
[1:57:50] of the son of man
[1:57:52] even in those days were in enterprise
[1:57:57] was my faithful my child who was slain
[1:58:00] among you
[1:58:02] where satan dwelleth
[1:58:05] let's pray together
[1:58:11] now just to think about an age that was
[1:58:14] called the seat of satan
[1:58:19] and there is no word in history you even
[1:58:21] read
[1:58:23] josephus
[1:58:24] and you read many histories not many
[1:58:28] will say anything about the life of
[1:58:30] enterprise
[1:58:32] but here in the scripture the bible
[1:58:36] mentioned that he was faithful
[1:58:41] living in an age that was the seat of
[1:58:43] satan
[1:58:45] and here we are we find ourselves in
[1:58:47] this laodicean age
[1:58:51] that is more evil
[1:58:52] and more wicked
[1:58:55] than the pygamus church age
[1:59:02] oh i believe that god is still going to
[1:59:04] have faithful ones
[1:59:07] he's still going to have faithful
[1:59:09] martians are people faithful witnesses
[1:59:12] that we stand for
[1:59:14] the word of god no matter what
[1:59:20] we are going through
[1:59:22] especially in times like this
[1:59:29] let's pray together tonight as we bring
[1:59:31] this service to one end
[1:59:33] that god will give us grace
[1:59:36] we will be able to lift the name of
[1:59:38] jesus up
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:41] we will be able to thank god
[1:59:44] even when we fail in a test
[1:59:48] we'll be able to thank god and
[1:59:53] no matter what come our way we will take
[1:59:56] the attitude to give thanks
[1:59:57] [Music]
[2:00:09] the lord will give us a thankful heart a
[2:00:11] grateful heart
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:15] that even when we are losing our voice
[2:00:17] and we can no longer
