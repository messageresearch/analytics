========================================
[Music] [Music] I believe [Music] Now I believe all things are possible. Now I believe. Now I believe. Now I believe all things are possible now. [Music] Let's remain standing just a moment now for the word of the Lord. Let's turn to Amos, the prophet Amos the third chapter beginning with the first verse. I want to thank Sister Wanita and Anna Jean and Sister Moore for that lovely course of songs that brought me back. As I said over there and listen to it, I was thinking when they were with us singing in the campaign, Brother Jack and I were talking them girls were little bitty girls, just little 16 something like that girl. Now I think Sister Anigene has five children. Sister uh um Wanita is has a mother of two children and we are really closer to that sunset women and we was then about 16 years difference won't be long we'll be crossing over by glorious time now in Amos the third chapter let's read hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up out of Egypt, saying, You only have I known all the families of the earth. Therefore, I will punish you for your iniquity. Can two walk together, except they be agreed? Will a lion roar in the forest when he has taken no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den? He's taken nothing. Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, or no jin is for him? Shall one take up a snare from the earth and having taken nothing from it? Shall the trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in the city and the Lord has not done it? Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he reveals his secrets to his servants, the prophets. The lion has roared. Who shall not fear? The Lord has spoken. Who can but prophesy? Let us bow our heads. Lord Jesus, may this thy word, Lord, may we have fellowship tonight around this portion. We pray, Lord, that you'll give us a context for the text that we shall take from here. And may it bring honor to thee. Bless us as we're waiting, Lord, tonight upon thy word. Heal the sick and afflicted. Save the lost. uh give strength to the feeble Lord that's getting weak both physically and spiritually and give us a great outpouring of thy presence for we ask that in Jesus name. Amen. I wish to take for a text from this tonight spiritual amnesia. Don't forget tomorrow. It's a prayer for the sick. Tomorrow we expect the Lord to do exceeding great things. Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock where we when we begin our services, the boy will be here to give out prayer cards and everyone will be prayed for that wants to be prayed for. And we're expecting a great time uh tomorrow in the Lord. Now you people are here visiting from out of town. Remember there's fine full gospel churches all through the city. You're welcome to all of them. I was just talking to one of my associate pastors outside just come in. Brother uh Jackson, formerly a Methodist church down a city or two below us. And how many is sure that's associated with the tabernacle? Let's see your hands everywhere. My I'm sure we're glad to have you down. This is the closest meeting I've been to Indiana for quite a while. Thinking about coming back pretty soon and putting up a tent and having those seven last trumpets, the Lord willing. So now, but remember tomorrow, don't forget it. Tomorrow at 2:00 and now our next service will begin next week in Tampa, Florida. Now, I want to speak on spiritual an amnesia. Now, this little fell that we're talking about, Amos, just for a moment to get our background before we get to the text. This was during the time of the great prosperity in Samaria. Israel had prospered. they had really uh went after the world and it prospered. Not always prosperity is a sign of spiritual blessings. But sometimes on the contrary, people think maybe you have to own a lot of worldly goods and shows that God's a blessing. That's not true. Uh sometimes it's the other way. But we find him. We don't know much about this little fella. He we have no history where he come from. We know he according to the scripture here. He's a herdsman. But God had raised him up. I can imagine seeing on one hot day in Samaria there the one of the great tourist cities of the world at that day. Something on the order of we say Miami or or Hollywood, Los Angeles, some of them places like that. Some great place for tourists. And we u just imagine you see him never been in such a city but he had the word of the Lord. He was coming to this great uh city where sin was heaped on every side. The ministers had all got away from the word of God and they hadn't had a prophet in long years. And so this little fell as he topped the hill just uh kind of north of Samaria. I can imagine seeing the hot sun shining down, his gray whiskers over his face and his little eyes narrowed and his little bald head shine as he looked down upon that city and his eyes narrowed. He wasn't looking at what tourists usually see to go to a city to see all of its enchantments of beauty. He looked and seen what a sight that that city had become. A city that once was a city of God and had gotten such a morally decay is that. No wonder this little unknown fella was Amos the prophet. And now we don't know very much about him. We don't know where he come from. Prophets usually come on the scene unknown. Lead the same way. We don't know where they come from, where they go, don't know about their backgrounds. God just raises them up. He wasn't much to look at, but he had thus sayeth the Lord. That's the main thing. I see. Of course, he come to Samaria to begin his campaign. I'm sure he had no cooperation from nobody. He had no fellowship card from any uh denomination. He had no credentials to show what group he come from. And but he had one thing. He had the word of the Lord for that city. And I wonder if we could transport Amos today down to our time. I wonder if he'd be welcome in our city today. I wonder if we would receive him or would we do just like they did. We find our cities in the same decay. And we find that sin is just great among the people as it was then. And I wonder if this little unknown man, how is he going to start this campaign? How where's he going to begin at? What church is he going to or who's going to cooperate with him? He had nothing to show where he come from. He had nothing at all. But thus saith the Lord for the city. He found them so decayed and so morally corrupted. It was a great time. The women in that city had become almost like they are in the United States. They had become corrupt. Everything that God had expected out of them, they went right the other way. And and we'd find that it was a great place where they had dancings on the street, the women immorally stripping their clothes and so forth like strip tees. Of course, that was a public amusement in them days. Now it's every day. Just let the weather get hot and you don't have to go to any show. You're all on the street anywhere. Anyhow, shame on you women to do a thing like that. You ashamed yourself. And um and then I said that to a woman here not long ago and she said why? She said uh brother Brandham said that that's uh uh that's just like the rest of women. I said but we are not supposed to act like the rest of the people. We are different. We are uh a different character. Reminds me of a woman said well brother Brandon another said I I don't wear those shorts and I wear slacks. I said that's worse. God said it's an abomination in his sight for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man. It's exactly right. One said, "Well, they don't make any other clothes. They still make sewing machines and have goods." There's no excuse. It's just what's in the heart. That's what shows out. It it identifies itself. And now we find in this city it become morally decayed. The preachers is afraid to see anything about it. And uh but they had a little old fell coming up over the hill was coming to tell him, "Thus sayaeth the Lord. Clean this thing up or you're going to go into captivity." And lived to see the days of his prophecy fulfilled. He prophesied the days of Jeroboam II, which was just a outcast. Anyhow, he he favored the other nations. And and listen Amos prophesied and told him, he said, "The very God that you claim to serve, he'll destroy you." Amen. And he did. And if his voice would be here tonight in the in Birmingham, it would claim the same thing to the churches. A very God that you claim to serve will destroy you someday. I'm not speaking to this audience here. These tapes go around the world. Now remember that is true. Then he found out when he come into the city that all this stuff I wonder how he must have felt to look and see that decay of the people of God to whom he was sent. Uh I wonder if we would receive him now if he'd come in. Would we would we cooperate with him? Would we give him our our best? Would we give him our attention? Would we repent if he told us that we should go back to the word of the Lord and do the way the Lord said? I wonder what our sisters would do about their bobbed hair. Would they let their hair grow out again? If Amos come on, he'd preach it. Now, I'm telling you that because that's the word of the Lord. I I wonder if our if our boards have put out deacons as married three or four times and and so forth like that and trying to be deacons. I wonder if all these things I wonder what he would do to man that would let his wife wear shorts and get out in the street out there and mow the yard out in the yard when man is passing by. I wonder what he'd say to a man like that. Amen. He certainly blessed it with all that was in him. For he had thus sayaeth the Lord, and he couldn't do nothing else but that. He found them in that day with a bad case um of a disease, spiritual uneasy. And that's just exactly what we got today. Now, how did he know what was going to happen? How would Amos know? First, he was a prophet. And the next thing he knowed by the disease what the diagnosis was and he know what the results was. If a doctor looks up on a malignancy and sees that that malignance done a hold, he knows there's nothing but death left. That's all. Unless God does something about it. Well, when you look at a city and you look at a people, you look at a church and look at a people that's so far away from God. There isn't nothing but to diagnose. But sin, the wages of sin is death. that's dying. The diagnosis proves what it is. You see, when people get away from God and won't listen to the word. Have no more desire for the word. Then there's one diagnosis to it. The soul that sinnth, that soul shall die. Unbelief shall separate you from God. That's exactly right. That he knew what the disease what the results was when he seen the disease of of sin in the city. Now this ammones we told it is a a a cause you to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself. Now it's an unusual thing. It don't happen too often but the causes is from shock. It's somebody that don't even know who they are. They find it from war. Sometime soldiers get it. Sometimes people get it. Another thing causes it is weary. Weary will cause it. Weary has no virtue to it at all. Now it's skip weary except faith. Someone said, "Well, now I have to go to be shot in the morning. Wouldn't you wor weary?" I said, "No, don't think so." Why? I said, "We couldn't do nothing but make me worse." Well, what good is going to do to have faith? I said, "It might deliver me." That's right. See, so weary has no virtue to it at all, but faith has all virtue. Believe. Now weary sometime cause it. And another thing that causes it among the people is getting between two opinions. That'll cause amnesia and it uh gets you to a place where you you actually what you've done. You've lost your reasons. You've lost your mind. You can't make you don't know who you are. You can't identify yourself. You can walk around, eat, everything, but you still you can't identify yourself. You've got your scholarly education. You can same education you had, but you don't know where it come from. You don't know who you are, where you belong. That's amnesia. So, we're told we are identified uh with our families in this human life by marriage and with our wives. We marry and our families identified by the union of our our our marriage. And then um what to think what if this horrible thing would happen to you and you wouldn't be able to remember who you married, who's your wife, which is your children, who is your father and mother, who's your neighbor. That would be a a horrible thing. Then we identified again can identify ourselves in the human race by having intelligence and and being different from the animal life. The animal cannot think. He just goes with sounds. He has no soul. And but we're animal life. What makes us different? We're a mammal. But what that mammal is warm-blooded animal. And we are in the feature of animal. But what makes us different? We are identified by having a soul, a conscience that tells us what's right and wrong. Now there is a place when you get this amnesia you might get like Nebuchadnezzar was who exalted himself one time and God let him think he was an animal and he lived out in the wilderness and and eat grass like an ox and and his u his hairs grow down his body like eagle feathers and he become the heart of a beast in him. See that was ammonia because he had forgotten that he was a king. He had forgotten that he was a human being and he thought he was an animal. So he acted like an animal. Amen. Because he forgot he was a human being. That's so easy today. And we forget sometimes what the Christian church is. We act like the world. Amen. That shows that we got spiritual amnesia because you don't act like the Christian. You act like the world. You receive the heart of the world. And it causes this. Here we um we find that Israel had uh exposed uh got exposed to the world and it fell into this rut. And this prophet was sent to dig him out of it if he could and to tell them God by his grace chose Israel from all the rest of the families on the earth. Grace had did that. He had given them the choice lands. He gave them houses that they never had to build. God did that. Chose them. He gave them farms that they never bought. He He gave them He gave them food that they never planted. He gave them wells that they never dug. He gave them victories that they never won. He gave them grace that they never merited. God did that by his grace for this people. Amen. Israel, his chosen, his beloved. And he said in the Bible, he found her in the field as a little girl sitting in her own blood. And he washed her and cleaned her up. And what he done? But after God showed all these mercies to her, and she got rich, she got amnesia and she forgot all about where these things come from. Amen. I think that's a picture of USA 1964. It's suffering with the same disease. We're great powerful churches. We're great powerful people. We're millions in number. And we'll forget where these things come from. They had a bad case of it after God had been good to him and brought him up from all the heathen lands and made him a separated people, separated them to himself. He said he took a vine out of another country and planted over in another country and how he fixed it around to make it grow fruit and be fruitful. But the vine forgot where its blessings come from. So has God's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a Christian means. Amen. It's again this amnesia has become upon the people. They can't identify themselves. They um they forgot all about it. They had forgot his holiness. They had forgot his law. The women were living like the rest of the women. God's church and his people has always been a separated people, a a calledout people, a peculiar people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices to God, the fruits of their lips, giving praise to his name. Amen. God called his church and separated from the world for that very purpose. And he given a law and he it must be holy. He said, "I am holy and you must be holy." and without holiness no man shall see the Lord. God said that himself and he called this people to be this type of people. But they had forgotten about it. They had forgotten his laws and they' forgotten their morals. The women out in the street, Israelite women out there, each one expecting to to be conceived by the Holy Spirit to bring forth the Messiah and then acting like that. Their character was terrible. I want to stop here a minute to say it's the same thing among our peoples today that call themselves Christians. Their character, if you would only realize one time in the south, I read a story from down here where when they used to have slaves. They'd take those people and sell them on the market just like you would a used car. And then there was a buyer, a broker would come by and pick up these slaves and trade them and just like you would a car or something. And those slaves was away from their home country. They were from Africa. The boores uh kidnapped them, brought them over here to the islands and then smuggled them into the United States and sold them for slaves out in Jamaica and around. Now we find that those people were sad. They had been kidnapped from their own home. They've been taken out by an enemy and they were sad. They'd never see their husband no more, their wife no more, their father, mother, their children. They were absolutely they had to whip them with whips to make them work for they were sad people. And one day a broker came by a certain plantation. He saw a bunch of slaves out there working and he he went in and asked the owner said, "How many slaves you got?" Said about a hundred. Said, "You got any that you'd swap or sell?" He said, "Yep." Said, "Let me look them over." And he went out in the field and watched them and he seen him have to whip them around. And after he saw one young man they didn't have to whip his chest out, his chin up, didn't have to whip him. So the broker said, "I'd like to buy that slave." And he said, "But he's not for sale." He said, "Well, what's the difference of that slave?" He said, "Is that slave the boss over the rest of them?" He said, "No, he's just a slave." He said, "Well, maybe you feed him different." He said, "No, he eats in a galley with the rest of the slaves." He said, "Well, what makes him so different from the rest of the slaves?" He said, 'Well, this I wondered too for a long time. But one day I learned that over in the homeland where he come from, his father is a king of the whole tribe. And though he be alien and away from home, yet he knows he's the son of a king. And he he conducts himself like the son of a king. I thought but that if a negro coming from Africa and noted his father was a tribesman and a king over a tribe, what ought it to do to a Christian that's born again, a man or woman that our father is a king of heaven and glory? We should conduct ourselves as Christian man and women. We should act like it, dress like it, talk like it, live like it. Though we be an alien, yet we are children of the king. Amen. our character, our demoration. In a days that we're living in now, Israel had dropped into that same rut and was all so immobile. They'd forgot the laws of God. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife and so forth. They'd forgotten those laws. They they they didn't want it anymore. And they uh they wanted to to be like the rest of the world, just like the church has got today. One time Israel when he started going to have a king over it. Samuel told him the prophet which was sent to them. He said now have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass? They said no you haven't. Did I ever beg you for my food and money your money to for me to live on? No you haven't done that. You never told us nothing Samuel but what come to pass? And you've never asked us for our money for your living. But yet we want the king anyhow. God said to Samuel, "Let them have him." They didn't turn you down. They turned me down. Israel had gotten that same shape. Now, they didn't want God's prophets no more. They didn't need him. And if one would come and bring them the word and try to bring them back to the word, they would reject it. Amen. They always do it in that manner of corruption. When the world and the church joins itself together, then they don't want nothing spiritual. They don't want thus, sayeth the Lord. They want what they want. They want the world and to say they're a Christian and live in the world and live with the world and live like the world and still maintain their confession of being a Christian. You know, the thing of it is it's spiritual amnesia. That's exactly what it is. They don't know who they are. They've forgotten that what they're supposed to do. If one would come today like that, it would be rejected just the same. They had a bad case of it and so have they today. They cannot identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it. The word, the gospel, they didn't want it. Sin disease had afflicted them and they love that. Sin is pleasant to the unconverted heart. It looks good to the unconverted mind, but it's a way of death. There's nothing left but death. The wages of sin is death and you must reap them wages. You've sowed to the winds and now reaping the whirlwind. The spiritual signs and the preaching of an ordained messenger from God never stirred them anymore. The women could laugh right their face and say, "I don't have to go hear such a stuff as that." If that hasn't repeated again, what is it? Spiritual amnesia. Exactly what it is. They have forgotten that God in his word is the same and he cannot change it. Amen. Prophet rose on the scene in them days and give a spiritual sign, a spiritual voice and give the voice of God behind it and only [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
