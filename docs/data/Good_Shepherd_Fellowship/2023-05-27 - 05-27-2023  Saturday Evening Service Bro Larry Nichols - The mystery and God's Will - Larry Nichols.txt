about the time at the obedient to a minute and say well folk I said 45 minutes but I ain't found one yet to stayed on 45 minutes come on brother I don't know what God help us amen and look at Ephesian the captain I wanted to get ready at the fourth through the 14th verse if being one four do the 14th verse you haven't seen that amen the Bible say listen carefully here now according [Music] as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world praise the Lord that we should be holy and without blamed for him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children that Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will Peter from it to the phrase where the uh the glory of his grace where in he had need us accept it into the love and whom we have Redemption through the through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in here are down toward us in all wisdom and prudent how are they known to at the mystery yes of his will can I read that again yes I will be known to us the mystery of his will according his good pleasure where he has purpose in himself that in a differentiation of the Buddhists of time he might get together in all and won all things in Christ look what are in heaven which are on earth even in him and who also we have retained inheritance then for destinated according to the purpose of him workers all things notice look at all things that we should lead to the phrase of his glory who first trusted in Christ and who all in whom he also trusted after that somebody said after that he heard the word of Truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that another after that again he believed he was sealed let it holy spirit of promise was in the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase possession until the praise of his glory why did God bless the word I prayed and not got to hear us God you get glory to get on in his name that's when I say amen amen you know they see the interest isn't he wonderful I wanted you to follow up scripture tonight they come from drones which are the Saint from high school no this night what a nice glitches that I use and I applied to my life dearly could it keep me motivated keep me encouraged to keep me from worrying kidney for negativism they keep me positive yes the Bible is saying here in Romans 8 28. let me share even now I'm not tests kind of found a decent for tonight as you will the negative that comes the positive the mystery of Israel the mystery of his will on the 8 28 tell us this and we know that all things we're together for good the deal who are the called according to his purpose the powerful things now I don't want to leave you know a can of foundation tonight the subject is again the negatively come from the positive and the problem we see this and then this is you don't mind the identification of Christ in all ages 54. probably say this they're gonna quote number 69. I break it down the end of the he wasn't even God God our in his word God you know I worship but he there wasn't nothing to worship him he was just the Eternal amen then he will answer this anyone know that actually is in other words in him were his thoughts yes thoughts they're his accidents then his word is thought expressed is a word and then again it was the word before it was even at rest do what it thought actually amen Amen in his thinking he was to be God probably created the ages first then he will worship he was God Amen and then in him was actually to the father to be son the savior nothing lost so they had to be lost the head of the away name for death to be here so we had to sit so he could heal it the only difference he asked for this and now remember if you ever did or Hell we'll have eternal life you had it with him then yeah amen God help us yes see you had it in him because Jesus came and Jesus was the Redeemer to do anything it'll bring it back but we're important from I went from right we did it bring it back and you the way you look Who You Are what your name is that what God thinking for the foundation of the world and Jesus came not to say the whole thing cut up s he wanted to but he country redeemed bringing that to them that was in his thoughts before the beginning that's the reason he was the word named flesh God was in Christ reconcile the world to himself the word God speaking of how he would do it he expressed himself in Jesus Christ you were Godly coming The Cure dude I know a lot of people that he was God Jesus Christ come on God oh Testament is Jesus Christ of the new he's saying that now where are you now you have to die because Delight snap a picture you're the negative any negative had the code into the dark room God help us through acid to develop the picture to make you what it is so the thing I go to the dark room God help us that's right listen he said we are now in Express innocent him if the negative has been taken we are a human life but let's go in the dark room down to the Grave go through it developing become that form in the night in the Innings all night young forever all the old age all the respect everything will be taken away do I redeemed God actually with Christ in the church you're like man and his wife that's right Christ and the bride because it redeemed that his thinking and his thinking he'll Express out amen tonight and I want to express in that tonight to you again that the negatively coming the positive I hate to know that we believe that because of the opening of the word the in the beginning with God he said before the kid anyway I don't know him the self-resistant one God there I died alone with his thoughts his Action News because they expressed in God's time and God sees him they were never before we was human we were in the thoughts of God asked to prepare breasts today as president God's time this season amen in other words we were there with God but then the father God said unless who live now tell her that we've now passed out the offerness out there to come flesh through the eternity and tried but in that area of class we'll be in the development God help us I want to look for tonight that that's where another time we loses sometimes hope to die we lose faithful fight and a development in the dark room many times it's a mystery and they're tired of uncertainty in a dark room let me call her now this hour that revelation released in a dark room come on come on God you're developing us in the time that I don't understand at all but I believe to do what he want me to be not what Mom and Daddy would need to be but God has already preparing my life oh so now I can't handle that he said not like you for your clan thy God so I had to accept what God's will is because initially his will Hallelujah because I tell God thank you that's why I eat that and negatively the positive and that is amen now that's wide in that mystery we couldn't know tonight because of the word that they're in Genesis we've got to understand even in a certain that there was a I don't need and there you thought either God there's no question now the man failed though because will the devil is dead he thought it was it was it was lost for the where it was God in his mind they were the last Lane for me and you knowing now we're full hello in preparation they are saying that he'll ran in by the way he fell from flesh take them to the nicotine come on for our guys are thinking lies so the dirt thought he had won but remember God always in control God why is his word somebody catch that yeah yeah oh his word do his word to be being manifested amen God what's all that word this is a friend who you're born to the word of God watching over your life he will guide you could God watch all his words Lord knowing anytime soon God were called and you were awesome because you're gonna respond the D in you he gonna respond plenty of God thank you now what is now what is that's why the Lord in my heart that tells you tonight there's a positive they're coming the negative come to positive look what you gotta understand is listen to me Governor now Lord give them to tell you that ended dark room because you didn't develop ment it's a mystery and sometimes you know we want to know the beginning to the end God ain't gonna tell us everything you need faith to know that God got everything in control ahead I probably said there's nothing I Decatur that he said it that's right the God order our steps righteous you order by the Lord somebody tell God I think I don't understand hear them tonight if that thing looks so awkward then I go wrong but here Brothers said when things seen everything going wrong because he knows that fortunate he'll dare you to fulfilled can't fail your word your life into existence before the world was me tonight gospel your word your life with your existence for the world and the call he said God so you had to shout to be saved he made a way of Escape so let's tell God thank you and therefore tonight either you're sitting here because God has made it so possible because in the nursery room in a dark room there's a mystery they have in your life don't understand but they stand on the inside say hold on [Applause] Spider-Boy can I preach this right here now he said nothing to you that's God you're permission yes sir keep saying man he said a dog cannot do nothing let God get help permission yes hello somebody goodbye enjoy that room but it was so sometimes but Joe knew he said the Lord take us the Lord gives the Lord to the god he could increase because you know that God would blessed one he would take and then the defense seemed so wrong God know how to turn around and they were for not good because I tell God thank you you're right here in front of God said listen he said there's a law of God there are law of God and the Lord God did what he naked that condition to come with the word we trust God tonight he'll make that condition that seems sort of wrong you know boy said yes name something tonight in your mind then you're going through you tonight this is so awkward see that thing just ain't going right so you think that I told you you ain't gonna make it that I know the deals are alive [Applause] if God said it so did God make it come to pass according his word I tell you thinking negative being positive the Bible is poverty you will never Resort they negative You Wanna Party the guy wearing it true he cannot fail trust God what do you do it up half we gotta trust God I can't see your mind the negative is coming to the positive listen here God gave me so many situations a promising in the Bible they look like it was a negative the God needs to come to positive God really shouldn't even a different one so then I can't go through all tonight God's gonna show me Abraham God needed him to get old the wife's zero old yeah you could talk about you know you can hear what son you're working here with a child what's wrong with you I don't got it wrong with you man you know you're old now but it had to leave God eating the dog hours he held on he hear the voice of God said you could have a son [Music] voice of God and say I look at how old I get I'm gonna beat that fast I'm not going to stack it in the fronts of God's word because God said it it'll come to pass somehow think God will only worry so now no Abraham and said go down into Greer they were old they walking hand in hand hello somebody yeah they walked they were the body yeah [Applause] bodies because they are from us they had to cut a pass with one that promising they ain't gonna have a son could not fail no demon no delicate of me that word failed God has spoken it he had to cut a pass oh I will get with it tonight okay we're here tonight God you know his son yeah in when they were hit cousins any thought throwing that kind of talk man you know that our timeline you know I got

another life so he kind of you know say I told a little little white lie Garfield set in you told the king of the left this is my sister look she really was but he said because of fear to get the key

against amen noticed I'm saying what to say okay he said now and this is the god change his mind this is satisfied 427 . he said so we really believe that God never changed his mind about what he said he always keep the truth but he had a pernicious wheel yeah right praise the Lord I'll read what he said yeah now they're aware the troubles lead we try to wait on God in this wheel and he will commit it but also if we take the mistress will do it not right he will make it his conditions will to work out together to glorify his purple wheel they're scrolling in it yeah nothing will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is taken at tonight there's nothing wrong Eric literally hit it exactly the way it should be everything we think it wrong but he know it right it's supposed to be like this sin to come he didn't that wasn't his perfect will but you see God a great spirit the father and him was answer these and anything that was that you see declared now is just the actually being displayed he dwelled alone that's right he wasn't not even God God and object I wish he was a great Eternal one and in him way I seduce such aired to the father to the Savior to the Healer and now how can you do that he had to the father to call you through he will follow but he prayed alone he alone is Immortal and now but he actually had to be displayed now do they say you they had to be something lost yeah and God cannot perfectly lose anything and then redeem it oh Holiness and a great judgment that he was a man on the Lord three more Nation knowing that man will fall we'll fail and in that he became man himself in order to redeemed that man that that failed that the reason that Jesus was Emmanuel of God God sent another person deciding himself and then that wouldn't be just a guy had come himself and take place and God could not they come down in spirit and take place he had to be made flesh In the Flesh of his own created son and he know he showed here in the beginning that her will went to the crazy man out of the desert Earth but you see the minute it says because he brought in he never did intention to the one that says amen being able to committed which soon will fade away amen are you with me now the negative becoming positive amen get sick so he'd be healed oh they actually they're fresh but he will God but what gospel this is real but now he's able to
