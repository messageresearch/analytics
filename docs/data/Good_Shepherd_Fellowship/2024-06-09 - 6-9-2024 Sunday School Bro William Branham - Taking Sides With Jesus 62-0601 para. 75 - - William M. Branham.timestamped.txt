[0:36] [Music]
[0:50] and think of all you man sitting here
[0:54] that I believe I'll spend an eternity
[0:56] with over glory in hand we got fine and
[1:00] fine material solid sound people just
[1:05] recently there's a Revival broke out in
[1:07] the church here amongst the people the
[1:09] Spirit come among them begin to give
[1:12] gifts I watched it to see if he go off
[1:14] into fanaticism every time you start
[1:17] moving that way the spirit check it
[1:18] bring it back here praise the Lord if
[1:21] you just hold your place that's fine see
[1:26] now what my thoughts is is this is if it
[1:31] could be possible that when I start
[1:33] going
[1:34] somewhere I don't know where I'm going
[1:38] but I can't sit still I ain't going to
[1:40] stay
[1:41] here I just can't do it I got to move
[1:45] somewhere and I probably won't stay
[1:47] there but a few days be moving somewhere
[1:49] else I got to go somewhere I don't know
[1:52] where I'm going neither did Abraham know
[1:55] where he was going he just crossed the
[1:57] river and started off
[2:00] that's all I feel that what we ought to
[2:03] do here in this present time I believe
[2:06] that we need a
[2:08] church I think I think the house of God
[2:11] you say well what's putting all that
[2:13] money in it if the Lord is going to come
[2:15] or what goods go do to keep the money if
[2:17] the Lord comes if the people designated
[2:20] the money for the church it's our duty
[2:23] with 100% vot year I took that night to
[2:25] build the church so build it I'd say
[2:28] build it yes sir I've never expressed
[2:30] this before but I want to do it before
[2:32] you man didn't want the women here
[2:34] because one leans this way and that way
[2:36] I'm trying to tell you the reason I want
[2:37] to do it I think if the Lord's coming
[2:40] next week let's start the church this
[2:42] week certainly let's show him let's
[2:45] stand it our poster Duty yes sir and
[2:48] then if we uh when the churches build up
[2:50] why say if he's what if he's 10 years
[2:52] from now what if he's 20 years or what
[2:54] if he's 100 years whatever it is when he
[2:56] comes that matters not we know he'll be
[2:59] coming for us before before that time
[3:00] because we can't live it out 100 years
[3:02] more you'll be coming for us but we got
[3:05] to leave partings behind us and I
[3:07] thought this why not then let the church
[3:10] board here speaking to them now build
[3:12] that church put it up here make it nice
[3:16] and a nice place where the people can
[3:18] come I'd suggest brother Neville be the
[3:21] pastor of the church as long as the
[3:23] church suggest him being Pastor that's
[3:25] the vote of the church as long as he
[3:27] holds a post of Duty and stays with the
[3:29] faith wants to come feels the leading of
[3:31] the Lord then the leading of the Lord
[3:33] for him to stay if the congregation
[3:35] votes the same then I'd say each one of
[3:37] these men out here these other men like
[3:40] brother chce and brother Junior all them
[3:43] as long as they feel their duty at that
[3:45] post and they're Associated here
[3:47] together you can't go down and meet with
[3:49] the
[3:50] Methodist you have no fellowship with
[3:52] them the Baptist you go talking about
[3:55] speaking in tongues in the baptism in
[3:57] Jesus name they kick you out that quick
[4:00] that's right you sit around there you'd
[4:02] be like a a dove amongst a bunch of
[4:04] crows you would have no fellowship at
[4:06] all you're die I ain't making fun of
[4:08] Methodist and Baptist now remember that
[4:10] I'm not saying that I'm just drawing a
[4:13] comparison that many of those Methodist
[4:15] and Baptists are good man godly man but
[4:18] I'm talking about the
[4:19] fellowship there's brother what's his
[4:22] name back there tonight the the
[4:23] Evangelist sitting back there brother uh
[4:25] JT Parnell brother beer believe this
[4:28] brother sitting here some of many of you
[4:31] here are man of God calling in your life
[4:34] you can be doing something just don't
[4:36] sit around let's do something you don't
[4:39] get the one Soul saved get that one
[4:42] saved each one of us now I think this
[4:45] church if you man would when you build
[4:49] this church make this like your
[4:51] headquarters and like brother Neville
[4:54] here being like the senior Elder among
[4:56] you see and sometimes you get a question
[5:00] that you can't discuss out with your
[5:02] church out there then bring it in here
[5:05] to brother Neville and you all discuss
[5:07] it together if you can't come to any
[5:10] decision I'll be coming by pretty soon
[5:13] then we'll all come together with it and
[5:15] and then in there get training in your
[5:18] own groups other ministers man that you
[5:21] see that has a calling in their life for
[5:23] the ministry train them young man bring
[5:26] them in here to the Elder all of these
[5:28] set together in a ministerial meeting
[5:31] and there teach the deeper things of God
[5:33] don't go on the bad end keep someone who
[5:37] can have confidence in to be kind of
[5:39] like a a leader for you and then
[5:43] sometimes if you don't see it just
[5:44] exactly the way he does don't that's all
[5:46] right you're in the faith anyhow just
[5:48] move along maybe when we come together
[5:50] then all of together we are pray the
[5:52] discernment of God come down and he'll
[5:54] give it just exactly what it is you see
[5:56] and let us know just how to do it and in
[5:58] there churches can go here here and
[6:00] training up a group of men and if I'm in
[6:02] Evangelistic work somewhere there's
[6:05] places I can place them
[6:07] worldwide what if I was in India go back
[6:09] to
[6:10] India there I'd say to these people
[6:13] maybe you'd have thousands of them stay
[6:15] there for a week or two and they see the
[6:17] ministry they love it they believe it's
[6:19] a truth they come out of heathenism
[6:21] there I've got and maybe in two or three
[6:23] weeks when it's only there two nights
[6:25] and maybe 100,000 converted to Christ
[6:28] nowhere to go the next they take a plane
[6:30] and start back to Rome then to the
[6:32] United States leave them just like sheep
[6:35] put Out Among Wolves what if I had a
[6:38] group of man young man trained in the
[6:43] message to say now wait a minute before
[6:47] I leave here we're going to set in order
[6:51] these
[6:51] churches I'll have a man had already
[6:54] telegrammed and they got the money
[6:56] they're on the road here right now to
[6:58] take over this
[7:00] a good man is two or three young men
[7:03] with him who will be his helpers and
[7:05] assistants and a church of this faith
[7:08] can be set there which will be a Outpost
[7:11] in India Outpost in Germany Outpost in
[7:14] Switzerland while right now we should
[7:17] had them all around the nation to where
[7:19] I've been amen and the message then from
[7:22] there comes another from another comes
[7:24] another see what I
[7:25] mean now tomorrow night day after
[7:29] tomorrow night you'll see Matson Bose
[7:31] come down here which is my friend you'll
[7:34] see just what one little crippled up
[7:38] swed did over there in
[7:42] tanzan he went in there and Matson B is
[7:46] a good man but he don't believe the
[7:48] faith that we believe I've tuck him
[7:51] right out and Tuck him and just tied him
[7:53] to such a place in the scripture I say
[7:54] Matson you're my friend now you're not
[7:56] going to jump or run we're just going to
[7:58] stand here and hold one of his hands and
[7:59] Christian Brothers and talk see they lay
[8:01] the message right to him and he just
[8:03] stand there he say brw brandom you you
[8:05] sure all right I said now Manson you
[8:08] don't believe that or you'd accept it
[8:09] well uh brute Brandon I believe what you
[8:12] say is the truth and why don't you
[8:13] accept it see just burn it right down to
[8:15] him and he he then as soon as he gets
[8:17] away he's gone see but just watch what
[8:21] that man did in his missions over there
[8:24] just one man because he can stand right
[8:27] back to Chicago and pick up Burton and
[8:28] all the rest send them over in there
[8:30] like that and start to work doing to now
[8:32] they're getting up into the tens of
[8:34] thousands of one little Revival not a
[8:38] man with gifts just a man who had enough
[8:41] courage to go there and
[8:43] start what could have been done under
[8:47] this could been ranking in the
[8:50] millions sure we've lost that time
[8:54] that's what my suggestion would be now
[8:56] remember in doing this you'll find out
[8:59] there may be times that you'll disagree
[9:01] with brother so and so you'll disagree
[9:04] over here and remember as long as you
[9:06] get to the spot you say well because he
[9:08] don't believe it just like me I ain't
[9:10] going to then there's something wrong
[9:12] with you is not wrong with the other
[9:15] fellow it's something wrong with you
[9:17] when Brethren who are trying to hold
[9:19] together is one thing we brandom's is
[9:23] nine of us and we' fight like pet
[9:27] dogs but after all when we got through
[9:29] fighting we were still
[9:31] brandom one know the other was a brandom
[9:34] I know he was a brandom he know I was a
[9:35] brandom see but we' fight you do that in
[9:38] your family but they're still your
[9:40] brothers that's what it is we might
[9:42] different that's all right but we're
[9:44] still
[9:45] one we're one in Christ we believe this
[9:48] message and let's stay with it and I
[9:50] think that's a thing to do to keep on
[9:52] carrying on until Jesus comes and that's
[9:55] what I wanted to say in that manner and
[9:58] I believe if you have like see you've
[10:01] got to be enthused with it if you're not
[10:04] enthused then it's something
[10:06] wrong it's something wrong you've got
[10:08] just not say well last month I was
[10:11] pretty well enthused but I don't know
[10:13] see then there's something wrong
[10:15] somewhere you got to be enthused all the
[10:17] time see and just keep punching it's the
[10:20] devil trying to get you like I always
[10:22] like the uh our last president Mr
[10:26] Eisenhower godly man but I'm talking
[10:28] about the fellowship
[10:30] there's brother what's his name back
[10:32] there tonight the the Evangelist sitting
[10:34] back there brother JT Parnell brother
[10:37] beer believe this brother sitting here
[10:39] some of many of you here man of God
[10:43] calling in your life you can be doing
[10:45] something just don't sit around let's do
[10:48] something you don't get the one Soul
[10:50] saved get that one
[10:52] saved each one of us now I think this
[10:55] church if you man would when you build
[10:59] this church make this like your
[11:01] headquarters and like brother Neville
[11:04] here being like the senior Elder among
[11:06] him see and sometimes you get a question
[11:09] that you can't discuss out with your
[11:12] church out there then bring it in here
[11:15] to brother nille and you all discuss it
[11:17] together if you can't come to any
[11:20] decision I'll be coming by pretty soon
[11:22] then we'll all come together with it and
[11:25] and then in there get training in your
[11:28] own groups other ministers man that you
[11:31] see that has a calling in their life for
[11:33] the ministry train them young man bring
[11:36] them in here to the Elder all of you set
[11:38] together in a ministerial meeting and
[11:41] there teach the deeper things of God
[11:43] don't go on the bad end keep someone who
[11:47] can have confidence in to be kind of
[11:49] like a a leader for you and then
[11:52] sometimes if you don't see it just
[11:54] exactly the way he does don't that's all
[11:56] right you're in the faith anyhow just
[11:58] move along maybe when we come together
[12:00] then all of us together we'll pray the
[12:02] discernment of God come down and he'll
[12:04] give it just exactly what it is you see
[12:06] and let us know just how to do it and in
[12:08] there churches can go here and training
[12:10] up a group of men and if I'm in

[16:23] see then there's something wrong
[16:25] somewhere you got to be enthused all the
[16:27] time see and just keep punching it's the
[16:30] devil trying to get you like I always
[16:32] liked uh our last president Mr
[16:36] Eisenhower uh I had a great admiration
[16:39] for uh General
[16:42] Eisenhower uh he said when we were
[16:45] fighting he said there's many times we
[16:47] picked up a shell and thrilled it into
[16:49] the gun and pulled a hammer on it and
[16:50] let her fall and snapped it didn't go
[16:53] off said we didn't surrender so we might
[16:56] have put in another one and it snapped
[16:58] too said we didn't give up said we kept
[17:01] on snapping till the one went off amen
[17:04] that's it that's the way to win the
[17:06] war keep trying throw a shell in and
[17:09] pull
[17:10] it you got a purpose a Target to hit and
[17:14] if it don't go off throw it out throw
[17:16] another one in and try it again throw it
[17:18] in and try it again till one goes off
[17:21] there one of them in there is the liive
[17:24] one of them will go off so that's way we
[17:26] got to do just keep firing away firing
[17:29] away until something happens what am I
[17:34] doing I'm firing away now I'm going out
[17:37] here and I know even out any leading or
[17:41] responsibility millions of people
[17:43] looking at you what you going to do
[17:45] what's the next move some thinks I'm
[17:47] dead some thinks this even that gun off
[17:50] the day said I was trying to commit
[17:51] suicide everything see out around the
[17:53] country and everything see but you got
[17:56] all that to contend with now and you got
[17:59] the burden of the people and just
[18:01] imagine what if God would place on you
[18:03] that you know the heart of the people
[18:04] that you was talking to think about
[18:08] that
[18:10] see Brethren maybe I know you have
[18:13] burdens but you don't understand and
[18:15] besides that here you've got the
[18:18] responsibility here you say well that
[18:20] ought to be easy for you brother Bram
[18:21] anything to do God just tell you know he
[18:23] doesn't I sweat it out just like you do
[18:25] and a whole lot
[18:27] harder sure
[18:29] I have to sweat it much harder than you
[18:31] do and there's going to be more required
[18:33] of me where you have to answer for a
[18:35] church where you have to answer for your
[18:37] family or maybe just for yourself see
[18:40] there's millions of souls I got to
[18:41] answer for I got to know my movs and if
[18:46] Satan's knocking you for one Soul or a
[18:48] few Souls that you'll catch what about
[18:49] out your where millions are setting in
[18:51] order how many more blast is it throwing
[18:53] in there see so you got a whole lot to
[18:57] remember brother not no one I get
[18:59] nervous sometimes sure but now I'm
[19:03] punching away right now I throw a shell
[19:05] in if it fires there it is if it don't
[19:09] fire I won't quit I'll throw that one
[19:11] out of a thud and try another one one
[19:14] of's going to go off that's all there is
[19:16] to it one of them's going to fire
[19:18] somewhere then I I want to be on the
[19:20] target so when it does fire I'll hit the
[19:23] object that I'm shooting at and I you
[19:25] know what I mean I'm sure there's
[19:27] something somewhere on I'm leaving for
[19:29] these meetings just plunging out on her
[19:32] I don't aim to teach these great things
[19:35] I teach you people you remember what
[19:37] that dream that I got the interpretation
[19:39] was go back and store up
[19:42] food where was The Storehouse this
[19:47] Tabernacle where is there anything like
[19:49] it in the country around here anywhere
[19:51] that will compare with the message that
[19:53] we have now of course our little
[19:55] brothers here that's out along here
[19:56] these other little churches are us
[19:59] we are one where would you go to to find
[20:02] it short it's comparison
[20:05] anywhere you go right out denominational
