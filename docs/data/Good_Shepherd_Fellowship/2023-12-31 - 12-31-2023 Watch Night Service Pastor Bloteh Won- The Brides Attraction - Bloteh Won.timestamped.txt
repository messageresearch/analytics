[51:16] to make this uh a prayer meeting tonight
[51:20] a meeting of Thanksgiving and just
[51:22] pouring our hearts to the Lord
[51:24] committing our s in his hands praying
[51:27] for one another praying for the
[51:29] different families that's what we want
[51:31] to do tonight and uh
[51:35] uh uh more than
[51:39] uh let's read uh Genesis chapter 3 we
[51:45] spoke about the woman seed this
[51:48] morning and uh but let's go back to
[51:50] Genesis chapter
[51:54] 3
[51:56] while I was aw I was I was over there in
[51:59] the in the guest house I think it was a
[52:02] guest house they had me in and I was I
[52:04] was listening to a message and and uh
[52:08] just trying to relax my mind for the
[52:11] next service and then something struck
[52:15] me on this thought and I thought well
[52:17] maybe that could be a good thing to
[52:19] speak on on the 31st night so uh Genesis
[52:23] chapter 3
[52:25] let's read verse
[52:29] 15 and
[52:32] 16 and I will put
[52:34] emoy between thee and the
[52:40] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[52:44] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[52:47] shall bruise his heat now just like I
[52:50] said this morning with Isaiah prophecy
[52:54] uh it's supposed to be the Virgin
[52:56] because if you look into Matthew when
[52:58] Matthew quoted Isaiah he corrected that
[53:01] he never said a virgin he said the
[53:03] Virgin shall conceive so when we look
[53:05] back here we see the same thing and I
[53:07] will put emity between thee and not a
[53:11] woman but their
[53:13] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[53:17] and they shall bruise thy head and thou
[53:19] shall bruise his
[53:20] head unto the woman he said I will great
[53:25] multiply th
[53:27] sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou
[53:31] shall bring forth children and thy
[53:34] desire shall be to the thy husband and
[53:38] he shall rule over thee th desire shall
[53:41] be to the husband and he shall rule over
[53:46] thee now with that phrase tonight that
[53:49] desire shall be to their husand and he
[53:53] will rule over the and and uh that's
[53:55] what I want to take my my thoughts from
[53:58] tonight to to preach on attraction I
[54:01] want to preach on attraction because I
[54:03] talk about the word attraction and then
[54:05] when I look at the meaning attraction is
[54:08] a feeling of interest is a
[54:12] desire or closeness towards someone so
[54:17] that desire shall be to the husband and
[54:20] he shall rule over thee let's go to St
[54:23] John 12:
[54:26] 32 in John
[54:45] 12:32 St John chap 12 verse
[54:54] 32
[55:04] let's read from verse 30 just to be able
[55:07] to grab a little context of uh of uh the
[55:10] chapter there Jesus answered and said
[55:13] this
[55:14] voice came not because of
[55:17] me but for thy
[55:20] sake now is the Judgment of this word
[55:25] now is the Judgment of this word now
[55:28] shall the prise of this word be cast
[55:32] out and I if I be lifted up from the
[55:37] earth will draw all men unto
[55:42] me praise the Lord and I if I be lifted
[55:47] up from the earth will draw all men unto
[55:51] me let's pray together Heavenly Father

[58:18] version
[58:20] amen praise the
[58:23] lord well just like we said this morning
[58:26] uh uh we are very
[58:28] grateful and uh I'm not just saying it
[58:31] because they are words but we are very
[58:34] grateful that uh we have this little
[58:37] body of Believers people that uh uh we
[58:42] believe that are standing standing
[58:45] together to be able to push the name of
[58:47] Jesus Christ from this little place amen
[58:51] we are very very grateful as a church we
[58:54] have had our shares of
[58:56] trouble we have had our shares of
[58:59] trouble we have uh uh went through all
[59:04] sorts of different things but yet we
[59:06] have stay together we have stay on the
[59:10] the co and of of Jesus Christ we are
[59:13] stayed together tonight so we are very
[59:16] very very grateful and I know many of
[59:20] the Saints couldn't make it and some are
[59:23] following the service tonight uh even
[59:26] the S down from uh MTO they are
[59:29] following the service tonight and
[59:31] different ones so we greet every one of
[59:33] you and uh we will remember brother
[59:35] Wesley and sister Carrick over there in
[59:38] Illinois and uh following the service
[59:40] too we want to greet them brother Mark
[59:43] Wilson down in wona and we want to also
[59:46] greet him and I heard a greetings from
[59:49] Brother Juan herandez and uh we we also
[59:53] want to to greet our brother if he's
[59:56] following the service tonight uh we miss
[59:58] brother one uh as as few of us know uh
[1:00:02] he's uh he's been uh uh going through uh
[1:00:07] a Chang in his life he you know uh been
[1:00:11] coming short of his memory so uh uh he's
[1:00:15] been advised to stay close to home so uh
[1:00:18] and I I spoke to him told him I think
[1:00:21] that's that's okay with me and uh in
[1:00:24] know Al brother Steven be and and all
[1:00:26] the different ones brother Andrew sister
[1:00:28] Christin told me they they will be the
[1:00:31] way this weekend and uh so I think uh uh
[1:00:36] they either in service or following the
[1:00:37] service tonight but
[1:00:40] tonight this word
[1:00:43] attraction kind of uh uh hit me and uh
[1:00:48] uh tonight I want to I want to speak on
[1:00:51] the bride's
[1:00:52] attraction but because it's the end of
[1:00:55] the year I want to also ask a question
[1:00:59] because when I taught on the the word
[1:01:01] attraction I also taught on the message
[1:01:04] what is the attraction on the
[1:01:07] mountain and uh we we will now talk
[1:01:10] about the attraction on the mountain
[1:01:12] tonight I want to I want to actually ask
[1:01:15] a question what is our attraction for
[1:01:19] 2024 what is attracting us to
[1:01:23] 2024 praise the Lord and uh before we
[1:01:27] start guessing in our mind the bride's
[1:01:30] attraction for 2024 is the rapture is
[1:01:34] the coming of the Lord now I'm not
[1:01:37] saying the coming of the Lord is
[1:01:40] 2024 I want to be clear on
[1:01:44] tape praise the Lord but the bright
[1:01:47] attraction for
[1:01:49] 2024 is the
[1:01:52] rapture and uh uh you will you will see
[1:01:55] why I say that as we get into our talk
[1:02:00] tonight now we see we living in such a
[1:02:05] time we're living in such a time where
[1:02:08] we realize that
[1:02:12] uh uh Satan has uh uh uh a a
[1:02:18] diversion uh and different devices and
[1:02:21] different things that he's doing today
[1:02:24] distract
[1:02:26] us
[1:02:27] amen they're just out of there to
[1:02:30] distract us but the bride attraction is
[1:02:34] the
[1:02:35] word the Fulfillment of the word when
[1:02:38] God is bringing his word to
[1:02:42] pass that's what attract
[1:02:46] us amen when God is bringing his word to
[1:02:51] pass in our life in the life life of
[1:02:54] another brother in the life of another
[1:02:57] sister that should be our
[1:03:00] attraction praise the
[1:03:04] Lord and uh
[1:03:09] uh but we see that's where the greater
[1:03:12] battle is is to get us away from that
[1:03:17] attraction and the devil use his
[1:03:21] distraction and it becomes an attraction
[1:03:24] to
[1:03:25] Us Praise the
[1:03:28] Lord with with all of the things that is
[1:03:30] happening around us you know and and and
[1:03:33] most especially with uh this age that we
[1:03:37] are we are in this kind of uh virtual
[1:03:41] age that we are
[1:03:42] in Praise the
[1:03:44] Lord and uh
[1:03:53] uh with all of those things so we we
[1:03:56] want to look at this together tonight I
[1:03:59] pray that I will be able to find the
[1:04:01] grace to to to deliver it as uh as a f
[1:04:06] inspired uh just uh steuding and and
[1:04:10] thinking about
[1:04:11] this attraction is a feeling of
[1:04:16] Interest a
[1:04:18] desire or closeness towards someone and
[1:04:23] yet we see that uh uh uh God is speaking
[1:04:28] to
[1:04:29] Eve uh talking about the seed of the
[1:04:33] woman and all of
[1:04:35] that and let me say this there is
[1:04:37] something that is that is becoming you
[1:04:40] know so so clearer to me than than ever
[1:04:44] before just like when we read there in
[1:04:46] Deuteronomy chapter 23 about uh you know
[1:04:51] uh bastor shall not come into the
[1:04:52] congregation of the Lord
[1:04:55] what I beginning to realize as I look
[1:04:57] into the scripture and the and the
[1:04:59] message of the hour I realize that uh
[1:05:03] God placed a lot of things in his
[1:05:07] word in the form of a
[1:05:10] prophecy God expressed his thoughts let
[1:05:14] let's let's make let's let's uh give an
[1:05:17] example when he was telling Moses to
[1:05:20] build a
[1:05:21] tabernacle like the faction in heaven
[1:05:24] now he took Moses on the mountain and uh
[1:05:28] and he told him to build the
[1:05:31] Tabernacle and just like as he have seen
[1:05:34] in heaven now but we realize that that
[1:05:39] Tabernacle that Moses was building it
[1:05:43] was just an
[1:05:44] expression of this Tabernacle that you
[1:05:47] and myself
[1:05:49] are because we have to realize that God
[1:05:53] just like in Genesis Genesis chapter 1
[1:05:55] when God was creating everything when he
[1:05:59] was creating everything he started from
[1:06:01] the least form of life and to the
[1:06:04] highest form of life and God only got
[1:06:08] rest when he made a Man In His
[1:06:13] Image praise the
[1:06:15] Lord God only got rest he took rest to
[1:06:19] himself when he was able to achieve to
[1:06:22] have a man
[1:06:24] In His
[1:06:25] Image now so that is the same thing God
[1:06:30] we have to realize that his his ultimate
[1:06:34] desire was to come from a thought form
[1:06:38] was to come from a spirit form let me
[1:06:40] say it that way from being an invisible
[1:06:44] God to be
[1:06:45] visible praise the Lord so God highest
[1:06:49] desire that was in his heart was to be
[1:06:52] made flesh
[1:06:54] yes that everything he have ever Tau of
[1:06:58] in his mind should be expressed in a
[1:07:01] visible
[1:07:04] form so even when he when he told Moses
[1:07:08] to build a
[1:07:10] tabernacle according to the vision he
[1:07:12] saw in heaven Moses built a tabernacle
[1:07:15] and the glory of God came down but what
[1:07:18] God was Desiring what actually he was
[1:07:21] Desiring was to have a body that he
[1:07:24] could D
[1:07:25] in Praise the Lord he says the heaven is
[1:07:29] my Throne the Earth is my for stone
[1:07:31] there is no building that will contain
[1:07:33] me but a body will that prepare
[1:07:36] me are we together so when you look at
[1:07:40] the Old Testament prophets you look at
[1:07:42] the Old Testament you will see that and
[1:07:45] in many places God was just expressing
[1:07:48] his thoughts what he was going to
[1:07:52] achieve he put it in the form of
[1:07:55] ordinance and statutes in in in the Old
[1:07:58] Testament and as we follow the principle
[1:08:01] we realize
[1:08:04] that it is all about
[1:08:07] God yes and not about
[1:08:11] us that's one thing about about the
[1:08:15] gospel one thing about the word of God
[1:08:18] is all God
[1:08:20] center it's all God Center he said my
[1:08:24] glory I will share with no man it's all
[1:08:27] God
[1:08:29] centered and that is the that is the
[1:08:31] success of the church if the church can
[1:08:34] be all God
[1:08:36] Center that would be the success of of
[1:08:39] our life if we will ever get to the
[1:08:41] place where it will be all God centered
[1:08:44] he said when I be lifted up I will draw
[1:08:47] all men unto
[1:08:50] me praise the Lord the picture will
[1:08:53] start Bec coming h h h h blurred and and
[1:08:57] and getting D when you start putting
[1:09:00] yourself in the
[1:09:04] picture but if you leave it all God
[1:09:06] Center you're going to see it more
[1:09:08] clearer right praise the
[1:09:10] Lord
[1:09:13] hallelujah and uh uh so that's that's
[1:09:16] one of the thing and I say there because
[1:09:18] when you look at this prophecy over here
[1:09:21] and God speaking to the woman your
[1:09:24] desire will be to your husband is it's
[1:09:26] so easy for us to get our eyes from the
[1:09:31] big picture of the prophecy and bring it
[1:09:34] to ourself it's so easy for me to tell
[1:09:37] my wife the Bible say your desire will
[1:09:39] be to your
[1:09:40] husband praise the Lord but you see what
[1:09:44] happened there is that if I do that I
[1:09:47] exclude myself out of the prophecy and I
[1:09:50] I leave the prophecy for her
[1:09:52] alone
[1:09:56] that is the danger I kick myself off the
[1:09:58] prophecy because I'm seeing that okay
[1:10:00] she's the wife I'm the husand your
[1:10:02] desire will be to your
[1:10:04] husand
[1:10:06] right but you see this this this is a
[1:10:09] more bigger thought God had a more
[1:10:12] broader thought than just for our our
[1:10:16] human desire our fleshly desire our mind
[1:10:19] desire it has a
[1:10:22] place for the Natural Woman it also has
[1:10:26] a place for the spiritual church amen
[1:10:29] amen are we
[1:10:32] together but there is a more bigger
[1:10:34] picture
[1:10:37] there praise the
[1:10:39] Lord there is a more bigger and broader
[1:10:43] picture when we look at that that desire
[1:10:46] will be to your husband and he will have
[1:10:49] the ru over
[1:10:52] you glor glory be to
[1:10:55] God
[1:10:56] hallelujah amen now so as we look at
[1:11:00] this thought together tonight let me
[1:11:03] read few things that uh that I was able
[1:11:07] to gather here in the message
[1:11:10] inspiration brother bandam says the
[1:11:12] greatest attraction the word has ever
[1:11:15] had when Christ be lifted up to a fallen
[1:11:20] word that is the greatest attraction the
[1:11:23] word has ever had that Christ will be
[1:11:25] lifted up to a fallen word praise the
[1:11:28] Lord he also said Jesus said when he was
[1:11:32] here on Earth if I be lifted up I would
[1:11:35] draw all men unto me black white yellow
[1:11:38] brown whatever the color or race is the
[1:11:42] gospel still
[1:11:44] holds the center of
[1:11:46] attraction to every man and every woman
[1:11:51] praise the Lord amen the gospel still
[1:11:54] holds the center of
[1:11:57] Attraction now follow me in that line of
[1:11:59] thought now to see what I'm getting
[1:12:01] to the gospel stay holds the center of
[1:12:08] Attraction he goes on again and says
[1:12:11] here in the message the truth and false
[1:12:13] Vine he says to my opinion the gospel
[1:12:16] never losses attraction to the
[1:12:20] believer it's always the same
[1:12:25] gospel are we
[1:12:33] together the gospel never lost
[1:12:36] attraction to the believer it is the
[1:12:39] same
[1:12:43] gospel
[1:12:46] Hallelujah now so when I when I look at
[1:12:49] this when I look at this because uh uh
[1:12:52] uh uh uh there's a picture piure in my
[1:12:54] mind and and as soon as you can grapp it
[1:12:56] the service will be over tonight uh I
[1:12:58] promise you praise the Lord and I'm
[1:13:01] trying to bring it out the best way I
[1:13:03] can so you can be able to grab it now
[1:13:05] because when you look at this most of
[1:13:09] the time we we it almost looks like uh
[1:13:14] uh uh
[1:13:16] uh you have to realize that that the the
[1:13:19] the H the way we have buil uh uh uh we
[1:13:24] we are able to to describe things or see
[1:13:27] things either uh in a form or shape
[1:13:32] all with a
[1:13:35] color the best way we can be able to
[1:13:37] describe something you either say is
[1:13:39] white or you say it's like a square it's
[1:13:41] it's either takes a form of a shape or
[1:13:44] you know or a color our our our our
[1:13:47] senses of seeing is designed that way
[1:13:50] for and and that's how things get our
[1:13:55] attention praise the
[1:14:07] Lord but here in the mess Ching of a
[1:14:10] bride he also says he says this here he
[1:14:13] says the church has become in these days
[1:14:17] with its achievement and all other
[1:14:19] manmade achievement is becoming
[1:14:24] scientific they are trying to make a
[1:14:27] scientific Church by the attraction of
[1:14:32] pictures and great steeple now just like
[1:14:36] I
[1:14:37] said that's that's the thing that aeach
[1:14:39] to the human sense of
[1:14:42] seeing okay if either uh uh I mean
[1:14:47] nothing against it I mean if if the Lord
[1:14:49] ever bless us with a church that have a
[1:14:52] great staple we will love it but you see
[1:14:54] that's that is the way that the human
[1:14:58] eyes I mean it has to be uh a building
[1:15:01] and a cross on top as soon as you see it
[1:15:04] you say that's a church
[1:15:07] right it takes that description or maybe
[1:15:11] like we have in the front of our church
[1:15:13] Good
[1:15:14] Shepherd Good Shepherd
[1:15:16] Fellowship as soon as you see it if if a
[1:15:19] person ever have any sense of the Bible
[1:15:21] Good Shepherd oh yeah good Shepherd
[1:15:23] Jesus is the Good Shepherd so that's the
[1:15:25] church
[1:15:27] right you see the church like brother B
[1:15:30] is saying the church in its approach in
[1:15:34] its achievement has taken a scientific
[1:15:37] approach by either attracting people by
[1:15:41] the building or by the words that we put
[1:15:44] on it now if you realize now you go
[1:15:47] around you will see there are many
[1:15:49] churches that have this electronic sign
[1:15:51] board like I said nothing wrong with
[1:15:54] right amen if I have the money we will
[1:15:56] put one out there right and we put our
[1:15:59] owner message it just be coming up and
[1:16:02] down nothing wrong with it but what I'm
[1:16:06] trying to bring to your mind is that
[1:16:09] that is the church on the approach of
[1:16:12] attracting people
[1:16:15] right God approach of attracting people
[1:16:19] is his
[1:16:22] word amen are we together am God way of
[1:16:27] attracting us is his
[1:16:31] Worden praise the
[1:16:33] Lord and the truth about the matter
[1:16:36] there is
[1:16:37] there you you get attracted to the word
[1:16:41] because of what God put in
[1:16:46] you the thing that magnetize you that
[1:16:49] attracts you to the word is not your
[1:16:52] senses
[1:16:55] no it's the seed of God that is in
[1:17:00] you praise the
[1:17:03] Lord because men with uh with with with
[1:17:06] education and and and degrees they can
[1:17:09] read this very same word and they get so
[1:17:12] confused to them the Bible just contrad
[1:17:15] itself all over the
[1:17:17] place but you can take the word and read
[1:17:19] it and it's just an amen thank you Jesus
[1:17:23] oh glory be to God oh Lord Jesus you are
[1:17:29] wonderful praise the Lord because men
[1:17:32] thinks the thing that will attract them
[1:17:35] today is to go to Bible school or to get
[1:17:38] a high learning you see we we we we are
[1:17:40] trying to make our attraction away from
[1:17:44] us that's what I want to I want us to be
[1:17:46] able to grab
[1:17:48] tonight we are making our attraction
[1:17:52] away from us
[1:17:53] he said our attraction will be to our
[1:17:57] husband the the husband is not different
[1:17:59] from the
[1:18:01] wife actually with a covenant of
[1:18:04] marriage they are one
[1:18:08] right are we
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:13] together so we realize that that
[1:18:16] prophecy is more is more beyond our our
[1:18:20] sexual desire our fleshly desire God was
[1:18:23] bringing us up to a higher
[1:18:28] calling the church in his scientific
[1:18:32] achievement have made great
[1:18:35] stles highrise building just make just
[1:18:39] make it in a in a V shape put a cross to
[1:18:41] the top or we just put you know a whole
[1:18:45] Bible verse on our building anybody come
[1:18:48] and read it they know straight that this
[1:18:49] is a church right praise the Lord amen
[1:18:54] amen amen if you go right at the back of
[1:18:57] the building there before you get out
[1:18:59] there uh you will see some kind of a
[1:19:01] cross standing the uh right on nail to
[1:19:03] the building I P that day I asked a
[1:19:07] brother to do that and I took white tape
[1:19:10] and taped the wood just to make it
[1:19:15] white praise the Lord it sound funny to
[1:19:20] you amen because many times sometimes I
[1:19:24] you know I I I stay right here and and
[1:19:26] people comes to see me and I say come
[1:19:28] right to the to the stop sign when you
[1:19:30] drive down a sister now right to the
[1:19:31] stop sign the church is on your right
[1:19:33] they come they drive down they says oh I
[1:19:35] didn't see a church I said right to the
[1:19:37] stop sign when you get to the stop sign
[1:19:39] the fourway stop sign the church is
[1:19:41] right across
[1:19:42] there I said okay I know what I'll do I
[1:19:45] need to put a cross on this
[1:19:49] building so when they come they see the
[1:19:51] white crow oh yeah okay this is is the
[1:19:53] church brother Bram say is our
[1:19:56] scientific way of attracting
[1:19:59] people are you getting the idea it's our
[1:20:03] scientific way it's man
[1:20:06] way praise the Lord because God's word
[1:20:09] is that he don't look at the building to
[1:20:12] be the church is the
[1:20:14] people the beauty of the church is the
[1:20:17] character of the
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:21] people amen amen yes
[1:20:25] sir are we grapping the picture amen are
[1:20:29] you seeing what I'm driving to
[1:20:33] tonight so our
[1:20:36] attraction is not the flashy things
[1:20:39] around us
[1:20:41] right those things are more
[1:20:44] distraction yes our
[1:20:48] attraction is the thing that God is
[1:20:51] doing amen amen amen in the corner of
[1:20:56] our
[1:21:01] heart the thing that he's doing in the
[1:21:05] corner of our heart dealing with our
[1:21:12] conscience because that's the thing that
[1:21:16] has more
[1:21:20] value praise the Lord amen
[1:21:26] amen I'm not going to take the time to
[1:21:28] blast social media
[1:21:30] tonight and uh none of
[1:21:34] that but we see all of the things you
[1:21:37] know that uh that happen on social media
[1:21:40] if we if you have one you see all the
[1:21:42] comparison and you see all the things
[1:21:44] that people uh you know and and and uh
[1:21:47] which of course with with the statistics
[1:21:50] it have puted this generation into
[1:21:52] crisis
[1:21:54] right many young people have got so
[1:21:57] disturbed by their minds because of the
[1:21:59] pictures of other that you see on on
[1:22:02] Facebook and different social media Tik
[1:22:04] Tok and what what what out of you why
[1:22:08] because to them it looks like an
[1:22:13] attraction it looks
[1:22:15] like other are having great achievement
[1:22:20] and it seems to be attracted to that
[1:22:23] right why can't we go on the trip why
[1:22:25] can't we go scar
[1:22:27] diving right praise the Lord why can't
[1:22:30] we go and you know and and and all of
[1:22:32] that and and and uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:22:36] and and and and and and all of those
[1:22:38] things are appealing to the to the to
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:43] mind they want us to to to kind of for
[1:22:46] work hard and save money and uh uh uh so
[1:22:49] one day we can scar da or or or one day
[1:22:52] we can get on a cruise ship and or one
[1:22:55] day we can you know and and as as we see
[1:22:57] those things because they appearal to
[1:22:59] our eyes right we get attracted to
[1:23:05] that and right away we start Gathering
[1:23:08] Zeal and strength and thought to be able
[1:23:11] to want to do
[1:23:13] it even if we have to fake
[1:23:19] it it becomes appealing
[1:23:26] yeah you see what you see what I'm
[1:23:28] getting to yeah it looks like we are
[1:23:31] attracted to
[1:23:32] that but actually in a real
[1:23:36] sense it's a
[1:23:41] distraction praise the Lord if we just
[1:23:44] take it in a common sense for you know
[1:23:48] to help our young people to understand
[1:23:50] it's a distraction because for the
[1:23:52] matter of fact that is that you were
[1:23:55] never thinking about that until you saw
[1:23:57] that
[1:23:58] picture right praise the
[1:24:01] Lord you had your own agenda you had
[1:24:05] your own plans and and there were things
[1:24:06] that you wanted to do with your life and
[1:24:08] things you wanted to but now because
[1:24:10] something has come up on on on on Amazon
[1:24:14] or on YouTube or whatever wherever it
[1:24:16] have come up you saw it in the magazine
[1:24:18] or somebody spoke about it in
[1:24:20] school it starts to play with your
[1:24:24] mind and now it looks like you are
[1:24:27] attracted to that sure praise the Lord
[1:24:31] and every other thing that you that you
[1:24:33] you have planed to do you want you you
[1:24:35] just want to get rid of it and and I I
[1:24:37] just want to make sure that I have that
[1:24:40] all the boys are doing it or all the
[1:24:41] girls are doing it or I think it would
[1:24:43] be a fun thing when that person was
[1:24:45] saying man I was just imagine in my mind
[1:24:48] what will happen
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:53] praise the
[1:24:54] Lord that is more
[1:24:58] destruction than an
[1:25:02] attraction praise the
[1:25:05] Lord if an
[1:25:07] attraction
[1:25:09] is a feeling of
[1:25:13] Interest praise the Lord amen if an
[1:25:17] attraction is a feeling of
[1:25:20] Interest or a desire
[1:25:25] and you realize there are
[1:25:29] uh if I should see someone doing certain
[1:25:33] thing or dressing or whatever it is and
[1:25:35] I will be able to you know forget about
[1:25:38] my owner program and want to be like
[1:25:41] that person you realize that it's a
[1:25:48] distraction are we
[1:25:51] together is a
[1:25:55] distraction the promise here is that my
[1:26:00] desire will be to
[1:26:03] him and he will have the road over
[1:26:09] me praise the
[1:26:11] Lord our attraction will be to
[1:26:17] him and he will have the road over us
[1:26:23] so like I said from the
[1:26:26] beginning what is attracting us what
[1:26:28] what what is the
[1:26:30] attraction of uh
[1:26:34] 2024 let me read some few things here
[1:26:37] again as I try
[1:26:40] to to build myself
[1:26:43] together invisible Union see another
[1:26:47] example here that
[1:26:50] uh I just wonder we are always telling
[1:26:55] of the Beauty and the attraction of the
[1:26:58] church but we fail to tell them he that
[1:27:02] will follow me let him deny
[1:27:06] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:27:10] me I wonder if we hav't made the beauty
[1:27:14] of the church too pretty for the fellow
[1:27:19] that comes
[1:27:21] in praise the Lord now brother Bram is
[1:27:24] also using this sense to say how are we
[1:27:27] attracting people to the Lord what are
[1:27:29] we
[1:27:30] using right praise the
[1:27:33] Lord are we saying well that church is a
[1:27:36] Liberian
[1:27:42] church and when you go there you fear at
[1:27:44] home because there there's a bunch of
[1:27:46] liberians
[1:27:49] there all that church you he people
[1:27:52] people said it's a black church
[1:27:55] sure you know they
[1:27:57] played you know black
[1:28:02] gospel so he's using this s to say how
[1:28:05] are we attracting what what are we
[1:28:09] using to attract people to church
[1:28:14] right praise the lord we realize that on
[1:28:18] the days of Pentecost and like brother
[1:28:20] Bon was say Peter Paul a a a soap box
[1:28:23] down and he claim on that Soap Box and
[1:28:25] he started preaching the gospel and said
[1:28:28] men and breens let this be known unto
[1:28:30] you that we are not
[1:28:32] drunk but this is the promise that joah
[1:28:35] spoke about praise the Lord and the
[1:28:39] Bible says when he testified when he
[1:28:41] point the people to the promise of the
[1:28:44] Old Testament that have been fulfilled
[1:28:47] he pointed the people to a fulfillment
[1:28:50] of Prophecy
[1:28:54] are you seeing it's a fulfillment of
[1:28:56] Prophecy it was what God was doing in
[1:28:59] that
[1:29:00] mov and the Bible says after he finished
[1:29:04] preaching the hearts of the people were
[1:29:06] moved and they said what can we do to be
[1:29:11] safe praise the Lord he never pointed
[1:29:14] the people to a
[1:29:17] history you know we were on the boat
[1:29:19] with Jesus and he told me I should cast
[1:29:22] my
[1:29:24] net praise the Lord as truth as that
[1:29:27] story
[1:29:29] is amen as truth as the story
[1:29:34] is it was just not enough to capture the
[1:29:37] minds of the
[1:29:40] people it could look more like a man is
[1:29:43] building up taals but Peter was able to
[1:29:46] attract the people and bring their mind
[1:29:49] to the fulfilling of scripture in his
[1:29:51] day
[1:29:53] that's God attraction you love all
[1:29:56] through the
[1:29:59] Bible
[1:30:01] amen All Through the Bible how did God
[1:30:04] got the attention of
[1:30:07] Moses it was a fulfillment of scripture
[1:30:10] he told Abraham I will come down in the
[1:30:13] mighty I will come down amen and I will
[1:30:17] bring them out with a mighty
[1:30:20] hands and have the God came down in the
[1:30:23] burning
[1:30:25] bush he came down in the burning bush
[1:30:28] and that burning bush created an
[1:30:30] attraction for
[1:30:32] Moses there is nothing that have a
[1:30:35] drawing
[1:30:37] power than the fulfilling of God's
[1:30:43] word praise the Lord just talking about
[1:30:47] the story of how the seven Angel come
[1:30:49] down it's beautiful
[1:30:52] right but what is it all about what was
[1:30:56] it about
[1:31:01] yeah are you getting the
[1:31:04] picture you look all through the
[1:31:09] scripture whenever God was about to
[1:31:11] fulfill his word that fulfilling of the
[1:31:14] word always cause an
[1:31:18] attraction it create a desire
[1:31:23] amen it created an
[1:31:27] interest Moses was at the back of
[1:31:29] backside of the desert with his steak he
[1:31:31] has already chosen a a new career to
[1:31:35] follow
[1:31:38] sheeps but when God attracted him with
[1:31:41] the burning bush it created a new
[1:31:44] interest in his
[1:31:45] heart he said I'm going to
[1:31:48] Egypt to take
[1:31:50] over

[1:32:26] catch your
[1:32:27] attention let us be looking around for
[1:32:29] scriptures that will be
[1:32:32] fulfilled Even in our lives in the lives

[1:33:24] the truth of the matter there is that
[1:33:26] some of us will have it some of us will

[1:34:11] lives praise the Lord that's how the
[1:34:14] word will have prein if you if you look
[1:34:17] at uh uh uh uh the life of
[1:34:20] Daniel there in
[1:34:23] Babylon the Bible
[1:34:25] says he searched
[1:34:28] book he read the book of
[1:34:31] Jeremiah and the SW of aai and all of
[1:34:34] these
[1:34:36] prophecy because he had a burden
[1:34:38] concerning his
[1:34:40] people praise the
[1:34:42] Lord he was attracted to find out what
[1:34:46] what is going to happen to

[1:34:55] Lord
[1:34:57] amen if you realize let me just let me
[1:35:00] just hit one reality you one reality if
[1:35:04] you
[1:35:05] realize many years ago before we have
[1:35:10] all the uh the MP3 you know uh even the
[1:35:14] the CD and all of that you will see that
[1:35:18] uh even even even the days of the Bible
[1:35:22] before I come to the message even the
[1:35:25] days of the Bible before uh uh uh Luther
[1:35:30] came with his Revival because it was
[1:35:32] right in that time the printing press
[1:35:35] came
[1:35:36] public right at a time where the Holy
[1:35:39] Spirit was was anointing Luther to bring
[1:35:42] the message of the judge shall live by
[1:35:44] faith it was around the same time that
[1:35:47] the printing press got their explosion
[1:35:51] right
[1:35:52] but before
[1:35:54] then the Saints of old they were able to
[1:35:57] memorize that chapter not verses they
[1:36:01] could memorize an entire
[1:36:04] book because the Bible was not in public
[1:36:08] like that right if a person had just one
[1:36:13] sheet of the Bible it was a
[1:36:19] treasure it was a Tre
[1:36:22] me and at the very same time the
[1:36:25] Catholic church was burning people to
[1:36:27] the stake if you have a copy of the
[1:36:32] Bible because they never wanted it to be
[1:36:34] in the hands of the
[1:36:39] people and someone will tell you oh I
[1:36:42] find I I find the Book of Matthew a
[1:36:46] person may spend the whole night off

[1:42:25] an exploit of Technology even to the
[1:42:28] very same time of the printing press
[1:42:30] just so imagine that now the Bible is is
[1:42:35] is h i mean the Bible that the people
[1:42:37] could not even look
[1:42:39] upon now it has come in print do you
[1:42:42] realize how how precious it was to the
[1:42:45] homes of the
[1:42:47] believer praise the
[1:42:49] Lord
[1:42:51] until the father will not want for you
[1:42:53] to put anything on the Bible
[1:43:02] right he will want you to put anything
[1:43:04] on the
[1:43:06] Bible it was so
[1:43:09] precious but
[1:43:11] slowly that preciousness started getting
[1:43:14] away from the
[1:43:16] people the word that was precious now
[1:43:19] start becoming
[1:43:23] common it start becoming
[1:43:25] common because we have NIV we have good
[1:43:30] news we have King James King James
[1:43:32] language is too high we have we have uh
[1:43:36] Revis
[1:43:38] version praise the
[1:43:40] Lord until now they want to give us an L
[1:43:44] ltbg or what tbg
[1:43:49] Bible
[1:43:51] the word that was so precious is now
[1:43:53] becoming so
[1:43:56] common it's becoming so
[1:44:01] common and when it becomes so common
[1:44:03] like this it loses value that we can we
[1:44:06] can argue I love this translation over
[1:44:09] this translation this translation said
[1:44:11] it's explain amplifier says this this
[1:44:13] this this it gave more brother it just
[1:44:15] attract I mean
[1:44:19] distraction the commonness of the
[1:44:22] word what is it doing it's just dividing
[1:44:25] us we argue we fuss with one another we
[1:44:28] are not edifying one another when the
[1:44:31] word was precious a person would read
[1:44:34] bro come and see come and I read
[1:44:35] something today man come and see yeah
[1:44:38] bro when you fin reading that book give
[1:44:39] it to
[1:44:40] me it was
[1:44:44] precious praise the
[1:44:47] Lord but when it becomes common what
[1:44:49] happened I I I I read no let me read it
[1:44:52] in NIV that thing you reading you know
[1:44:55] because the King James that were King J
[1:44:57] language that King J language is too
[1:44:58] high let me read it in NV let me break
[1:45:00] it
[1:45:02] down and I'll read it in the good news
[1:45:06] which is the Catholic
[1:45:08] H H setting of a
[1:45:15] Bible as as as all the publication and
[1:45:19] the printing increased
[1:45:23] is we hearing different names of all the
[1:45:27] different printing it looks like it's an
[1:45:30] attraction even sometimes you know the
[1:45:33] the design on the
[1:45:36] Bible they make it classet they put it
[1:45:39] in the bag you can you can zip it on you
[1:45:41] can zip it
[1:45:45] in some is partable you can fit it right
[1:45:48] in your bag I mean it taking a shap and
[1:45:51] form right but you see it's not creating
[1:45:55] an attraction it creating a lot of
[1:46:01] distraction because now we can argue
[1:46:03] about
[1:46:04] wor we can def with with with with
[1:46:08] definition
[1:46:10] right so when you bring it even to our

[1:51:11] going to be destroying poverty it's not
[1:51:14] my
[1:51:15] portion praise the Lord am but when you
[1:51:18] look into the word
[1:51:21] you will see that God speaks to the sem
[1:51:23] that church
[1:51:25] age and he says I Know Thy
[1:51:29] poverty but thou I
[1:51:35] rich praise the Lord amen amen and if
[1:51:39] you really you really look at it the
[1:51:43] richest man in the word there's a place

[1:51:52] he's
[1:51:54] ped praise the
[1:51:56] Lord some of them that the wealth has
[1:51:58] ruined their family

[1:52:50] good job you don't but the area where
[1:52:52] you are rich you are not seeing it

[1:52:56] to the church I know your poverty I know
[1:52:59] what you are going through but with God
[1:53:02] in our
[1:53:03] mess the one that have 10,000 cattles on

[1:53:52] plac those law there he plac it in our
[1:53:55] life the law of contract is in our
[1:54:02] life let us not reduce our God to
[1:54:05] material things and and and and and
[1:54:07] physical things and other things people
[1:54:09] have
[1:54:18] right
[1:54:20] are we together
[1:54:24] tonight he says I want to we are always
[1:54:26] telling the Beauty and the attraction of
[1:54:29] the
[1:54:30] church but we fa to tell them that Jesus
[1:54:34] said he that follow me let him deny
[1:54:37] himself take up his
[1:54:40] cross praise the
[1:54:42] Lord take of his
[1:54:48] cross just like the the the public the
[1:54:51] the the popular gospel people preach
[1:54:53] give your life to Jesus all your trouble
[1:54:55] will be ended right when the people give
[1:54:57] their life then the whole hell is
[1:54:59] against them right they realize that oh

[1:55:36] cards and things to come to
[1:55:40] church praise the Lord I think it's time
[1:55:44] for a prayer meeting or something to
[1:55:46] take place in the
[1:55:48] church praise the
[1:55:53] Lord the church has lost its attraction

[1:56:03] form you look you look there in the book
[1:56:06] of Deuteronomy chapter
[1:56:08] 8 this famous scripture that Jesus
[1:56:14] used men shall not live by bread
[1:56:17] alone but by every word that proceed out

[1:56:23] children of Israel when the Lord came on
[1:56:26] the mountain he never took no visible
[1:56:29] form right for us to be attracted to
[1:56:33] form
[1:56:36] shapes and
[1:56:39] colors the thing that attracted us was
[1:56:42] the word man shall live by not by bread
[1:56:46] alone but by the word of
[1:56:48] God
[1:56:51] the word is our
[1:56:59] attraction praise the
[1:57:03] Lord as we go into the coming
[1:57:08] year with a promise that Christ will
[1:57:12] have a bride a people that the world

[1:57:26] the root over us he having the
[1:57:28] preeminence in our home the preeminence

[1:58:33] lord we will never be able to achieve
[1:58:36] and enjoy the benefit of the
[1:58:40] Cross if we put the word in second

[2:08:15] year because as I look into the word
[2:08:19] that's the thing that God is attracted
[2:08:23] to when his people are submitting
[2:08:27] himself for the Fulfillment of his
[2:08:31] word praise the

[3:30:06] of God and we are claiming them tonight
[3:30:10] in the name of Jesus for the kingdom of
[3:30:13] God that they would not find pleasure in
[3:30:16] anything of the world that they would
[3:30:18] not find comfort in sin that there would
[3:30:22] not be any place in the world for them
[3:30:26] that they will have to turn back that
[3:30:28] they are going to hit a brick wall and
[3:30:30] turn back that the only place they will
[3:30:32] find comfort is in the arms of the
[3:30:34] almighty God there is room in his arms
[3:30:39] there is love in his
[3:30:41] arms for every one of us and we pray
[3:30:45] committing them into the hands of the

[3:47:44] Saints uh the
[3:47:47] Lord the Lord has been dealing with me
[3:47:50] in various
[3:47:53] ways but keep it
[3:48:01] short we know the prophet taught us and
[3:48:05] he preached
[3:48:08] about the
[3:48:10] greatest fight ever
[3:48:13] fought is in the
[3:48:16] mind the
[3:48:18] devil will try each and every
[3:48:22] way each and every
[3:48:25] scheme just to come and bring that
[3:48:29] thought that will bring
[3:48:33] discouragement unbelief
[3:48:36] [Music]
[3:48:38] fear
[3:48:42] and all that that it carries
[3:48:47] hatred and
[3:48:49] loving all
[3:48:51] that and if you notice brothers and
[3:48:54] sisters if that comes
[3:48:57] [Music]
[3:49:00] in you'll not see a sister or a brother
[3:49:03] as a
[3:49:07] sister and that brother that sister just
[3:49:10] the Bible
[3:49:11] says pray for one another maybe that
[3:49:15] brother or that sister that the devil
[3:49:18] has put in your mind not to like him not
[3:49:22] to like her not to appreciate that
[3:49:25] person you'll not go and get a prayer
[3:49:27] from that person but the Lord has put
[3:49:29] that prayer burden on that
[3:49:32] person I'm speaking to myself
[3:49:35] too that may the
[3:49:38] Lord give me the spirit of humble that I
[3:49:41] humble
[3:49:45] myself that when a prayer request
[3:49:49] comes that when a thought
[3:49:52] comes that you will come
[3:49:54] down cast down our imaginations our
[3:49:58] thoughts our reasoning and we come in
[3:50:00] that level of brother and sister in
[3:50:03] Christ you can hold a pre uh your fellow
[3:50:07] brother's hands or sister fellow
[3:50:10] sister's hands and pray with that person
[3:50:13] until you break through
[3:50:15] yes Lord we thank
[3:50:19] you as you go to
[3:50:22] prayer that will be my prayer that the
[3:50:24] Lord will come down that we will humble
[3:50:27] ourselves we will humble our hearts not
[3:50:29] see our

[4:20:32] have shared and forgot to share I didn't
[4:20:37] didn't share and then I forgot to share
[4:20:40] can you hear me no just used this one
[4:20:42] used this
[4:20:45] one same um
[4:20:50] anyway I was uh I had to work one
[4:20:53] night uh let's see what was it uh it was
[4:20:56] when we were having cold weather we're
[4:20:58] having cold weather now for a period of
[4:21:00] time we weren't having cold weather but
[4:21:02] we had cold weather and we had uh uh it
[4:21:06] was a a a Rainy Night a snowy night and
[4:21:10] it was icy and so at the school they
[4:21:13] were having some activities and so I had
[4:21:16] to go in to Salt everything so that uh
[4:21:20] it wouldn't be slippery for everybody so
[4:21:23] I went in and I I did that I was uh
[4:21:26] supposed to be a let's see I went in for
[4:21:29] a couple hours I and then I clocked out
[4:21:33] and I went out to my car to leave and I
[4:21:35] realized I didn't have my key it's like
[4:21:38] where's my key I couldn't find my key
[4:21:41] and so I um so I you know I thought well
[4:21:43] maybe I left it I couldn't imagine where
[4:21:46] I left it but and I thought well J was
[4:21:49] it in the car did I lock it in the car
[4:21:51] so I called my
[4:21:53] wife and asked her if she could come
[4:21:56] bring the other key because I always
[4:21:58] keep a spare key I just didn't have with
[4:22:00] me so I called her she's going to bring
[4:22:03] the key and um so took a while to get
[4:22:07] there but she brought the key well she
[4:22:11] was determined that we were going to
[4:22:13] find the key I
[4:22:15] lost so we looked I mean I I I emptied
[4:22:18] like I went through like 10 bags of salt
[4:22:21] she took every bag out of the trash and
[4:22:23] looked through every bag so she made me
[4:22:26] retrace my steps so I had to retrace my
[4:22:30] steps and it was cold out it was windy
[4:22:31] it was cold and I went everywhere where
[4:22:33] I where I'd thrown the salt and
[4:22:37] and so that was one side of the building
[4:22:39] we went to the other side of the
[4:22:39] building and it was the last place we
[4:22:42] went to and there was my key right in
[4:22:45] the middle of the road which cars had
[4:22:47] been traveling could have they could
[4:22:48] have easily ran over my key you know
[4:22:50] it's it's one of those keys that it's
[4:22:52] not a really fancy one but it's one of
[4:22:54] those you know that you can open your
[4:22:56] doors with and stuff it would if they
[4:22:57] ran over it it would have been bad news
[4:23:00] and uh so I just really thank the Lord
[4:23:02] thank the Lord for my wife for her
[4:23:04] determination to make sure that uh I
[4:23:07] searched for this key uh I was I was
[4:23:10] happy just to leave with one key and
[4:23:12] then I'd get another key later but she
[4:23:14] wanted to make sure I found that key so
[4:23:17] I thank the Lord for and I thank the
[4:23:18] Lord that that I found the key so
[4:23:25] anyway thank you sister

[4:25:44] stuff yeah so I recently visited a home
[4:25:48] that's bam in Ghana and uh I had a
[4:25:52] couple of meetings that I needed to
[4:25:54] attend to so um my last
[4:25:58] meeting uh it was a little delayed so I
[4:26:01] had to reschedule my flight to make sure
[4:26:04] I attended the meeting
[4:26:07] um so I I I initially wanted to come
[4:26:10] back here on the 7th of December but I
[4:26:15] rescheduled it till the 11th and uh I
[4:26:19] went my with my green card I flew there
[4:26:22] with my passport my Gan passport so
[4:26:25] coming back I would have Flo with my I
[4:26:27] mean I flew here with my green
[4:26:29] card on the 11th I was trying to put my
[4:26:32] stuff together I had my back packed but
[4:26:35] I was just just putting the last stuff
[4:26:37] together and then it just dawn on
[4:26:40] me the Lord had giving me an instruction
[4:26:43] to do something so I did that and then I
[4:26:48] was like let me check for my green card
[4:26:51] to see if it's still in there cuz I was
[4:26:54] going to fly that
[4:26:56] evening and this was around 2 something
[4:26:59] 23 so I checked my card holder and my
[4:27:03] green card wasn't in there and it was
[4:27:05] still only only cut that was was
[4:27:10] missing that has never happened to me
[4:27:13] before so I was a little bit confused
[4:27:18] and I got on my knees go my prayer show
[4:27:22] covering me and I prayed then the lord
[4:27:25] gave me a certain peace in my heart even
[4:27:27] though I didn't understand what was
[4:27:30] happening but he gave me some peace in
[4:27:32] my heart that all was
[4:27:34] well so I got
[4:27:37] up yeah I got up and I think the next
[4:27:42] day he pointed he pointed me in a
[4:27:44] certain direction to go look there but
[4:27:48] the voice was so
[4:27:50] small I overlooked it I was like maybe
[4:27:54] I'll do that later let me just check my
[4:27:57] bags so I looked through all my luggage
[4:28:00] and I go even another person came in and
[4:28:03] helped me even I mean I mean two more
[4:28:06] sets of eyes to be better so I go I
[4:28:09] called another person and they came in
[4:28:12] helped me look to the back we turn
[4:28:14] everything upside down look through all
[4:28:16] the zippers there was there was
[4:28:19] nothing so I was using an SUV and then I
[4:28:23] told my car dealer I needed him to
[4:28:26] change my um my car for me
[4:28:30] cuz I had I had gone to the Airlines and
[4:28:33] they told me I wouldn't be able to fly I
[4:28:35] had a copy of it on my my my laptop so I
[4:28:38] wouldn't be able to fly with it so I had
[4:28:41] to go to the Embassy to talk to them and
[4:28:44] they took me through some
[4:28:45] process the long story short it was
[4:28:48] going to take me at least 21 days to get
[4:28:52] it to get something called boarding foil
[4:28:55] so when I get here then I can uh work on
[4:28:58] getting a a
[4:29:00] replacement but I think the day I went
[4:29:04] to the Embassy
[4:29:06] um two days
[4:29:09] afterwards the Lord LED my my feet to
[4:29:12] one of my Prophet friends and then we
[4:29:16] prayed after the prayer he told me the
[4:29:19] donkey is not lost oh my
[4:29:22] God he told me that story about the
[4:29:25] donkey and then uh
[4:29:27] Saul I'm not sure he even knew what he
[4:29:30] was talking about but God was talking to
[4:29:32] me and I didn't understand it my my my
[4:29:35] brain was just clouded with like what
[4:29:39] can I do give me direction God was
[4:29:41] giving me direction but I was not
[4:29:44] listening so the next day uh I gave my
[4:29:48] car to the the dealer and then had the
[4:29:51] brother that um so this was what
[4:29:54] happened when uh my the prophet friend
[4:29:56] was praying for me I talked to him about
[4:29:59] the C situation that this is my case
[4:30:02] right now I was going to I'm going to be
[4:30:03] staying here for the next 24 hour 21
[4:30:06] days at least so I needed a car change
[4:30:09] so I can cut down my cost and then I'll
[4:30:12] take care of the other stuff so we
[4:30:14] talked to one brother they called one
[4:30:16] brother in and they talked to him and
[4:30:18] then he got me another car so it was the
[4:30:21] next day that I was supposed to meet him
[4:30:23] and then take that car and give my the
[4:30:26] the one I was using to the dealer so I
[4:30:29] called the dealer and then I gave him a
[4:30:31] place a location to come meet me so he
[4:30:33] came and met me I I handed a about the
[4:30:35] car to him and I was waiting for the
[4:30:38] other brother to come meet me there so I
[4:30:40] could take the other car but I waited
[4:30:43] for like an hour plus he didn't come so
[4:30:46] later on he called me and when I picked
[4:30:49] up he was
[4:30:51] like uh the traic situation from where
[4:30:53] he was to my place it was headach so I
[4:30:57] should just come meet him at a different
[4:30:59] place and where he mentioned was exactly
[4:31:02] where the Lord pointed me to go look
[4:31:06] so when he mentioned that it just dawn
[4:31:08] on me you were supposed to go there you
[4:31:11] did not so go
[4:31:13] check so I went and met him there and
[4:31:16] then I was like could you please drive
[4:31:18] me to this so and so ATM and let me
[4:31:20] check something he went and park in
[4:31:23] there and then I went and spoke with the
[4:31:25] security guard and he asked me two very
[4:31:28] interesting questions what car were you

[4:31:35] it and he said wait I was
[4:31:39] anxious I was like what are you talking
[4:31:42] about why are you asking me specific
[4:31:43] questions so I was just waiting and then
[4:31:45] he went into his backpack pulled out the
[4:31:48] card I'm like Am I Dreaming or
[4:31:51] what I've been looking for it all all
[4:31:55] over I mean I've i' used a lot of ATMs
[4:31:58] to withraw cash but the Lord did not
[4:32:00] point me to any of them he pointed me in
[4:32:03] this direction and I did not go there
[4:32:05] cuz the voice was very
[4:32:08] small I thank God for the Lost donkey

[4:32:31] Lord yeah
[4:32:34] yeah
[4:32:40] God bless you s uh uh we just want to
[4:32:44] thank the Lord for stepping into a new
[4:32:45] year um I'm just standing here first of
[4:32:49] all to just thank God for keeping us me
[4:32:51] and my my wife and the whole family life
[4:32:54] is just a miracle by
[4:32:56] itself um and I know the my family we
[4:33:00] just went through a really hardship and
[4:33:04] uh it's it's fun that you know the Lord
[4:33:06] Works in various way and and during as
[4:33:10] we were crossing this
[4:33:12] hardship you know uh I really want to
[4:33:15] remember people that were praying with
[4:33:17] us and brother one I think even our
[4:33:20] parents did not know you know we're not
[4:33:22] aware of it but brother the one was
[4:33:24] there to pray along with us and we we
[4:33:27] really appreciate him you know uh I'm
[4:33:32] I'm going to say something not because
[4:33:34] it's here but we have a good pastor
[4:33:37] there's a lot of things that he does
[4:33:39] people don't see it it's mostly you know
[4:33:43] and and I've traveled with him I I spend
[4:33:46] a lot of time brother one you know um we
[4:33:50] have a good pastor he has the burden for
[4:33:54] for for us and that's that's a blessing
[4:33:56] that you can ever ask in the world you
[4:33:58] know um he was there praying for us you
[4:34:02] know really honest and very direct to us
[4:34:05] us and he has been a blessing to us and
[4:34:07] we really appreciate him we want to
[4:34:09] really say to him
[4:34:11] directly uh but based on the things that
[4:34:14] we we Crossing there's different
[4:34:16] scriptures that were coming in my mind
[4:34:17] and and I'm even shaking right now
[4:34:20] because I'm a little
[4:34:22] nervous uh because God was pointing me
[4:34:24] to something you know and I think if
[4:34:27] they can help us there's few scripture I
[4:34:29] want to read here and I hope there can
[4:34:30] be an encouragement to you uh Isaiah
[4:34:34] 558
[4:34:38] uh that was really powerful he really
[4:34:40] encouraged my heart it says for my
[4:34:43] thoughts uh okay I'll just read it it
[4:34:46] says for my thoughts are not your
[4:34:48] thoughts neither are your way my ways
[4:34:51] sayth the Lord for as the heavens are
[4:34:54] higher than the earth so are my ways
[4:34:57] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[4:34:59] than your
[4:35:01] thoughts and it brought me again to
[4:35:04] Romans chapter 8 verse
[4:35:07] 28 it says and we know all things work
[4:35:11] together for good to them that love God
[4:35:14] Amen to them who are called according to
[4:35:18] his purpose yes you know it did not say
[4:35:21] some things he said all you know as as
[4:35:25] human being you you're Crossing you're
[4:35:27] going through
[4:35:29] hardship you ask a lot of question you
[4:35:32] even Beyond you start thinking you even
[4:35:34] go beyond you say Lord did I sin did
[4:35:37] somebody sin and sometime you can't even
[4:35:39] blame other people you know is it
[4:35:41] somebody's fault that all this things
[4:35:43] are happening then God start ministering
[4:35:46] to me you know he gave me an example you
[4:35:49] know he start ministering to me
[4:35:51] different stories in the Bible to look
[4:35:53] at it in a different angle you know
[4:35:55] sometime you would just read the Bible
[4:35:56] like oh I know the story you know but I
[4:35:59] start questioning like why would God
[4:36:02] create
[4:36:04] Lucifer
[4:36:05] and eventually you know it will be the
[4:36:07] right-handed man he created literally
[4:36:09] his own enemy but to display his power
[4:36:12] it must sound to be negative why would
[4:36:14] he do it but he had a purpose he the
[4:36:17] mass of all things why would he create
[4:36:20] something that he eventually fight him
[4:36:23] and he knows that he will overcome it
[4:36:26] but in all of it he has a
[4:36:28] thought you know the story of Jonah came
[4:36:31] into my mind and which really struck
[4:36:34] me if you look at the story of Jonah God
[4:36:37] told him and said go to
[4:36:40] Nineveh it was a direct command we will
[4:36:43] say this was God's perfect will to go to
[4:36:46] Nineveh he disobeyed he went to
[4:36:49] tares and when he went to tares you know
[4:36:52] he got in trouble and all of it which is
[4:36:54] the side that trouble comes into our
[4:36:56] life right and you look at it it comes
[4:37:00] and the the the the well comes and
[4:37:02] swallows him and he stays in the in the
[4:37:05] the in the belly of the well for three
[4:37:06] days and three nights and eventually the
[4:37:09] story turns into him going back to
[4:37:11] Nineveh you know but there's something
[4:37:14] that caught my attention
[4:37:16] if uh Jonah way is the permissive will
[4:37:21] right and God's perfect will was to go
[4:37:24] to Nineveh then if you look continue
[4:37:27] later on in the scripture the sign of
[4:37:29] the Resurrection that Jesus used it was
[4:37:33] based on the three days and three nights
[4:37:36] yeah so if Jonah did not go to tares
[4:37:40] which was the permissive will of God
[4:37:42] yeah that's right God will now refer to
[4:37:45] that scripture later on yeah so I looked
[4:37:48] at it said you see a permissive will to
[4:37:51] an elect of God even if it sound to be
[4:37:53] permissive God would turn it into a
[4:37:55] perfect that's right so God start
[4:37:58] ministering to my heart and different
[4:38:00] stories start opening can you imagine
[4:38:02] another story of RAB for instance you
[4:38:05] look at the story of RAB God sends
[4:38:07] Israel to Egypt and stuff he say you
[4:38:09] know you'll go for 40 days I mean you
[4:38:12] leave Egypt and go to the promised land
[4:38:15] it was a short distance but it took them
[4:38:17] 40 years so which means that if they
[4:38:20] went directly from from Egypt or maybe
[4:38:24] the Red Sea to the promised land
[4:38:27] directly RAB would never come into a
[4:38:29] picture because she was not even born
[4:38:30] yet so the 40 years that the stay in the
[4:38:34] Wilderness was for a purpose God was
[4:38:37] looking at an elect son or an elect
[4:38:39] daughter of God and you can't see it
[4:38:42] through out the scripture even David God
[4:38:45] told him don't number the people of
[4:38:48] God he went and numbered and the Bible
[4:38:51] says Satan pushed David to number the
[4:38:54] people so God used Satan to literally do
[4:38:58] something and if you read the Bible at
[4:39:00] the end you realize in number of the
[4:39:02] people God gave him three choices
[4:39:06] judgment comes is struck him but yet if
[4:39:08] you continue the very place that David
[4:39:12] buil the alt that was in
[4:39:14] Jerusalem so if he had not numbered the
[4:39:17] people David would never have the vision
[4:39:19] of Jerusalem so you can't see it
[4:39:22] throughout the scripture that in our
[4:39:24] life it might sense to be negative but
[4:39:27] there is a purpose behind it that's
[4:39:29] right that's right you know this is
[4:39:32] something you know I'm saying it with a
[4:39:34] broken heart just after losing a child
[4:39:37] but I want to encourage you to as you
[4:39:39] stepping into a new year as if you of
[4:39:42] course you're a Son of God and a
[4:39:43] daughter of God you may not see the
[4:39:45] positive side of it but you need God to
[4:39:48] open your eyes to see it that at the end
[4:39:50] of the road is a purpose and of course
[4:39:52] there's a lot you know we all praying
[4:39:54] for the young people and all of it which
[4:39:56] is a good thing but as they are out
[4:39:58] there you don't know how God is dealing
[4:40:01] with them yes and if they come they come
[4:40:04] back with conviction no man can take
[4:40:06] that out of them you see so he it helps
[4:40:09] us to to leave the religion out of it
[4:40:12] but to have a personal experience you
[4:40:14] know so God really ministered to me
[4:40:17] lately I mean these past days he has
[4:40:19] come to me really strong and I'm I'm
[4:40:22] going to conclude with this scripture
[4:40:24] here there there's two more but we don't
[4:40:27] have time anyways um Ephesians chapter 1
[4:40:31] verse
[4:40:33] 3 it says blessed be the god of our
[4:40:36] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[4:40:38] blessed us with all spiritual blesses
[4:40:42] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[4:40:45] according has he has chosen Us in him so
[4:40:49] we were in him before the foundation of
[4:40:52] the
[4:40:53] world it says that we should be
[4:40:57] holy and without blemish before him in
[4:41:00] love so the Holiness is not literally
[4:41:03] our Holiness it was something that was
[4:41:05] already done it's a finished work
[4:41:07] actually that's right having
[4:41:09] predestinated us that's the past tense
[4:41:12] you know English is my second language
[4:41:14] but obviously there's a d the end you
[4:41:16] know that means the
[4:41:18] past having predestinated us onto the
[4:41:21] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[4:41:25] himself
[4:41:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[4:41:30] will in whom also we have obtained aain
[4:41:35] an
[4:41:36] inheritance being
[4:41:39] predestinated according to the purpose
[4:41:42] of him who worketh all things after the
[4:41:47] counsel of his own
[4:41:49] will so everything that we're crossing
[4:41:52] there is a purpose that God is he has
[4:41:54] that in his mind he's focused and knows
[4:41:56] exactly what he want to fulfill and as
[4:41:59] the Pastor said this morning he will use
[4:42:01] our body yes to fulfill that very same
[4:42:05] thing that he want to do so that at the
[4:42:07] end of the of the game you turn back you
[4:42:09] say oh God that's
[4:42:11] you you have done it you have started to
[4:42:14] he I mean just look at why we here we're
[4:42:17] here because of a certain purpose that
[4:42:19] God already saw we could have died as a
[4:42:20] young person but we've reached a certain
[4:42:23] age you wonder how did I get here that's
[4:42:26] right you know I wonder that you know
[4:42:28] there there's a lot I went to college
[4:42:30] and I mean I went to different places
[4:42:33] the Lord kept me
[4:42:35] at the same time he kept my
[4:42:38] wife you know even my wife to be there
[4:42:41] is just a miracle I mean I I lived in in
[4:42:44] Virginia I fell a pool to go to North
[4:42:46] Carolina for some reason you know few
[4:42:49] years
[4:42:50] ago I fell the pool I didn't know
[4:42:53] why because it wasn't just the right
[4:42:55] time she was not ready then I was not
[4:42:58] ready then just looking at us if it were
[4:43:01] if it happened at that time no we
[4:43:03] wouldn't even talk
[4:43:07] you know but all things work for good
[4:43:09] you know and if I had been in another
[4:43:12] location than this location we would not
[4:43:14] even be together if we did not have a
[4:43:16] pastor we would not even be together
[4:43:19] because there is a certain PL there's a
[4:43:21] certain part that he played into our
[4:43:23] relationship and we appreciate that a
[4:43:25] lot brother one may God bless you and
[4:43:27] all the saints God bless you thank you I
[4:43:29] appreciate
[4:43:30] [Applause]
[4:43:33] it
[4:43:39] the clock is clicking okay sister Tera I
[4:43:41] see your
[4:43:47] hands
[4:43:52] Emmanuel that's a young
[4:43:57] technician I really want to thank God
[4:44:00] for the family of
[4:44:02] God um it has been like 13 years that we
[4:44:05] moved to
[4:44:10] us as I grew
[4:44:13] up my mother never like us to go her way
[4:44:17] kind of like even
[4:44:19] for
[4:44:22] sleepover my daughter has been asking me
[4:44:24] for sleepover for a few times I told her
[4:44:26] I never go I never went for sleepover I
[4:44:28] don't know what is it
[4:44:32] so yeah but I I really want to thank God
[4:44:35] for the family of God because when you
[4:44:38] grow up you're so attached to your
[4:44:40] biologic family you don't really see the
[4:44:43] importance of other people in your life
[4:44:46] but in this place I have learned the
[4:44:49] importance of the family of God 4 years
[4:44:52] ago I decided to go back to
[4:44:55] school that's the time I had Karen and
[4:44:58] it was by surgery all my three children
[4:45:01] was
[4:45:03] surgery
[4:45:05] I really thank
[4:45:07] God because at that time I didn't know
[4:45:09] how I would handle it I had
[4:45:12] samel he was only two years old and he
[4:45:15] was so
[4:45:21] active that's
[4:45:23] true and then while I was in the
[4:45:26] hospital brother Marx told me that
[4:45:28] sister Bridget and sister relle will
[4:45:30] come to stay with us I say
[4:45:34] this is a
[4:45:37] blessing and then they came they stay
[4:45:39] with me and it was really a
[4:45:42] blessing to stay with them for that
[4:45:45] period of time I could not I could I was
[4:45:48] not able to hold my child because I
[4:45:51] could not U order like 10 pound more
[4:45:56] because of the
[4:45:57] surgery so I really thank God for
[4:46:01] them and then when I decided to go back
[4:46:04] to
[4:46:05] school it was not also
[4:46:10] easy I was always tired you have to

[4:46:31] strength to do
[4:46:32] it he said okay okay since it's your
[4:46:35] decision we will support you I said
[4:46:39] okay but I thank God for he has been he
[4:46:42] helped me through that he put people
[4:46:45] around me especially Bridget she has
[4:46:48] been a blessing as a family there's a
[4:46:51] sister in
[4:46:53] Christ and after I finished
[4:46:57] school I was supposed to take the bo
[4:47:00] test my husband was like you have to

[4:48:14] go but I went there and I did a test and
[4:48:18] him too he was praying he said oh I push
[4:48:21] her and she has to pass that test if she
[4:48:23] doesn't pass it's going to be on
[4:48:25] me but thank God I went there and I

[4:48:47] together for our good I really thank

[4:49:02] the support of my life
[4:49:04] my parent was there my brother was there
[4:49:07] my sister was there so it was easy and
[4:49:09] you thought maybe it's just your own
[4:49:12] eort and you are so smart but I want to
[4:49:15] thank God because he's not being smart
[4:49:18] he God
[4:49:22] [Applause]
[4:49:32] grace
[4:49:42] you know what brother one and the
[4:49:45] church
[4:49:49] uh I was thinking about it when I came
[4:49:53] back from Kenya or
[4:49:56] home uh I felt like I should testify and
[4:49:59] say thank you Lord for the
[4:50:01] trip but the Lord led me in a day
[4:50:03] different direction because uh it was a
[4:50:07] good trip blessed
[4:50:09] trip ups and
[4:50:12] downs and uh I'll just bring
[4:50:17] one uh or two
[4:50:20] incidences uh the way the Lord had been
[4:50:23] good to me in that
[4:50:25] trip uh first of all I'd like to say
[4:50:28] thank you uh church for praying for
[4:50:30] me uh it is always my I can say my habit
[4:50:36] of requesting prayers whenever I
[4:50:40] travel anytime
[4:50:42] anywhere uh and the inspiration I get it
[4:50:46] from the book of uh
[4:50:49] Thessalonians where Paul sylvenus and
[4:50:53] timotheus asked the
[4:50:56] church they say unto the Church of the
[4:50:59] Thessalonians in God the father and the
[4:51:02] Lord Jesus Christ if you we come to
[4:51:05] chapter 3 it says finally Brethren pray
[4:51:08] for us the three of them they asking the
[4:51:11] church to pray for them the same thing I
[4:51:13] did for myself I asked the church I'm
[4:51:17] traveling to Kenya please uh church pray
[4:51:20] with
[4:51:22] me uh it's a long story but I'll cut it
[4:51:25] short I'll just bring that point that I
[4:51:28] wanted to bring I know uh I took a plane
[4:51:32] from here to Amsterdam
[4:51:34] we reached there in the morning and then
[4:51:36] from there I took another plane that's
[4:51:39] around 8 hours flight 9 and then 6 hours
[4:51:42] flight to Kenya 6 7 hours so that's
[4:51:45] around 15 hours on the on the plane in
[4:51:47] the air the travel from here to
[4:51:50] Amsterdam was uh uh it was
[4:51:53] good and then from
[4:51:56] Amsterdam I took to Kenya we left uh
[4:51:59] left there around I think midday we got
[4:52:03] uh to Kenya around midnight no around
[4:52:07] 10:00 so I arrived safely
[4:52:11] there uh there are some incidences in
[4:52:14] the you know I don't know how to explain
[4:52:17] it but the person sitting next to me was
[4:52:20] so
[4:52:23] um she had a very big attitude that she
[4:52:26] didn't even want me to you know you if
[4:52:28] you're sitting in the plane the space is
[4:52:30] so small but then she took a pillow and
[4:52:34] put it next to me so that we don't touch
[4:52:37] I said okay
[4:52:39] fine that one went on you know when they
[4:52:42] pass the drinks you reach out to get it
[4:52:44] she would say why are you you know uh
[4:52:47] why can't you sit I said no I I need to
[4:52:49] reach out for a drink
[4:52:52] so
[4:52:54] uh after that I took out the Bible and
[4:52:57] started reading on my Bible app and uh I
[4:53:00] don't know how it happened she just went
[4:53:02] to sleep and I read my Bible so for a
[4:53:05] long time so uh well we reached Kenya uh
[4:53:10] I I arrived well in the morning uh wait
[4:53:14] I stayed there for 3 days and then uh
[4:53:16] two days I think so and then on a Friday
[4:53:18] I took a plane in the evening around
[4:53:21] 6:00 uh the plane was uh it was a
[4:53:24] domestic plane uh domestic flight it's a
[4:53:27] small plane it's not like these big
[4:53:29] boings and uh we took a plane around
[4:53:31] 6:00 and it's just an hour flight from
[4:53:34] the place from the main city to my home
[4:53:38] uh airport it's just like Twin Cities
[4:53:40] and uh Rochester so when I took the
[4:53:44] plane uh it took off well we were in the
[4:53:49] air almost like 10 minutes or 15
[4:53:52] minutes uh while in the
[4:53:56] air
[4:53:58] uh uh by the grace of God they I didn't
[4:54:02] want to I didn't want to testify this
[4:54:05] because that time I knew many people are
[4:54:07] flying out so I didn't want to be
[4:54:09] interpreted differently so the plane
[4:54:12] just dropped you was thinking about
[4:54:18] me yeah so the plane just dropped
[4:54:22] but uh I found comfort in the word of
[4:54:25] God um I don't know Emanuel can you
[4:54:27] project that song on the myy clay or
[4:54:30] something like that there's a line there
[4:54:32] I want to refer to
[4:54:38] do you have it
[4:54:41] closed anyway so
[4:54:44] uh I don't know what happened to the
[4:54:46] plane I can't explain it but it just
[4:54:48] dropped dropped in the sense that the
[4:54:51] engines
[4:54:53] died yeah there there's no sound there
[4:54:56] was nothing immediately people were
[4:54:58] shouting and you know they were
[4:55:00] screaming H screaming oh
[4:55:05] what at that moment the Lord spoke to me
[4:55:08] and he asked me and uh go to the next
[4:55:15] verse next
[4:55:18] one where it says if if my heart is
[4:55:21] Right u a new
[4:55:29] song anyway uh so uh the Lord gave me it
[4:55:34] was like a song it spoke to my heart to
[4:55:37] my soul you know we say the Lord speaks
[4:55:41] but let him speak to your heart it's so
[4:55:44] different I had a very sweet sound voice
[4:55:48] and it asked me the two questions if I
[4:55:51] remember very well the first one was
[4:55:55] this are you
[4:55:57] ready no first he ask me is your heart
[4:56:01] right I did not think
[4:56:04] twice I said yes my heart is right he
[4:56:07] asked me again are you ready to go I
[4:56:10] said
[4:56:11] yes and immediately the pain came
[4:56:14] back I don't know
[4:56:17] why you see in that such instances if
[4:56:21] the word of God is the one that keeps
[4:56:22] you you know sometimes you don't have a
[4:56:25] brother next to you a sister next to you
[4:56:27] uh your wife next to you or your pastor
[4:56:29] next to you to pray with you a deacon to
[4:56:31] pray with you what are you going to do
[4:56:34] it's the word of God which will keep you
[4:56:36] you see I did not scream I did not call
[4:56:38] even the name of Jesus Christ I just
[4:56:40] answered the question two times you know
[4:56:43] is your heart right yes are you ready to
[4:56:45] go yes and the plane came
[4:56:48] back that was a great
[4:56:51] experience you better meet God in your
[4:56:54] own experience don't rely on somebody's
[4:56:56] else experience let it be your
[4:56:58] experience with your God I'm telling you
[4:57:00] from that time I had victories all
[4:57:04] I had victories I would I don't know if
[4:57:06] you should
[4:57:07] continue I had one incident whereby
[4:57:10] there a I had to take a um okay this one
[4:57:13] was in the city that I live in now
[4:57:16] there's a car I have to take a commuter
[4:57:18] bus from the place I was to home and now
[4:57:21] it was in the middle of Two Cities now
[4:57:24] from this city to this city the cars
[4:57:26] come

[4:57:30] car you have to just wait there and pray
[4:57:33] your luck you know

[4:57:56] almost uh an hour no car coming I told
[4:58:00] him let's pray and then we pray
[4:58:04] then immediately another car came and
[4:58:07] stopped and asked us if you want to go I
[4:58:09] told them I told my cousin let's go went
[4:58:12] to the car went to light the car and
[4:58:15] then I learn something told me stop

[4:58:19] this car then I looked around and then
[4:58:23] uh the people did not look like
[4:58:25] passengers there so I stepped back and I
[4:58:29] told the driver just go my cousin asked
[4:58:31] me why did you leave it I said no I did
[4:58:33] not feel like boarding that car so the
[4:58:36] car left so another car
