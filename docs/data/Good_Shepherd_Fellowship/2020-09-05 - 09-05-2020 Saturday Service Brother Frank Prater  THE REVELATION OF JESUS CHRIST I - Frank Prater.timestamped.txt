[37:56] i i joined you in service wednesday
[37:58] evening
[37:59] amen so i got to hear brother
[38:02] carlin speak the word of god and uh he
[38:05] and i
[38:06] seem to have a kindred spirit although
[38:09] i've never been white water rafting
[38:11] but i love i love the challenge
[38:16] amen i love the challenge and even
[38:18] though we think sometimes we should not
[38:20] tempt god
[38:21] amen but we do we do i do have three
[38:25] kayaks of my own you know so amen you
[38:28] can come down and join us sometime
[38:30] amen let's get right into the word of
[38:32] god this evening i'd uh
[38:33] spoke with brother juan earlier when he
[38:35] had invited and i said well i may speak
[38:38] on isaac and rebecca and uh
[38:41] i'm not going to do that tonight brother
[38:43] juan and i'm sorry if i
[38:45] misled you but i've been on this series
[38:48] of
[38:48] what i'm going to talk to you about
[38:50] tonight amen
[38:52] and i was as i was telling brother scott
[38:54] today a lot of people say brother prater
[38:55] calm down you're just too pentecostal
[38:58] uh your revelation is good but your
[39:00] reaction to it is just
[39:02] you know you you just brought too much
[39:04] with you
[39:05] i find it hard to contain what i'm happy
[39:08] about
[39:08] right i really find it hard to contain
[39:12] what blesses me
[39:13] and if any of the congregation from our
[39:15] local church in fort smith is viewing
[39:17] tonight i greet you and
[39:19] thank you for giving us liberty to come
[39:22] on this trip to enjoy
[39:24] these times of fellowship in the church
[39:26] and then to go on to the vacation that's
[39:28] scheduled
[39:28] with the carlin family and well we get
[39:31] to meet almost all of them again
[39:33] amen so it's been a long time amen in
[39:36] the book of revelation
[39:38] chapter 1 verse 1
[39:41] actually describes the entire book
[39:45] yes now yes uh i may not be evangelistic
[39:48] okay i i may be more of a doctrinal
[39:52] preacher than
[39:53] than an evangelist but when we begin to
[39:55] look at verse 1
[39:57] and we see the entire scope of the
[40:00] entire book
[40:02] of revelation now i'm reading from the
[40:06] notes right here in my bible not my
[40:08] notes but another's notes
[40:11] and it said this could be taken
[40:14] as a revelation which came from christ
[40:17] or as a revelation
[40:19] which is about christ amen but actually
[40:22] it's the revelation of christ himself
[40:25] that he's giving out in other words he's
[40:28] pouring himself out
[40:29] in revelation form now you'll understand
[40:33] as we get further into this tonight
[40:36] amen is that all prophets have to be
[40:39] revealed by the holy ghost
[40:41] is that right the prophets never say i
[40:43] am the prophet
[40:45] they never come and say amen this is me
[40:48] you know that's what brother branham
[40:49] taught
[40:49] he never introduced himself as malachi 4
[40:53] but we believe that he is by revelation
[40:55] from the holy ghost it takes the holy
[40:57] ghost
[40:58] but i want you to look at verse 8 and
[41:00] revelation chapter 1 with me and we'll
[41:01] get down to this again in just a few
[41:03] moments
[41:04] this is christ introducing himself
[41:07] now listen to what he says about himself
[41:11] he said i am alpha and omega
[41:15] now we know what it means so i'll not
[41:17] spend time with that
[41:18] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[41:20] the end saith the lord
[41:23] which is and which was and which is to
[41:25] come now who does that describe
[41:27] right amen now notice the last two words
[41:29] of
[41:30] god of christ introducing himself amen
[41:34] to the ages right now he's introducing
[41:37] himself
[41:37] at this point he's introducing himself
[41:40] to
[41:40] seven church ages the last two words
[41:43] that he says about himself
[41:46] the almighty in other words we can say
[41:50] christ is saying i am
[41:53] the almighty amen so it's a revelation
[41:58] of christ that christ is giving out to
[42:01] himself you know abraham
[42:04] knew uh the lord as
[42:07] elohim amen which is the almighty
[42:10] as we find out amen it's the same way
[42:13] that god reveals himself in this hour
[42:16] so amen when we look at jesus christ
[42:19] throughout the book of revelation amen
[42:22] it is not the book of revelations
[42:26] all right amen the whole book itself
[42:29] is the revelation of
[42:32] jesus christ as it says in verse 1. it
[42:35] should not be said
[42:37] the revelations every bit of it is about
[42:39] jesus christ
[42:41] all right amen as as we understand
[42:44] brother adam said uh this is the
[42:46] apocalypse
[42:48] the greek word for revelation is
[42:51] apocalypse
[42:52] which means unveiling this unveiling is
[42:56] perfectly described in the example
[42:59] of a sculptor unveiling his work of
[43:02] statuary
[43:03] exposing it to the onlooker amen so we
[43:07] know that a sculptor gets excited
[43:09] about what he has created amen
[43:12] and he invites an audience to come i'm
[43:15] going to reveal
[43:16] the statue that i have created
[43:21] amen so that you can see my handiwork
[43:25] now when the sculptor gets ready to
[43:27] reveal the statuary
[43:29] he don't just walk out there and jerk a
[43:31] string and the whole covering come off
[43:33] at the same time
[43:34] amen in order to influence or the ones
[43:37] that i have seen do it this way
[43:39] in order to influence the excitement
[43:42] of his group of people that he has
[43:44] invited to come
[43:46] and see the revelation of what he has
[43:48] created
[43:49] he lets the covering off a little bit
[43:53] at a time is that right amen that's what
[43:56] the revelation of jesus christ is
[43:58] amen it's a little bit of him one step
[44:01] at a time one piece at a time amen so
[44:04] when brother branham is telling us it's
[44:06] like the same thing
[44:07] amen the revealing or the revelation of
[44:10] jesus christ is like the sculpture
[44:12] amen has created an image that he wants
[44:16] everybody to behold and in order for you
[44:19] to see it and to see it perfectly
[44:21] i'm going to reveal it to you amen just
[44:24] a little
[44:25] bit at a time i thank god for the
[44:28] revelation of jesus christ
[44:30] amen i hope that you do too when we look
[44:32] at amen
[44:33] if brother juan has me come back in the
[44:36] morning
[44:37] amen i'm going to show you that there's
[44:38] four things to be anyway
[44:40] that we need to look at as we study the
[44:43] book of revelation number one
[44:45] amen is to look at when the revelation
[44:48] was given
[44:50] number two look at why
[44:54] the revelation was given number three
[44:58] look at how the revelation was given
[45:01] and number four look at to whom
[45:04] the revelation was given when
[45:08] why how and for whom
[45:12] was it given now i've already read to
[45:14] you revelation chapter 1 verse 8.
[45:16] how many of you can agree with me amen
[45:19] that
[45:19] jesus christ is the almighty amen
[45:23] amen i'm glad of that it doesn't it
[45:26] doesn't interfere with
[45:28] a revelation of the godhead all right
[45:31] amen because we
[45:32] know that it's one god in three offices
[45:34] amen in each of those offices can
[45:36] communicate with the other office all
[45:38] right i mean so we're we're not
[45:41] confused about the teachings of the
[45:43] godhead
[45:44] amen but when we look at what jesus
[45:47] christ is saying in verse 8
[45:49] i am the beginning i am alpha and omega
[45:52] omega the beginning and the ending amens
[45:55] which saith the lord which
[45:56] is which was and which is to come the
[45:59] almighty
[46:00] amen now in our search for the
[46:02] revelation of jesus christ
[46:04] this verse will stand alone amen you
[46:08] need
[46:08] no other verses oh we're going to look
[46:10] at some more may i take the jacket off
[46:12] amen we're going to look at some more
[46:14] i'm a convert brother steve
[46:16] amen we look at some other scriptures
[46:19] amen but if we really want to get the
[46:21] true revelation of jesus christ
[46:24] verse 8 is enough amen to let us know
[46:27] the
[46:28] magnificent amen entity that he
[46:31] is he is all that we need amen in jesus
[46:36] christ
[46:36] is everything that we have need of amen
[46:39] all of our healing all of our saving
[46:41] amen everything that we have need of is
[46:43] in jesus christ so
[46:45] amen there are many scriptures that we
[46:46] can look at that is in conjunction with
[46:49] this
[46:49] but this verse alone tells us everything
[46:53] that we need to know
[46:54] about jesus christ amen because if we
[46:57] need a healer it's jesus christ
[47:00] if we need a savior it's jesus christ if
[47:02] we need a deliverer it's jesus christ
[47:05] if we need a provider it's jesus christ
[47:07] can somebody say jesus christ i mean
[47:10] he's
[47:10] all i need and this verse says it
[47:14] amen by revelation amen so
[47:18] when we look at christ in the book of
[47:20] revelation
[47:22] we want to see how he reveals himself
[47:24] and as we come to the conclusion
[47:27] amen will find out that in this book of
[47:29] revelation
[47:30] christ always reveals himself amen
[47:34] as the conqueror the mighty conqueror
[47:36] amen the conqueror
[47:38] of death hail and the grave
[47:41] the one i trust in amen never
[47:44] in the book of revelation will you ever
[47:47] find him amen being subject to death you
[47:52] never again see him
[47:53] subject to hell you never again see him
[47:57] subject amen to anything except
[48:00] himself as the almighty he is under
[48:03] bondage to nothing
[48:05] amen he is in servitude to nothing
[48:08] i mean he is in fear of nothing he
[48:11] controls it all
[48:12] he is the almighty
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] oh my the one that we trust in the one
[48:18] we call jesus
[48:20] the one we call savior amen introduced
[48:23] himself
[48:23] to the church or the bride as the
[48:26] almighty
[48:28] guy amen i can rest in the end and i
[48:31] could go home and say jesus
[48:33] i know you you're the almighty amen but
[48:36] let's look a little further let's see
[48:38] how
[48:39] amen the revelation of jesus christ
[48:42] that is from jesus christ agrees with
[48:45] the prophets okay
[48:46] amen if you're going to read isaiah
[48:49] chapter 9
[48:50] verse 6. we won't read the whole thing
[48:52] but if you were to read
[48:54] uh isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 amen this is
[48:58] where
[48:58] he says for unto us a child is born
[49:02] unto us a son is given but he introduces
[49:05] isaiah says in his name the son's name
[49:08] amen shall be called
[49:09] the mighty god isaiah had a revelation
[49:13] right
[49:13] of the one that was coming was going to
[49:16] be the mighty god the
[49:18] everlasting father amen so in christ
[49:21] in verse 8 amen says i am the almighty
[49:24] he's in agreement with what isaiah said
[49:27] about the one that was coming as a son
[49:29] amen he's in perfect agreement with him
[49:32] and isaiah said amen he'll be called the
[49:35] almighty
[49:36] isaiah 41 4. now if i go too fast
[49:40] amen somebody you tell brother juan and
[49:42] brother want to tell me
[49:43] amen that i'm going too fast but i'm
[49:45] trying my best
[49:47] amen to hold my composure amen
[49:50] isaiah 41 41 41 4 i'm sorry
[49:54] amen look at what god calls himself
[49:58] i the lord the first
[50:02] and with the last amen
[50:06] i am he right i am the lord i
[50:09] am the almighty i am elohim i
[50:13] am the first and i am
[50:16] with the last. now you say well he says
[50:19] he's with the last amen that means there
[50:21] must be another there is
[50:23] amen there is another entity amen in the
[50:26] end time that's going to step up and be
[50:29] the perfect personification
[50:31] of jesus christ sorry
[50:34] amen in other words when we sing the
[50:37] song he is here hallelujah
[50:39] he is here amen and we're saying
[50:42] a revelation that he is here with the
[50:45] bride
[50:46] as he's been amen with the prophets of
[50:48] old
[50:50] now i'm getting ahead of myself isaiah
[50:52] 35
[50:54] verses 4 and 6 or 4-6
[50:59] amen god said when he would come to save
[51:04] or when he would come as the savior
[51:07] he said in verse 5 then the eyes of the
[51:10] blind
[51:11] shall be opened and the ears of the
[51:14] death shall be unstopped
[51:17] then shall the lame man leap as in heart
[51:20] and the tongue tongue of the dumb sing
[51:25] then shall the lame man leap as a heart
[51:29] a lot of people don't leap anymore amen
[51:33] amen but if you got joy you'll leap
[51:36] about it right
[51:37] amen then shall the lame man leap as an
[51:40] heart
[51:42] amen and the tongue of the dumb shall
[51:44] sing
[51:45] for in the wilderness
[51:49] if you've ever been to israel and you
[51:50] see those little deers jumping on the
[51:52] tops of those mountains when it gets
[51:54] near those streams
[51:55] amen if we're in the wilderness shall
[51:57] waters break out what you preached about
[52:00] the last time you preached for me right
[52:02] the row on the top of the mountain amen
[52:04] i don't know if you believe it uh
[52:06] remember it or not but i certainly do
[52:08] amen for in the wilderness shall waters
[52:11] break out in the streams in the desert
[52:13] amen that portion of this is being
[52:16] fulfilled right now
[52:17] amen so we see uh jesus christ
[52:20] going back to the prophets and
[52:22] identifying himself with the word of god
[52:25] amen the prophet called him almighty
[52:27] then he is the almighty amen amen
[52:30] now you remember when the disciples were
[52:33] sent from
[52:34] john amen to ask jesus we find this in
[52:37] luke 7
[52:38] amen beginning in verse 19. the
[52:40] disciples
[52:42] have been commissioned by john the
[52:43] baptist to go
[52:45] ask jesus some questions and i know this
[52:48] is
[52:48] uh elementary i understand that amen but
[52:51] it's
[52:52] to me it's food all right amen let's
[52:55] just read it luke 7 verse 19
[52:57] and john calling unto him two of his
[53:00] disciples
[53:01] amen sent them to jesus saying art thou
[53:03] he that should come
[53:05] or look we for another amen
[53:08] sounds like john was getting a little
[53:10] discouraged right
[53:12] amen i didn't know it was going to go
[53:14] this way maybe john is saying
[53:15] amen but i want to make sure that i've
[53:17] done my job right i want to make sure
[53:19] that amen
[53:20] i've stood in my place and said the
[53:22] right thing
[53:23] amen go ask him if he's the one that i
[53:26] talked about or is there another to come
[53:28] after him
[53:30] verse 20 when the men were come unto him
[53:32] they
[53:33] said john the baptist has sent us under
[53:36] thee
[53:36] saying art thou he that should come
[53:40] or look we for another and in the same
[53:42] hour he cured many of their infirmities
[53:45] and plagues
[53:46] always introducing himself amen as
[53:48] according to the word of god has already
[53:50] spoken about it
[53:51] amen right this is the same thing that
[53:53] isaiah said when your savior comes
[53:56] this is what he's going to do and when
[53:58] jesus christ
[53:59] is introducing himself amen to the
[54:02] disciples of john the baptist getting
[54:04] ready to begin
[54:05] his ministry he points them back to the
[54:08] word of god
[54:09] and to anybody that has questions he
[54:12] says
[54:12] amen this is what the word of god says
[54:15] go
[54:16] tell john amen what you see
[54:19] and what you hear is that right yeah
[54:22] amen and at the same hour
[54:24] he cured many of their infirmities
[54:27] and plagues and of evil spirits unto
[54:30] many that were blind
[54:32] he gave sight i mean god
[54:35] introducing his ministry amen by
[54:39] signs and wonders and miracles
[54:42] then jesus answering said unto them
[54:45] go your way and tell john what things
[54:49] you have seen
[54:50] and heard how the blind see
[54:54] the lame walk the lepers are cleansed
[54:57] the death here the dead are raised to
[55:00] the poor
[55:01] the gospel is preached and blessed
[55:05] is he whosoever shall not be
[55:08] offended in me amen jesus christ
[55:13] had no problems opening the word of god
[55:16] and identifying himself by the
[55:19] scriptures
[55:21] oh would to god amen that the bride of
[55:23] christ in this hour
[55:25] amen would come to the place that she
[55:27] could open this book see her name
[55:29] written in this book
[55:30] amen and say i amen am identified with
[55:34] jesus christ
[55:35] and when that happens church amen the
[55:37] bride is going to be out of here
[55:40] i think it's close don't you amen when
[55:43] we get to where we're going maybe
[55:44] tonight or in the morning we'll see
[55:46] amen that it might be closer than what
[55:48] we really believe that it could be
[55:51] now according to what the prophets said
[55:53] about jesus
[55:55] even in questionable times as
[55:58] it was with john the baptist he points
[56:01] them
[56:02] to the word of god amen can you say amen
[56:05] amen let me tell you something church
[56:07] and i'll i'll talk with your pastor
[56:09] again on this subject let me tell you
[56:12] this
[56:13] this book is god's word amen you say
[56:16] amen
[56:17] this book is our guide out of this world
[56:21] by the holy ghost it being revealed to
[56:23] us amen we know
[56:24] it is the vindicated word of god
[56:28] is that right amen so that any time that
[56:30] anybody
[56:31] says this book amen is wrong
[56:35] i questioned that statement
[56:38] would you if anybody would come to me
[56:41] and tell me
[56:42] amen that the apostle paul
[56:47] wrote in this book things that are not
[56:50] so
[56:51] i would have to say i'm going to stay
[56:54] with the book
[56:55] right if i get off the word of god
[56:59] you stay with that book that's right you
[57:01] say amen
[57:03] anytime you find a preacher that's off
[57:06] the word of god
[57:07] don't stay with the preacher stay with
[57:09] the word
[57:11] is that all right now i'm not up here
[57:14] condemning you understand that i'm just
[57:15] telling you
[57:16] amen in this trying hour that we are in
[57:19] amen you must have a revelation based
[57:23] on the word of god and that the word of
[57:26] god
[57:26] amen is what christ points back to to
[57:29] reveal himself
[57:32] if any man adds to that
[57:36] and tells you amen that brother branham
[57:39] missed the mark
[57:43] well i'll say then why in god's name
[57:46] did god put his vindication mark
[57:49] his signification on the ministry of
[57:52] brother branham if brother branham
[57:53] wasn't the one
[57:54] amen that was to come and lead us amen
[57:57] back to the word of god
[57:59] is that all right amen i always would
[58:02] say
[58:02] amen take me to the word of god amen
[58:05] amen so when jesus christ
[58:07] is wanting people to see who he is amen
[58:10] he
[58:10] never says that one or this one he says
[58:14] it is me i am amen in the word
[58:17] amen hallelujah
[58:20] even the unbelievers in that day are
[58:24] told that if they believe the scriptures
[58:26] amen as they pretended to do what would
[58:29] they do
[58:29] amen they would have had no problem
[58:32] believing that jesus christ was the
[58:34] messiah
[58:35] they said they believed they pretended
[58:37] that they believed
[58:38] they pretended that they were message
[58:40] believers i remember when they were
[58:42] confronted with the word of god
[58:44] and it proved that they were not who
[58:46] they said they were
[58:48] amen all right that's enough doctrine
[58:51] right
[58:52] amen you know what brother branham said
[58:56] and i hope this
[58:57] excites you how many of you believe

[59:02] from a prophet's mouth good to see the
[59:04] hands going on

[1:00:33] invitation tonight

[1:00:45] assembly
[1:00:46] amen of the firstborn oh hallelujah
[1:00:49] when when i consider those statements no
[1:00:52] wonder a man like me

[1:00:57] amen i've talked to some of you about
[1:00:59] the things that i've done the things
[1:01:01] i've been involved in i mean to say that
[1:01:03] christ no longer looks at that
[1:01:05] it don't even exist in the mind of
[1:01:07] christ anymore
[1:01:08] it's absolutely moot mute
[1:01:12] to him amen that i ever done anything
[1:01:16] except serve him oh
[1:01:18] can you say amen i am the elect of god
[1:01:23] now we're not studying we're not going
[1:01:25] to study tonight or in the morning the
[1:01:27] whole book of revelation
[1:01:29] amen but we're just going to study on
[1:01:31] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:33] and you say well you said the whole book
[1:01:35] was but amen this one verse is enough
[1:01:38] to show us amen all christ is
[1:01:41] as we begin to break down this verse
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:45] to show us more to show to me amen more
[1:01:48] about
[1:01:49] the church and this hour the revelation
[1:01:51] of this hour amen and how brother random
[1:01:53] brought it to us
[1:01:54] now amen i hope you understand and i'll
[1:01:57] try to share with you
[1:01:58] some of my thoughts about uh the
[1:02:01] prophet's message
[1:02:02] and brother brother juan is sometimes
[1:02:06] i used to think it was a very wise man
[1:02:07] but he didn't put a clock in the back of
[1:02:10] the auditorium
[1:02:12] amen and my clock on my computer don't
[1:02:14] work amen and
[1:02:18] brother loyal didn't pay any attention
[1:02:19] to that wednesday night so
[1:02:23] amen amen
[1:02:27] i do have a watch over there in my
[1:02:28] pocket
[1:02:30] amen but the band won't fit me soon
[1:02:34] amen you see how christ is revealing
[1:02:37] himself to his bride
[1:02:39] and it goes on to the end of the ages
[1:02:41] now you realize again
[1:02:43] isaiah understood how to study the word
[1:02:46] of god
[1:02:47] amen because he said in isaiah 28 verse
[1:02:50] 10 for
[1:02:50] precept or ordinance or command
[1:02:54] amen must must be upon precept precept
[1:02:57] must be upon precept precept upon
[1:02:59] precept
[1:03:00] line up online line up online hear a
[1:03:02] little and there a little amen
[1:03:04] amen now you remember the introduction
[1:03:06] in the introduction i talked about how
[1:03:07] brother branham talked about the
[1:03:09] sculpture
[1:03:10] amen and and what uh the sculpture that
[1:03:13] he had
[1:03:14] that agrees with that scripture just a
[1:03:16] little bit at a time
[1:03:18] amen the revelation will come it must be
[1:03:21] amen command or ordinance or oracle amen
[1:03:25] a little bit here and a little bit there
[1:03:26] but at the end of it you'll see the
[1:03:28] whole thing
[1:03:29] as clear as crystal right amen that's
[1:03:32] from the book of revelation 2.
[1:03:34] amen at the end of this book the bride
[1:03:38] of christ
[1:03:38] will come into view amen
[1:03:41] amen as i've already said when she comes
[1:03:44] into view
[1:03:45] at the end of the book amen she comes
[1:03:48] into you as christ personified
[1:03:52] on the earth amen what does it mean amen
[1:03:56] she is to be the embodiment
[1:03:58] of or a perfect example of the one that
[1:04:01] she is personifying
[1:04:03] now she'll never go to the cross again
[1:04:06] why
[1:04:06] amen because christ went once once for
[1:04:09] all
[1:04:09] amen and that's the only one that was
[1:04:11] needed that's the only trip to calvary
[1:04:13] that was needed
[1:04:14] and that's the only thing you need to
[1:04:15] have faith in amen for your salvation is
[1:04:18] faith in the blood of jesus christ
[1:04:20] nothing else will bring you salvation
[1:04:26] but she as she comes into view
[1:04:29] towards the end of the book becomes
[1:04:32] amen the perfect embodiment of jesus
[1:04:35] christ
[1:04:37] now amen again the book is introduced as
[1:04:40] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:04:42] brother brown said jesus christ is the
[1:04:45] author of this book
[1:04:47] john is the scribe but jesus christ
[1:04:50] himself authors the book amen and
[1:04:54] as he does he appoints john as the
[1:04:56] scribe
[1:04:57] amen he sees the beginning of the church
[1:05:01] and he sees the end of the ages
[1:05:04] and then he closes the book out amen
[1:05:06] leaving us with a perfect
[1:05:08] understanding of exactly who
[1:05:11] we are and where we are amen as things
[1:05:15] unfold so amen let's look at it again
[1:05:18] the the revelation of jesus christ
[1:05:20] brother random said
[1:05:22] the actual revelation of jesus himself
[1:05:25] in the church and his work in the future
[1:05:28] ages
[1:05:28] that's what all we're talking about
[1:05:30] tonight is christ
[1:05:32] revealing himself amen to the church and
[1:05:35] what he's going to do
[1:05:37] in the future ages now amen i want you

[1:08:51] strongest the
[1:08:52] one that i feed the most amen is what
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] uh what the indian chief said i mean so
[1:08:58] if we're feeding that
[1:08:59] influence i mean if we feed it with fear
[1:09:02] and negativity and always a confession
[1:09:06] of how bad i used to be and the things
[1:09:08] that i used to do
[1:09:10] then that's the influence that we are
[1:09:12] under and we give him strength
[1:09:15] amen but if we begin to talk greater is

[1:10:29] two in the godhead brother prater i'm

[1:10:35] must come from the holy ghost
[1:10:36] amen the revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:39] which god gave unto him
[1:10:42] amen it's like a scriptural marriage
[1:10:48] yes right one man one woman

[1:11:01] gave unto him
[1:11:03] to show unto his servants things which
[1:11:05] must shortly come to pass

[1:11:12] amen are those whose service is used by
[1:11:15] christ
[1:11:16] in extending and advancing his cause
[1:11:19] among men
[1:11:19] amen now brother branham lets us know in
[1:11:22] order to
[1:11:22] save time and to break it down correctly
[1:11:25] brother branham lets
[1:11:26] us know amen that these servants are
[1:11:28] seven
[1:11:29] men in the book of revelation with whom
[1:11:32] god closely identifies himself
[1:11:36] now i'm not bringing you a deep
[1:11:37] revelation i know you know these things
[1:11:40] amen but i've got to say it in order to
[1:11:41] get to where i want to go yeah

[1:12:02] say grace and peace
[1:12:03] grace why do we still have a message
[1:12:07] amen of anger
[1:12:10] why do we still have a message of
[1:12:12] failures why are preachers still
[1:12:14] telling the churches how bad they are
[1:12:17] yes
[1:12:18] that's right why are preachers still
[1:12:19] telling the churches amen church you've
[1:12:21] missed the
[1:12:22] mark when here we hear that there is a
[1:12:26] message of grace
[1:12:27] and peace
[1:12:30] you'll find the book closing out saying
[1:12:33] the grace of our god be with you all
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:36] you'll find habakkuk closing out the age
[1:12:39] say

[1:13:00] him which is and which was and which is
[1:13:03] to come
[1:13:04] what is the message of jesus christ all
[1:13:06] about grace
[1:13:08] and peace
[1:13:11] hallelujah watch how it comes now i'm
[1:13:15] answering those four questions
[1:13:19] and from the seven spirits which are
[1:13:22] before
[1:13:24] his throne amen what is the message of
[1:13:26] the hour that we have
[1:13:27] amen from the voice of william branham
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:30] malachi 4. amen revelation 10
[1:13:34] 7. how many of you believe those two are
[1:13:36] the same one
[1:13:37] i mean it might be a different type of
[1:13:38] ministry but it's the same man
[1:13:41] he comes under the anointing of malachi
[1:13:43] 4 to turn our hearts back to the faith
[1:13:45] of the fathers amen but under the
[1:13:46] anointing of revelation 10
[1:13:48] 7 amen he comes to clear up all the
[1:13:50] mysteries
[1:13:51] amen that's ever been uttered through
[1:13:53] the the preaching
[1:13:54] of prophets amen um revelation 10
[1:13:58] 7 amen it's not going to leave the scene
[1:14:01] until the perfect message
[1:14:02] amen of faith comes to the bride of
[1:14:04] jesus christ
[1:14:06] i don't believe he failed
[1:14:10] and i really don't believe he's coming
[1:14:12] back to complete the job
[1:14:14] i think he done well the first time amen
[1:14:17] but here now here those seven spirits
[1:14:19] are and brother brown said it's seven
[1:14:22] men with whom god closely identifies
[1:14:25] himself
[1:14:26] amen so we go back to verse 1. is this
[1:14:28] all right
[1:14:30] amen and he's
[1:14:35] let's start this the beginning the
[1:14:36] revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:14:38] gave unto him
[1:14:39] to show into his servants things which
[1:14:40] must shortly come to pass and he
[1:14:42] sentenced signified it by his angel
[1:14:44] unto his servant john all right
[1:14:47] to show unto his servants amen we find
[1:14:50] out through study the message of the
[1:14:52] hour
[1:14:52] and the word of god those servants are
[1:14:55] the seven church age messengers that's
[1:14:57] right
[1:14:57] is that all right amen now always
[1:14:59] remember this you've got to discern
[1:15:01] between
[1:15:02] amen what was delivered to the
[1:15:05] denominational church
[1:15:07] and what was delivered to the bride
[1:15:10] right amen it's a message that secures
[1:15:13] the bride in her place
[1:15:15] amen and you don't have to tell my wife
[1:15:17] every day
[1:15:19] amen you are now miss prater she knows
[1:15:21] that and she's known it for
[1:15:22] amen 49 years almost right hold on
[1:15:27] amen let's look at part four
[1:15:34] unto his servants things which must
[1:15:38] shortly come to pass right
[1:15:42] you might look at this and say well he's
[1:15:44] talking about the end time
[1:15:47] 2 000 years ago and he's talking about
[1:15:49] the end time
[1:15:50] amen but you realize up until this point
[1:15:53] those disciples never knew anything
[1:15:56] about the
[1:15:57] an age of the gentiles amen as a matter
[1:16:00] of fact when john
[1:16:01] told or when jesus told them in john
[1:16:04] chapter 10
[1:16:05] verse 16 amen other sheep i have
[1:16:08] of this fold right of the sheep i have
[1:16:11] which are not of this fold
[1:16:13] and then them also must i bring and they
[1:16:16] shall hear my voice
[1:16:17] and there shall be one shepherd and
[1:16:19] there shall be one fold so
[1:16:21] amen we understand that the disciples
[1:16:24] did not under the prophets in the old
[1:16:26] amen did not
[1:16:27] really see the gentile ages they didn't
[1:16:29] know anything about
[1:16:30] amen gentiles coming and they still
[1:16:32] don't if you go
[1:16:34] to israel they don't know anything amen
[1:16:37] about
[1:16:37] gentiles believing in a message of from
[1:16:40] jehovah
[1:16:41] as a matter of fact i almost got into a
[1:16:44] fight on the plane back from israel
[1:16:46] amen because an orthodox jew was
[1:16:48] standing there right beside of me next
[1:16:50] to the beside of me
[1:16:51] and we started singing on by the rivers
[1:16:53] of babylon by the shores of babylon
[1:16:55] he said where did you hear that song i
[1:16:57] said well we sing it often he said well
[1:16:59] are you a jew i said no i'm a christian
[1:17:02] he said what are you doing in israel i
[1:17:03] said i've been over here in a christian
[1:17:04] revival
[1:17:05] i mean he got mad he almost started a
[1:17:07] fight with me because i was a christian
[1:17:09] bringing a message of jesus to jerusalem
[1:17:12] they can't understand it
[1:17:16] they still don't understand it by the
[1:17:18] grace of god
[1:17:20] because if they did you and i would have
[1:17:22] no hope
[1:17:24] is that right amen so
[1:17:27] when christ is introducing himself
[1:17:31] and he's telling these disciples amen
[1:17:34] i'm going to bring you a revelation
[1:17:37] which must shortly
[1:17:39] come to pass amen to my understanding
[1:17:43] jesus christ is telling them
[1:17:46] these seven messengers are going to come
[1:17:49] and their message is going to begin
[1:17:51] shortly in other words revelation
[1:17:54] chapter 2
[1:17:55] begins amen with an angel to the church
[1:17:58] of ephesus
[1:17:59] amen with the church of ephesus although
[1:18:01] the church has been born
[1:18:03] amen the church ages the gentile church
[1:18:05] ages start in revelation chapter 2.
[1:18:08] amen and look look at what christ is
[1:18:10] saying amen
[1:18:11] i'm revealing these things to you amen
[1:18:13] and these things will come to pass
[1:18:16] shortly amen they did not understand how
[1:18:20] graceful
[1:18:20] amen the message to the gentiles was
[1:18:23] going to be but christ
[1:18:24] is introducing himself amen i'm going to
[1:18:26] do something i'm showing you something
[1:18:28] that's going to start
[1:18:29] amen very shortly and what happens amen
[1:18:32] he begins to call out a
[1:18:33] gentile bride can you say amen amen
[1:18:37] that's you and i
[1:18:38] identified by his name amen and here we
[1:18:41] are tonight
[1:18:42] sitting amen under the greatest thing
[1:18:44] that's ever taken place on the face of
[1:18:46] the earth and he's about to finish this
[1:18:48] work
[1:18:48] up and show that this pride has held
[1:18:52] true to the word of god through the ages
[1:18:54] praise the lord i'm sorry
[1:18:58] i just believe it
[1:19:01] amen so he's about to start talking
[1:19:03] about himself but
[1:19:05] never amen in the book of revelation
[1:19:07] does he just talk about himself
[1:19:09] he also talks about his bride yes
[1:19:12] amen so now watch part 4 of verse 1
[1:19:17] and he sent and signified it in other
[1:19:20] words it's so
[1:19:21] important amen that this revelation be
[1:19:24] properly delivered
[1:19:26] and properly understood it's so
[1:19:28] important
[1:19:29] amen that he is going to signify
[1:19:32] i mean which simply means that amen he's
[1:19:34] going to
[1:19:35] signify it or market amen as something
[1:19:39] special he's sending a special envoy
[1:19:42] amen to signify or to mark that what is
[1:19:46] about to unfold
[1:19:48] amen is absolutely glorious
[1:19:53] amen he's saying that that is going to
[1:19:57] give this prophecy
[1:19:58] a particular meaning in the next part he
[1:20:02] reverse
[1:20:03] he reveals how verse part 5
[1:20:07] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:20:09] angel
[1:20:10] unto his servant john
[1:20:13] now watch church one angel
[1:20:17] sent to reveal this secret
[1:20:20] to john are you with me
[1:20:26] oh what are you talking about seven
[1:20:29] messengers
[1:20:30] what are you talking about four verse
[1:20:31] four seven spirits before the throne
[1:20:34] when this winds up it's going to be
[1:20:38] one of those angels yes are you with me
[1:20:41] amen that has a special anointing
[1:20:46] amen to reveal it to
[1:20:49] john amen praise the lord are you with
[1:20:52] me
[1:20:53] amen amen amen
[1:20:58] seven spirits remember that which are
[1:21:00] before the throne the seven spirits are
[1:21:02] seven men with whom god
[1:21:03] closely identifies himself through the
[1:21:05] church ages
[1:21:07] but one angel is sent to show john the
[1:21:10] conclusion
[1:21:11] of the whole matter remember how the
[1:21:14] pillar of fire was identified
[1:21:16] amen as the same always as the same
[1:21:19] pillar of fire that was with moses
[1:21:22] amen did paul understand what that
[1:21:25] pillar of fire was when he saw it
[1:21:27] he understood that it was the pillar of
[1:21:29] fire with moses
[1:21:31] do we understand amen that what has
[1:21:33] happened
[1:21:34] in this last day is the same pillar of
[1:21:36] fire that was with paul
[1:21:38] the same pillar of fire that was with
[1:21:39] moses it hasn't changed a bit
[1:21:41] i mean it's always god's signifying amen
[1:21:44] that someone is going to do something
[1:21:46] special
[1:21:47] amen actually brother random said that
[1:21:50] pillar of fire was the covenant angel
[1:21:55] amen you see the covenant angel here in
[1:21:57] revelation chapter one verse one
[1:21:59] amen now watch it's jesus christ
[1:22:02] revealing himself
[1:22:04] and brother branham said the pillar of
[1:22:06] fire is the covenanted angel the logos
[1:22:08] that went out of god
[1:22:09] which was jesus hallelujah
[1:22:13] so now we see jesus stepping forth here
[1:22:16] just at the beginning of the seven
[1:22:17] church ages amen he says i'm going to
[1:22:19] reveal
[1:22:20] myself amen through these ages and at
[1:22:23] the conclusion
[1:22:24] i mean i'm going to choose one of those
[1:22:26] messengers and he is going to
[1:22:28] bring a conclusion amen to the whole
[1:22:31] plan of god
[1:22:32] he's going to show exactly what jesus
[1:22:35] christ
[1:22:35] wanted to show through all the ages
[1:22:38] praise the lord and brother branham said
[1:22:40] and when he died he ascended up into
[1:22:42] heaven and when it
[1:22:42] when he met saul on the road to damascus
[1:22:45] he had done turned back to the pillar of
[1:22:46] fire again
[1:22:48] amen not leaving the body there in
[1:22:50] comatose state just setting
[1:22:52] amen on the throne of mercy but amen now
[1:22:54] he comes back again as a pillar of fire
[1:22:56] with paul on the road to damascus amen
[1:22:59] beginning of the seven church ages but
[1:23:01] what will happen at the end of the
[1:23:02] church ages i mean it must be the same
[1:23:04] identification that comes
[1:23:06] and i want to tell you something i want
[1:23:07] to ask you a simple question
[1:23:09] if the minister that we claim to be the
[1:23:12] prophet to this age
[1:23:13] is not the one amen where is the one
[1:23:16] that was to come before jesus christ
[1:23:18] returns
[1:23:20] amen show me that ministry
[1:23:24] amen but i can show you where those
[1:23:28] scriptures have been fulfilled in our
[1:23:30] time
[1:23:32] oh my praise the lord thank you
[1:23:35] where has he been seen at in the last
[1:23:37] days
[1:23:38] amen it's it moved and it hasn't moved
[1:23:42] since
[1:23:44] right it hasn't anointed another man
[1:23:47] amen
[1:23:48] it hasn't come to another man amen
[1:23:50] there's been
[1:23:52] false ones there's been pictures amen
[1:23:54] that have been proven
[1:23:55] wrong but you'll never prove god's doing
[1:23:58] wrong
[1:24:00] and even though science will declare it
[1:24:02] when it happens
[1:24:03] and yet later try to say it's not what
[1:24:06] we
[1:24:07] originally said they've already said
[1:24:09] what it was
[1:24:11] no used to come along and change it why
[1:24:13] don't they just say i didn't understand
[1:24:14] it amen but it really
[1:24:16] was there praise the lord amen
[1:24:20] amen i got to go i got to run fast amen
[1:24:23] i don't want to tire you out
[1:24:26] amen remember the identification
[1:24:30] has been with the bride praise the lord
[1:24:32] now watch go back to verse one
[1:24:36] he sent him signified it by one angel
[1:24:39] to his servant john how many of you know
[1:24:42] that brother branham taught
[1:24:44] us amen that in the book of revelation
[1:24:48] when john is in relationship with his
[1:24:50] angel
[1:24:51] john represents the bride movement
[1:24:55] you're aware of that amen so go back to
[1:24:58] verse 1
[1:25:00] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:25:03] prophet that's what that word angel
[1:25:04] means unto
[1:25:06] his servant the bride
[1:25:10] understand amen we're found in the first
[1:25:14] verse
[1:25:15] and we're also found at the end of the
[1:25:17] verse all right
[1:25:19] amen now let's look at this and see if
[1:25:21] if i can't prove what i just said
[1:25:24] by the scriptures how many of you and i
[1:25:26] heard some amens
[1:25:27] how many of you believe that that angel
[1:25:29] is a prophet
[1:25:32] how many of you believe that john in
[1:25:34] relationship to this angel
[1:25:35] is the entire bride does that mean you
[1:25:38] and i yeah
[1:25:40] amen let's see if that's true let's go
[1:25:42] to revelation chapter 19 verse 10.
[1:25:45] i'm almost done tonight amen
[1:25:48] i want to see if you come back in the
[1:25:49] morning amen
[1:25:51] revelation chapter 19 verse 10 if you've
[1:25:54] been around message preachers very long
[1:25:56] all you've already heard all this
[1:25:58] right so i'm not bringing you a
[1:26:00] revelation i mean i'm just reinforcing
[1:26:02] what's already been said
[1:26:04] revelation chapter 19 verse 10 and i
[1:26:07] fell at his feet
[1:26:09] to worship him who is this remember john
[1:26:12] i fell at his feet to worship him
[1:26:16] now john has seen something in the
[1:26:19] ministry
[1:26:20] of this man or this prophet or this
[1:26:22] angel
[1:26:23] i mean that john says why this is like
[1:26:26] god
[1:26:26] i mean this this this is like god among
[1:26:29] us and he falls down to worship
[1:26:32] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[1:26:37] for i am thy fellow servant
[1:26:42] does it say that and that thy brethren
[1:26:45] that have the testimony of jesus
[1:26:48] worship god for the testimony of jesus
[1:26:50] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:26:52] what would any prophet tell you to do
[1:26:55] amen but to worship
[1:26:57] god would he direct you to anything else
[1:27:00] would any god sent prophet direct you to
[1:27:03] anything in worship
[1:27:04] amen except the one true almighty god
[1:27:08] he would he would never point to himself
[1:27:11] he would never
[1:27:12] introduce himself but god through him
[1:27:15] amen would say
[1:27:16] this is what i am doing in this hour
[1:27:24] verse chapter 22 verse 8.
[1:27:29] just a little while we'll be going and i
[1:27:33] john
[1:27:33] saw these things and heard them
[1:27:37] what same thing amen we just read in
[1:27:40] revelation 19
[1:27:41] 10. and i john remember john is in
[1:27:44] relationship with an angel here
[1:27:46] so it's the bride saw these things and
[1:27:49] heard them
[1:27:50] and when i had heard and seen i fell
[1:27:54] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:27:57] angel which showed me the
[1:27:58] second time now amen john comes and this
[1:28:01] is
[1:28:02] near the end of the book near the end of
[1:28:04] the ages amen second time
[1:28:06] comes around and john amen is again
[1:28:09] looking and wanting to worship the angel
[1:28:12] that's doing so many things actually
[1:28:14] it's god doing so much
[1:28:15] through the angel or through the
[1:28:17] messenger or through the prophet
[1:28:19] i mean it's god doing so much through
[1:28:21] him that john gets so carried away
[1:28:23] amen that he knows that it must be god
[1:28:26] doing this and he falls
[1:28:28] down to worship the man
[1:28:31] the second time and the second time
[1:28:37] amen he tells john
[1:28:40] verse 9 then saith he unto me
[1:28:44] see thou do it not for i am thy
[1:28:48] fellow servant and of thy brethren
[1:28:52] the prophets now if you thought i was
[1:28:54] wrong when i
[1:28:55] introduced those seven messengers back
[1:28:57] there and amen the beginning of the
[1:28:58] sermon as prophets
[1:28:59] amen right here i am vindicated amen
[1:29:02] because
[1:29:03] john is saying amen i am of thy brethren
[1:29:07] the prophets
[1:29:09] and of them which keep the sayings of
[1:29:11] this book
[1:29:12] amen worship god i keep the sayings of
[1:29:15] this book and
[1:29:16] everything that the book tells me to do
[1:29:18] i have told you to do
[1:29:21] can you say amen i backed up on nothing
[1:29:24] i
[1:29:24] turned away from nothing everything that
[1:29:27] god declared
[1:29:28] i have said to you
[1:29:31] don't come along try to change it in
[1:29:33] this hour don't come along and try to
[1:29:35] say it's for a different day
[1:29:37] the message was no good amen it's the
[1:29:39] same god
[1:29:40] amen doing everything right down to the
[1:29:43] ages
[1:29:43] i declared everything to you that god
[1:29:46] told me to do
[1:29:48] amen that's why we can call ourselves
[1:29:51] full gospel believers
[1:29:54] is that see thou do it not for i am thy
[1:29:56] fellow servant of thy brethren the
[1:29:57] prophets
[1:29:58] of them which keep the sayings of this
[1:30:00] book worship god

[1:30:06] sayings of the prophecy of this book

[1:33:44] praise the lord you're a lucky young man
[1:33:47] brother loyal
[1:33:49] i went through the same thing you went
[1:33:50] through
[1:33:52] when i was 20 years old the doctors laid
[1:33:56] me out on a
[1:33:57] hospital bed in the south side of
[1:33:58] chicago and told my mother
[1:34:01] and my father if you've got if he's got
[1:34:05] relatives and they want to see him alive
[1:34:07] get them here within 24
[1:34:10] hours that's right
[1:34:14] i don't know how they did it with you
[1:34:16] but they saw me so far gone and this was
[1:34:18] in 1969
[1:34:21] that they didn't even stitch me up they
[1:34:24] just pushed me aside
[1:34:26] said within 24 hours this young man
[1:34:30] is going to be gone no way for him to
[1:34:34] live
[1:34:35] they had washed my system out nine times
[1:34:39] and found gobs of gangrene all through
[1:34:42] it
[1:34:43] are you with me amen but this young man
[1:34:46] was 20 years old
[1:34:48] a sinner and i want to tell you
[1:34:51] something
[1:34:52] and i probably have said this here
[1:34:53] before i was
[1:34:55] if i could only be as good a christian
[1:34:58] as i was a good sinner
[1:35:01] but i had made a promise to god when i
