meeting uh brother Christine will be coming from the UK and some of the brothers down from Iowa we just want to have a Saturday night of worship prayers and then uh our regular Sunday service so that is for the first weekend in March praise the Lord amen this morning we uh we played u a tip a message that was preached 68 years ago if I'm right with my calculation in the City of Minneapolis brother Brandon was here he preached that message when love projects and uh I was I was actually uh listening to it and and he said this he said this and that's what caught my attention for those to uh play it if we can just read that Sunday school Cote that uh he says now perhaps this morning we take uh uh up this challenge I think if I wear my glasses I'll be able read from back there then I won't uh take my neck from my off my shoulder now perhaps this morning we take up this challenge all glory all the glory all the power all that God has given to us is here in this morning uh giv to us year in this morning and the great thing that we have seen how many laid on their face last night and and uh BL cried and sighed for the abomination of Minneapolis see there you are he only Mark those kind making that comparison of e of Ezekiel chapter 9 when the angel went through the city marking those that sight and cry for the city and uh and and this is our city praise the Lord this is our city we all knows uh uh a couple of things we experienced few years ago with all the riots and all of that thank God we don't have that but yet uh with with the increased uh crime rapes around the country Minneapolis is not less this is our city it's uh is uh we don't have to wait for things to come to uh to the footstep of our doors before we know that these things are reality many of us know yet on the news of uh uh uh uh what happened there in in Houston Texas with uh shooting over there in uh uh uh you know that uh Jo Austin group and all of that you know uh uh and and I mean that's that's the time that we are living in there is not a day that go by without a gun shooting there is not a day that goes by without violence in the city and and as Sons and Daughters of God that is our responsibility we must not only think about our children think about our family you know think about the Saints in church that's wonderful that's our responsibility we all one another there but let's side and cry for the Abomination that is done in this city amen praise the Lord and uh so there that is that's my take from the Sunday school tipe that was played this morning and uh we we want to go back to our our our series we've been talking about uh since the beginning of the year the beginning the beginning has been a series that we've been talking about we on our our six beginning uh the elected lady we have one more beginning uh to be able to close the entire beginning series we took seven beginning from from June John uh uh St John writing not his gospel but uh the three other chapters that he wrote to the church the church of Ephesus and to many of the other churches that benefited from that writing we we got this inspiration talking about how John was affected he was affected by the vision that he saw on the island of pmos it affected him in so much that uh uh when he uh came from the island of pmos he started to see things in sants with all the Sant that he saw on the island of pmos seven Church ages seven Angel seven messenger and and and all of those things affected him that he started to see things in servants and and if you get that in your head and you're reading John gospel you can't help but you you you will see a lot of things that John just put in servants there are many you could bring out but he was so affected by the pattern that he saw on the Isen of pmos so so that's the reason why we choose to bring out these seven Beginnings that he mentioned in first John second John and third John so we took second John and where he talks about the elect lady the elected lady and we title it the elected lady from the beginning because when John saw uh uh uh Revelation chapter 19 and uh it was it was said behold uh uh you know uh uh uh the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready after that experience John couldn't help but uh realized that uh uh this lady that is the bride that had made herself ready came started all the way from Genesis she started all the way from Genesis making herself ready are we together now so uh uh that's that's what we we've been we've been talking about and uh uh uh and we want to continue in that light so let's just stand on our feet we're going to start right right there then uh the elected lady from the beginning I tried to to uh I was trying to be FY so you know you get into all of these things it start becoming your toy you're trying to play it and look for colors and all of that so I said let me try this background and see how it will come up I hope you can be able to see amen amen if you can see tell me at the end of the service I will change it on my next slide praise the Lord amen but there there uh there uh our was strip scure we want to we want to read from this morning 2 John chapter 1 the first time we read this was on a Wednesday night we read the 13 verses and it was amazing as he he talks about the elect lady and he he wrote and the scholars put it in 13 verses and we pick that up 13 as the number of a woman praise the Lord and uh uh so let let's just read uh uh second joh John chapter 1 this this will actually be verse one and two the elect unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also all they that have known the truth for the truth's sake now you have to know for the truth's sake is not this truth that he's talking about is not that I'm telling you the truth right the truth he's talking about is Jesus the truth Jesus identified himself that I am the way the truth and the life praise the Lord I I want to give you an assignment go and read the book of Acts you will realize that the early Christians before even they were called Christian when Jesus said I am the way they took that as their identity when Paul said their way that they call heresy their way that is called heresy which mean the Believers were they used to like we call ourself message believers they call themselves The Way We are the people of the way praise the Lord amen that's that's another that's another subject that's another subject but if you if you read the book of Acts and and if you just go through your Bible concordance and you just you just search out our way in the book of act you will realize that in the way that is expressed it was more like an identification to the early Christians then just saying you know uh uh this way no they were refering to Jesus yes Lord because he called himself the way so our calling God has set a path that we need to follow the cherubin in the Garden of Eden they were guiding their way to the treade of life so Jesus Calling himself the way it was not like uh uh uh like the way other religions or other you know uh uh uh people want to talk about it thank you thank you and uh uh so when John is speaking yet and he says the he unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and that I own it but Al but also all they that have known the truth for the truth's sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us forever the truth promis that he will never leave us he will never forsake us praise the Lord you see this truth is an identification is an identification you see signs have been able to make a lie detector they can never make a truth detector because the truth detector is God himself yes right so true and the reason why they make a lie detector is because we were not made to tell lies let's pray together heavenly father as we get into this subject this this morning I'm I'm I'm trusting that your grace will come Lord and and help us Lord father you kind of for change our course of Direction this morning Lord around three father God telling this subject but uh you know the purpose Lord you know the desire father maybe it is just for one person Lord God father Lord because you are the one that leave the 9 to9 and go after one father Lord God I I prayed and ask Lord God that uh if there is one let me be that one Lord and father we just want to ask your blessings oh God this morning upon the congregation of your people but let something be said of internal value that will that will draw us closer to you we commit ourself in your hands this morning bless your word in Jesus name amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so as we look at the subject of the elected lady we realize that uh uh uh we we see here uh as we as we took the subject over this this is where this is where John got his his attraction to call the church an elect lady I was I was looking through some commentary and and someone was suggesting that John was writing this letter to Mary as the elect lady she's a type of the elect lady but she's not the elect lady praise the Lord amen she was elected in whatever she was called to do and just like we will see also this morning we will be dwelling on the character of Esther Esther was also elected Rahab was elected to save the the the spies Ruth was elected in the feet of boas and you and myself we are elected for this day amen for this age for this time this is our time yes if there was ever re reason why uh uh uh uh we were born is for this reason is for this moment is for this time in history like we will see it in the scripture so we see here uh uh uh Revelation chapter 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted the the the the the wife had made herself ready keep keep Esther in mind we we would dwell a whole lot in Esther because like I said I I I I had this subject on my mind I was going in a complete different way but something hit me and uh uh as I was studying uh I I I got I was I was studying something and uh uh I realized that uh the Book of Esther whole held the revelation of God's Providence that's what we want to talk about this morning God Providence God Intervention when God intervene in our life even when we don't ask him to that's his Providence amen as we sit here we all have one need or another on our mind as God said in heaven he thinking about the whole word I'm thinking about only my need God is thinking about the entire world he's thinking about the ones that are in church he's thinking about the ones that are on the street the homeless people the ones in the in the somebody that is struggling with drugs he say oh my dear creature he's he's thinking about his Providence we we get we get into that so but here said the scripture says uh uh Rejoice be glad give honor for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready Paul uh John thinking about here the marriage of the Lamb the first time he was stand on the River Jordan and yet John the Baptist saying Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the marriage of the Lamb he seing this thing here he realized that back in Eden God had to slay a lamb to to to uh h h h redeem bring his children back into Fellowship so when John is hearing this thing in a vision his mind is going wide his mind is going back to the beginning who is this woman is this the woman that was represented in Genesis chapter 1 when God made man male and female created he them right amen so joh mind is going why because the Bible is saying the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raay whatever she used to get herself ready was given to her whatever you would need to get yourself ready is given to you amen it's in your hands praise the Lord whatever you need to be able to deal with your situation is in your hands praise the Lorden to her was granted that she should be array in fine laning clean and white for the fine laning is the righteousness of the Saints and he said unto me right he was the Scribe write this John blessed I they there uh uh blessed I did which I called onto the marage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are a truth saying of God it's a truth saying this is going to happen amen this is not a dream it's not a vision that would just fade away it's a truth saying there will be a Rapture people amen amen there will be a rapture butam says here in marriage of the Lamb he says uh uh and and and and we know that there is going to be a bride why because John saw her amen amen why because she's being played out right from Genesis there is going to be a bride no matter how worse the church get there is going to be a bride amen amen praise the Lord the same God that could bring a a ging out of the chaos in the beginning amen amen is able to bring a bride out of the chaos of laition there is going to be a bride are we together and there's going to be a wedding supper self in the sky no matter what you are doing in this life please prepare for that amen make make that make that uh h a part of your daily plans get something packed together or unpack I think we need more to unpack than pack for this wedding supper and there's going to be a wedding supper in the scy there just as sure to be as God is if you believe that there is God you have to believe that this is the word of God and it's going to happen am it's going to happen praise the lord it's going to happen let me tell you something if you miss it there is no way we can tell you about it right if you miss the wedding supper There is no way we can tell you about it it's not like we going for a wedding over over here to Chicago we come back and tell you how the way if you miss this one there is no way we can tell you about it that's right amen praise the Lord that's just as short as God is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they are going to appear before him without spot or rinkle he that said it he's able to bring us there yes sir amen if it's not us it's not us us working ourself he said he will he will present himself he will present himself a bride without spot or wrinkle you know I was I was I was lying down and thinking on something one not I don't know what it is and oh no I was listening to a to to a message I was listening to a brother preaching and then uh the thought just hit my mind uh uh I think we spoke about that before but it just hit my mind in a different way to see how Grace how Grace was in the lineage of Jesus Christ amen mistress Grace this elected woman how she was in the lineage of Jesus Christ because as we see there in Matthew chapter uh one we brought it out to you there are five women mentioned in the lineage of Jesus Christ praise the Lord five women that are mentioned in the lineage of Jesus Christ the fifth will be Mary the mother of Jesus she will be this virgin G that was visited by the angel Gabriel the same angel that visited Daniel that same Angel uh visited Mary and and and told her about about this promise that God made 700 years before then and but before God before God could get a virgin before he could get a virgin to bring forth himself he brought for himself true tamama amen they had an insect with her father-in-law an insect re uh relationship if if we call it like that way had a child for her father father-in Lord before he could bring himself through uh uh uh h a virgin he brought himself through Rahab a street prostitute in Jericho are we together amen before he could bring himself through a virgin God said I will I will I will present myself a bride with our spot oreno which mean a virgin bride but before we get to be a virgin bride he take us from the West State of life it is not your natural birth that makes you a virgin bride no before he got to the place of being a ver of getting a virgin expressing himself through a virgin he brought himself through Ruth a moabit yes and the history of the moabit was Lot having children with his own daughters because his wife turned to a pillow of salt so there is no worst state that God can get you out of Amen praise the Lord before he got himself through a virgin bride he got himself through an adulterous act when David killed uras be if the fourth woman name her name is now called but she's referred to as uriah's wife God never erased that he never erased that that even in his lineage in the lineage of Jesus Christ it is mentioned uriah's wife are we together so don't make excuses of you your failures says oh well because I was born like this so there's no way I can be a bride of Jesus Christ no don't make don't make mistakes of your failures praise the Lord amen amen you never kill a man to marry to to sleep with his wife who did that here praise the Lord you have not done that let me not go through all of that I might just take a much time here but it just it just it just hit me to see how Grace was in the lineage five is the number of Grace amen before Grace would get a virgin Grace got the worst it praise the Lord so and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they are going to uh to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material the bride was given it was given unto her that's why Revelation chapter 19 said it was given unto her Lord to make herself ready yes sir whatever that is needed God has gone through seven Church ages God has raised up men through the history to be able to give us the pure word of God Amen to leave leave room for no excuse yes and and and and they have the material on earth now to make themsel ready yes if you notice it said she has made herself ready yes sir she has made herself it was not her pastor that made her ready she has made herself ready it's not the church that she went to that make her ready she made herself ready because she got into the word yes sir she took the word to deal with the issues in her life to deal with the issues in her home in her in her community amen are we together [Music] amen oh it looks like I did something okay yeah no I'm I'm I'm I'm using that and I'm thinking that it's also so flippy mine my iPad so I see a flip there but it's not Chang here praise the Lord bear with me I'm going to catchup you remember this statement it's a it's a very familiar statement we all should remember that if we are reading our Bible who who knoweth whether thou I come to the kingdom for such a time as this that was what Modi said to Esther who know whether thou I come to the kingdom for such a time as this that's Providence Providence brought you here there is no time in your life that Providence could get you to where you are than this time Providence is a Divine guidance and Care God's Intervention when God intervene when we don't call him and he just show up when we were not even needing him and he just show upall Providence that's one of the thing we want to talk about we want to see how Providence Place place this elected lady to where she was there were many women on the street in Jericho why a had to be Rahab those spies never went down leaving h h Cana with a note in their hand with a name called Rahab let's look for Rahab no they never had that they were not looking for a particular name but Providence make them to bomb into her right Providence make her to be interested in those men Providence will put Rahab to the place where she will she will hide those men knowing that her leaders are looking for this man you think about it it's all in the newspaper Jericho has got an alarm the israels are coming it's all in the newspaper you get M you see the newspaper they cross the Red Sea and this is what is happening do you know what kind of a favor she will have got if she will have locked those men in her house and ran down and call the local police and say I got two Israelites right you you know the kind of a favor how she will have she will have raising to rank in the society but Providence Providence made her to hide them she put her own life in danger when she hid them on the roof praise the Lord God's intervention took this from where is he King of the Jews we believe our gathering this morning father was in th wise Providence there is nothing foolish to you nope nope there is nothing foolish to God God don't have no stupid praise the Lord Isaiah the prophet the prophet Isaiah prophesied that even the fool will not H In God's Presence God don't play stupid are we together God play business am he means business praise the Lord and when we start meaning business then we will get we will get God in our corner there is nothing foolish to you everything everything that you provide is perfect men and women come from different parts of the country certain year you brought them by your spirit in a mysterious way I don't care whether you wash your car yesterday you p gas in it uh uh you know that your card is perfect for you to leave your house to be here this morning is mysterious praise the Lord you might not see the mystery about it but it's mysterious are we together praise the Lord amen because if there is anything that the devil will would do purposefully do is to stop you from being in the presence of God Paul said this he said 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 10 by the grace of God I am what I am that's Providence that's Providence that's Providence you can never knock your chest before God whatever you are whoever you are Grace Make You Dead wherever you are and Paul who says that I am what I am by the grace of God and the grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain praise the Lord you can Trum Grace you can you can make it a dis Grace but God's grace is never in vain praise the lord it's never in vain the grace of God which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but I labor more abundantly than they are yet not I but the grace of God which was with me Paul in every area of his life having the privilege to get a Roman citizenship going to one of the best school have the best calamia as his teacher and and and everything that he went through to find himself holding this message of Grace praise the Lord he say if I'm anything is the grace of God that's Providence that's Providence the message is Wonder to perform and if you did just notice how it could have not have happened in in another time how God in his great wi Providence wise Providence how that he he moved every clock just to hit at the right time and that gave us Faith sometimes when we think oh everything is top SE to and there's no way out don't think that God's making it work just exactly I call him to his times program that's Providence praise the Lord like I said I was I was completely going a different way this with this subject and as I was looking through uh uh preach on the elected lady many times many times uh Nigeria know me for that that's one of my subject I preach over uh uh uh but uh as I was looking at the subject I had Esther in my mind but I was I was I was I was uh I was not going to dwell on her in a way that I did but as I was looking through it I decided to go back and look at some things and uh uh that that was when I really started seeing this whole this whole revelation of Providence that was hid in the life of Esther because if you read the book of Esther like eser will say theologians will say you never find the name of God in the Book of Esther you never find the name of God in the Book of Esther no reference to worship and Faith directly but you see Esther is projecting faith when she says tell Hima you prayed if I die I die right that's a statement of faith yes right but yet the scholars are saying there is no worship there is no faith in Esther they are they also saying it does not predate anything about the mesiah no mention of Heaven and Hell and even Luther uh uh uh Martin Luther the great reformer he's he's the one that I got this quote from uh from from in one of his things that he wrote about the the Book of Esther he says um uh I am so great an enemy to the second book of the maab and to Esther that it that I wish they had not come to us at all for they have too many hidden so you you see you you you see that and that's why he was a reformer amen amen he was a reformer h h h had this inspiration of bringing the church out of catholism but the four world was not there amen even at a place where he he called the Jews the Antichrist he was a reformer so uh uh uh uh but that that's what that's what scholar thinks about the Book of Esther but what what they don't see in the Book of Esther is that the name of God is mentioned the Jews will tell you that uh because the book was written in Hebrew and if you if you read the book in Hebrew that the Jews has been able to find their unpronouncable name of God many people call it Yahweh the Jews would call it heavy V that uh that name that is spelled yhw now now there they will tell you that in in in in in four different sequence they have been able to find the name of God they have being able to find that unpronouncable name of God in the Book of Esther I was looking at some of that during the week but it's it's not uh I don't have the brain for all of that I'm just bringing this as information just to be able to make uh uh this is uh uh make a background for where we want to go it's not a theological study and another thing a Jews uh uh uh historian says the name of Esther means something hidden praise the Lord amen and Providence is something hidden God's Providence God's intervention we say he's an ontime God he don't always come when we want him right amen but God is never too early and he's never late amen am he's always on time praise the Lord amen are we together now so when you look at this this this whole thing it grabs your attention you you you want to see this Providence and and that is the place where I took my whole twist yesterday and uh uh you know when when I when I caught this so I'm actually getting going farther away from the way that I thought I would I will bring this subject uh so we want we want to see that area of Providence because uh just like we said is is for time like this there was a time that came in Esther life where Mory had to remind her that it was for time like this that you were raising up praise the Lord and and if you read the book of yes sir Maliki make it clear to her if you don't do nothing about it God will do something amen amen amen so don't don't think that we are relying on you when God promised to build his church he said I will build my church he never says h h h you know brother one or some kind of a Preacher uh uh for somebody to make thems indispensable that without you nothing can happen get out of the way God will raise men amen that's right amen God told I mean Mali told Esther if you don't do nothing let me let you know God will do something am praise the Lord I believe he was standing at the same place of shedra mishad and abeno our God will deliver us even if he done we are not going to bow down so we want to see that Provident we want to see how this whole thing came how the whole thing came in and the Book of Esther is actually raing in a period of time where Israel h h h uh uh uh uh have had an aile from from from Babylon and there were certain Jews that decided to stay back they decided to say you have to remember sarus you know helped them to build the city and go back but certain Jews decided to stay in the land of the m and in Persian and this is the time that took place so the the whole setting of Esther is right in between the time of Ezra and neemias are we together amen now let's get on our journey this is what is going to take uh uh uh uh uh this is what is going to take a very interesting you know place I I want to bring this to you now as a as a remembrance before we get into our whole thing of Esther if you if you see can is can you see okay are you seeing okay praise the lord it's it's not too clear okay so I got to change this s think maybe I just stick with my black and white okay now but uh what what what is this is that uh we'll be reading from uh Exodus chapter 17 you can put the scripture down and then you can get the whole story when you get back home but Exodus chapter 17 this is the period of time where Israel is on their Journey they are out of the land of Egypt they are on their Journey this will be the first battle this will be the first group of people that will stand in the way of Israel there's the amalik the amalekites the amalec they will be the first one this is where the battle where uh the Lord told them to raise the hand of Moses just to give you a background but this is the picture I want you to grab as we look here because these people were stopping Israel from going into their promised land they were becoming a storing block oh God knows how to deal with storing block amen amen amen God knows how to deal with stomy block yes because when God made his promise his promise have to come to pass and there is nothing that is going to stand in his way amen these were the first group of people that stopped Israel and see how God would deal with faith the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of of Joshua for I will utterly P out the remembrance of amalik from under Heaven God is saying I'm going to WEP them out I'm going to WEP them out there is lot of things that explaining in the political spheres of Jerusalem and Hamas I don't want to get into that I'm not a politician but one thing I always say is prophecy is stronger than politics praise the Lord this is the people that is stopping stopping God they are stopping God from bringing his promise to pass the very reason why God would tell so why persecute th me is because God is in the midst of his people that's the reason why he said if you do something to any of my little ones it's better you put a millstone on your neck and dash yourself in the seed because I'm not going to let it go that's how much God is involved in his church that's how much God is involved among his people he told Moses I want to come down and dwell with you and make you all a treasure of priest amen a kingdom of priest the God we serve is not a distant God it's not a God that sits in an imaginary Heaven no he's here he's Among Us he's a god that is among us and he's interested in our Affairs that's what I said if you get in business with God God don't play stupid and neither is he playing games praise the Lord and here's a group of people that are trying to make themselves a hindrance to Israel trying to make thems a hands to the exitor when God said I will come down that's what he told Abraham I will come down and with a mighty hand I will deliver them amen I will bring them into this land that I have given to you and the Lord said unto Moses write it in the book of Memorial and rehearse it in the in the ears of Joshua I will Ally put out the remembrance of amalec from under the heaven and Moses build an altar and called the name Jehovah Nishi that's where that name that was where God expressed himself that I will defend you from these people I will defend you now listen to what the Lord says here he says he said because the Lord have shown that the Lord will have war is no longer Israel having war with amalec there myself in war amen amen praise the Lord amen this is a parent that is saying you touch my child child get back here deal with me he's saying I'm having war with [Music] amalec I made the heavens and the earth I will blood them out are we together amen he says I have sown that the Lord will have war with AMC from generation to generation praise the Lord God is saying I will always raise up somebody that will have the courage until I terminate amalec from under the heavens from generation to generation I will always raise up somebody amen praise the Lord you want to stop my promise praise the Lord you want to stop my promise you want to bring reproach against me are we together amen let's look at this also God rehearsed the same promise over in the book of Deuteronomy 25 you can read the entire chapter he said remember what amalec did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt how he met thee by the way and uh uh and SM the the high most of thee even all that were feeble behind thee so they were they they were they were they were they were they were uh killing the old people and and you know uh uh uh afraid of the man of war but dealing with the people that were vulnerable amen amen even the feeble behind thee when thou were faint and weary and he fear not God therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God have given thee rest from all thine enemies around about in the land which the Lord thy God have given thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shall blood out prise God their remembrance thou shall blot out their remembrance of amalik from under Heaven thou shall not forget it praise the Lord forget your name but don't forget praise the Lord amen if anything that is standing your way as a storing block from getting to the promise amen are we together you see the progression we are we are talking about Divine Providence is that what we talking about amen Follow Me Now 1 Samuel chapter 15 we got to go quick cuz I'm doing a lot of uh Bible study when I'm supposed to be preaching or am I preaching let's go 1 Samuel chapter 15 Saul or Samuel also said unto Saul listen to this so you can be able to grab the picture Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore heing there onto the voice of the word of the Lord thus say the Lord amen okay thus say the Lord of hosts I remember that which am like did to Israel this is God speaking this is God speaking the same way that he take our labor of love to his heart and in the Book of Revelation he says I remember your labor of love that's the same way God remember he told Moses I remember what I said to Abraham God remember yes praise the Lord that's the reason why God will never be inde deped to no man because God remember and he pay his debts he remember and he pay his debts I remember that which amalec did to Israel how he laid with he laid wait for them in the way when he came up to Egypt and go and smart amalec and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them n but slay both men women infants sucklings which which mean babies oxin sheeps cell everything everything amen praise the Lord everything this is going to is is going to get the eight years why how can this be a loving God he has a right to do it because he created it he has a right to do it because he created it he can WEP the whole thing out and start a new one he don't want to do it he want to show to these ones that he have created I'm the one in charge are we together am now what I want you to see God's said I will have war with am from generation to generation the reason why Saul was raised up his purpose he purpose in life that God raised him up trained him he went looking for his father H H eyes that was lost and all of that God God in intervention at the time he was not expecting God stepped on the scene and got his atten that he will come in the presence of a of of of of of the Prophet he's even he's even doubtful of himself am I not a benjamite there's a story to that but I I will leave that for now and uh uh uh but the this is the reason why this is the reason and the reason why Saul lost theing kingom is because he lost God's purpose the reason why God set him on the throne he missed it this was the reason I eliminate AMC he lost it he lost it and that is that is the same thing to each and every one of us we have a reason why this Grace has come before us let me tell you you lost this opportunity you're going to live a life of wondering you will just wonder you make all the money you can never be satisfied that's right you have other women you they can never be nice to you praise the Lord amen because that was not your purpose that was not your purpose this was his purpose when he lost this the Bible says he started inan that was when he started throwing javelins at David wow he started getting angry he want to kill his own son this was his purpose amen watch and see let's read the next scripture praise the Lord amen are you having fun yet amen praise the Lorden okay this thing can turn there on the phone we really be having fun looks like uh okay technicians would deal with that praise the Lord Grace let's move to sfil okay thank you now watch here the the Bible says here Samuel instructing him and told him anoint him King and says go take care of the amlet woman men children babies animals wepe everything out everything that is called AMC I say I will take their remembrance from under the heavens that's what God Said now watch here now and saw smart the the amalekites from Heaven until they come to sh that was over against Egypt and he took AA the king of AMC aive if you take the king you have not done nothing because he's the head of the people if you save the king you save the nation and he took ha the king alive and and Al toly destroy all the people with the asge of the SW but Saul and his people SP a and the best of the sheep and The Oxen and the fatling and the lamb and all that I good and will not utter destroy them but everything that was alive that everything that was vow and refused there they destroy Ally which mean he just went for all the all the the ones that were not good praise the Lord amen and to him you see it it is this thing that's that's where the church has got herself that's where we have got ourself we want to help God we want to help God praise the Lord you never have God to bring you here praise the Lord and when we think that we have a better idea we have to make the church moding we we have to to to to turn bring our life in a moding style of life and and everything everything that that that that comes up we want to be part of it we want to taste everything that comes from H the son there is God raised him up for a purpose when when when the when when the scepter is promised to Judah and God will bring Benjamin that's a reason why if you go back to the judge to the Book of Judges you will see why God brought Benjamin into the into that place but it will not go there now for now and brought him to this place God gave him a promise a throne an inheritance even to your children praise the Lord and because of our wly friendship we want to keep our wly status two cannot walk that's what Amos said except it be agreed Amos said that he it means that if you want to walk with God you must come on the terms of his word yes amen praise the Lord the only God that can come on your terms is the god that you have made the God you made that the god that can come on your terms the one that made you you must come on his terms that's right amen are we together let's not get in all of these gender things let's leave it like that we already know they are where they are let's leave it like that let's talk to ourself that's right then came the word of the Lord to Samuel saying it repent me that I have set off saw to be king God saying that oh God May that never be said of me amen and God will say it repent me that I made a man that's supposed to be a Son of God that God has given you the greatest opportunity to see the move of God in this last day and then you would take an attitude to the message you take an attitude to the word of God praise the Lord you want to try the word try the word try the word it's there it's an open field you want will pierce up all over your body try it but a God will give bring you into Providence Providence will give you parents praise the Lord Providence will give you parents with all of their life mistake have come to the message of the hour and want to raise you by the message and children will turn to their parents and you your say you made mistake when you were growing praise the Lord God will wake up Samuel from his sleep and say Samuel see what Saul has done it regret it repent me which of course that word is not the same as the New Testament repentance it's a it's a word that means it changed my mind that's where Saul lost the kingdom that's where he lost the kingdom praise the Lord it repent me that I have set up Saul to be king for he is turned back from foll me he thought that he was doing something to please God what will he tell Samuel I save all of these sheep to make sacrifice God told you he had run out of sheeps amen he told you that he had run out of sheeps he had run out of uh H H inspiration that we got to bring W in the [Music] church we got to make we got to form our own way so we can we can make members God told you that he had lost the Holy Ghost to change man heart he told you that the power of conviction has been taken away amen that we must substitute it for games and substitute it for different things just so we can we can we can make church God he has turned his back from following me think about it he never left church he never left church it was something he did in his heart something he was trying to earnestly do and God considered that that he had turned his back from following me you can sit right in this church and be away from God praise the Lord you can be faithful in paying your ties and be away from God he has turned us back from following me and have not performed my commandment that's what God is interested in he never did my word if you leave the word of God you have left God you have left God you leave the principle of God's word you have left God you are only making a god of your imagination are we together amen he have not performed my commandment and the Bible says and it grieved Samuel and he cried he cried onto the Lord all night a man is satisfying his own desire and here is another man that is burdened with his Arrow amen yes another man that is burdened with his error and crying to God praise the Lord [Music] amen sometimes you don't we don't know we don't have to tell you everything but this is not a game show it's not a game show praise the Lord amen there are things we know you see people going through it gives you sleepest night you stay up you cry you deny yourself you fast and pray that God get to this person help this situation because sometimes you you try to talk to people to become they become arrogant who you think you are I'm nobody I'm I'm I'm just I'm just a sevenant to you I'm not your boss I'm placed here to serve you and have one person to report is almighty God oh yes yes Lord when he plac thing on my heart I I should I should do it Faithfully because it's him I'm going to report I don't look at your attitude let's one man disobeying God's word is causing another man sleep the Bible say he pray all not crying to God why because when a king has gone out of the word of God the whole Land Is Lost amen the people has rejected the prophet they wanted a king yes a king that has turned his back on God not fulfilling God's commandment Samuel as a prophet he's worried we are exposed when you leave the word of God you are naked I don't care what kind of a faction clothes you you you buy yourself to wear if it is not what God want you to wear the de say you are naked before God you can wear your two2 $300 cloth God see you as a straight bare naked person in the street are we together now we are looking at Providence but we just got a history here and this history take us back to the beginning of the church it take us back to the beginning of Israel joining where God is standing up for Israel and says these people God himself is the one that says I will bring them out with a mighty hand yes the the Egyptian you see today you will see them no more forever God was taking his people to his promise Amen to the promised land and here's a nation here that came and Israel beg these people just let them pass we will not take nothing from you we don't want anything we just want to pass they said no they said no praise the Lord and now God says you now you now have issue with me if unless I'm not the one that made the Heaven and Earth but as long as Heaven and Earth remains I will block you out completely are we together now so this failure this particular failure of sa what have he done he have it have allow the lineage of amalik to continue praise the Lord amen amen because Saul will will later kill the king of AA but there were some men that have already escaped okay amen amen so some of the sons of haar have already escaped you will see what I'm going with this you will see what I'm going with this it looks like a lot of uh Bible reading I'm not even got to my message yet but I just want to bring you to this place of Providence now look at this the Bible now will give us a story yet I have a topic that I called Moi background amen the Bible will give us a story here now that that is about David when uh when uh Absalon came against David and David own son kick him from the throne he was paying for his wrong that he have done but let's let's go on the Bible says and when David came to baham behold then came out a man of the family of the House of Saul whose name was shimia amen a son of girro he came forth and cursed still as he came he was just ruing curses on David and and and and he cast stone at David and his Serv and all the people the mighty men that were with David and uh uh uh now this Gody is cursing David now oh you you you are the one that uh that that makes s to lose the throne you know he's cursing David he's taking this thing as a trouble problem he's not seeing that Saul disobeyed God he's not seeing that God was the one that makes Saul King and God was the one that took the kingdom of Saul he's now making the David's problem he's curing David he's throwing stone at David if you go down in the reading one of David men got so angry abishai and he says why should I allow this dog to spit on my king praise the Lord David told him leave leave him maybe God told him to do it maybe by this I might find Mercy before God praise the Lord let me speed you now if you go further after David was now being brought back to the kingdom here is shimad year seeking repentance praise the Lord in chapter 19 there came over a fot to carry over the king household so they brought a fairy Bo to carry the king back over to Jerusalem and to do what he taught good and shim the son of jira fell down before the king as he was come over Jordan and he said unto the king let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to heart for th servant does know that I have seen it now so he's trying to make his way right he's trying to make his way right there's a reason why I'm bringing these two things to you and this is the reason if you look here you will see that uh uh uh in in uh uh uh 2 Samuel chapter 16 that we have just read amen amen okay shim repentance okay yeah this is where I'm supposed to be sorry sorry now so we see here H H uh if you look in Esther you go back now to Esther see see how we how how the whole thing is going to play out here if you are follow me you enjoy it if not uh I don't know where you are now so you see your eser chapter 2 verse 5 now in shushan the palace there was a certain Jewel whose name was Modi the son of J the son of shimi the son of Kish a benjamite so when David Spar shimit he was making provision for Miki wow Providence that's good amen when David Spar shimi wow and David never knew this now that he was thinking about it because the time of Esther is far in front of David are we together now watch this one also Esther chapter 3 and the King took his ring from his hand and gave it unto hermer the the Troublemaker the guy that is want to uh uh terminate the Jews the son of hind dat the agite now aide here is the king of of what AMC yes the one that saw spare yes are you seeing the Providence why because God make a promise he made a promise to eliminate these people and now he's making Providence he's making provision to be able to keep his promise so David Spar the king of God saw Spar shimi are we together amen I just don't want to read a lot of bible verses to you I want you to grab the picture of God's Providence praise the Lord amen God knows how to move you in a certain place yes even if he he will have to keep you there for 3 years or 5 years or what be when he want to deal with certain things he knows how to do that's God's Providence he said you have not choosen me I have choosen you praise the Lord and he knows how to deal with things in our lives he know how to bring us to the place where he want us to be that's righten praise the Lord amen now you see the thing about it there is that we get lazy yeah God knows how to do this thing I'm I'm just going to lay back and let God do it well you have not come to the recognition that Providence has been watching over your life you are not appreciating the grace of God that have kept you alive till now amen praise the Lord amen because you say well if God you know God can save me and I just jump in the sea he will bring he will reach his hand down he knows how to save you he can also allow you to be theread and save you from this word right that's another way of saving you that's right allow you to be there we bury you you are safe under the ground you are not going to be drowned you are not going to be stupid anymore that's another way of saving you he knows how to do that praise the Lord but see see the picture I'm trying to bring to you here is that God made that promise back there he watched over his word and here it said there is that down in the Captivity of the missions and the person after the Babylonian captivity God kept this man Miki at a place where he was able to take his uh his brother's daughter or Uncle daughter whoever that Esther was and and all of these things Miki just being a good Jew he loved the Lord you know he dedicated his life to serve the Lord having no thought in his mind that the promise that God made to to eliminate the amalaki will have his final end wow wow never even knew that all of his life when he took this girl whether her parents passed away he fell in love with when he took this girl never knew it was not in his mind yeah that this is what was going to happen but all along God knew sir prise all alone God knew it never came to him by surprise that's [Music] right are you seeing the picture now for what reason the Bible here will call this guy the Jews enemy for some reason being a son of an amalec praise the Lord amen you remember when Saul died there was a guy that ran over to David trying to win his favor right right and say oh my Lord oh my Lord I just came from the battle and uh you know and saw and just when he never s trying to win David favor he lie on himself that I care sword right the man that been hunting your life David say who son you are he says I'm an AM malachite yes David spit on the ground and said before my spit dry he hair should not be on his shoulder and a malachite amen you put your hand on a son of of of EZ yes sir when God has given us a word to eliminate you people from all the Earth you see that's that's that's how God's children take God's word important it could be easier for David to say oh give me half five thank you you are a nice guide he knew what the word of God said no investigation you are an AM malachite you Brave to come to me to tell me that you kill the [Music] king when we take the word of God in our lives when we take it to be the very breath that we breathe you can't get favor until God give it to you so why Try to please people and try to rub arms with them and if God don't give it to you you won't get it you are what you are by the grace of God you are where you are by the grace of God whether you appreciate on that God the god of the universe is responsible for you whether you believe him or not he's responsible for you at the end of the day he will have his way in your life he bring you to heaven or he send you to hell does not make no difference to [Music] him God don't provide for you because you come to church he provide for you because he gave you birth to live so he's responsible for you Providence Providence will now set our seen in the Book of Ruth uh the Book of Esther sorry I took a lot of time yet taking us from one scripture to another I realize my time is gone so you you you see the picture here but there is something I want to I want to come to before we close here and and and uh uh so it said our our our whole picture this whole elected lady why Esther why Esther God was just only showing his revelation of Providence that his word will not return back to him vow whatever he said he's going to do it he will keep his word if God promised to give you the Holy Ghost it's because you are a son of God you are bound to have it he desire his desire to give it to you is more than you want it it's more than you want it praise the Lord so he said our will whole senor go read the book of Esther you get the picture you get right there in the in the in the in the first chapter of the Bible talking about King has a serious calling for the feast now if you don't get the background you would think that this was a beauty pant it was not a beauty pent that that brought Esther into the into the kingdom it looks like it but it was not a beauty pant praise the Lord let me set a little historical scene here for you hus was going on a battle he was going to Revenge his father darus he was going for the war so this is the way that the the the Kings convince the people according to history he that Feast was a six-month Feast he was trying to ride the people the Army you know celebrating Victory before even to go for the victory praise the Lord that's what a son service is you are celebrating Victory before even the word of God comes true praise the Lord that's that's that's why they did that they celebrate their Victory have a feast and then if you go farther back in the in the story of Esther you will realize that even when Esther became king there was a certain time she will come she can show up to the king she was in a different different Palace than the King right the king had to call her some of the reason there because as as as as as Idol Kings many of them were on the polygamy they had one Queen and many concubines so the queen do not stay in the king's chamber she has her own chamber she can only come when the king call her praise the Lord so now when you follow the you realize that Esther in I mean vasage in her kingdom she was already having something with the women it was now her time to go to the king praise the Lord but now here is the king having this great feast and now he want to he want to celebrate his victory he want he want to bring his wife the Bible says he want to show her faed his wife you must know he's already drunk so let's forget about that one now he's asking her to come at a time when she's not supposed to be in the chamber now she having all own thing going there even though it's it's going to show a a principle here it's going to show a principle and that's what we want to drive to now praise the Lord are we together so the king called vage and V refused to come that's the big word there she refus to come amen she refus to lead her women party and whatever she was doing to give herself now take this now take this uh h h h scholar bring us to this place or the name of God is not in this but you just take it in a shadow form this is a king and we have a king praise the Lord amen God Desiring to use you for a time and a purpose and you telling him that you are not ready yet you want God to come on your time you find many people when I stop doing this then I will serve God if I stop doing it then I will be serious you are just wasting your time amen you are just wasting your time the Bible says why today is called today when you hear the voice of God Harding not your heart if God is dealing with your heart no matter what the condition your life is in that's the best time to step in the water that's right that's the best time to say here am I Lord yes Lord amen praise the Lord because the things that you want to leave before you serve God you can never leave it if God don't take it away from your life yes amen the place you want to get to before you become serious you will never get there until God bring you there are we together now Providence have set this whole thing he called vases down into the feast praise the Lord amen amen he's carrying on this big Feast he's celebrating a victory before a wall that he's going to go in and uh uh uh you know and and and all of that and and and the scripture says she refus a refuser to the king a refuser to the king exterminated vases from the kingdom praise the Lord now see how the prophet of God would take that very same principle and apply it to the church ages whenever a church refus to move on with God God put them away M whenever a church refused to move on in the Revival when Luther came with a message of the judge shall live by faith and the people were just okay and satisfied to organize it God left them in their organization and pick up John Wesley when you refuse to move on with God because he moves the Bible says he the spirit of God what move upon the Water since God dropped to time he has never stand still he kept he keeps moving and even this morning he's moving right in this building he's moving am praise the Lord if you are ready to move on with god let's get Glory if you want to sit down enjoy your pleasure you sit back praise the Lord amen he said he can raise up stones to be children unto him amen when people make excuses in the bi in in the scripture oh they one say I just got married I'm not able to come the other one say I got a big farm the the Bible says he commanded them to go into the street and the byways praise the Lord now that's how Esther was brought into the kingom because of a refusal because of a refuser let's read this two and we'll find a place to close here brother will take this over in uh uh marriage of the Lamb it's a beautiful a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest King in the word of that day he had a great feast and and he called the queen to come sit by him but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated he didn't know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come I think there's a whole lot like Christ today Christ has invited us to sit in Heavenly places with him and we are ashamed now take this what I I want to show you something that is that is Progressive here this was in 1962 that was when he he he preached his message 1962 1965 when he preached marriage and divorce he took the same thought but he took it in a complete different way now realize now the seals are open amen the seals are open follow me now and and and at the are the are the opening of the seal at the opening of the seal let me give you a setting here so you can you can be able to grab this as we as we progress with this thought at the opening of the seal the first thing that will happen is that uh uh uh he will he will he will dedicate a church they will do a dedication they will do a wedding You Preach God in Simplicity praise the Lord amen and uh uh he will start right there in gensing places the first seal he says now I call you Brian praise the Lord so the opening of the seal was actually the opening of the bridegroom's chamber it was now for the bride to come into the secret place yes of her bridegroom which is the mystery that was healing from the foundation of the world praise the Lord it was now where the church will move into more intimate with Christ we stop all of these boyfriend and girlfriend games one time you you are dead another time you are not dead you don't even know which way you going and and all of that no this will be a relationship this will be an intimate affair with Christ that's right that is a bride that have made herself ready praise the Lord are we together now watch now marriage of uh marriage and divorce I I'll try to close here now this this might be very small but just bear with me I try to read it and now you can you can ask for the notes you can ask for the slideing and uh we will we'll give it to you praise the Lord now he says here the bride will have to be on adulterated the word not one word missing nowhere because this is marriage she's taking on the the bridegroom's name fully she has to be the word we have to be the word we have to dwell in the word yes that's what is all about it has to be the word we can never be able to bring forth Christ or the manifestation of Christ if we are just making it up it has to be the word are we together amen certainly now one word missing no word certainly could you imagine a correct BR one breast off and the other one somewhere else or or or or other wrong you know that's not going to be the bride of Christ she's perfect not in herself she's perfect in Christ She's Everything the word now one word fing any word no then he moved on he said notice he he can put her away but she cannot put him away now it all goes back now to that Providence that will bring Esther in Praise the Lord amen he's dealing with this whole marriage and divorce but he's bringing a message he's bringing a message and that's the message that that the bride want she want her responsibility praise the Lord now brother Brandon was preaching to people that make mistakes in their life make mistake in their marriages and he was bringing this subject of marriage and divorce which is a tough subject yeah praise the Lord but you see because there was a message there was there was a voice of God there was a message for the bride behind it that's what we need to get sometimes we get into all the first oh yeah he said this he said this he said but what is the message what is the message what was he trying to get to the bride let's take a little bit of it he did it and he proved it in the days when Luther Wesley and in Pentecost when they refused to become a f part of him by having spiritual sexual Affair To Be become pregnated now you see brother brandham is breaking that expression just like I said the opening of the seal open the bride chamber for the church to go into the fullness of Christ amen amen so right after the wedding what is expected for the woman to be pregnant right so he's he's bringing a l expression so we can be able to grab the weight praise the Lord that when the bride the marriage of the Lamb has come the bride have made her set ready the wedding has take place the the the the chamber is open it's no time for fussing yes praise the Lord are we together now so he's he's he's he's he's bringing that expression that's the same thing that happened to to to to to the Lutheran to Wesley the met the Pentecostal and all of that because they refus to become a further part of him by having spiritual sexual Affair to become pregnated with him with forther part of the word you understand she refused and Luther ref uh the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more Desire with her they were they were okay to just staying with the jge shall by faith they never wanted to move into ification even the reformer Wesley Wesley was writing the thesis he said was struggling with pipe but God was bringing a message of sanctification to put away all the wordness clean our life from all all our mess because there was a further visitation of of the of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost that was going to engage the church to bring us to the opening of the SE amen but they refuse yes so what God did put them away raised up a John Wesley started a message of sanctification [Music] right praise the Lord the Lord TR refuse it and let me say this going to call me something anyhow it is the so it said today with every one of them they fail to take that word they refuse [Music] Christ and any woman that refuse a man his child has no right to be a wife to him amen now take take take their statement take it related to Christ that's right you know why I say related to Christ is because if you take it literally you will ruin your own life that's right praise the Lord When Rachel ask h h h h h Jacob and say give me children Jacob say am I God so that's why you can't take this literally and how many people have take this literally walk out of their home went into adulterate ruin their marriages why because you are not getting the message yeah you are not getting where this prophet of God is going you are using your counter mind wrap up with ftiness and you think the message is encouraging that that's not what he's preaching he's trying to to to allow us to see where we are as a church where we are as the bride of Christ when the scripture said the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen the church must be producing little little maets people that are still loving fasting and praying people that are still loving reading the word seeking the face of God now five times snacking on the word I read the quot of the day I read my favorite Bible verse seek the face of God take it in your in your in your in your in your in your home your natural marriage if you're not spending time with your M you are destroying the home if you are so busy doing everything there is no time you can spend together our husand you are destroying your home that's why he's trying she's projecting here praise the Lord now you have to know I'm not angry with anybody I'm just excited praise the Lord but if you are angry with me please meet me out of church after church let's settle it amen amen God you remember is see where he's bringing it to now you remember in the Bible when the king mared Esther because the queen refused he's using that word refuse and let me let me let me just let me just let me just go in this area a little bit I was down in South Africa this going December and I pray one night I I I had a thought on my mind and and but but I was preaching to that group for the first time I had to hold myself back and say no Lord uh uh uh yeah if if this is what really you want me to preach this is my first time with these people but I I I was break I was break into this thought where and I really wanted to use it for the Youth because I wanted to bring out word right from from from Genesis Genesis chapter 3 asaiah said no weapon form against us shall prosper amen the first weapon that was ever used on mankind was their own body the first weapon that was ever used on mankind was their own body the first physical weapon the spiritual weapon that the devil used was a lie right but lie conditioned their body for them to abuse themselves from the Holiness of God praise the Lord amen amen that's the reason why since that time sex has been a weapon let me say it because it was the devil's successful weapon to bring mankind into his field and he knows that he can get your mind dad by that he knows that he can destroy your body by that he knows that he can ruin your home when you make your body a weapon praise the Lord are you following me and he also know that he can also make your body a weapon to destroy God's purpose when he when he condition our desire to strive for ungodliness and uncleanness the moment the desire is Twist the same body that can desire prayer and desire to you know to serve God desire the best to stand for God word trying our best to say the truth and do what is right that same body when that desire is Twisted it become a weapon in the hands of God we can use our mind to imagine evil use our tongue to talk lie destroy people and and and all of that now but this prophet of God was going more prophetic he was dealing with the church he was bringing the church to a position that when you refuse when you refuse Christ your husband he has a right to put you away put you on the Shelf where you only have the form of godliness and you can never have the power to rise up as a Son of God Amen that's why that's that's where he's bringing us to yes now if we were having a couple retreat I will have gone much into that but I'll leave it for now amen I'll leave it for now until until we have our couple time to talk let me just stay with this uh prophecy of of the Prophet what happened when she refused to come out with the King to obey him the same thing is with a woman that refused to be a wife to her husband and so is it with the church that refuse to come to refuse to be Cal pregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth Children of the age it's not it's not a physical pregnancy it's a spiritual pregnancy just like Peter would say if these things are in you you will not be Barren if you have the virtues in you you will not be baren but you will bring forth manifestation amen am yes amen he will control your Tong if somebody take the car that you wanted to take in the supermarket it would not be the kind of a little thing that would just throw you off and then you are displaying yourself right instead of to find somebody in the supermarket that is that is looked like they are distressed and you are comforting them can I pray for you no you are fighting overcard I was in this eye before you pass on that other side well it's funny it's funny it's funny but what think about think about the thing we get so dramatic about that's right yes how much is it driving us to Christ musicians you can come sorry I've taken a lot of your time I'm sorry for the time I'm not sorry for what I'm
