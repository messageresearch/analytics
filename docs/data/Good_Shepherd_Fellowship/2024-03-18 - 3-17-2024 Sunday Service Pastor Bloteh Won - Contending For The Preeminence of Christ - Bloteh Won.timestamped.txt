[1:00:00] in the book of Jude by inspiration is
[1:00:04] placed in such a unique place in the
[1:00:07] Bible just before the revelation of
[1:00:10] Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] Jude

[1:01:11] unto you and exal you that ye should
[1:01:14] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:01:18] was once delivered onto the
[1:01:21] Saints for there are for there are
[1:01:23] certain men creep in on way word who
[1:01:27] were before of all ordained to this
[1:01:30] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[1:01:33] grace of our God into last viciousness
[1:01:37] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:01:41] Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord now as
[1:01:46] James I mean as Jude goes on and he
[1:01:49] continue to read you can read till the
[1:01:53] last but I would like to read the last
[1:01:55] uh
[1:01:56] uh two verses before we
[1:01:59] close if we had time it would have been
[1:02:01] good to just read verse by verse and and

[1:03:19] your word in Jesus name amen the Lord
[1:03:23] bless you you may have your seat the
[1:03:26] Lord bless you you may have your seat
[1:03:28] this
[1:03:31] morning trying to find how to
[1:03:35] to give ourself a thought to talk about
[1:03:39] this morning I thought we should speak
[1:03:41] on containing for the preeminence of
[1:03:45] Christ containing Jud says uh we must
[1:03:48] earnestly contain for the faith that was
[1:03:51] once delivered to the Saints we know
[1:03:54] that their faith was the faith that Paul
[1:03:57] preached that Faith was the faith that
[1:03:59] was promised by Malachi to be restored
[1:04:02] unto us praise the
[1:04:05] Lord but I try to narrow it down for us
[1:04:08] to be able to see you know because in
[1:04:12] every age in every dispensation there
[1:04:14] was a word that was given to the people
[1:04:17] now if you look in the three four
[1:04:19] mysteries of Christ like we spoke about
[1:04:23] and uh uh uh if uh
[1:04:29] the if
[1:04:31] our technicians will help us and let's
[1:04:34] just put uh Christ is the mystery of God
[1:04:37] up that first
[1:04:39] quote okay now we we quoted this a
[1:04:43] little bit on Wednesday night Christ is
[1:04:45] the mystery of God
[1:04:47] revealed and uh and and what what we
[1:04:51] were what we were trying to look at uh
[1:04:53] in in referring to this is
[1:04:57] there
[1:05:00] uh God great mystery that was in his
[1:05:03] mind like uh brother brandham said God
[1:05:07] had one God and his his plan was a Plan
[1:05:10] of Redemption but yet he had to in some
[1:05:15] way simplify it some way break it down
[1:05:18] to us so in uh in in in the dispensation
[1:05:22] of time he went about unfolding
[1:05:26] the the mystery so this is the three
[1:05:29] four
[1:05:30] purpose the first one is to express
[1:05:34] himself
[1:05:36] completely God was expressing himself he
[1:05:39] he expressed himself little in David
[1:05:42] Express himself lat in danard in Moses
[1:05:45] in
[1:05:46] Joseph but he wanted to have a body
[1:05:50] where he can bring a full
[1:05:53] expression of all the the little
[1:05:57] expression that was Through the Ages and
[1:05:59] he was able to find a
[1:06:01] body and that was
[1:06:04] Christ praise the Lord so God first
[1:06:08] purpose in his mind was for him to
[1:06:12] express himself
[1:06:14] completely because he's a God that love
[1:06:17] to be known he don't want to be hidden
[1:06:21] he want to be known praise the Lord so
[1:06:25] his purpose was to express himself
[1:06:29] completely God in Christ praise the Lord
[1:06:35] amen now the
[1:06:39] second to have the
[1:06:42] preeminence by this in his
[1:06:45] church which is his body his
[1:06:50] bride praise the Lord now pay attention
[1:06:53] now till he could have the preeminence
[1:06:58] to express himself through them now yeah
[1:07:02] he wanted to express himself in one
[1:07:05] man after doing it All Through the Ages
[1:07:10] in bit in
[1:07:11] pieces praise the
[1:07:13] Lord Joseph was a perfect type of
[1:07:18] Christ praise the Lord
[1:07:21] amen but he was not a complete type of
[1:07:25] Christ Christ why because he toore a lie
[1:07:29] right he broke the type right
[1:07:32] okay praise the Lord he came so
[1:07:36] close it's just like menusa coming so
[1:07:40] close to live a thousand
[1:07:43] years Joseph came so close he was sold h
[1:07:48] h h he was hated by his brothers he was
[1:07:51] sold he was in prison he had two men one
[1:07:54] was delivered one was condemned he did
[1:07:57] he did everything right but just that
[1:07:59] one piece of a
[1:08:04] lie praise the
[1:08:07] Lord but in Christ God was able to find
[1:08:11] one
[1:08:12] man where the fullness could D
[1:08:16] it
[1:08:18] bodally the fullness of God dwell in
[1:08:21] Jesus Christ
[1:08:23] bodally now in having the preeminence
[1:08:27] which is the second for
[1:08:29] purpose he wanted to have a preeminence
[1:08:32] to have the preeminence by this in his
[1:08:35] church the church is going to be his
[1:08:37] body the bride praise the Lord amen yeah
[1:08:43] the body was one man yeah the body is
[1:08:46] going to be many members that's right
[1:08:50] praise the Lord but what he achieve up
[1:08:54] here by expressing himself he's going to
[1:08:57] achieve the same thing
[1:08:59] here by expressing himself amen the
[1:09:03] purpose is not the name of the church
[1:09:06] the purpose is not the amount of people
[1:09:10] the purpose is not I mean what we are
[1:09:12] doing the purpose of us Gathering here
[1:09:16] is God getting the people to express
[1:09:18] himself through
[1:09:19] them praise the lordu
[1:09:24] amen if we miss there we miss the mark
[1:09:27] right if we miss there we are just
[1:09:29] another denomination
[1:09:31] Church praise the lord we just only have
[1:09:34] the privilege to know about William
[1:09:36] Brandon but we are just a denomination
[1:09:38] until God can be able to get a people to
[1:09:42] achieve this now so you see here he was
[1:09:44] able to get one man to express himself
[1:09:48] completely that was his first PO for
[1:09:51] purpose the first purpose he did it
[1:09:53] through the old test men and uh H H
[1:09:57] types and Shadow in many ways and he was
[1:10:00] able to have a body and he he did that
[1:10:03] completely
[1:10:04] now that's the reason why I I I titled
[1:10:08] this
[1:10:11] containing praise the
[1:10:14] Lord I title it containing for the
[1:10:18] preeminence for Christ because it is our
[1:10:24] responsibility if we are containing for
[1:10:26] the faith we must be containing for
[1:10:29] Christ to have the preeminence
[1:10:33] amen that's what we must be fighting for
[1:10:36] now how much to prove we know the
[1:10:38] message or how much to prove we read the
[1:10:41] Bible or how long we've been serving
[1:10:43] Christ no we must be containing it's not
[1:10:46] going to be a one man over another is
[1:10:50] going to be a body
[1:10:54] Ministry
[1:10:56] praise the lord it's going to be a b the
[1:11:00] ministry and let me tell you something
[1:11:01] about the book of Jude said in the book
[1:11:04] of Jude a little bit I realized that
[1:11:09] Jude Jude under his inspiration of
[1:11:13] writing this book he's one of the person
[1:11:16] that spoke about the spirit of apostle
[1:11:21] say read the entire book of Jude you
[1:11:23] will see he he he speaks he address the
[1:11:27] spirit of
[1:11:30] apostasy he took the gloves
[1:11:33] off and I want to try to do the same
[1:11:36] this
[1:11:37] morning he took the gloves off he said
[1:11:40] there are set men Among
[1:11:45] Us Praise the Lord he said there are set
[1:11:49] man among
[1:11:54] us
[1:12:03] verse three beloved when when I gave all
[1:12:05] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:12:07] common salvation it was
[1:12:11] needful it was
[1:12:13] needful
[1:12:14] amen when I took my time to write unto
[1:12:18] you of this
[1:12:20] faith that is becoming common to us it
[1:12:24] was need for me to remind you for me to
[1:12:28] exalt you of your
[1:12:31] responsibility praise the Lord it was
[1:12:36] needful for me to write onto you and
[1:12:39] exalt you that yes should earnestly
[1:12:41] content for the fight which was once
[1:12:44] delivered to the sins for there are
[1:12:47] certain men creep in on
[1:12:50] aware praise the Lord amen so as Jude
[1:12:55] now let let me show you now some the the
[1:12:58] way he start he he's talking about these
[1:13:01] these
[1:13:02] Intruders these men that have intruded
[1:13:05] into the church in the book of Acts the
[1:13:08] Bible says there was a Mis multitude
[1:13:10] that's how the Bible called it that was
[1:13:12] in the early church praise the Lord now
[1:13:16] but see what he was says as he goes
[1:13:19] down he says verse five I will therefore
[1:13:23] put you in remembrance
[1:13:26] though you once knew this how that the
[1:13:29] Lord having saved the people out of the
[1:13:32] land of Egypt afterward destroy them
[1:13:36] that believe n what is he trying to do
[1:13:39] he's trying to say we have set men that
[1:13:41] creep in on thew Moses in his exodor has
[1:13:45] certain men that creep in on the way
[1:13:51] right are we together and those men
[1:13:55] under the exor of Moses that creeped in
[1:13:58] on a word all they were trying to do is
[1:14:00] destroy the confidence of the people in
[1:14:03] the
[1:14:04] leadership that God gave to lead the
[1:14:07] exodor right all they were doing
[1:14:10] reminding the people of the garc in uh
[1:14:13] uh uh uh in

[1:14:25] far he would go with this he never only
[1:14:27] stopped that he said the angels we kept
[1:14:31] not their first ested but left their
[1:14:33] habitation have and he went back even to
[1:14:37] the beginning before even time
[1:14:42] yeah praise the Lord Jude he's he's
[1:14:46] dealing with something here he's dealing
[1:14:48] with the spirit of

[1:15:46] Lord it won't be able to produce an
[1:15:48] overcoming life

[1:16:58] of those things we must also realize
[1:17:06] that we have an
[1:17:09] enemy praise the
[1:17:12] lord we have
[1:17:16] one that used to be among the
[1:17:20] angers praise the
[1:17:22] lord we have one that knows that knows
[1:17:25] about he knows about worship he knows
[1:17:28] all of that so he's he's bringing us to
[1:17:30] this place and and that's where I want
[1:17:32] to grab our attention uh uh this morning
[1:17:36] by the help of God praise the Lord by
[1:17:39] the help of god good to see you br good

[1:17:51] to look at this morning as as we look
[1:17:53] into that so we go back again to to our
[1:17:59] slide and that is the reason why we want
[1:18:02] to
[1:18:03] contain for the preeminence of Christ
[1:18:07] because that's that's our
[1:18:09] calling in this in this whole three four
[1:18:14] mystery this is our
[1:18:16] place we are the people that Christ will
[1:18:20] have the preeminence
[1:18:23] in amen
[1:18:25] we are the people that supposed to LIF
[1:18:28] up his
[1:18:30] name in the dying
[1:18:35] generation in an age that is that is
[1:18:37] growing into unbelief we are the people
[1:18:40] that's what we are called
[1:18:42] for that's what he called us
[1:18:47] for to give him the
[1:18:50] preeminence praise the Lord amen now you
[1:18:54] see
[1:18:55] and uh uh uh uh second to have the
[1:18:58] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:19:01] is his body the bride till he could have
[1:19:04] the preeminence to express himself
[1:19:07] through them and then the third one to
[1:19:11] restore the
[1:19:13] kingdom to his right position that fell
[1:19:17] by sin by the first Adam back to where
[1:19:21] he walked in the Cod of the evening
[1:19:25] and we've been talking about
[1:19:28] walking in health praise the
[1:19:31] Lord walking in health so it it restore
[1:19:35] us back back to edting that's the
[1:19:37] three-fold
[1:19:40] purpose now so as as we look at this
[1:19:44] together like I said I want to be just
[1:19:47] like Jude he took off the glove I mean
[1:19:50] he was he was hitting the spirits with
[1:19:52] his bad hands and that's what I want to
[1:19:54] do this morning hallelujah praise the
[1:19:57] Lorden amen and and and and the reason
[1:20:01] why I want to do it the reason why I
[1:20:03] want to do it is because we are fighting
[1:20:07] the Same
[1:20:11] Spirit praise the lord we have these
[1:20:14] same spirits that have
[1:20:16] intruded
[1:20:20] into the last day is
[1:20:22] faith we have this seen spirits that are
[1:20:25] intruding into our
[1:20:30] homes praise the Lord
[1:20:33] amen the enemy is doing everything he's
[1:20:35] trying to
[1:20:40] do it's going to be a constant fight
[1:20:42] until we get out of here so we we have
[1:20:46] to be we have to
[1:20:49] be we have to be waking to death
[1:20:53] amen we we have to be waken to
[1:20:57] death let's take uh uh let's take this
[1:21:00] one and then uh we
[1:21:05] go who is
[1:21:08] this
[1:21:10] mesc
[1:21:12] metic the Bible said 1 Timothy 3:16
[1:21:16] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:21:19] of
[1:21:20] godliness for God was manifested in
[1:21:25] flesh he was manifested in flesh handled
[1:21:29] with hands that's what John said in
[1:21:31] first John we handle him the word from
[1:21:34] the beginning we handle him for God was
[1:21:38] manifested in flesh that's why Paul said
[1:21:41] almighty God the invisible God what does
[1:21:44] that what does that spell to us it
[1:21:46] brings us back to the first purpose God
[1:21:51] getting a flesh God getting a man God
[1:21:54] expressing himself in man amen God was
[1:21:58] manifested in flesh handle with
[1:22:01] hands God eat meat God drank water God
[1:22:06] slept God cried at the grave of Lazarus
[1:22:10] praise the Lord amen but yet as soon as
[1:22:15] he WEP his eyes he said Lazar comes
[1:22:21] forth praise the
[1:22:23] Lord
[1:22:26] he was the
[1:22:27] one he was one of us a beautiful type in
[1:22:32] the Bible there was God above us God
[1:22:35] With Us Now is God in us having the
[1:22:42] preeminence is God in us prise God the
[1:22:46] Holy Spirit not not a tear person not a
[1:22:50] tear person the same person amen
[1:22:54] praise the Lord amen but now see yeah
[1:22:58] this is this is where my cat is on this
[1:23:01] God came down and became flesh and died
[1:23:05] the death in Christ so that he can he
[1:23:10] could clean the
[1:23:12] church in order to get into it for
[1:23:20] Fellowship praise the Lord so the
[1:23:22] threefold purpose is right here right
[1:23:24] here he got a flesh he came down he paid
[1:23:27] the price to be able to redeem the
[1:23:29] people that he can get a preeminence
[1:23:32] take them back to Eden for
[1:23:39] Fellowship are we
[1:23:45] together he came down he he become flesh
[1:23:50] and died the death in Christ so that he
[1:23:53] could clean the church in order to get
[1:23:56] into it for Fellowship God love
[1:24:01] Fellowship that's what he made the man
[1:24:03] at the first time for was for
[1:24:08] Fellowship praise the Lord amen
[1:24:18] amen so as we as we look at that we
[1:24:23] realize that
[1:24:28] Jude is calling us to a
[1:24:30] place of
[1:24:34] uh
[1:24:37] accountability praise the
[1:24:41] lord we have that responsibility that
[1:24:45] has been given to
[1:24:47] us and in contending for the
[1:24:50] faith we can do it in a selfish way
[1:24:53] because is a body
[1:24:56] Ministry praise the
[1:24:59] Lord if you think that you're doing so
[1:25:02] well looking at yourself looking after
[1:25:05] yourself and you know get your devotion
[1:25:08] together your walk with God and your
[1:25:09] walk with God and your walk with God and
[1:25:13] you are not watching over the others you
[1:25:17] are not going
[1:25:20] anywhere praise the Lord you are not
[1:25:23] going anywhere
[1:25:28] the last one man scripture in the Bible
[1:25:30] to be fulfilled is the one that is
[1:25:33] laying for Moses in
[1:25:36] Elijah Revelation 11 to
[1:25:40] Israel every other promise that is in
[1:25:43] the scripture to be fulfilled for the
[1:25:45] church is a body
[1:25:50] Ministry we shall be changed in the
[1:25:53] twinkling of an eye it's we it's not I
[1:25:56] shall be changed it's we shall be
[1:26:00] changed it's a body
[1:26:03] promise are we
[1:26:07] together it's a body the promise so we
[1:26:11] we we see that and I think that's what
[1:26:14] Jude is is is bringing us to he's trying
[1:26:17] to help us you know that's why we are
[1:26:19] called to contain for this Faith contain
[1:26:23] for for the preeminence of Christ in his
[1:26:28] church we must contend for that we must
[1:26:31] do everything now so you will realize as
[1:26:35] as I said uh we will We Will by the help
[1:26:38] of our group back there we will go we
[1:26:41] will go back and forth
[1:26:46] now so Wednesday night when when we were
[1:26:49] looking into into uh trying to finish
[1:26:52] our beginning series
[1:26:55] John identified a character he's talking
[1:26:58] to this beloved Brothers there in the
[1:27:00] church that have had a good testimony
[1:27:03] but he did not fail to
[1:27:06] recognize that in the infanty of the
[1:27:09] church that there was something that was
[1:27:11] going on that was not
[1:27:13] right he addressed the position of this
[1:27:17] uh other brother that was in a church uh
[1:27:20] uh di tropis people call him deot trophy
[1:27:23] Di trophies and he over there in t John
[1:27:27] now so and and and and John speaks of
[1:27:31] him and and says uh he's one of the ones
[1:27:34] that have uh the Bible says he loved to
[1:27:37] have the preeminence and morning among
[1:27:40] the Believers and even John said he
[1:27:43] would not even receive us he put himself
[1:27:47] to such a place I don't know what what
[1:27:49] Authority he had uh uh there there's not
[1:27:52] much I've been all through the week I've
[1:27:53] been trying to look for a little bit uh
[1:27:56] in history about him but uh uh it looks
[1:27:59] like he was he was an a Very influence
[1:28:02] man a man with lot of influence and the
[1:28:04] scripture says he will even you know uh
[1:28:07] uh uh not one he will even stop the
[1:28:10] Believers now I will have spent lot of
[1:28:12] time which of course I tried to gather
[1:28:15] seven different characteristics that I
[1:28:18] saw in in in the comment that John make
[1:28:21] here I'm not going to go into that this
[1:28:23] morning but but that is that is what is
[1:28:25] bringing us to this place uh
[1:28:30] because actually there's three times
[1:28:32] that the Bible will mention that were
[1:28:35] preeminent Solomon use it one in
[1:28:37] Ecclesiastes Paul use it where we read
[1:28:40] it uh uh this morning in the book of
[1:28:42] cusan and yeah John is using it the
[1:28:45] three times that the Bible will actually
[1:28:46] use that
[1:28:48] word and uh
[1:28:52] uh in the first time that Solomon used
[1:28:56] it he shows that man the way that man is
[1:28:59] made God made him to have preeminence
[1:29:02] over the
[1:29:03] Beast over the animals praise the
[1:29:07] Lord when Paul uses it Paul shows that
[1:29:10] Christ must have preeminence over
[1:29:14] man when John uses it John shows that
[1:29:18] there is one am more
[1:29:20] man that is not allowing Christ to have
[1:29:23] the preeminence in him him but he's
[1:29:25] asserting their preeminence over his
[1:29:27] brothers it bring us over to the mystery
[1:29:30] of iniquity that Paul talks about in The
[1:29:32] Book of
[1:29:34] tesalon Praise the Lord the man of sin
[1:29:37] he will exalt himself above
[1:29:40] everything we know that's that's a
[1:29:42] prophecy that is waiting for a
[1:29:45] fulfillment the time of the of of the
[1:29:47] Antichrist you know in but here Paul I
[1:29:50] mean John is identifying one in the
[1:29:54] local
[1:29:58] church praise the
[1:30:00] Lord amen so we want to spend a little
[1:30:03] time on there this morning by the help
[1:30:05] of God but before we do that we we also
[1:30:07] want to continue to encourage you and so

[1:34:44] this

[1:35:00] down at you and
[1:35:03] myself praise the Lord amen amen we are
[1:35:08] all looking at you know uh uh uh uh uh
[1:35:12] uh uh in in in the Dark
[1:35:14] Ages uh like we said on Wednesday night
[1:35:17] those people they were under the
[1:35:19] anointing of an
[1:35:22] ox God put a sacrificial anointing on
[1:35:27] them they could they could they
[1:35:30] could they could stand no matter how how
[1:35:33] much they were threatening they were
[1:35:35] hearing the rolling of
[1:35:38] lions out
[1:35:41] there and they were told deny Christ or
[1:35:45] else will feed you to the
[1:35:48] lion praise the
[1:35:51] Lord they never had
[1:35:54] more knowledge of the word than you have
[1:35:58] praise the lord it's just it was the
[1:36:01] anointing that was on them for that
[1:36:04] time both small young and
[1:36:10] old they stood for the name of Christ
[1:36:14] and they were fear to the Lions praise
[1:36:16] the
[1:36:17] Lord in the Old Testament Daniel was put
[1:36:20] in the lion den and the Lord shot the
[1:36:23] lion's mouth Yes amen praise the Lord
[1:36:27] now if your faith if your faith the
[1:36:31] faith in your mind is that God shut the
[1:36:34] lion's mouth God is going to shut this
[1:36:36] lion's mouth then you don't you really
[1:36:38] don't have a
[1:36:40] Faith No you don't have a faith because
[1:36:44] h h h h shedra Mish and Faith was
[1:36:48] not that God will shut the line your
[1:36:50] mouth or Daniel Faith was not that God
[1:36:52] will shut theine his mouth he didn't
[1:36:55] know what would happen
[1:36:57] right just like with the fire furnace
[1:37:00] those boys didn't know what will happen
[1:37:02] they said even if God do not deliver us
[1:37:06] we will not deny
[1:37:10] him so you not you you are not wanting
[1:37:13] to do it because you know God will
[1:37:14] deliver you why if God don't show
[1:37:20] up are you just going to trash
[1:37:22] everything
[1:37:28] no are we
[1:37:35] together you love the
[1:37:39] Lord and I realized
[1:37:43] that we might not be
[1:37:45] having uh a Roman sackers with with with
[1:37:49] lions and all of that but we have more
[1:37:52] than that
[1:37:55] right praise the Lord because in in in
[1:37:59] in in in in in that age there was one
[1:38:03] place that would go either Target Center
[1:38:05] everybody goes there but
[1:38:08] now our own Alliance are

[1:38:22] amen
[1:38:26] stay with the
[1:38:27] word stay right with the word live clean
[1:38:31] P have nothing to do with the things of
[1:38:34] the word praise the Lord amen stand for
[1:38:37] Christ the best you know
[1:38:40] how With all
[1:38:42] sincerity
[1:38:44] amen tell him your
[1:38:46] weaknesses tell him your areas of
[1:38:50] struggle praise the
[1:38:52] Lord
[1:38:54] because he knows and you
[1:38:58] know are we
[1:39:01] together let's take this other one
[1:39:04] before we we uh really move the gloves
[1:39:07] off our hands this
[1:39:09] morning now remember God is looking to
[1:39:12] me to see that I stay with the
[1:39:17] word and I'm looking to you to see that
[1:39:21] you carry out the word
[1:39:24] in this
[1:39:25] church praise the Lord amen a form of uh
[1:39:31] holding ourself accountable one to
[1:39:38] another you will realize as we as we
[1:39:40] will look into the few verses that we
[1:39:43] have to look into this morning as we as
[1:39:45] we dive into the subject like I've said
[1:39:48] to you before i' I've uh you know I've
[1:39:51] laid there before you uh in in in the
[1:39:54] form of a challenge and you you read the
[1:39:57] book of Acts you will realize that the
[1:40:00] word l o v e is not spelled in the book
[1:40:04] of
[1:40:05] AR
[1:40:07] wow even though love is
[1:40:10] impli the Bible say they brought their
[1:40:13] gifts and lay at the Apostle
[1:40:15] feet amen they took care of the widows
[1:40:18] they took care of the homeless that but
[1:40:20] the word love is not
[1:40:23] spell in the book of
[1:40:28] AR it's why the reason in the way that I
[1:40:32] see it is
[1:40:34] because the early Christian love was not
[1:40:38] just a language love was something that
[1:40:42] was possessing their
[1:40:44] body praise the Lord they were not going
[1:40:48] about and saying well you know let's
[1:40:50] just love everybody I mean let's let's
[1:40:52] love let's just love and because in the
[1:40:55] way that the present Society now is
[1:40:59] expressing and emphasizing love is is
[1:41:02] that let's just let's leave people TOS
[1:41:05] let's just condone anything any matter
[1:41:07] anything you want to do do
[1:41:09] it
[1:41:11] amen praise the Lord but that was not
[1:41:14] how the early Christians saw
[1:41:17] it they came they came to an
[1:41:20] understanding why will make those
[1:41:23] men leave their wives and children and
[1:41:27] and and and go down there and and and
[1:41:29] and and those sahed councel we tied them
[1:41:33] to the post we whip them when they were
[1:41:36] told uh H uh uh uh uh I mean and in
[1:41:40] whose name you heal this man you know go
[1:41:42] go and and and testify to the people and
[1:41:45] there's nothing about this Jesus and it
[1:41:47] says are we going to listen to you or
[1:41:49] are we going to listen to
[1:41:52] God they would get weped on their back
[1:41:55] these were older men they were not they
[1:41:57] were not young guys like uh like you and
[1:42:00] myself they were elderly guys they would
[1:42:03] get weped and the Bible says they will
[1:42:06] come out of that Hall
[1:42:10] rejoicing praise the
[1:42:12] Lord why because just couple of days or
[1:42:17] months ago the witness imp Palace hard
[1:42:20] and innocent manuh amen
[1:42:26] how his beard was pulled
[1:42:30] out and they understood by the holy
[1:42:33] ghost that according to the scripture he
[1:42:36] was bruised for our
[1:42:39] iniquity praise the Lord the chasy of
[1:42:42] our peace was upon him and wav the strip
[1:42:45] on his
[1:42:46] back we can benefit Divine Healing we
[1:42:51] can benefit every form of healing
[1:42:56] yes are we together now that is the
[1:42:59] reason why they were rejoicing they
[1:43:02] wanted to be
[1:43:04] partakers they felt that it was a
[1:43:08] privilege now so you think about it now
[1:43:10] with everything that they have gone
[1:43:12] through these guys were believing that
[1:43:14] Jesus he he he was the man we were
[1:43:17] waiting for we will kick out this room
[1:43:19] and and it did not
[1:43:22] happen praise the Lord and here is the
[1:43:25] Holy Ghost year and the church has begin
[1:43:28] right there I mean 3,000 gave their
[1:43:31] their hearts to the Lord can you imagine
[1:43:33] what a baptism service it was that
[1:43:37] day praise the
[1:43:39] Lord I mean I'm not sure if Peter was
[1:43:43] the only one that did the baptism 3,000
[1:43:45] men is seem there
[1:43:48] but in as much as a Rejoice the heart
[1:43:54] that men were coming to the knowledge of
[1:43:56] Jesus Christ their savior the apostles
[1:43:59] also had their eyes
[1:44:04] open they also have their eyes
[1:44:10] open and you will realize that it is not
[1:44:13] only Jew that use this language a
[1:44:17] setting set men creep in on the word you
[1:44:20] find that it's all over in the book of
[1:44:22] Acts Acts chapter 5 the Bible says set
[1:44:25] man in his wife ananas and Safar the
[1:44:29] Bible call him set men Acts chapter 15
[1:44:32] The Bible also say certain men were
[1:44:36] putting more burden on on the
[1:44:43] disciples are we together
[1:44:47] amen now so the early Christian knew
[1:44:50] thatth you know H H this thing was given
[1:44:53] to
[1:44:54] them they have this
[1:44:57] responsibility to bring Christ to the
[1:45:03] people to bring Christ to the
[1:45:09] nation the Bible says Simon came in one
[1:45:12] Simon he came in and in h h uh you
[1:45:16] know uh I mean he he was the champion of
[1:45:20] the city he were lying to people with
[1:45:22] all his magic tricks tricks praise the
[1:45:26] Lord when he saw the
[1:45:29] disciple praying for people and people
[1:45:32] testifying that they are
[1:45:33] healed he wanted to know how can I get
[1:45:36] that
[1:45:37] power now you see he did not join the
[1:45:41] church because he wanted to be
[1:45:44] safe yeah right he didn't say I believe
[1:45:47] Jesus Christ as my lord and savior he
[1:45:50] wanted to know how can I get that power
[1:45:53] right right to be able to pray for the
[1:45:56] sick so when these guys go I can blow up
[1:46:00] this city
[1:46:03] right praise the

[2:03:55] marriage 40 year of marriage God has
[2:03:58] raised up a

[2:04:11] to be able to fight for their home fight
[2:04:13] for their marriage fight for their
[2:04:15] children that's what the standard is
[2:04:18] that's what the message of the hour
[2:04:20] is
[2:04:22] that's what I know it
[2:04:29] is praise the Lord message of the hour
[2:04:32] is not to make every one of us Americans
[2:04:34] or every one of us Africans or you know
[2:04:37] bring a set culture and just stick
[2:04:39] everybody head in it to to to turn uh uh
[2:04:42] uh you know uh uh uh a tribal we of
[2:04:45] doing things right no it's Christ having
[2:04:49] the
[2:04:50] preeminence amen the people that he have
[2:04:53] called from different walks of life the
[2:04:57] beauty there is that he give us the
[2:04:59] grace for us to be able to encourage one
[2:05:02] another for us to be able to support one
[2:05:04] another for us to be able to bear with
[2:05:07] one
[2:05:08] another praise the
[2:05:10] Lord even sometimes it's hard to
[2:05:16] Bear but when we get to brotherly
[2:05:18] kindness we bear with one
[2:05:20] another
[2:05:22] that that that virtue of Brotherly
[2:05:24] kindness what it is is that you you you
[2:05:28] start to believe God if God can bring
[2:05:30] you to a life of discipline you can
[2:05:33] believe that God is able to bring the
[2:05:35] nest man to that that's what brotherly
[2:05:37] kindness
[2:05:38] is
[2:05:40] yeah it's not you acting as a champion
[2:05:43] over the Believers no there is no
[2:05:46] Champion we have one Champion that Jesus
[2:05:48] Christ
[2:05:50] amen

[2:06:06] have not done anything
[2:06:09] yet and we are here to hold up a
[2:06:12] standard in this evening evening time
[2:06:14] evening light time that's when the word
[2:06:17] is Ding and the whole church kingdom is
[2:06:19] going to the Council of churches
[2:06:22] praise the
[2:06:24] Lord and sometimes that's what astonish
[2:06:27] people because we get so used to the way
[2:06:29] everybody is doing it and they think
[2:06:32] that that's the way it's supposed to be
[2:06:33] no let's go back to the
[2:06:36] word praise the Lord let's go back to
[2:06:39] the
[2:06:40] word now so we we are called to to
[2:06:45] contend for the faith or contain uh uh
[2:06:49] uh this thing is not mov
[2:06:58] okay content for the preeminence of
[2:07:00] Christ now so this is what I want for us
[2:07:03] to look at look just look at these few
[2:07:05] few verses with me and uh uh uh
[2:07:11] uh Little Grace if you will help us back
[2:07:14] there as as as uh as Jude talks about
[2:07:19] this like I said you go over to the book
[2:07:22] of Acts you see you'll see a setting of
[2:07:25] them Acts chapter 5 Paul talks about a
[2:07:28] set man ananas and and and his wife you
[2:07:33] think about that think about that if if
[2:07:36] if both their husband and wife were
[2:07:39] holding one another accountable to the
[2:07:42] word we will not have that story
[2:07:46] right praise the Lord you can see a
[2:07:50] disconnection between that family and
[2:07:53] what was happening in that
[2:07:55] church praise the Lord you can see a
[2:08:00] disconnection if uh if if a kind and his
[2:08:03] family if the wife and the children were
[2:08:06] holding their father accountable to the
[2:08:12] word and says you remember Moses says we
[2:08:15] we should not take anything from that
[2:08:18] place praise the Lord the whole family
[2:08:23] wouldn't have been
[2:08:26] burned praise the Lord but but but
[2:08:30] sometimes we think is is love we think
[2:08:33] is is our expression of
[2:08:37] love we love our children we love our
[2:08:40] wife we love our husband that sometimes
[2:08:42] when when when when the wrong is there
[2:08:44] we don't cry out we don't call for
[2:08:49] help praise the Lord we love our pastor
[2:08:53] that when we see the wrong we don't we
[2:08:54] don't call for
[2:08:58] help but if you look in you look in the
[2:09:01] church you look in the early church you
[2:09:03] will
[2:09:08] realize to be able to have Christ having
[2:09:12] the preeminence in his
[2:09:15] church we must be able to hold one
[2:09:17] another accountable to the
[2:09:19] word praise the Lord

[2:10:41] verse
[2:10:46] 17 Romans
[2:10:50] 16
[2:10:52] praise the Lord
[2:10:55] amen Paul who speaks here you go back
[2:10:59] just go back and listen to some of the
[2:11:01] things that he said before he comes to
[2:11:02] this verse he said now I beset you
[2:11:04] Brethren mark them which cause
[2:11:07] Division and offenses contrary to the
[2:11:10] doctrine which ye have learned and Evo
[2:11:14] them they were not seeking to make their
[2:11:17] Church big they were seeking to find a
[2:11:20] church where Christ is alive amen where
[2:11:23] the word is coming
[2:11:35] alive are we together look at the
[2:11:38] Council of uh of of of of of the of of
[2:11:42] the LA Church why did they came together
[2:11:44] Acts chapter
[2:11:47] 15 verse one the Bible says and certain
[2:11:50] men came came down from from from Juda
[2:11:53] taught the Brethren and said except you
[2:11:56] be circumcised after the manner of Moses
[2:11:58] so there was certain men that creep in
[2:12:01] what they were trying to do they were
[2:12:02] trying to force the church to
[2:12:07] Judaism even the Gentile Believers that
[2:12:10] have given their heart to Christ they
[2:12:12] were forcing every one of them to
[2:12:18] Judaism so when the when the when they
[2:12:21] Church realized that what they did they
[2:12:23] brought men together said Peter come and
[2:12:26] tell these brothers what happened in the
[2:12:27] house of
[2:12:28] colinus it was not a Jewish church it
[2:12:31] was a gentile
[2:12:34] church and Peter realized that the
[2:12:36] Gentile received the Holy Ghost much
[2:12:39] easier than the Jews the Jews had to
[2:12:42] stay 10 days with him the the Gentile
[2:12:45] just need one service while the word was
[2:12:48] preached
[2:12:50] yes
[2:12:51] and if you read you read Acts chapter 15
[2:12:53] Peter says he he said it in this way I
[2:12:57] would have preferred that we receive the
[2:12:58] Holy Ghost the way the Gentile receive
[2:13:00] it that's
[2:13:10] right they were not seeing things and
[2:13:12] just and just going home and just
[2:13:14] talking about it they just sit down in
[2:13:16] their family and just talk and just
[2:13:18] bring this person down and bring this
[2:13:20] other person down and bring this other
[2:13:22] person let me tell you something there's
[2:13:24] a difference when you are talking about
[2:13:26] a concern let me show you where the
[2:13:28] difference is the difference when you
[2:13:30] are really concerned and you talking to
[2:13:33] another brother or you're talking to
[2:13:34] another sister about brother one if you
[2:13:38] are really concerned you will end that
[2:13:40] conversation and say let's pray yes
[2:13:45] amen it's a conversation of concern
[2:13:48] because whenever we pray we bring those
[2:13:50] things under the
[2:13:53] blood praise the
[2:13:55] Lord but when we just we just we just uh
[2:13:59] uh uh increase one another blood
[2:14:04] pressure oh yeah I might say I was
[2:14:06] seeing I say I can see some things I
[2:14:08] just don't want to talk I can see
[2:14:14] y you just increasing your blood
[2:14:16] pressure that's right amen

[2:19:43] here musicians you can find your way up
[2:19:46] but beloved Remember The Words which
[2:19:50] were spoken
[2:19:51] before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus
[2:19:54] Christ how that they told you there
[2:19:57] should be markers in the last time who
[2:20:00] should walk after their own ungodly lust
[2:20:05] this be they who separate themselves
[2:20:08] sensuously having not the spirit but yet
[2:20:12] beloved build up
[2:20:16] yourself on your Most Holy Faith praying
[2:20:19] in the Holy Ghost
[2:20:21] keeping yourself in the love of God
[2:20:25] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[2:20:28] Christ onto eternal
[2:20:34] life and of
[2:20:36] some have
[2:20:40] compassion making a
[2:20:43] difference and some have compassion
[2:20:45] making the
[2:20:46] difference and others saved with fear
[2:20:49] pulling them
[2:20:51] out of the
[2:20:54] fire sometimes we must preach like we
[2:20:57] are
[2:21:00] angry some have compassion some pull
[2:21:03] them
[2:21:06] out says what are you doing what are you
[2:21:09] doing brother bam says like saying John
[2:21:12] get out the
[2:21:13] road get out of
[2:21:19] there
[2:21:21] other save with fear pulling them out of
[2:21:23] the
[2:21:24] fire hting even the Garment spotted by
[2:21:27] the
[2:21:28] flesh now unto him that is able to keep
[2:21:31] you from
[2:21:32] falling and to present you faultless
[2:21:35] before the presence of his glory with
[2:21:38] exceeding
[2:21:41] Joy to the only wise God our savior be
[2:21:45] glory and the Majesty Dominion power
[2:21:47] both now and ever
[2:21:55] amen you see what we are called
[2:22:03] to is his body the church is his
[2:22:07] body he's the one that paid the price
[2:22:09] for
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:17] it such a responsibility that we we have
[2:22:20] to one
[2:22:23] another such a responsibility that we
[2:22:26] have to one
[2:22:28] [Music]
[2:22:32] another and if that reality can sink in
[2:22:37] you will have no reason taking an
[2:22:40] offense because maybe your brother said
[2:22:43] this to you or the sister says well you
[2:22:45] know this to you you take it in a good
[2:22:48] spirit and if the person is is really
[2:22:50] you wrong you can also tell them no
[2:22:53] that's that's not what I was
[2:22:54] doing then the person also will take it
[2:22:57] out of good
[2:23:00] Fai you see but when when we when we get
[2:23:03] to the place where we are all on the
[2:23:05] edge I have to be careful what what I
[2:23:07] tell this brother I have to be careful
[2:23:09] because you know people they quick to
[2:23:10] misunderstand people
[2:23:13] people yeah how we how are we getting
[2:23:16] ready for the
[2:23:19] rapture when we are running an an
[2:23:21] individual
[2:23:23] race you see it it it was going to be so
[2:23:27] easy that as soon as you get ready God
[2:23:29] just pick you up you go in the Rapture
[2:23:31] and this other person go tomorrow and
[2:23:33] the other person go tomorrow but God
[2:23:35] designed it because he's having a
[2:23:37] preeminence in the B and the B is his
[2:23:40] church the B is his
[2:23:42] bride because of that he's not going to
[2:23:46] take one person before another
[2:23:48] person there will without us are not
[2:23:53] complete the Old Testament Saints need
[2:23:56] us or the New Testament Church the
[2:23:59] Ephesian church that's the beginning of
[2:24:01] the Bride body they need us we need to
[2:24:05] come to that
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:08] place then they will come out of the
[2:24:10] grave and we all will go
[2:24:12] together there is no first trip in a
[2:24:15] Rapture and last
[2:24:17] trip if you are just playing Church
[2:24:20] because you want to go on the last trip
[2:24:21] there is no last trip we all going
[2:24:24] together if you miss the first one you
[2:24:26] miss
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:31] it that's the responsibility that is
[2:24:34] what we are called to that is the way
[2:24:36] that Christ will have his preeminence in
[2:24:39] his
[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:46] body I always say this people say
[2:24:49] salvation is an individual Affair you
[2:24:52] are not the
[2:24:54] individual it's not your Affair
[2:24:57] salvation is his affair he is the
[2:25:00] individual with the church we are AB
[2:25:04] body it's his affair he's the one that
[2:25:07] pay the price he's the one that call you
[2:25:10] he's the one that justify you he's the

[2:37:34] Lord you know we've been we've been

[2:37:42] that we can close it up uh and then uh
[2:37:46] just trust and see but you know the one
[2:37:48] of the thing that bless my heart when I
[2:37:50] was studying on this and and trying to
[2:37:53] see how to narrow it down for our local
[2:37:56] assembly is just to see the many healing
[2:38:00] process that we have come through as a
[2:38:04] church praise the Lord to see where the
[2:38:07] Lord has took us from and where we are
[2:38:10] and to believe that he that has brought
[2:38:12] us the son of righteousness with healing
[2:38:15] in his ways praise the Lord he's able to
[2:38:19] make this church a glorious Church
[2:38:22] praise the Lord amen we having all of
[2:38:25] these little ones that we dedicated to
[2:38:28] the
[2:38:29] Lord if Jesus should T it there will be
[2:38:32] a generation of children that were born
[2:38:34] right in this building yeah that were
[2:38:36] dedicated to the Lord and they got
[2:38:39] married and they are raising their
[2:38:41] family that's what a church
[2:38:43] is it's a
[2:38:46] kingdom the kingdom of God Has Come to
[2:38:51] us where we can attach our values to the
[2:38:55] word that's how the kingdom is
[2:38:57] [Music]
[2:39:01] built that's why we fight for what is
[2:39:04] right and fight against what is
[2:39:07] wrong because it's not just for
[2:39:11] today it's not just for
[2:39:13] today you might get a job
[2:39:17] somewhere or get married and then move
[2:39:20] to another place the church remains yeah
[2:39:24] those doors are
[2:39:26] open they are people that going to walk
[2:39:28] in they don't have no idea what we
[2:39:30] believe they comes in they enjoy the
[2:39:32] song they enjoy the preaching the next
[2:39:35] Sunday they comes back the next Sunday
[2:39:37] they comes back they want to know what
[2:39:39] this is all
[2:39:40] about so it is not just the
[2:39:44] mov it's not just the
[2:39:46] moment every family have tsle even your
[2:39:49] tongue and teeth in the mouth they fight
[2:39:52] sometimes right you don't cut your
[2:39:54] tongue out and throw it away because you
[2:39:55] bite
[2:39:56] [Music]
[2:40:04] it every time you come to church on a
[2:40:07] Sunday morning or you come to church on
[2:40:09] a Wednesday night you are sewing a seed
