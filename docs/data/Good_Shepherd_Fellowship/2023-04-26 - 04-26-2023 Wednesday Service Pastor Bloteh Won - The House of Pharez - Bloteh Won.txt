chapter 15. praise the Lord we took this last Wednesday and so we want to get back this in Luke chapter 15 let's just do a quick reading year Hallelujah well we were out this this video uh I was going to send out so we can it's a kind of a testimony video there was a sister that sister Nessie brought her prayer requests and this sister was experiencing uh what we will we were classified as uh as a kind of a spiritual demonic attack I mean someone very well and uh she's running a little uh chemist like a drosto where she said medication for some reason she went paralyzed she couldn't use her legs and then she was experiencing severe pain that would just run down her legs and and I think having one of the video there where she was crying on the phone and uh a couple of days ago uh the Lord kind of bless her with healing and she's on her legs and and she said send me the video of her trying to jump and you know Dance all over the place praise the Lord so we thank the Lord for very men we thank the Lord for blessing our sister with healing that's the god that we serve amen he's a mighty God he's a marigold praise the Lord let's read uh Luke chapter 15 verse 17 to 9. Luke chapter 15 verse 17. the Bible says here and then I will continue reading and when he came to himself praise the Lord that's the prodigal son when he came to himself let's buy our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just want to thank you precious Lord father sister Joy uh sending her her prayer requests uh being a little bit under the weather we we asked the Lord father you will bless her I believe this is to Joy Langer and no God may you just bless her with healing to father thank you Lord God for touching Sister Evelyn and oh Father we we Rejoice with her we are glad to see you moving on the scene and raising your daughter out of her actress father Lord God and again we remember your seventh brother Sammy Johnson and his wife and also we remember brother Bill Young's the lawyer will set his heartbeat right father we just love you tonight come and speak to us out of your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat verse 17 and when he came to himself he said how many higher seven my father have have bread enough and to spare and I perish with hunger praise the Lord how many higher seven my father have and he have enough bread and more to spare and yeah I perish with hunger now let's go to verse 31. praise the Lord this is the older son the father is speaking to and he said unto him son they are ever with me praise the Lord and all that I have is dying praise the Lord so uh what what we what we try to bring out of this year is the other uh we're trying to look at uh identity crisis amen the younger one came to himself the older one came to know that all the father have was his praise the Lord if you go back in the reading you will see here that uh the older one said uh he got angry and he answered and said verse 29 and he and and he answered and said to his father Lo these many years do I serve thee praise the Lord so he was he was uh pointing to how faithful he was serving serving the father and yet he was also acknowledging that uh I've been serving you I've been a good boy I've been a good girl in church and yet uh you have not made a party for me and uh and here is this other one that has screwed up his life that you are making the party for so we we want to look at that uh uh tonight so the other one came to know that all the father have uh was his it is not how high we work praise the Lord it is not haha we work but what the father is looking for is the character of the word praise the Lord amen for this boy to be working very hard to please the father and yet have not come to that character of understanding that all of this belong to me that there was an era of concern also praise the Lord and then for the younger one to think that he had things under control and here he went and wasted the substance of the father now but in in lokia Luke chapter 15 there were three things that we look at Jesus talked about the lost sheep uh the Lost Queen and uh uh uh the the Lost inheritance if we would say that way he kind of for misplaced the inheritance it's beautiful because you know brother Branham saying when Adam lost his inheritance you know he says it went back in the hands of the original owner praise the Lord and when the when the Prodigal Son wasted and lost everything he acknowledged that what a half man you know my father have better than the state I'm in so it went back he looked back to the hands of the original owner which is the father but we were we were looking at this and there are a few uh coats of broadband I want to read I want to kind of uh back my thoughts up here with Coach because I couldn't do that uh last Wednesday so we were looking at this and we were just trying to look at uh out of the the the three Parables there that relate to uh uh our I was our stages of Grace and stages in the way the father deal with us we all uh were like sheep going straight amen we were all like sheep going astray so we find ourselves right in the parable of the lost sheep the father took a time he talked he took a special time praise the Lord that day that you were saying the day you came to the knowledge of of Christ of experiencing God's salvation Grace the father took a special time that service was only for you that moment was only for you the father you he will always take a special time every time that God will redeem his children like brother Branham said when he came down in the Garden of Eden he never sent an angel he came down himself he was the one that said Adam Adam where are you he never sent Michael he never said Gabriel he came down himself praise the Lord amen and I I have this uh uh uh personal thought in my mind that every martyr that is on Earth is giving one or more opportunity to experience God praise the Lord amen whether you know God or not there will be some kind of for even in our life word he comes very close praise the Lord and if we are conscious it's not by luck it was the hand the tender hand of Jehovah that brought you out of that situation it was the creator coming so close to his creature and delivering you praise the Lord so then we say we talk about the Lost Queen you will see a year that we will read out of uh the second coming of the Lord that's the message brother brand preach brother Brandon identified that as virtue he identified that that uh the the the the this woman lost a vet you so you see Jesus Took the thought in a kind of a progressive way he's talking to both for the publicans and and the Sinners and then he had this religious group here the stripes and the Pharisees and he stopped talking about which one of you that your sheep would get lost and you will not go after them praise the Lord and let me tell you today that that is the same thing that happened when one Soul comes to the kingdom of God Heaven Rejoice amen praise the Lord and then he goes after again and talk about a certain woman that lost a queen and Brother Band will make us to understand that uh it was uh it was a virtue so you see that uh uh he's he's bringing this teaching this is this is the way our Lord taught he uh he talked about Parables he bringing this teaching uh uh uh right from when a sinner is safe when the father has gone after you and then and then uh brought you to the saving knowledge it is not only for you to become a church member praise the Lord because by grace and by predestination the assertive virtue in you amen praise the Lord Hallelujah yeah accepting virtues in you that's why brother Brandon taught in uh a statue of a perfect man he says you just need the right environment but it's already in you praise the Lord amen so when Peter said ah to your faith you don't go and get Faith from spoken word Tabernacle and then you get veggie from Capstone Tabernacle no you don't you don't go shopping for it amen right glory be to God so we we want to look at Jesus taught here in a Progressive Way teaching about uh uh uh the way that he deals with us after saving us and and picking us up putting us on his shoulder and redeeming us to himself he he uh speak now about this woman now brother brand will take this let's follow that a little bit here and the second coming of the Lord he said man a certain value of that woman praise the Lord if you want to look look it up look in Galatians 5 you will find out that they are warmer represented the church and the church is an espouse wife to Christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in Gallatin five you're talking about the fruit of the spirit which is love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience that is the tablet that's supposed to be worn in the church Brotherly Love kindness Fellowship so brother Brown goes out there to complete it to make sure that it's all ten he says it must have been long about that now if you read the parable Jesus said that the woman after she lost she light a candle now Candlestick always represents the church ages praise the Lord it always represents the church ages but brother Branham will represent a year as nighttime he says it must have been long about that that she realized that she had lost one of those coins oh if this ever was a time that the church ought to take inventory to find out if you have got all the coins on it should be now praise the Lord amen can we say that together it should be now praise the Lord if there is ever the time that the church must take inventory to make sure we have all of those vets you brother Branham say it should be now it's getting dark praise the Lord is getting there again the very hot and clouds of destroying civilization is hanging over the Earth we see all of the things that are happening you know I was I was uh uh uh listening to this message today and then I was just I was just thinking about it you know I was thinking about it and there was some there were some very prophetic thing that brother Brandon said it just it just kind of for uh bad for my mind you check that message better Brandon was talking about how how uh uh the American politician he says that uh uh the the uh they are trading the blessing he says whoever bless Israel is blessed he said but see our country we are betraying their promise and now we are making friends with the Arabs I'm thinking about I says this is this is hundreds of years back now actually hundreds of years but a couple of years back and here is brought Branham saying that how you know uh uh uh uh a country that was founded on structural principle to know that keeping the friendship with Israel is blessing they are now turning against that and now making friends with the Arabs I was saying myself I said oh my God what is this he's talking about and it's happening right before our eyes amen amen praise the Lord they will come against you for standing for Christian value but yeah they would give the other ones the the rest chance to go and prayed and respect their holidays yes amen praise the Lord so we see all of these things uh uh a cloud of this destroying civilization hanging over the Earth the prophet of God says praise the Lord those values and courtesies are all gone what a day that we are living we are living in a tremendous time when there is wickedness people who goes to church people who goes to church just for Hashem amen praise the Lord he says people who goes to church just to try to hide from their meanings right so wish me the people are not getting to Christ the people are not getting to the revelation of Jesus Christ the church is just a place of comfort is it looks like it's a shelter well we just go and ease our mind a little bit praise the Lord when actually we must be we must be the uh uh uh reaching out to Christ we must be getting the hold of God praise the Lord amen and it's not just only the denomination Church message churches are becoming just a place of form as long as we can sing their songs from the songbook we can quote a a quote and said brother Branham said praise the Lord sure amen some message people become too nervous when you stand when you start getting into the word if you are not quoting their familiar quotes they get two Neighbors praise the lord we just want to hear the same thing all the time we don't want to go any further in the word we don't want these things to be real to us but we have Jesus on our hand praise the Lord the prophet of God says what a tremendous time when there is wickedness people will go to church now he's he's associating a certain form of wickedness you will be doing yourself too much evil to come to church and don't really get in the word that's wickedness you've been to you've been harmful to yourself praise the Lord to know that you will be dealing with things in your life ugly things right and then you come to church and just sit there comfortably when you're supposed to be hauling to the halls of the Altar and crying to God praise the Lord people will go to church just a shaming people who go to church to hide from the armeness people who go to church and profess Christianity and live like the rest of the word drinking smoking gambling wearing immoral clothes wearing clothes that they ought all into word in their own dressing room out in the street before public and Brotherly Love is a thing that is passing almost praise the Lord it is just on our lid God bless you brother brother have a feeling we're beginning to lost the brother Brandon go ahead here he says the church of God her purity called devotion amen examining ourselves by the word our puritate our loyalty our devotion to Christ for the word brother we the Church of the Living God in this great hour that we are now living a behold us to check up go before God like the candle of the word of the gospel and examine ourself and find out if we are not falling shot and especially when we see all these things coming we are the end time the coming of Christ is a hand there is not another hope in the word for the church that's the reason why we say is the rapture is our future right praise the Lord the Rapture is our future now so we see here that uh brother Branham is is what he what is he doing by talking about all of these things he's identifying that lost queen to a vet you that uh uh the church has lost if that's you brother random talk in uh uh uh invisible union he says uh just like the woman the church is giving three sacrificial Devotion to the word to to to to prayer amen and her Devotion to Christ are we together now so we see here then he says he he says this also uh in their same message he says when that time comes when the church fine is brotherly love amen when the church found its wholly decency praise the Lord when the church Finds Its place in Christ now three things he pull out to you and in my mind I'm sitting there there I says you can take those three things and put them right in sin Luke chapter 15. praise the Lord the three Parables that Jesus gives in sin Luke chapter 15 you can take those three things and place them right in Saint Luke chapter 15. praise the Lord when the church find his brother the love when the church fine is wholly decency glory be to God when the church find a place in Christ the prophet of God says it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us when we were having I was our special meetings that was what we were using for our team amen praise the Lord and uh uh so we see here that uh uh uh this these uh these virtues are are very important for us they are very very important there's a place we know that brother-in-law right there brotherly kindness you know uh uh the prophet of God says it will make us to bear with one another amen we will bear with one another on our knees we will we will esteem others better than ourselves like the Apostle Paul says we will learn to support one another instead of destroying one another amen we we will we will just be in that place you know our brother Brandon says they're in adoption message he says that was what Abraham does when he heard about love being taken away amen when Lord and the kings of Sodom was taken away he says that was what Abraham Abraham did just like the father glory after a lost sheep one move him to to do their brother the love amen he was able to step over the past well whatever argument he and Lord have whatever disrespect that he taught the law of disrespect him he was able to step over that instead go after a fallen brother praise the Lord but we have we we have a bunch of demand that person have to do there to make sure they got to do this until this thing is right and uh you see it's it's just completely gone and the prophet of God will talk about it and he says he says they're in adoption he says when Abraham did that when Abraham did that the father adopted him he experienced an adoption you know what brother bran said he says it is the place where God where the father will call uh uh the son aside and and and and and bring him before The Heirs or his friends and he says that was exactly what God did he called Abraham to communion right Manchester that came on the scene there was a form of adoption you read a message adoption he said it right there and then he goes right there and even talked about the Prodigal Son Batman says that's when God can visit a man with angels because what you are doing the father bidding yes sir what is the father building what is the father desire is to go after all of his children right praise the Lord going after lost sheep brother brotherly kindness and then yeah the prophet is also saying when the church found its wholly decency the kind of for decency that must it is not just in our style of dressing praise the Lord amen by our manner of life our conduct amen yeah right yep the way we talk to one another the way we talk at home do we create an atmosphere for for angels to visit our home praise the Lord holy decency and just to see the the the the the the the the kind of indecent things that have creeped on the Believers you know amen and a lot of the things that uh you know uh uh uh uh people are lying in their lives in India home in India mine right right when the church find is brotherly kindness and holy decency no no matter how you know uh uh pure that later was dressing if she did not find that coin she was not this decent before her husband right are we together and let me tell you you can practice it it must come by the birth amen and when the church find is placing Christ now that's the place where we get into the prodigal boys there when the church find its place in Christ it will call to the other members of the body come and rejoice with us God wants the church to love him right praise the Lord he want the church to love him so we were looking at these other at the position of these two boys yeah we said the younger one you know uh uh the scripture says when he came to himself so uh uh just like Paul says if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead word in you it will do what it will Quicken your mortal body right praise the Lord unless we are experience the quickening power we are still sleeping in our natural nature in our in our human self we are trusted trusting our natural ability we are leaning on to our own understanding praise the Lord the need to come and Awakening the need to come and Awakening and just like I said last week uh you know uh uh we we we we we preach the Prodigal Son as uh uh you know we we all were practical when we were born you know and we were going from the father by the sinful nature but uh I look at a complete different way praise the Lord amen because uh a year this uh uh the the Sun never became a song when he came back to the father he was first born in the father's house and then he left the father house praise the Lord he left the father house so we have to realize that even even after we have given our heart to the Lord we we are born again we have to realize that we need to come to the place of uh uh our our word the Holy Ghost is taking complete control of our life right because you can still be born again and then you are just controlled by a religious spirit amen you are just controlled by the religious spirit you just have a a kind of a religious zeal right we're in in your Zeal you can still be a a disregarding the word of God praise the Lord so you see the sun was already born in the house it's not it's not uh uh uh coming back that make him a son no he was already a son you have to realize that he lost the the gift he lost the inheritance that he had but he never lost his sonship right praise the Lord he never lost his sonship is that is that is that a position in his life as a song that gave him a craving for the father are we together so the younger son came to himself the other one like we said before he came to know that oh the father has was his and which of course uh uh uh uh that's that is that is that is another thing also and I would take few quotes here from brother Brandon now uh Church age and uh and and find a place to be able to wrap this tonight that will keep you long better man would talk here he says uh uh [Music] like I said Auto all the order one came to know that all the father has uh was his it is not her how how we work to get rich overnight it is the character of the word that the father is looking at right praise the Lord amen so the ability there was that was in that boy that the place of a son for the for the for the for the young man to realize that he has a father to go back to his father that was a character that's a place of repentance there's a place that make a child to say Lord I need you yes not not not trying to fix it in ourself but realizing that without him we are nothing amen that is a character no matter how how many times we fail if we would just realize how how many times we feel is just how mod we need God in our life so it is not uh it is not how how we work people of God let me let me just bring their home for us to realize that yeah it don't take God to use your career to bless you God don't need your diplomat right to bless you the prophet of God said it's a new ticket is not to snatch you out of school no go to school but you have to realize that blessing do not come from the east or the West it comes from the Lord there are people that are more smarter than you praise the Lord before you got that certificate there were many people that got it praise the Lord so you see what the father looked for to be able to trust you with a blessing is character praise the Lord is character the character of the word the character of putting God first yes that's what the father looks for for him to be able to bless you or bless us he looking for that character he's not looking for our muscles praise the Lord because sometimes if you want to be Earnest to yourself with all the hours you put in you are still broke if you have really make the money by this time you should be retired or running your own business right brother random says here he says why does he stand by he says the reason is in Romans 8 17 18 and if children then hear us if we are children they are all that the father have belong to us hear us of God he said John hears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him praise the Lord not plaguing ourself amen not plaguing ourself was believing that God has everything under control amen praise the Lord he says and and and and so that uh uh uh if so be that we suffer with him that we might that we may be also glorified together for Iraq on there the suffering of this present time I now wanted to be compared with the glory we shall be revealed praise the Lord as as much as we we read that and we enjoy it it have to be a revelation right praise the Lord I mean it has to be a revelation when you think about the people in the Dark Ages praise the Lord amen because that was that was their time you know how they saw it how I was sharing with her with her brother and I was I was reading uh uh I have one testimony thing that I was reading and this uh I think this was in Romania many years back and and there was a persecution on the church and and uh and this uh officer came in and you know and he was he was just saying all sorts of Blasphemous thing and and all of that and the lady said she said she said uh uh speaking to her husband she said won't you say something he said he says dear I don't I don't want you to to be a widow praise the Lord she looked at him and says I don't want a cow as a husband either if you were staying here and he would ridicule our Christ then I don't want you as a husband praise the Lord so you see it it became a revelation so some of those young sisters in the fact that that realized that they will not get married they will be burned to the stick it was a revelation to them right they never they never cry oh God what are you punishing me right some of them did they are wedding right before the Lion's Den got their first cake and the first case and they would throw into the lion's den let me tell you we have more than a lion's den praise the Lord laodisha has more than a lion's den because it's ravishing homes is Ravishing the lives of people that claimed to be sitting down under the word so don't don't think that I'm trying to make a scary story you already living in it the devil is like a rolling lion seeking for whom to divorce that's the reason why it must be a revelation Eternal Word Of Glory praise the Lord so the prophet go go ahead and say say unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him we have to suffer to Reign that's the reason this is something that is very familiar with us the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering and their suffering is now punishment they are suffering is discipline to a child of God is disciplined the father want us to be disciplined on our time discipline with our thoughts discipline with the things that he gave us praise the Lord sometimes we think they're okay I I work I I take up my time the rest that's my money praise the Lord that's not your money God just trusted to you you are just a steward praise the Lord you see that's why he can bless us because we we feel it grabbing to it that's my money my high earned money imma give my high-end money to you the kind of a character that we have behind it praise the Lord when you can actually when you can actually count your money and come to an end people that have wealth they don't they never come to an end they have bunch that they don't know it's just there amen but you can look at yourself you can count it 5 10 15 20. praise the Lord are we together so the prophet of God is saying here that's the reason that is far because character is never made without suffering discipline take suffering as discipline that the father want us to be disciplined right right that if God will trust you with something is it going to change your personality are you going to start enslaving other people because you have a little praise the Lord Joseph became a prime minister he never even went went to school maybe he did a little bit of of homeschooling before they saw him out he got to learn foreign language the father says all that I have is yours but here is him here he's in the house he's in a church and he thinks that he got a fast and pray Lord and you got to bless me Lord you got I mean all of those kind of for Pentecostal idea right prosperity ideas that we have in our mind I got a soul I'm I'm sowing seeds of blessing all you're doing you just do you are just doing your religious form of Lottery is you are playing Lotto I'm sowing since I'm giving ten dollars so God can give me hundred dollars when we are not disciplined we are not disciplined we are not disciplined young people we just want the money to get in our hands to get the next whether it's the next iPhone or next whatever we want to get sure and we just go on a shopping spree it is not how we work people that's not what the father is looking at father is looking at how disciplined how much are you considering his inheritance praise the Lord how much are you put into his inheritance if he leave it with you are you going to protect it can we stand like men in this church and say this is our church we will build this church we'll make sure that there will be no nothing will go wrong nothing I mean no foolishness will happen in this can we stand like brothers are we looking for the next opportunity to criticize praise the Lord are we just hoping that oh we we just wish that God would just sin or one rich man so he can build us a new church is that what we are looking at all we are saying this this is what I will raise my family praise the Lord you don't have to say it with your mouth go on your knees praise the Lord you will work hard to keep a good atmosphere in church you will know that your behavior affect the atmosphere in church he says character is a victory not a gift yeah and man with our character can Reign because power apart from character is satanic money with our character is devilish yeah praise the Lord if you don't have that character the power with character is fit to root that's what the father was looking for that's why he's looking for that character as a daughter of God you're not going to get in a blamed game with God when you understand that in one one in a million they're out of those million cells he choose you he watch over you he brought you to the knowledge to know him then you get in a blame game with God that is a character of the society that we are living in they blame their parents for everything they even blame their parents from for burning them praise the Lord when when a Son of God or the daughter of God get to this place where does he they see things happening around your life and as much as it's unbearable to the flesh but in your heart they say there is something special for God to take me through all of this there is something special that is what is at the back of their mind because they know that his thoughts concerning us are not evil God don't have evil thoughts we have to constantly remind ourselves that God do not have evil thoughts right evil talks do not proceed from God he thoughts are good but Power with character is fed to rule and since we won he want us to share even his throne on the same basis he he overcame and he sat down in his father's room then we have to we have to overcome praise the Lord and many times we just we we have to overcome our naive way of thinking our religious way of thinking yes sir praise the Lord amen God is not going to change his mind about you praise the Lord you're not going to impress God for him to get a better idea about you right to overcome our mind we have reduced God to our selfishness praise the Lord but I'll tell you he stayed in the heavens you have just make an idol for yourself yes sir that's not almighty God and the little temporary suffering we go through brother Branham call it temporary because they have a time that it begins it will have a time to end praise the Lord we have to go back in the Bible and look for how many times the Bible says and it came to pass to remind ourselves that this one would come to pass that little temporary suffering we go through now it's not that water to be compared with their tremendous Glory that will be revealed amen reveal in us when he comes are we together now he takes this other thought he says now this is not against rich people and we're not against going to school we're not against working praise the Lord because God can save a rich man Joseph amatias was a rich man the Bible said Jesus was buried among the reach that's why Isaiah prophesied he will be buried among the reach some of God's children are rich but money can be such a snail now only to those who have it but to those of us who don't have it praise the Lord money can be such a snail not only to those who have it but to those who don't have it yeah he says way back there in the first age James cry out to those who were putting stocks in wealthy people have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ with respect a person that's what James said he says the Paul there were trying to butter up the rich in order to get help rather than trusting in God yeah rather than trusting in God praise the Lord can we learn to trust in God yes sir if there is one powerful christ-like virtue is to trust in God praise the Lord amen amen is who trust in God not just from our head or something that wrestled him down in our heart praise the Lord he said James said don't do it said James don't do it money is in everything amen money is in everything people will quote ecclesiastic money and so all but money is not all right right money is not all amen just like Paul says uh uh uh is is is uh the root of all evil the Love of Money not money but the love of him yes sir when it starts to take the place of almighty God in your life a consumed most of most of your time then the worship comes on then the time you must spend with God and spend with the people that God has given you yes sir are we together we're talking about holy decency holidays and said it's all about discipline amen it's all about discipline it brings you to a position in Christ I mean that you can get soul to that place where you even consider the rest of your body you say I must be in bed by this time God give me Grace right and when that time comes you can shut everything and give your body rest and say let me just give my body good rest good eight hour of sleep money isn't everything morning isn't the answer either and today it is it is not the answer either right we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accompanied spiritually praise the Lord less is being accompanied spiritually in our own life in our own home in our own church because we we have to understand the home is the backbone of the church right right if the home is now strong we we just we're putting up a show here if the word is not in our home if prayer is not in our home we're just putting up a show praise the Lord amen I will say that we're not spending time home you will not be in church you won't spend time in church if you're not spending time home you won't be in church praise the Lord if the home that you are paying for you will not have the time to spend there and spend time with your family you have every reason to be away from church praise the Lord listen to a program few few days or a few weeks ago and and uh and this this pastor was talking about we can't get people to come back to church after covet so we have to work out a way down to be able to set up our people online so churches are going to online service becoming just like a another Amazon you have his place because of distance of people that's not what I'm talking about praise the Lord amen because if it is not in you you can be right in the church time for service you will go out it has to be in you we have more wealth than ever and yet less is being accomplished spiritually it is not with money that God works he moved by his spirit and that moving of the spirit only comes to a life consecrated [Music] it only comes to a life consecrated the moving of the spirit only comes to a life concentrated Elijah what are you doing with that Bible and you're trying to make a new Bible praise the Lord the moving of the spirit only comes to a life praise the Lord gross darkness is upon us is being prophesied it's upon us we can see it praise the Lord I mean if we have light people will now be on the road rage I mean it should be completely dark for them not to see there are a lot of cars on the road right gross darkness is upon us brotherly kindness holy decency and position in Christ brother Bannon says when she when she when she find these things she will call unto the others and say come and rejoice with me praise the Lord the word can give us a decent life they can keep this and saying in our home The Prodigal Son musicians you can come we are looking at the place of these two sons and uh and every one of us go through those stages praise the Lord every one of us have gone through a place of wasting God's gift the gift of time the gift of things that he has given us praise the Lord we try to work our way back and not realizing that everything that the father
