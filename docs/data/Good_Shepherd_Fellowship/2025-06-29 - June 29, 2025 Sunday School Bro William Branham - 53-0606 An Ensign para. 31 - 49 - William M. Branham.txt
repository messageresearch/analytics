TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] long go. He said, "Preacher, do you believe that divine healing is by the atonement?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "Well, if I prove to you that's wrong, would you believe what Isaiah said there about?" I said, "Yes, sir." Said, "If I prove to you that's wrong, will you accept it?" I said, "Yes, sir. If you prove it's wrong, God knows I I want to be right with God." I said, "I certainly want to be right with God." So he said, "If I prove to you it's wrong, then you'll accept it." Yes. He said, "Matthew 8 said when they brought Jesus brought all the they brought the sick to him that he heal him that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of by the prophet Isaiah." Why? I said, "Do you mean to apply that to the atonement?" He said, "By his wounded for our transgressions, with his stripes or he bore our infirmities." Said, "Yes." Why? I said, "Then if that be the truth, the atonement had more power before it was made." That's a year and six months before Jesus died. Then the atonement had more power before it was was made than Edith in the force. I said, "Who did Peter heal the man at the gate called beautiful? What kind of a power did he have?" He said, "Only the twel apostles only one had that power." I said, "Shame on you and have a doctor's degree." I said, "I got a boy at home eight years old knows better than that. No better scripture than that." I said, "Do you say the only 12 apostles?" He said, "Yes." I said, "What about Philillip? He wasn't an apostle. He was just a deacon. And he went out there and healed the sick and cast out devils and had a great revival. Many more too." Notice, but he said, he said, "Well, brother Brandon, if there was divine healing was included in the atonement, it would be so killed to there wouldn't even be any pain." I said, "Is there temptation?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Then there's pain, temptation. If the if the atonement kills sin so bad, there's no more temptation then. But it's by faith you overcome your temptation. It's by faith you overcome your pain. It's in the atonement." I said, "We won't argue with that. I'll ask you one thing. Does divine healing in the word?" He said, "Yes." You have to believe that because Jesus said, "The things that I do and whatsoever things you desire, where's divine healing?" What it is when you pray, believe you receive it. said, "It's in the word, but it's not in the atonement." I said, "Then if it's in the word, it's over the atonement." Oh, he said, "Brother Brandon, ridiculous." And a great singer and a great radio minister was standing there too, and this fellow was a quite a character. And he said, "Well, Brother Brandham said, "That's ridiculous. You mean the word is over the atonement?" I said, "Yes, sir. God's got to keep his word." He's got I said, "I'm just believe what God said the truth." He said, "Well, no." I said, "Brother, there was a king one time that had a kingdom and he had the rules and regulations. He made all the everything was to be made in that kingdom and he had a penalty for a certain sin and a slave committed that sin." Let's give him a little parable. Now, I said, "Then he came up and the king said, "Well, there's not one thing if you do the penalty of that sin is to die the death." And the poor fellow was shaking. He said, "Now wait, what can I do for you for take your life?" He said, "Give me a glass of water." He gave him a glass of water. The poor fellow couldn't hold it. He thought his head was going to be cut off. So he his shaking like that. He said, "Now wait a minute." He said, "I'm not going to take your life till you drink that glass of water." The slave poured it on the ground. I said, "Now what's the king going to do?" Oh, he said, "That was a slip up on the king." I said, "It was." Then God saluced. He put it in his word without making an atonement for it. Slip up on God. I know no. I said, "It's in the atonement rather." That's right. When it's in the word, God's got to keep his word. If he's a man of If he's a man of his word, you'll keep his word. And he said, "Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it and you shall have it." That's right. It'll be given to you. All right. Just believe it. All right. Bring the lady. Come ahead, lady. Little cap on. I guess she's Amish. And so then when I've never seen her in my life, she's a total stranger to me. Uh I never knew her. You don't know me, do you, ladies? You don't know me. You before just till now, huh? All right. Now, I want you to come right around here, ladies, so I can get I want to get too far from the microphone. You see, because I my voice sometimes go down. If you notice, see, you're in you're in two dimensions at one time, two phases. You're here and you're looking at something that's happened maybe back when you was a little girl. Something went on in your life somewhere and then and then you're two places at the same time and I'm talking yet I'm somewhere else yet I'm conscious that in body form I'm standing on the platform. That's what makes me so weak and tears me up. You remember the prophet Daniel who had a vision one day and was troubled many days over of his head. Jesus, remember that angel came down on the pool and the first person got a heal while all the virtue went off of the the water and you had to wait for a month or more maybe for it to come back another season, whatever was considered a season. You remember that in the Bible? I'm just talking to you like our Lord talked to the woman at the at the well at Samaria. Now, you you got a human spirit just and I have and there's we're perfect strangers to each other but in way I just look at the people out there several hundreds of people sitting there each one of them is a supernatural being inside and just a full of spirit and then I have to contact your life just as Jesus turned and perceived what the thoughts of the people was and so forth he stood and talked to that woman then he went right straight and told her where her trouble was Is that right? You remember where was that? It's found in St. John the 4th chapter. The woman at the well. You remember reading that? He's wonderful, isn't he? You believe that he rose up from the dead? You did. And that he's living among man tonight, the same Jesus. Then if it's the same Jesus, he'll do just like he did in that day. His spirit among his people. Is that right? It's the same thing. That's good. And um it's so hard preaching and then trying to see if you just just prayed with me the believers. Yes. Here it comes. Now, you just was a little bit afraid, wasn't you? You just a little nervous. That's why don't see you just holding yourself back. But look, you are you have a a condition. Your condition is in inward trouble of the stomach. Isn't that right? That's right. It's a stomach trouble. It's been some time. It's a caused from a nervous condition that makes you have a sour stomach and cramps and so forth and spit up stuff in your mouth which is sour. It's it's an acid. gastric conditions in the stomach. You see, he calls them peptic ulcer that makes your food come up. A little regurgitation comes up like that to it. Pretty close to what he said, wasn't it? How did I know that? If we were just revealed to by God is right. That's right. Now, if we would talk a little longer, maybe he would tell me something else of you. There's lots of people here to be prayed for. But you got had something struck your mind. Then you got a husband that's not well too. Isn't that right? Is that That's right. Raise up your hand. That's He has a bladder trouble, doesn't he? Is that right? Raise up your hand. That's right. You believe that's the spirit of God that you hearing? You believe that God is re it's coming from some supernatural resource, isn't it? sits a little against your teaching that you've been taught that is that's right now you know that's you can't lie now because I you wouldn't do it anyhow because I'm in the presence of you're in the presence of his being here's another thing I see there's an accident just happened in your family some time ago wasn't a boy he got hit with an automobile about two years ago he's got something wrong with his head he calls his memory and things is that right yes it is now do you believe yes I do now come here almighty God author of life give mercy and life unto this poor woman heal her Lord and let her loved ones be made well also Lord. May this be the night of nights for them and may oh God all that back let them walk in the light as the light comes to them Lord and may they be called your children Lord and serve you and love you and be made well in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I want to ask you mother what you heard talking then it was my voice but it wasn't me using it. what he told you is the truth. And now you go and believe just what has been said and you'll get well. God bless you. Go this way. Are you one of the ushers, sir? Are you believing? Just believe with all your heart. God knows all things. But if you will be real reverent now while it's coming. How do you do sir? I suppose that we are strangers too. Are we Sarah? I never met you in my life. But God has known both of us since we were born. And he's fed you. He's fed me. And here we are this far along in life. And someday we got to stand in his presence to give an account for the deeds that's done in our bodies. And what we should be really reverent people, shouldn't we? Sir, you're here tonight on a mission, not for yourself. You're here for a mission for a loved one. And I believe it's your wife. Is that right? That's right. Your wife has undergone some major operations and she's at the point of death. That's right. Is that the truth? You got a handkip in your pocket? Hand it to me. Just a minute. Almighty God, when Israel was cornered there and the Red Sea before them, the mountains, Pharaoh's army pushing. But you look down through that pillar of fire with angry eyes, said one of the poets. And the Red Sea got scared and moved back because Israel was on the homeward march to the promised land. God, tonight this poor woman laying there very low, near unto death, she's done all that she can do. The doctors, your servants, has done all they can do. Everybody's done all they can do. And now thou Jehovah Gyariah, Lord's provided sacrifice, this crucial moment. I pray Lord as in the Bible we're taught that the taken from the body of Paul handkerchiefs or aprons and unclean spirits went out and people were healed. We know we're not the St. Paul but we know that you're still the same Lord Jesus who honored the faith of the people. Then Lord I send this handkerchief to that dying woman and asked for her life to be spared in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Don't doubt. Let no one touch that handkerchief and put it on your wife's underneath garment next to her heart. Get down to the side of her and pray. Confess everything that you know and promise God to live for him. Let us know a few days later what's happened to her. God bless you. God be with you. Now go and don't doubt. Just believe all things and God will certainly perform. You believe this. Have faith. God will certainly grant the things that he has promised for he cannot fail. He's God. Now sister want to speak to you just a moment. And now to this audience here I suppose I I don't know you. Uh, as far as I know, I never seen him alive. But God does know you. But this woman being a stranger to me, the Lord knows that I'm probably stranger to her unless she's been in a meeting somewhere and seen me. We don't know one another at all. Well, if the Holy Spirit will reveal this woman's life and me claiming to you of being his servant, that is the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that raised from the dead is here among us tonight. And God will perform just exactly what he said he would do, claiming and proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I listen to you that would resent it. Maybe your teaching could have been a little bit off. Remember the Pharisees in them days thought they were just exactly right. They were holy, renowned, fundamental, religious man. And they rejected the Jesus. They thought they know just how he must be. But God always confounds the wise and prudent. Now remember, if this would happen to be right and you would be wrong, you'd be blaspheming the Holy Spirit. You'd be doomed forever. Without mercy, this world or the world to come. You have prostate trouble, don't you, sir? Your wife sitting next to you with the rectal trouble, too. Isn't that right? Is that true? You were both healed right then while I was talking. You don't need your prayer. You don't have prayer cards anyhow. You don't need them. The little lady sitting right next to there also she has been sick. [Music] A kidney trouble. But just have faith in God there. God make you well. I be rever you look here at me right at me just a moment. I want to talk to you as your brother. Now, we are perfect and total strangers to each other. And the Lord Jesus, little lady, you had a nerve condition sitting right there with that man, haven't you? You've been real nervous for a long time. Isn't that right? He healed you just then. So, you're you're well now. You can go home and be well. God bless you. Have mercy for you. I be reverent. No, you don't live here. You come a long ways from here. Isn't that right? You come from the state of Illinois. Is that right? About a 200 mile journey you took. Is that right? And you're suffering with something wrong in your lungs, a lung condition. and say, "I see you trying to get out of a bed of a morning. You have an arthritis condition, too. It makes you stiff." That's true. Do you believe Christ will make you well? Look to me. I don't You know what I mean? Like Peter and John said, "Look on us." Elijah the prophet said, "If it wasn't our respected presence of Jehoshaphat, I wouldn't even look to you." Now believe you've been you've been in a prayer meeting before. It wasn't mine. It was a man kind of heavy set chunky built with a kind of a brown hair and he kind of has a frown on his face like very sharp speaking man at the meeting. Is that right? If that's right, raise your hand. I've seen it come before me. It can't be nothing else. God can't lie. The doctor told you to go home. I see him telling you said you only thing for you do is take a a long rest in the hospital or wait I see a prairie. He said you could go west if you wanted to. Is that right? Is that what he told you? That's right. That's exactly right. You have a little son at home, don't you? And he has a lung trouble too, doesn't he? If that's right, raise up your hand. That's right. Come here just a moment, please. Almighty God, author of life, giver of every good gift, send thy blessings upon this woman, upon her household while she's standing here in the Holy Spirit moving through her now. May she go home and get well. Father, as your servant, I bless her with my hands laying upon her in the name of Jesus Christ. and Satan, you who bound her, done all this evil, we come tonight as the Christian people in the representative name of Jesus Christ. And we adjure thee by him that you leave the woman and bother her no more. Come out of her through Jesus Christ's name. Now return, don't doubt nothing. You get well. God bless you. All right. Do you believe? If the Holy Spirit will just tell you what's wrong, you're conscious that something's going on. That's the angel of the Lord. You see his picture? That's just what's waving over you now. your troubles in your back. Is that right? Now go ahead. You're going to get well. He's blessed you. God be with you and bless you. Let's say thanks be to God. Do you believe with all your heart? Just a moment. Somebody sitting right there sir got a back trouble too. Was that right sir? He was healed just now then. When that man was healed that spirit called out for help. God bless you. You were praying, wasn't you, sir? I thought you were. I've seen someone praying with a back like that and I heard that scream come out. I looked back and I seen this man. Then I heard it call and I seen a light hang over you. So it must be that it was you. That lady sitting right down there at the other side there has a nervous trouble been bothering her right down there in that light head. Ain't that right, sister? Yes, sir. You've had nervous trouble. Isn't that right? You just got healed just then. God made you well. That little lady sitting right behind her, that female trouble sitting right back there behind her, too. You just healed the same time. Sister, you can stand up also. Raise up your hand. You had a female trouble. It's been on the ovary. So, was abscess. It's gone from you. Now, you can be healed. Go home. Amen. [Applause] Why do you doubt God? Sir, would you like to go eat your supper? Enjoy it again? You believe me to be his prophet? Well then in the name of Jesus Christ, go and eat your supper, eat your breakfast, testify of your healing, the ulcer is gone from your stomach. God bless you. You believe that? You don't doubt. Come lady, do you believe you believe me to be his servant? If God would tell me what was wrong with you quickly without saying anything farther. So much of that gets me so weak it'll get swimming. You believe that does that? Our Lord said virtue has gone out from me. What is virtue strength? When the woman touched his garment it's pulling from all over this audience and you got heart trouble. Is that right? How you believe you're healed? Then go and testify of it. God will be with you. You had the same thing, sir. So you can just keep walking. God did the same thing. Female trouble. Just keep going. Be made well in the name of the Lord Jesus. You believe out there with all your heart, don't doubt. Have faith now. God will bring it to pass. If you absolutely believe it and don't doubt at all, God will bring it to pass. Be reverent. Have faith in God. What about way up in the corner there? Are you believing? Raise up your hand. Stay right with it. Just went to the corner twice. Hallelujah. Now come here lady. You don't get over that cancer. You would you accept Jesus as your healer now? Now hope to won't do it. Sister you either look or die. You look, you live. It's up to you. Father, I pray for faith for the woman. May she live in Jesus Christ's name. I ask it. Amen. God be with you. How do you do, lady? You believe me to be his servant? You believe that he's here now? You believe his spirit's here to make you well? You're a stranger here in this city, too. You're from Toleda. Is that right? Aren't you a minister? Your husband's a minister, too. That's right. Sitting right there. Never seen him alive. But you got heart trouble, haven't you? You're healed. God bless you. Go on. See, your mental attitude is quite a difference between you and the lady just passed here. Go go have faith. All right. Come, sir. Believing. Almighty God, I ask you to heal the man, deliver him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May it be so. Amen. That's the way you heal while you're sitting right there in God bless you. All right. You know, if you ever had heart trouble and be made well, if you want to accept it right now and believe that God's going to make you well, Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the woman and may she go home tonight and get completely well through Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Now, go look, look, live, see, believe him with all your heart. God will bring it to pass. Let's say thanks be to God. [Music]
