[5:00] some of the finest boys that I ever met
[5:02] their
[5:03] man uh that I've ever met and just
[5:06] quickly just as soon as they heard the
[5:09] message they were sold on it
[5:12] 100% now that can only come by for
[5:16] ordination the only way it can
[5:19] come now the question is here I thinking
[5:23] that see not why the Lord was bring me
[5:24] back and know it knowest know it not th
[5:28] naked miserable wretched blind and know
[5:31] it not before I get to that spot I might
[5:34] brief what I said a few days ago heing a
[5:37] message on I believe it was the uh God
[5:41] of this world blinded the eyes of the
[5:44] people that they
[5:47] absolutely worshiped the
[5:50] devil in religious
[5:52] Services did you all get that all of you
[5:54] understood it and then in that same
[5:57] message I brought the subject that a
[6:00] woman
[6:01] wearing immoral clothes
[6:05] indecently she is be judged at the
[6:09] Judgment bar as a street prostitute that
[6:13] sounds awful strange let me draw you a
[6:15] little
[6:17] picture now here is an attorney in the
[6:20] city a young fell and he's a nice man as
[6:25] far as as politically I imagine he may
[6:28] be decent any his
[6:30] politics and then um he goes with a girl
[6:33] that's very popular they fall in love
[6:36] and marry they T to all the parties and
[6:39] the great uh things and they all drink
[6:42] together finally she uh has a nice home
[6:46] he lives in a nice neighborhood he's
[6:49] well thought of amongst the people but
[6:51] he both of them
[6:54] drink she wears shorts cuts her hair
[6:57] wears makeup everything just as sexi
[7:02] beautiful woman displaying herself well
[7:05] she never goes to church at all neither
[7:07] one of them so moving next door to him
[7:12] comes a woman from the Baptist Church or
[7:15] the Methodist Church her and her
[7:18] husband now this woman uh let's make it
[7:21] Methodist because the Methodist sco a
[7:23] little more on Holiness than the Baptist
[7:25] all except the New Testament Baptist
[7:27] they believe in Holiness but usually
[7:29] Baptist don't go for Holiness at all see
[7:31] they don't believe in such a thing so
[7:34] then now let's make it Methodist cause
[7:36] to believe in
[7:37] Holiness and uh then a Methodist woman
[7:41] moves next door to this woman on the
[7:44] same street her husband is um let's say
[7:48] he's a public accountant and uh or some
[7:52] office
[7:53] well this Methodist woman looks over to
[7:57] the other woman and when this lawyer
[7:59] goes out of town say his name is John
[8:03] say his name is John now don't presume
[8:05] on that now I miss taking fiction names
[8:08] now and his name is
[8:10] John well she used to go with
[8:13] Ralph and that's fiction name all of it
[8:16] see just so you get the story to make
[8:18] the
[8:19] picture well first thing you know at a
[8:22] drunken party Ralph hugs her again well
[8:25] she gets all fired up because she's in
[8:28] love again with Ralph she think things
[8:30] then after a while Ralph begins to meet
[8:33] her and she can put it over John pull it
[8:36] over his eyes and she thinks she's
[8:38] pretty smart duck because she can run
[8:41] with Ralph married to John see the woman
[8:44] don't even have a very bearing of
[8:49] decency and she thinks nothing about
[8:52] that but this Methodist woman has raised
[8:55] up in another bracket she does at least
[8:58] go to church
[8:59] chur and she thinks that that woman is
[9:03] horrible while she says to her husband
[9:05] when he comes in I see that man go in
[9:07] there and meet her and when John's out
[9:10] on a Case somewhere Philadelphia
[9:12] somewhere he takes her out in this
[9:15] Roadster and they lay out on the beach I
[9:19] see him come home don't even pull the
[9:20] curtains down sometime kissing her and
[9:22] making love to her next door oh isn't
[9:24] that awful she says to her husband well
[9:27] she's nothing but a public prostitute
[9:30] it's true she's worse than a public
[9:32] prostitute because she's a married woman
[9:35] and she U This Woman This Methodist
[9:38] woman thinks that's horrible she never
[9:39] goes to church now this Methodist woman
[9:42] would not do a thing like that no indeed
[9:45] she's a decent woman and another thing
[9:48] she would not touch a bit of whiskey
[9:52] because the Methodist Church 90% of
[9:54] their program is probation against
[9:56] whiskey against whiskey so they got a
[9:58] pro program and them people of that
[10:01] Methodist Church don't live no higher
[10:03] than that church
[10:05] teaches but this same woman this
[10:08] Methodist woman goes out of an evening
[10:10] with her husband wearing shorts on
[10:12] Sunday after Sunday school she cuts her
[10:14] hair she wears lipstick and even smokes
[10:16] a
[10:18] little now in God's word there are both
[10:21] prostitutes
[10:23] right but this one here is naked
[10:26] miserable wretched blind and don't know
[10:30] it one's just as guilty as the
[10:34] other for a man that looks upon a woman
[10:37] to lust after her has committed adultery
[10:40] with her already in his heart and if
[10:43] this woman now she'd say wait just a
[10:46] minute Mr brandom I'll give you to
[10:48] understand I am no prostitute my sister
[10:51] maybe if you'd be tucked before a Bible
[10:53] and put your hands up on the presence of
[10:55] God and swear that you've been this this
[10:58] true true your husband as you could be

[11:16] grandmother should walk down on the
[11:17] street with them shorts on that have put
[11:20] her an insane institution she come out
[11:22] without her dress on there's something
[11:24] wrong with her mind if it was so then

[11:30] world into Insanity amen the whole
[11:33] thing's
[11:34] insane and it's so gradually crap until
[11:37] the people don't know

[11:44] husband bow to her body but before God
[11:46] she's got a evil prostitute Spirit on
[11:50] her that makes her dress like that and
[11:52] she's in the lady of seean church agent

[11:57] innocent woman don't know that God will
[12:00] judge her for a
[12:02] prostitute there you are you get it to
[12:05] her you can't tell her there's no way of
[12:09] getting it to her the Bible said they're

[12:15] amen amen if you call her a prostitute
[12:18] personally she have you
[12:20] arrested she would I never talk

[12:30] no no I say that the doctrine of that
[12:33] see the whole thing together I don't
[12:35] call individual it's not individuals
[12:38] it's the system that they're in it's a
[12:40] world
[12:42] system brother George right sitting

[12:54] shorts well You' have never You' have
[12:56] you'd have had the woman locked up You'
[12:58] you have never married
[13:01] her well if any young man in that day
[13:04] would have done it the same thing would
[13:05] have took
[13:06] place well if it was sin and wrong then
[13:10] it's the same thing but the people has
[13:12] growed into Insanity
[13:15] Amen Let Me prophesy something to you
[13:19] just before it comes to
[13:21] pass a whole world is grouping in
[13:24] insanity and will get worse and worse
[13:27] and worse
[13:29] I'm telling you be a bunch of
[13:32] Maniacs it's almost that way
[13:35] now could you imagine a man driving with
[13:38] his lights off on the wrong side of the
[13:40] road a Ricky young kid supposed to be
[13:42] right out of high
[13:44] school kill a bunch of people is that
[13:46] stop him the next him come right behind
[13:49] him doing the same thing can you imagine
[13:52] a young man that thinks any anything of
[13:54] himself getting out here and acting the
[13:56] way they do could you imagine a young
[13:58] woman and the bloom of Womanhood
[14:01] beautiful well built shaped profile
[14:06] face beautiful and the very thing of her
[14:09] being pretty
[14:11] shows that we're to end
[14:17] time see she's went all together to
[14:20] worldly
[14:21] feature wory things and not the beauty
[14:25] of
[14:26] Holiness amen Sweetness in her oh I've
[14:29] seen women on the outside of them wasn't
[14:32] nothing to look at but you speak to them
[14:34] one time talk to them a few minutes
[14:36] they're real genuine something that you
[14:39] can't get away
[14:43] from see beauty of the outside is of the
[14:46] devil it's of the world look at King's
[14:50] Children how they went into it when the
[14:53] sons of God saw the daughters of man
[14:55] were Fair they taken under them wives
[14:57] and God never did forgive them look at
[15:00] them Israelite women with with calloused
[15:03] hands and hair stringing when them sons
[15:06] of God came up through the land of boab
[15:08] and met them daining women with wh set
[15:10] hair fcy and a lot of manicure on their
[15:14] faces or what you call it and when them
[15:16] sons of God saw those real fair women a
[15:18] false prophet said we're all the same
[15:21] that's right and they married among them
[15:25] and God never did forgive them they
[15:27] perished in the wilderness
[15:29] every one of them died there without
[15:32] hope without God and eternally lost D
[15:35] forever though they had seen the
[15:38] goodness of God though they had drank
[15:41] from the fountain that never runs dry
[15:44] they drun from the smitten Rock they had
[15:46] seen the brass serpent perform Miracles
[15:49] that come out from under the baptism of
[15:50] Moses and the Sea they had seen the hand
[15:52] of God that eat Angels food and had done
[15:55] all those things but married in that
[15:58] women bring them
[16:00] in and marry among them not commit
[16:04] adultery just marry among them God never
[16:07] did forgive
[16:08] it that's the second time it met now
[16:11] here we are on third
[16:13] time more deceiving now than
[16:17] ever I know that's
[16:21] hard and I've often wondered in many
[16:24] ways how will it ever be why do I have
[16:27] to talk so IAL to people what makes it
[16:31] so and yet I
[16:34] noticed if it wasn't God there wouldn't
[16:36] be nobody not a woman who sit and listen
[16:38] at me amen but they come
[16:42] back amen because there's somebody
[16:45] that's got a little anchor of Truth
[16:47] there that knows that that's right
[16:49] regardless they know it's
[16:52] right now watch what
[16:55] happened I know it's hard it's just like
[16:59] if a doctor give you medicine you refuse
[17:01] to take
[17:02] it then don't blame the doctor if you
[17:06] die and this is like
[17:10] medicine what about these people they
[17:12] always claim to me to be a woman hater
[17:14] you see you just watch the way the women
[17:16] act I'll show you where the church is
[17:18] the women morals isn't lady oia in the
[17:21] world
[17:22] physically
[17:24] naked
[17:26] miserable blind and don't know
[17:29] it the CH the people the women of the
[17:32] world and the church is in the same
[17:35] stage watch's the natural type the
[17:38] spiritual right through each
[17:41] time now someday at the Judgment bar I
[17:46] know it's not popular to say it and if a
[17:49] man's not already to say it you better
[17:50] not say it because you're impersonating
[17:53] and then you'll get in trouble sure
[17:54] enough now
[17:56] notice I'm actually she looked like in
[17:59] times held a woman's mouth open and
[18:01] poured the medicine in her
[18:03] mouth and then hold my hands over her
[18:06] mouth and she'll spin it out every
[18:08] time what if a doctor did that to a
[18:11] patient then the patient
[18:13] died because they refused to
[18:17] swallow the medicine at the Judgment
[18:20] bar when all these things like cutting
[18:24] hair and wearing shorts and I'm only
[18:27] building the hours coasted
[18:29] hand when you're going to see something
[18:32] happen when something's going to take
[18:34] place in all this background here has
[18:36] only been laying a foundation for a
[18:38] short quick message that'll shake the
[18:40] whole
[18:42] Nations why I've been picking on women
[18:45] it's just been laying up here for
[18:46] something that you can hit it around the
[18:47] head with
[18:50] it even trying to tell them watch TR
[18:53] holding the hand down like guess this
[18:55] what mouth just spit it out then who can
[18:57] blame the doctor
[18:59] how are you going to say at the day of
[19:01] the
[19:02] judment when the very voices is cried
[19:05] out against it or play the record right
[19:07] back in the face of the people then how
[19:10] are they going to get away from
[19:13] it spit it out between your fingers pour
[19:16] some more down and finally shake their
[19:18] head and re go back and go back W do
[19:22] it get you come back again and pour it
[19:25] in
[19:26] again then who's to blame not the doctor
[19:31] not the medicine but the attitude of the
[19:36] person
[19:38] exactly be a horrible day one of these
[19:40] days when this sinful adulter this
[19:43] generation stands before almighty
[19:45] God I see my ears creeping up my
[19:49] shoulders stooping and I know 30 years
[19:52] here in this platform here 33 years here
[19:56] on the field a that's a long life that's
[20:00] 33 years of service only one recret I
[20:03] have that I didn't have 133 years of it

[20:54] can
[20:55] imagine when the Holy Spirit
[20:59] take you up into a sphere then the whole
[21:02] thing looks
[21:04] chaos then when you come back down you
[21:06] seem like you're to the people you're a
[21:09] rascal that you're you're nothing but an
[21:12] old
[21:13] sarcastic you're a
[21:16] fool because you stand as an old crank
[21:19] and always rebuking the people or if you
[21:22] ever climb into them Spears one time
[21:24] where you can be in the presence of God
[21:26] not through emotion but to
[21:30] genuine Holy Spirit lifting up the whole
[21:33] thing is wrote eobot the glory of the
[21:37] Lord has departed from the whole
[21:39] denominational

[22:02] inside of that ring that's three rings
[22:06] three circles now that's
[22:09] you that's
[22:12] God God in a trinity is one and without
[22:16] a trinity he's not God he can't be
[22:19] manifested any other way and neither can
[22:21] you be manifested without being the
[22:23] Trinity person that you are that's Body
[22:27] Spirit
[22:55] now let me draw you a little circle
[22:59] if I had a Blackboard but I want you to
