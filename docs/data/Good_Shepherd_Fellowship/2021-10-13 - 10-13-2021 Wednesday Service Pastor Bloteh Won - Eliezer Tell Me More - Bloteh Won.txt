this weekend you all come on fire to the house of the lord tonight i don't know what is the minnesota weather that is uh freezing us up but the call has not come yet praise the lord but it's good to be in the house of the lord amen hallelujah the lord bless you you may have your seed and you know let me say things you know this part of the service which is worship it has is very very important road amen there's that's what god looks up for us to come even the preaching of the word is not just a man coming to shout at us or tell us how much he have read his bible but it's a way that we worship the lord amen it's all part of worship to the lord praise the lord and even though we termed to look at a mode in terms of singing and the music which of course is very important very important i will tell you if you be doing bad singing it just it flat him and tired he take out all the air out of my tired i'm sitting in the office i see what's going on lord send us some angels and calm about us lord deliver us praise the lord amen praise the lord and you know uh one of the brothers down there from from tennessee wrote a song that he entitled eliezer tell me more and and it's all about uh the the messenger that went to go and get a bribe for isaac and so i want to i want to speak on there tonight eliezer tell me more and uh i thought we will we could learn the chorus together it's it's actually not a congregational song sometimes that's the thing that is difficult in singing some songs that are not congregational songs when you try to introduce it to the congregation it's different when you are singing alone and it's also different when you're singing in a group praise the lord hallelujah so uh you know i i love singing and then it's not so it's not so difficult for me to spoil the songs to very easy praise the lord so what let's let's just put the chorus up let me see if if we can learn it together um eliza tell me more isaac looks like [Music] i never seen him yet i'm to be his bride i will not be able to sing it i need to do more practice you agree with me that i need to do more practice praise the lord amen [Music] well okay so let's just stand on our feet tonight we will read the word maybe if the holy spirit comes and anoint the word tonight and uh and live our spirit up he might be able to help us to sing it at the end of the service praise the lord and uh it's good to see good to see each and every one of you praise the lord good to see you brother aaron now what i want us to do tonight is that uh let's go to genesis chapter 22. let's go to genesis chapter 22. let's go to genesis chapter 22. i will talk about eliezer but i want to i want to set genesis chapter 22 tonight praise the lord genesis chapter 22 then we read from verse one and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and which actually he tested abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thine own son isaac whom da lovett praise the lord amen and get thee and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain which i will tell thee off praise the lord and abraham arose up early in the morning and soldered his eyes and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clint and enclaved the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had taught him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off now three days joining and abraham said unto his young men about year by year here with the eyes and i and the lead will go yonder and worship and come again to you which of course actually that could be like a prophecy because abraham god is telling him go and sacrifice your son but he's telling these men we are going to sacrifice and we will come back praise the lord so uh in one sense he was prophesying the lord bless you have your seat we continue to read praise the lord amen okay i will stop there to that verse five i will stop there because there are there are few verses that i want to uh i want to pick up pick up on this praise the lord but jordan i'm going to spoil this thing tonight because it's uh for some reason it's kind of for eating up my ears praise the lord now if we look into the scripture tonight uh uh like we that like we love to do you will realize you realize this it actually struck me and because it struck me that's the reason why you know i can do without talking about it you realize that the word love was first time used in the bible in this chapter praise the lord the word love the first time love will be used in the scripture oh praise the lord kind of struck me and it kind of forgot my attention that the first time love will be used in the bible will be at this very same it just tell you what really love is it's not all the emotion that we go through love is sacrifice that almighty god honor the direction of the god of heaven and earth that is the altar of his word the first time that he will use love will be on this scene of isaac abraham and isaac we're talking about there in the book of malachite and we we we we spoke a little bit about uh uh the four different laws that we could bring out of the scripture we are uh redemptive loving and uh sacrificial love elective love and and and also corrective love now uh uh it i mean it really struck me yesterday i was i was uh i was listening i was uh molding the learning and uh uh i had my earphone in my ears and and listening to you know i was just uh listening to some things and message and different things and uh and and uh because i had i had this subject on my mind but then it just it just kind of struck me you know when when uh realized i said no i had to go back in and kind of look look look at the scripture and so i when i got done what i was doing i went back and looking and realized i said oh yeah you know uh it's it's it's it's actually you know actually strange praise the lord and and it it also goes to show that uh you know god never just gave the instruction of writing his word because he did not have anything to say you know and even the men that were inspired you know about by the holy spirit to be able to pull the scriptures together just to see the way they lay it out is is is kind of for you know uh uh is is is fascinating but yeah this really got my attention yesterday that uh the first time that god or i mean uh love would be written in the bible would be in this uh in this chapter and just to see that uh it's a great senior but that's not what i i want to draw your mind to tonight what i wanted for us to look at tonight is this abraham and uh uh i go to abraham and says go and sacrifice your son and with many account it is proving that isaac was almost about the age of spiritual maturity he was about 30 years old when when god told abraham to go and sacrifice him now so you can see some some some places there but the all of that is now what i want to get to tonight what i want to get to tonight is that uh uh for many times for many years to i've always thought that uh when god told abraham to do this he was just a little boy i've i've always thought that i've preached that before but i come to realize that it was natural but that is now what i'm getting to tonight what i'm getting to tonight is that um i want for us to watch uh a pattern in the scripture now brother branham said you will find it in the church-ish book you will find in in revelation series brother branham said this i have one quote here revelation chapter four verse one i mean revelation four number one let's let's read that he talks about the church ages and he talks about how the first three church the first three chapters of revelation showed the church it showed christ in his church amen one standing in the midst of the seven golden candle state and uh and then revelation chapter four come up and says after these things which is after the church ages and and and and the lord called unto john and the angels say come up heaven i will show you things that must shortly come to pass praise the lord and that come of hatha is is another term for the rapture brother branham says the church was raptured in revelation chapter 4 and she never came up again until revelation chapter 19. praise the lord when it talks about the lamb's wife are we together is that familiar with to you but let's let's just read a portion here he says after the church ages after the ages of the church the church never appeared again until revelation the 19th chapter when she returns wave her bridegroom praising god for the wedding so honor a type now honor a type praise the lord you have to understand this is honor a type the uh uh the holy spirit went through the seven church ages in revelation chapter two and three after he introduced himself in revelation chapter 1 and then in revelation chapter 4 come up higher shows a type of the rapture the church is caught up praise the lord and the church does not appear again until it comes in revelation chapter 19 where she referred to us the lamb's wife are we together now this thing really caught my mind it kind of reflect to my mind because uh there's something here in this chapter that plays that out you will see that after abraham uh uh uh everything that's happening up there we we we know the story jehovah jairo how abraham called the place jehovah jarrah and uh and on the mount it will be said you know the lord will provide for himself and uh and and all of that now you will realize that where we stopped abraham said to his seven he said wait for me here me and the lad we're going up he says abide here with the eyes and i and the lord will go yonder and worship and come again to you praise the lord are we together now so if you look at verse 19 in the same chapter after all of this is done god told abraham blessing i will bless you because you held back you held that back your only son for me now in chapter in verse 19 the bible says so abraham returned on to his young man so abraham returned where is isaac praise the lord where is isaac oh definitely i believe that abraham returned with isaac i believe so but watch what is happening here the holy spirit the the the author of this book is doing something very unique that's the reason why brother branham will tell us that you have to run every teaching from genesis to revelation it has to run if not there is a problem somewhere the problem is now with you the problem is just that the holy spirit wants to help you to understand the text now just watch this now so abraham returned onto his young man and the rose up and went to belsheba and abraham dwer did and the bible went on but what you will realize here is that isaac is not mentioned year the next time isaac will be mentioned will be when he's in the field waiting for rebecca so from genesis chapter 22 isaac is no longer mentioned in the text praise the lord are we together praise the lord are we together well if that make you quiet it also make me quiet because it's enough for you to think about it and for you to just see the accuracy of the holy spirit the accuracy of the holy spirit when people argue that the bible contradict itself is because they have never met the altar amen they have not sat down enough to learn they have not sat down enough to know who is the author of this book isaac will now be mentioned again until chapter 24 verse 63 after rebecca is found after eliezer is found now so what what is happening here is that uh uh uh ma memor uh man moriah is uh calvary christ have died on calvary the lamb has has has all the price has been paid now so what is happening what is going to happen here now the next pressing on the scene of action is eliezer is the comforter now you also let me show you another thing in scripture chapter 24 verse 1 and abraham was old and well striking in age and the lord have blessed abraham in all things and abraham said unto his other seven in his house that rule over all that he had put i pray thee the hand honor my time and i'll and and i will make this sword by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth praise the lord amen that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canines among whom i'd word but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred to take a wife unto my son praise the lord amen now so it's beautiful here you get over to chapter you get over to chapter 24 the bible says here abraham called his seven but you will also realize here in chapter 24 the seventh name is not given who is this seven his name is not giving why did the holy spirit allow that oh my saint john chapter 16 verse 13 let's let's read it i heard brother brandon referring to that in message again in john chapter 16 verse 13. the scripture says how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself praise the lord he shall not speak of himself so the holy spirit deliberately never gave us the name of this seven because what is going to happen here it it's not about who is this man it's all about what he's told to do it's all about what he's going to achieve it's not about him it's not about his personality what his name is where he was born and what happened in his life what is important here is to get a bribe for abraham's son praise the lord so the holy spirit deliberately took the name of the seven away the only reason why we can say it's eleazar is because of genesis 15. all through the text oh praise the lord i'm signing crazy tonight am i losing my mind tonight praise the lord amen are we together the holy spirit deliberately took the name of the seven away because jesus says when the spirit of truth comes that's where you know the spirit of truth when a man is just all about promoting himself there is something about it praise the lord when he will spend more time talking about himself i'm talking about the lord jesus or what he have done in our age and what he's doing in the life of his people then there is something maybe that man need more of the grace of god he need another dose of the comforter in his life praise the lord amen because you see that's the reason that's the way people establish themselves in the hearts of the people instead instead of establishing christ you will see that's the reason why the holy spirit took his name out of the text and you also watch the character of this man when he marry back her he never told rebecca where he was born who his mother is and how long he been in abraham a house all he told rebecca was all about isaac because jesus said when the comforter comes will not talk about himself so you you just look at it there see a divine work of the holy spirit it took isaac from the same because there is a seven now that is going to be called just in that period before christ and his bride return on the earth before you see the bride and the bridegroom together there's a seven that is going to be called there's a work that is going to be done and that work is to find a bride the work is to find a bride what is major what is major is to find a bride are we together yeah well you might think that i'm crazy but that's okay praise the lord hallelujah amen brother brown said in the super sign he says when elisa a type of the holy spirit that that come to find a bride he found how in the cool of the evening get what it is this day last day last part of the day when the evening light is shining he phoned her and noticed he had to be with two different people two different people he had to deal with she had a family but the only one that eliezer had to deal with was her mother which is her old church [Laughter] praise the lord oh my and one of the church members praise the lord praise the lord amen brother jordan you can come and finish the message tonight amen because it looks like i'm about to lose it glory be to god now you see i i just wanted to show you this i just wanted to show you that you can never go wrong when you stay with god's word praise the lord don't put an interpretation to it allow god to run his word true he will bring out everything that the messenger of this age said he would bring it out of the bible that's why we love the message because it's out of the bible it's now something from jeffersonville it's not some kind of excluded teaching it's something right from the pages of the bible so we want to talk a little bit about eliezer because that's that's what the holy spirit is is major on the name eliezer means god is his help god is his help eliza means the comforter that what he names means oh praise the lord amen are you glad that we have the comforter amen the comforter is the spirit of truth praise the lord hanes means god is his help god is help so we realize that he comes right after the time of the sacrifice he comes right after abraham has proven his love to god like i said the first time that the word love will be used in the bible if sacrifice is not attached to your love you have problem praise the lord if if what you think about love is all about you and your your feelings and your thoughts you got it wrong amen you are talking about infatuation you're not talking about the love of god because in the love of god there is correction god love is based on sacrifice for god so loved the word man it kind of blew my mind yesterday so my goodness the first time that love it is it's almost like the first time the word pleasure will be mentioned in the bible was when sarah said it i've been an old woman where i have pleasure with my husband and yet the bible says god made us for his pleasure amen glory be to god now so we see here that abraham is sending out this his seven to go and get a bribe for isaac and he has a mission he's he has to go over not in the world now to the canaanites but to go over to the kingdom where i mean abraham country abraham home and find a wife for isaac praise the lord amen amen now let's read here endlessly contending for the faith let me just share some things with you what i wanted to get you tonight i i think if i i've been able to express him i'm just stressing that the holy spirit will be able to to to help you to see it remember it was isaac that wanted a wife then father abraham sent his seven out a very beautiful type of god the father sent him out for his bride to get his bride his seventh the holy spirit eliezer and it was in the court of the evening when beautiful rebecca came out to water the candle you know the story and beautiful rebecca came out and he said now ever who watered this campaign he said lord let thou be the one you have chosen now that was abraham i mean that was eliezer praying we ever come out and water this candle now somewhere there but brahms said uh uh it kind of uh uh you know it struck my mind when i heard him saying that he says he said eliezer sweated it out till he finds character in rebecca we will get to that let's just read a little bit here so he prayed and said whoever lord will come out and water the campbell he said lord let that be the one you have chosen and rebecca went out and watered the candle and gave them to drink and then water it and after after after giving them to drink uh you know uh uh uh i mean you know if you know about campbell and how much they can drink you will know that that was not children's plan the very animal that that she was watering animal represented beasts caused a beast of burden which means power in the bible amen he says in the very animal that she water was the very animal that packed her to see amen her bridegroom is that right yeah he see her bride but it's the bridegroom we know that and and and what is watering their very power that we are watering now with praise and thanksgiving praise the lord the glory the power of the might is the very holy spirit that will pick us up now this is very important tonight to realize that when we come in the house of god i mean that uh like we say over and over it's not a showmanship that's why we must come pray up because when we come in the house of god you have a responsibility to help the song leader bring worship to the house of god praise the lord amen and and and and just like how the preacher must prepare i believe the song leader the musicians even the worshiper we all must prepare because it's very important we come to water the the holy spirit we come to to to be able to bring praises and glory to god because he's saying the very same power that we raise up that we worship that we glorify will be thus very same power that will pick us up praise the lord i mean that's that's that's our place just like how rebecca how to water those candles amen pulling water from the well not just turning the top on and going to play on her phone she was pulling water out of the well she needed to get some muscles to be able to feel those uh candles and get them to drain and even store water for the joining back home praise the lord that's the place of the church we must come clap our hands lift our hands up lift our voices to worship and sing to god praise the lord amen because our attitude in worship shows how much we are prepared for the world if you come singing and slumbering and and knocking your hands and your spirit is all over your mind thinking about everything you are not ready for the word what you would what are you doing is that you are punishing the preacher you are punishing the preacher because you're coming he's got to be all over the place so nervous because the atmosphere is now right the minds of the people are all scattered about songs is not just singing hymns it's communication you got to get a hold of the people you are leading the people in the presence of god it's not just passing saying kingdom number four let's just sing no you are leading these people before the tune of grace praise the lord don't be like me singing and missing all the words praise the lord the very same beast the same animal that she water praise the lord you see that's the reason why after the preaching of the world we must water the beast we must praise him we must say thank you lord for your word so when we are singing hymns and we are worshiping after the services is now to play down the world that's what the scriptures command us to do brother branham says we must water the world with praise that's how you water the word with praise you lift your hands up and say lord thank you for your word that has come to us father thank you for the holy spirit dealing with my heart when we sing victory this mind you say lord yeah your word brought victory tonight so victory is mine i don't know how much victory we have when we vader it is mine victory is mine praise the lord amen you're actually showing something different from what you are confessing people with victory are people that shout that strain that rejoice so the same base that we water will be the same power that will take us off from here praise the lord the bride is not leaving from here with side faces praise the lord we're not leaving from here we side faces with we head hanging down and our mouth open staring no we are leaving from here victorious [Music] praise the lord are we together let's go on a little bit here praise the lord amen the very power animal that she water was the same animal that packed her to see her bridegroom is that right that's what that's that's and what is watering the very power that we are watering now with praises and thanksgiving and glory then power might is the very same holy spirit that will pack us pack us up to see jesus someday look it was in the court of the evening when isaac walked out and some people says what if you see him and he is a real dark juice i don't care what he looks like he's my savior and when the bride sees him it will be love at first sight on rebecca seeing isaac she jumped off her camera and run to meet him it was love at first sight praise the lord when she seen isaac why because of how much eliezer spoke of isaac praise the lord of all the things that eliezer said this was a man that grew up in abraham house as a child he grew up he saw sarah waiting for the promise he knew how many years this was he knew when isaac was a baby this was the eldest the seven in abraham house he was not talking about himself all through the joining he was telling rebecca all about isaac what he likes to eat what he don't likes so when when she saw him he was no longer a stranger praise the lord he was no longer a stranger to to her she knew everything no wonder he could pack her right into her to his mama house are we together now so uh that's that that's that's uh uh uh uh uh uh the important things i want you to watch out tonight are we almost out of time here so you have to realize and just just like we said uh now don't misunderstand me now don't don't misquote me tonight i'm i'm just i'm i'm putting it in a type you know because brother branham lay out here and says uh uh you know when uh the the the church raptured in uh revelation chapter four she's not you know she's not seen again now that that will buy for you in a little bit because revelation chapter five comes up and says who is walter to take the bulk and to lose the seals now revelation chapter 5 we know that that is the redemption of the church praise the lord amen now so the church does not show up until she comes to her bridegroom in revelation chapter 19 so that's that's the scene i'm trying to play out for you here that uh genesis gave us a similar account the isaac after the experience on the mountain for some reason isaac just disappeared from the text the scripture was said nothing about him again until in chapter 24 verse 63 yeah verse 63 before the bible says and then you know uh rebecca saw the man walking in the field then isaac comes back on the scene and this time it is with his bride praise the lord but in chapter 4 chapter 24 now we're open with abraham instructing his seven to go and get a bride but also the name of the seven will not be mentioned in the text why because on a time he's representing the holy spirit he's representing the comforter amen that is going that has been working through the church ages to get a bride to get christ a bride sign sign of this time and uh that's a true seven of god always is obedient to his master see not to show off or say something to to elect somebody else he said but be earnest and truth to him that sent him that's the true seven of christ like elijah a representative coming from abraham to pick up the bride to isaac the beautiful rebecca obedient the more than seven he was about the master's business alone what a type of the holy spirit today the same thing picking picking out a bride in the evening time when the lights are going out praise the lord amen he was an obedient seven he was an earnest heaven even messenger brother branham said eliezer wasn't speaking of himself but he was speaking all the one he was sent from and he had the gifts to prove that he was saved from him praise the lord because he never just underwent with candles he went with gifts praise the lord because the bible says he gave rebecca gifts he brought gifts to the church praise the lord amen and you know why why he brought gifts to the church because he don't want you to be a bench warmer [Laughter] he wants for each and every one of you to have something to do that's why he brought gifts to the church so we can all have something to do praise the lord we can all be worshipers we can all be singers we can all praise the lord hallelujah glory be to god amen preaching at the back of the pulpit is not the only gift praise the lord singing special playing music bringing a prayer warrior praise the lord he had a gift to proof that he was sent just one more lord he said eleazar sweated it out till he found character in rebecca because he was not just going to take any kind of a girl so he lay out some strong condition one that would come without me asking that we have a desire to do something without me asking that's why eliezer said without me asking why because he won the same holy spirit that was dealing with his heart must also be able to deal with the heart of the people now waiting to be told and waiting to be back he said lord without me asking if any young woman would come and be willing to give me water to drink praise the lord now only be interested in giving me water to drink but also to water my camels because every young woman might be attracted to a stranger where are you coming from where are you going are you hungry and then i have no thought to think about there was a camera that wrote this man out of this way elaiza sweated it out till he found character in rebecca then he had to get her dress up that was some of the work of eleazar that is some of the work of the holy spirit amen he had to take our wallet desires away amen our wallet ambitions away and get us dressed up for our bridegroom praise the lord do you know that rebecca was a gentile bride oh yeah she was a gentile bride you know that eve was a gentile bride she was a gentile bride sure oh praise the lord amen glory be to god i'll say the same two to brother wow amen hallelujah that's when the holy spirit strikes you that's why you do you say wow glory be to god amen he sweated it out then he had to dress her up ready let her stand still and listen to his message stop the too much talking rebecca if you annoy about isaac you must listen praise the lord you don't have no idea where are you going you don't have no idea what are you arguing about praise the lord your opinion does not matter this time rebecca praise the lord she had to stand still enlist him praise the lord and say speak my lord your seven listen that's the word that's the way the bride that's the way the believer of this hour must do learn to listen to the holy spirit dealing with you in the simplest thing can you be able to say yes the lord told me yes oh he spoke to my heart yes yes yes praise the lord we're living in an age this this the the climax of this laodicean age is an age of defiant that no matter what you tell them they are not ready to listen this age mind is already made up praise the lord amen their mind is already made up they are going to do whatever they want to do they will change their gender they will dress whatever way they want to dress they will cast god in the face it's an age of defined it's not an age that's ready to listen it's not an age that i want to know what god says in his word how can we get ready for this rapture this age is not concerned about it right praise the lord how can we grow in the grace of god how can we get closer to this age is not interested in it it's an age whose mind is already made up and they're going to do whatever they want to do praise the lord they can sit under the preaching of the world you can yell you can strain you can yell when their mind is made up they are not ready to listen it's a spirit that's the reason why brother branham want us not to allow this last day spirit to come upon you it's a no ar spirit they know the word they know the scripture they read their bible what are you going to tell them well easier sweaty out he's sweaty out oh no doubt there was a lot of girls that came around it's always like that when a stranger comes to town all the young ladies want to know where he came from praise the lord some come to tease him some come to ask him question praise the lord they all comes with different different motives and different things well lae's are hard to be still praise the lord he had to be still if god of my father abraham if the lord god of my master abraham just thinking about how long that abraham had to wait for isaac so eliza was not in hurry if abraham waited 25 years for isaac he's ready to wait 25 years to get a bribe praise the lord he waited 25 years for isaac why you are being hurried why should i get a bribe overnight right praise the lord do you see why we have to go through this it's because our eliezer the holy ghost is sweating it out to be able to get a people with character not not a people that just say i'm in the message praise the lord not just to slip on the identification within the message i mean the message i baptized in jesus name and no a people with character what kind of a character the character of the word amen eliezer had to sweat it out he had to get her dress up praise the lord take out all these different uh uh uh uh wally faction i was just listening to brother branham as i was coming he was just talking about uh uh uh uh hollywood how how how you know hollywood and and the new thing that hollywood has brought to the world amen what a curse that hollywood is and and and all the felt that they have brought to the world he says we used to go to paris but now the whole world comes to us to now come and take our filth praise the lord let us stand up and listen at his message the trouble of it today when you find character is hard to make them stand still enough to put on clothes and get dressed and get dressed up that's right praise the lord amen desperation he says eliza got desperate when a responsibility was placed upon him to hunt a bride for isaac eliza of damascus was a great man he was favored by abraham and he was trusted by abraham to go out and hunt the bride a right type of a bride for his son isaac praise the lord jesus is when the spirit of truth will come he won't talk about himself praise the lord what about my life will benefit you we must talk about our bridegroom we must talk about the one that is wanted to be talked about praise the lord the love of our soul the one that had redeemed us by his own blood the one that paid the price the one that loves us so much so much he's the one that matters amen he's the one that matters when ella is a god elizabeth i mean rebecca attention and now she could focus she did not stop asking eliezer what the isaac like eating praise the lord amen let's read chapter 24. verse 63 and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening time and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming and rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she left it off the camel praise the lord do you realize that isaac was looking up for his bride and rebecca was also looking up for her bridegroom praise the lord amen he was in the field meditating looking through the promises and looking onto the altar and the finisher of our faith praise the lord we have to lift up our eyes up unto the hills we're coming our help praise the lord amen looking for your bridegroom
