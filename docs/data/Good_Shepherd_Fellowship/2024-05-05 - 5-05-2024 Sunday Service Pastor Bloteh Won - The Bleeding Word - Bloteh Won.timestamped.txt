[53:26] and I thank the Lord that that cup has
[53:28] pass over
[53:31] me
[53:34] um one thing with this church is that I
[53:38] want to appreciate you
[53:41] all I would rather want to bring a
[53:45] testimony and just give a little word of
[53:50] exhortation then I will hand over the
[53:52] pit to the pastor
[53:58] like the the Pastor
[54:01] said since we get to know one another
[54:05] 2003 we have strike a
[54:08] bond because I see in him a true gentle
[54:12] man of
[54:13] God a man that is so
[54:17] sincere and if you know me I love people
[54:21] that give regard to the
[54:22] word you become my friend
[54:27] because all that I do is I want to know
[54:30] God
[54:31] more and it's going to be a strength to
[54:34] me then I'm going to draw you closer and
[54:37] I'm going to honor you respect your
[54:41] office and be
[54:44] everything a lot of good standing
[54:47] Ministers of the world in Nigeria my
[54:51] close
[54:51] friends till some people will think that
[54:55] I'm also a reverend
[54:57] and I said well I'm not a reverend I'm
[54:59] just a little servant of the Lord
[55:03] serving the post of a
[55:05] deacon and like the prophet says
[55:08] sometimes you see though the Deacon have
[55:11] voted for or elected by the pastor
[55:14] nominated for the
[55:16] church but he more stter than the
[55:18] pastor's office right I hope you believe
[55:23] that Pastor is Pastor you have some
[55:26] compassion he will have some things but
[55:29] you see the decking are stet by the word
[55:32] it's either you line up or like we he in
[55:36] the world this morning in the Sunday
[55:39] School the prophet said if the children
[55:41] are not behaving
[55:43] well and uh you can't get them to behave
[55:46] in the church you keep them at
[55:49] home they going to become Rudy is two
[55:53] things the parent are also not lining of
[55:55] the children that maybe the parent also
[55:57] need
[55:58] discipline on that point you see the
[56:00] being coming hard and sometimes
[56:04] a lot of people will love their pastor
[56:05] but they hate the
[56:08] decking but uh it's a thing that we we
[56:13] we are used to like the uh Pastor said
[56:17] I've been a dick now going to 22
[56:20] years and uh I'm a
[56:25] young old
[56:28] man you know when B BR passed 50 he said
[56:33] I'm getting old I'm 25 *
[56:36] 2 so if some of us in some days time
[56:40] I'll be 55 years so that means that we
[56:44] be coming up
[56:46] good now but you see in
[56:50] 20
[56:52] 12 I was doing some consult working
[56:55] somewhere in in
[56:57] Nigeria then this sickness just came and
[57:00] strike me I don't know where I
[57:03] from then it took me to the point of
[57:07] death I was almost
[57:10] dying uh I didn't know that uh people
[57:14] were just ping me
[57:16] up even my wife sometimes she would go
[57:20] to somewhere to cry that this man is
[57:24] going and um
[57:27] I have a brother in us when he felt this
[57:30] the the level of the sickness he asked
[57:34] me to come down so we came
[57:37] down but one thing is that I've been
[57:40] joining this church
[57:42] services since uh
[57:44] 2012 I I screen your service and I know
[57:48] that you people are always praying for
[57:51] me so I'm a testimony that God answer
[57:55] your prayer amen
[57:57] that I'm
[58:00] here I'm
[58:02] standing you know my younger brother
[58:04] just sent prayer requests everywhere
[58:06] everywhere in Nigeria people are
[58:09] praying and
[58:12] um then I
[58:14] was the pastor visited me when I was in
[58:17] Texas December
[58:19] 2013 he came to spend good six days with
[58:23] me encouraging and praying along
[58:26] and um I think 2014 was my first time to
[58:31] just come and say in my sickness I came
[58:34] manag to come and say hello to you
[58:37] people and that's well I started knowing
[58:39] some
[58:40] people
[58:42] um and um I appreciate God for his grace
[58:47] upon you people's life I'm thanking God
[58:50] to see people still standing for the
[58:53] world uh it's not an easy thing to stand
[58:56] for this message I'm telling you the
[58:59] pressure out there is so
[59:03] strong the pressure to make men to
[59:08] fall to
[59:10] derail from the principle of this world
[59:13] is so
[59:15] strong and that's why if you are married
[59:19] you need to pray for one
[59:22] another if your wife is working your
[59:24] husband is working
[59:26] there are theor out there who are ready
[59:30] to ensure that they
[59:33] fail but what keep all of us in the
[59:37] world is when you have a Praying
[59:41] partner one that you can trust your life
[59:45] with husband should able to trust his
[59:48] life to his wife wife should be able to
[59:50] trust his life to the
[59:52] husband and say the best prayer partner
[59:56] is your wife but once said get a prayer
[59:59] partner the first best prayer partner is
[1:00:02] your wife then as your wife you can look
[1:00:05] for some brothers too that you f or
[1:00:07] sisters that you feel they are strong by
[1:00:09] the word and say let us be holding
[1:00:13] ourself in
[1:00:15] prayer and uh one thing that the prophet
[1:00:19] said is that which I was sharing with
[1:00:22] the pastor is that the danger of sin is
[1:00:25] with our
[1:00:28] children the the way we come to the
[1:00:34] Lord majority of them are not seeing
[1:00:37] that
[1:00:38] way maybe because they did not suffer
[1:00:42] for
[1:00:45] it you know some of us are Pentecostal
[1:00:49] some of us
[1:00:51] were in the Orthodox Churches some of us
[1:00:54] were in the white government
[1:00:57] churches I'm a a d person I was a
[1:01:01] Methodist and a white government church
[1:01:03] back in
[1:01:04] neria until the Lord come across my
[1:01:08] way and I will tell you when I believe
[1:01:10] this message I suffer for
[1:01:13] it the parents will stand against
[1:01:17] you the fact you are bringing some odd
[1:01:21] doctrines some odd
[1:01:23] belief maybe they F that is an i they
[1:01:26] expect you to be and the way you are
[1:01:29] going you may not likely meet up with
[1:01:32] that but I always tell people it is God
[1:01:36] that hold that not man believeing the
[1:01:40] Lord doesn't say you're going to be
[1:01:41] poor believe in the Lord
[1:01:44] says the Lord will care for
[1:01:49] you the Lord will care for
[1:01:51] you and uh I'm going to encourage our
[1:01:55] children
[1:01:57] said when you come to Christ before
[1:02:00] 21 nobody can DeRay you from this
[1:02:05] message children there is a blessing
[1:02:09] serving the
[1:02:11] lord there is a blessing obeying your
[1:02:16] parent is the only Commandment that come
[1:02:20] with a
[1:02:22] promise don't say because you started
[1:02:25] growing up
[1:02:26] you started having features like mommy
[1:02:28] or daddy so you f they talk I can
[1:02:32] talk
[1:02:34] no humble thyself because one day you're
[1:02:38] also going to grow up to Bear children
[1:02:43] and you will you if you feel the pain of
[1:02:45] Disobedience from children you will
[1:02:47] always remember that I did that to my
[1:02:53] parents so please humble
[1:02:59] thyself in the message he said go
[1:03:03] tell go tell he preached that message go
[1:03:07] tell he said we have to
[1:03:10] run God had to send a
[1:03:12] messenger for us with a message for us
[1:03:16] to tell the
[1:03:18] word and luckily for us is that God send
[1:03:21] a messenger to us in this
[1:03:23] age every day I leave I I want to than
[1:03:26] the Lord I used to tell my son I said do
[1:03:28] you know why I believe this message two
[1:03:30] things is this if I want to see a
[1:03:33] sincere
[1:03:34] Prophet I've not seen one like William
[1:03:39] Braham the only way we believe him more
[1:03:41] is that the despite that is a prophet he
[1:03:45] doesn't hide his
[1:03:47] mistake it doesn't hide his
[1:03:49] errors he say it right while
[1:03:53] preaching so to such a man will honor
[1:03:55] him
[1:03:56] him I believe him
[1:03:59] more say you understand me and I said
[1:04:01] there is nobody that preached this word
[1:04:05] as close to this word of God as that M
[1:04:09] this
[1:04:11] message so if this message go to see us
[1:04:14] through we have to stand by it we have
[1:04:16] to make it the
[1:04:18] absolute and everywhere we go we must go
[1:04:21] with a message to let people know that
[1:04:25] Christ is is
[1:04:26] rising he is not
[1:04:29] dead and how would they know that his
[1:04:31] reison is Not Dead by our life by our
[1:04:34] testimony by the way we perceive
[1:04:38] everybody uh around the
[1:04:41] home yes and uh we leave to testify in
[1:04:47] the place of walk among our friends
[1:04:49] among our people let us go tell with a
[1:04:53] worthy life that Christ is
[1:04:57] alive he's not dead may the Lord bless
[1:05:01] you as I hand over the propy to the
[1:05:04] pastor I want to say thank you once
[1:05:06] again please keep me in your prayers I'm
[1:05:09] truly recovering I'm getting better by
[1:05:12] the day and I know I'm going to be fully
[1:05:15] better a but I'm getting stronger but I
[1:05:18] rely on your prayers I rely on your

[1:05:25] this envir environment I love you

[1:05:31] getting to know but I believe that the
[1:05:35] Lord T is coming we continue to see but
[1:05:38] the Lord decide to call us I told my
[1:05:40] children I'm not afraid to die though I
[1:05:44] pleaded with the Lord that please give
[1:05:45] me more 20 or 30 years to spend but it's
[1:05:49] in the will of the Lord that's our
[1:05:51] desire but the Lord owns it but if he
[1:05:54] call us today where will you make Christ
[1:05:57] so that's why we must leave as if he's
[1:05:59] coming tomorrow but said plan your life

[1:13:11] our our access to the blood what
[1:13:13] actually is the
[1:13:16] blood Revelation chapter 1 reading from
[1:13:19] verse 4 John to the seven churches which
[1:13:22] are in Asia Grace be unto you you in
[1:13:25] peace from him which is which was and
[1:13:30] which is to come and from the seven
[1:13:34] spirits which are before his throne
[1:13:38] praise the
[1:13:40] Lord and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:13:45] faithful
[1:13:47] witness and the first begotten from the
[1:13:52] dead and the prince of the Kings of the
[1:13:56] earth unto him that love us and wash us
[1:14:02] from our
[1:14:03] sins in his own
[1:14:07] blood praise the
[1:14:09] Lord unto him that love us and wash us
[1:14:13] from our
[1:14:14] sins in his own blood and have made us
[1:14:19] Kings and Priests unto God and his
[1:14:23] father to him be glory and Dominion
[1:14:26] forever and ever and the church says
[1:14:30] amen amen father we have read your word
[1:14:35] we'll be reading more portion of your
[1:14:37] word Lord but we want to ask the
[1:14:39] blessings now for speaking and for
[1:14:42] hearing help us Lord Jesus in your
[1:14:45] wonderful name we pray amen amen while
[1:14:49] you sit in your seat let's turn to
[1:14:50] Ephesian chapter
[1:14:53] 5 Ephesians chapter to
[1:15:10] 5 praise the Lord
[1:15:32] Ephesian chapter
[1:15:50] 5 Ephesians chapter 5 let's read from
[1:15:53] verse 21 just for the
[1:16:03] background
[1:16:05] submitting yourself one to another in
[1:16:08] the fear of God praise the Lord
[1:16:13] submitting yourself one to another in
[1:16:15] the fear of God wife submit yourself
[1:16:19] unto your own husband as unto the Lord
[1:16:22] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:16:24] even as as Christ is the head of the
[1:16:26] church and he is the savior of the body
[1:16:29] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:16:33] Christ so let the wife be to her own
[1:16:37] husband in everything husband love your
[1:16:42] wife even as Christ also loved the
[1:16:45] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:16:49] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:16:53] watching of the Water by the word now
[1:16:57] that's what I was coming to here uh but
[1:17:00] I just had to use that for the
[1:17:02] background because Paul kind of for tied
[1:17:04] these things to Christ giving himself
[1:17:07] and the reason why he gave himself that
[1:17:10] he might stify and cleanse the church
[1:17:13] with the watching of the
[1:17:15] Water by the word that he might present
[1:17:19] it to himself a glorious
[1:17:23] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:17:27] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:17:31] and without blameless
[1:17:34] amen praise the Lord are we
[1:17:38] together amen so do you believe this
[1:17:40] morning that you are
[1:17:42] blameless if you are in this church you
[1:17:44] are blameless you believe that amen do
[1:17:47] you struggle with that in your mind the
[1:17:50] difference here is that you are
[1:17:52] blameless but you are not sinless
[1:17:55] okay okay there's a
[1:17:57] difference as we approach the word you
[1:17:59] will see it because I know that uh the
[1:18:02] word says here he will present the
[1:18:03] church with our spot wrinkle that you
[1:18:06] will be blameless you are blameless but
[1:18:08] we are not
[1:18:10] sinless may God add blessing to the
[1:18:13] reading of his
[1:18:14] word praise the
[1:18:16] Lord amen you love the Lord amen you
[1:18:20] ready for the word amen
[1:18:25] so just like I said we want to look at
[1:18:27] this subject we living in in in such an
[1:18:29] age where we we have all of these uh uh
[1:18:34] the the the chastic movement that have
[1:18:37] that that is birthed out of the
[1:18:39] Pentecostal movement the caram movement
[1:18:42] is actually an impersonation of the
[1:18:45] original Pentecostal movement why I say
[1:18:48] that is because the Pentecostal movement
[1:18:52] was uh the move of God you know when God
[1:18:55] move uh uh and then uh uh uh on Aza uh
[1:19:01] the the Pentecostal Revival where the
[1:19:04] gifts were were birth among the people
[1:19:07] and uh the people really experienc uh a
[1:19:10] move of God and uh now the caras
[1:19:15] movement is trying to repeat what
[1:19:19] happened uh uh what happened back there
[1:19:23] uh uh in the zza street they're trying
[1:19:26] to they're trying to you know repeat
[1:19:29] that or impersonate that that's what
[1:19:32] makes you know uh the movement what it
[1:19:35] is but it has also influenced the church
[1:19:40] in such a
[1:19:41] way that uh we have all of these praying
[1:19:45] groups and all of these you know uh end
[1:19:48] time profets and all of these uh you
[1:19:50] know different movement that we having
[1:19:53] you know what is also dangerous about
[1:19:56] that is that we are having a bunch of
[1:19:59] illegitimate churches when I say
[1:20:01] illegitimate is not in the wrong way
[1:20:03] just follow me is because uh an an an
[1:20:06] illegitimate child is not does not know
[1:20:09] their father so we have a lot of
[1:20:11] churches that cannot Trace themselves to
[1:20:14] their
[1:20:17] origin praise the Lord am it's because
[1:20:21] you know I you know I'm not satisfied
[1:20:23] with what it's happening here I go and
[1:20:25] start my church but I don't have no
[1:20:30] reference every church that is a
[1:20:32] denomination came from
[1:20:36] somewhere praise the Lord the Lutheran
[1:20:39] Church birth out of the the the Luther
[1:20:43] Revival the Methodist westem Church they
[1:20:46] all birth out of uh uh John Wesley
[1:20:49] Revival Baptist came out of John Smith
[1:20:52] Revival Nazar and all of them John
[1:20:54] Kimber and all of these guys that's
[1:20:56] where all of these churches birth
[1:20:58] from but never never a time in the
[1:21:01] history of the world where we have a a
[1:21:05] bunch of more than 1 million plus
[1:21:08] different
[1:21:10] churches that don't know where they came
[1:21:14] from amen amen they are just birth from
[1:21:18] one disagreement
[1:21:25] praise the
[1:21:26] Lord but it's the spirit of the age
[1:21:29] that's not what I want that's not what
[1:21:31] I'm I'm I'm preaching on I I've been
[1:21:33] trying to put some things together and
[1:21:36] and and uh to be able to show uh uh you
[1:21:39] know Church historical facts of uh all
[1:21:42] of where all of these churches are B
[1:21:44] from the men that started this revival
[1:21:47] uh uh the minites came from uh uh minor
[1:21:50] Simon and he started the miniz church
[1:21:53] and and and in order of there praise the
[1:21:57] Lord but this morning we want to look at
[1:22:00] the bleeding word the bleeding word the
[1:22:03] bleeding word I call it the bleeding
[1:22:07] word the one because uh we sing that son
[1:22:10] is dripping with blood is dripping with
[1:22:13] blood this Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping
[1:22:15] with blood praise the Lord the blood of
[1:22:18] the disciples that died for the truth
[1:22:22] amen so it's a bleeding gospel
[1:22:27] it's a bleeding gospel uh uh my redeemer
[1:22:30] live it don't you don't you love him we
[1:22:32] s that uh little some because we believe
[1:22:35] the Holy G gospel is dripping with
[1:22:38] blood uh it is a way of persecution it's
[1:22:42] a way of misunderstanding that's right
[1:22:44] the word don't know it the word never
[1:22:46] knew it the word will hit you but be of
[1:22:50] a good cheer I have overcome the word
[1:22:52] amen they don't understand understand it
[1:22:55] they don't understand it that was one
[1:22:57] thing that Jesus said to Nicodemus
[1:23:00] except a man be born again he shall not
[1:23:03] see the kingdom of God meaning he will
[1:23:06] never understand the principle of what
[1:23:09] God is doing it is not by joining the
[1:23:12] church it's not by reading the all the
[1:23:14] credentials of the church what is
[1:23:16] required of us is the new
[1:23:19] birth without the new birth you will
[1:23:22] never understand God's purpose for your
[1:23:25] life you will never understand how God
[1:23:28] is dealing with you why he's allowing
[1:23:31] you to go through the different things
[1:23:33] that you are going through we will never
[1:23:35] understand
[1:23:37] it praise the
[1:23:41] Lord because you will not be patient
[1:23:44] with God you will not be patient with
[1:23:48] yourself you turn back right to the
[1:23:50] action of Adam and Eve to find somebody
[1:23:53] to blame for your problem
[1:23:57] right and that's the reason why the new
[1:24:00] birth is important is not joining
[1:24:03] church it's not residing
[1:24:07] creef it's a birth just like when a
[1:24:10] child is
[1:24:12] born and that was the thing that that
[1:24:15] that that that troubled Nicodemus when
[1:24:17] Jesus talk about a new birth because he
[1:24:20] knows a birth is to come out of
[1:24:23] something
[1:24:25] so he said do I need to go back into my
[1:24:29] mother's womb and that's what many
[1:24:31] people are doing going back into their
[1:24:33] old
[1:24:34] system
[1:24:38] right and there is no way you can go
[1:24:40] back
[1:24:41] either are we
[1:24:43] together Jesus says you have to be born
[1:24:46] again because what is born of the flesh
[1:24:48] is of flesh but what is born of the
[1:24:50] spirit is of spirit
[1:24:57] and that's the only way we can be able
[1:24:58] to understand what God is uh is dealing
[1:25:03] with our life praise the
[1:25:06] Lord are we together praise the Lord you
[1:25:10] just think about this you read the book
[1:25:11] of
[1:25:12] Job one of the oldest book of the
[1:25:18] Bible his voice of of mind is still
[1:25:22] bad taking medication for that actually
[1:25:25] thing in mind so he just making my whole
[1:25:27] throat dry but I'm getting better amen
[1:25:31] I'm getting
[1:25:35] better and
[1:25:40] uh yeah you read the book of job as the
[1:25:43] oldest book of the Bible and you find
[1:25:46] that uh uh job is caught into a trial
[1:25:52] that he didn't know the Bible set a
[1:25:56] scene very well to let us to know that
[1:25:59] uh uh Satan was bragging on
[1:26:03] job that there is no man on the
[1:26:06] earth and and and Satan was uh bragging
[1:26:10] on job telling the devil there is
[1:26:13] nothing you can do to this man that will
[1:26:15] make me to curse make him to curse me
[1:26:18] amen job never knew about it it would
[1:26:21] have been so easy for job if he knew
[1:26:23] what was going on on and that is the
[1:26:25] same way with you and myself lot of the
[1:26:27] things that we go through we don't know
[1:26:29] what is we think we know what is
[1:26:31] happening we we like to make ourself
[1:26:34] believe that we know what is happening
[1:26:37] right praise the Lord but uh we don't
[1:26:40] know what is
[1:26:42] happening if we if we believe that our
[1:26:44] life is in the hands of God then we must
[1:26:47] believe that he has a plan that is far
[1:26:50] beyond what we can think about
[1:26:52] amen praise
[1:26:54] Lord so you go the The Book of Job
[1:26:57] brings us a a complete drama of
[1:27:02] how little we know of what we are
[1:27:05] dealing with and we go through all all
[1:27:08] the turo and all the struggle just at
[1:27:11] the end for God to help job to seiz that
[1:27:14] this is something that was written from
[1:27:16] the foundation of the word where were
[1:27:18] you when the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:27:21] and their names were put on the L Book
[1:27:22] of Life so so yeah so we want to look at
[1:27:26] the we want to look at this subject this
[1:27:29] morning about the the bleeding word we
[1:27:32] want to talk more about the blood oh the
[1:27:36] blood of
[1:27:37] Jesus Amen oh the blood of Jesus it
[1:27:41] wases white as
[1:27:44] snow
[1:27:47] Hallelujah I I I will read something yet
[1:27:50] and I will give you the background of
[1:27:51] Faith this is from the fourth seal
[1:27:54] and
[1:27:56] uh the mysterious rather watch what he
[1:28:00] does now OPP pause refuse to repent and
[1:28:05] to go
[1:28:06] back to the original blood
[1:28:11] word the word become blood and
[1:28:18] flesh now that's where I'm taking my
[1:28:20] inspiration
[1:28:22] from you see because the early church
[1:28:26] when
[1:28:27] Jesus introduced the
[1:28:30] communion to the Ed Church to the
[1:28:34] disciples and he says take this bread he
[1:28:37] blessed it broke it take this bread eat
[1:28:39] this is my
[1:28:40] flesh amen do it in remembrance of me
[1:28:44] take this cup he bless the wine he give
[1:28:46] it to them drink this is my blood of the
[1:28:49] New Covenant do this in remembrance of
[1:28:52] me the disciple
[1:28:54] did it they kept it in the book of Acts
[1:28:57] the Bible say they went from house to
[1:28:59] house breaking bread and and all to the
[1:29:03] disciples the early church when they did
[1:29:06] that when they had communion it was a
[1:29:09] way of remembering the Lord amen it was
[1:29:13] a way of remembering the suffering he
[1:29:15] went through it was a way of remembering
[1:29:18] the price that he paid but when calm
[1:29:22] took over the church
[1:29:27] amen they changed the
[1:29:31] formula to give the church The
[1:29:37] Authority they changed the
[1:29:39] formula and they make the church to
[1:29:43] believe that the bread is not a
[1:29:48] representation the bread is the literal
[1:29:52] body so the dogma of Catholicism is the
[1:29:57] the priest has the power to change their
[1:30:02] little
[1:30:03] whff to the body of
[1:30:07] Jesus he has the power to change the
[1:30:12] wine to the literal blood of Jesus now
[1:30:16] follow me a little bit that is the
[1:30:18] reason why the
[1:30:20] church draws the people
[1:30:26] because if if the priest have the lital
[1:30:30] blood and he has the Lal body of Jesus
[1:30:34] and you can trust him to tell him of
[1:30:38] everything that you are doing yeah amen
[1:30:42] and he can tell you that you are
[1:30:45] forgiven your sin is
[1:30:47] Forgiven it's a very strong
[1:30:52] Dogma it's a very very strong docma if a
[1:30:55] man has the power to change this water
[1:31:00] as I'm holding this water in my hands
[1:31:02] and I pray over it right now it turned
[1:31:05] to the tears of
[1:31:09] Jesus I'm trying to grab you to
[1:31:12] something amen if a man have the power
[1:31:15] to do that why more can he not do
[1:31:21] right praise the Lord amen
[1:31:25] why more can he not do so you see the
[1:31:29] church capture the
[1:31:33] people that's the reason why they put
[1:31:36] the authority in the church and not in
[1:31:40] the
[1:31:43] word in the word the bread and the blood
[1:31:48] is just a representation right right
[1:31:51] it's not literal it's just representing
[1:31:54] that's what the Bible says but the
[1:31:56] church said no we have the
[1:32:00] power to change it from being L to be
[1:32:05] the
[1:32:06] actual right praise the Lord so if you
[1:32:10] can have the if you can have access to
[1:32:13] the actual blood and body of Jesus every
[1:32:17] Sunday you come to church you tell the
[1:32:19] priest I just told I lied I I I slept I
[1:32:24] commit adultery you come he says okay my
[1:32:27] son my the Lord be with you the Lord
[1:32:31] bless you and he gave it to you and he
[1:32:33] says your sin is
[1:32:36] Forgiven amen if you have that
[1:32:41] Avenue to to to take the lital blood and
[1:32:45] be cleansed every Sunday won you go be
[1:32:48] cleansed every Sunday the rest of the
[1:32:50] week you can live any way you want to
[1:32:52] live you can you can drink you can live
[1:32:55] any life suay just go stay behind that
[1:32:59] little bus tell the priest this is what
[1:33:03] I have
[1:33:07] done praise the
[1:33:09] Lord there is no power of
[1:33:12] regeneration right there is nothing to
[1:33:15] change you
[1:33:18] right you can never get out of your
[1:33:21] habits you can never be delivered
[1:33:26] M what is the need of being
[1:33:30] delivered praise the
[1:33:39] Lord and I just don't want to go into it
[1:33:43] but uh uh uh the church has committed a
[1:33:47] lot of
[1:33:49] atrocities on De
[1:33:52] yeah on that that power of changing a
[1:33:57] wher to the actual body of Jesus and the
[1:34:01] wine to the blood of
[1:34:04] Jesus if a man can do that then you can
[1:34:07] never see no wrong in that man if he has
[1:34:11] the power to change that then what wrong
[1:34:13] can he
[1:34:16] do do you see why the the the church has
[1:34:19] allowed its leaders to go with our
[1:34:23] question questioning them what wrong can
[1:34:26] he do
[1:34:35] then are we together
[1:34:41] am but we just read in Revelation
[1:34:44] chapter 15 Jesus the Bible says I will
[1:34:47] come back to that I just want to set uh
[1:34:51] I just want to set a place here because
[1:34:54] uh uh
[1:34:59] uh if we don't if we don't pay attention
[1:35:02] we find ourself under under the
[1:35:06] influence of our age doing the same
[1:35:09] thing that the you know the religious
[1:35:11] spirit of our age is doing and we think
[1:35:13] that we are in in in line with God's
[1:35:16] word so just like I said you have this
[1:35:19] uh saying all over the place you know I
[1:35:21] I wash myself in the blood of Jesus you
[1:35:23] know uh uh you know I was talking to
[1:35:26] someone and uh you know they were
[1:35:29] sharing you know somebody was giving
[1:35:31] them you know some you know some advice
[1:35:34] some spiritual advice you know Prophet
[1:35:36] it and say this thing that is happening
[1:35:38] to you you know you got to you got to
[1:35:39] you need to really concentrate yourself
[1:35:41] you need to you so go and byy a drink uh
[1:35:46] is a is a kind of for Rik drink a GP
[1:35:49] like drink uh uh vento go and buy vento
[1:35:52] is the blood of Jesus putting the water
[1:35:55] pray over
[1:35:57] it by vent pray over
[1:36:01] it that's the same thing that the priest
[1:36:03] is doing right when you pray over it it
[1:36:07] tend to the blood of
[1:36:09] Jesus then you pull it inside your
[1:36:11] behaving
[1:36:13] water
[1:36:15] that's that's being
[1:36:19] ritualistic right it's not scriptural
[1:36:23] right
[1:36:27] it's not
[1:36:30] scriptural now let me let me grab your
[1:36:33] attention when Jesus said take this my
[1:36:37] blood he had not shared his blood
[1:36:41] yet it was just before his blood was
[1:36:45] shared amen so if he actually needed the
[1:36:49] church to get his literal blood he would
[1:36:51] say Peter James and John I will be
[1:36:55] crucified you take
[1:36:59] buckets when I nail on the cross I'm not
[1:37:03] I'm not playing fun I want you to grab
[1:37:05] what I'm going if I'm nail on the cross
[1:37:08] you'll put those buckets under the cross
[1:37:11] because you will need the blood
[1:37:15] right if he if he want us to have his
[1:37:19] lital blood yes right he will have have
[1:37:23] told
[1:37:24] him he will not take h h h uh wine and
[1:37:31] says this is my blood
[1:37:34] right he's saying this is my blood in
[1:37:37] the sense of
[1:37:40] representation
[1:37:45] right praise the lord it's in the sense
[1:37:49] of
[1:37:50] representation the reason is because
[1:37:57] the L of
[1:38:00] blood was not what was needed right are
[1:38:06] we
[1:38:07] together even when we go over to the the
[1:38:11] Old
[1:38:12] Testament where the Bible would tell
[1:38:17] us of
[1:38:20] why the the the Old Testament Saints
[1:38:25] were keeping the blood sacred it was not
[1:38:28] because of the literal chemical
[1:38:32] blood it was because of the
[1:38:36] life that was in the
[1:38:39] blood praise the Lord let me help you
[1:38:42] another word
[1:38:45] again if I need blood
[1:38:50] transfusion they will not just take any
[1:38:54] blood
[1:38:56] no every blood is good but they will not
[1:39:00] take why do they look for blood
[1:39:04] type is because it's a
[1:39:07] Lifeline right praise the
[1:39:11] Lord Brother brother Jordan is back
[1:39:13] there he's the
[1:39:15] chemist he's the man that is always
[1:39:17] testing looking at blood and all of
[1:39:20] that is because it's a bloodline
[1:39:24] it has a life there's a life in that
[1:39:27] blood that will help
[1:39:29] me if my blood type is
[1:39:33] not good as yours or is it cannot be
[1:39:36] compatible to yours they will not give
[1:39:38] it even though my blood is not bad
[1:39:42] right are you getting the picture so it
[1:39:45] is not just the blood it's the life that
[1:39:48] is in the
[1:39:50] blood without the life the blood God is
[1:39:54] useless that's
[1:39:58] right praise the Lord
[1:40:03] amen and that is the reason why also
[1:40:06] when we are
[1:40:07] sick and after the doctor you have told
[1:40:10] the doctor everything my head is hurting
[1:40:12] and and sometime I feed it on this side
[1:40:14] and and and this other side and you
[1:40:16] finish saying everything he sitting down
[1:40:17] there he's listening to
[1:40:19] you then he send those uh those uh uh
[1:40:23] how do they call them they com in those
[1:40:26] guys with the needles that can suck
[1:40:29] blood they come and poke you and pull
[1:40:32] some blood why are they doing
[1:40:35] it they want to go and look at your life
[1:40:38] it read the
[1:40:42] blood
[1:40:44] amen they go and look at your life they
[1:40:47] go and read your book they are reading
[1:40:49] your book of life right
[1:40:54] are you see are you getting the
[1:40:56] picture so the blood is not is not all
[1:41:00] about the chemical right what makes the
[1:41:03] blood valuable is the life
[1:41:08] amen that is in the
[1:41:13] blood are we
[1:41:17] together that's the reason why even with
[1:41:20] people that donate blood and and all of
[1:41:22] that when those Bloods are are being
[1:41:25] donated they extract them quickly and
[1:41:28] put it to a place where they can
[1:41:29] preserve it because it has to be a
[1:41:31] living
[1:41:34] blood they just don't set it down there
[1:41:36] for for 2 three hours then they take it
[1:41:38] and go and put it in somebody it's a
[1:41:40] dead blood right they take it quickly
[1:41:43] they go and preserve it because what
[1:41:46] they want is the
[1:41:51] life without the life in the blood is
[1:41:54] just another color
[1:41:59] water are we together are you seeing the
[1:42:04] picture
[1:42:09] amen so you
[1:42:16] see okay I I wanted to read something
[1:42:19] here to you before I move
[1:42:20] further and uh
[1:42:23] you love the Lord amen I sure you do or
[1:42:26] else you won't be here this
[1:42:28] morning praise the
[1:42:33] Lord Exodus chapter 17:1 the Bible says
[1:42:37] for the life of the flesh is in the
[1:42:41] blood and I have given it to you upon
[1:42:45] the altar to make an atonement for the
[1:42:48] soul the life of the flesh is in the
[1:42:52] blood
[1:42:53] praise the
[1:42:56] Lord yeah that it looks like I'm
[1:42:58] becoming the doctor this
[1:43:00] morning but uh uh uh when your blood is
[1:43:04] reduc reducing they can tellar from the
[1:43:06] poorness of your
[1:43:09] flesh they tell from the filling of your
[1:43:12] flesh that this person needs to build
[1:43:15] their blood count because the life of
[1:43:17] the flesh is in the
[1:43:19] blood are we together
[1:43:24] now
[1:43:25] so uh it makes it easier for me when I
[1:43:29] can grab your attention then we can be
[1:43:32] able to seal in this
[1:43:34] thought because uh
[1:43:39] uh when you look at
[1:43:42] uh uh the scriptural pattern the blood
[1:43:48] in the Old Testament was used as a
[1:43:51] substitutionary word
[1:43:53] for the worshipper to approach God
[1:43:56] praise the Lord amen they will come and
[1:43:59] you know uh uh uh sacrifice an animal
[1:44:02] confess their sin and all of that and uh
[1:44:06] and the priests will pray for them they
[1:44:08] would go but the scripture tells us that
[1:44:10] uh uh the life of the animal could never
[1:44:14] come back on the
[1:44:18] worshipper praise the Lord the life that
[1:44:22] was in the blood of that animal could
[1:44:24] never come back on the worshipper
[1:44:26] because the animal do not have a soul
[1:44:29] even though now they have done the first
[1:44:33] they have done the first uh uh uh how do
[1:44:37] they call it a kind of a blending
[1:44:39] genetic surgery where they took the
[1:44:42] kidney of an
[1:44:43] animal and they use it in the
[1:44:47] Hoban praise the Lord it saved your life
[1:44:50] don't don't don't shake your your head
[1:44:54] it save the person's
[1:44:57] life uh they use the kidney of a of a
[1:45:02] peak and uh they did a transplant that
[1:45:05] that's the first one Medical Science has
[1:45:07] ever done and it was
[1:45:09] successful they are watching to see how
[1:45:12] the person will will
[1:45:15] progress are we together
[1:45:19] amen and uh I I don't this is not all
[1:45:23] part of my message I don't know where
[1:45:24] I'm going with all
[1:45:26] days but I'm just trying to bring us to
[1:45:29] the place where we can be able to
[1:45:32] realize that it was all when men
[1:45:37] fell when Adam and he fell in the Garden
[1:45:40] of
[1:45:41] Eden they fell from a
[1:45:46] life amen are we together they fell from
[1:45:50] a
[1:45:51] life because God said the day you eat
[1:45:55] this that day you will
[1:45:58] die so they fell from a
[1:46:02] life and here we are we are finding
[1:46:05] through the scripture that the life is
[1:46:08] in the
[1:46:10] blood amen so
[1:46:14] God creating a substitute to bring man
[1:46:19] back to the life that he has fell from
[1:46:24] give man the way of the blood God
[1:46:27] provided it was God provided way God uh
[1:46:31] uh uh way of substitute to be able to
[1:46:34] bring men back into Fellowship
[1:46:39] right so he gave
[1:46:42] man a sacrificial
[1:46:46] order but realize when they were
[1:46:50] sacrificing they had to Spill the blood
[1:46:53] of the animal but what God was looking
[1:46:56] at was the
[1:46:59] life praise the Lord now that is the
[1:47:02] reason why in the Old Testament worship
[1:47:05] also the animal that was sacrificed was
[1:47:09] not just any kind
[1:47:12] right it had to be
[1:47:15] examined praise the
[1:47:17] Lord it had to be
[1:47:21] examined all of that was God's targeting
[1:47:26] the
[1:47:28] life are we
[1:47:31] together are you beginning to see the
[1:47:34] picture now so uh uh right through right
[1:47:39] through
[1:47:41] time you will see there all through the
[1:47:45] scripture that the
[1:47:48] Bible uses
[1:47:50] light word
[1:47:55] washing
[1:47:56] cleansing
[1:47:59] blood the scripture use it in a uh in in
[1:48:03] a connecting
[1:48:06] way and it's all to be able to give us a
[1:48:09] picture of what of what God was trying
[1:48:13] to
[1:48:19] achieve Jesus says the words that I
[1:48:22] speak unto you you they alive in
[1:48:25] spirit he first told them you are
[1:48:27] cleansed by these words that I speak
[1:48:29] unto
[1:48:31] you David said your word is a light onto
[1:48:35] my
[1:48:37] path so there is there is there is this
[1:48:40] connection and even before we go further
[1:48:44] there you know you see there in first
[1:48:46] John in the beginning was the word the
[1:48:48] word was with God the Word was
[1:48:51] God the same that lighted every man that
[1:48:54] cometh into the word so word light there
[1:48:57] is always that
[1:49:00] connection are we together
[1:49:06] amen so let's go back again to uh
[1:49:09] Revelation chapter
[1:49:15] 1 let's go back to Revelation chapter
[1:49:21] 1 get into what a lot of
[1:49:27] uh I will miss the thing I want to get
[1:49:29] to verse 5 we read earlier and from
[1:49:33] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[1:49:37] the first begotten from the dead the
[1:49:40] prince all the kings of the earth unto
[1:49:44] him that love
[1:49:46] us and watch us from our
[1:49:50] sins in his own
[1:49:54] blood when did he do
[1:49:59] that now you have to realize now this
[1:50:03] Revelation is is is is after Jesus eff
[1:50:08] Ministry okay after Jesus eely ministry
[1:50:12] join on the Outland of pmos Jesus is now
[1:50:15] H uh revealing himself to John and
[1:50:18] talking about the work that he's going
[1:50:20] to do in the future ages and here he's
[1:50:23] introducing himself to John and he says
[1:50:26] I'm the faithful and true witness the
[1:50:28] the
[1:50:29] first the first begotten from the dead
[1:50:34] now so the first begotten from the dead
[1:50:36] speaks of the
[1:50:39] Resurrection amen I'm the first begotten
[1:50:42] from the dead which mean I've already
[1:50:45] resurrected I have ascended on high now
[1:50:48] I have come in the form of the Holy
[1:50:50] Spirit
[1:50:52] are we
[1:50:57] together first begard him from the dead
[1:50:59] the prince of the kings of the earth and
[1:51:01] unto him that love us and wash us from
[1:51:04] our sin in his own
[1:51:06] blood so this is after the resurrection
[1:51:09] and the Ascension and now he's watching
[1:51:12] us in his
[1:51:14] blood where is the
[1:51:19] blood praise the
[1:51:21] Lord what is the blood that he's
[1:51:23] watching us
[1:51:26] in are we
[1:51:29] together what what I'm trying to do here
[1:51:32] for us uh H as a people is to be able to
[1:51:37] understand there the when we say sir I
[1:51:40] rebuke you by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:43] many times our mind goes back to Calvary
[1:51:47] this is after Calvary Jesus is watching
[1:51:50] us in his blood after Calvary yes after
[1:51:53] he have uh uh extended and he has come
[1:51:57] back to the church in the form of the
[1:51:58] holy spirit so we have to now identify
[1:52:01] by
[1:52:06] scripture are we together amen now this
[1:52:09] is John writing here 1 John chapter one
[1:52:11] let's go back to
[1:52:13] John 1 John chapter 1 we we pick that up
[1:52:16] in our beginning series
[1:52:23] 1 John chapter
[1:52:27] 1 are we
[1:52:38] together 1 John chapter 1 let's look at
[1:52:41] verse 6 if we say that we have
[1:52:43] fellowship with him Jesus and walk in
[1:52:46] darkness we lied and do not the truth
[1:52:50] but if we walk in the light
[1:52:54] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[1:52:58] one with
[1:52:59] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:53:03] his son cleanses us from all
[1:53:08] sin praise the Lord this is also after
[1:53:14] Calvary so you see what is happening
[1:53:17] here now our walking in the light
[1:53:20] connect us to Calvary
[1:53:22] you don't have the benefit of Calvary if
[1:53:25] you are not walking in the light right
[1:53:27] you are not connected to
[1:53:31] Calvary if we are not walking in the
[1:53:36] light he watch us from all of our sins
[1:53:40] and here John is saying and and and and
[1:53:43] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:53:47] us from all of our
[1:53:50] sin how does that happen
[1:53:56] when are we watched when are we being
[1:54:02] cleansed are we together so you see the
[1:54:05] thing about a church is that Jesus just
[1:54:09] did not left a slogan with his church
[1:54:12] right that just oh the blood of Jesus
[1:54:15] all the blood of Jesus what is the blood
[1:54:16] of
[1:54:20] Jesus what is that blood
[1:54:28] even many times Serv is out of
[1:54:32] fear that we are shouting all over the
[1:54:34] place the blood of
[1:54:39] Jesus
[1:54:42] Amen now take take this example there in
[1:54:46] Egypt Goan the the night before the
[1:54:49] exodor the children of Israel were
[1:54:51] supposed to kill the
[1:54:53] lamb take the
[1:54:55] blood take a house up and put the blood
[1:54:59] on the LED of the door
[1:55:01] post amen are we
[1:55:05] together there was a a a direct
[1:55:08] instruction that was given to
[1:55:11] them they didn't say paint your whole
[1:55:13] door red no no put the blood on the LED
[1:55:18] of the door post that was the
[1:55:20] instruction yeah
[1:55:23] so if if a person if a parent is afraid
[1:55:26] of the death iner and takes the lme
[1:55:29] blood and just was it on the door is not
[1:55:31] going to help you
[1:55:34] right because you are not following
[1:55:36] their
[1:55:40] instruction the instruction was to put
[1:55:42] the blood on the door of the Len tail
[1:55:44] when I see the blood I will pass over
[1:55:47] you
[1:55:50] yeah praise the Lord
[1:55:53] so even when we apply the blood of Jesus
[1:55:56] there is an instruction of how to apply
[1:55:59] the
[1:56:00] blood you want to apply the blood to
[1:56:03] your family you want to apply the blood
[1:56:05] there is an instruction in the word how
[1:56:08] to imp apply the
[1:56:15] blood are we together praise the
[1:56:20] Lord are you seeing the picture it said
[1:56:22] becoming clearer to you amen so you see
[1:56:27] our our connection to
[1:56:30] Calvary I mean you can travel and go to
[1:56:33] Jerusalem and it take you on on on the
[1:56:36] mountain and you can stand there and and
[1:56:39] and but if you are not walking in the
[1:56:41] light you are not connected to calary
[1:56:43] you can never get the benefit of the
[1:56:46] blood because here John is saying h h h
[1:56:50] uh if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:56:54] the light then we have Fellowship one
[1:56:57] with another then we have access to the
[1:57:04] blood are we together and what is this
[1:57:07] light your word is a light unto my
[1:57:13] path so the word of God for every age
[1:57:17] brings the provision of the blood for
[1:57:20] that age amen
[1:57:25] the word of God for every
[1:57:29] age you can create your own religious
[1:57:32] approach your 12 Day step your 20day
[1:57:35] step fast and pray drive fast hot fast
[1:57:38] wet F whatever you want to do
[1:57:44] right but God has an instruction
[1:57:52] look at what he did in the Garden of
[1:57:54] Eden when he came
[1:57:59] down to restore Adam and Eve back to
[1:58:03] fellowship he took a lamb slay a lamb on
[1:58:06] the east side of
[1:58:08] Eden and the Bible says he robbed them
[1:58:12] Adam Adam took was hiding himself with a
[1:58:14] fake Leaf he took some kind of a Le to
[1:58:17] hide himself that could not please God
[1:58:20] right amen if they will ever be in
[1:58:23] fellowship with God God had to draw them
[1:58:27] and he he had to dress
[1:58:29] them amen and he wrapped them in a
[1:58:33] bleeding
[1:58:35] skin a lime skin that was
[1:58:40] bleeding and that was how he sent them
[1:58:43] out of the Garden of
[1:58:45] Eden because what God will trace the
[1:58:48] step of every dripping blood
[1:58:52] to find where his children has
[1:58:56] gone praise the
[1:59:02] lord it's not just a
[1:59:05] slogan that's that's that's what I want
[1:59:07] for us to
[1:59:09] see if Jesus said this take this my
[1:59:12] blood it's the blood of the New
[1:59:17] Covenant let's look at what Paul says in
[1:59:19] Hebrew quickly
[1:59:23] try to find a place
[1:59:25] here to send you home Hebrews chapter
[1:59:32] 13 are we together
[1:59:41] am Hebrews chapter 313 verse 20 Hebrews
[1:59:46] chapter 13
[1:59:55] now the God of Peace that brought again
[1:59:59] from the dead our lord
[2:00:02] Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep
[2:00:06] through the blood of the Everlasting
[2:00:10] coover
[2:00:12] him
[2:00:14] amen follow the reading closely follow
[2:00:17] the reading now
[2:00:23] now the God of Peace that brought
[2:00:26] again from the dead our lord Jesus
[2:00:30] brought Jesus from the dead are we
[2:00:34] together he's the great Shepherd of the
[2:00:36] sheep brought Jesus from the dead
[2:00:39] through the blood of the Everlasting
[2:00:42] Covenant what was the blood of the
[2:00:44] Everlasting
[2:00:47] Covenant was it the one he Shar on the
[2:00:50] cross
[2:00:54] no it was the one that Jesus gave to the
[2:00:57] church this is my
[2:00:59] blood take it for the new and
[2:01:03] Everlasting
[2:01:05] Covenant so what is Paul saying here
[2:01:09] Paul is saying that uh God brought Jesus
[2:01:14] from the dead by the Covenant that he
[2:01:19] that he Jesus made with the church
[2:01:22] and what they what which Covenant that
[2:01:24] he made with the church what was he
[2:01:26] giving them he was giving them the
[2:01:29] word
[2:01:33] yeah so in one sense Paul is trying to
[2:01:37] say that the the word the word this word
[2:01:41] of
[2:01:42] God has more value before God than even
[2:01:46] the Lal blood
[2:01:53] why because the word is the
[2:01:59] life there will be no need to have a
[2:02:02] Bible if this is not the word of God and
[2:02:05] if God's word is not
[2:02:08] life
[2:02:12] right are we together
[2:02:18] amen I'm saying all of this to be able
[2:02:20] to help us to to see the place where uh
[2:02:24] uh you know the church has put us
[2:02:27] because we can disregard the word of God
[2:02:30] we can disrespect the word of God and
[2:02:33] yet we can still clean the
[2:02:36] blood I cover my family with the
[2:02:39] blood when we are disregarding what
[2:02:41] God's word says
[2:02:46] right praise the Lord
[2:02:49] amen when we are disrespecting the word
[2:02:53] we are dishonoring the word you see that
[2:02:55] is the reason why the church holds its
[2:02:58] place when a man is not living according
[2:03:01] to the standard of the word he must not
[2:03:03] partake of
[2:03:04] communion why because you cannot be
[2:03:06] disregarding the word and you you're
[2:03:08] also part of the ordinance it does not
[2:03:10] work
[2:03:26] the church take these things as a slogan
[2:03:28] the blood the blood the blood the blood
[2:03:30] the blood the blood I plead the blood
[2:03:31] the blood the blood the blood the
[2:03:33] blood right and if we can say it fast
[2:03:38] and we can say it loud then we think we
[2:03:40] have the we have the effect we have the
[2:03:43] benefit of
[2:03:47] it praise the Lord
[2:03:52] if we have the lital blood here where we
[2:03:54] pass it from row to row we all drink the
[2:03:56] lital blood if God not be merciful we we
[2:03:59] will get terminate
[2:04:01] illness
[2:04:05] right because when Jesus shared his
[2:04:08] blood on the cross of Calvary his life
[2:04:11] came back on the DAT of Pentecost as the
[2:04:13] Holy
[2:04:17] Ghost the life that was in the blood
[2:04:19] came back to do what to honor the word
[2:04:23] that joah said I will pour my spirit
[2:04:26] upon your sons and daughters so the life
[2:04:28] came on the word without the word you
[2:04:31] don't have the blood
[2:04:36] right you can stay with your your slogan
[2:04:39] and stay with your uh uh your slank but
[2:04:42] without the word you don't have the
[2:04:44] blood that is as much as we can see in
[2:04:46] the scripture
[2:04:58] how is he watching
[2:04:59] us because that's what Paul says there
[2:05:02] in in
[2:05:04] Ephesian Christ gave himself for the
[2:05:06] church just uh uh so he can sanctify it
[2:05:10] and cleanse it by the watching of the
[2:05:13] Water by the
[2:05:16] word so he watched Us in his blood by
[2:05:19] his word
[2:05:24] when we say Amen to the word when we
[2:05:26] receive the word when we submit to the
[2:05:29] word yes sir then that's when we get the
[2:05:33] watching that's when the word cleanses
[2:05:37] us not just by saying the blood I wash
[2:05:39] my whole family in the blood I bathe my
[2:05:42] children in the
[2:05:45] blood and then we have we don't have one
[2:05:48] regard for the word of God right
[2:05:57] are we together just get a few minutes
[2:06:00] here and I'll let you
[2:06:01] go invisible
[2:06:05] Union think your garment watch by the
[2:06:08] water of the bleeding word the word
[2:06:11] becomes
[2:06:13] blood the word becomes blood let me show
[2:06:15] you another Old Testament type that you
[2:06:17] will
[2:06:19] appreciate when Joseph
[2:06:22] was in
[2:06:24] praising amen you remember that there
[2:06:28] were two praising us with him one was a
[2:06:32] baker and the other one was a cup Bearer
[2:06:35] are we together praise the
[2:06:40] Lord and the both men had
[2:06:44] dreams the baker had a
[2:06:48] dream he baked some bread and and then
[2:06:51] the birds were eating eating over his
[2:06:53] head yeah the the cup Bearer also had
[2:06:58] dream and then he was uh he was serving
[2:07:01] back uh his master and Joseph will
[2:07:04] interpret the
[2:07:05] dream he will interpret the
[2:07:08] dream that
[2:07:11] the the cup Bearer will return back to
[2:07:15] his work he will be saved but the the
[2:07:20] baker will die are we
[2:07:24] together and you see a perfect type of
[2:07:27] Jesus not only with Jesus having two
[2:07:30] teeths on the
[2:07:32] cross praise the Lord but Jesus said the
[2:07:36] bread represent
[2:07:38] what what did he said take this
[2:07:42] bread it represent what my body because
[2:07:47] his body would die
[2:07:52] sure he said take this bread it
[2:07:55] represent my
[2:07:58] body because his body will die
[2:08:03] right and what will benefit the church
[2:08:07] is the blood the cup
[2:08:10] Bearer The Life which comes back on the
[2:08:19] believer are we together
[2:08:22] it's not just the two men but even the
[2:08:25] elements and that that is the thing that
[2:08:27] shows us the importance of communion in
[2:08:31] a local church right I'm making that
[2:08:34] emphasis because we are coming to
[2:08:43] one praise the
[2:08:46] Lord are you seeing the picture
[2:08:55] your gu may watch by water of the
[2:08:57] bleeding word the word becomes blood the
[2:09:00] word bled for you and you are
[2:09:05] watched in the bleeding word it was the
[2:09:09] word that bled for you why was that word
[2:09:12] a virgin shall
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:16] conceive th word that Isaiah spoke th
[2:09:20] word that all the Prophet spoke when bam
[2:09:23] said I see a star out of
[2:09:26] Jacob that word was what bled for you
[2:09:32] yes the church keep our eyes on the man
[2:09:37] Jesus and that's the reason why it's
[2:09:40] hard for us to believe that he's
[2:09:43] here it's easy for us to look back to
[2:09:47] 2,000 years
[2:09:48] ago and it's difficult for us to honor
[2:09:51] that he's
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:56] here praise the Lord because to God his
[2:10:00] word was more value than the Flesh of
[2:10:06] Jesus then the
[2:10:12] body are we
[2:10:15] together let me read this so we can find
[2:10:18] a place to close here the word becomes
[2:10:20] blood the word bled for you and you are
[2:10:24] watched in the bleeding
[2:10:27] word the word bleeding the life of God
[2:10:30] in the word and the Word was bled for
[2:10:35] you that you might be watched from the
[2:10:39] filth of this
[2:10:42] prostitute and be clean and
[2:10:46] Sanctified by the watching of the water
[2:10:50] that makes your mind mind and your heart
[2:10:52] stay on God and on the
[2:10:56] word until we take God's word serious in
[2:10:59] our life will'll be far away from
[2:11:05] regeneration we'll be very far from
[2:11:07] regeneration until we take God word
[2:11:10] serious and not just church
[2:11:14] membership how long I've been in the
[2:11:16] church or how long I I've been serving
[2:11:18] God that does not matter to God
[2:11:21] it does not bring the life back on the
[2:11:23] worshipper the scripture said the the
[2:11:26] worshipper wants
[2:11:33] PCH praise the Lord amen yes the
[2:11:37] bleeding
[2:11:38] word and every time the word is preached
[2:11:42] to you the word is
[2:11:44] bleeding every time it's preached to you
[2:11:47] because it's just like when the Old
[2:11:49] Testament sints went to the Tabernacle
[2:11:52] they had the sprinkling of of of the red
[2:11:55] haer the sacrifice that was that was uh
[2:11:58] that was uh that was killed for the
[2:12:00] people when they confessed their sins
[2:12:02] the arches of the sacrifice was put into
[2:12:05] a
[2:12:06] water and that water was sprinkled on
[2:12:09] the
[2:12:11] people they used the water to sprinkle
[2:12:13] on the people and what it was signifying
[2:12:16] is that the life of this de dead animal
[2:12:20] was the one that's two between you and
[2:12:23] God right it's because this animal give
[2:12:27] his life that's the reason why you have
[2:12:29] a right to live but now we don't have an
[2:12:32] animal we have God himself that took on
[2:12:35] flesh came and give his
[2:12:40] life so every time we sit under the
[2:12:42] preaching of the word is the sprinkling
[2:12:44] of the blood what are you doing with it
[2:12:47] you have the blood of Jesus on Your
[2:12:48] Hands yes
[2:12:51] every time you listen to truth from
[2:12:53] God's word you have the blood of Jesus
[2:12:55] on Your Hands that's the reason why it
[2:12:58] does not benefit me to give you my my my
[2:13:00] idea or my opinion it must come from the
[2:13:02] word if it is not the word I don't have
[2:13:04] nothing to
[2:13:16] say praise the Lord Jesus
[2:13:20] said things that are to be be you
[2:13:24] therefore perfect even as your father in
[2:13:27] Heaven is
[2:13:29] perfect and it is a perfect Kingdom so
[2:13:32] it must be a perfect people come because
[2:13:36] you have to stand before and be married
[2:13:38] to a perfect Son of God you must be a
[2:13:41] perfect bride so how can you do it
[2:13:44] through anything as but the perfect word
[2:13:47] of
[2:13:48] God Amen so that's the place that's
[2:13:52] where I come to say that uh you are
[2:13:54] blameless we are not sinless right this
[2:13:58] the gospel is not to Pro produce uh uh
[2:14:01] sinless Perfection
[2:14:03] no but we are blameless yeah it's common
[2:14:06] it's easy to
[2:14:08] understand praise the
[2:14:11] Lord you bought a shirt a white shirt
[2:14:14] you wore it and you bring bring it back
[2:14:16] for watching it have some steain on it
[2:14:19] you wash it you put it in the bleach
[2:14:21] you bring it out it's clean but it's not
[2:14:25] new
[2:14:28] right it's clean but it's not
[2:14:32] new praise the Lord so don't fall and
[2:14:35] carry back to the
[2:14:38] store don't return it it's clean but
[2:14:42] it's not new right that is the principle
[2:14:46] of sinless and
[2:14:49] blameless but by our birth we were born
[2:14:52] in sin ship in iniquity
[2:14:56] amen by our Birth by our first birth we
[2:14:59] were all born in sin we are honor that
[2:15:01] Lord of Sinner saved by grace yes but
[2:15:05] when we submit ourself to the word of
[2:15:08] God when we come to the Fountain Dream
[2:15:11] from Emmanuel V when we come to the
[2:15:14] fountain that is in the House of David
[2:15:17] that Zachariah said is for every
[2:15:19] uncleanness and we submit ourself to God
[2:15:22] and say Lord yeah I am I'm I'm I'm a
[2:15:25] wretched sinner my mind is dead in my
[2:15:28] heart my desire are filthy cleanse
[2:15:32] me and we can have the courage to take
[2:15:34] God by his word that if we confess our
[2:15:37] sin he's faithful and just to forgive
[2:15:42] us hallelujah what you doing you just
[2:15:45] dropping yourself in the bleach praise
[2:15:47] the Lord praise the Lord you just drop
[2:15:50] put yourself in the bleach and you
[2:15:52] bringing yourself out putting yourself
[2:15:55] in the word using the word to your
[2:15:58] situation not your smartness right it
[2:16:02] will not help you it did not help you in
[2:16:03] the
[2:16:04] beginning if it could help you you don't
[2:16:06] need to be here
[2:16:18] right praise the Lord
[2:16:28] so how we going to be perfect Jesus said
[2:16:30] be perfect even as your heavenly father
[2:16:33] is
[2:16:34] perfect the Perfection is not our
[2:16:39] self-righteousness no we are looking at

[2:25:53] the reason why don't read the word to
[2:25:56] see somebody else or read the word to
[2:25:59] condemn someone else read the word to
[2:26:01] apply that talking to yourself yes

[2:26:09] applying of the
