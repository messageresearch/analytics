[27:42] uh he will he will
[27:46] i wanted to speak on uh on a little
[27:49] thought that i had on my heart and
[27:57] had a little thought on my heart and
[27:59] that's why
[28:00] that song came to mind to mind
[28:04] time is filled with swift
[28:07] transition i will use that first line
[28:11] as a subject to preach on tonight time
[28:15] is filled with swift transition
[28:20] hebrew chapter four
[28:24] hebrew chapter four we read that verse
[28:27] on on sunday
[28:30] really never had a time to get into what
[28:32] we want to share with you but
[28:34] the lord hired us to say something
[28:36] anyway
[28:37] and uh and we we
[28:41] are grateful for that
[28:49] hebrew chapter 4
[28:55] let's turn to our feed we read from
[28:57] verse 9 tonight
[29:04] praise the lord
[29:07] we'll read from verse 9 tonight
[29:12] there remained therefore a rest
[29:16] to the people of god i mean we can close
[29:20] our bible
[29:22] and i'm sure the lord can be able to
[29:24] give us something to just say from that
[29:26] verse i believe that there remaineth
[29:29] a rest to the people of god
[29:32] and that's what we are looking forward
[29:34] to our rest
[29:36] is not in this economy our rest is not
[29:39] in our jobs our our bank account and uh
[29:44] our even in our home we in this in this
[29:47] place we have no continuing city
[29:50] amen but every minute therefore
[29:53] a rest to the people of god
[29:57] for he that entered for for he that is
[30:00] entered into his rest
[30:04] he also has seized
[30:07] from his own work
[30:10] as god did from his
[30:14] so paul is saying here if you are still
[30:17] working trying to make yourself good
[30:23] god will be resting but if you will be
[30:26] resting in god's promise
[30:28] to make you good then god will be
[30:31] working on your behalf
[30:34] praise the lord amen
[30:38] for he that is entered
[30:41] into his rest into god's rest
[30:46] have ceased from his own work if you
[30:49] have entered
[30:50] into god's rest you are resting on the
[30:53] promises
[30:54] of god you are seized from your work
[30:59] amen praise the lord you are not
[31:02] impressing god by your action
[31:07] you are not impressing god to impress
[31:10] god is to say lord i believe you i
[31:13] believe your word
[31:14] be it unto me according to your word
[31:18] praise the lord amen
[31:22] for he that is entered into his rest
[31:26] he has also ceased from his own work as
[31:28] god
[31:29] did from
[31:32] did from haste let us
[31:35] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[31:39] least any man fall after the same
[31:42] example
[31:43] of unbelief for the word of god
[31:47] is quick and powerful and sharper
[31:51] than any two eggs who appears in
[31:54] even to the dividing asunder of the soul
[31:56] and spirit
[31:58] and of the joints and modern and
[32:01] is at the center of the tops
[32:04] and intents of the heart
[32:08] let us pray heavenly father we just want
[32:11] to ask tonight lord your blessing
[32:13] upon this word father we want to find
[32:16] rest in you
[32:17] we want to find rest in you from the
[32:20] things that we are struggling with
[32:22] in our mind the things we are struggling
[32:24] with father
[32:25] in our life in our habits we want to
[32:28] find
[32:29] rest in you father and only you lord
[32:33] can give us that rest that brings
[32:35] satisfaction
[32:37] father we just ask the lord god you will
[32:40] you will bless your word tonight and
[32:42] come father lord and
[32:44] speak to our hearts father in jesus name
[32:47] we pray
[32:48] amen the lord bless you you may have
[32:50] your seed
[32:52] praise the lord amen i'm having
[32:55] i'm having some uh broken notes tonight
[32:58] but
[32:58] i think we will be able to use it praise
[33:01] the lord
[33:02] i would take one year brother branham
[33:04] used that song from hebrew chapter one
[33:06] he was preaching on hebrew series
[33:09] he said time is filled with swift's
[33:11] transition
[33:13] not on earth or move can stand nothing
[33:16] on move on earth can be able to stand
[33:19] with what is happening
[33:20] there your hopes on things in
[33:23] he said let us catch a view of him
[33:28] that unseen one in the midst
[33:32] now praise the lord
[33:36] jesus said wheresoever two or three are
[33:38] gathered
[33:39] he promised that he will be in our midst
[33:41] we believe that
[33:42] amen he says we must we must catch a
[33:46] view of him
[33:48] that unseen one that is in the midst now
[33:50] and
[33:51] just worship him now as we
[33:54] think praise the lord amen
[33:59] so we we want to we want to talk on uh
[34:04] some of the swift transition that is
[34:06] happening
[34:07] in the world i mean things are happening
[34:10] that we have we have uh
[34:13] some of them we have no idea about some
[34:16] of the great
[34:17] changes that is happening in the world
[34:20] that we are living in
[34:21] even in the laws of the land and and
[34:24] uh and all of the things that is
[34:27] happening
[34:28] but tonight uh uh my mind uh
[34:32] mine the inspiration of my heart
[34:35] actually uh is is looking at something
[34:39] a little bit different i'll use this
[34:43] as uh as a stepping stone maybe the law
[34:45] might help us
[34:46] to be able to to to work on it
[34:50] but my mind uh the thought that is on my
[34:54] heart
[34:55] tonight is uh is to talk about
[34:59] just like we started sunday talking
[35:01] about how
[35:02] the word of god is quake
[35:06] praise the lord brother branham in a
[35:09] message
[35:12] that he preached on the developing of
[35:16] signs
[35:17] and speed the countdown
[35:20] brother branham starts to talk about
[35:24] how
[35:27] science was actually
[35:30] reflecting what god was doing
[35:34] spiritually
[35:35] and he took that what actually he was
[35:38] trying to help us to see
[35:40] is to understand the move of god
[35:44] praise the lord god
[35:47] is the inventor of speed
[35:51] god was the first one that took
[35:54] the first speed no one can run faster
[35:57] than god
[35:58] because he's everywhere
[36:02] praise the lord because god is
[36:05] everywhere you can never run faster than
[36:07] him
[36:08] but he was the first one that took the
[36:10] first p
[36:12] and the first speed that god took was to
[36:14] come from eternity to time
[36:20] that was his first speed
[36:23] praise the lord because he's the great
[36:27] internal god that one time failed all
[36:30] time
[36:30] in all space
[36:35] but yet he could condemn himself he
[36:38] could move
[36:40] he could move himself
[36:43] from an internal being to begin what we
[36:47] call
[36:48] time and he did that
[36:52] by a move he did that
[36:55] by speed
[36:58] praise the lord amen
[37:06] and
[37:10] it is so difficult it's so difficult no
[37:14] matter how
[37:15] we try to think it in our mind it's so
[37:18] difficult for us to be
[37:20] able to understand and put together
[37:24] how god moves jesus said in
[37:27] john chapter 3 it's just like the wind
[37:32] he says we feed it amen
[37:35] we feed the moving of the wane you know
[37:38] what is coming from here or there
[37:39] and and and he was just he was just kind
[37:42] of for describing how the spirit moved
[37:44] and in the bible we heard in genesis
[37:46] chapter one that
[37:48] god moved upon the water
[37:52] praise the lord god move
[37:56] upon the water now we all
[38:00] you know uh we we say sir you know when
[38:02] we believe that
[38:04] uh uh uh we're in the message of the
[38:06] hour but what is the message of the hour
[38:08] the message of the hour is the move of
[38:10] god
[38:13] amen is the move of god
[38:17] in this last day a move of god that we
[38:21] have identified by
[38:22] scripture
[38:25] praise the lord we have a time
[38:29] we we have attached malachi 4 to this
[38:31] move of god
[38:32] we have attached revelation 10 7 to this
[38:35] move of god
[38:36] sin luke uh uh uh
[38:40] 17 we have attached all of these
[38:42] scriptures because we see
[38:43] god fulfilling we see god moving
[38:47] upon those scripture sure
[38:51] praise the lord
[38:54] amen and so we want to talk
[38:58] a little bit about the move of god we
[39:01] want to talk
[39:03] about the sweetness of god we want to
[39:06] talk about the speed of god
[39:09] praise the lord are we together
[39:13] amen
[39:19] because you see that as as time goes by
[39:22] and and things are happening uh in the
[39:25] earth
[39:26] you know and things are happening around
[39:28] us every day
[39:29] there are a lot of things and that is
[39:32] and that is the place where uh uh the
[39:36] critics
[39:37] and uh and the atas and all the people
[39:40] that that think that uh you know
[39:44] this thing about god is just uh it's
[39:47] just
[39:47] you know it's just a man's idea and uh
[39:50] uh
[39:51] where is god and all of the evil that is
[39:53] happening in the world
[39:55] sure you know
[39:58] if really there is a god which means he
[40:01] has abandoned
[40:02] us
[40:06] glory be to god amen
[40:10] but
[40:14] if we would just understand
[40:17] or have a little bit of an idea
[40:20] you know about how our god moves and how
[40:24] he
[40:24] operates god is not a man
[40:29] for the modified god mid man
[40:33] praise the lord so god is not a man
[40:37] and you cannot use uh
[40:40] you know a man's brain to be able to
[40:44] understand how god moves and how he
[40:47] works
[40:49] praise the lord amen
[40:54] so uh as we look at as we look at these
[40:58] things
[40:59] together uh
[41:03] let me share something here with you
[41:09] from the message the truth is the seal
[41:14] the truth is to seal
[41:19] saskatchewan would take the second one
[41:21] first before the first
[41:23] i have everything missed up here so
[41:27] amen
[41:30] now we just happen to think
[41:34] just watch this meaning see
[41:37] einstein proof but
[41:40] scientific that if two objects are
[41:43] coming to each other
[41:45] like two cars coming down across the
[41:48] road
[41:49] and if they were coming fast enough
[41:52] now they did really have to
[41:56] to be going fast
[41:59] like a billion miles a second
[42:03] which of course the inventors of kais
[42:07] have not put their speed on kai yet
[42:10] we don't have that speed speed limit we
[42:13] don't have a speed limit
[42:15] like a billion miles a second but i i
[42:18] wish
[42:19] we would we will look into some few
[42:20] things and help you to understand what
[42:22] we're talking about
[42:23] if a car could go that fast
[42:29] a billion miles per second but uh he
[42:32] says
[42:33] they could pass right through
[42:36] one another and never disrupt
[42:41] i think sure
[42:44] they could pass through one another
[42:49] and never disrupt and think
[42:54] praise the lord
[43:00] the speed would do it pass them right
[43:04] through one another
[43:06] without disrupting a thing
[43:09] think about this you you
[43:12] you you you you go to the airport
[43:16] and you get in a plane
[43:20] and the plane takes down the runway
[43:25] okay it's about to take off you see the
[43:28] speed that the plane gets on
[43:31] and it gets you know on the wrong way
[43:36] it starts to take up it's going you know
[43:39] even as the plane starts to take up it's
[43:42] it's just
[43:43] picking up to go the speed that it takes
[43:46] to pick up
[43:47] is not the kind of a speed that you
[43:50] drive on your highway with
[43:52] sure okay
[43:56] and then when it gets on the wrong way
[43:58] and it starts to pick up
[43:59] i mean you grab the edge of your seat
[44:04] because it's speeding and then when it
[44:07] takes off
[44:09] you know it starts to go off you are
[44:11] just holding the earth
[44:12] hole in there and then when it gets up
[44:15] to a place where it's settled down
[44:18] you feel comfortable
[44:22] and it looks like the plane is not
[44:24] moving
[44:25] but the speed has not changed
[44:31] it's still moving in such a speed
[44:36] but you can feel it
[44:39] right praise the lord
[44:45] amen if you have the idea of the speed
[44:48] that you are moving well up there you
[44:50] will not sleep
[44:52] even the food they give you you will not
[44:54] eat it
[44:56] because it is not your normal caspi
[45:03] it's moving with such a speed yeah
[45:08] the distance from here uh uh uh
[45:12] uh that you would take to get to uh
[45:15] uh uh uh washington dc
[45:18] you might be you might drive maybe uh uh
[45:21] even if you choose
[45:22] not to eat or not to stop in a way you
[45:25] just take gas
[45:26] you're going to drive i mean maybe close
[45:29] to 20 hours
[45:30] sure but if you get in the flight
[45:34] it takes you maybe about two hours
[45:42] you see the differences in speed
[45:46] praise the lord
[45:53] and another thing with speed is that
[45:58] the the kind of speed
[46:01] that an airplane would take to take you
[46:04] from here to dc
[46:08] can only operate
[46:11] in the ram up there yeah
[46:15] right if you use that speed down here
[46:19] is disaster
[46:26] praise the lord amen
[46:29] and this goes to saying as we
[46:32] as we move
[46:35] upward the speed
[46:40] changes
[46:43] praise the lord the speed
[46:48] changes
[46:52] i'm trying to to to
[46:55] put this in a place where uh
[46:58] uh it will even the the the children
[47:01] will understand it
[47:05] verbally says this as he goes here he
[47:08] says
[47:08] but yet heaven
[47:13] is so many billions and billions
[47:17] and billions of light years beyond that
[47:22] praise the lord
[47:26] tell is is not
[47:29] even taught off you cannot think
[47:32] about the distance from here to heaven
[47:38] if you want to put it into
[47:41] mass sure
[47:45] praise the lord you continue about it
[47:51] are we together
[47:54] he says till issa is not taught of

[48:19] they will your mind think
[48:23] amen it will be
[48:26] like the mind so fast
[48:34] it will be faster if we
[48:37] could think of heaven
[48:41] that's how quick you they
[48:45] be there
[48:51] praise the lord if you think of heaven
[48:56] as your mind think of heaven that's how
[48:59] quick
[49:00] you'll be there brother branham
[49:03] experience beyond the curtain of time
[49:06] when he laid down on his bed on his
[49:08] little twin bed
[49:10] and he says lord i wonder what it will
[49:13] be like
[49:16] as he thought of heaven he
[49:20] traveled as his thought
[49:26] praise the lord amen
[49:42] brandon says this he said jesus after he
[49:46] was

[51:08] that you can't explain it
[51:11] you can't explain it even when you take
[51:13] medication because of pain
[51:15] you have pain in your body and you take
[51:18] medication
[51:19] and you and you drink the medication we
[51:21] know that the medications don't heal
[51:28] praise the lord
[51:33] are we together
[51:36] now so brother berlin is saying this he
[51:39] he he's comparing it with with jesus
[51:42] resurrection the bible says when when
[51:45] jesus says father into your hands i
[51:48] commit my spirit
[51:51] and the bible says he give up the gospel
[51:56] praise the lord his body was hanging on
[51:59] the cross
[52:00] but we know he stepped down to the
[52:02] region of the lost
[52:04] he was busy he was on his way down to
[52:07] the region of the lust
[52:09] as he gave up the ghost year he was
[52:12] opening the doors for the old testament
[52:14] saints

[52:29] sure and we know he went down there yeah
[52:33] and uh uh uh uh to the old testament
[52:36] scenes and
[52:36] like brother brandon says and went down
[52:38] there you know step the door
[52:40] sit and take the keys of of of uh
[52:44] life and death praise the lord
[52:47] he took the keys and and and and uh
[52:51] just in that period of time
[52:54] then we know that uh on the resurrection
[52:57] morning he came forth from the grave and
[53:00] and mary magdalene saw him and says and
[53:03] says
[53:03] oh my master he said touch me net
[53:08] don't touch me go and tell my brethrens
[53:11] praise the lord because he have not
[53:15] ascended to the father
[53:17] he has now presented the sacrifice to
[53:19] the father
[53:22] praise the lord so just in that time
[53:25] he was able to travel to heaven
[53:29] he came down met the two men on the road
[53:32] of immigrants
[53:37] we are talking about god speed
[53:46] praise the lord are we together
[53:51] time is filled
[53:55] with swift transition
[54:00] praise the lord
[54:03] just go away feel just go away for a
[54:06] week
[54:07] a month you come back and look at you oh
[54:08] my god you have grown
[54:11] we are snapping right now
[54:18] all of those things are just evidence of
[54:22] things that are swiftly happening
[54:26] that we have little ideas about
[54:33] praise the lord brother branham told us
[54:36] about the fourth dimension
[54:38] he says there are voices that are
[54:39] passing through this building now and as
[54:41] we are talking
[54:55] the invisible world is more real
[54:59] than the ones that we can see with our
[55:00] eyes
[55:02] praise the lord praise the lord
[55:06] amen because man
[55:10] has corrupt the word and they tried to
[55:12] faction it and they tried to dress it
[55:14] and try to make it colorful
[55:15] they have lost all of its natural beauty
[55:22] are we together he says speak
[55:25] no sooner than life has gone
[55:28] out of this body we are in the presence
[55:31] of god
[55:32] yandere we own and know
[55:37] as feet and inches and yeah
[55:40] and minds and so forth brother brahms
[55:43] says that is how much we know about
[55:45] speed
[55:47] how many yeah can you run how fast can
[55:50] you walk
[55:52] right that's why we know about speed
[55:56] but there are more speed that is going
[55:59] on
[56:00] praise the lord amen how do god take
[56:04] habits from our life that we don't feed
[56:06] it
[56:10] how he takes habit how he takes the
[56:12] desire of this world that you don't feed
[56:14] it
[56:16] you don't need an anesthesia
[56:19] for you to be delivered from lies
[56:26] praise the lord
[56:32] the word of god is quick
[56:36] and powerful the word
[56:40] have such a speed a has
[56:43] such a power it have such an
[56:46] effect
[56:50] if we will just only rightly receive the
[56:54] word
[56:54] don't pull it through our reasoning
[57:00] if that word can just goes directly to
[57:04] our soul
[57:05] it will have such an impact that we all
[57:08] can leave
[57:09] from this building tonight more stronger
[57:12] than we came in because the word
[57:16] is powerful and
[57:19] it's quake
[57:26] praise the lord
[57:30] we wouldn't know as feeding in inches
[57:33] yeah mars and sulfur
[57:36] we we are in this f bound system
[57:40] but when we leave here brother oh
[57:44] my water time
[57:46] [Laughter]
[57:48] what a time glory be to god
[57:52] what a time
[57:58] praise the lord amen
[58:03] it comes natural no wonder when a kid
[58:06] learn to ride a bicycle
[58:09] they are struggling to balance on it
[58:12] sure
[58:12] but as soon as they get a little sense
[58:15] of balance what they do the speed
[58:17] they don't think about the danger
[58:24] there is something of this body that
[58:27] want us to go
[58:28] faster
[58:29] [Music]
[58:32] praise the lord
[58:36] and after the know how to drive i mean
[58:38] ride a bicycle
[58:42] i mean uh they get they get
[58:45] used to that speed they want something
[58:48] more faster
[58:49] right sure
[58:53] praise the lord
[58:56] then they can't wait to get a driver
[58:57] license
[58:59] they said in a car they don't know how
[59:01] to drive but they were voo
[59:08] what is in their mind speed they want to
[59:11] go faster
[59:14] oh sin has slowed us down people
[59:20] sin has slowed us down
[59:26] sin has slowed us down
[59:30] that's the reason why the man
[59:33] that living in sin he's sluffle
[59:38] he's very slurful because sin
[59:42] bounds you amen
[59:46] a bounce you erupt you of your abilities
[59:49] if it was not because of sin we don't
[59:51] need a vehicle
[59:52] that's right right we don't need
[59:54] airplanes
[59:57] praise the lord we could have traveled
[1:00:00] more faster we could have traveled
[1:00:04] by the speed of the world
[1:00:14] praise the lord you realize that i i
[1:00:18] at a young age oh man you you could move
[1:00:21] faster than
[1:00:21] and and enjoy can run as you get older
[1:00:27] you cannot run like you used to do when
[1:00:29] you were young
[1:00:30] why because corruption in the body
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:36] sin affected the body yeah so you can't
[1:00:39] wait you want to get out of that body
[1:00:45] why because we came from out of the
[1:00:48] world
[1:00:49] from the thought of god
[1:00:53] everest child and daughter of god
[1:00:56] have in them such a speed
[1:01:00] social speed that the devil can make it
[1:01:04] with you
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:05] [Laughter]
[1:01:07] you can go so fast that a democracy
[1:01:13] i i thought he was a drunkard where he
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:18] [Applause]
[1:01:22] gone
[1:01:24] praise the lord amen
[1:01:28] but we we've been held back so long
[1:01:31] church
[1:01:33] as children of god
[1:01:40] glory be to god amen
[1:01:49] time is filled
[1:01:52] with swift transition right from the
[1:01:56] beginning of time
[1:01:59] it happened so quick it was so
[1:02:02] quick for man to lose
[1:02:06] that innocence
[1:02:09] and prettiest and and now he knows he
[1:02:12] has a sense of danger
[1:02:15] he knows now he's naked he knows about
[1:02:18] evil
[1:02:19] right a word
[1:02:22] of innocence and purity
[1:02:26] changed so quick
[1:02:34] praise the lord so quick
[1:02:41] so quick time
[1:02:46] is filled
[1:02:49] with swift transition
[1:02:54] one of these days will not be here
[1:03:00] this time will pass
[1:03:06] praise the lord that's the reason why no
[1:03:08] matter what you're going through
[1:03:11] just hold to god's unchanging hands
[1:03:14] because it will pass and it will pass so
[1:03:17] quick
[1:03:22] it will pass so quick
[1:03:26] that you will be looking for the date
[1:03:28] and time that it did happen
[1:03:35] are we together oh my
[1:03:40] praise the lord amen
[1:03:45] oh my what a time people
[1:03:49] what a time we can just
[1:03:52] we can just look forward to that
[1:03:55] amen if we can we can look forward
[1:03:59] to that praise the lord
[1:04:02] and just like i said and brother brown
[1:04:06] taught about
[1:04:07] you know he he taught us about uh uh you
[1:04:09] know
[1:04:10] how science you know uh the advancement
[1:04:13] of science uh uh
[1:04:14] showing you know he was trying to give
[1:04:16] us a picture
[1:04:17] you know that everything that science is
[1:04:19] doing they are copying from what god has
[1:04:22] already done
[1:04:23] amen and and that that's what he taught
[1:04:26] in the message the countdown
[1:04:28] and he says how man moved from traveling
[1:04:30] on his legs and then he
[1:04:32] he got on the hearse and started you
[1:04:34] know uh
[1:04:35] traveling with hers to go more faster
[1:04:38] and then he pulled
[1:04:39] two of them together and just built a
[1:04:41] little box
[1:04:42] and set it behind it praise the lord i
[1:04:45] believe even before the
[1:04:46] the the first time maybe it was just
[1:04:48] rolling them down
[1:04:49] down you know down uh i mean just like
[1:04:53] those people in siberia do with the dogs
[1:04:55] and things they just put a slate there
[1:04:56] and tie it around the dog sit there and
[1:04:58] dogs ride them
[1:04:59] on the snow and all of that and
[1:05:03] uh and and then and then uh from from
[1:05:06] that man understand by gathering you
[1:05:09] know by putting two or more
[1:05:11] hearses together they could get more
[1:05:13] power they could go more
[1:05:14] faster and uh uh so
[1:05:18] the they picked that knowledge and and
[1:05:21] they were able to
[1:05:22] you know put some uh uh
[1:05:25] uh mechanism together build a vehicle
[1:05:29] you know and and then when when the
[1:05:31] vehicle started going from one
[1:05:33] to another you know uh uh and then they
[1:05:36] realize
[1:05:37] that that this i mean they can they can
[1:05:39] they can increase
[1:05:40] the speed but but if they put
[1:05:44] more mechanism together there will not
[1:05:48] be
[1:05:48] space down here for that speed to go so
[1:05:51] they have to carry up
[1:05:52] a little bit sure so they went to
[1:05:55] the airplane age and they realized oh my
[1:05:58] we can get up there in the cloud
[1:06:00] now we can gather more speed and go
[1:06:06] astronaut
[1:06:10] praise the lord amen
[1:06:13] we can gather more speed
[1:06:17] and go astronaut yes
[1:06:24] praise the lord now so we see you
[1:06:27] we see all of that and uh uh
[1:06:30] i mean uh uh so he he's showing us that
[1:06:35] you know that that uh just like he said
[1:06:38] or all we know is
[1:06:39] his feet yeah and minds that's that's
[1:06:41] what we know
[1:06:42] in this uh in this dimension
[1:06:46] praise the lord in this dimension that
[1:06:48] we live
[1:06:50] right but if you go up we know that we
[1:06:54] on earth here we we we eliminated three
[1:06:57] dimensions
[1:06:58] you know not limited but i mean they
[1:07:00] have space three dimensions
[1:07:02] the fourth dimension is uh is beyond our
[1:07:05] scene
[1:07:06] and uh uh but in in that dimension
[1:07:10] also there's a speed yeah
[1:07:13] i mean
[1:07:17] and uh and and and and the fifth
[1:07:20] dimension
[1:07:21] has more speed than the fourth dimension
[1:07:28] as you break the range of dimensions
[1:07:33] your speed goes more faster
[1:07:40] praise the lord
[1:07:43] but it's it's this this is a beautiful
[1:07:45] thing here
[1:07:49] oh my goodness i was trying to keep a
[1:07:51] little bit of time here for us to
[1:07:54] uh just prayed and thanked the lord
[1:07:56] before we go home tonight
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:03] let me read this uh
[1:08:06] taking god at his word let me read this
[1:08:09] and then
[1:08:09] maybe uh uh
[1:08:13] if we can get through this then we will
[1:08:16] we will
[1:08:18] find a little place here to pray
[1:08:22] lord be to god amen
[1:08:26] if there's one thing that we must be
[1:08:28] grateful for
[1:08:31] is that
[1:08:34] god has caught us on this wagon
[1:08:41] young people this is not a church
[1:08:44] no it's not a church making this is a
[1:08:48] move of god
[1:08:52] this is a move of god and with the move
[1:08:55] of god
[1:08:56] you cannot choose
[1:09:01] to move as you want you have to catch up
[1:09:07] or s is going to pass you back
[1:09:11] you cannot choose to move as you want
[1:09:14] no you got to catch up

[1:09:26] praise the lord oh you you can see it in
[1:09:29] your prayer life
[1:09:31] you can see it in the reading of the
[1:09:32] word

[1:10:29] zealous they with their family
[1:10:31] they defended this message
[1:10:33] because they were they were in the move
[1:10:34] at the time
[1:10:39] but somewhere in the alive they stood

[1:11:28] and refuse to move
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:37] you sit in that in a vehicle and say i'm

[1:12:22] [Music]
[1:12:24] praise the lord we are a privileged
[1:12:27] people
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:34] brethren says here in taking
[1:12:37] god at his word he says that's what the
[1:12:39] matter today
[1:12:40] we are teaching theology
[1:12:44] and little all baby petty things
[1:12:49] i mean we we want to be right
[1:12:52] we struggle to be right sure
[1:12:56] that's that's that's our problem
[1:12:59] we struggle to be we want to pronounce
[1:13:01] things right
[1:13:02] we want to make sure it's arrived
[1:13:03] brother branham said it we
[1:13:05] we struggle for all of that sure it's
[1:13:08] not a bad thing
[1:13:10] but it's not the real thing
[1:13:15] it's not a bad thing but it's not the
[1:13:17] real thing
[1:13:22] praise the lord
[1:13:28] they keep referring back to what
[1:13:31] movie said and what a b
[1:13:34] samson said they were good men
[1:13:38] but they are they have lived their lives
[1:13:44] 150 years ago
[1:13:47] the greatest signs in the world listen
[1:13:51] to what brother branham said
[1:13:52] he's talking to the church here he says
[1:13:54] we we we i mean we
[1:13:56] we capitalize on theology i was baptized
[1:13:59] in
[1:14:00] jesus name and and you know i believe
[1:14:03] there is one god and
[1:14:04] and and we struggle with all of these
[1:14:07] things
[1:14:08] sure because that's what
[1:14:11] we make religion
[1:14:16] praise the lord
[1:14:20] he says they refer back to movie and
[1:14:22] they refer
[1:14:23] back to to all of these great men
[1:14:27] praise the lord now it's bringing us
[1:14:30] it's bringing us
[1:14:30] into context because we refer back to
[1:14:32] brother branham we have to say brother
[1:14:34] branham say
[1:14:37] sure praise the lord
[1:14:45] and because we said brother branham says
[1:14:47] and we can be able to
[1:14:49] to to get on the computer and gather
[1:14:53] a bunch of quotes on what he said on the
[1:14:55] same thing
[1:14:56] we think now we are preaching
[1:15:02] we have a bunch of indoor and preachers
[1:15:05] even in this message
[1:15:10] take us out of a message pupate we don't
[1:15:12] have a message to preach
[1:15:19] take us out of a message preach it poop
[1:15:21] it we don't have message to preach
[1:15:23] and then he says well there are
[1:15:24] denominations
[1:15:26] god called us to preach to the bride
[1:15:36] brother man i'm saying here glory be to
[1:15:39] god
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:52] he says and they keep referring back to
[1:15:54] what modi said
[1:15:56] and to what a b samsung said
[1:16:01] they were great men but they have lived
[1:16:06] their days 150 years
[1:16:10] the greatest science in the world was a
[1:16:13] french
[1:16:14] scientist said
[1:16:18] if a man ever made
[1:16:21] at a terrific speed 20 miles an hour
[1:16:24] gravity would take him off the earth
[1:16:30] why how nonsense science has got him
[1:16:34] glory 900 900
[1:16:38] signs has got him going 900 miles an
[1:16:42] hour
[1:16:43] now in a jet plane or something like
[1:16:47] that
[1:16:48] and still taking him further
[1:16:52] the problem of referring to brother
[1:16:56] branham
[1:16:57] is that as a prophet
[1:17:01] says see you he preached a message
[1:17:04] for a future generation
[1:17:09] praise the lord amen
[1:17:13] and that's the reason why if you cannot
[1:17:15] be able to get
[1:17:16] into the message and be able to address
[1:17:19] your present time and be able to address
[1:17:23] your your your life situation and your
[1:17:26] house situation
[1:17:28] sure praise the lord
[1:17:40] glory be to god
[1:17:51] praise the lord
[1:17:54] if a man ever made a terrific speed
[1:17:59] oh when their scientists said it it was
[1:18:02] looking like a brilliant idea
[1:18:05] right now but now better balances they
[1:18:08] have
[1:18:09] more speed like that right
[1:18:13] praise the lord you have more speed like
[1:18:16] that even the jet plane
[1:18:18] goes more speed like that but it still
[1:18:21] struggle with gravity
[1:18:22] yes it is still on a
[1:18:26] gravitational influence
[1:18:29] and the problems the power got to keep
[1:18:32] balancing it in the air
[1:18:38] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:18:41] oh my are we together
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:49] he never referred back to them moldy
[1:18:52] harder
[1:18:52] had a message of his day
[1:18:56] samson calvin all the rest of them had
[1:18:59] it of the evening but this is
[1:19:03] another day sure
[1:19:06] praise the lord amen
[1:19:11] they were going on oscar we
[1:19:14] are a jack plane
[1:19:18] moving barbarian is helping us to see
[1:19:22] that what god
[1:19:24] is doing in our age or god
[1:19:27] has started to do will be a move that
[1:19:30] would be
[1:19:30] so fast that if you get you just get
[1:19:34] stuck to the balkan tapes

[1:28:34] just
[1:28:34] we just get in the closet and take out
[1:28:36] the clothes and put it on us and start
[1:28:38] stepping out to church
[1:28:40] now let me not go to those places let me
[1:28:42] stay right here
[1:28:43] i'm almost out of time i promise that i
[1:28:46] won't keep you alone tonight
[1:28:52] oh glory be to god you love the lord
[1:28:54] tonight
[1:28:56] amen what a wonderful jesus we serve
[1:29:00] amen praise the lord
[1:29:03] see people has made this message
[1:29:05] thinking that
[1:29:07] when we just say i you know uh uh i just
[1:29:10] just you know feed on the word and you
[1:29:13] know
[1:29:13] uh uh uh uh resot the word and memorize
[1:29:16] what brother branham said and you know
[1:29:18] we just carry ourselves through all of
[1:29:20] those physical activity yeah
[1:29:26] that we will have been better
[1:29:31] i know
[1:29:37] praise the lord
[1:29:43] you see the thing about speed and the
[1:29:46] changing from one dimension to another
[1:29:48] that's what i was trying to explain to
[1:29:50] you
[1:29:52] in the movie of a flight before as the
[1:29:55] flight gets down the wrong way
[1:29:58] you hold on to your seat
[1:30:02] and as it's going up all your stomach is
[1:30:05] turning in you oh my goodness
[1:30:07] it's good and then when it gets
[1:30:11] up when it gets up that's a mystery
[1:30:17] praise the lord the mystery there is
[1:30:20] that
[1:30:26] the speed that the airplane is going on
[1:30:32] that speed has slowed down
[1:30:37] for your body to catch up with it
[1:30:42] that's why when the fly gets up there
[1:30:44] you feel comfortable
[1:30:45] you can even get up and go to the
[1:30:47] bathroom why because your body
[1:30:50] has caught up with the speed
[1:30:56] pressure
[1:31:00] why the plane was down here the speed
[1:31:03] that it was on
[1:31:04] to take off that's why they say
[1:31:08] keep your seatbelt on because your body
[1:31:11] cannot catch up with that speed
[1:31:15] a stay in the same atmosphere where you
[1:31:18] live
[1:31:19] right
[1:31:26] oh my goodness oh thank you jesus
[1:31:30] oh i could break into things tonight i
[1:31:33] feel like speaking in tongues
[1:31:38] oh my praise the lord
[1:31:43] amen that's the reason why one time
[1:31:47] when you were a sinner there were things
[1:31:49] that ran through your mind and things
[1:31:51] that you did and
[1:31:52] it was just looking like your your your
[1:31:55] identity
[1:31:56] i mean you you could live it you could
[1:31:57] see it you could do it
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:02] but when a word that is quick and
[1:32:05] powerful
[1:32:06] when the speed of the world came and got
[1:32:09] ahold of you
[1:32:11] from the beginning you feel
[1:32:13] uncomfortable
[1:32:15] when a preacher preaches you feel
[1:32:17] uncomfortable because
[1:32:18] you have just been caught up into that
[1:32:20] speech
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] but as you start growing in grace
[1:32:27] now you can sit down and you can lift
[1:32:29] your hands up and say praise the lord
[1:32:32] thank you jesus
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:38] oh my because
[1:32:41] your body has caught up with the speed
[1:32:45] now you can look back and say wow is
[1:32:47] that where i used to be
[1:32:49] [Music]
