[40:46] Gracious Almighty God,
[40:49] we thank you very much tonight for this
[40:53] wonderful privilege that we have to be
[40:56] called your sons and to be called your
[40:59] daughters.
[41:00] Thank you for inspiring it in our hearts
[41:04] to come into your presence
[41:06] defying every situation and the
[41:09] weariness of the body because you have
[41:12] placed your love upon our hearts.
[41:14] Father, we want to thank you and we're
[41:17] asking tonight that you will accept our
[41:20] praises and our worship. They are
[41:23] proceeding out of thankful and grateful
[41:26] hearts. May you accept them, heavenly
[41:28] father. May you also accept our person.
[41:32] Let nothing, oh God, stand between our
[41:35] soul and the savior. Come by their
[41:38] father and do those things that you are
[41:40] known by. move through the audience of
[41:43] your people, but please don't pass no
[41:46] one by. May you stop at the post of each
[41:49] individual. May you descend their needs.
[41:53] May you discern their petitions and
[41:55] their request and grant to them the
[41:57] substance of their desires. Oh,
[42:00] establish them, settle them, make them
[42:02] happy, fulfill their joy. Oh God, please
[42:05] bring the bread of life unto us. Make
[42:08] the path to your glory brighter. May the
[42:11] preaching of the word cast out all
[42:13] fears. Let it cast out demons of
[42:16] sicknesses
[42:17] and whatever form that we are being held
[42:21] by Lord that we might be free and become
[42:23] lightooted having our burdens rolled
[42:26] away to continue to testify and to give
[42:30] the proof that you are indeed alive. You
[42:33] are not dead. Bless us is our prayer.
[42:37] Bless your servant the pastor here. May
[42:40] you continue to increase his wisdom.
[42:42] Give him more revelation and the grace
[42:45] that he has need of to continue to
[42:47] tender the flock of your people. We ask
[42:50] for the ministers that are associated
[42:52] with him that you will also bless them.
[42:55] Oh God, bless the officers of the
[42:58] church. Bless every family represented
[43:00] in here. Visit them all in a wonderful
[43:04] way. You promise to build your church
[43:06] with the gate of hell on prevailing. May
[43:09] you confirm that promise in the life of
[43:12] every brother, every sister, both young
[43:15] and old, in every family. We pray. Help
[43:18] us tonight. If there be those who are
[43:20] still coming on their way, may you guide
[43:22] their path here safely. If there be
[43:25] those who are in their houses, may you
[43:27] give them a quickening. Oh God, touch
[43:29] your people for good. And if there be
[43:32] those who are connected with us in the
[43:33] hair waves, may your cable pass from you
[43:36] unto us and from us unto them that they
[43:39] might be like partakers of the same
[43:41] blessings such as we shall receive. Be
[43:44] with other saints who are gathered
[43:46] elsewhere tonight. Your presence that we
[43:48] believe is with us. Let our same
[43:50] presence abide with them that both here
[43:53] and there when the services will be
[43:55] over. Amen. we would we would all have
[43:57] the cause to give you praise and to give
[44:00] you glory. Grant it is our desire as we
[44:03] commit thy ser ourselves thy word and
[44:06] this time into thy care in the name of
[44:09] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[44:13] Amen.
[44:15] Amen. Amen. All right. The Lord bless
[44:18] you.
[44:20] Um so that you can take your seats once
[44:22] and for all I will suggest we read our
[44:25] Bibles and thereafter we can greet
[44:29] ourselves and go to the preaching of the
[44:32] word. If you have your Bibles with you I
[44:36] just want us to turn to the book of Job
[44:38] tonight.
[44:40] Job chapter one.
[44:44] Can you bear to stand for us to read the
[44:46] whole chapter?
[44:48] All right. That's good.
[44:52] Job chapter one.
[45:02] If you are there, say amen.
[45:06] All right.
[45:08] There was a man in the land of
[45:11] whose name was Job. And that man was
[45:15] perfect and upright,
[45:17] and one that feared God, and assued
[45:20] evil.
[45:23] And there were born unto him seven sons,
[45:25] and three daughters. His substance also
[45:29] was 7,000 sheep, and 3,000 camels, and
[45:32] 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 shihasses, and
[45:37] a very great household. So that this man
[45:40] was the greatest of all the men of the
[45:43] east.
[45:44] And his sons went and feasted in their
[45:47] houses, everyone is day, and sent and
[45:52] called for their three sisters to eat
[45:55] and to drink with them.
[45:58] And it was so when the days of their
[46:01] feasting were gone about that job sent
[46:05] and sanctified them and rose up early in
[46:08] the morning and offered burnt offerings
[46:11] according to the number of them all. For
[46:14] Job said, "It may be that my sons have
[46:18] sinned and cursed God in their hearts."
[46:22] Thus did Job continually.
[46:26] Now there was a day when the sons of God
[46:29] came to present themselves before the
[46:30] Lord, and Satan came also among them.
[46:34] And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence
[46:37] comest thou? Then Satan answered the
[46:40] Lord, and said, From going to and fro in
[46:42] the earth, and from walking up and down
[46:45] in it? And the Lord said unto Satan, "As
[46:48] thou considered my servant Job, that
[46:52] there is none like him in the earth, a
[46:54] perfect and an upright man, one that
[46:57] fear God and assure evil?" Then Satan
[47:01] answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job
[47:04] fear God for not? Has not thou made an
[47:07] hedge about him, and about his house,
[47:11] and about all that he hath on every
[47:13] side? Thou has blessed the work of his
[47:16] hands, and his substance is increased in
[47:19] the land.
[47:21] But put forth thy hand now, and touch
[47:25] all that heath, and he will cause thee
[47:28] to thy face. And the Lord said unto
[47:31] Satan, Behold, all that they hath is in
[47:34] thy hand. Only upon himself, put not
[47:38] forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from
[47:41] the presence of the Lord. And there was
[47:44] a day when his sons and his daughters
[47:47] were eating and drinking wine in their
[47:50] eldest brother's house. And there came a
[47:52] messenger unto Job and said, The oxen
[47:55] were plowing, and the ass is feeding
[47:58] beside them. And the Sabbians fell upon
[48:01] them, and took them away. Yeah, they
[48:04] have slain the servants with the edge of
[48:07] the sword, and I only am escaped alone
[48:11] to tell thee. While he was there
[48:14] speaking, there came also another
[48:18] and said, "The fire of God is falling
[48:20] from heaven, and had burned up the sheep
[48:23] and the servants, and consumed them, and
[48:26] I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
[48:30] While he was here speaking, there came
[48:33] also another and said, "The Chaldians,
[48:39] I made out three bands and fell upon the
[48:42] camels, and have carried them away.
[48:45] Yeah, and slain the servants with the
[48:47] hedge of the sword, and I only am
[48:50] escaped alone to tell thee." While he
[48:54] was here speaking, there came also
[48:57] another and said, "Thy sons and thy
[49:00] daughters were eating and drinking
[49:03] wine in their elder brother's house. And
[49:06] behold, there came a great wind from the
[49:08] wilderness, and smoked all the four
[49:11] corners of the house, and it fell upon
[49:13] the young men, and they are dead, and I
[49:17] only am escaped alone to tell thee."
[49:22] Then Job arose and rent his mantle and
[49:26] shaved his head and fell down upon the
[49:28] ground and worshiped
[49:31] and said, "Naked came I out of my
[49:34] mother's womb, and naked shall I return
[49:37] thither. The Lord gave, and the Lord
[49:40] hath taken away. Blessed be the name of
[49:44] the Lord." In all this, Job sinned not
[49:49] nor charge God foolishly.
[49:52] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[49:55] reading of his holy word. Amen. God
[49:58] bless you. You may please be seated.
[50:05] I'd like to greet everyone of you
[50:07] tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:09] Christ.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:12] And uh
[50:14] I want to thank God again for making it
[50:17] possible for me to pass
[50:22] uh by and to be in fellowship with the
[50:26] saints with the believers from this part
[50:29] of the world. Amen. And uh I thank uh
[50:34] precious pastor here for
[50:37] extending to me this privilege to be of
[50:39] service
[50:41] uh believing God somewhere along the
[50:44] line we can be of a blessing. And uh I
[50:48] forgot to tell you that Pastor Baker
[50:50] said I must thank you for your
[50:51] generosity.
[50:54] Yeah. Because I was actually meant to be
[50:57] here last Sunday.
[50:59] But uh for some reasons which God knew
[51:04] before the foundation of the world and
[51:06] the generosity of your pastor, I was
[51:09] loaned to Arizona
[51:13] and uh we did had a wonderful time
[51:17] there. So he told me repeatedly while
[51:20] going to the airport that you must thank
[51:22] that brother for his generosity for me
[51:25] and the church. So in case he ask you,
[51:30] let him know that I passed his message.
[51:33] He said he was very very kind. So you
[51:36] have a very kind pastor. So the Lord
[51:39] bless you and I bring the greetings from
[51:43] the saints in Arizona and um also that
[51:47] of those in Virginia and uh also from
[51:51] Nigeria. Uh we are doing well by the
[51:55] grace of God and uh it's a joy to see
[51:58] all of you again and we trust to God
[52:01] that you are all doing fine. Amen. So
[52:04] but you'll have to bear with me since
[52:06] your Sunday was Lent. Uh this is the
[52:10] only evening that I have with you and uh
[52:14] but I trust that the Lord will uh give
[52:18] us more time as we wait for the coming
[52:21] of the Lord. Tomorrow morning I'll be
[52:24] flying to New York uh till the weekend
[52:26] then to Canada before returning to
[52:29] Nigeria. So I coveret your prayers that
[52:32] God will help me through the rest of the
[52:35] journey. But I've enjoyed every bit of
[52:37] my time since I arrived in the early
[52:39] hours of yesterday. I was supposed to
[52:42] have come in in the night. But we had
[52:44] flights delay. We were in the plane for
[52:47] 2 hours. Uh first it was the co-pilot
[52:50] that was missing. When they eventually
[52:53] got the co-pilot, then the weather was a
[52:56] problem. When the weather got out of the
[52:59] way, then we were on the queue. We are
[53:01] we became number 15 on the queue to fly.
[53:04] And uh in all the process two hours was
[53:06] gone uh right in the plane. So I think I
[53:10] came in past 1:00 a.m. yesterday
[53:13] morning. But all is well and uh so glad
[53:16] to see you again. Amen. So tonight I
[53:21] want to
[53:23] speak on lessons from the temptation of
[53:26] Job.
[53:28] Lessons from the temptation of Job.
[53:31] Amen.
[53:34] And uh
[53:37] I'd like to call your attention to the
[53:39] very first verse of the scripture that
[53:41] we read.
[53:44] The Bible told us that there was a man
[53:47] in the land of
[53:49] whose name was Job.
[53:52] And that man was perfect.
[53:56] That's where I'm going. Perfect and
[53:59] upright.
[54:02] Upright and perfect people ordinarily
[54:04] should not have problems.
[54:08] Yeah, this is why I must read his
[54:10] background for you. He was perfect. He
[54:13] was upright. He was the one who feared
[54:16] God and avoid evil.
[54:21] So by the righteousness of his own day,
[54:25] he was living above board.
[54:28] I'm trying to give you his background
[54:30] and his credentials
[54:32] so that maybe somebody's picture might
[54:34] fit into that tonight.
[54:37] And uh not only that, not only was he
[54:41] righteous, now this thing we have read,
[54:44] it's God's own assessment of Job.
[54:48] This was how God saw him. And that was
[54:50] why it was placed like this in the only
[54:54] eternal records. Nothing can change this
[54:57] record because God wrote that of him
[55:00] himself.
[55:02] Are you following now? He was not just
[55:05] perfect. He was not just upright. He was
[55:08] not just somebody who feared the Lord.
[55:10] He was not just somebody who shone evil.
[55:13] He was also somebody who placed his
[55:17] family under the atonement.
[55:21] So we can say he was a good Christian
[55:24] family man.
[55:31] He was a man that anticipated every
[55:34] situation. The Bible said he would think
[55:37] this young people maybe while they are
[55:39] playing they have caused God they have
[55:42] done this they have done that. He never
[55:45] even waited for any one of them to come
[55:48] and confess, own up or make right before
[55:51] he atones for them.
[55:55] This was the character and this is the
[55:57] character we are talking about tonight.
[56:01] Are you with me? Now you will appreciate
[56:05] why I'm giving this background as we go
[56:07] on. All right. But one day the Bible
[56:11] said
[56:13] Job true to his type or true to his life
[56:17] came for service.
[56:20] The meaning of when the sons of God uh
[56:23] it came to pass when the sons of God
[56:25] present themsel before the Lord simply
[56:28] means they came for service.
[56:32] Are you listening? There is no tough
[56:34] mystery to that. They came for service.
[56:37] What we are doing tonight is that we are
[56:39] presenting ourself before the Lord. We
[56:43] came for service. Now there might have
[56:45] been sisters in that congregation. But
[56:48] you know in God's population counting
[56:50] sensors, he only counts men.
[56:53] You understand? The day he fed 5,000,
[56:56] there might have been 15,000 there. They
[56:59] will tell you 5,000 men beside women and
[57:02] children. Are you catching it? So there
[57:05] might have been more people there. So
[57:07] when they say sons of God, sons of God
[57:09] sometimes is a figurative word in the
[57:11] Bible to represent the entire thing. Are
[57:15] you following? So when they present
[57:18] themsel before the Lord, Satan also came
[57:21] for that service.
[57:25] Now Satan attend services.
[57:29] Yeah. And there's nothing you can do
[57:31] about it. is here tonight.
[57:34] Yeah.
[57:36] And let me give you one of the symptoms
[57:38] of Satan. When you are dozing in the
[57:40] church, is is it God that is responsible
[57:42] for it?
[57:44] You can say that. I mean, I don't need
[57:46] to labor to prove that to you.
[57:49] Ah, my brother said,
[57:52] "Yeah, Satan attends service." When your
[57:56] mind is wondering about, Amen. until the
[58:00] rest are saying, "Amen." And you are
[58:01] wondering what did they say amen to.
[58:04] Satan is attending service. Because he
[58:07] will do everything he could to take away
[58:11] your attention so that you can miss your
[58:13] visitation.
[58:16] Even the prophet said when gifts are not
[58:19] being used right, amen, spiritual nine
[58:22] gifts that are general gift of God but
[58:26] operated wrongly, he says Satan is
[58:28] responsible for it.
[58:32] So, Satan attends service. Amen. And I
[58:35] want you to know he's also here tonight.
[58:38] But you know what? There is no need
[58:40] praying get him out.
[58:43] Uh because he will attend. The prophet
[58:46] said even in the Bible, God recognized
[58:49] Satan in the church.
[58:52] Because the problem of Job started in
[58:54] the church, not outside. It was from the
[58:57] church that his problem started. But
[59:00] what we can do to Satan is to put him in
[59:05] a condition where it will be difficult
[59:08] for him to operate.
[59:10] Amen. If you understand the millennium,
[59:13] the meaning of millennium, millennium is
[59:16] simply an environment where it became
[59:18] impossible for the devil to operate.
[59:22] That's what the prophet said. It said it
[59:24] will be bound with a chain of
[59:26] circumstance but it's not a physical
[59:28] chain.
[59:30] Amen. The chain is such that all his
[59:33] subjects are in hell.
[59:35] The church on earth is the redeemed. So
[59:38] he had nothing to walk on.
[59:42] Are you getting the secret? So if we all
[59:45] here are redeemed, that means the devil
[59:47] will have nothing to walk on. So as long
[59:50] as he has nobody to walk on, we are
[59:53] going to have peace. So when he comes
[59:56] into the service because he had nobody
[59:58] to walk on, he will be rendered useless.
[1:00:02] So tonight you can render him as an
[1:00:04] ordinary unlooker without any effect.
[1:00:08] You can do that in the church. You can
[1:00:10] do that in your house and you can do
[1:00:12] that in your life.
[1:00:16] Hallelujah. So let's render him useless.
[1:00:19] That is why if there be anything wrong
[1:00:22] in your life, don't wait to make it
[1:00:24] right. If you have hard feelings against
[1:00:27] anybody, don't wait to sort it out. When
[1:00:31] you are doing those things, following
[1:00:32] those little little instructions, you
[1:00:34] are purging yourself and you are ready
[1:00:37] Satan powerless in your life, in your
[1:00:40] congregation, in your home.
[1:00:44] Praise the Lord. So he's welcome if he
[1:00:46] wants to come for service but we are
[1:00:48] going to make him useless.
[1:00:51] How many accept that challenge?
[1:00:54] Aha. If we have not been doing that
[1:00:55] let's always do that. Let's render him
[1:00:58] impotent in our midst. Blessed be the
[1:01:02] name of the Lord. So when he came for
[1:01:04] this service the Lord spotted him
[1:01:08] and he asked him where are you coming
[1:01:10] from? He said from to and fro everywhere
[1:01:13] and anywhere.
[1:01:15] It was God himself who put up Job
[1:01:20] for examination.
[1:01:22] Listen to me.
[1:01:25] Satan was looking maybe seeing looking
[1:01:28] for the next target and God said don't
[1:01:31] worry I have one for you.
[1:01:34] Have you considered my servant Job?
[1:01:38] And the Lord repeated all the
[1:01:40] credentials
[1:01:42] that he gave to introduce Job into the
[1:01:44] scripture. It's a man that ensued evil.
[1:01:47] It's a man that feared me. It's a man
[1:01:49] that is upright. It's a man that places
[1:01:51] his family under the atonement. This,
[1:01:54] that, and the other. Every eternal
[1:01:56] quality that you can talk about, God
[1:01:59] spoke of Job.
[1:02:02] God wasn't expecting the devil to admit
[1:02:06] because Satan doesn't admit what is
[1:02:09] right.
[1:02:11] You know why? The way the economy of the
[1:02:14] devil operates, you must understand the
[1:02:17] economy of the devil operates in a way
[1:02:20] that nothing goes for nothing. Meaning
[1:02:22] that you cannot be nice without having
[1:02:25] an ulterior agenda.
[1:02:28] That's what I mean. Amen.
[1:02:33] Because in the economy of the devil,
[1:02:35] they are not nice.
[1:02:37] If they try to do anything good, they
[1:02:39] have a gain to make out of it.
[1:02:44] You want me to give you an example? All
[1:02:46] right. There was a time, you remember
[1:02:48] the woman who uh uh who was trying to
[1:02:53] anoint Jesus with that costly box of uh
[1:02:58] perfume oil, Alabasa. You remember? Do
[1:03:01] you remember how Judas's scariot took
[1:03:03] offense?
[1:03:06] Doesn't that look like a nice person? He
[1:03:08] said, "Why all this waste?"
[1:03:11] This thing could have been sold for so
[1:03:13] so much. And truly, he was making a
[1:03:16] point because that box of alabaster oil
[1:03:20] equals the cost of it. According to
[1:03:22] Israelites, you know, if you travel to
[1:03:24] Israel, all those their guides,
[1:03:26] according to their guides, they said the
[1:03:29] cost of that box will pay the annual
[1:03:32] wages of six Elite soldiers.
[1:03:36] Yeah, that was why the Bible said she
[1:03:38] dusted all her savings, everything she
[1:03:41] had ever gathered to buy just one box of
[1:03:43] perfume. So you can imagine why Judas's
[1:03:47] scariot was so unhappy with the
[1:03:50] arrangement that if we sold this thing
[1:03:53] for so much, we can set up a foundation
[1:03:56] that will take care of plenty poor.
[1:03:59] Isn't that nice? But the Bible was quick
[1:04:02] to tell you that it is not because he
[1:04:04] care for the poor, but it is simply
[1:04:06] because he's the one who carries the
[1:04:08] bag. He's a thief. He's been stealing
[1:04:10] church money.
[1:04:14] That is the only reason he was that nice
[1:04:17] because if the money had come in, he had
[1:04:20] imagined the percentage that would have
[1:04:22] gone to his pocket. And Jesus knew he
[1:04:24] was stealing, but he never talked about
[1:04:26] it.
[1:04:28] So the kingdom of the devil operates in
[1:04:31] such a way that nothing goes for
[1:04:33] nothing. Let me tell you friends
[1:04:37] so you can understand me more. In
[1:04:40] serving God, there are benefits.
[1:04:44] Listen to me. There are blessings. In
[1:04:47] fact, it pays to serve Jesus. If you
[1:04:50] have not started serving him, start
[1:04:52] tonight. Your life will never make any
[1:04:55] meaning until you give it to God. He is
[1:04:59] the owner of that life. He is the
[1:05:02] creator of that life. And he never
[1:05:04] created a life without a purpose. You
[1:05:07] have a need to meet in the body. That is
[1:05:10] why he created you. And as long as you
[1:05:12] find that purpose when you are serving
[1:05:14] it, you are God's maintenance
[1:05:16] obligation. Amen.
[1:05:20] Are you with me, brethren? Now, but we
[1:05:25] don't serve God because of benefits.
[1:05:29] Even though we know there are benefits
[1:05:31] in there. Are you catching it? And let
[1:05:34] me give you an example. The prophet said
[1:05:38] if
[1:05:39] at the end of my journey the Lord will
[1:05:42] tell me that of despite all these your
[1:05:46] services I will send you to hell.
[1:05:49] He said that will not make me quit
[1:05:51] serving God. I will keep serving him
[1:05:56] because I'm of the generation of there
[1:05:58] is nothing that can separate me
[1:06:02] from the love.
[1:06:04] Are you still in a condition that
[1:06:06] something can separate you? You have not
[1:06:09] begun. Let me tell you friends, we are
[1:06:11] going to the same heaven these people
[1:06:13] went and they never lived as angels on
[1:06:16] the earth. They lived like mortals.
[1:06:18] Elijah was a man of like passion just as
[1:06:21] you are.
[1:06:23] Amen. They had their appointments, their
[1:06:25] disappointments, their high times, their
[1:06:28] low seasons. So whatever is happening to
[1:06:30] you has happened before.
[1:06:32] So the prophet said, "I will keep
[1:06:34] serving the Lord still and if at the end
[1:06:38] he sent me to that L, if there is still
[1:06:40] the love of God in hell, I will still be
[1:06:42] loving him and serving him."
[1:06:46] Are you catching it? If that is
[1:06:48] technical for you, let us look at the
[1:06:49] three bru children because I want you to
[1:06:51] get every point.
[1:06:54] The three Hebrew children were on trial,
[1:06:56] isn't it? Yes. Shedrach, Misak, and
[1:06:58] Abednego.
[1:07:00] They said, "You either bow or we send
[1:07:02] you to the fire." And they said, "It's
[1:07:05] okay." Uh, but they were close to the
[1:07:07] king. Remember that they were king's
[1:07:09] governors. So he thought to give them a
[1:07:12] soft landing. And they said to him, "You
[1:07:14] know what, king? Don't bother yourself.
[1:07:17] If you give us 10 chances, our decision
[1:07:19] remains the same. So we might as well
[1:07:21] conclude the business instead of waiting
[1:07:24] time, wasting time." He said, "We know."
[1:07:26] Now watch, wait for it. We know that our
[1:07:29] God can deliver us. They knew his
[1:07:32] ability. They know what God can do. But
[1:07:37] here is a super revelation. Now, they
[1:07:40] also know the sovereignty of God.
[1:07:42] Meaning that it isn't everything that
[1:07:44] God can do that he does.
[1:07:49] Through that a little bit and let it
[1:07:51] settle. It is not everything that God
[1:07:54] can do that he does. And it will not
[1:07:57] still change God. It will not still make
[1:08:00] a difference. It can heal you, but it
[1:08:03] might choose not to heal you for his own
[1:08:05] pleasure. That is what I'm saying.
[1:08:11] We know that our God can deliver us. But
[1:08:15] excuse me king if he chooses not to do
[1:08:18] what he can do.
[1:08:21] In other words, if it be pleasing to him
[1:08:24] that instead of delivering us, he
[1:08:27] allowed us to roast to ashes in fire,
[1:08:30] yet we will still not bow down.
[1:08:34] That must be a capstone revelation to
[1:08:37] you.
[1:08:38] Those are the generations of those who
[1:08:40] said, "What can separate us?"
[1:08:46] So you could tell that those f those
[1:08:48] folks were not serving God because of
[1:08:50] benefit. There is benefit in it. Don't
[1:08:53] misunderstand me. Amen. There is rapture
[1:08:56] in it. There is wedding supper. There is
[1:09:00] a millennium reign. There's a living in
[1:09:03] the four square city. Even before we go
[1:09:05] into that, there are many benefits in
[1:09:07] here. Eh, it said because when we
[1:09:10] receive the Holy Ghost, all that we need
[1:09:14] and all that you will ever need even to
[1:09:17] your rapture is already in you. Tell me
[1:09:21] what your needs are tonight. They are
[1:09:23] inside in you. He said when you come
[1:09:26] around fellowship and you hear the word,
[1:09:29] the word of God is like a water that
[1:09:32] waters the life that is in you. And as
[1:09:34] you water your plants, what will it be
[1:09:36] doing? It will be growing. As you keep
[1:09:38] watering, when it goes to full stature,
[1:09:40] it will be fruiting. Start bringing
[1:09:43] fruit. Amen. All those fruit is bringing
[1:09:45] was already in there. They were already
[1:09:47] in there. It will take nurturing to
[1:09:50] bring it out. So calm down.
[1:09:54] All is well.
[1:09:57] Just keep nurturing that life. Whatever
[1:10:00] your needs are. If you need children is
[1:10:02] in there. If you need a husband is in
[1:10:05] there. If you need a wife is in there.
[1:10:07] If you need an accommodation is in
[1:10:09] there. If you need a job is in there. He
[1:10:11] said all that you need and all you will
[1:10:13] ever need. This is why Jesus told you,
[1:10:16] let's make a deal. You seek first the
[1:10:18] kingdom.
[1:10:20] [Music]
[1:10:22] And his righteousness.
[1:10:24] Let that be your ultimacy. He sell all
[1:10:27] other things I
[1:10:29] will. Let me tell you whether you pray
[1:10:32] for those other things or you don't pray
[1:10:35] for them. As long as you are faithfully
[1:10:37] seeking the kingdom, you will get them.
[1:10:41] If your faith can rise up to that level,
[1:10:44] your heavenly fathers know you need
[1:10:46] them. He will never withhold anything
[1:10:48] good for you. What blocks your blessing
[1:10:51] or what keeps it a distance is your
[1:10:53] anxiety.
[1:10:55] God doesn't want you to be anxious. This
[1:10:57] is why the prophet said Christianity is
[1:10:59] rest.
[1:11:03] Christianity is what? Rest. Rest little
[1:11:06] bride. Because all is well. That is why
[1:11:10] you can't walk well on this journey
[1:11:13] without having faith. Hallelujah.
[1:11:15] Brother said faith is your earnings. Oh
[1:11:18] let let's let's look at it this way.
[1:11:21] Let's look at it this way. Okay. Who has
[1:11:24] any notes no matter how small or a coin
[1:11:27] of your dollar?
[1:11:30] I know it's a cashless society but it
[1:11:32] doesn't matter.
[1:11:34] It doesn't matter the denomination.
[1:11:36] Thank you, pastor. It's going to build
[1:11:38] me out. All right. God bless you. All
[1:11:40] right. Now, Sister Naomi,
[1:11:44] yeah, I call her because she's my land
[1:11:46] lady.
[1:11:49] Now, if you were hungry
[1:11:52] and um
[1:11:55] you said, "If I could just get a loaf of
[1:11:58] bread, I'll be very fine." And I ask you
[1:12:03] how much is a loaf of bread? You say $1
[1:12:06] should do that or less.
[1:12:08] Now, and I said that's not a problem.
[1:12:11] Take
[1:12:13] now. Do you know how you are going to
[1:12:15] feel even without the loaf of bread?
[1:12:19] You are going to feel at peace.
[1:12:24] But you don't see the bread yet. Why are
[1:12:27] you feeling at peace? Because you have
[1:12:29] the purchasing power.
[1:12:35] Amen. That dollar is as good as that
[1:12:38] bread.
[1:12:40] What kept you anxious hungry before was
[1:12:43] because you don't have the purchasing
[1:12:45] power. But now you have it. Even if they
[1:12:48] tell you it takes two miles to get to
[1:12:50] the bread, you are going happily.
[1:12:54] There will be just be a new surge of
[1:12:56] energy
[1:12:58] because you've got what it takes to get
[1:13:01] the bread. You already feeling satisfied
[1:13:04] and yet you don't have the bread. You
[1:13:06] have not eaten the bread, but you've got
[1:13:08] what it takes. That dollar is your
[1:13:11] faith.
[1:13:14] The substance of what you are, the bread
[1:13:16] you are hoping to get, the evidence of
[1:13:19] the bread you have not seen. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:24] Did you catch that? So, you can just be
[1:13:26] waving your $1 on the street and be
[1:13:28] going. Whatever comes your way, you say,
[1:13:31] "Get out there. I want to get my bread
[1:13:34] because you have what it takes."
[1:13:39] So, when faith takes a hold,
[1:13:42] nothing can disturb you any longer. You
[1:13:46] will mock your fear. You will laugh in
[1:13:49] the face of your adversity. So what
[1:13:51] trouble us is faithlessness
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:57] and love and faith they are relations.
[1:14:00] Uhhuh. You didn't get that. Now for
[1:14:05] those who ever fell in love.
[1:14:11] It's part of the word of the Lord. For
[1:14:13] those who ever fell in love. When your
[1:14:16] lover tells you something, do you doubt
[1:14:18] it?
[1:14:21] Did you get what I'm saying? Do you ever
[1:14:23] doubt them? It says uh I'm coming.
[1:14:28] That I'm coming to you is as good as he
[1:14:30] has come. You will start preparing.
[1:14:34] Somebody ask you what's going on. Ah,
[1:14:36] he's coming. I said I can tell. I can
[1:14:39] tell. I can. Everything about you is
[1:14:42] coming. You are cleaning the house
[1:14:45] because he's coming. Yeah, you are
[1:14:47] preparing some meals because it's
[1:14:49] coming. You are even changing your dress
[1:14:52] because it's coming. You believe it.
[1:14:55] Nothing in you doubts that word that is
[1:14:58] coming. It's because you are in love. If
[1:15:01] you truly love the Lord, you don't doubt
[1:15:04] his word.
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:06] [Applause]
[1:15:12] And you see that love of the Lord can
[1:15:15] only be shed abroad in your heart by the
[1:15:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:20] Are you catching it?
[1:15:23] So, okay, if I keep going this way, are
[1:15:26] you prepared to stay all night?
[1:15:29] Amen. They said they are prepared. You
[1:15:31] are tempting your brother now. This is
[1:15:33] the only thing I do in my life. So I can
[1:15:35] do it till morning.
[1:15:38] All right. But you will still have to go
[1:15:39] to work. So let me be coming gradually.
[1:15:43] Praise the Lord. So Job,
[1:15:47] have you considered my servant Job?
[1:15:50] Satan began to make excuses.
[1:15:53] Yes. How will he not serve you when you
[1:15:55] did this? When you did that, when you
[1:15:58] did that? And the Lord said to what the
[1:16:01] Lord wanted to prove to the devil was
[1:16:04] that Job was too genuine
[1:16:07] to serve me because of physical
[1:16:09] substance.
[1:16:12] Can we serve him because we love him?
[1:16:18] When you serve the Lord because you love
[1:16:20] him, what you have does not affect your
[1:16:23] service.
[1:16:25] Neither what you don't have. Amen.
[1:16:28] Neither will it also affect your
[1:16:30] service.
[1:16:31] When a man is not truly connected with
[1:16:34] God, when he begins to make success, it
[1:16:36] begins to affect his commitment.
[1:16:40] That's right. That is why the prophet
[1:16:41] said, "Money can be a sneer either way."
[1:16:45] If you have it, it can be a snare. If
[1:16:48] you don't have it, it can also be a
[1:16:50] snare. But for the man who is connected
[1:16:53] to God in love,
[1:16:55] nothing is a snare. Because you know why
[1:16:58] he has gotten first the pe of great
[1:17:00] great price.
[1:17:02] Every other thing is not the fountain of
[1:17:05] his joy. They can add to enhance his
[1:17:08] joy, but they are not the source of his
[1:17:10] joy. So that whatever he has or he does
[1:17:13] not have does not move him because he's
[1:17:16] gotten the main thing. This was what God
[1:17:18] wanted to prove by Job. Amen. That
[1:17:22] Satan, you got it wrong.
[1:17:26] Even if you take everything, Job will
[1:17:28] still serve me. Can we take a bet? Satan
[1:17:32] reach out his hand and God reach out his
[1:17:34] hand. They made a bed.
[1:17:36] Now to the devil, he wants to tempt Job.
[1:17:40] To God, he wants to prove Job. Amen.
[1:17:46] Are you here? Amen. God wanted to prove
[1:17:49] to Satan that Job is my son is genuine.
[1:17:53] And Satan wanted to prove to the de to
[1:17:57] God that look job is a fake. When you go
[1:18:01] with a negative mind to attack people,
[1:18:04] that's temptation. When you go with a
[1:18:07] positive mind, that is proven. Right?
[1:18:09] Take for instance, if I went to the
[1:18:11] market to buy this Mac uh to buy this uh
[1:18:14] microphone,
[1:18:16] I don't go with a mind that what I want
[1:18:18] to buy will not work.
[1:18:21] Has anybody gone that way? Unconsciously
[1:18:24] you want to buy something that works. So
[1:18:27] when you are buying it, you say, "Let us
[1:18:29] test it to be sure it's working." Is
[1:18:31] that right? You won't say, "Let's test
[1:18:34] it to be sure it's not working."
[1:18:36] It's an unconscious thing. So you are
[1:18:38] trying to prove that is functioning. But
[1:18:41] when Satan attacks you, he wants to
[1:18:43] prove that you are not functioning. You
[1:18:45] are not genuine. You are fake. So to the
[1:18:48] devil, you are facing temptation. To
[1:18:50] God, he is testing you. Amen.
[1:18:54] God doesn't tempt any man.
[1:18:57] But God test his children.
[1:19:00] And let me tell you when this testing
[1:19:02] will come sometimes God does not have to
[1:19:06] seek your permission or inform you.
[1:19:08] Imagine we are in service tonight and
[1:19:10] there's a there's a conversation going
[1:19:12] on right now between God and Satan over
[1:19:15] somebody. Who is that person tonight?
[1:19:17] Nobody will raise their hand.
[1:19:20] Even me, I would not want to raise my
[1:19:22] hand. But if he force my Lord, I will
[1:19:25] ask for grace. And let me tell you, God
[1:19:28] will not chest out put his chest out for
[1:19:31] you when he knows he hasn't put what it
[1:19:34] takes.
[1:19:38] Are you with me? Anytime God throws or
[1:19:41] allow something to come your way is
[1:19:43] because God knew what he has put there.
[1:19:47] Amen. It's not about you but about his
[1:19:50] own deposit.
[1:19:52] Nobody can withstand any situation but
[1:19:55] God in a man withstand any condition
[1:20:00] because the word has to run correctly
[1:20:03] and believers must know this so that you
[1:20:06] you approach any condition with a
[1:20:09] positive attitude. Are you with me
[1:20:11] brethren? The Bible said there's no
[1:20:14] temptation that is uncommon.
[1:20:16] How many read that in their Bible?
[1:20:19] 1 Corinthians chapter 10. So I say it
[1:20:22] all the time to you. Don't allow the
[1:20:24] devil to jolt you in self-pity.
[1:20:28] When you accept the devil's position
[1:20:30] that you have the most peculiar
[1:20:32] problem,
[1:20:35] problem that doesn't uh peculiar
[1:20:38] personal problem. Three Ps
[1:20:41] problems that don't happen to other
[1:20:43] people but only you. If you ever allow
[1:20:45] the devil to sell that lie to you, he
[1:20:48] has won round one battle in your life.
[1:20:50] You know where he's going? He's going,
[1:20:52] he's trying to bring you to a point of
[1:20:54] complex, right?
[1:20:57] Because he knows that whatever he throws
[1:20:59] your way, as long as you are still
[1:21:02] connected to God, he hasn't won the
[1:21:04] battle and he can never win the battle.
[1:21:07] Let me tell you, there's nothing out
[1:21:09] there. It's just a mirage. The Bible
[1:21:12] said the challenges you are facing, your
[1:21:14] people who are in the world are facing
[1:21:16] it also. It's in the Bible. But you know
[1:21:19] the grace you have, you have the bumper
[1:21:21] of the blood.
[1:21:24] That is why no matter how tough it is,
[1:21:26] it doesn't consume your life. You don't
[1:21:28] contemplate suicide.
[1:21:31] Uh-huh. You look at it, you tell your
[1:21:33] soul, don't worry. The Lord will make a
[1:21:36] way somehow.
[1:21:39] You live a life that confuses the devil.
[1:21:43] That's right. Because it's no longer you
[1:21:46] living.
[1:21:47] A grace has entered. Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] Have the things you go through,
[1:21:55] something go through half of it.
[1:21:58] And yet
[1:22:01] they've terminated it all. So you are
[1:22:04] better off in the house of the Lord.
[1:22:06] No matter what happened, don't ever
[1:22:08] allow the devil to take you out of God's
[1:22:11] presence. Don't ever allow the devil to
[1:22:13] isolate you. Tell the devil, "We will
[1:22:16] stay here.
[1:22:19] We will stay in the presence of God. We
[1:22:22] will serve him." Look at Job response in
[1:22:25] all his situations. How did he respond?
[1:22:28] He responded with worship.
[1:22:31] In order was the devil bring it on. If I
[1:22:34] was pressing God 10 times before, I'm
[1:22:36] going to do it 20 times. You must live a
[1:22:39] life that confuses the devil until he
[1:22:42] doesn't know what to do with you again.
[1:22:47] This is what I'm saying.
[1:22:50] Thank you, Lord. You love him. Am I
[1:22:53] shouting too much? Just bear with me,
[1:22:56] brethren. I'm just feeling good.
[1:22:59] Amen.
[1:23:04] So he said uh
[1:23:08] let me take those things away
[1:23:11] and I will make him curse you to your
[1:23:13] face. That's all the agenda of the
[1:23:16] devil.
[1:23:18] What threw Satan? What make Lucifer to
[1:23:22] become Satan in the beginning was
[1:23:24] worship.
[1:23:26] He wanted it from you. Yes, my sister.
[1:23:29] He wanted it from you. That was what
[1:23:31] contaminated him. He said, "Thou art
[1:23:34] perfect in thy way until iniquity was
[1:23:37] found in you." What was iniquity? An
[1:23:39] attempt to raise his throne
[1:23:42] I above that which is called God. Amen.
[1:23:47] He has achieved that in the world. But
[1:23:49] you see, he's not satisfied because the
[1:23:52] people's worship he really wanted are
[1:23:54] the stars of God. You, you, you, you.
[1:23:58] Thank you, Lord. live a life that tells
[1:24:00] the devil you will die an unsatisfied
[1:24:03] guy because my worship is not going to
[1:24:05] get to you
[1:24:08] and you have a scriptural position for
[1:24:10] that because the Bible said all the
[1:24:12] people of the head will worship him.
[1:24:14] Revelation 13:8 except those whose names
[1:24:18] are in the lamb's book of life.
[1:24:21] [Applause]
[1:24:25] That is why whatever the devil brings
[1:24:27] tell him is not uncommon.
[1:24:30] Don't Yeah, it's not uncommon. Don't
[1:24:32] even judge me to self-pity. I don't live
[1:24:35] in pity party club. There's nothing new
[1:24:38] under the sun. Amen. Whatever has
[1:24:41] happened, whatever is happening now has
[1:24:43] happened before. And if there be a
[1:24:45] tomorrow, there will be a repeat of
[1:24:46] cycles.
[1:24:49] But do you know the Bible told us, "But
[1:24:51] God is faithful." Amen. How many say
[1:24:53] amen to that tonight? How many believe
[1:24:55] God is faithful? Wave your hand to
[1:24:58] Jesus. Say, "God is faithful." Wave your
[1:25:01] hand to Jesus. Say, "God is faithful."
[1:25:03] God is faithful. Hallelujah. What is the
[1:25:06] proof of his faithfulness? Two things.
[1:25:08] He will not allow you to be tempted
[1:25:12] above what you are able to bear. Come
[1:25:15] on.
[1:25:17] Did you see that? Meaning that whatever
[1:25:19] God permit, he has put the capacity.
[1:25:24] You have some grace that you yourself
[1:25:26] don't realize you have. Church, listen
[1:25:28] to me tonight. Shall I prove it to you?
[1:25:30] Okay.
[1:25:32] He say we will leave here tomorrow
[1:25:34] night.
[1:25:36] You have some grace. I say you have that
[1:25:38] you don't even realize you have. Now one
[1:25:42] day the Bible said God came down to
[1:25:45] Gideon.
[1:25:49] You ever read the story of Gideon? Now
[1:25:52] at the time the Lord came down to
[1:25:54] Gideon, Gideon was acting like a coward.
[1:25:59] Did you notice that
[1:26:01] he had a little harvest
[1:26:04] and he couldn't t his harvest at the
[1:26:08] treing floor, you know, to beat out the
[1:26:11] leaves and so forth and get his wheat.
[1:26:14] The Bible said because of the fear of
[1:26:17] the Medidianites.
[1:26:19] So he had to camouflage and do a decoy.
[1:26:22] Instead of using the treing floor, he
[1:26:24] went to the wine press to hide it from
[1:26:27] the medianites.
[1:26:30] So he was a man found in a state of fear
[1:26:33] and cowardice. But when God came down,
[1:26:36] how did God address Gideon?
[1:26:39] Bible.
[1:26:43] Did God say Gideon, thou coward? No, he
[1:26:46] said Gideon thou mighty man of valor.
[1:26:50] Even Gideon himself had to say mighty
[1:26:52] man of valor.
[1:26:55] He will have to look at him twice. What
[1:26:57] is mighty? What is me that is hiding
[1:27:01] what I had
[1:27:03] to hide it from medianites.
[1:27:06] So that means God must have been seeing
[1:27:09] what others didn't see. Yeah, God must
[1:27:12] have been seeing what Gideon himself
[1:27:15] did not see. And the Bible told Samuel,
[1:27:18] you see, God does not see as men see it.
[1:27:22] You see yourself unable and
[1:27:24] insufficient, but God is looking at you
[1:27:27] and said, this is a champion.
[1:27:30] This is a victor.
[1:27:32] This is a princess. This is a prince.
[1:27:36] This is a king. This is a queen. this
[1:27:39] will rule and reign.
[1:27:43] You can say I'm not fantasizing. I'm
[1:27:45] proving my case by the scripture.
[1:27:49] He said Gideon, thou mighty man of
[1:27:52] valor, the Lord is with thee.
[1:27:55] And Gideon was in a state of cowardice.
[1:27:58] Maybe when the angel even came down, he
[1:28:00] thought it was a medianite. He quickly
[1:28:03] said, "Come, I want to talk to you."
[1:28:08] So if God permits anything is because he
[1:28:11] has put it inside you.
[1:28:14] And when you read the story of Gideon,
[1:28:16] which one eventually happened? Was it
[1:28:19] his coward eyes or his ve?
[1:28:23] When he gathered 30,000 people or so God
[1:28:25] said, uh, you don't need that much. He
[1:28:28] keep thinning down the ground or they
[1:28:30] thinned it down to 300. He said, "By the
[1:28:32] hand of this 300, I will put all the
[1:28:35] whole of Median into your hands." And
[1:28:37] they came back to prove that indeed what
[1:28:40] God said of him was the right thing.
[1:28:48] So if God allowed anything is because he
[1:28:51] has approved of you, he knew what he
[1:28:53] deposited in there. So allow God a
[1:28:57] chance. This is why you will look at the
[1:28:59] face of any challenge and say I can
[1:29:02] handle it.
[1:29:04] And somebody will say you are arrogant
[1:29:05] and say no you are not getting it. I'm
[1:29:07] not arrogant. If God brings it my way is
[1:29:10] because I can handle it.
[1:29:13] So how will you do it? I don't know. But
[1:29:16] the one who brought it will release it.
[1:29:21] Challenges will provoke
[1:29:24] the grace that is in you. Amen. and you
[1:29:28] begin to do exploits the things you
[1:29:30] ordinarily cannot do. Amen. It didn't
[1:29:33] fly from outside. It's already within.
[1:29:40] So the Lord told Satan's is in your
[1:29:43] hands. Do whatever you want. Let's see.
[1:29:47] And the Bible said just in one day four
[1:29:50] calamities that affected everything Job
[1:29:53] had happened.
[1:29:55] He lost his children. He lost his
[1:29:57] business. He lost his wealth. He lost
[1:30:01] his assets.
[1:30:04] One day before one finish the news,
[1:30:06] another one is coming. Before one
[1:30:08] finished, another one is coming. Job was
[1:30:11] a man of like passion as you are.
[1:30:17] How many of us ever confronted a
[1:30:19] challenge that much? Raise your hand.
[1:30:23] Nobody. Thanks be to God.
[1:30:26] So you have no reason to give up on God.
[1:30:30] You have no reason to child God
[1:30:32] foolishly. You have no reason to say I'm
[1:30:35] no longer serving God.
[1:30:37] When you faint in the hour of adversity
[1:30:40] is because your strength is small or you
[1:30:43] have no strength at all. It's high time
[1:30:46] we told ourselves the truth because the
[1:30:48] coming of the Lord is so close.
[1:30:51] Sometimes when people are confronting
[1:30:53] challenges, the pastor is nervous
[1:30:55] whether they are going to serve the Lord
[1:30:57] or not and they themselves are glory in
[1:30:59] it. If all your years the word hasn't
[1:31:02] fortified you to be able to stand,
[1:31:05] something is wrong.
[1:31:07] Amen. It wasn't angels who said, "What
[1:31:11] shall separate us from the love of God?"
[1:31:13] It was martyrs like you. Morts like me
[1:31:17] and dozens were written for our
[1:31:19] examples.
[1:31:20] in order to resurrect our own faith that
[1:31:23] these things are possible
[1:31:30] and everything collapsed in one day. And
[1:31:33] the Bible said after Job heard all the
[1:31:36] news, he went to the house of the Lord,
[1:31:39] I have decided to follow Jesus.
[1:31:43] No turning back. No. If you turn back,
[1:31:46] you won't be where Job is.
[1:31:50] That's why the prophet said, "You must
[1:31:52] remember you want to be in the same
[1:31:53] heaven that they went." And these
[1:31:56] stories were not myth. They were the
[1:31:57] truth. They happened.
[1:32:01] Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] All right.
[1:32:06] The Bible said
[1:32:08] he worshiped and never tried God
[1:32:11] foolishly.
[1:32:12] He did not even complain. He did not
[1:32:14] even say, "Why me Lord?"
[1:32:18] That will be the special number of some
[1:32:20] of us for the next three Sundays. Why me
[1:32:23] Lord?
[1:32:25] Why me Lord? If it is not you point who
[1:32:28] should be who it should be
[1:32:32] and the problem started from the church.
[1:32:36] The devil went back to the next service
[1:32:38] and he made Job in service. Amen. your
[1:32:41] ears. Read your Bible because he came
[1:32:45] back again and God said how far.
[1:32:50] I like it. If God will say how far
[1:32:53] and the devil will be found one thing,
[1:32:55] he will not have any answer to give. Say
[1:32:59] how far. Job is in service tonight. He
[1:33:02] sang like never before. He worshiped me
[1:33:05] like never before. He said amen like
[1:33:07] nothing happened. He rejoice in the
[1:33:10] spirit. Can you say that guy is not
[1:33:12] fake? He's genuine.
[1:33:16] True to Satan's type.
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:21] It's because it was his assets.
[1:33:26] It's because we touch secondary things.
[1:33:28] If we go for the primary thing which is
[1:33:30] himself, all that a man has, he will
[1:33:33] give for his life.
[1:33:37] God told Satan, you are an incurable
[1:33:39] optimist, but in this one will prove to
[1:33:43] you that you will fail. Okay, go ahead
[1:33:45] again and touch Job. He's in service
[1:33:50] tonight. Do everything you want to do,
[1:33:52] but the only thing is I won't give you
[1:33:54] his life.
[1:33:57] The trials, the challenges are not meant
[1:33:59] to consume you.
[1:34:03] Your life is too precious for God to
[1:34:05] joke with.
[1:34:07] So don't say, "Oh, this thing will kill
[1:34:09] me." It won't kill you. If you die, it's
[1:34:12] your body obeying your own confession.
[1:34:15] The intention of God is simply to prove
[1:34:20] Then you begin to wonder why is all
[1:34:22] these things?
[1:34:25] Why? We will see the end. We see the
[1:34:28] results. Now Job was so dealt with. He
[1:34:32] became so bad until he had to be
[1:34:35] quarantined. He couldn't stay inside the
[1:34:38] house. They have to put him on a harsh
[1:34:40] eve where he could get the pot shots to
[1:34:43] be scraping himself. The sickness he had
[1:34:46] defied all known medical
[1:34:50] help of that time. Now this is where I'm
[1:34:52] going. until his own friends, his own
[1:34:56] co-believers,
[1:34:58] colleagues in the church, the prophet
[1:35:00] called them his church members
[1:35:04] until when they came the condition in
[1:35:07] which they met their brother Joe left
[1:35:11] them in shock and in a temporary coma
[1:35:14] for seven days. You came and said we
[1:35:17] don't know this is the level. Ah and for
[1:35:20] the next seven days they couldn't close
[1:35:22] their mouth.
[1:35:24] Read your Bible. The Bible said for
[1:35:26] seven days they couldn't talk.
[1:35:30] They were in shock day one, day two, day
[1:35:34] three. Meaning they were on that spot.
[1:35:36] They themselves could not get up and eat
[1:35:38] when they saw what the damage the devil
[1:35:41] has done to a life. As somebody in shock
[1:35:44] as somebody be shocked for your life for
[1:35:46] 24 hours.
[1:35:50] Let's be drawing comparison so that you
[1:35:53] know that sometimes the thing that walk
[1:35:54] you up, you want to kill yourself or you
[1:35:56] want to stop church, you want to start
[1:35:58] serving God for it's not worth it.
[1:36:03] For seven days
[1:36:06] those brethren were in shock. It's in
[1:36:08] the Bible. If the Bible said it, I
[1:36:10] believe it.
[1:36:12] Meaning for one whole week, nobody could
[1:36:15] talk. They were just looking
[1:36:20] When they eventually got themselves
[1:36:23] back,
[1:36:25] brother Job, what happened?
[1:36:31] And brother Job explained what happened.
[1:36:34] But as true to the nature of men,
[1:36:39] they said, "Bro,
[1:36:42] tell the truth.
[1:36:45] Your story is not hard enough. God is
[1:36:48] not this mean.
[1:36:50] If nothing is wrong in your life, ah,
[1:36:53] God will never allow a degeneration to
[1:36:57] this level. Brother Joe, be sincere.
[1:37:03] This is the position we all take
[1:37:06] many a time when you find people in bad
[1:37:10] situations,
[1:37:11] the first thing that comes to us as an
[1:37:13] instinct, they've done something wrong.
[1:37:17] Look at that man that was born blind.
[1:37:20] Do you remember? He was born blind, no
[1:37:23] eyes at all. The first response was
[1:37:26] Jesus who sinned. Yeah.
[1:37:30] Nobody thought of a possibility that
[1:37:32] could God have wanted to do something
[1:37:36] spectacular by this. It was all sin.
[1:37:40] Judgment. Judgment.
[1:37:44] Is it his father? mother, grandfather,
[1:37:46] grandmother. Jesus said, "Save your
[1:37:48] breath." Nobody sinned. To hear that
[1:37:51] nobody sinned and that man was in that
[1:37:54] condition was a shock to them. Because
[1:37:57] they don't believe somebody can go
[1:38:00] through that without being a sinner.
[1:38:04] Brethren, let's learn lessons
[1:38:08] because your perception of people's
[1:38:11] situation will determine how you
[1:38:13] respond.
[1:38:18] God bless you man. It will determine
[1:38:20] your response to people.
[1:38:23] You can be a miserable comforter and you
[1:38:26] can be a genuine comforter. It is how
[1:38:29] you settled down to take to perceive
[1:38:32] their challenges. Let me tell the church
[1:38:34] tonight it is not every bad situation
[1:38:37] that is as a result of sin. Amen.
[1:38:43] This is why the prophet taught us a
[1:38:45] lesson people overlook sometimes. He
[1:38:47] said, "No matter how thin you slice
[1:38:49] anything," Amen. The thinnest thing you
[1:38:52] can think about is the edge of a paper
[1:38:55] which you hardly may see. Right?
[1:38:58] Excuse me, church.
[1:39:00] This is a paper, right? Are you able to
[1:39:02] see the edge properly? It's so thin. Are
[1:39:05] you get it? So no matter how you slice
[1:39:08] this paper, it will always have two
[1:39:10] sides.
[1:39:14] This was the principle of the prophet to
[1:39:17] bring the word to us.
[1:39:20] And until you as a church learn that
[1:39:22] principle, you will judge things wrongly
[1:39:27] and you will be acting in wrong thinking
[1:39:29] you are righteous. Yeah.
[1:39:34] If you don't have a full understanding
[1:39:36] of a situation, be careful to judge.
[1:39:40] That is why the prophet said when you
[1:39:42] hear anything, he said don't believe it.
[1:39:45] Listen to me. He's not saying you are
[1:39:47] calling the brother a liar.
[1:39:51] But it will help you to hold your breath
[1:39:53] first and hear the other side before you
[1:39:57] form an opinion. Otherwise, you can
[1:39:59] contaminate your vessel.
[1:40:03] That's right. It's a simple instruction,
[1:40:06] but we don't do it. Uhhuh. And that is
[1:40:10] why it's easy for many of us to go into
[1:40:12] complex even against an innocent person.
[1:40:15] Right? It's already a victim of lie.
[1:40:18] Then you make him a victim of your own
[1:40:19] complex. Right?
[1:40:24] Because sometimes the things you hear or
[1:40:26] you heard are not correct.
[1:40:31] Some of us cannot even hold up in the
[1:40:34] defense of our brother and say no I do
[1:40:36] not agree. I do not believe he can do
[1:40:38] that. Let's let let him prove let him
[1:40:41] tell me by himself.
[1:40:44] That's what the prophet said we should
[1:40:46] do. Make excuse for one another.
[1:40:52] When you even pray, you intercede for
[1:40:54] somebody. He said when they do you even
[1:40:56] wrong, he said you go before God and say
[1:40:58] Lord it doesn't mean to do it. Uhhuh.
[1:41:02] You make excuse for your brother before
[1:41:04] the Lord. That is a Christian victory.
[1:41:07] That is the arch. Amen. That has become
[1:41:10] victorious. That is a man who will be an
[1:41:12] Israelite indeed in whom there is no
[1:41:14] guy.
[1:41:18] Sometimes you carry hurts and wounds
[1:41:20] that are not yours simply because of
[1:41:23] what you heard and you are not ready to
[1:41:26] do anything about it.
[1:41:29] It pays to serve Jesus. It pays to obey
[1:41:32] the word.
[1:41:34] This was the problem of these brethren.
[1:41:38] And this problem, let me tell you how
[1:41:40] great it was. It took them 30 chapters
[1:41:43] in the Bible. Yeah. Go read the book of
[1:41:46] Job because they premised their
[1:41:49] assumption on the wrong thing. All the
[1:41:52] activity, all their quotations, it is
[1:41:55] written and it is written that they were
[1:41:57] doing with Job for 30 chapters was based
[1:42:00] on falsehood.
[1:42:04] That is how dangerous it is. This is why
[1:42:07] the Bible said, "Prove all things and
[1:42:10] hold to what is right." Amen.
[1:42:13] You can't enjoy this Christianity if you
[1:42:16] are not sincere. If you are not honest
[1:42:19] with your fellow man, you can't be
[1:42:22] honest with your God.
[1:42:28] It is true
[1:42:30] that sin may be a possibility to bring
[1:42:33] that but that is just one way to look at
[1:42:35] it.
[1:42:37] Are you catching it? Yeah. The other
[1:42:39] side of the coin is that it is not in
[1:42:44] all cases that it is as a result of sin.
[1:42:47] God may permit certain things for
[1:42:50] certain purposes.
[1:42:53] When Israelite finds themsel before the
[1:42:55] Red Sea and Pharaoh behind, were they
[1:42:57] the one who brought themselves to that
[1:42:58] close up? Answer me church. They were
[1:43:02] following the pillar of fire and the
[1:43:04] pillar of fire brought them to a dead
[1:43:06] end. Now a natural man will look at that
[1:43:09] and say these are poor guys who don't
[1:43:10] know their way. But don't forget they
[1:43:13] follow the pillar of fire and God's path
[1:43:15] led them to that place. He led them to a
[1:43:17] place where Pharaoh will close them
[1:43:20] behind. There will be valleys and hills
[1:43:22] and mountains on this side. Nowhere to
[1:43:24] turn.
[1:43:26] When you find yourself in the situation,
[1:43:29] just find out how you go there. If you
[1:43:31] have checked yourself and you find
[1:43:34] nothing wrong, stand still.
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:38] Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] And don't accept don't accept the
[1:43:45] verdict of men.
[1:43:47] Are you listening to me? What kept Job
[1:43:51] was his refusal to accept the verdict of
[1:43:53] his friends.
[1:43:56] The prophet said he searched himself. He
[1:43:59] knew there was nothing wrong. He said,
[1:44:01] "A man who asserts himself, who knew
[1:44:04] there was nothing wrong, you can't force
[1:44:06] him to accept a wrong."
[1:44:11] You can't make him a sinner more than
[1:44:14] God has taken him out. No sir.
[1:44:18] And because he refused to accept, he
[1:44:20] said, "I've searched myself. There's
[1:44:22] nothing wrong." And his friends kept
[1:44:24] saying, "There is something wrong.
[1:44:28] There is something wrong. Search
[1:44:30] further. Probe further. He kept probing
[1:44:34] until there was nothing to probe again.
[1:44:36] They got to the bottom of the sea.
[1:44:38] Nowhere to go. They said, "No, go get
[1:44:40] dynamite and blow further. You must get
[1:44:43] something."
[1:44:45] That is when you begin to even invent
[1:44:47] things that are not existing, right?
[1:44:50] Simply
[1:44:51] because they said they said they said
[1:44:57] all these years we are living on they
[1:44:58] said what did the word say
[1:45:04] there will always be they said that is
[1:45:07] why you must know what the word say and
[1:45:09] whatever the word say let it be your
[1:45:11] anchor let every man's word be alive
[1:45:14] Amen.
[1:45:19] He stood on that and for 30 chapters in
[1:45:23] the Bible or so these guys kept pounding
[1:45:26] hard on one thing. You are a secret
[1:45:28] sinner.
[1:45:31] And they will say it with such fancy
[1:45:34] with such vigor with such quotations
[1:45:37] from Bible from the message.
[1:45:40] Quotations are pure. Yeah, the Bible
[1:45:43] verses are pure but your application of
[1:45:45] it is impure
[1:45:49] because once you come on the wrong
[1:45:51] foundation
[1:45:52] your quotations will be applied wrongly.
[1:45:58] Are you catching it?
[1:46:01] And they messed up the whole thing
[1:46:05] until Elio came down. Right?
[1:46:10] Sometimes we all need that elu in our
[1:46:12] lives. And let me tell you a will always
[1:46:15] come.
[1:46:17] Maybe you are having a leu tonight.
[1:46:20] He will always show up. If you are a
[1:46:23] child of God, there will be somebody who
[1:46:25] will come and repair damaged altars.
[1:46:31] When everything has been messed up,
[1:46:34] there will always be somebody. Amen. God
[1:46:37] will always show up. The prophet
[1:46:41] sometimes initially was saying I can
[1:46:44] show to you that that alou represent
[1:46:46] Christ. Then finally he said that alou
[1:46:48] was Christ.
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] He probably used the body of a young
[1:46:56] man. Amen. But that was Christ speaking
[1:46:59] in there. You know why? Before God can
[1:47:03] perform anything, he must set things in
[1:47:06] order.
[1:47:10] But those friends becoming miserable
[1:47:11] comforter. They have messed up the altar
[1:47:16] like the prophets of bell from morning
[1:47:19] till evening. Caught themselves very
[1:47:22] emotional.
[1:47:23] Destroyed the tables and yet fire never
[1:47:26] came down.
[1:47:28] It took one man before Elijah could
[1:47:31] bring down the fire of God. The Bible
[1:47:33] said at the evening time, what did he
[1:47:34] do? He repaired the altar of the Lord.
[1:47:38] When the altar is repaired, it becomes
[1:47:40] easy for God to operate. Your life must
[1:47:43] be set in order. Your mindset must
[1:47:46] change.
[1:47:47] That's right. Did you hear me? Your
[1:47:50] mindset must change. And it takes a word
[1:47:52] to do that. Maybe the word is resetting
[1:47:55] some minds tonight. Amen. Praise the
[1:47:58] Lord. If you accept the visitation of
[1:48:00] the Lord, you are getting prepared for
[1:48:03] your divine intervention. Because when
[1:48:05] Jesus comes, the tempter's power is
[1:48:07] broken. Gloominess are taken away. Your
[1:48:10] life will be filled with glory.
[1:48:12] Everything is about to turn around for
[1:48:13] better. When Jesus come to stay, glory,
[1:48:18] you must accept the verdict of the word.
[1:48:21] Thank you, Lord. Let every man's world
[1:48:23] be a lie. I don't want no man to be more
[1:48:26] successful in my life than God himself.
[1:48:29] Did you hear me? Yes. Because no man
[1:48:31] brought me in and none will take me out.
[1:48:36] Amen. If I do not interact with you,
[1:48:38] nothing suffers. But if I don't interact
[1:48:40] with him, everything suffers.
[1:48:43] Amen.
[1:48:45] We must accept the verdict of the word.
[1:48:48] Thank you, Jesus. El came down. He
[1:48:51] placed those friends where they belong.
[1:48:54] Friends, this is the grace and
[1:48:57] revelation you must have that even when
[1:48:59] things even look bad around a believer.
[1:49:03] Listen to me. Eternity is always playing
[1:49:06] in the background.
[1:49:09] There is never a time that God has ever
[1:49:13] left your life to a chance. Hallelujah.
[1:49:16] Because the prophet said, you are not
[1:49:18] even a product of chance in coming to
[1:49:22] the earth. It's a quotation. You didn't
[1:49:25] come by accident. And I believe that.
[1:49:29] You are a child of purpose. And
[1:49:32] everything that will aid that purpose in
[1:49:35] your life will happen in your life, good
[1:49:37] and bad. This is the meaning of all
[1:49:40] things work.
[1:49:42] Oh my. May God reveal it to the church.
[1:49:44] He said, "And we know it's annoying
[1:49:49] that all things work together for good,
[1:49:55] not for everybody,
[1:49:57] to them who love the Lord, to them who
[1:50:00] are the called. You see what you should
[1:50:03] expend your energy on is to find make
[1:50:05] your calling and election sure to be
[1:50:07] sure you are the called. If you are the
[1:50:09] called, sit pretty, sleep tight.
[1:50:13] Nothing will get out of ket.
[1:50:18] Hallelujah.
[1:50:20] This is the assurance of the believers.
[1:50:24] I've never seen any seed of God in the
[1:50:28] Bible.
[1:50:29] Even though sometimes with their
[1:50:32] mistakes so bad that God never came
[1:50:35] through for that you never see a purpose
[1:50:39] of God in their life.
[1:50:41] Can you take it tonight?
[1:50:46] Naomi,
[1:50:48] you see I'm coming to my friend,
[1:50:51] but I'm referring to the one in the
[1:50:52] Bible now. You remember that married
[1:50:56] that gave birth to Malon and Chillion,
[1:50:59] right? They went out of Bethlehem
[1:51:04] contrary to divine instruction of the
[1:51:06] word.
[1:51:09] Hallelujah. Now when they went out, Na
[1:51:14] by our testimony said they lost all.
[1:51:16] Isn't it right?
[1:51:19] Why did God allowed why did God spank
[1:51:22] them? Because they walked contrary to
[1:51:24] the word that they knew.
[1:51:27] Yeah. When you walk contrary to the word
[1:51:30] that God taught you, that's
[1:51:32] disobedience. But you see what you must
[1:51:35] not get too carried away
[1:51:38] because that's just a sight to look at
[1:51:40] it. The other side is that God permitted
[1:51:44] that thing. Right?
[1:51:47] You say God permitted it. I'm telling
[1:51:49] you that there is no lie. There's no
[1:51:52] time your life was ever abandoned. Amen.
[1:51:55] If you are a seed of God in your good,
[1:51:57] in your bad, coach me, I'm on record.
[1:52:00] Eternity is running in the background.
[1:52:06] And I'm defending my case by the word.
[1:52:10] There was no other way root could have
[1:52:12] come in. That's right.
[1:52:15] If they had not gone to Moab,
[1:52:18] he said, but God could have done it in
[1:52:20] another way. But God didn't do it
[1:52:21] another way.
[1:52:23] Yes, I know he can do it, but he didn't
[1:52:25] do it another This is the way he chose
[1:52:27] to do it.
[1:52:30] Uhhuh.
[1:52:33] You see that? You see that even you see
[1:52:36] that the only choice you have as a
[1:52:38] believer is to accept the will of God.
[1:52:41] The verdict of the word. If you do
[1:52:44] contrary, God will still have his way.
[1:52:47] Brother Abraham said, Job by his own
[1:52:50] testimony said, "What I feared was what
[1:52:53] came upon me." Is that right? Yes. But
[1:52:56] God is going to use that even though
[1:52:58] that was the outlet through which the
[1:53:01] problem came, God is going to use that
[1:53:02] to rewrite the word. That's right. For
[1:53:05] us tonight, God still used that to bring
[1:53:08] Job to an expected end.
[1:53:11] Glory. Because you will realize that at
[1:53:14] the end of the day, Job was pushed. All
[1:53:17] his trials, all his experiences was just
[1:53:20] a pudging. There was nothing he lost
[1:53:23] that he never gained back. Right? The
[1:53:25] Bible says Samson killed more in his
[1:53:27] dying than when he was alive. He was
[1:53:30] more victorious in death.
[1:53:34] Can you beat that? And tell you friends,
[1:53:37] if Samson never elected to die with the
[1:53:40] Philistines, he will come out of that
[1:53:42] rubble. You'll be wondering how he did
[1:53:44] it.
[1:53:48] Do you know all the lords of the
[1:53:49] Philistines? Everybody was in that place
[1:53:53] and they wiped all of them out.
[1:53:56] A child of God. Brother Arab said, "You
[1:53:58] can never lose. There's nothing to
[1:54:00] lose." Now watch. When Naami was coming
[1:54:04] back, he brought this lady they call
[1:54:06] Ruth.
[1:54:09] If you don't know how important Ruth
[1:54:11] was.
[1:54:13] If there was no root, you would not be
[1:54:15] here tonight. That's right.
[1:54:18] Because Ruth was the beginning of the
[1:54:20] path of the savior.
[1:54:24] And Ruth was a moabitete,
[1:54:26] a wash pot. You see that God doesn't see
[1:54:29] as messy.
[1:54:33] When she brought into the economy of
[1:54:35] redemption, all those passed was
[1:54:38] redeemed.
[1:54:40] Uhhuh. Rea became another one. the
[1:54:43] harlot.
[1:54:45] She became the second woman and they
[1:54:47] were all Gentiles.
[1:54:50] Through these two women, the path of the
[1:54:52] savior was paved.
[1:54:55] That was how important Ruth was to the
[1:54:58] economy of God. And it took a Naomi's
[1:55:01] disobedience to bring her inside. No
[1:55:04] matter how thin you slice, it will have
[1:55:07] two sides. Amen. Amen.
[1:55:12] Brother Abraham said he will look at you
[1:55:15] and he say you will say Jonah was out of
[1:55:17] the will of God by going to Tashes
[1:55:20] instead of going straight to Ninv. He
[1:55:22] said let me tell you you are wrong. He
[1:55:24] was never out of the will of God.
[1:55:27] And that looks rude isn't it? Now but
[1:55:30] you ask yourself a question. God told
[1:55:33] Jonah where to go. Did he tell you how
[1:55:35] he will get Jonah to that place? Come
[1:55:38] on. Huh? When he showed Joseph that he
[1:55:42] was going to be a ruler, did he reveal
[1:55:43] the way? Joseph will walk through to get
[1:55:46] into that expected end.
[1:55:49] If he showed the way, do you think
[1:55:51] Joseph will want to go? He said, if it
[1:55:54] will take all this, I don't want
[1:55:57] But can we trust God tonight? The
[1:56:00] thought I have towards you is the
[1:56:02] thought of good and not of evil to bring
[1:56:06] you to an expected expected an end that
[1:56:11] has been determined that God sits down
[1:56:13] and he was anticipating
[1:56:16] that's the that's the meaning
[1:56:19] and God so trust his own work he say it
[1:56:21] won't fail he must come to that
[1:56:23] if you like throw him into the dungeon
[1:56:25] Joseph will get to Egypt if you like
[1:56:28] take him to Portifers house he will get
[1:56:30] to Egypt let wife did what he did he
[1:56:34] will get to Egypt from there to the
[1:56:35] prison God say you are bringing him even
[1:56:37] closer
[1:56:39] so it's only God that is not nervous
[1:56:41] because he knew that end from the
[1:56:44] beginning he was expecting it and that's
[1:56:47] the story of your life
[1:56:53] so here was Joe
[1:56:57] and Helu was repairing in everything.
[1:57:00] When Elu finished the ground became
[1:57:03] clear for God to come down.
[1:57:08] I think God is helping us to arrive very
[1:57:09] fast now. Don't worry, you soon go now.
[1:57:13] Then when God arrived, God went to the
[1:57:16] three friends of Job. All those your 30
[1:57:19] chapters of treaties, you have not
[1:57:21] represented me well.
[1:57:25] So it was a waste of time. But we can
[1:57:28] learn a lesson from it. Oh yes.
[1:57:33] Because the foundation upon which they
[1:57:36] were approaching Job was faulty.
[1:57:39] They were approaching Job like a sinner.
[1:57:42] So their counel will be the counel to
[1:57:44] the sinner.
[1:57:46] Are you getting it? Their counel had no
[1:57:48] grace
[1:57:50] until they started fighting with him.
[1:57:53] The hardest to repent is the minister.
[1:57:56] Job. You are the wise minister. Now it
[1:57:58] is your turn. You will preach to us. We
[1:58:00] should repent. You yourself you can
[1:58:02] repent.
[1:58:04] And Job will say what will I repent of?
[1:58:08] Tell me. And you should know. Search.
[1:58:11] Search. He say I've search. He say
[1:58:12] search.
[1:58:14] Search. Say look at your back. Get a
[1:58:17] mirror and search your back. He search
[1:58:19] everything because you see yourself. You
[1:58:20] are not sincere. 30 chapters or so.
[1:58:26] God came down and said, "You have not
[1:58:27] represented me." Well,
[1:58:33] that man you call a secret sinner.
[1:58:37] I have a deal for you.
[1:58:39] If you want me to forgive you, if you
[1:58:41] don't want me to be annoyed with you and
[1:58:42] deal with you,
[1:58:44] go and meet him now to pray for you. For
[1:58:49] only his prayer will I accept.
[1:58:53] Amen.
[1:58:59] Do you realize what that means? Job had
[1:59:01] the monopoly for the pardon and
[1:59:04] redemption of his friend. If they go to
[1:59:07] pastor one, they are wasting their time.
[1:59:10] If they come to me, wasting their time.
[1:59:12] If they went to father Abraham because
[1:59:15] Abraham and Job they were
[1:59:16] contemporaries. They lived in the same
[1:59:18] era.
[1:59:21] Mhm.
[1:59:23] He lived in the far east. Abraham lived
[1:59:25] in another direction. That's why it is
[1:59:27] said that Job is the oldest book of the
[1:59:29] Bible because it was a book that dated
[1:59:32] back to Genesis season.
[1:59:35] So if they went to Abraham, the covenant
[1:59:38] holder, they will not their prayer will
[1:59:40] not be accepted. God said, "If you want
[1:59:43] me not to deal with you, that man you
[1:59:46] call secret sinner for about 30
[1:59:48] chapters, go and meet him. Let him pray
[1:59:52] for you. Only his prayer will I accept.
[1:59:56] Now you think Job has had trials.
[2:00:00] No, this is the biggest trial.
[2:00:05] Those of you carry hot, you'll be in
[2:00:07] trouble. Now
[2:00:11] the prophet said, "It is when you lose
[2:00:13] the love of God in your heart, that is
[2:00:16] when you can no longer overlook people's
[2:00:18] mistake.
[2:00:21] It's a quotation.
[2:00:25] Those of you are waiting to get to
[2:00:27] heaven before you settle certain thing.
[2:00:29] The very sign that you will not be
[2:00:31] there.
[2:00:34] If there's anything to settle, it has
[2:00:36] got to be here.
[2:00:39] Say he hurt me. He hurt me badly. He
[2:00:42] hurt me. You see the more you are
[2:00:43] repeating it, the more you are getting
[2:00:45] hurt.
[2:00:50] Yeah,
[2:00:52] it's it's quing quiet. I like the
[2:00:55] quietness, but let it sink. The more you
[2:00:58] are repeating it, the more the earth is
[2:01:01] getting deep.
[2:01:03] Why don't you say it's not a big deal?
[2:01:08] How many will go say it's not a big deal
[2:01:10] tonight?
[2:01:11] Say Lord, it's not a big deal. I will
[2:01:13] let go. If you don't find that grace
[2:01:16] yet, you need to come to the altar
[2:01:18] tonight.
[2:01:20] Are you listening to me? The prophet
[2:01:22] said, "If you carry hot in your heart,
[2:01:24] you are walking over the dangers and the
[2:01:26] leads of hell."
[2:01:32] It's for time. We can read all those
[2:01:34] things. They are here.
[2:01:37] The word is a is a pudger. Is a cleaner.
[2:01:45] Steven at the cost of his life. Are you
[2:01:49] here? Has anybody pointed gun at you?
[2:01:53] They've stoned you. They've mimed you.
[2:01:57] They've tried to overrun you with car.
[2:01:59] I'm asking questions.
[2:02:01] Somebody has aimed your life and
[2:02:03] intentionally say, "I want to get you
[2:02:06] killed."
[2:02:09] But Steven was being killed.
[2:02:12] Huh? You think it's easy to absorb the
[2:02:17] strength of stones on your body?
[2:02:19] And you want to go to the same heaven
[2:02:21] Steven went. Uh-huh. And in the face of
[2:02:24] death, what did he say? Father, lay it
[2:02:26] not to their charge.
[2:02:31] How many can say that?
[2:02:34] If you haven't come to such an act, you
[2:02:37] need to be born again.
[2:02:42] That is why the prophet said it takes
[2:02:43] perfect love.
[2:02:49] And he said perfect love. When your love
[2:02:51] is perfected,
[2:02:53] you will extend grace and mercy to those
[2:02:56] who cannot repay it back. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:59] Amen. Brother Abraham in the message
[2:03:01] adoption said it is not a case of
[2:03:03] scratch my back I will scratch yours. He
[2:03:07] said if I scratch yours and you cannot
[2:03:09] scratch mine. It's good.
[2:03:11] If if there's a need again I will still
[2:03:14] scratch yours. He said if you hit me and
[2:03:16] slap me and your back is aching. I will
[2:03:19] say while nursing the pains of your I'm
[2:03:22] still counting stars from your slap. He
[2:03:24] said bring me your back. I will scratch
[2:03:25] it for you. Uhhuh.
[2:03:29] When you incubating and nursing all, you
[2:03:31] think you are carrying a good gift. You
[2:03:33] are carrying something that will destroy
[2:03:34] you.
[2:03:36] If you understand the simple teachings
[2:03:39] of Jesus,
[2:03:40] you will let go and let God.
[2:03:44] Jesus gave you a huffer tonight. He
[2:03:46] said, "Forgive and I will forgive you."
[2:03:48] It's clear in the scripture. He said,
[2:03:50] "If you don't, I will also not." That's
[2:03:52] right. So, what hinders you is not all
[2:03:56] those is not sin. is not the great your
[2:03:58] the greatest hindrance of a believer is
[2:04:00] carrying art in their hearts
[2:04:06] and let me tell you toes will be stepped
[2:04:08] upon as long as you relate with one
[2:04:10] another in the body toes will be stepped
[2:04:12] upon
[2:04:14] you are and you must be forgiven
[2:04:18] he said when you lose the love of God
[2:04:21] you don't you won't overlook people's
[2:04:23] fault again
[2:04:26] you want to carry. It hurt me so badly.
[2:04:28] I ain't going to have nothing to do with
[2:04:30] that fellow all my life. You go to hell
[2:04:32] all your life.
[2:04:34] Sorry,
[2:04:36] I'm speaking raw. Right. I speak
[2:04:39] politely here. I'm an African man, but
[2:04:42] I'm a Christian. Yes, sir.
[2:04:47] You carry all in your heart because now
[2:04:50] you think Job has had the most terrible
[2:04:52] trials. No, sir. The biggest one is what
[2:04:55] he's facing now.
[2:04:58] Because for a people who had accused him
[2:05:00] wrongly and falsely and pounded him so
[2:05:04] hard with unkind words
[2:05:08] and became miserable comporter, meaning
[2:05:10] that they turn his life to misery.
[2:05:14] Oh yes. Just picture it a little
[2:05:19] and snap out of your complexes tonight.
[2:05:23] For a people who have done that, God say
[2:05:26] they should come to him and he should
[2:05:28] pray for them.
[2:05:30] And the prophet said before you can pray
[2:05:32] for people and be effective, you must
[2:05:34] enter into the feelings for them.
[2:05:37] Uh-huh. So that means you must release
[2:05:39] them from your heart, you must come to a
[2:05:42] point of love.
[2:05:45] and a good wish that I really want to
[2:05:47] change for them.
[2:05:51] That's Christianity now. That's what is
[2:05:53] going to make it.
[2:05:56] [Applause]
[2:05:59] You can do that.
[2:06:02] We are still climbing. You are not a bad
[2:06:04] fellow, but you are still not there.
[2:06:08] You are you are still coming. Don't
[2:06:10] don't rest until you get to a point that
[2:06:13] you no longer bother about earth.
[2:06:16] That's Christianity.
[2:06:22] But I thank God Job made it. You know,
[2:06:24] we are moving to a to a third pole, the
[2:06:27] final phase of the third pole which
[2:06:30] includes you and I. Mark 11.
[2:06:34] He said, "If you stay to this mountain,
[2:06:36] you can start speaking to your mountain
[2:06:38] even tonight. What kept your mountain on
[2:06:41] moving?" Yes. Is what I'm showing you
[2:06:44] tonight. Let me connect it for you. He
[2:06:46] said, "If you say to this mountain, be
[2:06:48] thou removed and cast into the sea." He
[2:06:51] said, "You shall have it." Did he say
[2:06:54] so? Yes. Do you believe it? Amen. He
[2:06:56] said, "But before you speak to your
[2:06:58] mountain, if you have what against any,"
[2:07:00] what did he say you should do?
[2:07:03] What did he say? Forgive.
[2:07:05] Amen.
[2:07:07] Forgiveness must be a natural nature of
[2:07:10] a believer,
[2:07:12] a son of God, a daughter of God. If you
[2:07:16] find it as a struggle to forgive, tell
[2:07:19] me who your mother and father is.
[2:07:22] Yes sir.
[2:07:25] Because those who are born by Christ,
[2:07:28] they have a nature of forgiveness.
[2:07:30] Amen. When the prophet looked at souls
[2:07:32] under the altar, he said cry the way
[2:07:35] they were crying for vengeance. He said
[2:07:37] this one cannot be bread material
[2:07:40] gentile bread material. You know why? He
[2:07:42] knows that the gentile bread material
[2:07:44] will have it as a nature not to ask for
[2:07:47] vengeance. They forgive.
[2:07:51] That's what it means.
[2:07:54] I've shared with you I've taught you
[2:07:55] something here before. Birth pain
[2:07:56] utterance of mothers. Do you remember
[2:07:59] that? Uh-huh.
[2:08:01] The prophet said, "Those Hebrew mothers,
[2:08:03] what they uttered in the moment of
[2:08:06] delivery follows their children and
[2:08:08] places them in their inheritance."
[2:08:11] Uh,
[2:08:13] you two have a mother, mother Jesus.
[2:08:18] So, that's not the right word to
[2:08:19] describe Jesus. Oh, how how unright can
[2:08:22] that be? He's very right. Don't you call
[2:08:24] him El Shadai? Right. What is El Shadai?
[2:08:28] Breasted one. The breasted one. Do you
[2:08:29] describe a man as the breasted one?
[2:08:31] Okay. Who gets the breasted one
[2:08:33] identity? He's a woman. So that is the
[2:08:36] motherhood of God. Is my father, my
[2:08:40] mother, my sister, my brother is
[2:08:43] everything to me. Isn't that what you
[2:08:45] sing? I get the revelation of your song.
[2:08:49] Amen. That is why he said when life
[2:08:52] stresses you, you can go to the bosom of
[2:08:54] your mama. Amen. Mama Jesus. and he will
[2:08:57] nause you back to life. On the cross of
[2:09:00] Calvary when he was given birth to you,
[2:09:02] what was he saying? Father, forgive them
[2:09:06] for they know not what they are doing.
[2:09:08] You were born under the birth pain
[2:09:10] authorance of forgiveness. So
[2:09:13] forgiveness must naturally locate you
[2:09:16] and place you into your inheritance in
[2:09:18] life. You cannot claim conversion and
[2:09:21] not have a forgiven spirit. It's
[2:09:23] impossible.
[2:09:27] That is why Jesus said before you can
[2:09:28] move your mountains, you must forgive.
[2:09:31] You know why? When you get to that
[2:09:33] level, it shows a level of adoption, a
[2:09:35] maturity
[2:09:37] that God can trust you not to misuse his
[2:09:40] power, his gift. Before God will entrust
[2:09:44] you, he must trust you. Otherwise, some
[2:09:47] of you with that power, you look at that
[2:09:50] guy say turn to a cat. Your presence is
[2:09:53] even annoying me. become a catch and he
[2:09:56] will become a catch. No, no, no, no.
[2:09:59] Don't get it wrong. He will become a
[2:10:00] cat. The prophet said faith will move.
[2:10:03] Whatever you call will happen. He said
[2:10:06] but that event might take you out of the
[2:10:08] will of God and you're going to pay for
[2:10:10] it.
[2:10:14] This is why God would rather mature us
[2:10:17] first
[2:10:18] before he allow his gift. We come to his
[2:10:22] presence every night to bake out all
[2:10:24] greenness so that we can mature to such
[2:10:26] a stature that God can trust us.
[2:10:31] The biggest temptation of Job
[2:10:35] was having to pray for his friends and
[2:10:38] release them from the guilt of sins.
[2:10:43] Let us say that in all the trials of Job
[2:10:45] there were blessings
[2:10:48] because God God would outsmart Satan.
[2:10:53] It was in that trial that Job had the
[2:10:55] revelation of the redeemer. Yes.
[2:10:58] Did you catch that? I know my redeemer.
[2:11:01] There are benefits in your trial. You
[2:11:04] must never always cloud of your
[2:11:06] situation to overshadow you and not see
[2:11:09] the goodness of the Lord in it. It was
[2:11:12] in that trial job was able to solve the
[2:11:14] question of resurrection.
[2:11:17] Job will preach when a tree dies he has
[2:11:19] hope. That's right. But when it comes to
[2:11:21] man he will keep quiet. And the church
[2:11:23] member will write question what happened
[2:11:24] to us after death he said we are still
[2:11:27] trusting God for revelation. But that
[2:11:30] day when he saw the redeemer the one who
[2:11:34] has not done the job of redemption. He
[2:11:36] called him a redeemer in advance.
[2:11:39] Hallelujah. because he saw he saw the
[2:11:41] mind of God. He saw him went to the
[2:11:44] cross. He saw him pay the price of sin.
[2:11:46] He saw him he saw his blood touched
[2:11:48] down. He saw him buried. He saw him
[2:11:50] resurrected. And he saw himself
[2:11:52] resurrected. Said, "Wait a minute. I'm
[2:11:54] saying something. I know my redeemer
[2:11:56] liveth." And even though the skin worms
[2:11:58] destroyed his body, yet in my flesh.
[2:12:02] Amen. Because the glorified body looks
[2:12:05] exactly like this one, but it's in the
[2:12:07] glorified state. He said, "Yet in my
[2:12:09] flesh as I see the Lord whom I shall
[2:12:11] behold and not another." So some
[2:12:13] blessings will come to you along the
[2:12:15] line until the expected end comes.
[2:12:20] And the Bible told me, can you put for
[2:12:23] us
[2:12:26] Job 42 verse 10, our last line?
[2:12:38] Now let's see this powerful one line how
[2:12:42] many line scripture.
[2:12:46] When God came down,
[2:12:49] all the problems of Job stopped,
[2:12:53] but he has not received any recovery or
[2:12:56] restoration.
[2:12:59] Are you getting it?
[2:13:02] You may have your condition stopped,
[2:13:06] but for you to have a recovery, huh?
[2:13:11] Yeah. What happened? And the Lord turned
[2:13:13] the captivity of Job
[2:13:16] when he did what?
[2:13:20] So if he never pray for his friends,
[2:13:22] will his captivity be turned?
[2:13:25] Did you catch that?
[2:13:29] And also the Lord did what? Gave Job
[2:13:34] twice as much as he had before.
[2:13:41] So what is the essence of this whole
[2:13:43] episode?
[2:13:45] What is the essence of all these trials?
[2:13:48] What is the essence of all these
[2:13:49] challenges? What was the essence of why
[2:13:52] his friends had to be that mean to him?
[2:13:56] Whether consciously unconsciously to
[2:13:59] prepare Job for greater heights.
[2:14:02] Let me close by saying this tonight. For
[2:14:05] every height
[2:14:07] that you attain, there must be a
[2:14:09] character to match that level.
[2:14:16] And character is not a gift.
[2:14:21] It's a victory. Yes sir. When you talk
[2:14:23] about victory, there must be battle
[2:14:26] things that challenges you. God will run
[2:14:28] you through the meal
[2:14:30] and when you come out, then you are
[2:14:33] ready. Amen. A man who only lives by
[2:14:36] $1,000
[2:14:39] cannot judge the man who is handling
[2:14:42] 10,000
[2:14:44] because he has never tasted 10,000. If
[2:14:47] we say this man is not spending his
[2:14:49] money wisely, if I hold that money, you
[2:14:52] will see what I will do. We wait for you
[2:14:54] to hold it and let's see what you do
[2:14:57] before we trust your judgment. Because
[2:14:59] you don't realize that with the 10,000
[2:15:02] comes the temptation of 10,000. The
[2:15:04] challenges, the associates of 10,000. If
[2:15:07] you are able to rise above it, then we
[2:15:09] can't call you. Talk is very cheap.
[2:15:14] But in God's economy, he prepares for
[2:15:17] every achievement. Yes. So that you
[2:15:19] won't lose your head when you move from
[2:15:22] point one to two. He works on you and
[2:15:26] prepare you in advance. Maybe this man
[2:15:28] here was a millionaire and God wanted to
[2:15:31] make him a billionaire
[2:15:34] and he knew that the character to handle
[2:15:36] that is greater than to handle this.
[2:15:39] This is all the reason Job went through
[2:15:41] what he went through. God has a purpose
[2:15:44] for your situation. He has a purpose for
[2:15:47] every challenge. He has a purpose for
[2:15:49] every trial. If you can only trust him
[2:15:52] and say, "God, I know you can't be
[2:15:54] wrong. Give me strength and grace for
[2:15:56] each day and keep no art in my heart. As
[2:15:59] a matter of fact, we should be thankful
[2:16:01] to the friends of Job. They only helped
[2:16:04] to vindicate him.
[2:16:08] We should be thankful to Portifer's
[2:16:09] wife. They only helped to move Joseph
[2:16:12] closer.
[2:16:14] Amen. Whoever comes along your way and
[2:16:17] upset you so bad. And you came out of
[2:16:20] that upset unscattered. God has used him
[2:16:23] to prove a point that you have gone
[2:16:25] higher and to reassure you that you are
[2:16:28] moving higher. May the Lord bless you.
[2:16:30] Shalom.
[2:17:12] Oh, all the highway
[2:17:17] that a child of God
[2:17:20] can go.
[2:17:22] Though the road
[2:17:25] be steep and rough
[2:17:28] as it leads me
[2:17:31] is enough.
[2:17:34] I want God's way to be my way
[2:17:39] every day. Let's stand to our feet now.
[2:17:43] Oh yes. I want God's way
[2:17:48] to be my way as I join the near
[2:17:54] below.
[2:17:56] For there is no other highway
[2:18:01] that a child of God can go.
[2:18:06] Though the road be steep and rough.
[2:18:13] Yes, Lord.
[2:18:15] [Music]
[2:18:16] Yes. I want God's way to be my way
[2:18:23] every day.
[2:18:27] Oh yes. I want God's way
[2:18:31] to be my way
[2:18:33] as I join in here below.
[2:18:39] For there's no other
[2:18:42] highway
[2:18:44] that a child of God can go.
[2:18:49] Though the road be steep and rough
[2:18:55] lead me is what I need.
[2:18:59] I want God's way to be my way every day.
[2:19:06] One more time now.
[2:19:09] Oh yes, I want God's way to be my way
[2:19:16] as I join in
[2:19:19] below.
[2:19:21] But there's no
[2:19:24] highway
[2:19:26] that a child of God should go.
[2:19:31] Though the road be steeping rock
[2:19:36] as he leads me is enough.
[2:19:41] I want God's way to be my way
[2:19:47] every day.
[2:19:50] Let's bow our heads together now. Though
[2:19:52] the road be steep and rough,
[2:19:58] if you lead me,
[2:20:00] it's enough.
[2:20:03] I want God's way
[2:20:06] to be my way
[2:20:09] every day.
[2:20:13] While the music plays softly,
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:19] let's speak to the Lord together now.

[2:23:34] Amen.
[2:23:35] [Music]

[2:23:49] are bright.
