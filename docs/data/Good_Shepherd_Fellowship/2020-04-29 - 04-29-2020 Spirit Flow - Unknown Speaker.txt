tonight I'm one of who you responsible for there you kept talking about that with a woman with the organ and tonight I wonder I want for us to look at something and appreciate many of you coming on for the service on Sunday but what I want to do tonight we may not be able to get through everything being in a Wednesday night but we want to just go over some few things here so let's just start with a reading a quart of blood Branham and then I will introduce what I want to I want to speak on tonight and so you can be able to have you know a thought of where we are going what shall I do with Jesus 1963 and he said the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit the dynamics of this church which mean this last is church this rapture in church will be the refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have we have worked in a small measure why the hair stone is coming to unite with the body but when that head and the body you nice together the full power of the Holy Ghost will rise her up just exactly like Amen so yeah we have a promise that it's telling us that the dynamics of this church and we will look some other few coats what Bourbon says we have the mechanics you know we have the mechanics and and and science us has made us more guilty because they have given it to us in every phone you know on our cell phones on our iPads we have it on every phone you know so we have we have the mechanics but we need the dynamics to be able to click in that word praise the Lord so we will talk a little bit tonight and any reason why we we spoke on some of the things we talked about Sunday I will show you a little bit here let's read the word and we will just aim if you stand in your home if not that's okay praise the Lord fill John chapter 7 Saint John chapter 7 praise the Lord thank you for careful lady not seen his present praise tonight praise the Lord sin John chapter 7 let's look at verse 37 the scripture says and we read in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of water but this he speak but this speaking of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified Philippians chapter 1 you can have your seat while we read that order Philippians chapter 1 so tonight a little bit we want to talk on what we will we will title tonight the flooring of the Holy Spirit let's look at Philippians chapter 1 yeah you can have your seat that's it thank you let's reverse 12 Philippine chapter 1 but I who issue understand presence they are the things which happen unto me have fallen out rather on to the furtherance of the gospel so that my balance in Christ are manifested in all the policies in in all all the places and many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confidence by my bounds a much more bored to speak the world without feeling let's drop down to verse 19 for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayers and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ let's pray father we just want to commit law the the service in your hand so god I prayed then you will just take the word now father and bless it come and break it to our house tonight we love you Father and we just appreciate your goodness law that we can have this opportunity father to be gathered around your word to build our faith Lord we love you so we commit our self in your hands in Jesus name Amen praise the Lord I was just looking at another scripture just before I was called there's over in Jude Jude on the one chapter we will read verse 20 but yeah Brad wins bill up yourself on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost Amy now so that's what we want to do we want to build up our most holy faith brother Branham said this in adoption message 1960 he said and this is what we're trying to do that kind of four letters to speak on some of the things that we spoke on them on Sunday he says this he says God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself that is the reason why we're Branham says Adam was giving the bride to reproduce himself so Christ was also the second Adam was also giving the bride to reproduce himself so for God to do that he has to put his church in other praise Lord he had to gather us from all our you know our our family background he has gathered from all our trash church tradition and even when we come to the message of the hour you know he has to just put us in place this is God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one there he can work through like this saying there's my spirit flowing Freeling God want to get that man you want to get that woman where he can say they my spirit flow freely that is an EDM position praise the Lord that is an Eden position there is what we Accord home and yes that's the place that he's bringing us a place where he can get and says there my spirit flow freely now you as would think about this okay let's just read a little bit here trying to get ahead of myself here there it is he says there I can work here and he would get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting they all the same praise the Lord Amen the manifestation of the sons of God is the adoption of the sons of God praise the Lord you know I'm just I'm caught up in myself a little bit let me share something with you yeah Genesis chapter 1 let's go to Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 verse 3 Genesis chapter 1 verse 3 the scripture says and God said let there be light praise the Lord and God said let there be light now when God said let there be light he spoke the word amen but the word that he spoke was not light it was the word but when the word was manifest then there was light praise the Lord God said let there be light he said it and there was light that was the manifestation we read there we read something on on Sunday I want to get back to that a little bit he says brother branham said it I kind of wrote it down in my note here he says you know the word he says the word manifested is the light when you see it prays alone so the word until the word it's manifested that's when it becomes the light but when he when the word is spoken it's out of God's mouth but when that word is now manifested and it says when God made a promise you know he gave us a promise that is his word but when that promise comes to pass then that is the light of the word that he has said praise the Lord amen so we go back to our court again I was reading this and it just come in mind you came through my mind their absorption placing manifesting take him out here that's God speaking down talking to a son or a daughter take him out here and put a ceremony on him and Alber been him called their ceremony this in him with an injury tell him something that's how God does ceremony that's that's the that's the adoption ceremony give him or her spiritual dreams praise the Lord now you see where Brennan he he demonstrated these this spiritual adoption in in in so much that sometimes our mind is so caught up in the in in the physical things that he talks about but for the church we have to realize there is that is a spiritual thing just like when the prodigal son came back home amen when he came back home remember now the father was always looking over for him the father was thinking about him in the father mind my son will come back home amen but when the Sun came that was light that's why the father was rejoicing because his thought has been manifested amen so to death manifested Todd the father is now putting him before everybody you know getting the best rock making the feasts and everything now brother branham is saying here God is putting us to the place all of these things that he's bringing us true is to place us to the place where he can say dare my spirit flow freely now it is net we will never get to the place of sinless perfection the place where he's breaking us is at a place word we can be able to step aside and let the word has preeminence where we will not struggle with the word our struggle you know we when we know that is our own thoughts and our own desire we can lay it aside and let God word have the preeminence he's looking for their son their daughter where he can see their my spirit flow freely praise the Lord he said there it is I can work in years he get another one over year and he plays him I can place him adoption place him manifestation take him out here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something now if he told the truth now if he's just making up something it won't work who is he talking about that son if the Sun is saying the truth what is the truth saying what the word says praise the Lord if he's just making up something and trying to support it with code brother branham said brother Branham say brother Branham say and not saying what the word says if he's just making up something it won't work that won't work we have got a lot of that phrase alone but I mean manifestation of the sons of God when God manifests himself and he sent him out praise the Lord I would just I was just reading the scripture as I was thinking about this and listening into something - yes that that's a beautiful story being in a book of art if I only stay on this that would be okay but I have to get my thoughts together that's a beautiful story there in a book of ads you think about it when they were going to call the church was going to to to call men to be deacons praise the Lord the Bible says they saw the need and he said let's choose men that afford of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now and some of these men that he choose they were actually preachers Phillip was a preacher he was an evangelist and Stephen as well but you think about Phillip year choosing him as a deacon and what was their work to be able to take care of the widows and distribute food you know and just just just to be able to help the Apostle says so we can give ourselves to praying and in the word now and if you if you realize no one who actually look and see that you know what because I mean the the scripture did not give us a lot of details but you will see there from the way that God there with this man look at feeling let's let's just take Philip for instance he was one of these D comes in a green evangelist the Scripture speaks of him being a very great evangelist but he was attaining to the needs of the believers I believe now only the widows and all the people he was also helping the young people he was also doing all of this and God was preparing him now in Philip mind he knew he had a call and and he was trying to bring his ministry out in those different ways but watching see because the little things that he was doing God used that to train him the next time we will see Philip in the Bible will be at a time word God will lead him by the spirit praise the Lord now if he did not learn to hear the voice of God in those little things how would he have known when God was sending him in a desert to meet an Ethiopian inner how would he have known I mean he would be confused you know better Brandon talks the story about the plane comes down and he want to go and put some mail and something is just telling him go down the street it just not so easy for you to understand the leadership of God until you a dream you must be trained to hear the voice of the Spirit and in the little things that he tells us to do that's where he treats us and because God was so pleased with the little things their faithfulness that Philip was doing he had a gift he was a preacher just as Peter was a preacher he was a preacher just as James was a preacher well you see he was not struggling for the puppet he was carrying out his ministry in another way on a training form and God trained him with that until he could hear the voice of the Spirit go away in the wilderness he never even went to the temple gate where there are people he went to the will and that's why there was nobody and he just they're standing up okay Lord I'm here I'm one of them I'm one up to him he's just standing up thinking his son by himself and here's the make I'm the reason why he was carried out there by the spirit here comes the Europeana why because he was streamed to hear the voice of God they that wait upon the Lord he shall renew their strength praise the Lord he learned to wait on God that he has strength enough to wait on God when nothing was happening when nobody was right around he quit until God will bring to pass what he wanted him to do praise the Lord he saw the man coming I don't you know I don't believe Phillip Jesse stop stop stop stop he just stand right there he said how do you understanding while you're reading because he knew he could feed the poor just like John Kofi the pool when Jesus was coming in a water he could feed a boat that's the man and you understanding while you're reading it may just slow down the charity yeah oh no and I just believe that man also could see there how did he know I was reading how did he know I was reading just like brother Branham walking down there you know and and and and and and and all warm I said how I possum it's there should be the reason why God brought me down here how does she know I was a preacher there my spirit flow freely praise the Lord the air my spirit flow freely you see because the thing about it just like we read him Jesus said in this promise you know God even before the Holy Ghost was giving he's promising he's he's promising his church you know what the Holy Ghost will be to the believers out of your belly will flow you see the Holy Ghost is giving to be give out that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for Toby give out you see we we I mean I you know we I was telling somebody you know we want to be stingy with this Holy Ghost I mean we just we just get so concerned about our needs all I need to do this oh oh god I need a Holy Ghost for this in my life the Holy Ghost is giving you see actually we are not reservoirs we are China for the spirit to flow through I mean verbatim says God is placing us so he can say not there my spirit stay there but spirit flow freely it's to flow I mean it's to flow freely and that's what he's doing all of these things now you just think about it now he he he places I was talking to one older sister today then she would just check in on meaning you know any I mean we were just were just talking I mean they don't have you know internet privileges and so far so I mean you have to read their Bible they have to re message boxing you know they don't have a lot of the benefit that we have you know I mean if they have internet they have to pay for data and it's it's a bit expensive there so we were just talking and and I just feel like she's you know she she needed to be encouraged a little bit you know and I was telling her some of these things you know how God has prepared us for this hour we don't have a fire furnished like the Hebrew boys we don't have a lion den this is our time this is God placing us in this situation to bring the best out of us to bring the best out of his sons and daughter just like Daniel in his days just like shared ramesha Ben and Abednego just like Paul in the praising he's putting us allowing us to go through this situation to bring the best out of his children there my spirit flow freely and he continued but I mean manifestation of the sons of God when God manifests himself and sent him out and then he goes for and what he said is true what he does is truth what he does he manifests Christ now you see that he's using all of these heads and what he says and what he does and sometimes it's so easy for it to be kept in the line of the ministry or for a preacher no is it it's just it's for the entire body I mean it's for the entire body I'll come back to that code let's drop a little bit Pergamos Church he says this awesome he said God speak to his messenger the messengers speak to the leaders and and then that's what take place he keeps the messenger in him alight in God so Bob the messenger and the people alike in God for what reason the holy spirit flowing true the group of them so one person is therefore speaking his position of speaking is not greater than the position of hearing praise the Lord I mean it will just be so confusing if the ears could talk as the mouth praise the Lord it would be confusing God have the mouth to talk he has a year to listen and not just how his body is but the purple is for the Holy Ghost to flow through the group of them both the messenger and the leading there my spirit flow freely let's come back to our colleague in what he does he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word how you Josh dad adopted son that adopted daughter the one that God is putting in position by the way they stay with the word now about their emotion by the way that they stay with the word by the way he stayed with the word right with the word seed that's how you know all men is by the way he stays with the word that's how you know every son of God every daughter of God by the way they stayed with the word because the word corrects our errors amen so even if we we strayed from the word what brings us back to the world it's a spirit by the way he stays or she stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there is no life in them since the Bible see leave them a way praise the Lord amen so let me let me flip over a little bit here Paul over in a boat of Philippine years you have to remember there Paul wrote this letter to the brothers over in in Phillip out there when he was imprisoned in Rome this man was impressing and and everything that he was going through there in Rome and he's writing a letter to these believers there are some few things that he brought out here that are very very important he's encouraging them and telling them the different things he's hearing and how you know there was something he said that really caught my mind here I mean over there in verse 19 let's read that again there my spirit flow freely fresh Lord sometimes it's just good to catch ourself and acts ourselves you know what whatever you are doing is that spirit flowing freely always that you know it's his is there his spirit flowing freely or is that just your spirit flowing freely amen he says here verse 19 for I know that this shall turn unto my salvation through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Christ now his tie in prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Christ which is the Holy Ghost Mia so Paul is encouraging these believers I'm hearing the different thing that is happening out there some people are preaching you know Christ for strive and different things that is happening up there that there is contention among the brothers he says but I know that you know this that he speaks of his salvation is bringing me out of this tuition you know true your prayers and the supply of the Holy Ghost now so you know in this in this period of time the one other thing that is on the minds of most of the believers is you know it's a we are really in a place world we are playing out the ten virgins you know everybody is thinking about the Holy Ghost I mean everybody is trying to make sure that they have the Holy Ghost everybody's you know trying to ask for a refilling of the Holy Ghost but like like we just rare bourbon and since that is the the dynamics of this church because because the Holy Spirit is to flow through us you can never have enough of the Holy Ghost you need it every day we are not just a bottle that God pour his spirit in and then he closed the top and and and is is just seal that's not the type of seal that Paul spoke about being sealed with the Holy Ghost until the day of redemption that's not a seal that God cannot refill us again because the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the Holy Ghost and that's the thing that we're quick in the word in our life every day so you see that is the place word the church gets it wrong if they just keep the Holy Ghost to a setting experience a spoke in tongues when I received the Holy Ghost yeah you spoke in tongues but you need to walk right you need the Holy Ghost to think right you need the Holy Ghost to live right and we need and and we need to live right every day so we need the Holy Ghost for everything a refilling you see and year Paul is commanding these believers there and say I know that God will bring me out my salvation through your prayers and the supply of the Holy Ghost now you see that is the reason why not in the upper room how did they receive the Holy Ghost the Bible says they were in wanna call amen and why were they doing they were waiting on the promise they were praying amen that's how they received the Holy Ghost so the flow of the Spirit comes true prayer it comes true prayer a brother or a sister whenever we put a loved ones on our heart to pray for them what are we doing we are we allowing the spirit to flow through us to be able to help their brother to be able to help that sister what the brother Branham said he said when that man that brother Cao was strolling and he called the brothers what did he says he says let's find a promise identify with our promise and let the Holy Ghost go after him so God is is is bringing up a church he's bringing up a people he's training or disciplining us just for us to be a channel through which the Holy Spirit with flow he says out of your belly even before the Holy Ghost was giving he told him out of your better will flow out of your ballot will flow rivers of water praise the Lord you know the beautiful thing there when you wash there Jesus speaking to them he says as it is in the scripture as it is in the scripture referring to the Holy Ghost by pointing it out in the Old Testament so we can find types in the Old Testament where there were flowing of rivers of water when Moses smacked the rock the water came pouring out of it and the scripture says that rock that followed him was Christ and then when brother Branham talks about the five spiritual element that followed the church he says we have the smitten Rock and what is to follow the church signs and wonders so the smitten rock represents signs and wonders and then how can the church do signs and wonders if we don't have the Florine of the Holy Spirit that's what the scripture says science and wonders will follow them I believe just like the rock follow Israel it was not a rock that was rolling it was the presence of God's wonders in the camp the rock was now on two feet oh it was just rolling behind them all Aaron and Moses have to be pushing and we need to carry this rock praise the Lord it was a manifestation of God that was performing his signs and wonders that even though they were a small group but they were an invisible army no nation could bring them down because God was in a camp of his people and that is the same thing that we are facing today amen the feeling of the economy can bring us down because God is in the camp of his feet we have our braising 7 divine healing we have our smitten rod signs and wonders we have our prophet which is the message of the hour because the prophet and the messenger is at the word and the messenger is the same praise the Lord so we have all of these things and that's what makes the shout of the king is in a camp the dynamics of this church would be the refilling of the Holy Ghost the reason why we are now reaching out is because we just think that we have you know Burnham says it's just like that little fish but a scared you know in the ocean trying to drink very small water the day and hoping that you know this thing will not go dry it's right in the ocean I mean we are right in the presence of Almighty God the Creator of heaven and earth and yet instead we are trying to take his word sparingly we are trying to zip on his word and snack on his word by little up and literal days and little coat and later days we must be letting that word to flow through us I was talking to a brother last night having we're having we're having Bible studies in the church last night were scared I'm not waiting for that building to finish I'm telling you I was over there with a verb writing and burst even wounds and we were just having having some time did and you know when you know and and and the Lord is just dealing with Bob riding you know really dealing with his heart I mean he's testifying of what what I mean the Lord is helping him truly and I mean you just just almost crying last night and but but this is what is happening he's telling me he says you know he's I mean the Lord is kind of a dealing him on Christ and him crucified you know I mean he's the Lord is showing him there you have to look at what Christ have done you know which of course it's a very strong powerful revelation but scared I mean it's very very powerful you know trying to be able to receive everything through the cross and and I mean he's talking about there and then he's telling me that is it it's telling me analysis this is what you should be preaching as I say yeah I said no you supposed to be saying you know he said oh no he said to me he says this is what I should be hearing as you know you should be letting it out you know you should be letting it out God showing you that all of his redemptive blessing comes through the cross I should not tell you it again you already knows it now you go and tell and I believe that is the reason because sometimes we get so worried water you know we have all our our our ducks in the road whether we know all the dirt rain water we know you know in Auto base oh when he told us let's just talk about how the fire got life you know what God is doing in my life how he's dealing with me you and you know every time you talk about Christ you are let you I allowing that spirit to flow through praise the Lord that is the reason why Jesus would say that you left me because I mean lot of spirit high flow true he needs the refilling he got to go back to the mountains and arrest a little why for God to fill him out because we are China's we we are not reservoirs we are now bottles we are China for God's Spirit to flow through us praise the Lord amen and what's my time here now okay having a few minutes praise the Lord let's look at this together where BAM says looking unto Jesus he says Moses look one day he seen the pillar of fire and he attracted his attention this great theologian he had run with all of his geological training in his honor standing by his mother of sorry of the word itself of how there he was to deliver the children of Israel but when he tried in his way he fell when he tried in his will he was born a deliverer but how was he supposed to do it by letting the spirit to flow praise the Lord Amen now you see that is the reason why you know brother Branham said this I mean it's very beautiful as simple as it is he says when when when you feel a burden to do something he says go and do it if you feel which means God is not in it just leave it don't don't feel bad amen if God is in it if God is behind it he would bless it and as long as he keep blessing it keep doing it but if he's not blessing it take your hands of it praise the Lord so you see here at Moses he feel and you know in a dorm his mother had terribly instructed him on what to do and and what he would do and what God has raised him up for all this knowledge as good as it is and it is good but yet it had to be set off that was only mechanics oh the message the seven hundred seven seals are the knowledge of the message baptism in Jesus name wonderful doctrine we have decent saying you know all of those things are all good all mechanics we need this constant refueling for that word to live through us we need constant refueling for that word to live through us you see when that's word flow through us and our spirit flow through us you know it has a way of cleaning out the trash and leaving the real green in amen that's what we need he says there's only mechanic my kami is in what run the automobile is the dynamics that run run it amen he says back down here the mechanics don't run the church we can get the church order just like I said on Sunday brother Branham says it was God dealing with the individual that's what the church all over for we can have all of that but if it is not a revelation to the individual if God have NASA working on you as a tabernacle as a temple as a temple material I mean you will come to church and observe everything and you can even have that come on quietness in your own spirit my candid don't run the church is the dynamics is the Holy Ghost that get into this world is the Holy Ghost that quick in the world I mean what actually is the quickening power is the word Paul said in Hebrew for 12 the word is sharp and quick that's where that word quickening power is from it's sharp and quick even to the dividing asunder you turn turn on the light 1964 he said in this hour brother when we wonder what's the matter with our revival was the matter he says we got the material and everything we got the mechanics we got the word we have identified the messenger of the age we have the material we got the mechanics but word is the dynamics were is that dynamics that dynamics I will react o it over and over is refilling it's the refilling of the Holy Ghost we need it every day for is to be able to quick in the word and make his promises real to us in difficult situation in decisions that we have to make we need their refilling too quick in the word there my spirit flow freely say we got everything we got the mechanics but where is the dynamics that's what we need to move Jesus Christ in on the scene we need a dynamics we can overemphasize the importance of the Holy Ghost amen and the truth about it there is there you can keep it to one experience no you can keep it to one experience I mean that is the mistake that we made that is the mistake people make pentecost made a mistake when they talk speaking in tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and because they did their they could not see the flaw that was happening in the church they could not see when Satan came right in their mess and started speaking in tongues because witches speak in tongues as well they couldn't see that well Ram talks about honor their revival he sees the very time the Holy Ghost was coming down he says there was and there was there was a contrary spirit coming down as well because the two spirit runs in parallel they saw how many was filled with the Holy Ghost but he never also saw how many will possess with the devil if they would have kept the the evidence of the Holy Ghost as a constant refilling they would have followed the move of God they would have following God left their revival and moved to another revival that would have follow it because it's a constant it's a constant flow you know just like we share on Sunday God wrapped adenine Eve in a bleeding skin because the atonement is constant we walk in the light as he is in the light every time they took a step there was blood that was dropping with every step that they were going away from God and that blood speak better things because it was a type of the Lamb of God so we need that constant floor amen that's the dynamics of this church praise the Lord Amen don't ask don't ask me whether you have the Holy Ghost you have it you just need more of it praise the Lord you just need more of it brother Branham give us a time is just like that one you get one taste of it you one more that's what people gets drunk you know that's what it gets drunk because there is just something in that fermentation you know you taste one you want more and before they realize they are speaking something different they can't even find their steps to the whom and that's what the Holy Spirit is you can keep it to one experience it has to be a constant life it's got to be something that lived through us praise the Lord there my spirit flow freely and that's what he's doing putting the church together dealing with us the different ways giving us different assignment different trials you know putting us back together the problem is Ned whether we fail or nad what really matter is after we feel what did we do next that we can't allow ourself to continue to fail and continue to fail no because that seed is the word that corrects the error and whenever the word comes and corrects the error it brings us back to the Father you just think about it you know you think about it I was talking with a brother then he asked me he says you know we talk on the prodigal son we talked about we talked about the prodigal son we talked about a prodigal son we never said nothing about the guy that was in the house that was before the father I said because most of the time we make the practicals on two different person when the prodigal son is just this guy remember jesus said your angel is always before the father that is a type of the older son this one bypassed the two funny is the type of the youngest son that strayed and came back to the Father so it's not two different person it's not brother Jordan is to all the father because he was I mean the younger the older brother because he was born in the message no it's not too different person it's the picture of salvation where there is one that is before the Father a representation of you and that prodigal son is this one that back past the two funny that was born in same shipler in iniquity it's also almost like the three counsel believer having another type of wit for Sunday it's also like the three kinds of believer it's not three different person sitting in the church it's just your body spirit and soul don't look over your shoulder you added three kinds of believer this body is an unbeliever it will remain an unbeliever it would die an unbeliever that's the reason why at the resurrection they must pick up a glorified body because it would die an unbeliever praise the Lord I was looking at I was looking at something the other night for what I want to talk about on Sunday and we just hope that the law would give us grace amen praise the Lord so you see that and I and I told him because it was a conversation we were having and I saw where he was going with their conversation and I says well trust the law to can afford just help us right here and as soon I told him that he saw it he saw it and he says exactly that's it why we talk about the prodigal son it's all about the product custom because that's what we are or we were in this place bypassing our cheer for me was when we went away with God with a precious gift we went away with the father why you were born I was in Africa with the father with that with my owner goose praise the Lord Amen but there was a seed that led to button he lost everything but he never lost his sonship praise the Lord so now remember you just watch the the audience watch the congregation that Jesus had when he was dealing with that he had the Pharisees he had a strap this man that was steadying the law and the book of Deuteronomy has already taught them how to deal with a rebellious son how he should be he should be brought before the elders he should be stoned to their because he said disgrace to the father and that's what was going to happen to the entire human race if Jesus did not pay the price we were going to be stoned with hailstones of fire go who have just wept everything out but he couldn't do it so God has to rewrite his own Lord and as much as it was against the Lord because their father that Jesus was talking about he was a wealthy man he was a respectful man if he was not respectful nobody would care about his son nobody would care about his name but he was one of the arrows of Israel so so so so Jesus had to rewrite the Lord and how did he do it because in his in his message in his salmon he brought the father down from from on high he ran the father through the street to go and meet the son at the gate because that's where they will have stone him praise the Lord the dynamics of this church is the refilling of the Holy Ghost there my spirit flow freely that's what the father want to say he looked down on you and work he want to sit there my spirit flow freely when he look at you I mean in a shopping-center he want to sit there my spirit flow freely he want to look at our young people and said dear my spirit flow freely god bless you we'll continue on a Sunday what I say God bless here looks like you still want me to continue let's sing that song again flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me amen before we go to the Lord in prayer why we bought our hands let it be our prayer this evening there will be our prayer this evening [Music] lay through me Holy Spirit live through me lay through me Holy Spirit live through me I laid my hands to washing and to mic me fire your knees lift Rumi Oh Lee spirit-led true me maybe I didn't hide a little difference got you beat us again [Music] the spirit live true [Music] lay through me Holy Spirit live through me as I laid my hands to your share and to my define let me Holy Spirit led through thee love through mean Holy Spirit love through me holy spirit true [Music] love through me Holy Spirit love [Music] oddly my hand to you was shed and to mine if I love me Holy Spirit [Music] very true he's very rich through me Holy Spirit pray true I live my head do you wash it and to magnify Holy Spirit how we need that sometimes we get so organized and I will pray and I mean we just set the words right and make the sentence right we just need to just let loose let's go just bring this request is true our hearts and true our mind and what our mind can just run over the places I mean you just praying for people you don't need to measure their the name you know the I see people sometimes I want to pray for somebody and it says Lord and a brother brother brother the Lord knows the person just pretty true let the Holy Spirit just flow true we just get sold him on organized and we want to drag God through that slowness of our human spirit if he loved through us we will love the unlovable we will love the person that is difficult that for us to love if he if it is he he's the one loving through us if he's the one living through us he would give us victory everything there my spirit flow freely [Music] that's the hour we are living in it's the hour of the manifestation of the sons of God is not going to come it's already here because we have all the mechanics all we need is to just let the spirit flow through us Lord reminding of your word Lord quick in that word to mean in an hour that is needed that's what brother Branham said he said in an hour where the word is need the Holy Spirit will remind us I've seen there over and over when I'm staring in and and there is just something on my mind I said Lord I know there is something about this in the world all I need to do is to just go about and be reading just go about praying before I come to the end of what I'm doing he's going to remind me because that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for it's giving to remind us is giving to guide us is giving to lead us is giving to teach us [Music] some people did I mean I mean they have already graduated so they don't need to be taught but that's one of the requirement for adoptions you have to be taught you have to sit on a tutor where God can sit there my spirit flow freely God was using their situation that office of a deacon to prepared Philip for his ministry and you know the beautiful thing about that their story Philip have four daughters that had a gift to prophesy they saw hardly a father was submissive in his ministry they saw how he was submissive they saw how he was saving they learn from their father how to submit himself to the dealing of God [Music] maybe when Paul came true their place they were not ashamed to prophesied and say there is there is bound that is waiting for the man to have this flow through me Holy Spirit I mean there's that just how the spirit flows I mean it's a type of that the candle state in that the tabernacle all the chemistry was light from one can distinct from the fire of the brazen altar the light this candle stick and take the life from this and light this other one in and take the life from this and light this other one if we just allow the spirit to flow through us they will flow right through on to your children because they will be observing your humbleness there will be your saving your devotion to the Lord it will flow right on to your husband they will flow right on to your wife they are observing how you are submitting yourself to the world how you are carrying out your personal devotion they are observing the life when it comes to a word the reference and the respect that you have there my spirit flow freely [Music] as I lay my head do you wash it and to magnify they need flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me Heavenly Father that's our prayer tonight that's our prayer tonight Lord Lord we will now be following the service from whom we not plain religion we need you this hour in every hour of harmaline father you have brought us a mighty long way no doubt we are walking on the Kings Highway oh dear God we want to come to that place laws to make you a proud son to make you a proud daughter when the prodigal came back home the father mentioned nothing about where he had been father never said you foolish boy you wish they're all my money and you are coming back now the father never said nothing the father was proud because he respected the sonship he respected the son that he was to him he believed in the ability of the father and that's where every one of us every one of us every one that is saved by grace is a prodigal son father we pray tonight thank you Lord God for Wednesday night Lord Jesus father we want to take this talk Lord and ask that the Holy Ghost would deal with us on the Lord when we go to our chamber tonight and we go to our ground of praying too now father we laid on our pillow Lord Jesus on our knees or wherever we may find ourselves bring this word back to us Lord bring this word back to us there my spirit flow freely out of your belly would flow rivers of water dear Lord we don't know what tomorrow will bring we don't know how long are we gonna stay in this father we're not going to put it up for tomorrow we need it right now Lord we need a quickening right now we need a refilling right now [Music] father we need it for ourself Lord Jesus just like that with a woman she went borrow vessels from everywhere it was flowing on Ted the scripture says it was flowing all in all in the house I believe she and her children were just slipping and falling in the oil get enough slipping and falling [Music] dear Lord we just committing ourselves to you now thank you Father thank you for your presence thank you for your word call me the rest of the evening in your heads in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen spring up a well let's sing dad who and the blind to see or open phrase and go said a caffeine-free that's a river of life [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] where we [Music] Oh Oh spring our classroom where we ate my soul free papa bear Oh let's sing that one more time oh yeah lady walk and the blind oh the crazy fool yes a river of blood for the town owes bring up a well with my soul [Music] and get to me [Music] praise the Lord amen you know I've seen people that the Lord has dealt with and you know Bob Brennaman even talks about that in Hebrew exposition you know he was talking about our preacher dieback slided you know and and he said when he got back he talked to the man and after God took him from the scene you know everybody started going around and saying you know he lost the Holy Ghost and he didn't had the Holy Ghost where BAM says no he says I know their man I knew when he received the Holy Ghost praise the Lord he said so what happened is that people have a genuine spirit of the Holy Ghost but they try to stick to that experience and that goal with that constant refilling so now if the devil challenge you down the road brother scared you'd say oh I thought I received the Holy Ghost now if I'm doing this now which me I did not receive the Holy Ghost there is a general experience of the Holy Ghost but we need a constant refilling and he will keep refilling us until we get out of here praise the Lord you know he would keep refilling us until we get out of here he says so God make that gem you experience as a seal that I know that you know he did with me but as we go down the road he needs to refill us everything everything as we walked a lot bless you we will see you on Sunday if the Lord Jesus Terry
