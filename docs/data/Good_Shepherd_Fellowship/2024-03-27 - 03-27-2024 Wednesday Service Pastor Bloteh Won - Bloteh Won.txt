uh uh here this afternoon I wanted to have come in uh KN very well that I will I will be away this weekend and uh uh preaching the Easter meeting I've I've said it's Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning and uh uh so in the midst of everything and knowing we were going to have a prayer meeting tonight I thought well I would just come over here spend some time and then uh uh get ready for the service tonight put some of my thoughts together and uh and then get back home that I would normally do but for some reason it was a little bit difficult to just leave home you know first I thought well okay I got out and I just well I just I'll go and clean my wife car and then uh brought her car back and and then I left driving I thought well it would just be good to stay around home and and then just just get ready but then I kept driving you know I kept I kept telling myself I would turn at the next at the next time I have an opportunity to turn and and I will go past that place and I will tell myself the next time and then for some reason I just I just had a very strong a on me to turn around so I went took the bridge and then I turned around and got home and then when I got home I decided to just go straight straight uh uh up and just get myself ready my mind was I would I would get get myself ready for church come here early and then prepare myself for the service tonight so as soon I got home uh uh my wife told me okay I'm I'm running she says I'm running uh uh uh to pick up something to come back and then and and all all of that was towards our trip so she left the house I said okay hurry up you know we have service tonight so uh uh I'll be up getting myself ready so I'll open in the room getting myself ready and then the smoke alarm went off you know I'm hearing the smoke alarm because she was cooking she was trying to cook and and have full home for her mother sister be been uh spending some time with us also so we were going to leave the Two Sisters home to have a good time of their life and and fellowship together so she was facing food for them she got through cooking cut the store off and everything and and then the smoke alarm when I'm hearing the smoke alarm I'm in the room and I said so what's what's going on and when I came out I mean the whole house was INF flaming smoke and when I got down the stove was uh was on fire and uh uh sister be trying to help me to cut the fire off and so I pulled it off the wall and and unplug the stove and turn the gas line off and but then you know it's all this self cleaning stove so it kind of a lock I couldn't I couldn't pull it open and you can see the fire blazing in the in the stove and the the smoke is all over the place so I ran up and call the children I told them come down you know go across the street go to the to the neighbor home and went down and and called my mother-in-law and told she and sister be to get out of the house and uh I was just trying to to manage I thought I I would get the the the fire under control but then uh the smoke I mean I just couldn't find my way even see through the house I was just coughing and all of that so then I called I called the the the fire Masher called an emergency and he came over to the house and uh uh help us P the flame off and and uh uh you know put the stove out out of the house uh caught the gas line off and uh uh you know and and all of that so uh had to help to do some cleaning up so uh uh my wife and mother and the children they are not home they are not with us tonight they have to stay home to do some cleaning up and uh but I would just I would just so uh in as much as I was I'm I'm so grateful I was just so uh I was just so shaken you know because uh when you when you when you are in a routine of doing things I mean you it's it's it's hard to get out of it you know I normally like to have a a good time being by myself to get ready for service uh whether it it's uh uh Wednesday night or Sunday and the best the best way to do it is to leave home drive here stay here by myself and just prayed and and wait on the Lord but just to see how the Lord kept artim me to turn back and go home because my wife was going out anyway you know she was going up and it was the children they were all in their room playing and their grandmother down in her room in the basement and uh uh yeah I can't imagine what will have happened yeah and but we want to be thankful to the Lord want to be very thankful to the Lord to be thankful to the Lord I've never smoked in my life but I think I smoked today because my stomach is just my stomach is so upset with the amount of smoke that I inhad it but we want to thank the Lord that uh uh the house is still standing and uh we just have to deal with the the smoke and all of that we try to get a smoke aspect in and you know to be able to tell us uh what's going on there so we we want to be very very grateful tonight praise the Lord I'm I'm I'm very well show

brandham say he attacked their reasoning he say sense of the spirit amen he put their mind to work it was the Battle of the Mind praise the Lord and when the battle of the Mind begins like the prophet of God said it's not the thought that comes on our mind but what you do with the thoughts the decision you make upon the thoughts that comes to your mind he says the thoughts the mind of a man is just like a corn field or like a a rice field you cannot uh you can uh stop the birds from flying over the field but you can stop it from resting over the field amen praise the Lord so uh uh uh uh the devil first uh I mean he he he formed that channel he formed that channel of reasoning and and and and for Eve it was a mind battle it was a mind battle and the and and the and the and the and when when the Mind battle intensify for their mind uh uh or whatever is the thought or whatever is going in in in in the mind at the time or the person is battling against you will realize that uh uh for there to materialize or or or do not materialize there is there is another uh uh face of the battle that stands out strong that's the battle of the will praise the Lord that is the Battle of the will so uh right there in Eden uh uh those those two battles came together for Eve you know sedom spoke to her mind and or I mean he he he gave her something to reason about something to think about do God really says that put her mind to working praise the Lord amen and then when she gave when she gave into the to then now she started struggling in her body you have to realize that uh her body will have never been abused except her will was overcome she surrounded her will amen praise the Lord so we see that in Luke chapter 4 Jesus had his battle on the mind when Satan spoke to him on the mountain and we see at the end of his life or the end of his ministry we also see him also having another battle in the in the b in the guen of Gethsemane which was the Battle of the will praise the Lord and like brother brandham said here he says that uh uh uh uh he was going to be rejected at Jerusalem and the council was going to take his life when the internal destination of every soul that ever was and who be on earth rested upon his decision praise the Lord I was I was sharing uh at home in and uh and with with some of the Saints what I will have spoken on on Sunday if uh the service was not canceled you know we we we read the psalm from from uh Psalm 118 where the Bible says this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it praise the Lord and every day is a day that the Lord has made amen so every day we must rejoice and be glad in it but in the context of scripture or the context of Prophecy what David was referring to when he said that I just want us to turn there for a few minutes amen Psalm chapter 118 we'll come back and and uh we just have that one quote to read tonight and then uh we'll call the service up Psalm chapter 1118 praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight if you read from verse 21 I will praise thee for thou have heard me and I and I become my salvation the stone which the Builder the builders refuse is become the head of the corner praise the Lord see how David goes with this the stone which the builders refus is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I Bes thee Oh Lord oh Lord I besch Thee send now prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord amen now so when you look at this you will see there are blessed the he that cometh in the name of the Lord is is is a is is a it's a phrase It's a prophecy that is tied to what Zachariah said when Jesus will be making his triumphant entry into Jerusalem so if you look at this the the the psalm year honor prophecy you will realize that this Psalm speaks more of that day because Jesus triumphant entry into Jerusalem will be the day where the the rejected Stone became the headstone headstone in a sense that it took it took uh it took the first page page on the on the news praise the Lord what do I means god ordained it and plan it without the people making proper Arrangement but honor prophecy the influence the power of Prophecy had the people to run into the street and said hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord praise the Lord even before there Jesus told his disciple you go there there you find a man he had he have an I had never been roded upon it had never been worked upon before you tell him the master need it praise the Lord and the disciples will go they will find a man they will get the car they will come and Jesus will get upon it riding right into Jerusalem and prophesy will will force the people Prophet said will get a hold of the people and then we get to singing and throwing Prime branches and all of that now what I want you to realize is that from the day that Jesus was born from the day that the angel met Mary and told her that she will have a child everyone that heard of that news rejected the story praise the Lord the angel had to even help Joseph because he was planning to privately reject her he will not do it in a disgraceful way but he will put her away priv because he couldn't make sense of it praise the Lord hallelujah from the day that Jesus was born from the time he was conceived his birth was announced besides Zacharias and and and and and Simeon in the temple and Hanah uh uh the prophetes and all all of those El that recognize his birth Jesus was rejected that day will be the only day in his life the day where he will come ring on the donkey will be the only day in his life that's what the pist was referring to when he says this is the day that the Lord has made a had to be God that made that day why because just three days or four days after those very people that said blessed is he that come in the name of the Lord will be the very same people that will say crucify him it had to be the Lord's doing the Sam said is the Lord's doing in is marvelous in our eyes amen praise the Lord when God is about to fulfill his word he has a way of getting our attention not only getting our ention he has a way of getting us involved you don't have to prepare to fulfill prophecy it's it's pre-planned you don't have to prepare there is no better way you can prepare to fulfill prophecy are we together amen glory be to God now I refer to this because of what we just read here when he was to be rejected at Jerusalem the council was going to take his life when the Eternal destination of every soul that ever was was or will be on earth rested upon his decision oh how little mind was comparison to that now brother brandham here is making comparison of what he went through with the loss of his wife and and all of the things that he went through and he's also going to make a comparison of no matter what we will ever go through in this life will never be compared to what it was praise the Lord whatever you are going through the inal destination of the entire world is not resting on your shoulder praise the Lord amen what is resting on your shoulder is your portion praise the Lord what is resting on your shoulder is the purpose of your life and how you can also be a blessing and an encouragement to others but the decision of the entire world is not resting on my shoulder the decision of the entire world will never rest rest on your shoulder it was resting on one man's shoulder and that was the Lord Brother bam says how little mine was comparison to that how little your was comparison to that Such a Pity that we can stand these little things little things that we will go through it will throw us off we would stop praying and stop being in fellowship with God and and get away from church and little things that we will go through think about what he went through praise the Lord Such a Pity that we can't stand these little things but in that great crucial hour until he suffer knowing all things until the water and and blood separated in his body the great drops of sweat like blood dropped from his brow he died more death in Gethsemane that was the thing that caught my mind tonight amen praise the Lord and that's the thing that will make me preach tonight he died more death in Gethsemane then he did on the cross CR praise the Lord you know why it was important because brother Bram told us that God will judge sin where sin was committed the white turn judgment is not going to be in heaven it's going to be here on Earth because sin was committed here on Earth praise the Lord when Adam and Eve sined God judged them in the B that sin was committed in Praise the Lord hallelujah if we don't pass from condemnation to life God is going to raise up the body of the Sinners and they will be judged in the body that sin was committed in now what will bring my mind to that is to share with us tonight that man fell in a garden when man fell it was in the garden when God was to redeem man it had to be in the garden When sin was committed it was in the garden the price of sin must be paid in the garden that's why brother Bram said he died more death in Gethsemane than on the cross praise the Lord hallelujah love that tonight he died more death in Gethsemane than than he did on the cross he was just at the even of this just before the great battle was to start amen and he took communion he brought his disciples together to talk over things with them and that's the way he does you and I just before the great battle of Life Starts before the great battle of right and wrong began to battle within us God bring us to a Gethsemane praise the Lord the battle of the will the battle of the will praise the Lord the battle of the will our will are we together that's why he brings us to a communion because that's word the greatest battle is in this hour in this time just like it was for our bridegroom oh yeah we can get we can you know we can we can we can answer all the devil questions in our mind because we know the scripture we know what the message says we can we can you know he can bring a thought to our mind we can answer him but that hour and that time where the word must be manifested in us that's where we struggle to surrounder our will and you have to realize that brother brandham says God can do nothing much he said both God and the devil except he gets the will of a man praise Lord the word can never be made flesh in us God can never be glorified in the situation unless we surrounder our will to him it's not how much we know what the scripture says or how much we know what the message says is how much are we surrounding ourself to what we know the battle of the will praise the Lord he said if he will go through such a thing and for us to think that the things that we are going through is so great that no matter what we can be so strong and many times we think that we are in the will of God when we are only being strong in our our human will praise the lord we are only being strong in our human will taking a position with a religious [Music] mind we have bunch of scriptures in our mind why we must not do this but we are still strong I believe that's what Jesus was experiencing he had all the scriptures going through his mind for this reason you were born praise the Lord you are the fountain in the House of David for the uncleanness of the people every prophecy true the Old Testament was flooding through his mind but it would do you and myself no good if he only had that word in his mind and he never surrounder his will so it will also do you no good if you know everything the word says and you have it right here and you will never surround your will praise the Lord he says that was the greatest battle he called it the Battle of life and that's the way he does you you and I before just before the great battle of Life Starts before the great battle of right and wrong begin to battle within us praise the Lord The Great Battle of of right and wrong is battling over our will are we together and that's why brother brandham says praying is it's not telling God all we want him to do for us because the scripture says before we even open our mouth he knows exactly what we want to say praying is how much can we surrounder our will to what God want to do in the in the giving hour praise the Lord no matter what we are asking the Lord and what we are praying for and what we are waiting on can we surround our will to wait for him to bring it to pass praise the Lord can and we surrounder our will even if everything is going out of course but you see the human the human will the human can be strong in their will praise the Lord if you study the book of cusan you will realize that Paul identify something in that church and it was called will worship right praise the Lord he identified that among the Believers that uh people were caught up in their human will and they were so captured in there you you you imagine that even Paul when he was saw I mean he he was he was caught up in his will he knows exactly what it was for the person to be caught up in their will thinking that is the word of God praise the Lord many times you will find people whatever they choose to do there is just no way they can be able to to uh uh uh to think they true the scripture or supported by scripture the justing is the right thing to do I'm I'm I'm a Christian is the right thing to do so I should do it but that's what G was all about it was the Battle of the will praise the Lord and if God will have the preeminence in the people if God will have a preeminence in a bride it will be a people that are ready to surrounder their will to him not my will but Lord your will be done praise the Lord not my will but your will be done now you I I'll say something here and then I close you will realize that when Paul speaks about these things to the Church of Rome in the Book of Romans he talks about he talks about the spirit the mind the will of the person and they are all somehow they somehow intertwin you know he talks about uh uh uh the mind the mind of the spirit you know and and then he would talks also about uh uh but you see it's it's just in that place and and like Paul will say in the book of uh uh Hebrew the word of God is sharper than the two edges SW Discerning the intents of the heart and the mind praise the Lord the scripture says we must love the Lord with all of our heart all of our mind all of our strength all of our soul but you see mentally there there is no way we can be able to point out those things in the human being all of our heart it's not the muscles that pump our blood praise the Lord all of our mind is not just on it our thinking faculty so we realize that there is a there is a supernatural being there's a supernatural thing that you are carry in you that's a supernatural thing it's it's it's a body it's made out of it's made up of your mind your soul you know we we can be we we we we we try to be so clear you know taking what the prophet says and we draw three cycle we says this is where the five senses is and this is where the the the the the the senses of the spirit and there is one sense here called your soul brother Bram try to give us an idea as close as as a prophet as he would give it to us praise the Lord but when you look close and you look how how sometimes when you are faced with a situation and things are going through your mind and you are dealing with things and and you want to find the word of God and and you are thinking what uh I mean is is this my mind is is this my human thought is this the word word of God and and sometimes you are caught in that place praise the Lord that's the reason why Paul says is only the word only the word has the power to be able to differentiate when you are operating in your mind the word is a two-edged sword it's only the word that can go in and say no you are operating it can identify that you are in the real of your mind your will is not is not surrounded to God you know what and and and and and and all of that it's only the word that is the importance of what the word was given to us for and the prophet of God said this bride will use the word we must bring our thoughts we must bring our desires everything back to the the word amen are we together but what I want to wanted to share with you for this prayer meeting tonight it's after 9:00 should find a time I should be able to close here it's just for us to realize what a victory he died more a death in Gethsemane he died more more at death surrounding his we then he die on the cross he died more at death when Paul says we should die daily is the constant surrounding of our will is the constant surrounding every day is the dailying surrounding our will praise the Lord and if we will die to the things of the word it's not you taking a shotgun and shooting the television you say you die to television no you can blow that thing up and it stay in you praise the lord it's not changing your form is the will it's the desire within praise the Lord is how much we can surround our will how much we can be able to die you see the thing there is that uh uh we use those language you know and they are to your will they are to your desire it really don't die it all brings us over to the two dog story is the one that you gave your will to the most is going to use it praise the Lord that's the reason why as a Son of God as a daughter of God we make good choices in serving the lord make good choices in in in doing the best we can for our home our wives our children but once in a while you realize that you fall in another Channel or doing something the wrong praise the Lord because it's there it's not going to go anywhere you can't kill your will you can you can you can car your mind it's there God needs your mind he needs it praise the Lord he needs your will God needs your desire for him to be able to manifest his attributes through you for others to come and know him he needs those things that he give us but it's just the way it's channeled praise the lord it's just the way it's Channel glory be to God if you give your mind to the word reading of the word meditating on the word listening to the word you find the enemy will fight you a lot of things will be coming through your mind I mean uh I mean you you you have bad dreams and I mean all sorts of things will be happening it's why it's it's all because he want that channel he know that he cannot have access to the vessel of your body until he have that channel that's true that's the reason why you don't go on vacation on God that's oh I've been reading my Bible I just I'm just a little bit tired now and you don't you don't go on vcation of God is supposed to be part of our life you want to keep your mind in that Chanel praise the lord it's just God converting the desires he's he's he's he's killing the curse that's what the Holy Ghost does it come and destroy the curse but it still uses the channel God gave you the channel just like we said he gave us this body he gave us this body so his Spirit can dwell in it it's a body that is born born in sin shapely in iniquity but the reason why he gave it to us is because he's a spirit and there is no way he will be manifested until he have a body to work through the promise is the Holy Ghost the body is the land that the Holy Ghost DW in praise the Lord God want you to use your imagination he want you to use your reasoning or else he would not say come let us reason together your reasoning is not wrong he want you to use your affection praise the Lord because that's what we use when when we fall into empathy with people and and and and and and and and we get burden for people he want you to use that he want you to use your conscience the conscious are not evil just like your eyesight he want you to use it he want you to use your your sense of feeling if the senses of of of of of talking was gone from me you would not hear me tonight if you didn't have the the senses of hearing either you would not hear me tonight so all those things God gave gave it to us for us to use it many times people think that the believer only supposed to operate from the real of their soul if you don't have a body you will never know you operating from the realm of your soul you need a body with all of its senses and that's the reason why he brings us to a Gethsemane for us to s surrounder that channel to him where he can make use of all of our body he died more a death in Gethsemane then he died on the cross praise the Lord let's bow our house tonight flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me [Music] God want to fill every fibers of our [Music] body [Music] and to myy your need flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me
