you musicians that will be it for the music let's take our bibles and and we will go right in the book of hebrew praise the lord let's look in the book of hebrew chapter 12. praise the lord hebrew chapter 12. let's read from verse 23 hebrew chapter 12 let's read from verse 23 hebrew chapter 2 verse 23 to the general assembling the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel praise the lord let us pray heavenly father in the name of the lord jesus we we once again lord i want to thank you for the ability that we have of god to stay have access to your written word and dear lord father god and we know the highest form of of expression lord father is life and oh god uh you want this word to be a living word and father so we pray that god you will you will just come now lord and and bless the written word that we have read and father may the holy spirit distribute to us as we are in need this morning come out of the pages of your word father and meet us at the point of our needs father we we prayed and we believe that god you are still in the healing business if there is anyone feeling that god now well in our midst we pray that god you will you will heal them lord it's written in your word what you taught the sick will heal so we know lord god there is there is something that comes from your word that heals so father we love you we appreciate you this morning in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord i've heard our sister now i mean it's just the faith flow out this morning to tennessee we ask that the lord we grant them a safe journey the lord bless you you may have your seat you may have your seat praise the lord amen now now uh uh when the wednesday night service uh we we had we were talking uh on a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and [Music] last sunday we started talking about the the road of the priests the work of the priest standing between the living and the dead and then how the priests become effective when when he can uh [Music] feed for the people we know that that is that is just in the shadow but but like like the apostle paul said here and and we read in in hebrew chapter 5 he talks about how verse 1 for every high priest taken from a more man is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifice for sin who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way talking about the priests for that he himself also is compassed with infirmities now so that's the limitation of the priest that is among men that is different from uh the the priesthood of our lord jesus christ praise the lord because the priest among man he himself he's compassed with uh with uh infirmities that is the reason why he have to offer uh sin for the people i mean sacrifice for the people and sacrifice for himself and uh and and yeah and paul brings this out you see that in the book of hebrew where paul brings it out and he and he talks about uh bulls and goats you know bulls and goats it is is uh uh uh i mean paul brings it out in that way just like i said to just show the difference between the priest's sacrifice and the people sacrifice the priests have to bring abort very big praise the lord it shows that the priest's life is is in public the people brings a goat they can bring a little kid put it under the arm you can put a bull under your arm praise the lord so uh so just like we we were trying to to to say it and and you know and help us to understand paul was trying to bring to uh the hebrew believers the hebrew christians you know the the those those jewish believers that that believe the gospel he was trying to make them to understand how true jesus that was given from our father abraham and through the prophets through jesus they have all become better praise the lord through jesus they have all become better everything that god has promised everything that he had given us everything that was foreshadowed in the old testament so on on wednesday night i i throw uh uh an assignment to you i don't know whether you were able to look at it but we uh we want to look through the book of hebrew now we will go very fast with this not to take much of our time but it is is so it's very so important i mean wednesday night i was talking and while we were reading the hebrew chapter one if you remember we got down there to verse 4 and he was talking about jesus he was talking paul was talking about how god in sondra times spoke through the prophets but in this last day he has spoken through his son now so you you go through every chapter you see paul showing to the jews that god gave us a prophet but there was one greater and better than the prophet praise the lord so all of those things that the jews believe in and had told dearly paul was trying to show them that it was just a type of a better one god spoke to us through the prophets but in this last day we have heard a better voice praise the lord in verse 4 he says uh uh he's he's going to make an expression here being made so much better talking about the sun being made so much better than the injured now so that that was the verse i was reading and then i make the comment of the different better things that paul talks about i didn't realize it until i i went back home and i started studying it i mean the holy spirit just kept that thing on my mind and and i just couldn't sleep i i just lie there then and says i have to look at this it amazed me to realize that uh there are 12 different times 12 different times that paul used better and 12 different things he applied to and then was what the thing that impressed me is the other i mean it is not just uh uh i mean this book is written by there's a divine design that is in this book praise the lord amen i mean it's just all over the scripture now yeri said that that paul is addressing the jewish church praise the lord and we know that uh you know god has uh you know has always there with the jews like that 12 tribes when he came he called 12 of them as an apostle praise the lord revelation chapter 12 that talks about uh uh uh you know the the the woman with uh uh uh the the moon and the sun that represent the jewish church is a type of the jewish church passing from law to grace and yeah that that the apostle paul writing his own letter to the jewish church where he's now addressing trying to bring light to the torah that was given to them by moses it has to be god praise the lord so in chapter one verse four we just read that he talks about better than an angel chapter six verse nine he talks about being things uh uh better things that accompany salvation let's let's look at that quickly i could just run through and call all of these but uh uh that the emphasis will be missed praise the lord because sometimes the people just listening to the preacher they don't go back in and follow up and uh and and read those things praise the lord so that's chapter six verse 9 he talks here in and he says but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation we of course the old covenant could not give them there are things that accompany salvation praise the lord what are some other things that are accompanying salvation the baptism of the holy ghost they never had it under the old covenant praise the lord they were only limited to animal sacrifice of which the animal blood they have to do it over and over and over but there is a better thing that accompanies salvation that there is one sacrifice and the life of that sacrifice can come back on the believer and change our life forever there is better things that accompany salvation that's what makes it so sweet amen praise the lord better things that i accompany salvation not just church membership praise the lord not just church membership now belonging to a church and putting your name down on the book i'm talking about a life change i'm talking about divine healing i'm talking about deliverance better things that accompany salvation [Music] that's the difference between salvation and religion let's go 7 chapter 7 verse 7 oh my goodness praise the lord amen chapter 7 verse 7 let's drop back to verse 4 so you can get the picture now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the sport and now he's talking about uh mechazetic amen he says and verily did that uh of the sons of levi who who receive the office of the priests who have a commandment to take tithes of the people are calling to the lord that is of their brethren though they come out of the lands of abraham but he whose the sin is not counted from them received tithes of abraham now he's separating the difference between the levitica priesthood and the mechasadic priesthood amen then he says uh receipt out of abraham and bless him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is bless of the better praise the lord we could get a little bit uh uh uh trap in there let me let me read that a little bit out of the amplifier so you you'll be able to get the the understanding there the amplifier translation says but this person who has not the levitica ancestry received tithe from abraham himself and bless him who possess the promise of god yet it is beyond all contradiction that it is the lesser person who is better than the greater one praise the lord amen so he's talking about uh uh uh uh in in the in the levitical priesthood all of these ordinances will be established you know uh uh the the paying the tithes and all of that and and it will carry on it will come up to full light but we have to realize that uh that levi paid tithe why being in the lens of abraham which of course we will realize there was four generations back because it was abraham in his lions abraham would bring isaac isaac would bring jacob then jacob would bring levi so four generations back and that's the reason why that prophet of god will tell you uh right from the pre-de uh from from uh uh uh right back from the foundation of the word you know what god hired you in in your mind but you never came to to to attention or attraction in god's mind until back in your full generation that god starts to keep his eyes on you praise the lord now let's let's uh let's move on because we can we can spend the whole night on this verse 19 right there in the same chapter 7 the lesser is better than the greater verse 19 he talks here also verse 18 for there is verily a disannoyment of the commandment going before for the weakness and on profitableness thereof for the lord made nothing perfect amen it was only an expression of what was in god's mind god was on it expressing what was in his mind so you think about it think about what is powerful the thought the word or the manifestation praise the lord well you can think about it for the law make nothing perfect but they're bringing in of a better hope it gives us an expectation what to look forward to it brings in the bringing in of a better hope praise the lord amen by the witch we draw night unto god verse 22 of the same chapter amen verse 22 by so much that jesus made a surety of a better testament praise the lord but robert wilson spoke here on easter when he talks about the test theater in the testament amen the testament is is not in fact until the tested or die because the testament is the will of the testator praise the lord so what paul is saying here is that jesus brought us a better testament amen because moses brought the old testament uh uh the plates and and uh he broke it the first time he went back and bring it again and and then i left it with the people and then i mean and he was ticking but when jesus brought his testament praise to the lord after he died to release the will of the testament he rose again to come back and back up thy will praise the lord glory be to god amen so he jesus brought us a shortage of a better testament glory be to god chapter 8 verse 6. but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry but how much also he is a mediator of a better coveting a better coveting which is established upon better promises praise the lord amen because you see that's what happened in in in the early church you have to realize that just like how mao mean brought roof into the land of israel forbes to marry her and also redeem everything that now milos that is the same way the gospel had to come through the land of of of the jews to be able to get us as a as a gentile bride are we together praise the lord so you see that when the when when the electro after the holy ghost came and and and those disciples you know uh uh the words started coming to to to life the first time you can see peter standing right out there and says this is that wish the prophet joel spoke about he was able to find something that he can relate the old testament tool so the word started coming to life this is what we've been reading all of these years but you see when people are bound to crease and when people are bound to church dogmas the early church struggle as chapter 15 that's what happened because now gentiles were believing after peter went and preached to the gentiles in acts chapter 10 and they received the holy ghost praise the lord but you have to realize all of their life they have not associated with gentiles gentiles have not come into their temple they have not gone into gentiles playgrounds now so there was a struggle in the back part of their mind is this thing really of god peter struggled in a vision peter eat he said no i'm not eating nothing unclean the angel said peter eat he said no now god was going to show peter the thing that he would struggle with after he realized that the gentile received the holy ghost you know what peter said if you if you go back in acts chapter 15 peter said that i wish that we we jews received the holy ghost like the gentiles dead praise the lord because the jews they waited for a sign but for the gentiles i speak it preach the word praise the lord let me tell you he was not he was not your your modern day evangelist all peter was doing he was standing behind that pooping whether he was a puppet or whether he was sitting down all he was doing he was just testifying of the things that they have seen in the ministry of jesus christ he was just having a conversation with him but because the people were honored so much expectation the holy ghost came down peter said i wish we did receive it like the gentiles in acts chapter 15 he uh he challenged the council he said i saw it with my eyes these people received the same holy ghost like we did but what was the early church doing they wanted them to be circumcised amen they wanted them to hold some form some identity of of judaism praise the lord so you see when people get attached to documents things that they have learned all of their life in church even if they see the truth they struggle with it because this is the way that we have done it all of our life praise the lord even though they saw a man thou was lean maybe he's been sitting at the temple gate since he was a teenage boy he got to drag himself every every morning to come there and sit there and beg for arms everybody that went into the synagogues knew this man and right before the eyes they saw his his joints bones sounding and all his knees coming back and and that man when when peter and joe said savor and go we have not but what we have we give to you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk praise the lord it says we want to ask you in whose name you did this miracle praise the lord peter and john said jesus when there is a living truth before them praise the lord you see that's that's that that's that's one thing we don't realize how attached we become to our beliefs what a family believes what a tribal beliefs what are national beliefs well our religious beliefs we don't realize how attached we become to those things even sometimes we struggle to break free even when we know they are destroying our lives our beliefs lies in your subconscious the lies in your subconscious praise the lord you see that's why when the son of man make free it's not to move you from one church building to another church building no he makes you free he goes in your spirit he goes in your subconscious to deliver you from some of those attachments because we become so attached praise the lord those things are there and that's what was happening to these people you realize there were where paul testified of how i rebuked peter because paul i mean peter was trying to to eat with the gentiles he was trying to fellowship with the gentiles amen and trying to fellowship with the gentiles he saw other jews coming what he did he he shrank why may him to do that it was something that he was attached to emotionally attached in his spirit praise the lord so we see all of these things how uh a better testament a better mediator a better promise a better coveting praise the lord amen i'm just trying to get to my scripture reading and not even started preaching here so just uh just bear with me in a little bit amen i hope you had a good breakfast this morning amen you know when you have a good breakfast before coming to church if you have too much it'll make you sleep amen if you just have a little bit just to kick that blood up going man it makes you enjoy the word praise the lord chapter 9 let's look at chapter 9 verse 23 the lord be merciful happy for jesus now we talk about a better covenant than a better promise chapter 9 verse 23 the uh the apostle paul is also going to show so you see here he was he was trying to make them to know you know the the prophets the law gave us these things but it was just a shadow it was just a shadow the life has to travel on praise the lord amen the life has to travel on you see that that's that's what happened when you know when uh you know when when when the baby is born oh my goodness that's the cutest thing on earth oh she's so cute oh he's so cute look at his cheeks so cute praise the lord amen as soon as i try to start getting off the floor and start throwing everything down from the table oh my what a trouble he is my goodness this boy praise the lord amen he's so cute while you're full of trouble god be to god and then when the child grow up when they get into their teenage years this test to find an identity they try to find a personal identity they try to struggle to detach themselves away from what daddy said or mommy said i mean sometimes not in the bad way sometimes it's in a bad way and uh but as as they start doing that uh uh then there is another thing also that is happening to the parent they start getting afraid oh my god he have never gone to the mall by himself oh my god where is he he have not called me yeah oh my god he's going out with his friend oh my god you know they start becoming afraid praise the lord but it's just a life that is traveling coming to full maturity praise the lord amen and then it gets to the place where the uh the board or the girl started start having a friend that that they are interested in just like i said young people i was thinking about speaking on the subject i'm praying about it i don't know maybe i might do it next week and that would just be dedicated to my young people amen so any young person from 100 years old down you are invited it's only for the young people amen only for the young amen if the lord uh want us to do that if not we'll find a better time to do it you know so that that that happens you know but we have to realize that uh you know uh uh that little baby that was secured i think and the one that was killed in photo trouble is the one that has come to this place in their life where they announced a man or noun the woman to get on a head ship in in all of that and uh you know it's it's it must bring us to the place where we can find a place of rest knowing that everything that i've you know uh uh installed into my child you know uh they are going to do do the best now and if if we become trouble that someone out there is going to influence them then it's a reflection also that we never really did some good foundational work if you have some good foundational work laid down you just have to trust the lord amen train up a child in a way that they will go and they will never depart from it amen even if they try to go away they will never leave them now so it's it's all of those things i'm just trying to bring those things out there but let's let's go ahead right here that's chapter nine and uh [Music] praise the lord verse 23 that's what we were going to look at to have nine verse 23 verse 22 says and almost all things are by the law parched with blood and without the sharing of blood is no remission praise the lord that's the reason why that chorus we signed this morning or just before we entered into the word it was just uh now for music but without the sharing of blood there is no remission and uh i won't do that tonight but we trust the lord to be able to find time to do that and show you what was different between the synagos and the temple praise the lord amen that's the reason why the jews do they don't have a worship they're having they having stripes and people that are reading the lord and everything they are doing they're trying to keep the lord of moses and everything that they are doing you know it's it's wonderful as as they try to keep the torah you know the dress and and and you know the weather white everything to do all of those zionists and everything but you see their worship is not accepted to god because god will not accept a worship without blood and they don't have a temple they don't have a temple to make sacrifices praise the lord amen they don't have a temple to make sacrifices do you see how god in in his design he had to do that because now this is the dispensation of the gentiles and god's attention is on the gentiles praise the lord and the day that god turned his heart eyes back on the jews they would have the rare offer they would have a temple ready for sacrifice they will have everything that they need for sacrifice and it's that day that god will accept their worship praise the lord i believe that's the reason why a lot of the a lot of uh uh the the evangelists are trying to bring bring jesus to them our sacrifice because god will not accept worship with our blood we can bring to god no bloodless worship praise the lord amen when people just want to you know uh you know just want to be fancy and just want to be needed and and all of that you know they don't want their hair dude to be messed up and they don't want uh you know uh stain on their cults and you you know and and all of that god will not accept a worship that is not bloody without the sharing of blood there's no remission it was necessary it was therefore necessary that the patents of things in the heavens the patents of things god told moses build the tabernacle according to the patent the pattern of things in the heavens it was necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifice than these moses built the tabernacle according to the pattern that god revealed to him genesis i mean exodus chapter 25 but yet he had to spring a blood on every instrument in a tabernacle praise the lord now so paul is saying here that even though those everything was built according to the patent but they needed to be purified with blood and even though moses purified them with blood when jesus died he had to go to the heavens he had to present himself in heaven that's why when mary saw him rabona he said touch me now woman i've never sent it to my father yet he had to take that sacrifice told the heavens that things in heaven and things on the earth will be sanctified by the sheer blood of jesus christ we have a better sacrifice praise the lord amen glory be to god amen amen hallelujah but the things in heaven themselves with a better sacrifice than this chapter 10 verse 34 hello i'm just reading bible today amen all of all paul was doing he was just exalting jesus he was just exalting jesus because he know he said if i be lifted up i will draw all men chapter 10 verse 34. he says for ye had compassion of me in my bounds and took joyfulness with joyful and and talked joyfully the spoils of your goals lauren in yourself that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance praise the lord it's talking to the to the to the persecuted hebrew church going through uh trials going through persecution there you know that you are losing effortless substance because of this gospel in heaven there are better better substances amen internal substance praise the lord chapter 11 verse 16. are we ever going to preach this morning amen but you see i've always believed that if you don't get yourself familiar with this bible you will never you will never appreciate or enjoy the message of the hour praise the lord because the message of the hour is not from mars it's a prophet of god that brought it out of the bible hebrews 11 16 praise the lord but now they desire a better country talking about uh all of those heroes you know looking for the city a country whose maker and beta is god but now they desire a better country that is and heaven wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he have prepared for them a sitting amen so we have better substance in heaven we have better country amen what more better can we talk about verse 35 he talks about that they might have obtained a better resurrection verse 40 he talks about god has provided a better perfection that there without us are not perfect and in chapter 12 he talks about the blood that speak at better things amen now i have read all my scripture can i preach well let's give the lord a hand of praise amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord amen glory be to god you know you know those uh those uh convenience stores are out there and say if you find it anywhere cheaper bring it we will beat that price i will tell you if you can find it anywhere better jesus would beat it if you can find life anywhere better jesus will beat it [Music] try him he will make it better for you young man [Applause] [Laughter] oh hallelujah he gave us a better hope he gave us a better sacrifice better substance in heaven better country to look for better resurrection better perfection better blood [Applause] amen praise the lord hallelujah if you think that we can makes you better try jesus christ get high on jesus christ hallelujah hey man you will get a better feeling a feeling that don't come with illness a feeling where there is no depression [Applause] oh hallelujah amen you know one time like many years back how as i was one of one of my friends one of my pastor back home and and then uh he's just a character you know we were walking down to this place and he saw this young man there that you know by the side of the street you know smoking and then he just walked to the young man and says and he says he says he said boy he says what would you do if you see that that it was few story building you see that building you see smoke coming from the top of the building just from the roof what would you do he says wow i'll call the fire service praise the lord it's just how when i was walking i saw smoke coming out of your nose i think you needed fire service [Applause] praise the lord and you know the surprising thing that young man gave his life to god and he's serving god today he got the fire service he got the fire service there were some fire fighters that came to his rescue [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i tell you try jesus he will make it better [Applause] you know one time he was preaching [Music] and and the crowd was coming on him praise the lord and he asked peter to use his boat for him to just preach so peter borrowed him his boat and after after the meeting he said well you guys you struggle all the night i just just throw your net on this side peter said we have tried everything lord i mean censor at one am this morning with being on this water i mean when when you lend him everything you know he's this neighbor he's this neighbor that lives so close to us when you learn in everything he give it back to you brand new [Laughter] [Applause] whatever you lend to jesus he gave it back to you brand-new [Music] praise the lord we want to speak a little bit on the blood i speak at better things let me try to do that in 10 minutes i'm going to be just like joshua and say 10 minutes you stand still until i get this work done amen praise the lord hallelujah but just to show you how i mean where we are the benefits that we enjoy praise the lord like the scripture says taste the lord and see glory be to god glory be to god amen but jordan were you able to to get uh can we try it uh there are some few uh uh uh pictures let's go to the book of uh pd let's go to peter i think praise the lord let's go to the apostle peter amen i mean it's so it's so amazing real is so amazing when you when you just look there and and appreciate the way the the word of god is so it's so wonderful amen what a blessing what a treasure that we have praise the lord if uh if the lord can only allow us to you know grow in the grace of that and and just and just appreciate everything that uh his love is doing in our lives hallelujah now in the uh second peter chapter one second peter chapter one now we will see that this is where paul talks about uh uh i mean peter talks about what we call the statue of a perfect man amen the stature of a perfect man now you you know the reading there so i'm just going to uh i'm just going to drop down a little bit now now peter peter says here verse two grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and and of of jesus our lord i call him as his divine power have given us all things all of these things that we have talked about better salvation better coveting you know better you know blessings and all of that that pertain onto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have caught us to glory and virtue wherefore by giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this year might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the word through lust now so we realize that this divine nature that god that peter is talking about here that god wants us to be partakers of those divine nature are his attributes those attributes of being a healer of being a savior a provider you know uh being a companion a comforter all of those attributes of god that's what uh he's referring to it's strange to know let's let's read them and then he and then he talks about all of this uh uh you know add to your you know faith that's you and and knowledge and all of that he comes to uh charity he says and if these things be in you and abound verse 8 they make you that year yeah and neither uh shall never be boring not unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus verse verse nine and uh but he that likes these things is blind which means he's he's deformed amen when you like these things that you you become stagnant in your growth and and cannot see a fire off and have forgotten that he was part from his own sin now this is what i want to grab you on this wherefore the rather brethren's give diligence to make your call and your election show for if you do this you shall never fall now there is a word that is used here that that is that is very tricky amen it comes very tricky uh let's see how how the how the amplifier brings it out because of these bridges be all the more uh eager to make sure uh to be strengthened to to make you're calling an election now that's that's the word there to make sure now in in the in the in the in the king james it say make your calling so it almost looks like something you can do something you should do no it's it's it's uh it's i was standing on standing there last night and and it kind of blessed me in a way you think about little samuel when samuel was asleep and the law was calling him he woke up and he went to elan he wanted to do what make sure who was calling him amen he was not going to make eli to call him he was trying to make sure who was calling him so the apostle peter is saying that you have to make sure who call you did you hear the voice of a church oh you heard the voice of the shepherd because he says my sheep knows my voice [Music] praise the lord man if you know that he call you no church can kick you out amen if a man calls you a man will discourage you amen but if he calls you so peter is saying make sure we'll call you make sure who casted their vote for you that's what we do in election brother adam says he casted his vote for me that they ever casted his vote against me when jesus casted his vote he casted his vote for you as his bride as his elite as a people in laodicean age so peter is saying make sure who call you who voice that you heard who are you following praise the lord amen now the reason is because he talks about this divine nature which of course i said the divine nature are god's attributes now so you will realize that the theory of evolution has existed and and signs the back around that theory for a long time until the dna core was broken when the dna core was broken the divine nature attributes when the dna call was broken praise the lord the starstore reversed the artery praise the lord amen because there are things that the dna called reveals praise the lord i was able to take few of these things from my friend charlie and uh i hope i can be able to to try to put it in sequence but you know sometimes i struggle to do these things praise the lord so uh uh brother brother brother jordan you will help me and if you can just if you can just switch this slide off praise the lord let's go back to the dna code of life go back to the dna code of life maybe that will help us to be able to follow it the slider has the dna code of life i don't know how he appeared but that should be the second slide if if he went in the order that uh i have it here praise the lord it shows that while they are trying to figure it out back there it shows that there are there there are three billion runs on the frame of uh of uh uh uh you know three billion of all of these uh cells and and our dna code also shows that it's digital and in your dna it has error correcting your dna has error correcting you see that's the reason why a child can be born with some form of deformity and the doctor will check in and realize and says well as a child grow up it will correct itself because it's in is in our our dna error correcting praise the lord as a child grow up they they can be they can be stubborn they can be doing all sorts of things there is there is a junction in their life they will meet and you realize that thing starts to change because that's the way we were designed you see and that that it is that is what brother brandon brought out in the statue of a perfect man and what confuses the church is the world when paul said when peter said to your faith you can add to your faith where are you going to barf at you we dress to sell patients so people think it's something that you can work out no it's already in in that divine nature that divine nature that he has made us partake us off virtue is there passion is there knowledge is there all you need is the right environment and the right food as you grow there are things that will correct himself some of those stubborn habits and things we got from grandparents and and and things that is bugging a lot as you walk in the light as he is in the light the blood cleanses us in our spiritual dna we have correcting code that's the reason why it don't take legalizing to correct the church but abraham says the word corrects the error [Music] our dna have explode advanced language design my goodness what is that i don't know i'm not a doctor praise the lord i will borrow my nose to brother jordy he's the one that is the the man steadying blood and dna and colds and all of that so he can come and better explain it to us amen praise the lord amen so brother jordan if i'm saying something that is wrong here just meet me in the office you have an exploitative vines of language design the blood has a language it has a language that it speaks praise the lord you go somewhere then uh you know uh uh and you just walk in you you don't have your your name on on your back and nothing like that and someone sees you this is oh wow hey mr jones your father yeah the blood have just spoke a language oh yeah who are you just like your father the blood has just spoke it has an advanced language design that is more than our appearance praise the lord but this morning we're talking about a blood that speak better thanks the blood that speak better things this is just the human blood let me let me just show you some things quickly here uh i will not be able to like i said let's let's uh you take the slide i have the digital information system the in in in in our dna the dna is the master blueprint just like how god gave moses a blueprint to build a tabernacle so it can reflect the pattern that is in heaven your dna is the master blueprint praise the lord amen that's the reason why when they want to test what are the charters for you then they don't say send us your photo no they say go and do a dna test we want the master blueprint we want to mash it up so from the dna we have a transcript that is the rna which is now the photo amen then that that transcript a now goes into translation that is called protein so all of these it revolves in our body praise the lord you see we we don't know of all of these things that are happening we realize there are four vibes in our hearts where the blood pumps through they just go in cycle praise the lord amen no wonder we have full gospel that has the story of redemption praise the lord so we realize the other is from that translation you know well the dna you know produce the rna and rna they produce the protein and then it goes back again and the protein produce dna in it you know just like that in that cycle i i i want to get your attention here uh all the too much reading was was trying to put you to sleep so praise the lord let's take uh the the slide with uh uh the nicolette isaac the dna and and uh and and these four four uh uh subtypes now we we have these uh there in in our blood and and the way that they work is the other uh take the slide of the dna replication so those four four types of uh uh uh thing there in in our dna the replicates in a way were two of them two of them meets all the time so the yellow and the orange were made and the grain and the blue will meet as as the meat they produce themselves it happened so fast praise the lord it happened so fast now go let's go to the next side slot of of the dna replication they it happened so fast that they as they produce themselves their breaks up they breaks up and then they start producing themselves again praise the lord that's how the works in our body they work so fast they breaks up they produce themselves they breaks up they produce themselves the breaks up it just it just go on and on and on and on and on praise the lord sometimes we we don't have no no idea of what is taking place in this body of how this body is built is made praise the lord now so uh uh that would be all that would be all for the slot i could go on and on and on i have a bunch of them but uh i'm out of time here so yeah that thank you for the light back on let's just move right on here now so uh uh uh the the reason i show you this is that uh uh when we come back to what the the apostle peter was telling now you have to realize also that was peter letter back to the jewish to the to the hebrew church and when paul when peter wrote them now so you will see here that uh he's trying to let them to realize that he freely through the sacrifice through this better blood that this blood that speak better things he has freely given us all things all things that pertain to life life here in life beyond the grave that's the reason why there is there is not a dull moment for a son of god or a daughter of god we leave this life and we step into another one praise the lord you might lay my body down there in the grave but i have stepped into another one but i'm saying before you get the honor takeoff i've gotten into my new body praise the lord so peter was trying to make this emphasis to the church that you have to make sure who have called you praise the lord amen how did you get here how did you get here how did you got to this day how did you got to this address how did you got in that seat you are sitting praise the lord there is something more powerful than your will there is something that is more powerful than your will and i want to tell you this morning it's more powerful than ever destructive will in your body every world i want to make you stubborn and want to make you selfish and and want to make you just just order by yourself or all about this word there is something more powerful praise the lord and if if god designed if god designed our human blood to have an error correcting court praise the lord i mean it's a design if god designed our blood to have an error correcting court how much more how much more praise the lord it is in his blood to correct everything everything that came from the serpent every nature every desire [Music] praise the lord it's in this world everything to correct us back to the image that god made everything to correct us back to the image that god made you see that's the reason why in this in this last age god could take an an an an electoral uneducated kentucky man praise the lord that was born by a drunkard father he was the firstborn brother branham says i had 98 99 to be just like my father you see that's the reason why the angel of the lord protected him because by the natural blood there was no way that he could not end up drinking god has to come down with a commission do not drink do not smoke and god never only told him but god protected him because even though the world is preached to you you don't have the power and the will to carry it out god has to come and back you up [Music] [Applause] oh glory be to god hallelujah the blood i speak of better things my goodness you love the lord brother brian talks down yet in uh going behind the camera he talks about when the chinese he talks about when they came into the country he says they couldn't read or write our language but this started all the laundry business you know he talks about how the the the the chinese laundry man when you come he will you know he would take the sheet and just call it into half and then give you half and then he keeps half and then when you come to take your clothes you got to make sure that the two half match yeah yeah praise the lord he says you go down there he says so when you come he just he just take the two little paper and marching together now he gave you one piece of paper and then he kept he kept another one amen praise the lord he says when you come he says let me see your piece of paper and he got them if a march that was it you got your daddy you got your your daddy clothes back clean and jesus match every prophecy amen that was what paul was trying to bring to the hebrew hebrew christians that jesus marched every old testament scripture everything that was done in the old testament he mash it and he's the better one praise the lord oh my goodness and jesus march every prophecy every design every design every design just what we went through in the book of hebrew it's a design 12 different verses verses that paul will try to proof he was trying to prove to those jewish believers amen i believe when uh when the writers of the bible were putting it together they never even realized it they were just they were just in interpreting they were just you know translating everything that was that was given to them but there is out there for us jesus march every prophecy every design jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the kneel he marched everything oh i love this i love this now brother branham said you listen to me he said let me say this with godly fear and respect but love and sincerity ignoring where i'm standing and i stand with that prophet this morning amen knowing where i stand he says the message of this hour has marched everything the bible spoke of of this hour praise the lord and let me tell all the critics you can see all the errors around the message but there is a correcting code at the appointed time god is going to line everything up and get his bride ready for the rapture god put a correcting code praise the lord you can see all the era with the preachers all the era with the church member all the errors in the message but what you don't see is the correcting quote [Music] praise the lord you can see all the error in the chat i don't know why all of you see coming on my child oh and i don't know yeah yeah i don't know it's the water is that you can see all of those things but what you don't see you don't see the correcting code that is behind that dna as the child grows up it starts running into line that's why the critics don't see they don't see the correcting call it was god that i said you i would i would present myself a bride without spot or wrinkle glory be to god hallelujah amen oh praise the lord my my my mind the message of the hour march every everything the bible spoke of of this hour now if you got some dirty clothes this morning if you got some daddy clothes i mean daddy thoughts i mean daddy habits praise the lord glory be to god you don't have to be you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to be afraid praise the lord you know there was something that that that that's kind of uh you know uh i would say the lord there with me during during the week and i was thinking about it i mean you know just just like the enemy does all the time he's he's so quick in his devices he always run ahead praise the lord and i was i was thinking about what i was driving or something i was doing it and and the talk just came to my mind i was i was thinking on the court and and i was saying to realize how god gave us his word and this word holds the promises of god praise the lord and god will send us a ministry in this last day that once again will quicken the world from the bible bring the word and life to us praise the lord amen but you know what the devil has done he went ahead of us praise the lord and he takes that word he knows there are many of us that will still stay with faith praise the lord but he goes and and and when we read the word actually it is god giving us his armor his protection praise the lord we read a word or we listen to a message and pretty soon we hear something brother branham says we go we check it we we print the cuts and and and we try to share it it's not bad in doing that but you see if you don't take that that court and apply it to your own life and say god you spoke to me this is your promise and say be it on to me just like your word said i mean you can put it on facebook you can be just to edit good but it will be no good to you until you take that word and apply it to your very life if you would take the promises and go down on your knees and say god i read in your word this morning you said no weapon form against me will prosper [Applause] but we tried to show how many quotes we have read and try to show why i've seen something in the message saying something my goodness and all of those things that little prosperity is hanging behind it if you get some daddy clothes turn them in praise the lord and i promise you this morning you will be watching the blood of the lion [Laughter] hallelujah amen if you have some dead clothes this morning glory be to god hallelujah turn them in there is enough error correcting code in the building this morning to change your life praise the lord the musicians can come that was tough here the reason why john says if we have no sin we make him alive he says if we walk in the light as he is in the light that's the christian bar soap to be watched if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us praise the lord when we walk in the word when we walk in the word when we walk in the light of god's word when god speaks something to our heart or relays something to us and say lord that's your word i believe it praise the lord thank you for speaking to me it's now practicing days and practicing that no just walk in the light there is enough error correcting court in this bible verb talks about jesus you have been a 12 year old boy when mary came and says your father and i the error correcting core was in the 12 year old body but it never missed the mark [Music] the word corrects the error i said don't you know i should be about my father's business [Music] no matter what you're struggling with what you're dealing with there is enough there is enough [Music] error correcting code in the building this morning that's why god sent the promise of his holy spirit back to the church it can correct your life [Music] praise the lord [Music] it can straighten you up but you see the thing about it there is that he's not going to force you off your will [Music] no he's not going to [Music] praise the lord [Music] you know one time i listened to the testimony of of rare boss [Music] i used to love his music i still sing them today because it's all about jesus he have chosen his path in life and he was talking about how he sunk a music he sang a song called that's what the altar is for and every time he sang that song what was in his mind was he was struggling with homosexual desires and all that he was all into that in but in his mind he thought that by sinking that song he was telling god that lord i your altar praise the lord he said that's why the ought to fall it's for us to bring our burden but it looks like every time he was so you see this is not what we think it's not it's not the good intention we just have to do what the word of god says praise the lord [Music] you know because i mean you can go you can go this morning from under this preaching and say well you know i have an error correcting core i'm just going to continue to do what i'm doing when that time reach god is going to correct me it might be on your dying bed praise the lord or it might be just like taking one of those slime and breaking their legs or the father one it's just for us to surround ourselves we have a blood that speak better things speak better things than the blood of abel they speak better things than any of our natural blood no matter whether you were born in holy well or out of holy warlock there's a blood that speaks better things [Music] praise the lord [Music] oh jesus the light of

it looks like they just disappear from our lives natural habits and different things and you know some spiritual things brothers and sisters help us to realize this morning that the dna code has been the defined subject to the evolution theory because i mean there are just a lot of things we could get in there and talk about it and uh all the different codes right in that dna it has punctuation where it can stop they have a time to start they have a time to stop and that's that's the way the almighty god has built us [Music] oh people we are not following they couldn't devise people this is not just mentoring this is a move of the almighty god this is a move of the almighty god [Music] he reaches to the lord oh it can reach to our lowest part it can reach to our despised areas of our

the prodigal son that's the reason why when the prodigal son came back the father did not yell ahead and fuss with him while the father did the father set a feast for him you know i used to tell
