========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] there was not to listen to it it was unstable and said any man that spoke in tongues and these things have claimed to be healed the sick and so forth by prayer that it was to leave away from it and to pray for those poor decrepit people because if they were in an illusion that there was something wrong with them oh how I would have liked to have talked to that brother just a little while and he said that the uh that that was only given for the apostles at the day of Pentecost and that was all I find that 30 years later Paul was ordaining these gifts in the church in First Corinthians 15 that he set in the church the gift of speaking in tongues Miracles and all these other gifts was set in the church Jesus said that go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world who to Every Creature they've never received it yet and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world who to every creature these signs shall follow them in all the world and every creature these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues if they'd taken up a deadly thing or surfing or drinking a daily thing will not harm them they'll lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that was his last commission to the church Mark the 16th chapter Paul's are dating these gifts into the church 30 years later and said in Galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel then this which is already received see already been preached let him be accursed I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to be to every creature all times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessings should be upon the people and now what is this Pentecostal blessing it's a confirmation of the Resurrection no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news of what he's raised from the dead and because I live ye live also he was for Once Dead is sin in trespasses God has quickened us together but that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead and we are now sitting in Heavenly places with him communing with him talking with him what a joy to tell people that story that believes it to be the truth I'm wondering today that's what's happening are we really getting the people to go are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ that's where this quickening power it's good to go to church sure if that's as far as we go oh it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that General Resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead for if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also Quicken make bring to life your mortal bodies what a promise to us now notice the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that Jesus has raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living he lives here he's in us I'll be with you even in you a little while in the world seeth be no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you unto the end of the world now as Christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened from uh quickened from life from Death To Life by his spirit and if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive now we're going to break into this subject the Lord willing and kind of teach it for a few minutes how that are we quickened and can we be sure that this is the truth now this is your own life this is my life it's where that the if this is the truth what I'm fixing to say then I'm one of the most foolish people in the world I've given my life for something there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth then I owe everything that I am oh everything that I could be to the cause of which we're standing for and I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm and as we see Easter approaching it just does something down in me as I I know that that's uh the day that the thing was sealed forever in the sight of God now we notice it's the same spirit that raised him from the grave that is dwelling in us now how could that be the spirit that raised up God Jesus from the dead has dwelling in us now now is the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does it now the wheat alone is just the wheat but when the quickening life gets into it into the wheat then it gives it life and we which were once Dead made in the image of God and yet dead is sin and trespass there's some way God had to get this quickening life into your mortal bodies I'm talking about your body now Jesus was the word you believe that don't you in the beginning Saint John 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now as the promised Messiah he quickened every word that was prophesied that he would do he oversick and high be born of a virgin all that made it it's true he was the word manifested here on Earth but he could not do this just as a man if taken the spirit of God dwelling in him to Quicken these promises to him uh hoping we get this real clear now Jesus being a man himself the body but it took the spirit in him the spirit it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's the one that does the works see Jesus himself lost the word because he was before God this is a bad word to use and I hope you take it right before a crowd but he was predestinated by the foreknowledge of God how God's plan was to be that he would send a redeemer and this Redeemer could only be his own son so that that was God's promise all the way from the Garden of Eden that Jesus would be here here he was as a man born of a virgin but it taken the spirit of God to Quicken that word to him and he was the word quickened the word Quicken for that hour the time that come when you had to have a redeemer the law had failed other things that fail now it takes a redeemer and he was the promised Redeemer he was quickened by the word of God and now if that same spirit that was up on him to be the Redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promise of in this last days what would take place if you become part of that word you are redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwelt in Christ is dwelling in you quickening your life to this age and it will also in the end time Quicken your mortal bodies resurrect and bring him up again that takes the Gloom away when we look at it and that and that's the truth see Romans here Paul has proved it to us see if the spirit that raised up Jesus and the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies this is the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the True Believer to eternal life the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells into the believer quickens the believer to eternal life there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's God God Alone is the Eternal and that weeping is children are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes a word that each individual in here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in God's thinking it's the only way it could be because you're an attribute that's an expression of a thought has become a word and a word has taken life and it's Eternal that's the reason we have eternal life in the same principle that the great Son of God the Redeemer we become Sons and Daughters of God through that same Spirit by the same foreknowledge of God amen look at the Millions on Earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was shared but how thankful that we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proves that we are included in that great Resurrection morning coming that great Easter we have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies the predestinated ones are the first of course to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own now there's a great statement and I want my Minister Brothers to try to understand this in the beginning God the great spirit he wasn't even God then he was the Eternal one God is an object of worship he had nothing to worship him there was no there was no Angels no nothing just God Alone him alone is eternal but in order to be God there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and beings and uh cherubims and so forth to worship him his great plan began to unfold but remember you and the the statue that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now for you there's some part it's in you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to God and God was his thinking of you setting right where you are now in his thinking I stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and knows all things therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he's eternal and you being a Son of God or a daughter of God then you were in his thinking at the beginning and then when the Holy Spirit come in your own Earth walking around here is a sinner way down in your life is something you don't know what's taking place but you're hungry I heard the Presbyterian brother I heard the the Baptist talking about back there he was a a Free Will Baptist preaching where he can my fellow brother that you there's something in you something that you never put in there it's something that you couldn't desire to be in there if something is contrary to your own nature it's a foreign knowledge of God taking place God's word as Jesus is born the Son of God to be Emmanuel God's full expression in a man and he found him in perfect obedience down at the river of Jordan that task for that prophet and as soon as he obeyed him and walked out of the water the heavens opened to John and he saw the Holy Ghost descending from Heaven saying this is my beloved yes perfect obedience the spirit had sought him out in obedience oh Wayward man or woman this morning when you're sitting here and there's something in you telling you this is right it's a holy spirit seeking you out to bring you to a knowledge of Truth of this hour that we're now living not some hour that's gone by the hour now there was thousands there that are obeying our past but there was a present tense hour that was the hour that Jesus was to appear and there stood the word there stood the people and here was a manifestation of God taking place to vindicate that that was the truth and it's Pentecostal people today let me say this that we're standing in this last days where God promised he'd pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh and his sons and daughters should prophesy according to say these signs shall follow them and believe it's the hour that's what makes that Creation in you because I spoke here not long ago it sounded a little sacrilegious but I hope it don't tell you this morning the farmer that set the eagle or set the hen and had an eagle egg many of you remembers the story of the old Eagle giving birth to to this or the hand-given birth over here to this chicken or or egg of an eagle under her chicken feathers see it's the atmosphere the Presbyterian Church Methodist Church Baptist Church any of them can bring forth these Eagles sure it's the atmosphere that does it is Dr Bosworth you say you could take a hinting and put it over a under a pup and time down a puppet hatch out of chicken wow it's the atmosphere and when any church or any group that'll civil themselves together and pray until they're throw away their Creeds and things look straight in the face of God it'll bring forth Eagles this is hurt cause I'm standing here amen that's what I think this businessman's group has done trying to break up the atmosphere we're getting too clannish one belongs to this and that let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a Heavenly worship get the atmosphere right Eagles will be born and out of any church anywhere that's right and this little Eagle walked with the hen for a long time but the the clucking was kind of strange and he didn't understand what the hen meant when she scratched in the the waist of the manure piles in in the yards and that wasn't food to him and she eat bugs and so forth that eagle doesn't eat so it seems strange all to him and he was an ugly duckling he was uh not seen as sacrilegious maybe it's a Free Will Baptist and but something on that order our Presbyterian but you know one day his mother knew that she had laid an egg there has to be a child somewhere so she thought her big wings into the winds and she searched then she searched screaming to the top of her voice and one day she passed over the barnyard and when this little Eagle heard this familiar scream you'd never heard it before but he realized that it fit him like a glove over him and he knew that was his mother she knew that was her son she was looking for him so has gone every age ordained his church for that age a message for that age and they could have laws in anything that they want to but when that hour comes the Holy Spirit of God which is at the beginning thought out and spoke out for that age that Spirit hunts that egg and when he hears that message there's no church denomination you're going to hold it in around it's a different bird it's a different creature he's the eagle and he'll hear the scream my sheep hear my voice as someone said brother Williams Shifu my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow no matter how loyal the church has been how much it's bigger name is Scott when my sheep hear my voice which is the word a stranger they will not follow they'll go right straight to that word they can do it it's like a a magnet one day up in Indiana I was visiting steel mills and the whistle blowed and everybody took all their apers and began to sweep the out from their lays out into the middle of the floor the shavings that they'd made to the day and I was walking along with the man that was taking me through and he said watch this and so every man ladies is Vince dressed up on the up on the table walked away way back in the back he touched a little button and here come a big magnet through and it picked up every bit of that iron that was shaved off of those pieces uh it went out it demagnetized it it dropped into a cupola and was mailed it over for another piece of of goods the same thing axles or whatever they were building and I stood there and looked at that time I just lost myself and I said I'm wondering something he said what is it sir and I said I noticed that some of that didn't go up he said it's aluminum and the magnet is not magnetized to the aluminum see and he said then I said well do you notice there's a piece of iron laying across but you see sir it was bolted down I said I see and uh what do you talk it out and I said now what happens that out there says it goes right back into the mill poured out to the cupola it comes right back and makes another wheel I said praise the Lord that's it see there is a great magnet sitting in the sky that God one day will touch his fingers to him no man knows the time he's coming not even the angels of heaven doesn't know God Alone knows but there is been some trimmings that's come off of the Bible Bible Christians Believers for this hour one of them might have been Axel back in another day this might be some other part it's going on to make the big regime of God but it'll be molded into the pop of God's Great cupolo and pour it out again into the images of God you are magnetized to it will be taken up all out of what a privilege it is to know that there is something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us now notice it recognize the call of God's word which is [Music] foreign [Music]
