brother one early this morning um i thought he was coming in tonight or tomorrow morning so i decided to touch base with him and right only to realize he's coming in tomorrow evening and he had a very busy busy busy schedule he worked on wednesday flew down to dc heart service but ajaru had to come for him they drove four hours to north carolina to go and have another service and he was really tired and he said he had some migraines so keep him in your prayers yes there is freely are we are we are we giving but there is a cost to pay praise be to god so remember him in your prayers and tonight we have brother timothy ashon preaching to us for us um for those of you who have been around for two three years here i don't think he's a stranger to you [Music] this is his second home anytime he comes to the u.s so but for those of you who have never seen him before he is timothyashon from ghana i know some of you may have heard this story maybe once or twice how one evening i went to the liberia camp and i had an evangelist preaching i never mentioned the name of the evangelist this evangelist was preaching and as a matter of fact he had finished preaching when i got there [Music] and he was just recapping what he had already preached so pretty much i didn't get to hear what he said but i just got a few just a few and right there and then i said this is what i have been looking for praise be to god and that evangelist happened to be brother team praise be to god and there is a special relationship between us and oftentimes you will hear us calling paper pay i may be older than him [Music] but i call him pepe yeah because he means a lot to us praise be to god i know we all have i mean um our journey how we got to christ it just varies one you know from one to the other but is god doing the calling praise be to god so at this point oh welcome brother timothy has shown to come over while we sing i know he taught us a song here one time and we have signed it here

[Applause] [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] i [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] aren't you glad that jehovah as the fanner say [Music] so that said does it yes if man there will be a problem but once you over decide nothing can change it and it takes the decision on us and when it takes decisions on us it's settled it does not matter what anybody thinks or what anybody feels jehovah said you are forgiving you ever said you are free [Music] that's funner it doesn't matter what you even think about it it does no matter what you even say about it jehovah said this is my choice he made that decision and that's funner i'm glad that he has the financing let's have a word of prayer i do heavenly father we are very grateful that indeed you have the final say yes it does

scriptures to encourage ourselves and praise the lord so we are grateful to the almighty god is so good to us and we love it so much and our prayer is that it will help us to love him the more yes because what else can we do what else can we do when he has been so good to us what else can we do than to love him praise the lord so nice to see your sister misha and every one of you and uh good to see you uh brother steve and the wife and everyone god bless you amen so let's read from the book of deuteronomy that the fake book of moses the torah lord know me whatever it is let's read a few lines from there and then we'll raise some few lines from matthew yes the rest will be quoting as we go deuteronomy chapter 7 let's read from verse 17 just some few lines if thou shall say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispose how can i dispose them that shall not be afraid of them but shall we remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt the great temptations which the eyes saw and they are and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brody out of out so shall the lord that god do unto all the people of whom that are afraid amen so let's read again from the book of matthew just say so if you verse matthew chapter 14 and matthew chapter 14. let's read from verse 26 of 25 let's take 25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear and straightway jesus spoke unto them say be of good here it is i be not afraid amen may the lord bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated god bless you brothers and sisters young old mothers and fathers husbands and wives may the lord be with us all amen so just for this little time that we have i want to speak on be not afraid be not afraid praise the lord the prophet of god said god does not want his children to fear god does not want his children to fear but god wants his children to believe god does not want us to fear so god does not want you to fear say to yourself god does not want me to fear me but he wants me to believe yes because there is no virtue in fear god does not want us to fear because fear torments and as it is said the things that you fear are the things that comes to you so he doesn't want you any of his children to fear that's why in all the spirits everywhere he says don't fear amen in the scripture that we read god speaking to the children of israel and telling them what as he was giving them the land of canaan or the promised land he mentioned to them and you told them the land which i am giving to you to possess there are people there the other kinds that invite the devil sides or gigantics and different people are they but i am giving it to you go ye and possess the land and here he was also telling them if that was in the heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them they are more than us he also spoke to them in detroit chapter 20 telling them again here when that goes out to battle against an enemies and seers us and tarots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god his wife thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt when you see assists and chariots and people that are more than that that's a situation you come into a situation you are overwhelmed a situation that you don't know what to do you are in crisis you are look he said you see horses and terrorists that are more than doubt somewhere in the scripture god was speaking to me he said i'm not giving you this love because you are so many say you are the fewest you are the fewest and the nations that you go to meet they are stronger they are mighty they are powerful but thank god that our strength is of jehovah [Music] jehovah is our strength and jehovah is our god and the bible says blessed is the nation who has the over as your god so if you have jehovah as your god you are blessed [Music] jehovah says don't be afraid no matter the situation brother brian said there are two there are two elements that controls everything in this life and those two elements are one is fear and one is faith amen as we are here he said we are controlled by one of those elements of forces or powers so which of these powers which of these forces dominates our life because the way we list shows what is dominating your life your conversation your way of life it shows what is dominating your life [Music] so which of these forces at this hour is dominating your life is it fear or faith amen there is the scripture tells us there is a fear of god and with the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom and that is reverence you reference god and because we reference god we obey his word that's right you reverence you believe god and if you believe god you fear god you reference him you see if you don't believe in something you will not fear it you will not fear it but if you believe so we are told to have the fear of god and when we have the fear of god will be reverence we will obey his word that is the fear of god and you want to please the lord you want to do his will you want to save him hallelujah he said but we are taught not to fear the enemy that's what jesus said in the ghostbusters look fear not little flock don't see a little frog little frog israel was a little flock god said there are nations kingdoms mightier bigger than that but don't fear them he said when they come to critical they remember amen remember how the lord brought you out of it he said that shall not be afraid of them if thou shalt say in thy heart these nations are more than i how can i dispose them they are more than us they are stronger than us they have this more than us they have that more than us how can we dispose them then he said thou shalt not be afraid of them but shall we remember but shall we remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and enjoyed it when you look around you see them and they are mighting their power they say how can we dispose them god said go to the land possess the land possess it and you say how can we process how can we get them off the place he said then you shall remember what the lord your god did oh that god will help us to remember where you have come from where you have come from what he has brought you from hallelujah what he has done for you what he did for you years ago or days gone by a month goes by and what he has brought he said that shall we remember god don't want his children to forget when he does anything for them amen he don't want you to remember forget it you always want us to remember he wants you to remember so remember what he has done for you remember what he has done for you don't forget don't forget because we easily forget and because we easily forget we complains we manage because we easily forget god said when you are confronted with a situation you say how can we dispose these people he said you shall well remember what i did in egypt to pharaoh and to egypt remember the pharaoh that was one ruling your life remember the pharaoh that was one ruling your life the power that was one controlling you we were under the power of pharaoh the devil set and controlling us we had no choice we were beating left and right it's a dash our way remember somebody say lord help me not to forget help me to say that's yes what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and to all and unto all egypt it was a super power at that time egypt was the greatest nation at that time it was so powerful like america is today or russia is today and you talk about god's people that have been enslaving for 2 thousand uh four hundred years and they were tormented and they were afflicted and how are they going out but god said they will go out whether the egyptians like it or not whether they were prepared or not god was prepared and so it is today god is prepared he is prepared to have a church a groundless check a chat with that spot and with that wrinkle he is prepared to save and to save to the utter mode he is prepared to deliver whether satan like it or not god is prepared to deliver and that is what you are here for [Music] it was not satan's choice to leave you it was god's decision it was forced upon him let my people go [Applause] hallelujah it was not pharaoh's toys philly was not ready to let them go but god said i have remembered the promise that i met with my friend through servants oh god give us grace to be faithful god give us great to be obedient god give us great to be surrendered to him he says i remember what the promise i gave to abraham you are fathers because of the obedience they were benefiting from the obedience of the fathers they were blessed for the obedience of the fathers may god have mercy upon us and make us obedient so that our seed that will come after us will be blessed let my people go so that they will save me god brought them out of bandage out of captivity so that they will have time to save him and today listen god has brought us out so

we give so many excuses oh yes nice excuses good excuses but remember a life full of excuses is not even worthy of the gospel we were taught in scripture how they were invited to the marriage supper and every one of them give an excuse i just married and even the law says when somebody married should not go to war the scripture say the scripture says i should not go to war someone said i just bought new life i'm going to inspect my land i i just got new business i just got new job you know i just got this and that that's fine you remember when gaming i was going to war and he called the people and they come to they said let's do that afraid go back say praise the lord thank you pastor thirty two thousand twenty two thousand went back just josh you are telling the given telling that those that are fresh you go back 22 000 went back those that have just married and god said joshua they are too much even for me it was level for about ten thousand said they are too many tell the people bring them to the river let them drink water let me make a that's selection let me make a selection let them drink the water what does that would pick behind and drink and those who put their mouth in the water and separate them and when they came everybody this side and go pick 300. 300 let the rest go so that these people will not say that by our might we've got the land so that they will know that it is me that have done it and the media night went uncomfortable innumerable but remember if god be for us who can be against us jehovah is our strength john is our head your offer is a power the over is our way the other is our life so be not afraid because it is not by might and it is not by your power not your might and not your power it is by the strength of jehovah that we dispose the enemy that will dispose the enemy that we overcome the enemy that will conquer the enemy so don't be afraid amen oh it's not by much oh it's not by power it's about by my spirit see of the lord by the spirit of the almighty god be not afraid god don't want us to be afraid god wants us to believe believe jehovah not yourself believe in god with all your heart before your mind of everything that is in you the prophet said the biggest trouble there is in the church today is a bunch of fear people always scared and thus and that is of the devil a bunch of fear people always scared and that is of the devil don't be scared be brave [Music] don't be scared be brave you don't have nothing there there ain't nothing to be afraid of you have to be brave the angel god speaking to josh i said be very courageous be brave stand as a soldier because cowards died ten thousand times before their death brave god wants us to be brave he said joshua be brave be courageous you are going to divide the land god has told joshua as i was with moses i'll be with you so be not afraid down below positions there will be challenges there will be trials but don't be afraid he said you are going to meet nations that are stronger and mightier than you but don't be afraid because i will be dead you miss situations you make crisis but don't be afraid told you shall no man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life no man but he has to fight you remember him meeting the angel the captain of the host that was standing there as a man with a sword not just him i was holding shot this man hold his sword begin to maybe dodge hide no that was not joshua god said you are going to divide the land and nobody shall stand before you i give you the promise nobody can stand so he has to pull his sword also [Music] and he went right to that man that was all this shot he went to write to him and he said are you for us or for our enemies who are you what are you here for what are you doing what's your mission here are you for us if he was not brave he would not have gone forward he would not have faced the opposition he would not have faced the enemy he would have run out where he would say that's a man with a soul there look at the man standing there we thought not joshua he knew what god has said god said as i was if moses i'll be with you and the lord jesus had told us i will never fail you i will never forsake you i will be with you to the cross today why are you afraid why are we afraid god has mercy upon us and that is why today we are being tormented every night like i have so many times to people so you don't have to be afraid like especially in this hour we are living this hour of pandemic pandemic we don't know what to do medical science has no answer they said today tomorrow they said this they said close your nose they say close your mouth they say what we are doing oh and all out take the job take the jump take we are doing all and still people are dying [Music] medical science is confused brother branham there will be diseases in the last day that science we have no answer that does not mean you should walk foolishly when they say wash your hands you cannot go and please i mean i don't care you're okay don't be foolish let's not wash your hands do what you can do as a man they say put on max fine whatever you can do sanitizer do it but the thing that we need to sanitize much today is our source [Applause] as we keep washing our hands washing our eyes let's wash our soul wash in the blood of jesus wash by confession confess your sins confess your wrongs lord cleanse me let bitterness be taken out of your heart let males be taken out of you let anger be taken out of god let jealousy be taken out of god let god actually to be taken out of your life sanitize your soul [Applause] [Music] may god help us listen don't live in fear live in faith when we have done all that we have done we committed ourselves into the hands of the lord like after the brethren if god never saw me die in this hour i will never die amen you understand that there are people that god saw them that this is the way they will go out of this world listen it is not by mistake listen god listen our coming into this life was designed by jehovah god [Music] you didn't choose when you should be born you didn't choose the age and the time to come in it is over that decided that this my son should go at this time come into the world at this time and leave exists out of this time in this time it should go out of here [Music] what matters is how we go the condition in which we live here that's what matters the state of your heart are we together that's what matters and i was preaching i was saying list the sense of god don't look at all these people they are weak faith that is why they have died with the virus or die with heart trouble i die with a neck trouble back trouble hey like i was talking to a brother one time visited me and if anything we want to eat even yum you put sugar on it as a brother it's a timothy if sugar don't kill you salt will kill you if not high blood pressure low blood pressure they are killed low sugar high sugar they were killed [Music] what are you going to do anything can take you out of here some people will go with whatever crisis pneumonia and and the diabetes and and and whatever peace and whatever that and not whatever lodges it does not matter to god what matters to god is what you did in your life brother said god can train a man for five years i mean for 40 years and use him for five minutes it does not matter what where you go the state in which you live here what you have been brought here to do did you do it amen may god help us john the baptist they cut off his head that was the prophet jesus of all that were born of women there's no greater than he was buried without his head because a prostitute was requesting for that a prostitute requested for the head of john the baptist you think his disciples didn't pray jesus himself was on the scene when they killed john the baptist was jesus not there the disciples of john they wanted to jesus what has happened yes when he was arrested he knew he could have prevented it but his mission was fulfilled you should remember when pharaoh or aaron sent to kill the babies from two years to one year i mean to a baby down john the baptist was there when the wise man came to jerusalem why is he that is broken of the jews and pharaoh told the watchmen you go and look for him when you finally come back bring me away my sister will go and worship him or what he's lying going worshiping you know brothers i please wouldn't funny just come back to me because we all have to watch it ducking god knew his thoughts may god help us may the lord help us straighten our thoughts give us good thoughts our thoughts must be the word of the lord because your thoughts becomes action when a wise man didn't come back what should this people have to see me and a sudden and they may calculate she said from that time they came it's about two years now all right you go kill off from two years to the one that was born right there john the baptist was there and he didn't kill him but god protected him the god that protected him continued to protect him protected him until his mission was accomplished and god will protect you and god will watch you and god will guide you and god will be with you until your mission has been accomplished and when he's finished with us we finish with this life [Music] somebody say praise the lord hallelujah the bible said james one of the elders in the church was killed by phil errod after james was killed the people were happy so aaron went ahead and took pity and he wanted to keep it and peter was sleeping in the midst of two soldiers one here one day with chains and the question is when james was arrested didn't the disciples prayed huh you think they didn't pray they prayed they prayed and prayed and prayed and he said it was cut off i mean they killed him was it because he didn't have faith no the master has a plan and the master has a purpose when peter was arrested the same believers prayed and when they prayed god came on the scene and remember when god said no it's as good as yes when you pray and god said no that is answer and you should be happy with the nose just as yes because god knows it's as yes because that is perfect will that's what he wants to be done the bible says at midnight the angel of the lord descended he went right to the prison nobody was guiding him he knows where he was nobody is here those people were afraid but the injured the people might not even know where they they place pity and if they know what would they have done because it was in the inner cell where maybe they keep hurting criminals can you imagine that sleeping in the midst of two soldiers why are there a fish a man with that sword without nothing the angel of the lord descended right to the prison he knew where he was and he knows where you are whatever condition whatever state he knows hey just be patient keep looking up to him keep trusting the lord because he he has a plan for your life and the blood that god has for you nothing can change it nothing can change it no devil no power no demon no sickness no matter what we cannot change the bible says a thousand shall fall at your side ten thousand at your right and it shall not even come near you it does not matter how many people died with covet or how many people die with this how many people died we had trouble how many people died with people are dying every day but until god has finished with me nothing can take me praise the lord are you are you following me there is nothing to fear if you have anything to do believe god god said don't be afraid because fear torments you and i want to say to you the god of the day is the god of the night the god in the valley is the god of the mountain hallelujah hey in the night god don't need such light to see night and day is the same to god so those of you that are always afraid of the night what are you afraid of the god of the dead is the god of the night there is no difference between day and night before god day and night is the same yeah so if you walk throughout the day and you are what do you fear in the night inside your room your fiance you can't get up to pee because of fear people pee in the bed you need a diaper god have mercy fear means people satanists nobody is after you you said this is after me lord help us god said fear not the trouble with the church today you are afraid you are afraid when you ask you want to receive it that's the reason you don't receive don't be scared ask and then believe you are going to get it and you will get it god will give it to you that's the trouble with the church today he's scared to death that you are going to to to to to to make a mistake or make a failure how can you feel when you are in christ you can't say when you are in christ you can't fail amen because jesus is the captain of our salvation jesus is the mighty conqueror hallelujah hallelujah you will make mistakes oh yes because you're human being but god don't even look at that one no no no no no no yep man you make mistake you come a lot i'm sorry please forgive me that's it i didn't mean it [Music] he will not hold it against you the bible says the bible says if a righteous man fought seven times he will rise up sure he doesn't give us lancers to say oh even the bible says when i fought seven times i will get up no no no no in the journey in the life we make mistakes we are overtaken by situations oh lord have mercy in a minute please from your heart god forgives you he doesn't hold it against you he goes back to the devil once you make confession he goes to the devil the devil is going to answer for it but a believer will never from himself willingly go no no no no he loves the lord he will not want to but if along the way the bible says little children i write unto you that you see not but if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous we haven't died don't let the devil pull it back you have done this you are not good again you might not be good to the devil but you are good to the lord tell the devil i may not be good to you but i'm good to my lord you did not save my life you didn't say my life you didn't do nothing for me leave me alone [Applause] point him to the blood that the son said i see a christian stream of blood he flows from cavalry oh it's weight which really the throne of god has sleeping over me when gloom and sadness whisper you have seen no use to play it's a look away to jesus and it tells me to say i see a cleansing stream of blood he flows from cavalry move away from me man [Music] praise the lord are you following that don't be afraid of failure don't be afraid go forward if you fail god will take care of it go forward hallelujah can you go i'm afraid i would be afraid go forward keep pressing now keep trusting the lord god don't want us to fear god wants us to believe him trusting every mile every step of the way trust the lord the devil will tell you do you see that this one died out of that sick disease you are suffering from and your own auntie also died that way so what might you do of that so what everybody can doubt that i don't care until jehovah has finished with me nothing can take me out of it oh yes do you remember in the scripture there were believers that were true to the lions then they went to the lion's den the lion could not eat him up there were believers that were eaten by lions is it because they didn't have it no they defy the lions the bible says some of them they refuse deliverance so we are not going to compromise we are not going to surrender let the lion eat us we love jesus and they stood there and they shamed the adversaries they put the enemy to shame they refused to surrender they refused to give up he said for us to live we better die [Music] they were heroes of the faith there was there were warriors they were faith giants like danny they were believers i've been to rome some of the arenas when they they they released lions to eat our brothers this some of these are nice in i rome oh my goodness you know help me with my time can i be able to stand whatever the lord whatever my part whatever has been designed for me god give me grace this believer stood there we pledge allegiance to the lamb of god will be true to the lamb of god they refuse to surrender they choose to die than to deny christ they give their lives so that the gospel can read to us their testimonies will be inspiration to us they were not afraid of death don't be tormented by death you are going to die you are going to die and then and then you become crazy you lost your mind because you are going to die and you are feeling sad and the same going to die what did god said if he in death we are not defeated [Music] don't be tormented by that we have a promise of the resurrection we have a promise of resurrection what is important is you and me to have a personal relationship with our lord jesus christ to be born again to be filled with the spirit of god to live the life of christ that is what is important some of our brothers were true to lions and they stood there my my my my listen not only men women boys and girls they stood for christ for this gospel this gospel split with blood this gospel they stood for this gospel they were not afraid their own lies their life was not dear to them what was so important today in life is to serve god is to live for jesus christ is to do the will of the father may god grace come upon us to do the will of the father sisters and brothers young and old surrender to jesus christ surrender your life to him for it is a privilege to serve the lord it is a privilege privilege more than a privilege to serve the lord oh yes oh yes it is a privilege to serve the lord and i'm thankful i am thankful to god for my own life what it brought me up from and by grace oh my he has kept me and by grace i'm suppressing you and by grace i will press on amen [Music] you will leave this for what you deny this for what god forbid in day young people there's nothing in that word nothing all that is there is shame and disgrace that's what he said nothing good today when he told adam and eve if in the beginning you become wise you know like god your eyes will be open what happens that's what we are suffering today that eyes that you hope is what we are suffering today you will be wise and then what and die that's where we are he hasn't got nothing good though don't listen young people don't listen to that devil that demon that will tell you you are missing something the only thing you are missing is sin foolishness is what you are missing you have something better you have holiness you
