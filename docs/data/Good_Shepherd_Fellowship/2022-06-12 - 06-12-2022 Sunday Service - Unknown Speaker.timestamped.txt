[46:46] until
[46:48] you have to be involved
[46:50] and we pray that the law will keep us
[46:52] safe

[46:59] is is a last day spirit
[47:02] that is that is uh
[47:05] that is getting hold of uh of us

[47:12] what paul said in uh

[47:16] verse 2 where people men will be very
[47:19] unthankful
[47:21] you know uh
[47:29] if we don't learn to thank god for the
[47:31] little things in our lives

[1:18:44] if you remember i told you i was going
[1:18:46] to bring something
[1:18:48] for you in the morn of june
[1:18:51] and i was trying to find the best time
[1:18:53] to do it
[1:18:54] and
[1:18:55] i realized that with our few meetings
[1:18:58] coming up we will be busy
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:03] with our visiting preachers
[1:19:06] and we might not have the time so i
[1:19:07] would just i would just want to use this
[1:19:10] time to start
[1:19:11] and then stir the water
[1:19:14] get you thinking
[1:19:15] and then the next time we meet
[1:19:17] we will go uh uh
[1:19:19] into details
[1:19:21] praise the lord
[1:19:23] but uh i will
[1:19:25] i will i will trust the law to
[1:19:27] to be able to uh
[1:19:30] uh having to help us
[1:19:32] go in in a certain direction and then
[1:19:34] i'll we will see if we'll find our forte
[1:19:37] now uh
[1:19:39] i was here studying yesterday and uh a
[1:19:42] good friend of mine came around and and
[1:19:44] then we're talking from one thing to
[1:19:46] another he said so brother one i'm here
[1:19:48] for us to pray
[1:19:50] and uh
[1:19:51] he didn't know how much that did well to
[1:19:54] me
[1:19:54] because uh
[1:19:56] you know you keep your heart before the
[1:19:58] lord you are steady you have some
[1:20:00] something on your mind but yet you're
[1:20:01] waiting for the lord to kind of confirm
[1:20:03] it and then while we were praying and i
[1:20:06] just heard the brother prophesying
[1:20:08] exactly what was on my heart so that was
[1:20:11] just a confirmation amen
[1:20:14] i just trusted the lord
[1:20:16] revelation chapter 21
[1:20:18] let's read
[1:20:19] about uh the new heaven and the new
[1:20:22] earth
[1:20:23] let's read about the new heaven and the
[1:20:25] new earth
[1:20:29] praise the lord
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:33] there is no parting in the scripture
[1:20:35] for the today's dating game
[1:20:39] there is no biblical pattern
[1:20:42] in the bible
[1:20:43] for what the word
[1:20:45] called the dating game
[1:20:48] and
[1:20:49] there is a there is a
[1:20:52] biblical instruction
[1:20:54] how to go about finding the wife how to
[1:20:56] go about trusting girl for the husband
[1:21:00] and i want to use this
[1:21:03] to be able to go in that direction so
[1:21:05] let's read
[1:21:06] revelation chapter 21
[1:21:10] and i saw a new heaven
[1:21:13] and a new earth
[1:21:15] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:21:18] will pass away
[1:21:20] and there was no more seed
[1:21:25] and i john saw the holy city new
[1:21:28] jerusalem coming down
[1:21:30] from god out of heaven
[1:21:33] prepared as a bride
[1:21:36] a dog for her husband
[1:21:39] praise the lord
[1:21:40] john is seeing
[1:21:42] the new
[1:21:44] jerusalem the new holy city
[1:21:48] coming down out of heaven as a bride
[1:21:50] prepared for her husband
[1:21:53] praise the lord
[1:21:56] and verse 3 and i heard a great voice
[1:21:59] out of heaven saying behold
[1:22:01] the tabernacle of god
[1:22:04] is with men
[1:22:06] and he will dwell with them
[1:22:08] and they shall be his people
[1:22:11] and god himself
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:14] god himself praise the lord
[1:22:17] not a trinity in god
[1:22:20] but god himself
[1:22:22] the person of god himself
[1:22:25] shall be with them
[1:22:27] and be their god
[1:22:30] praise the lord
[1:22:31] hallelujah
[1:22:33] are we together
[1:22:36] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:22:37] seat just keep your bible open
[1:22:45] and then if you drop pot down a little
[1:22:48] bit we can we can go ahead and read
[1:22:50] but we want to stay in in the context of
[1:22:54] what we want to
[1:22:55] study
[1:22:57] this morning
[1:22:59] if you drop down to verse 9.
[1:23:06] if you drop down to verse 9
[1:23:13] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:23:16] angels we have which had the seven vowel
[1:23:20] four of
[1:23:21] the seven large
[1:23:23] last plague
[1:23:25] and talk with me
[1:23:27] saying come hither
[1:23:29] i will show thee
[1:23:31] the bride
[1:23:32] the lamb's wife
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:36] first when john saw this
[1:23:40] vision
[1:23:42] he testified that he saw a new heaven
[1:23:44] and a new earth
[1:23:47] the first heaven the first earth will
[1:23:49] pass away
[1:23:51] and then he saw a holy city he saw a
[1:23:54] city
[1:23:55] and when he saw the city
[1:23:58] it was
[1:23:59] as a bride a door for her husband
[1:24:03] are we together
[1:24:05] then here he's also saying that
[1:24:08] this angel said come and i will show
[1:24:10] thee the bride the lamb's wife
[1:24:13] and he carried me away
[1:24:17] in the spirit
[1:24:19] okay i know that i did something that i
[1:24:21] should not have done
[1:24:24] i don't think you have my notes back
[1:24:26] there
[1:24:28] i'm not sure of that
[1:24:32] if you had it it would be supernaturally
[1:24:35] given to you
[1:24:39] praise the lord
[1:24:41] okay i just sent it back
[1:24:47] and so he said
[1:24:49] and he carried me
[1:24:51] away in the spirit
[1:24:53] to
[1:24:54] a great and a high mountain
[1:24:57] to show me the great city
[1:25:01] praise the lord
[1:25:02] the holy jerusalem
[1:25:06] discerning out
[1:25:09] of heaven from god
[1:25:12] praise the lord
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:17] now
[1:25:19] we see here that
[1:25:27] john saw a city
[1:25:30] and the city was as a bride
[1:25:36] and then now in verse 9
[1:25:39] he's told that come and see the bride
[1:25:42] and then he's shown a city
[1:25:49] praise the lord
[1:25:51] i want for us to grab that because if
[1:25:53] you do not sink in you won't get the
[1:25:55] picture
[1:25:58] hallelujah
[1:25:59] i saw
[1:26:02] a holy city new jerusalem coming from
[1:26:05] god out of heaven as a bride
[1:26:08] prepared for her husband i saw the city
[1:26:11] coming out as a bride
[1:26:14] prepared for her husband
[1:26:17] and a great voice said unto me behold
[1:26:19] the tabernacle
[1:26:21] of god is with men
[1:26:23] praise the lord
[1:26:25] and in verse 9 the angel says come i
[1:26:29] will show you the bride
[1:26:34] the lamb's wife and then he carried me
[1:26:36] away in a sp in in the spirit
[1:26:40] to a great in a high mountain and show
[1:26:43] me the great city
[1:26:48] i will show you the bride the lamb's
[1:26:50] wife he carried me and then he showed me
[1:26:53] a great city
[1:26:56] on a hill
[1:26:59] on a high mountain he showed me a great
[1:27:01] city the new jerusalem discerning out of
[1:27:04] heaven
[1:27:05] from god
[1:27:08] having the glory of god
[1:27:12] praise the lord
[1:27:13] why because the great city is having the
[1:27:16] glory of god because the great city is
[1:27:19] the bride and the bride is the glory of
[1:27:21] her husband
[1:27:24] that's why paul taught in first
[1:27:26] corinthians chapter 11 verse 7 that the
[1:27:29] woman is the glory of the man
[1:27:34] are we together
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:37] now uh uh for us to understand this
[1:27:42] for us to understand this
[1:27:45] uh we will look
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:50] in the message choosing of a bride
[1:27:52] brother branham
[1:27:56] said this he said
[1:27:58] now
[1:28:02] we yes see plainly
[1:28:05] the spiritual plane
[1:28:08] of god planning for his future home
[1:28:13] with his future bride
[1:28:16] comes into view now
[1:28:20] praise the lord
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] now so what is happening here is that we
[1:28:28] know that the the the new jerusalem that
[1:28:31] revelation chapter 21 is is is talking
[1:28:33] about the future home you go and read
[1:28:35] the message future home that's exactly
[1:28:37] the scripture brother branham is reading
[1:28:39] but yeah
[1:28:40] in in in presenting the future home
[1:28:44] he's also
[1:28:46] talking about
[1:28:48] his future bride
[1:28:53] are we together
[1:28:57] so
[1:28:58] in
[1:28:59] in one sense god
[1:29:01] thinking about a future home had his
[1:29:03] bride in mind
[1:29:08] praise the lord
[1:29:12] thinking about his future home he had
[1:29:14] his bride in mind and i would say this
[1:29:17] uh as i begin this
[1:29:20] uh uh
[1:29:22] you know you we we we listening to
[1:29:25] brother branham message
[1:29:27] and we thank god that he had given us
[1:29:30] the the grace you know to be able to
[1:29:33] to uh
[1:29:35] uh believe and accept brother branham
[1:29:37] ministry as the fulfillment of malachi 4
[1:29:41] in revelation 10 7 you know when and in
[1:29:45] luke 17 10 it and and all of those
[1:29:48] scriptures that
[1:29:50] we we saw being fulfilled in the
[1:29:52] administrator brother branham
[1:29:55] and uh uh i know i mean there there are
[1:29:58] many that are that are that are not yet
[1:30:00] dead they have not sinked into them but
[1:30:03] you see what uh what uh uh i i feel and
[1:30:07] believe that uh uh
[1:30:09] many of us are slowly coming into turn
[1:30:12] because uh even with god when you are
[1:30:14] first saved you don't understand
[1:30:16] everything you know slowly the law
[1:30:18] brings you into debt because a lot of
[1:30:21] brother branham messages that he
[1:30:23] preached and almost all his messages he
[1:30:25] preached was a prophecy
[1:30:28] praise the lord
[1:30:29] when he preached invisible union he read
[1:30:33] the scripture did in romans chapter 7 he
[1:30:36] says this is a prophecy of the church
[1:30:38] and
[1:30:39] you know so
[1:30:41] it's a prophecy but you see just like
[1:30:43] god
[1:30:44] for god to be able to help us to
[1:30:47] understand his plan of redemption he had
[1:30:49] to play it out throughout all the ages
[1:30:53] amen he had to use the prophets and
[1:30:56] joseph and all of these men to play it
[1:30:59] out for us to really understand so
[1:31:01] brother branham in bringing these
[1:31:03] messages he will take the example of a
[1:31:06] natural man and his wife
[1:31:09] praise the lord but you see that the
[1:31:12] problem there is that we did not
[1:31:15] understand the prophecy
[1:31:17] we started taking the the the the the
[1:31:20] natural illustration of the prophet to
[1:31:23] start you know to start making it an
[1:31:26] issue where uh uh uh we start making it
[1:31:29] like a law in order in a sense like we
[1:31:32] uh uh brother branham year is going to
[1:31:35] talk about see him talking here in in
[1:31:37] choosing of a bride he says now we see
[1:31:40] plainly a spiritual plan
[1:31:43] of god planning his future home
[1:31:47] for
[1:31:48] with his future bride
[1:31:51] comes into view
[1:31:54] and and pretty soon he's going to drum
[1:31:56] from that thought and verb i'm going to
[1:31:58] say when a man chooses to say why it
[1:32:00] shows
[1:32:02] what is in him
[1:32:04] praise the lord
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:06] and it's so easy now for you to take
[1:32:09] your mind from on christ they have
[1:32:12] choose you
[1:32:14] amen
[1:32:16] for you now to start putting your mind
[1:32:18] on you start looking over all that man
[1:32:21] his wife and and this man and his wife
[1:32:23] and then you stop bringing yourself you
[1:32:25] have to know that the devil also is an
[1:32:27] evangelist
[1:32:29] and if you don't fix your mind right
[1:32:31] he's going to pick up that call and he's
[1:32:33] going to nail you down and say see your
[1:32:36] marriage and see your life and and
[1:32:39] see you it shows that you were this and
[1:32:41] see that other couple back there and if
[1:32:44] he can just get your mind off of christ
[1:32:50] [Music]
[1:32:52] praise the lord
[1:32:56] you know and and
[1:32:58] and and i mean and we all did it you
[1:33:00] know we we we preaching and we never
[1:33:02] even considered that quote that it was
[1:33:04] uh you know it was a spiritual plan we
[1:33:07] just went straight there and start
[1:33:08] hammering all these uh you know that you
[1:33:10] see that the kind of a wife you married
[1:33:13] it tells the character that it's in you
[1:33:14] yes
[1:33:15] you don't have the holy ghost in there
[1:33:25] praise the lord
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:30] it's also not ruling the father it is an
[1:33:32] instruction
[1:33:35] praise the lord
[1:33:36] because our ethnic marriages is a
[1:33:38] reflection
[1:33:40] that's that's the purpose of marriage
[1:33:43] is to reflect the union of christ and
[1:33:45] his bride
[1:33:47] and until we have got there
[1:33:51] are we together
[1:33:55] amen
[1:33:57] now so brother branham says this i'm
[1:34:00] trying to go this way so when i get down
[1:34:03] to to to talk to
[1:34:05] to uh
[1:34:07] my friends will be able to understand
[1:34:09] ourselves better amen
[1:34:17] now
[1:34:18] he sees this up this
[1:34:20] uh we see the a spiritual plan
[1:34:23] of god planning his future home
[1:34:26] with his future bride
[1:34:28] comes into view
[1:34:31] praise the lord
[1:34:34] he goes ahead and he says
[1:34:37] she the bride that a man who choose
[1:34:42] is going to reflect
[1:34:44] his character
[1:34:47] it reflects what in him
[1:34:53] praise the lord
[1:34:55] amen
[1:34:58] and uh
[1:35:01] we can we can look at ourselves through
[1:35:04] this word
[1:35:06] but we also
[1:35:09] have to look at
[1:35:11] the
[1:35:12] the the the plane of redemption
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:18] the plan of redemption
[1:35:20] so if you bring it home to yourself
[1:35:24] and you say the kind of a woman
[1:35:27] that man in heaven
[1:35:30] have choose
[1:35:32] reflect
[1:35:34] his character
[1:35:36] and we know
[1:35:38] that his character has been played out
[1:35:41] true has been playing how true out of
[1:35:43] the scripture
[1:35:46] because god is identified by his
[1:35:48] characteristics
[1:35:54] are we together
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:58] now so in one sense it's easily to bring
[1:36:01] us to the place word when we see the
[1:36:04] kind of for life that we are reflecting
[1:36:10] or the kind of for life that we are
[1:36:12] producing then we ask ourselves what are
[1:36:15] we reflecting
[1:36:16] because the moon do not have a light of
[1:36:18] itself
[1:36:20] is just a reflection of the sun
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] praise the lord
[1:36:29] you see that's the reason why when paul
[1:36:32] when when he taught in the book of
[1:36:34] efficient when he started to teach
[1:36:36] marriage he kept in mind you know
[1:36:40] uh you know the the the head of the man
[1:36:42] is christ uh the man is the head of the
[1:36:45] woman you know he kept those things
[1:36:47] intact he was trying to make the church
[1:36:51] to understand you know that this thing
[1:36:53] is all about reflection
[1:36:58] praise the lord
[1:36:59] so brother brahms says she the bride
[1:37:01] that the man who choose is going to
[1:37:04] reflect his character it reflects what's
[1:37:07] in him she's going to help him
[1:37:11] make
[1:37:12] his future home
[1:37:15] she's going to help him
[1:37:19] do you see help mate
[1:37:22] she's going to help him
[1:37:24] make his future home that's the reason
[1:37:27] why the image of god is never complete
[1:37:30] it has to be male and
[1:37:32] female 1
[1:37:36] praise the lord
[1:37:38] it has to be male and female
[1:37:51] she is going to help him to make
[1:37:54] his future home
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:37:58] verbum goes ahead again he says here
[1:38:02] he's looking for
[1:38:04] her character
[1:38:06] the character of christ
[1:38:08] now just a moment now
[1:38:11] that's it
[1:38:12] he choose a bride to reflect his
[1:38:15] character
[1:38:20] to which the modern church
[1:38:23] of today certainly miss
[1:38:26] his program
[1:38:27] here a million miles
[1:38:31] praise the lord now we we we will go we
[1:38:34] will get back to this i will get back to
[1:38:35] this i'm a little bit ahead ahead of
[1:38:38] myself because uh i'm nervous
[1:38:41] but uh
[1:38:43] we will get to this now let me go back
[1:38:45] again to the to the reading john
[1:38:48] saw a holy city
[1:38:49] coming down out of heaven and as a bride
[1:38:53] and then he was told come and see the
[1:38:55] bride and then he's seen the city now
[1:38:58] jesus said in matthew chapter 5 verse 14
[1:39:03] you are like a candle that cannot be had
[1:39:07] amen is that what he said
[1:39:10] he says you are excited on the hill
[1:39:15] he says you are a city on a hill
[1:39:19] praise the lord
[1:39:21] and now sees the bride here also
[1:39:24] she's taking a representation of the new
[1:39:28] jerusalem come and see the bride the
[1:39:30] lamb's wife he carried me away in the
[1:39:32] spirit to a great and high mountain and
[1:39:36] show me a great city
[1:39:38] come and see the bride and he's showing
[1:39:40] me a great city
[1:39:43] why because
[1:39:44] you are excited on a hill
[1:39:47] and the thing about a city is that
[1:39:50] uh as cited
[1:39:53] is a place of exposure
[1:39:59] a city is a place of exposure
[1:40:03] essere is a place of great influence
[1:40:07] praise the lord
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:10] a city is a place of great influence i'm
[1:40:13] from new york wow look at the yankees
[1:40:16] you know it's a place uh when you call
[1:40:18] the name of a city there's a certain
[1:40:20] image that goes into people's mind
[1:40:26] amen
[1:40:27] praise the lord
[1:40:28] you come from a little town you come to
[1:40:31] the setting you realize that things are
[1:40:33] done differently
[1:40:37] and sometimes people don't grow to catch
[1:40:39] up that life they try to force
[1:40:41] themselves into that life
[1:40:44] and then they get everything out of
[1:40:46] place
[1:40:49] praise the lord
[1:40:50] if you are sitting on a hill
[1:40:53] and and then when it comes to this place
[1:40:56] of the lamb's wife the the bride is is
[1:41:00] out of place word
[1:41:02] one thing there that is that i've always
[1:41:04] believed
[1:41:05] marriage is never a secret thing
[1:41:09] if you are not ready to approach it
[1:41:12] publicly don't go into it
[1:41:19] if you if you are not ready if you want
[1:41:21] to be hiding behind cars hiding behind
[1:41:24] houses don't even attempt it you will
[1:41:26] mess your life up and you will destroy
[1:41:28] the life of somebody else
[1:41:31] it's a city on the hill
[1:41:45] that's the reason why the dating game
[1:41:47] can never work
[1:41:53] because pretty soon you are not exposed
[1:41:56] to be running around with plenty of
[1:41:57] people
[1:41:59] and then you can no longer be trusted
[1:42:03] because what happened it did not work
[1:42:04] here what happened it did not work and
[1:42:06] what happened it did not work here
[1:42:07] everybody see what you are doing
[1:42:15] it's a city on the hill
[1:42:17] i never meant for it to be quiet but if
[1:42:19] it's quiet it's okay
[1:42:33] now you will see the comparison that in
[1:42:36] revelation chapter 17
[1:42:38] you see also a great hold
[1:42:41] that is also on seven hills
[1:42:47] that's right
[1:42:50] praise the lord
[1:42:51] that's the reason why
[1:42:53] her life of hold on cannot be cannot be
[1:42:56] held because yara says she's not in
[1:42:59] contact with all of the kings of the
[1:43:00] earth
[1:43:01] and she's on a hell
[1:43:07] so drinking the blood of the sins all of
[1:43:09] those things are exposed
[1:43:12] right from the beginning
[1:43:17] god's
[1:43:18] approach to marriage has always been a
[1:43:21] public thing
[1:43:28] praise the lord
[1:43:29] it's not a one-man adventure thing
[1:43:34] it has always been a public thing set it
[1:43:37] on a hill keep that in the back of your
[1:43:40] mind
[1:43:45] it's a place of exposure
[1:43:50] praise the lord
[1:43:53] are we together
[1:44:04] now let's take a scripture here over in
[1:44:06] the book of hosea
[1:44:17] praise the lord
[1:44:35] now young people what i want you to do i
[1:44:37] want you to write down all your
[1:44:38] questions
[1:44:41] if i'm creating questions in your mind
[1:44:44] write them down
[1:44:48] on this subject on
[1:44:50] on whatever subject you are thinking
[1:44:51] about
[1:44:53] let's uh let's read hosea chapter 2
[1:44:55] let's read from verse
[1:44:58] 19.
[1:44:59] there's a love story that is playing out
[1:45:01] here in the book of aussie
[1:45:03] and
[1:45:12] for some reason i'm feeling so tested my
[1:45:14] mouth is so dry that my tongue is
[1:45:15] sticking to the roof of my mouth
[1:45:25] praise the lord
[1:45:29] there's a there's there's a there's a
[1:45:30] lot of story that is playing out here
[1:45:32] where god is showing his love to israel
[1:45:36] that even though they have gone away
[1:45:38] from him he's using his prophet to show
[1:45:40] how they have gone into warden
[1:45:43] you know and and and all of that and and
[1:45:46] yet he's his you know his love has he he
[1:45:49] had never lost his love for them and and
[1:45:52] he's he's going to ask his prophet to do
[1:45:54] some
[1:45:55] some things but there is something here
[1:45:57] that uh that also speak to us as as a as
[1:46:01] a gentile people
[1:46:03] let's read from verse 19
[1:46:06] the word of the lord and i will be
[1:46:08] trophy
[1:46:10] unto me forever
[1:46:12] amen
[1:46:14] that word has to do with engagement i
[1:46:16] mean it has to do with uh the betrayal
[1:46:19] that is that is uh you know uh
[1:46:25] and
[1:46:26] i will be trophy unto me in
[1:46:28] righteousness and in judgment and in
[1:46:31] loving kindness and in mercy
[1:46:35] praise the lord
[1:46:36] now one thing you can think from yet is
[1:46:39] that uh
[1:46:40] god is just is he's he's kind of for
[1:46:44] uh expressing you know
[1:46:46] uh uh his inner feelings
[1:46:50] to his people
[1:46:52] amen
[1:46:54] he says uh my my the way i'm going to
[1:46:58] attach myself to you
[1:47:01] is in
[1:47:02] righteousness
[1:47:05] just like we saw in in
[1:47:08] in the life of joseph mary's hussman
[1:47:11] you know
[1:47:13] the bible used that word that he was a
[1:47:15] just man
[1:47:17] which means he never misbehaved himself
[1:47:21] around mary
[1:47:23] he never created any kind of a
[1:47:26] questionable touch
[1:47:29] and and that and i think that character
[1:47:32] that he had please god that god could
[1:47:34] visit him with the same injured i spoke
[1:47:36] to mary
[1:47:41] and that's that's why the
[1:47:43] uh you know that's what
[1:47:45] we we
[1:47:46] we
[1:47:48] we try to encourage
[1:47:50] the foundation that you lay down when
[1:47:52] you're going about you know uh desiring
[1:47:56] or thinking about uh a wife also the
[1:48:00] foundation the way you go about it
[1:48:03] is going to play out
[1:48:06] it's going to play out throughout
[1:48:10] your relationship
[1:48:11] so it's very very important
[1:48:15] praise the lord
[1:48:17] amen
[1:48:21] so god is saying yeah i will be trophy
[1:48:24] unto me in righteousness in judgment
[1:48:27] not the judgment of of condemning or or
[1:48:31] justifying that that word judgment
[1:48:34] also has the sense of uh
[1:48:39] discipline
[1:48:41] it has a sense of discipline now you
[1:48:43] have to know it is god that is telling
[1:48:46] his people how he will approach them
[1:48:50] so he's not saying i'm going to joshua
[1:48:53] i'm going to judge myself
[1:48:55] amen approach to you
[1:49:01] praise the lord
[1:49:02] in loving kindness and in mercy
[1:49:05] i will even be trophy unto me in
[1:49:08] faithfulness
[1:49:11] and thou shall know the lord
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:15] and and and it shall come to pass in
[1:49:18] that day i will hear
[1:49:21] say the lord
[1:49:22] i
[1:49:23] will hear the heavens
[1:49:25] and they shall hear the earth
[1:49:29] and the earth shall hear the cone and
[1:49:33] the wine
[1:49:34] and the oil
[1:49:36] amen
[1:49:37] and they shall hear jezreel
[1:49:41] listen to this now
[1:49:44] and i will saw her
[1:49:48] that's the prophecy now i was so hurt
[1:49:51] unto me in the earth
[1:49:54] i was saw her
[1:49:56] unto me in the earth
[1:50:00] and i will have mercy upon her
[1:50:05] that
[1:50:07] ha not mercy
[1:50:10] and i will say to them which were not my
[1:50:13] people now this is a scripture that is
[1:50:15] always attached to the gentiles
[1:50:21] so god in one sense is saying i will saw
[1:50:25] the bride in the earth that's the reason
[1:50:27] why she would come from every nation
[1:50:32] i was so hot in the earth
[1:50:36] praise the lord
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] so you see this bride that is seen here
[1:50:43] in revelation chapter 21
[1:50:45] is a harvest bride
[1:50:48] that was so in genesis
[1:50:52] in genesis a c chapter
[1:50:55] a seed bride was sold
[1:50:59] amen amen
[1:51:01] so when she come out in the harvest
[1:51:05] you cannot tell the difference between
[1:51:06] the bride and the new city
[1:51:11] i saw a city oh a bride
[1:51:14] come and see the bride oh they said it
[1:51:16] because she has come to such a place of
[1:51:18] harvest
[1:51:23] praise the lord
[1:51:25] when she was sown in genesis
[1:51:28] she went through different types and
[1:51:30] shadow
[1:51:34] praise the lord
[1:51:36] raha was a type of the bride she was a
[1:51:39] gentile woman
[1:51:40] tamar was a type of the bride she was a
[1:51:43] gentile woman
[1:51:45] praise the
[1:51:46] lord amen
[1:51:49] but that was just the bride in seafoam
[1:51:56] god sold his bride in the earth
[1:52:03] praise the lord
[1:52:10] and now we're seeing the bride
[1:52:12] in in in in in a harvest form we're
[1:52:15] seeing the bride
[1:52:16] in in full maturity
[1:52:18] and and in in in in the form of
[1:52:21] manifestation
[1:52:26] that you don't have to get to heaven to
[1:52:28] know what heaven will be just look at
[1:52:30] the bride
[1:52:32] look at her life
[1:52:36] she has come to such a maturity that
[1:52:39] just look at her life
[1:52:42] praise the lord people from different
[1:52:45] backgrounds from different nations they
[1:52:47] can all come together and you see just
[1:52:49] the sweetness and the fellowship among
[1:52:51] them
[1:52:52] no gossip and fusses in all of that
[1:53:01] amen praise the lord
[1:53:08] i saw the city coming out as a bride
[1:53:12] oh this is the bride the lion's wife
[1:53:14] come let me show you her in the city
[1:53:17] wow
[1:53:30] amen
[1:53:33] so the lord says i will saw her unto me
[1:53:35] in the earth
[1:53:37] and i will have mercy
[1:53:40] upon her
[1:53:42] that have not obtained mercy
[1:53:45] and i would say to them which were not
[1:53:48] my people
[1:53:50] they are my people
[1:53:52] and they shall say
[1:53:54] they are
[1:53:56] my god
[1:53:59] praise the lord
[1:54:02] thou are my god
[1:54:06] hallelujah amen so we see here
[1:54:10] that uh
[1:54:11] you know uh that that that there is
[1:54:13] there is there's a there's a seaform
[1:54:17] you know there's a sea form god is
[1:54:19] talking about having his bride but he's
[1:54:21] saying i'm going to saw her
[1:54:24] you know and what is the seed what is
[1:54:26] the seed that we should solve for
[1:54:29] marriage
[1:54:32] it's a word
[1:54:37] is the word
[1:54:43] is that love books and love movies
[1:54:48] if you saw those seeds for marriage
[1:54:50] you're going to reap a mess crop
[1:54:54] a harsh wheat
[1:55:01] the seed that must be sold must be the
[1:55:04] word the principle of the word
[1:55:07] lord i don't even want to think about
[1:55:09] marriage until i know i have the holy
[1:55:11] ghost
[1:55:13] are young people sowing those seeds no
[1:55:28] are we together
[1:55:34] it looks like i took you by surprise but
[1:55:36] it's okay
[1:55:39] i feel more safe when i come that way
[1:55:50] amen but also said this in a message
[1:55:54] who do you say this is
[1:55:56] he said this he says now notice
[1:56:00] the woman here represent
[1:56:02] the future denominational church called
[1:56:05] the bride now he's talking about the
[1:56:07] foolish virgin and and
[1:56:09] and and the great harlot
[1:56:13] the woman here represent the future
[1:56:16] denomination church called the bride
[1:56:21] it's all come up in genesis
[1:56:24] is a seed
[1:56:27] you start in genesis
[1:56:30] you will get your
[1:56:32] picture straight
[1:56:38] amen
[1:56:39] if you start in genesis you will get
[1:56:42] your picture straight why because that's
[1:56:46] where the seed was sown
[1:56:51] praise the lord
[1:56:53] amen
[1:56:55] so here we see that uh uh abraham's
[1:56:58] saying a a a spiritual plan of god
[1:57:02] planning he's planning his future home
[1:57:06] with his future bride
[1:57:10] amen he's planning his future home
[1:57:13] he's thinking about
[1:57:17] a home
[1:57:20] but you see he's not only thinking
[1:57:22] about uh
[1:57:24] just at home he's thinking about his
[1:57:26] bride thinking about his you know uh uh
[1:57:30] uh his future bride
[1:57:32] but there is one thing also that is
[1:57:34] important
[1:57:36] you know
[1:57:37] as you look at the spiritual uh uh
[1:57:40] approach of even almighty god
[1:57:44] god is going to get this bride he's
[1:57:47] going to get this bride
[1:57:50] majoring on
[1:57:52] his own character
[1:57:57] are you are you understanding me the
[1:57:59] kind of a man he want to be
[1:58:03] the way he want to show his attribute
[1:58:06] praise the lord
[1:58:08] so he's not thinking about a bride and
[1:58:12] saying uh
[1:58:14] what kind of a woman she will be i want
[1:58:16] her to be like this i want no he's
[1:58:18] thinking about him producing the
[1:58:20] character of the bride because she's
[1:58:22] going to be a reflection so he's
[1:58:24] primarily working on himself
[1:58:30] he's now writing less of character to
[1:58:33] expect
[1:58:34] but he's working on himself
[1:58:41] are we together
[1:58:44] i mean that's that's why we can trust
[1:58:46] him
[1:58:48] we have not come into uh
[1:58:52] just a membership we have come into a
[1:58:55] relationship
[1:58:58] praise the lord
[1:59:00] everything that almighty god promised
[1:59:04] for his bride for his church he has the
[1:59:07] power to produce it
[1:59:11] that's why we can come and rely on on
[1:59:14] our abilities or on our knowledge of
[1:59:17] what we can do and how much we can
[1:59:19] practice religion but we can trust god
[1:59:21] in his word
[1:59:30] praise the lord
[1:59:34] everything
[1:59:36] that he expects for his his bride to
[1:59:38] have
[1:59:39] five for ministry he have a holy ghost
[1:59:42] that can produce that
[1:59:43] nice spiritual gift he has a holy ghost
[1:59:46] that can produce that
[1:59:49] praise the lord
[1:59:52] so you see there is there is a whole
[1:59:54] thing there for
[1:59:56] a young man to prepare himself
[2:00:00] you have to work on yourself
[2:00:05] amen
[2:00:07] like somebody said he says
[2:00:09] every time you know the young people
[2:00:11] talk about i want a golf hairy man i
[2:00:14] want a golf hearing woman
[2:00:16] and he never says i want to be a golf
[2:00:18] hairy man
[2:00:22] the one they'd never say i want to be a
[2:00:25] god-fearing woman
[2:00:32] praise the lord
[2:00:39] are we together
[2:00:43] you know uh
[2:00:45] uh
[2:00:48] just like the dating game don't work the
[2:00:50] martian game don't work also
[2:00:57] amen
[2:00:59] we don't promise we don't practice
[2:01:01] marshmaking
[2:01:04] amen
[2:01:06] we don't promise uh practice matchmaking
[2:01:09] and as we get as we get down a little
[2:01:12] bit you will there are some things that
[2:01:14] we will appreciate here
[2:01:16] but uh uh i mean we need to
[2:01:19] we need to
[2:01:20] train ourselves and train our children
[2:01:24] praise the lord
[2:01:25] not to pick up the things of the word
[2:01:29] amen
[2:01:31] because there's such an influence there
[2:01:33] when you start hearing out of those
[2:01:34] little tear and talking about
[2:01:37] this person have crushed on me and this
[2:01:39] having crushed on this other person you
[2:01:42] better break that crutches
[2:01:46] it's not funny
[2:01:48] you better break down crutches
[2:01:55] you better break down crutches
[2:01:58] praise the lord
[2:02:04] because if you don't know how to tie
[2:02:05] your shoestring
[2:02:08] you don't need to be talking about those
[2:02:10] things those things must not be the
[2:02:12] language or conversation of little
[2:02:14] children but they pick those things from
[2:02:15] the word they pick it from school
[2:02:18] okay now with all the facebook and and
[2:02:21] youtube they pick those things up
[2:02:35] and sometimes you see parents there
[2:02:37] they're trying to
[2:02:38] you know make those things to faith
[2:02:50] praise the lord
[2:02:53] god i did not call you to be a
[2:02:55] marshmaker
[2:02:59] let's let's go a little bit over to
[2:03:01] proverbs
[2:03:02] 23
[2:03:05] proverbs 23
[2:03:10] praise the lord
[2:03:13] this year is becoming a little bit busy
[2:03:15] for me then i taught
[2:03:18] really than that plan for it to be but
[2:03:21] it looks like
[2:03:22] it's taking me by surprise there are a
[2:03:24] lot of responsibilities that are coming
[2:03:26] more than we thought of so
[2:03:29] we would just continue to trust the lord
[2:03:31] and and uh
[2:03:34] you know do as as as
[2:03:38] as he will
[2:03:40] now there's a beautiful scripture here
[2:03:43] that uh solomon will lay out
[2:03:45] and he will talks here
[2:03:48] uh
[2:03:49] for uh uh
[2:03:51] proverb 23 let's read from verse 15
[2:03:54] my son
[2:03:57] if on high be wise
[2:04:01] my heart shall rejoice
[2:04:03] even mine
[2:04:05] ye my rain shall rejoice when the lips
[2:04:08] speak right things
[2:04:11] praise the lord
[2:04:12] it's always a blessing when a parent
[2:04:15] is sitting somewhere and hear the child
[2:04:17] saying something
[2:04:18] you know that is either saying something
[2:04:21] of the bible or saying something
[2:04:23] scriptural or just saying something that
[2:04:26] is that is decent
[2:04:28] there is just something that rejoices
[2:04:30] the parent's heart
[2:04:32] praise the lord
[2:04:34] let not the heart envy
[2:04:36] sinners
[2:04:38] but be that in the fear of the lord all
[2:04:41] the days long
[2:04:44] for surely there is
[2:04:47] an end
[2:04:48] and an expectation
[2:04:50] shall not be cut off
[2:04:53] praise the lord
[2:04:55] yea thou my son and be wise
[2:04:58] and guide
[2:05:00] that heart in the way
[2:05:02] praise the lord
[2:05:04] now this this very statement that
[2:05:06] solomon is using here in in a proverb
[2:05:10] that he calls
[2:05:11] god my heart in the way
[2:05:13] and in sons of solomon he used that very
[2:05:16] statement when he says don't wake up my
[2:05:19] love i might i might i get through
[2:05:22] everything today but i will find time
[2:05:24] because i really want to lay this thing
[2:05:26] down
[2:05:27] and uh so you can see uh
[2:05:31] uh and know how we intend to approach
[2:05:34] this subject from from here amen
[2:05:38] i know people have a
[2:05:40] uh you know a different
[2:05:42] way of approach and that's that's good
[2:05:44] for them
[2:05:46] now so uh yeah he says my son be wise
[2:05:50] and guide the heart
[2:05:52] you know
[2:05:53] in the way
[2:05:54] you you know
[2:05:56] uh
[2:05:58] being that among wine brothers
[2:06:01] among
[2:06:02] writers eaters of flesh
[2:06:04] for
[2:06:05] the drunkards and the grunters shall
[2:06:08] come to poverty
[2:06:09] and draws in their shell clothed clothed
[2:06:12] a man with rag
[2:06:14] yaking unto thy father that beget thee
[2:06:17] and despise not that mother
[2:06:21] when she is old now the reason why i'm
[2:06:24] bringing this uh this verse is to show
[2:06:27] the the place of parents
[2:06:31] the place of parents
[2:06:34] when it comes to
[2:06:37] guiding your heart
[2:06:41] praise the lord
[2:06:43] amen
[2:06:45] there is a very important place of
[2:06:47] parents
[2:06:50] you can unto your father that beget deed
[2:06:52] and despise not the mother
[2:06:55] when she is old
[2:06:57] by the truth and sell in net
[2:07:01] also wisdom and instruction in
[2:07:03] understanding
[2:07:06] the father of the righteous shall
[2:07:08] greatly rejoice and
[2:07:10] he that be gathered a wise child shall
[2:07:13] have joy in him
[2:07:14] their father
[2:07:16] and their mother shall be glad
[2:07:19] and she that bear thee shall rejoice
[2:07:23] praise the lord
[2:07:25] my son gave
[2:07:27] gave me the heart
[2:07:30] and
[2:07:30] let the eyes observe
[2:07:33] my
[2:07:34] ways
[2:07:35] now this goal in the place of the
[2:07:38] parents and children relationship
[2:07:44] praise the lord
[2:07:45] it goes in the place of the parent and
[2:07:48] the children relationship
[2:07:51] okay now their paul says parents provoke
[2:07:54] not your children
[2:07:58] children obey your parents
[2:08:00] there is a children obey your parents
[2:08:02] and there is a parent provoked not your
[2:08:04] children
[2:08:09] you can just hold to one the bible says
[2:08:11] children obey your parents
[2:08:16] but are you provoking the child
[2:08:20] praise the lord
[2:08:22] amen you could be provoking the child if
[2:08:25] you are not bringing them to
[2:08:26] understanding you are just subjecting
[2:08:29] them to obedience
[2:08:33] if you are not bringing them to
[2:08:35] understanding
[2:08:37] trying to explain why
[2:08:43] but i'm your father so i'm telling you
[2:08:46] you shut up
[2:08:55] oh man
[2:09:15] are we together
[2:09:25] my son gave me the heart
[2:09:27] thine heart and let an eyes observe my
[2:09:31] ways you know brother branham talks
[2:09:32] about that story of the dad that was you
[2:09:35] know coming from the drunken party then
[2:09:38] staggering all over the place and his
[2:09:40] little son jumping in his full step as
[2:09:42] he's going back and forth and he turned
[2:09:44] around and says what are you doing he
[2:09:45] says i'm walking in your footsteps
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:53] praise the lord
[2:09:54] you don't you don't want to guide your
[2:09:56] hearts if they will not walk in your
[2:09:58] ways
[2:10:08] now see the next verse that will follow
[2:10:10] that
[2:10:12] for a world is a deep ditch
[2:10:16] and a strange woman
[2:10:19] is a narrow pain
[2:10:21] right after that verse
[2:10:28] the father is adding asking to god the
[2:10:30] heart of the child
[2:10:33] and saying walk in my ways
[2:10:36] the reason why
[2:10:38] uh uh
[2:10:40] the the place of the parents is very
[2:10:44] important
[2:10:46] praise the lord
[2:10:48] amen
[2:10:50] very very important
[2:10:53] uh
[2:10:54] know how much time i have okay a few
[2:10:57] more minutes
[2:10:59] and uh so
[2:11:00] we will see here i've not i've not even
[2:11:03] uh
[2:11:04] cracked
[2:11:05] a bit of what i want to look into here
[2:11:07] but
[2:11:08] it's i feel like it's going well amen
[2:11:13] i feel like it's going well
[2:11:17] because
[2:11:19] the the the major thing
[2:11:21] we want to look at here is the other
[2:11:24] uh we we got to look at our place
[2:11:28] and just like we said wednesday night he
[2:11:30] has blessed us with all spiritual
[2:11:32] blessing word in heavenly places
[2:11:36] amen
[2:11:37] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[2:11:42] a city on the hill
[2:11:45] a life of exposure
[2:11:48] that everybody might see your good work
[2:11:50] and glorify your father in heaven
[2:11:54] praise the lord
[2:11:59] christian life is a life of exposure
[2:12:03] amen
[2:12:05] it's a life of exposure
[2:12:14] you can light a candle
[2:12:16] and put it under the busher you might
[2:12:18] burn the whole house down
[2:12:23] are we together
[2:12:28] now i have to i have to just run a
[2:12:30] little bit but
[2:12:32] before i go to i have to i have to dwell
[2:12:34] on this a little bit the place of the
[2:12:36] parents
[2:12:37] very important
[2:12:39] very very important like an old
[2:12:41] old preacher says he says a child
[2:12:46] a child must be fully wrapped if a child
[2:12:49] is successfully wrapped in in in their
[2:12:52] parents it will be easy for them to
[2:12:54] fully be giving over to another to be
[2:12:57] fully wrapped in in the hands of a
[2:12:59] stranger
[2:13:02] now so we know that uh it's a place that
[2:13:05] is that is very important
[2:13:08] you know uh
[2:13:09] a place a relationship that
[2:13:12] uh i mean we we we have to bring our
[2:13:15] self-talk we have to that
[2:13:17] parent and children relationship has to
[2:13:20] be there because
[2:13:21] it creates a whole lot of trust
[2:13:26] a whole lot of a trust
[2:13:29] that they can even share their inner
[2:13:32] emotions with you
[2:13:37] praise the lord
[2:13:38] and that's the reason why the apostle
[2:13:40] paul won do not provoke him because what
[2:13:43] provoking does is that a quenches
[2:13:50] it quenches a shut them off
[2:13:55] that they can only tell you what you see
[2:13:57] but what you don't see they cannot tell
[2:13:59] you
[2:14:05] are we together
[2:14:15] okay i will quickly flip up here
[2:14:20] because i know my time is i'm getting
[2:14:22] out of time
[2:14:28] what i'm i'm glad i'm able to go like
[2:14:31] this is it kind of a little bit reduced
[2:14:33] my emotion
[2:14:35] so i'm not uh
[2:14:44] it's it's one of the things where you
[2:14:46] get to
[2:14:47] uh you know uh uh
[2:14:50] studying and you get yourself in caught
[2:14:52] up in the midst of uh
[2:14:54] uh
[2:14:59] a lot of thoughts
[2:15:00] and then you keep let's look at first
[2:15:03] tested learning
[2:15:04] let's look at first test to learning
[2:15:08] i read i preached from this couple of
[2:15:11] months back if you go back and look at
[2:15:13] the archives of simon you realize that
[2:15:15] we spoke on this and what we were
[2:15:17] talking about actually we were talking
[2:15:19] about possessing our vessel
[2:15:23] we're talking about possessing our
[2:15:25] vessel we were bringing it down to the
[2:15:27] place of possessing this vessel amen
[2:15:30] praise the lord
[2:15:32] and but we will look at this in uh in a
[2:15:37] different way we know there are a lot of
[2:15:39] idioms there are a lot of
[2:15:41] uh uh
[2:15:42] uh parables
[2:15:44] that are that are that are hidden in the
[2:15:46] scripture
[2:15:47] praise the lord
[2:15:48] there are a lot of parables that are
[2:15:50] hidden in the scripture
[2:15:59] you know uh the the truth about the
[2:16:01] macho that is the other uh uh you know
[2:16:04] many many of us i would even say myself
[2:16:08] i didn't had a you know uh i never had a
[2:16:12] very good
[2:16:13] bible message teaching you know as i was
[2:16:16] as i was growing up uh in the message
[2:16:20] you know so uh uh but over the years
[2:16:24] they are setting things that grab your
[2:16:26] attention
[2:16:27] and and you and you ask yourself is
[2:16:29] there anything in the world that
[2:16:31] addresses this
[2:16:32] praise the lord
[2:16:34] and and when that comes to your mind
[2:16:35] definitely god is going to show you it
[2:16:38] if you just keep your heart before
[2:16:40] before him and and seek he's going to
[2:16:42] show you it definitely he's going to
[2:16:44] show you that there are things that you
[2:16:47] know that is lying in the world
[2:16:49] praise the lord
[2:16:51] hallelujah
[2:16:54] and so let's let's go
[2:16:58] let's go over to uh
[2:17:01] first tester learning as i said
[2:17:21] well i was talking about idioms
[2:17:24] and
[2:17:27] solomon was one of the person that was
[2:17:30] good in uh
[2:17:32] either using an idiom or using a parable
[2:17:35] but he talks in a way for the wise to be
[2:17:38] able to grab
[2:17:39] one of them that he said year he says
[2:17:43] that would be in proverbs chapter 9
[2:17:46] he says a foolish woman is glamorous
[2:17:49] she is simple
[2:17:50] that word simple
[2:17:52] is not talking about simplicity it's
[2:17:54] talking about being naive
[2:17:58] and knoweth nothing
[2:18:01] for she said it at the door of her house
[2:18:04] on the seat
[2:18:06] in a high place of the city there you go
[2:18:09] again
[2:18:11] she had a place of influence but this
[2:18:13] time is not a good influence
[2:18:17] she said to that place and she called
[2:18:20] all passengers all strangers
[2:18:23] who go right on their way
[2:18:26] praise the lord
[2:18:28] and i will tell you i will tell you that
[2:18:31] facebook has put us to this place
[2:18:35] it has put us to a high place where all
[2:18:38] of these young people you know it's not
[2:18:41] it's not really in the place of
[2:18:42] testimony but yeah i mean they just want
[2:18:44] to just make friends with anybody
[2:18:50] praise the lord amen amen you have to
[2:18:53] guide yourself
[2:18:57] you have to guide yourself
[2:18:59] praise the lord
[2:19:03] as soon as the person stand up with uh
[2:19:05] you know with pillow fire picture
[2:19:08] then they are brothers
[2:19:17] that pillow fire picture not supposed to
[2:19:19] be hanging over them it's supposed to be
[2:19:21] in their heart
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:27] you have to make but you have to make
[2:19:29] sure it's in their heart
[2:19:41] to call passengers who go right on their
[2:19:43] way
[2:19:44] who saw the simple let him turn and in
[2:19:47] hitter
[2:19:49] and ask for him
[2:19:51] that
[2:19:52] want that understanding she said unto
[2:19:55] him
[2:19:55] stolen water the sweet
[2:19:58] and the bread eaten in secret is
[2:20:00] pleasant
[2:20:02] when maori is supposed to be a public
[2:20:04] thing
[2:20:06] she's trying to make it a secret thing
[2:20:12] praise the lord
[2:20:14] but here is the principle that that
[2:20:16] solomon is trying to lay out
[2:20:19] but he knows meant
[2:20:21] that the dead are there
[2:20:24] and that her gates
[2:20:26] are the depths of hell
[2:20:30] in the sense that when you are called to
[2:20:32] those kind of for secret feasts
[2:20:35] then
[2:20:36] you are digging your grave
[2:20:40] you are your grave
[2:20:43] because if it is not okay for you to do
[2:20:46] it in public it's not okay
[2:20:48] for you to do it in secret
[2:20:56] first to learn in chapter four
[2:21:01] now this is a scripture we will try to
[2:21:03] look at
[2:21:04] in a different way that will i will i
[2:21:06] will launch it today and then the next
[2:21:08] time we will get on this
[2:21:10] we will we will go a little bit further
[2:21:16] i will just
[2:21:18] launch it today
[2:21:20] and take
[2:21:22] a few thoughts here from the prophet of
[2:21:24] god
[2:21:25] and then
[2:21:26] we will
[2:21:27] continue
[2:21:30] he says
[2:21:31] that every one of you should know how to
[2:21:34] possess
[2:21:36] his vessel
[2:21:38] in sanctification
[2:21:40] and honor
[2:21:42] every one of you
[2:21:43] should know how to possess his vessel in
[2:21:47] sanctification
[2:21:48] and in honor
[2:21:50] praise the lord
[2:21:51] not in the loss of concretencies
[2:21:55] even as the gentiles wish no not god
[2:22:00] praise the lord
[2:22:02] amen
[2:22:03] every one of you should possess his
[2:22:06] vessel now we're going to look at it in
[2:22:08] a direct sense here uh the first time we
[2:22:11] talk about it we we talk about it in a
[2:22:13] general sense of every one of us
[2:22:15] possessing our vessel possessing this
[2:22:17] body bringing it on a suggestion to the
[2:22:20] word and that's what we should do
[2:22:22] but when we look at it in in the way of
[2:22:25] marriage
[2:22:27] then it becomes the responsibility of
[2:22:30] the man what is saying you should be
[2:22:33] able to
[2:22:34] approach it
[2:22:36] incentification
[2:22:38] and honor
[2:22:39] because marriage is honorable
[2:22:42] now if you look in the scripture you
[2:22:44] will see that
[2:22:45] this word vessel
[2:22:47] has been used
[2:22:49] also for the woman when it comes to the
[2:22:51] new testament
[2:22:53] the scripture says she is a weaker
[2:22:56] vessel
[2:22:57] so that is the trench i'm going that's
[2:23:00] that's where i'm taking this thought
[2:23:02] because you will see brother brandon
[2:23:03] referring to that as well
[2:23:06] so
[2:23:07] if if it says
[2:23:09] his vessel so the man possessing his
[2:23:12] vessel but you must do it
[2:23:17] incentification
[2:23:20] don't do it in lust
[2:23:24] you have to keep it clean
[2:23:27] possess your vessel incentification
[2:23:31] and in honor
[2:23:34] you want to do it as an honorable man
[2:23:36] you want to bring honor to your parents
[2:23:38] you want to honor the girl parents
[2:23:48] are we together
[2:23:52] praise the lord
[2:23:55] hallelujah
[2:23:58] peter will use this year
[2:24:00] here he says and likewise here husband
[2:24:03] word
[2:24:05] he says dwell with them according to
[2:24:07] knowledge
[2:24:08] giving honor unto
[2:24:11] the wife as onto a weaker vessel
[2:24:15] praise the lord
[2:24:18] so with that in mind
[2:24:21] we we we look at this scripture here
[2:24:23] because you see there was one thing that
[2:24:26] was
[2:24:27] a
[2:24:28] the apostle paul had to deal with in the
[2:24:30] gentile church because these people has
[2:24:33] come from
[2:24:35] an unbelieving lives
[2:24:37] praise the lord
[2:24:39] he had a problem in a corinthian church
[2:24:42] with a man living with his mother
[2:24:44] his mother's father wife you know his
[2:24:46] stepmother and all of that coming coming
[2:24:49] down to truth with that form of life
[2:24:52] there must be a place where
[2:24:55] the lord you have to die to your first
[2:24:57] word of life
[2:25:00] in one sense the apostle paul is saying
[2:25:02] you cannot move on with christ
[2:25:05] carrying all these things with you
[2:25:11] praise the lord
[2:25:14] it's not just identifying and saying you
[2:25:17] know i'm i'm a believer i'm a christian
[2:25:19] i don't worship mohammed i don't worship
[2:25:20] idols anymore no no no
[2:25:25] there is one thing that the christian
[2:25:28] faith the bible christian faith brings
[2:25:31] to us is the new birth
[2:25:37] that's the reason why christianity is
[2:25:39] not a religion as people will make it
[2:25:44] because it starts with a birth
[2:25:49] amen
[2:25:50] it starts with a birth
[2:25:57] now so you see the the the uh uh paul is
[2:26:01] is using this approach now he's using
[2:26:04] this approach more more especially
[2:26:06] especially when you look at if you go
[2:26:08] back and study and you look at the
[2:26:11] context of what he's saying here in
[2:26:14] in testimony it having a lot to do with
[2:26:18] marriage
[2:26:20] because as he goes along he says that no
[2:26:23] man go beyond and defraud his brother in
[2:26:26] any matter
[2:26:28] which of course is taking advantage
[2:26:32] of another man because we're in the
[2:26:34] message
[2:26:40] okay because we're in the message while
[2:26:42] we're in the message you should
[2:26:43] understand i'm not a baptist so what
[2:27:00] are we together
[2:27:02] question and answered on genesis brother
[2:27:04] branham says he says yeah no not on
[2:27:06] genesis question and answer lord having
[2:27:08] a shadow
[2:27:10] all the things
[2:27:12] of shadows and time when god made the
[2:27:15] heaven and the earth he made the moon to
[2:27:18] shine
[2:27:19] in the absence of the sun
[2:27:22] to give light
[2:27:23] while the sun is gone
[2:27:26] see a beautiful type of christ and the
[2:27:30] church
[2:27:31] the church
[2:27:32] is the moon to give light
[2:27:36] to the word why
[2:27:38] the sun is gone amen
[2:27:42] see what i mean a lesser light amen and
[2:27:45] then
[2:27:46] otherwise the moon and the sun is
[2:27:49] husband and wife as christ and his
[2:27:52] church is husband and wife the wife
[2:27:55] being the weaker vessel
[2:27:58] only gave a smaller light
[2:28:02] in the absence of her husband
[2:28:05] which of course that light is just a
[2:28:08] reflection
[2:28:12] amen
[2:28:14] that life is just a reflection
[2:28:20] praise the lord
[2:28:23] and the church can only make
[2:28:26] manifestation of the holy ghost remember
[2:28:29] the moon cannot give any light of her
[2:28:31] own
[2:28:34] and when you see the moonlight
[2:28:36] it's only
[2:28:38] the moonlight is a reflection of the
[2:28:41] sunlight
[2:28:43] and
[2:28:44] and christ accented up
[2:28:47] is that right
[2:28:49] and shining his light on the church
[2:28:52] to reflect his light
[2:28:56] and
[2:28:57] power to the word in the in his absence
[2:29:01] praise the lord
[2:29:03] see
[2:29:04] what i mean praise the lord
[2:29:06] amen
[2:29:08] another another taught here jehovah
[2:29:10] jared he says i can imagine
[2:29:13] it was a sunday afternoon when he spoke
[2:29:17] to him maybe
[2:29:19] on monday morning
[2:29:22] how he's going to do poor little isaac
[2:29:27] he look at him talking about abraham
[2:29:30] isaac i know when god told abraham to go
[2:29:33] sacrifice isaac
[2:29:34] oh he loved him but
[2:29:38] i can look at that
[2:29:40] i got to think of obeying
[2:29:45] obeying of god
[2:29:47] so
[2:29:48] he couldn't tell
[2:29:50] sarah
[2:29:51] cause you know
[2:29:54] the ladies are the weaker vessel
[2:29:58] so
[2:29:59] you s so you sometimes you have to watch
[2:30:04] amen
[2:30:06] i can't tell sarah cause she wouldn't
[2:30:08] understand
[2:30:10] sarah never was too strong anyhow in
[2:30:14] fact because she liked she disbelieved
[2:30:17] the promise
[2:30:19] by giving hey god to abraham
[2:30:22] but abraham held her because the man and
[2:30:25] the woman are one
[2:30:28] the woman who met
[2:30:31] be safe in the old testament only by the
[2:30:33] man because it was
[2:30:36] it was second session
[2:30:38] so the marriage covered and brings the
[2:30:39] woman under the covenant of second
[2:30:41] season
[2:30:42] and she had to to be joined to her
[2:30:45] husband in order to receive it
[2:30:48] but in this last day god poured out his
[2:30:51] spirit
[2:30:52] and the women are circumcised in their
[2:30:55] heart just like the man
[2:30:58] praise the lord
[2:30:59] now there is one thing here because
[2:31:01] brother branham goes over using this
[2:31:03] this illustration that abraham couldn't
[2:31:06] tell isaac but you are you also have to
[2:31:08] watch the context when it came to uh
[2:31:13] divine instruction
[2:31:17] don't say brother branham says uh
[2:31:18] abraham couldn't tear aside because she
[2:31:20] was a weaker vessel so i will not tell
[2:31:21] my wife everything
[2:31:24] when it comes to a divine instruction
[2:31:32] praise the lord
[2:31:35] amen
[2:31:36] and i i feel i'm on a divine instruction
[2:31:40] you know i'm i don't i don't tell my
[2:31:42] wife things
[2:31:44] that has to do with people's lives
[2:31:50] i don't do it
[2:31:52] because i'm under a divine instruction
[2:31:57] i try to separate my family life from
[2:32:08] ministry so don't just don't just run in
[2:32:11] there man it's that and start building
[2:32:14] the
[2:32:14] defense
[2:32:17] praise the lord
[2:32:22] you're going to use the savings
[2:32:31] praise the lord
[2:32:35] okay let's move on here
[2:32:45] praise the lord
[2:32:49] amen
[2:32:52] verbum says here he says you women i was
[2:32:54] hollering at you
[2:32:56] he says now i'm going to take up for you
[2:32:58] a little meaning
[2:32:59] see the woman is a weaker vessel
[2:33:02] i know
[2:33:04] there can be a bad man before
[2:33:07] there's been a bad woman
[2:33:09] but man
[2:33:11] who knows that man who knows that you
[2:33:14] are a son of god
[2:33:17] and take advantage of a woman's shame on
[2:33:19] you
[2:33:20] he says no matter what she does
[2:33:23] she is a weaker vessel
[2:33:25] and you know that
[2:33:27] if you don't know that means you're not
[2:33:29] reading your bible
[2:33:31] if she goes out acting on little like
[2:33:35] take her by the hand and talk to her
[2:33:38] like a sister
[2:33:41] you are a son of god
[2:33:44] don't do them evil things
[2:33:47] look at joseph
[2:33:49] he is an example
[2:33:53] now in uh that's why you will see in the
[2:33:55] songs of solomon
[2:33:57] solomon will use this word my sister my
[2:34:00] spouse
[2:34:03] okay he will use this word my sister my
[2:34:06] spouse because she was your sister
[2:34:09] before she became your spouse
[2:34:14] praise the lord
[2:34:18] amen
[2:34:35] should we
[2:34:42] stop praise the lord
[2:34:46] i think it's one of the days i can
[2:34:48] preach for three hours huh
[2:34:52] amen
[2:34:54] praise the lord
[2:34:59] uh-huh
[2:35:07] i would take one more yet and then we'll
[2:35:09] find a place to rock this and then we
[2:35:12] will find another time because there's
[2:35:14] just a whole lot of things i want to go
[2:35:15] into the time will not permit me so i
[2:35:17] don't want to i don't get into something
[2:35:19] else and i don't finish it i don't want
[2:35:21] to i know i i'm i'm very good of keeping
[2:35:23] you in suspense
[2:35:25] but
[2:35:27] i choose i choose not to wear one today
[2:35:31] praise the lord
[2:35:34] [Music]
[2:35:37] but you have to also keep in mind
[2:35:40] you have to keep in mind
[2:35:43] we are under a word
[2:35:45] we are under a word that has been
[2:35:47] prophesied
[2:35:50] just like the bride was so in the earth
[2:35:54] that's how
[2:35:55] the the the
[2:35:57] the voice of god in this age
[2:36:00] has gone out
[2:36:03] and the word is a seed
[2:36:06] praise the lord
[2:36:07] amen
[2:36:09] and and and and they have gone out to
[2:36:12] get a bride you see god saw the promise
[2:36:15] of the bride in the earth
[2:36:17] that it does not have to come by a
[2:36:20] family line
[2:36:22] amen
[2:36:24] you don't have to come by the family
[2:36:25] line it does not have to come by a
[2:36:27] travel line you know
[2:36:29] but it's it's a blessing when uh when
[2:36:32] when we have our loved ones uh you know
[2:36:34] that that receive the word and you know
[2:36:36] and receive the lord and walking in
[2:36:39] truth it's a blessing
[2:36:43] praise the lord
[2:36:45] but you see this a soul is so soul in
[2:36:47] the earth word that i mean that the
[2:36:50] bride is is popping up from everywhere
[2:36:57] god it says uh it's it's you know what
[2:37:00] it's it's reaching out and bringing the
[2:37:02] people bringing the people out of
[2:37:05] tradition
[2:37:09] you have to remember we have to remember
[2:37:12] the purpose
[2:37:14] is to be a reflection
[2:37:16] a man can see your good works and
[2:37:19] glorify your father
[2:37:21] that is in heaven
[2:37:23] the bride has to be a reflection
[2:37:27] that's the purpose of this message
[2:37:34] she is at a place of influence
[2:37:39] the bride is at a place of influence
[2:37:43] praise the lord
[2:37:45] verbally preached the message of
[2:37:47] influence and he always takes it from
[2:37:50] the place where uh uh uh the the angels
[2:37:54] came in the temple with isaiah
[2:37:58] as i have been under the influence of
[2:38:00] yuzia but when yuzia died
[2:38:03] praise the lord
[2:38:05] god changed
[2:38:09] the effect of influence on isaiah and
[2:38:12] it's amazing when you look into the
[2:38:14] scripture
[2:38:16] read the first
[2:38:17] read the first uh uh uh
[2:38:20] five chapter of isaiah you will see that
[2:38:23] his prophecy was just about the center
[2:38:26] of jerusalem he was just dwelling with
[2:38:28] his people but after he came under the
[2:38:31] influence of those angels he broke into
[2:38:33] vision chapter 7 and saying the virgin
[2:38:36] shall conceive
[2:38:40] so the the the angels influenced him
[2:38:44] until his ministry was lifted from the
[2:38:46] earth
[2:38:48] and isaiah could prophesize about a
[2:38:50] millennium and he could prophesy even
[2:38:52] about the days that we are living in
[2:38:54] seven women would take a hold of one man
[2:38:57] the acceptable year isaiah he was lifted
[2:39:00] or because he have now come on the
[2:39:02] angelic influence that angel took a
[2:39:06] court of fire from the throne of god and
[2:39:08] put it on his lips
[2:39:12] praise the lord
[2:39:16] amen
[2:39:18] and now
[2:39:19] we in our day
[2:39:23] seven angels
[2:39:29] this bride is under the influence of
[2:39:31] seven angels
[2:39:33] praise the lord how will people produce
[2:39:36] rapture in faith and get to a talking
[2:39:38] life
[2:39:41] if you start having problems with the
[2:39:43] seven angels
[2:39:47] how are you going to produce you just
[2:39:49] stuck in a denominational life
[2:39:53] you would just hold one coat and make a
[2:39:55] doctrine around it
[2:40:02] the reason of those seven angels was to
[2:40:04] bring us higher
[2:40:08] was to was to influence this bride to
[2:40:10] start looking at the new jerusalem
[2:40:13] because she's a reflection of that city
[2:40:17] to inspire this bride
[2:40:19] to be a representation of jesus christ
[2:40:24] praise the lord
[2:40:28] amen
[2:40:29] just like that policeman in the welsh
[2:40:31] revival says you're looking for the
[2:40:33] worst survivor is right here
[2:40:36] this bride must be able to say i'm the
[2:40:37] new jerusalem
[2:40:40] not only with a confession but with a
[2:40:42] life to back it up
[2:40:48] that was the purpose of those seven
[2:40:50] angels
[2:40:51] to lift us up
[2:40:54] praise the lord
[2:40:55] god knew the kind of a depressing spirit
[2:40:58] that would come in this age
[2:41:00] amen
[2:41:05] never in a time that never in a time of
[2:41:08] of of any revival
[2:41:10] people have had a uh uh
[2:41:13] uh uh
[2:41:14] close to death experience people have
[2:41:16] had other experience but what are the
[2:41:19] purpose
[2:41:20] the purpose of the vessel beyond the
[2:41:22] curtains of time
[2:41:25] was to tell there's a land beyond the
[2:41:26] river
[2:41:29] and the mystery that it holds is that
[2:41:31] there is no dull moment in the life of a
[2:41:34] believer that's the mystery it holds
[2:41:37] that when we die we jump in another body
[2:41:41] and we can be looking our our dead body
[2:41:43] down people crying knocking yourself on
[2:41:45] the ground you are in a brand new body
[2:41:47] there is no dumb woman
[2:41:49] that's the mystery that it holds
[2:41:52] because you have to remember brother
[2:41:53] branham was he said i've always been
[2:41:55] afraid to be a spirit i never wanted to
[2:41:58] be a floating spirit so god decided to
[2:42:01] give birth an experience
[2:42:04] because paul says something in the book
[2:42:06] of in the book of timothy
[2:42:08] he says immortality
[2:42:10] has always been there
[2:42:14] that's what the baptism of the holy
[2:42:15] ghost brings to the believers
[2:42:17] it brings the experience of immortality
[2:42:21] you have immortality in this body
[2:42:27] that's the reason why you can die this
[2:42:29] body drop down you drop you drop in
[2:42:30] another one
[2:42:36] amen
[2:42:37] that fear of death that has haunted the
[2:42:39] church
[2:42:42] it's no more
[2:42:45] praise the lord
[2:42:46] so why do i care live or die i praise
[2:42:48] the lord
[2:42:49] [Music]
[2:42:51] amen
[2:42:55] that is the effect the influence
[2:42:59] that the opening of the seals brought to
[2:43:01] us
[2:43:04] glory be to god
[2:43:06] oh my god hallelujah
[2:43:13] what a people
[2:43:17] not just saying
[2:43:19] that
[2:43:20] well i'm in the message
[2:43:22] amen
[2:43:24] there is something that god
[2:43:27] is doing with this bride
[2:43:30] amen brother branham says the talking
[2:43:33] was the
[2:43:34] highlight of his ministry
[2:43:38] amen
[2:43:40] he said it was the highlight of his
[2:43:42] ministry
[2:43:45] you know why
[2:43:47] because the opening of the seals
[2:43:51] once again
[2:43:53] the revealing of those mystery
[2:43:57] once again
[2:44:02] the human soul
[2:44:04] the human soul
[2:44:07] will experience
[2:44:08] the literal life of god
[2:44:15] it's not just a feeling
[2:44:18] amen
[2:44:19] not just not just a feeling or a
[2:44:22] sensation
[2:44:24] or a belief
[2:44:27] he want to bring us to the place where
[2:44:29] in our soul
[2:44:37] because that's that's the thing that was
[2:44:39] taken there in eden
[2:44:44] life was there
[2:44:47] but that life of god
[2:44:53] the life of god once more to struck the
[2:44:56] human soul
[2:45:02] how many times did the injured of the
[2:45:04] law to the prophet if you would be
[2:45:06] sincere
[2:45:09] is a message of sincerity
[2:45:16] a message of sincerity pure pure the
[2:45:18] cleanness of life
[2:45:26] amen
[2:45:29] not just making excuse when i mean
[2:45:31] whenever i mean if if we are wrong we
[2:45:33] know that we're born in this in this
[2:45:35] body
[2:45:36] you know if god don't help us we'll die
[2:45:38] defeated
[2:45:46] why hold to the old nature and struggle
[2:45:48] with
[2:45:49] uh uh uh you know all habits and and and
[2:45:52] personality when there is a heaven fall
[2:45:55] waiting for you to experience a brand
[2:45:57] new experience in your life
[2:45:59] overcoming power
[2:46:03] praise the lord amen
[2:46:06] that is there for you to overcome lost
[2:46:08] and overcome evil thoughts and and
[2:46:11] overcome filthy desires and overcome
[2:46:13] whatever you you want to think about
[2:46:16] it's there
[2:46:17] it's there is it's at your disposal
[2:46:22] praise the lord
[2:46:24] if you take it as your own and confess
[2:46:26] it god will make your body to obey your
[2:46:29] confession
[2:46:32] praise the lord
[2:46:34] you know that's i mean just like paul
[2:46:36] said in in corinthians he says he says
[2:46:39] he says converts gift
[2:46:42] it's not a wrong thing for you to
[2:46:44] convert gift if you say lord i want to
[2:46:46] see vision it's not a wrong thing
[2:46:49] praise the lord
[2:46:50] amen lord i want to i want to see vision
[2:46:53] it's not a wrong thing
[2:46:56] all you have to do just clean your life
[2:46:58] for vision
[2:47:00] just live a life of expectation lord i
[2:47:03] want to see vision then start living a
[2:47:05] clean life
[2:47:06] law i want to experience healing in my
[2:47:09] body
[2:47:10] [Music]
[2:47:12] then start living a life of confession
[2:47:14] positive thoughts
[2:47:15] you got to fight against the demon of
[2:47:17] fear
[2:47:18] and doubt
[2:47:20] it's not wrong to desire those things
[2:47:26] praise the lord
[2:47:28] the reason is because there are things
[2:47:30] that we don't want to give up
[2:47:33] amen
[2:47:34] we want to hold one thing in our hands
[2:47:36] and think that we can enjoy the joy of
[2:47:38] the lord no
[2:47:40] the devil will always use that thing
[2:47:42] that you are holding to condemn you
[2:47:52] you always use that thing to condemn you
[2:48:01] say lord i want to i want to i want i
[2:48:02] want to experience this thing to talk
[2:48:04] about praying in the spirit i want to
[2:48:05] pray until i get lost
[2:48:08] stop by five minutes
[2:48:09] every day give five minutes
[2:48:11] the next day maybe the law may carry you
[2:48:13] to 10 minutes and 15 minutes before you

[2:48:59] went to make research i don't know if i
[2:49:01] put in my notes i think in the next one
[2:49:04] [Music]
[2:49:08] one of the greatest redemption story in
[2:49:12] the bible that talks about the god
[2:49:15] the story of ruth
[2:49:18] amen
[2:49:21] and boaz
[2:49:23] praise the lord
[2:49:24] beautiful story
[2:49:27] beautiful story
[2:49:30] do you realize
[2:49:32] just last night last night just before i
[2:49:34] went to bed i was thinking about that
[2:49:36] again it came back to my mind and i said
[2:49:38] let me just let me just make a search on
[2:49:40] it
[2:49:40] you know really just make a search on it
[2:49:42] you can even you can even search it out
[2:49:44] on google google will tell you
[2:49:46] it will bring a reference from uh from
[2:49:49] the hebrew uh uh tamar who tells you
[2:49:52] that
[2:49:54] boas was 80 years old
[2:49:57] when he married ruth
[2:50:09] praise the lord
[2:50:12] and there is no wrecker
[2:50:14] that boaz ever did got married
[2:50:17] before
[2:50:18] ruth
[2:50:25] praise the lord
[2:50:27] and ruth
[2:50:30] she was
[2:50:32] uh
[2:50:33] i think she was in her 40s
[2:50:36] when she gave birth
[2:50:42] amen
[2:50:44] when she gave birth to obed and the
[2:50:46] bible says the women of the city said
[2:50:48] you have a son that is more than seven
[2:50:50] sons
[2:50:52] but there is something that is beautiful
[2:50:54] in the scripture
[2:51:01] there is something that is beautiful in
[2:51:03] the scripture
[2:51:06] right after
[2:51:07] boaz played the role of a king's man
[2:51:12] amen
[2:51:15] and he kicked off his shoes and we know
[2:51:17] everything about that and all of that
[2:51:20] you realize
[2:51:22] the bible
[2:51:24] did not make mention of him
[2:51:30] praise the lord amen
[2:51:33] because
[2:51:35] just for that
[2:51:38] story of redemption
[2:51:40] god kept his life
[2:51:46] when he restored all of the things that
[2:51:48] naomi
[2:51:50] lost
[2:51:51] and got married to ruth
[2:51:53] she had a child
[2:51:55] he went to be with the lord
[2:52:06] praise the lord
[2:52:09] you see so
[2:52:11] you don't have to
[2:52:14] misbehave and publicize yourself and do
[2:52:17] things
[2:52:18] just because you you think that i'm
[2:52:20] getting old and you know i got no
[2:52:24] you got to trust in this world
[2:52:28] you got to believe in the god
[2:52:31] of heaven and earth that ordained your
[2:52:33] life
[2:52:36] you think about it
[2:52:38] think about it
[2:52:46] it's not that boris was a struggling man
[2:52:49] he was a prince
[2:52:52] he had what it takes
[2:52:54] he was a kind of a man where every woman
[2:52:56] wanted
[2:52:59] but he knew there was a purpose on his
[2:53:01] life
[2:53:15] praise the lord
[2:53:19] and see
[2:53:21] ruth
[2:53:23] your god will be my god
[2:53:26] your people will be my people where you
[2:53:28] go i will go where you die with that
[2:53:30] when rue was making that statement she
[2:53:32] had not heard about boaz
[2:53:36] she was not thinking that baboa she was
[2:53:38] not thinking that she would be a type of
[2:53:40] the bride of christ
[2:53:43] but god
[2:53:46] placed that burden on her
[2:53:48] that even when her sister went back
[2:53:51] she looked back
[2:53:53] even as she was attempting to go but
[2:53:55] because god hired for the purpose to
[2:53:58] play out the greatest redemption story
[2:54:03] [Music]
[2:54:05] naomi said go go go
[2:54:07] praise the lord i believe she went she
[2:54:10] told her mother and father i'm going
[2:54:12] with naomi
[2:54:13] what are you going to do stay here
[2:54:17] praise the lord
[2:54:23] but to understand
[2:54:26] understand
[2:54:30] the mystery of redemption
[2:54:35] talking about our case man
[2:54:38] there is no place in the bible
[2:54:41] that played that out
[2:54:48] praise the lord
[2:54:54] and ruth and boss
[2:54:57] praise the lord
[2:54:59] amen
[2:55:01] and god knew that
[2:55:05] child bearing was something that would
[2:55:06] plain heart in the abrahamic coveting
[2:55:12] so even being more than 40 years close
[2:55:14] to 50 years
[2:55:16] the law still made her own filter
[2:55:19] because he wanted to place her in the
[2:55:21] promise of abraham
[2:55:27] the lord bless you less by our hearts
[2:56:01] oh how i pray that god
[2:56:04] will wave upon the hearts of the young
[2:56:06] people i know young people struggle
[2:56:09] with things
[2:56:10] they have a lot of things in their mind
[2:56:13] plants and purples and all of that
[2:56:17] how god will just
[2:56:21] give us a pentecost give us a baptism

[2:56:50] experience

[2:56:53] things you will keep fighting you will
[2:56:55] keep struggling the devil will want to
[2:56:57] blast your mind with lustful desires and
