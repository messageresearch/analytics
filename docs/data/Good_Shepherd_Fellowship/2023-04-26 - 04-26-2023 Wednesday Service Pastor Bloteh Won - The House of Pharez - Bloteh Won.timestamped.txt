[58:02] word in Jesus name we pray amen amen the
[58:07] Lord bless you you may have your seat

[58:17] have bread enough and to spare and I
[58:22] perish with hunger praise the Lord
[58:26] how many
[58:28] higher seven my father have and he have
[58:32] enough bread and more to spare and yeah
[58:36] I perish with
[58:39] hunger now let's go to verse 31.
[58:43] praise the Lord
[58:51] this is the older son the father is
[58:53] speaking to and he said unto him son
[58:56] they are ever with me
[59:00] praise the Lord and all that I have is
[59:04] dying
[59:05] praise the Lord
[59:06] so uh what what we what we try to bring
[59:09] out of this year is the other uh
[59:15] we're trying to look at
[59:22] uh
[59:24] identity crisis
[59:26] amen
[59:28] the younger one came to himself the
[59:31] older one
[59:32] came to know that all the father have
[59:36] was his
[59:38] praise the Lord if you go back in the
[59:40] reading you will see here that uh
[59:45] the older one said
[59:48] uh
[59:55] he got angry
[59:57] and he answered and said
[1:00:13] verse 29 and he and and he answered and
[1:00:17] said to his father Lo these many years
[1:00:20] do I serve thee
[1:00:23] praise the Lord so he was he was uh
[1:00:27] pointing to how faithful he was serving
[1:00:30] serving the father
[1:00:33] and yet he was also acknowledging that
[1:00:36] uh I've been serving you I've been a
[1:00:40] good boy I've been a good girl in church
[1:00:43] and yet uh you have not made a party for
[1:00:46] me
[1:00:47] and uh and here is this other one that
[1:00:50] has screwed up his life that you are
[1:00:53] making the party for so we we want to
[1:00:56] look at that uh uh tonight
[1:01:00] so the other one came to know that all
[1:01:03] the father have uh was his
[1:01:07] it is not how high we work
[1:01:12] praise the Lord
[1:01:14] it is not haha we work
[1:01:18] but what the father is looking for is
[1:01:21] the character
[1:01:22] of the word
[1:01:24] praise the Lord
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:27] for this boy to be working very hard to
[1:01:30] please the father and yet have not come
[1:01:32] to that character of understanding
[1:01:35] that all of this belong to me
[1:01:38] that there was an era of concern also
[1:01:42] praise the Lord
[1:01:43] and then for the younger one to think
[1:01:46] that he had things under control and
[1:01:49] here he went and wasted the substance of
[1:01:52] the father now but in in lokia Luke
[1:01:56] chapter 15 there were three things that
[1:01:58] we look at Jesus talked about the lost
[1:02:00] sheep uh the Lost Queen and uh uh uh the
[1:02:06] the Lost inheritance if we would say
[1:02:08] that way he kind of for misplaced the
[1:02:11] inheritance it's beautiful because you
[1:02:14] know brother Branham saying when Adam
[1:02:16] lost his inheritance you know he says it
[1:02:20] went back in the hands of the original
[1:02:22] owner
[1:02:23] praise the Lord and when the when the
[1:02:26] Prodigal Son wasted and lost everything
[1:02:29] he acknowledged
[1:02:31] that
[1:02:33] what a half man
[1:02:35] you know my father have better than the
[1:02:38] state I'm in so it went back he looked
[1:02:40] back to the hands of the original owner
[1:02:42] which is the father
[1:02:45] but we were we were looking at this and
[1:02:48] there are a few uh coats of broadband I
[1:02:51] want to read I want to kind of uh back
[1:02:53] my thoughts up here with Coach because I
[1:02:55] couldn't do that uh last Wednesday so we
[1:02:58] were looking at this and we were just
[1:03:00] trying to look at uh out of the the the
[1:03:04] three Parables there that relate to uh
[1:03:08] uh our I was our stages of Grace and
[1:03:11] stages in the way the father deal with
[1:03:14] us we all uh were like sheep going
[1:03:17] straight amen we were all like sheep
[1:03:20] going astray so we find ourselves right
[1:03:23] in the parable of the lost sheep the
[1:03:26] father took a time he talked he took a
[1:03:31] special time
[1:03:32] praise the Lord that day that you were
[1:03:35] saying the day you came to the knowledge
[1:03:37] of of Christ of experiencing God's
[1:03:41] salvation Grace the father took a
[1:03:44] special time
[1:03:46] that service was only for you that
[1:03:49] moment was only for you the father you
[1:03:52] he will always take a special time every
[1:03:55] time that God will redeem his children
[1:03:58] like brother Branham said when he came
[1:04:00] down in the Garden of Eden he never sent
[1:04:02] an angel
[1:04:03] he came down himself
[1:04:06] he was the one that said Adam Adam where
[1:04:10] are you he never sent Michael he never
[1:04:13] said Gabriel he came down himself praise
[1:04:16] the Lord amen
[1:04:19] and I I have this uh uh uh personal
[1:04:23] thought in my mind that every martyr
[1:04:26] that is on Earth is giving one or more
[1:04:30] opportunity to experience God
[1:04:34] praise the Lord amen whether you know
[1:04:37] God or not
[1:04:39] there will be some kind of for even
[1:04:42] in our life word he comes very close
[1:04:48] praise the Lord
[1:04:50] and if we are conscious it's not by luck
[1:04:53] it was the hand the tender hand of
[1:04:56] Jehovah
[1:04:58] that brought you out of that situation
[1:05:01] it was the creator coming so close
[1:05:04] to his creature
[1:05:06] and delivering you
[1:05:08] praise the Lord so then we say we talk
[1:05:11] about the Lost Queen you will see a year
[1:05:13] that we will read out of uh the second
[1:05:15] coming of the Lord that's the message
[1:05:17] brother brand preach brother Brandon
[1:05:20] identified that as virtue
[1:05:24] he identified that that uh the the the
[1:05:28] the this woman lost a vet you so you see
[1:05:32] Jesus Took the thought in a kind of a
[1:05:35] progressive way he's talking to both for
[1:05:38] the publicans and and the Sinners and
[1:05:40] then he had this religious group here
[1:05:43] the stripes and the Pharisees
[1:05:45] and he stopped talking about which one
[1:05:48] of you that your sheep would get lost
[1:05:50] and you will not go after them
[1:05:53] praise the Lord and let me tell you
[1:05:55] today that that is the same thing that
[1:05:57] happened when one Soul comes to the
[1:06:00] kingdom of God Heaven Rejoice amen
[1:06:04] praise the Lord
[1:06:05] and then he goes after again and talk
[1:06:07] about a certain woman that lost a queen
[1:06:10] and Brother Band will make us to
[1:06:12] understand that uh it was uh it was a
[1:06:15] virtue so you see that uh uh he's he's
[1:06:19] bringing this teaching this is this is
[1:06:22] the way our Lord taught he uh he talked
[1:06:24] about Parables he bringing this teaching
[1:06:27] uh uh uh right from when a sinner is
[1:06:32] safe when the father has gone after you
[1:06:35] and then and then uh brought you to the
[1:06:39] saving knowledge it is not only for you
[1:06:41] to become a church member praise the
[1:06:44] Lord because by grace and by
[1:06:46] predestination the assertive virtue in
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:06:53] Hallelujah
[1:06:55] yeah accepting virtues in you that's why
[1:06:57] brother Brandon taught in uh a statue of
[1:07:00] a perfect man he says you just need the
[1:07:03] right environment but it's already in
[1:07:06] you
[1:07:07] praise the Lord
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:11] so when Peter said ah to your faith you
[1:07:14] don't go and get Faith from spoken word
[1:07:17] Tabernacle and then you get veggie from
[1:07:20] Capstone Tabernacle no you don't you
[1:07:22] don't go shopping for it amen right
[1:07:28] glory be to God
[1:07:30] so we we want to look at Jesus taught
[1:07:33] here in a Progressive Way
[1:07:35] teaching about uh uh uh the way that he
[1:07:40] deals with us
[1:07:41] after saving us and and picking us up
[1:07:45] putting us on his shoulder and redeeming
[1:07:48] us to himself
[1:07:49] he he uh speak now about this woman now
[1:07:53] brother brand will take this let's
[1:07:54] follow that a little bit here and the
[1:07:57] second coming of the Lord he said man a
[1:08:00] certain value of that woman
[1:08:04] praise the Lord
[1:08:05] if you want to look look it up look in
[1:08:09] Galatians 5 you will find out that they
[1:08:13] are warmer represented the church and
[1:08:16] the church is an espouse wife to Christ
[1:08:20] and the tablet that the church is
[1:08:23] supposed to wear is found in Gallatin
[1:08:26] five you're talking about the fruit of
[1:08:28] the spirit which is love joy peace
[1:08:31] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:08:33] gentleness patience that is the tablet
[1:08:37] that's supposed to be worn in the church
[1:08:39] Brotherly Love kindness Fellowship so
[1:08:43] brother Brown goes out there to complete
[1:08:46] it to make sure that it's all ten he
[1:08:48] says it must have been long about that
[1:08:52] now if you read the parable Jesus said
[1:08:56] that the woman after she lost she light
[1:09:00] a candle now Candlestick always
[1:09:02] represents the church ages
[1:09:06] praise the Lord it always represents the
[1:09:09] church ages but brother Branham will
[1:09:11] represent a year as nighttime
[1:09:14] he says it must have been long about
[1:09:18] that that she realized that she had lost
[1:09:22] one of those coins oh if this ever was a
[1:09:27] time that the church ought to take
[1:09:29] inventory to find out if you have got
[1:09:33] all the coins on
[1:09:36] it should be now praise the Lord amen
[1:09:40] can we say that together it should be
[1:09:43] now praise the Lord if there is ever the
[1:09:47] time that the church
[1:09:49] must take inventory to make sure we have
[1:09:52] all of those vets you brother Branham
[1:09:54] say it should be now it's getting dark
[1:09:58] praise the Lord
[1:10:00] is getting there again the very hot and
[1:10:03] clouds of destroying civilization is
[1:10:06] hanging over the Earth
[1:10:09] we see all of the things that are
[1:10:11] happening
[1:10:12] you know I was I was uh uh uh
[1:10:17] listening to this message today and then
[1:10:20] I was just I was just thinking about it
[1:10:22] you know I was thinking about it and
[1:10:24] there was some there were some very
[1:10:26] prophetic thing that brother Brandon
[1:10:27] said it just it just kind of for uh bad
[1:10:30] for my mind you check that message
[1:10:31] better Brandon was talking about how how
[1:10:35] uh uh
[1:10:38] the American politician he says that uh
[1:10:41] uh the the uh they are trading the
[1:10:45] blessing he says whoever bless Israel is
[1:10:48] blessed he said but see our country we
[1:10:50] are betraying their promise and now we
[1:10:52] are making friends with the Arabs
[1:10:55] I'm thinking about I says this is this
[1:10:58] is hundreds of years back
[1:11:00] now actually hundreds of years but a
[1:11:02] couple of years back and here is brought
[1:11:04] Branham saying that how you know uh uh
[1:11:08] uh uh a country that was founded on
[1:11:11] structural principle to know that
[1:11:14] keeping the friendship with Israel is
[1:11:16] blessing they are now turning against
[1:11:19] that and now making friends with the
[1:11:21] Arabs I was saying myself I said oh my
[1:11:24] God what is this he's talking about
[1:11:27] and it's happening right before our eyes
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] amen praise the Lord
[1:11:32] they will come against you for standing
[1:11:35] for Christian value but yeah they would
[1:11:37] give the other ones the the rest chance
[1:11:40] to go and prayed
[1:11:42] and respect their holidays
[1:11:44] yes amen praise the Lord
[1:11:51] so we see all of these things uh uh a
[1:11:54] cloud of this destroying civilization
[1:11:57] hanging over the Earth the prophet of
[1:11:59] God says
[1:12:01] praise the Lord
[1:12:03] those values and courtesies
[1:12:06] are all gone
[1:12:10] what a day that we are living we are
[1:12:13] living in a tremendous time when there
[1:12:17] is wickedness
[1:12:19] people who goes to church
[1:12:22] people who goes to church just for
[1:12:26] Hashem
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:29] praise the Lord
[1:12:32] he says people who goes to church just
[1:12:35] to try to hide
[1:12:37] from their meanings
[1:12:40] right
[1:12:41] so wish me the people are not getting to
[1:12:44] Christ
[1:12:45] the people are not getting to the
[1:12:47] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:51] the church is just a place of comfort is
[1:12:55] it looks like it's a shelter
[1:12:58] well we just go and ease our mind a
[1:13:00] little bit
[1:13:02] praise the Lord when actually we must be
[1:13:06] we must be the uh uh uh reaching out to
[1:13:10] Christ we must be getting the hold of
[1:13:12] God
[1:13:14] praise the Lord
[1:13:18] amen and it's not just only the
[1:13:19] denomination Church
[1:13:22] message churches are becoming just a
[1:13:25] place of form
[1:13:26] as long as we can sing their songs from
[1:13:29] the songbook
[1:13:32] we can quote a a quote and said brother
[1:13:34] Branham said
[1:13:36] praise the Lord sure amen
[1:13:39] some message people become too nervous
[1:13:44] when you stand when you start getting
[1:13:46] into the word if you are not quoting
[1:13:48] their familiar quotes they get two
[1:13:50] Neighbors
[1:13:53] praise the lord we just want to hear the
[1:13:55] same thing all the time
[1:13:59] we don't want to go any further in the
[1:14:01] word
[1:14:03] we don't want these things to be real to
[1:14:05] us
[1:14:08] but we have Jesus on our hand
[1:14:14] praise the Lord
[1:14:16] the prophet of God says what a
[1:14:17] tremendous time
[1:14:20] when there is wickedness
[1:14:24] people will go to church now he's he's
[1:14:26] associating a certain form of wickedness
[1:14:30] you will be doing yourself too much evil
[1:14:34] to come to church
[1:14:36] and don't really get in the word
[1:14:42] that's wickedness
[1:14:44] you've been to you've been harmful to
[1:14:46] yourself
[1:14:48] praise the Lord to know that you will be
[1:14:51] dealing with things in your life
[1:14:53] ugly things
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:56] and then you come to church and just sit
[1:14:58] there comfortably
[1:15:01] when you're supposed to be hauling to
[1:15:02] the halls of the Altar and crying to God
[1:15:08] praise the Lord
[1:15:14] people will go to church
[1:15:16] just a shaming people who go to church
[1:15:18] to hide from the armeness people who go
[1:15:22] to church and profess Christianity and
[1:15:25] live like the rest of the word drinking
[1:15:27] smoking gambling wearing immoral clothes
[1:15:30] wearing clothes that they ought
[1:15:33] all into word
[1:15:35] in their own dressing room
[1:15:37] out in the street before public and
[1:15:40] Brotherly Love is a thing that is
[1:15:44] passing almost
[1:15:47] praise the Lord
[1:15:49] it is just on our lid God bless you
[1:15:51] brother brother
[1:15:54] have a feeling
[1:15:56] we're beginning to lost the brother
[1:15:58] Brandon go ahead here he says the church
[1:16:07] of God
[1:16:09] her purity
[1:16:13] called devotion
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:17] examining ourselves by the word our
[1:16:20] puritate our loyalty our devotion to
[1:16:24] Christ
[1:16:25] for the word
[1:16:27] brother we the Church of the Living God
[1:16:30] in this great hour that we are now
[1:16:33] living a behold us
[1:16:37] to check up go before God
[1:16:40] like the candle of the word of the
[1:16:43] gospel and examine ourself and find out
[1:16:47] if we are not falling shot and
[1:16:51] especially when we see all these things
[1:16:53] coming
[1:16:55] we are the end time the coming of Christ
[1:16:58] is a hand
[1:17:00] there is not another hope in the word
[1:17:03] for the church
[1:17:06] that's the reason why we say is the
[1:17:08] rapture is our future right
[1:17:12] praise the Lord
[1:17:14] the Rapture is our future
[1:17:17] now so we see here that uh brother
[1:17:20] Branham is is what he what is he doing
[1:17:22] by talking about all of these things
[1:17:24] he's identifying that lost queen to a
[1:17:27] vet you that uh uh the church has lost
[1:17:33] if that's you brother random talk in uh
[1:17:36] uh uh invisible union he says uh just
[1:17:40] like the woman the church is giving
[1:17:42] three sacrificial
[1:17:45] Devotion to the word to to to to prayer
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:54] and her Devotion to Christ
[1:17:59] are we together
[1:18:03] now so we see here then he says he he
[1:18:07] says this also uh in their same message
[1:18:11] he says when that time comes when the
[1:18:15] church fine is brotherly love
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:24] when the church found its wholly decency
[1:18:29] praise the Lord
[1:18:31] when the church Finds Its place in
[1:18:34] Christ now three things he pull out to
[1:18:37] you and in my mind I'm sitting there
[1:18:39] there I says you can take those three
[1:18:41] things and put them right in sin Luke
[1:18:43] chapter 15.
[1:18:47] praise the Lord
[1:18:49] the three Parables that Jesus
[1:18:52] gives in sin Luke chapter 15 you can
[1:18:55] take those three things and place them
[1:18:57] right
[1:19:01] in Saint Luke chapter 15.
[1:19:06] praise the Lord
[1:19:08] when the church find his brother the
[1:19:10] love when the church fine is wholly
[1:19:13] decency
[1:19:15] glory be to God
[1:19:17] when the church find a place in Christ
[1:19:20] the prophet of God says it will call to
[1:19:23] the other members of the body come and
[1:19:26] rejoice with us when we were having I
[1:19:28] was our special meetings that was what
[1:19:30] we were using for our team amen praise
[1:19:33] the Lord
[1:19:36] and uh uh so we see here that uh uh uh
[1:19:41] this these uh these virtues are are very
[1:19:46] important for us they are very very
[1:19:48] important there's a place we know that
[1:19:51] brother-in-law right there brotherly
[1:19:53] kindness you know uh uh the prophet of
[1:19:56] God says it will make us to bear with
[1:19:58] one another
[1:20:00] amen we will bear with one another on
[1:20:03] our knees we will we will esteem others
[1:20:05] better than ourselves like the Apostle
[1:20:07] Paul says we will learn to support one
[1:20:10] another instead of destroying one
[1:20:12] another amen we we will we will just be
[1:20:15] in that place you know our brother
[1:20:16] Brandon says they're in adoption message
[1:20:19] he says that was what Abraham does when
[1:20:22] he heard about love being taken away
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] when Lord and the kings of Sodom was
[1:20:31] taken away he says that was what Abraham
[1:20:34] Abraham did just like the father glory
[1:20:36] after a lost sheep one move him to to do
[1:20:40] their brother the love
[1:20:43] amen he was able to step over the past
[1:20:48] well whatever argument he and Lord have
[1:20:51] whatever disrespect that he taught the
[1:20:53] law of disrespect him he was able to
[1:20:55] step over that instead go after a fallen
[1:20:59] brother
[1:21:06] praise the Lord but we have we we have a
[1:21:09] bunch of demand that person have to do
[1:21:12] there to make sure they got to do this
[1:21:13] until this thing is right and uh you see
[1:21:16] it's it's just completely gone and the
[1:21:19] prophet of God will talk about it and he
[1:21:21] says he says they're in adoption he says
[1:21:23] when Abraham did that
[1:21:26] when Abraham did that
[1:21:29] the father adopted him
[1:21:32] he experienced an adoption
[1:21:36] you know what brother bran said he says
[1:21:38] it is the place where God where the
[1:21:40] father will call uh uh the son aside and
[1:21:44] and and and and bring him before The
[1:21:47] Heirs or his friends and he says that
[1:21:49] was exactly what God did he called
[1:21:51] Abraham to communion
[1:21:54] right
[1:21:56] Manchester that came on the scene
[1:22:00] there was a form of adoption you read a
[1:22:03] message adoption he said it right there
[1:22:06] and then he goes right there and even
[1:22:08] talked about the Prodigal Son
[1:22:13] Batman says that's when God can visit a
[1:22:16] man with angels
[1:22:19] because what you are doing the father
[1:22:21] bidding yes sir what is the father
[1:22:24] building what is the father desire is to
[1:22:27] go after all of his children right
[1:22:35] praise the Lord
[1:22:41] going after lost sheep brother brotherly
[1:22:44] kindness and then yeah the prophet is
[1:22:46] also saying when the church found its
[1:22:49] wholly decency
[1:22:51] the kind of for decency
[1:22:55] that must it is not just in our style of
[1:22:58] dressing
[1:23:00] praise the Lord
[1:23:02] amen by our manner of life our conduct
[1:23:07] amen
[1:23:09] yeah right
[1:23:11] yep the way we talk to one another
[1:23:18] the way we talk at home
[1:23:20] do we create an atmosphere for for
[1:23:22] angels to visit our home
[1:23:26] praise the Lord
[1:23:33] holy decency
[1:23:36] and just to see the the the the the the
[1:23:38] the the kind of indecent things that
[1:23:42] have creeped on the Believers
[1:23:45] you know amen and a lot of the things
[1:23:48] that uh you know uh uh uh uh people are
[1:23:53] lying in their lives in India home in
[1:23:56] India mine
[1:23:58] right
[1:24:01] right when the church find is brotherly
[1:24:04] kindness and holy decency
[1:24:10] no no matter how you know uh uh pure
[1:24:14] that later was dressing if she did not
[1:24:16] find that coin she was not this decent
[1:24:19] before her husband
[1:24:20] right
[1:24:25] are we together
[1:24:29] and let me tell you you can practice it
[1:24:33] it must come by the birth
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:44] and when the church find is placing
[1:24:46] Christ now that's the place where we get
[1:24:48] into the prodigal boys there when the
[1:24:51] church find its place in Christ it will
[1:24:54] call to the other members of the body
[1:24:56] come and rejoice with us
[1:24:58] God wants the church to love him right
[1:25:02] praise the Lord he want the church to
[1:25:05] love him so we were looking at these
[1:25:07] other at the position of these two boys
[1:25:11] yeah we said the younger one you know uh
[1:25:14] uh
[1:25:18] the scripture says when he came to
[1:25:20] himself
[1:25:22] so uh uh just like Paul says if the
[1:25:26] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:25:28] word in you it will do what it will
[1:25:30] Quicken your mortal body right praise
[1:25:33] the Lord
[1:25:35] unless we are experience the quickening
[1:25:38] power we are still sleeping
[1:25:41] in our natural nature in our in our
[1:25:44] human self
[1:25:47] we are trusted trusting our natural
[1:25:50] ability
[1:25:51] we are leaning on to our own
[1:25:54] understanding
[1:25:57] praise the Lord
[1:25:59] the need to come and Awakening
[1:26:03] the need to come and Awakening and just
[1:26:05] like I said last week uh you know uh uh
[1:26:10] we we we we we preach the Prodigal Son
[1:26:13] as uh uh you know we we all were
[1:26:16] practical when we were born you know and
[1:26:18] we were going from the father by the
[1:26:20] sinful nature
[1:26:22] but uh I look at a complete different
[1:26:25] way
[1:26:27] praise the Lord
[1:26:29] amen because uh a year this uh uh the
[1:26:34] the Sun never became a song when he came
[1:26:36] back to the father
[1:26:38] he was first born in the father's house
[1:26:42] and then he left the father house
[1:26:48] praise the Lord
[1:26:49] he left the father house so we have to
[1:26:52] realize that even even after we have
[1:26:56] given our heart to the Lord we we are
[1:26:58] born again we have to realize that we
[1:27:01] need to come to the place of uh uh our
[1:27:04] our word the Holy Ghost is taking
[1:27:06] complete control of our life
[1:27:09] right because you can still be born
[1:27:11] again and then you are just controlled
[1:27:13] by a religious spirit
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:19] you are just controlled by the religious
[1:27:21] spirit you just have a a kind of a
[1:27:24] religious zeal
[1:27:26] right we're in in your Zeal you can
[1:27:30] still be
[1:27:31] a a disregarding the word of God
[1:27:39] praise the Lord
[1:27:41] so you see the sun was already born in
[1:27:43] the house it's not it's not uh uh uh
[1:27:47] coming back that make him a son no he
[1:27:49] was already a son you have to realize
[1:27:52] that he lost the the gift he lost the
[1:27:56] inheritance that he had but he never
[1:27:58] lost his sonship right
[1:28:04] praise the Lord he never lost his
[1:28:06] sonship is that is that is that a
[1:28:09] position in his life as a song that gave
[1:28:12] him a craving for the father
[1:28:19] are we together
[1:28:22] so the younger son came to himself the
[1:28:25] other one like we said before he came to
[1:28:28] know that oh the father has was his
[1:28:32] and which of course uh uh uh uh that's
[1:28:36] that is that is that is another thing
[1:28:38] also
[1:28:39] and I would take few quotes here from
[1:28:41] brother Brandon now uh Church age and uh
[1:28:45] and and find a place to be able to wrap
[1:28:47] this tonight that will keep you long
[1:28:49] better man would talk here he says uh uh
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:54] like I said Auto all the order one came
[1:28:58] to know that all the father has uh was
[1:29:01] his it is not her how how we work to get
[1:29:05] rich overnight it is the character of
[1:29:08] the word that the father is looking at
[1:29:11] right praise the Lord
[1:29:13] amen so the ability there was that was
[1:29:17] in that boy that the place of a son for
[1:29:21] the for the for the for the young man to
[1:29:23] realize that he has a father to go back
[1:29:27] to his father that was a character
[1:29:29] that's a place of repentance
[1:29:33] there's a place that make a child to say
[1:29:36] Lord I need you
[1:29:38] yes
[1:29:40] not not not trying to fix it in ourself
[1:29:45] but realizing that without him we are
[1:29:48] nothing
[1:29:51] amen that is a character
[1:29:56] no matter how how many times we fail if
[1:30:00] we would just realize how how many times
[1:30:02] we feel is just how mod we need God in
[1:30:05] our life
[1:30:13] so it is not uh it is not how how we
[1:30:16] work
[1:30:17] people of God let me let me just bring
[1:30:20] their home for us to realize that yeah
[1:30:25] it don't take God
[1:30:28] to use your career to bless you
[1:30:32] God don't need your diplomat
[1:30:35] right to bless you
[1:30:38] the prophet of God said it's a new
[1:30:39] ticket
[1:30:41] is not to snatch you out of school no go
[1:30:44] to school but you have to realize
[1:30:46] that blessing do not come from the east
[1:30:49] or the West
[1:30:51] it comes from the Lord
[1:30:55] there are people that are more smarter
[1:30:58] than you
[1:31:00] praise the Lord
[1:31:02] before you got that certificate there
[1:31:04] were many people that got it
[1:31:11] praise the Lord so you see what the
[1:31:14] father looked for to be able to trust
[1:31:17] you
[1:31:18] with a blessing
[1:31:20] is character
[1:31:23] praise the Lord
[1:31:27] is character
[1:31:29] the character of the word the character
[1:31:32] of putting God first
[1:31:35] yes
[1:31:38] that's what the father looks for
[1:31:42] for him to be able to bless you or bless
[1:31:45] us he looking for that character he's
[1:31:48] not looking for our muscles
[1:31:52] praise the Lord
[1:31:56] because sometimes if you want to be
[1:31:58] Earnest to yourself with all the hours
[1:32:00] you put in you are still broke
[1:32:04] if you have really make the money by
[1:32:06] this time you should be retired or
[1:32:08] running your own business
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:18] brother random says here he says why
[1:32:21] does he stand by
[1:32:24] he says the reason is in Romans 8 17 18
[1:32:29] and if children
[1:32:31] then hear us if we are children they are
[1:32:34] all that the father have belong to us
[1:32:37] hear us of God he said John hears with
[1:32:40] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:32:45] praise the Lord not plaguing ourself
[1:32:49] amen
[1:32:51] not plaguing ourself
[1:32:55] was believing that
[1:32:57] God has everything under control
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:03] praise the Lord
[1:33:06] he says and and and and so that uh uh uh
[1:33:11] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:33:15] might that we may be also glorified
[1:33:19] together
[1:33:20] for Iraq on there the suffering of this
[1:33:23] present time I now wanted to be compared
[1:33:27] with the glory
[1:33:30] we shall be revealed
[1:33:32] praise the Lord as as much as we we read
[1:33:36] that and we enjoy it it have to be a
[1:33:39] revelation right
[1:33:41] praise the Lord I mean it has to be a
[1:33:44] revelation when you think about the
[1:33:46] people in the Dark Ages praise the Lord
[1:33:49] amen
[1:33:52] because that was that was their time
[1:33:56] you know how they saw it how I was
[1:33:59] sharing with her with her brother and I
[1:34:01] was I was reading uh uh I have one
[1:34:03] testimony thing that I was reading and
[1:34:06] this uh I think this was in Romania many
[1:34:08] years back and and there was a
[1:34:10] persecution on the church and and uh and
[1:34:13] this uh officer came in and you know and
[1:34:15] he was he was just saying all sorts of
[1:34:17] Blasphemous thing and and all of that
[1:34:20] and the lady said she said she said uh
[1:34:23] uh speaking to her husband she said
[1:34:25] won't you say something
[1:34:27] he said he says dear
[1:34:30] I don't I don't want you to to be a
[1:34:32] widow
[1:34:34] praise the Lord she looked at him and
[1:34:36] says I don't want a cow as a husband
[1:34:38] either
[1:34:40] if you were staying here and he would
[1:34:42] ridicule our Christ then I don't want
[1:34:44] you as a husband
[1:34:49] praise the Lord
[1:34:51] so you see it it became a revelation
[1:34:55] so some of those young
[1:34:57] sisters in the fact that that realized
[1:35:01] that they will not get married they will
[1:35:03] be burned to the stick
[1:35:05] it was a revelation to them right they
[1:35:08] never they never cry oh God what are you
[1:35:10] punishing me
[1:35:17] right some of them did they are wedding
[1:35:18] right before the Lion's Den
[1:35:21] got their first cake and the first case
[1:35:24] and they would throw into the lion's den
[1:35:29] let me tell you we have more than a
[1:35:31] lion's den
[1:35:33] praise the Lord laodisha has more than a
[1:35:37] lion's den because it's ravishing homes
[1:35:41] is Ravishing the lives of people
[1:35:43] that claimed to be sitting down under
[1:35:45] the word
[1:35:47] so don't don't think that I'm trying to
[1:35:49] make a scary story you already living in
[1:35:51] it the devil is like a rolling lion
[1:35:54] seeking for whom to divorce
[1:36:01] that's the reason why it must be a
[1:36:03] revelation
[1:36:10] Eternal Word Of Glory
[1:36:13] praise the Lord
[1:36:19] so the prophet go go ahead and say say
[1:36:22] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:36:25] reign with him we have to suffer to
[1:36:28] Reign that's the reason this is
[1:36:30] something that is very familiar with us
[1:36:33] the reason for this is that character
[1:36:36] simply
[1:36:38] is never made without suffering
[1:36:43] and their suffering is now punishment
[1:36:46] they are suffering is discipline
[1:36:50] to a child of God is disciplined
[1:36:53] the father want us to be disciplined on
[1:36:56] our time
[1:36:57] discipline with our thoughts discipline
[1:37:00] with the things that he gave us
[1:37:05] praise the Lord sometimes we think
[1:37:07] they're okay I I work I I take up my
[1:37:10] time the rest that's my money
[1:37:15] praise the Lord
[1:37:18] that's not your money
[1:37:20] God just trusted to you
[1:37:23] you are just a steward
[1:37:29] praise the Lord you see that's why he
[1:37:31] can bless us because we we feel it
[1:37:33] grabbing to it that's my money my high
[1:37:36] earned money
[1:37:39] imma give my high-end money to you
[1:37:43] the kind of a character that we have
[1:37:46] behind it
[1:37:48] praise the Lord when you can actually
[1:37:51] when you can actually count your money
[1:37:53] and come to an end people that have
[1:37:55] wealth they don't they never come to an
[1:37:57] end
[1:37:59] they have bunch that they don't know
[1:38:01] it's just there
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:09] but you can look at yourself you can
[1:38:11] count it 5 10 15 20.
[1:38:19] praise the Lord
[1:38:22] are we together
[1:38:25] so the prophet of God is saying here
[1:38:27] that's the reason that is far because
[1:38:29] character is never made without
[1:38:32] suffering discipline
[1:38:34] take suffering as discipline that the
[1:38:36] father want us to be disciplined right
[1:38:39] right that if God will trust you with
[1:38:41] something is it going to change your
[1:38:42] personality are you going to start
[1:38:44] enslaving other people because you have
[1:38:47] a little
[1:38:55] praise the Lord
[1:38:56] Joseph became a prime minister he never
[1:38:58] even went went to school maybe he did a
[1:39:02] little bit of of homeschooling
[1:39:05] before they saw him out
[1:39:07] he got to learn foreign language
[1:39:19] the father says all that I have is yours
[1:39:23] but here is him here he's in the house
[1:39:25] he's in a church and he thinks that he
[1:39:27] got a fast and pray Lord and you got to
[1:39:29] bless me Lord you got I mean all of
[1:39:32] those kind of for Pentecostal idea right
[1:39:35] prosperity
[1:39:37] ideas that we have in our mind
[1:39:41] I got a soul I'm I'm sowing seeds of
[1:39:44] blessing
[1:39:46] all you're doing you just do you are
[1:39:48] just doing your religious form of
[1:39:50] Lottery is you are playing Lotto
[1:39:53] I'm sowing since I'm giving ten dollars
[1:39:55] so God can give me hundred dollars
[1:40:01] when we are not disciplined
[1:40:04] we are not disciplined
[1:40:10] we are not disciplined
[1:40:15] young people we just want the money to
[1:40:18] get in our hands to get the next whether
[1:40:20] it's the next iPhone or next whatever we
[1:40:22] want to get
[1:40:24] sure and we just go on a shopping spree
[1:40:33] it is not how we work people
[1:40:37] that's not what the father is looking at
[1:40:40] father is looking at
[1:40:43] how disciplined
[1:40:45] how much are you considering his
[1:40:48] inheritance
[1:40:51] praise the Lord
[1:40:54] how much are you put into his
[1:40:56] inheritance
[1:40:58] if he leave it with you are you going to
[1:41:00] protect it
[1:41:04] can we stand like men in this church and
[1:41:07] say this is our church we will build
[1:41:09] this church we'll make sure that there
[1:41:12] will be no nothing will go wrong nothing
[1:41:14] I mean no foolishness will happen in
[1:41:16] this can we stand like brothers are we
[1:41:18] looking for the next opportunity to
[1:41:21] criticize
[1:41:25] praise the Lord
[1:41:30] are we just hoping that oh we we just
[1:41:33] wish that God would just sin or one rich
[1:41:35] man
[1:41:36] so he can build us a new church
[1:41:41] is that what we are looking at
[1:41:44] all we are saying this this is what I
[1:41:46] will raise my family
[1:41:48] praise the Lord
[1:41:52] you don't have to say it with your mouth
[1:41:54] go on your knees
[1:41:58] praise the Lord
[1:42:02] you will work hard to keep a good
[1:42:04] atmosphere in church you will know that
[1:42:06] your behavior affect the atmosphere in
[1:42:09] church
[1:42:19] he says character is a victory not a
[1:42:23] gift
[1:42:24] yeah
[1:42:26] and man with our character
[1:42:29] can Reign because power apart from
[1:42:31] character is satanic money with our
[1:42:35] character is devilish
[1:42:39] yeah
[1:42:42] praise the Lord
[1:42:46] if you don't have that character
[1:42:53] the power with character is fit to root
[1:42:57] that's what the father was looking for
[1:43:00] that's why he's looking for
[1:43:04] that character as a daughter of God
[1:43:08] you're not going to get in a blamed game
[1:43:10] with God
[1:43:14] when you understand that in one one in a
[1:43:18] million they're out of those million
[1:43:20] cells he choose you
[1:43:23] he watch over you
[1:43:25] he brought you to the knowledge to know
[1:43:28] him then you get in a blame game with
[1:43:31] God
[1:43:38] that is a character of the society that
[1:43:40] we are living in they blame their
[1:43:41] parents for everything
[1:43:45] they even blame their parents from for
[1:43:46] burning them
[1:43:58] praise the Lord
[1:44:01] when when a Son of God or the daughter
[1:44:03] of God get to this place where does he
[1:44:06] they see things happening around your
[1:44:08] life
[1:44:09] and as much as it's unbearable to the
[1:44:12] flesh but in your heart they say there
[1:44:14] is something special for God to take me
[1:44:16] through all of this there is something
[1:44:18] special that is what is at the back of
[1:44:21] their mind because they know that his
[1:44:23] thoughts concerning us are not evil
[1:44:34] God don't have evil thoughts
[1:44:38] we have to constantly remind ourselves
[1:44:41] that God do not have evil thoughts right
[1:44:44] evil talks do not proceed from God
[1:44:52] he thoughts are good
[1:44:56] but Power with character is fed to rule
[1:44:59] and since we won he want us to share
[1:45:05] even his throne
[1:45:08] on the same basis he he overcame and he
[1:45:12] sat down in his father's room then we
[1:45:15] have to we have to overcome
[1:45:19] praise the Lord
[1:45:21] and many times we just we we have to
[1:45:23] overcome our naive way of thinking
[1:45:28] our religious way of thinking
[1:45:31] yes sir praise the Lord
[1:45:35] amen
[1:45:37] God is not going to change his mind
[1:45:39] about you
[1:45:41] praise the Lord
[1:45:43] you're not going to impress God for him
[1:45:45] to get a better idea about you right
[1:45:51] to overcome our mind
[1:45:55] we have reduced God
[1:45:58] to our selfishness
[1:46:02] praise the Lord
[1:46:04] but I'll tell you he stayed in the
[1:46:06] heavens you have just make an idol for
[1:46:07] yourself
[1:46:08] yes sir that's not almighty God
[1:46:20] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:46:23] through brother Branham call it
[1:46:25] temporary because they have a time that
[1:46:28] it begins it will have a time to end
[1:46:33] praise the Lord
[1:46:36] we have to go back in the Bible and look
[1:46:38] for how many times the Bible says and it
[1:46:40] came to pass
[1:46:43] to remind ourselves that this one would
[1:46:46] come to pass
[1:46:51] that little temporary suffering we go
[1:46:53] through
[1:46:54] now it's not that water to be compared
[1:46:58] with their tremendous Glory
[1:47:02] that will be revealed
[1:47:06] amen
[1:47:08] reveal in us when he comes
[1:47:12] are we together
[1:47:14] now he takes this other thought he says
[1:47:16] now this is not against rich people and
[1:47:20] we're not against going to school we're
[1:47:22] not against working
[1:47:24] praise the Lord
[1:47:30] because God can save a rich man Joseph
[1:47:34] amatias was a rich man
[1:47:39] the Bible said Jesus was buried among
[1:47:41] the reach that's why Isaiah prophesied
[1:47:44] he will be buried among the reach
[1:47:55] some of God's children are rich
[1:47:58] but money can be
[1:48:01] such a snail
[1:48:03] now only to those who have it
[1:48:06] but to those of us
[1:48:10] who don't have it
[1:48:15] praise the Lord
[1:48:21] money can be such a snail not only to
[1:48:25] those who have it
[1:48:27] but to those who don't have it yeah
[1:48:31] he says way back there in the first age
[1:48:34] James cry out to those who were putting
[1:48:37] stocks in wealthy people
[1:48:41] have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus
[1:48:44] Christ with respect a person
[1:48:46] that's what James said he says the Paul
[1:48:50] there were trying to butter up the rich
[1:48:53] in order to get help
[1:49:01] rather than trusting in God yeah rather
[1:49:06] than trusting
[1:49:08] in God
[1:49:12] praise the Lord
[1:49:16] can we learn to trust in God yes sir
[1:49:23] if there is one
[1:49:25] powerful
[1:49:28] christ-like virtue
[1:49:34] is to trust
[1:49:36] in God
[1:49:39] praise the Lord
[1:49:41] amen amen is who trust in God
[1:49:47] not just from our head
[1:49:49] or something that wrestled him down in
[1:49:52] our heart
[1:49:55] praise the Lord
[1:50:01] he said James said don't do it
[1:50:04] said James don't do it money is in
[1:50:07] everything
[1:50:10] amen
[1:50:11] money is in everything
[1:50:14] people will quote ecclesiastic money and
[1:50:17] so all but money is not all right right
[1:50:22] money is not all
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:27] just like Paul says uh uh uh is is is uh
[1:50:32] the root of all evil
[1:50:39] the Love of Money
[1:50:42] not money
[1:50:45] but the love of him yes sir
[1:50:51] when it starts to take the place of
[1:50:53] almighty God
[1:50:55] in your life a consumed most of most of
[1:50:59] your time
[1:51:01] then the worship comes on then the time
[1:51:05] you must spend with God and spend with
[1:51:07] the people that God has given you
[1:51:11] yes sir
[1:51:21] are we together
[1:51:23] we're talking about holy decency
[1:51:28] holidays and said it's all about
[1:51:29] discipline
[1:51:34] amen
[1:51:35] it's all about discipline it brings you
[1:51:38] to a position in Christ
[1:51:48] I mean that you can get soul to that
[1:51:50] place where you even consider the rest
[1:51:52] of your body
[1:51:54] you say I must be in bed by this time
[1:51:57] God give me Grace
[1:51:59] right and when that time comes you can
[1:52:02] shut everything and give your body rest
[1:52:13] and say let me just give my body good
[1:52:16] rest
[1:52:17] good eight hour of sleep
[1:52:28] money isn't everything morning isn't the
[1:52:31] answer either
[1:52:32] and today it is it is not the answer
[1:52:36] either
[1:52:37] right we have more wealth
[1:52:40] than we have ever had
[1:52:43] and yet less
[1:52:45] is being
[1:52:47] accompanied spiritually
[1:52:52] praise the Lord
[1:52:53] less is being accompanied spiritually in
[1:52:56] our own life in our own home in our own
[1:53:01] church
[1:53:11] because we we have to understand
[1:53:14] the home is the backbone of the church
[1:53:16] right
[1:53:18] right if the home is now strong
[1:53:20] we we just we're putting up a show here
[1:53:24] if the word is not in our home if prayer
[1:53:26] is not in our home we're just putting up
[1:53:29] a show
[1:53:36] praise the Lord
[1:53:39] amen I will say that we're not spending
[1:53:40] time home you will not be in church
[1:53:45] you won't spend time in church
[1:53:49] if you're not spending time home
[1:53:52] you won't be in church
[1:53:55] praise the Lord
[1:54:03] if the home that you are paying for you
[1:54:06] will not have the time to spend there
[1:54:07] and spend time with your family
[1:54:10] you have every reason to be away from
[1:54:12] church
[1:54:22] praise the Lord
[1:54:24] listen to a program few few days or a
[1:54:27] few weeks ago and and uh and this this
[1:54:31] pastor was talking about we can't get
[1:54:33] people to come back to church after
[1:54:35] covet so we have to work out a way down
[1:54:38] to be able to set up our people online
[1:54:42] so churches are going to online service
[1:54:48] becoming just like a another Amazon
[1:54:55] you have his place
[1:54:59] because of distance of people
[1:55:03] that's not what I'm talking about

[1:55:15] it has to be in you
[1:55:37] we have more wealth
[1:55:40] than ever and yet less is being
[1:55:43] accomplished spiritually it is not with
[1:55:46] money that God works
[1:55:49] he moved by his spirit
[1:55:52] and that moving of the spirit only comes
[1:55:56] to a life consecrated
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:01] it only comes to a life consecrated the
[1:56:05] moving of the spirit only comes to a
[1:56:08] life concentrated Elijah what are you
[1:56:11] doing with that Bible and you're trying
[1:56:13] to make a new Bible
[1:56:16] praise the Lord
[1:56:19] the moving of the spirit only comes to a
[1:56:23] life
[1:56:31] praise the Lord
