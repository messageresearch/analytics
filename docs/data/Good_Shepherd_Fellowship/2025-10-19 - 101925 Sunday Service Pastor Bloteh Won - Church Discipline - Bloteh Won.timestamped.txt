[9:21] Shall we pray?
[9:25] Our Lord and our Savior Jesus, we thank
[9:28] you so much, oh God, for this morning.
[9:32] We are so grateful, Father,
[9:35] that we have lived to see this day
[9:39] and that we are witnesses
[9:43] of your greatness.
[9:46] For we have tasted
[9:49] of your divine love,
[9:51] your mercies,
[9:54] salvation,
[9:56] your peace, your joy. There is no
[10:00] denying that Lord.
[10:02] We are so grateful Lord
[10:06] that you have preserved our lives
[10:09] and have preserved our souls
[10:12] and have brought us this far.
[10:15] That we have only come this far purely
[10:17] by grace. Lord,
[10:20] we just thank you so much, Father, for
[10:23] the miracles thou have wrought in our
[10:26] lives.
[10:28] And Father, we give you the glory this
[10:29] morning. And we give you the honor,
[10:32] Father. And we praise thine holy name,
[10:34] Father, this morning. And we bless you
[10:37] with all our hearts and with all that is
[10:39] within us, Father, in the name of Jesus.
[10:44] More than ever before, Father, we pray.
[10:48] Deepen our hunger for your word. Let us
[10:53] thirst and hunger for your word like
[10:56] nothing else matters. Lord,
[10:58] &gt;&gt; let us crave for your word, Father, with
[11:02] passion, Lord.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we pray in the name of Jesus
[11:07] more than ever before. Give us that
[11:08] determination Lord
[11:11] that father
[11:15] we shall please thee
[11:18] under every circumstances.
[11:23] It doesn't matter
[11:25] how much we are tossed about
[11:28] by the storms of this life.
[11:31] One thing is sure that our uncle holds.
[11:36] It doesn't matter how high we are tossed
[11:38] by by the waves or how far we drift
[11:41] away. One thing is sure, praise be to
[11:44] your holy name, Father, that your anchor
[11:47] holds within the veil. Wonderful Jesus,
[11:51] what a great God you are,
[11:54] we have come that we may hear from you
[11:56] this morning.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; And we pray that you will speak to us.
[12:02] A lot of requests have been tabled
[12:04] before you this morning. Our brother,
[12:06] brother Loyal's birthday today. We are
[12:10] so grateful that you have added another
[12:12] year to his years. We pray that father
[12:15] oh God you will cause your face to shine
[12:18] upon him and may you bless him and
[12:21] father bless his ministry and we pray
[12:24] that more than ever before you will take
[12:27] the center stage in his life and prosper
[12:30] him beyond leaps and bounds.
[12:34] My Mary is due to travel the first week
[12:36] of next month for her for her daughter's
[12:39] memorial.
[12:41] We commit her journey, Father, into
[12:43] thine hands.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; That you will carry her safely and bring
[12:46] her safely back.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Father, she is in your arms of love.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; Guide and protect and deliver her father
[12:53] in Jesus name.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Our brother Bobby Wes has passed away.
[13:00] We commit the family into your hands. We
[13:04] pray that you will give them strength in
[13:07] this time of difficulty
[13:10] and just minister unto them
[13:13] beyond what human words could ever do.
[13:17] We want to thank you for little Olivia
[13:20] that is not feeling very fine. We pray
[13:24] that you'll go and minister healing unto
[13:26] her this moment
[13:28] &gt;&gt; and give her strength.
[13:30] We pray pleading the blood of Jesus upon
[13:32] her. Father and father we pray oh God
[13:36] may you break every yoke of the enemy
[13:39] that may be hanging over her life and
[13:42] let your glory fill her life in Jesus
[13:45] name.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Come take complete control over as many
[13:49] of us that have gathered before you and
[13:51] father minister unto us according to our
[13:53] needs. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[13:59] Praise the Lord.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; I owe God one testimony.
[14:08] Praise the Lord. And probably I should
[14:11] start with that.
[14:15] A check was issued in my wife's name
[14:17] last week and I were just shredding
[14:21] things
[14:23] and normally when a letter lies down too
[14:26] long and I take it, I don't even care
[14:28] what is inside. I just put it through
[14:31] the shredder. So I took this and for
[14:35] some reason I opened it. Even when I
[14:37] open I wasn't so satisfied and something
[14:40] said just look. When I looked, it was a
[14:42] check that was written, a genuine check
[14:46] of $800 and something dollars. So I
[14:49] showed it to her. She said, "No, I
[14:51] wasn't expecting this." I said, "It's a
[14:53] genuine check." She said, "Okay, let's
[14:55] keep it and call the people on Monday."
[14:57] So we kept it over the weekends. And I
[15:00] said, "No, there is no reason keeping
[15:02] it. It's genuine. We are going to cash
[15:04] it."
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Then I started looking for it. I
[15:09] couldn't find a check. We turn
[15:11] everything everything upside down in the
[15:13] house. We couldn't find a check.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; I put it in a folder. Everything in the
[15:20] folder was there. Things I didn't need.
[15:23] But the very thing I needed the most was
[15:26] not there, which was the check.
[15:29] So we went praying and I promised God
[15:33] when I find the check, I will come and
[15:35] testify to it.
[15:38] The following morning, Gaswell came down
[15:41] because I I sleep in the living room.
[15:45] And we said, "Go, I've been looking for
[15:47] a check. Did you see any check?" He
[15:50] said, "No." And then the mother said,
[15:53] "Just stretch this chair and look
[15:55] under." I said, "No, I did that twice
[15:57] already." And then when he stretched the
[15:59] chair, I mean the chair and looked under
[16:01] there was nothing. I said, "Mommy, there
[16:04] is nothing." The mother said, "Come and
[16:05] take this flashlight and look down
[16:07] there." And lo and behold, when he took
[16:10] it, it was just lined up with the side
[16:13] of the chair
[16:15] &gt;&gt; and there was no way you could see it.
[16:18] And she saw he saw the check. I said,
[16:21] "Praise the Lord."
[16:23] &gt;&gt; So, we found that check. You know, when
[16:25] you have too much, 800 doesn't mean
[16:27] anything.
[16:29] But when that 800 is something you are
[16:32] depending on to do something,
[16:34] &gt;&gt; it's more than $8,000.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; And I just thank God for it
[16:39] &gt;&gt; and I give God the glory for it.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you my wife's
[16:47] surgery went very very well.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; She sends her greetings.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:56] when we went
[16:59] in fact when they came to carry her to
[17:02] the surgical room she was just on the
[17:05] bed praying I was sitting down and they
[17:08] came and they were telling her ma'am we
[17:11] have come to take she didn't even care
[17:14] she was not she was not listening
[17:17] &gt;&gt; she was just praying and they were
[17:19] talking to her she was just praying
[17:22] &gt;&gt; and then they said okay you can go and
[17:23] wait in the lobby when we are done we'll
[17:26] come and get you. I said okay.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; And they were healing her away and she
[17:30] was praying
[17:31] &gt;&gt; unknown to me. She was praying in even
[17:35] she got to the surgical room praying
[17:37] praying and she broke in tongues.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; In the surgical room and they were
[17:42] holding her and she was shaking and she
[17:45] said the rest was history. She didn't
[17:47] know where she ended. She just woke up
[17:49] and realized they had finished with
[17:51] their surgery. Praise the Lord.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; God answers prayer.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for your prayers.
[18:00] Everything was very very successful. I
[18:02] was in the lobby. The doctor came out
[18:04] and called me
[18:05] &gt;&gt; and said, "Your wife surgery went very
[18:07] very well. All the paths went in
[18:10] perfectly well. You could see from the
[18:13] doctor's face how happy he was."
[18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; And in fact, she is recovering at a very
[18:19] fantastic rate.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; We went to the hospital last Thursday
[18:22] for her physical therapy. The therapist
[18:26] was telling her this is the first time I
[18:30] have seen somebody come for their first
[18:32] visit and do what you are doing. It's
[18:35] just amazing what she's doing.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; And we just want to thank you for your
[18:41] prayers and uh God is still answering
[18:44] prayer.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you all
[18:46] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[18:53] Let's put our hands together for Jesus
[18:55] this morning. Hallelujah.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Serving a living and a mighty God. Amen.
[19:03] And uh I want to also thank God. Last
[19:05] Thursday it was my daughter Elizabeth
[19:07] birthday.
[19:10] Happy birthday Elizabeth. Elizabeth. I
[19:13] just want to thank God for her. Amen. To
[19:17] God be the glory. All right, let's go
[19:19] ahead and stand as we worship God this
[19:21] morning. Ready to sing and dance for the
[19:24] almighty God and shake for God this
[19:26] morning. Hallelujah.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; What a friend we have in Jesus.
[19:41] All our sins and grief to bear.
[19:46] [Music]
[19:47] What a privilege to carry
[19:54] everything
[19:56] to God in prayer.
[20:01] Oh, at peace we often fall.
[20:07] Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[20:12] [Music]
[20:13] [Applause]
[20:14] All because we do not carry
[20:21] everything
[20:22] to God in prayer.
[20:27] Have we trials and temptation?
[20:33] Is there trouble anywhere?
[20:38] [Music]
[20:40] We should never be discourage.
[20:46] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[20:52] Can we find our friends so faithful?
[20:59] Who will all our sorrow share?
[21:05] Jesus
[21:06] knows our every weakness.
[21:11] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[21:18] How we we
[21:24] come by winter load of care.
[21:30] Precious
[21:32] Savior, still our reuge.
[21:35] [Music]
[21:36] Take me to the Lord in prayer.
[21:43] Those thy friends despise forsake
[21:47] me.
[21:49] Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[21:55] in his hand to take and share.
[22:02] We find our sorrows there.
[22:09] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Let's put
[22:12] our hands together for Jesus this
[22:14] morning and just turn to somebody and
[22:15] say, "God bless you this morning."

[43:31] And uh I need your prayers too for
[43:34] strength this morning.
[43:36] Praise the Lord for strength this
[43:38] morning. We we got it we got it just a
[43:41] few hours ago uh from uh Turkey. We went
[43:46] support one of our our friend young man
[43:50] that visited us here year before doing
[43:53] their wedding. Uh so we went his dad was
[43:56] a good friend, very good friend. Knew
[43:59] him since uh 1994 95 when I moved to the
[44:03] A coast. He was the voice of God
[44:06] representative there and uh uh we had
[44:09] good friendship
[44:11] over the years. We work together but uh
[44:16] the father passed away a couple of years
[44:18] ago and u and the mother uh was not able
[44:23] to get her visa to come for the wedding.
[44:26] So a lot of his uh dad friends, they all
[44:30] decided to go and support him and uh so
[44:34] I was able to uh take a lift with
[44:38] brother Ariel and his wife. They were
[44:41] supposed to stay but then uh I told them
[44:45] I would need a lift back home also. So I
[44:48] had a copy. stay shocked and and right
[44:51] after the wedding
[44:53] uh we cut away from the reception and
[44:56] took the road home. So, but we thank the
[44:58] Lord. He granted us a a safe trip back
[45:01] home and it's going to be in the house
[45:03] of the Lord this morning. Amen. Praise
[45:06] the Lord. So, u uh if I'm saying things,
[45:10] I'm not saying the word, but I might be
[45:12] sleeping. So, just bear with me with
[45:15] that one. Praise the Lord.
[45:18] And Uh uh
[45:22] the Lord has been good to us. Uh we we
[45:25] want to again announce uh the first
[45:27] weekend uh that will be the first and
[45:29] the second we will have the forest
[45:31] farmer with us and uh that weekend
[45:37] forest farmer has been a good friend to
[45:39] Mr. Assembly over the years and uh we
[45:43] love having him to come. Praise the
[45:44] Lord. Uh I promise you you will enjoy
[45:47] the weekend. Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; He's uh he's a he's a good he's a nice
[45:52] brother. The social burden for the word
[45:55] of God and for the people of God. Amen.
[45:59] And then uh uh the Wednesday that follow
[46:02] after our sister Rebecca, our uncle will
[46:05] be passing through Minneapolis and uh so
[46:08] he will speak for us on Wednesday. We
[46:11] thought we could get him over to Grace
[46:12] Ministry on Thursday, but brother Don
[46:14] Hoffman would not be around. So we will
[46:18] just have that Wednesday service with
[46:20] him and then he will go over to uh uh
[46:26] Ohio to be with brother Char that
[46:30] weekend.
[46:32] So uh
[46:34] uh I think so far that's uh what uh we
[46:40] have on our plate this morning for for
[46:43] announcement.
[46:45] This morning actually I had a I had a
[46:49] couple of few things I wanted to speak
[46:51] about and uh uh but I also now want to
[46:57] have a long service because I don't know
[46:58] if my body will be able to take take it
[47:02] and uh but this morning my my the actual
[47:05] subject that was on my mind was to talk
[47:07] a little bit on church discipline.
[47:11] I was going to talk on church
[47:13] discipline. I'm going to go into uh um
[47:16] Acts chapter 5 and uh and begin from
[47:20] there. But uh uh since I don't want to
[47:24] hold you too long, uh we just I'm just
[47:27] going to trust the Lord this morning, I
[47:29] also had another thought on my heart
[47:31] that I wanted to to share with you. So
[47:34] we would just trust the Lord to be able
[47:36] to help us uh as we as we go in the word
[47:40] this morning. So, thank you musicians
[47:44] and uh let's just uh go right in the
[47:46] word as we as we will read the scripture
[47:50] and just ask the Lord to be able to give
[47:53] us a sense of direction here. Praise the
[47:56] Lord. Uh to be able to give us a sense
[47:58] of direction.
[48:08] I'll take uh just one out of the book of
[48:11] Job. And then uh uh
[48:18] yeah and then we will
[48:24] go to the book of u
[48:28] the acts of the apostle. Job chapter
[48:33] Job chapter 36.
[48:40] Job chapter 36.
[48:48] Praise the Lord.
[48:51] Job chapter 36.
[48:56] And I'll read that and then uh whether
[48:59] it is what we will speak from, but I
[49:01] will I I will just share with you a
[49:03] little bit. And
[49:08] Job 36 verse 10.
[49:17] Job 36 verse 10.
[49:26] He openeth also their ears to discipline
[49:32] and commanded that they return from
[49:35] iniquity.
[49:37] If they obey and serve him, they shall
[49:40] spend their days in prosperity and their
[49:43] years in pleasure.
[49:45] But if they obey that, they shall perish
[49:48] by the sword and they shall die without
[49:53] knowledge.
[49:56] Father, we just want to thank you for
[49:58] the portion of your word that we have
[50:00] read this morning and uh I pray that God
[50:03] you would just please come and help us
[50:06] Lord that we will say something to your
[50:08] children this morning that will be
[50:10] encouraging, Father. And Lord God and
[50:13] bless us for speaking and
[50:16] And as we commit all of our needs in
[50:18] your hands this morning and uh uh sister
[50:22] to us uh two girls happy birthday too.
[50:25] Father we want to just commit them in
[50:28] your hands and pray that you bless them
[50:32] at every one of their needs. Bless those
[50:35] little girls. Lord Father sister ask
[50:38] that we lift her up in prayer this
[50:41] morning. We pray that God you bless Mar
[50:45] and just give her strength to her body.
[50:47] We love you Jesus. We love you father in
[50:51] your wonderful name. We pray with faith
[50:54] and thanksgiving. We remember
[50:58] this morning uh sister and little niece.
[51:02] Father, we hope that the situation gets
[51:05] out of control and we just place all of
[51:09] these things in you.
[51:11] You are faithful. You are faithful. We
[51:13] thank you. We appreciate you. In Jesus
[51:16] name we pray.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[51:21] your seat.
[51:24] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[51:26] seat.
[51:27] And uh uh uh when we had our our church
[51:32] meeting, when we had our church meeting,
[51:34] we uh uh
[51:38] we spoke in terms of uh
[51:42] uh
[51:46] laboring together to be able to uh
[51:51] uh
[51:55] keep an atmosphere where God can can
[51:58] come in our midst and uh and be able to
[52:02] bless us. Praise the Lord.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; And uh and in that re and in that uh uh
[52:10] thought of uh laboring together to be
[52:13] able to keep u
[52:17] a goal atmosphere in our mess
[52:22] is some of the reason why I have u have
[52:27] place on my heart to to kind of a talk
[52:30] on this. We we have to remember that
[52:33] brother Brandon says that uh God
[52:37] disciplined his children.
[52:39] Praise the Lord.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; God disciplined his children. And from
[52:43] the message of the hour, we understand
[52:45] also the difference between discipline
[52:47] and punishment.
[52:49] You know God is a god of discipline and
[52:53] uh uh punishment is for the wicked.
[52:56] Amen. Discipline is to be a character.
[53:00] So uh uh
[53:03] uh but the reason why I wanted to to uh
[53:08] to go into this
[53:11] you know when you when you just think
[53:12] about everything that is happening not
[53:15] only not only around our assembly but
[53:18] the word as a whole uh the word as a
[53:22] whole. Oh my god I forgot
[53:25] I forgot. I'll keep you for another
[53:27] time.
[53:29] There's there's there's a little video I
[53:31] wanted to show you. Uh yeah, I forget
[53:34] forget about it. That's fine.
[53:37] And I think the reason why I forgot
[53:38] about it because uh I'm I'm getting away
[53:41] from my uh uh
[53:45] uh subject that we been talking about.
[53:48] Revelation chapter 5. Uh Wednesday
[53:51] night, we were talking about the seven
[53:53] spirit. And it took us to look at uh the
[53:56] eye of God moving through and the earth.
[53:59] I also I also thought I will continue
[54:01] from there but uh this was more wearing
[54:05] on my heart because uh uh uh
[54:12] there was we were we were going to bring
[54:14] this subject to you and bring a matter
[54:16] to you but uh we will bring this subject
[54:19] without the matter because uh uh uh we
[54:24] still have to to
[54:28] talk some things out with the deacons.
[54:31] So I will I will just deal with the
[54:33] subject now. So u uh so with everything
[54:37] with everything that is that is
[54:39] happening around us we realize that uh
[54:43] our age is under such uh tremendous
[54:46] pressure. Amen. Tremendous pressure. And
[54:50] what we've been told from the word of
[54:52] God by the prophet of the hour is there
[54:55] when the Holy Ghost is leaving there
[54:58] will be enough demon power rise in the
[55:01] people on the earth and uh uh and you
[55:05] can see it everywhere. You know
[55:09] people are under pressure. You know
[55:12] people are under pressure. some of our
[55:14] our actions and reactions is all because
[55:19] of pressure.
[55:22] But uh the Lord is faithful. Amen. Be
[55:25] very faithful. And that is the reason
[55:27] why we've been kind of dwelling on that
[55:30] subject of the the the rider and the
[55:32] beast because we want to show you the
[55:35] the power that is that is pressurizing
[55:38] us for for for evil and then also show
[55:43] the power of God that is combating it.
[55:46] Amen. Because uh uh let let's be a show
[55:51] let's assure ourself in a sense that
[55:55] none of us in our physical mind we know
[55:58] that one can be able to stand against
[56:01] the enemy. None of us with all that we
[56:04] know about the word of God we can be
[56:06] able to stand. You know brother Brandham
[56:08] says overcoming is to know the devil by
[56:10] his tricks. Praise the Lord. is
[56:13] something that we say. But how do you
[56:16] know this this devil that have been
[56:19] deceiving? He deceived the wisest man,
[56:21] the strongest man, and uh uh uh uh I
[56:25] mean he's he's been here almost 6,000
[56:28] years more than you or myself, how we
[56:31] can really grab him by all his traits.
[56:35] So the purpose of bringing their subject
[56:38] is to be able to show us the important
[56:43] one of having a messenger of having a
[56:46] prophet.
[56:48] The important of having a prophet, the
[56:50] important of being under a prophet
[56:53] ministry.
[56:55] Praise the Lord.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Because just like we said Wednesday
[56:58] night and we saw it in the word of God,
[57:00] uh uh that's the eye of God.
[57:03] Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; That is the art of God. So it is the
[57:07] message of the hour that grab the enemy
[57:10] in his tracks.
[57:14] Is the message of the hour that expose
[57:16] to us the tricks of the devil.
[57:21] Praise the Lord.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Because just like the scripture says, it
[57:26] is so close that even it would deceive
[57:28] the very ear. So that is the reason why
[57:32] you know I've been I just been going
[57:34] around that subject to be able to just
[57:36] break it into pieces and and make it a
[57:39] little bit simple for us to be able to
[57:41] understand. But that is the place where
[57:42] I'm coming to
[57:45] you know that is the place where I'm
[57:47] coming to is not just to show us uh uh
[57:50] uh colors or just to uh uh but for us to
[57:53] be able to see
[57:56] how blessed we are, how privileged we
[57:58] are.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] It's almost like brother Ram says that
[58:04] God gave his children the best weapon
[58:08] &gt;&gt; and that was the word.
[58:10] Praise the Lord.
[58:13] So if we if we if we see all of those
[58:15] things and understand it then you will
[58:18] know that when you leave the word in
[58:22] whatever way you have just exposed
[58:25] yourself for trouble.
[58:30] Praise the Lord.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; When you leave the word,
[58:34] you have just exposed yourself for
[58:37] trouble. And remember the Bible says
[58:40] that the devil know that his time is
[58:43] out.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; He know that he does not have any time.
[58:49] So he's ready to throw anything at you.
[58:52] Anything he can get in his hands to
[58:55] throw at you, he's ready to throw at
[58:58] you.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; If he can just get you frustrated,
[59:09] that's that. I mean, that that just all
[59:11] he just want to rob you. He comes to
[59:13] steal, kill, and destroy.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He just come to rob you.
[59:20] I think one thing that the devil knows
[59:22] there is they are the uh uh he can't
[59:25] change a a seed of God to a seed of the
[59:28] devil or the seed of the serpent. He
[59:30] cannot do it.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; But if he can cause you to be so rough
[59:35] that you can never enjoy this salvation
[59:38] that is freely given to you.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; That you can never enjoy it.
[59:47] you you would just you just go from one
[59:49] cycle to another cycle to another
[59:52] problem to another problem because what
[59:54] he's trying to do is to destroy the
[59:57] confidence of God's word
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; frustrates you so much that it looks to
[1:00:04] you that there is nothing in this Bible
[1:00:06] is truth.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] And then uh we just become a miserable
[1:00:17] son of God or the miserable daughter of
[1:00:19] God uh uh all of our days on the earth.
[1:00:29] So that is the reason why we are we we
[1:00:32] we are dwelling on that subject
[1:00:35] and uh uh
[1:00:43] so when you look when you look all
[1:00:44] through the scripture
[1:00:46] something I was I was I was uh I was
[1:00:49] looking at uh lying down just meditating
[1:00:52] that came to my mind I was just looking
[1:00:54] at some parallel uh uh uh through the
[1:00:57] scripture and some of the things that uh
[1:00:59] that happens through uh uh uh the
[1:01:02] scripture. Now the the Bible would tell
[1:01:05] us uh uh right uh uh even right there in
[1:01:10] Eden. Let me try to find my way to this
[1:01:14] as quick as I can and uh uh just just to
[1:01:17] be able to bring something that will
[1:01:19] that can be edifier to you this morning.
[1:01:22] When the first son of God uh uh uh fell
[1:01:26] from God's principle, left God's word,
[1:01:29] God came down and brother Bon make us to
[1:01:32] know God judge sin right to where sin
[1:01:37] happened. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; He judge it right there in Eden and he
[1:01:42] also judge it in the body that sin was
[1:01:45] committed in.
[1:01:48] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; He told Eve in pain and sorrow he told
[1:01:52] Adam you know from the sweat of your
[1:01:54] brow.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; So even even the even the even the white
[1:02:04] judgment when God is judging sin, it
[1:02:06] will be right back here.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; On earth.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And the body that sin was committed
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; is the body that sin will be judged in.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:19] because that's God's principle. That's
[1:02:21] what he did in the beginning.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And and so with that principle in mind,
[1:02:31] we can see that
[1:02:34] whatsoever we sow in this body,
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; we will reap it in this body.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:02:48] The white true judgment is not going to
[1:02:50] be in heaven. It's going to be here on
[1:02:53] earth because uh sin was committed here
[1:02:55] on earth
[1:02:58] and we will not be judged or sinners
[1:03:01] will not be judged because there is no
[1:03:03] condemnation to them that are in Christ.
[1:03:05] Are you glad for that
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; that we have passed from death onto
[1:03:09] life.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; So sinners will not be judged in
[1:03:12] celestial body.
[1:03:14] sinner will be judged in the body that
[1:03:17] sin was committed.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Now, so so uh uh uh with that in mind, I
[1:03:32] I just want to run you a little bit when
[1:03:34] you look through the principle and and
[1:03:37] what I was thinking about is that the
[1:03:42] uh the the the first evil that was done
[1:03:44] after appreciate the service last
[1:03:46] Sunday. Yeah, brother, you were talking
[1:03:48] a little bit about that going back to
[1:03:49] Eden and all of that. We know that uh uh
[1:03:53] that was uh uh that that was idolatry.
[1:03:58] Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Adultery was the act that was committed.
[1:04:05] But the sin
[1:04:07] was unbelief.
[1:04:10] That's why brother Brandham said sin is
[1:04:12] unbelief.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; The sin was unbelief because she left
[1:04:19] the word.
[1:04:21] And because she left the word, her body
[1:04:24] was now exposed
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; to the act.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; The art was the result of the scene.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; So you see there all through the
[1:04:43] scripture. Another place you look at,
[1:04:46] you will see in the songs of Judah.
[1:04:49] Reuben was the firstborn.
[1:04:52] But Ruben was stripped of the
[1:04:54] birthright. He was stripped of the
[1:04:56] priesthood and and the kingship.
[1:04:59] Why? Because he committed h an
[1:05:03] abominable act. He slept with his
[1:05:06] father's wife.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And because that was done, he was
[1:05:14] stripped of those things.
[1:05:17] Now watch now in the New Testament,
[1:05:22] Paul
[1:05:23] will show us a case in the book of
[1:05:26] Corinth where there is another man in
[1:05:28] the church. That that was the Old
[1:05:31] Testament. Now in the New Testament
[1:05:33] church, there's another man in the
[1:05:34] church sleeping with his father's wife.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:40] And Paul will ask that that thing must
[1:05:43] not be mentioned among us. That man must
[1:05:45] be excommunicated.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; So in in in first Corinthian he was
[1:05:50] excommunicated. In second Corinthian he
[1:05:53] had repented and he was restored to the
[1:05:55] church.
[1:05:59] Are we together?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] Now, so you will see it and and another
[1:06:06] thing that that that that that grabbed
[1:06:08] my mind was that uh in in the book of
[1:06:12] Joshua, we know of Achon taking the
[1:06:17] Babylon Gam.
[1:06:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And when he took the Babylonian garment,
[1:06:23] he hid it in his tent. And we know that
[1:06:27] that thing caused death in the camp. And
[1:06:30] it it it caught Joshua attention because
[1:06:33] honor Joshua commission God told him
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; that I will be with you just like I was
[1:06:41] with Moses.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; So when those people died,
[1:06:49] Joshua called a certain assembly to find
[1:06:52] out what was going on.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; So he called the people and then finally
[1:07:00] we realized that uh uh it was Achan that
[1:07:03] stole the Babylon.
[1:07:05] Praise the Lord. Now watch the principle
[1:07:08] here. Because of the wrong that that
[1:07:12] Achon did, it cost his entire family.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] It cost his entire family.
[1:07:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; When you come over in the New Testament,
[1:07:32] Acts chapter 5, I want to pick up
[1:07:34] something from there. Acts chapter 5,
[1:07:36] the Bible talks about another household,
[1:07:40] Ananas and Safar.
[1:07:42] Now I'm trying to show you a parallel
[1:07:46] of how God
[1:07:48] all through has brought some sense of
[1:07:51] discipline.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh uh
[1:08:02] in Acts chapter 5, Acts chapter 5 never
[1:08:07] never give us the full picture of
[1:08:10] whether Ananas and Sophia had children.
[1:08:14] But what we know here in the in the
[1:08:17] scripture is that the Bible says both
[1:08:20] Ananas and Safara their bodies were
[1:08:23] packed
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; to the grave because they lied to the
[1:08:28] Holy Ghost.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; But what I want to show you the
[1:08:33] difference is that under the New
[1:08:36] Testament because of the blood of Jesus
[1:08:40] Christ.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:43] If if if uh if Ananiah's wife will have
[1:08:47] come
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; and said,
[1:08:51] "No, I don't know about this thing. I I
[1:08:52] mean, this thing is my husband." Amen.
[1:08:55] If she will have come and said the
[1:08:57] truth, the blood will have protected
[1:09:00] her.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; On the Old Testament, they never had the
[1:09:05] benefit of the blood like we have.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. One woman saw a Babylonian garment
[1:09:13] death run across the family.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And uh in in the New Testament uh uh uh
[1:09:24] this man and his wife lied against the
[1:09:27] Holy Ghost. Both of them their body was
[1:09:29] packed to the grave. Are we together?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the reason why I I I I want
[1:09:37] you to see this is because brother
[1:09:40] Brandham said under the New Testament
[1:09:43] church that's the reason why church
[1:09:45] discipline we must be reminded of church
[1:09:48] discipline because he said because we
[1:09:51] are under the blood if a person is
[1:09:54] living wrong or doing wrong God will not
[1:09:56] do anything to them
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; until the church take them from under
[1:10:02] the blood.
[1:10:05] That's why Paul had to apply that
[1:10:08] principle.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Because the blood protects the body and
[1:10:15] when a person is identified with the
[1:10:18] body, baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:10:21] Jesus Christ in fellowship, partake of
[1:10:23] communion, partake of everything, you
[1:10:26] are under the protection of the church.
[1:10:30] And he says that is the reason why the
[1:10:32] New Testament church is doing poor.
[1:10:37] That's why the church is not standing in
[1:10:39] her strength.
[1:10:44] Why? Because we want big church. We want
[1:10:47] many people. So we allow everything to
[1:10:50] happen.
[1:10:54] Are we together?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Looks like you were not expecting this.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I myself I was not expecting it
[1:11:08] too.
[1:11:10] I I promise you I was not expecting it.
[1:11:15] Glory be to God.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:22] Let's look in Acts chapter 5. Like I
[1:11:25] said,
[1:11:27] let's look in Acts chapter 5.
[1:11:44] Let's read from verse 11.
[1:11:47] Acts chapter 5 from verse 11. Acts
[1:12:03] chapter 5 from verse 11 the Bible says
[1:12:06] and great fear came upon all the church
[1:12:09] and upon as many as heard these saints
[1:12:12] her wife that both Ananas and his wife
[1:12:14] died. Praise the Lord. Fear came upon
[1:12:17] the church and all those that here. And
[1:12:19] the Bible say verse 12, "And by the
[1:12:22] hands of the apostle where many signs
[1:12:26] and wonders wrought among the people,
[1:12:29] and they and they were all with one
[1:12:33] accord in Solomon's porch." Listen to
[1:12:36] this. This is the verse I wanted to get.
[1:12:39] and the rest does no man join himself to
[1:12:43] them,
[1:12:45] but the people magnify God.
[1:12:49] Now you see because we we we we say this
[1:12:54] that you cannot join the church
[1:12:57] and it's true. You cannot join the
[1:12:59] church. The church is not an
[1:13:01] organization that you can join. Praise
[1:13:04] the Lord.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] Jim Setter
[1:13:10] uh help me with your friend there beside
[1:13:13] you. I don't want you sleeping now. So,
[1:13:16] uh uh uh the the church, you can't join
[1:13:19] the church. You you have to come by St.
[1:13:22] John chapter 3, the new birth. You got
[1:13:24] to be born again. Are we together?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Because this is the family of God. This
[1:13:30] is not an association.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; This is not an association. And we we
[1:13:36] want to strive not to run the church as
[1:13:38] an association.
[1:13:41] We don't want to run it by no
[1:13:44] nationality influence.
[1:13:47] Praise the Lord. People come here, they
[1:13:49] meet me most of the time when I'm around
[1:13:51] you doing something, they ask says, "So,
[1:13:53] well, is there a Liberian church?" I
[1:13:55] said, "No,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; this is not a Liberian church. This is a
[1:13:58] Christian church."
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; If it was a Liberian church, we get a
[1:14:08] Liberian flag. But because it's a
[1:14:10] Christian Christian church, only the
[1:14:12] word of God we live up.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It's not an association.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And uh so the thing about it there is
[1:14:24] that the uh uh uh the church
[1:14:29] Yeah. The Bible let us know that because
[1:14:33] of the way that God were dealing dealing
[1:14:35] with the apostles, nobody joined him.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; You don't join him. You got converted.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody dare joined him.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; And what what happened was there was
[1:14:51] such a presence.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; The people knew that
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; you You God have to be dealing with you.
[1:15:02] You you have to you have to uh h
[1:15:07] have an experience with God. You
[1:15:08] remember Simon the sorceress when he
[1:15:11] came he saw what the apostle was doing
[1:15:14] and he he thought he could give some
[1:15:16] money to buy it. Peter say you and your
[1:15:18] money go to hell.
[1:15:25] So you don't join the church.
[1:15:28] It's not a body that you can join
[1:15:30] yourself to.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So I mean uh uh uh when we when we get
[1:15:45] to this place and you know when in uh uh
[1:15:49] uh
[1:15:51] in uh in in the same regard.
[1:15:54] We don't want to we don't want to set
[1:15:56] ourself up like uh like a like a like a
[1:16:00] c.
[1:16:02] No, we are not a c. This is not a set.
[1:16:04] This is not a c.
[1:16:06] This is the move of God.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the move of God where we
[1:16:15] believe that God has called us to govern
[1:16:18] our life by the word of God.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; So, we see it all through the scripture.
[1:16:26] He's a God of discipline.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; He's a God of discipline. I mean, I I
[1:16:32] was I was I was lying there the other
[1:16:34] night and and I was just thinking about
[1:16:36] it. I say uh which of course I've used
[1:16:38] this in the past but it just came back
[1:16:40] as a flashback to my mind and just
[1:16:42] running those parallel all through the
[1:16:44] scripture.
[1:16:46] Judah was rob of all of his inheritance.
[1:16:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; He was robbed of all of inheritance. The
[1:16:56] the breth was taken away from him and uh
[1:16:59] uh uh uh uh uh the priesthood was taken
[1:17:03] away from him and uh and the kingship
[1:17:08] It was taken away. The priesthood was
[1:17:10] given to Levi. Kingship was given to
[1:17:11] Judah. The breth was given to to Joseph.
[1:17:15] He lost it.
[1:17:19] Now that's that's under the Old
[1:17:21] Testament. So we see here uh New
[1:17:24] Testament Paul mention of a man doing
[1:17:28] the same thing sleeping with his
[1:17:29] father's wife. He said excommunicate
[1:17:31] that man from among us.
[1:17:35] He said those things must not be
[1:17:37] mentioned among us. Those things are
[1:17:40] mentioned in the word. It must not be
[1:17:42] mentioned among us.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I I will tell you something. I will tell
[1:17:47] you. I have seen how sin
[1:17:53] has ravaged
[1:17:58] church. Not only the church as a church
[1:18:01] but family
[1:18:06] it has ravaged family. It it it
[1:18:09] destroyed the lives of innocent children
[1:18:14] and before you realize it's just a a a
[1:18:17] complete abomination.
[1:18:20] And I and I would not be afraid to say
[1:18:23] those things are happening in our ranks.
[1:18:27] There are a lot of abuses
[1:18:31] that are happening in our ranks.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And I believe that by the grace of God,
[1:18:48] God has called us and exposed us to a
[1:18:52] level of truth in his word to raise up
[1:18:54] the standard. Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come as a flaw, God will
[1:18:59] raise up a stand up. And you are the
[1:19:01] standard of God in this age.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; A people that can stand for truth, stand
[1:19:07] for decency.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Stand for righteousness.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; We're not telling anybody that we better
[1:19:15] than anybody.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; We are only saying by the grace of God.
[1:19:23] We are respecting what God's word says.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Ananas, like I said, uh uh uh uh uh
[1:19:34] their uh uh uh Achon Joshua, he stole a
[1:19:39] Babylonian garment because because they
[1:19:42] never had a blood protection. The blood
[1:19:44] of bulls and goats could not protect it.
[1:19:50] like the way the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:19:53] is protecting us.
[1:19:56] And that is the thing that that we the
[1:19:58] Gentiles are h are uh uh uh we are like
[1:20:05] Paul says in Hebrew, we are uh we we we
[1:20:09] are spitting in the face of the blood
[1:20:11] that was spilled for us. Amen.
[1:20:17] I like the way he says it. Hebrews
[1:20:20] chapter 6. Let's Let's go there a little
[1:20:21] bit. Let's go there a little bit. Like I
[1:20:24] said this this morning, you just got to
[1:20:26] bear with me. Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You just got to bear with me. I I hope
[1:20:31] not to keep you long, but uh uh I'm
[1:20:35] setting setting the stage here because I
[1:20:38] will have to come back to this
[1:20:45] If we don't pay attention to these
[1:20:47] things, uh it will be it will be a
[1:20:50] history that we will not want to we will
[1:20:53] not want to talk about. Amen.
[1:20:57] But if we pay attention to it and God
[1:20:59] gave us the grace to get back to to to
[1:21:03] to cleaning up our skirts and cleaning
[1:21:05] our lives, we will be proud
[1:21:09] that God help us in our generation.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:20] Paul will talk talk here. Uh uh
[1:21:34] he will speak here and says ver verse
[1:21:36] four. Let's read from verse four. For it
[1:21:39] is impossible for those for those who
[1:21:42] were once enlightened,
[1:21:45] and they have tasted of the heavenly
[1:21:47] gifts,
[1:21:49] and they were made partakers of the Holy
[1:21:51] Ghost. They rejoice in the world. Oh, it
[1:21:54] was a wonderful sermon. I felt the
[1:21:57] presence of God.
[1:22:00] They enjoy all of that.
[1:22:03] Amen.
[1:22:08] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:22:12] the power of the word to come.
[1:22:16] That hope of a resurrection,
[1:22:19] that hope uh that gave you the desire to
[1:22:22] want to go in the rapture.
[1:22:25] You have tasted of the good of the word
[1:22:27] to come.
[1:22:29] He says, "If they shall fall away to
[1:22:32] renew them again unto repentance." This
[1:22:36] is this is the thing that caught my mind
[1:22:39] seeing
[1:22:40] the crucified to themsel.
[1:22:46] They crucified to themsel. They have got
[1:22:49] to the place where they have uh reduced
[1:22:52] the word of God that the fear of God is
[1:22:55] not in them. They can say anything about
[1:22:58] the word of God. They can do anything in
[1:23:00] their life. They have crucified to
[1:23:02] themsel.
[1:23:07] You cannot crucify Jesus the second
[1:23:10] time, but you can crucify him to
[1:23:12] yourself in a sense that his word will
[1:23:16] never have effect in your life. Nobody
[1:23:19] no matter who say it to you.
[1:23:23] No matter who say it to you, it will
[1:23:24] never have. It will not move you.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You have crucified the word to yourself.
[1:23:33] You can never come to repentance. You
[1:23:35] can never regret. You don't have remorse
[1:23:37] for doing wrong.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; It don't break your heart that you know
[1:23:42] that there are things in the world you
[1:23:44] must not do.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:56] And this and this is a dangerous place
[1:23:58] to get
[1:24:00] because you see God he's he's the God of
[1:24:04] mercy. Amen.
[1:24:07] If you come to God and and repent and
[1:24:10] ask for forgiveness, he will forgive
[1:24:12] you. But if the desire is not in you to
[1:24:16] come,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; that's what happened in here.
[1:24:22] Amen. It's not that God will never
[1:24:24] forgive you, but you don't have the
[1:24:26] desire.
[1:24:28] You don't have the desire to be
[1:24:30] forgiven. You don't have the desire to
[1:24:32] repent because you have crucified the
[1:24:34] word to yourself.
[1:24:39] Nothing move you anymore.
[1:24:47] And that's a terrible place to get. King
[1:24:50] got to that place and the Bible says he
[1:24:52] wandered in the earth like a vakabone
[1:24:58] because he was not he was not even h no
[1:25:01] remorse in his heart and he's asking
[1:25:03] almighty God am I my brother's keeper
[1:25:09] the thing that gave us the desire to
[1:25:13] persevere to to come to the house of God
[1:25:17] that little thing in you that little
[1:25:20] still small voice don't kill it
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; because you will not always have it.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah the Bible said the
[1:25:31] spirit of God will not strive with men
[1:25:33] anymore which mean God started dealing
[1:25:37] with their hearts.
[1:25:43] The reason why you can say you can pray
[1:25:45] for forgiveness. The reason why you can
[1:25:47] cry and say, "Oh God, help me. Oh God,
[1:25:50] help me." It's not because of your
[1:25:52] strength.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; It's because of that little thing
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; that God put in your heart.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; When it go away, there is no money that
[1:26:01] can give it to you.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; There is no church you can go to, you
[1:26:05] will get it.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It never came by your natural birth. It
[1:26:08] came by the grace of God.
[1:26:22] Are we together?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:36] Seeing they crucified to themselves the
[1:26:38] son of God aresh and put him to an open
[1:26:42] shame.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; You counting the blood nothing.
[1:26:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Counting the blood the grace of God
[1:26:52] nothing.
[1:26:56] In this very same letter, Paul says,
[1:26:58] "It's a fearful thing to fall in the
[1:27:01] hands of the living God.
[1:27:06] It's a scary thing
[1:27:10] to fall in the hands of the living."
[1:27:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:18] living in such a world. Uh uh uh uh you
[1:27:21] know you you you start to to to to
[1:27:24] preach these things and and say these
[1:27:26] things and uh the age classify you.
[1:27:31] You know classify you that you are
[1:27:33] running because you are not it's is it's
[1:27:36] not appealing to the culture.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was just I was I was
[1:27:41] just sharing something with uh every
[1:27:43] last night. We were driving just
[1:27:44] talking, fellowshipping, trying to keep
[1:27:46] ourel awake. Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Trying to keep ourel awake. I never took
[1:27:50] toothpicks. Normally I would put
[1:27:51] toothpicks and keep my eyes open.
[1:27:58] I'm just joking.
[1:28:01] So we're trying to keep ourel awake and
[1:28:03] we're just we're just just having a good
[1:28:05] time. And I told him I say I was just
[1:28:07] thinking about this thing. You you just
[1:28:09] you just look at how how the the the
[1:28:13] morning culture is just swallowing us
[1:28:16] up.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; As soon we see it, we want to do it.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; As soon as we see it, we want to do it.
[1:28:29] And I was I was this day I was just
[1:28:31] there. I was saying, "Oh God, we ever
[1:28:35] reach to the time
[1:28:38] where
[1:28:40] wearing
[1:28:42] trousers will be normalized for our
[1:28:45] sisters.
[1:28:48] Will we ever get to that time
[1:28:53] where we will we will we will we will
[1:28:55] come to a place where uh uh a sensus
[1:28:58] that yeah you know uh uh we let me tell
[1:29:01] you all
[1:29:03] the revival in the past that have got to
[1:29:06] that place. They never knew that they
[1:29:09] would get there.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; They never knew that they would get
[1:29:14] there. They never knew how holiness
[1:29:17] would go away from them
[1:29:21] and they would become so worldly
[1:29:26] all because they want to appeal
[1:29:29] to the modern way of doing things. They
[1:29:33] want to be h have a popular exception to
[1:29:38] be accepted by the people.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:44] I thought about that and I says, "God
[1:29:47] forbid.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; God will have to shut it because he says
[1:29:54] this move of God will not be
[1:29:55] denominated."
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will have to shut it.
[1:30:02] He will have to shut it.
[1:30:07] But yet those are things that are
[1:30:09] creeping into our rings.
[1:30:13] They are creeping into our ranks.
[1:30:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:22] The same way uh many years ago, the way
[1:30:26] family life, oh my god,
[1:30:30] you find people they were praying,
[1:30:32] praying for the Holy Ghost and fasting
[1:30:34] and praying and and they love one
[1:30:37] another, but they just felt like they
[1:30:39] were not ready to get married because
[1:30:40] they felt they did not have the Holy
[1:30:42] Ghost.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I know the couple like that.
[1:30:46] They stay many years because the brother
[1:30:48] was not convinced he had the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:51] Well, anyway, it was the way he was
[1:30:53] taught.
[1:30:54] Praise the Lord. So, let me just leave
[1:30:57] that one. That's a different story. But
[1:30:58] the thing about it there is they are the
[1:31:01] uh uh but those things are no longer
[1:31:03] like that. They are no longer. We have
[1:31:06] we have uh uh uh we we we have Facebook
[1:31:09] wedding, Tik Tok wedding.
[1:31:14] Yeah.
[1:31:16] We have all of those things.
[1:31:25] A situation was brought brought before
[1:31:27] me a couple of months ago when and uh uh
[1:31:29] uh uh a brother backslided
[1:31:33] not serving God.
[1:31:36] Ruin churches ran around the sisters.
[1:31:43] Mary left his wife travel got on on the
[1:31:45] internet talking to her sister in a
[1:31:47] different country went there
[1:31:51] and the brothers never even had the
[1:31:53] grace to say let's look at this that
[1:31:55] found this man background
[1:31:57] he has a wife that he has left and he
[1:32:00] went and got married to a young virgin
[1:32:03] girl
[1:32:07] that that Malach I'm telling you people
[1:32:08] about I'm not talking about Luchian
[1:32:24] that you you will do a wedding and will
[1:32:26] not even know where this guy is coming
[1:32:28] from
[1:32:35] because he came from Dubai.
[1:32:41] Praise the Lord. No, it's true. He came
[1:32:43] from Dubai.
[1:32:46] So, it's an opportunity now. Our our
[1:32:48] daughter, our precious sister coming to
[1:32:50] go overseas.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:11] You love the Lord.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; See, because we get so so in a place
[1:33:25] where we get intimidated when it looks
[1:33:28] like our church is a small church. So it
[1:33:31] looks like we must leave those things.
[1:33:32] So, so the church can grow.
[1:33:38] In as in the book of Acts,
[1:33:43] Jesus talked about the parable of the
[1:33:46] living.
[1:33:50] That was fulfilled in the in the New
[1:33:52] Testament church
[1:33:55] when the Bible talks about the 3,000
[1:33:58] souls that were saved.
[1:34:01] That was how mixed multitude came in the
[1:34:03] church.
[1:34:08] That was how mixed multitude came in the
[1:34:10] church.
[1:34:11] Ananas and Safar, they were all part of
[1:34:13] that 3,000 that were saved.
[1:34:22] Are we together?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not I hope you know that I'm not mad
[1:34:27] with you. Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; You know that. Okay. I'm I'm not mad.
[1:34:32] It's just that uh uh I'm I'm tired. If
[1:34:36] I'm sounding angry, it's because I'm
[1:34:37] tired. I'm not mad.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Truth. I'm I'm not mad with you. It's
[1:34:41] just there to uh uh that's that's what I
[1:34:45] had on my heart. You see me? I'm not
[1:34:46] even reading quotes because I'm just
[1:34:48] trying to to run you through give you
[1:34:51] the picture of what I wanted to talk
[1:34:52] about this morning.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm mad with you. a mad with the
[1:34:59] devil. Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Mad with the devil. And I'm trying to
[1:35:04] say to you that we we have to we have to
[1:35:07] wake up from the dust.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; We have to wake up from the dust.
[1:35:16] You know, I just love it because our
[1:35:18] Lord Jesus make it so simple. He said
[1:35:21] where whatsoever two or three he make
[1:35:23] the church so simple
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; that we don't have to be intimidated if
[1:35:28] we are a small group if that what it
[1:35:30] would takes for us to stand for the word
[1:35:33] of God then let it take it
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; then let it take it
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; because what what is what is the need of
[1:35:43] wanting to get get a a a big church and
[1:35:46] before we realize our young children are
[1:35:49] defied
[1:35:55] What is the need of that?
[1:36:02] That we don't have word that can bring
[1:36:03] them to their knees and bring them to to
[1:36:05] to repentance and and and and and
[1:36:09] the fear of God in their heart.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; We just come and and and preach
[1:36:14] something and make everybody live and
[1:36:15] and let's clap for Jesus. Let's sing.
[1:36:18] Hit the music. Let's dance. Let's
[1:36:19] worship the Lord and then let's go home.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; How are we getting ourselves ready for
[1:36:24] the rapture?
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; I tell you, every every organization,
[1:36:45] every organization I was just looking at
[1:36:47] looking at a documentary just just uh
[1:36:50] right right here the uh I think it was a
[1:36:52] kind of a 19 30 something documentary uh
[1:36:56] of of New York City. And the thing that
[1:36:58] caught my eyes was you could not find
[1:37:01] one lady
[1:37:03] with trousers on.
[1:37:06] They were not Christians. They were just
[1:37:08] New York City.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; How come it's it's gone from us
[1:37:28] now? When you dress decent as a lady,
[1:37:30] you then you look like, "Oh, wow. Where
[1:37:32] she's coming from?" It looks like she's
[1:37:34] coming. And is is it the thing that will
[1:37:37] intimidate you?
[1:37:39] Don't you realize the grace that God has
[1:37:41] put on you?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; That in such an evil and adulterous age,
[1:37:46] you have the grace and courage to dress
[1:37:47] like a lady.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You must be proud. You must put your
[1:37:51] face up.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] family life was was uh was uh uh was
[1:38:10] cherished. They never had they never had
[1:38:12] I mean people were working for 35 cents
[1:38:16] an hour.
[1:38:18] They just how little but they I mean
[1:38:21] family life was so important. They
[1:38:23] cherish it. They spend time together.
[1:38:25] They they were happy.
[1:38:31] They have they have more children. They
[1:38:33] have more children. They didn't have
[1:38:34] money. They just have many children. But
[1:38:35] they were still happy.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Now we don't want many children. We just
[1:38:39] want one or two. And we get crisis.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; This is a reality.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; What has gone wrong?
[1:38:55] Why can't we see that that that that
[1:38:57] this is a destructive spirit?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to go through the
[1:39:06] emotion of you know sharing our emotion?
[1:39:10] Oh, you know I I like you. Oh, I love
[1:39:12] you. I I mean we we do all of that and
[1:39:15] then when they put us in the house, we
[1:39:17] don't want to be in the house anymore.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be in the house. The
[1:39:22] only thing we want we want is ceremony.
[1:39:24] Everybody come, we mar down, they put us
[1:39:26] in the house. Okay, you live together.
[1:39:28] We don't want it.
[1:39:30] What has gone wrong?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; It must be for them, not for us.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; We have something that can keep us
[1:39:40] together.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; We have something that can settle our
[1:39:44] differences. It's the word of God.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. is the word of God and prayers.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Our commitment to God, our devotion to
[1:39:55] God's word.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm not mad at you again.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:18] Yes. Always say, "Daddy, why are you
[1:40:20] yelling?"
[1:40:23] I said, "I'm not yelling." Amen. So, I'm
[1:40:27] not yelling.
[1:40:29] So, so that that was what I was going to
[1:40:31] go down with you this morning on church
[1:40:33] discipline. We'll pick it off from there
[1:40:35] and uh uh we'll pick it up by God's
[1:40:38] grace and and really get into it, study
[1:40:41] it together and realize that it's for
[1:40:44] our protection.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; It's for our protection.
[1:40:52] If you remember many many many years ago
[1:40:54] or a few years ago not many few years
[1:40:57] ago should be uh maybe two years or
[1:40:59] three years ago I preached on a series
[1:41:01] called the bounding power. And what I
[1:41:03] took was where Jesus said whatever you
[1:41:06] bound on earth I will bound in heaven.
[1:41:08] Whatever you lose on earth I will lose
[1:41:10] in heaven. And brother Brandon somewhere
[1:41:12] said the church is losing its binding
[1:41:14] power.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; We are losing our b. There is something
[1:41:19] that keep us together.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; There is something that keep the church.
[1:41:24] The church as much as the last just few
[1:41:28] time we talked about you know uh uh uh
[1:41:30] trying to go into uh uh uh financial
[1:41:33] contribution to build a church and all
[1:41:35] that that that is beautiful. We pray
[1:41:37] that the Lord will be able to to help us
[1:41:39] to achieve that. But I'm telling you, if
[1:41:42] we don't have what keep the church
[1:41:44] together,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; it will be difficult to achieve that.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Because pretty soon we will come right
[1:41:51] back to Ananas and Sofia. And then and
[1:41:54] then money problem now will be in the
[1:41:56] house between husband and wife. you
[1:41:58] know, we get enough money and and you
[1:42:00] know, it is not we alone that are
[1:42:02] supposed to build a church and and uh
[1:42:04] but if the bounding power is there, if
[1:42:06] we see the value of of the life of
[1:42:09] Christ, we see the value of of of uh of
[1:42:12] of uh uh uh building a memorial and and
[1:42:15] and having a place where we can live
[1:42:18] together as as you know uh brothers and
[1:42:22] sisters and strive and uh uh for
[1:42:25] righteousness and truth. lift up the
[1:42:27] bonnet of Malachi 4 up. Amen.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; If you go back in the book of Exodus,
[1:42:34] you will realize the Bible talks about
[1:42:37] uh uh Moses building the tabernacle and
[1:42:40] how God pulled the spirit of willingness
[1:42:42] upon the people.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of willingness that
[1:42:46] built the tabernacle
[1:42:49] because they were in the wilderness.
[1:42:50] What do they have?
[1:42:53] It's just the things that the Egyptian
[1:42:54] gives them when they were traveling, but
[1:42:56] a spirit of willingness was upon the
[1:42:58] people.
[1:43:00] Praise the Lord. Now, so so you see uh
[1:43:04] uh uh uh and that's what the church
[1:43:07] hates. You study the message, you will
[1:43:09] see how brother Brandon when he use when
[1:43:12] he talks about bonding on earth and
[1:43:14] bonding, he use it more in a prayer
[1:43:17] line,
[1:43:19] challenging Satan
[1:43:21] that the word said wherever we bound on
[1:43:24] earth, so he was bounding, he was using
[1:43:26] the bounding power to keep God's
[1:43:28] children in good health.
[1:43:31] and keep sickness outside.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; The church can use the bounding power to
[1:43:36] keep the word inside and keep sin
[1:43:39] outside.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; That's what the bounding power is ging
[1:43:43] for.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; It's only used on an individual if he
[1:43:54] does not want to reconcile with the word
[1:43:56] or she does not want to reconcile with
[1:43:58] the word. That's that's when that is
[1:44:00] you. Then then the church use that
[1:44:02] authority to keep you outside.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; But it's it was it's not for the people.
[1:44:09] It's for the spirit.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; The bounding power is to keep the devil
[1:44:14] out of our lives, out of our home, out
[1:44:17] of the church.
[1:44:25] Are we together?
[1:44:29] So, uh,
[1:44:34] it's a beautiful thing.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. And, uh, I pray
[1:44:42] that the Lord will be able to help each
[1:44:45] and every one of us. Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; To be able to help each and each and
[1:44:50] every one of us.
[1:44:54] uh many of us we can we can tell our
[1:44:58] testimony how we came to the Lord how
[1:45:00] the grace of God has helped us in in uh
[1:45:02] in many different situation but there we
[1:45:05] have we have children that are being
[1:45:07] born
[1:45:08] have young people that are growing up
[1:45:12] and if there's a tomorrow
[1:45:16] those are the ones that we must strive
[1:45:17] for
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; that God will give us an atmosphere that
[1:45:22] will bring our children to birth. It
[1:45:24] will bring our children to repentance.
[1:45:27] The the the the language I was born in
[1:45:30] the message will not be their language.
[1:45:32] Their language will be I'm born again. I
[1:45:35] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Because born in the message does not
[1:45:38] work.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; It's a deceitful slogan.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; All my children are born in the message.
[1:45:47] So what
[1:45:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; We have a generation a a
[1:46:05] an evil generation a a power that is in
[1:46:08] this age.
[1:46:15] I mean that is just that is just that
[1:46:17] that is just consum consuming the young
[1:46:20] people.
[1:46:25] Young this generation is a is a is a
[1:46:28] addict generation.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Young people are just addicted to
[1:46:33] different things
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; all different form of addiction.
[1:46:44] Science even tell looking at a
[1:46:46] documentary even even they have they
[1:46:48] even did it with even in some of the the
[1:46:50] little babies cartoon and it tells how
[1:46:54] how it works on their brain
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; because of some of the way they they
[1:46:59] they do the things so fast
[1:47:04] trying to get the kids when they are
[1:47:06] eating babies. Is that not what Pharaoh
[1:47:08] said?
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:12] from two years old down killed it.
[1:47:16] And that's the that's what this spirit
[1:47:18] is doing in our age.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You see the church supposed to be the
[1:47:30] place where we come to strengthen one
[1:47:33] another.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; When we bring our prayer request, it
[1:47:37] will not be a joking thing. People will
[1:47:40] get down on their knees and desperate
[1:47:42] and cry to God and say, "Oh, help our
[1:47:44] brother. Lord, help our sister."
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Because we know it's a serious thing out
[1:47:49] there.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Well, if we make the church just a
[1:48:01] social gathering,
[1:48:04] we come whenever time we can come. You
[1:48:06] can't even follow. There is no way you
[1:48:07] can even trace the sequence of what is
[1:48:09] happening in church. What was preached
[1:48:11] last week? How how does it connect to
[1:48:12] what is preached today or what is
[1:48:14] preached on Wednesday night? Let's see
[1:48:16] how the Holy Ghost is dealing. You can't
[1:48:17] even connect that
[1:48:23] because the church is just a place we go
[1:48:25] when we feel like going.
[1:48:38] or not treat our body like that. We we
[1:48:41] put ourself on diet. We wash our food.
[1:48:43] We ate and all of that. But when it
[1:48:45] comes to our soul,
[1:48:47] we just open it up for anything
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; and everything.
[1:48:52] May God give us grace. Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; My hands are up before yours. Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's the time that we have. We
[1:49:02] have a responsibility.
[1:49:05] We have a responsibility. When Jesus
[1:49:07] says, "I will build my church and the
[1:49:09] gates of hell will not uh h
[1:49:13] prevailed against it." The church was
[1:49:16] placed here to represent God on earth.
[1:49:23] That's the reason why Paul was told
[1:49:25] Jesus said, "Why persecute thou me?"
[1:49:30] He never met Jesus. But Jesus said Paul
[1:49:34] saw why persecute thou me?
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; He will come to the understanding that
[1:49:42] he was persecuting Jesus by destroying
[1:49:44] the church.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; He will come to that understanding
[1:49:52] as God will start dealing with him. And
[1:49:55] because of that, when when he got that
[1:49:57] revelation, that thing ate that man up
[1:50:00] so much that Paul did he he he he denied
[1:50:04] himself to get married. The death of
[1:50:07] Stephen and many of the other apostle
[1:50:09] haunted him until he wanted to die for
[1:50:12] the very thing that he was trying to
[1:50:14] destroy.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Say, I'm not afraid to go to Rome. I'm
[1:50:18] ready to give my life. I fight a good
[1:50:21] fight.
[1:50:28] I hope we are we we we we can take that
[1:50:31] courage to be able to give our life for
[1:50:35] the thing that has saved us.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; if it was not because of this message of
[1:50:42] the hour, some of us, we will be
[1:50:44] horrible.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; We will be horrible. We'll be we'll be
[1:50:49] having chains all around every part of
[1:50:51] our body
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; from our toes. Our toes will get r
[1:50:56] ankle bracelet, knee bracelets
[1:51:02] will get pierced all over our body.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; If it was not if it is not because God
[1:51:07] touch our heart.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:15] You
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; better give your life for the thing that
[1:51:17] save you
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; because there's a price to pay.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; There's a price to pay.
[1:51:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this afternoon.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; I just want us to go to go to the Lord
[1:51:32] and pray as we talk about these things.
[1:51:36] We have dealt with spirits. We have
[1:51:38] exposed spirits. I'm not coming against
[1:51:40] no individual. I'm dealing with spirits
[1:51:42] this morning. And I just want us to go
[1:51:44] to the Lord in prayer. Musicians, you
[1:51:46] can come. Let's let's go to the Lord in
[1:51:49] prayer this morning. I don't know about
[1:51:51] you, but my hands are up. I'm saying,
[1:51:53] Lord, help me.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm feeling the pressure. I'm
[1:51:56] feeling the attack of the enemy.
[1:51:59] Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; This means standing in the need of
[1:52:11] prayer. Just lower the volume more. Let
[1:52:15] me let me hear the people singing and
[1:52:17] praying a little bit. Just just keep it
[1:52:19] right in the middle of it.
[1:52:21] It's me in standing in need of prayer.

[2:06:43] how backsliding many of us are
[2:06:47] even to gear into prayer
[2:06:51] to enter into prayer to commune with
[2:06:53] God. We don't even know where to start
[2:06:55] from.
[2:06:58] We are lo we are losing touch. We are
[2:07:02] losing touch with our maker.
[2:07:05] We are losing touch. We are allowing
[2:07:07] things to abuse our hearts and abuse our
[2:07:10] mind
[2:07:19] [Music]
[2:07:22] that an opportunity to speak to God with
[2:07:24] just sitting there. You don't even know
[2:07:25] where to start from.

[2:07:30] the next place you have to go and the
[2:07:32] time and all of that that you cannot
[2:07:34] even enter in.
[2:07:37] You can't we can't even enter in and
[2:07:39] say, "Lord, thank you. Thank you for
[2:07:41] touching my heart. Lord, don't don't
[2:07:43] take your spirit away from me.

[2:08:04] the other.

[2:08:15] church and we and we can't speak to the
[2:08:16] one that we have come to?
[2:08:21] We are not on speaking terms with God.
[2:08:26] We can spend hours on the phone talking
[2:08:28] the thing that concern us and not
[2:08:30] concern us the gossip and everything but
[2:08:33] we can't even spend time to talk to our
[2:08:35] maker.

[2:09:10] my children. Lord, help my loved ones.

[2:09:51] broken heart?
[2:09:55] Where is the broken heart?
[2:09:58] Where are the womens of lamentation?
[2:10:01] Where is the church of lamentation?
[2:10:05] Where the people knows how to just place
[2:10:08] themselves before God and say, "Lord,
[2:10:10] let my tears tell you everything. I
[2:10:13] don't have words. Let my tears say it
[2:10:15] all to you. Where's the church of
[2:10:17] lamentation?
[2:10:26] Our heart has become so hard that no
[2:10:30] matter how God try to squeeze our heart,
[2:10:33] he cannot get a juice out of our eyes.
