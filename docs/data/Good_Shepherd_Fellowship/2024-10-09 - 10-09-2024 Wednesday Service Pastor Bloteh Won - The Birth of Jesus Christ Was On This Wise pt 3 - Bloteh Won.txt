let's just uh turn to the scripture tonight again we say we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus it's good to be in the house of the Lord let's take our Bibles to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 16 tonight we go to Ezekiel chapter 16 tonight and now Ezekiel chapter 16 tonight just like we announced on Sunday uh will be away this weekend for uh even Lighthouse uh special meetings over in ainer so we ask that you keep us in your prayers and uh that the Lord will uh make us a blessing to the Saints there uh if it father and I would love to speak pray praise the Lord Ezekiel chapter 16 I want to read this tonight I want to read this tonight U um I came out of prayer the other day and and I thought about this this verse and and for some reason when I started reading I just couldn't stop and uh I was just I was just so captured to it and uh read it entire chapter but we will not read the entire chapter tonight we will just read from verse one and couple of verses down but let's read together just for uh the reading of the word and we will we will go in the direction we want to go tonight again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man cause Jerusalem to know her Abomination and said thus said the Lord God unto Jerusalem thy birth and thy Nativity is of the land of canna thy father was an Amorite and thy mother was hiti now you have to remember Genesis 15 there it was it was a pagan land before it became Jerusalem so that's what uh Ezekiel is referring to Israel I mean to Jerusalem here that that your birthplace is is the land of Canan but you have to remember your background where you came from and as for your Nativity in the day that in the day thou were born thy neighbor was not caught your umbilical call will stay hanging that's what that's what the prophet is describing here it's talking to Israel now neither was thou watch in water to so thee thou will not salted at all not swording at all none eyes P none eyes P thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou will cast out in the open field to the lofted of that person in the day that thou were born and when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thy own blood now see God describing Jerusalem yeah your birth when you were born you were just like a baby that was cast in the field you were now watched you were stayed you know uh in your your blood your your umbilical core will stay attached and you were cast in the field when I passed by I saw thee polluted in thy own blood I said unto thee when thou were in thy blood live praise the Lord yeah I said unto thee when thou were in thy blood live praise the Lord I saw you in that situation praise the Lord rejected amen left alone when I passed by I saw you and I said leave praise the Lord and again I says live are we together the Lord bless you you can have your seat I continue to read I have caused thee to multiply as the above of the field and thou Hast increase in waing great and thou I come to excellent orament thy breast are faction thine head is grown whereas thou was naked and Beed this child that was left to herself in her own blood that was nobody to take her and wash her off her blood nobody to wrap her in a sweating Club she was left there God describing Jerusalem as a little girl he said but I breathe upon you I prophesy on on you to live and I've have caused you to grow to be a fair and a beautiful young lady I have caused thee to multiply uh uh which is speaking of your growth As Above in the field and that have increased and wax in great th that you have come to an excellent or your breast are fun are faction your head is grown whereas thou will naked and bed now when I pass by thee and look upon thee behold that time was the time of Love which means she have grown up to be a young woman she has grown up to be a teenage girl and she's sensing the season of Love on her praise the Lord are we together behold that time was the time of love and I sprad my skirt over day that's uh that's one that's one of the place I want to d word it tonight so pay attention to that when I pass by thee and look upon thee behold that time that time was the time of love and I spread my skirt over thee and cover thy nakedness yay I SAR unto the and in and entered into a covenant with thee said the Lord God and thou became M praise the Lord when you were just at this young age as a young pray the Virgin girl your time the time of love the season of Love was upon thee I hardly pass when I pass Thee I spread my skirt over thee you remember that's what boas did to Ruth we will get to there I spread my skirt over there it's uh it's it's a it's a sense of protection praise the Lord when Ruth told boa put your skirt over me amen which mean in a sense he took her to himself and because he did that he had to redeem her so God is telling isra I did the same when you were just at that age where you were sensing love and it looks like every Idol and every adulterous nation was about to rush on you praise the Lord I step forth I spread my skirt over you and cover th nakedness and I swear unto they I make a vow unto you and I enter into a covenant with the thus said the Lord God thou became mine then wash I thee with water yeah I torly washed away thy blood from thee and I anoint thee with oil praise the Lord I clothe thee also with uh brother work and and show thee with beggar skin and I and I gather thee about with fine lening and cover thee with self now we can go on and on and on and on you can read the rest of that but tonight uh I want to I want to go in a little Direction here now you right here you will see where Jeremiah I mean Ezekiel is is uh prophesying to Israel now he's saying these things to Israel reminding them where I took you from because if you read the rest of the verse you will see that it was not pleasant what he said to Israel was not pleasant but this this beginning verses that we read was to remind Israel where I took you from and we can apply that to ourself tonight praise the Lord because every man that is born of a woman every natural birth is dcri right here in verse 16 when we are birth forth we come with our our our neighbor called we are all in Blood and we need to be watched we need to be wrapped praise the Lord but we will leave there for a while if I can I want us to step back few verses and uh let's go to verse step by a few chapter let's go to verse chapter uh 14 and get a little background because Israel has gone into so much idolatry that God needed to remind them in such a graphic way he needed to give the prophet such a vision to be able to grab their attention praise the Lord but let's go back and then we read a few verses it will it will help us to be able to grab uh uh uh let's uh chapter 14 Ezekiel chapter 14 let's read from verse 12 praise the Lord and the word of the Lord the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man when the land sinth against me by trespassing grievously then I will stretch out my hand upon it and break the staff off of the bread thereof and I will send farming upon it and I will cut off men and Beast from it praise the Lord amen now you see uh when when when when we see all of these things that is happening around the world the the the the you know the the war breaking out in the Middle East you know uh Russia and Ukraine being going on with their thing and we see uh uh uh people dying with farming and we see uh the corruption of Nations and government and we see uh uh uh the flaw happening you know sometimes uh uh when these things are not near to us praise the lord it's it's it's not so easy for the to come to our mind praise the Lord if it is not near to us we don't read we don't we don't read it on the news or you know or get any information our brain our mind is so limited we are just in our box praise the Lord and we think that well the whole word is just our back our backyard you look through your window you know the grain the grass is green you see the burden and but uh like I said you know I told someone I says this is not a moving this is life praise the lord it's life people lossing everything that they have ever worked for now that's where you appreciate the almighty God praise the Lord amen for you to be standing right in the face in your face and [Applause] everything that you ever live for is gone but yet your life is stay in your body it has to be God it's only God that can help you praise the Lord because it's almost like why am I living for again what Am I Living For are we together but also when you look at it and you think about it you realize that it is the almighty God that gave us the breath of life amen he's the one that gave us the Breath of Life those people in the middle age you can talk about Arabs whatever you want to talk about they don't manufacture their own Breath of Life amen their God don't give them their own whatever they worship whatever they believe praise the Lord is God the same God that shine upon the just and the unjust that pour rain upon the just he's the one that gave every living Soul every living creature life praise the Lord see it in California fire when it when it's time for fire in in other parts of the word Canada in just all parts of the word and what I want to get to tonight in saying that is to say that when God is about to fulfill his word praise the Lord if he's about to bring his word to pass the same God that created everything can and WEP everything away praise the Lord all the millions of people that live in the days of Noah never had another God different from the god of Noah praise the Lord amen but as we read this let's go down a little bit here this is why I want to get your attention son of man when the land sinen against me and trespass grievously then I will stretch out my hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and I will send farming upon it and cut off men and Beast from it God says I will do it though these three men Noah Danel and job were in it they should never they they should deliver but their own soul by their righteousness said the Lord now God is about uh uh uh uh declaring judgment upon Jerusalem because of all the Abomination and all the evil that they have gone they have gone away from God praise the Lord and and and and Y said that he's bringing it in such a way and you will realize that in this in this very chapter God repeat this over and over that if I'm bringing judgment Upon This Land if these three men Noah Daniel and job if these three men were in that City St they will not be able to stop my wrath they will only be able to save themselves by their righteousness praise the Lord let's do on that a little bit before we get into what we want to talk if you really look at it you will see there there is there is similarity about uh uh uh Noah danir and job praise the Lord amen job had a trial in one sense that you can call a judgment that came on a household one man Daniel was one nation Noah was one generation praise the Lord amen there were many famales in the time of job job was the man that God Pi praise the Lord and the Bible says there was not a man like job on the earth and with all the burnt offering he did and all the kindness that he did the scripture job record will tell you that he was so resp Ed that when job got down down the street people went to him for counsel they met job for counsel advice and you know uh instruction that's how much he was so respected but it did not save his sheeps it did not save uh his houses it they not save even his children in one sense praise the Lord amen hallelujah Daniel was one man in the nation praise the Lord that God will bring down to Babylon and through his uh his Earnest praying by that and by night he will bring the entire Babylon to realize that the god of Israel is a living God are we together Noah will be one man in a generation that the Bible was say and God found favor with Noah and God will instruct him to build an ark praise the Lord Hallelujah but you will realize that another thing that is common with this man also the Bible called Noah a preacher of righteousness that his uh uh uh uh uh even though his message could not save the entire generation just like Jonah message saved Nevan but Noah stay faithful to the word he stayed faithful to whatever God because the Bible said for 120 years he kept preaching the same message he never tried to make it to fit the generation of Faith you know the new group that came he he he just stay with what God told him that there's going to be rain Hallelujah and his message uh uh uh uh uh and his stand for God was able to Rob on on on his children and the Bible says only eight Souls the Bible call him the preacher of righteousness and so much that uh and the way I think about the preacher of righteousness is that uh uh when when when when when your life and when your testimony can be able to R against your household sometimes it's the hardest people to convin because they know you when you are angry they know you when you are not happy praise the Lord amen but that's part of all your mistakes when when God can be able to give a Grace word your life can rise up so much to a place that the people can know that you are you are a human you are a man but yet by the grace of God God you are doing your best to live what the word says praise the Lord because there is nothing that destroy the family then for the man to be professing one thing and living another thing praise the Lord amen oh yeah I mean your children are never going to believe you it's hard for them to even believe the preacher it's hard unless God gave them a personal revelation it's hard for them to believe the preacher because the first preacher in their life is the parents at home the Bible says he's a man of righteousness you can also think about it Daniel stand robbed against shedra mishad and abam job stand for the word even though he lost his children but yet they were redeemed for him on the other side praise Lord but yet God is saying if these three men you see when God raised up a man in a generation when God raised up a man in an age when God raised up a man in a family or in a church sometimes we get so used you know because we are friends we are brothers you know uh uh uh uh uh we know where the person was born we know their Liv you know we saw them walking down the street we see when they are broke when they were sick and all of that sometimes it's hard for us to see how God thinks about his people but just watch this pattern here is here is God bringing judgment on uh uh h h h Jerusalem and he's taking three righteous men to say even if they were living in that time to to tell you that God always used that as a Pon let's see another example let's go to the Book of Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 15 praise the Lord Jeremiah chapter 15 I'm just trying to lay a background for what I want to say tonight Jeremiah chapter 15 let's read from verse one then said the Lord unto me this is God speaking to jerem IA though Moses and Samuel stood before me yet yet my mind could not be towards this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth now to Jeremiah the weeping prophet crying because the the the the vision the instruction of the Captivity of the Babylon came to him and yet Jeremiah interceding for the people and God will raise up two Prophet they came right in the time of intercession praise the Lord when you look at the ministry of Moses you look at the ministry of Samuel the Bible says when there was no open Vision every man was doing what was right in their eyes it was in such a time that God raised up a man called Samuel started dealing with him from a young age praise the Lord so Samuel Ministry was was a Ministry of a bridge Samuel Ministry he came right in the time of the bridge the time of the judges where God will now change to move into a a a a ising a king because it was almost about 10 generation after they left uh uh uh Egypt praise the Lord so Samuel Ministry was a Ministry also of of intercession he interceded for the people just like Moses interceded for the people praise the Lord Moses got to a place he said Lord if you will kill this people then you have to you have to first I have to die first let me let me die before before your wrath touch these people but here is God going to take these people into Babylon and he's saying even if Moses and Samuel was here interceding praise the Lord hallelujah sometimes it's hard for us to be able to put certain things into perspective but let me say this to you of all the men and all the prophets that ever went into the ministry of intercession they were all fulfilling Christ you have to remember Jesus wept over Jerusalem he wept over Jerusalem how I will have H you but a state did not stop the wrath of God a state did not stop the wrath of God the Bible says h j Esau came and he wept before Isaac Isaac could not turn he could not turn the coast around he has already giving the blessing to Jacob you see and and I believe that is just such a time that we are getting into we have we have we have heard you know God is a merciful god you know God is a gracious God and and and and you know and and all of this and and and and because of that we we get cheap prayer and cheap sandwiches you know we can just stand there make confession but I'm telling you there are some prayers that cannot be heard even Jesus cried over Jerusalem because he knew how the city was going to be ravaged when the people rejected the word they rejected the gift that was sent to them and they called it Bible praise the Lord God is saying even if you rais Moses and Samuel up to intercede for these people nothing is going to stop them from going into Babylon I have sealed their D now let me read something to you here listen to this from prophet of God I might I don't know if I I will have time to preach what I want to preach but let me just read this to you from the message Jehovah jarro see brother B says a similar thing here listen to this he says we are at the end of the road he says a president e in how in every city in every country in every village in every town in this America will never stop this ons Slaughter going on of cigarette smoking women and drunkers and so forth he's talking about how politics has been corrupted he says take a man like en how order George Washington make them the governor of every city praise the Lord make them uh uh uh you know uh uh uh the president of the US the system is already rotten it has passed Grace praise the Lord put them in every country the corruption of the country will not even allow them to survive no matter how hard they try it's just the same thing that God is saying raise up Moses raise up Samuel let them intercede for these people their wickedness has crossed the border there is so far we can go are we together we are in such a time of judgment so he says here it it couldn't be done in this America will never stop it it uh uh onslaught of going going on of cigarett smoking and and drunkers and so forth it couldn't be done you are going to have your own way there's a time where God just leave the people to themselves he just leave the people to themsel praise the Lord you are a you you are B dozing yourself right into hell that's right and you know that and you are without excuse but before a just God can pour out his judgment upon the people he has to make a way of Escape for everyone who desire to receive it this is your Daye of visitation you might now want to believe it because an uneducated Minister says it but don't pay attention to the messenger pay attention to the message you are hearing praise the Lord amen well he was not a theologian he was not a scholar you know uh I mean the only good thing in his ministry was Divine Healing that's why people will say but slowly slowly let me tell you there are many people that have sat around this message they have played it off they have played Church they have come up with a lot of excuses why they can't believe the message God will allow them to see this word for feeling right before their eyes and there is nothing you can do to change your situ ation because you have gone too far from God nothing you can do you will just see it and argue praise the Lord how many people Rush on the internet when Billy Paul passed away oh California sing hey they say California will sing Oh California all they are trying to do is to just ease Their Fear they are just trying to ease is Their Fear God's word do not fall praise the Lord you might not believe it he says because it's an uneducated Minister saying it to you but don't pay attention to the messenger pay attention to the message because the Messenger will die but the message lives on praise the Lord so you see God the very thing that he did in Jeremiah to warn the people because they have got to such a place they have got to such a place see the people they have they prosper and they went after Prosperity until they they they they they disrespected and disregard the Sabbath that's why God gave them 70 years why because he wanted the land to rest he let he wanted the land to to gain a Sabbath praise the Lord amen sometimes God want your mind to rest sometimes he want your body to rest amen sometimes uh and some I even sometimes all the time he want you to respect his Sabbath are we together okay that's I I was just trying to lay a background for what we read in chapter 16 so if you read from chapter 14 coming on you will see that God God was he he was kind of for preparing the people he was he was telling them the Judgment you know the destruction that is coming on them how they have wasted his Mercy now here in chapter 16 he's telling Israel I found you when you were young when you were young he says your father is an Amorite your mother is a hittite right in Babylon you were born that's why God called Abraham out of right out of Babylon that's where I found you and you were you were you were a child just like a c a child that was born and were cast out you were stayed in your blood and your neighor h h h h your your umbilical call was stay there I I saw you from your Nativity I saw you from your birth it's almost to say I came right at the time you were born because you were you were you were all fresh in your blood Hallelujah there was no one there to wash you there was no one there to wrap you up to keep you warm praise the Lord now listen to this now God he didn't say I took you I wash you up and I wrap you and I says well you can live no he says right in your mess when you were right in your mess I said live praise the Lord amen and because I prophesy life after you or life over you I reach down and I pick you up I was you I dress you I watch you growing up how you multiply like a bob in the field I watch you grow growing up until you came to the place of a young male in a season of love praise the Lord hallelujah love the Lord tonight amen amen amen glory be to God hallelujah now I think I did I did something I I I don't know I don't know what I did here people I thought it was two different um notes that I sent out tonight it looks like I only sent one oh yeah I didn't not send this one sorry this should actually be my note for tonight that was was just that was just my introduction praise the Lord that was just my introduction so if the folks back there can just look down there quickly let's just read this and then I will I will find a place to close here there is something that drw me to this now when we spoke on uh on Sunday we were talking about uh uh you know how God how the Virgin birth you know uh uh uh restored the promise that was given to David that without the Virgin birth there was not going to be a son of David on the throne amen because God has has has cursed jaah because of the wickedness that he have done and the Lord said there will not be a seed of him that will sit on the throne of David so God in his own provision has to remember his promise that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent so what what what I want to do tonight is that is is to be able to show us because if you look into what we we we want to read here you will see where where U uh oh praise the Lord glory be to God now brother B is having a conversation here he's talking about a conversation he's having with some brothers and uh uh uh kind of a paraphrase key key to the door he says someone asked the other V he said brother Brandon would there be any difference between Adam and Eve and their children if they were here today you know uh he's he's uh he out hunting with some brothers and he says they ask him if Adam and Eve was here today will there be any different physically with them brother Bram says yes there will be a difference praise the Lord so he goes on he says uh uh uh uh uh let me let me just go go ahead here this is uh said you mean Eve wouldn't wouldn't be uh uh a woman like her daughter Adam wouldn't be a man like his sons I said in many respect but not in all physical respect he said what will be the difference he said U I said they wouldn't have a neighor they were created they were not born praise the Lord amen every man born of a woman is tached to a neighbor train so brother saying that will be the difference between Adam and his children he does not have a neighbor because he was created he was not born praise the Lord amen now so seeing the description that God gave to Jerusalem where I wanted to bring our mind to is that our connection to the curse when the Bible when David said in sin did my mother conceived me praise the Lord I came to the word speaking lies that neighor strin is our connection to the curse are we together now he he says uh uh they wouldn't have a neighbor they were created right they wasn't attached to nothing Adam and Eve was not attached to anything praise the Lord they were formed right out of the earth and God breath the Breath of Life in them they were not attached to anything but you and myself we are attached to a blood stream praise the Lord amen and whatever we are attached to goes by four generation of some of your ancestors that you did not see I never saw none of my grandparents before I would be thinking about the great grand praise the Lord I didn't know how the look like I didn't know some of the habits and things that they deal with and yet I'm attached to a strain that goes back full generation if God grace does not come on the same there is no way we can be saved if God don't help you there's no way you can change because those things run down your Jin it runs down your blood praise the Lord some of the habits that we struggle with some of the way our mind the way we think some people no matter how you try to make the conversation positive they come from a very deep place of negative so strong that's the bloodline that's the bloodstream that we come from some people from a terrible place of fear terrible place of fear praise the Lord and that person read the scripture all the time the Bible says God has not given us the spirit of fear they says it they quot it God has not given us the spirit of fear but you see it it runs down so much in your bloodline they hate it when they are afraid is they are not trying to make them themselves afraid it's just in their bloodline praise the Lord some people have to practice to say the truth they are coming from such a bloodline of lie that that no this time I have to say the truth praise the Lord it might sound funny praise the Lord I don't know about you I've been there before you tell a lie and you ask yourself but why I even lie why I why I just couldn't tell this person the truth as funny as it signs it's things that you hit in your life but you don't have control over it why because it runs down your bloodstream you got attached to that through a neor stream you don't like it but you don't have control over it and if God don't help you praise the Lord like brother Bram says being the first son of Charlie Branham it had to be God to deliver him from being a drunker being the first son he says all all the Brams die with their boots their on their feet drunk in the water he says I owe it to the Lord even at the time he wanted to prove that he was not accessing he wanted to take a drink and drink it God had to come down supernaturally by a way wi and make him uncomfortable well there some of the things that we deal with and you know what happened we get so lazy we don't pay attention to this things and we just think that well yeah I'm a br I believe the message you know uh uh I never did it in the first place it's all of those things are truth they are God's word for you praise the Lord but what you never did in the first place you have to identify it you have to identify that I'm trapped in this body I'm trapped with this attitud with this nature I'm trapped with this thing I hit it but B go ahead let me just read this thing and close up yeah as long as that bear there on everything that's born in this world shows it's a renegade he brother is trying to say as long as we we have this thing here he says everything that is born with this thing is a renegade it's a sign of rebellion glory be to God we see the importance of the Virgin birth as we go along to begin with a Ser Renegade to begin with he says that's right show there's the difference they will have no neighbor they wasn't connected to any female uh to come here see God created them praise the Lord when the Bible says we are a new creation when the Bible says we are a new creation it's not from from your father and mother it's not from the life it's not a remake a new creation is not a remake God is giving birth to something new but that thing new is going to be in the midst of a Jame that you've been struggling with just like Mary she never had no attachment to she said be it unto me according to your word and what was forming her praise the Lord it did not automatic automatically change her to believe that that's what the Catholic believe that's why the thing that when Mary got conceed immediately she got an IM uh uh iMat birth praise the Lord in particular birth which mean immediately she was ch change and she lost all her sinful nature many of the times that's what we want to believe that when you when you when you are born again H H you receive the Lord you receive no no no no no no no no no that's what make Christian Life is a constant battle it's a constant battle you have to recognize the thing that is running through your bloodstream and then you bring it under the word you got to bring it under that new creation that word that is birthing in you that word that is about to take over your body you got to bring it on the word it's every day every 24 hour you got to be conscious to it you got to be conscious it's a every day 24hour battle When the Thought comes a desire comes that you know no no no no this is coming from my old BL stream buy you come right here I'm going to put a word over you I put a promise over you because I have to possess this land I have to possess this body that's the reason why I said from the beginning we have a bunch of Catholics we have a bunch of Catholics around the message praise the Lord oh I believe the message I believe I believe the message I'm a bride I'm a virgin bride you have a virgin word you have a pure word in you praise the Lord amen but it's not attached it's not it does not have a connection now watch and see what brother Bram was says here how God came down and break the curse and break us from that curse let's go ahead here he says he says uh now I said I want to say something every man in this prison house this body is a prison house you see every man in this prison house who's holy praise the Lord if you have if you have an idea of your ancestors if you have an idea of the generation where your blood string wrongs he said who is Holy every man in this prison house who is Holy who is the one that wasn't born by sex who is the one can help the other praise the Lord if God don't help me I can't help you praise the Lord amen who can help the other no matter what he is beyond sex true through the Holy Blood that was no matter who he is we are all in this same praising he said but God made himself God made himself one of his own creation praise the Lord and he comes Beyond sex through the Holy Blood that was created through the Holy Blood that he created himself and through that blood he redeemed Us Praise the Lord God form himself produced his own bloodline and Exel form himself and then he got connected to our curse to break the curse he formed himself and got into the womb of a young woman and attach himself to our curse praise the Lord that he will be born with a neighbor he will be born in blood he will be born and he will be needing to be rubbed in swording cloth just to be able to release us from our curse he identify himself with our curse praise the Lord the Bible says he knew no sin but he became sin for us he became sin if you trace his bloodline you trace it directly to Elohim but yet he became sin for us he took assistent El body he dropped in it he could sleep he could feel hungry he could weep at the grave of Lazarus but in that blood stream was the life of God in that blood was God's own blood God's own life Hallelujah preci Lord so you see this it's not just it's not just things that uh you know uh uh uh I mean we just we just we just you know raise our hand and get excited all about it you know yeah we we we we get excited because we are grateful we are grateful that one has come into this praison house to set us free he has come into this prison how to open the door and say you all can go free praise the Lord hallelujah he came and identified himself with us to release us from the curse Hallelujah Jehovah s Israel Jerusalem it says I saw you in your blood I saw you in your mess he says and when I look at you I said live praise the Lord amen no matter what curse is running down your bloodring I say live you see that's the reason why as Believers we have to pay attention to what God is doing in our life we have to pay attention to what the grace of God is building and where he's giving us Grace and where we need more grace we don't just don't flip a Bible on our arm and and and take a badge we are message Believers we going in the Rapture and and and I mean that when you get angry it can burn the whole city down where is that coming from from a blustream that you need to keep under the token praise the Lord when you are just called or ask ask a question you you you struggle to say the truth amen you have to say it and then you come back again and say well you know I the thing I say and uh I mean that that's not really the way it happened let me let me tell you the way it happen and even as you are trying to tell the truth you are still lying even as you are trying to say the truth you are still lying why you don't have control over it it might have come down from some kind of a great grandfather that went about telling lies and then that little thing run down your blood strein and Y say you are struggling with it when the prophet of God say you never did it in the first place it's something that ran down from your bloodstream but now you are struggling with it you need to bring it under control you need to realize that this is a lying demon praise the Lord and don't make excuse you know it's in our family you this should be the last bus stop there should be the last bus stop because if you can't take control of it it's a spirit and the lies run down to your children and then they they also start struggling and you're now whipping that little child you let to lie too much when you can't even remember praise the Lord but a word has come a word has come a word has been birth in you the god that said you should live he never left you to yourself to struggle for righteousness and struggle and knee down and cry no he has sent a word he has sent the word if we would just open our heart and say oh God oh God not try to figure it in our mind and reason oh how I do this and what I need to do that no no no no just receive the word just receive the word glory be to God you find find people struggling when they even know that they are wrong their whole conscious is pressuring them down you are wrong every truth in their mind is speaking to them no they had to prove that they are not wrong and then after you finish doing all of that you go home you are just miserable you are just miserable because you realize that you have failed the opportunity you have and you see every time God will allow us to get into the situation to see how much world we need to deal with those things he will allow situation to come around us praise the Lord amen some no matter how much they try to be humble pray will not leave them pray is just hanging on the like butterfly praise the Lord if their name is not mentioned it's a problem if their present is not mention it's a problem praise the Lord it is not just easy to say well it is the Lord the Lord has been good you know the Lord used me to do that you know the Lord used me I I mean I was very humble as very humble but you know as humbly in my heart but God you know God used me it's because it's that's what all in their head when they sit down by themselves all that is on their mind is just themselves they see themselves popping up all over the place me my me I me my me the truth about the matter is not your fault but now that the word has come it's your battle you have to possess it everything that want to exalt itself above the name of Jesus Christ you have to bring it down you have to bring it down now that's the greatest battle ever fought and until they lay our body down we will fight it every day we will fight it praise the Lord time is far spent I should let you go home tonight praise the Lord I should let you go home tonight the Lord bless your effort praise the Lord may the Lord give us Gra ra and and help us as we continue to Fellowship around this praise the Lord hallelujah one of the greatest Victory we will have is when we bring his body subject to the word we worried about raising the dead worried about speaking another word and going to live in it one of the greatest Miracle is when God can help you at a giving moment when the enemy is trying to allow the Bible say he's the prince of the power of the head when he's trying to allow some kind of nature to rise you have to remember this body is not redeemed it's not redeemed praise the lord it's is not redeemed you know when your body will fully be redeemed when you call it from the earth praise the Lord for those that gone before us when they are calling their body from the earth the same way Jesus called Lazarus and said come forth praise the Lord when you call in the body from the earth it's not going to come out with any kind of for sinful nature because you will be in your original position as the word with the creative power and you will call yourself the way you want yourself to be as a Son of God and as a daughter of God but until then we have to fight every blood strein praise the Lord brother Bram talks about family strength I was going to read read there but we don't have time tonight and uh But as God gave us race will continue praise the Lord because we must possess this body you will not enjoy this message you will not enjoy the Holy Ghost until you can bring this body subject to the word praise the Lord that is the joy in serving God when we have our best choice we have our best judgment and when the word of God comes in Simplicity you can say Lord this is not good for me I'm going to take what the word says praise the Lord this thing is just going to just fulfill me for now on Earth but what the word is giving for me is going to be for now and after this life the Lord bless you tonight let's bow our heads and pray think about these things people the hour is upon us and sometimes many times we struggle oh what what I want to know the way of the Lord you know what is the word of God for me to do this and it's all because in our mind there is that human nature that is struggling for dominance there is that human nature that want to control us and the voice of God and the Holy Spirit is calling you to take a walk to walk away from there dear father I pray tonight oh God you help everyone under the sound of my voice I pray that father you will come oh God it's a beautiful thing Lord It's a beautiful thing what was the thought of Mary when she could touch her stomach to know that she was carrying a child but she never slept with a man and father that's that's the feeling that comes Lord when we know that this grace that has come to us this word that is born in our heart it never came to us through a man she could feel the baby kicking she knew that it was not just an imagination she was carrying a child Lord we can see our life change we can see father how you are helping us in certain areas of our life you are taking us Lord from immoral desires we know that this is not something that we have practiced we know that the new birth is real sometimes when we are just so hurt and it's it's it's it's just it's just it's just hard to leave us Lord and we get so bitter Lord and we get Lord God we just f with ourself Lord but when your grace comes on the S and take that burden away from our heart and we can look at [Music] that and just say thank [Music] you and say Lord even if you want me to to go and self that person I can do I can do it 10 times more if you give me the grace it's real but yet in that moment Mary was feeling a a a child in her womb but she had her own desire there are certain food she wanted to eat she was still carrying pains in her body there times she had a headache but yet there was a real the creator of Heaven and Earth has created himself in her womb oh God if you would just make it so real to us Lord not to look at our thoughts not to look at our feelings but let's pay attention to the word that we carry in our heart whenever we feel a move of the word in our heart may we Rejoice Lord whenever it it move us to pray may may we may we be thankful Lord oh God this is a real thing [Music] Lord sometimes we are just caught up in all all the mistakes and all the things that we struggle with in this body that we cannot see what your word is doing in our heart God what your word is doing in our life Lord that word is going to grow to be a Manch child and it's going to possess this body father pray that God you just bless us Lord bless your people people we glorify your name we magnify your name we pray tonight oh God may you go with us Lord when we retire to our bed bring these things back to our mind we thank you Father Lord we pray oh God that you would just bless this weekend Oh god father and uh bless our brother Elijah as he will speak for us this weekend we just want to thank you Father thank you Lord God for all the brothers and sisters oh
