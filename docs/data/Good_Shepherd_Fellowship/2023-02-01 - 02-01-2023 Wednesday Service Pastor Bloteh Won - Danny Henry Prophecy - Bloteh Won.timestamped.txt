[16:09] Lord he didn't do anything special he
[16:12] didn't have any certain chant or special
[16:16] words that he said or anything that he
[16:18] did he just kneeled down at the foot of
[16:20] the cross
[16:21] and as he kneeled at the foot of the
[16:23] cross the story tells us that he just
[16:26] felt his burden become lighter and when
[16:30] he turned around and looked it was gone
[16:32] and he saw a tomb with her the stone was
[16:35] rolled away and he could see the price
[16:37] had been paid and there was nothing he
[16:40] had to do but just surrender father and

[48:05] seat
[48:07] tonight I want to just I want to take
[48:09] her a little thought here
[48:12] praise the Lord
[48:14] I want to take a thought here on uh
[48:18] uh
[48:22] I've been kind of looking at some few
[48:25] things
[48:26] uh
[48:29] I was going to pick up
[48:31] some of the types in Shadow in the in
[48:34] the mauritian devil series that we're
[48:36] playing for Sunday School
[48:39] so uh
[48:41] but something caught my attention
[48:45] as I was looking uh going back looking
[48:49] at the message and and other things
[48:52] and I realized that
[48:55] I want tonight I want to look at Daniel
[48:58] Henry prophecy Diana Henry prophecy that
[49:01] he uh he he uh prophesied over brother
[49:05] Brandon 1961.
[49:08] and actually that prophecy was on
[49:11] February 11 1961.
[49:16] and uh and there were some other few
[49:19] things too that started that started
[49:22] catching my mind on uh looking at uh
[49:27] what is happening in the times and and
[49:30] what has happened through the history of
[49:32] the message and the times that we are
[49:35] living in but for now we we just want to
[49:37] look at that uh Diana Henry prophecy and
[49:41] uh and and be able to
[49:44] take some things from there so
[49:47] brother Branham was preaching over in
[49:49] California uh
[49:52] when when Diana Henry prophesied over
[49:54] him so when he came back to the
[49:56] Tabernacle he was doing Easter he
[49:59] started preaching on the Easter seal so
[50:01] that was the first time he would make
[50:03] mention of Daniel Henry prophecy
[50:08] so I would read I would read a portion
[50:11] there in Easter seal then we would read
[50:13] the word together amen
[50:15] because uh that is also mentioned now uh
[50:18] when we when we look at this a little
[50:20] bit the Lord will bless it in the way
[50:22] that uh uh Affair to speak upon it you
[50:26] will see the importance of why he had to
[50:29] mention it especially in marriage and
[50:32] divorce and and in in some of the
[50:35] messages also that he preached on the
[50:37] wings of a snow white dove over in uh
[50:41] sweeper He also mentioned that when he
[50:43] preached that message also and uh and a
[50:47] few other messages too but let me let me
[50:49] read this so uh he's he's there
[50:53] preaching and he preached such a message
[50:56] and and brother Brahm says he really
[50:59] rebuked the Pentecostal people you have
[51:01] to realize that the Pentecostal blessing
[51:04] fell in in California uh on Azusa Street
[51:08] and to see how the the the church was
[51:12] getting away from from uh the origin of
[51:16] Pentecostal uh faith and uh and now they
[51:20] started bringing in all these
[51:21] theological things so brother Brandon
[51:23] was very hard he he says he preached a
[51:26] very high message he says tear the
[51:29] people down I was listening to him today
[51:31] and then uh he says them right after
[51:35] that this young baptist boy
[51:38] that was in the meeting uh you know he
[51:41] came to Sheikh brother Branham to
[51:43] congratulate him and he says he said to
[51:46] brother Brandon he says man this this
[51:48] message you preach we can stick it at
[51:50] the back of the Bible and make it a 2010
[51:52] chapter of Revelation and as soon as he
[51:55] said that the Holy Spirit fell on him
[51:58] amen you have never spoken in tongues
[52:00] before you don't even know what what
[52:02] actually it was he broke out into
[52:04] speaking in tongues and he spoke
[52:07] actually in the French language
[52:10] he he you know he he prophesied over
[52:13] brother Branham and there were three
[52:15] Witnesses in the in the in the meeting
[52:18] one was a U.N interpreter and another
[52:21] woman from Baton Rouge and and another
[52:23] young man all three of them were in the
[52:26] meeting sitting different places and
[52:28] they caught exactly what he said they
[52:30] wrote wrote it down all three of them
[52:32] brought their their Witnesses and
[52:35] everything match word for word praise
[52:37] the Lord
[52:39] so now brother Brahm is testifying on
[52:41] this because
[52:42] thou Hast chosen the Narrow Path
[52:46] now you see
[52:48] I get that all right
[52:52] there's part of it are done
[52:55] now he's been Earnest now
[52:57] there is part of the prophecy that he
[53:00] understood he knew exactly
[53:03] but there was part of it that he says I
[53:06] don't understand it yet
[53:08] okay and over and over he would say you
[53:12] know as as time goes by uh it will start
[53:15] to come together the picture will start
[53:17] to come together he says that part of it
[53:21] uh there's part of it I've done because
[53:23] thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[53:27] the harder way
[53:30] thou has walked in thine own choosing
[53:36] I can get that all right
[53:39] because he can look at his life look at
[53:43] some of the choices that he made he says
[53:45] I can understand that
[53:48] why the holy spirit will say that I can
[53:51] get that all right see
[53:53] you choose it yourself it was your own
[53:57] choosing
[53:59] praise the Lord
[54:01] Moses made his own choice
[54:05] he didn't have to do it neither did I
[54:09] have to take this path
[54:12] I could have
[54:15] I could have had big buildings out Yanda
[54:18] like some of them has got I could be all
[54:22] across on television
[54:25] but who sponsor me
[54:28] on tearing the very Foundation
[54:32] but one thing
[54:34] I don't have to bow down
[54:37] to anybody's feet but the Lord Jesus
[54:39] Christ
[54:40] that's right
[54:42] I preach what the Bible says
[54:45] I don't have to compromise with with
[54:48] their organization because I don't
[54:51] belong to them
[54:53] I made the choice
[54:56] just like he said up there as I was with
[55:00] Moses so I will be with you
[55:03] praise the Lord
[55:05] and he gave Moses two signs of
[55:09] confirmation to proof and Moses made his
[55:12] own choice
[55:14] see Moses made his own choice
[55:19] so that's easy to understand
[55:21] thou has chosen now let's stand to our
[55:25] feet let's read a portion of the word
[55:27] and then we will continue Hebrew let's
[55:30] go to the book of Hebrew
[55:37] Hebrew chapter 11
[55:41] . now when brother Branham over and over
[55:43] make the emphasis every time he he
[55:46] talked about this prophecy come back to
[55:48] that place now Moses make his own choice
[55:51] I believe he's referring to the
[55:53] scripture we're going to read tonight
[55:54] Hebrew chapter 11 let's read from verse
[55:57] 23.
[56:01] praise the Lord
[56:05] from verse 23 by faith Moses when he was
[56:09] born
[56:10] was hit three months of his parents
[56:14] because they saw he was a proper child
[56:18] and they were not afraid of the king's
[56:22] commitment
[56:24] praise the Lord
[56:26] by faith Moses
[56:28] when he was come to years refused to be
[56:32] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[56:35] choosing rather
[56:37] to suffer Affliction with the people of
[56:40] God
[56:41] it was his choice
[56:44] vento then to enjoy the pleasure of sin
[56:49] for a season
[56:51] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[56:54] riches than the treasure in Egypt for he
[56:59] had respect unto the recompense of the
[57:03] reward let's pray together Heavenly
[57:05] Father Lord Jesus we we just want to
[57:09] reflect the night Lord after speaking
[57:12] our knees to you which of course we are
[57:15] needed people will always be in need
[57:17] Lord father and and dear God so we we
[57:20] just want to look at this portion of
[57:23] your word now father in line oh god with
[57:26] this prophecy that was uh spoken over
[57:29] over a broad branding father God and we
[57:32] just asked a blessing now father bring
[57:34] an inspiration bring something that will
[57:37] encourage us Lord that will strengthen
[57:39] us tonight we gave you the praise we
[57:41] gave you the glory and honor father
[57:43] praise Lord for your namesake and for
[57:47] the sacrifice of your people bless your
[57:49] word tonight oh God and bless this
[57:52] portion of the service in Jesus name
[57:54] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[57:56] your seat
[57:58] now we go back to our reading
[58:04] now so
[58:15] now he continued here because there has
[58:18] chosen the Narrow Path the harder when
[58:22] thou have walked
[58:25] in your own choosing now and then when
[58:28] you look at Hebrew chapter 30 I mean 11
[58:31] year like we said Paul yet is talking
[58:34] about by by faith now so he's
[58:37] associating faith and choice
[58:40] right amen
[58:42] in one sense your your choice the
[58:45] choices we make
[58:47] reflect the faith we have
[58:52] you can claim to have faith in God I
[58:54] believe God I believe God's word
[58:57] but your faith is expressed
[59:01] in the choices you make
[59:05] praise the Lord
[59:07] Hallelujah
[59:10] fed is a choice if we if we want to look
[59:12] at it that way and uh uh so we see here
[59:16] that uh even even Moses parents now the
[59:21] scripture says that the fear not the
[59:25] case commitment
[59:27] they they dare to keep their son they
[59:31] choose to keep him
[59:32] believing that Jehovah will protect him
[59:37] praise the Lord
[59:39] the choice of putting him on the Nile
[59:42] River
[59:45] it was a choice
[59:47] they never knew where the boy was going
[59:50] to end up
[59:53] an expression of faith
[59:56] praise the Lord
[59:59] and it was a high choice
[1:00:03] after three months
[1:00:07] to win a baby out of breastfeeding and
[1:00:11] put him on the night River and and and
[1:00:13] and just and just and just send him out
[1:00:16] with a prayer
[1:00:20] just like putting your your child on the
[1:00:23] on the bus the first day of school
[1:00:27] praise the Lord
[1:00:30] you so nervous
[1:00:31] you are rubbing your hand at the you
[1:00:34] know the little little one is anxious to
[1:00:36] go to school and uh and then you yeah I
[1:00:38] mean you saw you you want to take it in
[1:00:41] by yourself say no I want to get on the
[1:00:42] bus and and all of that but this is a
[1:00:45] three months baby that we are talking
[1:00:46] about
[1:00:48] praise the Lord
[1:00:50] but that was that was uh Moses Parents
[1:00:53] Choice
[1:00:55] they had to make a choice
[1:00:57] and it was not an easy choice
[1:01:01] choosing is not easy
[1:01:04] praise the Lord
[1:01:06] choosing is not easy
[1:01:09] sometimes it's hot so I mean some people
[1:01:11] want to make it easy
[1:01:14] but in most cases it's difficult to make
[1:01:17] a choice
[1:01:20] praise the Lord
[1:01:21] because in in many cases
[1:01:24] there's not
[1:01:27] so many times that two persons sees the
[1:01:30] same thing the same way at the same time
[1:01:32] we might get to see it the same way but
[1:01:35] not at the same time praise the Lord
[1:01:38] so choice is a great thing brother
[1:01:41] Branham will say praise the Lord now so
[1:01:44] here we see that uh uh honor Daniel
[1:01:48] Henry prophecy and and this prophecy is
[1:01:51] actually going to affect brother Brennan
[1:01:54] it's going to affect him in such a way
[1:01:57] that uh is going to make him to stop
[1:02:01] thinking
[1:02:02] you know he's going to start reflecting
[1:02:04] on some of the things that you know the
[1:02:07] choices the the move that he have made
[1:02:09] the decision he have made and is is is
[1:02:12] actually in one sense it was more of an
[1:02:15] encouragement to him but yet it had him
[1:02:17] thinking
[1:02:18] because as he goes alone and and and
[1:02:21] keep talking about uh the prophecy he's
[1:02:24] seen uh understanding some and yet he's
[1:02:27] saying I don't know how this other one
[1:02:29] is connected to the whole thing praise
[1:02:31] the Lord
[1:02:32] because of
[1:02:34] that choosing because they all have
[1:02:36] chosen the Narrow Path the heart away
[1:02:39] thou has walked in your own choosing
[1:02:42] noun he says now this man now watch how
[1:02:45] he how he wrote it you can see the
[1:02:49] foreign words and now he he gets down
[1:02:51] here he says Thou Hast picked the
[1:02:54] correct and precise decision and it is
[1:02:58] my way he said bless God is my way amen
[1:03:02] God is you know affirming that that is
[1:03:04] his way because of this uh momentous
[1:03:09] decision a huge portion of heaven and
[1:03:12] with thee now he says that uh he had
[1:03:17] never heard about the vision now brother
[1:03:20] Branham has just also had a vision
[1:03:23] behind the curtain of time
[1:03:26] he had just had it
[1:03:28] in that same year of 1961 he he just
[1:03:33] preached a message few times uh on uh on
[1:03:36] the beyond the cartoon of time talking
[1:03:38] about the vision
[1:03:40] and Yara said that this uh uh uh about
[1:03:43] this board I don't know anything maybe
[1:03:46] it was his first time there in brother
[1:03:48] Branham uh meetings you know he's now
[1:03:51] confirming these things a huge portion
[1:03:53] of heaven so brother Branham is now
[1:03:55] tying that part you know could this be
[1:03:57] what I saw in the vision
[1:04:00] behind the cartoon of time praise the
[1:04:03] Lord he never he had never heard about
[1:04:06] about the vision you see
[1:04:09] or of this you remember the vision a
[1:04:12] huge portion of Heaven away thee what a
[1:04:15] glorious decision there has made
[1:04:19] this in itself now here
[1:04:22] from year on I don't understand he said
[1:04:25] from this side I don't understand how
[1:04:27] the whole thing is connecting to this
[1:04:30] this inner self
[1:04:33] in that big parenthesis around it which
[1:04:36] will give and may come to pass the
[1:04:39] tremendous victory in the law of divine
[1:04:41] I don't know what that means
[1:04:45] this will make come to pass perhaps a
[1:04:48] little ten one of these days sitting
[1:04:51] back Yonder
[1:04:53] he will make it noon so you see brother
[1:04:56] band is now looking for God to make him
[1:04:58] to understand that part of the vision
[1:05:01] praise the Lord amen so you see the
[1:05:04] prophet follow and understand God
[1:05:07] dealing with him in a Progressive Way
[1:05:11] praise the Lord in a Progressive Way
[1:05:16] why not because we had to do it not
[1:05:20] because that is just an easy way
[1:05:24] you can you can be popular you did have
[1:05:27] everybody patting you on the back money
[1:05:30] flooring in from from from every word
[1:05:33] for a radio television and so forth now
[1:05:36] he's you know talking about the choice
[1:05:38] that he made they said uh they will take
[1:05:41] it and and televise it I don't believe
[1:05:44] in taking God's thing and putting them
[1:05:47] out on such vulgar stuff of the word I
[1:05:51] don't believe
[1:05:53] in all that hoping up and making
[1:05:56] something they are asking I believe in
[1:05:59] just letting it alone praise the Lord
[1:06:01] now this is 1961 but you'll realize that
[1:06:05] uh uh down in 1963 1964 brother
[1:06:08] Peregrine I already started setting up
[1:06:11] uh what will have been the television
[1:06:13] program for brother Branham so uh but
[1:06:16] but he just he just expressing that here
[1:06:19] he's expressing here to make us to
[1:06:22] understand the other it was actually a
[1:06:26] hard choice
[1:06:27] a difficult Choice Birmingham talks
[1:06:30] about his experience going over to uh uh
[1:06:34] over our University and seeing uh you
[1:06:38] know he says man what that young boy
[1:06:40] could do you know that young man from
[1:06:42] Oklahoma
[1:06:43] would call him he says man I was really
[1:06:47] proud of what uh Aura could do he went
[1:06:50] down there to Tommy Osmond place and he
[1:06:53] says all of these boys are spring out of
[1:06:55] my Ministry and God bless and then being
[1:06:57] him on his day he's thinking in his mind
[1:07:01] so maybe maybe I've not had the
[1:07:04] character for God to trust me
[1:07:07] you know with with all of these big
[1:07:09] things
[1:07:10] praise the Lord
[1:07:11] and right there the Holy Spirit came
[1:07:13] down and the Lord spoke to him and said
[1:07:15] I'm your portion
[1:07:19] praise the Lord amen I'm your portion uh
[1:07:23] it's it's in the place that we have to
[1:07:26] understand you know uh the faith that we
[1:07:30] have believed I mean the the choice that
[1:07:32] we make even to be here tonight the
[1:07:35] choice you make to be in Savvy the
[1:07:37] choice you made to live a Christian Life
[1:07:40] praise the Lord
[1:07:42] amen is not something that you must you
[1:07:48] must overlook
[1:07:51] because that's your life
[1:07:54] coming to service Wednesday night coming
[1:07:56] to service on Sunday you know uh putting
[1:08:00] in time for devotion and the different
[1:08:02] things that you do it's your life
[1:08:06] it's your everyday life
[1:08:09] your lifespan on Earth year
[1:08:12] a big part of this is all part of it
[1:08:16] that's the reason why the the the the
[1:08:18] choices that we make we must realize it
[1:08:22] is very important
[1:08:24] we have people there to encourage us we
[1:08:27] have parents there to guide us but at a
[1:08:30] certain point of time we will have to
[1:08:32] make certain choices
[1:08:37] praise the Lord
[1:08:51] brother bam says I don't believe in all
[1:08:53] of that okay he says I believe in just
[1:08:55] letting the God he says he's God let him
[1:08:58] do with it uh what he won
[1:09:02] we are servants just save the Lord just
[1:09:06] do us God said amen
[1:09:10] in the midst of all of it though
[1:09:15] is forced to make a decision they were
[1:09:17] forced to make a decision that he was
[1:09:19] talking on making decision before he
[1:09:21] came to this place right here on on
[1:09:24] talking about this Vision now he takes
[1:09:27] takes the very same top dead in uh in
[1:09:30] another message he preached but it was
[1:09:32] not so from the beginning because thou
[1:09:34] has chosen the narrow
[1:09:38] path
[1:09:40] they had a way thou has walked in their
[1:09:44] own choosing
[1:09:46] I can understand that Moses walk in his
[1:09:49] in his own tomb
[1:09:51] and not only Moses
[1:09:55] David walked in his own children
[1:09:59] praise the Lord
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:03] I mean he was he was the youngest of the
[1:10:06] brothers
[1:10:07] but I mean to be out there taking care
[1:10:10] of the sheep it is something that he had
[1:10:14] to I believe make a choice fall in love
[1:10:17] with even if it was given to him as a
[1:10:20] responsibility
[1:10:21] for him to grow to the place where he
[1:10:25] will grow a a courage to be able to
[1:10:29] fight if he didn't like it well the bear
[1:10:31] take one there are many years let that
[1:10:32] one go I'll take care of this one
[1:10:34] praise the Lord
[1:10:36] but to make the choice to take a
[1:10:38] slingshot and go and get a uh uh alarm
[1:10:42] from a lion or a bed that is a choice
[1:10:48] he can Wing his shoulder and don't care
[1:10:53] and because of that choice that he make
[1:10:57] of protecting his every father
[1:11:01] Chiefs
[1:11:04] God bless him
[1:11:07] and God positioned him to be a king
[1:11:14] praise the Lord
[1:11:22] because just like Paul espressive we
[1:11:26] read he says esteeming the reproach of
[1:11:30] Christ the greater riches than the
[1:11:31] treasure in Egypt for he has respect
[1:11:34] unto the recompense of the reward he
[1:11:37] knew there was there was going to be a
[1:11:38] reward
[1:11:39] I was going to come
[1:11:43] he didn't know
[1:11:45] his mom was a Sunday school teacher
[1:11:48] she was his nanny
[1:11:52] and she took her talk that Tender Heart
[1:11:54] of Moses
[1:11:58] and find a way to be able to steal and
[1:12:00] and install into him that he was a
[1:12:03] Hebrew that he was born under a sign
[1:12:07] praise the Lord
[1:12:09] all those Bible stories
[1:12:13] they make the time to be able to build
[1:12:16] courage and character in him that when
[1:12:18] he came to age he could make a choice to
[1:12:22] identify himself with the word
[1:12:30] praise the Lord
[1:12:32] now so if you bring it over now to uh to
[1:12:36] uh uh our our Sunday school tape you
[1:12:39] realize that brother Branham going over
[1:12:42] this vision
[1:12:44] is trying to make us to realize that
[1:12:47] coming to preach the subject marriage
[1:12:49] and divorce it's a hard thing
[1:12:52] which of course he said on tape
[1:12:57] I have good friends here people that
[1:12:59] have supported me people that will give
[1:13:01] their life for me
[1:13:04] you call out his son
[1:13:07] so it was a hard thing
[1:13:11] so that's what he's sleeping this vision
[1:13:14] aim for us to understand but it is it is
[1:13:18] his choice
[1:13:21] for him to go on the mountain and wait
[1:13:24] on God
[1:13:25] to be able to bring us a word to be able
[1:13:28] to bring us a pardon
[1:13:39] are we together
[1:13:43] on certain sign he says now I understand
[1:13:46] that Moses had to walk in his own
[1:13:49] choosing
[1:13:51] he didn't have to do it he made a
[1:13:54] decision that was my decision to stay
[1:13:58] with the world regardless of what is
[1:14:02] done
[1:14:05] praise the Lord
[1:14:09] I mean to have the the the kind of a
[1:14:13] gift that you know that he was born with
[1:14:23] it was just something that uh I mean he
[1:14:27] prayed for kings and and great men uh
[1:14:29] next week Wednesday I want to take up
[1:14:32] one again
[1:14:34] and uh and and the reason why I'm doing
[1:14:37] this I will let you know as as we go
[1:14:40] along power does brother Branham says
[1:14:42] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:14:44] the hard way
[1:14:47] thou has there has made their
[1:14:51] has walked in your own choosing
[1:14:55] in other words now you see that's that's
[1:14:57] the place where it is you know people
[1:14:59] people have confidence in you as as
[1:15:02] their Pastor they have confidence in you
[1:15:04] as a brother as a sister but sometimes
[1:15:06] you know brother Brandon said you know
[1:15:09] what it's just there that uh uh like
[1:15:12] what uh saw that you know he wanted to
[1:15:15] identify himself with the with the
[1:15:18] prophet
[1:15:20] Samir now he knew that he he have
[1:15:24] already he have already broke the
[1:15:25] Commandments of God he did what the
[1:15:27] prophet Samuel to him not to do he
[1:15:30] started losing the favor of God and and
[1:15:32] God was not dealing with him like the
[1:15:34] way that God should deal with him and he
[1:15:36] all he also started losing you know the
[1:15:39] the authority over the people so what he
[1:15:42] did is that he tried to associate
[1:15:45] himself
[1:15:46] with the prophet
[1:15:49] amen he says me and the prophet Samuel
[1:15:52] who are on me and the prophet saw me
[1:15:55] aside
[1:15:57] praise the Lord you know that resonate
[1:15:59] with us
[1:16:01] praise the Lord I mean even if it is
[1:16:03] scripture or not as long as we can talk
[1:16:05] brother Branham name to it we get the
[1:16:07] people attention
[1:16:08] the people get excited
[1:16:16] so sometimes it's also like that
[1:16:19] we want for uh you know our choice is to
[1:16:23] be a frame or confirmed by somebody
[1:16:25] about doing the right thing
[1:16:29] but you see sometimes it is that place
[1:16:31] where God brings you he wanted to be you
[1:16:35] and him
[1:16:37] praise the Lord it is you and him
[1:16:40] dealing
[1:16:43] it is you surrounding your heart and
[1:16:46] surrounding your will to God and say
[1:16:48] Lord not my will but your will help me
[1:16:51] do it to do this
[1:16:53] I'm going to step out by faith to do it
[1:16:58] and I will also say even if I fail
[1:17:03] because most of the time there is the
[1:17:06] fear of failure
[1:17:09] the fear of failure Rob us
[1:17:12] of faith
[1:17:16] because we are afraid to fail
[1:17:19] we we we return to stock uh uh uh
[1:17:22] thinking of what would people think
[1:17:26] and pretty soon we lost sight of what
[1:17:28] will God think
[1:17:32] even if I feel he would bring me out if
[1:17:35] I trust him
[1:17:44] praise the Lord
[1:17:46] if I trust him
[1:17:48] I mean not not not doing something like
[1:17:50] Balaam
[1:17:52] not doing something when you know that
[1:17:54] the word of God condemn it
[1:17:56] you've just been stubborn
[1:18:00] you're just putting yourself on a
[1:18:01] country on a wrong Spirit the evil
[1:18:04] spirit
[1:18:06] when the word condemneth leave it
[1:18:14] leave it because all you would do is
[1:18:16] that you would just build up regret for
[1:18:18] yourself
[1:18:20] you'll just build up regret
[1:18:27] praise the Lord
[1:18:29] but when you know that it's the right
[1:18:32] thing to do
[1:18:38] praise the Lord
[1:18:40] and I believe that we are we are we are
[1:18:44] coming to this place
[1:18:46] where we will have to make some some
[1:18:48] strong choices
[1:18:50] to stand for what is right
[1:18:56] praise the Lord
[1:19:01] because more and more the popular
[1:19:04] opinion is is beginning to influence the
[1:19:07] dead and age that we are living in
[1:19:12] and what people would call decent uh you
[1:19:14] know like the prophet uh Isaiah said
[1:19:17] they were called good
[1:19:19] uh evil and evil guilt
[1:19:23] but because the popular opinion says it
[1:19:26] is okay everybody says it's okay
[1:19:30] praise the Lord
[1:19:33] and then what do you think about it
[1:19:37] I don't know
[1:19:39] praise the Lord you don't know which
[1:19:42] side to stand on
[1:19:46] because you don't have it in you to take
[1:19:49] God at his word
[1:19:59] praise the Lord
[1:20:05] when he fell
[1:20:09] there was a carriers in the Garden of
[1:20:11] Eden
[1:20:12] the first time chaos will be seen even
[1:20:14] the animals were confused they didn't
[1:20:16] know what happened
[1:20:19] Adam was trying to get himself get
[1:20:22] himself back home
[1:20:25] and when he got home he met Eve there
[1:20:29] praise the Lord
[1:20:33] it was also a hard choosing
[1:20:40] praise the Lord for Eve to tell Adam the
[1:20:44] serpent beguiled me
[1:20:47] praise the Lord
[1:20:50] have you done what God said we shouldn't
[1:20:52] do
[1:20:54] he says she said is this happen
[1:20:58] now it was his choosing
[1:21:04] for him to take his wife
[1:21:08] but it was a hard choosing
[1:21:13] it was a hard choosing
[1:21:19] praise the Lord
[1:21:21] to assure that even God's choice
[1:21:25] for you and myself to choose you as a as
[1:21:28] a seed of God in in this age
[1:21:32] it was a hard choosing
[1:21:35] you say brother one how could it be hard
[1:21:37] for God Calvary shows that it was hard
[1:21:40] because he had to come and pay the price
[1:21:45] he chose you
[1:21:46] and you were born in sin
[1:21:49] for him to have what he choose he had to
[1:21:51] pay the price so Joyce is always a I
[1:21:54] think
[1:22:02] praise the Lord
[1:22:08] so it always depends on who's
[1:22:11] influencing our choices
[1:22:14] the choices we make to do the things
[1:22:16] that we are doing
[1:22:19] the choices that is influenced in our
[1:22:22] life
[1:22:26] young people you have to come to that
[1:22:28] place of personal conviction
[1:22:33] and make sure that you bring it back to
[1:22:35] the word no don't don't don't do it
[1:22:37] because of your stubbornness
[1:22:40] that I just want to do it why you want
[1:22:41] to do I just want to do it I just feel
[1:22:44] like I should do it
[1:22:48] there's no no Bible verse say just
[1:22:52] just do it because you want to do it
[1:22:56] you must pray about it
[1:23:00] you must think about it where will this
[1:23:02] thing lead me to
[1:23:04] what benefit am I getting from it
[1:23:11] praise the Lord
[1:23:15] choice is a great thing
[1:23:23] praise the Lord
[1:23:24] now brother Branham would tell us
[1:23:27] when we go back there to Heap uh
[1:23:30] Ephesians chapter one he will tell us
[1:23:33] that uh uh uh that's word the mystery of
[1:23:39] internal security age
[1:23:42] is that God choose us
[1:23:49] praise the Lord
[1:23:50] he had to make a choice
[1:23:58] is all tied into internal security
[1:24:01] and the prophet of God said he had to
[1:24:03] predestinate
[1:24:11] he choose the age that we were coming
[1:24:14] he choose the parents that we will be
[1:24:17] born you choose the part of the word
[1:24:18] that we will be born in
[1:24:20] he made all of those choosing
[1:24:23] and then he sealed on the predestination
[1:24:32] so that's what Jesus could make that
[1:24:34] statement all that the father had given
[1:24:36] me will come and I will now lost one
[1:24:44] because the father make a choice
[1:24:47] and when he make that choice he sealed
[1:24:50] the choice
[1:24:52] he protected his choice
[1:24:58] is a great thing
[1:25:06] so the choices now you see that you know
[1:25:08] you you we think about choices you know
[1:25:11] the you know our mind flies all over the
[1:25:14] place
[1:25:17] because I mean uh I mean when we wake up
[1:25:21] in the morning I mean it's right from uh
[1:25:23] getting all out of bed and whatever is a
[1:25:26] choice
[1:25:28] he could choose to roll over
[1:25:32] praise the Lord
[1:25:36] you could choose to pull your pillow
[1:25:39] tight
[1:25:42] choose to switch the alarm off
[1:25:46] so right when our eyes comes open
[1:25:48] choices
[1:25:52] We Begin our day with choices
[1:25:56] the choice of waking up and lifting your
[1:25:58] hands and say oh God thank you
[1:26:02] praise the Lord
[1:26:08] it's a choice
[1:26:10] even it's a choice to break your sleep
[1:26:12] in the night
[1:26:14] and and slip away and just have a little
[1:26:17] meditation time and just and just take
[1:26:19] something on your heart
[1:26:22] just take something on your heart it's a
[1:26:24] choice
[1:26:25] that you have to make
[1:26:32] and God reward those choices
[1:26:38] he reward him
[1:26:48] praise the Lord
[1:26:55] every step of the way
[1:27:00] as we go
[1:27:03] down the road you have many lanes you
[1:27:06] have many roads to take you make a
[1:27:08] choice
[1:27:09] think about the traffic and say well I
[1:27:11] think traffic would be yeah let me make
[1:27:12] a choice and go
[1:27:14] this way
[1:27:16] but you see there is one thing
[1:27:18] that is setting
[1:27:22] in this
[1:27:24] and I hope I hope to share with you when
[1:27:26] I bring bring this thought another time
[1:27:29] you know brother Brown talks about how
[1:27:37] making that choice
[1:27:41] of having the Lord to be the Lord of our
[1:27:44] life
[1:27:45] it helps to influence
[1:27:49] all the choices
[1:27:51] that we make
[1:27:54] when we surround our life to him
[1:27:58] praise the Lord
[1:28:02] it helps to influence
[1:28:06] the choices that we make
[1:28:10] praise the Lord
[1:28:12] it gave us the courage
[1:28:17] when we are making our choices
[1:28:19] because we know in in whom we believe
[1:28:26] praise the Lord
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] we know he will be there to help us we
[1:28:31] know he will guide us
[1:28:37] so I want us to look at this
[1:28:41] and uh uh most specialized we look at
[1:28:45] you know uh that marriage and divorce
[1:28:48] tape and and and and and and when when
[1:28:50] you when you when we understand it from
[1:28:53] the place of
[1:28:57] someone standing in a place of doing
[1:28:59] something
[1:29:01] that seems difficult
[1:29:05] praise the Lord
[1:29:09] it's almost like God telling Abraham
[1:29:13] a need
[1:29:15] Isaac
[1:29:20] take him up off the mountain
[1:29:24] and sacrifice him to me
[1:29:27] praise the Lord
[1:29:31] it was a choice that Abraham had to make
[1:29:35] praise the Lord
[1:29:37] and not knowing what the outcome will be
[1:29:40] you know the story is written for us we
[1:29:43] can read it and because we know the end
[1:29:46] from the beginning so we can be so
[1:29:47] revelated but it was not that way for
[1:29:50] Abraham
[1:29:51] he did not know what the outcome will be
[1:29:55] he just spoke things out of faith and by
[1:29:57] by choice
[1:29:59] he never even told Sarah that God said I
[1:30:03] should sacrifice this boy
[1:30:05] there was a choice that he had to make
[1:30:09] he came back from the mountain I believe
[1:30:12] before he even told Sarah
[1:30:16] which of course that was a smart choice
[1:30:21] that was a wise choice Father Abraham
[1:30:24] praise the Lord
[1:30:26] but you see it was a choice
[1:30:31] the scripture make us to know that he
[1:30:34] believed that God will resurrect his son
[1:30:36] from the dead how
[1:30:41] he believed that God will raise him up
[1:30:44] but God never even allowed him to kill
[1:30:46] him
[1:30:51] but he had to make that choice
[1:30:59] praise the Lord
[1:31:05] we choose him to be the Lord of our life
[1:31:10] not just part of our life our entire
[1:31:13] life
[1:31:14] our family
[1:31:16] our health
[1:31:19] our mind and everything our finances
[1:31:24] praise the Lord
[1:31:29] we have to throw everything in
[1:31:31] amen
[1:31:34] I was listening to
[1:31:36] Easter seal while we were driving to
[1:31:39] church and brother Branham after the the
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:46] the message you got into a little prayer
[1:31:48] line in the Tabernacle
[1:31:51] and you started expressing
[1:31:54] you know making decision
[1:31:57] and things and he says
[1:32:01] talking about a prayer line he says he
[1:32:03] said he says I'm not the one I'm not the
[1:32:05] one I'm not the one that healed your
[1:32:07] sickness
[1:32:08] he says I just
[1:32:10] I just learned him my body to use
[1:32:16] praise the Lord
[1:32:18] and is also a choice
[1:32:23] praise the Lord
[1:32:25] he says I just learned him my body to
[1:32:27] use
[1:32:30] he says and you can do the same also
[1:32:39] musicians you can come
[1:32:48] and as Masha was a comfort to brother
[1:32:50] Branham
[1:32:53] realizing that God comes back and then
[1:32:56] he he see all of that and and
[1:33:00] uh
[1:33:03] and everything
[1:33:11] I mean some of the tough life born in
[1:33:13] the family that he was born
[1:33:15] I believe that was God's choice for him
[1:33:18] praise the Lord
[1:33:21] see the Apostle Paul
[1:33:25] where Brahms is because of him
[1:33:31] not not only that
[1:33:34] he just couldn't get over the guilt I
[1:33:36] believe Paul there with that
[1:33:38] he knew that God was gracious he knew
[1:33:41] that God forgave him for what he did to
[1:33:43] Stony Stephen
[1:33:45] but he made a choice
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:49] that because he took a life
[1:33:54] he was also going to give his life for
[1:33:56] this gospel that's the reason why when
[1:33:58] Philip daughter prophesied over him and
[1:34:01] told him there was chains bound is
[1:34:03] waiting for you
[1:34:05] Paul was ready to give himself to Aid
[1:34:12] we make choices every day
[1:34:15] we make choices with our time
[1:34:18] we make choices it's very important
[1:34:24] [Music]
[1:34:27] that's why our house together tonight
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:38] brother Branham High the the grace and I
[1:34:41] believe that God wanted to comfort his
[1:34:44] prophet
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:47] coming away from a meeting like that
[1:34:52] Carl Williams and all those big
[1:34:54] Pentecostal boys
[1:34:56] [Music]
[1:35:05] prophet of God was preaching one time
[1:35:07] and
[1:35:08] the man told him brother Brown and why
[1:35:10] you always just tear the people
[1:35:13] say you know the people respect you as a
[1:35:15] prophet you know they love you
[1:35:18] but it is almost like you you just you
[1:35:21] just you just tear them all the time
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:26] praise the Lord
[1:35:30] brother brand of me in the message
[1:35:31] Masterpiece he said
[1:35:34] he asked the man you know Beethoven that
[1:35:37] great songwriter
[1:35:39] he says that I believe that he spent
[1:35:43] many night up tearing papers
[1:35:46] to get the right inspiration
[1:35:49] he had a whole trash fort
[1:35:52] [Music]
[1:35:57] he had a painful of paper that he told
[1:35:59] every time he wrote
[1:36:03] oh no it's not a heater he put it in the
[1:36:05] beanies but Branham says that's that's
[1:36:07] the same thing that God is doing to us
[1:36:10] when he take us through the things that
[1:36:12] he take us through
[1:36:16] we are making choices to try to trust
[1:36:19] him we are making choices to serve him
[1:36:24] believing him for our family believing
[1:36:27] him for our children
[1:36:30] believing him that he will bless our
[1:36:32] home believing that he would take care
[1:36:34] of our needs
[1:36:37] and sometimes things happen and
[1:36:39] sometimes uh uh we feel a little bit
[1:36:43] disappointed when it's just not on time
[1:36:46] when it's not happening the way we
[1:36:48] expect
[1:36:49] and our mind and our hearts get broken a
[1:36:52] little bit
[1:36:53] foreign
[1:36:56] [Music]
[1:37:09] to make something better out of you
[1:37:14] so as we close this prayer meeting
[1:37:16] tonight
[1:37:18] while the musicians softly play
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:27] that we just recommit our choices to God
[1:37:32] foreign
[1:37:34] to realize that the choices we make
[1:37:39] express our faith
[1:37:43] we can talk about great faith we can
[1:37:45] think about raising the Dead
[1:37:49] but the choices we make every day
[1:37:56] I mean even as a church
[1:37:59] to keep this body together
[1:38:05] the technicians have to make choices to
[1:38:08] be here the musicians have to make
[1:38:10] choices to be here
[1:38:13] like brother Branham said they don't
[1:38:15] have to do it
[1:38:17] they don't have to do it
[1:38:19] this church do not pay them to do it
[1:38:22] but it's a choice that they make
[1:38:25] to come and save us whether we are here
[1:38:27] whether we are at home they make their
[1:38:29] choices
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:42] let's think about it
[1:38:46] foreign
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:15] and that's another group of people that
[1:39:18] wonder how it happened
[1:39:20] foreign
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:31] you can make choices
[1:39:34] not to just sit back and watch
[1:39:39] because you have to know that the
[1:39:40] prophet of God says
[1:39:43] God is what he's waiting on you
[1:39:55] foreign
[1:39:59] let's pray together tonight
[1:40:06] No Doubt
[1:40:11] by God's grace we have made a tremendous
[1:40:14] decision to give our heart to the Lord
[1:40:19] if we have given our heart to the Lord
[1:40:21] if we have accepted him as our Lord and
[1:40:23] savior that was a tremendous decision
[1:40:28] we are safe
[1:40:38] but yeah there are other choices we can
[1:40:40] make
[1:40:53] even keeping our homes
[1:40:58] under the atmosphere of the word that is
[1:41:01] choices
[1:41:03] foreign

[1:41:46] you know what it meant to him and every
[1:41:49] time brother Branham was going to take a
[1:41:51] tough subject
[1:41:54] he reflected back to it
[1:42:01] Lord he had Danny Henry to meet him here
[1:42:06] but one of these days so God father when
[1:42:09] this Mortal life is over
[1:42:13] or when we cross this side oh God
[1:42:17] of Eternity
[1:42:19] and get into your presence Lord father
[1:42:23] no doubt to God I believe
[1:42:26] you would take us by the hand and says
[1:42:28] you made a choice
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:39] we might not have someone to prophesy
[1:42:42] over our just like Danny Henry did to
[1:42:44] Brother Brad him
[1:42:49] but father what would it be Lord God to
[1:42:52] look in your face
[1:42:55] said you make a choice and the choice
[1:42:57] that you may influence the life of
[1:43:00] somebody that choice was a blessing to
[1:43:02] this one the choice you made to do is
[1:43:05] the choice you made to stand for days
[1:43:07] stand for godliness and stand for
[1:43:09] righteousness the choice you make as a
[1:43:11] Young Man
[1:43:13] get away from the foolishness of this
[1:43:15] word and get serious with God and and
[1:43:19] make some commitment and really get down
[1:43:21] to have an inner experience with God
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:41] dear father
[1:43:44] foreign
[1:43:48] there is no Simple Choice Lord
[1:43:53] there is no Simple Choice there is no
[1:43:56] easy choice
[1:44:00] when we realize Lord the choices we make
[1:44:03] we have great great impact on our life
[1:44:09] the choices we make to start our morning
[1:44:13] sometimes we like to get the best rest
[1:44:16] for us the guests trained to be able to
[1:44:19] face the day Lord let it be a conscious
[1:44:22] Choice there should not be religiously
[1:44:25] driven to God
[1:44:26] or a fear of going to hell
[1:44:34] the choices we make to spend our time
[1:44:39] the choices we make to be in the house
[1:44:41] of God
[1:44:43] how much Lord father
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:50] Lord choices I make and I believe some
[1:44:53] had to work around their work schedule
[1:44:55] father Lord to make sure to be in church
[1:44:58] just to keep a body in this building
[1:45:01] some have to sacrifice right from work
[1:45:08] some work around their working schedule
[1:45:17] some will take the Wednesday off some
[1:45:19] will have to work at night leave the
[1:45:21] church and go directly to work some of
[1:45:24] god father even on Sunday Lord It's a
[1:45:28] choice

[1:45:54] a high choice
[1:46:03] foreign
[1:46:06] people perfecting their music at home
