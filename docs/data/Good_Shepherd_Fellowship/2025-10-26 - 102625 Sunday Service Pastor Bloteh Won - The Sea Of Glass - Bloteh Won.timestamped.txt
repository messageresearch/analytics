[1:15] Praise the Lord. Good to be in the house
[1:18] of the Lord this morning.
[1:21] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:23] morning. We just want to thank the Lord
[1:26] for giving us another opportunity to be
[1:28] together and uh we just praying and
[1:31] asking that he will his presence that
[1:34] have been with us from the beginning
[1:36] will just uh see us through. Amen. I
[1:39] came in this morning and I mean just
[1:41] from uh uh the Sunday school and uh when
[1:45] I enter I came I got right under
[1:48] conviction. Amen. I just thought the
[1:50] whole service was going to be uh a
[1:53] prayer meeting because that was very
[1:56] strong. Amen. That was a very strong uh
[2:00] alter call brother Brandon had and
[2:02] closing that message uh of the church in
[2:06] this condition. And I f as to what we
[2:09] need. Uh uh I mean it was it was it was
[2:13] really convicting. I couldn't even do
[2:15] nothing. I just went straight in the
[2:17] office, put everything down, got on my
[2:19] knees and started seeking God myself.
[2:21] Amen. That was that was beautiful. The
[2:24] Lord bless you. You may have your seat
[2:25] for the while.
[2:27] And uh Thursday we were out uh uh there
[2:31] in Wnebago for brother Bobby's funeral.
[2:35] Uh we had grace to see brother Zia
[2:38] Brooks and his wife they send their
[2:39] greetings and also brother Steve Shelly
[2:43] uh uh also sent his greetings. I met him
[2:46] the first time there in uh Tennessee at
[2:50] uh uh Sister Shell's funeral, brother
[2:52] Bill Young's wife. And uh uh but it was
[2:56] it was good. And there was there was
[2:58] something that happened right after the
[3:00] funeral because brother Brooks had to
[3:02] leave and uh and and not many of the
[3:05] people we knew around. So I just
[3:07] thought, okay, right after the funeral,
[3:09] I would just leave myself, you know, I
[3:10] can get back get back to town early.
[3:14] But then uh uh when they were heading to
[3:17] the grave, I think Sister Jackie had two
[3:20] of her grandsons holding her and she saw
[3:23] me. I could tell by her eyes she was
[3:25] greeting me. So I so I felt okay maybe I
[3:29] might stay and just give her the proper
[3:31] greeting when I returned back from the
[3:33] grave site and uh uh so
[3:38] I said no let me just go you know uh so
[3:42] I got I got there and got in my vehicle
[3:45] I drove out
[3:48] I said no it's not nice let me go back
[3:51] so I went back
[3:53] and then I packed I sat down I waited
[3:55] for a Why? I said, "No, let me leave." I
[3:59] was just in between like that. But
[4:00] finally, I decided to stay and it was
[4:02] good that I stayed. It was very, very
[4:04] good that I stay because uh um uh by the
[4:09] way, Sister Nam, I gave your card just
[4:11] before the head to the graveside. So,
[4:13] that one was out of the way. And uh uh
[4:17] and and then I had the privilege to
[4:18] greet brother Bobby's wife, too. So,
[4:20] that was good. And then uh uh but then
[4:23] when I stay, I felt then I saw the
[4:27] reason why I felt that it was good for
[4:29] me to stay because uh I was able to meet
[4:33] Sister Jackie's children, you know, and
[4:36] and she was she was glad and excited
[4:39] that I was there, you know, and uh if
[4:42] you if you hang around Sister Jackie,
[4:44] you'll know that she's a special woman.
[4:46] Amen. She's special to that to that
[4:48] town. and uh uh you know but then while
[4:52] while I sit there you know because I I
[4:55] really never knew brother Bobby I just
[4:58] decided to to because brother Brandham
[5:00] had mentioned him on tape. So, I was
[5:01] sitting there and I just decided to go
[5:04] over, you know, some of the few things
[5:06] that Brother Bam was saying about him
[5:08] and uh uh uh and and you know, so and
[5:12] it's and it's there. So, and it was it
[5:15] was really a blessing to me, you know,
[5:17] it was it was a blessing and uh and we
[5:20] just thank the Lord for that. And then
[5:23] she told me and uh uh I even got to see
[5:27] her grandchildren that brought her one
[5:30] time. So we we just pray that the Lord
[5:32] would comfort the family. Amen. That the
[5:35] Lord would comfort the family. You know,
[5:38] uh I think about sister Jackie all the
[5:40] time. And uh uh there was there was a
[5:43] little there was a little video that I
[5:45] saw that really distract sister Jackie
[5:48] to me. And uh Emanuel, if you can play
[5:50] that for me.
[5:53] Uh
[6:05] I hope that it plays well. I was trying
[6:07] to I was trying to edit it. It was not
[6:09] giving me chance. So, we'll play it just
[6:11] the way it is.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Walmart. Only seconds after Jacobe got
[6:24] into her car,
[6:26] a man jumped in the passenger side. The
[6:29] man told Jacobe he had a gun and that he
[6:32] would shoot her if she didn't give him
[6:33] money.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; I said, "No,
[6:36] I'm not going to give him my money."
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Jacobe told him no three times. Then she
[6:42] started to talk to him.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; You know, cookies, you kill me. I'll go
[6:47] to heaven and you go to hell. She told
[6:51] him to ask God for forgiveness.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; I said, "Jesus is in this car
[6:57] and he goes with me everywhere I go."
[7:03] And uh
[7:05] he just sort of looked around and the
[7:08] tears began coming in his eyes.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; Jacobe ministered the man for 10 minutes
[7:14] inside her car
[7:15] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I I think I'll go home and
[7:18] pray tonight." I said, "You know, I have
[7:20] to wait tonight.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; I said, you can just pray anytime you
[7:24] want to."
[7:25] &gt;&gt; As tears were rolling down the man's
[7:27] face, Jacobe voluntarily gave him all
[7:29] the money she had, $10.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; And when I told him I was going to give
[7:33] him the money, I said, "Don't you spend
[7:36] it on whiskey either."
[7:40] &gt;&gt; The man thanked her for the money and
[7:42] then
[7:43] &gt;&gt; reached over and kissed me on the cheek.
[7:45] Jacobe had just finished putting
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[7:53] if you don't know Sister Jackie, that's
[7:54] typical Sister Jackie.
[7:57] That's typical Sister Jackie.
[8:00] You know the whole the whole uh when the
[8:04] Baker said they know Sister Jackie very
[8:06] well. They know and Jackie, you can't
[8:09] get her to wear pants. You can't get her
[8:11] to cut her hair. That's how they know
[8:14] her.
[8:15] And you know what? I I when I when I saw
[8:18] this little video, I just felt like uh
[8:22] how the presence of God goes with us,
[8:25] you know, and it can be right in your
[8:28] vehicle. I mean, she brought that man on
[8:31] a conviction. I don't think it was
[8:33] because she was an old lady that he felt
[8:37] sorry for her. I be I believe because
[8:39] the presence of the Lord was there.
[8:41] Amen. The presence of the Lord was
[8:43] there. You kill me and I go to heaven
[8:45] and you go to hell. What's about that?
[8:49] Amen. And you know that's that is just
[8:52] such a time that we are living in. And
[8:55] we we have to be very prudent. you know,
[8:58] uh whether you at the gas station or at
[9:00] the shopping mall, wherever you are, and
[9:03] uh uh if you would get out of your
[9:06] vehicle,
[9:08] uh just just close the lock of the next
[9:12] door because if someone want to rob you,
[9:15] they're not going to come through the
[9:16] door you are. They're going to come
[9:17] through the opposite door. So, just
[9:19] close the lock and then uh you can be
[9:22] But we pray that his presence will
[9:25] protect us. Amen.
[9:29] So we just we just thank the Lord for
[9:31] that and uh uh we have few prayer needs
[9:34] here. Okay. Now u
[9:37] uh sister be have uh she had a
[9:42] praise report with me yesterday about a
[9:44] young man that we prayed for. She called
[9:47] me and we prayed for him and uh uh he
[9:50] was he was honored uh spared of an evil
[9:54] influence and uh in the grace of God
[9:56] came down. And what what uh what really
[10:00] touched my heart uh uh talking about
[10:03] this is is is because uh you know when
[10:07] Jesus came to uh Zaku house he said
[10:11] salvation has come to this home. Amen.
[10:14] And uh and I share with you the last
[10:16] time meeting the lady that uh you know
[10:19] that uh sister
[10:22] uh uh laid by her place and and helped
[10:24] the family there and uh you know and
[10:27] what she said and and I just feel like
[10:29] uh uh uh
[10:33] salvation is in that home
[10:36] you know because uh uh those are Muslim
[10:39] family but it looks like the home is
[10:41] surviving on sister prayer that if there
[10:45] is anything that is happening in the
[10:47] home, they ask us they ask her to pray
[10:50] because they know that's that's the best
[10:52] and the only thing she can offer. So I
[10:54] pray that God will just have his way,
[10:58] you know, uh and then uh uh do what he's
[11:02] best known for doing. She also thanking
[11:05] God for her grandson. We pray for him
[11:07] too, her son also. And uh uh I just want
[11:13] to read another prayer uh media to you
[11:16] and then we go to the Lord in prayer.
[11:18] Praise the Lord. This came in our our
[11:22] prayer text group from uh uh
[11:32] I got this uh yesterday and u
[11:37] a prayer need a young lady
[11:41] uh was in the wreck last night came
[11:44] through the surgery. I haven't heard any
[11:47] further detail. I didn't realize she had
[11:50] two sons with her also. She was in an
[11:53] accident.
[11:54] One son is going into surgery this
[11:57] morning. Uh he has two broken legs and
[12:01] and and and broken jaw and multiple
[12:04] broken fingers. The other son has a
[12:07] broken nose.
[12:09] Praying for the Lord's mercy on them.
[12:12] Amen. And when I read this, I I just I
[12:16] felt like uh uh the brother might not
[12:19] know these people personally, but he
[12:22] witnessed the accident or was told about
[12:24] the accident. And I just and I just
[12:27] think that's an honorable thing to do.
[12:30] You know, uh you see an incident along
[12:32] the road, uh you don't need to know the
[12:35] people, but you know a God that can help
[12:38] the situation. Amen. I think that's an
[12:41] honorable thing to do. Let's just go to
[12:43] the Lord in prayer this morning.
[12:45] Heavenly Father, Lord God, we want to
[12:47] stand Lord and just remember their
[12:49] family. Oh Lord God, Father, oh precious

[14:21] we just we just thank the Lord.
[14:25] We thank the Lord for his goodness, for
[14:28] his love and mercy.
[14:30] And you know uh uh
[14:34] I was listening to uh uh news report
[14:39] and uh uh there's been a lot of uh
[14:42] situation in uh you know in Minneapolis
[14:45] with fraud cases and different things
[14:47] that is happening. I remember back uh
[14:50] during the time of the co and uh uh
[14:53] there's a group of people that wanted to
[14:54] come and bring us food and all sorts of
[14:56] things and uh uh at a time uh Jambi or
[15:01] bless the memory you know I met met him
[15:04] and talk and all of that and it really
[15:07] never sat right with me. It really never
[15:10] sat right with me. Uh for some reason I
[15:14] knew that uh you know there was co time
[15:16] you know uh shelves were empty and all
[15:19] of that but I just felt like okay are
[15:23] these food aspire foods or uh what what
[15:26] is what is the catch behind it and just
[15:28] to realize that all of that was part of
[15:30] all the fraud cases that is going on and
[15:33] it just brought some sense of peace to
[15:35] me that uh uh you know I mean they
[15:39] wouldn't have called me to court anyway
[15:41] you know, because I mean, I don't think
[15:43] they know me or they know the people
[15:44] that receive it, but the the thing that
[15:47] is just it just the good feeling to know
[15:50] that uh you know, you really didn't give
[15:53] into something just because there was a
[15:56] need,
[15:57] &gt;&gt; you know, it really really never felt
[15:59] right with me. So, I felt good about
[16:01] that. Sometimes good to feel good. Amen.
[16:05] We feel bad all the time. So, why not
[16:07] feel good? Praise the Lord. Amen.
[16:11] Praise the Lord. And uh uh
[16:16] you know I made a statement uh on
[16:19] Wednesday night when we were praying and
[16:22] just believing that uh and I came across
[16:25] this quote preacher brother sent this to
[16:27] me. Good friend of mine. We go back and
[16:30] forth and share thoughts and things on
[16:32] message testimony. Brother Brandon said
[16:34] this. He said this church was put here
[16:36] for the purpose.
[16:38] There is a spirit behind this church.
[16:41] Certainly
[16:43] spirit behind your home,
[16:46] behind every building,
[16:48] behind everything there is your motive
[16:52] and objective.
[16:54] This church come here
[16:58] to greatly exalt some human system or
[17:00] something. He said then it motive is not
[17:03] right. But if it is put here to try to
[17:06] achieve something for the kingdom of
[17:08] God, then the motive and objective both
[17:11] are right. If the motive is directly
[17:15] that way, amen.
[17:18] And like I said, we taking over the
[17:20] city. Amen.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Whether they like it or not, whether you
[17:23] like it or not. Amen. We just want for
[17:25] God to have his way. you know, taking
[17:28] over the city is not to achieve a great
[17:30] mega church, but just to be able to
[17:33] control the spirit of the city. Amen.
[17:35] Praise the Lord. Because I believe that
[17:38] because of a a righteous group of
[17:40] people, not our self-righteousness, but
[17:43] because we love the Lord, God can
[17:45] protect this city. God can bless this
[17:48] city. Amen. That uh we can be able to
[17:51] get a livelihood. Praise the Lord.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just be believe that you know
[17:57] it's is God's word just because of your
[17:59] dedication you know your your commitment
[18:02] to God can bless your company because
[18:05] you are dead amen just just one man
[18:08] that's what Abraham said is there one
[18:11] you know and God will save the city so
[18:14] uh uh you know we love that brother
[18:17] Brandon also said this in a message
[18:19] unpable sin he says uh but as a seer
[18:24] here who God shows vision.
[18:28] That's that not makes me any more than
[18:31] that drunker that was converted 10
[18:34] minutes ago. Amen. He says that's right.
[18:39] He's a Christian.
[18:41] The same as I am.
[18:45] He go to the same heaven, enjoy the same
[18:47] blessings and the things that I hold or
[18:50] anybody else. There is no great people
[18:55] or big people in the kingdom of God. We
[18:57] are all one. That's right.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody just the same. Brothers and
[19:02] sister, whether you are yellow, black,
[19:04] white, wherever you are, we are one in
[19:08] Christ.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And that's what
[19:13] we want to strive for. That's why we
[19:14] want to we want to strive for and uh uh
[19:18] just just uh you know pray that God will
[19:21] be able to bless us.
[19:24] Hallelujah.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[19:32] for the lighthouse. Just the chorus.

[24:19] Amen.
[24:21] Let's uh let's uh uh
[24:26] Okay,
[24:28] for the scripture reading, let's just
[24:30] read from verse one. After this, I look
[24:32] and behold, a door was open in heaven.
[24:35] And uh the first voice which I heard was
[24:39] as a word the trumpet talking with me
[24:43] which said come up hiom and I will show
[24:45] thee things which must be hereafter.
[24:48] Then immediately I was in the spirit and
[24:51] behold a throne
[24:54] was set in heaven and one sat on the
[24:56] throne. Brother man bake emphasis on
[24:58] this one on the throne not three. Amen.
[25:01] There's only one on the throne. And he
[25:03] that sat
[25:06] was to look upon as the jasper and sat
[25:09] in stone. And there was a rainbow around
[25:13] about the throne in inside like onto an
[25:19] amber. The amber color is produced by
[25:22] the reflection of the light from the
[25:24] jasper and the satin stones. Uh that
[25:27] reflection create an amber light. Amen.
[25:30] And then also uh in verse three, the
[25:34] rainbow was around the throne. Brother
[25:36] Brandon says he make emphasis on that
[25:39] when he used this statement. The half
[25:42] have never yet been told. So he said
[25:44] when God gave Noah the the rainbow, he
[25:47] gave him half of a rainbow. But when we
[25:50] get to the throne is a complete rainbow.
[25:52] Amen.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; So we only know half of the story of
[25:56] redemption.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what you know in the
[26:00] word, you just know half.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; The the the the fullness have not been
[26:05] told. Amen. Half of the story is not yet
[26:08] been told. So I just wanted to And
[26:11] around about the throne were four and
[26:14] and and and 24 seats.
[26:17] And upon the seats I saw four and 24
[26:21] elders sitting clothed in white rim. And
[26:24] they had in their they had on their head
[26:29] crowns of gold. Praise the Lord.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; These 24 elders are the 12 apostles and
[26:36] uh the 12 patriots. Praise the Lord.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not it's not difficult to
[26:43] see that when brother Brandham said John
[26:45] saw himself
[26:47] because he was one of the 12 apostles.
[26:51] Amen. So when brother Brandham said when
[26:53] the seal opened and John saw himself, it
[26:57] was not like John seeing John that was
[27:00] born of his parents, but he saw a
[27:03] representation understanding that the 12
[27:06] the 24 elders were the 12 apostles and
[27:10] the 12 patriots. Praise the Lord.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Now you can also see yourself when you
[27:16] know your where you are identified
[27:20] &gt;&gt; within there. We we will come to that.
[27:22] Praise the Lord.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me preaching
[27:28] because you are still standing. And out
[27:30] of the throne proceed uh likeness and
[27:33] thunders and boys and there were seven
[27:35] lamps of fire burning before the throne
[27:38] which are the seven spirits of God. We
[27:42] touched that last time. Verse six. And
[27:44] before the throne there was a sea of
[27:47] glass like unto crystal. And in the
[27:50] midst of the throne
[27:52] and around about the throne were four be
[27:56] full of eyes before and behind. Watch
[28:00] that now. Eyes before and behind. But
[28:03] watch now. Pay attention. And uh the
[28:06] first beast was like a lion. The second
[28:10] uh beast like a cow. The third beast
[28:12] like the face of a man. And the fourth
[28:15] beast was like a flying eagle. And the
[28:19] four beasts each had uh uh the four
[28:24] beasts had each of them six wings with
[28:26] him. And they have and they were four of
[28:30] eyes within. Now so the first verse say
[28:33] they have eyes before and behind. And
[28:36] this verse say they have eyes within.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:43] and uh and and the and they rest not day
[28:46] and night
[28:49] saying, "Holy, holy,
[28:52] holy Lord God Almighty which was which
[28:56] is which is to come." That will also
[28:59] explain their eyes before behind and
[29:01] within which was which is to come. Let's
[29:04] pray. Father, we just want to thank you
[29:06] this morning, oh God, uh dear Lord, and
[29:09] and uh we just uh pray that you bless us
[29:12] in your presence and and uh that uh
[29:14] something of internal value be shared
[29:16] this morning. Something that will bring
[29:18] us closer, oh God, with better
[29:21] enlightenment, better understanding that
[29:23] the word in us will be quickened,
[29:25] Father. Lord, we thank you. We
[29:27] appreciate you, oh God. Father, and we
[29:30] just ask your blessings now. bless us in
[29:32] your presence and those that are
[29:34] streaming in the service this morning,
[29:36] we commit them into your hands as well.
[29:39] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord
[29:42] bless you. You may have your seat
[29:46] now. So uh uh uh
[29:51] uh if you can put my picture up. Let's
[29:54] remind oursel we've been talking about
[29:56] these uh these uh uh
[30:00] phobies.
[30:01] Praise the Lord. Our subject has been
[30:04] around this for a while now. I'm I'm I'm
[30:07] trying to see how uh I don't I don't
[30:10] feel like I'm leaving it soon. So, uh uh
[30:14] every time I I bring something later, I
[30:17] just want want to remind us. Here we
[30:19] have the four anointing and uh the the
[30:23] tapifi the the cherry beans and then on
[30:26] this side we have the four
[30:29] uh uh horse riders which also types the
[30:34] power that is waring against the church.
[30:37] This year types the church. Amen.
[30:42] And we read there in Isaiah chapter one
[30:46] where uh Isaiah speaks of uh you know
[30:49] coming to to the Lord in his holy
[30:51] mountain. So the congregation of God has
[30:54] always been tied as a mountain. The the
[30:57] the place of God. God took Moses on top
[31:00] of the mountain to give him the word.
[31:02] The act rested on top of the mountain.
[31:05] So it it just it just give us that sense
[31:07] of God's presence, God's house and all
[31:10] of that. Now, so uh what what we what we
[31:15] uh we were uh are drawn to to go into
[31:18] this is just to show us the powers that
[31:22] are waring against us. Amen. We fight
[31:26] not against flesh and blood but against
[31:28] spiritual wickedness in in high places.
[31:31] So we we we realize that uh there are
[31:34] these spirits, you know, that that uh
[31:38] that are waring against us. And as as we
[31:41] will look into uh I wanted to find a way
[31:44] to to break it down down in a way that
[31:47] where I was going to split all of these
[31:49] beasts and make the pyramid go little by
[31:52] little. Uh still working on that. But uh
[31:57] uh
[31:59] we realize here in revelation chapter 6.
[32:03] So if you read revelation chapter 4 what
[32:06] where where we have just read it it
[32:09] shows to us it identify these living
[32:13] creatures
[32:14] which is the lion, the ox, the man and
[32:16] the eagle. in Revelation chapter 6
[32:20] brings us uh these uh uh uh horse and
[32:25] horse riders and and one of these say
[32:27] come and see and then they show us the
[32:29] white the white horse and he had a bold
[32:32] and and the crown was given to him. Now,
[32:34] so uh uh as as we look at this, we
[32:39] realize that uh these are these are the
[32:42] power. You go you go right back. We try
[32:44] to show that how brother Brandon says
[32:46] you can pick them up in the Old
[32:48] Testament. They has been there right
[32:50] from time. Amen. And uh uh and also this
[32:54] anointing has been guiding the church
[32:56] since uh the beginning. uh we see God
[32:59] pull the cherub bean in the in the
[33:01] garden of Eden to pro protect the tree
[33:04] of life. It was the presence of this
[33:06] anointing. Now another thing that we try
[33:09] to to you know to to uh uh remind you or
[33:13] say because in the old testament they
[33:16] were under the blood of bulls and goats.
[33:19] So this anointing and this power really
[33:23] never came to a clear view. They are
[33:26] there but they are not they are not
[33:28] visible as you can see them being
[33:30] visible in the book of revelation. Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because uh uh the church we have
[33:37] just come under the blood of Jesus
[33:40] Christ the sacrifice the the perfect
[33:42] atonement has been has been uh has been
[33:45] made. So uh uh under that blood we see
[33:48] things more clearer. Are we together?
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:53] Now so uh uh uh we trying trying to
[33:57] review here we see that this lion
[34:00] anointing uh was in the first three
[34:02] church ages. The first three church ages
[34:05] were under the lion anointing. Now also
[34:09] they first rather started here under
[34:12] these first three church ages in the
[34:14] beginning. That's the reason why the the
[34:17] power is why because it was very
[34:19] innocent. Amen. It was it was very
[34:22] innocent. It was just a thought. Praise
[34:25] the Lord. It was just a thought. But as
[34:27] it moved to the next age, it started
[34:30] becoming stronger. It started being
[34:33] established. And then when we got to the
[34:36] to the third church age, we we will find
[34:38] I will find time and and we will really
[34:39] go there because I I have another
[34:41] picture that will really explain it to
[34:43] us. I'm just trying to recap on
[34:46] something here. When it got to the third
[34:48] church age, that's the reason why in the
[34:50] first age he had a bowl. In the in the
[34:53] third age, he got a crown. That's where
[34:55] the trinity doctrine was crowned. Now,
[34:58] it has a crown. It has been given a
[35:00] throne. You know, it's now is now you
[35:03] know what among the people. Now, the ox
[35:05] anointing was only in the the fourth
[35:08] church age, which is the dark age. That
[35:10] was the age of great persecution and God
[35:13] anointed his people for that. The man
[35:16] anointing
[35:18] came up here uh with uh uh uh
[35:24] uh honor the man's anointing. Both uh
[35:26] the next three church ages will be under
[35:30] the man's anointing. Now the eagle
[35:32] anointing picks up from under the seven
[35:36] church age here and goes into the
[35:38] capstone age. It's a flying anointing.
[35:41] It picks up from Revelation chapter 3.
[35:44] Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when the Bible says, "Behold,
[35:47] I stand at the door and knock."
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, uh he was standing at the door
[35:52] and knock. And brother Brandham said
[35:54] when he was doing that, then Revelation
[35:58] 18:4 sounded. He said, "Come out of all
[36:00] my people."
[36:02] &gt;&gt; We are. That's right.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? You see the thing about
[36:07] it then is that like like we shared the
[36:09] last time uh uh where brother Brandham
[36:12] says this is not a verse by verse
[36:14] happening.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why the book of
[36:17] revelation has been difficult for people
[36:20] to understand because it's not a verse
[36:22] by verse happening.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Until God h
[36:27] give us a prophet we will now understand
[36:29] it.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; It's not a verse by verse happening. You
[36:33] see, so when Revelation 3 says, "Behold,
[36:37] I stand at the door and not uh uh when
[36:40] when when when when he was there at that
[36:42] time, the church has locked him out. So
[36:45] he was not going back into the church."
[36:49] So he he sounded Revelation 18:4, "Come
[36:52] out of my people." And then Revelation
[36:54] 4, what happened? The Bible say there
[36:56] was open door in heaven. The church
[36:58] closed his door or closed her door to
[37:01] Christ. But yet there is an open door in
[37:04] heaven which is a further revelation.
[37:06] Now God is taking the church out of her
[37:09] creed and dark mind into a further
[37:12] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; I don't think I've done a good job of
[37:24] reviewing but anyway
[37:27] &gt;&gt; we will we will get there. Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; We will get there. Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; We will get there. So this this morning
[37:37] and uh uh uh as we talk about this and
[37:40] we we we talk about where he says come
[37:43] and see you know uh uh the you know one
[37:46] of one of the uh the be said come and
[37:50] see and then he show us the house. So as
[37:52] we talk about there we also try to make
[37:55] us the Bible says uh uh he that overcome
[38:00] will be granted you know
[38:03] all the rewards of the overcomer was was
[38:06] promised through the church ages. How
[38:09] did the church overcame?
[38:13] John would tell us that they overcame by
[38:15] the blood of the lamb and the words of
[38:17] his testimony. the words of his
[38:20] testimony was what was given to these uh
[38:24] uh anointing as as as the message.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; So you see actually is the message from
[38:34] this anointing or that that that
[38:37] influence the messenger through the
[38:39] church ages that make us overcomers.
[38:42] Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; We are now overcoming in our power
[38:45] because he said it to Zachchariah. It's
[38:48] not by power. It's not by might but by
[38:51] my spirit say the Lord.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; So just like how we demonstrated here
[38:59] getting four brothers and we lock our
[39:01] arms together to show how the church is
[39:05] in the middle of the four beasts. Amen.
[39:08] The lion is here. The ox is here. The
[39:11] man is here. The eagle is here and their
[39:13] wings are locked together. I was I was
[39:16] listening to something this morning and
[39:17] brother Brian was talking about u he
[39:20] says how he says how how how was the
[39:23] week of that of that uh patron of my
[39:26] sons said he said how was the week form
[39:28] on Jesus he said it was the wings of the
[39:31] angels
[39:33] &gt;&gt; okay so it is the same thing here like I
[39:36] said it before it's the same thing when
[39:38] uh uh the when when Isaiah said his
[39:41] train filled the temple
[39:43] that pain was the locking of the angel's
[39:47] wing. He said it was moving about like a
[39:49] train.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; So that's that is the way that uh this
[39:58] anointing are protecting the church
[40:00] because their wings are locked. Now you
[40:03] tell me now how can the devil ever get
[40:06] in a group of people like that when
[40:08] these beasts have eyes before they have
[40:11] eyes behind. They have eyes within. How
[40:14] is the devil ever going to sneak in that
[40:16] group
[40:17] &gt;&gt; unless God allowed him?
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; There is no way you can bypass uh h that
[40:26] anointing. You needs uh you needs uh you
[40:30] need h a person needs uh to be allowed.
[40:34] God has to allowed.
[40:37] Whatever comes upon the church, whatever
[40:39] comes upon the people, God has to allow
[40:42] it.
[40:44] Are we together?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Because the church is fully secure,
[40:49] fully protected, honor God's protection
[40:53] &gt;&gt; and nothing can harm us unless God allow
[40:56] it.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; And there's something like that we want
[41:00] to look at this morning. So just just
[41:02] trying to to build here. So we see here
[41:05] that uh uh uh Satan have this power
[41:09] waring against the church but yet God
[41:11] has an anointing.
[41:15] He has an anointing and like I said
[41:17] before even in our individual life we
[41:21] are influenced by this anointing.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; There's a time where you are you your
[41:28] faith is up. You are believing God. You
[41:31] you know you are under the lion's
[41:33] anointing.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; There is not one anointing that is
[41:38] constant to you.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; You need the ox anointing for the trial
[41:46] of your faith.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; You need the man's anointing for the
[41:54] understanding of the word.
[41:58] You need the ego anointing for for
[42:02] spiritual gifts. Entering the heavens,
[42:04] &gt;&gt; breaking in the spirit.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Getting out of the flesh.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Sometime just being
[42:13] &gt;&gt; and people think you crazy.
[42:17] Sometime the ego's anointing job you a
[42:19] little bit and it shakes you. You say,
[42:22] "What's wrong just now?" Amen. you. But
[42:25] the thing that is that you cannot be
[42:27] just like there was no church age that
[42:30] was on I mean all the church ages were
[42:34] not just on a one anointing but they
[42:36] were supported
[42:39] &gt;&gt; by every anointing.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; So every anointing support the believer
[42:44] individually.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:53] And I I I I try to bring this uh uh and
[42:57] then sometimes
[42:59] you know uh uh because we we we have
[43:02] come to this place where uh uh uh not
[43:06] understanding how God is dealing with us
[43:08] or how he dealt with us through the
[43:10] church ages. Sometime we can come to a
[43:13] place where we misunderstand what God is
[43:16] doing in our lives.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a person can can can come
[43:23] under an ox anointing a time of trial
[43:27] and they just think that maybe there is
[43:29] some kind of a family sin. There is some
[43:31] kind of a sin in their life. That's why
[43:33] this thing is happening. And and and you
[43:36] see the thing about it that it does not
[43:37] bother God because he knows what he's
[43:39] doing.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Then you see then we have all of these
[43:46] uh uh uh preachers and false prophet in
[43:49] the age that are that are that are witch
[43:51] hunting. They tell you, "Oh no, you get
[43:53] a family line. You get a you know
[43:55] something in your family. Your your your
[43:57] great-grandparent was was this and that
[43:59] and all of that." Praise the Lord. The
[44:02] new birth,
[44:04] the new birth
[44:06] &gt;&gt; when we are born again.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; The new birth starts a new generation in
[44:13] you.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; If you are born again by by by you know
[44:19] by the word of God and you receive the
[44:22] spirit of God, it must be able to cut
[44:25] you.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Now it brings you honor. Honor. God
[44:33] start dealing with you and you know
[44:35] that's that's the reason why at the
[44:37] beginning when you receive the Lord
[44:38] Jesus you know you are you are you are
[44:40] on fire.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; That's that's a lion anointing.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You ready to tell the truth any
[44:48] any word you ready to rebuke people. You
[44:50] want to save anybody.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Because you honor the lion's
[44:53] anointing is just an influence of it.
[44:55] The liar just passed by your side.
[44:57] That's all.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But then after the
[45:01] period of time things start happening in
[45:03] your life.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Now if you don't understand it then you
[45:07] start questioning am I really safe?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Why am I going through this?
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; One time Job prosper. One time Job the
[45:19] Bible says the the children of the
[45:21] street came to him. When he pass in the
[45:23] marketplaces people bring their their
[45:25] problem their own problem. I mean, he
[45:28] was under the lion's anointing at that
[45:30] time,
[45:33] &gt;&gt; but then when his children died, his
[45:35] cattle died and everything died, God put
[45:37] him under the ox anointing.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's something that has been through
[45:42] all the ages.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; That is that is the reason why when
[45:51] brother Brandon preached the message
[45:52] influence, that's what he was trying to
[45:55] teach us. We are influenced by
[45:58] anointing.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; He says those those those angel
[46:02] influence Isaiah. It changed his
[46:05] influence because he was under the
[46:07] influence of Yuzia. But when he went
[46:10] into the presence of God and the angels
[46:13] move around his train filled the temple.
[46:16] He was lifted up it influenced him.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; So just like how Isaiah got influenced.
[46:22] We are under the influence of seven
[46:25] angels that have opened the book.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Our influence is not coming from from
[46:35] Jeffersonville. Our influence is not
[46:37] coming from a church. Our influence is
[46:40] coming from seven angels
[46:44] &gt;&gt; that open the book and reveal the seals.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; So there is nothing you can do without
[46:50] influence.
[46:52] Just just remind yourself
[46:55] &gt;&gt; the question we must ask is what is
[46:57] influencing me?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot do anything without
[47:03] influence.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Another thing there is that you are
[47:07] influencing somebody.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody is influencing you.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; We don't have have an existing without
[47:18] influence.
[47:19] You are influencing somebody or somebody
[47:22] is influencing you.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; This is just my introduction.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; It's just my introduction. I don't want
[47:40] to forget that we have a prayer meeting
[47:41] tonight and uh with with a community

[48:51] Amen.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; We love to we love to see you. We always
[48:55] love to see you. Now, so that's that's
[48:57] what we want to that's what we want to
[48:59] deal with this morning. So uh uh uh we
[49:02] cannot do anything without influence.
[49:06] We cannot do anything. Uh you go you go
[49:08] to the book of of Daniel. Daniel show us
[49:12] how politics is under this influence.
[49:17] The word powers they are under this
[49:19] influence.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; It's from the bottomless pit.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Put whoever you want on the throne.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; It's not the man is the influence.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[49:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the man is the influence.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[49:38] &gt;&gt; So Revelation 6 now show us this
[49:41] influence. Now when you read there the
[49:43] Bible say it was where? before the
[49:46] throne.
[49:48] Before the throne, these four beasts,
[49:51] they were before the throne.
[49:55] That's what that's that's what I want I
[49:57] want us to think about. So, you must
[49:59] realize that uh uh uh uh we are being
[50:03] influenced directly from the throne of
[50:05] God,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; not from some hellquarter.
[50:08] Amen. Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Directly from the throne of God because
[50:12] this anointing are before the throne.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look there also, there
[50:19] is something that I want to go into this
[50:21] morning. I'm just I'm just uh uh all
[50:24] over the place, but uh we will soon
[50:27] land. Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Now, so you read down here, you find
[50:31] another thing that we talk about. Verse
[50:33] 5. And out of the throne proceed
[50:34] lightning and thunder and voices. And
[50:37] there were seven seven lamps
[50:40] of uh fire burning before the throne
[50:44] which are the seven spirits of God. We
[50:46] started talking about the seven spirits
[50:48] of God the other Wednesday night and we
[50:51] chose you know is is you know uh uh
[50:54] there is there is one Holy Spirit but
[50:56] these seven spirits of God the they the

[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Uh let's go to the book of Isaiah.
[51:18] Let's go to the book of Isaiah. If uh if
[51:21] uh you know if I'll be able to remember
[51:23] now,
[51:26] let me see if I can run there before
[51:29] you.
[51:33] I thought I was going to share this with
[51:35] you.
[51:40] Okay, let's let's Okay. Isaiah Isaiah
[51:42] chapter 11. Isaiah chapter 11.
[51:48] Isaiah chapter 11.
[51:54] I want you to to pay attention here.
[51:58] And there shall come forth a rod out of
[52:01] the stem of Jesse. A branch shall grow
[52:05] out of his root. Who is this? Jesus
[52:08] Christ. He's the root and the offspring
[52:10] of David.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Jesse is the father of David.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[52:16] &gt;&gt; So this is Jesus Christ.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Now listen now. Verse two. And the
[52:22] spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.

[52:28] understanding, the spirit of counsel
[52:32] and might,
[52:35] the the spirit of knowledge and the fear
[52:38] of the Lord.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; What do you see in it?
[52:46] &gt;&gt; What do you see in it? If you pay close
[52:49] attention, there are seven spirits.
[52:56] So these are the ingredients of the
[52:59] seven spirits.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; These are the ingredients.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Each each of the seven spirits that will
[53:07] dwell on the seven messenger of the of
[53:09] the angel will have these ingredients.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; It will have to be the spirit of the
[53:14] Lord. It will be the spirit of wisdom.
[53:16] It will be the spirit of understanding.
[53:18] It will be the spirit of that's the
[53:20] ingredients.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:25] and the fear of the Lord.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; So,
[53:38] man, I'm using all my time on the
[53:40] review. Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; But, uh what what what I note is that uh
[53:45] uh uh
[53:49] I think I think it's a blessing to
[53:50] somebody. Somebody is pulling it. Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Because I want to go into what I want to
[53:54] go into and yet I keep hanging around
[53:57] here. So
[53:59] &gt;&gt; So this these are the ingredients of the
[54:02] seven spirits. So each of these
[54:05] ministers or each of these messenger of
[54:07] the ages will have to have the spirit of
[54:10] the Lord. The pre the primary thing they
[54:13] will have the spirit of wisdom. They
[54:15] will have the spirit to be able to deal
[54:17] with what they were dealing with in
[54:19] their age.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow.
[54:22] Are we together?
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, yeah, you you can you can read
[54:29] it. You can read the rest and when you
[54:31] get home and uh put that in your notes.
[54:35] Let's go forward. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Let's go forward
[54:41] because if not, we're not going to move
[54:43] from you. Revelation chapter 4. That's
[54:44] where we are. Now, what I want to talk
[54:46] about this this uh this morning is the
[54:49] seed of glass. I want to talk about a
[54:51] seat of glass.
[54:54] I was sitting down, you know, uh uh
[54:56] doing some few few counseling, talking
[54:59] to to different few folks and and uh uh
[55:03] you know u so uh uh
[55:08] Sister Bu your
[55:11] question or whatever we talk about kind
[55:13] of a influence drove me into this
[55:15] because I was just sitting there and I
[55:17] was just asking the Lord, how can I get
[55:19] back into the subject? What should I
[55:21] pick up? And then uh uh she shared uh
[55:25] something with me. She shared a dream
[55:26] with me. And then when we got through
[55:29] praying, I just felt it in my heart.
[55:31] Okay, that's what needed you need to
[55:34] deal with. So, so that's what I want to
[55:36] talk about this morning, the seed of
[55:38] glass. So when you read Revelation
[55:40] chapter 4, the uh the the scripture led
[55:44] us to know those four anointing that we
[55:46] have up here. Okay. uh
[55:50] and uh they were before the throne of
[55:52] God. Now you come to verse 6. Revelation
[55:55] 4:6.
[55:57] And before the throne
[55:59] there was a sea of glass like unto
[56:04] crystal. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; A sea of glass that is like unto crystal
[56:10] is a sea that is transparent.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[56:14] &gt;&gt; That's what it means.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; It's a sea that is transparent. You can
[56:18] see through it.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to realize that all of
[56:23] these things are are symbols,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; But we can find the representation in
[56:28] the Old Testament,
[56:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. So, the the
[56:31] seed of glass like unto crystal and in
[56:36] the midst of the throne and around the
[56:39] throne were the four beasts full of eyes
[56:42] behind before and behind. Now, so we
[56:46] also see now the the the the four beasts
[56:50] are also now associated with this sea of
[56:54] glass.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; It's all is before the throne. So if
[57:02] they are the influence that are that are
[57:04] that are the anointing that is
[57:06] protecting the the the throne, then they
[57:09] are also protecting this seat of glass.
[57:13] That's what I want. That's that's where
[57:15] I want to bring the the the the the
[57:19] study to this morning. They are also
[57:21] protecting the seat of glass. So what is
[57:23] this seed of glass? That's what we want
[57:25] to look into. Amen. What is the sea of
[57:28] glass? Now let's let's just take some of
[57:32] our notes here. It will help us to go
[57:34] quickly.
[57:36] Uh Revelation Revelation uh chapter 4 uh
[57:39] the throne of mercy. Let's get to our
[57:41] quote. Let's take this and then we can
[57:44] be able to uh go into it quickly.
[57:48] Revelation chapter 4.
[57:50] Now, now we want to study it just a
[57:53] little bit. The sea of glass is is
[57:56] symbolized in the Old Testament. So in
[57:59] the Old Testament, there is a
[58:01] representation because when Moses came
[58:03] down from the mountain, God gave him a
[58:06] pattern to build a tabernacle according
[58:08] to the faction in heaven.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So whatever he was going to build
[58:13] that was going to be that tabernacle
[58:16] has its representation before the throne
[58:18] of God. Are we together? So we see that
[58:22] the seed of glass is is symbolized in
[58:25] Moses tabernacle. For Moses was
[58:27] commanded of God to build a tabernacle
[58:29] on earth like he saw in heaven. Everyone
[58:32] knows that. All right. And and and let
[58:35] me just draw a little bit here. Trying
[58:38] to uh draw the Old Testament tabernacle.
[58:41] All right. Right. Next h
[58:44] uh this was called the holiest of holy.
[58:47] That that is the holy place. The next
[58:49] place was the altar. It was called the
[58:52] holy place. And right before
[58:55] was the sea of glass. It was called in
[58:58] other word it was the place where the
[59:00] sacrifice was the sea of brass. Amen.
[59:04] The sea of brass was called. Now, if you
[59:07] look at the Old Testament tabernacle,
[59:09] there were three mineral rod that were
[59:11] that were permanently used. It was br,
[59:15] silver, and gold.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; The outside part of the tabernacle was
[59:20] fashioned with brass.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brass symbolize judgment.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The inside of the
[59:31] tabernacle if you read Exodus or
[59:33] Leviticus you'll find out there all the
[59:36] tables they are stand they were all
[59:37] sitting on savor.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[59:39] &gt;&gt; that represent redemption.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And then in the holiest of holy the ark
[59:48] of the covenant was built with what?
[59:50] Gold.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Representing deity.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:58] So brass was on the outside representing
[1:00:02] judgment.
[1:00:04] Savor was in the on the inside
[1:00:07] representing rep I mean redemption and
[1:00:10] then gold was in the holiest of holy.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; now? So this was called in the old
[1:00:18] testament
[1:00:20] uh the sea of brass.
[1:00:22] Why? Because the lava that the water was
[1:00:26] put in to wash the sacrifice was made
[1:00:29] out of brass.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Between brass, silver, and gold, brass
[1:00:37] can stand more fire more than the other
[1:00:41] two.
[1:00:43] So brass is a symbol of judgment.
[1:00:48] Are we together?
[1:00:53] Now, so uh uh uh just to give you so in
[1:00:57] the Old Testament, it was called the sea
[1:01:00] of brass because it was it was a water
[1:01:03] that was put into a brass lav for the
[1:01:07] watching of the sacrifice before, you
[1:01:10] know, uh uh uh it will be killed and be
[1:01:13] and be offered for the people.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:18] So here in the New Testament or in the
[1:01:21] book of Revelation is called the sea of
[1:01:23] glass like crystal. But in the Old
[1:01:26] Testament it was called the sea of
[1:01:28] brass.
[1:01:31] Are we together?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; If you follow me, if we stay together,
[1:01:37] we will arrive. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; We will arrive.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; So let's read down a little bit. Uh uh
[1:01:43] uh uh. It was the place where the
[1:01:46] sacrifice was watched year before they
[1:01:50] was received at the altar
[1:01:53] at their bride altar or the brazing
[1:01:56] altar where the sacrifice was burned.
[1:01:59] This was called the sea of brides.
[1:02:03] It wasn't quite big. It was uh set over
[1:02:06] more or less positionally in the temple.
[1:02:10] It was set alone about like this. All
[1:02:13] right. I wish that I
[1:02:15] had a picture of the old of the
[1:02:18] tabernacle, but let's just go. It will
[1:02:20] it will just it will throw me off. Let's
[1:02:23] go. Uh
[1:02:25] it was a sea of brass. It was a lava
[1:02:28] made out of brass where they washed the
[1:02:30] sacrifice. And before the sacrifice was
[1:02:33] burned or accepted, it had to be washed.
[1:02:36] Before the sacrifice was received to
[1:02:38] God,
[1:02:40] it first got to be washed.
[1:02:43] not emotionally
[1:02:45] but watched by the word. Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So whatever was done in the Old
[1:02:53] Testament
[1:02:54] uh uh the the sacrifice was watch
[1:02:58] the the the priest was watch. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; The believers was were watched. The
[1:03:05] sacrifice was watch. Are we together?
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before the the priest would go
[1:03:12] into his uh into his service, he had to
[1:03:15] wash his feet also in the brazing lava
[1:03:18] before he goes into into the holy place.
[1:03:22] Are we together?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Now you will see
[1:03:27] Jesus comes
[1:03:29] and just before
[1:03:32] his crucification, he take a basin and
[1:03:34] he start washing the disciples feet.
[1:03:37] And Peter said, "No, you're not going to
[1:03:39] wash my feet." Not me. No. Jesus said
[1:03:42] what I'm doing you don't understand it
[1:03:43] now. He said well then then just wash my
[1:03:45] whole body.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said he whose feet is washed don't
[1:03:51] need his whole body to be washed. Now so
[1:03:54] what is happening is that earlier Jesus
[1:03:56] have told them you are
[1:04:00] clean by the words that I have spoken to
[1:04:04] you.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] But yet he's bringing an Old Testament
[1:04:12] representation
[1:04:14] to the disciples
[1:04:16] and he's going to tell them that before
[1:04:19] the priest comes into his office there
[1:04:22] is a general body watch. Moses put him
[1:04:25] in a basin and wash him, anoint him and
[1:04:30] dress him.
[1:04:32] Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; That is the general watch. But for every
[1:04:37] service, every time that he will go into
[1:04:41] the the the tabernacle, he have to wash
[1:04:43] his feet.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; That was for daily sacrifice. When we
[1:04:52] when we come to the Lord, Paul says we
[1:04:54] are watched by the water of the word.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; He he he sanctified us. He draw us to
[1:05:02] ourself. But we need a daily watch.
[1:05:05] Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; We need a daily watch where the Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit will be able to touch those
[1:05:13] little places in our life where we need
[1:05:16] to bring on our prayers. We need to
[1:05:18] commit it to God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So we see that this whole sea of brass
[1:05:29] or sea of glass it all has a
[1:05:33] representation of watching.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So now the influence of the four beasts
[1:05:42] around the the the the sea of glass is
[1:05:46] that uh these beasts uh h
[1:05:49] are uh influence. Like I said they are
[1:05:52] beasts of influence. the the they
[1:05:54] influence uh uh our cleansing and let
[1:05:57] let me say it that way uh in a sense
[1:06:00] that uh uh uh they are the anointing in
[1:06:05] in each age that is given to the church
[1:06:09] to be able to measure up to God for that
[1:06:13] age.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; I say that again. We see the the the the
[1:06:21] sea of glass before the throne. And yet
[1:06:25] we see these four beasts that are are
[1:06:28] creatures of influence.
[1:06:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation chapter 4, you you
[1:06:36] will soon you will soon see uh uh uh
[1:06:39] where the picture gets beautiful. In
[1:06:41] Revelation chapter 4, the Bible says,
[1:06:44] "This sea of glass is like crystal."
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. is clear.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; What does that represent? The reveal
[1:06:52] word, the open book.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It's clear. When you look inside, you
[1:07:00] must be able to see yourself.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; The very same thing like James says, the
[1:07:05] word of God is looking like in a mirror.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; The reason why it's clear is because it
[1:07:12] has to be reflective.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. What happened in the Old Testament
[1:07:19] tabernacle? When you go to the lava to
[1:07:22] wash your feet, there is a light coming
[1:07:24] from the shakana glory that shines in
[1:07:27] the lava and you see yourself.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Now on this side is a is is crystal. The
[1:07:38] reason why it is crystal is because it's
[1:07:40] reflective.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You must be we must be able to see
[1:07:44] ourself in the word. Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; We must be able to see ourself in the
[1:07:51] preaching of the word. That is the
[1:07:53] influence that is coming from this
[1:07:55] anointing around the throne. Not seeing
[1:07:58] somebody else, not preaching somebody
[1:08:00] else. We must be able to see ourself.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory be to God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And you see uh uh uh uh the more that's
[1:08:22] the reason why we need a daily watch
[1:08:25] because the more that we we we look into
[1:08:28] the word that's why it's crystal it
[1:08:31] becomes clearer.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; We start to see things clearer.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Let me take you down a little journey
[1:08:39] here this morning. Am I open to you?
[1:08:41] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; When God called Abraham, the Bible says
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; God told him he will make him a father
[1:08:49] of nations.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Abraham was seeking for a
[1:08:55] city.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Whom maker and builder is God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; I believe when when Abraham met me
[1:09:08] because he was he was he was a king and
[1:09:11] a priest. Abraham thought he has
[1:09:13] arrived.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; You realize that Abraham looked for the
[1:09:21] city all through his life.
[1:09:29] But the thing about it then is that
[1:09:31] every time he was going he was guessing
[1:09:34] that this might be the place. Then he
[1:09:35] realized it's not the place but he got
[1:09:37] an understanding and God bless him. Then
[1:09:39] he moved to the next place. He thinking
[1:09:41] that this might be the place. He
[1:09:42] realized that it is not the place.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I was looking at this yesterday. It
[1:09:52] really blessed me.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrew chapter 11 verse uh 10 the
[1:09:56] Bible says
[1:09:59] let's read that it really blessed me
[1:10:02] yesterday
[1:10:04] 11:10 the Bible says
[1:10:14] 11:10 okay I thought they would get
[1:10:16] there before me but I'm there before
[1:10:18] them for he looked for a city which have
[1:10:22] foundation s
[1:10:24] whose builder and maker is God.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Where was this city's foundation?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; What was the foundation of the city?
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the word.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He was looking for a city whose builder
[1:10:41] and maker.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Look at those words very closely.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; At one time and and and and Abraham
[1:10:55] thought that this was a physical city,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; but as he kept going along with God and
[1:11:02] he kept going along with God, he starts
[1:11:04] to realize that this this might be
[1:11:07] something else.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; It's not a physical city.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:15] Then Jesus would come and said you are a
[1:11:19] city on the hill.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; So what what Abraham was looking for
[1:11:25] outside was in him.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; The city was in him and he was looking
[1:11:32] for it.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Is that not the same thing that we are
[1:11:34] doing?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are looking for in this
[1:11:37] world is in you.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are a city on the hill
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; that cannot be hid."
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Revelation, the new
[1:11:56] Jerusalem, come down like a bride,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; a door for her husband."
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He was looking for the physical city
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; when God was building a city within him.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] The Bible says, "Who builder and
[1:12:16] makerise?"
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; When God, Genesis 1, the Bible says God
[1:12:21] made man in his image.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; That's the maker. He made man in his
[1:12:26] image.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, Peter let us know
[1:12:32] he's building a church.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:38] So he made man in his image and he's
[1:12:40] building a bride.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; God
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; according to his character,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Who's builder and maker?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; The the the sooner we realize that uh we
[1:12:59] are more spirit being
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; put in the flesh
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; to discover who you are.
[1:13:08] God put you in the flesh so you can
[1:13:10] discover who you are.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; So you can discover what is in you.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That is the mystery.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, one day we realize that heaven is
[1:13:27] not a place physically that we are
[1:13:29] going. It's just a dimension. And that
[1:13:31] dimension is here. Jesus said when they
[1:13:34] say that the kingdom come, don't look
[1:13:36] left, don't look right because the
[1:13:38] kingdom is in you.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Ah when we start paying attention to
[1:13:47] what God is doing in us and you start
[1:13:50] you start taking more value to yourself
[1:13:53] than those people on Facebook than those
[1:13:55] people that you watch on television. If
[1:13:57] you start appreciating what the grace of
[1:13:59] God is doing in your life.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; You'll get closer to God.
[1:14:04] That's it.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; It took me a while to get here,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; but I'm ready to preach.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; It took me a while to get right here.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; This is where I was struggling to get.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; This is where I was struggling to get.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; So now I can preach. You love the Lord.
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; He was looking for a city who build a
[1:14:42] maker is God.
[1:14:48] You hear about what Lot and and and is
[1:14:50] achieving down there in Sodom.
[1:14:53] I mean being being a human being he
[1:14:55] could get discouraged. Man this this
[1:14:57] this was just my nephew. I brought him
[1:14:59] alone and now he has finally a city that
[1:15:01] he's prospering. Where is my city?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; He was carrying his city alone.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; He was carrying his city alone.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; If he could just stop and why
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; and say, "Who am I
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; that God would come in flesh and visit
[1:15:19] with me? Who am I?
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:35] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Happiness does not comes from the things
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; that we acquired.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; If you can't get it in you, you will not
[1:15:48] get it.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; If you can't get it in you, you will not
[1:15:53] get it.
[1:15:55] Healing don't comes from the doctors.
[1:15:57] The doctors only facilitate.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But healing is in you.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Why they have to take your blood?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; The doctor take your blood.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; If they had healing, you will go there
[1:16:08] and say I'm sick. They say okay wait.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Take it. You are healed.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; They say sit down.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; What wrong with you? Let's let test your
[1:16:18] paws first.

[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; A time for everything. A time to be
[1:19:57] born. A time to die.
[1:20:00] Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; A time to kill, a time to be broken.
[1:20:04] Now, in one sense, if you take it a
[1:20:06] little bit, you will you can you can
[1:20:08] apply it to the influence that we just
[1:20:11] talked about. Moving from under one
[1:20:13] influence to another, moving from under
[1:20:16] one uh one beast, influence of of an
[1:20:20] anointing to another might carry us
[1:20:22] through all of this.
[1:20:24] Are we together?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember
[1:20:29] remember that uh let's go to Genesis.
[1:20:32] We'll come back to to Ecclesiastes, but
[1:20:34] let's go to Genesis. It's uh this is uh
[1:20:37] one of my uh favorite chapter. I think
[1:20:40] that's chapter 28 if I'm if I'm right.
[1:20:43] Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter
[1:20:52] Did I say chapter 28?
[1:20:57] I think I'm telling guys I'm not
[1:21:00] supposed to. It's chapter 8, not 28.
[1:21:04] Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; It's chapter 8. Listen to this now.
[1:21:09] God speaking to Noah and says chapter
[1:21:11] 20. Chapter 8 verse 22. That's where the
[1:21:14] 20 come from. Chapter 822. While the
[1:21:17] earth remainth,
[1:21:20] While the earth remainth,
[1:21:23] sea time, harvest,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; cold, heat, summer,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; winter, day, night shall not cease. It's
[1:21:36] the same thing that Solomon is saying,
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; in Ecclesiastes chapter 3, there's a
[1:21:43] time for everything.
[1:21:48] God is telling Noah as long as this
[1:21:50] earth remains.
[1:21:52] So also it bring us back to our
[1:21:55] principle. There is no one constant
[1:21:58] anointing.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; You will always have this uh you always
[1:22:03] you know there will always be this this
[1:22:05] this thing where you are you are up and
[1:22:07] down. You know that's that's what life
[1:22:09] is. It's a struggle. It's a fight.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; You just have to understand what is
[1:22:14] happening.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm going through a trial, it's
[1:22:20] not a sound of God's rejection.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why Paul would say,
[1:22:25] uh, you know, we rejoice in our tri. If
[1:22:27] you don't understand it, you will not
[1:22:29] rejoice in it.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You will not rejoice in
[1:22:35] it. God, please, you honor that
[1:22:36] anointing. You knowh is it's is it's is
[1:22:39] it's even seen in our health. It's seen
[1:22:42] in h sicknesses. We'll get there if uh
[1:22:46] if uh if we don't burn all our time yet.
[1:22:48] So we see here is the same as long as
[1:22:50] the earth remains. As long as you are in
[1:22:53] this body because this body is from the
[1:22:56] earth.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; As long as this body remains, you will
[1:23:00] always have a seeding time. There will
[1:23:03] be a time where things will be sold in
[1:23:05] your life. What I'm doing this morning,
[1:23:08] I'm planting seeds in your life.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] And you will have a harvest time.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; You will have a just is coming. Not too
[1:23:22] long.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; A cold is coming.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; You will have winter.
[1:23:30] You have day and night.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Let's get there
[1:23:35] quickly.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; There's something I want to I want to
[1:23:39] pick up from you.
[1:23:42] Are we together
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; now? So you go through, we go through
[1:23:47] all of those seasons and everything and
[1:23:50] Solomon says all of that and then he
[1:23:53] comes to this place of uh uh chapter 3
[1:24:00] verse
[1:24:02] verse 10. Let's take verse 10. He says,
[1:24:05] "I have seen a a a travel
[1:24:10] which God has given to the sons of men
[1:24:14] to be exercised in it.
[1:24:18] This is for our exercise that that our
[1:24:20] gym work here.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Your gym is to be able to understand
[1:24:26] what is happening around you.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; God has given us this thing for us to
[1:24:32] exercise ourself in it.
[1:24:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Because our destiny is determined by
[1:24:40] him.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; It's not determined by what season we
[1:24:44] are in.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's not determined by what is going on
[1:24:47] around our life. He has just given it to
[1:24:50] us for us to exercise ourself,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; exercise our mind, exercise your faith
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; to be able to understand what is
[1:25:00] happening in the moment that is
[1:25:02] happening. That is the thing that
[1:25:03] rejoice the father.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Not not not our complaints and our
[1:25:08] argument and our fusses and looking for
[1:25:10] somebody to blame and all of that. I
[1:25:12] know
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; that don't help the father.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I've seen the trial which God had given
[1:25:21] to the sons of men to be exercised in
[1:25:24] verse 11. He have made everything
[1:25:27] beautiful in his time.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. will go through all of
[1:25:32] it, but in his time
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; it will be beautiful.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Also,
[1:25:46] he has said the word.
[1:25:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; If you read in the amplifier, it says
[1:25:54] that he has put eternity
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; in the heart of men.
[1:26:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; He have set a word in their heart so
[1:26:09] that no man can find out
[1:26:14] the work that God maketh from the
[1:26:16] beginning to the end.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; We can we can we can put ourself on
[1:26:22] diet. We can put oursel on this
[1:26:25] discipline. The doctors can put you on
[1:26:27] this medication. I it's it's it's just
[1:26:33] it's just like that uh you know that
[1:26:36] that little uh uh uh thing in the
[1:26:41] vehicle where you put on it you get you
[1:26:43] get into the side of the road there push
[1:26:44] your vehicle here like this
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; it just push you back on on the lane
[1:26:49] that just all what this thing is doing
[1:26:51] it's not really determined. Amen.
[1:26:54] If you fall asleep, you're going over
[1:26:55] that road. It's not going to push you
[1:26:56] back.
[1:26:59] It reject you. If you if you are not
[1:27:00] awake, you'll find yourself somewhere
[1:27:02] else. Now, but what am I saying here is
[1:27:06] the uh God gave us these things for us
[1:27:09] to exercise ourself in. Why? Because he
[1:27:12] have placed in our hearts.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Paul says we are having
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; heavenly treasures
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; that is put in vessel. That's right.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it like this. He said, "It's
[1:27:25] a man
[1:27:28] that found a treasure in the field."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And because he found a treasure in the
[1:27:34] field, so what he did? He bought the
[1:27:36] entire field.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He bought the entire field
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; because there is a treasure in the
[1:27:44] field.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; And what is that field?
[1:27:53] All through what it's been tapping land
[1:27:55] and spaces, but now it's a people.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; It's a body.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Will thou prepare me?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; A body
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; that God has dropped a deposit of
[1:28:14] himself in.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And that we never knew about. We just
[1:28:19] thought we were uh you know what?
[1:28:21] Whoever we were, our tribe, our names,
[1:28:23] our country, whatever it is,
[1:28:26] but then the grace of God brought us to
[1:28:28] the place where something spark in our
[1:28:31] heart.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; We start to we start to have a little
[1:28:35] sense of consciousness
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; of what grace is doing around our life.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; That is the thing we need to pay
[1:28:44] attention to.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; If you just realize the Bible says when
[1:28:52] God made man, he made man in his image
[1:28:56] and God is a spirit.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; So Genesis chapter 1:26, you were made a
[1:29:02] spirit person.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; And then 2:7, he put you in flesh so you
[1:29:08] can discover who you are.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You know why people discover?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Because things are covered.
[1:29:19] Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; People make discovery of things that are
[1:29:24] cover.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So you see that is the representation
[1:29:40] we see here. Oh my god.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. I can't get this thing out of
[1:29:46] my head.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And then I realize I don't have time to
[1:29:50] say everything.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And then it's there in my head. I might
[1:29:53] go crazy.
[1:29:56] I might go crazy. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I read one thing to you and then we
[1:30:06] close.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Because if I keep you, Lord, we won't
[1:30:12] have time to
[1:30:21] If you can put my Revelation chapter 5
[1:30:24] uh uh quotes up. Let's read it together
[1:30:28] and we close. Let me close this Bible.
[1:30:32] Let me close this note
[1:30:36] and then let's just read this together
[1:30:39] so we can be able to pray.
[1:30:42] Follow me as I think it come to a time
[1:30:46] that when we have got to know how to how
[1:30:49] we stand.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; We have got to know how we stand. Paul
[1:30:54] said in Ephesians chapter 8 he said
[1:30:58] take on the whole armor of God to be
[1:31:01] able to withstand
[1:31:03] and having done this stand.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Then in verse 14 he said stand.
[1:31:10] We must know how to stand.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; How to stand.
[1:31:20] How can you do anything unless you got
[1:31:24] faith in what you are doing?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, then forget
[1:31:30] about it. It's not going to work.
[1:31:35] You have got to have faith. and and and
[1:31:37] and that is my purpose of doing this
[1:31:40] with the church here is to give the
[1:31:44] believers faith and confidence in what
[1:31:47] they are standing for
[1:31:50] because it is the word of the Lord.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Then as long as uh through the
[1:31:57] scripture sovereignly place from from
[1:32:00] Genesis to Revelation back and forth up
[1:32:02] and down
[1:32:04] not a way for the devil to move in there
[1:32:08] and away then then you've got perfect
[1:32:11] confidence.
[1:32:13] Praise the Lord. Knowing where you are
[1:32:16] standing because you you you have been
[1:32:18] able to look at it thoroughly through
[1:32:20] the word of God. what I'm doing, my
[1:32:24] choices.
[1:32:26] Is this thing the word of God or I'm
[1:32:27] just only pleasing myself?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I'm just stuck on a on a on a on an
[1:32:33] attitude or stuck on a on a habit
[1:32:37] and then find some kind of a thing uh uh
[1:32:39] uh uh some kind of a uh uh Bible verse
[1:32:43] or man concept
[1:32:46] to appease myself to back myself up. No,
[1:32:48] it must be it must be thoroughly looked
[1:32:51] at through the word of God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Something will be like our sister here
[1:33:04] that is in a wheelchair or maybe others
[1:33:07] that are sick and afflicted. You can you
[1:33:11] can have perfect understanding. Listen
[1:33:12] to this. I I was looking for this for
[1:33:15] the long time because I I had it
[1:33:17] somewhere and then uh I couldn't find it
[1:33:19] but it was it was beautiful when I saw
[1:33:21] it. You can have perfect understanding
[1:33:24] that is God's good pleasure to make you
[1:33:28] well. There isn't enough devil in the
[1:33:32] country to keep you sick. Now listen to
[1:33:34] this now. Listen to this. Because the
[1:33:37] person is sick.
[1:33:39] She's in the wheelchair,
[1:33:42] but she's been she's been encouraged to
[1:33:45] have perfect understanding that it is
[1:33:48] not God desire
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; for me to be in this wheelchair.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Having that understanding
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; creates something in her
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; to stand up.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. She might try to,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; she can make it. But she's saying to
[1:34:07] herself, it is not my God's desire
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; for me to be in this wheelchair.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; She's having a perfect understanding.
[1:34:20] Even though her body has not come to
[1:34:22] that place,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; even though
[1:34:25] things are all in her body,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. But she stole a place
[1:34:31] of perfect understanding.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; This is not an automatic thing.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; It's a principle.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; It's a principle.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Look at look at that that that little
[1:34:54] old woman we showed this morning. She
[1:34:56] was not bad. You came in. Came and go to
[1:34:58] heaven.
[1:35:00] and then you go to hell.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; She was not terrified
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; because she have resolved in her heart
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; that if death meet her today,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, she's going to heaven.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Whether it is by an accident, whether is
[1:35:17] you want to send me quicker,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord, or whether is she has
[1:35:21] resolved in her heart
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; that wherever death meets her,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; she's going to heaven.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; It's a settled thing for her. That's
[1:35:28] right.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; It's an understanding.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus puzzle an Nicodemus. You being a
[1:35:44] preacher, a scholar, and you don't
[1:35:45] understand these things.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Then what is driving your faith? It's
[1:35:51] just your creed and dogma.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You are doing things to please the
[1:35:55] church. It's not real to you.
[1:35:59] He said you being a rabbi, you don't
[1:36:01] understand this thing.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That is the power of understanding which
[1:36:10] is not knowledge. It's different.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You read proverb, you see Paul, I
[1:36:18] mean Solomon, he brings out three
[1:36:20] things. Wisdom,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; knowledge,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; and understanding.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; The worst of the three is knowledge
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; because Paul tells you that knowledge
[1:36:33] puff up.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Is very proud.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Like the sister
[1:36:49] here in the wheelchair or maybe others
[1:36:52] that are sick and afflicted. If you have
[1:36:54] a perfect understanding that it is not
[1:36:57] God's good pleasure,

[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Let this mind be in you
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; If we can just work on our mind, direct
[1:38:39] our mind in the right places,
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; think on the right things.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.

[1:38:52] pleasure to make you well,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; that he has did it for you. It's already
[1:38:58] done.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not like when we pray
[1:39:05] now, let's pray. Let's pray for this
[1:39:06] brother. And when we pray now, then God
[1:39:09] will not say, "Okay, angels, they are
[1:39:11] finished praying. I just saw good
[1:39:12] shepherd pray for that brother.

[1:39:20] morning, you come to him, he will say,
[1:39:22] "I've already done it."
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; It is for you to understand it
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; and accept it.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And begin to step into it because it's
[1:39:34] already done.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; So you stop begging God.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; He's already done it. is for you to
[1:39:48] believe it
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; and condition your mind
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; to constantly tell yourself, "It's
[1:39:54] already done.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; It's a finished work."
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Satan, I don't care what you say is
[1:39:59] already done.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I need grace daily to walk into it.
[1:40:12] He did it for you and you understand
[1:40:14] that how that you are you are to go to
[1:40:18] do a certain thing. It's like this. If I
[1:40:21] told you with all of my heart, you were
[1:40:24] hungry and starving to death and and and
[1:40:27] and and you had a supreme confidence in
[1:40:30] me as a a truthful person. And I told
[1:40:33] you where there was a thousand dollar
[1:40:36] laying. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; How you did get it,
[1:40:41] what what road you will go, exactly
[1:40:44] where to go. You know, as I was reading
[1:40:46] this, I was thinking of a bird down
[1:40:48] testimony. I was in the office.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I was saying to myself, I
[1:40:55] was
[1:40:56] say, "If I find this money, I will
[1:40:58] testify."
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I find this money, that
[1:41:04] desperation people
[1:41:07] Praise.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord is good. Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was talking with a
[1:41:21] brother. We were, you know, just having
[1:41:23] some conversation and you know, it was
[1:41:25] almost like, you know, some people
[1:41:26] testify and then you send them, you send
[1:41:28] the deacons to come and take them off
[1:41:30] there and cut their testimony. Now we
[1:41:33] just had that conversation and here to
[1:41:34] deacon giving his testimony. He's
[1:41:37] thinking all the time I'm saying there
[1:41:38] Lord Jesus.
[1:41:41] Oh father.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Oh praise the Lord. Glory be to God.
[1:41:49] I said they're going to chew me on this
[1:41:51] one again.
[1:41:54] But you see that like I always say I've
[1:41:56] been bored. I've been fried. I've been
[1:41:58] roasted.
[1:42:00] They have some driving.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; So I don't know what you would do that
[1:42:07] would deter me. But just love me. Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; And bear with me
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; like this. If I told you that there is a
[1:42:15] $1,000 and you go get it, the road you
[1:42:18] will take exactly where to go and you
[1:42:21] understand exactly where the money is
[1:42:24] laid. See? Then will you start rejoicing
[1:42:28] right then? For sure. Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Just the same as you have the money if
[1:42:33] you believe me. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; The thing about it there, sir, the thing
[1:42:38] about it there is that you will not even
[1:42:41] go to that place.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; If you believe me, you will not go. You
[1:42:46] you already know it's there. So, you go
[1:42:48] do some other things
[1:42:51] because you know it's there. Yeah.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; The the weight
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; of your knee will just vanish.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; If you were desperately looking and and
[1:43:03] and searching, that weight will just
[1:43:06] vanish.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:15] You see before you ever get there feel
[1:43:18] any different or anything else you can
[1:43:20] you can just as uh happen over your
[1:43:24] healing in saying
[1:43:27] you got it because
[1:43:29] you are positive show you got it because
[1:43:33] you got confidence in the one that
[1:43:36] promising to you. Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Your confidence
[1:43:41] is that he cannot lie.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And he and he told you exactly where it
[1:43:47] was lame. Amen. You got confidence that
[1:43:50] you are you are going. You got it
[1:43:53] already because that your faith wish is
[1:43:57] the earnest of your redemption. Yeah.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, you are trying
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; to be redeemed from sickness and your
[1:44:07] faith is the substance
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; of that bless or rather is the earnest
[1:44:13] of your healing.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; As long as as something says in your
[1:44:18] heart, I am the Lord that heals you.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You can rest assure you will walk out of
[1:44:25] it.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:29] musicians you can come
[1:44:32] that's just as good.
[1:44:34] Oh, you can start just as happy no
[1:44:38] matter what happen. But you see the
[1:44:40] thing about it is that it's hard for us
[1:44:43] to raise our faith above our symptoms.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the symptoms is there. The
[1:44:50] symptoms get a hold of us and you think
[1:44:53] that you don't have faith but it's
[1:44:54] there. It's live.
[1:44:59] It's hard for you to hard for you to
[1:45:01] channel it.
