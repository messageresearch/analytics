[3:30] to lot you 25 years you're not going to
[3:33] get feeble you be able to go and I'm
[3:35] going to lot you 25 years on Earth would
[3:37] you take from from birth to 25 or from
[3:40] 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 to 100 now any
[3:44] man is looted any time on Earth will
[3:47] certainly do a most rational thing if
[3:49] you don't spend that time in service of
[3:51] God I don't care what he does if you're
[3:53] going to be a heartbreak for the women
[3:56] or so forth you better take that young
[3:58] age that first 25
[4:00] if you're going to be a carpenter a
[4:01] mechanic or something you better take
[4:03] the second 25 see but I was thinking
[4:05] about what about me what would I take
[4:08] I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be smarter
[4:12] wiser I'd be more settled I know more
[4:15] about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight or 10
[4:18] years older than the last time I was
[4:19] overseas I won't jump in like I'm
[4:21] killing snakes I know more about it too
[4:23] I know how is it like a dog
[4:25] fighting the see you know about how
[4:28] to take a hold of you don't jump in
[4:29] there scatch you up know his tricks and
[4:32] watch him what he does and we learn more
[4:34] about the enemy so we've got to find out
[4:37] all his techniques and how he approaches
[4:39] and what he does learn his punches and
[4:42] you're trained to go on you see so I
[4:44] believe now I told life I believe I'm
[4:46] better shape out of us when it's 40
[4:48] years old and one over I'm 54 now I
[4:51] believe if I live and can still get
[4:52] around as good as can not when I'm a 100
[4:55] if I if Jesus would carry that long I'd
[4:57] be in better shape than I am now to go
[4:59] because you know more about it you know
[5:01] more about what to do and how to handle
[5:03] it how to handle the situation take a
[5:06] lot of people out if you're going to get
[5:07] operated on say say a new doctor just
[5:09] graduated the other day and just come
[5:10] out of medical school you never had an
[5:12] operation yet let him do it oh no you
[5:15] say nothing to it not that guy no sir
[5:20] yet I don't want him putting no knife on
[5:23] me I'd really to go down here and get so
[5:25] and so I know he's had a lot of
[5:27] operations he knows how to do it
[5:30] that's that's you think about this but
[5:33] what about that soul I want somebody who
[5:36] knows where they're at know the road
[5:38] who's traveling yes indeed Lord bless
[5:42] you all right brother n get up here now
[5:44] God bless brother
[5:45] n don't forget now next time I was just
[5:50] uh had a surprise in my heart for the
[5:54] thing because in myself I had recognized
[5:57] I esteemed the min Ministry of my many
[6:01] Brethren outside of there before brother
[6:04] Brandon come I said I don't know is
[6:06] he'll Minister tonight I was talking to
[6:08] Dr Lee ve here and I said I was in the
[6:12] meeting at Middletown Ohio and you were
[6:14] the one that talked through the day and
[6:17] I said I deeply appreciated the meeting
[6:20] along with the teaching at brother veale
[6:22] did over there in conjunction with the
[6:25] meeting at Middletown yes and I said I
[6:27] esteem the Servants of God and uh one of
[6:31] us I said whoever preaches it always
[6:34] does the other one good because the
[6:36] ministry is all inspired by the same
[6:38] spirit amen and uh there isn't any any
[6:42] selfishness or ambitiousness in me and I
[6:45] Delight to welcome the Ministers of God
[6:48] especially who are cooperating together
[6:51] with this and in it together with us I
[6:54] Delight to hear from them amen so I
[6:57] asked Dr Lee Vale I said would you
[6:59] Minister if brother brandham doesn't
[7:02] brother brandham didn't he might have
[7:04] known this didn't say
[7:06] anything and so I asked brother Vale
[7:10] tonight if he would Minister for us in
[7:13] case that brother brandham didn't
[7:15] because he's associated with him in the
[7:17] meetings and he knows about the way this
[7:20] way and we're glad to have brother Veil
[7:23] I appreciate him and respect him as well
[7:25] as I do any of the other ministers and
[7:28] like I do all the others so if he will
[7:30] come tonight and speak for us I'd be
[7:32] delighted to have him to do it God bless
[7:35] and let's pray for brother Vale some of
[7:37] you have never heard him and I trust
[7:39] that you'll pray for
[7:44] him I apologize to you audience I didn't
[7:47] know sat there did this was fixed up God
[7:49] bless you brother the day it wasn't
[7:50] fixed up he said if you didn't come came
[7:54] good that's fine I can hear him myself
[7:56] brother B spoke him anytime IE of in the
[7:58] meetings and and so forth he managed the
[8:00] meetings for a long time and fine
[8:02] Brother done a swell job and I'm sure
[8:05] this audience is always glad to hear
[8:06] Brother B when he speak Lord
[8:14] blessy so much was said uh I couldn't
[8:18] say nothing to make it any better and I
[8:21] truly believe that it was the Lord that
[8:25] worked this out for brother Veil to
[8:27] bring this man amen after this morning
[8:30] yes so do I you see it has to work that
[8:33] way we we accept that from God yes well
[8:36] there's so many things he saying I I I
[8:38] have 20 sermons go down here off what he
[8:41] said I was thinking here of one little
[8:43] illustration to back up what he said now
[8:47] we look at this watch to find out what
[8:49] time it is unless that every instrument
[8:52] in that watch is coordinating one with
[8:55] the other we'll never know the correct
[8:56] time amen is that right yeah and that
[8:59] takes all of us all together if we want
[9:02] to see the third pool really do
[9:04] something for God it's coordination with
[9:06] every one of us together to Humble
[9:08] ourselves before God and confess our
[9:11] wrongs and pray and believe God for
[9:14] these things I truly believe that what
[9:17] brother Bale said is the truth that God
[9:20] will never put his spirit in un holy
[9:23] unrighteous disobedient
[9:25] temples it's got to come in the the way
[9:29] of the cleansing of our hearts from all
[9:32] G and iniquity that we might be pure
[9:35] before God that he might work his pure
[9:38] Holy Spirit through us to bring these
[9:40] things to pass I I think that when you
[9:43] go home tonight if you would read that
[9:45] little book of Jude you just learn a
[9:46] whole lot now of what brother Bale has
[9:49] said and he said and I earnestly contend
[9:52] for the faith that was once delivered to
[9:55] the saints that got away from it how a
[9:57] man of corrupt mind and and so forth to
[9:59] come in and begal him away from the from
[10:02] the real things of God and God can only
[10:06] operate as we let him operate and so
[10:10] many wonderful things about saying you
[10:13] know people are want power and really
[10:16] they don't know what power is amen they
[10:19] don't really know what what what goes
[10:21] with it the the Way Up Is Down always
[10:25] you if you want Power see how humble you
[10:28] can get just get away from all your
[10:31] worried thinking and humble yourself
[10:33] before God and then you got more power
[10:36] than the man that runs all over the
[10:37] building and makes a big lot of
[10:39] noise because you have been able to
[10:42] conquer yourself and commit yourself to
[10:45] Christ see to humble yourself before him
[10:48] that's really power you show me a church
[10:51] that's humbled real humble not a a
[10:56] irant a church just a sweet humble
[10:59] church I'll show you a church that has
[11:01] the favor and power of God Amen that's
[11:03] right that's the thing it takes hum
[11:05] humility huming ourselves before God
[11:08] letting God just work to us don't have
[11:11] to make a lot of
[11:12] noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he
[11:16] went out to the field with his wagon and
[11:18] every time he hit a bump it just rattled
[11:20] and went on but when he come back he hit
[11:22] the same bup didn't make no noise at all
[11:24] because it's loaded with good things so
[11:26] I think that's about right that we get
[11:29] filled up with the good things of God
[11:32] that the fruit of the spirit might be
[11:34] known through us as he referred so much
[11:36] to First Corinthians 13 there how that
[11:39] though I get my body be burnt and have
[11:40] all these things and have not charity
[11:43] it's nothing profits mean nothing you
[11:44] see we want to do that above all things
[11:47] it's our individual Souls that we're
[11:50] responsible before God see it's it's you
[11:53] going to have it it isn't whether I go
[11:56] or he goes It's You Going see it you
[11:59] first and you've got to look this out
[12:01] and come sweet before the Lord and I've
[12:03] always found out that the man that
[12:05] humbles himself is a man that God exalts
[12:08] when you take a person with his chest
[12:10] out knows everything and you can't tell
[12:13] him nothing and he's arrogant and and
[12:15] well that that's a person that never
[12:16] gets anywhere but you take that person
[12:19] that humbles themselves and walks
[12:20] sweetly I was talking to a man to a date
[12:23] just organized the church up at the uh
[12:26] uh pulled out of an organization that
[12:28] had been uh what brother Bose and then
[12:31] church where they they had that great
[12:34] church there for so long and the Lord is
[12:36] Blessing and the people got to a place
[12:37] that they want to polish up like the
[12:39] rest of them and want to throw it into
[12:41] an organization and when they did it
[12:43] just those humble Christians in there
[12:45] did not want that all their life had
[12:47] been taught against it so they walked
[12:49] away from it now they've got a group and
[12:51] the Lord has blessed them until they're
[12:53] coming in up into a big place now again
[12:56] bought a church now that puts up about 4
[12:58] 5,000 people and they're starting over
[13:01] and they come to me and said brother BR
[13:03] sitting right there in in the office of
[13:06] the church office the other day and he
[13:08] said uh one of the leaders that the
[13:09] Closs and them said what must we do I
[13:12] said find a man to be the Shepherd that
[13:15] has no reputation in all denomination
[13:18] just a real good Janine sweet humble
[13:21] brother that lives Alive God will take
[13:23] care of the rest of us I said a good
[13:26] pastor that feed the sheep and be hung
[13:29] and than God will do the rest if you not
[13:31] some big know it all is coming he's
[13:33] going to put this in order and this has
[13:35] to be this way and cutting things eyes
[13:37] it'll never work you just got through it
[13:39] that's it every piece in the church must
[13:42] work together and you must keep up your
[13:44] part of it so we can see what time we're
[13:47] living in we may be closer than we think
[13:49] we are now we appreciate brother the
[13:51] veil don't we amen Lord bless you
[13:53] brother thank you and we thank the Lord
[13:55] for bringing this great message to us
[13:57] tonight and this uh got a note a few
[13:59] minutes ago one of the sisters and had
[14:01] something she wanted to tell in a dream
[14:04] of you just write it out tell me sister
[14:05] I um The Giver some dreams that has been
[14:08] absolutely true we don't accept all
[14:10] dreams no no but when they of God we
[14:13] want to know it it's God talking to it
[14:15] like everything speaks the tongues we
[14:16] don't believe it but when there's an
[14:18] interpretation comes that tells us
[14:19] something that's going to happen we see
[14:21] it happen and we thank the Lord for see
[14:23] we want to keep it running smoothly
[14:25] sweetly in an order uh of the Lord so
[14:27] just remember that your part may be the
[14:29] main spring or it may be the little uh
[14:33] some little hand or some little part of
[14:35] the winding stem whatever it may be or
[14:37] it may be the hands on the face the
[14:39] clock it tells the time but whatever it
[14:41] is it takes us all working together in
[14:43] harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[14:46] to bring this to fa just think if gifts
[14:49] is so great what we call power and Paul
[14:52] said though I have faith that I can move
[14:54] them
[14:55] on and have not charity I am nothing
[15:00] amen amen think of that and though you
[15:03] say well though I I understand I wish
[15:06] trying know the Bible though I
[15:08] understand all the mysteries of God see
[15:12] and still though I could do it and have
[15:14] not charity I I'm nothing see I haven't
[15:17] got no wor yet see the main thing is
[15:20] love God and humble yourself with it I
[15:23] surely uh after all these years on the
[15:27] field and around the world and seen
[15:29] different people I ought know a little
[15:31] bit about the gate to enter in at and if
[15:33] you want to get somewhere with God never
[15:36] let a irran spirit ever come around you
[15:40] don't let No Malice come in no matter
[15:43] what anybody's done if they are wrong
[15:45] don't you never build up a complex
[15:47] against that person see you'd be sweet
[15:49] and kind remember God loved you when you
[15:52] were in sin and if the spirit of God's
[15:54] in you you love the other person when
[15:56] he's in wrong just pray for them and
[15:59] love one another above everything love
[16:01] God and love one another and be humble
[16:04] with God and around one another and God
[16:06] will bless us and it's hard tell what he
[16:08] will do usually when Church begins to
[16:10] get in numbers and get to getting a
[16:12] little bigger or something like that
[16:13] then they get away from that real things
[16:15] the real things you know what brought
[16:17] these things to pass when I first
[16:19] started the Lord appeared to me down the
[16:21] river and told me that his brother B saw
[16:23] that I believe in the paper in Canada
[16:25] many years ago where that angel of the
[16:26] Lord appeared on the river down there is
[16:28] on the social sh press Mystic light over
[16:30] a local minister of wild bapti and and
[16:34] you know what did that when we had the
[16:36] tent meeting just across the street a
[16:39] tent that seated about or 2 200 people
[16:42] ministers come from a war and said
[16:43] brother come here minut not just a boy
[16:46] but or just a kid and he said how do you
[16:50] keep those people in one Accord they
[16:52] love one another till they I never seen
[16:54] people love one another that's the Lord
[16:57] that's what this church was established
[16:59] upon that Godly brotherly love for one
[17:03] another I see them even shake hands to
[17:05] one another leaving the place and cry
[17:07] like babies believe one another they
[17:09] love one another that well and I could
[17:12] go to their house to visit them and
[17:14] times the Bible was laying open and
[17:16] stain with tears coming at night time
[17:19] where fathers and mothers was gathered
[17:20] together and their little children
[17:23] around on the floor kneeling around and
[17:25] fathers and mothers on their knees
[17:27] crying and praying stand at the door and
[17:29] wait and wait and wait and they didn't
[17:31] stop praying I just sat down on the
[17:32] steps and start praying myself waiting
[17:34] for see and that that was and they love
[17:37] one another they love one another we
[17:40] used to stand and sing that old song
[17:41] blessed be the ti that binds our hearts
[17:44] in Christian love a fellowship of
[17:46] kindered mind is like to that above when
[17:48] we are Sunder part it gives us inward
[17:51] pain but we shall still be Jin in heart
[17:54] and hope to meet again I say this with
[17:56] great joy in my heart to Christ life
[17:58] many of them are sleeping around in
[18:00] these Graves marks and I waiting for
[18:02] that great Resurrection where we'll meet
[18:04] together again let not that Spirit ever
[18:07] depart from this place if it ever does
[18:09] then I don't care how eloquent your
[18:11] pastor might be how well he might bring
[18:13] the word of God the spirit of God is
[18:15] grieved away when we can have all things
[18:18] in Fellowship in common love one another
[18:22] then God will work with us and we're
[18:24] keeping time that the people come by and
[18:26] say if you want to see a church that's
[18:27] really
[18:28] a church that really loves God dropping
[18:30] up there at that Tabernacle one time and
[18:32] watch them look at the care they have
[18:34] for one another the respect when the
[18:37] gospel is being preached how rever how
[18:39] everything just in order that's then
[18:41] they can look and see what time we're
[18:43] living you'll see the spirit of God
[18:44] moving among you great signs and wonders
[18:47] and things will be taking place if the
[18:49] things working together it's telling the
[18:51] time but if it isn't working then time
[18:54] is stopped it won't tell the time no
[18:56] more so if we want to know what time
[18:58] time we're living just start everybody
[19:00] working together in the gospel loving
[19:02] one another loving God and the hands
