Jesus and once again we want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers and your support supporting us alone in this time of the homegoing of her mother and as I said on Wednesday night we had a good funeral service and I braved myself up doing all the when I got home and the entire fina room until when when the neighbors and some of our acquaintance started to give you a tribute then I couldn't hold myself anymore praise the Lord just to see how in a little way her life touched the life of many and like I said all the brothers from home many of the churches were represented and some of our friends from the African and Nigeria also came to support us but Aaron but I Aaron represented guseva fellowship [Laughter] because the Holi in the program a tribute from ghost chef of fellowship and then he came running quickly to me should I go there I said we would go there I can go there praise the Lord brought Johnny wife was also there and so she came up also and gave a tribute on behalf of her husband and the friendship that we have with him praise the Lord but I mean really experience law from the hearts of God's people around this time and I think the Lord knew that I need a praise the Lord yeah I think he knew that I needed it because I don't know for some reason the homegoing of my mom touched me like nothing has touched me I can I don't know why but that's that's the way that fair but everything went well the brothers when I got home that's the first thing I let him know I was not on a missionary trip I was on a family training so you can keep all your preaching program I'm not going to preach praise the Lord so but we had a time to to stop by that brother lodges church on a Wednesday night because he was hosting the brothers that came from out of the country but volunteering from the Abacos brother Gideon and brother family Joseph from Nigeria so I needed I thought we wise to go there and tank the church for also hosting those brothers for us and then so we preached for them they're knighting and I thought that was going to be all a good friend of mine many years ago that the lord help us to kanafeh leading to to the law now really to the law because he was an old preacher but we were able to help him to to see the message of the hour he was all Pentecostal preacher the first time I saw this brother was on a crusade I was preaching for one friend of mine you know we were in an area where our church message church was the only message church there so I was a friend to a lot of denomination of preachers so they will always invite me when they are having special meetings I was looking like the little Devi in town so so I was preaching for this brother and this this friend of mine now he was playing the bass guitar he's a very good musician so I got attracted to the way he was playing but we never make no contact and it turned out to be he was an instructor told a brother that was leading songs for us those years and he got a hold of the Lord God spoken magazine and the subject of 7c caught his attention and he wanted to know more and and then he started coming to church with us but he had his assembly so once in a while he would go go to church whenever we are having services he will come over but then when he came on the subject of communion one evening we were having convenient and he decided to come and he and his pastor and and some of the brothers from their church came in we had an open convenience so they partook of the convenient then it was tracking to them there we were using wine because they have always used grape juice so after the service it became a conversation as to what about the scriptures of wine you know and I mean why should we change it to a grape juice you know and a kind of a struck him how you know the importance of taking the world just as a series so he and his pastor got into a little you know no we can do that in he says about it that's what the worse is that's what I'm going to do and that's how he got he got attracted to the message so when he went back home it was a little bit different you know because sometimes you know it's a tough thing when people started preaching and started believing before they they become exposed to the message many times some preachers would think that you know the person didn't had a ministry they need to sit down in order there so he went back home and he started having some challenges for all the years even from the Ivory Coast we've been I've been supporting him because I knew the kind of a man he was and the heart that he had for the Lord so he went in a little area doing a kind of a private work there so Saturday he came to call me for me to go and see his family you know you know he's older than me but you know he called me his father in the Lord and I don't I don't like that because he's older than me praise the Lord so I don't think I should be having children before I was born you know so we went there and he caught me off guard because he never told me anything he had a little church gather Saturday morning and told him we were going to have a little service so let me dress her in James and my t-shirt running up the hill and the people are sitting waiting for service why he never told me you know so we had a time to to be able to speak to them there was the second message group that we spoke to but after the before the funeral the brothers that came came over to visit with us as a family I had introduced them to my brother and wish of course he knew brother Elijah and some of the brothers so while we were sitting together and my brother being a Baptist preacher he said to the brothers he said well I hope some of you came with an astronaut because I would want one of you guys to preach so I kept quiet and you know and we all laughed about it but you know strangely enough I thought as well this is an opportunity you know if he's if he's asking these brothers to preacher you know I hope one of them would jump on it and become the witness but I think brother Elijah has already engaged the brothers in in in in preaching appointment so so none of them were able to take up it so I said well okay I think I would have to do with this time so I never told my brother I was going to do with though I just told him I says well you know Elijah has have already arranged for these brothers before they came to the country but after we left we all were talking about it but I felt a little bit disappointed because one of the brothers said I'm a denomination what am I going to preach day that just dropped my spirit and because of their statement I say I'm going to preach I'm going to prepare myself if the opportunity come I will preach praise the Lord so after the funeral I had go and tell the church thank you because they the one hosted us I mainly did extremely well man I mean appalled all that support behind here pastored the women in the sisters took care of the food I mean the fair over I mean over 500 people you know when I mean I just I just fell yeah I need I need to thank these people so the first Sunday I went and just thanked them and they were having youth appreciation and and one of the young men in their church bridge and then the next Sunday I was brother wanted me to preach for him I told him no I would not I would not I would not preached and and then my brother's announces well if I mean all your friends are already been booked so I think you will have to speak I said well okay I think you know maybe that's the way the law 1:8 but I have a brother-in-law there's the sister of mine that TT is nesto and he passed to the church - so he came to ask me if I could preach for him I told him I said well I will be you know preaching for reveries at the Baptist Church so well we were having conversation then he told me is I mean just in the conversation he never said it directly he said okay we will go I mean eight o clock that's the first service and then ten o clock is the second service I said oh they have a alimony service so I would take the eight o clock service so I went you know I went call him up on the phone I said well I would take up your invitation he's actually the assistant pastor day his posture was not around but he taught the other it would have been good for me to come and speak for them so my last one it was busy I had an 8 o'clock service and preached for the five minutes and then I went over to the Baptist Church and preached and the thing that was beautiful is that or the Lord kind of a bless the little thought we had and we had a soul that gave me a heart to the Lord and they I rejoiced my heart praise the Lord and and out of out of the I mean we met in a weekend then the brother was asking me how you did it I said well I think it's one of the easiest places to preach you know it's one of the easier place to preach because little I shine bright in the most darkest place so we just took a little tottering and the people were blessed and they wanted us to come in and do teaching service for them I told them well we don't have the time we will do it sometime in the future but I was glad for the souls I gave their heart to the Lord Amy Amy and I just a spoke from Genesis chapter 1 and I show their every day God did something good that was just oh I preach we keep looking at the devil and the evil that is happening well in every day that God gives you there is something good that is happening praise the Lord if you can find a good you will find God praise the Lord so we we had that in we thought we would have gone over to the other coast to visit but it did not work out for one reason or another I just fell like one it was going to be expensive I felt like you know spending over a thousand dollars just for three days was not worthy so I will just come back home and maybe look for another time to go praise the Lord but your prayers were very helpful to us and I mean we bring greetings from all the Saints there they all send their greetings any one of us to let you know that the appreciate each and every one of you praise the Lord Amen guru cebra lord amen amen praise the Lord and our youth meeting is next week Saturday are we ready for their young people amen just to remind you you got the the announcement where we would be meeting if you if you did not you should find out from brother Jordan after the service praise the Lord amen and this warning now spoke with brother hoped and Frederic hope is not feeling well and so he want us to remember him in prayer and and then because Frederic normally comes with hope so he could not come I think Jews have got here before he called but we were he was just talking to me he says well I just wanted to call you and you know and just have you pray for me since I can be able to make it to the service and I think the Lord been dealing with his heart amen with the different things that is happening around his life and he told me this morning that you want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we want to thank the Lord for their amen praise the Lord you know brother Jordan preached Wednesday night you know you know Christ demanding fruit and the season were you know there is not enough fruits that are coming for praise the Lord so we are glad to be having these baptismal services that are springing forth amen witness the video or sister kimberlyn being baptized and I want to thank you brothers you know for standing in a gap and standing with our sister to fight against the enemy praise the Lord thank you better Dan in Jordan for many story to the people and you know I just thought about you know the the Deaf case that Brandon Tabernacle had one time when brother Branham was away you know there was a situation in the church and then brother and evil and the brothers gathered together you know the Bourbon I felt so proud you know he fair proud that to realize that the people I understanding is not a one-man ministry you know it's a body ministry praise the Lord Amen so when when the church begins to understand that then quickly we all can find our place in the body because we know that God is ready to use each and every one of us praise the Lord so we thank the Lord for their amen and just like I said I get up here and then everything goes away from my head so let's

the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord I share this with you you know when these things happen you know when things will happen in the world and sometimes you know you think about it it runs through your mind and I just thought about it yesterday last night I was laying down in and just thinking about you know because I've kind of a been thinking about it as well you know this thing is less strange - to the believers because we know that this is a product of an Exeter Amen before we get out of here there are pledges that must plague the word Amen you know so you know it's it's not strange to the believer but then I was thinking about it last night sis Isis you just think about it how many churches this morning going to close their doors and said because of the coronavirus we're now going to have service hey everybody stay home and just be safe praise the Lord we know the building is not the safest place but the reason why we are here is the serious place praise the Lord Amen if anything should happen if there should be a florid there should be an earthquake I believe we are sitting in the most serious place this morning honor the promise of God's Word praise the Lord because it's injures honey come about us so like I would normally do I said well okay let me go in let me go and check some things and see if I can you know and then I got a news feed on my phone that same Indies news they are bishop hab there is encouraging parishes to sustain the sign of peace or offer it without touching well I don't know whether it is the one they have to do like this so which one is the sign of peace but he's encouraging these people in order to either suspended or to offer it without touching so Spain drinking communion wine from the I mean I kinda thought about this if if today was our communion service how many people who stayed away from convenient because the thing were of coronavirus yesterday admission is suspending convenient you know the drinking of the communion wine and refrain from holding hands during the praying of their our Father the Lost Prayer you know nobody should hold hands because it's not safe do you I mean you do we see the kind of word that we are living in and how many souls are sitting all their system that are taking the people far away from God praise the Lord I mean if even cancer is eating all of our body I believe we can be just like those lepers in the date of Elijah amen praise the Lord they were the one that brought revival to Israel they were the one that brought healing because there was death in the land and God used those people with the poorest health condition to be able to bring salvation to the people than mediate the robber Jeremiah found says the temple of Eron is also adjusting its practice because of the virus the community will not kiss religious items you know that the Jews the case the Torah and in the case the different things the case so you are trying to tell us that everything is affected now praise the Lord they're not going to kiss the Torah and they're not going to give the holy cases and and I mean the community we're not kids religious item including the Saffir Torah for you know for whatever reason and they will also limit handshaking and shearing fools and and and they were I mean and they will never have I mean convenient College is one of the idea their racial that they do or their services that do over there are the synagogue and I were just thinking last night about all of this so what a world are we living in where is our hope praise the Lord when the men are supposed to be their religious man the the leaders of the people who bring us to this place amen they even the lost prayer that is called the family prayer where we supposed to hold our hands and leave our house up to God who say because of what is happening you know we will not hold hands and we when I shake hands and says God bless you and and every one of you but we want to talk this morning on Jam warfare just to tell you there until you are in Christ you are now safe what are you bathe yourself with Clorox or sanitize your hands and sanitize your feet brush your teeth with senator until you are in Christ baptized with the Holy Ghost you are not saved praise the Lord if the world cannot see that we are we are fixing an Exeter Amen I mean that is the thing that should make us to clean our lives clean our homes get away from the television and start seeking God on our face getting close to God wanting more of God in our life because I'm telling you is going to go from worse to worse amen it was Ebola Nana's Corona is going to be something else another time because all of these things is produced by men themself praise the Lord but I was thinking about this in a tabernacle when Israel goes to wash it they take the sacrifice and there is a part of the sacrifice that must be burned and now you think about this now what they call the burnt offering what was used as the burnt offering was the bitter part of the sacrifice amen and that's what God wants us your burnt offering your anger your vest ation your hate train and all of those things that's what he wants you to burn to offer to him the better product the inner part of the animal was what was burned and went and and and they got there to the brazen altar and they take their ashes of the burnt offering and miss it with water praise praise the Lord and they bring their ashes back into the tabernacle they put it put a house up into the ashes and they sprinkle it on the people praise the Lord you know I was thinking about that and it reminds me about about job the scripture tells us that job who normally burn offering for his children amen he will always make a burn off you always make sacrifice he had a place in his home or in his compound where you always go it was a sacred place when he thinks about his children or he thinks about his neighbor or he thinks about something that he needs to bring to God he would go to that place and he would burn their offering him and make a sacrifice to the Lord but then we realized when job had his own audio when he had his own a Trier that came upon him there was nowhere safe for job to God but to go right on the Attucks all the offering that he has burned and he took the ashes of the burnt offering and he spread it over herself he spread he identified himself with the sacrifice that he had made night overnight days over there praise the law the Bible says I hire in the temple when he he after you seer has died and his earthly influence was gone he needed to get close to God he went in the temple and the Bible says he left his head to the Lord he said O God what is mean I'm a man of done among people speaking lies and he just pulled his heart out before God praise the Lord amen and the Bible says one of the angels of the law of the Serafini Amen took a call from the altar praise the Lord so you see the very thing that you give to God in sacrifice in worship in obedience he takes that very thing back and he sent it to you for your protection praise the Lord if you give your life to serving God and dedication it's not for the man it's not for the name of a church praise the Lord God think that very thing he sent it back to you and one of those angels took a life called from the altar and came and touched the prophets lake why because he has pour his heart out praise the Lord he has pour his heart out he has he has made confession to the

to doom days we look into eruption praise the Lord we say come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus come one man because we'll be out of here in no time praise the Lord Amen glory be to God hallelujah let me just share some some I don't know well record here with you as the coronavirus continuing to spread China will not take such inhuman measure to eliminate the entire population of the city of how to calculate you harm or how to pronounce it no it is accused of taking colorful measure now you see that I was I was a taught about this and I started trying to because there was there was a there was a news that I better pick up sometime when this whole thing was was going on and they were talking about you know a kind of hell biological warfare in in or death and just couple of months back sometime last year we heard in the news how a Chinese doctor was able to take I don't know what he was doing in a lie buried and and the whole world was against it you know trying to to to make another human you know in order death and and at least me this man spend all of this time in the laboratory and I mean we are testing this in the air testing base they are faking this jam from this place and taking this order Jame from this place and they are breathing this jam and they are breathing this jam and when you look through this record I'm giving you it has been proven by history that man has always done man has always brought the evil that come upon him praise the Lord man has always brought the evil history record shows the far back in in 400 BC I may have personal enemies wealth in person arrows history also recorded in it the 18th century American and British colonist gave small parts infected blankets to native Native American wave their intention to kill them with an epidemic then during the World War one a Germany developed I mean all of these things all of these things our lives are in the hands of cruel men praise the Lord our lives are in the hands of cool remain high weed fungus analogous prayer plagues in st. Petersburg in Russia and after the end of world war one nation agreed on Geneva Protocol to cartel biological weapons yet during the world war ii german and japan branch in america they disregarded our protocol they are men it used to be there were men they were keeping their heads between their knees asking for the power of God to touch a city there were men that were laying flat on their face seeking God just like the Jeremiah of all he spent couple of days on one of his side and couple of days on another side interceding for the evil that is done but now we have men that are having sleepless night to see how much evil they can bring to the world praise the Lord they are having sleepless night they are being fed on pills just to see how much evil what kind of an invention they can bring to the world to plague the minds of the people praise the Lord man would destroy himself and over and over and over it has been all true history glory be to God amen just before we we travel we were speaking there on Ezekiel prophesy that if there is an evil that is upon the lane let's look in the Book of Ezekiel a little bit if I'm right there should be chapter 14 yeah it's okay it's okay yeah but Johnny just brought there praise the Lord Ezekiel chapter 14 verse 12 and the word of the Lord came again to me saying son of many when the land seen against me by trespassing grievously then I would stretch out my hands upon it and we break the staff of the bread there off and we sent farming upon it and we cut off men and beasts from it though these three men Noah done your job were in it the issue deliver about their own soul body a righteousness said the Lord praise the Lord amen and we're air true and the scripture continued but let's drop down a little bit to verse 19 oh I was send the pestilence into the land and pour out my forehead upon it in blood and cut off and cut off from it men and beasts don't know Daniel and jobina will eat us as I live said the Lord they shall deliver neither sons or daughters they shall deliver their own soul by their righteousness now listen to this praise the Lord for those said the Lord verse 20 21 how much more when I sent my force called Joshua that was what we pick up that night the for school judgment that we tied with the four beasts in the church in the four daily beast in the church ages and what actually we were trying to bring out of year is that right from time God has always with the nation's he has always with men with these four scold judgment is either wall is either farming is either pestilence amen are we together all all enough zombies and pestilence and kapha for school judgment God has always struck the earth wave praise the Lord amen and and and what what I'm trying to drive to year is dead when these judgment comes upon the earth and these things are happening you know even though is the web of God upon man for the evil that we are doing but yet God will also use men of pure heart praise the Lord Nebuchadnezzar was not a Jews but yet God called him my seven why because he was going to use him as a whip against Israel are we together so you see that these things have always happened and God will always allow man in and it will looks like their India invention it will looks like I mean they are getting smarter and and and especially with this technology word that we are living in and all of the things that is happening I mean the more wiser man is becoming the more evil and cooler they are becoming praise the Lord we are dealing with a germ warfare that's why we want to speak about a little bit and I was looking at this this record this morning and I mean over and over he has happen you know [Music] it took 22 years after the end of World War two for the so-called civilized world the evil of biological weapons their fall into the category of weapon of mass destruction along with chemical weapon and nuclear weapon praise the Lord we know of chemical weapons we know of nuclear weapon and you know with Iran and all of those things that is happening well here is another weapon I mean that is that is that is I mean anything about it there people you know it it's in the end this Jam warfare is in the air to pollute the air with all of these things and that's why we breathe in and we breathe out praise the Lord but you see we start our breathing from the breath of God that's where the thinking man theater is that is the thing that filter the air that we breathe in to keep us safe from the evil that is happening in the word praise the Lord and then I never came with a scarecrow this morning to make you afraid praise the Lord Amen if you want to wear max that's your choice praise the Lord but you better pick up this Bible in the morning and breathe God's promise into your nostril praise the Lord and breathe it before you go to bed because that's the that's the only service place that we have this morning you were listening to the message of demonology he was talking a little bit on be Monson and James and in all of those things just like John recalled over in the book of Revelation praise the Lord Amen Genesis chapter 1 Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 I don't know if these have ever if you have ever thought about this if I've ever grabbed your attention before but this has got my attention a long time ago and I know brother Branham talks about it in Question and Answer on Genesis he explained that what actually it is but I want to use this this morning as I look into the subject that we want to look at Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth praise the Lord Amen that were created it means taking something that was not existing and bringing it into making it to exist praise the Lord but when you stare at rule you will see that many of the common trading and in the Bible and even brother Branham shows us in the scripture many of the commentary point when Paul says in a New Testament that you were predestinated from the foundation of the world they went back to Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 now you think about this the scripture also says here in verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the question I have always asked myself what the God created a because if verse 1 says God created the heavens and the earth and verse 2 says the earth was without form and void which is showing chaos praise the Lord then what God created praise the Lord but a prophet of God would come on the scene and tells us that you don't read a Bible like you are reading a science book you don't read a Bible like you are reading a newspaper between Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and Genesis chapter 2 chapter 1 verse 2 there is a space of time praise the Lord amen when you read question announcer on Genesis better bana actually let us know that Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 is actually the beginning of time it's the beginning of time when the earth actually came into existence there was there was a perfect creation that the Bible referred to when the Bible says all his works were finished from the foundation of the world that was Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 it was a peasant work that's the reason why he's now worried he's not afraid because it was a peph at work he says over and over the Bible says God created the heaven and the earth period it was a finished work it was a perfect work was something happen between their time when John Rivera in in Revelation chapter 12 that there was war in heaven it was between that time when Ahaziah revered in Isaiah chapter 14 that Lucifer was cast down it was between that time praise the Lord amen to imagine that this great creation of God will be ruled will be affected if I ever says when he was cast down to the earth he cursed the earth you will not receive all nations upon the earth what I'm trying to say this morning that this war that we are fighting this warfare that is going on started even before you came down here you were born to fight praise the Lord when even go home make man he put an immune system in us and what is that immune system is you're fighting aging that is in your body man was born to fight fight for every inch of ground fight for what is right people want to sleep the one who's came on the in tonight who want to get rich overnight praise the Lord Amen and even if they will break into the war bang and you have all the money they're going to drug himself up the very first night and the bunch of money is useless to them because they are all drawn up praise the Lord when men don't fight he don't know what to do with what God gave him praise the Lord Amen if he don't find if he have not gone through training if he I'm not going through discipline if wealth is put in his hands he just used that to destroy himself praise the Lord he want to run behind anything that were scared down the street praise the Lord glory be to God while I was down visiting with those people yesterday and I think it's the twin setting news or something like that were listed in trolling and and and and the news reporter was saying how even there there's a beer called the corona beer people it is refraining from drinking it praise the Lord they have to win for coronavirus before they know that the beer was wrong praise the Lord what a word that we are living in it's a sad word God provide a way for healing 1954 what is cancer what is a disease we will be on there for the next five minutes maybe I might take more than five minutes what is cancer what is the cause of that I think let's take a cancer or anything you wish to tuberculosis in the morning or whatever you wish to any disease diseases are James amen let me pass something here real quickly as our our time is growing listening did you know that the Bible predate and you can read that in Revelation chapter 9 the Bible predate that in the last days there there will be Jam warfare praise the Lord that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord now you got even if you look over there over in the book of Revelation you know I've been thinking about this you know what all the the horrible thing in the horror sites that the book of Revelation you know people was coping inhale like we mean in all of those things you know you have to realize that John was looking at a vision and visions are almost just like dreams they happen so fast praise the Lord they happen on a two three seconds amen is it so in a vision it's almost like a passing thought it's a fast word it's very fast then out then our now our first conscious things happy in a subculture it happened so fast I don't know if you have ever experienced there sometimes something dropped to your mind and it just goes so fast it's Mississippi and you and you just keep wondering what was that it came so real and a man that is taught under the spirit all you have to do it is just pray give it to the Lord after a period of time God is going to reveal it to you either he was speaking to a prophet or true a preacher or he would bring it out of the Bible and then your spirit man will be quicking okay I see it it's nothing that can't pass so fast praise the Lord that's what the word says I mean if you have all of these out of our phones and you set them up with Google and they give you all of the news feeling if you just you just see the kind of news that come forth praising our parents I mean suffocating their children and I mean man is just becoming like a beast their minds and heart is becoming evil and they have no sense of remorse they don't regret it they live right in the face of the gorge after you have finished taking life out of the earth young people this is not a fairy tale it's a spirit that is upon the world and if you don't give your heart to God is going to get ahold of you it's going to get ahold of you children I mean they're there they are killing the appearance and I mean all of this evil those were the things that drawn by a vision was trying to bring the spirit that would come to the last world you could not describe those things like Hindman he had to describe it like beasts they have a hair like it like a human and they have feels like a lion it's a human that is behaving like an animal we're looking for one day where we will have those animals running down the street it's already here they are already here already here appears in your nose PS in your eyes peers in their body tattoo all over their body that when they appear you can even know they're him obey they wake up on drugs to go right to bed on drugs they don't even know the word they are living in and it's a spirit and I want to tell you young people it's after you your way to get away from it is to run into Christ be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have the Holy Ghost it's ruining homes and ruining marriages praise the Lord a made people just tenure you know yeah I mean you got to be identified with the message you got a billy brother branham it's a prophet it's not enough he told us that the talking was the highlight of his ministry the life of Christ coming back on the human soul that is the only thing that would make you to escape these things that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I prefer to go one time he said I was thinking about that this morning I said oh god oh god just like brother Jordan preached on Wednesday night it was the wave sheaf if God can bring a man to the place he says that's fine I said no there is no hatred in my heart against any mortar can you check your heart this morning to realize that there is no ill feelings there is no bitterness in your heart I don't know how we getting ready for this rapture it's not a bus that is coming from Jeffersonville to pick us up praise the Lord glory be to God jeonhwa PHA all of these things we call James and sickness those are just Devils amen the Bible says 2/3 of the angels were deceived by Lucifer's and they were cast them that was when James were cast to the earth James were here before you were born those are destructive devils they want to get a hold of you right when you come into the earth medical science has given them all sorts of nice names praise the Lord but we know from the Word of God it is devil Jesus called the dumb spirit a devil he called epaulettes a devil praise the Lord and you think about it see innocent children they don't know nothing about the evil in the world but he had their kids that are born with horrible medical condition is that they were seeking their life right from the womb right from the day that they were birthed into the earth James have been seeking your life to affect your brain cells to affect your heart affect your liver and if God by His mercy has kept you till now praise the Lord I don't know what are you walking forward are you walking back

mouse down and they take a cigarette and a smoke in the place all over the place I'm standing there so called Jesus you got to come and get us out of this place what are you protecting yourself from amen they smoking the place all over and they gotta throw the duck and then they put their marks up again what a word that we are living in glory be to God but this is the word of God that has come for to warn us and the things that are going to happen go provide a way for fellowship how we thank thee there in this great hour when all hopes of mortal life has finished atomic bombs aligned in hangars hydrogen bombs sickness diseases Jam were fair hanging over us praise the Lord even the air that we breathe the nation seeing all of the things that is happening try to protect us the amend that goes through the night and spread spread over the nation before you wake up in the morning they don't announce that well it's the nation in itself Naurang the kind of things that are out there in the earth when it talks about the flu and all of these things they tried to sanitize the air to save the masses we call them allergies praise the Lord and sometimes we blame them on the Bourbon or flowers but those were the ones that God gave us naturally to be able to purify the air but the air is so contaminated that God's natural provision can just only help praise Allah Oh God and everything the way it is knowing that the Bible says the men who actually rot in their flesh praise the Lord Revelation chapter 9 the Bible says they will run to the mountains and sea for upon us sort of these illnesses and sicknesses that the doctors cannot find kill for John honor a vision distrubing him to us praise the Lord Jesus said mentioned I live by bread alone but by every word of God praise the Lord we're living in a day word Christians believer we becoming so lazy on God when we supposed to be reading that word of God meditating on the Word of God memorizing the word of God putting it on our lips and speaking it and singing it in sounds but we failed our hell with all the daily music all the new ugly music there are demons streaming out to the earth find all of these young people I mean they are shaking their hair as if to say the hell should jump off their shoulder what is making them to do that evil spirit that is projected from those music for no reason this guy just shaking his head just it sounded funny for you young people you listening to gospel music you're listening to those two those ugly music why because it's a spirit it want to get ahold of you praise the Lord even from research the kind of four languages that I introduced music it tell them to kill their parents stand up against anybody I don't want you to follow your heart you gotta follow your heart and follow your mind it is breeding them where branches is preparing them from amiguita she listening to this music there is nothing nothing nesto the Word of God the next thing that a soul of a man can feed on is music it goes right to your soul it create an attitude in you they give you a stubborn and rebellious nature that's the reason why when when Saul was caught up with an evil spirit they had to send for David to come and play a harp music to catch that spirit away that's the power in music it can deliver you or it can possess you praise Lord glory be to God oh I've want us to make this place so hot Amen so hot that the devil would know there are people standing on this earth against his device against his evil device praise the Lord that's what parents supposed to be doing sticking our face on on the ground we look at our children glory into things and it's now for you to wonder it's not because you come to church with them makes them priests think they need a birth [Music] praise the Lord and you can bone them the second time like Nicodemus card but you can pray them true you can stick on your face and seek the face of God until until a Grace would come from heaven and deliverance would come upon that child praise the Lord I believe we must do the same for our wives I believe wives must do the same for their husband because we are facing trouble waters it's before us pray so to praise the Lord we have to realize us as the truth believers I mean I mean we will be pressed out amen we'll be pressed out when we're BAM talks about the squeeze

believers would be affected by these things they are believers in China that I affect about this coronavirus the righteous is suffering with the wicked praise the Lord but you know it's just like how we talk about you know God manifestation of healing they'll stay in their sickness they can they can keep their faith and they keep keep holding to the cross amen that's why he's sharing a message demonology if you if you follow the message this morning a man filled with the Holy Ghost going inside what carradine sin is its evil spirit but you don't have anything to do with your soul I mean just like we written down here you see it as we go along he says he says Oh God that the church will be taught there in such a time because as soon as the Pledge starts falling and all of these things is falling we have a loved one that is sick it's a pretty soon put us to the world and think that all we are lose our faith maybe we don't have the holy God that don't have nothing to do with the Holy Ghost they don't have nothing to do with your salvation we realize that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seed of God for it is rate inefficient for tell him grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption Lord God see you this church tonight those who are wanting the seal of God the Holy Ghost kiss away every fear seal them with their sealed of the Spirit in your heart that they will come to a newborn baby crying Abba Father amen praise the Lord that's what we need this is the darkest hour the world has ever faced since the beginning of time there has never been a time in all the world history that age dark as it is right now some of these things you listen to it you think is conspiracy theory recently the Chinese were facing a lot of problem with those people on the monk side mongolian side and they had a big population of Muslims there and I mean they've been kind of a plaguing these people wanting to take this land just like you know what Russia is doing to - to their neighbors there you know want to bring those people you know and Kru over them in in all of these things you know and and and and even with with with with the United Nations and and all the laws that the word had there was still records that people were kept like prisoners and people were treated treated like dogs because they wanted to subject them they wanted to bring them honor and control and those people were denying the same thing is happening in India they are facing a crisis word the the the the Indian government they are so worried because the government empowered is it's a Buddhist government and they want to bring all the Muslims and I mean the Christians are the minority so those want adjust they can just whip them out anytime they want to web them out we have United Nations we have all of these things but herb Adam say they have failed the word praise the Lord they can never provide protection the most safest place is the name of the law that is a mighty tower and the righteous run to it and they are safe praise the Lord amen and it will come up with some some lying theory that it comes from some kind of an animal that it comes from it's men that are breeding these things man that are possessed by devil spirits that are breeding these things and casting them into the world not even thinking that it will affect their own children and affect their own family praise the Lord but he was the first doctor Chinese doctor does that spoke against the coronavirus or I mean that kind of an explosive he killed him praise the Lord you see it's just like even this man you know that there are possessed that will put bombs all around them and go into places and explore themselves up they don't care what are the dime what the

you an invitation that there is a man here that can turn on the light praise the Lord there's a man here that can give you a pill of joy and happiness and peace that you will never find in the world praise the Lord everything that the word has out there that they are producing I mean they get pills to make you hide and pills for sex and pills for all of these things they have never got one for joy because it's not out there you wanna get it from God's Word it's a fruit of the Spirit it can provide one for peace because it's a fruit of the Spirit it comes from the Holy Ghost it's only the Holy Ghost can provide it praise the Lord it's just like Billy Graham brother Mavi he was talking with his friends and you know having you know friends composition and his friends actually maybe I mean I mean you grew up when your dad I believe you you never had you know the time to to ever get on drugs or all of that he said no no don't misunderstand me you know don't mistake me I was on drugs he says daddy used to drug us to church when it was waged at night he takes us where we wanted to go on now he took us to church during the snow he took us we were so drug to church until we never knew anything else and that's the best drugs in the world praise the Lord Laurel be to God and that is the thing where we make excuse on we have time for everything but no time for prayer meeting no time for church when it comes to church and the things of God we find all the excuses that we can find Jesus experienced that in his ministry praise the Lord he says all the people that were bared to give excuses they have a house they have a wife they have a distant dad enough he says going into the byways and I don't know I think I think that is the thing were preachers hearts are desiring for their people are in the streets homeless people that needs this hope that we have there are people that are trapped into this drugs and gangs it's not the truth identification who's going to take this hope to them they can do better with what we have we have it we don't we don't value it we don't cherish it it just looks like you know it looks like a message it looks like a club that we can be identified with we want a pillow a fire picture we want something with brother branham names on it when brother branham looks down from the curtain of time well he won't he want to see the holy ghost in your heart that's what he desired now boys that cried and said steal I was the horse of anguish praise the Lord I believe that prophet of God will be happy to know that you have the Holy Ghost and you have a desire of God and if you feel your whole home with his photo praise the Lord I'm just listening to the message the other day birth pain actually that's why I was gonna speak on Wednesday night when I was talking about a little why God I taught from birth pains and I was listening you to to Darrin he I mean he was talking about all of these things the earth is in another birth pains amen and like the scripture says when birth pain comes upon the earth just like a woman she cried in anguish amen is an increasing ping that can make you to lose your mind and sometimes they will say things it's all because that pain has gone right to their heart and to their mind but that's what it takes for life to come to the earth and that's what the church needs where we were just we will be in so much pain for people to be safe so much pain for people to have the Holy Ghost not a dry eye confession when was the last time you get before God and all you can do it is just cry when was the last time you got down on your knees and all you can do is just cry like brother Darren Walsh says if you put your heart in God's hands and he squeezed it he said the Jews would come through your eyes we just want to pray in and get a pleasant feeling and just do our religion that's what it takes to bring life into the earth it's anguish crying out to God well you don't have words to alter just like Hannah you just babble with your mouth and you can taste the saltiness of your tears in your mouth when last we got before God musicians you can comfort he walks with me and he talks with me yeah
