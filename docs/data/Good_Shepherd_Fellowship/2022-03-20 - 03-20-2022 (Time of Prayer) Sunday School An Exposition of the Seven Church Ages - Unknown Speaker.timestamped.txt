[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] so
[0:21] [Music]
[0:57] these things saith he that is holy he
[0:59] that is true he that hath the key of
[1:02] david he that openeth and no man
[1:04] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[1:08] oh how beautiful are those words how
[1:10] majestic is even the sound of them how
[1:13] thrilling to think that all those
[1:14] attributes can be applied to one person
[1:17] who would dare to say such things about
[1:19] himself but jesus christ the lord of
[1:21] glory
[1:23] i believe the key to interpreting
[1:24] exactly what each of these wonderfully
[1:26] descriptive phrases means is found in
[1:28] verse nine
[1:30] behold i will make them of the synagogue
[1:32] of satan which say they are jews and are
[1:34] not but do lie
[1:36] behold i will make them to come and
[1:38] worship before thy feet and to know that
[1:40] i have loved thee
[1:42] i say this verse is the key because it
[1:44] deals with the jews who have always
[1:46] called themselves the children of god to
[1:48] the exclusion of everyone else
[1:50] they crucified and killed the lord jesus
[1:52] christ
[1:53] their terrible deed brought their own
[1:55] blood upon their own heads for centuries
[1:58] all because they refused jesus as their
[2:00] messiah which indeed he was
[2:02] to them he was not the coming one or the
[2:04] son of david to them he was beelzebub or
[2:08] some unrighteous one fit only for
[2:09] destruction
[2:11] but not so
[2:12] he was indeed emmanuel god manifest in
[2:15] the flesh
[2:16] he is indeed messiah
[2:18] surely he was exactly as he now sets
[2:21] himself forth to be
[2:23] there he is the same jesus
[2:25] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[2:28] today and forever
[2:29] that holy one in the midst of the lamp
[2:31] stands is the very same jesus who walked
[2:34] the shores of galilee who healed the
[2:36] sick who raised the dead
[2:38] and who in spite of irrefutable proof
[2:40] was crucified and killed
[2:42] but he arose again and is seated at the
[2:44] right hand of the majesty on high
[2:47] the jews did not call him holy then they
[2:50] do not call him holy now
[2:52] but he is the holy one
[2:54] psalms 16 10
[2:56] for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell
[2:59] neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one
[3:01] to see
[3:02] corruption they sought their
[3:04] righteousness after the law and failed
[3:06] miserably for by the law can no flesh be
[3:09] justified
[3:10] by the law can no man be made holy
[3:13] holiness is of the lord
[3:15] first corinthians 1 30
[3:18] but of him are ye in christ jesus who of
[3:21] god is made unto us wisdom and
[3:23] righteousness and sanctification and
[3:25] redemption
[3:27] second corinthians 5 21 be
[3:31] that we might be made the righteousness
[3:33] of god in him
[3:35] it was christ or perish and they
[3:36] perished for they refused him
[3:39] and men of that age as even today were
[3:41] making the same mistake
[3:43] as the jews took refuge in the synagogue
[3:45] form of worship so in the philadelphian
[3:48] age they were taking refuge in the
[3:49] church
[3:50] it is not joining a church that counts
[3:53] the life is not in the church the life
[3:55] is in christ
[3:57] this is the record that god hath given
[3:59] us eternal life and this life is in his
[4:01] son
[4:02] he that hath the son hath life and he
[4:05] that hath not the son hath not life
[4:08] man is made holy by the spirit
[4:11] it is the spirit of holiness that raised
[4:13] jesus from the dead that indwells us and
[4:15] makes us holy with his holiness
[4:18] there he stands the holy one
[4:21] and we will stand with him clothed in
[4:23] his righteousness holy with his holiness
[4:26] now this age is the sixth age
[4:29] in the eyes of god time is drawing to a
[4:31] close
[4:32] he will soon be coming back
[4:34] soon the cry will go forth as he comes
[4:38] and he which is filthy let him be filthy
[4:40] still
[4:41] and he that is righteous let him be
[4:42] righteous still
[4:44] and he that is holy let him be holy
[4:46] still
[4:48] revelation 22 11 be
[4:51] oh i am so glad that my holiness is not
[4:54] of myself
[4:55] i am glad that i am in christ with all
[4:57] his wonderful attributes of
[4:58] righteousness imputed
[5:00] yea imparted unto me
[5:02] blessed be god forever
[5:05] these things saith he that is true
[5:08] now this word true is a very wonderful
[5:10] word
[5:11] it does not mean true in just the sense
[5:13] that it is opposite to false
[5:15] it expresses the perfect realization of
[5:17] an idea as contrasted with its partial
[5:19] realization
[5:21] for example we recall that jesus said in
[5:23] john 6 32
[5:26] moses gave you not that bread from
[5:28] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[5:30] bread from heaven
[5:32] john 15 1
[5:34] i am the true vine
[5:37] hebrews 9 24
[5:39] for christ is not entered into the holy
[5:41] places made with hands which are the
[5:43] figures of the true
[5:45] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[5:47] the presence of god for us
[5:50] first john 2 8
[5:53] because the darkness is past and the
[5:55] true light now shineth
[5:58] since this word indeed expresses perfect
[6:00] realization as against the idea of
[6:02] partial realization as illustrated in
[6:04] these verses we can now understand as
[6:07] never before anti-type contrasted with
[6:09] type and substance with shadow
[6:12] take the example now of manna from
[6:14] heaven
[6:15] god sent down angel bread from heaven
[6:17] for israel but that bread did not
[6:19] satisfy
[6:20] it was only good for a day
[6:22] those who ate it were hungry again the
[6:24] next day
[6:26] if it was left around it became
[6:27] contaminated
[6:29] but jesus is the true bread from heaven
[6:32] whereof manna was just a type
[6:34] and if any man eats of that bread that
[6:36] came from heaven he will never hunger
[6:38] again
[6:39] he does not need to come back and eat
[6:41] again
[6:42] the moment he partook he had eternal
[6:44] life
[6:45] here indeed was reality
[6:47] no need any longer for a shadow no need
[6:50] for a partial salvation
[6:52] here is the whole of it
[6:54] just like jesus isn't a part of god he
[6:56] is god
[6:59] no one could deny that israel had light
[7:02] they were the only people who had light
[7:04] as a nation
[7:05] it was as when egypt was so dark that
[7:07] one could feel it
[7:09] but in the homes of the israelites there
[7:10] was light
[7:12] but now true light is come
[7:14] the light of the world is jesus
[7:16] moses and the prophets brought the light
[7:18] by means of the scripture relative to
[7:20] the messiah
[7:21] thus israel had light
[7:23] but now the fulfillment of the light has
[7:25] come
[7:26] and what was but glowing word has now
[7:28] broken forth in the brightness of god
[7:30] manifested amongst his people
[7:33] as the pillar of fire gave light at
[7:34] night and that was wonderful
[7:37] now light and life were manifested in
[7:39] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[7:42] israel used to take the red heifer and
[7:44] sacrifice her upon the altar for the
[7:46] remission of sins
[7:48] for a year the sins of the guilty one
[7:49] was covered
[7:51] but that covering could not take away
[7:52] the desire for sin
[7:54] it was not a perfect offering it was a
[7:56] shadow until the reel came along
[7:59] so each year the man would sacrifice and
[8:02] each year come back because he still had
[8:03] the same desire to sin
[8:05] the life of the animal atoned for his
[8:07] sin
[8:08] but being animal blood that was shed and
[8:10] animal life that was given it could not
[8:12] come back upon the man
[8:14] if it had come back it still would not
[8:16] have availed
[8:18] but when christ the perfect substitute
[8:20] was given and his blood was shed
[8:22] then the life that was in christ came
[8:24] back upon the repentant sinner and that
[8:26] life being the perfect life of christ
[8:28] sinless and righteous then the guilty
[8:31] one could go free for he had no desire
[8:33] to sin
[8:35] the life of jesus had come back upon him
[8:37] that is what is meant in romans 8 2.
[8:40] the law of the spirit of life in christ
[8:43] jesus has made me free from the law of
[8:45] sin and death
[8:47] but the jews back there in the time of
[8:49] jesus did not want to accept that
[8:51] sacrifice
[8:52] the blood of bulls and goats made
[8:54] nothing perfect
[8:55] it was once god's ordained method but
[8:58] now christ having appeared in the flesh
[9:00] and by the shedding of his own blood has
[9:02] put away sin and by that offering of
[9:04] himself has made us perfect
[9:06] the jews would not take that
[9:08] but what about that philadelphian age
[9:11] and yes the other ages too
[9:13] did they really accept this reality in
[9:15] christ
[9:16] no sir
[9:17] even though luther brought the truth of
[9:20] justification the romish church and its
[9:22] eastern counterpart the orthodox church
[9:24] still clung to works
[9:26] now works are fine but they don't save
[9:28] you they don't make you perfect
[9:31] it is christ or perish and it is not
[9:34] even christ and works it is christ alone
[9:37] this age began the years of armenianism
[9:40] that does not believe in christ as the
[9:41] reality
[9:42] it does not sing of nothing but the
[9:44] blood for it sings of
[9:47] nothing but the blood and my own conduct
[9:50] now i believe in good conduct
[9:52] if you are saved you will do righteously
[9:55] we have already gone over that
[9:57] but let me tell you now salvation is not
[9:59] jesus plus
[10:01] it is jesus alone
[10:03] salvation is of the lord
[10:05] from start to finish it is all god
[10:08] let his life be in me
[10:10] let it be his blood that cleanses me let
[10:13] it be his spirit that fills me
[10:15] let it be his word in my heart and mouth
[10:18] let it be his stripes that heal me
[10:21] let it be jesus and jesus alone
[10:23] not by works of righteousness which i
[10:25] have done no sir
[10:27] christ is my life amen
[10:31] i feel i could just go on and on about
[10:33] these truths but i will give you one
[10:35] more thought
[10:36] it is about that wonderful hymn that a b
[10:38] simpson wrote
[10:40] once it was the blessing now it is the
[10:42] lord
[10:44] once it was the feeling now it is his
[10:46] word
[10:47] once his gift i wanted now the giver own
[10:50] once i sought for healing now himself
[10:53] alone
[10:54] all in all forever jesus will i sing
[10:57] everything in jesus and jesus everything
[11:02] there isn't anything in this life
[11:04] satisfying as it may be
[11:06] as good and as fine as it may be
[11:08] but you will find the sum total of all
[11:10] perfection in christ
[11:12] everything fades into insignificance
[11:14] beside him
[11:16] he that hath the key of david
[11:18] this beautiful phrase follows and comes
[11:20] out of the preceding phrase
[11:22] he that is true
[11:24] christ the perfect realization
[11:26] contrasted with partial realization
[11:29] here it is
[11:30] moses was a prophet of god
[11:33] but jesus like unto moses was the
[11:35] prophet of god
[11:37] david a man after god's own heart was
[11:40] king of israel but jesus is the greater
[11:42] david king of kings and lord of lords
[11:45] god very god
[11:47] now david was born of the tribe of judah
[11:49] out of whom no priests came
[11:52] yet he ate of the shoe bread reserved
[11:53] for priests
[11:55] he was the great warrior overcoming the
[11:56] enemy establishing the people
[11:58] as king he sat on the throne
[12:00] he was a prophet he was a wonderful type
[12:03] of christ
[12:04] now it says in isaiah 22 22
[12:08] and the key of the house of david will i
[12:10] lay upon his shoulder so he shall open
[12:12] and none shall shut and he shall shut
[12:15] and none shall open
[12:17] the spirit uses this old testament
[12:19] reference concerning the lord jesus
[12:20] christ and his ministry in the church
[12:23] what the key of david signified at that
[12:25] time is mere shadow which is now
[12:27] fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst
[12:29] of the lamp stands
[12:31] it has to do with our lord after his
[12:33] resurrection and not his earthly
[12:35] pilgrimage
[12:36] but what does this key signify
[12:39] the answer lies in the position of the
[12:41] key
[12:42] it is not in his hand it is not worn
[12:44] around his neck
[12:46] it is not placed in the hands of other
[12:48] men
[12:49] for the verse could not be saying that
[12:51] he alone has the use of that key
[12:54] for he alone opens and shuts and no man
[12:56] has that right but jesus himself
[12:59] isn't that right
[13:01] but where is the key
[13:02] it is on his shoulder
[13:05] but what does shoulder have to do with
[13:06] it
[13:08] read isaiah 9 6
[13:10] and the government shall be upon his
[13:12] shoulder
[13:13] but what does this mean
[13:15] the answer is this
[13:17] the phrase government upon his shoulder
[13:20] comes from the wedding ceremony of the
[13:22] east
[13:22] when the bride has been committed to the
[13:24] groom she takes off her veil and places
[13:26] it over the groom's shoulders signifying
[13:29] that not only is she under his dominion
[13:31] that she has transferred her rights to
[13:33] him that he is the head
[13:35] but also that he bears the
[13:37] responsibility and the care and that he
[13:39] and he alone
[13:41] no one else no other man
[13:43] no other power has any right and
[13:46] responsibility
[13:48] and that beloved is the key of david
[13:51] god being sovereign he for knew by
[13:53] divine decree exactly who would be in
[13:55] his bride
[13:56] he chose her she did not choose him
[13:59] he called her
[14:01] she did not come on her own
[14:03] he died for her
[14:05] he washed her in his own blood
[14:07] he paid the price for her she belongs to
[14:10] him and to him alone
[14:12] she is wholly committed to him and he
[14:14] accepts the obligation he is her head
[14:17] for christ is the head of his church
[14:19] as sarah called abraham lord
[14:22] even so the bride is happy that he is
[14:24] her lord
[14:25] he speaks and she obeys for that is her
[14:27] delight
[14:28] but have men heeded this truth
[14:31] have they esteemed his person who alone
[14:33] has the full sovereign authority over
[14:35] his church
[14:36] i say no
[14:38] for in every age the church has been
[14:40] governed by a hierarchy a priesthood an
[14:43] apostolic succession
[14:45] closing the door of mercy and grace to
[14:47] whom it will
[14:48] and instead of assuming the love and
[14:50] responsibility of the church it has with
[14:52] mercenary lust preyed upon her and
[14:54] destroyed her
[14:56] the clergy lived in luxury while the
[14:58] poor church fed on the husks of abuse
[15:01] and not one age did any different
[15:03] each bound itself to organization and
[15:06] put the government upon men and
[15:07] committed the church to that government
[15:10] there let the people rise up and they
[15:11] were brutally suppressed or cast out
[15:14] every denomination has the same spirit
[15:17] every denomination swears that it has
[15:19] the key to the government of the church
[15:21] every denomination claims that it opens
[15:23] the door
[15:24] but that is not true
[15:27] it is jesus and jesus alone
[15:30] he sets the members in the body
[15:32] he endows them with their ministries
[15:34] he puts the gifts at her disposal
[15:37] he cares for her and guides her
[15:39] she is his sole property and he has no
[15:41] other one but her
[15:44] what a far cry from reality is this
[15:46] church age in which we live
[15:48] and one day soon these men that even now
[15:51] purport to speak for the church will be
[15:53] rising up in the ecumenical move to
[15:55] place a living antichrist at the head of
[15:57] their organization which deposes the
[15:59] lord and we will find him christ outside
[16:02] the church saying
[16:04] behold i stand at the door and knock
[16:07] if any man hear my voice and open the
[16:09] door i will come into him and will sup
[16:11] with him and he with me
[16:14] revelation 3 20
[16:16] but let me say this
[16:18] our lord is not defeated
[16:20] men claim to open the door to god and
[16:22] shut that door but they are liars
[16:24] all that the father has given him will
[16:26] come to him and he that cometh to him in
[16:29] no wise will be cast out he will lose
[16:32] none of them
[16:33] john 6 37-39
[16:37] and when that last elected member to the
[16:39] body of christ comes in then will our
[16:41] lord appear
[16:43] the key of david
[16:45] was not david the king of israel all
[16:47] israel
[16:48] and is not jesus the son of david
[16:50] according to the fact that he will sit
[16:52] upon the throne of david in the
[16:54] millennium and reign and rule over his
[16:56] heritage
[16:57] surely
[16:58] so the key of david signifies that it is
[17:01] jesus who will bring in the millennium
[17:03] he who has the keys to death and hell
[17:05] will raise up his own that they may
[17:07] share in his reign of righteousness upon
[17:09] the earth
[17:11] how wonderful that our lord has all the
[17:13] answers
[17:14] truly in him are all the promises of god
[17:17] fulfilled
[17:18] truly by being in him we are heirs to
[17:20] what he has purchased for us
[17:23] yes there he stands the lord of glory
[17:26] once as the father he was surrounded by
[17:28] the angels the archangels the cherubims
[17:31] and seraphims and the whole host of
[17:33] heaven crying
[17:34] holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts
[17:38] such was his holiness that no man could
[17:40] approach unto him
[17:42] but now we see him in the church sharing
[17:45] his own holiness with us
[17:46] until in him we have become the very
[17:48] righteousness of god
[17:50] yes and there he stands
[17:53] jesus perfect everything
[17:55] lily of the valley the bright and
[17:57] mourning star the fairest of ten
[17:59] thousand
[18:00] alpha and omega root and offspring of
[18:03] david father son and holy ghost
[18:06] the all and in all
[18:08] isaiah 9 6
[18:11] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[18:13] son is given
[18:15] and the government shall be upon his
[18:16] shoulder and his name shall be called
[18:19] wonderful counsellor the mighty god the
[18:21] everlasting father the prince of peace
[18:25] in him is perfect fulfillment but once
[18:28] we esteemed him not
[18:30] now we love him with joy unspeakable and
[18:32] full of glory
[18:34] in the midst of the church he stands and
[18:36] we will sing his praise for he the
[18:38] mighty conqueror is head over the church
[18:40] which is his bride
[18:42] he bought that bride he owns her
[18:45] she is his and his alone and he cares
[18:48] for her he is our king and we are his
[18:50] kingdom his eternal possession
[18:54] now you will recall that at the
[18:55] beginning of verse 7 i said that verse 9
[18:58] would help us to understand it
[19:00] i hope you saw what i meant
[19:02] jesus set himself forth as he that is
[19:04] holy true or the only reality
[19:08] the one with the key of david the one
[19:10] who opened and shut
[19:12] and that is exactly true
[19:15] those phrases describe him perfectly
[19:17] but the jews in his day refused him and
[19:20] all he was
[19:21] they rejected their savior and all he
[19:23] meant to them
[19:24] and the nominal christian has now done
[19:26] the same
[19:28] they have done what the jews did exactly
[19:30] the jews crucified him and then turned
[19:32] on the true believer the nominal
[19:35] christian has crucified him afresh and
[19:37] turned on the true church to destroy it
[19:40] but god is true
[19:41] and he who is above all will yet return
[19:44] and when he does he will show who the
[19:46] only
[20:11] now you will recall that at the
[20:12] beginning of verse 7 i said that verse 9
[20:14] would help us to understand it
[20:16] i hope you saw what i meant
[20:19] jesus set himself forth as he that is
[20:21] holy true
[20:23] or the only reality
[20:24] the one with the key of david the one
[20:27] who opened and shut
[20:29] and that is exactly true
[20:31] those phrases describe him perfectly
[20:34] but the jews in his day refused him and
[20:36] all he was
[20:38] they rejected their savior and all he
[20:40] meant to them
[20:41] and the nominal christian has now done
[20:43] the same
[20:44] they have done what the jews did exactly
[20:47] the jews crucified him and then turned
[20:49] on the true believer the nominal
[20:51] christian has crucified him afresh and
[20:54] turned on the true church to destroy it
[20:56] but god is true
[20:58] and he who is above all will yet return
[21:01] and when he does he will show who the
[21:03] only potentate is
[21:05] and as he proves himself to the world
[21:07] and all the world bows at his feet at
[21:10] that time all the world will bow at the
[21:11] feet of the saints proving that they
[21:14] were right in their stand with him
[21:16] blessed be god forever
[21:20] the age of the open door
[21:23] revelation 3 8
[21:26] i know thy works
[21:28] behold i have set before thee an open
[21:30] door and no man can shut it for thou
[21:33] hast to little strength and has kept my
[21:35] word and has not denied my name
[21:38] the first phrase of this verse
[21:40] i know thy works is analyzed in the rest
[21:43] of the verse for their works had to do
[21:45] with the open door little strength the
[21:48] word and the name
[21:50] in order to understand the wealth of
[21:52] meaning involved in
[21:54] behold i set before you an open door and
[21:56] no man can shut it
[21:58] we must now recall what has been said
[22:00] about each age running over into another
[22:02] age
[22:03] there is an overlapping a melting or
[22:05] fading into
[22:07] rather than an abrupt end and a
[22:08] clear-cut start
[22:10] this age particularly flows into the
[22:12] next stage
[22:13] and not only does this age overflow into
[22:15] the last stage but the last age is in
[22:18] many respects simply a carrying on of
[22:20] the sixth age
[22:22] the seventh age a very short age gathers
[22:25] up into itself for one quick work all
[22:28] the evil of every age and yet all the
[22:30] reality of pentecost
[22:32] once the philadelphian age has about run
[22:34] its course the laodicean age quickly
[22:36] comes in
[22:37] bringing both the tears and the wheat to
[22:39] harvest
[22:41] first bind the tears to burn them but
[22:43] gather the wheat into my barn
[22:45] matthew 13 30.
[22:48] remember please that the sardisian age
[22:50] started the reformation that must still
[22:52] go on until the grain that was planted
[22:53] at pentecost goes through the full cycle
[22:56] of planting watering nourishing etc
[22:59] until it comes right back to original
[23:01] seed
[23:03] while this is going on the tears that
[23:04] were sown will have to go through their
[23:06] cycle and be harvested also
[23:08] that is exactly what we see happening
[23:11] if you can just think of the seasons you
[23:14] can get a very good picture of this
[23:16] the plant that you see growing in full
[23:18] strength in summer suddenly appears to
[23:20] be going to seed
[23:22] you can't tell exactly when summer
[23:24] became autumn
[23:25] it just faded into it
[23:27] that is how the ages are and especially
[23:29] these last two
[23:31] it is to this age that jesus says
[23:34] i come quickly verse 11.
[23:37] that makes the last stage a very short
[23:39] one laodicea is the age of the quick
[23:42] work it is cut short
[23:45] now we will specifically dwell on the
[23:47] open door that no man can shut first of
[23:50] all i want to dwell on the open door as
[23:52] signifying the tremendous missionary
[23:54] effort of that age
[23:56] paul called a new missionary endeavor
[23:58] for the lord and open door
[24:00] second corinthians 2 12.
[24:03] furthermore when i came to troas to
[24:05] preach christ's gospel and a door was
[24:07] opened unto me of the lord
[24:10] so we can see by the comparison of
[24:11] scriptures that this open door signified
[24:14] the greatest spreading of the gospel
[24:15] that the world has ever seen
[24:18] i want you to see something here
[24:20] god works in threes doesn't he
[24:23] it was in the third or pergament age
[24:25] that the church was married to the state
[24:28] the deeds of the nicolaitans had become
[24:29] the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[24:32] that age was the open door for the false
[24:34] vine
[24:36] once it was backed up by the power of
[24:37] the state it became actually a world
[24:39] system even though it bore the name
[24:41] christian
[24:43] thus it spread like wildfire
[24:45] but now three ages later after a long
[24:47] and hard struggle of faith here comes
[24:50] the open door to the truth
[24:52] the word of the lord now has its day
[24:55] of course the fifth age had set the
[24:57] stage for this mighty move as that age
[24:59] gave us exploration colonization the
[25:01] printing of books etc
[25:04] it would have been wonderful if this
[25:06] open door had followed the divine
[25:07] pattern of pentecost which was set forth
[25:10] in hebrews two one through four
[25:13] therefore we ought to give the more
[25:15] earnest heed to the things which we have
[25:16] heard
[25:17] lest at any time we should let them slip
[25:20] for if the word spoken by angels was
[25:22] steadfast and every transgression and
[25:24] disobedience received a just recompense
[25:26] of reward how shall we escape if we
[25:29] neglect so great salvation which at the
[25:32] first began to be spoken by the lord and
[25:35] was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[25:37] him
[25:38] god also bearing them witness both with
[25:40] signs and wonders and with diverse
[25:42] miracles and gifts of the holy ghost
[25:45] according to his own will
[25:48] now you know that this is the pattern
[25:49] for jesus himself said so
[25:52] mark 16 15-20
[25:56] and he said unto them
[25:57] go ye into all the world and preach the
[26:00] gospel to every creature
[26:02] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[26:04] be saved
[26:05] but he that believeth not shall be
[26:07] damned
[26:08] and these signs shall follow them that
[26:10] believe
[26:11] in my name shall they cast out devils
[26:13] they shall speak with new tongues they
[26:15] shall take up serpents
[26:17] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[26:19] shall not hurt them
[26:20] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[26:22] they shall recover
[26:24] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[26:26] them he was received up into heaven and
[26:28] sat on the right hand of god
[26:31] and they went forth and preached
[26:32] everywhere the lord working with them
[26:35] and confirming the word with signs
[26:37] following amen
[26:40] he never told them to go into all the
[26:42] world and establish bible colleges
[26:44] nor did he tell them to pass out
[26:46] literature
[26:47] now these things are fine but what jesus
[26:49] told them to do was to preach the gospel
[26:52] stick with the word
[26:54] and then the signs would follow
[26:56] the very first introduction we have in
[26:58] the way the kingdom of god was to be
[27:00] preached was when he sent out the twelve
[27:03] in matthew 10 1-8
[27:06] he commissioned and instructed them on
[27:08] this wise
[27:09] and when he had called unto him his
[27:11] twelve disciples he gave them power
[27:14] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[27:16] and to heal all manner of sickness and
[27:19] all manner of disease
[27:21] now the names of the twelve apostles are
[27:23] these
[27:24] the first simon who is called peter and
[27:27] andrew his brother
[27:29] james the son of zebedee and john his
[27:31] brother philip and bartholomew
[27:34] thomas and matthew the publican
[27:37] james the son of alfies
[27:39] and labias whose surname was thaddeus
[27:42] simon the canaanite and judas iscariot
[27:45] who also betrayed him
[27:47] these twelve jesus sent forth and
[27:49] commanded them saying
[27:51] go not into the way of the gentiles and
[27:53] into any city of the samaritans enter ye
[27:55] not
[27:56] but go rather to the lost sheep of the
[27:57] house of israel
[27:59] and as ego preached saying the kingdom
[28:01] of heaven is at hand
[28:03] heal the sick cleanse the lepers
[28:06] raise the dead cast out devils
[28:08] freely ye have received freely give
[28:12] this ministry that he gave them was
[28:14] actually the sharing of his own ministry
[28:16] with them for it says in matthew 9 35-38
[28:20] and jesus went about all the cities and
[28:23] villages teaching in their synagogues
[28:25] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[28:27] and healing every sickness and every
[28:29] disease among the people
[28:31] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[28:33] moved with compassion on them because
[28:35] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[28:37] as sheep having no shepherd
[28:39] then saith he unto his disciples
[28:42] the harvest truly is plenteous
[28:44] but the laborers are few
[28:46] pray ye therefore the lord of the
[28:48] harvest that he will send forth laborers
[28:50] into his harvest
[28:52] now many people have the idea that just
[28:54] the apostles had this ministry given
[28:56] them by our lord jesus and so when they
[28:58] died the ministry was over
[29:04] [Music]
[29:24] you
