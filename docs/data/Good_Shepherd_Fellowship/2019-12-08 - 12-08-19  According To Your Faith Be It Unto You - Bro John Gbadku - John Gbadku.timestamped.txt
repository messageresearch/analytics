[42:15] it's cool to be in the house of the Lord
[42:18] this morning
[42:20] Alleluia praise the Lord and we want to
[42:23] thank the Lord for giving us another
[42:25] opportunity to come and bring our
[42:31] praises to him praise the Lord
[42:33] and like brother scattered knowledge the
[42:39] ones that were baptized yesterday there
[42:42] was a privilege and our opportunity to
[42:44] take these dear ones down to the water
[42:46] praise the Lord
[42:48] amen can we just appreciate the law for
[42:51] there
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:57] [Music]
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:02] [Music]
[43:06] young Imam where was the one that
[43:08] request the baptism couple of months now
[43:12] and we've been trying to work out how to
[43:14] do it and then some time ago young
[43:25] Elijah said he has some questions for me
[43:27] and he says I want to tell you something
[43:30] but I have some questions for you praise
[43:34] the Lord in and so we got in the office
[43:36] and y-axes questions and and then after
[43:40] that he says I want to be baptized I
[43:43] said well okay
[43:44] praise the Lord then we had a privilege
[43:49] to talk with our young sister Priscilla
[43:54] last Sunday and what there is a pastor
[44:00] or in Angie real caliber had a privilege
[44:04] to talk to him yesterday and the young
[44:10] sister loved the Lord and but she just
[44:13] been having I mean she been terrified by
[44:17] the enemy you know with some very awful
[44:20] dreams and then so she didn't talk to me
[44:24] about it and why we were talking and you
[44:29] know and then
[44:34] actually if she was ever baptized she
[44:37] said no I said well you know we we
[44:45] accept the law by faith I call into
[44:47] Romans chapter 10 you know like Paul
[44:50] says if we believe with our heart and
[44:52] confess with our mouth you know we are
[44:55] safe but yet there you know our faith
[44:59] save us in a lord but baptism identify
[45:04] us with the body there was crucified for
[45:08] us that took our sin and I resurrected
[45:13] for our justification so we call a
[45:16] scepter law by faith but if we are never
[45:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:22] we are robbing ourselves of the benefit
[45:25] of the body of the Lord Jesus so I
[45:29] challenge her faith and she accepted to
[45:32] be baptized and it'll talk to her Darren
[45:35] and I did yesterday morning so we
[45:38] baptize her in the name of the Lord
[45:40] Jesus and young brother Joseph wanted to
[45:45] rededicate himself in baptism he was
[45:48] baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:51] from Christian Assembly they're over in
[45:54] ibadan and Julia but he just felt he
[45:57] needed to get closer to the Lord Amen
[46:01] praise the Lord so he rededicated
[46:04] himself in baptism yesterday and praise
[46:07] the Lord Amen so we want to thank the
[46:10] law for their praise the Lord so
[46:13] grateful that the Lord will be able to
[46:17] touch these young hats
[46:19] we pray that a law we kind of restraint
[46:22] in them thank you for all the brothers
[46:24] that came around to help yesterday
[46:26] brother Moses and all of the brothers we
[46:29] were thinking on what to do you know to
[46:32] be able to set up the Baptist raid and
[46:34] all of that so we're scare that was why
[46:37] we changed the time from 10:00 to 12:00
[46:40] because we kind of a pick it up Layton
[46:43] and setting it up and then you know
[46:48] brother in Zika came to also help us to
[46:51] just bring some little temperature to
[46:53] the water praise the Lord amen
[46:57] so we thank the Lord for their amen I
[47:00] told the young people yesterday I says
[47:03] the ones that are there don't decide
[47:04] where to be buried with their life we
[47:07] buried them where we want to bury them
[47:09] so so you don't have no decision whether
[47:14] the water is Cornell you are dead
[47:17] just except to be buried but then I had
[47:20] to identify myself also with the water
[47:22] so praise the Lord this morning we have
[47:26] brother John but Dooku from Togo
[47:31] naturally he's originally from Ghana
[47:34] went to Togo many years back in the 80s
[47:38] started a church there but John being a
[47:41] kind of a distant friend from me you
[47:44] know we have been knowing him many years
[47:46] and we met on Convention but then I
[47:51] started hearing of the work in bok'nor
[47:55] faso the work in malay and a little
[47:58] group that started sometime in audial

[48:12] know who started I work there who is the
[48:15] brother there you know and a lot of the
[48:18] history was pointed back to his church
[48:21] because most of the brothers that
[48:23] started there

[48:29] get in contact and then I heard he was
[48:32] over in the States

[1:01:15] match.you the ninth chapter Matthew
[1:01:22] chapter 9 I want to read on the 27th
[1:01:29] West I read in English and when Jesus
[1:01:35] departed thence to a blind men followed
[1:01:38] him crying and saying the our son of
[1:01:43] David have mercy on us and when he was
[1:01:49] come into the house the blind men came
[1:01:52] to him and Jesus said unto them believe
[1:01:58] me that I am able to do this they said
[1:02:01] unto Him yea Lord
[1:02:04] then touch ye the eyes
[1:02:08] same-same according to your faith with
[1:02:12] each and the eyes were opened and Jesus
[1:02:18] straitly charged them saying see that no
[1:02:23] man knows it but they they they went
[1:02:31] they were departed spread abroad is same
[1:02:36] in all the country metal ore that is
[1:02:42] rendering of the weight the megacity
[1:02:48] yeah we turned a lot for the scripture
[1:02:51] reg there's a well-known scripture I
[1:02:54] want to ponder over it for a few minutes
[1:02:59] and see what God has for us this morning
[1:03:07] the scripture speaks about two blind men
[1:03:11] that jesus healed a straight-ahead and
[1:03:21] when Jesus departed ends two blind men
[1:03:24] followed him crying ashamed out son of
[1:03:29] David have mercy on us and when he was
[1:03:35] coming to the house the blind men came
[1:03:38] to him and he says accident believe ye
[1:03:44] that I'm able to do this amen
[1:03:48] he says question them uttering them
[1:03:52] whether they believe that he's able to
[1:03:56] do what they were asking from him or
[1:04:00] whether they believe that he was able to
[1:04:04] heal them amen now before a man can be a
[1:04:10] blessing to you you need to believe him
[1:04:15] if we don't believe our pastor he cannot
[1:04:17] be a pleasant one
[1:04:18] if we don't believe our husbands they
[1:04:21] cannot be of blessing to us if we don't
[1:04:24] believe our wives they cannot be a
[1:04:26] blessing to us if our children doesn't
[1:04:29] believe us we cannot be a blessing to
[1:04:31] them likewise if we don't believe them
[1:04:34] they can also not be a blessing to us we
[1:04:37] found out here that it is very important
[1:04:40] that before somebody can be a blessing
[1:04:43] to you in a way you need to believe him
[1:04:46] so Jesus questioned them even though
[1:04:50] they came around crying shouting that he
[1:04:56] should have mercy on em
[1:04:59] he questioned them I can say it was a
[1:05:03] condition he put to them yeah you can
[1:05:07] only heal them or you can only do what
[1:05:09] they wanted him to do for them on the
[1:05:12] condition that they believe him
[1:05:14] amen there we finally hear that he
[1:05:19] tested them a demur spiritual test he
[1:05:25] tested the effect when he found out that
[1:05:28] they believed at him the scriptures say
[1:05:31] he touched their eyes and after touching
[1:05:35] their eyes he said unto them according
[1:05:39] to your faith be it unto you
[1:05:44] amen being small as a condition that he
[1:05:49] threw to them what you were looking for
[1:05:53] what you came for what you you are
[1:05:55] crying for
[1:05:56] I've caught your eyes but you need to
[1:06:00] have faith it would have done for you to
[1:06:04] be healed so he said according to your
[1:06:09] faith be it unto you
[1:06:11] I would like to use that sentence this
[1:06:17] morning as my topic or my team according
[1:06:22] to your faith be it unto you
[1:06:24] Amen now we we as believers we as method
[1:06:33] believers we as the bride of Jesus
[1:06:36] Christ we are said to be believers
[1:06:42] because we came by faith and we believe
[1:06:49] our Lord Jesus Christ and we separated
[1:06:53] ourselves from the world and it is of
[1:06:54] the world there are times situations
[1:06:59] demands faith situation call for faith
[1:07:04] sometimes we use faith without knowing
[1:07:07] and sometimes we need faith
[1:07:11] to use and we don't use it now what is
[1:07:17] faith
[1:07:19] what is faith we cannot use faith if we
[1:07:24] don't understand what faith is and thus
[1:07:28] creature explain what faith is to us in
[1:07:33] Hebrews the eleventh chapter faith in
[1:07:37] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:07:38] evidence of things not seen
[1:07:40] and the scripture said by it the elders
[1:07:45] obtained a good report the prophet of
[1:07:49] our age made us to know the faith is a
[1:07:51] revelation and then he went on to say
[1:07:56] effect is the sauce is the sixth sense
[1:07:59] he made us to know that we are born with
[1:08:02] it any time among or went we were given
[1:08:07] bath on his head we had the sixth sense
[1:08:11] but then we activity when we become
[1:08:15] believers and every believer is called
[1:08:20] to live by the sixth sense not the
[1:08:24] fashion sees because the five senses can
[1:08:26] deceive us here so we need to live by
[1:08:31] the sections the brother says the sixth
[1:08:34] sense is a super sense and the devil's
[1:08:38] honkin or widget earlier and when we
[1:08:42] activate our settings then we live in
[1:08:46] another dimension where people cannot
[1:08:50] understand us when the Gannon are far
[1:08:52] away when they can understand our
[1:08:54] behavior we would not understand
[1:08:56] addressing do not understand the way we
[1:08:59] speak because we are living in another
[1:09:02] dimension
[1:09:04] amen we use fit and the Christianity is
[1:09:13] based on fit whatever one does he need
[1:09:20] to do it by faith I believe this morning
[1:09:23] we came here by faith the Prophet said
[1:09:27] sometimes we go out to wake and we tell
[1:09:31] our wife let me go and come when you say
[1:09:34] how do you know you were coming back
[1:09:36] but by faith you said you are going and
[1:09:39] then you be coming but so they also go
[1:09:41] to the grocery store they said husband
[1:09:44] let me go to the shop and come they go
[1:09:46] and come they say oh this is by faith
[1:09:50] and a believer works by faith that not
[1:09:55] sight if we go back to the scripture we
[1:10:00] found out that God himself
[1:10:03] I call the prophet youssef it when he
[1:10:05] was creating the world the Prophet said
[1:10:09] he spoke the word and he believed it
[1:10:13] away is a letter delight and he
[1:10:16] delivered that word and it was making
[1:10:19] manifesting however what we say we need
[1:10:22] to believe it amen
[1:10:24] our confessions we have to believe it
[1:10:28] and as we believe it our body will obey
[1:10:33] our confession according to your faith
[1:10:40] if we say according to our Norfolk what
[1:10:42] are we trying to say we're trying to
[1:10:46] figure it out as a matter of individual
[1:10:50] faith according to my faith according to
[1:10:53] your faith when he returned people come
[1:10:56] to church and we see two people sitting
[1:10:58] alongside one another they may have
[1:11:02] problem and at the same ministry the
[1:11:05] same part of Richmond and maybe he will
[1:11:08] ask if you have any dress up your hand
[1:11:11] and the two of them eligible on the one
[1:11:14] who receive what IRA's
[1:11:17] be handful but the other one who not
[1:11:19] receive it is according to the effect so
[1:11:23] this morning I want us to activate our
[1:11:26] feet our us to believe what we are in
[1:11:34] for for by each God will do great things
[1:11:38] in our life and we are live in a time
[1:11:42] when you cannot make it with our faith
[1:11:48] maybe it would be different America been
[1:11:52] Africa some people have to walk several
[1:11:55] miles to come to church it is difficult
[1:12:01] when somebody has a kinda catch then we
[1:12:04] say is well to do like my church is only
[1:12:09] three people died after the rest have to
[1:12:12] walk and come to judge others have to
[1:12:16] drive on the our motorbike uses a
[1:12:19] brother
[1:12:19] currently the wife and two children at
[1:12:23] the back very dangerous but by faith to
[1:12:26] believe that God will bring them to
[1:12:29] church and the cottage and they go we
[1:12:36] need faith more in doing everything
[1:12:41] without faith you cannot make it and
[1:12:44] it's individual fate now somebody's
[1:12:48] faith when we come to Christ we need to
[1:12:53] have faith we don't come because maybe a
[1:12:57] brother came or a wife or somebody now
[1:13:02] if it is that way then it means that we
[1:13:05] are living by the shadow of somebody's
[1:13:09] face and when that fellow fails you feel
[1:13:13] wonderful about slight you but life it
[1:13:19] is an individual faith and what does
[1:13:23] this money to look at one or two people
[1:13:26] that demonstrated the effects
[1:13:29] Jesus Christ himself acquainted word of
[1:13:33] God must use faith to live and believe
[1:13:39] what was written of him he need to
[1:13:42] believe that way he died
[1:13:43] he'll be resurrected because the
[1:13:46] scripture said my holy one would not see
[1:13:48] corruption he need to believe it
[1:13:52] Jesus need to have faith hallelujah if
[1:13:57] Jesus and it fits how much more we we
[1:14:02] may need more faith than he needed faith
[1:14:08] according to your faith I want us to
[1:14:13] look at Abraham who was called from
[1:14:16] paganism and he separated himself he
[1:14:22] studied the journey of faith God gave
[1:14:28] him a promise and we know Abraham was an
[1:14:33] ordinary man like any one any of us that
[1:14:38] God called him and he responded to the
[1:14:42] call and he took off by the Liddy's of
[1:14:46] God by faith and anything he did he did
[1:14:52] it by faith finally God gave me a
[1:14:57] promise of a son the scripture said
[1:15:00] Abram continue believing God daily
[1:15:05] he might have is called the wife might
[1:15:09] have this curved they might make fun of
[1:15:11] him but Abraham continue believing God
[1:15:17] until about 25 years Sara took seat and
[1:15:25] gave to a baby boy according to the
[1:15:30] promise of God it was according to the
[1:15:35] fate of Abraham
[1:15:36] no one believed that on his behalf
[1:15:42] all those who were in those days who
[1:15:46] knew that Abraham has been given a
[1:15:51] promise and Sarah not being able to take
[1:15:55] seed might have this coffin making fun
[1:15:59] of him but Abraham continued to believe
[1:16:03] God
[1:16:05] he knew that he that has made a promise
[1:16:08] is able to fulfill his promise even
[1:16:11] though it tarries
[1:16:11] it will surely come to pass and Abram
[1:16:16] stood by his fate until the promise was
[1:16:20] fulfilled
[1:16:21] it was Abraham's faith amen
[1:16:27] when he gave us the scripture said it
[1:16:30] happened that God once they call him
[1:16:33] wanted to test his faith and ask him to
[1:16:37] go sacrifice Isaac his holy song that he
[1:16:44] took over 25 years to give them true God
[1:16:47] said I don't need anything for a
[1:16:49] sacrifice but I want Isaac
[1:16:53] many a times God who is a jealous God
[1:16:59] make sure that we don't put anything
[1:17:02] before him as I professed anything he
[1:17:05] put before God becomes an idol so God
[1:17:09] wanted to see the faith of Abraham
[1:17:11] whether he put int Isaac before him or
[1:17:17] not and a scripture said by faith Abram
[1:17:21] took off for where he was to sacrifice
[1:17:25] son and he went there said the author
[1:17:31] found a child even before Bonnie -
[1:17:36] editor asked him father where is the
[1:17:39] lamb for the sacrifice Abrams spoke my
[1:17:42] faith that God will provide himself a
[1:17:44] sacrifice I believe if we were there
[1:17:49] when God told him to use I said for a
[1:17:53] sacrifice would
[1:17:54] Ronnie's a liar but he spoke by faith he
[1:17:58] spoke as a believer you know believers
[1:18:02] must not be having negative thoughts no
[1:18:05] we must always have positive story the
[1:18:08] future as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:18:10] he's so ready to speak by faith the
[1:18:16] scripture said when he finally was going
[1:18:20] to start his own NGO called him the
[1:18:24] second time is up Abraham I now know
[1:18:28] that you really believe in me you have
[1:18:31] obeyed me you did not deny using your
[1:18:34] son your only son for a sacrifice for me
[1:18:38] and God's Word by himself had him
[1:18:41] blessing I'm going to bless you and if
[1:18:44] we add the royalties of Abraham that we
[1:18:46] must live by the faith of Abraham a
[1:18:49] hallelujah according to your faith we
[1:18:55] found out here that Abraham did obey God
[1:19:01] by faith according to you of it Daniel
[1:19:09] in the land of bondage the scripture
[1:19:14] said his prayer people were offended
[1:19:23] because of his prayer and finally to
[1:19:29] stop him from praying you have to who
[1:19:33] counsel against our a Daniel the
[1:19:37] scripture said the Kings signed a decree
[1:19:41] that nobody should pray to any other God
[1:19:46] how do we know the story but Daniel by
[1:19:52] faith did not look at the decree Daniel
[1:20:00] by faith do not look at the danger that
[1:20:05] ahead we go whosoever disobey they
[1:20:10] decree of the king need to be thrown
[1:20:15] into the Lions then it need to be
[1:20:19] devolved by the Lions but Daniel
[1:20:23] believer his God knowing very well that
[1:20:28] window he continued frame him been
[1:20:33] arrested and thrown into the line of
[1:20:36] them his God will save him so he
[1:20:41] continued free in the scripture said the
[1:20:45] information went out he was arrested and
[1:20:49] he was thrown into the Lions Den
[1:20:52] thinking that before the following
[1:20:54] morning the lion would duvall him they
[1:20:57] behold they came to see Daniel have any
[1:21:01] a prayer meeting have any praises with
[1:21:03] the Lions
[1:21:04] the prophet said it was by faith he said
[1:21:09] he used the six things which is faith
[1:21:14] redness the Lord we eliminate time we
[1:21:19] have all that we needed to meet the
[1:21:21] rapture we have the message we have the
[1:21:24] Word of God it's really interpreted in
[1:21:27] two different languages the message has
[1:21:30] been interpreted in two different
[1:21:31] languages we have them at our disposal
[1:21:34] but what we need is to have faith in
[1:21:38] them the scripture said the Israelites
[1:21:42] did not reach the promised land because
[1:21:45] the gospel that was preached to them
[1:21:47] they did not miss it we need faith they
[1:21:50] did not believe it and because of that
[1:21:53] many of them were thrown in the
[1:21:59] wilderness God through them or kill them
[1:22:03] in the wilderness because what they
[1:22:06] believe it they cross without a free to
[1:22:08] them the message that was preached to
[1:22:12] them they did
[1:22:14] method with the effect they did not
[1:22:16] believe it it was done by it in
[1:22:19] otherwise they did not look at it the
[1:22:24] way God they betray his servants to
[1:22:28] preach it so God was no longer happy
[1:22:33] with them and they were thrown in the
[1:22:38] wilderness according to your faith amen
[1:22:46] the tree Hebrews they also use faith
[1:22:50] at a difficult time when all the
[1:22:58] believers in those days need to bow down
[1:23:01] to an image but they said we are not
[1:23:06] going to do it
[1:23:07] I know there might be other believers in
[1:23:12] those days or the Hebrews into this I
[1:23:14] was okay we we all know we are in a in
[1:23:18] bondage with an assailant why not we
[1:23:21] just sacrified do it and they won't go
[1:23:24] back on we go and put this right
[1:23:27] Shadrach Meshach Abednego they said no
[1:23:29] we are not going to do it they stood by
[1:23:31] the effect that even though our God did
[1:23:34] not serve us we know at a bit of
[1:23:36] resolution we are going to be
[1:23:38] resurrected it's according to fit my
[1:23:43] brother my sister this is the time of
[1:23:47] imitating somebody when they saw the
[1:23:51] time of infestation it's the time that
[1:23:53] you know God is dealing with you as an
[1:23:58] individual this is the time you should
[1:24:00] know your stand this assignment should
[1:24:03] know who the time you should know
[1:24:06] hallelujah
[1:24:07] then the father said if they said there
[1:24:09] is only one person in our area that is
[1:24:12] going to rupture you must be able to say
[1:24:15] you are that person and you cannot say
[1:24:20] this by with our faith it is a matter of
[1:24:23] faith you will serve this even though
[1:24:26] you have many child
[1:24:27] in your life you said this with maybe
[1:24:31] there are many things you are not able
[1:24:33] to do but you believe I couldn't the
[1:24:36] Word of God that once a bride of Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ and you were known before the
[1:24:45] foundation of the world and God made a
[1:24:47] way for you you will surely go
[1:24:50] if by faith hallelujah
[1:24:55] according to your faith Hannah who was
[1:25:00] born in Hades with another by faith when
[1:25:06] she was Miss Kaufman father by people
[1:25:11] one day when they came to church I would
[1:25:14] say they came to church like today I
[1:25:17] know she would not be the only boring
[1:25:20] person in that time after the church was
[1:25:23] closed she stayed behind by faith you
[1:25:27] are believer that if she could go before
[1:25:28] God in desperation praying got my wallet
[1:25:33] or something so she stayed behind and
[1:25:37] was praying the scripture said the
[1:25:39] priests head he had her nepeta but what
[1:25:42] is that making that way he came around
[1:25:44] to see he's Ohana I said oh maybe this
[1:25:47] woman might have drawn her he said I'm
[1:25:50] not run I'm pouring my heart to the Lord
[1:25:54] the promise that she prayed and then
[1:25:57] made a father that if God should give
[1:26:01] her a child she will in turn give the
[1:26:05] child to the Lord and because of that
[1:26:09] when God was going to give her a child
[1:26:12] God give her a boy and a prophet
[1:26:16] hallelujah because she's not at she did
[1:26:20] not as a selfish Lee God always look at
[1:26:24] our motives and our objectives
[1:26:27] because she asked and promised that if
[1:26:33] God give her a child he will tend give
[1:26:37] the child to God God the Prophet said
[1:26:41] give her a prophet hallelujah and behold
[1:26:45] she fulfilled her promise
[1:26:48] there are various times when we fire we
[1:26:51] make promises but when the time when God
[1:26:54] has done his part we find something
[1:26:55] funny difficult to do apart but that was
[1:26:59] not the case of Hannah ah ha really it
[1:27:02] was by faith many a times we go through
[1:27:08] certain difficulties setting her ships
[1:27:11] but will it fit to be able to come out
[1:27:16] of it not just saying it to people but
[1:27:23] believing God standing by the Word of
[1:27:25] God taking God holding God at His Word
[1:27:32] saying that that promise is fulfilled is
[1:27:35] according to your faith and individual
[1:27:40] faith jobbing is this private vendors to
[1:27:45] know that in his day there are so Bible
[1:27:52] but he lived by inspiration which today
[1:27:58] we have Bibles in different languages we
[1:28:04] have that grace but in the days of job
[1:28:06] they also have oh he lived by
[1:28:11] inspiration and the scripture said he
[1:28:16] pleased God and to God bless him when
[1:28:19] Adam was not happy with job until the
[1:28:24] Jordan ever went before the Lord trying
[1:28:28] to accuse oh because God has blessed him
[1:28:32] everything's going on well that is why
[1:28:34] he's worshipped in God and if God will
[1:28:37] allow
[1:28:39] that the devil who tempt him he would
[1:28:42] deny God that God didn't believe it he
[1:28:47] allow the devil to go I said don't touch
[1:28:50] his life and we know the life of showed
[1:28:54] his children is coddled all that he own
[1:28:59] order he asked was the destroy a job
[1:29:04] continue believe in the Lord it reach a
[1:29:08] place the wife who supposed to be the
[1:29:13] closest person to comfort him or
[1:29:17] encouraging the wife told her why not
[1:29:22] you just forget about God and die as a
[1:29:27] woman why do you speak like a foolish
[1:29:30] woman God has given and if he's taking
[1:29:33] work but I don't want him even though
[1:29:37] the scheming destroy my body I know one
[1:29:41] day that I'll see God and I'll see it
[1:29:43] for myself
[1:29:44] he spoke by French a scripture said it
[1:29:49] reach a place job could not stay among
[1:29:52] people they are to isolate him he has to
[1:29:59] be kept at a place where they does the
[1:30:02] trash they did that means the where they
[1:30:07] threw the trash that's why I was and
[1:30:12] there's nobody to help him maybe the
[1:30:17] broken stones that he finds what he used
[1:30:19] to scratch his body just to have a
[1:30:27] little tease little comfort but a
[1:30:32] scripture say he is truth know very well
[1:30:35] that no matter what happens he is God
[1:30:40] will never fail him it was by faith
[1:30:46] it was the fate of job another fit of
[1:30:51] the wife if we read the scripture well
[1:30:55] many of his friend might have accused
[1:30:59] him maybe you have a secrecy maybe I've
[1:31:04] done something wrong we don't believe
[1:31:07] that God can treat a child of God I did
[1:31:10] you know this statement would even worse
[1:31:13] than jobs a condition but he stood by
[1:31:18] his faith now looking at these
[1:31:22] accusations now looking at this and this
[1:31:27] discouraging words he believed that his
[1:31:31] God until the right time God has to move
[1:31:38] in short life it's according to the fit
[1:31:43] of job God cannot do nothing in a man's
[1:31:48] life without first believing it with our
[1:31:52] face have any faith in God and in the
[1:31:56] Word of God so we found out here that by
[1:32:01] the faith of job God protein all that
[1:32:09] was lost God healed him God changed the
[1:32:15] condition God made him a different
[1:32:19] person all together it was by his faith
[1:32:25] we need fit in everything that we are
[1:32:28] doing when effect to pray when affair to
[1:32:35] come to church when affect to meet our
[1:32:40] obligations as Christians because if you
[1:32:44] don't have faith you cannot do it I'm
[1:32:48] not talking about the number of years
[1:32:49] that you've been a Christian no I'm not
[1:32:52] against you but what
[1:32:56] famous at a particular situation at a
[1:33:00] particular time you need fit to
[1:33:05] demonstrate your Christianity the
[1:33:07] demonstrator you I believer to
[1:33:10] demonstrate a you're a brother of Jesus
[1:33:11] Christ to demonstrate and you know what
[1:33:13] you are doing fit individual fit when
[1:33:21] Jesus Christ was here or not a schedule
[1:33:24] made us to know that there was a
[1:33:26] Centurion that came to Jesus at one time
[1:33:30] this big man this general he approaches
[1:33:37] in a polite way
[1:33:42] he approaches us with respect even
[1:33:46] though he wasn't a believer the
[1:33:49] scripture said he knew that his sound
[1:33:54] that was sick
[1:33:55] Jesus who healed the son so when he came
[1:34:01] to Jesus he told uses and I am a big man
[1:34:07] I have people under my command when I
[1:34:10] say go there go when I said and they
[1:34:12] come I have servants and I watch you
[1:34:14] beat me there's no need for you to come
[1:34:17] to my house I only want you to see awake
[1:34:22] and my child will be healed and asleep I
[1:34:26] said this is look at this one except for
[1:34:33] this scene hallelujah and he went on to
[1:34:37] say the whole Israel have never seen
[1:34:43] such a type of it this is a great feat
[1:34:47] earlier but this morning God is not
[1:34:51] looking for a great faith is that if you
[1:34:54] have a faith like a mustard seed you
[1:34:57] could command mountains to move and
[1:35:01] they'll move and I don't believe this
[1:35:04] one that there's somebody whose problems
[1:35:06] are greater than a mountain
[1:35:09] and if we need a most acid fit to be
[1:35:14] able to move Mountain then we will need
[1:35:18] something small to move our problems
[1:35:24] earlier so we found out that this until
[1:35:28] Yin by his feet his child was with who
[1:35:34] not somebody's with he fit hallelujah
[1:35:40] maybe many people will have discouraged
[1:35:43] him when he was coming nearer but he
[1:35:48] believed ik and as he go to Jesus Jesus
[1:35:52] must really do something that is eternal
[1:35:56] we are living in according to your faith
[1:36:02] if we go further there was a woman who
[1:36:10] are suffering for a bloody shoe the
[1:36:14] scripture said she has pain all - she
[1:36:19] has just obtained healing and all
[1:36:23] attempt feel the one day away he had
[1:36:28] said that Jesus was having a meeting
[1:36:30] somewhere she came around when she till
[1:36:38] she did not go to the apostles did not
[1:36:42] go to anybody I said she broke protocol
[1:36:47] ago she has first aunty told her that if
[1:36:50] I'll be able to go touch the hem of His
[1:36:54] garment I'll be healed who taught her
[1:37:01] where did he learned it from she
[1:37:05] delivered it by faith earlier I promise
[1:37:10] that somewhere that's a Korea even a
[1:37:14] priest when the angel came and gave him
[1:37:19] promise even though he has imporant
[1:37:21] women
[1:37:22] the basepart that took seed he doubted
[1:37:28] but this woman they don't learn it from
[1:37:31] anybody it was by faith and the Prophet
[1:37:35] said this woman use the fact that was in
[1:37:40] Jesus Christ used the gibbet was in
[1:37:43] Jesus Christ
[1:37:43] a monk I used a gate is somebody you can
[1:37:49] use the gift that is in your posture
[1:37:53] the woman operated the gift that was in
[1:37:56] Jesus the prophecy that is why this has
[1:37:59] first week because the woman operated
[1:38:04] the gift as that way Jesus was saying
[1:38:07] that somebody has touched me
[1:38:09] he says man what he was saying because I
[1:38:11] never knew he only felt he was getting
[1:38:15] weak and then he started acid somebody
[1:38:22] has taught me a little where somebody
[1:38:26] has touched me Peter and the other
[1:38:28] disciple scenario Beauty will make a
[1:38:31] statement like this same people stepping
[1:38:34] on you pushing you bring all manner of
[1:38:39] this and you said somebody has taught
[1:38:41] you is a yes somebody has taught me
[1:38:43] because a virtue has gone out of me the
[1:38:50] filter search the omen came and knelt
[1:38:53] before him is that your faith has made
[1:38:57] you whole go in peace my doctor Alfred
[1:39:08] can transform our life
[1:39:11] our faith can lead us up to a higher
[1:39:14] ground effort can help us obtained
[1:39:18] healing according to your faith although
[1:39:24] we are talking about this morning
[1:39:27] faith is what we need in the Word of God
[1:39:33] yep that's what we need in our Christian
[1:39:35] life anytime there's a sermon preached
[1:39:39] the pastor preached a sermon you need
[1:39:41] faith to receive it you need faith to
[1:39:45] repent you need faith to put in right in
[1:39:48] your life according to your faith there
[1:39:56] was another woman the same profanation
[1:39:59] woman who's the tower sick I gave to
[1:40:05] Jesus that Jesus might have prayed for
[1:40:12] they tried to be healed or do something
[1:40:14] by Jesus would remind this woman until
[1:40:18] finally the disciples have to call the
[1:40:21] attention of Jesus the one ought to do
[1:40:23] something to this woman for who should
[1:40:26] find her wish his yes determine that
[1:40:28] following us he says then to the woman
[1:40:31] as a woman I want to tell you that
[1:40:37] children's bread cannot be given to dogs
[1:40:44] jailbreaker no big Negro and a promise I
[1:40:48] went Jesus made this statement the old
[1:40:52] man said I agree that I'm a dog I
[1:40:55] believe it but I have not come in for
[1:40:58] the children's bread but I know one
[1:41:02] thing when children eat the crumbs for
[1:41:05] on the ground so I've come for the
[1:41:08] crumbs if I can get the crumbs a mookee
[1:41:16] yes look at this you know this really
[1:41:18] effect is a real demonstration of it
[1:41:25] we need feet that statement I don't
[1:41:29] think I'd be made in the time that we
[1:41:31] are living in for a pastor to tell to
[1:41:35] make that statement to a church member
[1:41:36] ah they'll be fire they'll be fire now
[1:41:44] it has tend to call in your church
[1:41:46] member drugs but this woman by faith God
[1:41:53] revelation of what Jesus was saying and
[1:41:55] he responded and the scripture said
[1:42:01] Jesus did what she wanted to hear it was
[1:42:07] according to the fifth her faith
[1:42:11] hallelujah
[1:42:12] when I say aloud many a times we can
[1:42:18] support people with our faith but the
[1:42:24] more of it is individual must have it
[1:42:28] individual matter of it when the prophet
[1:42:33] studies me free will and the angel told
[1:42:37] him that if you can't let the people
[1:42:41] believe you if the people can believe
[1:42:44] you and many other way is praying for
[1:42:47] people
[1:42:47] the ask them do you believe me you
[1:42:51] believe me to be a son of a man of God
[1:42:54] do you believe before he prays for them
[1:42:57] he wants to see fit in them this morning
[1:43:03] I don't know who you are I don't know
[1:43:05] the problem that you have but if you
[1:43:08] can't have faith individual faith you

[1:43:28] name but Hamas in the days of Allah
[1:43:32] Jesus praise the scripture said he goes
[1:43:39] to the roadside to beg for money well
[1:43:42] one day I went he was sitting at the
[1:43:43] normal place begging for money hear the
[1:43:47] noise
[1:43:47] then he questioned why is that not that
[1:43:50] for nothing
[1:43:50] not noise for I said is Jesus of
[1:43:54] Nazareth is coming they started crying
[1:43:58] at the top of his voice son of David

[1:44:06] Arabic you are making one right
[1:44:08] disturbing us we want a peace of mind he
[1:44:11] didn't even listen to them
[1:44:13] he continues shouting son of David I
[1:44:16] didn't know where the following I cannot
[1:44:17] see truly continues shouting shouting
[1:44:21] and a prophet said he's fed stop Jesus
[1:44:27] when Jesus arrived he stopped and also
[1:44:33] community between him and Jesus and
[1:44:34] finally Jesus asked him what do you want
[1:44:37] me to do is I want to see a well then
[1:44:44] Jesus said let it be a quality of it
[1:44:48] amen his faith stopped decided or the
[1:44:53] Prophet said and by his faith his eyes
[1:44:58] were opened if we read the story of
[1:45:03] Baltimore he was a believer because all
[1:45:13] the wind in his life every promise that
[1:45:16] he made he fulfill it even the lump that
[1:45:21] was leading him little play when he made
[1:45:24] a vow that he will use went
[1:45:27] you sacrifice a lump to God he did it
[1:45:32] even the priests try to discourage him
[1:45:37] from doing it the priest wanted to do to
[1:45:41] help him get another lamp is that no
[1:45:44] it's not a done is this lump Vera is
[1:45:47] feet and God honored our feet by having
[1:45:55] his eyes opened according to your faith
[1:46:01] amen I just look at the life of a
[1:46:07] prophet when he was ministering the
[1:46:17] message said he was invited to pray for
[1:46:24] a second woman and the message entitled
[1:46:30] fate is a sorceress and when he went to
[1:46:34] the room to go pray for the woman if
[1:46:39] honor that the woman was no half with
[1:46:41] faith when they were conversing he said
[1:46:45] you don't have faith almond used to be a
[1:46:48] Christian in a denomination affect the
[1:46:52] professor you don't have it and called
[1:46:56] the message there was a bracelet hanging
[1:46:59] there a prophet oh hey if you have it
[1:47:04] move that bracelet to this direction and
[1:47:07] bring it back again is that so possible
[1:47:12] how can a man do this and the master
[1:47:16] said the professor himself demonstrated
[1:47:19] the Prophet look at it and then the
[1:47:23] first light got off from weight was and
[1:47:26] him moving in there to the other
[1:47:30] direction and coming back again she was
[1:47:33] surprised what's astonish she has a
[1:47:36] prophet what it is it is God or the
[1:47:39] devil
[1:47:40] it's not God not as it is me faith does
[1:47:49] many things on you say this morning that
[1:47:53] there are many things that happens in a
[1:47:55] believers life is because of unbelief we
[1:47:59] call ourself Christians we come to check
[1:48:02] Norma we do other we supposed to do but
[1:48:06] we lack faith that is needed at a time
[1:48:10] to do something and as a result we go
[1:48:15] through different things but this
[1:48:17] morning let us come back to fit amen
[1:48:22] I remember they brought him a crippled
[1:48:26] girl to be prayed for and according to
[1:48:32] the message the prophet went nearer to
[1:48:38] the girl to pray for the girl by the
[1:48:43] Prophet found out that she was not
[1:48:45] having faith for the problem left a
[1:48:48] crippled girl and then continued with a
[1:48:54] prayer line and why he was doing it he
[1:48:58] had her faith mounted and was beating a
[1:49:05] perfect stop what he was doing came
[1:49:08] around a little pray for the girl and
[1:49:10] she was made whole they took her
[1:49:14] crutches away
[1:49:17] what we need is faith the professor
[1:49:22] where your first jobs is where you
[1:49:23] stopped and the way we are prayed for
[1:49:27] and you believe that you are healed when
[1:49:31] doubt come in the sickness may come back
[1:49:36] this morning if you lose your faith and
[1:49:41] you claim you are no longer a believer
[1:49:45] before tomorrow morning
[1:49:47] although you left some years ago you go
[1:49:51] back to them
[1:49:53] faith is what we need
[1:49:56] I remember when Jesus Christ was here
[1:50:01] let's keep harmony has to know that he
[1:50:09] walk on the sea to meet his disciples in
[1:50:12] the boat and when they saw him they were
[1:50:16] frightened think it was a ghost
[1:50:19] well I told them it is me do not be
[1:50:22] afraid because edifis you beat me to
[1:50:25] come and escape I said Peter started
[1:50:28] walking towards him they went he saw how
[1:50:34] the wind was written estamos Rouen he
[1:50:38] was gripped with fear and he was going
[1:50:40] to sink and he says took him by hand it
[1:50:45] will read further this I said is because
[1:50:50] of your little faith is because the fit
[1:50:55] that you would you started with you
[1:50:58] could not continue with the offense that
[1:51:00] is why I was thinking it was the same
[1:51:04] boat at the same water the same person
[1:51:09] but because he lose weight he was
[1:51:15] thinking my brother my sister my advice
[1:51:20] for you this morning is go through your
[1:51:23] faith
[1:51:24] go to the fete on the way go to the fete
[1:51:28] of the message the fate of the Word of
[1:51:31] God and you would make it
[1:51:39] individual fate
[1:51:41] hallelujah but at the time this was
[1:51:47] Medici support after taking the boat of
[1:51:53] Pizza and then he preached he wanted to
[1:51:57] recompense him so he asked them to go to
[1:52:01] see a scripture said Peter told him we
[1:52:07] have tried all night I am a fisherman to
[1:52:11] begin with I started fishing when I was
[1:52:15] young I know the science of fishing when
[1:52:20] there's going to be a good catch I know
[1:52:21] when there's not going to be a good
[1:52:23] coach I know I know the technique of
[1:52:24] fishing but we told you all night we
[1:52:28] couldn't get anything yes I said Peter
[1:52:34] you need to go
[1:52:36] so Peter replied nevertheless according
[1:52:41] to the wait I'll go amen
[1:52:46] Peter believer the word of Jesus Christ
[1:52:49] Peter took him by his word by faith and
[1:52:54] a scripture said when they went they had
[1:52:57] a easy catch until they could not bring
[1:53:02] it alone they are to invite other people
[1:53:04] to come and join them sometimes when we
[1:53:08] take God by his word and he blesses arts
[1:53:11] our brothers and our sisters also enjoy
[1:53:13] our blessing
[1:53:17] amen nevertheless according to the
[1:53:22] weight he had the heaviest catch they
[1:53:28] never had and he's relatively it was the
[1:53:32] same boat
[1:53:34] it was the same sea water
[1:53:37] it was the same net and it was the same
[1:53:41] people but he had a heavy catch is all
[1:53:49] fit this morning I don't want to go far

[1:54:00] short sermon faith is what we need we
[1:54:07] need to have faith in one another

[2:17:17] team never went with Bible he was not
[2:17:20] going to preach but he had to preach
[2:17:22] because the people were there praise the
[2:17:25] Lord
[2:17:26] so yeah you know do unto others as you
[2:17:30] want them to do unto you I'm just
[2:17:37] quoting the scripture now amen
[2:17:41] but we appreciate the Word of God this
[2:17:44] money amen you know faith is the
[2:17:49] substance one of the substance that
[2:17:51] their faith produces in the life of the
[2:17:54] believer it makes you to believe you
[2:17:57] know know what you are doing
[2:17:59] amen and I will tell you that we here
[2:18:05] this morning I mean this Tabernacle this
[2:18:09] church and this church is going to
[2:18:12] remain here not in this place but remain
[2:18:16] as a church as long as God gave us
[2:18:19] people to believe what we are doing here
[2:18:22] amen we're not just making another
[2:18:25] Church here we are raising a body amen
[2:18:30] we are raising the body that we believe
[2:18:32] that we are investing in a lie
[2:18:34] of our self we are investing in the life
[2:18:37] of one another praise the Lord
[2:18:41] but Branham says you can you don't you
[2:18:44] will not be able to do anything right
[2:18:46] until you know what you are doing and
[2:18:48] that's why we we expect you know the
[2:18:53] musicians is just there to play music is
[2:18:57] to bring worship to the Lord the singers
[2:19:02] the songs every little leading the song
[2:19:05] as sober task at 40 in this morning
[2:19:07] bringing us into worship and sometimes
[2:19:09] we just sit there what it takes to raise
[2:19:14] your hands to the Lord praise the Lord
[2:19:21] you have to reload that like like old
[2:19:27] but alone he said he says God is our
[2:19:29] audience and we are we are the one that
[2:19:34] is honor he's the one that is watching
[2:19:36] us watching our attitude in worship it's
[2:19:42] all of those things that create faith
[2:19:44] all we come to do here is just to create
[2:19:47] an atmosphere of faith for people to
[2:19:51] receive the desires of their heart
[2:19:57] that's the thing that brings us to
[2:19:59] church on time that's the thing that
[2:20:01] brings us to church pray up that's the
[2:20:04] thing that brings us to church we come
[2:20:06] and we we prayed before the service
[2:20:09] stands and that is faith because faith
[2:20:13] with action is dead even our faith in
[2:20:24] God we have to believe he's a Living God
[2:20:28] we believe that he knows us he knows our
[2:20:31] our our form he knows what we are made
[2:20:33] out of and he will accept us just as we
[2:20:36] are that's the thing that make us to
[2:20:40] constantly goes to him praise the Lord
[2:20:46] amen let's keep believing in ourselves
[2:20:50] now we had the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:20:53] there's no rapture with us we are a New
[2:20:56] Testament church amen
[2:20:59] we are church that is set on the hill
[2:21:03] there is no time to hire our light
[2:21:06] praise the Lord
[2:21:08] we are already on the hill praise the
[2:21:13] Lord
[2:21:16] so the Lord bless you and I mean I just
[2:21:25] took down some little notes of
[2:21:27] encouragement year but you know as as
[2:21:30] brought john nation blonde bottommost
[2:21:33] let me share this with you maybe some of
[2:21:35] you people knew that i was listening to
[2:21:38] a message recently brother Branham was
[2:21:40] talking about Lamba Timo's and he
[2:21:43] started talking about Blom Bharti Muslim
[2:21:45] that led him and he says he says the
[2:21:50] reason why they use lamb those days
[2:21:53] because the Jews did not believe in dogs
[2:21:59] and I never saw that I I know that in
[2:22:03] the Old Testament
[2:22:05] and-and-and-and the price of a dog was
[2:22:09] abominable to the Jews but you see you
[2:22:13] see to be able to make sense of that
[2:22:16] over and over brother Branham talked
[2:22:17] down story how blond bottom was her
[2:22:20] alarm leading him
[2:22:21] I just wouldn't fit it in my mind how
[2:22:24] can the line lead a man he says those
[2:22:27] lambs were trained like dogs
[2:22:29] he said because they were dogs were
[2:22:32] abominable onto the juice man it just
[2:22:38] blew my mind
[2:22:40] you know that God dropped those things
[2:22:43] down it just bring a perfect honestly
[2:22:45] because Iran right in line with the
[2:22:47] scripture they will never bring the
[2:22:51] price of a dog to the house of God and
[2:22:57] now
[2:22:58] for the very same reason when Jesus told
[2:23:01] that woman I can give bread the
[2:23:03] children's bread to dogs
[2:23:07] now what was he calling the children's
[2:23:09] bread healing healing is the children's
[2:23:12] bread so if you are sick you must be
[2:23:16] able to go for the children's bread if
[2:23:19] you are a child of God you must believe
[2:23:21] God because healing is the children's
[2:23:27] bread so when he said I can take the
[2:23:31] children's bread and give it to dogs and
[2:23:33] that that was the thing that that their
[2:23:35] stool out to Jesus when a woman who
[2:23:39] except that she was a Gentile but yet
[2:23:47] the dogs can benefit from the crumbs
[2:23:52] praise the Lord
[2:24:06] so as brother John said that this money
[2:24:09] just just pop out in my mind and I just
[2:24:12] what I just got I just got a note that a
[2:24:16] little bit and remind myself amen praise
[2:24:18] the Lord how beautiful the Word of God
[2:24:22] is and the scripture says pressures are
[2:24:25] the feet of them that I bring the Word
[2:24:27] of God amen
[2:24:31] but we want to wish you a wonderful week
[2:24:34] amen and God you take our greetings dear
[2:24:39] to the brothers there in Toledo and
