[29:19] Christ
[29:21] amen
[29:24] amen yeah I thank God that
[29:27] we are here together again
[29:30] he has to Fellowship around his word
[29:31] amen amen amen
[29:35] amen amen amen yeah I believe
[29:40] um I was here one time that was I think
[29:43] 2019 or 2018 something like that I don't
[29:47] know how many I could have seen me that
[29:48] time
[29:49] yeah God bless you
[29:51] so
[29:53] I bring you greetings from
[29:56] Uganda
[29:58] especially for my family
[30:01] and also the church
[30:04] yeah they know that I'm here today
[30:08] and I believe
[30:10] we are
[30:12] praying for us
[30:14] though I think at this time they could
[30:17] be sleeping almost waking up
[30:20] amen
[30:22] yeah so
[30:24] may God bless you so much
[30:27] and we thank God that we have been able
[30:29] to come
[30:30] in the house of the Lord
[30:33] as David says I was happy when they say
[30:35] that to me let's go in the house of the
[30:38] Lord
[30:40] because I think brother Brown says this
[30:43] is the best the best place
[30:46] for us to be
[30:48] and you know the devil will always try
[30:50] to fight yes so that you don't come in
[30:53] the house alone
[30:54] yeah but I believe
[30:57] this is where we come to meet God amen
[31:00] amen
[31:02] amen yeah because
[31:04] as we have been arrested back
[31:07] to the Garden of Eden
[31:09] amen
[31:11] we are going to come every evening
[31:14] any fellowship with Adam
[31:16] amen until sin came and separated
[31:21] but we thank God
[31:23] amen amen that God sent us a message
[31:29] to restaurants back to where we can have
[31:32] Fellowship
[31:34] with God
[31:36] amen
[31:38] yeah so not waste time because I know
[31:41] today is a Wednesday and
[31:44] may not really take much time
[31:49] would like us to stop
[31:54] amen
[32:07] amen and amen so I believe they have
[32:10] already mentioned my name
[32:13] and uh
[32:15] I'm just wondering
[32:18] some people say they don't know me
[32:21] but I believe we know one another
[32:25] yeah because before the foundation of
[32:27] the world
[32:28] we were all in one place
[32:33] shouting for joy
[32:35] amen but then in this flesh
[32:38] God put us in different places
[32:41] so that we can
[32:43] manifest
[32:46] God in this flesh amen
[32:50] so can we just bow our heads word of
[32:54] Prayer
[32:55] before we read the word of God our
[32:57] Mighty Heavenly Father
[33:00] is a great privilege for us to gather
[33:02] together again
[33:04] just one purpose and that is to
[33:07] Fellowship
[33:09] with you Lord
[33:11] because we know
[33:15] in the beginning there was a word and
[33:17] the Word was with God and the Word was
[33:20] God
[33:21] and when you come to hear this word Lord
[33:23] we know
[33:25] we are fellowshipping with you
[33:27] father may you come and
[33:31] fellowship with us
[33:33] speak to us
[33:34] encourage us
[33:37] build our faith
[33:39] because faith comes by hearing
[33:42] and by hearing by the word of God
[33:44] Lord you know our needs our desires
[33:49] but Lord you are the high priest with
[33:51] Touch by the feelings of our infirmities
[33:54] king of glory
[33:55] may you grant unto each one of us
[33:58] according the richest daughter in Christ
[34:00] Jesus
[34:01] father Lord I'm just a human being
[34:04] but Lord you know the need of your
[34:07] people may you take me out of the way
[34:10] and Lord come and commune with us Lord
[34:14] god king of glory
[34:17] in Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:21] yeah I just
[34:23] want just to have a word of
[34:26] encouragement
[34:27] amen amen and I want us to read from the
[34:31] book of Joshua
[34:35] after one
[34:45] I believe we are there
[34:51] from verse 3.
[34:55] maybe later just start from verse one I
[34:58] hope we are not on so much hurry

[53:48] God is Everlasting
[53:50] Italian
[53:52] it is eternal life by the Eternal of God
[53:56] and anything that at the beginning has
[53:59] an end
[54:02] and everything at the beginning besides
[54:04] God
[54:06] and God is the only form of eternal life
[54:09] there is

[54:44] Hallelujah
[54:46] even the devil didn't know who Jesus was
[54:50] a man he he the only way for him to know
[54:54] who Jesus was was to try him
[54:58] a man to know whether I can do what God
[55:02] can do
[55:03] that's what he said if you are a son of
[55:06] God turn the Stones become bread
[55:10] huh why because it is only God who can
[55:15] turn stones to breath
[55:18] Hallelujah if you be a Son of God turn
[55:21] the Stones become red
[55:23] now Jesus could have done it because he
[55:27] was God
[55:28] [Music]
[55:29] but because it was a devil telling him
[55:33] hallelujah
[55:36] hallelujah hallelujah

[56:38] praise God
[56:40] he comes to know are you the son of God

[1:23:22] character of the father or of the blood
[1:23:25] of the father in the son
[1:23:29] amen
[1:23:32] of the blood of the father in the son is
[1:23:35] a revelation
[1:23:37] amen that's why by by Revelation Abel
[1:23:42] went and got the lamb
[1:23:45] because it was in the character of the
[1:23:48] father to slay lamps
[1:23:51] and the Bible says God had slain the
[1:23:54] lamp before they formation the one
[1:23:57] Hallelujah and they are Abel just came
[1:24:01] to manifest
[1:24:02] the character of the father
[1:24:05] is that right
[1:24:07] is that right
[1:24:09] that's a revelation
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:13] amen
[1:24:15] oh Hallelujah you will act like your

[1:24:21] because the blood of your father is in
[1:24:24] you

[1:24:27] amen I was talking to brother Ben I
[1:24:31] think at the same thing like God loving
[1:24:34] uh

[1:24:38] Pro the Angel Michael
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:43] Lucifer
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:47] then
[1:24:49] he loved Abel
[1:24:52] instead of K
[1:24:54] is that right
[1:24:56] and when Abram comes He blesses
[1:25:00] Isaac instead of
[1:25:03] the firstborn
[1:25:05] who is that one
[1:25:07] Ishmael
[1:25:09] is that right
[1:25:11] and then when our Isaac
[1:25:15] was going to bless instead of blessing
[1:25:18] He blesses Jacob
[1:25:21] amen and and when Joseph was bringing
[1:25:26] the children to to Jacob to bless amen
[1:25:31] he closes the hands
[1:25:34] Hallelujah and that's what exactly what
[1:25:37] Jesus Christ did on the cross
[1:25:39] Hallelujah instead of blessing the Jews
[1:25:42] He blesses at the Gentiles
[1:25:44] the character of their father
[1:25:47] Hallelujah
[1:25:49] amen do you think that Abraham told
[1:25:54] Isaac that when you go together you tell
[1:25:57] him that he this one is your sister no
[1:26:01] Hallelujah but the Bible says when Isaac
[1:26:05] also went to get on he told them this is
[1:26:09] my sister exactly the character of the
[1:26:12] father
[1:26:13] exactly
[1:26:14] Hallelujah so if God is your father
[1:26:18] and the blood of your father is in you
[1:26:22] Hallelujah you will act like your father
[1:26:24] you will talk like your father you will
[1:26:27] be held like your father and if God is
[1:26:30] our father oh Hallelujah
[1:26:33] amen
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:37] you see Jesus told me the Pharisees
[1:26:42] because the Pharisees thought that God
[1:26:45] was their father
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:48] and Jesus told him if God was there your
[1:26:51] father you do
[1:26:55] you will believe this word
[1:26:57] amen because God is the one
[1:26:59] amen you will have the same character
[1:27:02] but you are of your father and he said
[1:27:06] even his works you do he was he was a
[1:27:10] non-deliver he was at the downtown he
[1:27:13] was a murderer from the beginning
[1:27:16] so they have the character of their
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:22] so we have the character of Allah
[1:27:24] we talk like our
[1:27:27] s we behave like our
[1:27:29] we heal like our
[1:27:31] we clear like our
[1:27:33] praise God
[1:27:35] Hallelujah
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:40] amen
[1:27:42] amen amen but we can only do that when
[1:27:47] we have completely separated
[1:27:51] that's where the problem is
[1:27:54] amen amen
[1:27:57] God wants total separation
[1:28:01] from unbelief from the things of the
[1:28:03] world
[1:28:04] Hallelujah be separated from them then
[1:28:07] God can speak through you
[1:28:10] God can create through you God can do
[1:28:14] everything through you amen

[1:28:20] finish now
[1:28:21] just let me just read some few chords
[1:28:24] a man in a message total of separation
[1:28:29] see that's why we with we try to do this
[1:28:33] understand the other but there is
[1:28:35] something that is hindering

[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:56] amen amen let me guess we do this
[1:29:00] few chords and they
[1:29:07] and the prophet says here
[1:29:15] oh my
[1:29:19] is my time going up
[1:29:22] can I have some more 10 minutes
[1:29:25] all right
[1:29:26] okay
[1:29:28] God's word calls for inspiration
[1:29:32] the prophet says in paragraph
[1:29:38] 20
[1:29:43] paragraph 20 the prophet says here
[1:29:47] Jesus has constantly told us that there
[1:29:50] is a separation
[1:29:52] and we find that the last thing that's
[1:29:54] predicted to the human race before the
[1:29:56] great final day when we Ascend into the
[1:29:58] praise of God there will be a final
[1:30:00] separation he will separate the ship
[1:30:03] from the gods
[1:30:04] amen and God will continually has been
[1:30:08] separating separating and that's
[1:30:11] that's what he's doing tonight
[1:30:14] that's what he always does
[1:30:17] you can see it every meeting he
[1:30:20] separates Faith from unbelief
[1:30:23] amen he speaks out he declares himself
[1:30:27] for those who believe
[1:30:30] Amen to those who
[1:30:34] him and have faith in him
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] amen

[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:47] be able
[1:30:49] to speak that mountain
[1:30:51] Hallelujah we must completely separate
[1:30:56] amen and that's why you see when God had
[1:31:01] told Abraham
[1:31:02] amen oh I've given you the love I've
[1:31:06] given you everything I've given you
[1:31:08] every promise amen
[1:31:11] but Lord was with him
[1:31:13] he's the father was with him
[1:31:16] and uh and I I think other people were
[1:31:18] with him and the Bible says there was
[1:31:21] always
[1:31:23] amen
[1:31:24] until Abraham could not achieve
[1:31:28] what he wanted
[1:31:31] and the Bible says
[1:31:35] when Abraham
[1:31:38] after separating from Lord
[1:31:41] is when God comes down
[1:31:44] and God no tell Abraham now you separate
[1:31:47] from Lord yourself no he just keeps
[1:31:49] quiet
[1:31:52] after Abraham
[1:31:55] separating from Lord
[1:31:57] can we read the scripture beat
[1:32:01] Genesis chapter 13.
[1:32:05] Genesis chapter 13 let us read it
[1:32:18] 13.
[1:32:21] in verse 14.
[1:32:28] maybe start from verse 13 but the men of
[1:32:31] sort of were Wicked and he's seen us
[1:32:33] before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord
[1:32:36] said Anthony Brown
[1:32:38] after that Lord was separated from him
[1:32:41] Hallelujah

[1:33:01] I give it unto thy seed after thee
[1:33:04] and I'll make thy sin as the dust of the
[1:33:08] earth so that if a man can nominee
[1:33:11] that's all the Earth then shall thy seed
[1:33:13] also be
[1:33:15] alive
[1:33:16] walk through the land
[1:33:19] in the length of it and in the breath of
[1:33:21] it for I will give it unto thee praise

[1:33:58] every promise is mine
[1:34:01] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] Hallelujah so many of us
[1:34:06] have not fully received our Redemptive
[1:34:10] blessings
[1:34:12] I repeat
[1:34:13] many of us have not fully received our
[1:34:18] redempted blessings for lack of total
[1:34:21] separation
[1:34:23] from the world
[1:34:26] and from unbelief
[1:34:29] amen
[1:34:30] amen
[1:34:32] because we need to separate
[1:34:36] total separation
[1:34:39] that's what God is demanding
[1:34:42] are we together
[1:34:44] all together so if there's been
[1:34:46] something that you have been praying for
[1:34:48] claiming and you don't receive it look
[1:34:51] back
[1:34:53] and see

[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:03] paragraph 27 says
[1:36:09] paragraph 27 the prophet says here
[1:36:20] I believe that tonight
[1:36:23] that every man and woman every boy and
[1:36:25] God that's born of the spirit of God is
[1:36:27] another right hand to the Lord
[1:36:30] because they have separated from the
[1:36:32] things
[1:36:33] themselves from the cancer of the world
[1:36:35] and whatever the world has got to say
[1:36:39] amen
[1:36:41] is that right
[1:36:43] you become another right separated
[1:36:48] for the cause
[1:36:51] of the of the word

[1:36:59] was separated person from the world when
[1:37:01] God collaborate at 75 years old separate
[1:37:04] yourself from your Kindred and from all
[1:37:07] of the unbelief and come unto and a
[1:37:10] world that you have never worked in
[1:37:12] before amongst the people that you have
[1:37:14] never known before come out and separate
[1:37:17] yourself from anybody that would be
[1:37:20] contrary to what you are believing
[1:37:23] that you will be another right and the
[1:37:26] Lord because he was holding a promise
[1:37:30] amen Abram was holding a promise of a
[1:37:33] son
[1:37:35] and for him to receive that son he had
[1:37:38] to separate himself
[1:37:40] praise God
[1:37:42] he had to separate from his father
[1:37:44] he's a mother from all his children and
[1:37:48] what separated him not because that he
[1:37:50] was a good man but because he believed
[1:37:54] that God was able to keep the promise he
[1:37:58] had given him
[1:37:59] praise God
[1:38:02] praise God
[1:38:04] Hallelujah and then the message from
[1:38:08] that time

[1:38:37] paragraph 68
[1:38:46] paragraph 58 rather not 68 58.
[1:38:55] amen and amen
[1:39:04] Abram was changed and look when a man
[1:39:07] meets God God called Abraham and he told
[1:39:09] him he wanted him to separate himself
[1:39:12] from all of his unbelieving Kindred and
[1:39:16] when God calls a man to work for him he
[1:39:19] calls you from Total Annihilation from
[1:39:21] all the things of the world and the sins
[1:39:23] of the Earth separation
[1:39:26] God never did bless Abraham

[1:39:37] always a hair in the soup excuse that
[1:39:39] expression but he was always wrong
[1:39:42] and Abraham and then he got Lord and
[1:39:45] then he finally went down there and
