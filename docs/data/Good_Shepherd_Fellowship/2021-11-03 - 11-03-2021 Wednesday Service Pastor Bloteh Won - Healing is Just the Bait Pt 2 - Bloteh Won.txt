prayer meeting just before we get into the word i will reverse it this time we will read the word and then we will share it a little bit of what we want to share it and then we will take a time to pray praise the lord amen in most places that i know of the dude the preaching before the prayer meeting i love to do the prayer meeting before preaching but we would just we would just change it a little bit so let's just stand on our feet and and then we will be able to share with you what uh praise the lord let's go uh over to see matthew uh let's go to see matthew that's what jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and the gifts of hell shall not prevent against it that's matthew chapter 16. it's a very familiar uh familiar scripture for us familiar chapter familiar verse in the bible so uh uh let's read from verse 13 just for a scripture reading tonight when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippa he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou are john the baptist some elias and uh and others jeremiah and one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and some of peter answered and said thou are the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i said also unto thee that thou i peeded and upon this rock i will build my church and the gifts of hell shall not prevail against it praise the lord we believe that the gif gifts of hell will not prevent against it because god says so amen let's bow our hearts together let's just pray and that the law would just add blessing upon this word uh for us tonight we know the word is already inspired the word is blessed but we need a portion for us tonight that law as we uh uh following the service from different parts of our home tonight we just want to ask god's special blessing that he would just anoint the world and he will speak to our hearts he will be able to draw us close to him tonight let's pray together in jesus name heavenly father we just want to thank you lord god for your word almighty god precious lord we come together tonight father lord god and oh god we want to apply the talking of your word father we want to find a place tonight where we can be able to approach you by faith so dear lord we just ask your blessings come open the word speak to us tonight our father lord god is it's a kind of a different kind of a service than we are used to but we pray that lord grace will just be sufficient for us tonight thank you father lord thank you for your blessing we want to thank you for the shout of the king that is in the camp we want to thank you father for that bracing serpent that we can look to oh god tonight and believe that father god lord jesus we will be healed of all of our second bite lord whether it is sin sickness lord god or the sickness in the body father lord sickness in our mind oh god is just only a look father god we pray oh god just ask your word declare tonight the gifts of hell will not prevail against your church bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you amen amen you may have your seat so this is just pretty much uh a little kind of a bible studies tonight but remember we were we we started to speak on uh a subject we uh entitled uh divine healing is only a bit so we will go back to that note that's where we uh uh we'll be referring much back to uh what we spoke on a little bit i realized that i promised i was going to finish early on sunday and i went late still never get right yet and i went late but yet i did not finish everything that i wanted to talk about but i will approach the subject a little bit different and we will we will go over some few things that we shared on on sunday and the thought the drive the inspiration behind this thought is is all about growth it's all about maturity the way we are understanding things the way we are dealing with things especially in the time that we are living in net net as kovac time the time that we are living in for the bride is rapturing time amen so especially in this time that we are living in uh the way we deal with things you know is very very important it speaks of our growth it speaks of our growth i would first want to start and uh uh by picking up this now you have to realize that we read a lot of scriptures uh uh on sunday and we read from sin john chapter six verse 44 45 and we know jesus says all that the father has given me will come and we also learn from the scripture that he promised to draw us by teaching teaching is the way that he draws us he gets our attention and he draws slowly by teaching but before then we read from the prophet isaiah where he talks about you know all of god's children will be taught by him the isaiah 54 isaiah 28 he also talks about uh what peter referred to as uh babies that are stayed on the sincere milk of the word but there is a place here i think it's in hebrew chapter five we read that let's let's go back there is in hebrew chapter 5 i believe so hebrew chapter 5 verse 12. for for when for the time ye are to be teachers you have need that won't teach you again which be the first principle of the oracle of god we underline their teaching is the first principle of the oracle of god and i become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat i want to take milk and strong meat tonight to show that the four living creatures that was represented before the throne the the lion the ox the man and the ego at their birth there is three of those living creatures at their birth naturally that feeds on milk that's right right the lion feeds on milk the ox feeds on milk when a man born he also feeds on milk from his mama but there is one which is the ego now you have to grab what we are we are dealing with here we we are rapturing people we are people that are reeling the science of the time we are not taking kovic like the world is taking covey we are not taking the uh the economy crisis like the world is taking the economic crisis we are not taking our church situation like the world is taking it we are people that are preparing for a rapture so we realize here that uh as newborn babies like peter said in second peter first peter chapter 2 verse 2 he says as newborn babies we desire the sincere milk of the word praise the lord so we are fed on milk in our birth now you have to understand this now but our age that we are living in required that we be fed or meet because we are in the eagle age praise the lord in our own natural work our own natural walk with the lord we have to start from the sincere milk but the age that we are living in demand that everyone that are born of god in this age now that would bring to understanding the new birth [Music] praise the lord that would bring to understanding the new birth let me let me just take a little uh a level on that for us to understand that praise the lord jesus said uh let's let's go to saint john we will come back yet again i'm staying in hebrew let's go to sin john i i like this kind of services praise the lord these are my kind of services the other services is for the preachers this one is mine praise the lord let's go to sin john chapter 1. are we together praise the lord i can feel your amen coming from home so that's good i can feel your amen coming from home it's in john chapter one now in john chapter one here jesus jesus address he addressed the new birth he addressed uh uh the birth of god's children verse 12 he says for as many as receive him to them have have uh to them give him power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which will which were born not of blood none of the weight of the flesh none of the way of man but of god praise the lord amen and uh uh let's uh take also first peter chapter 1. now what where i want to grab our attention here is that but as many as receive him to them give he power to become sons of god now brother branham over and over he make us to realize that [Music] that speaks of our sonship okay it speaks of our sonship the power that is giving for you to become a son of god is the quickening power praise the lord that power is the quickening power that power is not from the church confession i receive jesus as my lord and savior no that power is the quickening power they are quicking you to see the jesus of your day sure praise the lord now that's the reason why i say our age demands that from birth we must eat meat because these these are the meat of the word are we together now let's take first john first peter 1 23 you are giving power to become sons of god that's the quickening power that that they're quicking you in in your age and your day let me go back to this let me go back let's go back to to saint john let's go back to st john chapter one and let's take the beginning of the story here in context jesus said in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god amen then the next thing that came up in the conversation there was a man sent from god and that man was to bear witness of the light praise the lord so we have the word here which is the logos and we have the light praise the lord now he was not the light but he was sent to bear witness of the light that was the true light which lighted every man praise the lord so you see this this have they have more to do well because what i'm coming to here is i'm coming to an area of the new birth for us to be able to see this area here it has more to do with the light just like john in first john says if we walk in the light as he is in the light yes so it's the same it's a continuation of the same thought and what is the light the light is the move of god identifying the move of god in your day and there is no way you can identify until god quicken you until god quicken you to say oh yeah this is the light i see the light now so first peter 123 says yeah being born again met of corruptable which of course jesus identified yet not blessed not blood not flesh amen peter says being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth in a bath forever praise the lord now so that is the reason why uh our age jesus says to them much was giving much is required praise the lord if we are the believing people that believe that we will partake of not tasting death but we change in the moment of a twinkling of an eye we have to step up to that calling we have to step up to that calling just a church membership is not enough for that because it's the same age that is promised the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and we we throw it into opening the blind eyes and raising the dead when it is just requiring us to be a son of god and a daughter of god in our choices and our decision the way we deal with things praise the lord now you have to remember is the little foxes that's paul divine the little things the way we deal with it is it all about ourselves or is it about the father we have to watch that because jesus the bridegroom in his last hour it was all about the father not my will but your will be done so with this bride last hour be all about pleasing god and not ourself are we together now so you see that is the place where the whole subject around the new birth gets a little bit uh uh it gets a little bit confusing because many of us experienced god before we came to the message but what the call year is what god quickened to us what the quickening power does was to to be able to quicken that seed that you can identify the message of your day that you can identify the move of god praise the lord amen and just like uh you know i'm i'm this guy that is always growing in cycle so praise the lord so what what was i talking about here back in hebrew chapter 5 was talking about the birth of all of these four living creatures praise the lord each one of them at their birth the lion suck milk the the man the ox the same but then when it comes over to the ego right from birth right from birth you are being fed the mysteries of god right from birth the serpent see the godhead [Music] praise the lord because that is the thing our age required yes sure praise the lord to get ready for the bride i mean to get ready for the rapture yes we must feed on these things right from mama eagle's mouth into our mouth it's a fresh kill every service is a fresh kill amen are we together so you see god interest is not it's it's not having the mean god amiga church and having more church members god's interest is bringing sons and daughters to maturity praise the lord it's not to count how many members we are it's it's how much are we standing for what has been given to us in our day because honor the honor the lions anointing this tool for what was given to them the great evangelism went around the world honor the ox anointing the stool for what was given to them even to the burning of the stake honor the men's anointing they did the same the stool we we talked at the last time yet about uh uh william trader how he was burned for for writing all of that was honor the man's anointing when the printing press was open luther's and all of that this tool for what was given to them and what has been given to us in this age to get ready for the rapture is the opening of the seals is the mystery of god yes sir praise the lord that's what has been given to us in this age now there are some few things i would drag you into but let's read uh hebrew chapter 5 here a little bit i was sucking on the canyon and it's like now it's sucking on my throat so we see the first principle of the oracle of god is teaching and i become such as one needing milk and that strong meat for everyone that use it milk is on scale in the word of righteousness for he is a baby how long will we stay being babies but strong meat belonged to them that are of full age maturity praise the lord strong meat strong meat not not not only in the form of mystery but strong meat at a place where god could choose to deal with you strumming strong affliction strong rejection what's going to be your attitude strong meat is not only in the sense of mystery press lord and then and with with all of these uh uh uh uh uh strong comments people are making about the message about the messenger what is our attitude yes praise the lord strong meat belonged to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil praise the lord yes now one thing that we have to realize there is that uh uh all of these living creatures just like the believer need to be fed to grow we need to be we need to constantly feed to go to grow so when people come to the place where they think that they already knows about this subject they already hear this they are already baptized in jesus name and you don't look for an area in your life of growth praise the lord let me let me approach this another way we just read matthew chapter 16 a scripture that we love praise the lord a scripture that we love and jesus says upon this rock i will build my church and the gifts of hell will not prevail against it now we all know that that rock is the revelation of jesus christ amen let's take deuteronomy chapter 27 verse five i'll read some few things to you here from brother branham and uh uh but let's let's let's just let's just tell you i love these bible studies i love when the bible preached the message of the prophet [Laughter] praise the lord i love when the bible preached the message of the prophet matthew chapter 27 verse five did i say matthew yes no it's as i supposed to say deuteronomy chapter 27 verse five now verse 4 says therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that yeah set up these stones moses giving them an instruction here my attention is on verse five verse five and there shall thou build an altar unto the lord thy god an altar of stones thou shall not lift up any iron tool upon them thou shalt build an altar of the law thy god of whole stones praise the lord amen now we we we taking the old testament principle we we want to apply tonight jesus said upon this rock i will build my church and we realize that that rock is the rock of revelation praise the lord and our year is moses instructing the people here when you go over jordan you're going to take this you know the stone you're going to build an altar unto the lord but he's also telling them that they should not lift up an iron don't ship the rock don't ship the rock because we are living in a dead in age where people want to shift the revelation of jesus to fit their lifestyle no leave the revelation as a whole stone don't shape it the revelation is a whole stone it's given by god don't don't put don't put an iron on it don't put no denominational or science idea or a modern church idea to kind of shape that to your lifestyle right leave it as a whole stone yes are we together praise the lord now you will see also when solomon built his temple first king chapter 6 verse 7. the bible says there was not heard ahamam the stones were brought and they were rightly fed into the building there was no hitting of stones now you watch this now as we travel because brother branham there with this in anti-evangelizing he talks a lot on that shipping of stones but it's a bible study tonight prayer meeting with father later first peter chapter 2. first peter chapter 2. praise the lord we have all of these people that has their independent revelation it has their independent revelation praise the lord that the thing god has has revealed to them you know and and and that revelation is just for them first peter chapter two let's take verse five first peter chapter 2 and let's take verse 5. there's a reason why i decide to approach the service like this tonight let's go from uh verse one let's go from verse one wherefore laying aside all malice and all god and hypocrisy and envy and all evil speaking can you imagine a people preparing for the rapture will have this kind of attitude among themselves as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby so in one sense paul is saying you can only get away or peter is saying you can only get away from those things in your life if you are seeing them showing up that you still have a an attitude of evil speaking of people a kind of envious spirit and and plain hypocrisy man pleaser and all of that he's saying that it's a sign that you are a baby praise the lord amen you are a baby and you and you and you should be you should desire the sincere milk stop feeding on the word right stop feeding on the word start reading your bible chapter after chapter and then you will start growing and and and it's that growth in the world that will bring you above those things now that's not what i'm getting to but let's follow me he says if so be ye have tested that the lord is gracious to whom calling your calling as unto a living stone praise the lord this allowed indeed of of man by choosing of god and precious here also as lifeless stone i built up a spiritual house now take watch this now that is going to happen here when it comes to jesus says i will build my church which of course that comprises of the universal body of the bride the universal body of believers around the world the mystical body let me say that amen is built on the revelation of the word and that is what we must not ship but you as a lifeless stone need to be shaped amen praise the lord you don't you don't shape the revelation to fit you but god and now watch this now because if you apply it to solomon temple those stones that you you did not heard herman or saul used at the temple because the stone was held out they were shaped somewhere else yes sir before they were brought to be added to the temple god had the man to shape the stones and cut them different places but then when they were brought to the tabernacle every one of them fit right in because it was caught under god's supervision and that's what happened when god allowed things in our life for our growth he's shaping us so we can come together as lifeless stone to be able to fade into the into his body it is with our growth our maturity and yet also as lifeless tone i build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices accepted by god accepted to god by jesus christ praise the lord amen so we see here that the way that god brings us to maturity the way he draws us to himself is by teaching us and we know that is the only reason why he allowed things in our life i want to read this to you brother branham say here it is i be not afraid uh that was in our our quotes from uh sunday so he said therefore all of us are born by sexual desire and blood in us or sinful blood through a perverted way of bringing children to the earth god just spoke adam came forth so the woman was not in the original creation she's uh uh a bad product of the man he's taking or she's taken from his side a rape or he taken from his side god taken from his side a rape adam a spirit was both male and female both feminist and masculine in the spirit and god separated the masculine from the feminist and put the finish in a woman in the masculine in a man see what i'm going with this and see both body and spirit they are one that's the reason when sarah loved other angel said she couldn't be like that god would have slayed that woman right there but he couldn't hurt her because she's part of abraham right he they heard abraham if he took sarah and that's the reason our sins today will be everyone condemned but god can't take us because if he does he hurt christ we are part of him we are the bride don't you see it so there it is so grace hold us in our mistake until we can see better praise the lord grace hold us in our mistakes praise the lord that's why brother branham said in in in the sea of the question and answer series he said we we backslide before one another he said but we never backslide before god right praise the lord amen and that's the reason why in our growth he also taught us that brotherly kindness will bring us to the place where we will learn to bear with one another not quickly speaking against one another and condemning people and evil speaking them out so grace hold us in our mistakes until we can see better why because is the father that is dealing with us praise the lord i have another place here where we will talk about begotten and born but not tonight and i just want to hold us in this place praise the lord hold us in this place so grace hold us in our mistakes until we can see better because after all is the father that is dealing with us god's coveting with abraham god doesn't make any difference between his children every son that cometh to god must first be tried all casting you get it first be tried chesting corrected child trained school everyone everyone not one exception every son but we must also understand that he don't deal with us all the same way praise the lord he don't deal with us all the same way he will not deal with you and your children the same he will not deal with you and your wife the same you are all peculiar stones to god he got to take his time to shape you praise the lord and you see the wonderful thing there is that he's not shipping you where the building is being built that's right he's shipping you out in your working places at the grocery stores with your neighbors with your family members that's what he's shipping you praise the lord he's not shipping you where the building is being built we come to the service the word is preach whether it's an evangelist calling our sin or rebuking something we receive that word and then when we go out when we have to deal with our children or deal with our loved one or deal with a brother or sister or thee with a complete unbeliever what is our attitude how do you use the word the material that is given to you through the fightful ministry that's the thing that god is watching praise the lord he says now one exception not one exception god trusting he correct he child trained he schooled every one now one exception every son have you went through trials have you went through tribulation have you suffered persecution then you endured those things you are real children of god but when you can bear testimony when the road comes down heavy and you run off and back into the word the bible says you are illegitimate children and met the children of god now you see this thing is not it's not me bringing the word to attack you to wash your attitude no the one that is watching our attitude is the father he's watching an attitude of how am i preaching the word am i am i being personal to attack somebody now he's watching your attitude too of how you are receiving the word are you sitting down there and thinking well he's talking to me praise the lord because he is the one that is dealing with us like we have said over and over god is our audience yes amen you are now my audience we are on his stage whether we are in church or out of church you have to realize there is an unseen eye that is watching you but when you cannot bear attached to me when the roll comes down have it whether it comes by sickness it does not only count by the preaching of the word sometimes it comes by disappointment you are disappointed in this person he didn't even believe they would do that what are you going to do back up into the world then you are not a son that you are not a son that's the difference between a son and an illegitimate a son and a bastard praise the lord god try his sons he he proved us to build character in us god don't train the devil's children but he trained his sons praise the lord amen judah was a son of perdition jesus knowing all that he was doing never one time publicly rebuked him but he was right there on simon peter every time for when a man is born of the spirit of god he expect those things and he loved those things when a man is born of the spirit of god it all comes to our growth when the word of the hour has quickened you you expect those things you love it you know when you see it happening you love it you you're right right right there you identify that the father is addressing something in your life something hit me a couple of services ago and i wrote this down where the frustration is that people turn to look at what jesus says the two greatest commandments love the lord with all your heart and all your strength and all your mind you read many people testimony and you realize that they get frustrated and even we ourself we get frustrated sometimes because we are trying to prove to god lord you know i love you but it hits me like this you know like we always say it's because he first loved us his love has affected our life that we can love him back praise the lord yes amen and like we always said is that the difference between god loved the whole world that's why his word says but god so loved the word the difference in the love is that there is one group that accept his love and the other don't accept his love they have not come to that place to embrace the love of god let me share this with you learn to embrace god's love then to struggle to love him yeah praise the lord amen because jesus said he that loves me will keep my commandment so many times we try to prove that we love him by trying to do things that is in the word nor we must embrace his love when we are doing those things not do those things to prove your love to god because as a phoenix being you will always come short praise the lord let me let me turn it over to the marriage coveting the love comes from the man and the woman must embrace the love praise the lord husband love your wife that's what the scripture says amen and she must embrace that love by by learning to appreciate the different things that he's doing because what happened there is that that love is put in the context of colors and shape when when the house is painted our best color oh he loved me he just gave me the color that i need all that you know that the card is bought oh he jesse gave me a gift it's just it's all in colors and shape that's the way we read it and even as children of god we bring the same thing to god we look at we look at ethnic things you know our health we look at money we look at different things and no we must embrace his love yes because whatever he give us he give it to us from a loving heart and we must learn to embrace it thank you jesus that's the reason why when we learn to give thanks in all things it pleases the father thank you jesus you are embracing the father's love instead of struggling to keep his commandment to love him let's embrace his love and in embracing his love you will be keeping his commanding because that is exactly what he commands of us praise the lord amen it's it's easy it's easy to embrace his love yes it becomes easy if we just if we just love the one that god has given us just learn to love them because he loved us while we were yet sinners amen and he loved us while he's shipping us he loves us he loves us that's the reason why he loves us that's the reason why he's doing everything that he's doing he's giving everything that he's given to us yes it's coming from a loving heart of a loving god amen that god will choose you to become partakers of his suffering and he will call you into death by giving you a trial just embrace it thank you jesus i love you and in that way we will be fulfilling his commandment because we put this we put this thing uh i did this i did this you know i i left i left my old lifestyle i left this i left you just you just counting all that you have done to love god praise the lord you have to know that he's an internal being he don't have a beginning he don't have an end so just keep counting keep counting it's easy when we just embrace what he gives to us and say thank you jesus i love you i love you in these few broken words tonight let's go to the lord and pray let's go to the lord in prayer now i say all of this because i'm trusting and believing that the law would just ship our mind as a church as we deal with everything that we are dealing with he would just ship our mind he will cut off all the negative and just ship our mind to see that the tenor hand of jehovah is leading us yes the tenor hand of jehovah is guiding us in whatever he allows praise the lord we're not going to shape the stone to fit our lifestyle or fit our opinion fit our idea no he's building his church on the unmovable rock of revelation they're unchanging rock the unchanging god that do not change is building his church on that but yet he's using different things to ship us and i'm trusting i'm believing that we all will come from out of this and we will we we will learn we will grow in understanding praise the lord we will grow in understanding there's a quote brother branham said i will get that quote and read it to you from the pulpit healing is understanding it's understanding the moment you grab the revelation you understand that the price has already been paid yes it's not the feelings that you feel in your body that's right yes in the c.o.v brother says god gives you a vision of a body that is perfectly well and then you walk to go and embrace that body he said that's what he divine healing is you already see it it's a finished work so every day you are taking steps lord gave me great thank you jesus i'm healed i'm healed because you are seeing yourself as a healed person as a perfectly strong person and you are walking everything you are fighting i just i just broke into a testimony the other night was that last night about a man and his wife they just got married newly wedded and she came down with uh a terminal cancer it went so fast that on her dying bed but this this gentleman was now wavering i mean he's too bad heard and the last word he said to her he just held her hands and said if there is any fight in you fight he just said it not loud caught her by her name held her hands and said if there is any fight in you fight because she was having a baby so they had to rush her to the hospital and and they did a c-session and took the child and and he was saying it he says uh our baby would need you if there is any fight in you and just that slow speaking word brought the miracle that blasted the doctor's mind and i just believed it was almighty god yes because it was in no time when she sat up on the hospital bed and she asked that she wanted water to drink and the doctors were all confused now so you see whatever faith he had in needing his wife he got so desperate praise the lord you know i was just thinking about that i'm closing now my bible is closed everything is closed i was just thinking about that the other night while meditating there is nothing like blind faith a fit can give the blind man his side that fate can see a faith can raise the dead back to life their faith is alive if faith can make the to walk then faith can move yes there is nothing like blind faith faith has eyes that look at the promise of god amen let's buy our house together tonight jesus is my savior i shall not be moved [Music] in his love and favor i shall not oh just like a tree thus planted by the wall auto yes i shall not be moved yes if i trust him ever i shall not be he will fill me he will fill me never i should not oh just like a tree yes that's planted by the water yes i [Music] i shall not be [Music] [Music] [Music] glory hallelujah glory [Music] just like a tree that's planted by the water i shall not be [Applause] be i shall not be more just like a tree that's planted by the water [Music] [Music] we are all work in progress and we know that he's working on us yes yes there is no reason to be stubborn there is no reason to hold to an idea when it's not bringing forth fruit there is no reason to hold to our opinion to hold to a stand when it's not bringing full fruit the fruit that we look for is to glorify the father it's not a growth if we are not glory and fire in the father we are just showing that this is our way of life and this is the way we believe it and this is the way we think that it's supposed to be i don't care who says what the
