[Music] jesus was the express image of god he was god expressing himself in man to man but there is something else to note in these verses especially verses 1 and 2. god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son i want you to notice here in the margin of your bible you will see a correction the word by is not a correct translation it should be in not by it then reads correctly god spake in times past unto the fathers in the prophets by means of the word first samuel 3 21 be for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly the spirit and the word are one jesus revealed the father the word revealed the father jesus was the living word praise god today he is still that living word when jesus was upon the earth he said believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works john 14 10. here it is most evidently set forth that the perfect manifestation of god in the sun was by the indwelling spirit manifesting in word and works that is exactly what we have been teaching all along when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced the word is god the spirit is god they are all one one cannot work apart from the other if one truly has the spirit of god he will have the word of god that is how it was with the prophets they had the indwelling spirit of god and the word came to them that is how it was with jesus in him was the spirit without measure and the word came to him jesus both began to do and teach my doctrine is not my own but the fathers that sent me acts 1 1 john 7 16 remember now john the baptist was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in jordan the word of god jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the holy ghost that is what jesus said would be the evidence he said and i will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive now we know what truth is thy word is truth john 17 17 be again in john 8 43 why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did you notice that jesus said that the world could not receive the holy ghost well in this verse i just read neither could they receive the word why because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the holy spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it in john 14 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of god again in john 16 13 albeit when he the spirit of truth word is come he will guide you into all truth thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear word of god that shall he speak word and he will show you things to come spirit bringing the word of prophecy i want you to know very carefully that jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of god for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word in first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things i write unto you are the commandments of the lord now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what god's prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order paul had to say to those who claimed another revelation verse 36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only the evidence of a spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth word but to receive the truth word and to believe and obey it have you noticed in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every church age we hear these words he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true christians took the word for their age did you get that last thought i repeat every church age ends with the same admonition he that hath an ear let him an individual hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they have the seed in them john 8 47 and he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god they refuse the word jesus and his words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of god and all thy children shall be taught of god holy spirit isaiah 54 13 jesus said the same thing in john 6 45 being one with the word proves whether you are of god and spirit filled no other criterion but what are tongues and interpretation and the other gifts they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then paul names those manifestations now comes this very good question i know that you are all anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation and evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost because you surely could not manifest the holy ghost unless you truly were spirit filled now i wish i could say that is right because i don't like to hurt people or walk on their doctrine but i wouldn't be a true servant of god if i didn't tell you the whole council of god that is right is it not just let us take a little look at balaam he was religious he worshipped god he understood the proper method of sacrificing and approaching unto god but he was not a true seed prophet for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of god into sins of fornication and idolatry yet who would dare to deny that the spirit of god manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but he never had the holy ghost now then what do you think of caiaphas the high priest the bible says that he prophesied the kind of death the lord should die we all know there is no record of him being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man like dear old simeon or that sweet saint called anna yet he had a genuine manifestation of the holy ghost we can't deny that so where is manifestation as an evidence it isn't there if you are truly filled with the spirit of god you will have the evidence of the word in your life let's show you how deeply i feel and understand this truth by a revelation god gave me now before i tell it i want to say this many of you people believe me to be a prophet i don't say that i am you said it but we both know that the visions god gives me never fail not once if anyone can prove a vision ever failed i want to know about it now that you follow me this far here is my story many years ago when i first came across the pentecostal people i was in one of their camp meetings where there was much manifestation of tongues interpretation of tongues and prophecy two preachers in particular were engaged in this kind of speaking more than any of the other brethren i thoroughly enjoyed the services and was truly interested in the various manifestations for they had a ring of reality to them it was my earnest desire to learn all that i could about these gifts so i decided to talk to the two men about them through the gift of god resident in me i sought to know the spirit in the first man whether he was truly of god or not after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother i knew that he was a genuine solid christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one he was boastful and proud and as i spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and i saw that he was married to a blonde lady but was living with a brunette and had two children by her if ever there was a hypocrite he was one now let me tell you i was shocked how could i not be here were two men one of which was a real believer and the other was a sinful impersonator yet both were manifesting gifts of the spirit i was troubled by this confusion i left the meeting to seek god for the answer i went alone to a secret place and there with my bible i prayed and waited on god for the answer not knowing just what portion of scripture to read i casually opened the bible to some place in matthew i read for a while and then laid the bible down in a moment a wind blew into the room and turned the pages of the bible to hebrews chapter 6. i read it through and was particularly impressed by those strange verses hebrews 6 4-9 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak i closed the bible laid it down and meditated a while and prayed some more i still had no answer i again opened the bible aimlessly but did not read suddenly the wind blew into the room again and once more the pages turned to hebrews 6 and remained there as the wind ceased i read those words over again and when i did then came the spirit of god into the room and i beheld a vision i saw in the vision a man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a freshly plowed field and sowed grain it was a bright day and the sowing was done in the morning but late at night after the sower and white had gone a man in black came and stealthily sowed some more seed amongst that which the man in white had sown the days went by the sun and rain blessed the ground and one day there appeared the grain how fine it was but a day later appeared the tears the wheat and tears grew together they partook of the same nourishment out of the same soil they drank in the same sun and rain then one day the skies turned to brass and the plants all began to droop and to die i heard the wheat lift their heads and cry to god for rain the tears also lifted up their voices and pleaded for rain then the skies darkened and the rain came and again the wheat now full of strength lifted up their voices and cried in adoration praise the lord and to my wonderment i heard the revived tares also look up and say hallelujah then i knew the truth of the camp meeting and the vision the parable of the sower and the seed the sixth chapter of hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear the sower in white was the lord the sower in black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god for he maketh his son and reign to fall on both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still that one great difference they were of different seed here also was the answer to matthew 7 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the holy ghost can accomplish by way of men but he did deny ever knowing them these weren't backsliders these were wicked unregenerate reprobates these were the seed of satan and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit-born spirit-filled no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow that is bible now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergam age which was as yet 200 years off from the patmos vision he knew that drift would cause them to go into the dark ages he knew that the way man originally got away from god was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you have left god thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in 1st john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word will you can't separate god and the word they are one now then this word he has left behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that his word was life john 6 63 be but that is exactly what he is john 14 6 i am the way the truth and the life romans 8 9 be if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living word in their midst the power of god would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without doubt that the glory of god and the wonderful acts of god will be in her midst again one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasped the pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride here is what i am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and thence into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time now let us stand like joshua and caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now joshua means jehovah's savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as paul came as the original leader caleb represents those that stayed true with joshua remember god had started israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church notice how god did not move israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on joshua their leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it joshua you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from god and know the will of god and act quickly something is wrong with you but joshua was a god sent prophet and he knew the promises of god so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from god and when the time came to move god placed the full leadership in joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word god could trust joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures take the example we see in moses this mighty anointed prophet of god had a peculiar birth being born at the right time for the deliverance of abraham's seed from egypt he never stayed in egypt to argue scripture with them nor fuss at the priests he went to the wilderness until the people were ready to receive him god called moses to the wilderness the waiting was not on moses part but because of the people who were not ready to receive him moses thought the people would understand but they did not then there is elijah to whom the word of the lord came when he got through preaching the truth and that group back there that is the forerunner of the american jezebel group would not receive the word god called him off the field and plagued that generation for rejecting the prophet and the message that god had given god called him to the wilderness and he would not come out even for the king those who tried to persuade him to do so died but god spoke to his faithful prophet by vision out of hiding he came and brought back the word to israel then came john the baptist christ's faithful forerunner the mighty prophet for his day he did not go to his father's school nor the school of the pharisees he went to no denomination but out to the wilderness called there by god there he stayed until the lord sent him out with the message crying the messiah is at hand now let us take a scriptural warning here was it not in the days of moses whom god had vindicated that korah rose up and withstood that mighty prophet he disputed with moses and claimed that he had as much from god to lead the people and that others shared in the divine revelation as well as did moses he denied the authority of moses now the people back there after they had heard the true word and were well acquainted with the fact that a true prophet was vindicated of god i say those people fell for korra and his gain sayings korra was not a scriptural prophet but the people in great numbers with their leaders went for him how like the evangelists today with their golden calf schemes like korras they look good to the people as korah looked good then they have blood on their foreheads oil on their hands and balls of fire on the platform they allow women preachers let women cut their hair wear slacks and shorts and bypass the word of god for their own creeds and dogmas that shows what kind of seed is in them but not all the people turned on moses and left the word of god no the elect stayed with him the same is happening again today many are leaving the word but some are staying with it but remember the parable of the wheat and tares the tares have to be bundled for burning these apostate churches are getting bound closer and closer together ready for the fires of god's judgment but the wheat is going to be gathered to the master now i want you to be very careful here and see this god has promised that at the end time malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit quickened word of god spoken by the prophet malachi jesus referred to it it is just before christ comes the second time by the time jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the gentile dispensation will be in its last church age when that messenger of malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole bible from genesis to revelation he will start at the serpent's seat and carry on to the messenger in the latter reign but he will be rejected by the denominations he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of ahab israel's history under ahab is happening right here in america where the prophet of malachi appears as israel left egypt to worship in freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders like david etcetera and then put an ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same in america our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like washington and lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon and ahab was set in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it is at such a time as this that the messenger of malachi must come then in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown watch this carefully know to see it in the word john was the forerunner of malachi 3. he planted the former reign and was rejected by the organizations of his day jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown the second forerunner of christ will sow for the latter reign jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first showdown was mount carmel the second was the mount transfiguration and the third will be mount zion the strange behavior of moses elijah and john withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the seed had been sown the planting was over judgment was next they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so judgment was next i believe according to revelation 13 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot now remember that moses was born for a certain work but he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work he had to go out in the desert and wait there god had an appointed time there was to be a certain pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before god could send him back this is true for our day but what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of god if they see blood oil and fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even on scriptural ones but god has warned us about that he said in matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits would be so close together that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one as the evil one deceived the first two brides he will try to deceive the bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but god never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit how can any messenger sent from god believe only a part of the word [Music] so [Music] you
