Father good be in the house of the Lord we greet you again in the name of the Lord Jesus let's take our Bibles we just want to share a few things with you tonight and uh the main purpose was just for us to come together tonight and and uh take these knees to the Lord U praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we serve amen you love the Lord tonight amen let's go to the Book of James oh sweet Jesus James chapter 4 I believe so that's what I want to read read tonight James chapter 4 praise the Lord James chapter 4 sorry James chapter 4 is a very familiar verse you want to read tonight let's read I read from verse seven actually verse 8 is uh the verse I wanted to read but let's just take from verse seven submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands yeah Sinners and purify your heart yeah double minded father we want to thank you tonight and we just ask that Lord you bless your word to our hearts now in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh if we just also want to look at uh um Hebrew chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10 Let's uh uh take a few verses there to tonight Hebrews chapter 10 let's read from verse 19 having therefore Brethren's boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he have consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us Draw N with a with a Truth uh with a truth heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkle from an evil conscience and our body watch with pure water amen may the Lord add a blessing to his word praise the Lord I just want to just uh uh bring a few words of encouragement to us tonight and uh uh remind us the service Services again is uh starts on Saturday night and uh brother Jordan his wife fly in on Friday evening and uh so Saturday uh what time do we have down for the meetings 6:30 uh sister anetta what is the time we had the time we had for Saturday night 6 okay 6 p.m. let's be see 6 p.m and and U um praise the Lord now I I was I was kind of meditating on this thought and that's what I want to share with you tonight draw night unto the Lord actually when I was uh meditating on it I entitled it draw me nearer uh um because I was just thinking about uh how sometimes translation can uh can change the effect of uh what was really said amen sometime translation can change the effect of of uh what was really said so tonight uh I'm not I'm not go I'm not interpreting the scripture I just want us to to be able to take the scripture in the context of how we have been taught by the message of the hour and by the opening of the word to be able to just appreciate the word you know we we uh we read this uh you know over and over you know and you hear it uh you know the the God bless the the Evangelist you know most of the time we is used for alter called is used to encourage people draw night onto God and He will draw night onto you praise the Lord and uh uh uh and then you can you can look through the scripture you know uh you will see that uh uh in in in few places is uh is used like that but what what actually caught my mind is is just kind of for thinking on it you can see why I I name it draw me nearer uh because the thing about it there is that Jesus said you know uh no man come unto the father except by me amen and uh so scripturally is is uh it's established that he's the one that draw Us Praise the Lord so the the very desire of us want to draw near to God it is the place where we know that we are feeling the P amen are we together we are feeding the pool our Drawing Near unto the Lord is an effect of he pulling us to him it is not it is not our effort praise the Lord and that is that is the beautiful thing about the Redemption story The more we can take ourself out of the picture and begin to see that it is God that is working through us the more this whole thing can become beautiful praise the Lord that's the reason why his strength can be made perfect in our weakness because if it was just left to us to do the work we don't we don't have that strength we don't have that Grace so so that's what we want to look at tonight I will read some few things uh uh to you tonight uh uh uh just just to you know just to encourage you to come to come behind uh uh what what we share with you on on um on Sunday I was listening to the message behind the curtain of time you know brother B preach it on on uh uh March 5th so I I just listening to that and and there were just few things that came out of there that I thought I would share tonight at this uh prayer meeting now so he goes ahead and he starts here just just watch this it's beautiful I come back to my top he says now do you think that God listen to this now do you think that God who now your faith gets to a spot now do you think that what will you think now if all of the effort that this Tabernacle and this group of people year has put forth for the kingdom of God there's many year uh that uh L is your children for the kingdom of God you use your children resources your family resources there's many year that's gone with our club for the kingdom of God there's many who have rode through storm and walk with no shoes on their feet to get to the Tabernacle year that's right for the kingdom of God listen to this now this this really meant a whole lot to me a minister to me and I hope he would do the same to you could you imagine an artist painting a great picture beautiful till it sub line and then just tear it up praise the Lord could you imagine that there will be something wrong with that artist could you imagine a composer write a song on tell it suine and then just tear his music up are we together amen there will be something wrong with that composer see there's nothing wrong with God God Don't Make a thing like that just to tear it up and throw it away it's for his kingdom it's for his glory each one of us play a part in this picture of that artist amen he is our artist we play a part in the picture praise the Lord each one of us play a part in in this picture and in this song so brother Braham is bringing a a picture to us to understand that uh uh with all of our effort with everything that we do we wake up in the morning we pray for one another you know people come on our heart we pray for them we pray for the service we say Lord bless our little Church Father help us we prayed and you know we make effort to be able to come to church you know uh uh uh we make effort uh uh uh to support the kingdom of God so brother Bram is bringing all of this and says do you think that God will just tear the whole thing praise the Lord you have to remember that uh uh in the church ages he said he's not ungrateful to forget our labor of love praise the Lord every little thing that we are doing for the Lord you have to you have to that's that's what count if you are doing it you know what to make a name that name is going to go off the Earth one of these days amen if you are doing it to make an impression it's going to fail whatever we do for one another or for any more to do it for the Lord as long as you do it for the Lord you will never regret no matter how they treat you you will never regret do it for the Lord Do It for the kingdom are we together if you are coming on time come for the kingdom each one of us played a part in this picture and in this song we are a part of the Kingdom now so you see brother Brandon bring us to the place to realize that God is using our life in everything that we are going through is just like an artist with a pin brush praise the Lord he's the one that is that is that is doing this work he he bring brings every one of us around into this picture we are aligned in the song Praise the Lord you might not even be uh you know uh you know uh a line that that that have wor in it but each one of us we are part of this great music in his message Shalom that's what he was talking about we are part of this great music music that that is going on just a little part praise the Lord just a little part and he says God will net after laboring and laboring and laboring in our life and just take the whole thing and just tear it praise the Lord are we together he say something will be wrong with that artist something will be wrong with that uh uh uh musician he says but God there is nothing wrong with God Amen he knows exactly what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing you know when brother Braham talk about the Masterpiece uh uh he he he he brought uh you know an acknowledgement like that he brought something up where he said uh uh uh you know uh uh a great musician you know you know sitting down and composing uh uh music he says he's writing you know and then he you know uh he uh strouble the sheet and put it in the trash you know and he find another line again he write he say the the the the the ones that he WRA up and put into the into the bin he did not he did not throw the words away he had just had more words so he take another sheet and add words ver to it again and and continue composing and brother bam said when he come up come out with that song he having uh a basket full of paper that he have wbed and throw in the trash he says and those papers are the Masterpiece he said because on each one of those paper they make the notes of this song that he's singing amen praise the Lord and uh uh so he goes on here he said uh each one of us play a part in this picture and in this song and we are a part of the kingdom of God and that is that we can play our part as long as we realize where we are positioning belong in this place and then stay right there in that place in one place to know it's in love because that's what makes up the picture love amen the love of God that's what makes up the picture so when we look at this scripture draw night unto me and you know draw night unto the Lord and and uh and He will draw night unto you uh uh you know the the the tough there is is for us to be able to realize you know now Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me so he has the draw drawing power praise the Lord he has the drawing power you see uh that is the thing that the church went through through the Reformation you know uh uh uh uh this this this this uh this writing of catholism on the church that that make the church to you know to to to work theirself up to be able to appease God and the people had to you know find weip and whips you know to do something for the Lord that that that stigma has left with the church that we always trying and and and you know and and in that way we also we are not seeing and appreciating what God is doing through us because we we kind of for make ourself the one that have to do they I have to pray I have to read I have to be in church and we are not seeing the bigger side of the picture that he is the one praise the Lord he is the one that is drawing us he is the one that is that is creating that that love within our hearts he is the one that is burdening us are we together praise Lord so we want to we we we just we want to keep that picture in our mind you know we want to keep that picture in our mind that he is the one that is drawing us amen no one can come unto me and uh uh uh come unto the father until the father draw them that's what Jesus said no one can come unto the father until the father draw in so there is a supernatural thing that that is going on praise the Lord amen there's a supernatural thing that is going on the Consciousness that it is service time the Consciousness that it is prayer time the Consciousness it's a supernatural thing it's something that is far beyond what our human mind can reason praise the Lord if it is just on our human effort is is going to fail it has to be the Lord are we together it has to be the Lord and that's the picture that we don't want to lust amen that we don't want to lust because even in the in in in in the time where we are weak in the time where we are feeling if that picture is there you will know that uh you know uh uh uh uh no matter what is going on I believe that the Lord will Rescue Me praise the Lord you see the Jews as a as a natural Seed of Abraham with what the Torah taught them that thing is is is you know is is graving within the Jews they know that they are a Seed of Abraham they know that God made a covenant with Abraham and and and and and through that Covenant their father Abraham will be the father of Nations so a Jew can be striking a business and and and you know and and he's he's trying to win this business deal and I mean uh uh uh he's he's even cheating the man on the business but he's doing it with a mindset that I'm a Seed of Abraham praise the Lord he's doing it with a mindset that I'm a Seed of Abraham the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob will bless me praise the Lord is graving in his mind he can he he might not be a religious Jews to keep the Torah and and and he's not praying all the time but is graving in his mind from age 12 he he's he's he's taking over to to the temple or his father in the house set him down he he he's he's he's reading the Torah he's getting acquainted with the promises and the blessings and all of that he might not have a dealing like you and myself have with the Holy Ghost dealing with our heart but naturally is graving within him praise the Lord look at Jacob when he went to Laban amen when he went to Laban I mean it was it it was in him I mean he was he was right there he was he was just believing that I work for this man he have cheated me but God is going to bless me now the god that is going to bless him I mean he will not just laying down there and expecting the windows of Heaven to open no in his mind he was calculating what can I do to get more sheeps than this guy and he was counting that as God's blessing praise the Lord so if the natural Seed of Abraham it can be so graving in his heart that he's a Seed of Abraham and and and and and and uh uh uh you know Abraham is is uh is is his father you know Abraham was the man that God made a covenant with after after the destruction of the world if that thing can be so I mean uh graving in the in the heart of the natural Seed of Abraham how much more about you and myself to know that we have a promise he said I will never leave you I will never forsake you amen I will be with you even onto the end praise the Lord just like I said the church brought this approach to us where we have to work we need to do this we need to do that until we don't see how God is dealing with us it's it's it's more like you know what this is what I'm doing to stop this this is what I'm doing to stop this and and the picture of there's a man in the room there's a man that can turn on the light there's a one year that is changing our life praise the Lord he's the captain of the ship of Zion amen and as long as he's the captain this boat is not going to sink no matter how it's toasting here and there praise the Lord and that's the reason why Paul can go to sleep he can go to sleep because I mean he have just got a vision the Lord St by him that Di and told him Paul you go to sleep and you know have a good rest this boat will not sink and he's telling all the people on the boat if if y'all were just listening to me we going to arrive praise the lord we are going to arrive we will get there and that's the thing that I've been trying to label onor you know get us to that place to understand look people we did not know about a rapture we didn't know about a body change praise the Lord amen we never made a promise he made a promise about a Rapture he made a promise about the body change praise the Lord and the god that promised it is is more than able to bring it to pass no matter where we are no matter how tough it is it is just that place of having the grace that your faith can rise to the place to realize I'm not in control he's the one in control praise the Lord and that's why when we come to the Lord and we we we put ourselves there we see a promise in the world we say God you promised this I I can't be able to live this I can't fulfill this you promise be it unto me according to your word fulfill your word in me it's it's it's a beautiful it's just a beautiful relationship where we can rest on the Lord that is the secret of the Christian faith rest that's the secret of the Christian faith rest praise the lord it's it's it's one of the two and when you are working God can't work he has to rest amen if you can take rest in his promise you can put God to work he will send angels on your behalf amen and when you are resting in his promise he will send angel on your behalf praise the Lord I mean what what a what an inspiration to know that is the Lord that is drawing he's the one that is drawing he's the one that is bringing us closer praise the Lord he's the one that is creating this desire in us to live right the desire to tell the truth the desire to confess our sins praise the Lord just to know that he is the one that is working mightily in US draw me nearer amen draw me nearer nearer blessed Lord are we together now listening to this I read this morning and I'll close right here amen and uh uh uh Paul says something here let's go back to that I was going to read something but uh I want to go back to that uh look at this look at this uh this setting right here draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands yeah Sinner and purify your heart yeah double minded now uh uh uh as I was as I was just meditating on this like I said uh uh what what came to my mind you know what came to to my mind uh as I was thinking on this is that see how the the Apostle James you know like I said words words amazing in Translation the effect of uh what a person say sometimes can be missing in Translation but if you just think about this this way now the Bible talking about uh you know wash your hands your Sinners purify your heart your double minded he says draw night unto the Lord and He will draw night unto you now in one way you can look at it for me to draw night to the Lord I need to cleanse my hands the Bible says I'mma cleanse my hands the Bible say I'mma cleanse my heart praise the Lord if you look at it that way it's becoming your works praise the lord it's becoming your works now now if we look at it as he's the one that is drawing us if he's doing the drawing then he have to do the cleansing and he has to do the purifying of our hearts praise the Lord because in in in in in many in many places that's where uh most time you know people try to practice religion if I can do this you know if I can do that if I can do this and then at the end when it gets to the place of all the effort that is put in and they still see themsel laboring on a habit struggling with things in their life then th Old Devil tell them you see this thing is not true nobody can live it nobody can live the word of God praise the Lord nobody can live it because it's not man's words but the god that said it he can perform it the god that said he can bring it to pass are we together but there's a beautiful H uh uh uh uh levitical preaching that is set up here you realize that uh you know uh uh that's that's what the Old Testament priest would do just before they come to minister him just before they they get to ministering there is a lava there they had to go and washed wash their hands and wash their feet just before they can go into the the the Tabernacle to start offering sacrifice unto the Lord praise the Lord amen James in another way bringing bringing bringing that blessing to us you know that when he when he when he draw us when he's when he's dealing with with us is not just to have us to be there but he want to take us into the holy place he want to take us into service because when the priest gets to the Tabernacle he just just don't get there to stand around and be looking around no he have to go into service and how do he get into service wash his hands he wash his feet he confess his sins and the sin of the people and then he goes into offering sacrifice the sprinkling of the blood the the the sprinkling of uh the water of Separation then he goes into all there are we together now brother brandham said this this is the second thing I wanted to read to you from the same message he says he says what if a baby before it was born let's take that a baby a little baby that live in the womb of the mother for these nine months and that little baby could think it would say you know what they tell me I'm fixing to be born well what will what will I do out there I don't know I don't know nothing but nothing but that place about that place that uh I live here and I don't know nothing but this place that I live which mean I don't know nothing about out there only about this place in the womb I derive my strength from inside and how will I make a living out there they tell me me there's a some some that shine it tell me that the people there walk around and I don't know nothing but just this place here this is all I know right here in the womb of my mother here's word I was brought in years all I know is right in this W and they tell me that there's just room times wrong which mean out there is a bigger space than just this place where I am praise the Lord I can hear the voices of the people but I don't know what they are doing I can hear noises but I don't know what's going on praise the Lord now he's he set in the same year now you have to know now the the the the whole thing that is behind this message uh uh brother Brandon Vision behind the curtain of time was just published in the four gospel man uh uh man uh Full Gospel businessman voice they publish it in their magazine so he he had brother N Ready to the church so that's where all of this is coming from now he's talking about that place in comparing to this place praise the Lord are we together well that little baby will be scared to death to be born because they don't know what to expect they don't know what what is going to happen there they are they are in this place they are comfortable that's their space but he hear a voice of a mother that says uh H uh you will soon be here with us you know Mama goes to sharpen the they hear noise in the shopping Hall they don't know what is happening they are just assuming in their mind brother B say she uh this little baby is saying how I don't know how I'm going to survive I know how I'm surviving you I have mother right here and and and you know whatever she feels that's what I feel I don't know how I'm going to survive that brother B say she's going to be scared to death praise the Lord cuz it's coming into a place to know nothing about the child is coming into a place to know which is supreme million of times Supreme to word is being living it it wouldn't know what it's all about it it says how what am I going to do it it be scared to death to be born but we who live out here well we that are back there one time we we who by no means go back there so what he's saying we we we were once in a womb we have come we have experience the space we don't want to go back to the wom amen the child that have not come here don't know what to expect but we that have been born we have grown we we know know there is a continent I mean uh I mean the baby don't have to use vehicle there but we use vehicle here we see the space we don't want to go back to that small place again are we together praise the Lord now he's going to he's going to he's he's he's comparing it between going you know behind the curtain of time you know what the the the the the the blessing that is waiting for us on the other side but also in a sense he's comparing it to to to to our birth when when we have when we have uh uh you know get away from relying on our strength and our effort and you know we can we can trust the Lord we can walk by faith and not by sight are we together we can walk by faith and not by sight we who live here well we there uh we that was back there one time we who by no means go back there we wouldn't want to go back into the mother's womb again see no we wouldn't want to do that and and brother Brandon I mean and that's what Jesus you know trying to bring to Nicodemus you know that you know if you are born again you know you will understand super natural thing you hon understand spiritual things say how can a man be born do I have to go back into to my mother's womb amen and you realize uh uh through the Through the Ages that is the thing that have caused denomination because people has been going back to their old womb they've been going back to their old system praise the Lord and with the move of God he take us from glory to glory From Grace to Grace the prophet said that's why people are afraid of the new birth because they don't know what to expect they they don't want to add funny they don't want to shout you know that they they grew up in a very quiet Church you know and uh you know very quiet they do their sign of the cross you know their services are shot you know and they don't want to get to the experience where they just break out and shout and dancing in their Spirit they don't want to do that they don't know what to expect praise the Lord but you and myself that have been there amen and we have break through into this joy of the Lord Lord hallelujah what a good feeling when the word just stimulates you amen sometimes you don't even know how it comes it just comes through you when you shout praise the Lord you know how it feels when you just sit there in the service and nothing really stimulates you you just feel so so dried and so dull because you want you want a connection with the word he wants something to be said that will that will connect with something in you praise the lord it's a different feeling we don't want to go back to that dead experience anymore praise the lord we don't want to go back and and that's how the Lord draw us he draw us to more and more and more and more of his presence praise the Lord our understanding comes you know uh just from ourself just from our church just from legalizing we we start to understand this is a bigger picture it's not all about me it's all about him and in him is more than me praise the Lord in him is more than me praise the Lord hallelujah so you see there a beautiful picture here he says uh he goes on he say it's a million time million times of praying to where we've been living it wouldn't know what it's all about that little baby wouldn't know how what am I going to do it it be scared to death to be born but we who live out here well we that was once back there we who by no means go back we wouldn't want to go back into mother's womb again no we wouldn't want to do that praise the Lord and and that's just the way it is when we are dying friends oh God see we are being born into a place praise the Lord so death for us in this body is birth into another place praise the Lord amen you have been born into a place you have never been there you couldn't understand it how great it is how is going to be out there we think about a streets of God we think about Mansions the only idea we have is the Mansions we see here we don't know how the Mansions going to be praise the Lord when we think about streets of God we look at our streets that's the picture that come to our mind we say well it might not be black because it's gold it might be you know uh in a gold color that's the picture that come to our mind because we have never been there all everything we can imagine about heaven we relate it to something around us praise the Lord that's the reason why yet we cannot appreciate a thousand years because how long have we Liv we have not hit 100 yet then you thinking about thousand are we together so we don't know what to what you know what to expect you see and and like the Apostle says I have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come close to our heart in everything that we know it about heaven we have not got close to what the reality is just like that baby in the womb have not got close to what the reality of living on Earth we have not got close you see and that's the reason why the devil can use our struggle to make us to think that it's it's not real amen when we going through different things sickness in our body and and different things we are dealing with all he's trying to do is to kill the reality of Heaven in our mind so just make us believe it's all yeah it's it's it's just here it's just here there is there is nothing real to that oh but there is there is a substance of faith in our heart amen praise the lord we feed this courage we fall down we make mistakes but there is a supernal thing in our heart praise the Lord that picks us up and then we we we we we keep on on the joining we keep going to that City praise the Lord is moving us to that city are we together the only thing that makes me realize or you realize is that little touch of life like the spirit comes into the baby in his mother's wom see is the only way that we can understand what is that great land out y when there's no sickness no sorrow no death no oish nothing oh my is that little that little touch of Life praise the Lord that little touch of life it just anoint our heart it just create faith we are in all of these pains but yet we can tell ourself I will be okay that little touch of life because the baby has life even though she don't know what is happening outside but she's kicking praise the Lord she's kicking sometimes she hear loud noise she gets afraid you know sign signs proof that you know children born in abusive home it can affect them from the womb are we together let the musicians come tonight this is this supposed to be a prayer meeting not a preaching service amen you know when uh when I was meditating on this this afternoon when brother brandom said year he said the little baby says they tell me I'm fixing to be born there's a song that came to my mind oh they tell me not a place amen oh the land of perfet day let's let's sing that song tonight while when you once get over there you did never want to come back to this place to a place like this no more than the baby will want to go back to his mother's wom see it's so much greater on the other side all the land of per day we can understand it certainly how that a baby is beyond any thinking so uh are we beyond any understanding of what that will be out there because we

you cannot bust the egg for the cheek to come out the chick has to grow and break herself into the next experience just like the child in the womb that little baby has to turn herself around mother cannot turn her around she turned her yourself around and get ready to burst into the word and father whatever warm whatever experience we find ourself in oh god oh Father may we prepare ourself to burst to the next experience because it's all that is about this life we go from one birth to another birth we go from one birth birth if we refuse to be birth then we are [Music] dead if we refuse to Break Forth to a new experience then we are dead that's why the Apostle Paul said she that living in pleasure is dead if we just only think it is just this one experience if we just only think that is it's is enough just to say I'm in the message no God we want to turn around we want to get ready Lord to birth into our next experience we want to get ready to birath into a closer experience with you
