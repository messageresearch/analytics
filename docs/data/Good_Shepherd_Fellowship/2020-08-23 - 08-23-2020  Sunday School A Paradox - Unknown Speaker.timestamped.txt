[0:00] [Music]
[1:06] our heavenly father
[1:08] we have humbly come to the lord
[1:11] confessing it we are not worthy of
[1:14] coming but because of
[1:15] jesus has made the way for us and has
[1:19] paid the price
[1:20] therefore we can come boldly to the
[1:22] throne of grace
[1:24] in a time of need and now lord as we are
[1:28] here to present
[1:29] the gospel searchable
[1:33] riches of christ we need you lord
[1:36] and there might be one setting here
[1:38] father that you're trying to school
[1:41] and a great way that you might send them
[1:44] somewhere to a
[1:45] great mission that you have purpose
[1:49] i pray father that if that be so that
[1:51] this night that
[1:52] your purpose will be fulfilled and help
[1:55] us
[1:56] as we present ourselves to you for
[1:59] service now thou did behold all the
[2:03] hands and looking yet
[2:05] at those that are up thou knowest what
[2:08] is in need
[2:09] and i pray that you'll supply father i
[2:12] offer my prayer with their
[2:14] prayer and their desires my desires upon
[2:18] the golden altar
[2:19] for our sacrifice lays tonight in the
[2:23] name of the lord
[2:24] jesus we pray that you'll break the
[2:27] bread of life to us
[2:28] out of thy word amen
[2:41] i am sorry to be just a little late only
[2:44] i understood that tonight it was just a
[2:47] little late the
[2:48] service is running just a little late
[2:50] we'll make up for it
[2:52] and get out just as quick as possible
[2:55] now we want to approach
[2:58] the word tonight and with all that was
[3:02] in us
[3:03] i know you're here you some of these
[3:06] fine
[3:06] singers i mel johnson for one that i
[3:09] know
[3:10] sitting here i've asked him to sing for
[3:12] us that
[3:13] song that i just can't get off of my
[3:17] mind
[3:18] constantly i'm humming it about the
[3:20] tears come running down
[3:22] i i like that and i think he's go to
[3:25] same businessman's breakfast or
[3:26] somewhere for us
[3:27] jim won't you be sure to get that for me
[3:30] and if you have a little tape put it on
[3:32] that for me special so
[3:33] uh my children want to hear it when i
[3:36] gotta get
[3:37] down a little low i i hear that it makes
[3:39] me feel good to hear
[3:41] good singing and billy i go into office
[3:43] down there and he's constantly got them
[3:45] tapes of singing going all the time and
[3:47] i think it kind of helps him you know
[3:49] there's something about
[3:50] song that's got power in it we all know
[3:54] that we're
[3:54] we are aware of that that's
[3:57] look at the army on the saying the songs
[4:01] and play the music
[4:02] do you know the approach to war in the
[4:05] army
[4:06] of the god is first by music
[4:09] the singers went before the ark
[4:11] rejoicing and singing
[4:13] then come the ark and then the battle
[4:15] that's right
[4:17] so that's the right approach and that's
[4:18] reason we come into service at night
[4:20] what do we do sing the hymns of the lord
[4:24] then the ark the word read the word and
[4:27] then the battle
[4:28] and we're in so the great banners are
[4:31] flying tonight
[4:33] the name of the jesus christ the lord
[4:35] god
[4:36] may be exalted the enemy be put to
[4:39] flight
[4:40] and the god win the victory tonight and
[4:42] save souls
[4:44] heal the sick and afflicted cause those
[4:47] that are weary and stooped low to raise
[4:49] up their heads and rejoice
[4:52] get great glory into himself
[4:56] we ask this in the name of the lord
[4:59] jesus
[5:00] i want you to turn tonight with me if
[5:02] you have your bible and
[5:03] sometimes people just mark the little
[5:05] text
[5:06] that ministers speak on it used to be
[5:10] that i could
[5:11] think of these right quick without even
[5:14] writing them down but after uh
[5:16] just past 25 why
[5:20] a few months ago i mean the second time
[5:25] and so it makes a little harder for me
[5:28] to remember i'm
[5:29] bearing a lot of scars from the battles
[5:32] and as we get older we just don't think
[5:34] like we used to and i have
[5:35] when i look at the scripture and see
[5:37] that i remember what the text is
[5:39] let's turn to joshua the 10th chapter
[5:42] begin reading at the 12th verse
[5:46] then speak josh away to the lord
[5:49] in the day when the lord delivered up
[5:51] the amorites
[5:53] before the children of israel and he
[5:55] said in the sight
[5:57] of israel sons stand
[6:00] thou still over gideon and moon
[6:04] over the valley of agilent and the sun
[6:08] stood still and the moon stayed
[6:11] until the people had avenged themselves
[6:14] on
[6:14] their enemies is not this
[6:18] written in the book of jasher so the sun
[6:21] stood still in the midst of heaven
[6:25] and hastened not to go down about the
[6:28] whole day and
[6:32] there was no day like that before it or
[6:35] after that the lord hearkened into the
[6:38] voice of a man
[6:40] or the lord fought for
[6:43] israel the lord had his blessings to the
[6:47] reading of his word i want to take a
[6:49] text out of there for about
[6:51] 30 minutes if i can hold it to that
[6:54] a paradox
[6:58] just use that one word a paradox
[7:02] now according to webster a paradox
[7:06] is something that seems incredible
[7:10] but it's true therefore
[7:13] a paradox and would be the same as
[7:16] a miracle a paradox
[7:20] is when something is it seems like it
[7:23] just couldn't be the
[7:24] the knowledge of the human mind it's all
[7:28] together
[7:28] incredible but yet it's proven true
[7:33] now a miracle would be the same thing
[7:36] or a miracle cannot be explained
[7:40] a miracle is something that happens and
[7:42] you cannot explain it
[7:44] that makes it a paradox it's incredible
[7:46] but yet it's the truth
[7:48] now people today a lot of modernists
[7:53] believe that the days of miracles are
[7:55] passed
[7:56] they don't believe there is such a thing
[7:58] as
[7:59] a miracle but yet
[8:03] i believe that the world's full of
[8:05] miracles
[8:06] uh i believe the paradox uh constantly
[8:11] for instance i believe that every
[8:12] born-again member of the body of christ
[8:16] is a paradox in themselves
[8:19] i believe each one of you methodists and
[8:21] presbyterian and lutheran
[8:23] that never had experienced the baptism
[8:25] of the holy spirit
[8:27] was in some formal church that did not
[8:30] believe in
[8:30] the genuine new birth and has now
[8:33] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[8:35] is a perfect example of a paradox
[8:39] because something happened to you that
[8:41] changed your whole
[8:43] being and anyone could look at that and
[8:46] know that
[8:47] what a paradox is america
[8:50] unless that happens you cannot be a
[8:54] christian
[8:54] there must be a paradox for you to
[8:56] become a christian
[8:58] because no one can can change
[9:01] a spirit in a man and give him new birth
[9:04] outside of god
[9:06] god alone is the only one can do it and
[9:08] it's a miracle
[9:09] how that god can take a man's thinking
[9:13] and his ways and his life and everything
[9:16] and change it from what it
[9:18] was for what it can be what he can make
[9:21] it
[9:23] for instance a few days ago i was called
[9:26] in on a
[9:26] scene or on a a little something going
[9:30] on
[9:31] there was a fine young man
[9:34] very fine boy he was going with a little
[9:38] girl
[9:39] very fine little girl out of a fine
[9:41] family
[9:43] and this boy all of a sudden
[9:46] came up with some kind of an idea and he
[9:50] just
[9:50] walked away he did something wrong to
[9:53] the little girl and much has promised
[9:55] her to do a certain thing and then
[9:56] didn't do it and instead of coming to
[10:00] the girl and apologizing like a
[10:02] gentleman should do
[10:04] it just wasn't aiming to do it and the
[10:07] father and mother
[10:08] called me to the scene and said we would
[10:11] desire to know what is wrong with our
[10:14] boy
[10:16] now it's not easy to do sometimes
[10:19] but you must be truthful and honest
[10:22] therefore the boy was a christian as far
[10:26] as a believer
[10:27] he had repented and had been baptized
[10:30] and
[10:31] had his position among the believers
[10:34] but yet had not received the baptism of
[10:37] the holy spirit
[10:39] and no matter how much he thought he had
[10:42] you thinking you have and having it is
[10:44] two different things
[10:46] you might be able to try to say you have
[10:49] you might be able to show some evidence
[10:51] of some emotion
[10:53] but unless you're alive is vindicating
[10:57] what you're professing to have you still
[10:59] haven't got it
[11:00] no matter how many emotions how much you
[11:03] jump runs sensations speaking in tongues
[11:05] or shouting
[11:06] or whatever you might lay it upon which
[11:08] is all right i believe in all that too
[11:10] but unless your life copes with your
[11:13] testimony
[11:14] then you haven't got it because the
[11:16] fruit of the spirit
[11:17] vindicates what you are just like the
[11:19] fruit of any tree tells
[11:21] what it is jesus said by the fruits you
[11:25] shall know that
[11:26] now this young uh
[11:29] fellas parents his mother
[11:33] german no reflection on the german but
[11:35] there's a strain in that family
[11:38] and that is they'll just sit and you can
[11:41] talk to them
[11:42] and they'll just stare you right in the
[11:44] face
[11:45] uh they gotta this girl's sister the
[11:48] mother of this boy
[11:51] her sister i have come down the street
[11:54] many morning and
[11:55] this young lady be sitting out in the
[11:57] yard i'd say
[11:59] good morning to you she just looked at
[12:01] me and i'd stop
[12:02] i'd say sure fine morning she'd just
[12:05] stand and look right at you
[12:06] an intelligent woman and i'd say
[12:10] come up to see us sometime just stand
[12:12] and look
[12:13] well her brothers are that way father
[12:15] and mother is that way
[12:17] now the father of the boy is strictly an
[12:20] irishman
[12:22] moody and high tempered
[12:25] high strung that's his whole family
[12:28] like that except one other other family
[12:31] converted
[12:33] now in this this boy
[12:36] this father and mother both are
[12:39] christians
[12:40] filled with the holy ghost and they have
[12:42] brought this young man up
[12:44] in the way of the lord and now the young
[12:47] man's about
[12:48] 17 or 18 years old something along there
[12:51] very fine kid and he's been a real model
[12:54] boy at home
[12:56] nice kid and he's got a brother
[12:59] that just vice versa but the girls
[13:04] the mother family
[13:07] lives close to the fine church but do
[13:11] you think they'd ever come over there
[13:12] no and they know it's right but it's
[13:14] just not in them to
[13:16] to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they
[13:18] just won't do it
[13:20] just not in them now the genes
[13:23] in the father and the mother of this boy
[13:25] no matter how much they are converted
[13:27] still remains the flesh has been
[13:30] interbred
[13:31] out to this boy therefore the boy
[13:34] has got a complex in him just like from
[13:37] his mother's family
[13:38] and they are not forgiving they will not
[13:41] apologize
[13:42] and that's where that boy stands now i
[13:45] said to the father
[13:46] no matter how much you've raised him up
[13:48] i said now look at you out of your
[13:49] family
[13:50] all of them drunks and and fighting and
[13:54] shooting and cutting and so forth now
[13:57] look at
[13:58] your family to the mother there are a
[14:00] bunch of people just sit there and won't
[14:02] speak very independent and so forth
[14:04] irreverent
[14:05] to religion but i said it's not you
[14:08] you're the only one of all your sisters
[14:10] and brothers
[14:10] and you're sweet kind and forgiving what
[14:13] does that
[14:14] and your tree part of that family tree
[14:17] yet
[14:18] you have received the holy ghost that's
[14:20] the thing that made you tender and sweet
[14:22] it's not your people anymore
[14:26] it's your christ that lives in you i
[14:28] said to the boy
[14:29] look at your family practically all of
[14:31] them drunks
[14:32] and so forth i said and how moody and
[14:36] and high-tempered high-strung but you're
[14:39] not
[14:39] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[14:42] holy spirit you're no more what you are
[14:44] it's christ than you i said now that
[14:46] same thing has to happen to your son
[14:49] and the father raised up and said my son
[14:51] went to the altar
[14:53] he was baptized correctly in the name of
[14:56] jesus christ and water baptism
[14:58] in the pool said i know my son has come
[15:01] to christ i said that may be all right
[15:04] all the outward motions he might be
[15:06] identified as a believer
[15:07] with the believers but until he's
[15:10] regenerated
[15:11] borne again i'd advise that young man to
[15:14] never marry a woman
[15:15] he'll make hell on earth for until that
[15:18] gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ
[15:21] comes in
[15:22] then that will be a paradox in itself to
[15:24] take the very
[15:25] nature of a boy that's bred between
[15:28] father and mother
[15:29] and yet in his intellectuals he's trying
[15:32] his best to overcome it he can't do it
[15:34] he'll never overcome it christ will have
[15:36] to overcome it when he lets christ in
[15:39] and he's already
[15:40] overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox
[15:44] when a man is born of the spirit of god
[15:47] i've seen
[15:47] critics stand off and make fun and carry
[15:50] on
[15:51] of a holy ghost a revival and after a
[15:53] while god get a hold of that same
[15:56] man and change him and here he stands
[15:57] right in the pulpit preaching the same
[15:59] thing
[15:59] that he once hated it's a paradox how
[16:02] that
[16:03] god can take the unbeliever and make
[16:06] a believer out of him now
[16:09] i wonder if a man thinks that miracles
[16:11] has passed
[16:12] i wonder what kind of a scientific
[16:14] medicine you could give such a person
[16:17] to change that disposition in them to
[16:20] take that
[16:21] hatred and malice and strife there's no
[16:24] one can explain it
[16:25] but it's a paradox because it's a
[16:27] miracle of god
[16:29] when a man is changed from the person
[16:32] that he is
[16:32] to a new creature in christ jesus he
[16:35] becomes
[16:36] a new creation he's no more what he used
[16:39] to be
[16:40] he's absolutely a new creation in
[16:43] christ this world itself that we're
[16:46] living on
[16:46] is absolutely a paradox how
[16:50] it was formed we find out in hebrews
[16:52] 11th chapter and a third verse
[16:54] that the world was framed together by
[16:58] the word of god
[17:00] where did god get the material to make
[17:02] this world
[17:04] how did he do it the bible says that
[17:07] it was formed and framed together all of
[17:10] his structure
[17:11] and his part was put together by the
[17:13] word of god
[17:14] if that is the paradox i don't know
[17:16] where it is where
[17:18] could we produce and say he got the
[17:20] material when there was no material
[17:23] he had to speak it into existence
[17:26] it's a paradox that this world is shared
[17:29] tonight
[17:30] another thing it's a paradox of how it
[17:33] stays
[17:34] in its orbit hanging in space
[17:37] how can it hang there that one place
[17:40] spinning
[17:40] this way about 1100 miles an hour
[17:43] 24 or 25 000 miles around it goes around
[17:46] every 24 hours so
[17:48] perfect it doesn't miss a second so
[17:51] perfect turning at a better than a about
[17:55] better than a thousand miles an hour
[17:56] it's turning around like this
[17:58] hanging in space if it would go up or
[18:00] down any
[18:02] well am i would it interrupt the whole
[18:12] system
[19:01] now the genes in the father and the
[19:05] mother of this boy no matter how much
[19:07] they're converted
[19:08] still remains the flesh has been
[19:10] interbred
[19:11] out to this boy therefore the boy
[19:15] has got a complex in him just like from
[19:18] his mother's family
[19:19] and they are not forgiving they will not
[19:22] apologize
[19:23] and that's where that boy stands now i
[19:26] said to the father
[19:27] no matter how much you've raised him up
[19:28] i said now look at you out of your
[19:30] family
[19:31] all of them drunks and and fighting and
[19:35] shooting and cutting and so forth now
[19:38] look at
[19:38] your family to the mother there are a
[19:40] bunch of people just sit there and won't
[19:42] speak very independent and so forth
[19:45] irreverent
[19:46] to religion but i said it's not you
[19:48] you're the only one of all your sisters
[19:50] and brothers
[19:51] and you're sweet kind and forgiving what
[19:54] does that
[19:55] and you're a tree part of that family
[19:57] tree
[19:58] yet you have received the holy ghost
[20:01] that's the thing that made you tender
[20:02] and sweet it's not
[20:04] your people anymore it's your christ
[20:07] that lives in you
[20:09] i said to the boy look at your family
[20:11] practically all of them
[20:12] drunks and so forth i said and how
[20:16] moody and high tempered high strung
[20:19] but you're not you're kind forgiving
[20:22] what is it
[20:22] the holy spirit you're no more what you
[20:24] are it's christ in you
[20:26] i said now that same thing has to happen
[20:28] to your son
[20:29] and the father raised up and said my son
[20:32] went to the altar
[20:33] he was baptized correctly in the name of
[20:36] jesus christ and water baptism
[20:39] in the pool said i know my son has come
[20:42] to christ i said that may be all right
[20:44] all the outward motions he might be
[20:46] identified as a believer
[20:48] with the believer's button until he's
[20:50] regenerated
[20:52] born again i'd advise that young man to
[20:54] never marry a woman
[20:56] he'll make hell on earth for until that
[20:59] gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ
[21:01] comes in
[21:02] then that will be a paradox in itself to
[21:05] take the very
[21:06] nature of a boy that's bred between
[21:08] father and mother
[21:10] and yet in his intellectuals he's trying
[21:12] his best to overcome it
[21:14] he can't do it he'll never overcome it
[21:16] christ
[21:17] will have to overcome it when he lets
[21:19] christ in and he's already
[21:20] overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox
[21:24] when a man is born of the spirit of god
[21:27] i've seen
[21:28] critics stand off and make fun and carry
[21:31] on
[21:31] of a holy ghost a revival and after a
[21:34] while god get ahold of that same
[21:36] man and change him and here he stands
[21:38] right in the pulpit preaching the same
[21:39] thing
[21:40] that he once hated it's a paradox how
[21:43] that god
[21:44] can take the unbeliever and make a
[21:47] believer
[21:47] out of him now i wonder if a man thinks
[21:51] that
[21:51] miracles has passed i wonder what kind
[21:54] of a scientific medicine
[21:56] you could give such a person to change
[21:58] that disposition in them
[22:00] to take that the hatred and malice and
[22:03] stride about
[22:04] there's no one can explain it but it's a
[22:06] paradox because it's a miracle of god
[22:09] when a man is changed from the person
[22:12] that he is
[22:13] to a new creature in christ jesus he
[22:16] becomes a
[22:16] new creation he's no more what he used
[22:20] to be
[22:20] he's absolutely a new creation
[22:23] in christ this world itself that we're
[22:26] living on
[22:27] is absolutely a paradox how it was
[22:30] formed we find out
[22:32] in hebrews 11th chapter and a third
[22:34] verse
[22:35] that the world was framed together by
[22:38] the word of god
[22:40] where did god get the material to make
[22:43] this world
[22:45] how did he do it the bible says that it
[22:48] was
[22:49] formed and framed together all of his
[22:51] structure
[22:52] and his part was put together by the
[22:54] word of god
[22:55] if that is the paradox i don't know
[22:57] where it is where could
[22:59] we produce and say he got the material
[23:01] when there was no material
[23:03] he had to speak it into existence
[23:07] it's a paradox that this world is here
[23:10] tonight
[23:11] another thing it's a paradox of how it
[23:14] stays
[23:14] in its orbit hanging in space
[23:18] how can it hang there that one place
[23:20] spinning
[23:21] this way about 1100 miles an hour 24 or
[23:24] 25 000 miles around
[23:26] it goes around every 24 hours so perfect
[23:29] it doesn't miss a second
[23:31] so perfect turning at a better than a
[23:34] about
[23:35] better than
[24:36] this world itself that we're living on
[24:38] is absolutely a paradox
[24:41] how it was formed we find out in hebrews
[24:44] 11th chapter and a third verse
[24:46] that the world was framed together by
[24:49] the word of god
[24:51] where did god get the material to make
[24:54] this world
[24:56] how did he do it the bible says that it
[24:59] was
[25:00] formed and framed together all of his
[25:02] structure
[25:03] and his part was put together by the
[25:05] word of god
[25:06] if that is the paradox i don't know
[25:08] where it is where could
[25:10] we produce and say he got the material
[25:13] when there was no material
[25:15] he had to speak it into existence
[25:18] it's a paradox that this world is shared
[25:21] tonight
[25:22] another thing it's a paradox of how it
[25:25] stays
[25:26] in its orbit hanging in space
[25:29] how can it hang there in that one place
[25:32] spinning this away about 1100 miles an
[25:34] hour
[25:35] 24 or 25 000 miles around it goes around
[25:38] every 24 hours so perfect it doesn't
[25:41] miss a second
[25:43] so perfect turning at a better than a
[25:46] about
[25:46] uh better than a thousand miles an hour
[25:48] it's turning around like this
[25:50] hanging in space if it go up or down any
[25:54] why am i would it interrupt the whole
[25:56] system of god's solar system
[25:58] and it goes around the equator around
[26:00] the orbit
[26:01] so many a year's time it never fails the
[26:04] seasons just
[26:05] exactly tell me what holds it up there
[26:09] what turns is so perfect in time you can
[26:12] get a watch i don't know how much you
[26:14] might pay for one a thousand dollars
[26:16] and that watch within a space of a month
[26:19] will lose
[26:20] minutes they haven't got anything that
[26:23] can work so perfect but yet this world
[26:25] turns perfect wow it's
[26:28] god doing it it's a paradox
[26:31] god commanded to do that and it doesn't
[26:35] how about the moon yet millions of miles
[26:38] away from the earth
[26:39] and yet it it controls the tides
[26:42] on the earth millions of miles away
[26:46] its influence of standing in his space
[26:50] standing in its orbit it influences
[26:54] the earth each planet influences the
[26:57] other
[26:58] by staying in its place oh what a sermon
[27:01] i could take from hear our lesson
[27:02] however each one of god's creatures
[27:05] would stay in his
[27:06] place it would influence the other but
[27:08] we get off on some wild tantrum
[27:10] somewhere
[27:11] form an organization and separate
[27:13] ourselves seemingly not having the faith
[27:15] and then we got the whole system of
[27:17] christianity mixed up
[27:18] if ever a man would stay in his place it
[27:21] would be a paradox of god
[27:23] the sea of god could bring presbyterians
[27:26] lutherans baptists methodists catholics
[27:28] and all together if we come back to the
[27:30] word of god it would be a real paradox
[27:33] and then the whole church could agree
[27:35] not upon your creeds and so forth but
[27:37] upon the word the way it's written
[27:38] because
[27:39] it's a no private interpretation says
[27:41] the scripture
[27:42] how that that moon influences the world
[27:46] here not long ago a friend of mine my
[27:48] neighbor
[27:49] was digging holes for all wells down in
[27:52] the state of kentucky
[27:53] and when that moon begins to rise over
[27:56] there
[27:56] that tide comes in all the way across
[27:59] through the earth
[28:00] that salt water down in the whole worthy
[28:03] drill
[28:04] will raise up well that moon comes no
[28:06] matter it's down
[28:08] hundreds of feet below the surface of
[28:10] the or the top of the earth here
[28:12] goes down hundreds of feet yet when that
[28:14] moon turns around
[28:15] that water raises to meet it
[28:18] you can't hide anything when god has
[28:21] commanded it has got to obey
[28:23] god when god gives his command that's
[28:25] the reason i know
[28:26] he'll have a church without spot or
[28:29] without wrinkle god has commanded itself
[28:32] [Applause]
[28:33] it'll have to obey the gospel heaven
[28:37] because the word of god has said so how
[28:40] the tides the moon and everything
[28:42] influence the actions of the earth you
[28:45] take
[28:46] we see a star shoot we call it a star
[28:48] that isn't a star shooting it's a light
[28:49] of course we know that
[28:51] but we call it a star that star could
[28:52] not move that far
[28:54] if one star would move out of its orbit
[28:56] it would probably influence
[28:58] everything in the cycle in the whole uh
[29:01] universe that would it would interrupt
[29:03] everything would stay at his spot
[29:05] in order to keep the system of god
[29:08] moving
[29:09] so must we stay in our place we must
[29:11] stay as
[29:12] sons and daughters of god and we've
[29:14] never fallen back there the thing we've
[29:16] been turning there's been no
[29:17] death or nothing else but thanks be to
[29:19] god there's coming a paradox
[29:21] when god himself will settle back in
[29:23] place where she should be
[29:25] yes a paradox man that don't believe in
[29:28] in a paradox and don't believe in
[29:30] miracles how
[29:32] could you justify your intelligence
[29:35] and looking in the face of things that
[29:37] you cannot explain
[29:38] it's totally impossible for any man to
[29:41] explain
[29:42] how that world can revolve itself and
[29:44] keep in perfect time and ever
[29:46] the whole solar system and those things
[29:49] and how the moon can influence the earth
[29:50] and
[29:51] how many other things can we tell about
[29:53] how the
[29:54] the sap in the fall of the year will go
[29:57] down in the root of the tree without any
[29:59] intelligence to run it down there bring
[30:00] it back in spring of the year with new
[30:02] life
[30:03] why it's a paradox no one can explain it
[30:06] we don't know
[30:06] how it's done but god doesn't therefore
[30:10] it
[30:10] is a paradox constantly it's a
[30:13] mystery how that god does that we look
[30:16] at it so much
[30:17] until it becomes so common we look over
[30:20] the top of it
[30:22] and that's what's the matter with the we
[30:23] pentecostal people
[30:36] [Music]
[31:34] you
