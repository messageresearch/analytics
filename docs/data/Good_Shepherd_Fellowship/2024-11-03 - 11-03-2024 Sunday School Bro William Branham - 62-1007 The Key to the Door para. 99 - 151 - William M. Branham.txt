TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e methodists and many of the Protestant churches would gladly accept Catholic Roman Catholic Doctrine if they could get over the little hump of communion but they will agree that the priests should be married and be ministers the Catholic Church agreed on that several times in their conferences and meetings they agree on it and they agree upon different uh uh prayers and so forth the Protestant church will agree upon it in the catechisms and so forth the little altar here and there and the Catholic church is willing to do it but when it come to the communion there they fail now anybody that's ever read history knows that but of course to my way of thinking they'd have a lot to get away from for I can accept it you see because it isn't Bible but I want you to say one thing to the Catholic church do you know the Catholic church in the beginning was the Apostolic Pentecostal Church certainly was it was the first beginning of the church and you see where they why they got to they kept taking away the word and injecting a dogma and the Pentecostal church should exist another hundred years it would be farther off of the Bible than the Catholic church is today from the way it's going now it took the Catholic Church several hundred years to get away from it 300 years from the early church to the organizing of the Roman Catholic Church which they started out and they caught bringing in big dignitaries and things and they cut out this and put in this and taking out this and put up that and taking down Pagan idols and put up Christian statues and so forth and just compromising on that till they come to what they got now the Roman Catholic church and the Protestant Pentecostal Church from the the 50 years that it's been in existence and where it's fell from where it's started it'll be a worse shape in the Catholic church in 100 years from now that's right that's a big word to say but just look where they've fallen from they went right into organization went right in compromising on this and that and everything else and there they go see going right back but communion is called the Lord's Supper now a lot of people they want to take it in the morning didn't say in the Bible it was his breakfast and how these people today how they can still say Lord supper and they don't they've cut out supper and omitted it and called it dinner nonsense supper now always a dispute in the Bible times it was a dispute then the people misunderstood the Lord's Supper when they come to the table Paul told those Corinthians they were coming and getting drunk at the Lord's table see it was misunderstood right then he said if you want to eat eat at home and another thing it was misunderstood what it was h a Sinners and man living in sin come and took the communion that was misunderstood a man living with his mother Foster mother and the church had told him about still taking communion at the table and there were divisions among them and they were still taking communion he said I understand you walk like the rest of the Gentiles and there's there's fiction among you like there is at at uh especially in sas's house and so forth said you walk like the rest of the Gentiles see it was misunderstood the communion has always been misunderstood now I could go on for that for hours but we got to get this communion and the feet washing now they've simply omitted feate washing all together just a few of the denominations lot of the Pentecostals has got completely away from it see and it's still in the Bible just the way it was wrote see now Rome does not call it communion they call it Mass it's a Holy Mass they don't take communion they take a mass it's a mass and a mass certainly takes the real me meaning from communion aass means hoping they take a mass hoping that in doing this in the mass that God will forgive them of their sins by taking the literal Body of Christ which the priest turns from to the body and the blood of Christ taking that hoping that God will omit their sins by doing so it's a mass the Protestants call it communion communion means Thanksgiving that the Protestant the Catholic is taking a mass in the mass hoping that God forgives them are evildoing the Protestant takes it with Thanksgiving for what's already done with a communion with God communing with him that it's already done the Catholic is hoping it's done the Protestant says it's already done the Catholic is wondering if his sins Is Forgiven the Protestant is confessing that they are forgiven amen that he is free and a communion is communing with God and these articles that we take not in hopes that are sin are forgiven but they are forgiven because it's one is Hope and the other is Faith once hoping he's right and the other knows he's right the other once hoping because he don't know where he stands the other knows he's right because he knows what God Said Amen that's it that's the difference so when you're just hoping be careful but when you know then go on see then you're in communion with God Protestant is he says he's forgiven and he knows it the Catholic has mass hopes that he'll be forgiven it's just like this one is a beggar hoping that everything's all right see the other is a beggar thanking for what's already been done they're both Beggars but one's begging hoping he'll get it the other beggar knows he's got it and thank him for giving it to him now there's the difference that's communion yes sir one is uh hoping that he's forgiven the other knows he's forgiven and giving thanks for it so communion is for Christians that's born again of the spirit of God and Born Again does not necessarily mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now remember now many teach that I don't know anybody teaches it like this old brother ARG right said that night to the P pit years see but New Birth is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it I don't think see to my way of saying it see I believe that you're born again and that that's reason I do use the word baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but not to Regeneration now the Pentecostal United Pentecostal Church baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ for regeneration I don't believe that they can do it if they want to but I believe Peter said repent first water don't remit sins the Church of Christ preaches it that way but I believe that repentance Godly sorrow repent means turn around go back you miss some Mar start over again do that first and your baptism in water is only an outward profession of something that's been done inside of you that you have accepted Christ as your savior I guess it's just a church here tonight as far as I know I'm not here enough to know who does come or not I got a little criticism here not long ago on baptizing a man here in the pool an old fell and I went to him his good old man I had the privilege of leading all of his family to Christ all of them Christians this old man was a nice old man and I liked him so I went to him and I said to him Papa why don't you become a Christian he's loves me he said brother brandom I would become a Christian when I can get good enough I said tell you what you do Papa you look all around and you find where you can get good enough and tell me where that place is I want to go too amen I said Christ never come to save good man he come to save bad man amen when you think you're good then he didn't come to save you he come to save them he knows they're bad Christ died to save Sinners and I said Papa there's a line right here he said well I smoke these cigarettes I said I ain't going to even talk about them he said I'll try to give them up brother Bram I said I we ain't going to talk about cigarettes he said well when I can I said don't don't say no more about them let him go I want to ask you a question he said all right what is it I said Do you believe there is a God said certainly I believe it said I believe that is strong as you do I guess brother brandham I said do you believe that that same God crossed the stream and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ in order to save man he said yes I believe that and he died to save sinners like you are and like I am yes I believe that I said now it's just like this we're all in one big building over here and we're in jail and I can't stand over in this corner and say this will help me get out of jail I stand over in that corner say that'll help me get out of jail we're all all in the same fix and every man that was born in this world was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he's a renegade to begin with someone asked the other day he said brother brandham if would there be any difference between Adam and Eve and their children today if they were all naked walking in the would the would their bodies be the same I said no sir was coming home from a squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and a bunch of them I said no they wouldn't be the same said you mean Eve wouldn't be a woman like her daughters and Adam wouldn't be a man like his sons I said in many respects but not in all physical respects he said what would be the difference I said they wouldn't have any Naval they were created am right they wasn't attach to nothing as long as that bears there on everything that's born in this world shows it's a renegade to begin with am that's right I said sure there's a difference they would have no naor they wasn't connected to any female to come here see God created him now I said I want to say something every man in this prison house who's holy who is the one that wasn't born by sex who's one can help the other no matter what he is we're all in the same same prison but God made himself one of his creations and come Beyond sex through the Holy Blood that he created himself and through that blood he redeemed us am I said you believe that Papa he said I believe that I said Christ died for a bad man like you now there's only one way to do there's nothing you can do he offers it to you you can't Merit it nothing you can do to get it he just gives it to you will you accept what he did for you to keep you from hell he said I'll do that he said but if I could just get rid of these cigarettes I said the cigarettes will take care of their s you just I ask you I'm not a legalist I believe in grace and all the father has given me will come to me amen I said if you believe that with all your heart he said with all my heart I believe it then will you accepted on those basis that you're not worthy of it but he's the one's worthy don't look at yourself look at him cuz you can't do nothing for yourself look at the one that did something for you what about him oh he said he's worthy I said that's it then accept what he gives you he said I do and I baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ and him go out of here and light up a cigarette a few weeks ago I was down to his home place I saw a vision one night of an evergreen tree being cut down turned upside down I seen boards nailed on it right next to the last board was a notable board and down below that board right down towards the end running out like this the tree broke right there and the boy said it should have been you or it would have been you and Papa Cox fell mashed his back in here and so the next morning they brought his cigarettes to him when he was in the bed the desar had done LIF him weeks ago he's never tasted one don't even want one or nothing else see and I seen him a while ago when his hands was just Brown all over a few weeks ago with cigarettes and now I can't even stand for one to be around him put first things [Applause] first don't try to get good you're bad to begin with and nothing you can do there's a separating line and all human beings is on that side now when I was born in this world it was between a a holy wedlock between my father and mother in her womb was an egg in my father uh's glands was a blood cell my life consists of that blood cell not of my mother's a of my father's blood cell and when that blood cell went into its proper place to meet the egg when it did nature was commanded to God to give me a body and then I was then Born Into the human race I was given a opportunity to become uh intelligent person like human beings are where I could drive an automobile or I could do things like human beings do walk talk driv an automobile and so forth I was given that because I was borned into the Human family and given power of intelligence to be a human being now when I was born into the family of God I came by the blood amen the blood give me life and then after I become alive in Christ he baptized me with the Holy Ghost and Power to be a Son of God now just like I could walk talk like a human being drive my car like human being now when I receive the Holy Ghost I receive power to cast out Devils speak with new tongues preach the gospel he the sick yes I am baptized not born but baptized they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized with the Holy Ghost and power for service ging yes amen you believe unto eternal life and are borned Again by your faith Jesus said in St John 5:24 he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life not the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life he's born into the family of God and then baptized into the Holy Ghost with power of the intelligence of Faith to believe the gospel and to put it to work and make it Act Right amen amen then he acts like a Son of God then he can cast out Devils Jesus said these signs shall follow them my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpant drink the thing see he receives Power by the Holy Ghost to do these things oh praise the Lord now when he went away he says exeeding for me that I go away for if I go not away the Holy Ghost will not come see then when he comes he will reprove the world of sin and teach righteousness and show you things to come that's Visions you'll take the things that I've taught you and reveal them to you the very words that he's come no man can understand the word outside the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when a man says he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and disputes the word being right there's something wrong Paul was a Critic of the New Testament what new testament was in wrot Paul was a Critic of Christian Christianity Saul and when he received the Holy Ghost he went three years down in Asia and studied the scriptures because he was taught under Gia a great teacher then when he come back and 14 years later he went up to meet Peter at Jerusalem and found out they were word by word the same gospel the same God that had Peter to preach on the day of Pentecost and tell him to repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that same Holy Spirit reveal it to Paul and he told him in Acts 19 if the done been baptized one time but John said you have to be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see the Holy Spirit stays right straight with the scriptures faith in that unlocks every mystery amen the Bible said 1 John 5:7 there are three that bear record heaven the Father the word which was Christ and the Holy Ghost these three are one yes and there are three that bear record earth water blood spirit these three are not one but they agree in one now you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost they are one but you can't be justified without being Sanctified and he can't be Sanctified without having the Holy Ghost sanctification is by the blood through the blood comes life and the Holy Ghost is the power of God see the power given to the church you shall receive what power acts 18 after this the Holy Ghost has come upon youen you shall receive power not you'll be borned again you'll receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you are my Witnesses in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth see you receive power after you receive the Holy Ghost But first you must receive the Holy Ghost and that is the power of God see to manifest and demonstrate you're your as you was a human and learn to talk and walk and do the things a human does when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost you're given power to act as Sons and Daughters of God Amen no wonder if people act and do the way they do today they've never been filled with the Holy Ghost if they would they act different they claim they have but Jesus said by their fruits you shall know that so how can you do it you see it's just all scrupled up see but come back to the facts now if you walk upright and are claim yourself to be a Christian we invite you tonight to the table of the Lord today no doubt that communion has been taken Across the Nation some of them in one way and some in another but I think the best way to do it is follow the scriptures just the way they did it in the scriptures I think that would be sufficient do you have your Bible brother NE brother Neville will now read the scriptures in the 11th chapter of First Corinthians beginning at the 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep or if we would judge ourselves we should should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world the Lord bless the reading of his word it's always such a holy thing such a sacred thing I think we should bow our heads now in silent prayer you pray for me I'll pray for you let's pray for one another that God will be merciful to us unworthy creatures that's about to uh partake of this great Sacrament in remembrance of the death of Our Lord this prayer of confession we offer to you our father upon your golden altar with our sacrifice to Lord Jesus we ask that in his name amen I believe the elders will take their place and they'll the church and they'll bring the people up as they come row by Row for the commun I always think of that song Dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more let us bow our heads gracious and Holy Father Jehovah the great Almighty send thy blessings upon thy people as we wait forgive our sins and now we offer to you this Sacrament this wine The Grapes that's been growing and hands of ministers crush this together and it was made into wine for the cause that we're now bringing it to you for that it might represent to us the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray thee father to sanctify the wine for that purpose forgive every sin of ours and may every person that receives this wine to their body may they have health strength and salvation from you granted Lord we ask it in Jesus name amen the Bible said that when he break blad and blessed it that Take and Eat This is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and when we take these little Parcels of bread of kosha which is made on a 11 it's made by Christians it's made because that it's it represents the body of Christ we understand that that it was the Disciples of Christ day of the day of the church that took these potions and made the supper ready at the Last Supper Christ's last supper and down through the Bible it was disciples that ministered these things to the people and today they our modern day disciples our Brethren here of the church disciples at this cause to minister to the people and they will take these potions and give them to the people now when you receive this bread remember it represents the lamb long years ago when Israel's lamb was roasted over fire and was taken with bitter herbs the people had strength their shoes never wore out their clothes never come threadbear all through the Journey till they hit their Promised Land may God keep us healthy happy serving him until we reach the promised land that he's given us let us pray gracious heavenly father is I speaking tonight of that Holy Sanctified body of Our Lord in whom dwelt the fullness of the godhead when I think of that body being increased and and broken and the blood running out his back and his ribs shining through the lashes up and down his back when I think of this wrinkled beaten bread represents that it comes aresh in our hearts we lay our hearts Lord upon your altar tonight yes forgive us oh God and may this broken bread as it goes into the mouth of these thy servants may they recognize that it was your precious body that was bruised and wounded and by the stripes we are healed granted Lord sanctify this Kosh of bread to its intended purpose we ask in Jesus name amen [Music] e
