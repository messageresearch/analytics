few minutes please I like to greet every one of you in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen I thank God for this wonderful opportunity that he has given to me that I could come and be with you Saints and Minister the word of God and fellowship with you all and I thank uh my precious brother brother one for letting me come in and open his Pulpit that I could uh speak the word of God I thank him for his trust and U i' like to thank you all for letting me in God bless you am I come from a country of India and I was born in in the place called Mumbai and uh the state of Maharashtra I like to say a little bit about myself so that you would know uh who is the man that is speaking to you because uh I believe it is important to know uh to know and I was uh the first child of the family my father he was already a a minister before even I was born and uh they had no children after their marriage for three years and in India I don't know about here I know I don't know about the African countries but uh in India if a woman is a baren then U uh it's a bad thing for her they will give many bad names and they don't even want to see their face so they went through such a bad time that time but uh they were praying and asking God for children and my father ALS said that he prayed to the Lord if the Lord blesses him with the children he will give the children back to God he always said that uh while we were growing up he always said that uh I promised God that uh I will give you all to him for his service and um right from my childhood he he put that thing you know planted that seed in my heart saying that I have to serve God when when I grew up so I thank the Lord for such a Godly father and mother that God gave me in this world of course they both are not here but uh and we grew up in a in a message home message believing home and we grew up in a message believing church and this message has come firsthand to me God was gracious on my life that uh I don't have to you know didn't have to go to different denomination to come to this message but I I thank God that you know he gave me good parents that believe the truth or the message of this hour in these last days so we grew up there and uh we had a church and at the age of 14 I gave my I mean at the age of 12 I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and uh from the age of 14 I started preaching this message yeah I didn't even finish my school I used to go to school and then help my father in the ministry and I was ordained at the age of 14 and I was started I started preaching the word of God since then I have been serving our Lord Jesus Christ till today and I thank uh God for his uh grace and mercy upon my life amen and uh we are three siblings I'm the first born one of the family and brother boas as our precious brother brother one said that uh he knows my brother also and he's the second one of the family and we have sister so we are three but uh my father uh he comes from a very poor background in in in that country and uh he told us that his his mother you know took him to Bombay of the city of Mumbai when my father was 7 years old because uh he lost his father due to Witchcraft and my grandmother took him and he grew up there and literally he was on the street on the put parts of the city of Mumbai and he grew up there and he studied under the street light and uh he finished his uh 10th grade you know in those days so because he come from a very poor background he wanted to take care of the poor children and uh so he adopted four children with us so we were seven that grew up together and uh then uh we were very poor family very poor um you cannot imagine we were growing up in a house that is 10 ft length and 10 ft breath it'll be a shocking thing to you that how we find people people you know lived in that house and uh then this folk joined us little later and uh we all grew up in that house can you imagine 10 ft length and 10 ft the breadth of the house so that was the size of our house that was our bedroom living room that was our drawing room and you can call whatever it is that was the only room we had and uh bathroom they used to take our bath it's a Indian style bath we used to take water in a bucket and have a little uh jug you know that we could pour water on it on our bodies and rub soap and clean you know and pour water that's how we took our bath and our bathroom size should be about this from here to this you know very small you know just a person can stand and place a bucket in that corner that's how we grew up uh you know in that house but we had Jesus there I thank God there were prayer meetings every morning in evening we used to read our Bible every day my father was a very kind-hearted man very loving person but when it comes to God when it comes to discipline in Christian Life he really taught us you know Godly ways to walk in this world if you don't read the Bible there was no food given to us it was uh he was very strict about that because the area we lived in was very bad that place is very bad people were very bad very ungodly when even you know very evil people the people the boys that grew up with us uh many are dead maybe except for two or three you know fellas everyone is dead with sickness and they were murdered and killed things like like that suicide some had mental problems and things like that so out of that uh evil place you know God saved our lives and uh you know we came as a jewels from out out of that place and it is uh first of all I'll give the credit to the Lord Jesus Christ then my father and mother that prayed on their knees as the oldest son as the oldest son you know uh I used to hear my father praying in the night getting about 2:00 and 3:00 and he was praying was kneeling our near our heads and he used to cry raise up his hand and say Lord you have given this children and I give them back to you protect them from all evils Lord and you know I want them to serve you father that was his always that prayer because he gave the word to the Lord and when I was was 12 the Lord uh touched me and I gave my heart to the Lord and he filled me the filled me with the Holy Ghost and uh the age of 14 I started preaching and um as I was growing up in 1989 it was uh before that much before that I mean few few year months before uh I'm speaking about 1989 December but few months before the Lord spoke to my grand mother telling her that uh I have no work in Mumbai and I have a great work to be to do in in the city of Hyderabad and uh she told me that morning and I said Grandma don't tell this to anyone because uh you know uh what I will do because I didn't know my own mother tongue and uh my mother tongue is Telo and uh it's I said don't tell but by the time everyone was up she be to tell what the Lord told her in the in the in the dream so but anyhow I didn't wanted to go to the place called Hyderabad which I come from now and uh few years later a few months later the Lord begin to deal with me personally but still I you know neglected and I didn't want it to go because I didn't like because we had a church about 60 70 people they used to come and we were good you know and uh we could speak the language Hindi marati and English and uh we always U uh represented us or identified us as a as a maharashtrian you know not even a Telugu speaking people and we never knew our own language but brother and sister when God started dealing with me I really got very nervous and I didn't want it to go even the second time the Lord uh begin to deal with my heart you know the Lord showed me vision and things like that but I just neglected it because I just didn't want it to go so In December 1989 we had special meeting nearby our church about half an hour or 25 minutes drive from our place and uh our brother came from down south and they had special meetings three three days and uh we went the first day and uh we heard the sermon and we came back and we went back the second day so they started the service and they started reading you know the word of God and the preacher begin to preach and as he was preaching I was sitting like this in a corner to his right hand side and he paused in the middle of the sermon and he pointed towards me he took my name he said Brother Sam he said the Lord told me last time last night to tell you that you have no business in the city of Mumbai and uh there is a great work of God to be done in Hyderabad and um I was okay till this point but when he said this is the third time the Lord is speaking to you that really shook me he he was so specific to to tell me that this was the third time he was speaking to me so that night we went back home and next morning we spoke together you know Dad Mom everyone and uh said we have to do something we have to take decision to go to Hyderabad because was you know last night as the man of God said this is the third time and uh you know Dad said let's think about it pray and uh let's do so In December 1989 they started shifting to go to the city of Hyderabad and uh when we shifted here in 1990 March uh we totally came to Hyderabad because we shifted very slowly we had to find a house and rent first and then shift little little you know things from Mumbai and it's about 700 kilomet about roughly about 625 miles or 650 miles you know so we did that and by March 1990 we were there we we came and settled down in Hyderabad and we started uh the church you know with with our family members because we didn't know anyone and um of course my mother's side uh we had some relatives and but they were in the medanite group and uh they were going to some other denomination so uh of course we took their help to look for an house in a good area and uh they really helped us but um when we started you know it was just our family and uh we used to sing songs in Hindi and pray in Hindi preach in Hindi and uh when people used to you know uh listen to our songs and preaching neighbors people started knowing that oh there is a prayer meeting you know they do it in uh in uh in their house so people used to come people used to come and people used to you know attend for one or two weeks or three weeks and they stopped come you know coming and we used to ask them what is the problem why they don't why they uh stopped coming to church he said hey the problem is we don't understand the language you speak see that was a great question in my heart too be and that's the reason that I didn't want it to didn't want it to you know come to Hyderabad but anyhow so you know my dad used to preach a lot because uh he spoke this language a little bit and even his Telo was broken and uh it was not a very good uh language because our language is spoken very respectfully and being you know he was seven when he went to Bombay and grew up there and he lived almost his life almost so his language also was very poor compared to the people who lived there but anyhow you know we we kept going on till five six years like that and a brother helped used to help me uh in translating so because my dad was preaching a lot you know I went to other places and and preached uh this truth and um when we came to this uh place you know Andra Pradesh this state they had only seven message preachers that time but today by God's grace there are hundreds and thousands of people you know in the state of Andra Pradesh of course now the state is divided into two it's Telangana where I come from and then Andra Pradesh where my wife comes from but anyhow you know there are thousand even if you print 10,000 books at this point the books will not be sufficient so there are more than 10 12,000 uh people in the message in in Telugu speaking States so I'm really thankful to God but the thing is this uh five six years I I went around those four or five districts and I preached this truth and you know preached this message and uh the Lord was good but then the brother that used to translate for me he said uh I will not be available for you brother to translate and help you see that was my turning point and I had to come to that point because God had to you know he had to show me his power in my life he had to bring me to a reality that I was in his will and he wanted to do something from my life so I came back from a meeting with very sadness and I was I was brokenhearted brother sisters but uh you know I came and uh I told my father and mother and my wife wife and and straight away that was Thursday morning that I came from the meeting and I straight over went to the to the fasting till Sunday so I never ate anything I just kept praying and asking God you know to help me because here I I stand at a junction now and I don't know which way to take turn so I said Lord you have to do something and help me you know how I should go further what is the next uh uh step I have to put and uh you'll be surprised when I say certain thing that Sunday I woke up and you know we he got ready to the church and uh we just started singing and uh worshiping the Lord and I said this is the last Sunday we are going to sing in Hindi from next Sunday we going to sing Telugu songs so everyone was like okay and uh but they didn't know how to do it so what we used to do we used to to you know learn Telugu songs and write it in Hindi and I used to write it in English Telugu songs in English language I used to write and that is how we used to sing so I hope you understand we used because we can read and write Hindi marati and English and Telugu was something uh if I show you the language it is all circles so it's very hard to understand you know the language so but anyhow we used to write in English and some people used to write in Hindi and sing in the church in telu songs next from next time and then after the when the time came to preach I came in the Pulpit I said uh let's pray and this will be the last prayer I'll be praying in Hindi language and uh I in my prayer I said Lord I don't know what you're going to do but I came to the city on your word and I didn't want it to come and you know that but you sp spoke to me three times and and you sent me to this place so I don't know what you're going to do Lord as I said amen you as I say amen I want you to help me to speak this language and when I prayed and uh the anointing of God came so much on me brother sister and I said amen I automatically started preaching speaking in my mother tongue which is Telo that's the first time in my life [Applause] I started speaking or preaching in my own mother tongue you wouldn't believe what God did on that day and since then I I pre I started speaking in Telugu language in our church and then uh after a few months God helped me to read the language I never been to the school and uh I don't know even the letters of the alphabets and the language you know there's a there it is very tough I will show if you want how telu is written but um you know I was like a crazy fellow uh I was really crazy I would put my Hindi Bible first and then put my English Bible and I and I bought a Telugu Bible for myself and I used to put it there and I went studying several months you know these two language Bibles and this one I couldn't even understand or read anything from it but I just kept looking at that I could read Hindi Bible I could read English Bible I can understand it but this Telugu Bible nothing but one day after several months somehow I started reading yes I don't know how it happened but it happened and it happened in my life you say our God is a God of Wonders yes he is why you say Lord Brother Sam does he miracles in our lives yes he does I stand here as a miracle I started reading slowly when Brethren used to come from uh from United States we had problems with the translation and then you know my daddy literally pushed me one day he said hey you can preach now so you try to translate in in Telo you know unless you have a Telo Bible and you can read it fluently you know it's very hard to translate but I stood there I I took uh help from a brother from a church I said you read loud I when I say the scripture you open the Bible you read the scripture and then I'll speak with the preacher and I did by God's grace I can preach I can read Telo Bible and I can translate in Telo so I thank God for his mercy and that's how we started brother sister and we we started growing you know the Lord begin to help us to grow and today by God's grace um we have all together 350 people that's come to church and uh you know the Lord has been good to us and um I'm married have a wife and I have two children they both are married I got a daughter the first of the first born of the of the family her name is Sharon Rose and she's married married and uh her husband is also a doctor they both are medical doctors and I've got two grand babies Zoe and uh Isabel uh Isabelle just turned one

to help him in the work and uh he's working there and my daughter-in-law is a is a teacher in the school is because she doesn't work in a public school but she goes to a Christian School so she's a teacher in the school I I thank the Lord for for the blessing that he has given me in this life and um till my dad passed away in 2020 you know I supported him I stood with him I was the pastor of the church and we used to take care of the lepers and we used to take care of the widows we used to take care uh of the leper I mean of the orphan children and uh by God's grace even after he passed away

that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine I love this word thou art mine amen I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they should not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire Thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God and the the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and shba for Thee thank you very much God bless you as you take your seats thank you very much and uh I will continue to read verse four since thou was precious in my sight oh I love this word my brothers my sister since thou was precious in my sight thou H has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore I will therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far my daughters from the ends of the Earth I believe this prophecy has been fulfilled every even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yeah I have made him bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the de that have years let the N let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let us let them bring forth their W witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth ye are my Witnesses sayith the Lord and my servant whom I have chosen that he may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God form neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior can you say amen amen praise the Lord the word of the Lord is wonderful isn't it I would like to just title this evening um our parity complex discredits our magnanimous God we have lot of complexes in our lives think about it brothers sisters we have our insecurities you know that diminish the magnificence of our god of our God sometimes we underestimate ourselves and when we underestimate ourselves we underestimate Our God yes yes to underestimate means underrate to place too low a value on and the scriptures that we have read God said Thou Art mine yes he says I have chosen you and he said I have known you I have redeemed you he said he said I have given ransom for thee for Egypt Ethiopia and shivba and he says when thou pass through the waters I will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fires thou shallal not be burned neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee now these are the wonderful scriptures that God spoke about his children you may say Brother Sam this is for the people of Israel yes I believe that this this is a prophecy but we can apply it to our lives because we Are Spiritual Israelites and he says because thou has precious in my sight thou has been honorable and I have loved thee therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life fear not I am with thee I would like to repeat one more time fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East gather thee from the west and he'll speak to the North and South he says keep not back my sons and daughters give them up and let my daughters and sons come from the ends of the Earth so we know that God is is is trying to gather his people all over the world from east west north south people is gathering his children but I want one thing you SS to put it in your heart tonight that you belong to God and God loves you he says when you go through the waters I am with you he says when you go through the rivers they will not overflow you when you go through the fire they will not burn you because you belong to him he's our God and he's our savior that's what the Bible says 1 John 4:4 says he are of God little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that he that than he that is in the world he says the one that is in US is greater then Jeremiah 31:3 says the Lord had appeared of old to me saying yeah I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness I have drawn thee he wants to you know draw Us near to him because we are his children now Ephesians chapter 2: 10 says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them now taking all this scripture into into the account Brothers sister we are his children God is our God and he's our help in the time time of troubles present help in the time of troubles you know he has created us in Christ Jesus and uh we are his workmanship we are made by his hands and we are his children but now we live in this world this world is full of Sorrow just like the Bible says in the Book of Job chapter 14 he said the one that is born of a woman is for a short period of time and have multi itude of of problems or sorrows in their lives so you know when we look at the circumstances that we are in when we look at our sickness that we have in our bodies and we we we we think about it and you know when we when we see the situation around us or the circumstances around us and we become hopeless we think we are left without any hope and uh you know we think that uh we are no good and uh uh we under imate God and his power because we try to run Helter Skelter in our situations I would like you to just just uh think about this this uh lines that I'm reading for you from the message God's provided place of worship is a wonderful message that the prophet has spoken and I know you have already heard it and read it it says remember when God speaks a word he can never take it back now now the scriptures that we have read this is the word of God and if God has spoken a word he said he will never take it back why he has to ever remain if he has to ever remain the same he can never say something and say things that we think oh and then say well I didn't exactly mean that see he's infinite he knows the best best to begin with so because he knows the best to begin with when he speaks it is eternal and he's he's not finite like us like we say things and next we come up brother Brenham says we come back and we take those words back because we are human being but if with God he's not like that if you has spoken the word it remains there yes and it doesn't change and his word will never fail God never fails praise the Lord he says you know uh but God can do that and remain God he cannot act like us and remain like God he cannot say something today and tomorrow morning he says he wait a minute it is not the way I think you know this is the way I think and he and he you know Alters his word it doesn't happen like that the heavens and the Earth will pass away but not his word not even a jot or a title will fail the Bible says so even a jot or a title is very very important in this precious word of God he says he does not do that because he's a he's perfect in every word you believe that today he's perfect in every word he never utters a word unless it is eternal all of his eternals was with him at the beginning his thoughts his attributes and they only expressing themselves in the world today God is expressing himself God is expressing his word in this last days why because there are his people in this world he has his wife in this world we call them with different name like names like the Church of the Living God we call them bride we call them Sons and Daughters of God we call them the friends of God praise the Lord Brother sister said just think about only think about our healing sometimes you know our our bodies you know we are so sick and you know as our pastor our brother one he wrote those request and and ask your people to pray and brother sister prayer is very important in our lives today does God hear prayers yes I'm witness God hears prayers does he heal people yes he heals the people I want to show you something from the message Jehovah J just think about our healing brother sister it is only the love of our father that loves us so much that he sends his word he sends his ministers to preach the word then he sends gift into the church which is arm with his arm spread out trying to get you to believe it he sends his word he sends the preacher to you so that he could speak to you his word and he causes you to believe it he wants to heal you tonight if anybody is sick here praise the Lord if anybody's hearing this in the on the online tonight hear this word what the prophet said he said he wants to heal you tonight a thousand times more than you want to be healed thousand times more then you want to be healed but you're afraid you go by have you feel the senses in our body has Tak on our our lives and that's why we are facing defeat in our Christian work that's why we are facing you know we are being conquered by the circumstances we are being conquered by the by the situations that we are you know having around us by our Feelings by our reasonings yes I'm preaching on on on the going or looking beyond the the sense of reasoning I preached 22 parts and brothers sister it goes you know when you dig more for the word of God it you know it's like a a big uh you know what do you call it's a mind like you keep digging the word you'll find something you know great and wonderful reasoning has taken over our lives we live by our feelings sometimes I don't know about here but you ask people in India why didn't you come to when vday prayer he said oh I was not feeling good somebody say oh I have a I had a back pain oh some will say I had a headache and that's why I couldn't come some would say I was busy some would say I was with my friends we make all these kinds of lame excuses reasonings and uh our feelings have taken over our lives if you believe that say amen I get nervous when you people are silent I have known African people uh they are very Lively but you're afraid you go by how you feel because you have regarded that you lived by your feeling your whole life has been wrapped in that see it's not me it's a prophet our whole life is wrapped by the feeling that we have today don't you think brother sister when God speaks a word it's an eternal word and it is the word of God and it's not going to change if God has given us a promise is more than able to perform it well then why we need to give place to the feeling why we need to give place to the reasoning why we keep reasoning you know if the doctor said you have cancer and he will say you're not going to live now the Bible says you are healed by the stripes he had now there are two things that God has placed before you and me brother sister are you going to take you know what the doctor said or are you going to take what God Said this way you you know you will you will bring credit to God you will bring Victory to your own life what you going to take think about it brothers sisters he says our whole life has been wrapped up by our field ings by reasoning but you must get away from that and act on God's word not on what you feel not what you see but what God Said act on that make a confession of that confess means to say the same thing and he's at the right hand of the father with his own blood to make intercession for your confession whatever we confess God intercedes that and that's why brother sister we need to speak positive things we need to think positive we have to get rid of all negative stuff we need to get away from all our feelings and all our reasonings because God is greater than our feeling God is greater than our reasoning God is greater than our sickness God is greater than our circumstances God is greater than everything and because we belong to him and he is our God you can ask him you can talk to him you can confess good things and he will intercede for you amen what a God we have today let's go a little further he says now he cannot do anything for you until first you accept it and confess it and here we sometimes stand said oh brother I'm praying but I'm not getting any answer God is not hearing my prayer God is not answering my prayer I can show you one strong reason why God answer doesn't answer our prayer and that's not my word actually I can show you what the prophet said you like to hear that I'm reading a little bit from believing God this is not in my notes that I'm preaching and he says I know this that some of us has more faith than others and those who have abundance of Faith are supposed to pray for those those who don't have faith we have to pray pray for them but if you don't live the right kind of life if you don't live the right kind of life you better leave away from it he says you better stop praying if you don't live right you don't stop praying because the devil will laugh at your prayer if we don't live right and we keep praying the devil he laughs at our prayer think about it but when you live right and do right when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God Satan will tremble when you speak C God swore under obligation he would take care of that prayer the prayer when we live right and pray Satan trembles and God takes care of that prayer [Applause] prise the Lord Glory that is true yes and here we stand up here we live in this world with all inferiority complex we are so inferior sometimes we think that we are hopeless and we think about ourselves so low and the Bible is speaking something else about us he says you're mine yeah thank you Lord he says I redeemed you he said I'm with you he says the waters will not overflow you the fire will not burn you what else you want brother sister he paid for our sickness when he was hanging on the cross when he paid for our Salvation he paid for our sickness too he paid for our peace he paid for everything that we need today we have to just come with the right attitude with the right kind of life and conduct right and live right and ask believing When you pray believe that you have it you receive it and you shall have it see we need to come in the right way for the answers of our prayer and he said if we confess and if we accept yet is's the high priest you know of what you confess if you say I'm hopeless he will say yes Lord they're hopeless if you say I'm devastated he'll say yes Lord they devastated whatever you confess and here we stand and we we complained about Pastor we complained about church we complained about somebody we've complained about our husband We complain about our wife no brother it's you my sister it's you you are the problem I am the problem nobody else so let's stop this blame game let's stop it is say say he's Supernatural Hallelujah he's still a supernatural God and he can do super Natural Things yes you believe that and he was showing to Abraham he's also showing to you he's speaking about Isaac and being offered and how the father and son goes you know walk up to that mountain called morah and he and he goes uh you know on that place and he tells his servant he said hey you know you wait here me and my son will'll go up and we'll worship God and come back that's right these were his words he had so much Faith because God promised it in Isaac all the nations will be blessed so Abraham knew even if he killed him offer him to God God will rise him back again Hallelujah he knew that he was able to do it he didn't worry one bit he said he knew that God was able he had promised through Isaac he would bless the world here brother Bram stands in the in the in the prayer line in the message bam and Gilead and he's saying come reverently sister believing nothing is impossible with god father as she holds the Word of Life in her hand now this Prophet praying for that woman that was coming in the line and when she stands in front of him we know you know how God used to deal with people on the platform he said this woman is holding The Word of Life in her hand may it become real to her for her desire in Jesus name amen God bless you and he sends her away he wanted that woman to see the word of God becoming real in her life brother sister what we need today this word become a reality to us we need to come into the Realms of reality we have we have done spoken much about the word we have unspoken about you know much about the Miracles and the and the supernatural things I believe God is still able to do Supernatural thing I believe in Supernatural I believe in the third pool Ministry I have seen that happening I have seen this in my Ministry myself I've experienced it but many times we don't come to the reality brothers sisters now he looks at the other lady he said now little lady said we see your crooked limb that's probably poo and you know that God can heal that how many times I've seen him heal I prayed for a little lady here sometime ago she was so crippled she had two crutches on her two braces on and she was lying in the bed that night when they removed the crutches and the next morning her mother fainted here she comes walking across the floor normally and whole God healed her a person with a polio had two braces and two two crutches on her and her mother saw and She fainted it says God had come to the bed through the night and made her home if he can do that today yes he still can do that he said oh Lord I lay upon this young girl now he's talking to this girl and testifying what God has done to the you know to this young girl what he did with that crippled woman just to lift up her faith he says lay upon this young girl Lord she will be always always be twisted if you if you don't help her let it be for her Lord for will you I pray the sincerity of my heart with a fervent effectual prayer to thee let it be with this girl also that she will be made well through Jesus Christ's name amen bless your sister and give you what you ask for you believe it don't you then he will never fail you I'm just trying to remind you these things yes just to encourage you to have faith in God don't under underestimate yourself and by doing that you are under underestimating God's power yeah that's right God's blessings in your life if God can do in the life of uh the prophet many times you know preachers you will hear said oh God did this thing through Moses god did this thing to Joshua God did this thing through Elijah God this did this to through Paul through Peter through all the disciples you know which is true we read all those things in the Bible we also read in the message that you know God used brother Bram in our days and he used him to give eyes to the Blind and you know the lame walk and the dead raise back to life and it happened more than one two times that's right till now whatever I have spoken it's all history Brothers even brother brandham is a history we knew that God brother bram's God was alive and he's real we know that he was real but I'm talking about the God who is now July the 26th of July Wednesday you know 2106 I'm speaking of a God who is now present in our midst oh he did this through brother gram he did this through Peter he did this to to Paul we are not not serving a historical God he's the he's the same yesterday today and forever he's alive now he's in our midst what we have to do is just have faith and confess it speak the word and we will never go the same person as we came in because God is so real today brother I I want to see him in real in reality that's my desire I want to see the power of God you have heard about about that silver TI uh grizzly bear that brother Bram spoke had brother brother Eddie bisol and brother Blain with him and the vision showed him that you know there will be a silver tip Grizzly beer and brother Bram is going to shoot it and he sh the wision you know he shoot at his heart and do you know the story how brother bam explains it more than one time in the message but I've taken proof in his word he said according to the vision we going I'm going to have it and they were coming you know coming to that's a long story but just to cut short that story and you know here comes a time that they ask will you have it are you going to get it brother Bram he said the vision told me this grizzly BL bear should be somewhere else around one of the brothers said I can see 50 miles from here and I don't see that bear he said the vision said the Lord said it it's thus say the Lord if he could create a ram for Abraham he would create that grizzly bear for the prophet of God well he believed it and here he sees less than less than 500 yards he stand that gzz Grizzly you know bear and as in as the Brethren say he said brother brandom have you ever shot this he said no and the gun he had was a very small bullet he a 250 mm some small bullets he said and he said this grizzly bear doesn't know what death is so you have to be very careful brother brandham while shooting then he says in the vision I saw I shoot you know at the heart of that animal and he says as they were talking this bear looked at brother Bram and he says that's it he was getting charged to attack these people he said you know he took the gun and and and targeted it and shooted that animal and it was still charging towards them I think brother Blain say he said brother bham I didn't have I didn't wanted that animal to have it in my lab brother answer say I didn't even I don't neither want to have it in my lab he says less than 50 yard that animal fell God what he shown what he spoke to this Prophet had brought you know brought it to pass that's right he was also talking about brother brother Eddie having that checked shirt I'm just because I'm looking at the time 9:10 we have to close it's almost 9:10 10 after 9 brother one told me we have to get out from here 910 right 9 9:30 right we got 30 minutes more then or 20 give me Grace because you took 10 minutes more you gave me 10 minutes more you said 8:00 you will give me the pull pit you gave me at 810 so give me 10 10 minutes grace we'll try to let you lose by 9:30 brother sister if God has said something he's more than able to perform it I want to encourage you tonight how God loves you I'll just read one more quote of the prophet and it will go something that Lord laid it on my heart and I you know as the inspiration struck I started putting this on my notes this great warrior Joshua paragraph 46 he says have faith in God I say to you my brother my dear brother my sister the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the Living God never fails he can't fail let it sink in our heart never never don't think shadra mishak it's just a myth or a tale no it was real it is real brother sister if if he could do to them he will do it now he's more than neighbor right he can do it because you are his yes okay he can't fail what have we to look to tonight we got a leader tonight it's the second Joshua none other but uh but the Lord Jesus Christ himself the captain of the host of the Lord he's with his people he is here in power he's bringing evidence into the church proving he is the Healer you talk about our people in our church God healed cancers people are alive and they're worshiping God they're serving God people with tuberculosis God healed them you you name the disease God healed them we have seen that in our in our own eyes we have seen it Lord he's with his people he's here in power he's bringing evidence to the church by proving he's the Healer he's proving the evidence by his people he gives them the baptism of the Holy Ghost he comes down and let his picture be taken with us he's talking about the picture the the pillar of fire over his head you know we also have the picture of cloud he's doing everything that he can do to show you not to join Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal or or brandom Tabernacle but join to Jesus Christ of course we don't have denominations and he's not asking us to join brandom Tabernacle no he's asking us to join to Jesus Christ Christ believe in him everything no matter what the church you're going to that doesn't have nothing to do with it it's your heart with God what God looks at that's right believe in him as a supernatural resurrected Lord Jesus Christ God is looking into our hearts tonight it's not that where you are and how you are and which church we belong and you know how good we are and nothing like that it's your heart it's our heart that God is looking into now brother sister we are coming to the point where you know we know God we know God by scriptures and we know God by relationship with him that's right we need to we need to check our relationship with our God tonight because relationship is is very very important I know my wife more than anybody in this world includes her father or siblings whatever I know her better than anybody in this world is that right brother one you know Sister one more than anybody because of the relationship yeah because of the intimacy we have have you known Christ in your life is it just a a a savior of the world to you is it just a A Healer of the sick to you people or is he a god of Christians or is he just a Creator and so on what do you think about him we don't want assuming unbelievers to teach teach us about God we don't want to assume him we want to know him in reality with a relationship a personal relationship and when it comes to personal relationship my father's experience was not enough for me right or my mother's experience was wasn't good for me I myself had to have personal relationship with my savior glory and now I have come to a place where no power in Hell or in this world can shake me there's no power in this world that could move me from the word of God that's the kind of a relation we need today nothing can move me that's right that's how we need to know your God it's not just by intellectual you know reading or understanding the scriptures that is the problem today with the message people they have taken the intellectual part of the message and left out the life of the message life of God that's right that's right brother intellectual part is good that's right I love it but we need to have the life life that this message has has brought us to that God is required of us it's not only studying and reading and putting the Cotes in our mind come on it's the wor God in our throne and thrown on our control tower we need to know him personally oh Hallelujah we need to understand him his power personally when we underestimate God our expectation of him becomes very low we underestimate how much he loves us when we talk about God his love God's love is unconditional and it is complete his love is unconditional and complete Paul says in Romans 8 verse 38 and 39 for I persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord did you see what what all the things he said death life Angels principalities Powers nothing present nothing to come God nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able will be able to separate you my sisters my brother separate you from the love of God it is impossible for any creature whether it is death or whether it is life or Angels or principalities whatever nothing can separate us from the love of God we underestimate sometimes his power sometimes things become overwhelming at times and the enemy I want you to know the enemy isn't more powerful than God because we read the read in the Bible he that is in you is greater than that is in the world in Ephesians 610 reads like this finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might we should never underestimate his power we underestimate his plans and direction for our lives that means god did not just create us went back to his throne in heaven and he's just waiting to see you know how we are trying to make up our lives he never he never did that if you can read Psalm 139 verse 1-6 you will understand what God did after he created you he say this a Psalm of David oh Lord thou H has searched me and known me my precious brothers and sister he knows you he has searched you my sisters and he has known you thou knowest my Downs sitting my Uprising thou understand my thought a far off before the even the thought comes to your mind he already knows what you're going to think after one second he knows it brother and sister thou compassion my PO by lying laying down and art acquainted with all my ways all my ways that means there is no way that is hidden to your God there is nothing that you can hide right young children listen to me whatever you do or whatever you follow in this world remember God is watching you and you cannot hide it from him for there is not a word in my tongue but L Lord thou knowest it all together before a word come to my mouth he knows it thou Hast vised me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high I cannot attain unto it so never never underestimate his plans and his directions for our lives if he has created you he knows your future we sing that song right do we sing that song he knows my future because he lives right Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow because he lives he holds my my future yes well sometimes you only sing but you know we don't mean it that's right that's the problem with us that's right so never underestimate his plans and direction for our lives oh brother I wanted to St so many things we underestimate his mercy and forgiveness and it's tragic because many times we carry around and you know remorse from our sins that God has erased from his memory yeah I've gone through many states in America and prayed for some hundred PE hundreds of people after the sermon they used to come and pray and you know there are people some Sometimes they come and say Brother Sam my my past is hunting me my past is haunting me I told to one sister one day I said sister dear when he comes and tells you about your past take courage look into his eyes look into his faceu and tell him about his future if he tries to REM remind your past tell him his future he will never dare to come to you but you know brother sister when we underestimate him his power his Mercy his forgiveness don't underestimate devil there are more quotes that Prophet brought to us he says don't underestimate the devil don't don't try to think he's he's weak or something don't underestimate him he can do anything he said I was reading this morning many quotes he he said don't underestimate the devil never because he's powerful but we are talking about God tonight Our God never underestimate his mercy of forgiveness Psalm 103:2 says as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed my transgression from us can you see the east from here no forget about it brother Billy Paul one day he was testifying somewhere he said God put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness and he put a Playard there do not fish fishing prohibited that's how our God is yes brother this visual contrast the picture of self- condemnation of carrying our sins and regrets on our bags everywhere we go look at this visual God has put your sins and your transgressions in the sea of forgetfulness he doesn't even remember brother sister why we must remember today why we must remember our about our sisters our brothers oh he did this she did that you know why we remember those things God doesn't remember praise the Lord hallelujah he doesn't remember our sins he put it in the sea of forgetfulness you can read Romans 81 and 2 lamentation 322 and 23 speaks about compassion be you know fail it not and and brother sisters compassion is new every morning I'll give this service to the man of God many times we underestimate his compassion towards us oh God doesn't know how how I'm suffering have you heard it anytime Believers speaking to the Believers he doesn't see my suffering I'm suffering so much well he was 100% man he was 100% God but the Bible says Hebrews 4:15 we have for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin that means he knows your every Temptation he knows every weakness he knows everything so what do you have to do 1 Peter 5:7 casting all you your care upon him for he carth for you right he wants to reveal hisself to us that's his desire you can read it for yourself John 15:16 John 15:1 15:16 you can read Revelation 20 3:20 said this behold stand at the door and knock that if any man hear my voice and open the door I want to come in I will I will come into him and will suff with him and he with me he want to have Fellowship the Bible also says draw nigh to God and He will draw an nigh to you James 4:8 remember brother and sister our God is a way maker he can create not only he but his power is is lying in our hearts brother Bram said God has given us enough power today we are not lacking power but we are lacking Faith to use that power he said he has given so much power you can speak a word and create a world and step into there and live there yes think about it he wants to reveal to us because he's our maker isn't it wonderful brother sister I will close with this for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generation Psalm 100 verse five I'm closing with this remember brothers sisters you are the Masterpiece of God you are the apple of his eye you're are fearfully and wonderfully made amen you're called by your name you are the righteousness of God you are loved with everlasting love you are the dwell that he's making up you are the dwell he's making up you are God's righteousness you are you are his people and he loves you today so be strong in the word of God be strong in the power of God don't you ever look look at the situation just like Peter did when he begin to hear those boies you know wi when he saw and he begin to sink as far as his eyes was on Jesus he kept walking on the water we'll keep walking until we look at this boisterous winds and we'll thinkink it's a great harm to our lives our families and our church so let's look to Jesus tonight and look what he says about us what he thinks about us God bless you tonight and give us a service to the man of God praise the Lord Brother Sam Let's Make a Deal this is just part one okay this is just part one so whenever you come you can continue and pre and preach part two we' been having some wonderful Fellowship you know we were down in North Carolina having a meeting he was there with his brother and another brother chamson from uh IND India also so uh uh uh you know brother Tim was calling our attention so he says who are you coming with I say I'm coming with the three wise men from the [Laughter] [Music] East so I had to use that to remind him when we met I said you remember the brother that said the three coming with the three wise men from the East so uh praise the Lord but I we are very grateful tonight amen amen we can say we are very grateful for the word of the Lord amen praise the Lord you know just like I said on Sunday the greatest thing that we have to deal with in this life is our spirit our spirit has been so messed up with everything that we have gone through in this life you know I was talking about uh shame on on uh Sunday when we get down and and and start to look in that subject you'll realize that even the little child when a little child is being shamed in the wrong way it affects their Spirits so much it affects their spirit so much that if God don't help that child you see it's all of these things that make us to underestimate God it's not that we don't believe the word we read it but why are we not Rising why are we not rising to the occasion why are we not rising to the place to apply the word because there is there is this fear that lies in our spirit we don't want to make mistake we don't want to say the wrong thing we don't want to be wrong so because of that we don't even give a chance to [Music] try we want it to be right we don't give ourself a chance and with that kind of attitude you are underestimating God you are underestimating God you are not believing his word why because you are TR trying to make yourself perfect you are trying to make yourself good when you can't help yourself if he don't help [Music] you praise the lord we can be grateful and he keeps speaking his word he keep reminding us for us to be able to rise up rise up to the occation give yourself a chance give yourself a chance exercise Faith try it try it if it does not work it's not your fault you are not the master of Faith you don't have it he has it but try it give yourself a chance [Music] if we say we are believing God's word we are believing God's word and we cannot take a step of Faith then you are underestimating God you are underestimating God if you have 10,000 Cs on the hell and you believe that God can meet your need whatever your need is then you are under estimate you really don't know this God you are serving we really don't know him he said try me he's the one that said try me if I don't open the windows of Heaven he said try [Music] me praise the Lord that was beautiful tonight amen that was
