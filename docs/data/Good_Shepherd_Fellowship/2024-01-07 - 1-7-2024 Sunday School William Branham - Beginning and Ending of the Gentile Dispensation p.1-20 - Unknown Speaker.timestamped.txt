[0:58] e
[4:49] somebody that will stand by you a real
[4:52] good friend oh my in foreign lands when
[4:56] you find someone who wants to be your
[4:58] buddy and loves you and stands by you
[5:01] that's worth so much especially a
[5:04] stranger and these Brethren were taken
[5:07] away from their city and their city was
[5:08] burned and all their vessels and the
[5:12] holy things of God have been taken down
[5:14] into Babylon and was put into the
[5:17] Treasure House of King Nebuchadnezzar
[5:21] who had carried out a great grand
[5:22] Gentile King now if if God has permitted
[5:27] that for their City to be burned their
[5:30] church burned and taking them down into
[5:32] the city it was because that they had
[5:34] got away from God but he still had a
[5:37] believer that he could put his hands on
[5:39] and say this is my servant God has
[5:42] always had a witness somewhere amen he
[5:46] never leaves himself without a witness
[5:48] no matter it's got down sometime to just
[5:50] one but he's always had somebody that he
[5:53] could put his hands on and say this is
[5:55] my servant and he'll do as I tell him
[5:58] now we like that noticing then that when
[6:02] these Brethren were down there they were
[6:04] put to a test very beautiful example of
[6:09] what a True Believer comes to when he
[6:12] really accepts the Lord Jesus as his
[6:15] savior he's always put to a test amen
[6:18] Satan still in the testing business and
[6:22] it only comes about to help you it's for
[6:26] your good amen every son that cometh to
[6:28] God must be tried chasen scorched and
[6:33] other words give a little threshing
[6:34] straighten it up and if God gives us
[6:36] some chastisement and we can't stand it
[6:39] then we become illegitimate children and
[6:42] not the children of God now a man that's
[6:44] really got his face set towards heaven
[6:47] no matter what takes place here on Earth
[6:49] he still got his face set towards heaven
[6:53] his friends May forsake Him his family
[6:56] may forsake Him his Pastor May forsake
[6:59] Him but there's one that won't forsake
[7:01] Him that's God and when your mind is
[7:05] made up I like that Daniel had burned
[7:08] all the bridges behind him he wasn't
[7:11] planning on going back anymore amen he
[7:13] wasn't watching his back Trail he was
[7:15] looking forsaking those things which are
[7:18] in the past he pressed on to the mark of
[7:21] the High Calling that's what we should
[7:23] be doing that's what the church should
[7:25] be doing and as I noticed then God God
[7:30] permitted Satan to give him the test and
[7:32] all they tested him by the fire they
[7:35] tested him also by the lons then and in
[7:38] every instant God brought them out more
[7:41] than Victorious many are the
[7:44] testings of the righteous but God
[7:48] deliver him out of them all amen how
[7:51] marvelous that is how we appreciate that
[7:54] trials tribulations tests all working
[7:58] for the the good amen after a while God
[8:02] can see then and he can put his trust in
[8:04] you and then he'll do great things for
[8:07] you now we find out then that Daniel
[8:10] became an instrument in the hand of God
[8:13] while he was away from his own people
[8:16] out of his own City away from his own
[8:19] church in a Strange Land God used him
[8:23] now you can be away from whatever you
[8:26] may be you can be away from all your
[8:29] love Lov ones or you can be away from
[8:30] your church but you can still be an
[8:33] instrument in the hands of God God can
[8:36] use you for our testimony or for
[8:38] anything that he wishes to use you
[8:41] for beautiful examples the Bible's just
[8:44] so chug full of those things everywhere
[8:47] you turn don't you love to read the word
[8:50] oh I just read it sometime and week here
[8:53] a few days ago I was reading in the room
[8:55] there and I just had to sit down and cry
[8:58] like a baby
[8:59] I got up and walked around my chair put
[9:01] my hand on my chair looked down my Bible
[9:03] again I just broke out went around the
[9:05] chair again looked back at it again I
[9:06] thought oh God in there is eternal life
[9:11] amen to every man or woman that'll dare
[9:14] to put their trust in it and believe it
[9:17] eternal
[9:18] life and he said search the scriptures
[9:22] for in them you think you have eternal
[9:25] life and they are they which testify of
[9:28] me yes search the scripture the word of
[9:32] God is a lamp unto our feet that we if
[9:35] we should be guided then it's the light
[9:38] that follows the pathway that leads us
[9:41] from Victory onto Victory am now before
[9:45] you can have a victory there has to be a
[9:48] battle and if there's no battles there's
[9:50] no victories so we are to be thankful
[9:53] for the battles and the trying it's God
[9:56] giving us the opportunity to have
[9:59] victories oh my don't that make it a
[10:01] little bit better now see the battle
[10:04] come along somebody saying something bad
[10:06] about you sickness come on to you maybe
[10:08] God give you those light afflictions
[10:10] that he might heal you and show his
[10:13] favor to you let you see what he means
[10:15] about he loves you amen the old Shepherd
[10:19] story that was told there in Jerusalem
[10:21] in the Holy lands of the sheep but is
[10:24] packing a a sheep and he said what you
[10:27] packing it for say it's got a broken leg
[10:29] said how to do that fall over cliff said
[10:31] no I broke its leg he said well you're a
[10:34] cruel Shepherd to break that sheep's leg
[10:36] said no I loved it and said it was going
[10:38] astray and I couldn't make it mind me so
[10:40] I broke its leg so I could give it some
[10:43] extra tension so then it would love me
[10:45] and follow me sometime God has to let us
[10:48] break down just a little bit in health
[10:50] to give us a little extra tension to get
[10:53] us up on his lap to wo us up in his
[10:56] bosom when the doctor said nothing can
[10:58] be done then he take us into his bosom
[11:00] say see I love you I'm going to let you
[11:03] get well oh doesn't that just make life
[11:06] a little better amen oh he's so great
[11:09] he's a marvelous Shepherd isn't he no
[11:12] wonder David said the Lord is my
[11:15] shepherd I shall not
[11:17] want how he leads us for the side of the
[11:20] Still Waters and restores her soul and
[11:23] runs our cups over and and anoints us in
[11:26] the presence of the enemy did you ever
[11:28] get anointed in the presence of your
[11:30] enemy just to testify to your cup just
[11:33] borrowed over you know just how
[11:36] marvelous it is to be anointed in the
[11:39] presence of your enemy now notice then
[11:45] God took King
[11:47] Nebuchadnezzar and made him a tool in
[11:50] his hand and when King Nebuchadnezzar
[11:53] died after he had the grass grew out he
[11:57] haired like lion like eagle
[11:59] feathers and his fingernails like the
[12:01] claws of the eagle and so forth and God
[12:05] had to let him know who was the real
[12:07] king after his death Belta seure his
[12:10] grandson s succeeded him and then he was
[12:14] more wicked than King Nebuchadnezzar and
[12:17] one night there they had a great big
[12:19] party they called all their their
[12:22] maestrat and all the officers in for our
[12:25] great big
[12:27] jamere and while they were having this
[12:30] jamere and they were went and called out
[12:34] and Tuck the vessels the holy vessels of
[12:37] God just to make fun of God and drink
[12:41] wine to their gods a toast out of the
[12:44] vessels of the
[12:46] Lord now a man is permitted to travel so
[12:51] far but there's a separating line
[12:54] between life and death you must never
[12:57] cross that
[12:59] see you can go on with your little
[13:01] foolishness for a while but you better
[13:03] know where the line is did the Lord ever
[13:06] check you on anything he does all of us
[13:10] pull the check ring say that's far
[13:11] enough now then you better watch what
[13:13] you're doing from that
[13:15] on if you're stepping across towards
[13:17] that line and that night when God pull
[13:20] the check greins on him and he wouldn't
[13:22] listen goes on down and brings out the
[13:24] vessels of the Lord begin to drink W
[13:27] wine and them toast
[13:29] to their gods then there came a hand
[13:32] down out of heaven and wrote on the wall
[13:34] teeny teeny tech praia means th we in
[13:37] the boun and found wanting no one could
[13:40] interpret it it was unknown tongues and
[13:44] there was a man there had the gift of
[13:46] interpretation Daniel so he comes down
[13:50] and interprets and tells the king what
[13:52] would happened and there God destroyed
[13:57] that Nation
[13:59] amen
[14:00] Babylon while Daniel being there he saw
[14:04] great visions and
[14:06] wrote concerning them for this great
[14:10] consolation that we have today knowing
[14:13] and setting in order the end of the
[14:16] Gentile Kingdom amen notice how perfect
[14:21] just get it close now he's seen first
[14:25] the image standing in the field when he
[14:27] interpret the dream of the king he was a
[14:30] spiritual man he dreamed dreams saw
[14:33] Visions interpret dreams God was with
[14:37] him and everyone knew that too and when
[14:41] he saw the vision the head of gold and
[14:44] the breast chair of silver and the
[14:47] thighs of brass and the feet of iron
[14:50] notice each kingdom got a little harder
[14:54] King Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was a head
[14:56] of gold he interpreted told him just
[14:59] exactly how those kingdoms would succeed
[15:03] each other unto the end then notice from
[15:07] gold is the softest silver is next then
[15:11] brass is next then iron is next harder
[15:16] harder colder farther
[15:19] away
[15:20] notice then in the midst of all that
[15:24] Daniel beheld the image until a storm
[15:26] would shoot out of the mountain that was
[15:28] cut out without hands it rolled into the
[15:31] image and broke it and made it like
[15:34] wheat on the summer flash thrashing
[15:36] floor and the Winds Drive away and the
[15:40] stone grew into a great Mountain that
[15:42] covered all the earth and the sea that
[15:45] was the coming of the Lord Jesus which
[15:47] is now at hand amen he goes on when he
[15:51] was down by the river one day he fell
[15:53] into a trance and saw a vision many of
[15:56] those was with him they didn't see the
[15:58] vision for it was given only to
[16:01] Daniel you see it someone can stand
[16:06] right next to you and see things that
[16:08] you can't see to save your life right
[16:12] someone said I don't believe that I
[16:13] never seen nothing because it wasn't for
[16:16] you to see it
[16:17] amen then it went with Paul when Paul
[16:21] was struck off of his hearts and had to
[16:23] fall onto the dirt and water as it was
[16:27] on the dirt none of them heard that
[16:29] voice or seen that Vision Paul saw it
[16:33] none of them saw the star of the cross
[16:36] the every Observatory but the wise man
[16:40] many things that way God has designated
[16:42] for certain peoples to see and others
[16:45] cannot see
[16:46] amen oh I love that when God in his
[16:51] infant
[16:53] wisdom has predestinated or for ordained
[16:56] for certain things to happen it can
[16:58] happen to the person sitting right next
[17:00] to you and you'll know nothing about it
[17:02] amen amen look at dolin when Elijah was
[17:06] down at dolin and there was all
[17:08] surrounded there by the by the aliens
[17:12] that come in the Syrian Army looking for
[17:16] Elijah the
[17:18] prophet for when they begin to find out
[17:21] every time the syrians had come over to
[17:23] Israel to make war why the Israelites
[17:27] would be laying
[17:29] for and so the king of Syria called him
[17:32] up and said now wait a minute who is for
[17:34] us and who's for Israel said somebody in
[17:38] my group is a spy that's going to tell
[17:41] Israel just where we're coming in at for
[17:44] they're always there waiting for us and
[17:47] one man had a little spirituality about
[17:49] him he said nay my father but it's a
[17:52] Prophet Elijah amen for he knows in his
[17:56] bedroom what you're going to make your
[17:58] move next amen
[18:01] amen oh when Atomic Powers begin to
[18:05] shake I'm so happy that the word of God
[18:07] has tell us where to go
[18:09] to flee to the Rock Christ Jesus every
[18:14] man in it is safe and secured nothing
[18:18] can harm you no atomic bombs no Cobalts
[18:21] nothing else can touch the preserved of
[18:24] God Amen safe secure anchored what a
[18:29] marvelous hope amen that we have in
[18:31] Christ
