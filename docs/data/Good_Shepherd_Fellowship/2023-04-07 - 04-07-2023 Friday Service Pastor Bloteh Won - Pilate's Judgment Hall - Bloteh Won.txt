we pray the Lord you will just come father bless your word now to our household father in Jesus name we pray amen [Music] let's just read the scripture here tonight I was going to read Isaiah chapter 53 but uh you can we can all read it when we when we get home let's just read Matthew chapter 27 just want to go into uh just a little thought that I had on my on my on my heart tonight and before we can go into praying Matthew chapter 27 many years years back whenever I will I would choose to to spend some time with the Lord that will want to just find a place praying or maybe go away that for a couple of days in facts and praying I will always tell the brothers I'm going to Pilot judgment Hall so tonight I want to speak a little bit on pilot judgment Hall Matthew chapter 27 let's just read verse 1 and 2. when the morning was come all the chief priests and the others or the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death now chapter 26 will let us to know that he spent the whole night Jesus spent the whole night before the council praise the Lord he spent the whole night before the council this was the religious Council and there was the night where the Bible says all the disciples denied him they left him alone so the picture that I want us to create in our mind tonight Jesus was forsaken right in the church the first night of judgment was with the Council of the others the sahitrans council the herodians all of those people that have different forms of belief United together to crucify him so the Bible says when the morning was come all the chief priests and the others of the people took counsel together took counsel against Jesus to put him to death and when they abound him they led him away and deliver him to Pontius polish the governor verse 11. and Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying Adele the king of the Jews and Jesus said unto him thou safe praise the Lord and when all and when he was accused of the chief priests in the others he answered nothing then say a pilot unto him eurodel net how many things the witness against they and and he answered him to never a word in so much they are the governor Marvel greatly praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seed I read a quote here from Brother Branham what will we do with Jesus called the Christ praise the Lord you think about it now he was first brought before the council that is the religious people those are the people that will represent the church and they spend the whole night when right in the Amaze they have Lazarus that was Raising from the dead they had another era Jairus whose daughter was also raising from the dead praise the Lord the heart of blind man Blind by Timbers that have just received his sight when he cried out son of David have mercy for me and how all of these things but even this Council they testify that for none of these good works we are crucified him but him being the man called himself God praise the Lord when right in their own hands they were holding the Torah yes they were holding the Torah where Moses said the Lord your God will raise up a prophet like unto me and David said this that the word of the Lord come unto the prophet called them gods amen praise the Lord before he will be taken to pilate to be judged before he would get to Pilot Hall to be Jewish because the same year is there before the council you will see one lady told period are you now one of them now the the people who come but before pilot judgment Hall it was only the elders and the chief the people were left out now John says in his gospel if there was a recording of everything that Jesus did we would not have a book many of those people that came over told the the is is the front the front porch of the the synagoguese where Jesus was judged many of those people that came and spent all of that night up looking at our Lord being ridiculed some of them were healed in his meetings praise the Lord some of them were healed Jesus really never needed to lay his hands on the sink for the sake to be healed if if the shadow of Peter could heal the sake in the book of Acts you think about it how many neighborhoods that Jesus passed and a sick person lying in the bed receive their healing praise the Lord if in our day the angel of the Lord can visit the neighborhood and heal those two women how much more in a day when our Lord himself was upon the Earth many of them benefited from his ministry but yet that evening before their Council they could not say a word praise the Lord brother Branham taught a story and we spoke about his year when we were talking about uh Mary Magdalene vertebraham told a story then and uh uh uh and you you can find that in uh the prince of the House of David where he says uh it was only that woman that Jesus cast out seven demons out of her Bert says she was the only one that said what have he done only heal your sake yeah praise the Lord and the prophet of God said to shut her out of the heart even the ones that stole before him even the ones that said we will give our life they were all right in the council that evening praise the Lord you see they give us a picture tonight that I mean you can be radical and run into uh into the street and challenge your people to force them to to uh to receive the Lord and you could be stoned and and I mean you could be killed and many people try to do there to to equate themselves or amount themselves onto the persecution of Stephen oh it takes some kind of a glory for being persecuted for the word but as we were just read tonight brother Brandon will say if you were there that night if you were there that night he led us to know that our actions today tells us praise the Lord if we are so shy to testify of him if we were there that night you won't say a word even the man that were eyewitnesses praise the Lord they asked too bad and they were hoping that he will be able to throw some kind of for Magic or he would just do something Supernatural they were they were just hoping but it could never come to the defense of the word praise the Lord that was the council that was the church those were the religious people yes they all agree with the council now when brother Baron preached this message what would I do with Jesus called the Christ he says honor the inspiration of this message that's where he got his indictment from he says I will enact this generation of crucifying Jesus because both the church and the state did unite to crucify the world and now the church and the state allowing all the gay rights and allowing every abominable faith I will tell you that it used to be that when we come to a weekend like Good Friday weekend you could feel it but if you don't look on your calendar this weekend can pass by and you never even know yes that is a good Friday weekend on a good Friday weekend they will close schools because it was a good Friday weekend says CLS let me read yeah so we can get to praying he says now I believe that the hour where I was saying starts it's a long about daylight in Pilot judgment Hall and it's one of the saddest time praise the Lord one of the saddest time and one of the most crucial time of all history praise the Lord I was thinking about this the Book of Joshua recall that when Joshua told the song to stand still the Bible says there were never a day like that day praise the Lord but I would say that this day amen was even greater than the day when Joshua stood this through the song to stand still because this day the son refused to give its light even Joshua could not turn it tell it to stand still because the Creator was hanging between the Heaven and the Earth one of the most crucial time of all history it was the saddest mistake the church ever made in his history they had just made it and now is being thrown into the lap of the governor the state both church and state because they were a people choosing of God he called to be his seventh and the nation was supposed to be control by God's Lord that does that just now look like what America was supposed to be control by God's Lord praise the Lord so what I want us to do tonight before we pray even though if we were there they wouldn't have allowed us to come in we were all going to just stop at the temple sign we could go on the temple porch and washed away they were disgrace in our Lord praise the Lord what a sight that they had that night to hide the god of Heaven and Earth in their hands praise the Lord what I want for us to take a kind of an imaginary trait tonight to imagine what was it like being on pilot judgment Hall the Bible says even pilate Marvel that everything they were saying about the Lord Jesus he opened not his mouth praise the Lord amen that's the greatest miracle that a man will be falsely accused can you open not his mouth oh may God help us praise the Lord may God help us sometimes they are just times where you cannot defend yourself no matter what you say praise the Lord amen no matter what you say they still will not believe then let God come to your defense but let's take it imagine every trip tonight but I'm sharing in another series of the same message he says we stand in a similar tribe this morning the word over a Triad all denomination has turned down the word I know they sound very harsh and I want the ministers who are listening yeah present and those on tape also to try to understand this now praise the Lord you see even with the religious word it's easy to keep a historical Jesus on our mind and yet reject the word yeah praise the Lord as the religious word it's all all celebrating Good Friday Palm Sunday Easter all that is on your mind is a historical 2 000 years ago Jesus that's what they are having on your mind but the word may flesh right before us the word the present their word they are crucifying that word praise the Lord and that's word our challenge is tonight as bride of Jesus Christ as people that have received the message of the hour amen we can stand for the message and create a picture in our mind and love the prophet but we have to line up with what he says remember brother Branham said and I said over the bride's Revival is to stay in line with the word amen that's the bride's Revival if now we will take the very quotes of the message crucified the Lord are French give ourselves reasons why we must do things praise the Lord just like some are giving himself reason why they think brother Branham is wrong but let's go ahead tonight but I'm holding my point and making my point here and saying that we are standing tonight in another pilot Joshua Hall you say if I did house two there I've been have spoke out for Jesus and well what are you doing about it now that's the thing see no matter how much the church had turned him down I didn't have stool by his side you have got the opportunity they turned him down praise the Lord it's so easy to live in an imaginary world it's just so easy well if it was me well if I was there for right now right here tonight praise the Lord the biggest issue on pilot judgment Hall is their brother Branham said pilate knew that he had Jesus on his hands if we were some of the entire judgment he knew that he had Jesus on his hands spoke a little bit about that on Sunday he was a very young governor was a young man and he was sent to to Judea to acquire the uprising because all of this firm of Jesus has gone to Rome you have to remember at his birth the wise man came and said where is he born King of the Jews so Rome actually sent him for him to put a stop for him to make sure that he quieted all the uprising that was happening praise the Lord because Jesus when he feel the thousands by just a few loaves of bread and fish the Bible says five thousands are one time everyone that were there that ahead of the food went testifying I saw it there was no food and all of these things was creating a concern to Rome so now pilate have Jesus on his hands praise the Lord the council is trying to get rid of Jesus off of their hands and they are placing it on pilot hands praise the Lord and pilate is now looking for who hangs also that he's going to pass it praise the Lord and if you just read the entire chapter you'll see that that Jesus was throwing no no sense of looking for Pilots sympathy doing praise the Lord he said you have no Authority but what my father has given you he said for this hours I was born that's the reason why I came into the world praise the Lord now with the the religious word rejecting him the political word rejecting him my question tonight before we go into prayer what are we doing with this Jesus what are we doing Good Shepherd Fellowship with this Jesus praise the Lord what are we doing with this Jesus that is revealed to us through a Ministry that God will give us the privilege and bring us in contact and open our understanding and give you the grace praise the Lord what are you really believing or you are faking it but you know that the one thing about this message praise the lord it's not a message of a man's idea it's a message that was given to God's Prophet brother Brandon yes sir praise the Lord what are we doing with this Jesus that we call the message praise the Lord why do we call the master brother Brian said what is the seal he said it's Christ what is the message it's not the dress code [Music] it's not the name of the church is Christ what are we doing is this Jesus we called the message I read one of my favorite scripture to you and then I will close it's supposed to be a prayer meeting now the preaching service tonight I thought we would just we prayed and then or we just sing some songs and just praise the Lord tonight one of my favorite scripture I was I was there on Monday night over in Springfield with Wesley and sister carra they send their greetings we had a good prayer meeting and were able to do a community service for them and and I used this scripture speaking to them then first John chapter one I hope that the law will be able to just give us an atmosphere here tonight amen where we can just enter into his presence with Thanksgiving first John chapter one let's read verse 5. first John chapter 1 verse 5. this then is the message this AIDS the message people this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all praise the Lord if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lied and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light praise the Lord brother Brandon says walk in the light and more will unfold praise the Lord if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin praise the Lord now you see that uh John used this statement this is the message that we have heard from the beginning and he brought it in a way to make us to understand that John is saying that wish was from the beginning that we handle with our hands amen you go back to verse one that's where he said that that wish was from the beginning which we have heard what was from the beginning in the beginning was the word that's right that's right the word was with God he says wish we have heard we heard our word from the beginning wish our eyes have seen we've seen it with our eyes which we have looked upon and we have handled the word of life so John is connecting the logos with Christ with Jesus amen and that's what he's calling the message yes this is the message for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that internal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and her declare we unto you that you're also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ this then is the message so what are we doing with this Jesus we called the message praise the Lord that's what John is making us to see you he says that word from the beginning we handle and we want you also to come into Fellowship not just to hear it but for you to get the same kind of fulfilling the same kind of a fellowship just like we had praise the Lord now you have to realize that John is saying this after his experience on the island of Patmos After experiencing Jesus Ministry in a higher form than when he was with them so John is saying that we can get even more better Fellowship than if Jesus was in a corporate body right hear me he's saying that we can get a touch we can feel him we can hear from him we can speak to him he can speak back to us praise the Lord let me tell you people that this is what the message brought to us praise the Lord do you remember just like in the time of Samia when the Bible says after Israel has gone through such a dark period of time of the judges there was no opinion praise the Lord since the time of Joshua there was no open Vision in a sense there no one really experienced that Ministry of hearing the voice of God until that day when God spoke to little Samuel once again the voice of God has returned among the people praise the Lord what we have on our hands is almighty God what we have on our hands we call the message of the hour is the very word that created us it's a very word that knows our needs is the very word they have the answer to our problems yes that's the reason why the prophet of God says take a promise he says take a talking let the talking goes before your prayers praise the Lord how God being so mindful of us knowing that we will be in such a troubled age everything that would be happening around us and yet he came our way just like their Widow woman flower in her last boy praise the Lord why the whole land was going on a farming there was a widow woman spirit in new season amen praise the Lord I will tell you Saints if we really get into the message we really get into the word we will have less things to worry about because our our answers is not going to come from anywhere else praise the Lord is going to come right from in the word of God praise the Lord musicians you can come up what will we do with this word on our hands let's sing that chorus week we sang before the word of God is on our way the word of God [Music] 's the word of God is on our hands what will we do we fear sense of faith can you change this last word what will we do with it to him why would we do with him yes the word
