[59:10] and i appreciate the anointing that we
[59:12] feel and the presence of god that we
[59:14] feel
[59:15] knowing that according to the bible and
[59:18] according to the scripture that has been
[59:19] recorded us many years ago
[59:22] where two and three are gathered he
[59:23] promised to be right here
[59:25] and i believe that i believe he's here
[59:26] right now this very moment i believe the
[59:28] lord jesus
[59:29] is right here in the house and i've got
[59:31] confidence
[59:32] i want to tell you something i've got
[59:34] confidence that not only does he love
[59:36] us not only does he concern for us not
[59:39] only does he watch over
[59:40] every detail in our lives but he is
[59:43] interested in the affairs of your life
[59:46] right now yes right now he is
[59:50] interested in you that's right yeah
[59:53] doesn't matter whether you're older
[59:54] younger no matter what your age is
[59:56] no matter how long you've been in the
[59:58] truth well i i've just come in well it
[1:00:00] don't matter to jesus
[1:00:01] he is interested in those that are
[1:00:04] interested in him
[1:00:05] i've been saying this for a little while
[1:00:07] now i told somebody the other day i said
[1:00:08] you know
[1:00:09] people have got in their mind that they
[1:00:11] want to get the attention of the lord
[1:00:13] that what they should do is be the worst
[1:00:15] boy and the worst girl they can possibly
[1:00:17] be
[1:00:18] they think maybe that if i'm bad enough
[1:00:20] maybe i'll get god's attention
[1:00:22] and i made a statement to somebody i
[1:00:23] said look i said really
[1:00:25] according to what brother bram taught us
[1:00:27] if you want to get god's attention
[1:00:29] he told us about it in a message called
[1:00:31] he cares do you care
[1:00:33] if you want to get god's attention just
[1:00:35] show him that you care about the things
[1:00:37] of god
[1:00:38] show him you care about the word show
[1:00:39] him you care about the people of god
[1:00:41] about church about
[1:00:42] loving one another amen hallelujah
[1:00:46] just show that heart and watch and see
[1:00:48] if the lord don't reciprocate right back
[1:00:49] around
[1:00:50] come right back around that and start
[1:00:52] answering back the more you show your
[1:00:54] concern watch and see if he don't show
[1:00:56] it right back
[1:00:57] amen isn't that wonderful amen we love
[1:01:00] the lord
[1:01:00] all right we want to invite samantha to
[1:01:02] come if she will and we're going to sing
[1:01:03] a little bit
[1:01:04] and get right into the preaching of the
[1:01:05] word of the lord amen we appreciate all
[1:01:08] that good singing and
[1:01:09] and uh sam and i've done decided
[1:01:13] if our suitcases are big enough they
[1:01:15] ain't we're gonna get one and
[1:01:16] big enough to put him in it take us with
[1:01:19] him
[1:01:20] take us with him you know and amen and
[1:01:22] go on about our business we
[1:01:24] we need that on the road brother
[1:01:27] i like that i like that good fiery
[1:01:29] singing like that
[1:01:31] and um you know many some years ago when
[1:01:34] i first made my
[1:01:35] my first trip over to ghana there was
[1:01:38] something about
[1:01:39] the people there the country something
[1:01:41] about the trip going over that direction
[1:01:43] it just seemed like it just was so
[1:01:45] so very special to me and uh you know
[1:01:49] now you may not know it if you're not
[1:01:50] familiar with ghana now some of you may
[1:01:52] be some you may not be
[1:01:54] but uh there's a little sound in the
[1:01:57] voice of a ghanaian singing
[1:01:59] and i can close my eyes and pick out
[1:02:00] what country they're from it don't
[1:02:02] matter
[1:02:02] amen amen no matter how tall or skinny
[1:02:05] or whatever they might be i can pick
[1:02:07] that sound that oh that sounds so good
[1:02:09] to me
[1:02:11] i just love that and it made me think of
[1:02:13] the great meetings we had out there in
[1:02:15] that country like that and
[1:02:16] so appreciate the lord and appreciate
[1:02:18] all that god does for his children
[1:02:20] everywhere and
[1:02:21] you know it's uh nice to meet people of
[1:02:23] different walks of life and
[1:02:24] their little nuances and different ways
[1:02:27] and oddities and things like that it
[1:02:28] just makes it that much more special you
[1:02:30] know
[1:02:31] i never will forget the first time i
[1:02:33] went to nicaragua and it was in central
[1:02:34] america if you don't know where
[1:02:35] nicaragua was at
[1:02:36] and uh entering into the country i've
[1:02:38] never seen people worship like this they
[1:02:40] all stood to their feet they gripped the
[1:02:42] front of the bench they cocked their
[1:02:43] heads sideways like this closed their
[1:02:45] eyes and sang in worship all of them did
[1:02:46] just the same thing
[1:02:48] and i remember looking at that thinking
[1:02:49] how unique that was and how different
[1:02:51] that was and it just seemed like it
[1:02:53] made such a deep impression on me and
[1:02:55] then i went to another place you know
[1:02:56] and it kind of more of a
[1:02:58] german type way you know anything about
[1:02:59] the germans are real you know like
[1:03:01] everything's just
[1:03:02] exactly you know cut the corner and
[1:03:03] everything's just so so and
[1:03:05] when they stand they stand like one
[1:03:07] people you know they're standing they
[1:03:08] stand like one person
[1:03:10] and uh and i never forget their worship
[1:03:12] just very organized amen i thought
[1:03:15] i thought well you know that but that
[1:03:16] was their way then i read brother
[1:03:18] branham say that god is a god of variety
[1:03:22] he has white flowers black flowers green
[1:03:24] flowers purple flowers he said he loves
[1:03:27] big hills small hills and different
[1:03:29] things he said he likes it that way
[1:03:32] amen i like that i like that so we
[1:03:35] appreciate the lord appreciate all that
[1:03:37] you've done
[1:03:37] in the meeting thus far to put your
[1:03:39] little licks of fire forward and it
[1:03:40] really
[1:03:40] means a lot to us and i want to extend a
[1:03:43] special thank you to the carlins they

[1:06:33] the side but i've been a full-time
[1:06:34] preacher for 17 years
[1:06:36] and uh and i and now that i said the
[1:06:38] worst thing the devil could have done
[1:06:40] back in february was give me antibodies
[1:06:44] amen because i've blown the schedule up
[1:06:46] and i'm right back out there just as
[1:06:47] hard as i can go

[1:06:54] vaccinated amen i
[1:06:56] i'm right to my eyeballs with antibodies

[1:06:59] we um uh want you to pray about those
[1:07:01] things if you would that the lord would
[1:07:02] help us in it now that's not a
[1:07:03] solicitation for money now but i
[1:07:05] i want your prayers that the lord help
[1:07:07] us and uh somebody asked me here not too
[1:07:09] long ago brother ben i don't know how in
[1:07:11] the world
[1:07:12] you do it and i got to think and i
[1:07:13] thought well how long have i went what
[1:07:16] have i done and all that and i counted
[1:07:17] up
[1:07:18] an average of the miles already 17 years
[1:07:21] two over over two million miles for the
[1:07:24] lord that's just on the ground traveling
[1:07:26] on the
[1:07:26] in the vans and things like that it's
[1:07:28] not even counting in the air and what
[1:07:29] we've done overseas and traveling in
[1:07:30] places like that
[1:07:32] 2 million miles in 17 years and i
[1:07:34] thought no wonder i feel beat up
[1:07:36] like an old rickety car but you know
[1:07:39] somebody asked me well how do you do it
[1:07:40] like that
[1:07:41] it's the prayers of the people of god
[1:07:43] and me coming to little churches like
[1:07:45] this and asking you to pray i know
[1:07:47] that's what keeps us going and keeps us
[1:07:48] put one foot in front of the other
[1:07:50] so will you pray for us will you raise
[1:07:51] your hand if you will god bless you
[1:07:53] thank you for that
[1:07:54] amen now what i've done is i took a
[1:07:56] snapshot in my brain

[1:23:45] back but lord

[1:23:49] word to our hearts
[1:23:51] lord it be more than just the pages of a
[1:23:53] book turning but lord it would be
[1:23:55] revelation by the spirit of god
[1:23:57] we pray that you'll come into this place
[1:23:59] tonight and anoint me as your servant
[1:24:01] lord as your son standing here i am
[1:24:04] under
[1:24:04] authority of the spirit of god to speak

[1:24:11] tonight
[1:24:12] lord as they set there is the people of
[1:24:14] god their hearts are open
[1:24:16] they are duty bound by the holy spirit
[1:24:19] to stay
[1:24:19] faithful hallelujah to every word that
[1:24:22] comes out of the mouth of god
[1:24:24] so anoint us together tonight lord that
[1:24:26] we might be benefited by
[1:24:28] this gathering together don't let it be
[1:24:30] a protractive meeting first lord don't
[1:24:32] let it be just something we come
[1:24:33] together for the sake of coming
[1:24:34] let us change walk out of here change
[1:24:36] people order
[1:24:38] different in some way lord do something
[1:24:40] in our lives to
[1:24:41] help us draw closer to you we pray
[1:24:43] forgive us o god of our shortcomings
[1:24:46] lord before i even preach this message i
[1:24:48] already know lord there'll be
[1:24:49] little places in our lives about prayer
[1:24:51] and things that we all know we lack in
[1:24:53] but lord we're not looking at that lack
[1:24:55] tonight
[1:24:56] we don't want to focus there but we want
[1:24:57] you to come and help us know
[1:24:59] how to build ourself up to be a better
[1:25:01] christian so we commit this to you now
[1:25:03] for all things in the name of jesus
[1:25:05] christ amen
[1:25:07] and amen and amen and amen god bless you
[1:25:10] may be seated
[1:25:11] may the lord bless you real real good
[1:25:12] amen appreciate the lord
[1:25:15] and appreciate god's grace and uh so
[1:25:17] appreciate all these musicians tonight
[1:25:19] and all this good singing you know i
[1:25:21] could go on like this all night
[1:25:24] i really could i enjoy it but you know
[1:25:27] the holy spirit
[1:25:28] has constrained us that when we come in
[1:25:31] we are
[1:25:31] to read his bible and to talk about the
[1:25:34] things of god
[1:25:35] because the scripture teaches us that it
[1:25:37] is by the preaching of the gospel
[1:25:39] that we are edified and we are benefited
[1:25:42] by
[1:25:43] the holy spirit as we know the holy
[1:25:45] spirit uses the fivefold ministry to
[1:25:47] edify the body
[1:25:49] of jesus christ of which i believe i'm a
[1:25:52] part of and i believe you're a part of
[1:25:54] if we've got the spirit of god we are
[1:25:57] his the bible said
[1:25:58] they that don't have the spirit they're
[1:26:00] none of his but i believe
[1:26:01] if i've got the holy ghost then i am his
[1:26:04] beloved child
[1:26:05] and i believe that his grace and his
[1:26:07] mercy not only rests upon me as a
[1:26:09] believer
[1:26:10] but i believe that my experience with
[1:26:12] him and the experience that he's placed
[1:26:14] inside of my heart
[1:26:15] gives me a direct connection to his mind
[1:26:19] his thoughts his intentions and all that
[1:26:22] is in the mind and the heart of god
[1:26:25] because you realize the word is a
[1:26:26] discerner of our thoughts
[1:26:28] and our intents but don't forget it did
[1:26:31] not say that it was just the discerner
[1:26:33] of
[1:26:34] a heart but the hearts the word in us
[1:26:37] also discerns the heart of god his
[1:26:40] intention his desire
[1:26:42] his thoughts and when we receive the
[1:26:44] word inside of us
[1:26:45] we can discern what god intends for us
[1:26:48] we can discern god's thinking about his
[1:26:50] bible
[1:26:51] we can discern what god feels about
[1:26:53] certain matters
[1:26:54] in our life and how does that happen by
[1:26:56] the avenue of prayer
[1:26:58] and i want to read to you just a a
[1:27:00] statement i think
[1:27:01] will help us set the tone for the rest
[1:27:03] of the evening this is out of
[1:27:04] expectation and brother brahman said
[1:27:06] what man calls great god calls foolish
[1:27:09] and what man calls foolish god calls
[1:27:11] great
[1:27:12] that's about right isn't it amen he said
[1:27:15] so what we've got to do
[1:27:16] is get back into the program of god and
[1:27:19] find out what
[1:27:20] god wants us to do and the only way i
[1:27:24] know to do it
[1:27:25] is by prayer prayer is
[1:27:28] the key prayer is the answer
[1:27:31] prayer changes things prayer is the most
[1:27:35] powerful weapon that was ever put
[1:27:38] in the control of human beings there's
[1:27:40] no atomic bomb
[1:27:42] there's no hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:27:45] prayer praise the lord
[1:27:47] prayer will even change the mind of god
[1:27:50] now looking at this particular remark it
[1:27:53] really gets us in a condition of
[1:27:54] understanding
[1:27:55] that the lord jesus wants us
[1:27:58] to have a key to all of the doors
[1:28:01] of god you know brother branham taught
[1:28:04] us
[1:28:04] that in certain things in life that
[1:28:07] there is a
[1:28:08] a key that must be given to an
[1:28:10] individual to open up
[1:28:11] certain uh you know certain things for
[1:28:13] example in music
[1:28:15] the prophet taught us that you know he
[1:28:17] said i think it was sarah i do believe
[1:28:19] he said could set down
[1:28:20] and with music on the piano and things
[1:28:22] could do a whole lot more than becky
[1:28:24] with all of the lessons that she'd taken
[1:28:26] because he said sarah was gifted whereas
[1:28:28] becky was just learning it
[1:28:29] by the notes and he talked about
[1:28:31] mathematics he said there's a key to
[1:28:33] mathematics
[1:28:34] that when a person goes to look into a
[1:28:36] math problem
[1:28:38] there's a certain understanding that
[1:28:40] comes to those
[1:28:41] that have the key of mathematics that
[1:28:42] they can take one look at the problem
[1:28:44] and tell you where it's hidden now my
[1:28:46] mother-in-law my
[1:28:47] my uh my wife's mother is a genius
[1:28:51] mathematician
[1:28:52] and uh matter of fact she was a part of
[1:28:53] a school at one time
[1:28:55] a college at one time that there was
[1:28:57] only about three or four people in the
[1:28:58] world
[1:28:59] that was able to do the high mathematics
[1:29:01] that she was in
[1:29:02] and she can take any kind of problem and
[1:29:04] i'm not kidding you when i say
[1:29:06] you could take that side wall and go
[1:29:08] from one end to the other
[1:29:09] and put the most complicated math
[1:29:11] problem up there and she can go step
[1:29:13] by step by step by step by step
[1:29:16] and tell you what the answer's gonna be
[1:29:18] down at the end of the road i can't even
[1:29:19] tie my shoes without getting confused
[1:29:21] amen
[1:29:22] amen but this woman she understands
[1:29:24] because there's been a key
[1:29:26] placed into her life to where she can
[1:29:28] look into mathematics and unlock it
[1:29:31] now we know that there are other keys
[1:29:33] like that certain people there's a
[1:29:34] brother here tonight
[1:29:35] that was sharing with us the other day
[1:29:36] that he has an engineering mind
[1:29:39] and of course you know when he looks at
[1:29:41] things engineering
[1:29:42] and that way you know he sees maybe the
[1:29:44] construction
[1:29:45] or the arrangement of how maybe a motor
[1:29:47] or an engine or something
[1:29:48] should behave and how it should be
[1:29:50] designed amen and he's got the
[1:29:52] engineering mind
[1:29:53] and my brother-in-law rodney wants to
[1:29:55] bite him amen he hates an engineer
[1:29:57] because he said they always stand on the
[1:29:59] outside of the car when he's the one's
[1:30:00] got to work in it amen
[1:30:02] amen and they put things in places he
[1:30:04] said he don't think it should go amen
[1:30:06] amen but yet he's the type of man when
[1:30:08] he looks at a car
[1:30:09] he can listen at the sound of it tick
[1:30:11] tick ticking and tell you
[1:30:13] what valve it is and what plug it was
[1:30:15] and amen where the wire might be going
[1:30:17] faulty
[1:30:18] and me i can stand there and look at a
[1:30:19] few things like that but i don't really
[1:30:21] have the key necessarily
[1:30:23] like some of them have got and they can
[1:30:25] take that key and put it in the lock as
[1:30:27] it were
[1:30:28] and they can open up the mystery of what
[1:30:31] it is they're looking at
[1:30:32] now we understand that not only is the
[1:30:35] bible
[1:30:35] god's mystery and is the bible a
[1:30:38] mysterious thing to you and i
[1:30:40] but we understand that the mystery of
[1:30:42] god
[1:30:43] had to be unlocked only by the holy
[1:30:45] spirit remember
[1:30:46] in the last day it was not william
[1:30:48] branham that opened up the seals it was
[1:30:51] not brother branham
[1:30:52] that claimed the book and took the book
[1:30:54] it was not brother branham that had the
[1:30:55] understanding
[1:30:56] of what the real mystery of all this was
[1:30:59] remember the prophet of god himself
[1:31:00] in june of 1956 i believe it is in
[1:31:04] dallas fort worth texas
[1:31:05] and he says now he takes revelation 6 1
[1:31:07] the white horse rider
[1:31:09] he said now i want to preach tonight my
[1:31:10] subject being
[1:31:12] the white horse rider the great mighty
[1:31:14] conqueror jesus christ
[1:31:16] now he's taking a text about the devil
[1:31:18] and then calling it god
[1:31:20] amen now people get critical of that but
[1:31:22] it's not nothing to be critical of
[1:31:24] brother branham was a man that had not
[1:31:26] been given the key
[1:31:27] to understand how those things fit
[1:31:30] together
[1:31:31] and you cannot unlock a door that you
[1:31:33] don't have a key for
[1:31:34] amen and remember if you try to kick it
[1:31:36] open jesus said you're a thief and a
[1:31:38] robber
[1:31:38] only he that comes in must come by the
[1:31:40] door amen you can't just force yourself
[1:31:43] into this thing
[1:31:44] amen you cannot force yourself to have a
[1:31:46] revelation
[1:31:47] you cannot force yourself to see the
[1:31:49] godhead you cannot force yourself to see
[1:31:51] these other things
[1:31:52] it must come by revelation of the holy
[1:31:55] spirit and revelation
[1:31:57] comes by prayer amen by prayer now i
[1:32:00] want you to listen to this
[1:32:01] about the powerful weapon of prayer
[1:32:04] again listen to this
[1:32:04] he said prayer is the most powerful
[1:32:07] weapon that has ever been put
[1:32:09] in the control of human beings so there
[1:32:11] again it is a
[1:32:13] weapon that has been given to you and i
[1:32:15] it is a
[1:32:16] weapon against the forces of evil of
[1:32:19] this last state now just think for a
[1:32:21] moment
[1:32:21] if you had the bible in front of you and
[1:32:24] you had enough intelligence to be able
[1:32:25] to
[1:32:26] put things together in other words you
[1:32:27] could understand maybe two plus two
[1:32:29] equals four scripturally speaking maybe
[1:32:32] you could look at a certain doctrine
[1:32:33] or a certain mystery of god and maybe by
[1:32:36] just your mind
[1:32:37] you could start putting things together
[1:32:39] and you could start working things in a
[1:32:41] direction
[1:32:42] that maybe you would understand serpent
[1:32:44] seed or even water baptism
[1:32:46] remember the prophet said it don't even
[1:32:48] take a revelation to understand
[1:32:50] water baptism that's just a matter of
[1:32:52] reading it in the bible he said be
[1:32:54] baptized in the name
[1:32:55] of the father the son and the holy ghost
[1:32:57] it don't take a revelation to read that
[1:32:59] the name is the name is the name is the
[1:33:01] name that's easy
[1:33:02] amen but a person could put all of that
[1:33:04] together have all of that understanding
[1:33:06] placed together and look right at the
[1:33:08] bible and say all right it means this
[1:33:10] it means this it means this and it means
[1:33:12] this but do you realize my precious
[1:33:14] friend
[1:33:15] that if you even got that deep in the
[1:33:17] scripture unless the lord jesus gives
[1:33:19] you the key
[1:33:20] of the revelation of the spirit to
[1:33:22] understand the mystery that is behind
[1:33:25] what you figured out
[1:33:26] you are still looking at a closed door
[1:33:28] that makes no sense to you
[1:33:31] how many people have we seen get
[1:33:32] baptized go down in the water a dry
[1:33:35] center come
[1:33:36] up a wet one why doesn't water baptism
[1:33:39] put them in a condition
[1:33:40] to where they receive the holy ghost
[1:33:41] because they never had an understanding
[1:33:43] of what it was they were really doing
[1:33:45] that's right amen when you go down in
[1:33:47] the water
[1:33:47] the real revelation of being baptized
[1:33:49] immersed in water baptism has
[1:33:52] nothing to do with you getting wet it
[1:33:54] has nothing to do with you just having a
[1:33:56] name
[1:33:56] called over you at baptism but it is a
[1:33:59] symbol and a representation
[1:34:01] of the death and the burial and the
[1:34:04] resurrection of jesus christ
[1:34:05] somebody said brother being is dead i
[1:34:07] said yes he is as i was there when they
[1:34:09] buried him hallelujah
[1:34:11] amen i know that the revelation of what
[1:34:14] takes place
[1:34:14] when i go underneath that water and that
[1:34:16] preacher said i baptize you in the name
[1:34:18] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:34:20] your sin
[1:34:21] amen my revelation is is that the old
[1:34:24] man is dead
[1:34:25] and i'm coming out of there a brand new
[1:34:26] creature in christ jesus
[1:34:29] amen but if a person goes down and
[1:34:31] they've just simply figured it out by
[1:34:33] their own understanding
[1:34:34] it's a locked door to them they never
[1:34:36] received the holy ghost
[1:34:37] and then we'll tell them as preachers
[1:34:39] but the bible said well that's true
[1:34:41] the bible did say it but if you have
[1:34:42] don't have a key to the door
[1:34:44] all you do is reading the name plate on
[1:34:46] the outside
[1:34:47] amen i can stand right here in this
[1:34:49] building this is my second time in this
[1:34:51] place here
[1:34:52] and and i don't know what this door is
[1:34:54] right here this could be the door to
[1:34:55] another closet for all i know
[1:34:57] now don't tell me what it is because i
[1:34:58] don't want to know just yet
[1:35:00] amen it could be a door to a music room
[1:35:03] you might go back in there and pray it
[1:35:05] might be the door
[1:35:05] straight outside i don't know all i can
[1:35:08] do is stand right here
[1:35:09] and look on the outside and stand there
[1:35:11] and guess as to what it is
[1:35:13] i see an exit sign but how do i know
[1:35:15] that that's not an old sign
[1:35:17] how do i know that that's not put there
[1:35:19] as a dummy exit to
[1:35:20] entice robbers to get stuck in a room so
[1:35:22] you can call the law on him
[1:35:26] hey man come on now stay with me a
[1:35:27] little while what i'm trying to tell you
[1:35:29] brother is as long as i'm standing on
[1:35:31] the outside
[1:35:32] i am only surmising i am only guessing
[1:35:36] i am only putting a theory together of
[1:35:39] what i think
[1:35:40] it might be amen it ain't the first time
[1:35:42] that people would be deceived by such
[1:35:44] things
[1:35:45] it won't be the last time people are
[1:35:46] deceived by such things
[1:35:48] but there is a difference in my
[1:35:50] revelation if i
[1:35:51] once go inside that door hallelujah and
[1:35:54] i
[1:35:54] walk through that door and step on the
[1:35:56] outside or wherever it may lead to
[1:35:58] then i can stand from the outside in
[1:36:01] and say i know what it means
[1:36:08] i'm getting ready to say something you
[1:36:09] message people buckle up
[1:36:12] one of the biggest problems we've had in
[1:36:14] the ranks of this message for
[1:36:16] 60 years is we've got a lot of people
[1:36:19] standing with a fistful of quotes and
[1:36:21] scriptures outside the door
[1:36:23] that don't understand what this message
[1:36:25] really means
[1:36:27] the shame of it is those are the ones
[1:36:29] that the world takes for the experts
[1:36:32] as to what this truth really means don't
[1:36:34] talk to them once on the outside
[1:36:38] don't talk to them ones that don't have
[1:36:39] no key don't
[1:36:41] talk to the man amen that doesn't
[1:36:43] understand the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:36:45] don't talk to the boy or the girl that
[1:36:47] has no experience with jesus christ
[1:36:51] they're just going to stand outside the
[1:36:52] door and argue with what the real
[1:36:53] meaning is
[1:36:55] talk to somebody that's been there
[1:36:59] come on now talk to somebody that's went
[1:37:02] behind the door
[1:37:04] that's got a personal revelation of
[1:37:06] jesus christ
[1:37:08] and understands what it means
[1:37:14] praise be to god it's easy for us to
[1:37:17] stand outside here and argue many a
[1:37:19] minister meeting has occurred outside
[1:37:21] doors
[1:37:23] they'll take the revelation of the seal
[1:37:24] well let's understand it as preachers
[1:37:26] sure
[1:37:26] you can understand it but if you've got
[1:37:28] a revelation it's more
[1:37:30] than just saying whether brethren said
[1:37:31] brother i'm set brother i'm set brother
[1:37:33] braham said brother iran said but i'm
[1:37:34] said
[1:37:35] the bible said the bible said the bible
[1:37:37] said the bible said
[1:37:39] well i can stand right here my scott do
[1:37:40] the same thing exit exit
[1:37:42] exit exit
[1:37:46] jesus said paul said
[1:37:49] the bible said what do you say come on
[1:37:52] come on somebody
[1:37:53] i can sit right there and quote
[1:37:57] help me somebody but if i've never been
[1:38:00] behind there
[1:38:02] i don't understand the real mystery of
[1:38:04] it
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:08] praise be to god that's the reason
[1:38:09] brother we need revelation
[1:38:13] by the spirit of god not by our own
[1:38:15] understanding of what we think we can
[1:38:16] figure out
[1:38:18] because i got news for you the word of
[1:38:19] god is designed in such a manner
[1:38:21] that the smartest human being cannot
[1:38:23] unravel its mystery
[1:38:26] the devil is a smart creature and he
[1:38:29] probed and probed and probed and probed
[1:38:31] and probed and never understood
[1:38:32] not even a third of the things that come
[1:38:34] before him that's right god knows how to
[1:38:36] keep things so confusing for the devil
[1:38:38] that's why he don't know how to whip you
[1:38:41] because he keeps things so mixed up with
[1:38:43] you all the time you don't know whether
[1:38:44] you're up or down or which way you're
[1:38:46] going
[1:38:47] amen god keeps the mystery of your life
[1:38:50] a total secret to the devil
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:38:56] i said some time ago on an interview
[1:38:58] with a young person from newfoundland
[1:39:00] it was asking about you know these
[1:39:02] husbands and wives around the message
[1:39:04] that
[1:39:04] beat their wives and their children and
[1:39:06] women that carry on do evil things i
[1:39:08] said don't talk to them as an example of
[1:39:09] this truth
[1:39:11] talk to me i've been married 23 years my
[1:39:14] wife and i we have fought like cats and
[1:39:16] dogs but we've done it in a godly way
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:21] i mean at the end of the day we love
[1:39:23] each other no matter how much we might
[1:39:24] go through hard times
[1:39:26] no matter how much we might disagree
[1:39:27] about things but we love one another
[1:39:29] hallelujah
[1:39:30] we stand right there don't talk to this
[1:39:31] guy out there that can't be faithful for
[1:39:33] not even five minutes to his wife
[1:39:35] or vice versa to her husband talk to
[1:39:38] somebody that's been there
[1:39:40] if you're sitting here tonight and you
[1:39:41] need the baptism of the holy ghost don't
[1:39:43] talk to that smoshback church member
[1:39:45] that ain't never had an ounce of joy in
[1:39:47] their life go talk to the real believer
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:51] praise god talk to the one that knows a
[1:39:53] little bit about it
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:57] because as g.i joe said when i was a boy
[1:39:59] knowing is half the battle
[1:40:03] because if you have an understanding of
[1:40:04] things nobody can change your mind
[1:40:09] if i walk back behind this door back
[1:40:11] here man this particular church there
[1:40:13] might be many doors that you go back
[1:40:14] maybe not even know what's behind them
[1:40:16] but if i've been had the experience and
[1:40:17] went back there
[1:40:18] and i know what's back behind there
[1:40:21] let's say there's a stack of boxes back
[1:40:22] there seven boxes
[1:40:23] and they're all stacked up on each other
[1:40:26] and maybe they're stacked on top of each
[1:40:27] other rather than on the floor side by
[1:40:29] side they're stacked up in the toward
[1:40:30] the ceiling
[1:40:31] it don't matter to me how much comes
[1:40:33] along and tries to take a bunch of
[1:40:34] quotes and scriptures and tell me
[1:40:36] it's this way i've been there
[1:40:41] and by being there i know myself
[1:40:44] as a matter of fact i i'm in such a
[1:40:46] place once i get there i don't even need
[1:40:48] you
[1:40:49] to tell me what it is
[1:40:51] [Laughter]
[1:40:54] preach by the bill right
[1:40:58] i don't need anybody to explain to me
[1:41:00] what it means that's why it is a
[1:41:01] personal relationship
[1:41:05] this is not a you and the preacher and
[1:41:07] the deacon and the church
[1:41:08] this is you and jesus christ one on one
[1:41:16] hallelujah once a man or woman
[1:41:19] has that experience thank you jesus
[1:41:22] nobody can talk them out of it
[1:41:25] you take some of these boys that's been
[1:41:26] in war
[1:41:28] and they go over and they experience
[1:41:29] vietnam i had three uncles in vietnam my
[1:41:32] uncle willard ran off the back of a
[1:41:33] c-130
[1:41:34] shooting his gun because they had to
[1:41:35] roll off the back of that plane they
[1:41:37] couldn't stop
[1:41:38] they'd kill every one of them on there
[1:41:40] to roll out the back of a plane and find
[1:41:41] himself in the bush somewhere
[1:41:43] to save his own life i had my uncle ray
[1:41:46] would work on the f8 phantoms
[1:41:49] he stayed in the navy might have uncle
[1:41:50] carl who was an army man
[1:41:52] and sometimes they'll do these little
[1:41:54] documentaries and things on the vietnam
[1:41:56] war
[1:41:57] that's oh was this where it was that way
[1:41:59] it was some other way or this is what
[1:42:00] happened that what happened
[1:42:02] oh yeah they've got their opinions but
[1:42:04] just talk to my uncle willard one time
[1:42:08] talk to him ask him what he saw when he
[1:42:10] was
[1:42:11] when he was rolling off the back of that
[1:42:13] plane and trying to find cover in the
[1:42:15] bush
[1:42:16] ask him about it whether it was this or
[1:42:17] that or the other
[1:42:19] you see a man a woman that has been
[1:42:20] there and they understand it
[1:42:22] it doesn't matter how great the
[1:42:24] broadcast might be or how much people
[1:42:25] might believe the other version they've
[1:42:28] been there they've experienced something
[1:42:32] now i'm going somewhere with all of this
[1:42:33] i hope you'll follow me along
[1:42:35] just just hook up to the buggy and come
[1:42:37] on go with me
[1:42:38] [Music]
[1:42:40] right this is a a weapon of
[1:42:42] understanding prayer is a
[1:42:44] weapon of revelation if you are to
[1:42:48] understand the mystery of you
[1:42:50] did you know that the real mystery of
[1:42:52] god is
[1:42:54] the mystery of a person when you hold
[1:42:56] your bible there in front of you in your
[1:42:58] mind you might think what's the mystery
[1:42:59] of a book no it's not
[1:43:01] the book is a person the book of ruth is
[1:43:04] not just words we read
[1:43:06] ruth was an actual person when we read
[1:43:09] about daniel
[1:43:10] hosea micah jonah nahim those were
[1:43:12] people
[1:43:14] so the bible is a mystery of human lives
[1:43:19] it is the mystery of the greatest life
[1:43:21] the life of the lord jesus
[1:43:25] our god is not a doctrine
[1:43:29] he is a person
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:33] and they that worship this person
[1:43:37] must worship him in spirit and truth
[1:43:40] now we say that truth oh yes the message
[1:43:43] it meant no no
[1:43:44] that truth is an understanding that god
[1:43:47] has made known to you
[1:43:48] he's let you with the key go back behind
[1:43:51] the door
[1:43:53] and you understand a truth do you
[1:43:56] understand
[1:43:56] that's the reason why sometimes
[1:43:58] counseling husbands and wives
[1:44:00] i always watch both of them real
[1:44:01] carefully because i can add my opinion
[1:44:03] about what kind of person i think they
[1:44:05] are but she's lived with him he's lived
[1:44:06] with her
[1:44:08] and there is a truth that they share
[1:44:10] that nobody else knows
[1:44:13] glory to god many people can say what
[1:44:17] they want about the bible
[1:44:19] but there is a truth that my lord and i
[1:44:21] share
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:44:23] they can say what they want to about me
[1:44:26] but there is a truth that i share with
[1:44:28] him
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:30] he knows me he knows me
[1:44:35] in a way that nobody else
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] [Music]
[1:44:43] glory be to god friends i want you to
[1:44:46] understand in this age we live in
[1:44:48] people get so suicidal they get so down
[1:44:50] they get so depressed
[1:44:51] they want to end their lives because of
[1:44:53] the opinion that somebody else holds
[1:44:55] over them
[1:44:58] but if you'll just spend time finding
[1:45:00] out lord what do you think
[1:45:03] about me
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:08] have you ever stopped to ask him lord
[1:45:11] what is your opinion about me
[1:45:21] what do you believe about me do you
[1:45:25] believe that i'm a christian you
[1:45:26] understand
[1:45:27] that when you receive the holy ghost
[1:45:28] it's not when you receive it it's when
[1:45:30] god receives you
[1:45:32] go back and look at it in future home
[1:45:35] future home 82 64 brother brad who said
[1:45:37] it's not when you receive the holy ghost
[1:45:38] it's when the holy ghost receives you
[1:45:42] we walk around i'm a believer i'm a
[1:45:44] believer i'm a believer
[1:45:46] all right but did we ever stop to say
[1:45:48] lord
[1:45:49] do you believe that about me
[1:45:52] do you believe that i am a believer
[1:45:55] because if god don't believe i'm a
[1:45:56] believer i'm in bad shape
[1:46:04] somebody's going to preach a minute and
[1:46:05] out of hope
[1:46:07] he knows the very the inside parts of us
[1:46:10] he knows those elements
[1:46:12] of our life that is so intimate so
[1:46:14] secret what david said
[1:46:16] my secret parts and all of us have them
[1:46:20] brother bam called him a door to private
[1:46:22] life
[1:46:25] and all doors need keys
[1:46:29] you realize that's what makes a man a
[1:46:30] real pastor for you
[1:46:32] because god gives that man the key to
[1:46:34] the mystery of you
[1:46:37] and you can tell him all you want that
[1:46:39] you're a believer that you've got
[1:46:40] victory that you're this that a real
[1:46:41] pastor knows
[1:46:43] whether you're right or not
[1:46:47] they do they can look into the mystery
[1:46:50] of your life and god will let them know
[1:46:52] whether you're on the level or not and
[1:46:54] that man may never say nothing about it
[1:46:56] he may never indicate to you in any way
[1:46:57] whatsoever that he disagrees with your
[1:46:59] testimony but if he's got the key to
[1:47:00] your life he knows about you
[1:47:03] that's how he knows how to preach that's
[1:47:05] understands how he understands how to
[1:47:06] feed the flock
[1:47:09] because if god ever give him the key to
[1:47:11] your heart he understands how to unfold
[1:47:13] that word to affect you
[1:47:16] oh you say brother ben that scares me it
[1:47:18] shouldn't should make you rejoice
[1:47:20] it shouldn't make you rejoice that god
[1:47:22] cared enough about you
[1:47:25] to give godly men insight into how to
[1:47:27] help you
[1:47:28] and lead you and direct you oh i know in
[1:47:31] this lady of sea and age we don't want
[1:47:33] people directing us but we need
[1:47:34] leadership i mean we need true godly
[1:47:37] leadership
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] amen right hey brother i've seen enough
[1:47:43] slickers in my lifetime
[1:47:45] i can smell them coming down the hallway
[1:47:48] i've seen enough of these guys through
[1:47:49] the years that claim one thing but yet
[1:47:51] they're in the heart there's no whole
[1:47:52] other ball game
[1:47:54] come on don't look at me like that just
[1:47:56] because we call this the message of the
[1:47:58] hour that doesn't mean we're exempt
[1:47:59] or free or or uh not susceptible to
[1:48:02] being
[1:48:02] uh invaded by a bunch of liars and
[1:48:05] everything else
[1:48:07] somebody said to me here some time ago
[1:48:09] nobody can live right in this message i
[1:48:11] said i beg your pardon
[1:48:14] i said i know one that can live it yeah
[1:48:15] that's right
[1:48:19] and his name is jesus christ and if
[1:48:22] jesus is living on the inside of my
[1:48:24] heart hallelujah
[1:48:25] then he will swing my body subject to
[1:48:29] his word
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:40] you ever wonder why god deals with you
[1:48:42] the way he deals with you
[1:48:45] why he'll allow circumstances to
[1:48:47] culminate
[1:48:48] come to a pinnacle and it's a it's a
[1:48:51] perfect storm of everything you are
[1:48:56] anything else wouldn't affect that other
[1:48:58] individual that's right but for you
[1:49:01] it's specific it's intentionally
[1:49:04] designed
[1:49:06] to drive you into place where you need
[1:49:08] to be
[1:49:10] i feel like speaking another language
[1:49:14] amen the very
[1:49:18] characteristics of you
[1:49:22] god understands how to weave them
[1:49:24] together
[1:49:26] to affect just you hallelujah
[1:49:29] thank you jesus anybody ever been
[1:49:32] sitting in church and feel like the
[1:49:33] sermon was only for them
[1:49:35] anybody feel like that tonight how's it
[1:49:38] all them heads are going like this
[1:49:42] don't you understand what the holy ghost
[1:49:44] is doing he knows how to take a man
[1:49:46] under the anointing of a gift of god
[1:49:48] and use that man to say it this way and
[1:49:50] that way and this way and that way and
[1:49:52] then this way and then that way
[1:49:54] if you're a real serious person who'll
[1:49:56] let him get serious if you're a comical
[1:49:57] person or letting him get comical
[1:50:02] i've seen the holy ghost deliver people
[1:50:03] through humor
[1:50:06] some folks sitting there they're so
[1:50:07] serious you know their face would crack
[1:50:09] if they smiled
[1:50:12] the holy ghost come down and start
[1:50:13] getting people laughing and giggling and
[1:50:14] having a good time
[1:50:16] and i'd watch that thing just that old
[1:50:18] stale spirit just
[1:50:20] oh i know some of you message people are
[1:50:22] so holy you would never laugh in church
[1:50:25] but you should you should you should
[1:50:27] have the joy of the lord in your heart
[1:50:30] because i guarantee you one thing when
[1:50:32] this next generation is looking up the
[1:50:33] ladder to see what kind of experience
[1:50:35] we've had they need to see woman to
[1:50:36] smile on it
[1:50:39] some people want the revelation of god
[1:50:41] and the power and the authority of god
[1:50:43] to raise it at
[1:50:45] i just wish someone would raise their
[1:50:46] hands in church
[1:50:48] come on brother hallelujah i just wish
[1:50:51] some of them would raise the corner of
[1:50:53] their mouth in the corner of the horizon
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:58] let's work on raising the corners of
[1:51:00] your mouth and then we'll go to raising
[1:51:02] the dead
[1:51:14] but he has such an understanding of the
[1:51:16] mystery of you
[1:51:17] yes yes you realize brother benham said
[1:51:20] god
[1:51:21] deals with the man in the way he thinks
[1:51:24] so if you're an artistic type person
[1:51:27] he'll use art to get your attention
[1:51:30] if you're a musical person he'll use
[1:51:32] music
[1:51:33] to grab your attention if you're
[1:51:35] scholarly intellectual
[1:51:37] linear type thinking you know that type
[1:51:39] a personality where everything has to be
[1:51:41] on a list
[1:51:43] god will send that kind of ministry or
[1:51:45] send that kind of influence to you
[1:51:50] just to get into you and sow into your
[1:51:53] heart the mystery
[1:51:56] of who he really is
[1:52:00] you say but brother ben i it's so
[1:52:03] difficult for me to think that
[1:52:04] god actually cares that much
[1:52:08] you see this is the misconception that
[1:52:11] if we're not
[1:52:12] careful this is the one thing that satan
[1:52:15] is going to hold over our heads
[1:52:16] and i do believe it's the one thing that
[1:52:18] holds us up from rapture and
[1:52:19] resurrection
[1:52:22] because we are under the influence of an
[1:52:25] opinion
[1:52:26] and that opinion is is that our worth
[1:52:29] is so low that god could never take and
[1:52:33] bother his time
[1:52:35] to think about you don't you understand
[1:52:39] children of god
[1:52:41] every word in the bible was placed so
[1:52:44] meticulously
[1:52:45] so careful that it could get the
[1:52:48] attention
[1:52:49] of every single child
[1:52:53] of god i want you to listen to me you
[1:52:56] understand this one thing when jesus
[1:52:58] said
[1:52:59] all my father hath given me all
[1:53:02] a l l god has
[1:53:05] never forsook ignored or ostracized
[1:53:10] not one child in the body of jesus
[1:53:13] christ
[1:53:15] not one thank you lord
[1:53:20] satan would tell you you're not
[1:53:22] important you don't matter to him
[1:53:26] but the very synergy of his word
[1:53:30] is designed to catch you to catch your
[1:53:33] attention
[1:53:35] look at the nature of the bible in the
[1:53:38] bible there are poets
[1:53:41] that's right in the bible there are
[1:53:43] warriors yes
[1:53:47] in the bible there are love stories
[1:53:50] what do you all reckon that diversity is
[1:53:51] in there for
[1:53:55] to catch the attention of those that
[1:53:57] like that warrior style
[1:53:59] yeah the fight
[1:54:02] when i was a boy i loved professional
[1:54:04] wrestling when hulk hogan would get beat
[1:54:06] down he'd start doing that hawking up
[1:54:07] thing
[1:54:08] oh i get chills all over my body
[1:54:11] and when i got ready to get saved and
[1:54:13] the holy spirit started telling me about
[1:54:14] being saved you were one of the things
[1:54:16] god dealt with me on
[1:54:17] that hero thing that coming back from
[1:54:20] from from all odds being beat down
[1:54:22] beyond understanding and then being able
[1:54:24] to come back
[1:54:26] i used to wonder why do i like things
[1:54:28] like that because god made me
[1:54:30] with that warrior feeling because it
[1:54:31] comes with the ministry
[1:54:35] in the bible there is there's
[1:54:37] intellectual sides to god
[1:54:39] did you ever stop to think that when god
[1:54:42] put the bible together he put it
[1:54:43] together in such a scientific way
[1:54:46] that every scientific mind in here can
[1:54:49] be attracted to its understanding
[1:54:52] or have you figured out whether the
[1:54:53] earth is flat around yet
[1:54:57] and how around our earth can have four
[1:55:02] corners
[1:55:05] thank you lord jesus amen he put his
[1:55:08] word together in such a manner
[1:55:11] that it could attract the attention of
[1:55:14] every type of mindset
[1:55:17] in every type of thought
[1:55:21] then if i'm to understand him
[1:55:25] then he must give me a key
[1:55:28] where he can reveal to me what his
[1:55:31] thoughts
[1:55:32] are yes sir and that key is prayer
[1:55:38] brother adam talked about when we are
[1:55:39] ascending up
[1:55:41] he called it going into prayer land
[1:55:46] there's a realm that a child of god
[1:55:48] ascends to glory to god
[1:55:50] amen to where it's just like going
[1:55:55] behind this door
[1:55:58] if i've got the ability to go in there
[1:56:00] sister this is the reason
[1:56:01] that the the bible taught you don't cut
[1:56:03] your hair
[1:56:05] you want another real reason why we t
[1:56:07] women teach women to have uncut hair
[1:56:09] when i was down in jamaica and then
[1:56:10] rastafarians and men had their hair well
[1:56:12] down past their shoulders i told them
[1:56:14] you're in the same conditions as a
[1:56:15] bob-haired woman
[1:56:17] the bible said not for a man to pray
[1:56:19] with his head covered like that
[1:56:21] not for a woman to cut her hair all you
[1:56:23] say but you don't understand the nature
[1:56:25] of my hair if i don't cut it it won't
[1:56:26] grow the bible said don't you touch
[1:56:28] your glory that's thus saith the lord
[1:56:31] you can take culture proper culture and
[1:56:33] you can take a health magazine about
[1:56:34] what it says about what you're supposed
[1:56:35] to do but the bible said don't you touch
[1:56:37] it
[1:56:39] not calmly for a woman to pray or
[1:56:41] prophesy with her head uncovered cut
[1:56:43] air
[1:56:47] because it's your prayer line
[1:56:51] god demanded of a woman that she'd have
[1:56:53] such a thing
[1:56:54] on her head because of the angels you
[1:56:57] know what paul said
[1:56:59] did you ever stop to wonder what does
[1:57:01] that mean a woman with her head covered
[1:57:03] because of the angels well you remember
[1:57:05] what the bible taught
[1:57:06] about the angels that is that isaiah saw
[1:57:09] in the temple remember
[1:57:10] there were three phrases or three phases
[1:57:12] i should say rather
[1:57:13] that that god had explained to us uh
[1:57:16] through brother branham in a message
[1:57:18] influenced in different places where he
[1:57:19] talked about the wings that covered
[1:57:21] and the wings on the back one was for
[1:57:23] action one was for service but there was
[1:57:25] another one there for humility
[1:57:29] and god liken the hair on your head
[1:57:34] to give you power because of the angels
[1:57:36] in other words it is your
[1:57:38] sign of humility service
[1:57:42] and action as a daughter of god and as a
[1:57:44] son of god
[1:57:47] and when you bow your head to pray
[1:57:49] notice what i said
[1:57:50] when you bow your head to pray
[1:57:55] god recognizes your surrender
[1:57:59] god identifies your sincerity and your
[1:58:02] service
[1:58:04] you realize a woman that has cut hair if
[1:58:06] she knows better especially
[1:58:08] her prayers don't get through the roof
[1:58:10] unless she's repenting
[1:58:12] same thing with a man if he's got long
[1:58:13] hair god won't hear them unless they're
[1:58:16] repentance
[1:58:16] i'll contrary to the bible to do such a
[1:58:19] thing
[1:58:21] because a woman that cuts her hair it's
[1:58:23] a sign of rebellion
[1:58:26] showing that she has has denied her
[1:58:28] headship
[1:58:30] there's even a deeper type to this as
[1:58:31] well the bible said that we're not
[1:58:34] allowed to add
[1:58:35] nor take away so here we have in
[1:58:39] symbology a man with long hair he has
[1:58:42] added to the word of god and is very
[1:58:44] tight
[1:58:45] and she that takes the hair away she has
[1:58:48] removed from the word
[1:58:49] in the very type of what's on her head
[1:58:54] he said well the bible said hat no it
[1:58:56] said hair
[1:59:00] lord i figured you sisters will be
[1:59:01] screaming right now
[1:59:03] preach brother being preached
[1:59:07] at least the brothers i thought you
[1:59:08] don't be squeaking amen y'all ain't
[1:59:10] saying none
[1:59:16] but she has power on her head because of
[1:59:18] the angels
[1:59:21] somebody told me one time and i say this
[1:59:23] reverently
[1:59:24] it said about so i was over overseas in
[1:59:27] trinidad and they said well you see our
[1:59:29] black sisters their type of hair
[1:59:31] it splits and if they don't cut it it
[1:59:32] won't be healthy
[1:59:34] i said if they cut it their soul won't
[1:59:35] be healthy what's the difference
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:39] god can take your hair and make it
[1:59:40] healthy if you're ready
[1:59:46] remember remember to have
[1:59:49] long hair doesn't mean long hair
[1:59:52] the bible said long hair is uncut
[1:59:55] hair so your hair could be this long
[1:59:58] or this long or this long or this long
[2:00:01] or way on down here like that
[2:00:03] as long as it's not cut god recognizes
[2:00:05] it as long hair
[2:00:10] praise heart you say why does this
[2:00:14] matter
[2:00:14] because if you want behind that door
[2:00:19] there's a condition you must meet in his
[2:00:21] word
[2:00:23] praise the lord all right brothers here
[2:00:26] you come
[2:00:28] do you realize that the bible said if
[2:00:30] you have an opt
[2:00:31] against your wife that you're not even
[2:00:35] able to go to prayer
[2:00:38] until you make that thing straight
[2:00:40] that's right
[2:00:42] so if you and the missus is getting a
[2:00:44] little fuss and you're mad and a hornet
[2:00:46] you all minnesotans understand that one
[2:00:48] don't you
[2:00:50] huh and you're angry and you're upset ah
[2:00:53] that guy had woman and then you try to
[2:00:55] go in and go pray
[2:00:57] you know what the holy ghost is going to
[2:00:58] tell you he's going to slam that door in
[2:01:01] your face and say go make it right with
[2:01:02] that woman
[2:01:06] there's conditions following the word
[2:01:09] sure
[2:01:10] all right let's take it next i got the
[2:01:11] brothers i got the sister let's get
[2:01:13] everybody.
[2:01:16] jesus said when you come praying stand
[2:01:18] praying he called it so when you stand
[2:01:20] hands holy hands i wouldn't all men
[2:01:21] would stand
[2:01:22] holy hands lifted he said if you know
[2:01:24] your brother's got an odd against you
[2:01:27] leave your gift at the altar and go back
[2:01:30] and go make it right with him
[2:01:32] don't offer the gift and keep on
[2:01:34] pressing oh he'll figure it out she'll
[2:01:36] figure it out that's on them that ain't
[2:01:38] on me that ain't what the bible said the
[2:01:39] bible said if you know your brother's
[2:01:40] got a knot you go to him
[2:01:43] leave your gift at the altar so that
[2:01:45] your prayers be not hindered
[2:01:53] let me give you an instance back in the
[2:01:56] 20th century
[2:01:58] of a man who had a real relationship
[2:02:02] with god and
[2:02:04] had displeased the lord by telling just
[2:02:06] a little
[2:02:09] lie what a big and it was just a little
[2:02:12] one
[2:02:13] [Music]
[2:02:17] the phone started reagan uh yes is
[2:02:20] william branham available
[2:02:21] brother bam runs out the back door says
[2:02:23] midi tell him i'm out of here
[2:02:25] right bill now are you sure tell him i'm
[2:02:27] not here
[2:02:30] he goes out stands outside to the phone
[2:02:32] calls over
[2:02:33] a little bit later somebody calls him to
[2:02:35] come and pray
[2:02:38] for a dying baby
[2:02:41] now watch if god has respect to persons
[2:02:44] he should have overlooked this
[2:02:45] completely
[2:02:46] oh that's brother branham that's elijah
[2:02:47] it's malachi 4 no big deal god don't
[2:02:49] overlook his word for nobody
[2:02:51] not me not you not nobody
[2:02:55] brother i went to go lay hands on that
[2:02:56] child and pray for it
[2:02:58] and the spirit of god spoke to him you
[2:03:01] are not
[2:03:02] fit amen
[2:03:06] to pray for that child go back and make
[2:03:10] that thing right
[2:03:11] sure friends i i believe we would
[2:03:14] understand a whole lot more
[2:03:15] while we don't get prayers answered like
[2:03:17] we think they should be answered
[2:03:20] if we understood the small principles
[2:03:22] that get that door
[2:03:23] slammed in our face and we're not
[2:03:25] allowed in
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:31] i do understand that when the church
[2:03:33] gets quiet i've got you right where i
[2:03:35] want you
[2:03:36] so good good good
[2:03:39] good good we going to have a good time
[2:03:43] right here tonight
[2:03:47] oh make no mistake of it you're not
[2:03:48] going to turn me down or shut me down or
[2:03:51] make me feel awkward
[2:03:52] the quieter you get the harder i push
[2:03:55] because you're just telling on yourself
[2:03:58] you're telling on yourself that's what
[2:03:59] you're doing so rather than sit there
[2:04:01] and beat yourself up and recluse back
[2:04:03] into some little
[2:04:04] psychological shell why don't you repent
[2:04:06] and say lord this man of god has got a
[2:04:08] message to help me tonight
[2:04:09] and i want to open my spirit open up my
[2:04:12] heart
[2:04:13] and say god i want to move on with you
[2:04:17] [Applause]
[2:04:21] let me give you another instance brother
[2:04:22] batman said if somebody comes to the
[2:04:24] platform
[2:04:26] with unconfessed sin
[2:04:29] now once you listen to these words that
[2:04:30] the angel of the lord told him at
[2:04:31] green's mill
[2:04:33] nothing will stand in front of your
[2:04:36] prayer not
[2:04:38] even cancer
[2:04:42] and yet here is the same prophet of god
[2:04:44] saying if someone has
[2:04:45] unconfessed sin in their life that it
[2:04:48] can put brakes
[2:04:49] on deity
[2:04:53] you could anoint them with a 20 gallon
[2:04:55] bucket of oil
[2:04:58] but as long as that sin lays there no
[2:05:01] matter how much you pray
[2:05:03] that thing lays right there
[2:05:07] you can understand friends why some
[2:05:09] people never move on with god like they
[2:05:10] should
[2:05:11] they allow things to lay in their heart
[2:05:13] and their human spirit for many many
[2:05:15] years
[2:05:16] they allow offenses they allow
[2:05:18] historical things in their life
[2:05:20] they allow past events they allow things
[2:05:21] to build up in their human spirit
[2:05:23] and you can always tell whenever the
[2:05:25] holy ghost goes to dealing with it
[2:05:28] instead of facing it they run away from
[2:05:30] it
[2:05:31] right that's right
[2:05:34] when are we going to learn that there is
[2:05:37] not a corner of this earth
[2:05:39] that we can run to that the holy ghost
[2:05:42] don't already know
[2:05:45] and friends here's what's so sad about
[2:05:47] it the thing we hold on to
[2:05:49] that that little grudge or that little
[2:05:50] bitter feeling or that offense or that
[2:05:52] hurt
[2:05:52] or that memory or that abuse or assault
[2:05:55] or whatever that thing we hold on to
[2:05:57] if we would just give it to the lord
[2:05:58] it's a lot easier to get over than what
[2:06:00] you believe yourself
[2:06:03] but see what happens we convince
[2:06:05] ourselves i've got to hold on to this
[2:06:08] i've got to figure this out says who
[2:06:12] well you say i said just because you say
[2:06:14] don't make it that way i can say that
[2:06:16] i'm a purple elephant standing on my
[2:06:17] head gargling purple peanut butter don't
[2:06:19] make it that way
[2:06:21] come on
[2:06:26] how many people i've met in 30 years of
[2:06:27] ministry that you sit down and you talk
[2:06:29] to them
[2:06:30] talk to them and talk to them and talk
[2:06:31] to them you try to help them you're not
[2:06:33] getting anywhere you keep hitting a
[2:06:34] brick wall come to find out
[2:06:36] they've got some little thing laying
[2:06:38] inside that human spirit that they've
[2:06:40] they've harbored that inside of them for
[2:06:42] many years maybe as a child they were
[2:06:45] abused or maybe they had an abusive
[2:06:46] father or
[2:06:47] some kind of thing like that and a lot
[2:06:50] of times if you're not careful you'll
[2:06:51] tie such behavior like that
[2:06:53] to your leaders and you'll tie it to god
[2:06:55] you'll tie it to pastors and preachers
[2:06:56] and you'll tie it to the word and if
[2:06:59] every time the word gets stern and hard
[2:07:01] you'll see your abuse of uncle standing
[2:07:03] there
[2:07:04] or that abuse of controlling mother or
[2:07:05] whatever it might be
[2:07:07] separating things from your mind god is
[2:07:09] not an abuser
[2:07:13] don't you understand the build up of
[2:07:15] these things in our human spirit
[2:07:18] is the reason why many doors in our
[2:07:20] lives still remain closed
[2:07:23] god is you hear me god is not going to
[2:07:25] give you a key
[2:07:27] unless you are willing to let go of the
[2:07:30] very thing that you're holding on to
[2:07:31] that will hold you back
[2:07:36] this is why brother brown said god don't
[2:07:37] give some people gifts
[2:07:39] he said he can't trust him with it give
[2:07:42] somebody allow somebody to speak in
[2:07:43] tongues interpret prophesy
[2:07:45] maybe lay hands on the sick and they
[2:07:46] recover discern a spirit and
[2:07:48] all of a sudden now they become a
[2:07:49] stuffed shirt
[2:07:52] well look what the lord done with me
[2:07:53] tonight and they always forget that part
[2:07:55] the lord did it
[2:07:59] this is why brother and said god can't
[2:08:00] trust preachers sometimes
[2:08:02] because he said that god will go to
[2:08:04] bless them and they'll start thinking
[2:08:05] that's me doing that
[2:08:08] i always like to remind the devil
[2:08:10] whenever things are going really really
[2:08:11] well and people are being blessed to the
[2:08:13] lord and
[2:08:14] that little pride thing will come around
[2:08:15] and see what you're doing for the lord
[2:08:17] i always get me a cup of cold water and
[2:08:19] take my finger and stick it in there and
[2:08:21] pull it out and say now
[2:08:22] find the hole that's me
[2:08:27] the only reason i make an impression at
[2:08:29] all is because god's the one stuck his
[2:08:31] finger
[2:08:33] right ain't got nothing to do with ben
[2:08:35] noron or any other preacher any other
[2:08:37] human being
[2:08:40] praise the lord amen
[2:08:43] brother is dealing with a woman she's
[2:08:46] committed adultery
[2:08:48] and she hid this thing in her spirit
[2:08:51] right
[2:08:51] brother batman and sister media are
[2:08:53] sitting in the living room she's
[2:08:54] bringing in drinks
[2:08:56] trying to serve even my new media brand
[2:08:58] and all that knew that she was a server
[2:09:00] loved to serve the body of christ and
[2:09:02] about the time sister media come in
[2:09:04] brother branham had called out that
[2:09:05] thing of that affair she had had
[2:09:08] brotherhood said she passed out in the
[2:09:09] living room
[2:09:11] because the shock of it was so great and
[2:09:13] when she come to herself
[2:09:15] she said brother don't tell nobody that
[2:09:18] i repented before god listen
[2:09:21] he said you may have repented to god but
[2:09:23] it wasn't god you sinned against
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:27] it was your husband about that time the
[2:09:30] prophet breaks into a vision he sees her
[2:09:32] uh sees him standing there on the
[2:09:33] chevrolet get up and he's laying
[2:09:34] underneath
[2:09:35] a tree in his car with another woman
[2:09:37] having an affair with her
[2:09:39] he said now go back and make it right
[2:09:42] because he's got the same thing to
[2:09:43] confess to you that you do to him
[2:09:46] listen at these next words i won't call
[2:09:48] the preacher's name but brother adam
[2:09:49] said no wonder
[2:09:50] he can't have a revival he was a deacon
[2:09:53] she was a sunday school teacher
[2:09:59] that's the reason why brother we need to
[2:10:00] make sure
[2:10:03] that if there's any doors closed to us
[2:10:04] god help me
[2:10:06] help me dig and dig all right
[2:10:10] help me dig down deep enough
[2:10:21] because until i'm willing to purge these
[2:10:23] things from my life
[2:10:24] he will never give me the key to those
[2:10:28] areas of my life that i
[2:10:29] desperately want to walk into don't
[2:10:32] forget friends the scripture i read to
[2:10:34] you in mark 11
[2:10:35] 24 25 is the very scripture that brother
[2:10:39] branham was thinking and meditating upon
[2:10:41] when the third pool first visited him
[2:10:45] now we call ourselves word bride don't
[2:10:47] we
[2:10:49] we're third pool people right
[2:10:52] huh what does that look like exactly
[2:10:56] anybody know anybody know what third
[2:10:58] pool bride's supposed to look like
[2:11:00] hold your quotes hold your quotes i
[2:11:03] don't mean for you to regurgitate to me
[2:11:04] what he said
[2:11:06] i mean what does it really look like
[2:11:08] what does third pool bride people really
[2:11:10] look like
[2:11:14] i guarantee you one thing that when
[2:11:16] brother baby's walking down through them
[2:11:17] woods thinking well it's not what i say
[2:11:20] it's what the word says
[2:11:22] he was not conjuring in his mind the
[2:11:25] creative power to figure out the formula
[2:11:28] for speaking squirrels into existence
[2:11:33] all of a sudden the voice of god said
[2:11:35] you're a hunting game
[2:11:36] what do you want glory to god
[2:11:41] don't you understand the very reason
[2:11:44] that god could
[2:11:45] open up this door to this man
[2:11:48] was because there was no doubt in
[2:11:52] his heart about the true word of the
[2:11:55] lord
[2:11:56] amen and because brother bradham had a
[2:11:59] clean conscience about the word
[2:12:01] about the bible and there was not a
[2:12:03] speck of doubt in his heart about thus
[2:12:05] saith
[2:12:06] the lord god could hand him the key of
[2:12:08] creation
[2:12:11] and say you speak it
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:18] we're getting deep in the honeypot now
[2:12:19] sean
[2:12:22] he said he was sitting there in that
[2:12:23] little table now remember i i've been
[2:12:25] told
[2:12:25] by the brethren that were there that
[2:12:27] when brother branham was telling that
[2:12:29] story back before heidi wright they were
[2:12:30] sitting there laughing they thought
[2:12:31] brother brown was cutting up and telling
[2:12:33] the story brother was always telling
[2:12:34] some little odd story or
[2:12:36] some little thing and they thought he
[2:12:37] was cutting up they were laughing at him
[2:12:40] all at once glory to god he said that
[2:12:42] super anointing
[2:12:46] dropped into the room and had he said
[2:12:49] that ain't nothing
[2:12:50] but the truth do you understand why
[2:12:55] god turned around and used the prophet
[2:12:57] to say ask what you will
[2:13:00] there was nothing in her heart that
[2:13:03] would have hindered her
[2:13:06] from receiving that key
[2:13:13] [Applause]
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:15] there hallelujah nothing on the inside
[2:13:17] that would hinder her
[2:13:19] from him saying hey you want a million
[2:13:22] dollars
[2:13:23] you want the healing of your sister
[2:13:25] edith
[2:13:26] what do you want here's the key
[2:13:30] friend i hope you understand what i'm
[2:13:32] saying to you is the very essence of
[2:13:34] resurrection and rapture
[2:13:36] because one of these days we're going to
[2:13:37] come to such a place of such total
[2:13:39] surrender before the lord
[2:13:40] that he is going to say all right you
[2:13:42] change your body
[2:13:44] you want rest you go ahead and raise
[2:13:46] yourself up
[2:13:50] amen oh you say it's the lord that does
[2:13:54] that yes
[2:13:55] but don't forget the power of
[2:13:57] resurrection
[2:14:02] [Applause]
[2:14:06] that's why jesus could stand right there
[2:14:08] that day and say destroy this temple
[2:14:10] and three days i'll raise it up again
[2:14:14] he already knew he had the key of
[2:14:16] resurrection
[2:14:22] praise the lord this ain't gone nowhere
[2:14:25] near like i wanted it to tonight but
[2:14:26] we're in the good spots now
[2:14:30] i had my notes all prepared i'm on his
[2:14:32] notes now
[2:14:34] right those things must be repented of
[2:14:37] let me give you another example
[2:14:39] what about talking about a young lady
[2:14:41] that drowns
[2:14:42] some time ago in her lifetime and the
[2:14:44] lord spared her
[2:14:45] but she goes into the hospital she's got
[2:14:47] a baby
[2:14:49] and this this child she's wondering what
[2:14:51] we call preeclampsia now back then they
[2:14:53] called it toxemia
[2:14:55] the placenta and the umbilical cord
[2:14:57] begins breaking down and that toxic
[2:15:00] cells and that that that dead fiber
[2:15:02] begins circling through the system
[2:15:03] raises the blood pressure
[2:15:05] raises the heart rate causes the body to
[2:15:07] swell strangulates the baby
[2:15:10] and sometimes the women that are
[2:15:12] delivered they almost sometimes
[2:15:13] never get over it back in those days
[2:15:15] especially
[2:15:17] now they have magnesium and all kinds of
[2:15:18] different chemicals and things to put in
[2:15:20] the body
[2:15:20] to bring it under total subjection to
[2:15:22] try to save that woman's life
[2:15:23] they've saved hundreds of millions of
[2:15:25] lives probably with the science they've
[2:15:26] developed today
[2:15:29] but back in that time period they didn't
[2:15:31] have the same understanding that they do
[2:15:33] now
[2:15:35] and here this girl is laying there dying
[2:15:39] they call brother branham brother said
[2:15:40] the parents were just these people that
[2:15:42] just slinked in and out of the
[2:15:43] tabernacle come to church when they felt
[2:15:44] like it and on and on
[2:15:46] and said the last day she was in her bed
[2:15:48] and said her testimony became such
[2:15:51] that her parents gave their heart back
[2:15:53] to the lord god started doing great
[2:15:55] things right there in that hospital
[2:15:57] seemingly she got better
[2:16:01] and one day her mama walked in she said
[2:16:03] i'm going home mama
[2:16:05] well i know sweetheart i know i know
[2:16:08] they're getting ready to release it
[2:16:08] you're getting he said no
[2:16:09] no mama you don't understand i'm getting
[2:16:11] ready to go home
[2:16:14] sometime later the girl dies now watch
[2:16:16] brother branham
[2:16:18] the prophet of god who stood on the
[2:16:21] platform in india
[2:16:23] and said if this man's eyes don't come
[2:16:25] open which one of your gods
[2:16:26] you come out here bring buddha up here
[2:16:28] bring all the rest of them you seeks you
[2:16:30] jane come up here with your hindu
[2:16:31] religion and open this man's eyes
[2:16:34] he said though that time billy graham
[2:16:35] went down in there and said they made
[2:16:37] the challenge to him he said i wish i
[2:16:39] could have stood where billy stood
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:16:44] and he said they begin breaking their
[2:16:46] idols he said it made a dust cloud for
[2:16:48] city blocks
[2:16:49] when that man's eyes come open
[2:16:52] same prophet of god
[2:16:56] and now this girl goes by the way of the
[2:16:58] grave
[2:17:00] and brother branham goes to god and says
[2:17:03] you owe me
[2:17:05] an understanding
[2:17:10] you know what brother ham said about
[2:17:11] that he said well the lord
[2:17:14] let me pout around for about six months
[2:17:18] i guess ain't none of y'all know what
[2:17:19] pouting around is all about dude
[2:17:24] at least none of you are going to admit
[2:17:25] it tonight are you
[2:17:27] huh he said he let me pile around for a
[2:17:30] little while
[2:17:32] he said then one day he come to me in a
[2:17:34] vision
[2:17:35] and showed to me she should have died
[2:17:37] way back when they had that little party
[2:17:39] and she was drowning in the in the pool
[2:17:40] or in the in the in the creek
[2:17:42] but said she wasn't ready to go then but
[2:17:45] now she was ready to go that's why i
[2:17:47] took her
[2:17:48] here brother man's looking at the great
[2:17:50] miracles that took place in the last
[2:17:51] hours of the girl's life her mom and dad
[2:17:53] get right with god on and on and on and
[2:17:55] on and then here she dies
[2:17:58] this is what brother branham said had i
[2:18:00] approached him
[2:18:02] with the right attitude he would have
[2:18:04] told me right away what the reason was
[2:18:07] yes he said i found
[2:18:10] out god don't owe me anything
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:17] now here's a prophet of god that has
[2:18:18] created squirrels
[2:18:20] he has given hattie her children there
[2:18:22] has been great mighty
[2:18:24] things by this time as i understand it
[2:18:26] he has already
[2:18:27] had all kinds of healings and miracles
[2:18:29] and revivals and things
[2:18:30] that would boggle the human mind
[2:18:35] and for six months brother branham beat
[2:18:38] his head
[2:18:41] against this closed door why
[2:18:45] god you owe me an understanding he said
[2:18:48] if i
[2:18:49] just had the right attitude he would
[2:18:51] have said here let me show you what it
[2:18:52] was all about
[2:18:56] it makes me wonder friends if the reason
[2:18:59] why we don't get no further than what we
[2:19:00] get sometimes
[2:19:02] is because we come with this elitist
[2:19:04] attitude that's right
[2:19:06] i'm the bride i deserve it
[2:19:10] you see there's two sides of the
[2:19:11] spectrum there are you that are sitting
[2:19:13] here tonight
[2:19:13] that don't believe you deserve anything
[2:19:15] and there are you that believe you
[2:19:16] deserve
[2:19:17] everything there is no in-between don't
[2:19:20] play like aries
[2:19:24] and as preachers we preach to both
[2:19:26] groups so you know when you're preaching
[2:19:28] about the bride and the power and the
[2:19:30] authority of god they're going yes sir
[2:19:31] man of god
[2:19:32] bring it on bring it on when you try to
[2:19:34] humble them that's when they get quiet
[2:19:36] they make 47 trips to the bathroom and
[2:19:38] they check the cell phone
[2:19:44] and then that other group when you're
[2:19:45] sitting there preaching about all the
[2:19:46] power to resurrection
[2:19:48] amen that other group is sitting there
[2:19:51] and they're saying oh
[2:19:51] that's not me oh i just can't i can't i
[2:19:54] can't raise them up
[2:20:02] do you understand how many times he
[2:20:03] would hand us the key
[2:20:06] if we would just approach him the way he
[2:20:08] said to approach him
[2:20:10] our father who art in heaven i like what
[2:20:13] spurgeon said there
[2:20:15] brother carol my my old pastor before he
[2:20:17] retired he used to quote this one all
[2:20:18] the time
[2:20:20] when he says our father that's plural
[2:20:23] meaning that is not just my father
[2:20:26] but he's the father of a and in order
[2:20:30] for him to be a father that means he
[2:20:31] must have children
[2:20:34] our father who art in heaven watch us
[2:20:36] approach hallowed be thy name that's
[2:20:37] worship
[2:20:38] amen thank you jesus we don't we don't
[2:20:41] come to him with a wishlist like this
[2:20:44] we come to him with thank you lord
[2:20:47] hallelujah
[2:20:48] the only reason i'm living today is
[2:20:49] because of your grace the only reason i
[2:20:51] understand
[2:20:52] your mercy
[2:20:56] you ever heard the expression you get
[2:20:57] more bees with honey than you do vinegar
[2:21:02] the prophet of god said that when we
[2:21:04] have a fragrance
[2:21:06] that stinks that's why we must apply
[2:21:11] prayer he said if you ever went into a
[2:21:14] rose garden or something early in the
[2:21:15] morning you said the dew laying across
[2:21:17] all them branches and them leaves
[2:21:18] dropping off you see these beautiful
[2:21:20] picturesque type
[2:21:21] photographs you know where they just
[2:21:23] said the garden just the outlet
[2:21:25] a little fog laying that mislaying over
[2:21:26] how beautiful it is
[2:21:28] brother baby said that's the way it is
[2:21:30] when we enter into prayer land
[2:21:32] enter that place of prayer we go into
[2:21:34] where the fragrance of the holy spirit
[2:21:36] he said how fresh we are in the presence
[2:21:39] of the angel yes
[2:21:41] praise the lord
[2:21:44] let's be honest sometimes the reason we
[2:21:48] don't get the key
[2:21:50] is because our attitude stinks
[2:21:58] there'll be a lot of people in this
[2:21:59] message wind up in hell
[2:22:01] over their attitude
[2:22:04] a lot quicker than they'll wind up in
[2:22:06] hell over the false doctrines or the
[2:22:08] split beliefs or the false
[2:22:10] understandings that they've acquired
[2:22:12] they're going to be a lot more people
[2:22:13] wind up in hell
[2:22:16] because of their stinky rotten attitude
[2:22:19] they think god owes them something
[2:22:22] and on the other side of that you that
[2:22:24] don't think you deserve anything you're
[2:22:25] just as bad
[2:22:27] because you're calling yourself scum
[2:22:29] when he called you a jewel
[2:22:31] you're calling yourself trash when he
[2:22:32] called you the apple of his eye
[2:22:34] you are just as bad as them elitist ones
[2:22:36] that think they deserve everything
[2:22:39] because you're not raising to a level to
[2:22:41] accept anything
[2:22:43] setting on a stool to do nothing well
[2:22:45] i'm not worthy
[2:22:46] i don't have the ability who said that
[2:22:49] about you
[2:22:52] who who prophesied that over your life
[2:22:55] oh you say mama said it mama's not your
[2:22:57] ultimate
[2:22:59] i was taught that growing up those who
[2:23:01] taught you that were not the ultimate of
[2:23:03] your life
[2:23:04] they do not have the key to the mystery
[2:23:07] of you
[2:23:11] amen
[2:23:12] [Applause]
[2:23:16] he said it's like working a job
[2:23:20] scott if i go to work for you this
[2:23:22] afternoon
[2:23:23] and i say it's hard to call you scotty
[2:23:25] ain't it everybody calls you scotty
[2:23:30] except for your girls they call your dad
[2:23:35] but if i was to say brother scott i i
[2:23:37] need a little work
[2:23:39] he put me to work and i got up there
[2:23:41] maybe
[2:23:42] monday morning instead of going right on
[2:23:43] to the job or going right and doing
[2:23:45] something i just go
[2:23:46] stand over and work on my phone a little
[2:23:47] while you know
[2:23:51] if i want to know what i'm supposed to
[2:23:53] do listen close
[2:23:55] i go to him that gave me the job and i
[2:23:58] say to him
[2:24:00] what do you want me to do
[2:24:06] amen when you look at your life and you
[2:24:09] see a mystery before you
[2:24:11] go to that has the key
[2:24:16] i'm trying to behave myself y'all but
[2:24:18] it's hard
[2:24:20] and say lord what
[2:24:24] lori what do you
[2:24:28] want me to do
[2:24:31] how do you see me in 10 years
[2:24:36] how do you see me in five years
[2:24:40] friends this is the reason why people
[2:24:41] get in marriage situations
[2:24:43] because they don't stop to pray long
[2:24:45] enough to say god who did you choose
[2:24:47] for me to be married to i guarantee you
[2:24:50] one thing if you wait long enough on who
[2:24:52] the lord gives to you
[2:24:53] you'll never have a problem that way
[2:24:57] the reason we have so many marriage and
[2:24:58] divorce cases and listen young people
[2:25:00] there is if you have been raised in this
[2:25:02] message don't you go around thinking
[2:25:03] you've got permissive will
[2:25:04] you don't so you're sitting on this pew
[2:25:08] that's understood marriage and divorce
[2:25:09] from a boy and a girl you have
[2:25:11] no excuse for doing the things that some
[2:25:13] of us do
[2:25:16] we've heard from a child up don't have
[2:25:17] engagements and things unless it's a
[2:25:19] good faith engagement go to the father
[2:25:20] get his permission
[2:25:22] in the message we skip over every bit of
[2:25:24] that people make promises and do things
[2:25:26] and they don't even sit down and talk to
[2:25:28] the leader of the home
[2:25:30] and then wonder why they're getting a
[2:25:31] mess later on it's because we're not
[2:25:34] praying
[2:25:36] because we don't take a step back and
[2:25:38] say god
[2:25:40] what if the lord never saw you get
[2:25:41] married until you was 87 years old
[2:25:46] amen oh that's awful don't tell me that
[2:25:50] brother bill i want to get married
[2:25:51] tomorrow
[2:25:53] [Music]
[2:25:55] okay well i'll ask you a question then
[2:25:57] smartypants
[2:25:58] would you rather live 65 years in hell
[2:26:01] or would you rather live about 15 years
[2:26:04] in heaven
[2:26:09] come on now it's up to you how you want
[2:26:13] to
[2:26:19] i choose the brother say a number of
[2:26:21] years ago that you bought this brand new
[2:26:22] car i was thinking this coming up the
[2:26:24] road actually
[2:26:25] and he talked about i said he's a brand
[2:26:26] new car he said i didn't pray over the
[2:26:27] thing he said all the cars i'd had
[2:26:29] before that i prayed over every one of
[2:26:30] them he said this one is brand new cloth
[2:26:32] i wouldn't be all right
[2:26:32] he said i never had so much trouble out
[2:26:34] of the car in all of my life
[2:26:36] it broke down i ended up having to sell
[2:26:38] the thing he said because it cost me
[2:26:40] more money to keep it up than it was
[2:26:41] though i bought it
[2:26:46] because all of these things are little
[2:26:48] mysteries
[2:26:50] even where to live oh no
[2:26:53] i know i know i know but don't forget
[2:26:56] brother branham said

[2:28:21] revival

[2:28:29] god has a key that he wants to give to
[2:28:33] us
[2:28:33] [Applause]
[2:28:37] that's the real spirit of revival
[2:28:39] anyways
[2:28:41] now friends i know our modern day
[2:28:43] evangelism is a lot of
[2:28:45] shouting and hollering and good
[2:28:47] one-liners and good one-line bases and
[2:28:50] getting everybody excited and jubilant
[2:28:52] and standing on their feet and
[2:28:53] rejoicing let me tell you something
[2:28:55] brother
[2:28:57] i might be a young man to some of you
[2:28:59] but i've had too many miles on this
[2:29:00] whole body
[2:29:02] i told somebody today i'm a 44 year old
[2:29:04] in a 97 year old body
[2:29:07] i beat it to death traveling for the
[2:29:08] lord these eyes have seen a lot
[2:29:11] we're living in a time we don't need
[2:29:13] fluff evangelism
[2:29:15] we need something like this right here
[2:29:17] tonight not trying to boast myself i'm
[2:29:18] talking about the quality and the
[2:29:20] content of the word i'm trying to bring
[2:29:21] you
[2:29:21] we need this in our lives to get us in a
[2:29:23] place to think
[2:29:25] to examine ourself whether i'm in the
[2:29:29] faith like i should be or not
[2:29:34] how many times have you seen somebody
[2:29:36] come and say lord
[2:29:38] i want deliverance so badly you see they
[2:29:41] say the words
[2:29:43] but god never gives them the key
[2:29:47] he can't trust us until we're willing to
[2:29:49] say lord i'll go all the way.
[2:29:53] all the way if there's any shortage
[2:29:56] or stopping short it's only because
[2:29:59] we've never opened ourself
[2:30:00] up to let him show us
[2:30:05] how to get through the door
[2:30:10] hallelujah
[2:30:13] brother branham is standing on the
[2:30:14] platform in minneapolis
[2:30:18] there's a blind girl that comes up and
[2:30:19] he says
[2:30:21] god is going to heal this blind girl
[2:30:26] he walks off the platform defeated
[2:30:31] because god never touched her eyes
[2:30:34] he said then i realized that i was
[2:30:37] making a challenge that not even jesus
[2:30:39] christ himself made
[2:30:42] he always asked him dost thou believe
[2:30:47] he never commanded it he based it on
[2:30:49] your faith
[2:30:51] even sitting right here tonight many of
[2:30:53] the struggles that you're up against and
[2:30:54] the answers that you're wanting
[2:30:56] and the things you can't seem to
[2:30:57] accomplish they're not the lacking of
[2:30:59] the holy spirit wanting to give you this
[2:31:02] it's the lacking of you not wanting to
[2:31:04] go all the way
[2:31:06] and open your heart and your spirit up
[2:31:08] to say god i'll go all the way whatever
[2:31:09] it takes
[2:31:12] that's why when you come to this altar
[2:31:13] and you come and you pray and you ask
[2:31:15] god into your heart you better mean
[2:31:16] business
[2:31:18] because if not you'll walk away of
[2:31:19] failure
[2:31:22] you'll walk away defeated he's not going
[2:31:25] to hand you the key
[2:31:27] all right now here's the holy ghost
[2:31:28] here's power here's authority go take
[2:31:30] over
[2:31:30] over the kingdom of hell kick open the
[2:31:32] door and and slap the devil in the teeth
[2:31:35] he's not going to hand this over to you
[2:31:36] unless you're willing
[2:31:38] to go all the way as i said it's not
[2:31:41] when you accept the holy ghost
[2:31:43] it's when the holy ghost accepts you
[2:31:46] amen
[2:31:46] in order for him to seal us he must see
[2:31:50] that our attitude is correct
[2:31:54] that we'll serve him without a question
[2:31:56] that will sell out everything
[2:31:57] amen you know when i received the holy
[2:32:00] ghost
[2:32:02] i had given my heart to the lord at 12
[2:32:05] and
[2:32:06] wandered around a bit as a sinner not
[2:32:07] really knowing exactly what it was all
[2:32:09] about and the
[2:32:10] day i give my heart to the lord and i
[2:32:12] receive the holy ghost
[2:32:14] i'd hear preachers many times after that
[2:32:16] saying you've got to understand truth
[2:32:18] you've got to understand the message
[2:32:19] i didn't even understand why i was
[2:32:20] walking to the front right
[2:32:24] but when i got out of that seat and i
[2:32:25] walked up there to give my heart to the
[2:32:27] lord i learned many years later the
[2:32:28] reason he filled me with the holy ghost
[2:32:30] is because when i walked to the front
[2:32:32] i had one attitude on my heart whatever
[2:32:34] you want lord is what i want
[2:32:40] remember the true power of a child of
[2:32:42] god lay in their surrender
[2:32:49] let me say that one more time the true
[2:32:51] power
[2:32:52] of a believer lay
[2:32:55] within their surrender amen
[2:32:59] not how much you can hold on to
[2:33:03] how much you're willing to turn loose
[2:33:13] listen to this brother said being alone
[2:33:16] many times i've climbed up in the
[2:33:19] he said many of the men that were with
[2:33:21] me thought i was going hunting he said
[2:33:22] but i'd get up there and sit down on a
[2:33:24] rock and look to the sky
[2:33:26] until my whole inner being seemed to be
[2:33:28] filled with something
[2:33:30] the world just seemed to pass away those
[2:33:32] precious hours alone with
[2:33:34] god listen to these words it's in there
[2:33:37] glory where the greatest revelation and
[2:33:40] inspiration comes
[2:33:44] many people think brother ram god is
[2:33:46] great inspiration from reading the bible
[2:33:47] he did not
[2:33:49] many people think that brother branham
[2:33:51] got his great inspirations by
[2:33:53] understanding mysteries and doctrines
[2:33:55] from the bible he did not
[2:34:04] he said if we'd take more time with that
[2:34:06] i'm sure we would live a better life
[2:34:09] a more victorious life in christ do you
[2:34:13] realize a man that a woman and a woman
[2:34:14] that is prayed up
[2:34:16] could never commit adultery a man a
[2:34:19] woman that has prayed up could never
[2:34:21] backslide yes
[2:34:26] it's whenever that thing begins to lack
[2:34:28] in our life when those things come in
[2:34:31] sure when people start sliding back look
[2:34:33] what's the first thing they give up on
[2:34:36] that communication between demon god
[2:34:40] if the devil can get some of you here to
[2:34:42] believe tonight that the lord is not
[2:34:44] interested in your prayers
[2:34:50] it don't matter how much you read the
[2:34:51] bible how much you come to church how
[2:34:52] much you quote mysteries
[2:34:54] if he ever cuts that part off
[2:34:57] he cuts off inspiration he cuts off
[2:35:00] revelation
[2:35:02] come on now
[2:35:05] notice in matthew chapter 6 verse 6
[2:35:07] jesus said when thou prayers
[2:35:08] enter into thy closet
[2:35:12] when thou hast shut the door pray to thy
[2:35:13] father which is in secret
[2:35:16] and thy father would see it then secret
[2:35:18] shall rewardly open the openly remember
[2:35:19] this is the scripture
[2:35:20] that the angel of the lord quotes to
[2:35:22] brother branham when he tells him in
[2:35:24] that tent vision i'll meet you in that
[2:35:25] little room that'll be the third pool
[2:35:28] this is what he quotes to him that's
[2:35:29] right
[2:35:32] how did all of them great things take
[2:35:34] place with brother brown
[2:35:36] oh i know i know your question to me
[2:35:38] when i said didn't come from the bible
[2:35:39] you just hold your horses a minute
[2:35:41] because i'm going to read it to you out
[2:35:42] of his own mouth
[2:35:45] when he was walking through that storm
[2:35:47] in colorado
[2:35:48] what scripture was he quoting what
[2:35:51] revelation was he studying
[2:35:54] he was trying to get out of there and a
[2:35:58] voice spoke to him
[2:35:59] go back up go back
[2:36:02] up brother man was a hunter he knew that
[2:36:05] first few snowflakes was the warning
[2:36:06] shot get out of there now
[2:36:09] but he said i know that voice
[2:36:13] it had spoke to me all my life
[2:36:16] he had never led me wrong
[2:36:20] oh thank god for an obedient man that
[2:36:23] knew how to listen to the voice of god
[2:36:29] he said so i turned around i headed back
[2:36:31] up the mountain
[2:36:34] and a voice come speak to it
[2:36:37] right you all reckon that brother brown
[2:36:39] was sitting with his bible open his
[2:36:41] pencil
[2:36:41] two plus two is four two plus two is
[2:36:43] four writing down the statute of a
[2:36:44] perfect man
[2:36:45] while he was trekking up the snow and
[2:36:46] the snow getting up to his knees and his
[2:36:48] ankles and
[2:36:49] up to up to his waist and and and he's
[2:36:51] he knows in his spirit he's
[2:36:53] feels that death is coming on and he's
[2:36:55] going to freeze to death
[2:36:56] y'all reckon he was going to see the red
[2:36:58] horse rider was
[2:37:00] that was the devil in those church ages
[2:37:03] murdering them
[2:37:04] saints yes uh what all wrecking brother
[2:37:06] brown was doing going up the mountain
[2:37:08] praying lord
[2:37:12] he said that when he got up around a
[2:37:13] certain spot by a tree the voice come i
[2:37:16] am the creator of the heavens and the
[2:37:17] earth
[2:37:20] [Music]
[2:37:22] god said here you go now speak to it
[2:37:29] he said he come down into town he said
[2:37:30] his beard all growed out covered in
[2:37:32] squirrel blood and said this old boy got
[2:37:33] to talk and said you know there was
[2:37:34] supposed to be a big storm coming
[2:37:36] through here
[2:37:37] all of a sudden it disappeared
[2:37:40] i imagine brother brown probably just
[2:37:42] went yep i heard about that
[2:37:50] you are into god there's no way you
[2:37:54] could have convinced brother branham
[2:37:55] that it didn't happen
[2:37:58] just like with the event of the cloud
[2:37:59] where jeff jenkins and the rest of these
[2:38:01] guys ran around calling it rocket ship
[2:38:02] smoke
[2:38:03] i don't care what they say when that
[2:38:06] prophet of god was standing there in
[2:38:08] that vision
[2:38:09] and he saw those angels of the lord
[2:38:14] may not even have known that it even
[2:38:16] took place out there in arizona
[2:38:18] but when he saw the photo in life
[2:38:20] magazine
[2:38:22] he said that it's what the lord showed
[2:38:26] me
[2:38:33] in arizona there's a brother by the name
[2:38:35] of doug baker
[2:38:37] if you need his address and telephone
[2:38:38] number i'll let you write him or email
[2:38:40] him or i'll let you contact him yourself
[2:38:41] let doug tell you
[2:38:43] we was heading up the mountain arizona
[2:38:44] we was talking about this event
[2:38:46] jeff down there in lima just made this
[2:38:49] decoration and we were talking about
[2:38:50] that thing you know it went around the
[2:38:51] world
[2:38:52] and and i said a little thing about it
[2:38:55] and doug said
[2:38:56] my rocket won't do that yeah i said
[2:39:00] your rocket he said i was the lead
[2:39:02] engineer
[2:39:03] of the thor missile that's right he said
[2:39:05] my rocket won't do that
[2:39:07] it won't hold a shape like that i like
[2:39:09] what chad lamb said
[2:39:11] he said it won't hold a shape like that
[2:39:13] a perfect shape for the space of a half
[2:39:14] an hour and then go 200 or 77 miles all
[2:39:17] the way down
[2:39:19] holding its perfect shape when brother
[2:39:22] branham saw it it was something that god
[2:39:25] had showed him
[2:39:26] in a vision in 1962.
[2:39:28] [Music]
[2:39:30] and if that prophet was standing here
[2:39:32] today they could bring up all the
[2:39:33] evidence as they want
[2:39:34] but when he saw those 16 men fall off
[2:39:37] that bridge he knew that was going to
[2:39:38] happen
[2:39:41] if brother brown was here he may not be
[2:39:43] able to explain it himself
[2:39:45] but god showed him the understanding of
[2:39:46] it now listen i'm not trying to make
[2:39:47] this a sermon about how great brother
[2:39:49] branham was i'm using these examples to
[2:39:50] get a message to you
[2:39:53] that if we can ever get ourselves alone
[2:39:55] with the lord on these little things in
[2:39:57] our lives
[2:39:58] about how we can open up this mystery or
[2:40:01] that mystery
[2:40:02] if we will find that same place of
[2:40:04] surrender
[2:40:05] oh god i wish somebody would hear me
[2:40:08] tonight
[2:40:09] if we could ever find that same place of
[2:40:12] surrender
[2:40:15] god would give us the same key
[2:40:19] that he gave to brother brett don't
[2:40:21] forget in the old testament the wave
[2:40:23] sheath when the priest would take a
[2:40:24] piece of corn
[2:40:25] whatever it might have been and wave it
[2:40:27] before the people it was testifying
[2:40:29] that everything in the field would be
[2:40:31] just like that one right there
[2:40:39] in the message testimony 19-50 he said
[2:40:41] my heart's been stirred for a long time
[2:40:43] he said i know we're ready for something
[2:40:45] he said now you come in you christians
[2:40:47] don't stay in a lukewarm condition
[2:40:49] anymore
[2:40:51] get as close to god as you can walk with
[2:40:53] him talk with him
[2:40:55] let everything be secondary
[2:40:58] but your prayer life
[2:41:03] now you say brother ben are you living
[2:41:05] this no no i'm really not
[2:41:07] there are things that get in my way just
[2:41:09] like they get in your way
[2:41:11] there are things that interrupt me just
[2:41:13] like they interrupt you
[2:41:14] but this is what brother venom said this
[2:41:17] is what the bible taught us to pray
[2:41:18] without ceasing
[2:41:19] and i believe if god said it we have a
[2:41:22] way
[2:41:22] of being able to possess it praise the
[2:41:25] lord
[2:41:27] thank you jesus absolutely god has not
[2:41:30] left us without the ability to perform
[2:41:32] his word
[2:41:33] thank you jesus
[2:41:39] he said if we'd only get alone with the
[2:41:41] quietness of the night
[2:41:44] oh how the dew would fall and refresh us
[2:41:47] if we'd only get quiet and alone with
[2:41:49] god how the dew would strengthen us
[2:41:51] listen to this
[2:41:52] take all the wilt out of us yes
[2:41:57] you ever see somebody that's in that
[2:41:58] kind of condition even when they come to
[2:42:01] church they sit all wilty like
[2:42:06] saints can be worshiping people can be
[2:42:08] rejoiced and stand on their feet
[2:42:09] clapping their hands hollering amen
[2:42:11] and they're just sitting there like
[2:42:15] that's wilty you need some water to make
[2:42:17] you a little alive
[2:42:18] a little fresh how do you get there
[2:42:22] by the power of prayer
[2:42:28] brethren said and knoweth it not the
[2:42:29] higher you rise in god
[2:42:32] the more sinful this whole thing looks
[2:42:38] sometimes in prayer you can imagine when
[2:42:40] the holy spirit he says takes you into a
[2:42:41] spear
[2:42:43] the whole thing looks like chaos and
[2:42:44] then when you come back down
[2:42:46] glory seem to the people like you're a
[2:42:49] rascal
[2:42:50] nothing but an old sarcastic a fool
[2:42:53] stand as an old
[2:42:54] crank always rebuking the people but if
[2:42:55] you ever climb into them
[2:42:57] spears one time
[2:43:02] when in the presence of god not through
[2:43:03] emotion but through the genuine holy
[2:43:05] spirit lifting up
[2:43:07] he said you can see that the whole thing
[2:43:09] ichabod is rode and the glory of the
[2:43:11] lord is departed over the whole
[2:43:12] denominational outfit
[2:43:18] blind bartimaeus i want you to notice
[2:43:20] elijah said went into the room
[2:43:22] where the baby was lying shut the door
[2:43:23] behind him just he and the baby that's
[2:43:25] where the most successful times
[2:43:28] is when you get alone with god yes
[2:43:31] how many wants to be successful even you
[2:43:34] people that don't think you can be
[2:43:35] successful
[2:43:36] how many want to be
[2:43:39] now why do i see hands still down
[2:43:43] honestly you mean you don't want to be
[2:43:45] successful you mean you don't want to
[2:43:46] win
[2:43:48] you don't want to win the battle well
[2:43:50] brother ben
[2:43:51] i i i'm not able to you're right there
[2:43:56] but if i want to be successful
[2:43:59] my success doesn't come by my strength
[2:44:02] and my knowledge of the word
[2:44:05] praise god somebody my strength my
[2:44:08] ability
[2:44:09] to win the battle my success
[2:44:14] comes from my surrendered prayer life
[2:44:20] friend could you imagine the devil works
[2:44:23] for months to set a trap for you
[2:44:26] puts this person in your way puts that
[2:44:27] person your way puts this circumstance
[2:44:29] he lets this wheel turn for that cog and
[2:44:31] then that cog connects with this over
[2:44:33] here and
[2:44:33] on and on and here you're at the perfect
[2:44:35] spot where satan thinks i've got him
[2:44:40] and somehow another instead of you
[2:44:42] making a left turn
[2:44:43] like he expected yeah you make a right
[2:44:45] one
[2:44:50] and i imagine the devil probably said
[2:44:52] how did they know that was coming
[2:45:04] this is where you'll hear preachers say
[2:45:06] we have the real
[2:45:08] key to overcoming
[2:45:13] because whenever god moves on me and
[2:45:16] tells me
[2:45:17] watch out boy don't go to that certain
[2:45:20] place this weekend don't go to that
[2:45:21] certain church don't go to that certain
[2:45:23] individual
[2:45:23] stay away from that certain spot
[2:45:28] he says it's a quality the devil didn't
[2:45:29] even hear him whispering
[2:45:32] hallelujah and that dumb stupid ignorant
[2:45:34] amen blind deaf devil
[2:45:37] dumb devil he thinks he's got you
[2:45:40] whipped but what he doesn't know is
[2:45:43] before he set the trap
[2:45:46] god had already given you the key
[2:45:54] prayer is a sincere thing he said prayer
[2:45:56] is talking to god
[2:45:58] prayers not get down shut your eyes
[2:46:00] think about your washing your work
[2:46:01] you're doing
[2:46:02] you see if you're if you're in such a
[2:46:04] mode you are not in prayer
[2:46:06] if your mind is on other things you are
[2:46:08] not in prayer though your lips may be
[2:46:10] moving though you may be
[2:46:11] performing and and executing the action
[2:46:14] of prayer
[2:46:15] you are not in prayer if your mind and
[2:46:17] your heart is not engaged
[2:46:22] amen let's not get down lord help me and
[2:46:24] john and miss jones and so forth that's
[2:46:25] not
[2:46:26] prayer that's repeating words
[2:46:29] oh you know how we do lord you said on
[2:46:32] chapter 1
[2:46:33] of page 4 of volume 12 and the prophet
[2:46:36] said y'all reckon god didn't know that
[2:46:38] when he wrote it
[2:46:42] don't reckon he didn't know his word
[2:46:45] we spend so much time trying to impress
[2:46:47] him by how smart we are
[2:46:49] like a bunch of kids trying to impress
[2:46:51] daddy
[2:46:52] when what we should do is just go in
[2:46:54] there and speak to him
[2:46:56] exactly what is in our mind and exactly
[2:46:59] what is in their heart
[2:47:01] let me model it for you when i go to
[2:47:03] prayer and i'm
[2:47:04] angry about something i just tell the
[2:47:06] lord i am so mad
[2:47:07] i could kill. you say you don't
[2:47:11] he knows it anyways why should i lie
[2:47:16] come on i mean brother if i go into the
[2:47:19] prayer concert hall no nothing to see
[2:47:21] here
[2:47:21] everything is fine i'm all right now i'm
[2:47:25] fine lord i love him anyways
[2:47:28] he knows i'm a lying snake in the grass
[2:47:36] why should i tell him something he knows
[2:47:39] ain't right
[2:47:41] [Music]
[2:47:43] if i'm trouble if i'm bothered if i'm
[2:47:46] under a temptation
[2:47:48] if i'm discouraged i just go in the room
[2:47:50] and i tell him lord
[2:47:51] sometimes right and i love i love in one
[2:47:53] way i love this mass thing because i can
[2:47:55] pray
[2:47:55] and people don't know i'm praying and
[2:47:58] the bluetooth age of technology they
[2:48:00] don't know whether i've got an earbud
[2:48:02] or nothing so i just go down through the
[2:48:04] airport talking to the lord
[2:48:07] i heard somebody say one time that guy
[2:48:09] must be on the call of his life he's
[2:48:11] having a good time
[2:48:14] oh i thought yeah i got a phone call all
[2:48:17] right
[2:48:18] i'm on that town
[2:48:21] i'm talking on the royal telephone
[2:48:31] thank you jesus if i'm under temptation
[2:48:34] i just tell him god
[2:48:36] yes i don't know if i can whip that one
[2:48:38] or not
[2:48:40] it's too much to my tell him sometimes
[2:48:42] it's too much of what i want
[2:48:44] here i don't know if i can whip that one
[2:48:47] or not
[2:48:49] i guarantee you if you started having
[2:48:51] some real honesty in prayer
[2:48:53] and just being blunt brutal honest with
[2:48:55] him
[2:48:57] i bet you'd hear him talk to you a lot
[2:48:58] more
[2:49:00] i'm going to say something forgive me if
[2:49:02] this sounds ugly
[2:49:04] but it i'm ashamed of people in this
[2:49:05] message that don't believe that god can
[2:49:07] even talk to him anymore
[2:49:11] i guarantee you one thing if you have a
[2:49:14] relationship with him
[2:49:16] and you really get in the right
[2:49:17] atmosphere you can hear him speaking to
[2:49:20] you
[2:49:23] when i moved to tennessee it's been 17
[2:49:26] years now
[2:49:27] i had a good job my wife had a good job
[2:49:31] we was in a very very good position
[2:49:34] and i was invited to come to tennessee
[2:49:37] all i'd ever known in my life was my
[2:49:38] ohio home my high family
[2:49:41] the lord spoke to me to go to tennessee
[2:49:44] i told him no all my people were
[2:49:47] gunslingers and bank robbers all of them
[2:49:48] down from the south
[2:49:50] i said no i'm not going to that bunch of
[2:49:51] people tell you what six months later
[2:49:53] i found out you don't tell god no
[2:49:57] he beat me within an inch of my life
[2:50:00] everything failed
[2:50:01] all the stuff that was going right
[2:50:03] started going wrong
[2:50:05] and i was up on top of a wood trailer
[2:50:07] one time or semi trailer taking wood
[2:50:08] skids and throwing them down on the side
[2:50:10] like that
[2:50:11] and everything had kind of stopped you
[2:50:13] know what i mean all the bad had just
[2:50:15] and everything had been going good the
[2:50:16] last couple days and it dawned on me
[2:50:18] and all of a suds like the lord said to
[2:50:20] me decision time boy
[2:50:24] and i fell on my face and i said lord
[2:50:26] why are you making me leave here
[2:50:28] this is all i've ever known i heard him
[2:50:30] speak to me like this i have need of you
[2:50:32] there
[2:50:34] when i moved to tennessee it wasn't six
[2:50:36] months
[2:50:37] before god kicked the doors off of the
[2:50:39] world
[2:50:40] and before i knew it i had a worldwide
[2:50:43] ministry preaching around
[2:50:44] and around the world at least one time
[2:50:45] in my life i did not know
[2:50:47] i was so ignorant and so foolish when i
[2:50:50] left my job in ohio
[2:50:51] i come to tennessee and started looking
[2:50:53] for another job just like the one i left
[2:50:54] that's smart isn't it
[2:50:57] god tell you to leave one job just to
[2:50:58] what go down to another state and work
[2:51:00] the same thing all over again
[2:51:02] it goes to prove you don't always
[2:51:03] understand where he's leading you
[2:51:06] but when i heard him say the words to me
[2:51:07] because i have need of you there
[2:51:10] that's what settled it for me because i
[2:51:12] thought god if you need me
[2:51:14] i want to be of service to you then amen
[2:51:17] when i showed up shortly thereafter this
[2:51:20] brother connected with that brother that
[2:51:21] one connected with that one people say
[2:51:23] oh your pastor's brother care well i
[2:51:25] know brother carol anybody's all right
[2:51:26] brother carol army why don't you come
[2:51:27] preach for me
[2:51:30] next thing i know i've been around and
[2:51:31] around and around over two million miles
[2:51:35] my father looked me in the face and said
[2:51:37] you'll be bankrupt in six months
[2:51:39] my family disagreed with every move i
[2:51:42] made
[2:51:44] the fact that i left my job was a a
[2:51:46] topic of disdain and disgust
[2:51:49] for years after i moved to tennessee
[2:51:52] i heard more ridicule from people saying
[2:51:54] why did you make such a stupid move
[2:51:57] and then after i got there it wasn't a
[2:51:59] bowl of roses either
[2:52:01] i started preaching the gospel to a
[2:52:02] bunch of sinful people that didn't want
[2:52:04] to live right
[2:52:04] and and experience some of the greatest
[2:52:07] persecution
[2:52:08] i had ever went through in my life but
[2:52:11] you know i held on 15 years
[2:52:14] that voice on top that trailer when i
[2:52:15] was praying
[2:52:17] i have need of you there and until he
[2:52:20] tells me he don't need me anymore that's
[2:52:22] where i belong
[2:52:25] i'm trying to tell you something brother
[2:52:27] i'm trying to tell you
[2:52:28] that if you can ever get to a spot to
[2:52:30] where you hear from god
[2:52:32] it don't matter if it's like moses at 80
[2:52:35] years old
[2:52:36] and the holy ghost tells this old man
[2:52:38] with his bald head and his long beard
[2:52:40] and his high high-tempered wife go down
[2:52:42] there to egypt and
[2:52:43] take over he come walking in and step
[2:52:47] right up in front of pharaoh and all the
[2:52:49] rest of them
[2:52:50] let my people go you know why that he
[2:52:53] was able to stand there on the face of a
[2:52:55] nation
[2:52:56] and defy the politics of the day defy
[2:52:59] the kingship of the day
[2:53:00] defy all of the ruling authorities of
[2:53:02] that day
[2:53:04] because he was on the backside of the
[2:53:05] desert
[2:53:07] when that voice spoke to him in prayer
[2:53:11] i'm going to deliver my children i'm
[2:53:12] using you to do it
[2:53:17] there are absolutes in our life that
[2:53:20] anchor us
[2:53:22] sister that man you're married to if you
[2:53:23] know that you're a husband there's not a
[2:53:25] man in the world that could entice you
[2:53:26] to pull it away from him
[2:53:28] amen no there's not a man in the world
[2:53:30] vice versa brother if she's really the
[2:53:31] one for you there's not a woman in this
[2:53:33] world
[2:53:34] oh you may you may have thoughts huh a
[2:53:36] vice versa
[2:53:38] people may say things that sound good
[2:53:40] you may feel tempted
[2:53:41] but there's an anchor on the inside of a
[2:53:43] man that really loves a woman and vice
[2:53:44] versa
[2:53:46] that when the rubber meets the road they
[2:53:47] say are you crazy
[2:53:50] i try to live in such a manner that i
[2:53:52] treat my wife as good as i know how to
[2:53:53] treat her
[2:53:54] i try to treat her as so blessed that if
[2:53:56] another man tried to come up and fool
[2:53:57] with her she'd take one look at him and
[2:53:59] the devil and say are you crazy you know
[2:54:00] how good i got it back here
[2:54:10] let me go a bit further let's close i'm
[2:54:13] not picking it up tomorrow i'm going to
[2:54:15] finish it
[2:54:15] so here we are i don't know when i'll
[2:54:19] get back
[2:54:20] to you so i'm just going to take the
[2:54:21] time you just settle in and just enjoy
[2:54:23] it
[2:54:25] we're not enjoyed either way we're going
[2:54:26] on
[2:54:29] oh listen to this brother bam said
[2:54:31] prayers when you come into an atmosphere
[2:54:33] that you realize you're in the presence
[2:54:35] of god
[2:54:36] you're moving into the deepest of
[2:54:38] sincerity then
[2:54:39] first you say a little worship oh
[2:54:41] jehovah
[2:54:44] then after the worship of prayer you
[2:54:46] come with a sincere heart
[2:54:48] asking amen and jude verse 20 beloved
[2:54:52] build up yourselves on your most holy
[2:54:53] faith
[2:54:54] praying amen in the holy ghost
[2:55:00] so not just praying one of the first
[2:55:04] places i was privileged to go in my
[2:55:05] travels was oru
[2:55:07] or roberts university tulsa oklahoma
[2:55:10] to me you might as well just took me
[2:55:12] through the white house to get to step
[2:55:13] on oral roberts's campus out there and
[2:55:15] to go up to the prayer tower
[2:55:17] you know if you've ever seen it it's the
[2:55:18] big round crown of thorns they
[2:55:20] designed it like the crown of thorns for
[2:55:22] jesus and you get in this little
[2:55:24] elevator and you go up now friends
[2:55:26] i don't stumble at this but i got on
[2:55:28] that elevator and me and this pastor we
[2:55:30] went up to the top of that elevator and
[2:55:31] before the doors open i could feel an
[2:55:33] atmosphere where people have been
[2:55:34] praying in there
[2:55:36] sure but that don't always mean that
[2:55:39] god's the one listening
[2:55:42] there's a difference between praying and
[2:55:45] praying in the holy ghost
[2:55:48] somebody told me about mother teresa you
[2:55:51] know
[2:55:51] and i don't mean to throw off on the
[2:55:53] woman she's gone to her reward now but
[2:55:54] they said what a praying woman she was i
[2:55:56] said yes
[2:55:57] but who did all the talking
[2:56:01] here's the question is prayer us coming
[2:56:04] into a place and saying god
[2:56:05] i want this and i want that and i
[2:56:07] believe this and i believe that or his
[2:56:08] prayer thing
[2:56:09] where we just wait on the lord father
[2:56:11] you see the question in my heart you
[2:56:13] know you don't even have to say a word
[2:56:14] sometimes
[2:56:16] just walk in there and just raise your
[2:56:18] hands up and say here i am
[2:56:20] and he knows the answer to what you have
[2:56:24] if you'll just let him lead you step by
[2:56:27] step
[2:56:30] last one brother baby said remember an
[2:56:32] astronaut
[2:56:33] is controlled by a radar power that's
[2:56:36] right
[2:56:38] that's right and we've got radar too
[2:56:43] prayer amen
[2:56:47] prayer is the radar that directs the
[2:56:50] astronauts
[2:56:52] amen watch the way the prayer is going
[2:56:57] and you can see the way he's pointing
[2:57:00] okay
[2:57:04] watch the way the church is praying
[2:57:07] and you can see the way the missiles
[2:57:09] will fly glory
[2:57:11] you can tell by the way the astronauts
[2:57:12] are traveling by the way that the church
[2:57:15] is praying again
[2:57:19] brother banham said now listen to this
[2:57:20] last statement i want to thank each one
[2:57:22] of you you said for singing that song a
[2:57:24] few moments ago for you i'm praying he
[2:57:26] said that's what i want you to do
[2:57:28] it's prayer that i depend on that's the
[2:57:31] secret of all the mysteries
[2:57:36] of god
[2:57:39] that's the key
[2:57:44] that opens the door to everything of god
[2:57:48] is prayer
[2:57:55] and he goes on us a little while talking
[2:57:56] about
[2:57:59] that's how he gets his message as he
[2:58:00] said a little bit ago you thought when i
[2:58:03] said you didn't get it from the bible
[2:58:05] this is where you need to understand
[2:58:07] before brother branham cracked the
[2:58:08] scripture open
[2:58:10] he got along with god and started
[2:58:11] praying he tells us in stature perfect
[2:58:14] man october 62 if you want to look it up
[2:58:16] he said i went up there and lean up
[2:58:18] against the tree before daylight he said
[2:58:19] i've got a pencil in my pocket
[2:58:21] he said waiting on the lord he said it
[2:58:22] comes two plus two is four
[2:58:24] faster two plus two is four faster two
[2:58:27] plus two four two
[2:58:28] four he said all sudden the holy spirit
[2:58:29] will open it up
[2:58:31] he said then i get my bible out and go
[2:58:32] check it all out is all right brother
[2:58:34] neville get them together at the
[2:58:35] tabernacle the lord's give us a message
[2:58:38] that's how brother branham knew what the
[2:58:40] mysteries of god was in this bible
[2:58:44] because he took time to pray
[2:58:52] friends
[2:58:55] i believe that it is such an important
[2:58:57] thing
[2:58:59] that i would rather see a man or woman
[2:59:01] that knows how to pray
[2:59:04] than a man or woman that can memorize
[2:59:06] every scripture in the bible
[2:59:11] because many people can read the bible
[2:59:14] but without prayer you don't understand
[2:59:19] what you're reading you may be able to
[2:59:21] put it together mechanically
[2:59:23] but the actual message of it and how you
[2:59:26] fit into all of it will never be
[2:59:29] revealed to you
[2:59:31] until you can come to that sincere place
[2:59:32] of prayer
[2:59:34] where god can speak to your heart
[2:59:46] [Applause]
[2:59:55] let me show you how important it is
[2:59:58] jesus looks over the field of the
[3:00:00] harvest
[3:00:01] and it's white all these sons of god all
[3:00:04] these
[3:00:05] saints of god daughters of god and this
[3:00:09] is what jesus said to his disciples
[3:00:11] you pray to the lord of the harvest
[3:00:14] to send laborers into the field that's
[3:00:16] how important it was
[3:00:18] you pray i i mean i've got 12 pages here
[3:00:22] of one thing after another where paul
[3:00:25] would tell the people
[3:00:26] pray for us that god can give us a door
[3:00:29] of utterance
[3:00:31] when we go to certain places pray for us
[3:00:33] that god can give us favor
[3:00:38] it is the most important weapon that's
[3:00:41] ever been placed in our hands
[3:00:43] it's even more important in one
[3:00:45] direction and one way of looking at it
[3:00:47] it's more important than the bible
[3:00:48] in this regard you could memorize the
[3:00:51] scripture but without prayer you don't
[3:00:53] understand how to apply it
[3:00:55] so the bible alone just as the bible is
[3:00:58] without revelation
[3:00:59] it's just dead letter to you
[3:01:02] but listen friends this is this is my
[3:01:04] last remark but prayer
[3:01:07] takes you into the dynamics of what
[3:01:10] you're reading
[3:01:13] have you ever been there you got the
[3:01:15] bible open before you and
[3:01:17] all of a sudden
[3:01:22] oh i never saw that before
[3:01:26] don't you know what happened
[3:01:29] he stuck the key in the lock open up the
[3:01:32] door and went
[3:01:33] take a peek inside
[3:01:37] [Music]
[3:01:39] no wonder jesus said i am the door
[3:01:43] no man enters in except he comes
[3:01:47] by me
[3:01:50] let's pray
[3:01:54] [Music]
[3:01:56] heavenly father
[3:02:03] lord as the saints of god are
[3:02:06] bowing their heads over to you
[3:02:09] to the dust from which we've come
[3:02:17] one thing is absolutely clear tonight
[3:02:22] and that is you wanted every one of us
[3:02:24] to understand
[3:02:26] how powerful the weapon of prayer is
[3:02:30] to us individuals i pray tonight lord
[3:02:35] that you would let your holy spirit
[3:02:38] so wash over these elect tonight
[3:02:42] for those that aren't saved maybe not
[3:02:44] born again maybe not living where they
[3:02:46] should
[3:02:48] lord if they're if they're reaching that
[3:02:50] spot
[3:02:52] open the door to them i pray
[3:02:54] [Music]
[3:02:55] but if not god will you help them to
[3:02:58] come to that place to where the door can
[3:03:00] open up
[3:03:02] help them come to that spot so they can
[3:03:05] have their hand out
[3:03:06] and you put the key there
[3:03:10] for all of us believers here tonight
[3:03:13] lord there's areas of our life that i'm
[3:03:16] sure lord we're not completely satisfied
[3:03:18] with
[3:03:20] maybe there's mysteries there that we
[3:03:22] don't know the answers to
[3:03:25] but i pray
[3:03:28] that you'll help us to come to such a
[3:03:30] place of surrender
[3:03:32] until you can place in our hands
[3:03:36] the key that opens up the door granted
[3:03:38] lord
[3:03:40] in the name of jesus christ i pray
[3:03:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:03:54] oh bless the lord
