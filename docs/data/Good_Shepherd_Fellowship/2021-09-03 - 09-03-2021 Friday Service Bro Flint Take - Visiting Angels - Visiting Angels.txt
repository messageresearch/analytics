what faith [Music] i've through to trust in jesus i've learned to it trust i've learned to depend upon is depend upon god bless you all it's good to be in the house of the lord with you and uh it's nice to see all the changes you all have done a wonderful job around here amen and uh that's always a blessing when the house of the lord is taken well care of amen but not just that but each each heart and each life and uh so we're just glad to be here with you guys and for the wesley god bless you good to see you again brother steve uh you know the sister just singing that song through it all i mean we've been through some battles we've been through some hard times the older you get the longer you serve the lord you can look back and you know that you know god was with you and things weren't always so easy but now we have an understanding of why sometimes we have to go through those things is that right and you know it builds faith and if i didn't have a problem how would i know that he could solve them amen i i love that i love that uh i'm gonna set my watch over here i love that uh that verse there and uh you know we're just so grateful that god has called us and god has called us out of the chaos of this world and um it's because you know the world is getting pretty crazy and uh it's it's just um you know who knows but uh the thing of it is you know there even your pastor was mentioning tonight about geheza and elijah and he said that uh you know there was more of them amen with haze and elijah than there was against them and we know the story how elijah came out and the syrian army was coming down so all the circumstances everything you know it looked hopeless it looked like they were in a lot of trouble and gesa was standing there and and you know that's all he could see all he could see was the the army of syria and you know how would you be thinking how would you feel if that was you and all you could see is the army of syria and uh then geheza being a man of god and the man of faith and not just the man of god and a man of faith but a man whose eyes were open at that time and he's looking around and he's to him he's thinking do these boys really want to come against this army so he's looking at a different perspective he's seeing something different he's looking you know at the armies of heaven and all that are with them and he realizes that uh you know these guys are in trouble and then he says lord open the boy's eyes and then god does something very wonderful he opens the haze's eyes now from one instance all he could see was you know we're toast we're in trouble here and a second later his eyes are open and now you have to it's echoing or something but now you have to realize that it's just like sitting in this room right now we are seeing a room we're seeing brothers and sisters and we notice sister has so and so on tonight and brother has this and we've sung our songs and oh you musicians can be seated god bless you and um thank god for your musicians and the faithful men and women in this church for all these years so and uh you know we're sitting in this room tonight and all we can see right now mostly is just just the room but we know that according to the word of god and every word in the bible is true that we know that we're not the only ones here tonight if we believe the word and we always say yes i believe the word well we believe the word that means that if the word is true and where two or three are gathered there i would be in the midst and if god is there then there must be angels there and so then if god could open our eyes like he opened his eyes i believe that tonight we would literally see angels throughout this room but the problem is we're limited to these senses and so sometimes we just come to church we have problems where we don't feel the presence of god or whatever and we come to church and we're you know uh if we haven't really prayed up and whatnot is that right and it's just kind of going through the motions and this by god's grace we start worshiping the lord and then we start feeling the presence of the lord and amen but but whether we feel it don't feel it whether we see it or don't see it never changes the reality of god's word god's word is always true is that right and so now his eyes become open and now he's got a different perspective now he realizes something amen that they're not in trouble after all they're not they're not toast there's no problem here and now he's kind of interested and he's curious what's going to happen now he's looking at elijah going what is what are we going to do here now what's going to happen because he knows the outcome is going to be much different than what he thought it was going to be when he first came out amen praise the lord why don't we stand this evening and and we'll open up in the bibles here brother juan thank you for mentioning that about gehesa because i didn't know what to preach tonight i was like i'm toast [Music] come on lord help me amen genesis 18 and verse 1. so i just feel to just share a thought tonight on on the ministry of angels in genesis 18 and verse 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamrie and he sat in a tent door in the heat of the day so now remember now just don't read it too fast and the lord appeared elohim god in flesh the lord appeared the lord god walked on the earth in a flesh body with two angels and walked up to speak to abraham and he lift up his eyes and he looked and lo three men stood by him three men and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight past not away i pray thee from thy servant so heavenly father we pray lord that you would add the blessing to the reading of the word and but father tonight we pray that you'd help us to get out of the way that you'd preach the gospel lord through us that father we could hear lord god that you would hear the gospel through us and that father we could all have our faith lifted up into a higher realm that lord god as our prophet taught us through the scripture through the message lord that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and then lord god if we could have the right perspective lord god and father we could move oh god with faith in our heart that father whatever might be ailing us tonight whether it be sickness whether it be discouragement father whatever it might be lord god we know that lord you can come on the scene and father you can move in a mighty way we present all of our needs to you tonight father we are singing the song through it all lord god we have been through many battles and many trials lord god but father somehow you brought us through every single one of them but tonight lord we want to present our needs to you tonight lord whatever it might be the different ones that were prayed for tonight lord we ask that you would come down in the mighty way and father we ask that you would visit this little church here tonight lord in a mighty way that the holy spirit could move as you promised where two or three were gathered in your midst father you would be there and lord god that's why we are here tonight we're not here to hear a man orientate lord god but we are here because we want to hear from you lord and father we just happen to believe the gospel that you would preach through men we believe the gospel in simplicity lord god we know lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever you haven't changed and father if you wanted to preach through the stars you could have if you wanted to preach through tape decks you could have but lord you preached through men and father tonight we gather together around father's throne and pray lord god that you'd break the bread of life to our hearts lift this up a little higher give us a little unction in our step lord god edify the body of christ we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated so we realize now the lord the lord comes down he visits abraham and two angelic beings come with him but what they do is very interesting there god has the ability to make a human body and uh that's pretty wild isn't it uh yet yet if we believe the bible you know then we believe all of the bible and we know that if god if three men walked up before them then uh god literally took as brother brown said the polish of the earth and the chemicals of the earth and he made three bodies and he stepped into one and two angels stepped in with him and they walked up so if he could do it then he can do it now so then if if god if god walked up to this man abraham and and there were three men and he looked and he saw three men his perspective is looking at three men coming three strangers are coming up to him and as they're coming up to him he's looking at them but then as soon as that one speaks he recognizes the voice and he knows that's god because he already knew god he already walked with god he already had a relationship with god and so as soon as god spoke he went my lord he knows who he is amen so then we realize now that god is doing something why does god doesn't waste his time he doesn't just do whatever he has purposes for what he's doing and he comes down so he starts to visit he's visiting earth he's visiting this man on earth hebrews 13 2 tells us that to be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares isn't that interesting so do you mean to tell me that even maybe right now there could be angels walking around in men's bodies do you believe that it's true the bible said that everybody you might entertain angels unawares of course we also know that this scripture is referring to men and women of god that you know we're angelic beings in the fact that we're messengers not angelic beings we're messengers angels a messenger but these are angelic beings as well and so we don't know how many angels are on earth how many angels are moving where they're at and what they're doing we don't know that but what we do know is that they're here amen people want to believe in sasquatch oh they can believe in a sasquatch they can believe in ufos but it's more difficult we're talking about this this afternoon it's more difficult for them to believe in angelic beings amen but yet it's just like we know it's difficult for them to believe that god is real is that right praise the lord brother brown says from the anointed ones at the end time he said i wasn't the one who that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared praise the lord so brother down on the river amen the angel of the lord even visit him and excuse me just like when ezekiel one day you know he's down by the river chiba and he had a visitation from angelic beings is that right he saw the will in the middle of the will and he saw the cherubims and so brother brown was down he says i wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river i was only standing there when he appeared now he's referring of course to the pillar of fire when the pillar of fire appeared brother branham was there amen he said i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it praise the lord i was only a voice that he used i just say it it wasn't what i knew it it's what i just surrendered myself to yes that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not man it's not a man it's god praise the lord so we're not following a man we're following god not that brother brother is a man but we're following god the god that led brother branham he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man's words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen so now we realize that elohim amen step down to visit abraham is that right but now we also realize that elohim in the last days in the end time days even even job said i believe that my god will stand on earth and in the last days amen elohim he comes down and he displays himself through the messenger of the hour amen praise the lord do you believe that the son of man ministry amen okay i'm at home here i knew i was because i know what brother juan believes so in the son of man ministry amen god visits the church again jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen because it wasn't brother brown that could foretell those things it wasn't brother branham they could say your name is you're from address you're from this and that but god can do that god knows you god knows what you think god knows where you live god knows everything that's going on in your life and god cares about you god cares he's very interested and very concerned about your everyday life and he was able to tell him exactly where they came from who they were and everything about them praise the lord so my question is if we can believe that and we do believe that why is it that people struggle right now believers even struggle amen that angels can be part of our everyday life that angels can actually be all over the earth right now doing things amen and we know that they're appearing in the skies because brother branham told us those are and those are visited visitating angels praise the lord hallelujah so not that god is we don't want to ever start thinking that god is way beyond the milky way where's the kingdom of god at where's the heaven of god where's the where's the where is thank you brother steve he's patting the ark the ark the heart the heart is the ark the heart is the dwelling place of god god is here right now god is here in a many member body all over this church you brought god to church you brought god to church i brought god to church god is here amen so then therefore really i mean if we really want to go kind of crazy with it we can walk out we know that we are also when people greet us and talk to us i mean could you imagine if they really knew who we were if they really knew that god was living in us when you pull up at the hotel they wouldn't make you carry your own bags i mean the red carpet would come out and and i mean literally they would they would meet you there and and walk you in and oh yeah they would but the thing of it is they just don't know what's going on praise the lord so stay with me amen i'm only laying a foundation i want you just to stay with me so in this the message expectations brother brown says i believe that everyone that the angels of god watch over us how many believe that the angels of god are watching over you amen and a matter of fact you have an angel he says and i believe that jesus said their angels always behold the face of my father which is in heaven so you have a guardian angel brother brown told us he said when you're born again you've heard from your theophany and your theophany is a word body amen and you have a guardian angel you have angels watching over you praise the lord thank god for the token flying the token to the home amen creating an atmosphere where god is happy to dwell and the angels of god are there amen so the angel of the lord he was with continually with brother branham and he told brother branham i have come from the presence of the lord is that right so now we know that at least i know that many people have seen angels i've talked to brothers that have seen angels i've talked to believers that have seen the pillar of fire and they're and angels are a real part of our life they work for the lord amen and brother battle went so far this is how much he walked in that super natural realm and saw angels and he there's a lot of visit him all the time and he he makes a statement he says that if you would keep your mind if the believers would keep their mind on the lord and on angels and the supernatural he said angels would appear to them to you he said so angels are here but they're in a faster dimension so here we are in the third dimension time light timer matter we're in the third dimension and our eyes are limited to only see a certain portion of the of the light spectrum we can only see so much but there's a fourth dimension a fifth dimension a sixth dimension in the seventh dimension but we can't see into them so then therefore god has given us something that we might tap into those dimensions and that is called faith and that's why it's so important for us to believe what we hear to believe the word of god i mean to believe the message it's so important for us not to be looking at circumstances so much amen but to be able to look beyond the circumstances look beyond the heart you know the trials of life and be able to think now wait a second this is not the end this is not the final story amen there is a god present there is a god here that can help me just like when when uh daniel got thrown in the lion's den amen it was it was certain death but yet then the lord came down and closed the mouth of the lion an angel came in his time of need from this day the scripture is fulfilled brother brown says look hanging in washington dc tonight is the picture of the angel of the lord do you believe that picture is actually a picture of the angel of the lord amen i do i believe it's the pillar of fire and i believe it's the angel of the lord and i believe it's a picture i mean as he was in the light right you understand luke let's look in luke chapter one hallelujah luke 1 and verse 26. well i like this bible big letters luke 20 luke 1 chap chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to ver to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou art thou that art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation should this be and the angel said unto her fear not mary now remember now we're reading about an angel talking to a human being we're sitting here reading about a a girl named mary and there's an angel standing there talking to her and if he's the same yesterday today and forever this might help you there's a brother and i don't know if you heard his testimony and i can't i don't even remember his name but he was in far east siberia and he was looking he had got some message books of brother branham and he was reading them and he was looking for them and oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm ahead of myself he was praying lord i want to know the truth help me know the truth and the night that he went to bed i might have shared this before but i don't know but the night that he went to bed all of a sudden he got woke up because something was pulling his hair and he got up and he looked and went back to sleep same thing happened again something was pulling his hair he woke up again and when he woke up there was a light shining on the wall and the name william marion branham was on the wall and the angel was there and the angel told him find william marion branham and sometime went by and he got invited to some meetings and that's when he had found some message books and got invited some meetings and he was in uh over back over there by the ukraine area i believe it was and brother lonnie jenkins was there and brother lonnie jenkins was given his was ministering and every time he would say the name william branham or brother branham this guy would jump up and excited wow and so he went to him and asked him he said why are you so excited it seemed like every time i mentioned brother brown's name you jump up and he told him this testimony i was praying for the truth and an angel met me an angel came to him and woke him up and shook his head and said go find this messenger are you with me so then there therefore we know that there are angels amen all around amen sometimes when you feel the presence of the lord i remember i was sitting there and and and brother uh uh uh billy paul was was testifying and he was he was saying every time since i saw the angel he tells about how he saw the angel you remember the story when brother branham was there and the angel of the lord was in the room and he said can i wake up my son to see you and he said yes can i wake up my brother he said no can i wake up my son he woke up brother billy paul he put the pillow by billy paul's head and he said uh son the angel that daddy's told you about you remember the angel how i told you about the angel yeah he goes well he's standing in the corner over there and he says i'm gonna remove the pillow and you look he removed the pillow and when he looked billy paul grabbed his dad and just shook and his dad said son don't worry he won't hurt you and billy paul said there was a man he didn't have wings he was standing there in the corner by the window and he was about six foot tall and he had blonde hair amen and the light was glaring radiating off of him you know how many remember the story and then all of a sudden he said the angel turned into like a pillar of fire like a light and it went out the window yeah amen and so he was telling that story and then he made the statement he was saying and ever since i've seen that angel i know when he's here praise the lord and i was sitting there thinking because the presence of the lord was very strong and i was thinking he's here i can sense him he's here and then all of a sudden billy paul says and he's here amen so what am i saying this is what i'm saying that there are people that can see angels and there are angelic activity and there are things that happen amen and i can go into story after story about different believers seeing this pillar of fire this one was preaching the pillar of fire amen i was i was testifying to my brother one time he said i saw the pillar of fire all around you amen and so what what i'm saying is that there's another realm that we don't always see but we can always enter it through faith we don't always see it we can't maybe always sense it with our sight our feelings and everything but we know it's there and we have been given the access to enter into that atmosphere through faith because everything in that kingdom operates through faith and praise the lord amen so now here's this angel speaking to mary in verse 30. and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and so call his name jesus verse 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall these how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born in thee shall be called the son of god. and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to that word and the angel departed from her matthew chapter 1. we're just reading scriptures about angels angels visiting people angels talking to people matthew 1 18. the lord jesus amen that's birth now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was a spouse to joseph before they came together she was found child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband but god can do anything yes how does he put how does he implant a seed into a wound he can do it do you believe that brother wesley is the lord god can put a seed in a woman and make and take a virgin and bring forth a child an angel because because god is real and because god is here and he can send down an angel and and the angel can go talk to a person glory to god amen are you with me so far yeah i mean you should be because you met god you met god on the back side of the desert of your heart if anybody knows god in this age it's the believer the believer has testimony after testimony about of what god has done and that god is in their life and how god brought me through this situation and god brought me through that situation and you can't take you can't shake them from it you can't you can't get them say well i don't think that really happened there's i don't care if you think it happened or not i was there i was there [Applause] i don't care if you believe my testimonies but i believe them because i was there praise the lord so the birth of the word the prophecy behold the virgin shall conceive was coming into reality when jesus christ was born that prophecy now here he is the word the the baby's getting ready to be born all kinds of things are happening on earth and now there's an increase in angelic activity amen because god was getting ready to come down and he had to he had to make a body for himself so when the body would rise up he said i i have uh iconis in him down a little lower than the angels so god had prepared a body for himself amen so when the first advent of christ came all of a sudden there were angelic beings beings moving around amen when the birth of the word when mary was there all of a sudden now there's three magis that are studying the skies and three stars start to come together and they make a journey they start making a journey they're traveling amen it took them a couple years to get there but they're traveling when jesus is born there's angels all over the place the shepherds are out in the field they look up in the skies there's angels everywhere because now they can see them because something's very important is happening on earth amen [Music] excuse me so there's an increase in angelic activity and not only did gabriel come and speak with mary but then gabriel spoke with joseph and all these things are happening so anytime the lord is turning a corner or a new dispensation amen something very important like the birth of the word there's angelic activity all over the earth so now we with this this just jump forward into our day our age and now the word is getting ready to be broke open in 1963 yes and all of a sudden there's a man that comes out amen talking about the angel of the lord telling stories like when i was born there was a light that came in the room and hovered over my crib praise the lord amen and it was years later it was they took the picture in the sam houston coliseum in 1950 years later when he says look church you see i wasn't lying to you praise god amen god help us remember brother man laid back on us on his bed and he he closed his eyes and the angel said would you like to see behind the curtain of time hallelujah and he said i think it would really help me and god took him beyond the curtain of time an angel's standing there and he's looking at all these people just as real as you and me in a different dimension just in a different dimension amen thank you jesus praise the lord amen so brother branson was talking about all the signs the stars coming together in an infant church being born on earth there's an increase in angelic activity amen the pillar of fire returns to the church the angel of the lord is with the church and all these things are taking place and brother branham one place he's preaching or he had it he had a he had a prayer line and this woman was there and after brother branham left she was just standing there staring and her husband came up and said sweetheart are you okay what's going on and she says did you see that man next to brother branham he goes no she said that was the angel and he told me when brother brown was praying for me the man told me doesn't brother branham look frail and then she's like yeah he says brother brown is very tired after this is over tell brother branham you know what happened so she told her husband i got to tell brother branham she tells where the brown starts crying so the angel was there now i've heard people say i was there when he said the angel was there i didn't see it it doesn't negate it doesn't negate anything are you hearing me it doesn't mean anything you're sitting here tonight in church and like well i don't see an angel i don't see honestly i don't see one right now but i know he's here i know they're here i mean i know the angels are here i know the supernatural's here i know that if we can all collectively by faith move up into that channel amen especially even through the weekend when we can move up into that channel we can get whatever we need from god if we can believe we can have anything that we need the fountain is open everything is there for us the healings are already paid i mean everything is it's already done the song said it's already done amen and but yet sometimes we are so fearful sometimes we are so doubtful sometimes we have all these issues and yet we forget we become like a giza when we should be more like elisha when we know that the angels of god are here and whatever i need i can receive it tonight not because brother flint's preaching no way but because we believe the promise of god he's still a healer he's still a deliverer he's still a mighty god if you've got pain he's the pain taker amen if you need salvation he is the savior whatever you need you got it tonight don't worry about all these antifa's and all this craziness around this world don't worry about this that satan's even coming to a climax they're coming to a climax but we need to start coming to a climax within the spirit of god in the realm of god how are you going to stir god to meet your need by your faith only by faith praise the lord amen so anytime god turns a corner he starts or have a message he starts to send angels because god's his own interpreter god uses men men don't use god god uses men and god is not going to push play on a tape deck and obey the prophet right god uses men and men obey god praise the lord hallelujah so here we go now we get to a junction of time excuse me and god starts to use sends down angels before israel crossed the sea crossed over the jordan the angel of the lord met joshua claiming to be the captain of the host is that right yes so why would we think any different than the angel of god visiting brother branham when it's time for the infant church to be born when it's time for the breaking of the seals amen angelic activity starts to increase yes so before the bride could receive the open book the lamb had to take the book himself and before the lamb could be born amen angels came to earth and started moving around talking doing things doing the lamb amen was going to come forth to break the seals now remember the seven thunders of the seven seals where do they sound from not heaven they sound from the earth but only the lamb can open the seal so then the lamb's got to come to earth the lamb has to be on earth and so since the lamb is coming to the earth we're talking about 63. angels have got to start moving around they're doing something because god they are god's attendance they are god's helpers they are there with god amen praise the lord amen before samson was born an angel visited his parents manoa and his wife they just walk out there and all of a sudden the wife comes back he said my an angel visited me if it was nowadays well you're getting crazy what are you talking about but not manoa and i hope not you but you say what let's go out and take him some stuff and meet with him and he comes back to give them a message before gideon liberated israel and angel visited him yep that's right i love what these angels say look at mary you're a woman a a favor found favor with god you think mary thinks she knew she had favor with god and gideon you're a man mighty man of elder he was scared to death what do you mean i'm a mad amount of valor you see we don't even know our own selves yes sometimes we don't even realize who we are we're so worried about all of our complexes and our our deficiencies we forget that there's a mighty god living inside of his church amen mary and joseph they received attention from angel brother brown was born a pillar of fire come in the room the angel visited him many times told him he was born for a purpose amen before the seven seals could be opened seven angels appeared to the prophet on mount sunset yeah praise the lord so this activity on earth starts to pick up it is the rising of the sun now remember now it doesn't matter if the denomination caught it it wasn't sent to them it was sent to you yes amen all those rabbis didn't know what was happening with mary they're just like mary and joseph oh this is a bad deal how do we cover this thing up that's right yes it is the rising of the sun a vision that i had here at the tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona where i was to meet in the form of a period pyramid seven angels and draw it in the skies a shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared so this constellation of angels they come down the white wig just like in revelation said that he's covered the white wig they come down brother brown's hunting in coronado forest he's running along the blast takes place all of a sudden he's standing there and he's looking at not one angel seven seven angels like men standing on earth sure now you know why the devil wants to fight that cloud so much yeah what is the attraction on the mountain the other day standing there turn the picture to the right and there's jesus remember now he had the white wig and he goes down he says to confirm the message there's a light of the evening time he said what's it all about he said the white wig upon him as we talked in revelations 1 he says the angels themselves was the wig amen so now here these angels are and they meet with him praise the lord amen i don't get myself away from my notes too much here but i'm trying to okay so in in 1963 before this is getting ready to happen he's get these visions and he's telling about the visions so when it comes to pass we will know yes and he's standing there and there's seven angels talking to him and he said in the seventh angel was one i always wondered about yes so i always wondered about that seventh angel now just for a minute let's think before the seals could be open because only the lamb could open these hills the lamb was there and the call comes forth he's got to take the book amen and he's got to come to open the book so in revelations 10 the angel comes down seventh utters utter their voices so we have seven angelic beings amen coming forth in the age and we realize that this is part of the mystery the secret so the seven angels amen they were his wig and he's what's happening the point i'm trying to make is what's happening is god is condescending down the mighty angel to put one foot on the land one put on one foot on the sea to take authority over the church amen amen are you hearing me but those seven thunders those are seven angelic beings amen so now this mighty angel comes down the wig is there the pictures took amen you turn the picture to the right you see christ right the revelation is the mystery of christ amen these seven angels are connected with this seventh seal and brother says from the message the seventh seal now the voice of that great thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed and proven that it was of god he said i knew not these seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that of those now listen to what he says of those seven angels being this this being the message that was coming forth so now angelic activity is taking place because god's gonna do the greatest thing he's ever done on earth he's gonna finish the mystery of god he's gonna break forth the seals to finish the mystery of god to show everybody his bride i mean to show his bride who he is to give them a message that when they see who he is they can recognize who they are because they came from the same source glory to god amen so you're not just sitting here a sinner by god's grace saved are you hearing me though you are a sinner by god's great save but you're much more than that because you are people that when you heard the word something in you struck and you knew that's nothing but the truth and it brought a presence of god into your life and you don't even realize it but angels started moving around your life angels started watching over you a sister driving down in anchorage she's driving up she's getting ready to she has to stop life everything's clear she starts to give the gas starts to go forward an angel screams at her stop the car big old semi angels are watching over you angels are here every single day why because you're the ones that receive the message you're the ones that have come underneath the wing of the holy spirit hallelujah amen so here again now an increase of angelic activity because the seven seals mystery book the seven seal mystery from the throne room was getting ready to be revealed the lamb was coming to open the seals hallelujah what a great event it wasn't a metaphor it's not an allegory it was a literal happening of god visiting the earth praise the lord hallelujah the lamb would open the seven sill book of redemption so these seven beings these seven angelic beings come down with a blast and met brother branham not just in a vision but it was a reality form seven angelic beings come down to talk with the prophet amen he said here if i'm trying to do a god of service he says the whole earth shook everywhere rocks that size i don't know what size that size i don't know it wasn't there i haven't heard a brother say i don't know but i do know that the rocks shook everywhere right and that size rocks rolled down dust flying like that and i looked and standing before me stood seven angels that's the message we're in this is the god all god is the god of abraham isaac and jacob our god is the god of william mary and pratham we're not in some denominational nonsense we have been called out by the living god amen and every word in the bible is true where do our theory would gather together in my name i will be there i don't care if you feel it i don't care what's happening but you must believe it and if you can believe it your high blood pressure will leave your sickness will go away you're walking into your hill's body amen if you can believe it then you know that when you're prayed for you it's over with it's done it's a healed it's a finished work amen and now your confession changes and now you're confessing the word how are you confessing the word because i believe what it's saying amen praise the lord but i say lord god almighty help us open our eyes let us see the host of heaven let us see the angel of god let us see these things amen because it would help our faith so much amen [Music] little brother back in december would have been 29 2020. coveted hit the church in anchorage several of us got sick but one brother went to the hospital and he was then dying in the emergency room or in the icu and it was not looking good and basically it looked like he was going to die we already had a couple deaths in the church that year and i was praying i said lord please spare my brother i said lord this church can handle another death spare my brother everybody around the world was praying and we were praying for this brother brother brian amos and all of a sudden he's laying in there when he's getting worse and worse and worse that night early in the morning an angel visited him and an angel stood before him and the angel told him you're going to be fine the very next morning the doctor came in and the nurse said look at this and the doctor said i can't believe it things are turning around and god brought him out of the clutches of death when i picked him up at the hospital you should see a man that was scared to death it took a while i said brother don't fear don't fear stop fearing you don't have to fear this thing because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the devil didn't beat him he beat the devil amen by the power of the cross of calvary glory to god amen the saints of god were praying and god did a mighty work god come down and visited that brother in the hospital and angels showed up because angels are still here and they're still watching over us [Music] and the angel said you're gonna be okay so i tell the church don't fear kovid don't fear cancer don't fear anything because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world greater is the god of our prophet the god of our life to our god our husband our bridegroom greater is he than anything the devil can conjure up no weapon formed against you shall prosper but if you fear it brother battle said it'll come on you stop fearing things the sister years ago an older sister she always fearing cancer colon cancer i don't want to get colon cancer i'm scared to get that i'm going to get colon cancer i drink all these all these juice all these different carrot juice her body turned orange so i want to have carrot juice to fight colon cancer guess what she died from colon cancer you fear it it'll get you yeah don't fear the devil praise god god help us realize there's more of us with us than against us don't fear the devil you know why he fears you yeah if you don't have the holy ghost sir you're in trouble but when you get born again the devil is scared to death as the youngest christian the weakest christian that would get down to pray the devil trembles you've got enough power in you to create a world you've got enough power in you to cast the devil out he's nothing but a bluff a liar a stealer and a thief and when we get on the other side and we see him we're going to look at him and say that was him he's the one that struck the nation him that little thing behind me satan behind me satan come on stay with me behind me satan behind me you've been called by god you've been saved by god you've been anointed by god you've been raised up by god the angels of god are living around you they're moving around in your life constantly you don't feel them maybe but they're there you must believe god's word and cast out that lying spirit god has come to liberate his children god has come to give us revival god has come us to give us amen glory be to god if thou can't believe all things are possible it's not how holy you are as can you believe daniel was seeking god and the angel gabriel came to him to give him instruction daniel was thrown in the lion's den the angel of god showed up and stopped the mouths of the lions yes he did daniel excuse me they said to me second a bit ago they weren't going to bow because the brother was saying to their statue of their brother of their prophet daniel they weren't going to bow do you imagine how that must have felt when all of a sudden everybody bowed cornet flew everything every israelite there bowed except shadrach meshach and abednego yeah in the province they were in they stood there and they're looking around nobody is about everybody's bowed but us right well that's okay i'd rather die i'd rather die in the furnace i'd rather die in the furnace than worship my prophet i'd rather die in the furnace i'd rather die in the furnace believing god can help me than just surrendering to the enemy huh boldly walking there and they get thrown in the furnace it wasn't the end of the story now if god was done with him and god wanted to take him home had been the end of the story but guess what they would have been in glory have you ever heard the story of going beyond the curtain of time oh it'll be so sublime you don't want to miss it why are we fearing death we shouldn't even fear it it's almost like we should be saying yeah hey throw me in the fire that sounds really good huh but if god want to deliver me god will deliver us you ain't nothing nebuchadnezzar that's why you ain't nothing amen and it's the same thing with you in your daily life on the job you're worrying about the promotion you're worrying about the boss don't worry about it if god wants to close the door sometimes we're treated unfair at work sometimes the devil knows how to try to get to us amen we have situations and problems and it's always just the devil but sometimes god allows those things amen but we shouldn't fear him are you hearing me yeah but rather we should realize i'm a child of god yes sir i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god amen amen no weapon formed against me is going to prosper god's watching over me god's with me amen if my heart is condemning me then i know what to do i've got to repent i've got to make things right amen you get that settled you walk with the lord praise the lord and there are angels and then we come to church and here we are the greatest place we could be well one of the greatest places is to come to church what an opportunity huh there's so many activities and so many things to do but yet we have been given the opportunity to come into the house of god to hear the preaching of the word like you've never heard before this message is a portion of the word that that that all through the ages they wanted to know they wanted to hear and god comes down in this age opens rips the seals open gives them to the prophet messenger preaches them out to us to put us into a body changing message and we come and we hear it and we're changing here they're they're little they're a little here there a little amen as we hold fast to that which is good amen and we're just walking along and sometimes we think i don't feel like anything's getting happening happening but there are things happening we are slowly walking into a body change there's going to be a time very soon where all of a sudden amen loved ones from the other side what are they amen messengers amen they've passed and they went on but now they're coming back coming back to say hey it's time for the rapture hey guess what it's time amen all of a sudden because the bye that's what happened in the first coming and the first coming amen when jesus raised all the dead and cry all the excuse me all those in abraham's bosom they raised up to amen and the bible says that they were seen in the streets by many many could look over and says man that looks like moses no that can't be mo man it looks like that i always thought elijah would look like that no it can't be and all of a sudden here all these things are mingling around in the city walk just for how many days 30 40 days whatever it might be we're fixing to get a sweep come over this church we're fixing to get a revival strike us i'll tell you why you got a memorial hanging on the wall out there what are you going to do when that brother walks into this church and sits down and says preach it brother juan preach it brother amen and you're looking at him amen come on church god knows how to steer his people god knows what he's doing when we need faith god knows how to give us the faith sometimes we worry daniel was probably a little worried shadrach meshach and abednego were probably a little bit worried hey man could you imagine i had a dream one time ever said your loved ones that died in christ they'll come back and they'll tell you it's time and i i thought lord i i don't have any loved ones that i know that come from a very small family that i know that that can come back and say that for me so the lord gave me a dream and in my dream the doorbell rang i was in the middle of the day i was it was i think i was at night time i don't know i think but it was like i was i'd fallen asleep on a nap or something the doorbell rang and in my dream i went to the door opened the door and there was brother brandon i'm standing there he takes his hat off that really cool hat that little takes it off it's time for the rapture brother [Music] pretty simple pretty simple but for me that stirs my heart i like to have dreams with brother branham only had a few but they're pretty cool and what is it doing it lifts your faith enlisted your faith amen all we have to do is serve god in simplicity walk with the lord daily do our family altar stay under the blood keep the token applied just live for god when there's times that we don't know what's ahead of us don't worry about it god will answer the question sometimes people they just start looking for all these answers stop looking for answers god supply your answer wait on god they that wait on god amen shall renew their strength they shall rise up like eagles yes amen praise the lord and then we must believe right we must have faith and we come to the house of god tonight amen and we're going to come again tomorrow i think sunday we want to pray lord create an atmosphere help me create an atmosphere my home lord that my children when i'm raising my children is not just health or skeleton running in schedules and and soccer games and and running here and running there stop that stop that lord help me help me be more calm and and have a token applied and keep my home oh god help us right are you with me yeah and come to the house of god be leaving you'll say well no i don't need anything then you're praying and believing for your brother you're praying and believing for your pastor amen you're encouraging your pastor amen once in a while you make a family meal you take it over you ship it over to the pastor's family you do something nice for the pastor amen because when the church loves the pastor and the pastor loved the church it's a very good church like this church here a very good church amen and you encourage one another remembering always remembering that those angels are right here god is with the saints those power heads god is with us there's many things that we could say yes but the bottom line is our god is a faithful god yes he is i'm so grateful lord that you sent your servant elijah with the message of the hour but father that's not really the main reason i'm grateful the main reason i'm grateful is because you opened my eyes in my heart to be able to believe it to receive it and though many might walk away and many might doubt but lord you gave me a revelation you gave me a rock solid revelation of who jesus christ is yes in this day yes and lord the gates of hell cannot prevail i don't have to fear the devil i don't have to fear a false doctrine i don't have to fear a sickness but what i have to do lord is just simply love my father love those around me do my best to make things right when i'm wrong and to know lord and i pray that you'd help us all know yes and help me know lord because the cares of life sometimes come in but we want to be conscious of your presence and the angels of god that are here father so wonderful to feel your presence this evening and i believe lord that you are a god that keeps your word as brother brown said god always keeps his word father so then therefore tonight lord if there's needs in the midst we know lord god we can receive what we have need of right in our seat we also know lord that we can have prayer or whatever but tonight lord i pray that you'd move upon every heart and every need that was lifted up before you tonight i can just think of something and and i have might have a need i can just think
