[53:47] Acts chapter 13. Acts chapter 13. Let's
[53:50] take Acts chapter 13.
[53:55] Praise the Lord.
[54:01] Let's take Acts chapter 13 for the
[54:04] reading of the scripture this morning.
[54:08] And uh last week we started our year
[54:13] uh speaking on sparring partners. We
[54:16] want to continue there in this morning
[54:18] because I feel that's what the rapture
[54:21] needs. The rapture needs spiring
[54:23] partners. Amen.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; We will go in the rapture. We need to be
[54:27] spiring partners. We need to we need to
[54:29] find our place in this work of
[54:30] redemption. That's what we are called
[54:33] for. We're not called to be church
[54:34] members just to be bench warmers. We are
[54:37] called to be partners with the redeemer.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So we want to
[54:42] continue in our our talks uh uh this
[54:46] morning and just uh uh trust that the
[54:51] Lord will put his blessing on the
[54:54] reading of the word. Acts chapter 13,
[54:56] let's read this morning. Now there were
[54:59] in the church that was in Antioch
[55:03] setting prophets and teachers. Setting
[55:06] prophets and teachers.
[55:10] Praise the Lord.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] as Barnabas and uh Simon that was called
[55:17] Najger. Now I will grab your mind on
[55:20] that and just tell you that that was the
[55:23] Simon that helped Jesus
[55:26] to to the cross.
[55:29] Praise the Lord.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the Simon that helped
[55:32] Jesus, you know, to to carry the cross.
[55:35] And the reason why I made that comment
[55:39] this morning is because brother Brandham
[55:42] got so he got so uh uh attracted. He he
[55:46] he used that as a cher whenever he was
[55:50] praying for uh a black child.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; He always used that as a china. He saw
[55:56] it as a cher and he would say Lord
[55:58] remember that day on the road of
[56:00] Calvary,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; right? one of her one of her ancestors
[56:04] help you see her need and minister to
[56:07] her. And and and and the next thing
[56:09] there is that it is just to show that
[56:12] just that little moment for the Roman
[56:16] soldier pulling him out of the crowd. He
[56:18] was not a disciple. The Roman soldier
[56:21] just grabbed him out of the crowd, pull
[56:23] him down and said, "Help this man carry
[56:25] the cross." That little moment from
[56:27] wherever he took the cross to Calvary
[56:29] changed his life. Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; It changed his life
[56:36] &gt;&gt; and now he's part of the church.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; It's the things that are done for God
[56:48] that last. Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:54] Simon that was called Naj Lucers of
[56:58] Serene and uh many which had been
[57:02] brought up with Heron the Tetras and
[57:06] Saul that's the apostle Paul the least
[57:09] among the brelings his name here is the
[57:12] least
[57:14] as the minister to the Lord and fasted
[57:19] the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas
[57:22] and Saul for the work where unto I have
[57:26] called them.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And when they have fasted and prayed,
[57:33] they lay their hands on them and they
[57:37] send them away.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; They send them as sparring partners.
[57:43] Yes. The Holy Ghost calling men to be
[57:46] partners in the ministry. men of two
[57:50] different background of two complete
[57:52] different background the Holy Ghost
[57:54] calling them to be partners in the work
[57:57] of redemption. Praise the Lord.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[58:03] Father, Lord Jesus, we want to thank
[58:05] you. We want to appreciate you Lord God
[58:08] and uh thank you for the word that we
[58:10] have read this morning. And we just pray

[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[58:19] your seat. And uh and we would say uh
[58:24] let our let our little ones uh the ones
[58:27] uh the Sunday school ones you go back
[58:29] there with uh sister Naisha. She will
[58:31] spend few minutes with you and then I'll
[58:35] send you back to your parents. I almost
[58:38] forget. Praise the Lord. And then I will
[58:41] I will break I will break it and then I
[58:44] will regret again. Amen. Praise the
[58:46] Lord. So you have to help me to to
[58:49] remember those things.
[58:53] And uh I believe that uh
[58:57] uh
[59:01] every every service we will have one or
[59:03] two that uh our sisters can be able to
[59:08] to work with that day. just so we
[59:11] encourage them and then uh
[59:15] praise the Lord.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Are you Are we ready for the word this
[59:24] morning?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] You feel that uh uh your spiritual
[59:32] appetite
[59:34] is all over the place.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] But but we just pray that God will will
[59:40] just give us uh a special blessing this
[59:43] morning. So uh we will do a little
[59:45] little little uh history work here in
[59:48] laying a foundation as we talk about
[59:50] these two men Paul and Barnabas and uh
[59:54] we know that uh Barnabas he was not uh
[59:57] he was not part of the disciples. He was
[59:59] not part of the 12. Neither Paul was.
[1:00:01] And here we see the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:03] calling him out in a very special way.
[1:00:06] This is by prophecy. Someone standing up
[1:00:09] right in the middle of the church and
[1:00:12] prophesying and says uh separate me Paul
[1:00:15] and Bar thou said the Lord for the work
[1:00:18] of the ministry. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:00:21] So when we look when we look u I did I
[1:00:25] did a kind of a study during the week on
[1:00:28] this and I don't know where I left my
[1:00:30] notes.
[1:00:32] I don't know where I left my notes.
[1:00:33] Maybe I left you on my table in the in
[1:00:35] the homes. But I'll be able to cap on it
[1:00:40] this morning because there were
[1:00:41] references that I put so I can be able
[1:00:43] to go fast with you, but I won't be able
[1:00:45] to like uh uh I'm supposed to. So, we
[1:00:48] will just take our time. Amen. Praise
[1:00:51] the Lord. We will take our time. So,
[1:00:54] Barnabas, according to scripture,
[1:00:57] Barnabas was a Levi.
[1:01:00] According to scripture, he was a Levite.
[1:01:02] You see that in Acts 4:36. If you want
[1:01:05] to write that, write that down. Barnabas
[1:01:08] was a Levite. And uh uh and then also uh
[1:01:14] uh uh Barnabas was uh was uh let let me
[1:01:19] say it this way. He was a businessman in
[1:01:21] some way. He was a wealthy man. Praise
[1:01:25] the Lord.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He was a wealthy man. And uh uh uh
[1:01:30] because uh uh when you look a little bit
[1:01:32] into there and you see where he was, he
[1:01:35] lived somewhere then in Cyprus, you
[1:01:37] know. Uh uh uh and and uh
[1:01:43] but uh this uh Barnabas
[1:01:46] uh uh somehow he came to faith. We can
[1:01:50] really don't have a a record how he came
[1:01:52] to fight. uh uh maybe he was among the
[1:01:55] thousands that believed the day that
[1:01:57] Peter preached. But Barnabas came to
[1:02:00] faith being a Levite, being a man that
[1:02:02] is very observant in the Lord. Uh yes,
[1:02:04] he came to faith and uh and and then we
[1:02:08] realize that uh uh uh Barnabas,
[1:02:14] you know, is he's one of those men. He's
[1:02:16] almost like uh uh our brother Joseph
[1:02:20] that that borrow his grave to Jesus, you
[1:02:22] know. uh uh he was a man of uh of a very
[1:02:27] high status in so much that he can go
[1:02:30] over to uh to the governor and request
[1:02:33] the body of Jesus. You know, so the the
[1:02:36] the gospel have a way of of attracting
[1:02:39] these people. Amen. The gospel have a
[1:02:42] way of reaching out into every class,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; every class, every social gathering.
[1:02:48] Praise the Lord. And uh uh for the many
[1:02:51] long time we people have bear the mind
[1:02:53] that the gospel is only for sicks
[1:02:55] suffering people and sometimes that's
[1:02:57] the way the elite sees it you know that
[1:03:00] you know I mean they have prospered in
[1:03:01] their business and and their way of life
[1:03:04] and and they don't need anything to pray
[1:03:05] to God for anything. It's only people
[1:03:08] you know uh uh that are so much in need.
[1:03:10] But if you read the Bible, you will
[1:03:12] realize that the scripture has reached
[1:03:16] every level of society.
[1:03:18] Every level. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Every level of society. Look at man like
[1:03:23] Kolenus. Kolenus was not just a person.
[1:03:27] He was not just he was he this guy was a
[1:03:30] leader.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; He was a leader. You you look at man
[1:03:35] like Paul who talk about him and and
[1:03:37] Galia and and even Nicodemus. You talk
[1:03:41] about Nicodemus, you're talking about a
[1:03:44] student of uh of the scripture. So we
[1:03:47] see here that the Bible I mean the word
[1:03:49] henas
[1:03:51] came to faith and I believe that God
[1:03:54] brought him at a particular time and for
[1:03:57] a particular mission and that's what we
[1:03:59] will realize here uh as we look into it.
[1:04:03] So you will see there in in acts chapter
[1:04:05] 4 it talks about bann
[1:04:08] that's where he he's uh he was first
[1:04:10] mentioned and then it is not too long
[1:04:15] when the bible will get right into acts
[1:04:17] chapter 5 where ananas and so far's uh
[1:04:21] condition will come out and you will see
[1:04:24] that if you read carefully you will
[1:04:26] realize that uh uh uh they became a
[1:04:30] little bit uh what I say uh uh jealous
[1:04:34] or try to get into that competition
[1:04:37] because if you read the Bible, the Bible
[1:04:39] would tell you that uh uh Banner was
[1:04:42] among those that sold some of his land
[1:04:44] and gave to the church.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sold some of his land and then
[1:04:50] he gave to the church to support it. Now
[1:04:54] in a way that uh uh uh many times these
[1:04:57] things has been has been looked at at at
[1:05:00] a place where the Bible say they sold
[1:05:02] everything they have and lay them at the
[1:05:04] apostles feet. The Catholic Church used
[1:05:07] that over the years. And it would be
[1:05:09] wrong for us to think that that that was
[1:05:12] what the word of God was saying. No,
[1:05:15] that was not what the word of God was
[1:05:17] saying. that the people should rob
[1:05:18] themsel of everything they have and make
[1:05:21] the preacher rich. No, that was not what
[1:05:24] they did. That was not communism uh
[1:05:26] anyway. No, that that was not what they
[1:05:29] did. Uh uh because if now Peter wouldn't
[1:05:32] have asked Ananas, nobody forced you to
[1:05:34] do this. The land was yours, the money
[1:05:36] was yours, you were only asked to give
[1:05:39] what you can
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; and not not create an impression. Don't
[1:05:44] lie to us
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; because nobody force you.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was dealing with. Paul
[1:05:51] was dealing with h a lying spirit, a man
[1:05:55] trying to create impression.
[1:05:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And uh and so you will see that's that's
[1:06:03] what it comes. But but the reason why is
[1:06:06] that not too long the church in
[1:06:10] Jerusalem will get under pressure. They
[1:06:12] will they will get under persecution and
[1:06:15] they will need support.
[1:06:17] So Bernabas will be one of the men that
[1:06:20] will take the mission
[1:06:23] of gathering support for the church in
[1:06:25] Jerusalem.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And Banabas will be one of the man that
[1:06:34] would take uh uh uh uh this
[1:06:37] responsibility. He would get under this
[1:06:39] burden and and and then he will start
[1:06:41] gathering uh uh uh to to go and and help
[1:06:46] the church.
[1:06:49] Are we together?
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And in doing this, in doing this uh uh
[1:06:56] uh trying to help and and and getting
[1:06:59] getting himself involved in in in the
[1:07:03] move, getting himself involved in what
[1:07:05] we would call the message of the hour.
[1:07:08] In in those days, they never call it the
[1:07:09] message of the hour. The way they call
[1:07:11] it was the way.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; That was how they call it. You look
[1:07:16] through the through the through the New
[1:07:18] Testament or through the book of Acts,
[1:07:20] they call it the way. That's why Paul
[1:07:22] says the way that is called heresy
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; that is the way
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; we choose to worship the God of our
[1:07:31] father. So the way was what what like
[1:07:34] why we call today the message of the
[1:07:36] hour they call it the way. Praise the
[1:07:38] Lord. And uh uh uh so uh it was in this
[1:07:43] traveling around that Barnabas came
[1:07:47] across Paul
[1:07:49] who was Saul at the time. Praise the
[1:07:52] Lord.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] Because when uh when and uh when when uh
[1:07:58] uh uh Paul met the pillar of fire on the
[1:08:01] road of Damascus
[1:08:03] uh uh and and the Lord kind of for there
[1:08:07] with him, he stayed there for a while.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; He stayed there. He got baptized for a
[1:08:15] while. and uh and and right there right
[1:08:19] there where God met him, that was where
[1:08:22] he started giving his testimony.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; So he would go to the synagogues, the
[1:08:28] very synagogues where the people knew
[1:08:31] him to be the one that had the authority
[1:08:34] to go and arrest the believers. He went
[1:08:36] back to that very synagogues to tell the
[1:08:39] people that what I was fighting against
[1:08:42] is greater than me. Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And you will go into the synagogues and
[1:08:48] and and and the teachers will BE
[1:08:50] ASTONISHED. I THOUGHT IT WAS THIS MAN
[1:08:52] LAST WEEK THAT WAS blasting against the
[1:08:55] Christians.
[1:08:57] What's what's what's wrong with this
[1:08:58] guy?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; But you know, he will first start to
[1:09:02] tell them and explain how, you know,
[1:09:05] this day he was on his way to travel and
[1:09:08] uh and and there was a light.
[1:09:12] He says, "Man, he see I'm imagining him
[1:09:15] saying that uh uh uh
[1:09:20] you know, we we heard that the pillar of
[1:09:22] fire follow our our fathers uh uh by
[1:09:26] night and it became the pillar of cloud
[1:09:28] by day." I want to tell you that that
[1:09:31] same pillar of fire is here.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And everybody sitting down in the in the
[1:09:36] in the synagogue say, "What is he
[1:09:38] talking about pillar of fire?"
[1:09:40] And it's only Moses that talk about a
[1:09:41] pillar of fire. You say, I'm telling you
[1:09:43] that same pillow of fire is here.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; You you people are looking at me as if
[1:09:47] you don't believe it, BUT I'M TELLING
[1:09:49] YOU THAT SAME PILLOW OF FIRE IS HERE
[1:09:51] BECAUSE THAT PILLOW OF FIRE MET ME ON
[1:09:53] THE road of Damascus.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, when a man is
[1:09:58] preaching out of con out of conviction
[1:10:00] and he's preaching h something that is
[1:10:02] real to him, you don't preach to
[1:10:04] convince people.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; You preach to testify what you believe.
[1:10:08] Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And leave it to God whether they will
[1:10:10] get convinced or not.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; So he goes and then uh uh uh he says AND
[1:10:20] AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE THAT MET ME on
[1:10:22] the road of Damascus.
[1:10:25] A voice came out of there.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I KNEW IT WAS THE SAME LIGHT THAT LED
[1:10:30] our fathers. And I said, "Lord,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; and that light
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; said, I'm Jesus. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you ever if you ever
[1:10:42] watch any of the Pharisees, heresy,
[1:10:44] heresy, heresy, stop that heresy.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is heresy. STOP
[1:10:50] THAT HERESY. STOP THAT BLASPHEMY IN THE
[1:10:53] TEMPLE.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; But Paul didn't care.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't care. He knew that he lost his
[1:11:02] sight.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; He knew that he fell off of the hearse.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Down to the ground.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He knew that he was led
[1:11:12] as a blind man to go and meet Ananas.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; This was not a dream.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; This was a reality. This was something
[1:11:22] THAT HAS AFFECTED HIS LIFE.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; And it has affected his life for good.
[1:11:32] And I believe it was one of those time
[1:11:34] Benas being a Levite, he would stop
[1:11:37] around and see Paul
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; right on the temple porch testifying.
[1:11:44] And Barnabas might have observed him
[1:11:46] over and OVER AND SEE WHAT WHAT A
[1:11:50] convincing message he had.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW REMEMBER ALL ALL THE ALL the
[1:11:58] the the the Christians at that time they
[1:12:01] were afraid of this man.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So he he WAS NOT JUST PART OF THE
[1:12:05] CHRISTIAN CHURCH. NO THEY they just you
[1:12:08] know yeah you know Ananas pray for him
[1:12:11] he received his side. Ananas baptizing
[1:12:13] Ananiah well that is your that's your
[1:12:15] disciple. You take it on him for now.
[1:12:17] Make sure that man is completely
[1:12:18] delivered. Maybe he's on a disguise.
[1:12:20] Maybe the the the the Sanhedrin council
[1:12:23] has sent him. He want to try to to to
[1:12:25] find our hiding places, you know. So, so
[1:12:28] Paul,
[1:12:30] he was somehow left to himself.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And you read the scripture, you know,
[1:12:36] Ananas said, "Lord, you know what that
[1:12:39] man has been doing to the Christian
[1:12:40] church
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and you telling me I should go to him to
[1:12:44] go and pray for him?" He said, "Come,"
[1:12:46] he said, wake up in the morning, call
[1:12:47] his wife and said, and said, "Honey,
[1:12:50] y'all pray for me. If I don't come back
[1:12:53] again, I'll see you in the rapture.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Because I woke up this morning and I I
[1:13:02] got a I got a word from the Lord. He's
[1:13:04] sending me down there to go and pray for
[1:13:07] Saul.
[1:13:08] You said who? Saul that you sure you
[1:13:12] were not I mean you're not losing your
[1:13:15] mind.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:23] Just as hard it was for the believers
[1:13:26] to accept that man, that is just as hard
[1:13:30] it is for us
[1:13:32] when we know too much about people
[1:13:39] for us to be able to receive from them.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Human nature has never changed.
[1:13:52] The more we get closer to the Lord, the
[1:13:54] more people get more critical.
[1:13:58] And sometimes they are being critical
[1:14:00] destroy their faith because they can't
[1:14:02] be able to receive from God. And that's
[1:14:04] why brother Brandon was saying that is
[1:14:06] the greatest thing. That is the greatest
[1:14:07] thing for one mortal to believe in
[1:14:10] another.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; But I would tell you that is the mystery
[1:14:12] of godliness.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; For God was manifested in flesh. Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery of godliness
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; is for you to be able to look beyond a
[1:14:22] man flesh, beyond his failure and still
[1:14:26] see God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Angels who have never preached this
[1:14:39] gospel
[1:14:42] because as you are sitting there when
[1:14:43] the angels see you sleeping he just
[1:14:45] blind you and you stay sleeping.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; God had to use men.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Now so saw
[1:15:03] Saul. He he he he saw Saul. how you saw
[1:15:06] s.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And the Bible would tell us that uh uh
[1:15:16] uh
[1:15:28] in chapter 11. Band is gathering uh
[1:15:31] support for the church in Jerusalem.
[1:15:38] It is just at that time
[1:15:42] that uh Barnabas will
[1:15:46] will meet uh
[1:15:50] Saul and then he will he he will call
[1:15:53] him. He get a hold of him and call him.
[1:16:00] That's when he will meet Saul.
[1:16:07] The Bible says he will go and meet him.
[1:16:10] And then uh uh uh Acts chapter 11. Acts
[1:16:15] chapter 11.
[1:16:21] Acts chapter 11.
[1:16:24] Now this is state around Antioch. Read
[1:16:27] from verse 21 quickly. I've not got to
[1:16:29] my message. I'm just I'm just trying to
[1:16:32] to do some Bible studies with you. And
[1:16:34] the hand of the Lord was with them. And
[1:16:36] a great number believed and turned unto
[1:16:39] the Lord. Then tidings of things of
[1:16:42] these things came onto the ears of the
[1:16:44] church which was in Jerusalem. And they
[1:16:47] sent Barnabas that he should go he
[1:16:50] should go far
[1:16:53] go far as far as Antioch. Praise the
[1:16:57] Lord. Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Who when he came and have seen the grace
[1:17:01] of God
[1:17:03] was glad and exalted them or
[1:17:08] that was uh uh that with purpose in
[1:17:11] their heart they should cleave unto the
[1:17:13] Lord.
[1:17:16] For he was a good man in full of the
[1:17:18] Holy Ghost and of faith and much people
[1:17:20] was added unto the Lord. then departed
[1:17:23] Barnabas to Tashus to seek
[1:17:27] Saul.
[1:17:30] He wanted to find this man that he have
[1:17:32] seen testifying in the temple.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Then he went to seek Saul. He went down
[1:17:40] to Tashas because when Saul he stayed
[1:17:43] there for a while and when the people
[1:17:46] were not you know he was not associating
[1:17:49] with the believers so he had to go down
[1:17:51] to his hometown Tash saw of Tashas
[1:17:54] that's that's where he was from so he
[1:17:56] went back to his hometown and uh uh uh
[1:18:01] and and and you will you will also
[1:18:04] realize that uh uh before he did that
[1:18:08] there should be couple of years now, not
[1:18:10] just month because I call into history
[1:18:13] why he was there. Uh uh that was when he
[1:18:16] went at the backside of the descent and
[1:18:18] spent uh uh three years reconciling the
[1:18:22] Old Testament with this new move of God.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Now realize that he had never met none
[1:18:30] of the disciples.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; He had not met Peter. He had not met
[1:18:34] James. He have not met John. But he has
[1:18:37] met the writer of the book. Yeah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he came back from the
[1:18:44] from the from the desert of Arabia, his
[1:18:47] testimony was just as same as what Peter
[1:18:50] had.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now he's back. He's
[1:18:54] gone back to his hometown. He's just in
[1:18:56] his village doing his own thing, you
[1:18:59] know, doing his own thing. He's
[1:19:01] pondering this thing. He's reconciling.
[1:19:03] He's reconciling in his mind. and the
[1:19:06] experience that he have had at the back
[1:19:08] side of the desert. He's reconciling
[1:19:10] with with everything that he have heard
[1:19:12] what they have said about Jesus and and
[1:19:14] and uh and and I believe that Paul in
[1:19:17] his mind he's in some sense he's having
[1:19:21] a regret.
[1:19:23] He's having a regret IN HIS MIND. OH, I
[1:19:26] WISH I met him.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I wish I met him. I can remember I was I
[1:19:33] WAS I WAS JUST THERE.
[1:19:35] uh on the road OF JERICHO, I HEARD A
[1:19:37] NOISE AND they said he was coming. HE
[1:19:39] WAS GOING DOWN TO THAT BUSINESSMAN
[1:19:41] CALLED ZAKIUS'S HOUSE. I WISH I WENT
[1:19:43] THERE TO THAT MEETING. Now all of these
[1:19:46] things are flooding in his mind and and
[1:19:48] and and and he's just in his little
[1:19:51] corner doing the little thing that he
[1:19:54] can do for the Lord.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; He's just doing the little humble thing
[1:20:01] he can do for the Lord. He's not looking
[1:20:03] for attention.
[1:20:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; The believers will not accept him
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; but he know his experience is truth.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; HE KNOW HE KNOW NOT IN THE fullness
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; but he know there must be a reason why
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; God interrupted my life.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THAT REASON IS, I WILL WAIT
[1:20:31] until my change comes. Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; So he he pulled back went back to a low
[1:20:38] life. Now here Barnabas on his mission
[1:20:40] now going to find this man. I have to
[1:20:43] find him. Something in Barnabas saying
[1:20:46] nope. I have never I went to Jerusalem.
[1:20:48] I hear the people talking. They say sir
[1:20:51] you know they are saying uh uh uh uh
[1:20:53] when I was with Jesus on the boat you
[1:20:55] know and and this other disciple is
[1:20:57] testify him when he did this turn water
[1:20:59] into wine and and all of that. But when
[1:21:02] I stood at the synagogues and hear Paul
[1:21:05] talking
[1:21:08] and I heard him ASSOCIATING THAT LIGHT
[1:21:11] with Jesus
[1:21:15] AND THEN I REMEMBER JOHN SAID JESUS SAID
[1:21:18] HE WAS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; There is something about that guy.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he went down there.
[1:21:32] He went there and and then he got him.
[1:21:36] Are we together?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And he brought him back to Andrew
[1:21:41] and he would bring him back to the
[1:21:42] brethren.
[1:21:46] Are we together?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He will bring him to the bridge.
[1:22:00] and uh and introduce them and introduce
[1:22:04] Paul to the brethren. Barnabas will be
[1:22:08] the one that will bring the first church
[1:22:12] age messenger.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:19] and bring him. He will be the forerunner
[1:22:23] that will bring Paul and introduce him
[1:22:26] to the brethrens when they are all ski
[1:22:29] in their boots. You know, we all have
[1:22:32] faith and we believe in God and and uh
[1:22:35] we can speak to our mountains, but when
[1:22:38] there is just a little pressure comes on
[1:22:40] us, we come face to face with situation
[1:22:44] and we start shaking in our boats. They
[1:22:47] all looking at this man looking at him
[1:22:50] and all in their mind is this the one
[1:22:51] that persecute the disciples this is the
[1:22:53] one that hold the stone you know they
[1:22:55] are just flooding in their mind and you
[1:22:58] know and it's sometimes is that's I mean
[1:23:00] that's the way that we are made that's
[1:23:02] where our greater battle comes you know
[1:23:05] can we be able to control our thoughts
[1:23:08] in those moment
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; can we be able to seize our thoughts and
[1:23:12] say shut up
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Now, so he brought Paul
[1:23:22] to the disciples
[1:23:24] and introduce him
[1:23:27] and allow Paul to tell them his
[1:23:29] testimony
[1:23:31] and they are all sitting there. They are
[1:23:34] all sitting there. They're listening to
[1:23:35] him and he's saying that morning I went
[1:23:38] down to the council
[1:23:41] and I received a letter. I receive
[1:23:43] another instruction.
[1:23:48] He never he never shied away from it. He
[1:23:51] never shied away. He told the disciples,
[1:23:53] he said, "I have the blood of Stephen on
[1:23:55] my hands."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He's looking at them.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; You think about it.
[1:24:05] Steven had wife, then he had in-laws,
[1:24:10] then he had siblings, he had people that
[1:24:13] were related to him. All there were
[1:24:15] people in the very church where Stephen
[1:24:17] was sad sitting in that meeting and the
[1:24:20] man that that that uh uh uh order the
[1:24:25] death of Stephen is standing before the
[1:24:27] church.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:33] See how God sometimes will allow us to
[1:24:36] confront the toughest thing in our life
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and give us the opportunity.
[1:24:44] IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE WILL BRING US RIGHT
[1:24:46] TO OUR CROSS
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; and give us the opportunity to say,
[1:24:50] "Father,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I forgive them." Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; It's easy to read it,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; but when you are right in the face of
[1:24:58] someone
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; that have hurt you the most,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; can you feel those pains in your mind
[1:25:09] and in your spirit?
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Are you able to alter those words?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or are you so you are so grounded
[1:25:18] and you are so wrapped up in your pains
[1:25:22] that you don't even want to hear their
[1:25:24] voice say IF IT IS YOU THE EARTH SHOULD
[1:25:26] open
[1:25:29] and he's standing right there before
[1:25:32] those people and he's testifying that
[1:25:35] morning
[1:25:37] I still remember those men came and
[1:25:40] throw their coats to my feet
[1:25:43] I still remember I was looking right
[1:25:45] there. I SAW BLOOD SPLASHING OUT OF THE
[1:25:48] brain of Stevie. I remember when he
[1:25:51] said, "I saw heaven open
[1:25:57] AND EVERYTHING THAT THAT HE KNEW ABOUT
[1:25:59] THE SCRIPTURE, EVERYTHING he knew about
[1:26:01] the scripture, nothing of Stephen death
[1:26:04] he could connect to the scripture."
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Stephen talking about I see heaven open.
[1:26:09] NOTHING. NOTHING. BUT PAUL WILL BE THE
[1:26:12] ONE LATER ON THAT WOULD TELL US WHAT IS
[1:26:14] THE MYSTERY around heaven open.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; BUT STEPHEN SAYING ALL OF THOSE things
[1:26:21] there is no way he can connect it with
[1:26:24] the script. You see when people are just
[1:26:26] so wrapped up and and their spirit and
[1:26:28] mind is just so attached in religion
[1:26:31] they can take the very QUOTE OF THE
[1:26:33] BIBLE, THE VERY COAT OF THE MESSAGE.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT THEY CAN
[1:26:40] BE ABLE TO TO CONNECT THE THINGS THAT IS
[1:26:42] HAPPENING IN THEIR EYES with the
[1:26:44] scripture.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; There's no way they can connect it.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; But here they are so filled with their
[1:27:02] zeal, their self-righteousness is in
[1:27:05] their mind. to them what they are doing
[1:27:08] is right. They cannot see with their
[1:27:10] eyes how they are breaking God's law.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; They cannot SEE WITH THEIR EYES HOW THEY
[1:27:16] ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THE VERY GOD
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; they claim to believe.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There they HAD THEIR OPPORTUNITY.
[1:27:28] THERE WAS THEIR CALVARY.
[1:27:31] The very man that killed their deacon is
[1:27:33] standing BEFORE THEM. THERE WAS THEIR
[1:27:35] CALVARY.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Would they say go to hell?
[1:27:42] Are they are they saying in their
[1:27:44] spirit? Are they resenting what he say?
[1:27:46] Or they are saying father forgive him.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord have mercy on him.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Help him. Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But as human remains human,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; hummons are not angels.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; As human remains human, there is always
[1:28:07] three kinds of believers.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I believe there were some that were
[1:28:11] saying, "Lord, have mercy on him." And
[1:28:13] as THEY AS HE'S TALKING, THEY are
[1:28:15] weeping. They are not crying for
[1:28:17] Stephen. They are crying and thanking
[1:28:20] God for what he HAVE DONE THAT HE HAS
[1:28:22] BROUGHT THIS MAN TO FAITH. And there are
[1:28:25] some that are sitting there stonefaced.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; STONE FACE WITH CRUESS in their heart.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; You just sitting there looking at him
[1:28:38] with stone face and cruess. You see God
[1:28:42] don't work on our attitude
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; work by his spirit.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; To fulfill his word.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] Oh, praise the Lord. I don't know where
[1:29:03] I got this one from this morning, but
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling good. Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I found a channel here. I'm feeling
[1:29:09] good.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; If I don't get to my message, I'm
[1:29:12] feeling good. I will tell you that I'm
[1:29:15] feeling so good.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; A preacher feels good when the word is
[1:29:19] ministering to him.
[1:29:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:29:31] Hallelujah.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And there is testifying and he's telling
[1:29:38] them everything.
[1:29:40] And then he will come to this place
[1:29:43] to tell them.
[1:29:46] And I was on my next mission.
[1:29:51] I had my men with me AND IT WAS ABOUT
[1:29:55] NOON DAY.
[1:30:00] There was a brightness that was in the
[1:30:02] heavens.
[1:30:04] I kept looking at it.
[1:30:06] Every time I b my hair, I'll feel that
[1:30:09] brightness making a connection with me.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And I kept looking at it. And I mean it
[1:30:17] got so bright that I couldn't see
[1:30:20] anything.
[1:30:23] I couldn't see anything.
[1:30:28] And he stopped and all his men came
[1:30:30] rushing with their their horses and
[1:30:32] stopped wondering what is happening.
[1:30:37] But only he could see the light.
[1:30:43] You see it was so bright
[1:30:46] that I couldn't see my WORD AND IT
[1:30:48] AFFECTED ME SO MUCH. STOPPED RIGHT IN
[1:30:51] THE MIDDLE of the road AND AND AND I
[1:30:53] JUST FELL DOWN BECAUSE MY EYES something
[1:30:56] that he will have to live with the rest
[1:30:58] of his life.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; An eyes problem.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; MY EYES WAS BURNING ME SO bad
[1:31:06] that he fed off
[1:31:15] And he START SAYING, "OH LORD, OH LORD,
[1:31:19] oh Lord, oh Lord,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; glory be to God."
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And the people were listening.
[1:31:38] And he says, "You won't believe me,
[1:31:42] but if you don't believe me,
[1:31:46] it's telling me the truth."
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; There's a voice that came out of that
[1:31:52] light.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It said, "I'm Jesus."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "I might have not seen him when
[1:32:02] he walked down the shores of Galilee."
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] I remember I heard news that he was this
[1:32:10] place and he was that place. I would
[1:32:12] tell you friends, I never saw this man
[1:32:14] physically.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; But that light said I'm Jesus.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Now you have to remember this. Now all
[1:32:33] the disciples there in the book of Acts
[1:32:34] was in uh was in the upper room. It was
[1:32:37] not every one of them there that that
[1:32:39] saw the ascension
[1:32:41] but those that saw the ascension knew
[1:32:43] that he was taken in a cloud
[1:32:47] and yet Paul is saying that uh the light
[1:32:50] said I'm Jesus. The light shone from
[1:32:52] heaven and blinded him and he says I AM
[1:32:56] JESUS WHY persecute thou me?
[1:33:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; AND DO YOU KNOW MANY OF THE people that
[1:33:05] even sat in that service that testimony
[1:33:09] could not could not even reconcile when
[1:33:12] Paul said why persecute thou me? Because
[1:33:15] in your mind you didn't persecute Jesus
[1:33:17] we are the one that you are persecuting.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; So if he was truth if what you saying is
[1:33:25] true the voice who are saying why are
[1:33:27] you persecuting the church?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:33:31] So they start getting critical now
[1:33:33] because they know quotes.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; They are using THEIR HUMAN MIND NOW TO
[1:33:39] BE ABLE TO to understand WHAT HE'S
[1:33:41] SAYING. THE VOICE SAID, "WHY PERSECUTE
[1:33:44] THOU ME? I'M JESUS."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE SAYING IN THEIR MIND THEY
[1:33:53] KNOW IT'S NOT JESUS YOU PERSECUTE. It's
[1:33:55] the church that you persecute. So if
[1:33:57] what he was saying is true, THE VOICE
[1:33:59] WAS SAYING WHY ARE YOU PERSECUTING MY
[1:34:01] CHURCH?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Because the people
[1:34:07] don't understand the revelation
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; that THE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF JESUS
[1:34:13] CHRIST.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; THE CHURCH IS NOT OUR PERSON OF MAKING
[1:34:18] IS NOT OUR FAMILY MAKING.
[1:34:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; But whether they believe it or not,
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Barnabas
[1:34:35] knew that God
[1:34:37] has led him to this man, he knew that he
[1:34:40] was in the will of God.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Paul will testify to the
[1:34:46] church and and and and and and after the
[1:34:49] service uh h some of the people will
[1:34:51] build up courage to come and greet him
[1:34:54] while some will take their children
[1:34:56] here. Let's go home.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; They are bringing all sorts of people to
[1:34:59] this church. Let's go home.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; They will pack their children right and
[1:35:03] jump and and they find their way home.
[1:35:07] I'm not coming back to this place. Don't
[1:35:09] tell that man. It's not any time. I'm
[1:35:10] not coming back. Don't go back to that
[1:35:13] place. Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Hmon remain humans.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; They were men of like passion.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Some people some of the courage
[1:35:30] and shook his hands and said, "God bless
[1:35:33] you.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; The Lord God be with you."
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you have done if you
[1:35:41] were in that service.
[1:35:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you have done but I
[1:35:47] mean you just just examine yourself. If
[1:35:49] you are sitting in a critical seat,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; you are being critical that day.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; If you're sitting in a resentful seat,
[1:35:59] you have been resentful that day.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Then the Bible would tell us that on
[1:36:14] their way from Jerusalem,
[1:36:17] Barame decided to take his nephew John
[1:36:21] Mark.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; He took John Mark with him. Now you have
[1:36:27] to remember now Barnabas is the leader.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Now Barnabas is the leader. He the one
[1:36:34] went and got uh uh uh Saul from Tashas,
[1:36:38] brought him to Jerusalem. He's going
[1:36:40] back. to stop over to his uh his uh his
[1:36:43] sister place John Mike mother uh where
[1:36:46] they were having the meeting when Peter
[1:36:48] came from the prison and uh and and and
[1:36:51] he took Mike he told took his sister
[1:36:53] married and says hey let your boy come
[1:36:55] and go with me he's finished with high
[1:36:56] school what is he doing well he looking
[1:36:58] around for job okay let he come and go
[1:37:00] with me let's let's go let's go we will
[1:37:02] we find something for him to do at least
[1:37:04] he can learn and then uh John Mike got
[1:37:07] into the travel amen
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord Lord.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a good storyteller,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; but I'm just enjoying myself
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; this morning. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring you into the into
[1:37:22] the pages of the Bible.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; I'm doing the best that I can. Please
[1:37:26] enter in. Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Please enter in. Don't leave out.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Please enter in. I'm trying
[1:37:33] to do the best to bring you right into
[1:37:34] the pages of the Bible
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; because the preaching of the cross is
[1:37:38] not enough until he can bring us to
[1:37:40] Calvary.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; It's just a history that we talk about
[1:37:43] the cross and everything that he done.
[1:37:44] But if the if the word can bring us to
[1:37:46] Calvary where right before us, we can
[1:37:49] see the one that has spilled his blood.
[1:37:51] We can see the cruelty
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; of sin. That is because of my sin. It
[1:37:57] treated him like that.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet of God will say you
[1:38:00] will never go back to sin. You never
[1:38:02] come back to the house of God. But if
[1:38:04] you just take the word of God as a good
[1:38:06] lecture,
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; you go back home the same. Amen.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; So John Ma, I get along with them. He
[1:38:17] gets on the travel. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:20] That's in chapter 12. And his year now
[1:38:23] in chapter 13, they came back to Antioch
[1:38:27] where the where the church actually
[1:38:29] begin. There was there was a group of
[1:38:31] believers in Jerusalem but uh uh the the
[1:38:34] where the believers were called
[1:38:36] Christians were in Antioch. They came
[1:38:38] back to Antioch and uh uh uh that was
[1:38:43] where finally this great experience
[1:38:46] would take place. And the Bible will say
[1:38:51] while they were in service,
[1:38:55] they had prophets and teachers,
[1:38:59] which of course these prophets were uh
[1:39:02] men that had divine gifts. Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren would tell they were man of
[1:39:08] prophets, but they were prophets because
[1:39:10] they had divine gift to bring thou said
[1:39:12] the Lord to the people. They would tell
[1:39:14] the people, "Thou said the Lord, there's
[1:39:16] going to be a farming in the land." You
[1:39:18] read that in the book of You read the
[1:39:19] book of Acts, you see that there. So,
[1:39:21] they had a divine gift to be able to
[1:39:23] prophesy and uh and and and bring a word
[1:39:26] to the people on on setting things.
[1:39:28] Those were one of those people that tie
[1:39:30] Paul by the hands, Akabas, and says uh
[1:39:33] there is something that is waiting for
[1:39:34] you, you know, and and yet he he will
[1:39:37] still go to Rome. And uh uh so there in
[1:39:40] the church while they are having service
[1:39:43] there the little group there gather in
[1:39:45] Antioch the Holy Ghost came right in the
[1:39:48] service
[1:39:50] and there this prophecy will come out.
[1:39:55] Separate me Barnabas and Saul
[1:40:00] for the work where unto I have called
[1:40:02] in.
[1:40:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] Can you imagine
[1:40:10] how Barnabas will have fell in his heart
[1:40:16] that all of this time he was led by the
[1:40:18] spirit
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; to go after this man's soul.
[1:40:24] Can you imagine how he he appeared in
[1:40:27] his heart to know that
[1:40:31] he was not just looking for somebody
[1:40:33] that was eloquent? He was not just
[1:40:36] looking for somebody but he he he he he
[1:40:39] he
[1:40:41] was led by God.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; This was God. Amen.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; If now a prophecy IS COMING OUT,
[1:40:48] SEPARATE ME PAUL and Barnabas
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; for the ministry.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; We're trying to build out here to to our
[1:41:05] thought of asparing partners.
[1:41:08] So you see sometimes the people that God
[1:41:11] has designed
[1:41:18] to have you walk with in this work of
[1:41:20] redemption.
[1:41:22] They are not your childhood friends.
[1:41:25] They are not your family members. Well,
[1:41:27] you can just get along.
[1:41:31] How we all love people we can get along
[1:41:33] with. And there are some people we just
[1:41:36] can get along.
[1:41:38] Amen.
[1:41:40] and not just people we can get along
[1:41:42] with. But God has raising people where
[1:41:45] sometimes we will question their lives.
[1:41:48] We will question their background. We
[1:41:50] will struggle with some things about
[1:41:53] them.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; But in the final end
[1:41:57] will realize that God ordain it.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; It's almost like the the the the the
[1:42:07] people we choose to be our spouses.
[1:42:10] Oh, they know from uh from uh the the
[1:42:12] the the courtship day. Everything is
[1:42:15] good. You know, because the real thing
[1:42:19] of the individual is behind the veil.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Is behind the veil. Have you gone to
[1:42:26] those places where they have uh they
[1:42:29] have uh uh uh uh Spider-Man picture And
[1:42:33] then it just put a hole there for you to
[1:42:35] pull your face in.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And then when you take a picture, you
[1:42:39] look like Spider-Man.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; The real person is behind the board
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; and they just put their face there. You
[1:42:49] take the picture, it look like
[1:42:51] Spider-Man. SO THAT SPIDER-MAN, I CAN BE
[1:42:54] SPIDER-MAN and and uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:42:58] Little GOSS CAN BE SPIDER-MAN. BUT THEN
[1:43:01] WHEN WE COME FROM BEHIND THAT PICTURE,
[1:43:02] we are completely different.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; When you look at the picture, we look
[1:43:06] the same. Only the faces are different.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And sometimes that's the way it is. And
[1:43:14] and you know, and then he's cute. She's
[1:43:18] cute and they're beautiful and
[1:43:21] praise the Lord. Then when the layers
[1:43:24] start coming off,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; when the layers start coming off, oh my
[1:43:29] god, I can't even stand him. Oh my god.
[1:43:32] Oh, if I knew, if I knew, if I knew.
[1:43:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Let me be serious and preach this
[1:43:43] morning. Can we stand up for the reading
[1:43:45] of the word?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So just No, no, no, no. Sorry.
[1:44:00] I'm trying to get out of this thing I'm
[1:44:01] doing. I don't know how I got here. I'm
[1:44:04] trying to get out of it.
[1:44:07] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:44:12] BUT WE REALIZE THAT GOD DESIGNED THESE
[1:44:14] PARTNERS. YOU EVER SEEN THE BIBLE
[1:44:16] SAYING, "Separate me. separate me and uh
[1:44:20] uh
[1:44:22] Barnabas and S.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT IS DOING the calling here.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. At one time Barnabas might might
[1:44:30] have think that it was his choice.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT HAVE THINK THAT I SAW I SEE
[1:44:36] SOMETHING in this man and I think uh you
[1:44:39] know he will be the right person to work
[1:44:41] with.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; BUT FAR BEYOND HIS IMAGINATION, IT WAS
[1:44:46] GOD'S DESIGN.
[1:44:49] SO THE PEOPLE THAT GOD PUT IN OUR LIVES
[1:44:52] is God's design.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that God designed your
[1:45:02] pastor and he turned out to be like
[1:45:04] this?
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Oh my God.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus Christ.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many times you've been
[1:45:15] disappointed, but you I mean you you
[1:45:17] don't have no choice,
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; You better go to the deacons and start
[1:45:23] the campaigning for them to for them to
[1:45:25] call me to bo and vote me out. If not,
[1:45:29] I'm yet to stay.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm here to stay. Well, maybe if if we
[1:45:36] build you a new church, then we find you
[1:45:38] a new pastor, then we can go and do
[1:45:41] whatever we want to do. But for now, if
[1:45:43] you want to get rid of me, build a new
[1:45:46] church. I give you the easier way to get
[1:45:49] rid of me.
[1:45:51] You want to get rid of me, build a new
[1:45:52] church. We will find you a new pastor
[1:45:57] and then I will go ahead and do my
[1:45:58] thing. But until then, you'll have me to
[1:46:00] deal with.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; So, the best thing you can do, pray for
[1:46:03] me.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The best thing you can do for me, pray
[1:46:06] for me.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S THAT'S GOD'S DESIGN. Praise
[1:46:09] the Lord. I mean it has to do with our
[1:46:12] patterns uh pastor, it have to do with
[1:46:14] our spouses. It also have to do with uh
[1:46:17] the prophet of the age.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; God knowing that we will come into an
[1:46:23] age where now we'll be dealing with
[1:46:25] artificial intelligence
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; and yet HE WILL GIVE US a man for a
[1:46:31] prophet that don't even have high school
[1:46:33] education.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Praise God. WHEN WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN
[1:46:38] THIS AGE to challenge him.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, brothers.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; But yet, he will give us a man
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; in this age.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Because that's God's design.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the the sooner you
[1:46:57] start embracing it,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; the easier it will be for you. The
[1:47:02] sooner you start embracing the ones that
[1:47:04] God has placed in your life,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; THE SOONER YOU START EMBRACING it and
[1:47:14] and and and GET OUT OF THE FANTASY OF
[1:47:16] YOUR MIND,
[1:47:20] THERE IS A LIFE. PRETTY SOON YOU WILL
[1:47:23] START seeing your purpose.
[1:47:26] Pretty soon YOU WILL SEE WHY GOD
[1:47:29] PUT YOU IN THE LIFE OF THIS PERSON. HOW
[1:47:31] YOU CAN HELP THEM AND HOW THEY CAN BE A
[1:47:33] HELP TO YOU.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; The sooner you do that, the quicker your
[1:47:44] eyes will start opening
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; and you will start living in the new
[1:47:47] word.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Or else you will stay in your fantasy.
[1:47:51] You will regret in your fantasy and you
[1:47:54] will die in your fantasy
[1:47:58] because the imagination of man is evil
[1:48:02] continuously.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Separate me sword and banners for the
[1:48:10] work of the ministry.
[1:48:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you will realize that I I I
[1:48:18] love I I like to look at scriptural
[1:48:20] things here.
[1:48:22] And I'm I'm sorry that uh uh
[1:48:28] you will realize that right in this uh
[1:48:30] uh uh chapter 13 that's where his name
[1:48:35] will change from Saul to Paul.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Honor a divine commission.
[1:48:44] Honor a divine commission.
[1:48:47] His name will change from Saul to Paul.
[1:48:54] All along the scripture never call him.
[1:48:58] You know THE THE BIBLE DESIGNED IT THIS
[1:49:00] way to grab our attention.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Paul which mean a little man. That's why
[1:49:09] Paul means a little man. That's why he
[1:49:12] call himself the least among the
[1:49:14] disciples.
[1:49:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he's seeing himself here as
[1:49:22] THE LEAST TO HEAR THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE
[1:49:25] THAT WALKED WITH JESUS AND SLEPT WITH
[1:49:27] JESUS.
[1:49:31] He's looking AT HIMSELF AS the least.
[1:49:36] I'M COMING AFTER HE HAS GONE MANY YEARS.
[1:49:41] Praise the Lord. BUT YOU SEE ALSO IN THE
[1:49:44] HEART OF THIS MAN HE'S CARRYING he's
[1:49:47] carrying something HE'S CARRYING A
[1:49:48] BURDEN WITH HIM HE CARRYING SOMETHING
[1:49:50] BECAUSE GOD HAD THERE WITH HIM SO MUCH
[1:49:53] AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT THERE IS
[1:49:56] SO MUCH THING IN HIS mind he's he's he's
[1:49:59] wondering if if the disciple know these
[1:50:02] THINGS HE'S WONDERING IF UH THESE THINGS
[1:50:05] IF HE STARTS TO PREACH them if the
[1:50:07] people will believe
[1:50:11] oh I believe that he was a man of slow
[1:50:14] speech,
[1:50:16] but yet he was a man that never missed a
[1:50:19] word.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; When the opportunity was given to him to
[1:50:22] speak, he never miss a word.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His name will change right
[1:50:33] here in chapter 13. And uh uh as we go
[1:50:39] on,
[1:50:43] praise the Lord,
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; we will we will find out that
[1:50:55] you look over in chapter 14,
[1:50:58] you will see that it was it was Paul and
[1:51:01] uh Abanabas went down there. I think
[1:51:03] that was mass hill worthy preach and the
[1:51:06] people said the gods has come to us.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; You see and and A SENSE THAT GOD WAS
[1:51:14] BLESSING THESE MEN TOGETHER BECAUSE GOD
[1:51:17] ORDAINED them to be together.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And when they heard that the the the the
[1:51:24] the uh the people call them gods, they
[1:51:27] tore their clothes. THEY SAID, "NO, WE
[1:51:29] ARE JUST MEN LIKE YOU.
[1:51:38] OH, praise the Lord.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And if I didn't left my note behind long
[1:51:42] time, I have done I've done a good job
[1:51:43] with this because I kind of lay this
[1:51:45] thing out good for me to run through it
[1:51:48] and then get to what I want to say to
[1:51:49] you this morning. But let's let's go
[1:51:51] ahead. Praise the Lord.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then uh uh uh uh Acts chapter
[1:52:01] Acts chapter 15 will come the council of
[1:52:05] the believers. The council the first
[1:52:08] time one of the first time where Paul
[1:52:12] will meet with men that walk with Jesus.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; He will meet James.
[1:52:23] He will meet Peter
[1:52:26] when he had that council to be able
[1:52:30] to discuss on how they should deal with
[1:52:32] gentile believers.
[1:52:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; They sent for Paul and Barnabas because
[1:52:40] more and more report was getting to them
[1:52:43] that these two men were missionaries and
[1:52:45] they were doing jobs. They were working
[1:52:47] among the Gentiles. So they sent for
[1:52:49] them.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I believe Paul sat
[1:52:54] there with his hands folded, holding his
[1:52:58] chain and trying to listen to see how
[1:53:01] Peter and James and these men that were
[1:53:04] with Jesus, you know, how they taught
[1:53:06] them the church order, you know, how
[1:53:08] they will, you know, uh h present
[1:53:11] things, you know, and and he's sitting
[1:53:13] down there and just listening to them.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; In verse 12, the Bible SAYS, "THEN ALL
[1:53:29] THE MULTITUDE KEPT silence and gave
[1:53:31] audience to Barnabas and Paul." Now, so
[1:53:35] you see here the scripture keeping it in
[1:53:37] their order because right now Barnabas
[1:53:39] is the leader. Barnabas and Paul. It's
[1:53:42] always Barnabas and Paul. Separate me.
[1:53:44] Barnabas and Saul because he's the
[1:53:47] leader. He's the one that God is dealing
[1:53:50] with. He's the one that God uh h uh you
[1:53:52] know is is uh uh is inspiring and to
[1:53:56] bring this man on the scene.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; But the man that God had his eyes on for
[1:54:02] the age was Paul.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; BUT YET GOD WAS keeping him on a
[1:54:11] subjuggestion.
[1:54:13] HE WAS NOT SHOUTING AND SAY YOU WERE NOT
[1:54:15] THERE AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT.
[1:54:16] Let me tell you what what what the Lord
[1:54:18] told me. home. He kept quiet. He wanted
[1:54:21] to see how these disciple will order
[1:54:23] themselves. He wanted to see what they
[1:54:25] would say.
[1:54:28] Read Acts chapter 15 for for the rest of
[1:54:30] everything. I'm just I'm just only
[1:54:33] telling you as much as I know him.
[1:54:37] And gave audience to Barnabas and Paul
[1:54:39] declaring what miracle and wonders God
[1:54:43] have brought among the Gentiles by them.
[1:54:49] Banner say they they are testifying.
[1:54:52] LORD, LET LET US NOT LET LET US NOT
[1:54:54] CLASS THESE PEOPLE. LET'S NOT CLASS
[1:54:56] these people
[1:55:00] as people that can BE REDEEMED. NO, WE
[1:55:02] SHOULD NOT DO THAT.
[1:55:06] NO, HE'S SAYING NO, WE SHOULD NOT DO
[1:55:08] THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT GOD
[1:55:11] is working among these people.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; I would tell you if you if you study the
[1:55:18] scripture, now we're doing the Bible
[1:55:19] study this this morning. So that's okay.
[1:55:22] If we stop here, we'll preach another
[1:55:23] day. But if you study the scripture, go
[1:55:25] back to Acts chapter 10, you will
[1:55:27] REALIZE THAT AFTER PAUL AFTER PETER CAME
[1:55:31] OUT of the HOUSE OF THE PETER had a
[1:55:33] testimony. I think he said it here in
[1:55:35] Acts chapter Acts chapter 15. If uh if I
[1:55:40] can find it. Let me see if I can find
[1:55:42] it. Oh my god. I never thought about it.
[1:55:44] Please forgive me. Praise the Lord.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh let's look at right here verse
[1:55:52] 7. and and and and and when there was
[1:55:55] much being disputed, Peter rose up and
[1:55:59] said unto them, "Men and brethren, here
[1:56:00] know how that how that a good while ago
[1:56:05] God made choice among us that the
[1:56:08] Gentiles by the mouth by my mouth should
[1:56:12] hear the word
[1:56:15] of the gospel AND BELIEVE. AND GOD which
[1:56:18] knowing the heart bear them witness
[1:56:23] giving them the Holy Ghost even as he
[1:56:27] did unto us.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:33] And Paul no difference between us and
[1:56:35] them purifying their hearts by faith.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Now I I I think uh there was something I
[1:56:45] was looking for. He's not right here. I
[1:56:47] think it's in the episode of PAUL
[1:56:48] BECAUSE WHEN PAUL'S I mean in in po in
[1:56:51] Peter's writing when Paul when Peter
[1:56:53] SPEAKS OF THE WAY THAT the Gentiles
[1:56:56] receive the Holy Ghost, he said it in a
[1:56:59] way, oh my God, I wish I wish I had I
[1:57:01] found it and and maybe share with you on
[1:57:02] Wednesday night. He said it in a way
[1:57:05] that uh the WAY THAT GOD GAVE them the
[1:57:08] Holy Ghost. I wish that was the way he
[1:57:09] did to us.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Because he saw it.
[1:57:16] THEY HAD TO WAIT in the upper room.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD TO PRAY. THEY HAD TO BE IN ONE
[1:57:22] ACCORD. THEY HAD TO ORDER THEMSELVES.
[1:57:24] BRETHREN, let's pray. Let's pray. Let's
[1:57:25] pray. Let's pray. Oh, let's wait. LET'S
[1:57:27] BUT WHEN HE WALKED DOWN THERE AND TOOK
[1:57:30] THE WORD, WHY HE PREACHED THE WORD?
[1:57:33] AMEN.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAW IT WAS DIFFERENT.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; MEN THAT HAVE NOT been baptized,
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. MEN THAT WAS HEARING
[1:57:41] THE GOSPEL FOR THEIR FIRST TIME, RECEIVE
[1:57:44] THE HOLY GHOST, HONOR THE PREACHING OF
[1:57:46] the word.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] IN AN OLD WORLD, PETER WOULD SAYS THAT
[1:58:01] GOD THREW AWAY OUR CHURCH ORDER OUT OF
[1:58:03] THE WINDOW.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GOT DOWN THERE, I SAW PEOPLE.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW THEY WERE DRESSED.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; OH, YES.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ORDER THEY WERE IN, I SAW
[1:58:14] PEOPLE UNDER THE CONVICTION OF THE HOLY
[1:58:16] GHOST.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; When me being a Jew, I would have
[1:58:21] nothing to do with a gentile, but I saw
[1:58:23] the move of God.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; I saw God. Amen.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Changing the heart of the people.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So let us not DESPISE
[1:58:32] THIS THING THAT WAS THE CLUTCH.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE CLUTCH IN THE CHURCH. CAN
[1:58:37] YOU IMAGINE RIGHT AFTER Pentecost
[1:58:40] after these people HAVE RECEIVED THE
[1:58:42] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST? YEAH. THEY
[1:58:44] ARE STRUGGLING WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS.
[1:58:49] Their attitude to their fellow men
[1:58:52] because they have taught themselves to
[1:58:54] be privileged people.
[1:58:57] They're privileged people. Salvation is
[1:58:59] of the Jews.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; But Barnabas
[1:59:11] and uh Saul and Paul declared which mean
[1:59:15] Barnabas spoke and after he spoke I says
[1:59:19] I will allow I will allow my friend
[1:59:21] Paul.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. But I wish I had a tape to
[1:59:24] listen to his first message.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I wish I had a tape to be able to just
[1:59:30] just earrop some of the things he said.
[1:59:34] Hallelujah.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Some of THE THINGS HE SAID TESTIFYING to
[1:59:38] these PEOPLE HOW THE GENTILE has
[1:59:40] believed.
[1:59:42] HOW THE GENTILE HAS BELIEVED THE GOSPEL.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I believe Peter, James, and all of these
[1:59:51] Jude and all of these guys that were
[1:59:53] WITH THE DISCIPLES SAT down there and
[1:59:55] just looking at this man.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING A
[2:00:00] LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WITH his message.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD SERMON BOOKS.
[2:00:07] He were not with Jesus. THERE IS NO WAY
[2:00:09] HE COULD SAY, "DO YOU REMEMBER ungodly
[2:00:11] what he said?"
[2:00:16] HE DIDN'T KNOW THE THE THE YEAR OF THE
[2:00:18] TAPES. HE DIDN'T KNOW THE THE NAME OF
[2:00:20] THE MESSAGE. BUT EVERYTHING he said
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; was lined up with the word.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; OH, I BELIEVE ALSO THERE WERE PEOPLE
[2:00:36] THAT say he's preaching without court.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; He's not reading quotes.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; He was there. He's not reading court.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now, brother.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's just he's just
[2:00:47] he's just using his brain. He not you're
[2:00:48] not you're not using quotes.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; How how can we believe him? He must be
[2:00:53] quoting the prophet.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; We have all of those quotes here. We
[2:00:59] misbehave.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; As much as I'm enjoying this, I need to
[2:01:10] get out.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Well, how to get out of it? I don't know
[2:01:14] how.
[2:01:16] But I'm just trying to show sparring
[2:01:19] partners.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WHERE I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS
[2:01:23] THAT RIGHT AFTER THIS MEETING when this
[2:01:26] MAN WENT OUT HERE SAID THAT BARNABAS
[2:01:29] brought his little nephew with HIM AND
[2:01:32] PAUL FELT THAT THE BOY WAS YOUNG and he
[2:01:36] was slowing him down. I remember I I CAN
[2:01:39] THINK IN MY MIND PAUL IS SAYING LOOK
[2:01:41] BARNABAS THE work of the Lord is not a
[2:01:43] daycare.
[2:01:47] It's not a daycare
[2:01:49] because YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH
[2:01:51] ATTENTION to this nephew of yours. You
[2:01:53] are slowing me down.
[2:01:56] THAT WILL ALSO SHOW US HOW THAT MAN WAS
[2:01:59] THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE BECAUSE THERE'S
[2:02:02] A BURDEN HE HAD IN HIS HEART. THERE WAS
[2:02:04] SOMETHING THAT WAS IN HIS HEART THAT
[2:02:05] BARNABAS NEVER HAD. EVEN THOUGH AT THE
[2:02:08] TIME BARNABA WAS THE LEADER, BARNABA WAS
[2:02:10] THE ONE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE APOSTLE.
[2:02:12] BARNABAS COULD BREAK ON ALL OF THAT.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; BUT BARNABA WAS NOT THE ONE THAT MET HIM
[2:02:17] ON THE ROAD OF DAMASCUS. BARABA WAS NOT
[2:02:20] THE ONE THAT MET HIM AT THE BACKSIDE OF
[2:02:22] ARABIA.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:32] Sometimes that's how people are the you
[2:02:34] know they get beautiful ideas but no
[2:02:36] burden under the ideas.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; There is no burden under the ideas.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; God gave the burden of the church to one
[2:02:44] man and that's the pastor.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that in a rough way. I'm
[2:02:50] trying to say that in a in a
[2:02:52] knowledgeable way.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because many times people
[2:02:56] get on they have a burden. They want to
[2:02:59] see they want to see uh our young people
[2:03:01] saved. They want to see uh you know uh
[2:03:04] uh uh all the music better. They want to
[2:03:06] see things happening. God gave the
[2:03:09] burden to
[2:03:11] the pastor
[2:03:13] and he make us instrument
[2:03:16] to support that burden.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; We are all instrument
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; to come under that burden
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; and support it.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you see a person can guess
[2:03:29] IN A CHINA. OH, LET'S GO BACK TO THE OLD
[2:03:32] WAY. LET'S GO BACK TO THE OLD OLD TIME
[2:03:34] DAYS. YOU KNOW, THE OLD REVIVAL. I WOULD
[2:03:37] TELL YOU there God don't send his people
[2:03:39] back.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU HEAR YOU HEAR IT IN THE
[2:03:48] SCRIPTURE WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS UH UH UH
[2:03:51] UH UH GO BACK TO THE OLD LAND MIKE. YOU
[2:03:53] know what it means? Remember,
[2:03:57] remember
[2:03:59] time pass.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S A SIMPLE WAY FOR THE BIBLE TO SAYS
[2:04:04] THE SAME GOD THAT DID IT THEN, HE CAN DO
[2:04:06] IT NOW.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LET'S GO BACK TO THE WAY WE
[2:04:11] USED TO DO IT IN AFRICA and then go back
[2:04:12] to the way we did it in China and go
[2:04:14] back to the WAY WE'LL GO BACK ON WE'LL
[2:04:16] GO RIGHT BACK TO THE way it happened in
[2:04:18] the Garden of Eden where they
[2:04:19] disbelieved God and all the problems
[2:04:21] started.
[2:04:24] God don't go back. He move his people
[2:04:25] forward.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible IS ONLY SAYING LOOK BACK AND
[2:04:30] SEE WHAT GOD DID. HE CAN DO IT IN YOUR
[2:04:32] TIME.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; There's no no way we can go back to the
[2:04:36] time of Jeremiah.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; We are living in a complete different
[2:04:40] age. You cannot bring the time of Noah
[2:04:41] in our age.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:50] So this IS THE MAN THAT HAD THE BURDEN.
[2:04:53] HE HAD THE BURDEN FOR THAT GENERATION
[2:04:56] AND SO MUCH THAT HE WAS SAY I CALL HIM
[2:04:58] TO MY GOSPEL.
[2:05:02] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID BASH THIS IS NOT A CHILD
[2:05:06] CARE THING but and the Bible says there
[2:05:10] was strong contention.
[2:05:14] CAN YOU IMAGINE STRONG contention
[2:05:16] between TWO MEN THAT THE HOLY Ghost
[2:05:18] says, "Separate me, Paul and Barnabas."
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; How do we reconcile that people
[2:05:30] message people? How do we reconcile
[2:05:32] that? Are we going to say it was not the
[2:05:35] Holy Ghost that spoke to them? Then tear
[2:05:37] that page out of your Bible.
[2:05:45] Are we together?
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, the scripture say there were just so
[2:05:53] much a very strong contention
[2:05:56] between them.
[2:06:00] Strong contention between them.
[2:06:04] Now, Barnabas will go with his nephew
[2:06:06] Mark.
[2:06:08] And then Paul will pick up Silas. By the
[2:06:10] way,
[2:06:14] it starts to travel.
[2:06:17] It is all in a place that you have to
[2:06:19] understand men are men are different.
[2:06:20] They are built different.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; They are bu building different. They
[2:06:25] approach things different.
[2:06:28] I would never do things uh the way your
[2:06:30] pastor used to do it. I'm sorry.
[2:06:33] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:35] And uh uh men men are built different
[2:06:40] and God deals with them in a in a
[2:06:42] complete different way.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; But what are we talking about? These men
[2:06:50] were sparring partners called by the
[2:06:53] Holy Ghost.
[2:06:57] THEY WERE NOT JUST THERE TO PAT ONE
[2:06:59] ANOTHER on the back. No.
[2:07:02] When there was A GROUND WHERE THEY
[2:07:04] DISAGREE, they address it by the word.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; It was not a yes man, yesmen, yes man
[2:07:11] thing. No, we have only one person to be
[2:07:14] yesmen and that's the God of heaven and
[2:07:17] earth.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to get to this
[2:07:22] morning.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] THE SAME GOD THAT SHALL SHEPHERATE BE
[2:07:27] POOR AND BARNABAS. THAT SAME GOD SAW THE
[2:07:31] PLACE where he saw where
[2:07:34] that this man AT A SETTING POINT OF
[2:07:37] TIME, I'M GOING TO DRIVE this man into
[2:07:41] his ministry.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND YOU REALIZE WHEN PAUL PICK UP
[2:07:48] SILAS, THAT WAS WHEN HE WENT ABOUT
[2:07:50] GETTING TIMOTHY AND GETTING TITUS AND HE
[2:07:53] STARTED RAISING HIS MEN TO BECOME YOUNG
[2:07:55] PASTORS THAT WOULD TAKE CARE of the
[2:07:57] church.
[2:07:59] GOD HAD TO CAUSE THAT SEPARATION FOR
[2:08:02] PAUL TO FULLY GO INTO HIS MINISTRY. The
[2:08:05] same thing he did to Urias and Aiah
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; or Uzziah and Isaiah.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; UZZIAH WAS THE KING. ISAIAH WAS THE
[2:08:14] PROPHET.
[2:08:15] But there was a place OF INFLUENCE
[2:08:18] AND GOD HAD TO TAKE ONE MAN OUT OF THE
[2:08:20] SCENE SO ISAIAH CAN FULLY GO INTO HIS
[2:08:23] MINISTRY.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT JUST A A CONTENTION or a
[2:08:33] division, you know, where where they can
[2:08:35] go and start THEIR CHURCH. AND NOW IT
[2:08:37] JUST LOOK LIKE this church sent bomb to
[2:08:39] that other church. THAT OTHER CHURCH
[2:08:41] SENT BOMB TO THAT CHURCH. You heard what
[2:08:42] they doing there in Brooklyn Center. I
[2:08:44] heard what they're doing down there in
[2:08:45] Brooklyn Center. You know what? AND WE
[2:08:47] USE ALL THE TIME JUST to preach about
[2:08:50] somebody on the pulpit.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT THE PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE
[2:08:58] WAS TO ALLOW A MAN TO GO FREELY INTO THE
[2:09:02] MINISTRY THAT HE WOULD NOT BE JUST UNDER
[2:09:04] THE INFLUENCE OF ONE MAN just hearing it
[2:09:06] over and over. You know, I brought you
[2:09:08] to this setting. You know, I brought you
[2:09:10] here. No, no, no. That was not the
[2:09:12] purpose. THE PURPOSE THERE WAS TO ALLOW
[2:09:14] THIS MAN BEING THE MESSENGER OF THE
[2:09:17] agemen
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; for him to be able to express himself.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; You know they rejoice my heart. That's
[2:09:39] why I rejoice in that. you know, if uh
[2:09:42] if uh uh you know, the grace of God can
[2:09:46] be able to help you to to to to to raise
[2:09:50] men and and and allow them go and then
[2:09:53] you sit back and and you hear, "Oh,
[2:09:55] yeah, you know, that brother, you know,
[2:09:56] he's serving the Lord. He's doing a
[2:09:58] wonderful thing." It rejoice your heart
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; than just holding them and holding them.
[2:10:03] I don't believe in that. I don't believe
[2:10:06] in that.
[2:10:08] I don't believe in that. I believe you
[2:10:10] know that God must be able to help us.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; To bring new souls to the kingdom.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; To look for new souls if it is just one
[2:10:23] or two.
[2:10:26] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; I love those houseto house ministry.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:36] Now I've taken order to time you on
[2:10:39] this.
[2:10:41] How could you do that?
[2:10:44] Think of all of the time
[2:10:48] on this
[2:10:50] now. So
[2:10:52] I'll come to something here. I started
[2:10:55] with something brother Brandham said in
[2:10:57] the message there. Uh spoken word is the
[2:11:00] original seed. Uh I thought I would
[2:11:03] address it this morning but I I see it's
[2:11:06] we already 1:00 I've gone over my hour.
[2:11:10] I don't even know what time I came to
[2:11:12] the pit. No, it was not 12. Just before
[2:11:14] 12 I came to the pit. So this all came I
[2:11:16] preached now an hour
[2:11:19] and we still believe the message of an
[2:11:21] hour.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. The message of
[2:11:25] the hour.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, brother Brandham
[2:11:32] shared this thing. Yeah. While we were
[2:11:34] we were standing last week, I I saw this
[2:11:38] quote and I knew there was not time for
[2:11:40] us to get into it. So, I thought I will
[2:11:43] leave it for today. God covenant with
[2:11:46] Abraham in his seed.
[2:11:50] Let's read that. We talking about uh uh
[2:11:53] uh uh
[2:11:56] he says now I don't believe that Satan
[2:12:00] is a creator. I believe that Satan is a
[2:12:03] perverter
[2:12:05] but not not a creator because God is the
[2:12:10] only one who can create
[2:12:12] and in the beginning
[2:12:15] when he Satan become a co-partner
[2:12:20] with God when he became a co-partner
[2:12:24] this is one of the place that brother
[2:12:28] Bennon ever used this word
[2:12:30] referring to the devil as a co-artner.
[2:12:34] He became a co-artner with God. The son
[2:12:38] of the morning, that's that's Lucifer.
[2:12:42] And so forth when he walked up and down
[2:12:46] the Pharaoh uh brimstones and so forth.
[2:12:49] That's when Satan perverted good to
[2:12:53] evil.
[2:12:54] You know what uh uh what pervert to do
[2:12:58] to do anything. Okay. Now, so he's he's
[2:13:01] he's bringing something here that we
[2:13:05] must look at and we must study realizing
[2:13:08] that the devil is just a tool in the
[2:13:11] hands of God.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if you are a
[2:13:15] mechanic and you can you can repair
[2:13:17] vehicles uh uh uh you know and and uh
[2:13:21] you can repair vehicles, you realize
[2:13:24] that you have all of the knowledge. But
[2:13:27] for you to be able to lose those bolts,
[2:13:30] you need tools in your hands.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; So those tools in your hands becomes
[2:13:35] your co-artner.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what brother Brandon
[2:13:39] was referring to. Amen. because he's
[2:13:44] he's about to unfold his plan of
[2:13:47] redemption.
[2:13:49] Yeah, he will need a perverter.
[2:13:53] He will need a man that will pervert
[2:13:55] good to evil
[2:13:59] and through that
[2:14:01] his attribute will be manifested.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; So you see how the devil becomes a
[2:14:09] co-artner.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Where he becomes a co-artner.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; And you have to realize being a
[2:14:23] co-artner his role is very temporary.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:30] You being A PARTNER WITH GOD, YOUR ROAD
[2:14:33] is not temporary.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; You use the tools to work on the
[2:14:43] vehicle. AND YOU SAY, "JOHNNY, GIVE ME
[2:14:45] THAT h a stroll." And he gave it to you.
[2:14:48] OH, BRING THE JACK. AND HE BRING THE
[2:14:49] JACK. AFTER YOU GET THE WORK DONE, YOU
[2:14:52] PUT ALL OF THOSE TOOLS AWAY. JOHNNY,
[2:14:54] LET'S GET in the vehicle. Let's go. You
[2:14:56] don't pack the tools and put the whole
[2:14:58] mechanic thing in a car. No, YOU LEAVE
[2:15:02] IT IN A SHOP AND YOU AND JOHNNY CAN TAKE
[2:15:04] the trip and go wherever you're supposed
[2:15:05] to go.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; SO JOHNNY THAT WAS HELPING YOU TO REPAIR
[2:15:10] THIS CAR. HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU IS
[2:15:14] MORE THAN THE TOOLS YOU WERE USING.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; THE TOOLS ARE JUST TEMPORARILY. You need
[2:15:19] the tools to change the balls AND CHANGE
[2:15:21] THE TIRES AND ALL of that, but you need
[2:15:24] this man journey to help you travel on
[2:15:27] your journey and help you get the work
[2:15:30] done.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD CALL US INTO PARTNERSHIP,
[2:15:34] IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN HE GET THE DEVIL AS
[2:15:36] A CO-ARTNER.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; HE BEING THE GOD, THE CREATOR, THE
[2:15:44] FOUNTAIN OF LOVE,
[2:15:47] he can do evil.
[2:15:49] SO HE HAS THE DEVIL HAS A co-artner the
[2:15:53] one that will become the source of all
[2:15:55] evil.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at another quote another
[2:16:04] way he express it. There he call sat on
[2:16:07] a co-artner. Yeah he's going to call him
[2:16:09] something different in the message Job.
[2:16:17] THERE ARE SOME PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE
[2:16:19] JUST TEMPORARILY.
[2:16:21] AMEN.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS GOD HAVE US HERE AS BROTHERS AND
[2:16:25] SISTERS, WE MUST BE PARTNER in the WORK
[2:16:28] THAT GOD IS trying to achieve in this
[2:16:30] letter to the assembly. HE BRING US
[2:16:32] TOGETHER to work in partnership. BUT OUR
[2:16:35] PARTNERSHIP CAN BE uh temporary in A SIN
[2:16:39] BECAUSE GOD MIGHT WANT ME TO leave from
[2:16:41] here and go somewhere and and and and
[2:16:44] then continue. SO OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH
[2:16:46] GOD IS INTERNAL.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ALMIGHTY GOD
[2:16:54] IS INTERNAL.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:03] And our partnership in the local local
[2:17:06] assembly can just be for the local
[2:17:08] assembly.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just a pastor in this assembly. I
[2:17:14] get out of this assembly. I'm not a
[2:17:16] pastor. I'm a brother.
[2:17:19] I do whatever I'm told to do.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; I don't go and assert, you know, I'm a
[2:17:25] pastor.
[2:17:27] No, no, no. Are we together?
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Job.
[2:17:34] Redemption is one of the oldest thing in
[2:17:36] the Bible. Did you know redemption
[2:17:41] was ever before the plan of redemption
[2:17:43] was laid out before the word was ever
[2:17:46] formed? Think of that God for foreseeing
[2:17:51] and making a way of redemption before he
[2:17:54] even made the word.
[2:17:57] Way before the word was made, God had a
[2:18:01] plan of redemption. And we keep making
[2:18:04] the emphasis. That's why we are here.
[2:18:07] That's our purpose in this life.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; The partnership that God has called us
[2:18:13] to is to that plan of redemption is to
[2:18:17] find our purpose.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Is to find our purpose. That's the
[2:18:24] REASON WHY EVERYTHING AROUND our life,
[2:18:27] everything around our life, the better
[2:18:29] way to be able to understand it, apply
[2:18:31] redemption to it. Amen.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Apply redemption to it.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; That is the way to be able to see it.
[2:18:42] Are we together?
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; You want to go to school, apply
[2:18:49] redemption to it.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:57] Marriage, whatever it is.
[2:18:59] You see that over and over in in the
[2:19:01] scripture. Why would the Bibles talk
[2:19:03] about if a man have an unbelieving wife
[2:19:06] and and and and he's comfortable, he can
[2:19:08] live with her, his faithful is because
[2:19:10] of redemption.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; That over time
[2:19:14] redemption could reach her.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; So the believer's purpose in this life
[2:19:22] is tied to redemption.
[2:19:27] If you keep that in the back part of
[2:19:29] your mind and you deal with things in
[2:19:31] the light of redemption, you'll realize
[2:19:34] you will always come out right
[2:19:40] GOD.
[2:19:42] BUT GOD PUTTING SATAN almost co-equal.
[2:19:48] The first quote he says co-artner.
[2:19:51] HERE HE SAYS GOD PUTTING SATAN ALMOST
[2:19:55] coal equal
[2:20:00] men
[2:20:02] almost coequal
[2:20:05] with him Satan taking the things of God
[2:20:09] and perverting them into evil thoughts
[2:20:14] and through there be to pervert things
[2:20:18] into evil instead of good
[2:20:21] and God as soon as the first thing was
[2:20:24] done. The first perversion was done. See
[2:20:27] what brother Brandham says. Out of his
[2:20:29] great treasure chest of love, he had a
[2:20:33] plan of redemption that quick.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN BEFORE EVIL WAS DONE, God
[2:20:40] already had a plan of redemption
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; in his treasure chest of love.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Before the first wrong was done.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:53] So we see YEAH HE WAS CALLED EQUAL IN
[2:20:57] what sense?
[2:21:00] In what sense? He was called equal. He
[2:21:02] was brought into this AS A CO-ARTNER IN
[2:21:05] WHAT SENSE?
[2:21:10] Because God is good. He's the fountain
[2:21:12] of all goodness. There is no evil in
[2:21:14] him.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; So he has to create a creature that will
[2:21:18] be the source of all evil.
[2:21:21] He will be the creature, the source of
[2:21:23] all deception. He will BE THE CREATURE,
[2:21:26] THE FATHER OF ALL lies
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; because God cannot lie.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; So now he get a partner. This work of
[2:21:36] redemption. I'M GOING TO GET IT DONE.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; I GET THE RIGHT MAN for the job.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the Bible says he
[2:21:46] was perfect in all his ways. When God
[2:21:49] made us, we were not perfect.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; But when he made Lucifer, he was perfect
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; because he would do his job exactly.
[2:22:02] HE WAS DESIGNED PERFECT TO NEVER tell
[2:22:05] the truth. Oh my god.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; OH MY GOD. HE WAS DESIGNED TO NEVER TELL
[2:22:12] THE TRUTH. EVERY TIME HE OPEN HIS MOUTH,
[2:22:15] IT'S A LIE.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:22:17] EVERY THOUGHT HE GIVES YOU, NO MATTER
[2:22:20] HOW MUCH YOU THINK IS IN YOUR BEST
[2:22:22] INTEREST, is a lie.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; From the devil is a lie.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Because he was designed
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; to be the fountain of all lies.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:22:37] Lies, imperfection,
[2:22:40] perfect lie.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[2:22:45] The Bible says he was created perfect in
[2:22:47] his ways. He was designed that way. He
[2:22:52] was designed that way. God needed a man.
[2:22:55] He needed a man.
[2:22:57] Out of whom we come all evil.
[2:23:01] He needed a source.
[2:23:07] So he created a man. He created a
[2:23:11] partner,
[2:23:13] a co-partner.
[2:23:16] Hallelujah.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; AND ON THIS SIDE, GOD WILL ALSO CREATE A
[2:23:20] PARTNER.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; A MAN THAT WILL BE IN HIS IMAGE.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. AMEN.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; ON THIS SIDE, GOD CREATED A PARTNER, A
[2:23:31] MAN MADE PERFECT IN HIS ways
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; to be able to do his job as a tool. He's
[2:23:41] just a tool. A tool remains a tool.
[2:23:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; It is just to be used and throw down.
[2:23:51] That's what a tool is.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; You just use it and you trunk it down.
[2:23:57] Make sure you don't choke it too far.
[2:23:58] You might need it again.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; BUT ON THIS TIME WHEN GOD MADE MAN,
[2:24:08] let us make man in our image
[2:24:13] and our likeness.
[2:24:15] AND THE BIBLE SAYS GOD MADE MAN IN his
[2:24:18] image and in his likeness.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; So you you and the DEVIL DON'T DO THE
[2:24:28] DEVIL WORK.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL HAVE HIS WORK TO DO. HE'S GOOD
[2:24:33] AT HIS JOB. YOU HAVE YOUR WORK TO DO.
[2:24:36] FIND YOUR JOB AND DO IT.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; DON'T DO THE DEVIL'S JOB.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER FAIL AT HIS JOB.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; HE WILL NEVER. HE'S DESIGNED THAT WAY.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; It's never in him to repent.
[2:24:55] It's not in the devil to repent.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not in him to
[2:25:01] repent.
[2:25:03] Why you want to do the devil's job?
[2:25:08] Why you WANT TO SPEAK THE DEVIL'S
[2:25:10] LANGUAGE?
[2:25:16] HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:30] Oh sweet Jesus.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the two area of
[2:25:40] partnership?
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You get a co-artner here.
[2:25:45] You get a co-artner almost co-equal
[2:25:49] but he was designed just as a perverter.
[2:25:54] He was designed
[2:25:56] as the source of every negative thing.
[2:26:01] And then on this side God will get
[2:26:05] another partner. He will be the source
[2:26:09] of positivity.
[2:26:11] He will be the source BY WHICH GOD CAN
[2:26:14] EXPRESS himself through.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; And that's what God is raising us to
[2:26:19] this partnership
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; to be able to understand our place in
[2:26:23] redemption.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; Grab our purpose.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Here say we born under the sinful
[2:26:30] nature. And this guy on this side that
[2:26:34] is the FOUNTAIN OF EVERY NEGATIVE
[2:26:36] THINGS. He's the prince of the power of
[2:26:39] the head. We are born under the under
[2:26:41] his influence. Our spirit man, OUR
[2:26:45] DESIRE continually streaming on this
[2:26:47] side for negative things and evil
[2:26:49] things.
[2:26:51] But right down here
[2:26:54] in your soul,
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; so silent.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why you will realize
[2:27:01] the way our body and our mind scream out
[2:27:04] to you. Your soul don't do that.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Your soul is very quiet. Your soul is in
[2:27:10] the silence.
[2:27:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; The soul cry out, "Hope thou in God."
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; On this OTHER SIDE OF YOU SEE WHAT THEY
[2:27:23] THINK ABOUT ME. YOU SEE WHAT THEY ARE
[2:27:24] SAYING ABOUT ME AND AND YOU YOU DON'T
[2:27:27] RESPECT ME AND AND all the all of that.
[2:27:30] The energy here
[2:27:32] the energy is boiling like the lake of
[2:27:35] fire.
[2:27:38] While the energy on this side
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; is as rest.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; As the show of glory.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; The energy on this side IS JUST AS REST
[2:27:49] AS QUIET
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; AS THE shore of glory.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; You feel the cold breeze. Glory. Oh God.
[2:27:55] Thank you.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; When you get on that side,
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; you know who I am. You know me.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN COMPARE YOURSELF WITH ME.
[2:28:07] TOO much energy. IT'S TOO LOUD ON THIS
[2:28:09] SIDE.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; But on this side,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; say, "Oh God, help me.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Change my heart. Oh God, I want to be
[2:28:17] more like you, Father."
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; That's the cry that is on this side.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Through partnership
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; into this work of redemption.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; I mean, I can keep you here. The
[2:28:37] atmosphere is so good. I'm ready to
[2:28:39] preach.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; I can preach until 3:00.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; I wish I have money. I just preach and
[2:28:46] carry everybody out for lunch. You know,
[2:28:48] feel you in my way of apologizing to
[2:28:52] you.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you are so full.
[2:28:57] You know, the other day, other little
[2:28:59] girl, I had this in my mind. I said I
[2:29:02] was going to I was going to apologize
[2:29:03] last Sunday. I forgot. Uh, and I I was
[2:29:06] also going to uh uh uh greet all the
[2:29:10] January birthday people. Sister Ruth,
[2:29:13] Ariel, they all had the January. Is
[2:29:15] there any other January person here?
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, Rafer, you are in January. Oh, okay.
[2:29:21] Happy birthday.
[2:29:23] Happy birthday. Yeah. All the January
[2:29:25] people, I wanted to greet you. And the
[2:29:26] other day I thought about I said I was
[2:29:28] going to do that last week. I forgot.
[2:29:30] After after the the service on the 21st,
[2:29:34] I slip away because I was tired. Redeem
[2:29:37] call me on the phone and she says,
[2:29:38] "Papa,
[2:29:40] you say after service you will carry out
[2:29:42] for lunch.
[2:29:45] You said that after service
[2:29:48] you will carry every one of us out for
[2:29:50] lunch."
[2:29:53] I said, "Yes, baby." I said that. But
[2:29:57] where we wanted to go, we could not get
[2:29:59] a good arrangement, you know. Yeah.
[2:30:02] Okay. Yeah. But if you can't carry
[2:30:03] everybody out, you you can still carry
[2:30:05] us out for.
[2:30:09] So in the back part of my mind, I'm
[2:30:10] thinking, okay, this child has reminded
[2:30:13] me that I made a promise to the church
[2:30:16] and I needed to come back. And uh
[2:30:20] because you know sometimes those things
[2:30:21] fall in the crack, but the people don't
[2:30:23] forget. You come back again, you start
[2:30:25] saying the last time you say you are
[2:30:27] caring for you, you take care of us.
[2:30:28] Don't come and say something that you
[2:30:30] don't keep your word. We are not
[2:30:31] children. Don't play with us. So I'm
[2:30:33] very sorry. You know, we couldn't do
[2:30:36] that. And one of the reason also you
[2:30:38] know uh uh I know very well I knew very
[2:30:42] well that the trustees will not support
[2:30:44] me on this especially coming from
[2:30:46] replacing the furnace you know and we
[2:30:49] still have the air condition to do in
[2:30:51] the in the spring you know so I knew
[2:30:54] that I can't bring full money to them.
[2:30:58] Amen. I can't bring full money to them.
[2:31:01] They already keeping the shelter over
[2:31:02] our head. So let's just manage with what
[2:31:04] we have. So I'm very sorry that I never
[2:31:06] kept kept that kept that talk but you
[2:31:09] being a good audience this morning. I
[2:31:11] would not want to carry you very long is
[2:31:13] 1:30 and uh uh that's that just where I
[2:31:18] wanted to go. But uh what I wanted us to
[2:31:20] see is that uh you know when God call us
[2:31:25] aspiring partners is is not to babysit
[2:31:29] us.
[2:31:30] He didn't call us to babysit us and just
[2:31:32] warm warm the benches. No. As we look
[2:31:36] into this and we go along, you will
[2:31:38] realize that God is just like that
[2:31:41] mother eagle. He's going to tear all the
[2:31:44] comfort from under you.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; He's going to tear the comfort from
[2:31:48] under you.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; No matter what comfort you think you are
[2:31:53] feeling now, he's going to tear it from
[2:31:54] out of you because he have a purpose and
[2:31:57] he's not going to fill at his purpose.
[2:32:00] Praise the Lord.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; He has the devil here doing his work.
[2:32:03] But see around us, our city, people are
[2:32:05] while we are here, people are out there
[2:32:07] rioting.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; He's doing his work.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, things are sputing on on the
[2:32:14] media.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; It's all on the media. And here we are
[2:32:20] in this little corner talking about
[2:32:22] being inspiring partners with God.
[2:32:24] There's something that that must that
[2:32:26] must be able to inspire our heart. Lord,
[2:32:29] what can I do for you?
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; What can I do in this time
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; even something quietly? What can I do
[2:32:36] Lord?
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; How am I involved in this partnership
[2:32:39] with you?
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; What is my purpose?
[2:32:47] Because the devil is doing his I mean
[2:32:50] he's doing his own big time because
[2:32:54] events are being made clear by prophecy.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Events are being made clear by prophecy.
[2:33:03] And it's IN SUCH A TIME WHERE THE PEOPLE
[2:33:05] will be overwhelmed with things that are
[2:33:07] happening. They will all be panicking in
[2:33:10] their mind and in in their heart. You
[2:33:12] know fear reduces faith.
[2:33:16] You can't hold both of them at the same
[2:33:18] time.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; When we see the devil on the run with
[2:33:30] what he's doing,
[2:33:32] we must be able to trust the Lord and
[2:33:35] say, "Lead me, Lord. I will follow."
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; If there is something little I can do,
[2:33:43] use me, Lord.
[2:33:46] If there is just something little I can
[2:33:49] do,
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; maybe let my mission field be right in
[2:33:55] my own house.
[2:33:57] Maybe let my mission field be right in
[2:33:59] my own life. I can look at myself and
[2:34:03] ask myself, what is your purpose?
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:34:14] Because God had a plan of redemption
[2:34:17] right before the foundation of the
[2:34:19] world. It's his plan. That plan of
[2:34:22] redemption was before creation.
[2:34:26] It was before creation.
[2:34:32] The whole plan of creation came out of
[2:34:34] the plan of redemption.
[2:34:40] If there is one thing that God have his
[2:34:42] eyes down on earth that he's guiding
[2:34:44] over is that plane of redemption
[2:34:48] because he said all that the father has
[2:34:50] given me I will not lose one.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; I will not lose one. No matter what is
[2:34:57] going on on earth,
[2:35:00] wars
[2:35:01] and troubles and famine, all that the
[2:35:05] father has given me, I will not lose
[2:35:07] one.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? It does not
[2:35:11] only mean of God saving you. It means
[2:35:14] God's bringing you to your purpose.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; It mean God's h delivering you out of
[2:35:20] your struggle.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; It means God bringing you to the to to
[2:35:24] your fullness.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:26] that before your last birth is taken out
[2:35:28] of this earth, your purpose will be
[2:35:32] fulfilled
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; or God's purpose will be fulfilled in
[2:35:35] your life. God bless you musicians, you
[2:35:37] can come forward.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; We'll continue.
[2:35:44] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:35:48] I'll take that. I'll take that. That's
[2:35:50] it. Thank you for clapping for me. Let's
[2:35:53] give the Lord a hand of praise now.
[2:35:54] Amen.
[2:36:01] Thank you Jesus. Yes Lord.
[2:36:20] Let's
[2:36:25] sing a song there and
[2:36:38] Jesus use me. Let's sing a little bit
[2:36:40] about Jesus use me.

[2:37:34] please Lord Jesus.
[2:37:37] Showing
[2:37:38] there's a work
[2:37:41] that I can do.
[2:37:47] Oh, even though it's humble,
[2:37:53] your help and ways to crumble,
[2:38:00] though the cause be great, I'll work for
[2:38:05] you.
[2:38:07] One more time now.
[2:38:10] Yeah. Jesus
[2:38:14] use me.
[2:38:17] Oh Lord, don't refuse me.
[2:38:22] Surely there's a work that I can do.
[2:38:32] Let evening
[2:38:36] is humble. Lord,
[2:38:39] help my ways to crumble.
[2:38:44] Though the cross be great, I work for
[2:38:50] you.
[2:38:54] Lead me, Lord.
[2:38:59] I
[2:39:02] will follow.
[2:39:06] Leave me alone.
[2:39:11] I
[2:39:13] will go.
[2:39:18] You have called me.
[2:39:24] I will answer.
[2:39:30] Leave me Lord

[2:41:10] You have called me.
[2:41:16] I will answer
[2:41:20] all
[2:41:22] me.
[2:41:25] I will.
[2:41:33] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:41:38] Father,
[2:41:42] our hearts are before you Lord,
[2:41:45] this afternoon.
[2:41:53] Life has become so busy, Father, Lord.
[2:41:57] And oh God, and time has changed.
[2:42:02] Time has changed. And
[2:42:23] Time has changed. Father,
[2:42:26] time with God. Father, Lord.
[2:42:30] Oh, precious Lord Jesus.
[2:42:36] Living in such a time, oh God, Father,
[2:42:40] your word declare, Lord God, because
[2:42:42] iniquity shall abound.
[2:42:44] The love of many shall works cold.
[2:42:48] Oh God,
[2:42:50] we are holding so many things in our
[2:42:52] head. Lord, it's completely different
[2:42:54] from the reality in our hearts.
[2:43:00] Father God, Lord, I want to labor, Lord,
[2:43:04] under this subject of God and just show
[2:43:06] your people, Father, Lord,
[2:43:09] in this plane of redemption,
[2:43:13] in this plane of redemption. When the
[2:43:15] Bible says the the creation is groaning
[2:43:17] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[2:43:20] is a portion in the plan of redemption,
[2:43:23] the opening of the seals was a portion
[2:43:25] in the plan of redemption. Calvary was a
[2:43:28] portion in the plan of redemption. When
[2:43:31] Moses lifted the brazing serpent, it was
[2:43:33] a portion in the plan of redemption.
[2:43:37] Oh God,
[2:43:39] this is our age, Lord. This is our time.
[2:43:43] What the Bible says, men will be
[2:43:44] unthankful, Lord. Father,
[2:43:47] men hearts, oh God, Father, Lord, will
[2:43:49] be failing for fear
[2:43:52] and all of these things will be
[2:43:54] happening, oh God. Lord,
[2:43:59] Father, to be able to see in this plan
[2:44:01] of redemption,
[2:44:06] you got you got co-workers.
[2:44:10] You got men that are co-workers, Lord.
[2:44:12] You got men, oh Father,
[2:44:15] that you have called, men you have
[2:44:17] raised up, oh God. Men you have trained,
[2:44:19] Lord, Father, to be able to stand for
[2:44:22] this age, oh God. Father, when we see
[2:44:25] all of the things and most of the things
[2:44:27] that are happening, oh God, we see all
[2:44:29] the the the h the disappointment, Lord.
[2:44:32] Father, we see the fall in the word. Oh
[2:44:34] God, we see people trapped into things.
[2:44:39] Trap into things, Lord.
[2:44:49] Oh Jesus.
[2:44:53] Oh Jesus.
[2:44:56] Father,
[2:44:58] we know Lord God as we getting close to
[2:45:00] that capstone, Lord,
[2:45:03] the ship is getting tan. Father, Lord
[2:45:05] God,
[2:45:08] Lord, here we are this afternoon, Lord.
[2:45:10] Father,
[2:45:12] here we are, oh God.
[2:45:19] Dear Lord, we saying please help us, oh
[2:45:21] God.
[2:45:23] Please help us Lord Jesus.
[2:45:27] Please help us Lord Father.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; Come Lord God.
[2:45:34] Come. Oh God.
[2:45:47] Father, may we begin to see ourself,
[2:45:49] Lord God,
[2:45:53] not only as children, Lord God,
[2:45:57] now only as sons and daughters, Lord,
[2:45:59] but may we begin to see ourself as
[2:46:01] partners, that wherever you have placed
[2:46:04] us, Lord, wherever you have placed us,
[2:46:07] the people we live with,
[2:46:09] the people that are around us, Lord, oh
[2:46:12] God, you want us to represent you the
[2:46:15] best way we can.
[2:46:17] He want us to represent you, Father.
[2:46:19] Lord,
[2:46:23] oh God call Father.
[2:46:27] That little light of mine, Lord,
[2:46:31] let it shine,
[2:46:34] let it shine. Oh God, Father,
[2:46:40] if I can help, Lord, a wayfairing man
[2:46:55] Yes, Lord.
[2:46:57] Yes, Father. The Lord,
[2:47:04] that's where we stand with you this
[2:47:06] afternoon, oh God.
[2:47:08] That's where we stand with you this
[2:47:10] afternoon, Lord, and say, "Father,
[2:47:17] though God, we've been in battle, Lord
[2:47:19] God, though Father, the enemy has been
[2:47:21] throwing things our way. Oh God, he want
[2:47:24] us, Lord Father, to leave our work and
[2:47:27] start to do his work.
[2:47:29] He is the accuser of the brethren's,
[2:47:32] Lord. Father, he's the father of lies.
[2:47:35] Oh God, he's the one Lord Father.
[2:47:39] Oh God, the deceiver, Lord God.
[2:47:47] Lord, we we we have to be on this side
[2:47:49] of the fountain.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; A fountain of truth, Lord. Amen.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; When your word said, "Lie not unto one
[2:47:56] another,
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; you give us a a heart, Lord, a place in
[2:48:02] our heart where we can come back, Lord
[2:48:04] God, and repent of our wrongs, oh God.
[2:48:07] Father, a place, Lord, oh God, where we
[2:48:10] can feel broken in our hearts, oh Lord
[2:48:12] Jesus,
[2:48:29] Dear Lord, please help each and every
[2:48:31] one of us. Oh God, Father,
[2:48:33] please help us Lord. Lord Jesus,
[2:48:38] whatever Lord God that is waring against
[2:48:40] your children,
[2:48:42] every spirit of resentment, every cloud,
[2:48:44] oh God, Father, every cloud of
[2:48:46] deception, Lord Father, Lord, every
[2:48:49] cloud that is trying to trap their
[2:48:51] lives, oh Father, Lord God, for them to
[2:48:54] miss their purpose, Lord God. Oh
[2:48:57] precious Lord, when our hands have to be
[2:49:00] in in in in a work of redemption,
[2:49:02] Father, doing the little thing we can,
[2:49:04] encouraging our children, praying for
[2:49:06] our wives, praying for our husband, and
[2:49:09] and helping one another. The Bible says,
[2:49:11] "Come, let us reason together,
[2:49:13] reconciling ourselves and say, "Oh God,
[2:49:16] forgive us. We are wrong. Give us grace.
[2:49:18] Give us another help, Lord. Oh, Father,
[2:49:20] all of these things, oh God, Father, we
[2:49:22] we we are called to be doing, oh Lord
[2:49:24] Jesus. Oh God, encouraging the brothers,
[2:49:27] Lord, Father, and praying for our young
[2:49:29] people, oh God, and just just finding
[2:49:31] something to do, praying for somebody,
[2:49:34] Lord. Oh God, place somebody on my
[2:49:36] heart, oh God. Oh Lord, Father God, let
[2:49:38] me just do something that is productive,
[2:49:40] Lord. Father God, let me do something,
[2:49:43] oh Lord God. Oh precious Lord Father
[2:49:46] God.
[2:49:47] Yes, Lord.
[2:49:49] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:50:06] with everything that is happening around
[2:50:08] us.
[2:50:10] Everything that is happening, Lord God,
[2:50:12] there is just so much things going on.
[2:50:16] So easy, Father God, for us to
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; be carried away, Lord, by all of these
[2:50:21] things. So, Father,
[2:50:29] while I would rather play that music.
[2:50:32] You know the story of the little boy
[2:50:34] that was flying a kid
[2:50:37] and the curt was was so much in the
[2:50:39] clouds that it could not be seen and a
[2:50:42] man came around and said boy sunny what
[2:50:44] are you doing? He say I'm flying the
[2:50:46] cat. He says where say I can't see it.
[2:50:51] He say it's in the clouds. He said how
[2:50:53] do you know that it stay there? He say I
[2:50:55] can feed the p.
[2:50:58] I can feed a po.
[2:51:03] And with everything that is happening
[2:51:04] around us, that is the thing that you
[2:51:07] don't want to lose.
[2:51:09] You don't want to lose.
[2:51:13] You want to feel the pulled.
[2:51:16] The pull that is say come up higher.
[2:51:20] The pull that is saying get out of your
[2:51:21] backsliding. Get out of your
[2:51:24] foolishness.
[2:51:26] Get out of your weakness.
[2:51:39] Let's just worship the Lord a little bit
[2:51:41] now.
[2:51:42] I feel
[2:51:44] the warm.
[2:51:49] Oh, I am
[2:51:54] the call.
[2:51:59] And I know his spirit
[2:52:03] moving me
[2:52:07] to give
[2:52:08] my all.
[2:52:14] Oh, you speak
[2:52:16] to me
[2:52:23] and I agree.
[2:52:31] Lord, please come
[2:52:35] and take control.
[2:52:38] I feel the
[2:52:43] Let's sing that one more time.
[2:52:45] I feel the
[2:52:52] Oh, I hear the call
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; and I know your spirit
[2:53:05] move,
[2:53:06] baby.
[2:53:08] to give my home.
[2:53:15] He speaks to me.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:53:23] And I
[2:53:25] agree.
[2:53:30] Lord, please come
[2:53:33] and take control.
[2:53:37] I feel the
[2:53:42] I don't know about you, but I want to
[2:53:45] say this
[2:53:52] that talk we feel is from inside. The
[2:53:55] call,
[2:53:58] the call to make something right. The
[2:54:00] call to do something right. The call to
[2:54:03] get back.
[2:54:05] Get back
[2:54:07] to what is right.
[2:54:11] Every day we must not go a day without
[2:54:15] feeling the poor,
[2:54:18] without feeling.
[2:54:20] Lord, I thank you. You there with me
[2:54:23] this morning. Lord, I thank you.
[2:54:26] Thank you, Lord. You spoke to me. Lord,
[2:54:28] thank you.
[2:54:30] Just that consciousness, the Bible say
[2:54:32] Enoch walked with God.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; He walked with God. And that is the same
[2:54:37] way this bride of Jesus Christ is
[2:54:39] walking with God.
[2:54:41] That's the same way she walking with
[2:54:44] God. And one of these days her feet is
[2:54:47] going to get lighter. One of the days
[2:54:50] the things that hel her down are going
[2:54:53] to disappear.
[2:54:56] One of these days that the inner
[2:54:58] struggle, the things she struggle with,
[2:55:01] the thing that the enemy was using to
[2:55:04] plague her and condemn us,
[2:55:09] she's going to get lighter.
[2:55:12] But until that time,
[2:55:15] until that time, let identify those
[2:55:17] things in our life and say, "Oh God,
[2:55:20] help me in this area. Lord, I need you,
[2:55:23] Lord. I need you, God. I need you,
[2:55:25] Father. I don't want to go a day without
[2:55:29] the feeling and need for you.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:55:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:55:47] oh God, we we feel like that little boy.
[2:55:50] Oh God,
[2:55:53] the cloud is so thick. Oh God, and and
[2:55:56] things around us is clouding our mind,
[2:55:59] oh God, but we still feed the poor.
[2:56:03] We still feed a talk, Lord. And we know
[2:56:05] that God, you are on the other side of
[2:56:07] the line.
[2:56:10] Father I pray oh God precious Lord Jesus
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; we have our young people young children
[2:56:17] oh God exposed to a generation oh God
[2:56:20] father that is becoming so crual oh God
[2:56:24] Lord where the life oh God father of man
[2:56:28] is just becoming valueless oh father God
[2:56:31] every day Lord is one death news and uh
[2:56:35] the earth is becoming blooded again oh
[2:56:38] God God, we we just feel it, Lord God.
[2:56:42] Such a such, oh God. Oh Lord God, that's
[2:56:46] the reason why we come to hide ourself
[2:56:48] away. We come Lord God to enter the
[2:56:52] chamber with you, Father. Lord,
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; we say, "Oh God, oh God, Father,
[2:57:01] help our young people, Father, Lord, all
[2:57:04] those that don't have the baptism of the
[2:57:06] Holy Ghost, oh God, that don't have a
[2:57:08] real assurance in their heart, Lord
[2:57:10] Jesus,
[2:57:12] that is not experiencing the new birth
[2:57:14] and living in the new birth, Lord.
[2:57:19] needing victory, oh Lord God, Father, in
[2:57:21] one area of our life or another.
[2:57:30] Oh God,
[2:57:35] you know, Wednesday night,
[2:57:38] we pray for the couple.
[2:57:40] I took a spoken prayer request
[2:57:44] and uh
[2:57:47] Thursday morning we had a fly out to go
[2:57:50] and meet with them got there and visit
[2:57:53] with them a little bit sat down from
[2:57:56] 1000 p.m. all through the night until
[2:57:59] 10:00 a.m.
[2:58:04] And just to see how God sometimes will
[2:58:07] use some of the silliest thing, some of
[2:58:10] the simple thing to reconcile people
[2:58:13] back to the cross
[2:58:17] and reconcile. Sometimes when we just
[2:58:19] take silly things in our life and we
[2:58:22] allow our own selfishness to get a hold
[2:58:26] of us and we don't realize
[2:58:30] that we have a crew of beast in us that
[2:58:32] is ready to to destroy our lives.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; But just to see how the grace of God
[2:58:40] came down,
[2:58:42] just to see how the grace of God came
[2:58:44] down
[2:58:47] and the presence of the Lord just swept
[2:58:49] through the place and we all were in
[2:58:52] tears.
[2:58:57] Oh, all glory to the father.
[2:59:00] Lord, I thank you precious Lord. Oh God,
[2:59:04] knowing father God, Lord Jesus, we can
[2:59:08] walk right out of that presence. Oh God,
[2:59:10] and stay feed into our negativity, feed
[2:59:13] into the devil lies. Oh God, I pray for
[2:59:15] them. I commit them into your hands,
[2:59:18] Lord. Father,
[2:59:19] I say you are the mediator, Lord God. I
[2:59:22] reconcile men back to you. You are the
[2:59:25] only one that can reconcile us to
[2:59:27] ourselves. Oh father,
[2:59:32] dear Lord, I commit your children in
[2:59:34] your hands. Oh father God, as we go
[2:59:37] home, oh God, Father,
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, remind us of this subject. You are
[2:59:42] our spiring partner, Lord.
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why you send us
[2:59:47] trials sometimes. Sometimes you rebuke
[2:59:50] us, oh God, by your spirit. Sometimes,
[2:59:53] oh God, Father, you teach us, you equip
[2:59:56] us, Lord, because you have called us
[2:59:58] into partnership
[3:00:01] and you want us, Lord, to represent you.
[3:00:06] Father, we love you.
[3:00:09] We appreciate you, oh God.
[3:00:12] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[3:00:16] pray father
[3:00:18] and your grace, your love and mercy
[3:00:21] go with us now
[3:00:25] in Jesus name.
[3:00:28] In Jesus name
[3:00:37] without you holding my hands.
[3:00:45] And can
[3:00:48] be one Lord without you holding
[3:00:54] my hand.

[3:01:00] so high. Oh Lord of Valley

[3:01:13] my knees.

[3:01:21] I can't live in one
[3:01:27] without you. Holy.
