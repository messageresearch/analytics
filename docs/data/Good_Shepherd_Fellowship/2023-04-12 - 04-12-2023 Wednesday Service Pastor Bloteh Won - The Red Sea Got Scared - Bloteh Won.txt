the Lord bless you musicians that will be all for the music tonight while we try to find our way into the world let's take our Bibles and Psalm chapter 1 14. Psalm chapter 114 Psalm chapter 114 Let's uh I have a kind of a scatter toss tonight but I'm trusting that the holy spirit will be able to bless it and uh praise the Lord I have my mind lied in a lot of a lot of things but I would just I would just take go this direction tonight and trust that the Lord will be able to bless it praise the Lord Psalm chapter 1 14 I will read the first verse you read the second and uh and we will do like that and then we read uh the last verse together praise the Lord when Israel went out of Egypt the house of Jacob from a people of strange language the sea saw it and fled Jordan was driving back the mountains skip like Rams and a little Hill like that what IV oh thou see that thou fled it thou Jost in that thou was driven back grounds tremble thou f are the presence of the Lord are the presence of the god of Jacob turned right into a standing water and flanked into a fountain of waters praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat tonight the Lord bless you may have you see tonight I will want to read something yeah brother Branham shared in the message of second the second miracle second miracle then I will I will tell you where my thoughts are tonight brother Benham says uh us and it's written one time praise the Lord and it's written one time that when you brought Israel out of Egypt brother Benham was praying he was actually uh praying in the prayer line and uh and he said this and there's a few other places that he he made this statement also and it's written one time that when you brought Israel out of Egypt and they come right up against a mountain the red seed had them bound they could not go over it's said by one of the writer that God looked down through the pillar of Fire look at the Red Sea that had his people pain off from the Promised Land and he looked down with anger and the rest he got scared move back and let Israel cross over into the land and father Satan like the rare seed has Conor of many of your people they are lying bound and Afflicted and sick and when these handkerches reach them this talking of God's grace May the same God look through that pillow of Fire and made their sickness become scared and move back and may they cross over into their promise of good health and the three scores and ten praise the Lord now so I was I was uh first I would say thank you uh thanks for uh being part of the services this weekend all your prayers your presence and support uh making they so we can a blessing for each and every one of us praise the Lord amen so we we are very grateful we are very grateful that we were able to have a a prayer meeting on Friday night that the Lord blessed and then he came and blessed the services praise the Lord now you see that that was there was there was one thing the other uh you know I realized or I noticed during the meeting and what it was is the other sometimes you know we we uh you know pray for the services and pray for the preacher you know and and uh and I I believe some of you you know being the Easter weekend you have some special time with the Lord remembering his death buried in Resurrection you know some people will take their self into a time of consecration praise the Lord that's that's all wonderful but uh I was looking at the service on uh on Sunday you know after the preaching of the word and uh and then just at the end of the service the Holy Spirit just just changed the whole service you know in the way that the message was preached uh uh it it was not like the the you know the usual evangelistical message that will call people to the altar or the usual uh uh uh healing message that will call people for the prayer of need but I think the Holy Spirit Discerning our Niche and you know I knew that we we needed it and then uh uh led the preacher that way and then the people came up another thing there also is the other you see the with with the ministry sometimes as as a congregation you look at the message the preacher preached and sometimes you follow his excitement sometimes we follow you know his knowledge in the word but there is another part of it that we you don't see is a life of consecration a man may not have a very great style of preaching but if you have a consecrated life he knows how to drive the people and that's what I realized this weekend praise the Lord I realize that the preacher has a has a consecrated life amen and and that in itself is is is welcoming to the people praise the Lord a man can have great ministry and know all the Mysteries if he don't have a right life you will struggle to receive from him praise the Lord he will he will be trying to bring out mystery or maybe trying to impress the people but you see this there's a spirit of wrong living if a spirit of wrong living is there you cannot feed God's children that way praise the Lord and so I think that's that was that was that was beautiful I was sitting there then and uh I was you know right after the service and I saw those that came up for prayer and and uh you we were trying to sing and worship you know praise the Lord and uh that that was beautiful that was beautiful that was beautiful now I I read this Psalm tonight and and this quote where brother Brandon says uh God looked through the pillar of fire and the Red Sea got scared I want to take a parallel between the Red Sea and the River Jordan because David used that year in Psalm chapter 19 I mean Psalm 114 as we have just read in another sense David was asking let's see what did you saw that you moved back right praise the Lord he says the rest he saw it and fled and Jordan was driving back what a lot of thee Oh thou see that they are flared thou Jordan that there was driving back so I I bring it to this thought where brother Branham says the seesaw the the the the anger of God's eyes through the pillow of fire and and he pulled back praise the Lord amen now now uh there are a couple of parallel between the the the rare sea and uh the Red Sea and Jordan that I want to look at now because we we coming from a three days meeting I also saw this and many of you might have seen it in the message time Chester Memorial said this he said he said there it happened perfectly he said one of this night this Sunday Services I want to preach on that third day and show you what power is in them there are three I mentioned it this morning in the prayer everybody had three things in the uh numerical of the Bible now so brother Branham you will realize that in Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 2 Joshua chapter 3 there there is a sequence of three and the people were going over Jordan Joshua told him to sanctify themselves three days now so Brother band was making reference to that he says there is something about those three days that he was going to preach on now so seeing there and looking at some things from the the the Book of Joshua there are some few things that I pick up so we will we'll kind of look into them tonight by the grace of God amen and then there is a tear there is a tear Point uh uh Revelation chapter one in Revelation series Birdman was preaching the the church ages Revelation series he talked about uh two different prophecies one was from a woman in the live Tabernacle you know that that prophesied about the meeting and was talking about the you know the the spirit of the law dealing uh during the meeting then he also bring out this prophecy I want to read that too he says a little woman stood up in the meeting a Baptist woman come over there not knowing what she could do and she was standing in the mess of the meeting and the Holy Spirit fell on her and she began to speak with Toms a Baptist woman from the First Baptist Church in Shreveport and then she didn't know what she had did and then before she could say anything the Holy Spirit gave the interpretation said thus said the Lord within three months there will be the spirit of Moses Elijah and Christ ministering in this Tabernacle praise the Lord there it happened perfectly the spirit of Moses the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Christ now the promise of the son of man Ministries sum up uh uh the the the the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Moses so what what I wanted what I want to do here that I'm I'm trying to look at parallel between uh some some similarities of things that happen between the rare seed and uh and the River Jordan and there are some other things also that uh that uh a very a very blessing when you look at it closely and so that's the reason why I'm taking these three coats tonight to be able to uh pray that the Lord will add his Blessing to it praise the Lord and uh and then he will be able to minister to us tonight praise the lord we know that uh you know the prophet also make us to know that nature knows his creator praise the Lord nature knows his creator so when Nature saw his creator hanging on the cross he refused the sun refused to shine even the moon refused to give her light praise the Lord and also here are the rare seed and at the River Jordan we also realize that nature recognized is uh creator also that he was the one that was Leading the People in the pillow of fire in the pillow of clown some of the similarities when it comes to both the the rare seed and uh and uh and uh and the River Jordan that we want to look at tonight both of those uh uh experiencing was led by a prophet praise the lord we know Moses led the people of Israel out of Egypt to uh uh the Wilderness and there they met the racy both of those experience was crossing a body of water and going across it on dry land praise the Lord now you have to you have to follow me a little bit closely tonight or as you will get lost praise the Lord because I'm trying to run a parallel here you got to follow me closely or as you will get lost but uh both crossing the red seed and Crossing Jordan was led by a prophet Moses LED them through the rare sea Joshua LED them through the River Jordan praise the Lord now I want you to take note of this also crossing the water they had a cross on dry land the Bible says God folded the water there's a way that uh uh uh David said a year in the sun he says the the uh uh which turned the rock into standing water deflate into a fountain of water okay that is that is The Rock in the wilderness but you know what God was able to Pat the waters and make a wall and the people pass through that on dry ground praise the Lord amen and are the two experience the River Jordan was overflowing at the time and I believe also the same with the Red Sea praise the Lord but then what is important in this that I want for you to grab tonight is the other the Apostle Paul would take the experience of the Red Sea pay attention to me now he will take the experience of the Red Sea and passing through the rare seed he will take that experience and compare it to a baptism praise the Lord now so keep that in the back part of your mind because the same parallel will be applied to the River Jordan now you have to realize that God told Joshua this day I will magnify you before the people praise the Lord as ours with Moses so will I be with you praise the Lord amen Joshua represents the New Testament Church amen he represents the Holy Ghost with the Believers are we together the same work Jesus Promised the church that the same thing that we saw in his ministry greater ones will see in in the church so I want you to keep that in your mind because we're seeing both the the the ministry of Moses the ministry of Elijah and the ministry of Christ those three Ministries sum up together in the son of man Ministry praise the Lord amen that come to us as a prophetic Ministry praise the Lord and that's the reason why when God promised the the Elijah Ministry in in the book of uh uh uh Makai it start off with remember amen it went back to Moses because those Ministries were coming together so pay attention to me now praise the Lord are we together so those two experience was led by a prophet the crossing of the water they cross the water on dry ground just like the Red Sea the same also with the River Jordan praise the Lord and they were witnessed by the congregation the people witness it the people experience it Moses was not telling them a dream he said stand still you will see the salvation of the Lord praise the Lord and when God instructed him to stretch his Rod over the rare seed he stretch his rod and the people experience it praise the Lord they experience it they walk and I I I I don't believe that uh that uh uh uh there are some of the children never even reached on the ground to pick up some of the sand and hold it in their hands praise the Lord Hallelujah but I also want you to realize that uh it was accounted for March in silence right praise the Lord because the water never went away the water folded like a wall on one side praise the Lord if you do your hands like that you attach to water the water was there but the people walk on dry ground praise the Lord until they went to the other side it was a paradox the congregation Witnesses and even the Egyptians also witness it praise the Lord because they also felt that they could go after the children of Israel and they went after them they got into the middle of the river go slow their wheels down until the last one came out of the watch of the of of the Red Sea the path of the Red Sea praise the Lord amen and go close the water back praise the Lord brother Branham says some some people say that you know it was just uh uh how to call it a read you know uh that that they went through it was not actually a water you know what the the amazing thing about that is that it makes it more miraculous why because pharaoh and his men drowned praise the Lord amen so it makes it more miraculous that they could get drowned in a shadow water praise the Lord and uh the other thing there is that uh David picks their up here we read that in the Sam he says another thing there in the parallel that we're looking at is that both the the Red Sea and the River Jordan was great hindrance praise the Lord if God been now part of the Red Sea there is no way that Israel would have left from that side of the water to the other side praise the Lord and in a way that the Jordan was overflowing if God did not patted it so both the Red Sea and the Jordan was creating great hindrance hendering the people from getting to their promise praise the Lord amen now you see how the way brother Branham Freeman year in this prayer I read that again he says it said that one of the writer that God looked down through that pillow of Fire look at the Red Sea their heart the heart his people paying off from the promise so there is nowhere they could go the mountains on both sides so the Red Sea was pending them down the reality was a great hindrance praise the Lord the same thing with the River Jordan it was a great hindrance and they could never get on the other side are we together praise the Lord so both the rare seed in the River Jordan was causing hindrance and both of them it was a test of faith and obedience praise the Lord because Moses said this Egyptian that you have seen you will see them no more forever and the waters will stay there praise the Lord so it was a test of faith God says to Moses speak and move forward praise the Lord Hallelujah Joshua told the the priests to take the Ark of the Covenant and move into the center of the water it was a test of faith and obedience are we together praise the Lord and uh and the both Crossing was in silence and after the cross the waters came back after the cross the Red Sea the waters came back after the cross the River Jordan the waters came back are we together praise the Lord now so David is taking that year as uh comparing the rare seed and uh and the River Jordan so we want to look into that tonight so those are some of the few parallels I could see in comparing it and another thing I would say is that when they came across the rare sea the uh Exodus chapter 15 Moses sank a song praise the Lord and then when he came across the river Jordan is recorded there they also had a song so it it it started a new day a new day was broken in their life praise the Lord amen they witnessed the Egyptians drowning in the river praise the Lord the ones that went across Jordan they have more confidence that just as God was with Moses he is with Joshua praise the Lord Hallelujah so there are there are other things that I also want for us to for us to look at when we as we look at this and let's go to the Book of Joshua Joshua chapter one Joshua chapter 1 let's read verse 10 and 11. then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare the investor for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God given you to possess praise the Lord Joshua chapter 2 praise the Lord in Joshua chapter 2 let's look at uh uh let's look at rehab here with these men let's look at verse 14. and the men answer her our life for yours if your alternate our business and it shall be when the Lord have given us the land that we made word that we will deal kindly and truly with deep then she let them down by a call through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwered upon the world and she said unto them gets you to the mountain least the pursuer meets you and hire yourself there three days until the past year return praise the Lord amen so we see another three day uh situation we're going to look a little bit into that yeah as if the Lord will give us Grace tonight but there are just some few things that I want for us to look at now we go over to Joshua chapter 3. praise the Lord now in Joshua chapter 3 they have uh uh already uh uh get out of the aspired the land of Jericho they have they have gone back and made their report now to uh Joshua the amount about to advance on the city of Jericho praise the Lord we read here in verse 7 and the law said unto Joshua this day I will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they might know that as ours with Moses so will I be will be praise the Lord amen now but when they get down here there is something that uh that uh uh that in India India crossing over here we see here that Joshua will begin to instruct the people from verse 11 that the priests will take the ark and they will go into the river praise the Lord he will instruct them to go and uh they will stand in the middle of the river and then the people will come and pass through praise the Lord amen whatever you you will appreciate this because we'll get we'll get back to those 12 Stones that you and myself talk about some time ago now so to this place you find where Joshua now and he's uh telling the children of Israel here that they are going to make a memorial you're going to make a memorial and the memorial is that uh Joshua is going to tell them to take 12 Stones that represent the the 12 tribes praise the Lord and they will come to give God and they will build an altar with their 12 Stones they will build a memorial with their 12 Stones praise the Lord amen and the Bible will let us to know also that uh after Joshua tell them to do that if you look in verse 9 of chapter 4 and Joshua set up 12 Stones also in the midst of Jordan in a place where the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the confidence stood and they are there until this day so we see that Joshua had them to make one Memorial outside of 12 Stones praise the Lord and He also hired them to make another Memorial in the midst of the River Jordan of 12 Stones praise the Lord and the reason of those Memorial it was for them to to if their children will ask them or for them to tell their children the great Redemption that God brought to them the great Deliverance that God brought to them that these 12 Stones you are seeing out here in gerga it was taken from in the midst of the River Jordan so they took it from from where they crossed they were able to gather huge stones and set them apart praise the Lord amen now I bring you back to something here but uh let's let's go over in the book of Saint John chapter 1. this is a Wednesday night Saint John chapter one Now read some other things of brother Brandon to you tonight see John chapter one let's read from verse 26. John answered them saying a baptized with water but there's 10 of one among you whom yeah no net he it is who cometh after me Who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe lashes I'm not wanted to lose these things were done in Beth Barra Beyond Jordan now just like Bethlehem just just like we say Bethlehem that's the same way Dev Barra means the house of Passage so what what picture comes to your mind John where he was baptizing where John was standing in a water baptizing is called the house of Passage praise the Lord don't make conclusion yet praise the Lord Matthew chapter 3. now you have to remember is the spirit of Elijah the spirit of Moses and the spirit of Christ that is Tabernacle in with the brine praise the Lord amen Matthew chapter 3. Matthew chapter 3 . let's read from verse 6. verse 4 and it came and the same John had his women of camel Hill and uh letting gather around about his Lawns and his meat was Locus and honey then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around about Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins but when but when he saw many of the Pharisees and the Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them all Generation of Vipers who have warned you to flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit meat for repentance and thing now to say within yourself we have Abraham to our father for I said unto you that God is able of these stones now he's standing in Jordan he's baptizing in Jordan and where he's baptizing is called the path the house of Passage praise the Lord you're seeing the picture is the picture getting clearer praise the Lord and amen now so you see there is there is something I mean the word of God Is So Perfect okay he says it's not man hands that can put these things together praise the Lord the word of God is perfect it's very perfect praise the Lord now the Bible says here John is standing in Beth baraf where he's baptizing and these tribes and Pharisees comes and then you know and he's he's rebuking them he's trying to make them to know don't don't take to yourself don't don't don't allow your system to deceive you now you have to realize that God had a purpose why he instructed Joshua to build that Memorial praise the Lord amen and it was two memorials that is the reason why water baptism has to be a revelation to you praise the Lord God has a reason why he had Joshua to put kept one in the water and one on the land praise the Lord amen I don't want to go ahead of myself I'll try to stay in my time tonight but Joshua says don't say I mean John said don't think to say to yourself we have Abraham as our father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children onto Abraham so the coveting that God made with Abraham our father of breaking his people back to the promised land he instructed Joshua to build a memorial praise the Lord and that Memorial will always remind the people that there is a promise praise the Lord that there is a promise now so we see we see the similarity there because you have to realize that Moses uh Joshua was a successor of Moses praise the Lord so we see the similarity there with Moses and Joshua in in the experience there at the River Jordan now when we go over to the book of Kings you also now see the experience of Elijah and Elijah with the same River Jordan praise the Lord amen when Elijah talk Ahab and the prophets of God on my camera praise the Lord the Bible says he built an altar unto the Lord of what 12 Stones praise the Lord amen and brother Branham was his Elijah was restoring the altar of the Lord so being a prophet of restoration he was restoring the memorial praise the Lord halleluia just like over the ages with all the the denomination and everything uh the the word of God brother Brandon says Bob the clergy and the leotists who have all gone astray yes praise the Lord there is no smart way people that we can find our way back to God except by the instruction of God's prophet there is no better way to run the church God don't run his church on people's ideas he run his church on the restored of the day praise the Lord so if you look at Elijah Ministry if you read a book of Kings you will realize that if you look at Elijah administrator let's let's get to the book of Kings a little bit let's just read read yeah praise the Lord amen first king now so for Elijah to come under the honor the inspiration to to to rebuild or repair an author of 12 Stones meaning that the 12 Stones outside of Jordan the monument that that Joshua instructed them to build to remind the people of where God brought them from it was destroyed praise the Lord you see that it is also like if you look at uh the Prophet Jeremiah you look at the tarody praise the Lord God told Jeremiah that I'm going to redeem this land let your your cursing amen praise the Lord because I'm going to bring my people back here this land should be purchased and one of the evidence you must dig the Earth and keep it there so there was one evidence that was kept in the Earth and there is another evidence that was kept at the house praise the Lord God is giving a memorial to Israel he kept one in the River Jordan and he put one on the show praise the Lord amen the one on the shore they could take the Rocks away but for you to take the one in Jordan you must play the water again praise the Lord amen the one outside you can you can throw the stone away then scatter it but the one that was built praise the Lord now watch this Joshua say ish man from a tribe must take a stone and go and build the one outside the one in the middle of the water the Bible said Joshua himself praise the Lord brother Branham said it's just like the Chinese Laundry man he said those days when the Chinese laundromat started doing laundry they didn't know how to speak and anything but you come and bring your laundry the tear the paper and give you one and they keep another one and when you come to collect your laundry they had the two people has to match are we together where are we we're supposed to be in the book of Kings are we in first king praise the Lord Hallelujah you love the Lord tonight so we're supposed to be in first king chapter 18. first king chapter 18 let's read from verse 30. and Elijah said unto all the people come night unto me and all the people came night unto him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down praise the Lord that's that's the significance of the Elijah Ministry he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down any larger took 12 Stones I calling to the number of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying is Rashad thy name because and wave the stones he built an altar In The Name Of The Lord and made a trench about the altar as great as who contain two measures of seed praise the Lord Hallelujah let's drop down to verse 36 and it came to pass at the evening offering at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came night and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God of Israel and that I am that seven and that I have done all these things at that word just like you have instructed me the same God that instructed him to rebuild the altar was the same God that instructed Joshua and said take 12 Stones and Bill a memorial praise the Lord are we together I've done all these things according to that word then the rest was history praise the Lord but another amazing thing will happen another amazing thing will happen I want you to watch the parallel here now the amazing thing that will happen is that Elijah will take Elijah at the end of his ministry to take Elijah across the Jordan praise the Lord the same way Moses had to experience The Parting of the water to bring the people out Elijah would take Elijah at the Jordan and he will Pat the waters praise the Lord glory be to God are we together tonight amen praise the Lord laughs you know when brother Branham was preaching the the seals there is this notable vision about the Rock where the light never shined upon and in that vision he told the people to keep your eyes on that praise the Lord which of course we know all of those things came to the opening of the seal amen the mysteries of God that was kept from the foundation of the world will be revealed and the prophet of God says that's what that messenger of Malachi fall in Revelation 10 will do amen revealing those Mysteries that we literally turn our heart back praise the Lord now when the Bible will tell you when Elijah had that seen on my camera we know that uh the fire came down and consumed his sacrifice but yet the children of Israel continue the Bible says they continue in the Sin of jerubram praise the Lord but you see the prophet has already done his work he said Lord let it be it should be this thing that would turn the heart of the people I'll read that again verse 36 and it came to pass at a time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob let it let it be known this day that thou I God in Israel and that I am that seven and that I have done all these things at that word Hear Me O Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art God Thou Art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again praise the Lord amen what turned your heart back the rebuilding of the altar praise the Lord it is not the uh uh uh all of the things that they were practicing in their church and their religion that turned their heart back no is the rebuilding of the altar are we together Hallelujah as far as God was concerned the work of Elijah was done the heart of the people will come back to him praise the Lord as far as God is concerned there might have been men that might have rose up and tried to make a sin out of what you have I believe the sons of the prophets were trying to make a mockery out of what Elijah did I thought you said the heart of the people will turn back say wow wow there's a bunch of idolatry stay happening in the land praise the Lord by Elijah said it it's being said so it will be done that thou has turned the heart of the people back again are we together I spoke on this many years back uh preaching on the restoration of the broken altar but I just I was just looking at this parallel just looking at these parallels that we are looking at tonight and now we will realize that Elijah at the end of his ministry he would tell this young Elijah to wait I'm going to gilga praise the Lord Elijah said as long as your soul liveth I will not leave you amen he says I'm going to uh uh uh going across Jordan praise the Lord yeah Elijah said Elijah said as long as your soul liveth I'm not going to leave you praise the Lord we even tell from the scripture that those sons of the prophets had an idea that this Prophet will be taken away Hallelujah but any larger we carry a larger through that experience of the splitting of Jordan amen and then they would go walk praise the Lord the Bible did not give us any kind of a Pacific here but we can ride on the authoritative of the scripture amen if if John the Baptist honored the spirit of Elijah who identified the very place where they cross to do his baptism then let me not suggest to you Hallelujah amen but you see that that is the beauty of the word that's the beauty of the word that God I mean this was not just this thing is happening this month and this thing is happening this other month John the Baptist at the age of nine years old will go in the wilderness come out of the Wilderness with the spirit of Elijah and he will be able to identify that place the Lord are we together Elijah will go across Jordan by the pattern of the water and when they get on the other side Jordan is going to close just like it did for Joshua and and the people and Elijah will take his essay Elijah will be rapture and Elijah must return praise the Lord amen but he asks Elijah for a double portion praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together you see the kind of the the anointing that is on this last day bride is to wrap up everything the ministry of Moses Elijah and Christ in the same Tabernacle once again we are on mass Transfiguration praise the Lord amen we must be able to log in the word and see the brightness of his glory are we together Hallelujah the time will now allow us tonight but we still have more time praise the Lord but what I want where I wanted to bring us tonight I think I got you to that place amen just to be able to see all of these parallel and Elijah will ask for a double portion of the spirit of Elijah praise the Lord and Elijah would tell him if you see me Glory I can give it to you praise the lord I can't give it to you but if you see me going glory be to God Hallelujah you see many of those people that came out of Egypt that were Desiring the garlic of Egypt they couldn't go back because there was not a Moses to open the Red Sea praise the Lord so all the Crave that they had for Egypt they had to die in the wilderness because for them to go back to Egypt they need another one to open the Red Sea and the commission was to go forward not going back praise the Lord amen so uh I mean you you you cannot sit under this message with a desire for Egypt you go you will die in the wilderness praise the Lord are we together God has to kill our desire for this present word Hallelujah amen it will have to die for us to move forward so Elijah Elijah will have to keep his eyes single Jesus says when we keep our eyes single he says if our eyes is double we will miss the promise Elijah has to keep his eyes praise the Lord now you think about it there was nothing a natural that Elijah could give to Elisha or Elijah said Elijah said to Elijah Ace if you see me going praise the Lord in the vision brother Branham says keep your eyes on this tone it's all pointing back to Christ the word Your Eyes On Christ he is the Altar and the finisher of our faith the Bible called it the Lord of Liberty that while we keep our eyes on him looking unto Jesus that's what changes our life praise the Lord you got to keep your eyes on Christ you got to be in the word you got to take your desires back to the word take your thoughts back to the word if it is not the word no matter how fancy it is Let It Go praise the Lord Elijah had to keep his eyes on Elijah praise the Lord and that's the place where we are people we have a lot of Destruction around us praise the Lord a lot of Destruction I mean well the technology word has just has just blurred our vision because I mean just new things are popping up all the time the world is having so much entertainment right praise the Lord by Elijah said keep your eyes if you see me going and you will have the double portion Jordan is close Elijah has to get back there's a finish work praise the Lord amen in my mind I'm thinking that Elijah took him across Jordan and say son you see these stones when God brought our fathers out of Egypt praise the Lord This Promise is real Hallelujah we are having living Memorial the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a living Memorial foreign the Holy Ghost is not just a uh you know it's not a thought it's a living Memorial God is still changing lives God is still delivering his people God is still giving people overcoming power because we have a living Memorial praise the Lord Elijah said if you see me going Hallelujah well you asked for you will receive it and as long as we can keep our eyes on Christ we can keep our eyes on Christ whatever we need is in him praise the Lord I was going to speak a little bit on the filter mistake of Exodus chapter 19 but we will get there and what the the talk about it there is the other that's the same thing that is haunting us you know when God take for example when God told Israel be your holy as I'm holy most of the time in our human mind we we understand it the way the human mind says is is almost like uh uh you have to do something to be holy you got to stop your line to be holy you got to stop your stealing to be holy you got to dress right to be holy praise the Lord but if the god that caught us to Holiness is a holy God in him just like Paul says in him we can find everything that he's requiring of us praise the Lord just like Elijah saying to Elijah if you see me Glory it's almost the same of everything that the word has required of us is already here and Paul says uh forsake now the assembling of ourself well it is part of it part of it is this but you see the more that you associate with the word the more you get into God's Presence by prayer the more you stay under the atmosphere of the word the more you are changing into his image praise the Lord that's how the birth comes that's how the overcoming power comes praise the Lord how may we cannot get you cannot get stronger in prayer if you are if I mean if if you are not disciplined to spend time with God In Prayer praise the Lord you can now overcome the battles of the Mind praise the Lord you can overcome the battles of the mind if you don't take time to put Christ on your mind if you don't take time to meditate upon him is just thinking upon thinking upon the law that's what cast those other thoughts away praise the Lord over the years the church has made it as things that you have to practice know Elijah said if you see me going son you have the double portion to go back and do the finish work praise the Lord In The Same Spirit that raised of Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies praise the Lord it will Quicken your mortal bodies I can say it like this that Elijah had to carry Elijah to go and show him the evidence that was unseen the one that was not to the public the spirit of Moses Elijah in Christ is in the same Tabernacle praise the Lord Hallelujah and as long as we stay with the word we cannot go wrong we cannot go wrong in our choices we cannot go wrong in the way we order our family as long as we stay with the word praise the Lord if you fabricate your own Holiness it will fail praise the Lord is going to fail and you will make a shipwreck of the of the Life of Christ but when you stay with the word he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord brother Branham says let thou seem fill our fire now look at the Red Sea with an Angry Eyes look at ours our weaknesses look at our sicknesses look at the things that are bothering us praise the Lord the musicians can come tonight Turn Your Eyes On Jesus Turn Your Eyes On Jesus [Music] um [Music] in the light thank you

there is always the day of life that's what our lord Jesus came out on the table Jesus first miracle it was on the tedding they have always been a time of life so God was taking his people into the promise of life he was taking them into the inheritance of life sanctify yourself three days as Jonah was in the world ballet for three days and when he came out he brought a Revival to Nineveh the son of man will be in the heart of the Earth it's a season of life it's a time of life it's a time for us to enjoy this the call of the land it's time for us to enjoy the blessing of the Holy Ghost the sweetness of this message the life of Jesus Christ all we have to keep our eyes on the Lord we have to look into his word we have to keep our eyes on the Lord enjoy looking into his face Mary his

no way you can enjoy this message from past experience it has to be a daily experience it has to be and every dead encounter with the Lord foreign precious Lord God we stand tonight Lord father just trying to take a parallel here Lord Garden to see the father Lord the same thing you did through the ministry of Moses you did it in Joshua Ministry father Lord but it was it was to a a higher pick Lord father you said you would magnify yourself in this ministry he hired Moses had the pillar of Fire by night and the pillow of club or Joshua the angel of the Covenant he had an angel of the Covenant he had a man standing with him in a battle precious Lord father we see the larger coming on the scene Elijah the Tish breath restoring the Broken Heart of father oh God bringing the house of

thank you for bearing with me thank you for [Music] following me on my rabbit Trail tonight praise the Lord [Music] what you see let me say this and then we be dismissed like I told you one time when the children of Israel came through the Red Sea Moses tapped that to a baptism [Music] but the children of Israel and the Egyptian which one of them were covered by water it was the Egyptians that were covered by water so you see that's the reason why our experience the the the the the the the I will when when we identify with Jesus identify with the death burial and Resurrection that step that you took to go down in the water have to be a revelation to you it's not the water that's safe because the Egyptians were covered by water and they all got drowned it has to be a revelation you have to know that they are there when you step down that water foreign with Christ and you Rose up with him no matter what the devil is doing around your life that experience that experience of water baptism that's the reason why brother Branham said there is three elements that Jesus left with his church what a baptism and he says when you do the communion remember me remember what I did for you the Lord bless you I will see you on Sunday yes oh yes we walk in the light beautiful light oh come with the Dew drops of Mercy a bright shine off around us foreign [Music] Jesus Christ we walk in the Lord bless you let's go home oh yes [Applause] foreign [Music]
