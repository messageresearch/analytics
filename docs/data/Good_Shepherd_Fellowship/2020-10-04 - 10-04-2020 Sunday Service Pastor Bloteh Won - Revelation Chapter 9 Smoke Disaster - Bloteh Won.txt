we will do the rest of the worship and singing this is the first sunday in october praise the lord and thank you for all the birthday wishes uh appreciated in all your prayers amen and we just we just thank the lord for for all his goodness upon our life and just because of all of the [Music] the reason why many few of the things have to be tested in the past week that's the reason why we are not going to have our communion service today but what i was thinking about is that and i would like to talk to all the brothers after the service and we want to talk about uh we're getting into the cold season uh uh we pretty soon we'll be taking the tank down from the back there so we have to trust the law to see how we will you know organize our service and and accommodate ourselves so that's what we want to just talk about right after the service with all of the brothers and then we will now bring them out before the church revelation chapter 9 that's what i'll be reading from this morning and praise the lord praise the lord amen praise the lord revelation chapter 9. so one of the things that we might also discuss is how we will approach our communion service during the lockdown it didn't that stop us from having communion service we took it the bible way we went from house to house so we were able to gather families and you know bring people together in the same area in into a home you know and then we we we did that so uh maybe we might take that approach until this entire kovic cloud is lifted from over us praise the lord by the by the way there we had a community service with uh bro wesley and sister carrick they've been they've been wanting to do that uh since they missed the last communion service so thursday night they were able to do a birthday party for me at the house and and the convenience service after so i was grateful for that amen revelation chapter nine let's reverse one that i won't keep you standing very long and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven onto the earth and to him was giving the key of the bottomless pit to him was giving the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there rose a smoke out of the pay as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the path and they came out of the small locust upon the earth and unto them was giving power as the scorpions of the earth have power and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green things neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their forehead let's pray together you can read the rest heavenly father lord jesus we just want to trust you this morning father this is a book of your revelation lord of the things law that must shortly come to pass dear god we cannot help but believe that we are stepping into the pages of scriptures with all of the things that is happening around us lord and around the world we just want to ask your help this morning if there's ever the time we need your help it's right now come lord take your word break it to our heart so father precious lord jesus oh god we we uh you have not given us the spirit of fear that's what your worship you have given us the spirit of boldness and the sound mind right in your word father lord we are standing oh god with uh with a revered word lord father behind a prophet a vindicator prophet message so lord we we are confident this morning the lord god if we if we just stay with your word just as it was delivered unto us by your prophet oh god there's no way that we can go wrong we ask that you give us grace this morning as we look into these things father in jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat this morning i want to take a little subject that i tied to smoke disaster i want to talk on smoke disaster i want to talk on smoke disaster and i took this little thought from uh uh i was i was looking at uh our going through some of our oil tapes uh all services that were recorded on on those cassette tapes and i was playing one of them in in the vehicle uh you know you know sometimes you you listen to yourself you say oh god this young man needs help amen praise the lord say oh god this young man needs help please help me lord jesus amen but then i took uh i was just listening to to one of those services we had and and that's what i took this this uh this inspiration from and i went back and and started looking at uh some few things there and then also i i decided to to look at uh uh some documentaries on uh on on smoke disasters because uh i was i was listening to a report one time and i think out of california and with all of the fire going there you know and [Music] you know a lot of the things that that you know that can go wrong i was talking with uh one of my little sisters that lived there in california and she was telling me you know how when they wake up in the morning uh you notice the they see their whole vehicles are covered with arches just like we have our cars covered with snow you know and i mean the place was just so smoky you know and and and you know visibility was not good you can hardly see and i think there was a day here in minneapolis that the weather reported that visibility in the morning was affected because of the smoke from california you know that was just how serious it was and and and and the thing that prove it again is because i had a i have a friend that worked with uh with fedex through the airport and uh and he was telling me you know that morning uh they were wondering what was happening you know because i mean the visibility outside was not good but yet they could smell you know the smoke in the end praise the lord you know so uh [Music] and and uh in in a natural disaster you know smoke disaster also has been proven to be to be very dangerous most especially in in you know in fire uh you know where there is a disaster of fire whether it's a house burn or you know uh uh you know what like the fire going on in california what affects the people is the smoke praise the lord the people can get away from the fire if they are able to keep themselves from the smoke but when you start in hitting that smoke you know and and it gets into your system it start weakening you praise the lord you know you can run for fire you can run from fire but you can run from smoke because for you to run you need to breathe and the smoke is already in the air 1948 in pennsylvania there was there was uh there was a disaster that was called the smok disaster somg no smog sorry it was called a smug disaster and and this disaster for for many times because at that time there was there was a plant a steel plant in in pennsylvania and that was one of the you know it was it was it was helping the economy at that time so when this happened because i mean the people woke up that morning and the and the whole setting you know was just on a smoke so everybody was looking at the plant they thought that the problem was coming from the plant and it was it was after many years before they realized that no the problem was not coming from the plant it was it was a natural disaster what happened is that it was it was f temperature you know according to to the history of the documentary the rest of the states in america was fine but right in that city in in in pennsylvania right in that city the air just hovered over that city and it was not moving for some reason and it just it just created you know that that smoke and people lost their life also i mean it was so and then in 1952 london also had the same thing praise the lord not london had the same disaster like that you know uh that that just that just naturally came from from from air temperature praise the lord but this morning we want to look at uh you know smoke disaster uh revelation chapter nine smoke disaster that's the way i would like to tie to it praise the lord amen and uh and one thing that is common in smoke disaster is that everybody wear max that's one thing that is common so if you cannot see it there is no way i can make this scripture ever clearer to you than for you to look at yourself very much amen we are in a smoke disaster but this is a spiritual smoke disaster and that's what we want to talk about by the help of the lord brother dan was preaching on wednesday night great about ever fought in and we appreciate our brother for for uh that inspiration that he brought to us wednesday night it was beautiful but branham says greater battle ever fought he says here the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt all mine between liberty and bondage amen he says the great about to ever thought is going on right now right here right now and it's between life and death praise the lord the word has come to bring us life amen but we also have to realize that the enemy like like our brother said quoting the prophet you know what satan tactics is to destroy our confidence in the word praise the lord he we can have the bible in our hands we can have the tips of the prophet we can have brother brandon picture we can but if he destroy the confidence in the word then the word is useless praise the lord and the way that the enemy can destroy the confidence in the world is either pushing the promise to the future or taking you back to a historical jesus he can take you back to the history of the message and and and and the history of jesus in nazareth he can take you back to a prophet that was in indiana jeffersonville and and uh but jesus says i've come to give life and to give it abundantly and i believe that uh uh he want to give us life now this morning amen praise the lord to kind of for quicken that word and make it real to us hallelujah he says that greater battle is going on now between sickness and health praise the lord we have to fight to keep ourselves healthy amen we have to fight to keep ourselves healthy and he says that greater battle is going on between faith and doubt praise the lord between faith and doubt and it's also going on be uh uh it's a battle of liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spear sold your polish your armor at that soldier in the house this morning praise the lord amen glory be to god do you know where your spirit is amen do you have your armor glory be to god the battle is on shine your spear sold your polish your armor god is getting his sodium ready and how is he getting us ready dressing us with this word he's getting us ready by putting us into the promise of our day praise the lord this message of the hour is not 1965 message praise the lord it's not 1942 message this message of the hour is a message that is able to address our everyday situation it has an answer for everyday question and everyday problem praise the lord if the message could not address our situation god would not tell his prophet to put those food away he would not tell him to store those food because 1965 many of us were not around praise the lord amen so while god is getting his arm his his his saudi already amen god anoint his army he anoint his army how does he do it by the word praise the lord every other anointing can fail the anointing of sensation and feelings and emotion can fail but the anointing of the word remains right god is anointing his army with the word i mean i i just want to read few things to you because i'm going to go into daniel prophecy and and and show you uh by the grace of god by the grace of god and by the help of the lord amen brother branham says god provide a way of healing he says but look friends the time is coming that when there is rising up at church remember now god is anointing his army god is getting his his uh his saudis ready so brother branham says there is rising up at church he says if we can have faith for divine healing how are we going to have faith for a rapture amen so what what what is that rising which means god is building faith in his church amen he's rising up a church he's building fit in his church he's he's raising the people that is now beginning to have more confidence in the world praise god praise the lord amen i've just i just listened to to uh the prophet in a week he says uh uh uh talking there um blasphemer's name that's the message i was listening to you know and then he was he was uh encouraging you know us how we have to be sincere with this message amen he said we have to be sincere with this truth thank you jesus praise the lord now brother branham gave i mean god gave brother branham a dream a vision about crossing over jordan and in in in the vision he heard a voice told him about crossing over jody and and and when he was about to cross over jordan that that is the vision that came the the mamba snake okay so the mamba snake was trying to attack him so so in in the vision the interpretation was the the the the mamba snake that represent the enemy was trying to stop him from going over jordan and we have to realize it is across jordan last our inheritance amen our inheritance lies across jordan our inheritance lies in the holy ghost we must go beyond church members and go into the baptising of the holy ghost that's where our inheritance lands now so here is this mamba snake was trying to stop him from going and uh uh and and he says what it was it was it was a dangerous snake and and uh uh you know approaching and and the lord kind of for helping you know uh and he rebuked he says when i rebuked the snake in the name of the lord jesus it gets very small praise the lord and then it bounced back up again but he was with some other brothers praise the lord and the snake left him and started but when he came out of that vision you know all right in that vision before he came out of the vision the holy spirit told him if you can be more sincere if you can be more sincere there is nothing there is nothing that can bring us in the place of our inheritance then being sincere are we together praise the lord i'm hoping and praying that the lord will be able to help us as we look into this subject this morning to realize that look the days of church member has passed praise the lord the days of church member has passed like we have said here over and over i mean if you are playing church you just doing it to yourself are we together amen he says here we continue we have got to move our friends we have got to get out of this all slow church condition that we are in this all slow church condition we want to be pat on the back we want to be reminded to come to church we want to be we must get out of that praise the lord we must get out of there with this with this smoke disaster that we are now in i will show to you some from the scripture that we are in this smoke disaster praise the lord with this smoke disaster that we are in it's no time to be slow because you have to realize when you inhale the toxic of the of the of the smoke it affects your system and you start losing strength that's what kills people in in in fire and smoke disaster you have to you have to get away from the smoke as as quick and fast as you can so you can be able to breathe praise the lord so we must get out of this this slow church condition that we are in step out launch out cut the shoreline this is somebody that is that is that is running for survival there is no time to play amen that's there's no time to talk to i mean uh uh uh i mean start looking for jewelry boxing uh and and looking for i mean we're talking about a disaster that is going on the shoreline and get out into somewhere where you lose all senses of fear and doubt amen cut the shoreline and get out into somewhere where you lose all sense of fear and that you know where you are standing amen you know where you are standing and out there where all things are possible brother just as free as it can be you have got yourself set towards heaven come with me amen come what may the rapture the the the the changing of our body amen is is the future that we are looking up to you have got yourself set towards heaven and nothing can steal you no way you are gone that way and that's all nothing can harm you he says and now that's the kind of a church that's going to be one of these days i call into the bible amen i call into the bible at a time where god is pouring out his word and preparing this church now listen now he says i call into the bible where the angel poured paul arrived and diseases broke out revelation chapter nine that's where we are coming to amen he says where the angel poured our wrath and diseases broke out and man even rotting in their flesh where they are standing and the fowls of the air come down and eat off their shoulder now you see when you when we read these things over in the in the in the book of revelation uh we we term to have a natural mind or a physical uh uh image of these things but you have to know the book of revelation is the it's a symbolic book amen files of the earth has always been a type of demon spirit praise the lord you remember that man in joseph's dream the birds came in and ate and ate uh uh from his basket or whatever they showed that he was going to die joseph interpreted the dream you know you're going i mean your hair would be cut off you know so so uh i mean it's uh it's it's all of these sicknesses that is pouring out on the earth cancer you know what uh affecting people in every part of your body you know brain in in intestinal cancer every part of their body you know and all of that you know uh is is it's all of these things you know and uh you know eat of their shoulder in in and eat the flesh of the chief captain and great men and and and presidents and and and warriors you know diplomats and put and take and and and and all of these people amen and i just read news and and uh uh our president doing well in his health and we we pray that god will be able to bring him through praise the lord but you see yeah it's it's just it's just like it's just like this you know when these things come it don't spare anybody no matter what is your status called the only thing that keeps you away from it is the seal of god [Music] the only thing that keeps you away from it is the seal of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen praise the lord amen and with all of these things we we we know the prime minister there in in in the uk came down with faith and i think the uh uh brazil president and a lot of a lot of the you know big mans of the earth but that's what the prophet of god is saying here that's what he's addressing here when the lead is taken out of hell and and the smoke starts to pour out the only people that survive the smoke disaster are those that are sealed praise the lord amen are we together you know president warriors diplomats important taking and and everything but the angel was giving charge don't you come near anyone that got the seal of god in their forehead praise the lord and you know that and that that was just how this this this inspiration struck me about this smoke the disaster because what happened is that when a smoke disaster comes in a home the only thing that i save is those food that are sealed and a smoke disaster is so terrible that a leaf a leaf is print everywhere amen a recall of the walls they sent leave on your clothes praise the lord amen everything you tried to drink or saw there is just some kind of a taste of burn i don't know if you have ever experienced that or if you have ever been around a fire you know a disaster where there was smoke all over the place i mean it's it leaves a spring everywhere nothing is untouched the only thing that that are not touched are those things that are sealed it might affect the outside but it cannot get inside because it's sealed [Music] the bottle might smell like it but the spiciness is still inside the butt oh glory be to god amen oh praise the lord my my my my mind praise the lord are we together amen amen on change i mean uh on unchangeable word of god what brandon says he says that's the reason why angels don't visit the churches that's the reason angels don't visit homes we have got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing praise the lord what is happening i mean where we are now in time people where we are now in time there are a lot of things that are happening behind the scenes amen there are a lot of things you remember branham says we are going to go through deep waters and why are we saying these things to be able to to bust your faith this morning praise the lord amen just to be able to boost your faith he says that's the reason why his uh uh angels don't visit our homes we have got to get down to deep sincerity on the on on this thing the angel of god a year on earth tonight just the same as they have always been the holy ghost has been here ever since the resurrection of jesus christ and and and and the coming forth of pentecost he's appeared true the ages are down getting a remnant of people together the rest of it is uh uh kind of father he says i would just tell you that praise the lord he says uh uh is a father that there will mix with smoke out of torment yes sir it will take a born-again experience a born-again experience watched in the blood of the lamb sanctified filled with the holy ghost or they will never make that rapture or in another sense who says that's what it would take or else you will never get out of this smoke disaster that's what it takes to survive this smoke disaster that is on the world it's a spiritual smoke disaster that that brett brown says is it's mix and we're going to talk about the mixing of political religious powers amen the mixing of of uh political uh religious and uh and there's another one there but i i don't want to get ahead of myself i'm just i'm just kind of for saying this so to to make us to see that uh you know we are we are praying and i believe i believe that god is going to give us uh you know a waving uh you know uh uh we might go back to now weary max and and but until before we get there i mean there are a lot of things that is happening you know uh i mean a lot of things is behind this and and one of the great things there also is that the devil is using this to plague the world with fear he's using this to plague the world with fear and just like brother branham says that's where the battle is amen god is bringing his word he's showing us i told you we will get down to this place i said it to you we will get down to this place it's just like jeremiah was warning the people and telling them the lion from the north is coming talking about babylon he was telling them all of these things and the religious people they were just plain religious we are god's people we are in the message you know and he was saying they never took it real but when the captivity came it swept every one of them and swept him praise the lord are we together i mean we go out and uh we have to go to work and and and uh the students have to go to school and and and and i mean we are living in this world we are living in this world praise the lord we can lock ours we we cannot lock ourselves up you know in the house or in the room and says well that you know and that is the thing that will save us no praise the lord the thing that will save you is the baptism of the holy ghost just when the this whole thing started there was a lady that complained there in north carolina right right from the very time she heard you know uh i think she got some relative that told her about everything happening there in china even just before we started experiencing everything in north carolina she she sealed her house locked herself and she was right in the house and she got covered praise the lord you're right in the house and she got coffee i read that on the news field of morning you know this woman complaining and you know how did it happen i never left my house praise the lord says when jesus when he resurrected and met the disciples the bible says when he met them the scripture says he breathed upon them and he says receive you the holy ghost that's the that's the bride us again in a smoke disaster we need an oxygen kian and the arson yanking is to breathe the promised promises of god amen is to brief on god's promises yes amen amen yes we will do everything we take all the measures we do everything that is required of us to do but there is there is a thing that is most important is breathing on those promises in the morning breathe in your oxygen amen take the word of god look for the promise and breathe in that oxygen glory be to god amen let's travel a little bit here daniel chapter seven because this is the way that i go and i don't even start preaching yet daniel chapter 7 are we together now you we have to know that brother branham taught us by the message that that the beginning of the gentile kingdom started in the book of daniel amen it started in the book of daniel when god gave nebuchadnezzar a dream and we all know about nebuchadnezzar dream that he had the dream that troubled him amen his dream troubled him he was so troubled that when he came out of sleep he could not remember the dream and that was what he sent for the wise men and the requirement was they had to tell him his dream and tell him the interpretation that's the king what are you talking about tell you your dream at least if you can tell us the dream we can figure out what it means but you can't remember the thing that you say we should tell you the dream but because he was so troubled just think about it he put those men life on their own head because he was so troubled and that's what god does when god is doing something around your life he make you so troubled until you feel like this is your last day on earth i mean he trouble you food does not taste good in your mouth sleep is not restful to your body and when a person gets into that condition it means that god is dealing with you you remember what brother i'm talking about zacchaeus when zacchaeus wife was praying for him he said when he turned like this he rode on the bed he turned like this he get up he go to the bathroom he comes back again he tried to sleep he lay his hands like this until he got to wake up early in the morning to go and find that jesus god knows how to make a man restless amen he knows how to make immortal restless glory be to god sometimes he would just it would just be like a desire and sometimes you think maybe it's money but you start getting money you realize hey i've not failed that desire sometimes you think maybe it's marriage you get married i have not feel that desire sometimes you think it's the nesting and you get it but it is god just staring he knows how to get down in the cells of our body and makes us uncomfortable and get out to the place to seek his face he knows how to do it that's why paul said it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of the living god nebuchadnezzar god so troubled so so trouble he says if you don't tell me my dream and interpretation your hairs are off then they knew that it was serious then they knew that it was serious praise the lord amen nobody could do it but daniel was also part of the council and so that's how the mother reached down here and he was brought into into all of this but you see that like brother brown says he says that's that's the way that divine gave operator i just heard him say that on blasphemous name uh a couple of days i was listening to it he says he said that's how the divine gave operates he says you cannot be able to bring an interpretation until god gave you that dream you have to dream the dream you have to dream you have to see what the president saw he says the brother came to me a couple of days ago and he told me in a dream and he left something up and i told him i said brother what's about this and this was in that part of your dream thank you lord so down here had to dream the dream praise the lord i've been i've been kind of looking into dreams and vision a little bit you know i i said we're going to preach a message your dream will put you in prison and your dream might get you out amen but daniel dreamed the dream and and and and also got the interpretation by dream amen and and a dream that's that's that's where it comes into a vision you know a dream when a person dreams the dream and uh and it comes to pass just the way it is then it it's an it's a vision it's a secondary vision brother branham said now so uh uh let me not go into all of that you know that but what i wanted to for us to look at is that in the in the in the image in in nebuchadnezzar dream that was where god established the gentile powers amen the gentile super powers china trying to claim superpower russia trying to claim superpower america claiming superpower but by the word of god the superpower is in that image amen for any nation under heaven to have some sense of superpower they must be influenced they must come under one of those nations in nebuchadnezzar's dream we know it was the head of gold the breadth of savior the lens of brides and the legs of iron praise the lord think about it this way you think about it this way look at it now and think about it go is higher than silver silver is higher than brass brass is higher than iron but look at this other weight again saver is stronger than go brass is stronger than silver and iron is stronger than all are we together if i'm not i'm not going to the whole thing but i want to grab your attention here is that the lesser the precious tone the harder it is the lesser the precious tone the more harder it is are we together we know that uh babylon was the the kingdom of gold the head of gold saver was the the median person they were the kingdom of sivir uh elizana the great came in as the braz and the roman kingdom is the iron are we together now so but what what was god showing uh a down here concerning the gentile kingdom concerning our kingdom remember now uh down in chapter 12 he told him that seal of the book for these things will be revealed in the end now i'm going to read something to you from brother branham but i'm trying to build this uh platform here because i i don't have all the time to uh for us to to uh you know travel in this now so we realized that uh a stone was cut off the mountain amen in in in the booking as a dream and that stone splashed the image and when it smashed the image it smashed the image on the legs amen and then it started breaking from the goal to the silver to the brass and everything just crumbled down everything just condensed amen it just condensed and became solid in the iron which is the roman kingdom amen so i call into god's word when he talks about the word talks about superpower is the roman's kingdom amen the romans kingdom is the the the final last superpower are we together amen daniel chapter 7 let's just look at something here daniel chapter 7 are we together glory be to god this smoke disaster verse one in the first year of belchers the king of babylon dania had a dream and a vision of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the psalm of the matter daniel speaking said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven straw upon the great sea and four great beasts came up from the sea divers one from another the first was like a lion and high eagle wings he had now let me see this before we continue to read what nebuchadnezzar saw was the it was the political powers of the gentile kingdom amen it was the political power now what god is revealing to daniel is the religious power praise the lord and then when you bring this religious power and political power together they become threefold religious political and demonic are we together all right amen so we see here this this first bc a lion uh uh uh and and with eagle wings and i beheld till the wings thereof was plucked off is that is that kingdom losing losing his power and and and it was it was lifted up from the earth and and miss stan may stand upon the feet as a man and a man heart was giving to abe and behold another beast the second was a day amen the bed which we shall which represent the the persian kingdom and uh the bed and it was and uh and it rise up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and and the said dust onto it arise the evolved much flesh after this i beheld in law another like a leper that was alexander the great history tells how he conquered his conquering was as the spee of a leper but that's that's not oh i'm i'm not i'm not into the history of i'm just trying to to uh behead a leper like a leper which had upon the back of it four wings of a foul and the beast had also forehead and dominion was given to it after this i saw in the night vision and beheld a fourth beast dreadful terrible strong exceeding and a high grade iron teeth it devolved and break and as you go through this you realize these four beasts really never had a proper description like the rest of the other beasts the first one had a description the second one like a bed first one a lion with wings second one like a bed a tear one like a leper but when you come to this fourth beast it really never had a description it was like a mis it was like a mysterious a mysterious creature revelation chapter 13 let's set up here we can go through this and i can we can travel down the history of eight but let's let's let's travel here in a little bit look at revelation chapter 13 praise the lord am i making you sleepy you cannot sleep in a smoke disaster for you to sleep in a smoke disaster means you are dead you cannot sleep even someone in deep sleep when when there is smoke in the house the first thing you start coughing that's the thing that will wake you up from that stream then you realize you realize that the smoke is all over the place you can't sleep in this smoke disaster people it's serious revelation chapter 13. let's let's look at this let's read from verse one and i beheld upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads in ten homes and upon his home's ten crowns and upon his head the name of blasphemy amen i was i was listening to that message blasphemous name this weekend and and it kind of led to all this but let's just trust the lord listen here now verse two and the beast which i saw was like a leper and his feet were as the feet of a bed your vision now down your vision now when daniel saw it they were separate when john is seeing it they are combined are we together praise the lord oh my goodness man look people this this message is the voice of god god sent us a prophet to be able to to show us these things amen to be able to show us these things that we will not be affected in the days that we are living these things are revered to us talk to us by the prophet i realized to you from verb branham they are revealed to us for us to prepare for this hour that's what brother brown said a church is rising up a people that would get desperate with god in prayer amen there it says i i mean they're they're talking about a boxing without we don't know when it will be out but you know god has already come and by the baptising of the holy god he has already fascinated his people that is the inoculation that the church needs that's the baptism of the holy ghost the thing that will make people to sob and cry and say oh god save this word save my brother save my sister lord god help me that's what we are talking about amen so john go here he says the beast which i saw was like a leper and the feet were like a bear whereas the feet of a bed and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority so when daniel saw this vision it looks like they were they were they were they were individual beasts one like a lion with eagle wings and another one like a bed standing by itself and another one like uh like like a leper standing by himself but then when it came to the fourth beast it was mysterious you mean he just told us that it's a terrible beast it's strong it's dangerous glory to god we have to realize people very brave taught us in the seals that beast means the power amen that beast means a power these are the powers that we are dealing with praise the lord amen let me tell you the government does not have control over what is happening they don't have control over they try to play politics with aid but they don't have control over everybody trying to defend their camp because it's a smoke that's coming upon the world we are in a smoke disaster the entire world you know what revelation says that a smoke come out of the grave furnace it affected the air it affected the air the whole world it sees the word economy sees the word travel humble are the great nations german with all their medical experts and everything i mean a humble the whole world sees everybody [Music] everybody has to be quarantined everybody wearing the max you know sometimes god will just allow some things just to be able to magnify what he's doing it might pass the eyes of the world but it does not pass the eyes of the elect because we are looking to prophecy that's the thing that excites us it's not a news on the media it's not seeing it because cnn does not even know what we are talking about and as as human as him in this human nature we cannot help but to be passionate you can't help but to be passionate you listen to something you choose yourself quickly that's human nature depending on what is your thoughts about what you are listening to you choose your side they don't have news to give us because these things have already been broadcasted by malachi 4. [Music] it's already been broadcasted amen if you are listening to the message you are feeling on the message you have the news for the hour you have the news for the dead that's why he said recognizing your day and his message we don't get our news from cnn or fox news what are we talking about here we're talking about this smoke disaster that is blasting the world oh mine praise the lord are we together amen brother branham said fourth seal in the fourth seal he says now he said notice the antichrist was on the pill house makes color now you have to watch that now you have to watch that when brother branham say miss color which mean is the color of the first house rather the white the color of the second house rather the red the color of the tear house rather black they mixed together and it produced a pill house now revelation chapter 13 verse 2 is a mixing of powers the the lion with eagle wings the bed and the leper has been mixed we don't know the power that we are dealing with but better than talking on greater battle ever thought you don't know the power that you are dealing with people let's hide ourselves hey hannah don't write on that bible don't do that let's hide ourself behind the world because i'm saying you are no match to the combination of this power that you are reading about here the only saving secret place and hiding place is in the world you have no match you have no idea you have no idea because when brother branham talks about the the boycott that would come this is the way we we as believers in god's word we are the the people that will be that will be affected you know brethren talk about them turning our churches into storehouses praise the lord even now with that with the time that we are living in with the time that we are living in and all the tests that is growing up and and we're getting into a cold season and all of this flu vaccine is going to be mandatory it's going to be mandatory as a health worker you'll be forced to take your flu vaccine these powers are cooking they are they are they are emerging they've been emerging for a long time amen they've been emerging at the back of the scene they are now stepping into plainview he says the antichrist was on the pill house mixed color the house a house is a is is a beast that represents its power his power is all mixed up with what religion this is national power religious power is demonic power is all kinds of power all kinds of power all kinds of power no human smartness can beat this thing that we're talking about because if human smartness can beat it we will not be to where we are today amen we will not be to where we are with all the hundreds of life that we have lost just like in egypt all of those magicians sat there and they could do nothing when moses was bringing the plague they could do nothing when he stood right there in in in pharaoh palace he threw his stick down they threw theirs down of pharaoh said well you know just just come and trick my boys know what to do then amen but when moses starts saying darkness upon the land fleas frogs they went and said pharaoh better let that man go because we don't know how to deal with these things we don't have creative power creative power is in one group it's as children of god the church of the living god and that is the power that god has besought upon his church creative power is able to raise you out of your sickbed able to kick out every devil out of our lives that's what we're talking about creative power the power of almighty god himself we got to get serious with this thing people it's serious business [Music] praise the lord young people don't take your future from god's hand you better leave it there it's more savor in god's hand than for you to take it from god's hand and try to run it yourself your future is more safer in god's hands you just follow him and get this baptising of the holy ghost that we're talking about amen he says he says all kinds of power mixed together it's a mixed pill house he says he got all kinds of power but when jesus come it's on a one solid red colored hearse he says the word the bleeding word so we depending only on one power one power we are riding only on one color beast that is the bleeding world the bleeding world for our day the world affecting and changing our lives addressing our issues praise the lord amen oh my god we're carrying that word as an oxygen cane on our child our on our chest and we are breathing on the lord believe in me lord breathe on me father we are carrying that word as an oxygen can that's what we need that's the only thing that can save us because i'm telling you it's going to get more smoky it's going to get more dark it's going to get more terrible that's the only way we can get out of here brother amen we got to carry this word as an oxygen can [Music] praise the lord when the devil is blasting your mind open the pages of the word and say lord breathe on me breathe on me let your word become real to me we're not talking about church we're talking about the word be made flesh oh glory to god my that greater battle is going on amen but then you were right in the pages of the world that's why we're facing people that greater battle is going on praise the lord don't follow the media and says oh republican get out of that get out of that praise the lord i'm not i'm not ripping your national ride for you go and vote praise the lord amen glory be to god before they put me on the media and see this man is telling his church not to vote something would just have to start something to happen amen and he always start from a misunderstanding praise the lord because god has been misunderstood in every age amen but when jesus comes it's a one solid rare color house and that's the word this one makes his color you know he's talking about the antichrist now this one makes his color red white black three colors amen representing in one three powers three powers in one a white house a black house a red house and three crown in one which means the power are crowding that word crown we we we if the lord help us will locate the power are crowning in a sense is that the power is is taking on authority it is becoming flesh let me say it that way amen it's becoming flesh because he's telling the scripture there are a lot of crowns you know we we talk about the crown of life you know paul says the crown of life awaits you you know i mean god is not he's not going to put you know uh some kind of a sticking thing over our head no he crying us with life it's when he gave us his own life he crimes us with life we'll talk about crown but not not today so let's look but this the three power is crowning in one crowning in one wish me it has hit its peak it's becoming flesh and stepping out amen when brother branham preached when brother brandon preached the feasts of the trumpets where he talks about those two million demons you know what he said he says the pentecostal power the pentecostal blessing this holy ghost that the church had just reduced to speaking in tongues they had just reduced it to a church membership i mean the messenger we have the holy ghost he says he said that was the power it was the holy ghost that held those demons bound when the holy spirit was released it held those demon powers bound but as the church started playing on the experience of the holy ghost the lead was slowly taken out of here as the church start playing on the experience of the holy ghost you think about it when you give your life to the lord and you believe the word you believe the message how on fire you were for the lord and i mean there was just no time to compromise and i mean you were just on the firing line but as soon as you think that you started understanding better and you started taking different approaches you realize your life started being exposed to things that you never knew because the holy ghost will always keep the enemy bound praise the lord but when the people start playing on the experience of the holy ghost they tried to take it as a church membership and they tried to take it as this or that the prophet of god came and said now the lead is taken out of hell he said demon's powers are streaming out everywhere everywhere be to god amen amen he said three colors represented in one three powers represented in one the white house the black house the red house and the three crown in one three powers united together c all mixed up in color pill death death spoke in the whole thing is political and religious and demon power makes together praise the lord is political religion and demon power mixed together you think about this we love our doctors we pray for them they are the one on the on the firing line amen i mean good hot doctors sometimes you go to a doctor you talk to them and they look at your pills they know they see they see what you are dealing with and look at your prescriptions no this will not help you no no the side effect of this is going to make your situation worse why because the pharmaceutical company the pharmaceutical company praise the lord you look at that word pharmaceutical in the greek it comes out of the word means sorceress it comes out of the word mean sorcerers all they are offered is just money praise the lord that's the reason why our medication has more side effects it help us less and affect us more please i'm not saying don't take your meds i think you know what i'm saying okay i think you know what i'm saying i'm i'm just i'm trying to i'm trying to bring us to this place so we can see this thing that is happening there are forces behind this there are forces that is behind this that the forces that we are dealing with they are not small listen to brother branham said this let me read this to you god provide a place of worship he said he says look at the teenagers and sin i told you the other day there was taking an analysis there in the school in arizona where i live 80 percent of the children in the school is mentally praise the lord this thing that looks like a movement where all the young people want to hang their pains down grow their head on their hair like while fire is insanity it's a spirit that have taken over our young people they feel that they never fit in until they pierce their ears grow their hair crazy take on an arrogant spirit praise the lord because what they realize that they are supported by the state you can whip me you with me i call you now i want on you praise the lord but there is something behind it there is a power you remember brother baron says is preparing the young mind for the battle of america is preparing your mind for a blast i was just thinking about that the other day you know when i when i was studying here and and and reading these things you know mentally what will their children be we can have another generation we are the end jesus said these things will be look at all the television and things amen all of these things that the age is feeding your mind with is just violence violence drugs sex that's all the age is feeding their mind with but you see those are innocent young people that are exposed to demon powers they have no idea what is affecting their life they have no idea what is plaguing their mind they are caught up in this thing looking for an identity amen they are looking for an identity they are trying to be different as soon as they see a violence riot they jump in it you just think about it think about it how many young people i just ran into the street ran from their parents arms into the street out of the end this is a that's a there's a a force that is responsible for that and all they're doing is just following what whatever the year people saying they don't even know what they're running for they're just running they're just running they just want to venge throw stones you know they want to have a record you see that place down there i burn it down when you don't have a job you're not out of high school come back to school come back to work it's too boring school is too boring their house is boring their life is boring anointed one at the end time instead of that message brother branham's face is the spirit of the last day the spirit that makes people bold it's a last-day spirit how can you be in your own house and you are bored how can you be bored with your own life praise the lord and it's all of these things that have increased the suicide arrays because people just feel life is boring there's nothing to life but it's a spirit that is plaguing the minds of the people he says look at this television and all of these things he says it will come a time i predict that people will be completely totally insane and the world will be the bible speaks of such hydrocite as they show in movie today of some prehistoric creature age that live on the earth for so many times you know talking about all of these all of these things you know all of these things and and and and young people just feeding their mind with horror movie feeding their mind with horror movie you know what they are trying to do they are trying to beat out fear they are trying to take you know not to be scary a man without the holy ghost is the most scary man you can ever think about praise the lord because he's just making big mouth he don't have nothing back there to hold him up is this smoke disasters that we have that we aim people it's a smoke disaster there's just one way out amen there's just one way out it's no time to go slow when the smoke is increasing it's no time to go slow it's no time to be slow fall it's no time to play there's no time to be picking up with petty things oh this other person said this other person all of those things are petty things if you think they don't understand you pray for them amen because people always find excuse to do whatever they want to do i did this because of this i did this because this person said this to me i mean the church nobody cared for me so i just choose to do this it's no time for all of those petty things this thing is upon us i mean we have to we have to make sure the blood is applied we have to make sure we have that inner assurance amen that inner assurance we have to make sure we have abiding presence every day a man abiding presence praise the lord when you get in your car and you are just alone in your house or in your room abiding present you're so conscious of god's presence i'm telling you you can break into that presence amen and this word and and all of these things will mean nothing to you praise the lord you can break into that presence it's real it's real you can break into that presence that satisfy your every need you have needs on every hand but there is just a satisfy satisfaction that is there is just a satisfaction that is able to pull smile on your face that's part of the things you are going through those were the only people that escaped these smoke disasters the one with the seal of god amen those awful creatures were told don't touch them they have the seed of god on your forehead praise the lord it's amazing it's amazing when you read the scripture there the bible says that uh those creatures were told not to touch the tree not to touch the grass amen now to touch the tree and the grass you see all of these trees and ground they're not wearing marks like us they are not wearing marks like us they are going through their regular season they are not affected its man on the earth [Music] oh people praise the lord my my my my mind god provide a way of approach to fellowship let's read this one and i think we can close here unless uh we want to want to talk about this but i i i would hope to go more into this into this uh adani revelation prophecy and kind of bring it out more because there is only two powers brandon make us to know that in greater battle ever fought only two powers and he says our life is influenced by one of them praise the lord our life is influenced by one of them and let me tell you this morning since you have the holy ghost but you are still living in the body of flesh amen sometimes because of people actions and different things you can come under the wrong anointing you can come you can be affected with anger you can be affected with fear you can be affected but don't live in it don't live in it you have to recognize it and break yourself out and say god this is not my place glory be to god well fellowship this uh god's provided a way of fellowship that's what brother branham talks about this gem warfare and a lot of that i mean we read all of these uh uh quotes from the beginning of all of this virus i would just take junction of time let me take that year he says here on important is speaking amen and that's what i want to tell you this morning that omnipotent is speaking and he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church because on important is speaking and brother barum says every time that unimportant speaks the miraculous is right around the corner and the people that cease unto it they enjoy the benefit of the miraculous every time their unimportant speaks the miraculous is right around the corner he says unimportantly speaking the miraculous is happening my goodness amen on important is speaking the miraculous is happening praise the lord just like i said we're not afraid you know i mean we're not we're not pumping in our mind and saying well i will never come down with this virus no i believe the lord is uh uh uh uh is the healer of all our diseases praise the lord amen is the healer of all of our diseases if someone fell sick and watered there we will get down on our knees and we will pray praise the lord that's the kind of a church that's that's what i'm that's what i'm i'm praying that god breathe into our heart if god ever allowed a situation in our minds let the church come together and say let's pray we believe in the god of miracle and god that can raise the dead a god i can change the situation we now all go going to get afraid as if to say that person has lepers oh they said that brother he gets covered oh my goodness we got to be careful nobody should go around there and this this is this what is that he's plaguing the church with fear he's plaguing the edge with fear we have a promise in our mess the shout of the king is in the camp the miraculous is speaking i mean the unimportant is speaking he says the miraculous is happening why don't you get in and go with us amen why don't you get in and go with us let's mean business people let's mean business praise the lord let's encourage ourselves to good works amen let's encourage ourselves let's provoke ourselves to good works let's let's let prayer meetings aflame in our hearts but ram says watch how the church is praying you will see how the mises are flying amen why don't you get in and go with us we will be glad to have you alone call you our brother sister i'm not meaning that you are not in a sense but i want you to get into the blessing want you to get into this pentecostal blessing want you to get into this rapturing blessing praise the lord elijah was very setting when he was going to be raptured he was setting amen he told elisha you go stay there to gaga he was setting is the setting thing that god wants to bring into our heart brother branham says the reason why god led him to preach that message on joshua parallel ephesian perilous joshua which is the adoption series he said is to take the fear of being lost the fear of being lost that's the thing that pledged the church as now we get into a little little condition we are so afraid in our mind we oh i'll be lost what's about the god that have kept you out of these years amen is this experience not real to you you have to know that the god of the mountain is the same one in the valley when you get down in the violet and things are not happening don't trash your experience don't trash your experience and make yourself the worst sinner in the world what are you doing to the blood of jesus that have kept you out of his ears god is raising up a people that when the devil gives you a slap you turn around and give him a kick in his face when he thinks you are turning around to go back to the world you are just turning around to know how to send your leg straight to his mouth that's the kind of a church that god that's that's the people that are going in the rapture now the people that are they are so afraid and thinking i don't know if i would make it god already said you will make it he was not depending on your strength he was not depending on your intelligence he was depending on the power of his word he already said he you will make it right amen he already said it glory be to god why can't you believe god then believe your weaknesses what can
