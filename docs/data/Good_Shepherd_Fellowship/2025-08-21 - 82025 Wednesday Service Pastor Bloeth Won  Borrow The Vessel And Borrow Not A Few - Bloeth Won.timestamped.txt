[22:02] this opportunity to be with you.

[22:12] Amen. Amen. Thank you for your prayers.

[22:18] Thank you for your prayers. and uh uh
[22:23] and it's good to be back home. Praise
[22:26] the Lord.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be back home. We
[22:30] thank the Lord for keeping us while we
[22:33] were away from one another and uh and
[22:39] thank the Lord also for all the services
[22:43] you had brother speaking on
[22:48] the ministry of intercession and brother
[22:51] Dan also we just thank the Lord for
[22:53] that. Praise the Lord.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord kind of forgive us a wonderful
[22:58] trip tonight. We will bring a little
[23:00] report to you u uh Sunday. Brother Tim
[23:05] Sean from Ghana will will be flying in
[23:08] from Canada on Friday. So we will have
[23:11] him speak to us. So we will we will just
[23:14] use tonight to report a little bit on
[23:17] our trip and then uh uh
[23:23] and then we we share something with you.
[23:26] Praise the Lord.
[23:28] So uh if uh the the the
[23:35] technicians can help us
[23:38] uh I really don't have things in proper
[23:41] order. So whatever the show I will be
[23:44] able to just comment on it a little bit
[23:46] but we we uh went over to Zimbabwe like
[23:52] we said we are going to uh uh be with
[23:55] brother Joseph and his church there on
[23:58] the uh church dedication.
[24:01] So, brother Joseph Chosi, he preached
[24:03] for us. I think uh was that in April or
[24:09] March this year uh when those brothers
[24:14] came down from uh Iowa. So, the brother
[24:17] that preached for us that Saturday night
[24:19] and Sunday morning, he he's the one
[24:21] there that is the the senior pastor. If
[24:25] if there is anything like that in the
[24:27] message,
[24:29] what actually it is is that brother
[24:32] brother Chikosi works like an apostle.
[24:36] that would be the right kind of a term
[24:39] to use because uh uh he was able to
[24:43] establish churches
[24:45] and uh so uh he started a church in his
[24:49] hometown Mutari that where he started
[24:52] from and then uh he moved over to Harari
[24:56] which is the capital and started this
[24:58] church that we that he just built and
[25:01] dedicated and then uh uh after then uh
[25:06] now he's over in the UK where he's
[25:09] pastoring
[25:11] a local assembly there. So UK will be
[25:13] where he's pastoring and the other
[25:16] churches he's overseeing it because they
[25:18] have their local pastor but uh since he
[25:22] was the one that started the work there
[25:24] so they kind of uh work alongside with
[25:28] him and uh so uh so that's if we can use
[25:32] the word senior pastor but a man only be
[25:36] a pastor of one church and and he can
[25:39] oversee other churches. That is the
[25:41] right way it should be.
[25:44] So uh uh we were we were there with them
[25:48] on their church dedication. I was trying
[25:50] to put uh uh just some few photos
[25:55] together and uh I did some copy and
[26:00] paste video because the the services
[26:03] were so long. It was such a marathon.
[26:06] Amen. Such a marathon. Uh
[26:11] from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
[26:15] Tuesday.
[26:17] So uh uh and then uh Friday was a kind
[26:22] of a welcome uh service. So we have one
[26:24] service in the evening and then uh the
[26:27] marathon started from Saturday morning.
[26:30] we had
[26:32] two services
[26:34] and uh and then Saturday also was the
[26:37] the dedication of the church. Uh so
[26:41] uh we had a
[26:44] um
[26:46] services started around 8:00 in the
[26:48] morning. So
[26:51] uh
[26:53] there there's a preacher that will come
[26:54] in the morning preach but before then
[26:57] another preacher would come for maybe
[26:59] about some 50 minutes greet the people
[27:01] because there were just a lot of
[27:02] ministers. So he was trying to give
[27:05] every minister an opportunity. So he' be
[27:08] a forer come take 20 minutes or so. Uh
[27:13] uh then the main preacher comes and then
[27:15] after that we get back to singing then
[27:18] another forrunner comes then another
[27:20] preacher comes. So after that before we
[27:22] go on break then we come back again for
[27:24] two for another two service in the
[27:26] evening. So praise the lord and uh so
[27:31] that just that just how it was Sunday
[27:33] the same thing repeated uh the same
[27:36] order Sunday the same order on Monday.
[27:40] Saturday was a little bit different
[27:42] because we had a very long session
[27:44] because we had to do the preaching and
[27:46] then we go and do the dedication of the
[27:49] church and uh and then before
[27:53] we get to the evening service. So the
[27:56] evening service we play uh a message of
[27:59] brother Brandon which of course I might
[28:01] just show you a little video on Sunday.
[28:03] I was not able to pull that one out, but
[28:05] u uh so Emmanuel, if you have uh any
[28:08] picture that you want to show us, if you
[28:10] can cut that light off uh or deem it uh
[28:14] back there and let's see if pictures
[28:17] will work. If it don't work tonight,
[28:19] then we'll do it on Saturday. Okay, this
[28:21] one is a first follow. This will be uh
[28:25] uh uh South Africa. That's brother Ruben
[28:29] Daniels and his wife Sister Wendy
[28:32] Daniels. Uh I got to know them. U this
[28:36] is will be 21 years. Brother Rubin was a
[28:39] deacon at the time. Uh honor his
[28:42] brother, brother Joe Daniels was the
[28:44] pastor of the church. So uh that was my
[28:47] first visit to South Africa. Uh uh when
[28:51] we came back to Johannesburg
[28:54] uh they they hosted us. I was actually
[28:56] in their house. I in their house uh 21
[29:00] years ago. And just then their son uh uh
[29:05] the next photo of the same
[29:09] uh no
[29:11] the next photo with the same people.
[29:13] Okay, that's the young man there. That's
[29:16] uh Delton. He was getting married that
[29:18] year. And this this was uh this is my
[29:21] host, Brother Vusi. Uh the pastor there
[29:24] in Suetto. He was here with us many
[29:26] years ago and uh uh so he was the one
[29:31] that I actually stopped over to see but
[29:34] wife was not well she's not been well so
[29:39] uh uh and we've been praying for her. So
[29:42] that was one of my major reason of going
[29:44] to South Africa. I wanted to see his
[29:46] wife his wife and uh children just like
[29:50] family to us. So that was the reason why
[29:53] I make a stop in in uh South Africa. But
[29:57] I didn't know that he too had a
[29:58] different plan for me. I'll tell you
[30:00] about it later. But brother brother Ruby
[30:03] Daniels also was not well. Now uh uh the
[30:08] past few years there were lot of uh uh
[30:11] prominent preachers in South Africa that
[30:13] went to be with the Lord. Brother George
[30:16] Martins, brother Gideon Retie and the
[30:20] lot lot of the prominent ministers. So
[30:22] when we heard that brother Ruby was not
[30:24] well, it was really really concerning.
[30:27] been praying for him and uh so I thought
[30:30] also that we would stop and visit with
[30:33] him and uh uh uh and brother Ruben he
[30:39] came down with uh pancreatic cancer
[30:43] and uh and and that was uh that was
[30:47] actually the cancer that brother Steve
[30:49] Chambi passed away from. It was
[30:52] pancreatic cancer. According to medical
[30:54] science, that is one of the the toughest
[30:59] cancer to detect and the moment you find
[31:02] it is gone. You are gone.
[31:05] In most cases, in most cases, the moment
[31:10] pancreatic cancer is discovered, it is
[31:14] already in its full stage and you are
[31:16] gone. The moment we got to know that
[31:18] brother Steve Jambbei had pancreatic
[31:20] cancer, it was already stage four.
[31:24] So with brother Ruben uh by the grace of
[31:27] God
[31:29] the
[31:31] I mean they never had any hope for him
[31:33] and uh uh but by the grace of God he
[31:37] stay with us. So we want to thank the
[31:39] Lord for that. Amen.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; So they had to go in and and do some
[31:44] some work and uh uh uh uh cut some of
[31:48] his tissues uh within. And we believe
[31:51] that the Lord can be able to uh regrow
[31:54] that. Amen. Or give him a brand new
[31:56] organ.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for that. So that's
[32:00] that part of our South African trip.
[32:02] Let's go to the next one. Bring the
[32:04] church building. Okay. This was the
[32:06] church that we that we went to to
[32:08] dedicate there with brother
[32:11] uh Joe Danas and uh
[32:15] uh Bible believers Harari. That's that's
[32:18] the tabernacle name. So, uh uh yeah,
[32:23] that's that's the church building. The
[32:25] next one, if we go fast with that
[32:32] and uh and and
[32:35] Okay, this one looks like a video. Which
[32:37] one is that?
[32:42] Which one is that? Let's see.
[32:50] [Music]
[32:57] It looks like it does not have anything.
[33:00] Take that one away. Bring another one.
[33:06] That's my production.
[33:11] That's my production.
[33:13] I don't know. This this one should be
[33:15] the last one. That's that that's that's
[33:17] my service. I took the last service. So,
[33:20] uh
[33:22] uh
[33:25] yeah, I was trying to just
[33:28] skip through. I hope I I put
[33:32] try another one again.
[33:40] Or the pictures of uh
[33:51] Oh yeah. So these are just videos that I
[33:53] added. Uh Emmanuel,
[33:56] I see.
[34:00] Okay. So everything that come true.
[34:04] Okay.
[34:06] Okay. Okay.
[34:12] Okay, maybe there were just a lot of
[34:15] images to send at once
[34:19] and uh okay, we will we will work on the
[34:22] rest of uh the the pictures because uh
[34:26] uh even though the church building was
[34:28] where we went to do the dedication, but
[34:30] we did not have the service in the in
[34:32] the church building. We had a service on
[34:34] a tent because uh uh the the crowd was
[34:38] more than the building could hold. Uh
[34:41] the building I think is made to be able
[34:43] to hold close to a thousand people and
[34:46] we had about four to 5,000 people.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; So they had to put a huge tent outside.
[34:53] I thought I thought I put a photo of
[34:55] that one there but maybe it never came
[34:57] through. So we will try to correct it on
[35:00] Sunday. And then also there is a little
[35:05] portion of video also of uh you know the
[35:08] the the dedication you know when they
[35:10] when they were doing the the dedication
[35:12] of uh the building itself. So u uh yeah
[35:19] when they were doing the dedication of
[35:21] the building itself. So u I a picture of
[35:25] that there. So yeah, we we went through
[35:29] that and uh like you saw the last
[35:31] service that was the last day on
[35:33] Tuesday. So we preach in the morning and
[35:36] then a brother from u
[35:40] Uganda, brother Gideon, he he took uh
[35:43] the last uh exitation in the evening
[35:47] and then uh uh we went over to South
[35:51] Africa like I said to see brother wife
[35:54] and and u and just to see how they were
[35:57] doing and he's been a good friend to us
[35:59] too uh uh for for many
[36:03] about almost the same. I met them the
[36:06] same about 21 years. So, we got there
[36:10] and then we preached for brother
[36:12] uh
[36:14] brother David Gonzalez on Thursday. We
[36:17] got there on Thursday, got home and and
[36:20] just got ready for service that evening,
[36:22] visited brother David Gonzalez and we
[36:25] preached for him Friday.
[36:29] Uh I think uh
[36:32] Okay, I think that was the short video
[36:34] that went through. Maybe the image never
[36:37] came. Uh they lost a family in their in
[36:40] their church uh there. So they were
[36:44] having uh how we would call it like a
[36:48] gathering in the evening. So what
[36:50] normally they do is they uh they will
[36:53] meet every evening at the family house
[36:55] and they will have service the entire
[36:58] week and then on the weekend they would
[37:00] do a funeral. So something that is very
[37:03] very common among them. They will have
[37:05] service all through the week and then on
[37:08] the weekend they have uh the burial.
[37:12] So uh uh the Thursday night brother Vy
[37:16] went there and then I was uh preaching
[37:18] for brother David. So Friday he said
[37:20] let's go let's go and sympathize with
[37:22] the people. So well but because I know
[37:25] my friend
[37:28] because I know my friend you know he's a
[37:31] man of very few words. He don't talk a
[37:33] whole lot you know so I said well okay
[37:38] since I know this guy
[37:40] let me just prepare myself for the
[37:42] better and for the worse.
[37:45] And as soon as we were getting there, he
[37:46] says, "Well, you speak to the people
[37:48] this evening
[37:51] because I know my friend." So I prepare
[37:54] myself for the dead in the wor. So So
[37:57] yeah, so we had to preach that night to
[37:59] the people. Praise the Lord.
[38:02] And speaking that night, uh uh there was
[38:05] something I I I said during the service
[38:08] and then after it kind of it stuck on my
[38:11] mind. So a little bit of that is what I
[38:14] was I will speak on tonight by God's
[38:16] grace. So then Saturday uh uh um he
[38:22] drove me into uh Sukunda. It's about uh
[38:26] an hour a little over an hour drive out
[38:28] of Johannesburg.
[38:30] Uh that's another church that he oversee
[38:32] for for a couple of years because the
[38:35] pastor passed away in a car accident uh
[38:39] I think couple of years ago. So he
[38:41] overseed that church until devoted a
[38:44] brother as a pastor. So uh uh so he took
[38:50] me there um and uh we had service there
[38:54] Saturday uh two services Saturday
[38:58] morning and Saturday evening and then we
[39:01] came back to Johannesburg to his church
[39:04] in Suetto. Uh and we have service for
[39:07] them Sunday evening and Sunday morning
[39:11] and Sunday evening. So u uh yeah so it
[39:16] was it was it was a unplanned busy trip
[39:19] but uh by the grace of God we survived
[39:22] and we are back home. Praise the Lord.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord that uh he was
[39:28] able to to bless our trip. Thank you for
[39:31] your prayers. Uh it really was a
[39:34] blessing to know that uh there were
[39:36] people that were watching our back.
[39:39] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; So, let's just sing this little chorus
[39:44] and then uh we will we will go to the
[39:48] Lord in prayer and then read something
[39:50] out of God's word. I I just
[39:54] uh you know this the habit of taking
[39:56] pictures during service is I I feel so
[40:00] odd, you know. So, it's hard for me to
[40:03] to just be taking pictures, you know,
[40:06] during service. So most of my pictures I
[40:09] I had to come out of the service, go
[40:11] outside. So I don't have good pictures.
[40:14] I really don't have good pictures. But
[40:16] so I was trying to sleep between the
[40:18] videos and do short pictures doing the
[40:21] video. That's what I was working on this
[40:23] afternoon. By God's grace, we came in
[40:26] early this morning. So I was able to get
[40:28] some sleep. And uh uh
[40:32] there's a little song uh uh and uh uh
[40:36] the song says uh
[40:39] uh I don't regret
[40:42] every mile that I travel for the Lord.
[40:46] [Music]
[40:54] If we have the verse of the
[40:58] [Music]
[41:04] I don't
[41:07] regret.
[41:10] [Music]
[41:19] Let's start it again.
[41:24] I don't
[41:27] regret
[41:30] am I travel
[41:33] for the Lord
[41:37] and I don't regret a time
[41:43] I trusted
[41:46] in his word.
[41:50] have seen the years go by.
[41:55] May the days without
[41:59] a song,
[42:02] but I don't regret
[42:05] a mile.
[42:08] I've traveled
[42:11] for the Lord.
[42:14] Oh, I don't regret a mile
[42:21] that I travel
[42:23] for. Let's stand on our feet now.
[42:27] And I don't regret the time
[42:34] I trusted
[42:36] in his word.
[42:40] I've seen a year go by
[42:46] many days without a song.
[42:53] I don't regret a mile
[42:58] that I travel
[43:01] for the Lord.
[43:04] Oh, I don't regret
[43:11] that I travel
[43:13] for the Lord.
[43:17] I thought regret
[43:20] time
[43:23] I had trusted
[43:25] in his word.
[43:30] Stay in the year go by.
[43:35] Many days we found a song.
[43:41] But I don't regret a mark
[43:47] that I drove
[43:50] for the Lord.
[43:53] You know, I I was thinking about this
[43:55] song not only because of
[43:59] uh because of a trick or because of the
[44:03] trick that I made, but you think about
[44:06] it also. Every one of us here, we have
[44:08] to drive
[44:10] set in mind to come to church. I was
[44:13] listening to the service last Wednesday
[44:15] there where Dan was testifying,
[44:18] you know, uh uh coming driving over here
[44:21] to Brooklyn Center and I was just
[44:23] thinking I came from service that night.
[44:26] I was just lying down and u uh thinking
[44:30] about death and uh that's when I started
[44:34] thinking about this song you know uh uh
[44:41] to know that uh every one of us we have
[44:45] to drive
[44:49] some to come here
[44:53] and it's because of is because of the
[44:56] Lord.
[44:59] It might not look like uh traveling
[45:04] to Ohio or traveling to Florida for
[45:09] service. It might not look like going
[45:12] overseas,
[45:15] but I want for us to realize tonight,
[45:22] you know, just like how companies will
[45:24] pay their workers that travel that put
[45:27] mileage on their vehicle.
[45:32] And I believe that's the same way like
[45:34] David said, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[45:38] and forget not his benefits.
[45:42] We put mileage on our vehicles. We put
[45:45] mileage on our body to come and serve
[45:48] the Lord.
[45:51] Some of you come from working.
[45:55] Try to grab some rest and get yourself
[45:57] ready for church.
[46:04] It is more than a duty. It's a love
[46:06] affair.
[46:08] [Music]
[46:10] We have no regret to be in the house of
[46:12] the Lord tonight.
[46:15] [Music]
[46:18] Because if a man can pay their workers
[46:22] for putting mileage on their car,
[46:28] the Lord can bless
[46:32] the parts of your vehicles.
[46:35] [Music]
[46:37] The Lord can bless,
[46:40] [Music]
[46:43] keep you safe on the road,
[46:46] keep you and your family safe.
[46:49] So, let's sing that song a little one
[46:51] more time again
[46:55] to know that it's not just
[46:58] only because I travel, but it's
[47:01] concerning every one of us. We should
[47:03] have no regret.
[47:06] We should have no regret
[47:11] for every time that we have to go to
[47:13] serve the Lord.
[47:15] David said, "I was glad when he said
[47:17] unto me, let's go into the house of the
[47:19] Lord."
[47:21] I think about uh Brother Wesley and
[47:24] Sister Karen. I heard they were way in
[47:26] service. think about them all the time
[47:28] driving
[47:30] and uh Jordan and his wife come down
[47:34] from St. CL is now birth and his family
[47:39] and uh brother Hillary his family come
[47:42] from Shak
[47:44] [Music]
[47:46] I mean every one of us we have to drive
[47:51] some about 15 20 minutes to get to
[47:53] church
[47:55] I don't regret
[47:58] my
[48:00] that I travel
[48:03] for the Lord Oh.
[48:06] Oh. I don't regret every time
[48:14] I've trusted
[48:16] in his word.
[48:20] I've seen the years go by.
[48:26] Many days we found our song.
[48:32] Oh, I don't regret
[48:36] [Music]
[48:39] that I travel far.
[48:45] Oh, I don't regret
[48:52] that I travel
[48:54] for my Lord.
[48:58] I don't regret every time
[49:04] that I trusted
[49:07] in this world.
[49:12] I see the year go by
[49:17] many days without a song.
[49:23] Oh, I don't regret
[49:27] a
[49:29] yes that I travel
[49:32] for. Let's sing that one more time now.
[49:36] Oh, I don't regret
[49:40] a mile
[49:42] that I travel
[49:45] for the Lord.
[49:48] Oh, let me never let me never regret a
[49:52] time.
[49:55] But I trusting
[49:58] in your word. Oh, I sing the year go by
[50:07] many
[50:09] without a song.
[50:13] Oh, I don't regret am I
[50:21] travel
[50:23] for.
[50:27] Let's pray together tonight. Let's just
[50:29] thank the Lord for giving us this
[50:31] opportunity to be in the house of the
[50:32] Lord.
[50:34] And let's thank him for his goodness,
[50:36] his love, and his mercy. Let's thank him
[50:39] that he will he will make his presence a
[50:42] joy to our hearts. There will be no
[50:44] regret to be in the house of the Lord.

[57:24] chapter 4.
[57:27] Second Kings chapter 4. That's where we
[57:30] want to just
[57:33] encourage you tonight. Praise the Lord.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] I know most of the time I say we we
[57:43] having a prayer meeting you know um
[57:48] uh
[57:51] most of the time the children told tell
[57:53] me at home daddy I thought you say it
[57:55] was a prayer meeting and uh so and then
[57:58] you end up preaching you know uh uh but
[58:01] that's what a prayer meeting is you know
[58:03] a service is not complete without the
[58:06] preaching of the word amen And every
[58:09] every service must be a prayer meeting
[58:11] where we take uh requests to the Lord.
[58:14] And uh I've always believed that the
[58:17] proof that you have a good prayer life
[58:19] is the time you spend in the word. Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; You spend much time in praying, you
[58:24] spend much time in the word. Uh second
[58:26] king chapter 4 tonight, let's read from
[58:29] verse one. Now there cry a certain woman
[58:34] of the wives of the sons of the prophet
[58:37] unto Elisha saying thy servant my
[58:41] husband is dead. This was a widow.
[58:44] Praise the Lord. There a lot of widows
[58:47] that sat under Elijah ministry
[58:51] and this is not one year. Uh uh uh thy
[58:54] servant, my husband is dead, and thou
[58:56] knowest that thy servant did fear the
[59:00] Lord,
[59:02] and the creditors is come to take
[59:06] unto him my two sons to be a bound man.
[59:11] Praise the Lord.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you remember under under
[59:16] the law of uh uh the jubilee under the
[59:20] jubilee in Exodus when the person was
[59:23] indeped you can't pay your debt then
[59:25] sometimes you have to give your son and
[59:28] and then they will have to go and work
[59:30] until the time of the jubilee before
[59:32] they go free. So it's a kind of a
[59:34] situation here we are seeing with this
[59:36] widow. uh the husband borrowed some
[59:38] money he couldn't paid. Now he's gone
[59:41] and uh and the creditors want to come
[59:43] and take her sons to be bound men. And
[59:46] Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do
[59:50] for thee? Tell me." Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Not only telling me the problem, but
[59:55] what do you want me to do?
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What do you want the
[1:00:00] Lord to do? Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Sometime we spend much
[1:00:04] time talking the problem than really
[1:00:06] giving our request. So Elisha said unto
[1:00:10] her, "What shall I do for thee? Tell me,
[1:00:14] what have thou in the house?" And she
[1:00:18] said, "Thy may have not anything in the
[1:00:22] house save a pot of oil." Praise the
[1:00:27] Lord.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] Then he said, "Go borrow thee vessels
[1:00:36] abroad of all thy neighbors,
[1:00:40] even empty vessels.
[1:00:43] Borrow not a few."
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; She said, "I only have a pot of oil." So
[1:00:50] the prophet say, "Okay, then go uh uh
[1:00:53] then you know just go go to all your
[1:00:55] neighbors and borrow vessels, gallon
[1:00:57] drums, anything that can carry." Praise
[1:01:00] the Lord.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Anything that can carry, go and borrow,
[1:01:04] but borrow not a few. That's what I want
[1:01:06] us to to be able to to remember. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Borrow not a few. Borrow as much as you
[1:01:13] can. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Don't put limits on God.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] Don't put limits on God. Don't be
[1:01:21] afraid. God is in control.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; And when thou I come in, thou shall shut
[1:01:27] the door upon thee and upon thy sons,
[1:01:32] and shall pour out into all those
[1:01:36] vessels, and thou shall set aside that
[1:01:40] which is for. Now she says she only she
[1:01:44] only have a pot of oil. And here is the
[1:01:46] prophet is telling her to go and borrow
[1:01:48] vessels. When you come, go in the room,
[1:01:51] you and your sons, take one of the
[1:01:52] vessel, carry it there. Don't bring it
[1:01:54] out until it is full. When you bring it
[1:01:57] out, carry the other one there. It
[1:01:58] should be full before you bring it out.
[1:02:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. She only have a pot of oil. Now,
[1:02:04] where where is the rest of the oil
[1:02:06] coming from?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; God is still Jehovah. Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; He's still the provider.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; He stay He knows our needs and and and
[1:02:16] he's the one the same God that was able
[1:02:18] to provide a lamb on the hill for
[1:02:20] Abraham. He's the same God that is going
[1:02:23] to fill that barrel over and over again.
[1:02:26] You remember the brother testimony I
[1:02:27] told you last year from South Africa uh
[1:02:30] the farmer uh brother Shauna on on the
[1:02:32] milk farm. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And uh uh uh uh and the boy he bought
[1:02:38] one one gallon. You know, the uh uh uh
[1:02:41] the farmer told him that uh you know,
[1:02:44] there was no milk there. Took that
[1:02:45] gallon and then he was able to get
[1:02:47] gallons and gallons and gallons of milk
[1:02:50] to be able to fill. He's the same God.
[1:02:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; These things are not makeup stories.
[1:02:57] They are things that are happening in
[1:02:59] the life of God's children.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, things that are happening in
[1:03:04] the life of God, children. And when thou
[1:03:07] I come in, thou shall shut the door upon
[1:03:09] thee and upon thy sons, and shall pour
[1:03:13] oil into all those vessels, and thou
[1:03:17] shall set aside that which is full. So
[1:03:20] she went from him and shut the door upon
[1:03:23] her and and upon her sons
[1:03:26] who brought the the vessels to her and
[1:03:29] she pou. And it came to pass when the
[1:03:32] vessels were full that she said unto her
[1:03:36] son, "Bring me yet a vessel," which
[1:03:40] means she had more, praise the Lord, she
[1:03:43] had more oil left than the vessels that
[1:03:47] could carry them. Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; She said, "Bring me yet a vessel." And
[1:03:54] he said unto her, "There is not a vessel
[1:03:58] more, and the oil is still." Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Then then she came and told the man of
[1:04:04] God, and he said, "Go sell the oil and
[1:04:08] pay thy debts and leave thou and thy
[1:04:12] children off the rest."
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is there anyone in debt tonight
[1:04:18] just like myself?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Is there any deptor in the house
[1:04:23] tonight?
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; The same God that took care of this debt
[1:04:28] can take care of your debt.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; What? It looks like I strike the cord.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Huh? Those those were the people that
[1:04:43] were that were behind David. Don't
[1:04:45] worry, I'm just starting. Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, y gave me the reason to preach on
[1:04:50] debts.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's pray together tonight.
[1:04:59] Heavenly Father, we just want to thank
[1:05:02] you. We want to appreciate you, Lord,
[1:05:04] and give you praise and glory. It's good
[1:05:06] to be back home, Lord. This is where,
[1:05:08] Father, Lord God, we can call home. This
[1:05:11] is where we find the liberty to preach
[1:05:13] the things on our hearts, people of God.
[1:05:16] Father Lord of Black Pressure faith and
[1:05:18] a body that we are part of Lord God and
[1:05:21] people that we growing together with and
[1:05:24] Lord Jesus they are bearing with us. We
[1:05:26] are bearing with them and we all are
[1:05:28] trusting you that you will bring us
[1:05:30] through. We love you and we appreciate
[1:05:32] you tonight in Jesus name. Amen. The
[1:05:36] Lord bless you. You can have your seat.
[1:05:38] Let's talk about this depth. Then
[1:05:41] I think I'm going to change my my
[1:05:43] message tonight and talk about the
[1:05:44] debtor.
[1:05:46] Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when when David came when
[1:05:53] David came to Jerusalem and after the
[1:05:57] death of Saul and all the people that
[1:06:00] were running behind him, you know, all
[1:06:03] the people that were running his
[1:06:04] campaign, they were all debtors.
[1:06:08] They said those that that were in depths
[1:06:10] and those that were in problems and you
[1:06:13] know those are the people running beyond
[1:06:14] David.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; David we vote for you. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But tonight I want to speak on
[1:06:23] borrow borrow the vessels and borrow not
[1:06:27] a few.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on borrow the vessels.
[1:06:32] Like I said, I was preaching to those
[1:06:33] people that night and uh uh uh uh it was
[1:06:37] kind of outside outside of the house.
[1:06:39] They just have a little tent before the
[1:06:42] house and and uh I was speaking to them
[1:06:45] and uh and I spoke on something, you
[1:06:48] know, uh uh out out of inspiration, but
[1:06:52] uh uh there was something that I spoke
[1:06:53] on that and it it meant something to me
[1:06:55] and I I thought about it as well. I I
[1:06:58] know I've spoken on this before, but not
[1:07:00] in the direction that I spoke on it. So,
[1:07:03] that's what I want to talk about
[1:07:04] tonight. Praise the Lord. Matthew
[1:07:06] chapter 5.
[1:07:08] Amen. Matthew chapter 5.
[1:07:12] uh uh Jesus will say here
[1:07:16] uh Matthew chapter 5 verse42 he says
[1:07:19] give to him that ask thee and from him
[1:07:23] and from him that will borrow of thee
[1:07:26] turn not thou away praise the Lord
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; turn not thou away now if you look if
[1:07:35] you look into this subject I'm not going
[1:07:37] to do on uh on on uh uh boring the
[1:07:41] deaths tonight. But where my mind is
[1:07:44] tonight uh uh that I want us to pay
[1:07:48] attention on is that every one of us
[1:07:52] that are serving the Lord, we are borrow
[1:07:55] vessels.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Every one of us,
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; if you uh if you are serving the Lord
[1:08:07] and you want the Lord to to make the
[1:08:10] best of you, you got to borrow him your
[1:08:12] vessel.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's where my thought
[1:08:15] is tonight. Praise the Lord. The Lord
[1:08:17] will take care of our debts. He will
[1:08:19] help us to pay them
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and uh because we we must pay them. And
[1:08:24] uh but tonight we just we want to talk
[1:08:26] more in a sense of uh uh uh uh being uh
[1:08:31] uh a borrow vessel to God. Being a
[1:08:34] borrow vessel to God. And this was the
[1:08:37] thought that struck me because when I
[1:08:39] was talking I told the people our Lord
[1:08:42] Jesus from the womb to the grave
[1:08:46] everything he had he borrowed.
[1:08:49] He borrowed the womb he had to be born
[1:08:51] in. He borrowed the grave. He had to be
[1:08:54] buried.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But you see, the Lord Jesus, he's uh
[1:09:00] he's this he's this uh uh uh uh he's
[1:09:03] this debtor or he's this he's this man
[1:09:06] that borrows. When whenever he borrows
[1:09:09] something from you, when he return it
[1:09:11] back to you is better.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He give it back to you better.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He give it back to you better. If you if
[1:09:20] you read the Lord, you read the Lord of
[1:09:23] God is the the the Lord of God. And when
[1:09:26] God h in in the book of Exodus and and
[1:09:30] God told the children of Israel, you
[1:09:32] know, if your brother borrow from you,
[1:09:34] you must never add an interest on it.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That was the law of God. You were not
[1:09:42] supposed to add an interest. When the
[1:09:44] son of Israel borrow from one another,
[1:09:46] they must not add an interest. God is
[1:09:49] saying that I, you know, I I I bless
[1:09:52] you.
[1:09:53] So if you are helping another man, don't
[1:09:56] don't put don't put charges over his
[1:09:58] head.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's able to pay you back, just
[1:10:06] take what he gives to you.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's that's the Lord of God.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; It's written right there in the
[1:10:12] scripture. Yes.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; But Y said here with our Lord Jesus, you
[1:10:17] know, uh uh it is not that he's paying
[1:10:20] you interest, but it is in a place of
[1:10:23] word uh uh uh uh in one sense he's
[1:10:27] appreciating you giving you know giving
[1:10:30] him whatever vessel you give him. In a
[1:10:32] message of perfect strength by perfect
[1:10:35] weakness. Brother Brham talks about this
[1:10:36] woman. He says, "One had just a a vessel
[1:10:41] with a little oil in it." That's the
[1:10:43] woman we read about tonight. She had
[1:10:45] nothing. Her two sons was going to be
[1:10:48] sold for bounding. She had nothing else
[1:10:53] she could do with this little vessel of
[1:10:56] oil. Wasn't very much.
[1:11:00] She was at the end.
[1:11:03] Elijah Elisha said to her said, "What
[1:11:08] have
[1:11:10] what have you got in your house?" Amen.
[1:11:14] Just like God telling Moses, "What is in
[1:11:16] your hands?"
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He always come and use the little that
[1:11:21] we have.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; If we are ready to give it to him,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Most of the time, uh the problem is that
[1:11:29] we are afraid.
[1:11:32] We think that uh we can take care of
[1:11:35] ourself better than God can.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; It's it's a it's an unconscious fear
[1:11:40] that we have.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It's an unconscious fear.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Elijah told the other widow woman, she
[1:11:47] said, "It's the last it's the last
[1:11:48] flower that I have." He said, "Okay,
[1:11:50] bake me a cake first."
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord likes to strike that
[1:11:58] God call when it looks like it is the
[1:12:01] last that you have.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Can you trust him with your last?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Can you trust God with your last birth?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; A sign that you can trust him with your
[1:12:14] last birth is to trust him with your
[1:12:16] first breath in the morning.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you can't give God
[1:12:20] your first breath in the morning, what
[1:12:22] proof you can give him the last one?
[1:12:25] Yeah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Like a man said, if you have a dollar
[1:12:28] and you can't pay, you can't take 10
[1:12:30] cents out of that, not a million dollar
[1:12:31] you will be able to take money from.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; If you cannot take h 10 cents from out
[1:12:39] of a dollar or $10 from out of a
[1:12:41] hundred, it's not when God gave you a
[1:12:43] million dollar that you coming to be us
[1:12:45] at church.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Stop joking. Stop lying to yourself in
[1:12:48] your mind. The proof that we can trust
[1:12:51] God with our last birth is that we can
[1:12:53] give him the first one in the morning.
[1:12:56] When we wake up and we see our
[1:12:57] heartbeating and we say, "Thank you,
[1:12:59] Jesus. Blessed be your name."
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the day holds, but I'm
[1:13:05] committing myself in your hands. I want
[1:13:08] to worship you. I want to praise you.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's a proof that you can give him
[1:13:12] your last birth.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Most people will want to give him their
[1:13:16] last birth because they don't want to
[1:13:18] die.
[1:13:19] They want him to save them.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; But yeah, here I said that we see here
[1:13:26] we we see a constant order in the
[1:13:28] scripture where where where God the
[1:13:30] prophet Elijah is demanding the last of
[1:13:33] these people. What you have lady, your
[1:13:35] sons are going to be the bomb and
[1:13:37] they're going to take them away from
[1:13:38] you. They're going to work in the field
[1:13:40] until the the the jubilee year.
[1:13:44] It's a jubilee year before they will
[1:13:46] come. They will come back.
[1:13:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So that's what we want to talk about
[1:13:54] this this evening.
[1:13:57] You know, borrow vessels.
[1:13:59] Borrow vessels
[1:14:01] and borrow not a few. When you are
[1:14:04] borrowing, you should borrow much. You
[1:14:06] remember the other the other king where
[1:14:08] the prophet told says uh uh uh uh uh
[1:14:11] take a ball and smite it
[1:14:15] and what he did he strike three times.
[1:14:19] The prophet says oh my god how foolish
[1:14:21] this man is. You have the opportunity to
[1:14:24] be able to strike as many times which
[1:14:28] mean how many times you strike that's
[1:14:30] that's how many victory you have over
[1:14:32] the enemy. So only three times he was
[1:14:35] able to beat the Syrians because he went
[1:14:38] to strike three times. So God Elijah is
[1:14:41] telling the woman borrow don't borrow a
[1:14:43] few. You see because the human mind
[1:14:46] because of our fear we always putting
[1:14:49] limit on God.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; We always putting limit on God. It's
[1:14:56] it's a it's a it's a subconscious think
[1:15:00] that comes from the fallen nature.
[1:15:03] Man, we are believing God. We are
[1:15:06] believing God. And you know that that h
[1:15:08] with God all things are possible. He can
[1:15:10] do you know but back in our mind you
[1:15:14] know the the the the the reason is that
[1:15:18] when man fell when we fell what we call
[1:15:20] the fall we fell from our soul to our
[1:15:26] body.
[1:15:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] You have to remember that before you
[1:15:33] became this flesh with get get five
[1:15:36] senses you were you were you were
[1:15:39] internal with God.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And you see that's where redemption is
[1:15:48] bringing us back to that's where the
[1:15:50] message of the hour is bringing us back
[1:15:53] to the consciousness of serving God from
[1:15:56] the soul.
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; What God want, he wants the
[1:16:04] consciousness of uh of his spirit in our
[1:16:08] soul to control this body.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; It's not this body detecting to our
[1:16:13] soul, but your soul detecting to this
[1:16:15] body.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; When the body says, "I'm tired," the
[1:16:18] soul say, "Get up. Carry me into church.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Get up. Carry me into work."
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The soul detecting or overtaking
[1:16:27] the body.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where he's bringing us to
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; because we have that sense of fear.
[1:16:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; You have the Holy Ghost. Yes. But let
[1:16:41] something happen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You realize out of a certain before you
[1:16:45] come to consciousness to start
[1:16:47] exercising your faith, the first thing
[1:16:49] that grab you is fear.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:54] The the the reason is because there is
[1:16:57] there is much of us in the flesh.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; There is much of us in the flesh.
[1:17:07] I heard one old man saying something. I
[1:17:10] I say I says, "Man, I he said it right."
[1:17:13] You know what he said? He says he said,
[1:17:15] "Lion, lion can only eat flesh."
[1:17:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] He said lion does not eat fruits.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Lion can only eat flesh. He said so when
[1:17:29] you are in the flesh, the devil that is
[1:17:32] like a rolling lion.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Oh man, he can chew you up.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are in the flesh.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "But if you are producing the
[1:17:41] fruit of the spirit, the the lion will
[1:17:44] never get you because he don't eat
[1:17:45] fruits. He only eat flesh."

[1:18:11] creator of the universe,
[1:18:15] the creator of the universe when he was
[1:18:18] coming to become our kinsman redeemer,
[1:18:22] he got that young girl uh h about 18
[1:18:27] years old, 18 and 20 years old. She's at
[1:18:31] a place where she having all of these
[1:18:33] plans in her mind like all of our young
[1:18:35] young uh girls have. They want to get
[1:18:38] married. They want to have children, you
[1:18:40] know, to think about their future and
[1:18:42] all of that. But yet uh he came down and

[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says one day he wanted to
[1:19:08] preach. He never had a pulpit. He had to
[1:19:11] borrow Peter's boat.
[1:19:15] Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; But but before he borrowed that boat,
[1:19:18] Peter was just a disappointed future man
[1:19:21] that will fish the whole night and
[1:19:23] caught nothing.
[1:19:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; He fished the whole night. He caught
[1:19:29] nothing.
[1:19:31] But then uh Yer said that when Jesus
[1:19:35] uh uh uh borrow his boat,
[1:19:39] are we together?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, we we have found him.
[1:19:42] Come and see." I can see the woman
[1:19:45] leaving
[1:19:47] they watching the men stop the ox in the
[1:19:51] field coming down to the bank of of of
[1:19:54] Galilee to listen to him. There was
[1:19:57] something different about him. He had he
[1:20:01] had authority from God.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And after his speaking, he had borrow
[1:20:08] one of their boat which he was to use as
[1:20:13] a pulpit.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; A little old dead fish boat, the
[1:20:19] greatest pulpit.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; There there he spoke to the multitude.
[1:20:25] And after borrowing the boat, he said,
[1:20:28] "Trust out, Simon into the deep, let
[1:20:32] down for the drought."
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; When he had fish the whole night and
[1:20:38] caught nothing,
[1:20:40] but was willing to borrow his boat to
[1:20:44] the master.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:21:26] that even the the the the Catholic
[1:21:28] Church has make her a deity. They call
[1:21:31] her the worship. They says, "Well, they
[1:21:33] got to call her name before they even

[1:22:06] where I'm going to tonight.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a spirit
[1:22:13] and if he will do anything in time, he
[1:22:16] needs a vessel.
[1:22:19] Just like Elijah told that woman, go and
[1:22:22] get the vessel. He need a vessel that he
[1:22:25] can use.
[1:22:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You just think about it. God borrowing
[1:22:31] your vessel to use it for 60 years and
[1:22:34] he giving you 1,000 years of millennium.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; What kind of a benefit is that? Praise
[1:22:40] the Lord.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; When people were useless their life in
[1:22:44] drinking and adultery and everything and
[1:22:47] and and and and when they die, that is
[1:22:50] the end.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; But he says, "You give me your youth.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Borrow me your youth."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I will give you 1,000 years
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; and then when you come from there, I
[1:23:04] give you eternity.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not this kind of a
[1:23:10] neighbor that borrow your thing and then
[1:23:12] he's fought it.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; No, there is nothing he has ever borrow
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; that he's fought. Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Some some I mean some people h I mean
[1:23:24] they came from a worse past.
[1:23:27] They were in uh drinking. They were in
[1:23:29] drugs. They were womanizing and uh h
[1:23:32] prostitution. Whatever it is. But when
[1:23:34] they give their life over to him, he he
[1:23:37] he changed their life.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; As he borrowed their life, he changed
[1:23:43] it. He he makes them a a a respectable
[1:23:46] person in the neighborhood in in their
[1:23:48] in their workplaces.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That is hard for people to even realize
[1:23:53] that this person had this past.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Borrow me your vessel.
[1:24:03] borrow me your vessel.
[1:24:06] In this generation that we are living
[1:24:08] in, God is looking for some vessel
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; that he can just pour a little bit of
[1:24:13] oil in.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, you love the Lord tonight.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] I didn't wanted to preach tonight, but
[1:24:29] you already get me preaching.
[1:24:32] that faith have saved thee. He didn't
[1:24:34] even have even have but one garment
[1:24:39] and borrow somebody grave to to lay in.
[1:24:42] Praise the Lord. The Bible says Joseph
[1:24:45] Amatia uh he his his grave was a brand
[1:24:48] new grave.
[1:24:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] I believe uh when he told his family
[1:24:58] that he was giving his grave to Jesus,
[1:25:00] he says, "Well, I thought I thought I
[1:25:02] thought it was I thought it was it was
[1:25:04] your grave." He said, "Don't worry. He's
[1:25:06] just using it for three days."
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; He's just using it for three days.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Now, that's why he said, "Destroy this
[1:25:17] temple and in three days."
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; So, he caught the revelation.
[1:25:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; He's just borrowing it for three days.
[1:25:28] You will give it back.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And you know what a feeling. What a
[1:25:34] feeling to know that the person that
[1:25:37] used this grave resurrected.

[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; What a feeling. Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You just think about the the the man
[1:25:47] that borrowed Jesus the band to for I I

[1:25:53] coming.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; To worship and says angels. I believe he
[1:25:57] was said, "Oh my God, if I knew I would
[1:25:59] have given him a bedroom."
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I would have given him a bedroom. Mama,
[1:26:05] we should have back out and put them in
[1:26:07] the bedroom.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But yet he has something to give.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. because there was no room in the
[1:26:15] in yet he had something to give.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; You think about it now. He gave his bag
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; and shepherds angels came down.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe the roof was laying one
[1:26:29] side.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; It was almost about to break. But
[1:26:33] because he borrow it
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; for almighty God to be born.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Angels came down and visited. You don't
[1:26:41] give God anything. Yeah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the reason why I don't regret
[1:26:50] my
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; that I've traveled for the Lord.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I don't regret.

[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Jesus. Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have one garment but
[1:27:25] borrow somebody graves to be to lay in.
[1:27:28] Listen to brother Brandon now. I could
[1:27:31] have been pretty well off if I took all
[1:27:34] the money people have offered me. But I
[1:27:38] want to be just as poor as those who
[1:27:42] came to be prayed for.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; We We are fellow citizens of the kingdom
[1:27:51] of God.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that just to be saved.
[1:27:57] I'm saying it because I I want you to
[1:28:02] know friends that the kingdom of God
[1:28:05] does not consist in riches or fine
[1:28:08] clothes.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It is sub submitted heart to God.

[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Because uh when when when the heart is
[1:28:34] submitted to God
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and God is borrowing their heart then
[1:28:39] everything that you have he can sustain.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Think about the people that walk in the

[1:28:57] sustaining your vehicle?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Even though it might be old or whatever
[1:29:02] is going on with your vehicle, but I
[1:29:04] mean as you sit down in that vehicle and
[1:29:06] say, "Lord, just be with me now as I'm
[1:29:08] going out, you know, bless me." He comes
[1:29:10] down and protected.

[1:29:51] woman and had to borrow the grave to be
[1:29:53] buried
[1:29:55] buried in God. A virgin shall conceive
[1:29:58] with with without uh uh sexually uh uh
[1:30:03] interception. Jehovah borrowed the womb
[1:30:06] of Mary, the woman, to perform the duty
[1:30:08] that he will give an everlasting sign.
[1:30:13] He just borrowed the womb of the woman
[1:30:16] and and and uh uh the same as he
[1:30:19] borrowed this body to preach
[1:30:23] the gospel from.

[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Now you see that's that's the thing with
[1:30:50] borrowing. If you borrow if you borrow
[1:30:52] some things and the the prophet says go
[1:30:54] and borrow B vessels. I mean, if there
[1:30:56] was one that was leaking, the woman will
[1:30:59] pull that oil back and chunk it away
[1:31:03] because it's leaking.
[1:31:05] Praise the Lord.

[1:31:19] Johannesburg, not driving back. I mean
[1:31:21] driving back to where we going. I was
[1:31:22] just thinking about that. I said, "Well,
[1:31:23] yeah, I never thought about it this way,
[1:31:25] but uh uh uh I'll give some thought to
[1:31:28] it. Every one of us,
[1:31:32] every one of us,
[1:31:35] we are all borrow vessels." Brother
[1:31:37] Abraham says uh as he borrowed this body
[1:31:39] to preach the gospel from and he
[1:31:42] borrowed your body to be sitting here
[1:31:43] tonight.

[1:31:59] to it to say, "Well, that's a son of God
[1:32:00] or that's a daughter of God." All they
[1:32:02] can say is, "Well, that girl, she funny.
[1:32:04] She's strange."
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; They might not be able to understand it
[1:32:08] because the the word is so corrupt.
[1:32:11] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God say you are just
[1:32:16] an oddball to them. That other girl, she
[1:32:18] very strange. You know that one, she
[1:32:21] like to dress like a old lady. That's
[1:32:23] why they might think. But if they will
[1:32:26] only know that your body has been

[1:42:18] the Lord. So God is borrowing vessel all
[1:42:22] over the world.

[1:42:26] because you you I mean you are taking it
[1:42:28] from you all the time.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; But there are others that are dedicating

[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; in prayer, in consecration,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; wanting to see God moving. Lord, use me
[1:42:42] to save somebody.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Use me to draw somebody to you. Make me
[1:42:46] a testimony. They are committing their
[1:42:49] body because they want to be used by
[1:42:50] God.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I can just have the courage to
[1:42:54] invite somebody to church,
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; I don't need to preach to them.

[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; The people that are always, you know,
[1:43:05] they they want to have an equal share of
[1:43:07] their vessel, they are the one that is
[1:43:09] complaining that God is not doing
[1:43:11] anything.
[1:43:12] But the ones that have given their
[1:43:14] vessel completely and every day they
[1:43:16] want to feel the effect of the master
[1:43:19] using their vessel, they always have a
[1:43:22] testimony.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; If we really borrow our vessel to God
[1:43:38] and say, "Lord, let your name be raised
[1:43:40] in this place."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] this little fellowship will be
[1:43:43] different.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; It will not just be a good shepherd
[1:43:52] fellowship and uh uh uh Lord, it would
[1:43:55] not just be a good sheep shepherd
[1:43:57] fellowship, but be a a fellowship where
[1:44:01] uh there will be that will be a a living
[1:44:03] h a a testimony and and and and
[1:44:06] manifestation.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:10] I mean, we would be so burdened that uh
[1:44:13] uh people would come and and say uh you

[1:44:18] a young lady I saw at Walmart. I want us

[1:44:22] to know her name.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You don't have to know her name.
[1:44:26] But you are just burdening that when you
[1:44:29] see people you want to pray for them. I
[1:44:31] pass a young man on the street. I don't
[1:44:32] know what's wrong with him but I just
[1:44:34] want us to pray for him.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because your vessel is turned over.

[1:44:57] don't have a burden to pray for
[1:44:58] somebody?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] That's the reason why we really don't
[1:45:04] have a prayer life
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; because we are not burdening for people.
[1:45:09] The Lord has meet our needs. We fe we we
