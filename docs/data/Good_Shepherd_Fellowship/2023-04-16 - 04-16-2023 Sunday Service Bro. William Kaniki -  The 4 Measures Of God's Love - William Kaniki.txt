eyes praise the Lord amen amen so uh I pray I need you from Brother John Bibi he's away this morning so he asks that we remember him in prayer and uh we just we just want to thank the Lord uh Sister Mary are you feeling much better well I praise the Lord give me this morning with a pain on her heart and so uh we just pray for her back there believing that the Lord is going to bless us in his presence this morning amen amen the Lord has been so good to us you know uh as you look into the word of the Lord before we call the preacher this morning uh I would just I just want us to just uh uh kind of a a place I will mine on the Lord and think about his goodness think about the goodness of the Lord if you look at this scripture in the Bible there will be in Deuteronomy chapter 23 in the autonomy chapter 23 we will read verse 2. [Music] praise the Lord and uh uh foreign he's so good in the way that he deal with us I've been looking at a few of this and just to see that God in the richness of his Mercy uh you know Moses said these things and like I was saying on Wednesday night you read it in a scripture and then you look at it as a law of God you look at it as a lord of God and then it looks more like because of our our natural birth where the Lord has redeemed us from which of course brother Branham said is is uh we always stay with us as a sticky nature when the when the truthness of gods were come sometimes we we relate to that stick in nature and it looks like uh the word is condemning us or the word is trying to to remind us of our past and and all of that but the mind of God God's picture that he have in his mind is uh is far past whatever that we are going through and whatever that we are dealing with God's desire is to be able to bring us to the picture that he had about you in his mind praise the Lord the prophet of God said he took a picture of you and that's and that's the image that he have kept before him all of this wine praise the Lord but you see he speaks a language to us uh uh and then sometimes it looks like uh [Music] you know he's he's uh he's calling us you know Jesus over here in the book of Deuteronomy in in the Book of Luke Jesus referred to something that Moses said in the book of Deuteronomy and uh when you look at that uh just like I said let's let's just read this portion uh I brought you to uh verse 2 the Bible says Ambassador Shana enter into the congregation of the Lord even to the 10th Generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord in verse 3 we talk about the ammonites and the moabites which will refer to the two sons the Lord's heart with his daughters in as much as this looks it is the word of God and and God in this word here is uh uh you know laying things down for his people but if you if we look in the mind of God a little bit you will realize they are the uh we appreciate God for his grace we appreciate God for his Mercy because if you go to Matthew chapter 2 and then you start to read in the genealogy of Jesus Christ you will realize the other this scripture that looks like a commandment of God and God is saying that these people they don't have a truth identification of their father you realize they are the on the other side of the picture is a prophecy praise the Lord on the other side of the picture is a prophecy because if you read Matthew chapter 2 and Matthew starts to give an account of the genology of Jesus Christ he comes down the list of people from Abraham and he comes right into that story of Jacob and Judah comes out and in his third of Judah he brings the story of tema and he will talk about fearash the son that Judah had with his daughter-in-law but go back read your Bible you will realize that if you count from tema down to David is a tenth generation you read the greatest Redemption Story the greatest Redemption story in the Bible the way God play out his Redemption story of how he will bring the Lord through the Jews and then he will re he will he will bring the Gentile in by the Jews bringing their message to the Gentiles and through the Gentiles also he will restore back to the Jews the amaziah the greatest romance Redemption story that is in the Bible The Book of Ruth now we look at Ruth but many times we don't look at the background of boas the kingsman Redeemer do you realize that Boaz is the son of Rahab praise the Lord we look at Ruth as being a moabite now you think about it now naturally naturally think about it what what attraction the boys had to roof it's a sea lion there was a genetic something in him because they were all in the same sea lion the Bible says after Jericho 4 a prince of Judah married Rahab Simon and Rahab gave birth to boas praise the Lord [Music] savior he's going to be the case may Redeemer so if you look at the story God look at our natural birth because brother Branham said that natural birth was between the serpent and Eve every one of us our natural birth is a bastard birth is not of the word [Music] praise the Lord amen every one of us our natural birth that's the reason why we press true to break through our natural nature to be able to embrace the nature of God because just by our natural birth we will all go away from the word of God we were all straight we come to the word speaking lies is because it was a bastard birth between Eve and the second but you see God put this year as a commitment and also as a prophecy that there is an appointed time there is an appointed time 10th Generation what is the number 10. it's election you bring the tenth of all that you have to the Lord [Music] it speaks of election so you see he calling us to a higher and brother and myself was talking something yesterday and he was talking about the portion of the Gentiles around the Tabernacle the gentai portion was the outside of the Tabernacle and there was a holy place and you know and the Jews have to go in there you see when God taught about you and myself the way he taught to live with us was not from the outside praise the Lord God desired to be with us was from the inside he knew he had a predestinated seed that he placed in you and at an appointed time you will hear the word of God and you will start to respond to their predestinated seed but because it is this outside man that you know all of this wide you get confused when God is actually calling and dealing with you from the inside [Music] to the outside praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's stand to our faith we will sing a song here and then we will bring the preacher up we have brother William and brother William he's from Madrid he's from Spain he's uh he's a he's a medical doctor there and also a pastor of a local church he's in the country visiting and and he was down with brother Brooks and uh so we made contact to have him come up here to to speak to us and uh and and it's it's encouraging that one of the reasons why I feel blessed having our brother to come it is also to many of you young people you know that God bless to uh uh whether by your parents in other means to come overseas and uh he's he's just he's just one of you or one of us traveled away from home and went overseas to study and uh and he's telling and and he says serving the lord preaching the word you know is is such a blessing you know it's just such a blessing by God you know will be able to do these things thousands of miles away from your parents you know from your Homeland but yet you can be like shedra bishop and a Benny girl you can be like down your purpose in your heart not to defy yourself you know and you can you can steady and be uh uh uh you know and be a banker and still be a daughter of God you can study and be a nurse and still be a daughter of God you can study and and be a doctor and still be a Son of God you have to know your primary identity is a child of God whatever your career is is just a title it's just a title that's not your identity identity is the Son of God and we want to be a Son of God and a daughter of God all the days of our life no matter what we have found to do whether you are a janitor you are a garbage man and whatever you are you want to be a son of God that's that's your vocation that's your calling that's your identity the Lord bless you this morning our brother will come and uh uh let's sing this song while we have our brother come and speak to us this morning and uh who you bring us the word of the Lord praise the Lord and I was I was thinking uh let's sing this song it's a wonderful thing [Music] very wonderful thing to be free from sin and have

name of Jesus Christ and on Earth as well we have a family I met people that were hugging him yeah it means that there is a family on the other side when they hug him they said this is what you told us when you were on Earth amen amen glory be to God verse says verse 16. thank you that he would Grant you said according to the riches of his life to be strengthened foreign [Music] skill s s is the spirit it's different than the human Spirit but when we talk about the spirit of God you have to be strengthened of God foreign you can be strengthened it's not something that has to be uh who it sounds he has to be powerfulness please by his spirit and long interior in the inner men if you look at these characters becoming that you know that inside there is something and therefore but when
