let's take our Bibles tonight we just want to read from the book of Genesis thank you brother AR and uh praise the Lord amen amen amen that would be Genesis 21 if I'm right praise the Lord Genesis 21 Let's uh read from verse 9 I was listening to message some time ago and brother B says something in line with this chapter I just I just want to share that with you tonight on this prayer meeting Genesis 21 let's read from verse 9 and Sarah saw the uh the son of haga the Egyptian which she had born unto Abraham Morgan wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this bound woman and her son for the son of this bound woman shall not be hiss with my son even I ISAC you realize that Paul used that that particular statement in Galatians chapter 4 he use it exactly the way Sarah said it praise the Lord now that's a reason why there's a reason why I I I said that wherefore let's read that again she said unto Abraham Sarah said unto Abraham cast out this bound woman and her son for the son of this bound woman shall never be with my son even with Isaac and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son ishmail was his son and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lead and because of the bound woman in all that Sarah have said unto thee Ying unto her voice for in Isaac shall their seed be called Praise the Lord now I believe is because the Lord is telling Abraham here listening to what Sarah said I believe that's the reason why the Apostle Paul took that as a word of God and he repeated exactly what Sarah said because God is coming down and says don't be Grievous you do exactly what Sarah said let's read on the little bit verse 13 and also of the son of the bound woman will I make a nation because he is thy seed and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hear putting it in I mean putting it on her shoulder and the child and send her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Bel Sheba and the water was spin in the bottle and she cast the child on one of the stra and she went and and and sat her down over against him a good way off which mean she sat down looking at him but she was away from him a good way of as it were a bll Shar for she said let me now see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept and God heard the voice of the L and the angel of and the angel of God called unto hega out of heaven and said unto her what L did hear fear not for God have heard the voice of the Le where is he arise lift up the lead and hold him in the that hand for I will make him a great nation and God opened her eyes she saw the vision and she saw a well of water and went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lead to drink and God saw and God was with the lead and he grewed ured in the wilderness and became uh uh now so let's stop there okay let's stop there the Lord bless you you can have your seat you can have your seat now this is this is what uh I saw I'm just going to read there to you tonight and uh I hope he bless you just like it did to me once again thank you for making the pray pray meeting tonight praise the Lord amen now brother Brandon will make this statement in the message remembering the Lord this is what caught my my attention I can think of re remembering of the Lord again at a place of refreshment in the well called uh bear which means in the Hebrew Hebrew tongue The Well of him that liveth and seeth praise the Lord now listen to this now this is what caught my attention hega misunderstood yet in the line of duty praise the Lord Amen brother brandham say heel misunderstood yet in the line of duty misunderstood misjudge and was cast out with no place to go with a perishing child and the water was spent in the bottle and the little fellow was crying and only a mother heart will know what it means to hear that child that cry for water only a mother heart would know what it means to hear that cry for water as his little tongue swer and his lip ped and uh her baby weakling every minute cast out right in the line of duty no place to go praise the Lord she had she she had done without herself till she squeezed the last drop over his little passion L and then the water was dried and she lie it down and started on and the little fellow streaming for water and he got weaker and weaker and heard only CH now this is what caught my my mind before we go for you brother brandom said he was talking about being Miss understood being Mis judge amen he says of her being right in the landine of Duty praise the Lord Sarah was the one that took her as a maid are we together Sarah was the one that came up with the suggestion of producing the promised son I can't have a son take my M to have the son praise the Lord it was not hael that was uh misbehaving herself around Abraham it was Sarah that brought the suggestion praise the Lord now see what brother Brandon is saying now she was right in the line of duty are we together amen and Y said she was Miss Jorge why Sarah is is is you know waiting on on uh uh having the son now now uh hear is having her son maybe she playing with her son and calling him names and and and and Sarah feeling bad she misjudged the situation and she said castle out praise the Lord are we together now brother Brandon will go down we will read a little bit down he will go down and he will bring this talk in the sense of how do we handle when we are misjudged by people when we think we are misunderstood what do we do praise the Lord and it's something that we all deal with one way or another whether it's husband or wife whether it is uh children and parent whether it is uh the assembly and the pastor the pastor and the people what whether it's our co-workers misunderstanding is something that we deal with all of the time but how do we handle it praise the Lord how do we handle it there is nothing she will say that will matter at that time the scripture says Sarah said that she was mogging her that was Sarah thought of the of what was going on but was she really mogging Sarah was she doing that to get to Sarah or Sarah was just dealing with her own complex praise the Lord now what I want us to realize is that prophecy is hanging over these people this whole thing is going to is going to give birth to a prophecy where the Apostle Paul would take in the book of of Galan and make us to know what is the bound woman and what is the free woman this is prophecy that is playing out even though they are living their their their their normal life they are living their normal life but God is playing prophecy in their life praise the Lord God is playing things in their life like brother brandom said in the chrisis The Mystery of God reveal he says Those Old Testament characters never knew that God was was playing out prophecy in their life they were living their normal life but God was the one turning the wheels of Prophecy how do we deal with misunderstanding how do we deal when you feel that you are misjudged praise the Lord amen that's that's what caught my attention I was I was I was listening to the statement I think I was doing something in and when the prophet God said that I I pay close attention to this because uh uh I realize even as myself sometimes you are misunderstood and sometimes I misunderstand people there it's something that you Cann you cannot do without you are either misunderstood or you misunderstand people if you think that you don't misunderstand people then I mean you have to come to the reality that you are a human amen you are born in a failing body your mind do not serve you right all the time praise the Lord the prophet of God will call it right in the line of Duty which mean she's doing what she was told to do she's not breaking the word amen because many times when we talk about the character of hegar we we just we just sometimes just talk about this Egyptian woman that came over to uh to Abraham house she was a servant I mean she did not force herself on Abraham this was all Sarah idea praise the Lord sometimes the things that we we think are right I mean because we are so finished and we are so limited there is no provision in our mind for the future because we don't foresee it until God reveal it to us for the moment we think that whatever we are seeing whatever we are thinking we think that is the right thing praise the Lord it was God that made the promise it was God that gave the promise to Abraham that through your seed I'll make you the father of Nations it was not Sarah that that made the promise but because she was included in the promise and she did not have the patience to wait on the promise she H breeded The Promise by bringing in this Egyptian woman praise the Lord amen the seed is now held with the Shar brother Brandon will take from Galatians and include uh uh uh he will include uh uh how do we call it now hagga Sarah and Mary talking about bringing the promised son so hega came in as an interruption but her place was necessary amen even though it looks like an interruption but her place was necessary are we together let's go down a little bit here it's a beautiful story because if you realize in the reading of the scripture the Bible says she laid a child she went out and and and and she sat back and she started crying I mean as a mother her heart was broken but when God will hear from heaven and God will respond to her cry God will not say I have heard your cry he said I have heard the CED of the Lamb why because that was the Seed of Abraham praise the Lord amen thou was a Seed of Abraham and like brother Brandon would say to us that is the natural Instinct that God plac in his children that's the Natural Instinct that God plac in every child to want something and cry for it praise the Lord amen sometimes I do forget because I I tell my daughter do you have to cry for something to get it but it's the Natural Instinct that's the way that God designed them they have to cry to be able to get praise the Lord until they can be able to grow and and that's the way that God designed us that's the way he designed us sometimes you realize that uh uh uh uh uh when when when uh when when when things are bothering you or you you are really in their channel of of praying I don't know about you but uh many times uh I feel like uh uh uh uh you get in that place of Brokenness amen for you to really be able to get out of your flesh and get in the spirit of worship and get in the spirit of prayer you got to get in the place of Brokenness I almost feel like you are breaking away from the Flesh and breaking into the spirit and and when you get in the place of Brokenness sometimes you don't even able to alter your words all you do you just cry that's that's the way that God designed us I think he listen to our cry more than much of the things that we say because when we cry out to God a Al of things just like Paul says we in ourself we don't know how to pray he says it's the spirit that make it utterance so sometimes cry brings out the dep thing from your spirit the thing that your mouth is not really able to express to God some times when you cry your tears expresses it praise the Lord amen he says here he says no doubt but what her innocent heart will cry out oh God I have done wrong what have I done and she couldn't stand to see the child die in her arm so she laid him on a bush and she went about a board shot just like a b and Irish shot a distance away and uh uh probably a 100 years or more and seeing a little tree and she nail down she nailed down and there she begins to weep she can't explain it she can't put it into words what have I got myself into I have a life on my hands if if it were just me alone I won't mind I just I just travel I mean if I meet people that that kill me that's okay but this child this innocent child praise the Lord now you can also see that in the contrary she could think that how crel could s be react and reaction to being misunderstood what have I done even if I have done anything to her why couldn't she think about this child why couldn't she take the child and just ask me to go how do we how do we handle misunderstanding when we are misunder to how do we handle it praise the Lord for she wonder why if she did what was right why should this thing come upon her many times we think that in our sickness in affliction see but may maybe it's all done to show the grace and the mercy of God and exactly what was happening is because they were under prophecy she couldn't understand that she was fulfilling prophecy praise the Lord she couldn't understand it that she were fulfilling prophecy Sarah herself could also could Now understand how did she ever came to the place I mean for her to gave this girl to Abraham means that among all her servants this was the one that she love love the most just like how Ela was to Abraham that's the same way hagga was to sarum praise the Lord she had other female servant but for her to take this girl and give her to her husband close her matrimonial door and go and sit down and say maybe Sarah will bring the one I mean haga will be the one to bring us the child that we need this was somebody that she loved how could she go from that place of loving this person to not want to even see her again how how do we go from those places in our life what happened praise the Lord misunderstanding and there is a big picture and she can even see the big picture she don't have no idea of the big picture she's just looking at what is happening now what will all the servants in the house say I realize when I come out of the room everybody eyes is just looking at me praise the Lord her complex is ministering to her her complex is saying thousand different words to her in her mind and she slammed the door as soon as I enter the house she slammed the door maybe the girl was not even thinking about maybe she never even knew Sarah was coming she's now interpreting every everything that is happening everything oh how the devil love to get us in that spot how he loveed to get us right in that spot that's the place where the devil can do the greatest robbery that he can ever do to a man is to get him in the place of misunderstanding praise the Lord I know I know for trueth I know Abraham I mean it was just night after night as soon as Abraham comes comes from in the field that's the that's the first thing that he's greeted with and not a complain I can even have peace in my home I'm no longer the Mistress of this home glory be to God you love the Lord how do we miss deal with misunderstanding how do we deal when we are misjudged praise the Lord many times we Fe right into it we feed right into it and then we starts to fire back that's the way the flesh will deal with it that's the way the human nature would deal with it we Fe right into it and we start to fire back there's not much she could do here because Abraham is going to listen to his wife by an order from the Lord God is going to order him listen to Sarah and put that woman away if sometimes we will just only realize we'll just realize some of the things that is happening in the word in the r behind us praise the Lord if we were just realize that some of the things that uh that we encounter that we deal with it just have so little to do with us praise the Lord it just have so little it's just because God may you allow you to be born allow you to grow up he gave you Grace for you to be saved and now he's trusting you that by the knowledge of his word that you have learned you will you will you will compose yourself as a Son of God or compose yourself at a as a daughter of God in a moment sometimes it does not have much to do with us did everything that job went through does it have to do with him no it does not have anything to do with job and his attitude it had to do with a God that made us for his pleasure and want to do with us whatever it pleases him and sometime we behave as if we have the stearing wheel in our hands and we can do whatever we want to do but you missing the picture because your sight is so short praise the Lord your sight is so short that she ever realize in her lifetime that an angel of the Lord will speak to her if she never had this situation she would never had an Angelic visitation praise the Lord she sat there many times in the house and she heard Abraham saying the Lord said to me the Lord said to him I wonder how God speak to him she's singing I wonder how God speak to him you remember Abraham always say this thing God the Lord speak to him how do God speak to him I wonder is just his imagination is it a dream if she never had that experience she would never had Angelic visitation and some things that God allowed in our life is to give us Angelic visitation praise the Lord is to give us Angelic visitation how do we deal with misunderstanding how do we deal when you feel misjudge how do you handle it do you just drop into your element and starts to fire back I'm not going to sit down here for anybody to think I'm stupid I'm not going to sit down here for anybody to think you just drop into your element if it was an occasion that God has trusted you I'm I'm preaching this tonight it looks like a Simon but you never know how this thing deal with me how I sat back I said oh oh God oh God oh God if we ever have the heart to be on to be able to understand what this whole thing about Redemption is what is God doing with our life or he just placed us here for us to fight our way through things and to just prove to these people that nobody I'm not stupid praise the Lord you know the story one time David he was there in that land and the people realized it says this is the man that that that that that they were all singing about David K 10,000 this man if we allow him to be here he's he's aspired for the Israelite this one this man was anointed the prophet Samuel had anointed him but the Bible said David had to play the food he had to lay it on the street like a mad man he tore his clothes he allowed spit to be coming from his mouth because he wanted to preserve his life if he wanted to prove that he's a king and nobody would think I'm stupid they were going to kill him praise the Lord amen like one of my friend told me over there in South Africa a good friend brotheri were talking one time something and he he said this to me in a you know uh uh I mean one young man was learning how to drive you know and uh the the the the driver instructor told him and said boy you got to slow down he said no but it was my right to turn he say yeah if you don't slow time slow down you'll die for Your Right sometimes people that that are hate in accident is not because they were wrong it's because they were trying to prove that they were right so sometimes you allow your right goal or else you would die for your right how do we deal with misunderstanding and sometimes that's the thing that flaws our mind how do people think about me how do people see me what would they say about me how do that matter how do that matter it's not paying your bills it's now meeting your needs praise the Lord how do that matter do you know how much better our life will be if every day we go with the same thought I want how the Lord think about me this morning and say Lord I woke up this morning I'm dressed how do you see me I'm talking to you Lord how do you see me am I pleasing you I wonder if we live our life like that how healthy we will be how happy we will be praise the Lord Oh my he God misunderstood yet in the L of Duty misunderstood miss judge and she was even cast out and it was not her fault it was not her fault glory be to God Amen oh my I was trying to see back here that trying to look for the day you just to share with you uh how many months I've I've I've just I've just taught on this constantly just been dwelling on my mind because tonight was a prayer meeting actually brother ER was supposed to speak but we kind of for change the order of the service tonight so I just said okay I just I just share this thing with the church tonight and uh uh let's just read on a little bit here we're so close many times we think that our sickness and and and and AFF flection seed but maybe it's all done to show grace and mercy and while she Tau she heard the little fainted cry that they finally FedEd out for water she heard a voice speak and said why weepeth down I I I would believe in my mind that uh that's hear her to death when she heard the voice of the Lord or the voice of the angel I will believe that that's that's scar her to death she even forgot about her child maybe she Rose in the place of Defense just like Joshua stood before the angel and said are you with us or are you against us she might have Rose to a place of defense and looking looking around and says who's that trying to look for a stick on the ground or anything to protect herself but if you realize the question was not attacking her the question was to help her amen the question that the angel asked was to help her why weepth down why you want to take uh something to defend yourself against somebody that want to help you but sometimes you see when Mis understanding make us to build complex in our life it's hard for us to even see help when help is on the way praise the Lord here say she's having the greater experience that any mortal could have to hear the voice of the Lord or hear the voice of the Angel of the Lord she's having the greater experience that any morar will be able to have but you see her complex in her with the rejection the misjudgment of Sarah and everything that she have done I mean all down the road she was walking she was she was not praying she was just talking to herself in her head what she think she is I mean she talk talk talk until she realized there is no more water that's what we do sometimes we just complain we just I mean we just thr faith and just do everything when we don't even have nothing behind us to help us and realize realize now God waited until she came to the place word the water is gone she might have stay days there is no breast milk to breast the baby she don't have anything to eat because with all those thing that she have if God will have come in that moment she would not even listen she might even be running away from that voice that is trying to help her but she he waited until she came to her place of need she came to a place of desperation praise the Lord that's my exhortation to you tonight how do we handle misunderstanding praise the Lord how do we handle when we are being misjudged when all you trying to do is just to be a wife and you are misunderstood all you are trying to do is just to fix food for you to eat and you are misunderstood all you are trying to do is just to help make need for the family and you are Miss how do we handle that brother brandham says she looked up and she saw a well bubbling up w a spring of refreshment bahira like he said I may have mispronounced it he spell it out there he he says the well of water that liveth the The Well of him that liveth and seeth me The Well of him that liveth and and he never started seeing her from the time she was in trouble he started seeing her from the time she was conceived in the womb he saw when when Sarah took her hands and gave her to Abraham he saw that the one that liveth and seeth everything that we are doing praise the Lord now if he see if he if he see if a living God is among us we have him in our home we have him in our life he seeth he liveth and seeth everything that we are doing how then do we handle misunderstanding what should be our first approach who should be the one that we talk to first when I feel that I'm misunderstood why should I fight to prove myself right the one that liveth and seeth everything he knows the end from the beginning praise the Lord oh my glory be to God it's beautiful it's beautiful to know that there is no passing moment in our life that God is not in control amen nothing Tak him by surprise amen I mean not not only about people not only about people that we live with it doesn't have to be even sometimes we misunderstand ourself sometimes we misunderstand ourself sometime we misjudge ourself praise the Lord when we get to that place how do we deal with it because let me tell you misunderstanding misunderstanding is one of the most easier thing to throw you into a complex it throw you into a complex you start hearing voices when nobody is talking you start seeing things when nobody is passing The Well of him that liveth in Seth him that can die Meed elsh him that liveth and seeth me noring my needs he's the one that I have to deal with he sees me he knows my need when I get to that place word I misunderstand my strength I misunderstand my ability let me go back to the one that seeth me and knoweth me else shall th him that liveth and seeth me knowth my need he remembers me amen he remembered that's a Seed of Abraham he know you are a Seed of Abraham praise the Lord and for his name's sake glory be to God he that liveth and Seth me knowing my name pleas he remember me and there he remember me as I remember him and I know that he liveth and and he has sprung up here in the desert this well brother Bram said oh we could apply that in an hour message right now of this day when the desert the desert of churches and denomination is is trying to applyed to the state of his ministry now he says all the shua gospel preachers the faction of the word has creep in and denomination and and all the breaking up and all of these things and then to think that there stand again tonight The Well of him that liveth and seeth me that's what remembering Christ you means to the worshipper oh she was misunderstood and cast out Jesus said when he was here on Earth I'm the Living Water I'm the Water of Life praise the lord we can go on and on tonight but I just want us to come to that place of meditation tonight and remember it is him that we have to deal with he's the one that serar of us he's the one that knoweth us he knows what you're dealing with he knows the fiber of our body he knows our makeup praise the Lord and as long as we stay in this life we will deal with misunderstanding we will be misjudged be misunderstood or be misjudged is not the issue it's how you deal with it let's go to the Lord in prayer as we close the prayer meeting tonight search me the Lord and know my heart today let's just sing there as we pray oh Jesus oh Jesus try
