[27:27] know they was gonna put me on a second
[27:29] shift and I was not supposed to know

[49:50] word this morning but once again is good
[49:53] to have each and every one of you with
[49:55] us praise the Lord and I just saw
[49:59] brother Ibaka he's a friend to brother
[50:04] Daniel over in Chris ministry and had a
[50:08] privilege to talk to him on the phone
[50:09] his good reporter face to the name who
[50:12] will have you with us
[50:14] and the ones that you came with this
[50:15] morning praise the Lord Amen but it's
[50:19] good to be in the house of the Lord
[50:20] brother Aaron is now on a drum because
[50:22] he's over in Wisconsin
[50:24] he took brother Elijah to preach there
[50:26] for Birju he asked away but Samuel I
[50:30] preached for us all to get from Uganda
[50:34] on Wednesday it is over in North Dakota
[50:37] praise the Lord you know I just I just
[50:44] thought about it this weekend
[50:46] having all of these brothers with us I
[50:49] just thought you know I don't know what
[50:53] we are doing but it looks like God is
[50:55] beginning to trust us amen amen and
[50:58] whatever it is may he help us to do the
[51:01] right praise the Lord
[51:02] amen and the Lord also trusted us with
[51:08] the situation of sister Kish and and we
[51:13] believe in God
[51:15] she will I told her this morning
[51:20] that's the scripture that came to my
[51:23] mind there is no condemnation to them
[51:26] that are in Christ they have passed from
[51:29] death unto life
[51:30] so I told us if you have if you have
[51:33] been in Christ and you have already
[51:35] passed your death amen and I'm looking
[51:38] forward to see you coming alive but she
[51:42] went to the hospital and started getting
[51:46] numbness in her right forth
[51:50] and then the right foot went completely
[51:54] numb I would say completely dead and and
[51:57] she was not getting no sense of feeling
[52:00] in it until that night Rolly larger I
[52:03] myself went to visit her and then she
[52:07] told me you know she just prayed and
[52:11] before that evening she started feeling
[52:13] some sensation in her leg so and but
[52:18] then then the following day she could
[52:22] now walk on it so she's done she was
[52:24] giving therapy and they did s trade
[52:28] another thing at first they said nothing
[52:30] wrong but this morning she called me
[52:32] that it says she had fractured something
[52:37] in her knee and so that's the reason why
[52:42] she having pains even me
[52:44] she said well brother one I walk to the
[52:46] hospital you know I was walking on my
[52:49] fault so I told her this morning I said
[52:52] I said look forget about that knee what
[52:55] is happening here is dead because what
[52:58] is happening Church is the other sister
[53:02] Kish there's a major part of her organ
[53:06] that is that is honor attacked by the
[53:08] devil she's losing her liver so when a
[53:12] major part of your organ is affected the
[53:16] rest of your organ starts to become
[53:19] affected that's what the devil does amen
[53:22] if he can so one seed of doubt in you he
[53:26] will ruin your mind with fear with
[53:30] horror
[53:30] praise the Lord amen if he can expose
[53:34] you to any form of uncleanness he will
[53:38] drive your body to do the same
[53:41] that's the reason why young people
[53:43] stayed away from the things that are now
[53:45] right that just the devil all he needs
[53:48] to do is to just drop one thing into
[53:51] your system so I told her this morning I
[53:56] said what is happening to use is the
[53:59] cage it is there because of your health
[54:05] different part of your bodies will start
[54:08] becoming affected so because she says
[54:14] she said she's a better one pray for me
[54:16] and I want to walk again I said I don't
[54:18] want to want to see you walking again I
[54:20] want to see you living again
[54:23] praise the Lord I want to don't want to
[54:27] see you walking I want to see you living
[54:29] again
[54:30] praise the Lord but just like I said on
[54:33] Wednesday night you know every time we
[54:35] come and testified about sister quiche
[54:37] then the devil tried to make it worse
[54:39] and every time he's making the worse
[54:41] it's getting better every time he make
[54:47] it worse is getting better praise the
[54:50] Lord
[54:54] I've never seen the Lord forsaking the
[54:58] righteous
[54:59] amen the Lord never forsake the Ranchers
[55:03] praise the Lord we believe that that's
[55:06] the reason why we serve God in
[55:08] righteousness
[55:11] you can save the Lord in deception the
[55:14] Bible say be not deceived God is not
[55:16] mocked whatever a man so that's what he
[55:18] will reap but when you save God in
[55:21] righteousness he never forsake the
[55:24] righteous are we together so she wanted
[55:31] me to greet you this morning and she
[55:34] asks that we pray for her so we would do
[55:39] that and then we would call pastor Neal
[55:45] pastor Neal is to be very particular
[55:51] he's brought a dill his father brother
[55:55] Deli is his first son and the second
[55:59] brother family was here he preached for
[56:01] us and but he's he's also a dear to me
[56:08] because I remember when we lost our
[56:11] church and and then we went over to
[56:16] night I had an open door to Nigeria when
[56:21] I went to Nigeria there that church was
[56:24] the first church I went to so it became
[56:26] a home church there for me they were the
[56:29] one that was running all of my programs
[56:31] and making meetings for me and
[56:34] sponsoring my trip and I was reporting
[56:37] to him as my pastor praise the Lord and
[56:41] I remember one time he wanted you just
[56:45] wanted to spend some time with me so he
[56:48] acts that we drive we went about some
[56:52] kilometres down in in the country
[56:55] there's another brother there but Simon
[56:58] Peter and I was going to have meetings
[57:01] there but he just wanted us to spend
[57:03] some time together and we were just
[57:06] conversing driving he was he was the
[57:08] driver and now
[57:11] he's 73 years old praise the Lord
[57:17] amen but you know just like I've always
[57:20] said I look to see the resurrection of
[57:24] the Dead
[57:24] amen praise the Lord and that's the
[57:27] reason why I'm not committing cystic
[57:29] Easter to death but I told her husband
[57:32] and I said if anything happened before
[57:35] the rojo to the mortuary give me a call
[57:37] that just how strong my faith is I don't
[57:41] care what you are thinking and what you
[57:43] are feeling but that just how strong my
[57:45] faith is praise the Lord
[57:50] but like I said I'm looking to see the
[57:52] resurrection of the dead so Bernie will
[57:55] preach to us this morning now like a
[57:58] young man because he's not a young man
[58:00] but he would talk to us you know better
[58:03] Branham says when John returned back
[58:06] from the island of Patmos and he went to
[58:10] the efficient Church the book our first
[58:14] John and second John and ter John was
[58:18] written when John came back from the
[58:21] island of Patmos so he started to talk
[58:25] to the church like his children he said
[58:29] my little children walk in the light as
[58:33] he is in the light praise the Lord and
[58:37] that's how pastor Niels preached so he's
[58:40] coming to talk to us as his children in
[58:42] the faith and I gotta go back and tell
[58:47] you some of the things of
[58:50] of his life praise the Lord he was a
[58:55] pastor of a Baptist Church and a
[58:59] respected minister in the South in
[59:01] Baptist group and all of the adding when
[59:05] he saw the message he he turned over the
[59:10] the Baptist credential he came back to
[59:15] his local church and he introduced the
[59:19] message those that wanted to go with the
[59:22] Baptist system left and and then he
[59:27] started from there so he's been around a
[59:30] long time
[59:31] praise the Lord he's he's highly
[59:34] respected in Nigeria so we were having

[1:04:07] several time in the weekend
[1:04:09] I never got him a cell phone so he

[1:05:08] sixty years old being leading sons for
[1:05:11] more than forty years before even some
[1:05:13] of us were born and for as long as I
[1:05:18] know I've been in this church attaining
[1:05:21] supporting pastoring unless he has to
[1:05:28] travel

[1:06:40] see somebody doing something right
[1:06:42] for it to encourage you to do the same
[1:06:48] because before this Bible before this
[1:06:51] Bible was written to be a book it was
[1:06:54] once at tot and God took his thought and
[1:07:00] he expressed it in the heavens job never
[1:07:03] had a Bible
[1:07:05] no one ever had a Bible but they had the
[1:07:08] heavens that it could look to and they
[1:07:10] could see that there was the God and God
[1:07:17] sent prophets and stripes and the wrote
[1:07:19] this book and give it to our we treated
[1:07:21] in a way our formal status to be
[1:07:24] becoming better than the Bible that's a
[1:07:28] shame if you treat your Bible that way
[1:07:33] praise the Lord
[1:07:36] my brother told me one time he was
[1:07:38] trying to read from his phone and
[1:07:40] because the phone freezes something from

[1:07:56] you wash out it can never take the place
[1:07:59] of God sacré Bible well let me tell you

[1:39:51] might be sure that we are ready for him
[1:39:53] and we are the one holding is coming let
[1:39:56] me tell you this one to you know it can
[1:40:00] never lose any of us and not we have
[1:40:04] complete you will not come here problem
[1:40:18] said we know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:40:21] same yesterday today and forever
[1:40:24] I was it God does not change and we
[1:40:28] believe that whatever is that is t2d
[1:40:33] it's not real it's not for it's only
[1:40:37] changing is metaphors or try our
[1:40:41] attribute or the way you want to use the
[1:40:46] same that that came I met Abraham I said
[1:40:51] by the time of my life and come to meet
[1:40:54] you and you who decide the child you
[1:40:58] have been waiting for for 25 years is
[1:41:02] the same that come again today in our
[1:41:05] own day the love of William Branham
[1:41:07] Graham said I am packing the minister of
[1:41:10] mercies Elijah and Jesus Christ together
[1:41:14] whose ministry yonder think in an award
[1:41:21] anything you have seen that it is also
[1:41:24] given to you today
[1:41:27] press the Lord Jesus don't you like to
[1:41:30] tap it go that doesn't change whatever I

[1:41:37] message is even today this morning or
[1:41:40] this afternoon you call them on the
[1:41:42] scene if we do the same thing so why I
[1:41:45] say that is the greatest exploitation
[1:41:48] well I say if calm where we'll be if he
[1:41:55] does not come then we are all liars and
[1:41:59] Paul was telling us he said if you have
[1:42:02] no the source of death then our what we
[1:42:06] thank God is nothing because God says so
[1:42:10] that is the backbone of every Tuesday
[1:42:15] when you stand on something that God
[1:42:18] said is not your world
[1:42:20] God always back up his word God prove
[1:42:24] his word if we say I will raise a church
[1:42:27] without spot without wrinkle it doesn't
[1:42:30] need anybody support he says who we
[1:42:34] reach god bless you I said god bless you

[1:43:24] blessing for us and that would be an
[1:43:27] economy tour to serve him more than ever

[1:55:18] Lord let what the give us I mean our
[1:55:21] same am I in the wait am I the church
[1:55:26] because Christ is coming to rapture
[1:55:29] Christ Christ is the word so bright is
[1:55:40] also you know Adam to Los said this is
[1:55:48] the bone of my bone the flesh of my
[1:55:52] flesh we shall call her word woman

[1:56:08] pose nothing short of Christ will go

[1:56:19] Word of God is our own life we add word
[1:56:23] manifested for today if you are certain
[1:56:26] of that you go nowhere Raptor is for the
[1:56:33] Christ in candidate today and noticed a
[1:56:38] shot of that problem said because if
[1:56:40] your love was all that God is deployed
[1:56:44] to who
[1:56:45] Christ George and other Christ is we had
[1:56:50] to deploy so that when Jesus was to be
[1:57:01] born so like we don't make the same
[1:57:02] mistake every of those priests and
[1:57:05] support is oh it's a baggie shall
[1:57:08] conceive every variety every time they
[1:57:10] go to tie block or to taboo or temple
[1:57:13] they will read about it maybe they say
[1:57:16] oh we jump wait that's a discipleship
[1:57:19] okay oh it would be this one it will be
[1:57:23] this one all the when Jesus came
[1:57:26] no room for him to the see the very
[1:57:31] person they are reading about and they
[1:57:34] are talking about came all of them music
[1:57:36] without no operation it like okay
[1:57:41] leverage if you was for example when did
[1:57:44] they break this morning I already know
[1:57:47] that the time I didn't break any noise
[1:57:52] charge I want total response that well
[1:57:55] Sunday today's Sunday morning when it
[1:57:57] was written on every wes is rocking it's
[1:58:01] not is it's daybreak not a great in
[1:58:04] church why don't we know what doesn't
[1:58:10] need to make any money for anything
[1:58:12] great restart make noise it's empty
[1:58:17] ballad I make the most noise
[1:58:20] so don't think that oh these great gods
[1:58:26] only communities and that is why we even
[1:58:31] now if the last one is coming finish and
[1:58:36] you do know when you come and touch my
[1:58:38] view should be examine yourself day and
[1:58:40] night don't leave because you go to
[1:58:43] church know is a matter of your life how
[1:58:47] you summoned him day and night
[1:58:50] what are you what what are you are
[1:58:52] threatened if we are starting go to come
[1:58:55] where will you welcome to meet you we
[1:58:59] got help apron oppose help us lord
[1:59:02] I know yeah we are Bible believers we
[1:59:06] are message believer that I don't bother
[1:59:08] us to Co so many I have too many here
[1:59:11] but I've just read a little few problem
[1:59:15] with the message the second coming of
[1:59:17] the Lord say please note God does not
[1:59:22] change God can not grow in wisdom I want
[1:59:27] to say at will vary with me witness with
[1:59:30] your Amen if I'm telling you the truth
[1:59:34] see and if you want to go through it you
[1:59:36] can just get fifty nine through five
[1:59:40] through eight the expectation said God
[1:59:46] does not change God cannot grow in
[1:59:49] wisdom the first was that eases most
[1:59:54] witty last was also you and I and and II
[2:00:00] in our awareness each generation get
[2:00:04] just a little wiser as our telling us
[2:00:07] than the previous generation because it
[2:00:11] is taught in the word of God that we
[2:00:14] should be weaker and wiser that is what
[2:00:17] is happening a lot of us now if I say
[2:00:20] okay let us stretch a little elect like
[2:00:23] 10 with us everybody say no why we can
[2:00:30] but at some of
[2:00:32] we have come from we can track in my it
[2:00:35] doesn't stop us god help us because of
[2:00:41] the each we are getting weaker and
[2:00:44] getting wiser that's right you can say
[2:00:46] well - boy now when they take our smash
[2:00:50] pool now what you don't do indeed they
[2:00:53] have no need we got help us god help us
[2:00:58] and the Bible said it before the science
[2:01:01] will increase so when if one bring it is
[2:01:07] that if all those things that he said is
[2:01:10] fulfilling why will not come why do you
[2:01:14] have just not sure why we're not sure of
[2:01:16] the wedding feast
[2:01:19] praise the Lord and as I told you the
[2:01:23] coming of the Lord
[2:01:24] who's the destruction of this world
[2:01:26] Bible say when you come yeah it will be
[2:01:31] only to section in the world you want
[2:01:33] you believe us and others let me put
[2:01:36] that we believe us and others that's why
[2:01:40] I say don't perceive God really since
[2:01:42] like criminal orders but once it were
[2:01:46] the orders seen us I'm oblivious ain't I
[2:01:52] will send you during the calyx Tom
[2:01:55] somebody will die before they go to
[2:01:57] purgatory discipline people collecting
[2:01:59] money from them they think that it was
[2:02:01] instead forget about that you are doing
[2:02:03] listen here if you I said now you'll be
[2:02:07] seen forever you cannot nobody will die
[2:02:10] Cena and this obviously isn't the weight
[2:02:13] realized so asleep oh that is group my
[2:02:18] brother
[2:02:19] Alleluia does Alateen pop apart I
[2:02:23] remember very well 99 the previous poo

[2:04:52] doing Augustin in vain there's a lot of
[2:04:55] blessing ahead of you and me I'm with
[2:04:58] not pastor
[2:04:59] that says ooh or anybody it is ghost
[2:05:02] world and he said even before Jesus said
[2:05:06] I am going there to prepare what it
[2:05:09] please for you ever each one also I
[2:05:12] won't tell you which is austere loss
[2:05:14] life God's children with Jesus tell us
[2:05:18] life even my little know that like and
[2:05:21] this is Jesus from generous revelation
[2:05:24] is Jesus Christ every of his world is ye
[2:05:29] and even God blesses so I said God
[2:05:33] doesn't change whatever Isis is he sees
[2:05:36] whatever I mean is it what mean I'm
[2:05:39] Robin was ten rows in another message
[2:05:41] second coming of the Lord fifty-seven
[2:05:44] self was seventeen said now we are
[2:05:50] living at a terrible time I said all
[2:05:56] world is living to their type then
[2:05:59] Christian was delivering to our own type
[2:06:02] say look at it right from the Old
[2:06:06] Testament there are many many times
[2:06:09] pictures in Old Testament pertaining to
[2:06:12] the second coming of Christ is so much
[2:06:15] more than even the best coming the world
[2:06:19] up coming coming second one is small in
[2:06:23] this Bible that even is first coming why
[2:06:26] because the second coming means more to
[2:06:30] us human race than the first one
[2:06:33] amen you know the first one is to call
[2:06:37] and die and resurrect for us but this
[2:06:41] second coming is so great I'm so
[2:06:46] important that even from Genesis you
[2:06:48] have been talkin abou second coming but
[2:06:51] people hated in fact no touch again the
[2:06:55] domination the kaabah second coming all
[2:06:57] the one is prosperity prosperity and
[2:07:01] that is why the Bible tell don't look at
[2:07:03] that
[2:07:03] let them prosper all will be had here
[2:07:06] that's why province a look at our Lord
[2:07:10] when the disciples were pointing to him
[2:07:13] of the big temple that I told us say all
[2:07:17] these things you don't put your mind in
[2:07:20] that it will become grand and today I
[2:07:25] told you if you had a body good yet you
[2:07:27] go and check ask all the temple that
[2:07:30] I've abused or become nothing right now
[2:07:32] to most I stand in there was it why
[2:07:40] everybody you say what I tried disciple
[2:07:43] that I was at the sawdust temple that
[2:07:45] who breathing was breed there's no place
[2:07:49] for any mater shocking or any no no no
[2:07:53] Hama is the only house can be built
[2:07:56] without ya know Hama Rousseau so in so
[2:08:00] magnificent so big but is I said don't
[2:08:03] look at that I am today you cannot even
[2:08:07] see anything the foundation yeah so
[2:08:10] don't put your mind on anything
[2:08:12] kana or physical we are going to get
[2:08:16] better battle and it's already promised
[2:08:19] for you and me whatever you do Xavier is
[2:08:21] nothing God already owed imitating for
[2:08:26] us but I said why is this great coming
[2:08:32] of the law was so important - the Bible
[2:08:35] DT today is because is all so many
[2:08:40] things for us as his whole problem for
[2:08:43] the world was blessing for the believers
[2:08:47] amen
[2:08:49] the Lord coming is for some people to
[2:08:55] come and receive you will receive from
[2:08:57] people himself then is coming to condemn
[2:09:01] the world so it's coming so important
[2:09:05] and so great that he as we repeating and
[2:09:09] the according in the Bible everywhere
[2:09:12] you go why it calls to the people and a
[2:09:15] blessing to the believers
[2:09:17] amen a being such a I said I mean that
[2:09:23] this is a sort of I taught in
[2:09:27] think everyone of us I saw hundreds of
[2:09:31] God was walk and look solemnly take time
[2:09:36] to take an infinity of our life whether
[2:09:40] we are waiting for him whether we is
[2:09:43] coming with Gladys you I will cost you
[2:09:46] but I know as long as I believed in word
[2:09:50] of life repaired baptized in his name
[2:09:53] prematurely goes is too much
[2:09:55] contamination there's no more
[2:09:57] contamination for the other waters
[2:09:59] already in Christ Jesus I know you
[2:10:03] cannot go on will let go on to any wrong
[2:10:05] because you know it is wrong press the
[2:10:12] Lord so it's not I'm not talking of a
[2:10:14] mini or anything
[2:10:15] but I'm telling you the truth a child of
[2:10:19] God
[2:10:19] we're not going Willie something wrong
[2:10:22] by mistake but God asked already before
[2:10:27] fish on for that the blood of Joe Christ
[2:10:29] is for us you go help us somebody came
[2:10:36] and died for you and for me then you
[2:10:39] will not lose you it's not possible now
[2:10:43] I'm not only that before I become
[2:10:47] requirement think of vanity at all yes
[2:10:50] thought of you and me so anything that's
[2:10:53] why I said none of this kind lost is not
[2:10:56] possible
[2:10:57] like we know alley ideology level so
[2:11:01] salt lost the first King of history once
[2:11:06] he lost we by buried us soul is very di
[2:11:10] Impala dies now one of these days where
[2:11:13] we all die will see him instead of going
[2:11:18] to hell what happened to him
[2:11:20] the Bible says is this was caught shot
[2:11:24] same day this in and Sun goes a
[2:11:28] societies if you decided that you want
[2:11:31] to go wrong way God is more than abou we

[2:12:14] heritage of soul when you read these

[2:12:21] let them give you check what did I give
[2:12:24] to God why does he love me like this
[2:12:26] that is what we do see style you go just
[2:12:34] some problem said I met the young man in
[2:12:37] California said you put here I am a fool
[2:12:40] for Christ and then who school are you
[2:12:43] see every one of us on hot here we might
[2:12:46] be a fool for somebody like me I am a
[2:12:49] fool for Christ I am proud to be a fool
[2:12:51] for him why all that you know the awful
[2:12:54] force it on I will wake up I lit the
[2:12:56] money and we are going to defeat riding
[2:12:59] one like that salty if we blew something
[2:13:02] what does it mean what does it agree was
[2:13:07] something genu we are talking of
[2:13:09] yourself heaven like bringing good that
[2:13:17] no important give me for free the Lord
[2:13:21] bless you but once it is so importance
[2:13:24] at least every crystal Janka all must
[2:13:28] check our take it's time for us to take
[2:13:31] our infantry because is coming is so
[2:13:35] imminent so we have you seen it and the
[2:13:38] Bible said it was all who is is coming
[2:13:40] it had been said that is when it will
[2:13:43] come because people have forgotten about
[2:13:46] it now the dust will arrive - cumbria
[2:13:49] and live when you have no we come here
[2:13:52] to display
[2:13:53] him and go back to him and then it would
[2:13:56] bring us back here to come and enjoy
[2:13:58] when all this thing not be here
[2:14:02] he got happy applause I pray to help us
[2:14:05] but I say if you know our distance is to
[2:14:09] truly treat our hearts I make all scream
[2:14:13] several time because we can remember
[2:14:15] said the preview of it was shown to John
[2:14:18] the Revelator on the partners of ice as
[2:14:22] a fast was at my place as my personal
[2:14:24] maybe as I speak to this a thing if I
[2:14:27] come here brother when he saw it he saw
[2:14:30] the blessing ahead and what is to be God
[2:14:34] before this old world then you say calm
[2:14:38] Lord Jesus it's like don't want him to
[2:14:40] be coming down I know but you cannot
[2:14:43] come then because it's got to wait for
[2:14:45] you and me you shall be important those
[2:14:49] people the Bible said they are not
[2:14:51] complete on you and me come there we are
[2:14:55] so important to God we got happy front
[2:14:58] of us so he said if shortly lead is at
[2:15:01] and was screaming oh it was so low come
[2:15:06] Jesus it says so also today when we hear
[2:15:10] a reminders of the coming of the Lord
[2:15:12] used to treat our heart it may cause joy
[2:15:15] happy and scream hi and he said Lord I'm
[2:15:20] also expecting you but as I know many
[2:15:23] would not respect him wherever you think
[2:15:25] your life is known I'd say but let me
[2:15:27] tell you whether you aspect or not is
[2:15:30] coming now so what you have to do is
[2:15:32] line up with him because it's not it's
[2:15:36] not going to less stand up for anybody
[2:15:38] is God not starting with that is
[2:15:42] Almighty
[2:15:43] whatever he says that it is finance
[2:15:45] right many times when we pray and we
[2:15:48] would think that girl calm down go who
[2:15:50] now calm down
[2:15:51] is you you lifted up to him when you get
[2:15:54] you standard we got a purpose god bless
[2:15:59] you church praise the Lord as I told you
[2:16:04] when your time we would think of this
[2:16:07] without you still that is good but one
[2:16:09] say anything God said let's settle your
[2:16:12] man is year and Eamon
[2:16:15] nothing can change it no addition no
[2:16:19] suppression that is why it doesn't need
[2:16:22] anybody's idea
[2:16:24] it doesn't need you open you whatever I
[2:16:27] want to say whatever I want to do yeah I
[2:16:30] said it
[2:16:30] you may believe you don't believe it
[2:16:32] does I but that is why don't people must
[2:16:35] believe it you have to believe it
[2:16:38] because like swoon let's take a little
[2:16:40] trip back to no more time do you know
[2:16:42] that people who are seen animals
[2:16:45] entering the ark turns if move them
[2:16:52] anima in fact say basically you just
[2:16:55] Maggie how is knee how many time how
[2:17:00] many times was he taken to enter the ark
[2:17:02] before loving it is today that is one
[2:17:12] day they will see they will look for you
[2:17:14] do for me they don't see again oh maybe
[2:17:16] they have gone to that yeah search if
[2:17:23] this all with the same God doesn't
[2:17:27] change it does it it doesn't need to you
[2:17:31] have no obligation to suppress it that's
[2:17:35] why I say you cannot teach Kings I cede
[2:17:37] revelation revelation belong to you and
[2:17:40] me but I see
[2:17:43] but the Bible calls to the beginning but
[2:17:47] revelation take off before the beginning
[2:17:49] and after the end first the Lord just
[2:17:56] won't like that as I'm dropping it to
[2:17:57] you keep it in your heart if you do you
[2:18:00] good
[2:18:01] what are we to do why was it go like
[2:18:04] that we read now I'm closing now that
[2:18:07] woman was it you know in their own time

[2:18:26] like that he has 10 tablets was much

[2:38:43] seek after career work in your career to
[2:38:51] achieve things that you want
[2:38:55] when a person getting here 25 he says
[2:39:02] there they have seen everything you have

[2:39:24] greatest expectation because that is
[2:39:25] expectation any expectation of meaning

[2:39:37] disposition is completely different from
[2:39:39] the air the air age the new the neighbor

[2:40:16] days we see it all over the place
[2:40:20] but I'll tell you this morning change
[2:40:23] that is the only hope that is left for
[2:40:27] this world the coming of the Lord that's
[2:40:31] the only hope that is left for this
[2:40:34] world and it's now something that is
[2:40:36] coming is here I can prove it to you
[2:40:39] from the scripture that is here it's
[2:40:42] already here I'll give you a quick speed
[2:40:46] in your Bible Revelation chapter 2 verse
[2:40:48] 5 a very quick speed in your Bible
[2:40:55] he said behold I come quickly that was
[2:40:59] to the efficient church age
[2:41:03] Revelation chapter 2 verse 5 Revelation
[2:41:07] chapter 2 verse 11 he repeated again he
[2:41:11] said behold I come quickly that was to
[2:41:15] the next church 8 the seminole church
[2:41:17] age Revelation chapter 2 verse 20 25 he
[2:41:23] repeated again
[2:41:24] still talking about him coming amen
[2:41:29] [Music]
[2:41:37] Revelation chapter 2 verse 25 he
[2:41:40] repeated to five he says I come quickly
[2:41:45] least a cut of your candlestick to verse
[2:41:48] 11 he says he he repeated again to the
[2:41:52] seminal church age
[2:41:54] [Music]
[2:41:58] to verse 25 he speaks again to the
[2:42:02] charity right church age he says but at
[2:42:08] wish you have already hold hold fast
[2:42:12] till I can't till I come be who I come
[2:42:15] quickly to I come I'm still coming
[2:42:19] then chapter 3 verse 3 remember
[2:42:23] therefore how there has received and
[2:42:26] heard hold fast and repent and in
[2:42:30] therefore there shall now watch I will
[2:42:33] come I will come he's dead and now
[2:42:35] seeing I would come chapter 3 verse 11
[2:42:39] to the next church age that the
[2:42:42] Philadelphia Church in he said behold I
[2:42:44] come quickly but when it came to the
[2:42:47] Lord in church age which historian and
[2:42:51] biblical scholars have proven that this
[2:42:53] is the age that we live in Revelation
[2:42:58] chapter 3 verse 20 he said behold a span
[2:43:03] now that I'm coming but behold as Pan Am
[2:43:07] and I said Austin he has already arrived
[2:43:13] he kept a now CBO account
[2:43:16] pijo account because the religious world
[2:43:19] has this picture that will see injures
[2:43:21] in the heaven that's the reason why the
[2:43:24] preacher said when a dear brick today
[2:43:26] today didn't make a sound didn't make us
[2:43:31] I was there bound that go bomb is Sunday
[2:43:37] you slap and enter into Sunday you never
[2:43:40] even knew how Saturday passed and so
[2:43:41] they came and you just woke up yet it
[2:43:44] was Sunday
[2:43:46] he kept announcing through the church
[2:43:49] ages before I come I come quickly
[2:43:52] I come quickly but true the ministry of
[2:43:55] mark I fall he said behold I stand at
[2:43:59] the door and knock it's no time to play
[2:44:06] Church if you want to that's your
[2:44:09] business
[2:44:09] [Music]
[2:44:18] the church used to be one of the most
[2:44:21] serious bliss in the world but now
[2:44:24] church is one of the more dangerous
[2:44:25] place because you have people coming
[2:44:28] sitting right in the church dealing with
[2:44:31] things in their lives
[2:44:33] [Music]
[2:44:36] dealing with things in their lives what
[2:44:40] are we making this girl to be
[2:44:43] who is he to you oh but he's the same
[2:44:48] yesterday today and forever this rapture
[2:44:53] is not a fairy tale
[2:44:54] it's right before our eyes it's
[2:45:00] affecting our life it's changing our
[2:45:03] habits
[2:45:04] [Music]
[2:45:11] where the preacher has already preached
[2:45:14] praise the Lord
[2:45:17] but I just want to encourage you we are
[2:45:22] living in rapture in days don't look for
[2:45:23] it coming is already here it's already
[2:45:28] here don't look for it coming this is
[2:45:33] Jesus own words behold I stand at the
[2:45:37] door and knock
[2:45:39] and where'd or is he standing now is
[2:45:42] knocking at your heart knocking at your
[2:45:45] hot dog trying to show himself to you
[2:45:49] more than the church came more than the
[2:45:52] pastor came he want a personal
[2:45:54] relationship with you
[2:45:57] [Music]
[2:46:01] you
[2:46:02] [Music]
[2:46:04] what Allah bless you it was good to have
[2:46:07] a trilogy playing the saxophone you know
[2:46:11] for being almost 2 years now I have been
[2:46:15] looking for a teacher that can teach
[2:46:17] Wayne instrument which is Sansa phone
[2:46:20] trumpet and or death in a phone one
[2:46:24] young gentleman very good that can teach
[2:46:27] Wayne instrument so I talked to him and
[2:46:30] all of that and but I've been kind of
[2:46:37] waiting for the appropriate time and
[2:46:40] then Jimmy to come alone and he tells me
[2:46:45] Nicky here he's been learning the salsa
[2:46:47] phone then his brother come and tell me
[2:46:49] he can play the trombone I said well I
[2:46:51] got a bad one
[2:46:54] praise the Lord I said God is going to
[2:46:57] fulfill my my desire and a couple of
[2:47:02] weeks ago brother
[2:47:03] Ariel spoke to me and talking about some
[2:47:07] projects and singers and I like I said
[2:47:10] this before maybe a few couple of years
[2:47:13] back we announced it and but the way we
[2:47:17] announce it it was almost looking like a
[2:47:20] law you know because we want people
[2:47:23] singing specials to practice with a
[2:47:26] musician the reason is because you have
[2:47:31] this young man sitting on the base you
[2:47:33] have this brother on the piano and you
[2:47:35] get a sister's there on the violin and
[2:47:37] then you come and sing a song and they
[2:47:40] can support you
[2:47:41] [Music]
[2:47:42] because even if the know the song
[2:47:47] they are they had to follow your your
[2:47:50] way of singing to be able to put music
[2:47:53] to the Sun so it was now like it's
[2:47:57] something that you forced to do but it's
[2:47:59] something that is right to do
[2:48:01] [Music]
[2:48:04] because if he's trying to put music to
[2:48:07] your song and why you are singing some
[2:48:10] time before he find the music you are
[2:48:11] already done singing
[2:48:13] [Music]
[2:48:16] now in your mind you are thinking
[2:48:18] because they are musicians that you know
[2:48:20] the minister's not playing right away
[2:48:22] they don't work like that it don't work
[2:48:27] like that and that is the reason why
[2:48:33] we're trying to introduce practice and
[2:48:37] for those that would love to sing come
[2:48:40] around
[2:48:43] it's not about you you must realize we
[2:48:46] said that Wednesday night it's not about
[2:48:48] you it's about him so if you get in your
[2:48:53] mind my son is a special special to you
[2:48:56] not to him you are coming to praise Him
[2:49:04] and just like he gave you the gift to
[2:49:07] sing he also gave them to give to play
[2:49:09] instrument so why if we bring all of our
[2:49:12] gifts together to glorify Him won't that
[2:49:15] be a beautiful now so since I have
[2:49:23] somebody that is learning the trombone
[2:49:25] and somebody that is learning the
[2:49:29] saxophone I'm going to engage my teacher
[2:49:33] we got myself I'm part of it too I'm
[2:49:35] learning out maybe I play the trumpet or
[2:49:37] the flu but the reason is the other we
[2:49:44] we won't to get our young people
[2:49:46] involved amen
[2:49:49] we want to get them involved the young
[2:49:53] people they follow their parents they
[2:49:55] love the Lord that comes to church
[2:49:57] sometimes it's hard for them to follow
[2:50:01] what the preacher is preaching so for a
[2:50:05] period of time they might just be in
[2:50:07] church and just feel like they're not
[2:50:08] involved Church just look bow to them
[2:50:12] but if they can come and sing a song
[2:50:15] whether it's a small singing group or
[2:50:17] whether they're playing an instrument
[2:50:19] and let me tell you I'm going to put a
[2:50:21] lot of discipline to it if you can't
[2:50:23] come on time stare to your house
[2:50:27] there is no special player on the team
[2:50:31] if you were not about by our rules state
[2:50:34] just stay by yourself
[2:50:36] [Music]
[2:50:39] so if you want to be part you better
[2:50:41] think about it
[2:50:45] and I told area the same I said when you
[2:50:48] doing music practice put some discipline
[2:50:50] to it
[2:50:52] [Music]
[2:50:56] because this is the King's business we
[2:51:01] don't make look there is no special
[2:51:02] person in this house the only special
[2:51:05] man is our Lord Jesus Christ nobody is
[2:51:09] above this word
[2:51:16] so he might be getting your numbers to
[2:51:19] put you on different schedules that he
[2:51:22] will be working with whatever he want to
[2:51:23] do he has the burden for reading and so
[2:51:26] I just pray that girl who bless him
[2:51:28] I'm not going to order him what he's
[2:51:30] going to do but those that are out of
[2:51:33] you young people that are interested in
[2:51:35] in wind instrument trumpet everything
[2:51:38] you talk to Timothy
[2:51:41] you'll make a team we work on the day I
[2:51:45] will talk to the teacher and I will get
[2:51:47] him down here and he can be able to work
[2:51:49] with you people whether it is one time
[2:51:51] in the month or twice in a month you'll
[2:51:53] be able to work for you people so we can
[2:51:54] put ourself together how to try to play
[2:51:59] the trombone to my house I just taught
[2:52:02] when he plays and he might blow this
[2:52:04] wall out and that is the way we might
[2:52:08] get a bigger Church
[2:52:10] how did that Jericho wall came down and
[2:52:14] we buy the trumpet and I prayed to God
[2:52:20] for the bigger Church and whichever way
[2:52:22] he's going to do it I'm ready to take it
[2:52:24] amen if we start worshiping and the roof
[2:52:28] fall out glory be to God I know that
[2:52:31] he's the one that we worship in he got
[2:52:33] to bring especially in this cold season
[2:52:35] it is war fall down you got to do
[2:52:37] something quickly
[2:52:38] [Music]
[2:52:42] well it just it just goodies just to
[2:52:45] encourage you people young people praise
[2:52:47] the Lord
[2:52:48] you get better area number and you want
[2:52:50] to sing a special send him a text and
[2:52:52] say brother I want to sing this song now
[2:52:56] they make him to look at the soul he has
[2:52:58] the other musicians number he can send
[2:53:01] them text or let's practice this song go
[2:53:03] on YouTube listening to the song we have
[2:53:05] to do things all the way we are
[2:53:07] worshipping God and God love order
[2:53:13] when we try our best it puts smile on
[2:53:16] his face it's not one person and the
[2:53:21] other person maybe they are oppressing
