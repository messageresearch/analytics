[49:09] Brandon used to close their tip close
[49:11] that message this morning just want to
[49:14] do a review on
[49:16] something and
[49:19] uh uh I catch catch up with there before

[49:27] had a privilege to to listen to the tape
[49:30] uh why it was playing uh you listen to
[49:33] it privately uh but uh there there are
[49:37] some few reason why we we ask that we we
[49:40] play there for the Sunday school so let
[49:42] me just go over some few things as he
[49:45] close the
[49:47] the the
[49:49] message so uh if we can uh ask I will
[49:54] take people to just put up that one quot
[49:57] I think that was one of the last thing
[49:58] he
[49:59] said uh it caught my mind and uh I just
[50:04] want to go over some few things
[50:08] yeah the beginning and the ending of the
[50:10] Gentile
[50:11] dispensation he says uh at that time
[50:15] he's uh reading from uh uh he's reading
[50:20] from
[50:21] uh um
[50:24] Daniel so there is something there I
[50:27] want for us to see let's go to Daniel
[50:28] chapter
[50:32] 12 let's go to Daniel chapter
[50:42] 12 there parallel something that
[50:47] uh I want us look at Daniel chapter
[50:54] 12
[51:01] praise the
[51:03] Lord now when he when he he he quoted
[51:06] that that was Daniel 12:1 at that time
[51:10] shall Mel stand up the great
[51:13] Prince which standeth for the children
[51:16] of thy
[51:18] people and uh uh thy people speaking to
[51:22] Daniel which is Daniel people and uh and
[51:25] there shall be a time of trouble
[51:30] such as never was since there was a
[51:35] nation even to the same time and at that
[51:39] time that people shall be delivered
[51:42] every one of them there shall be found
[51:45] written in the book praise the Lord so
[51:50] at that time Michel shall stand up now
[51:53] so let's go back to that quote
[51:56] and uh
[52:01] uh he says at that time reading from
[52:05] beginning end of gentle dispensation at
[52:07] that time Michael shall stand the great
[52:10] Prince now Michael was Christ of
[52:15] course who fought the Angelic war in
[52:20] heaven with the devil Satan and Michael
[52:24] fought
[52:26] together uh uh uh Isaiah chapter 14
[52:30] tells us that and then also Jude in the
[52:34] book of Jude just before the The Book of
[52:36] Revelation Jude tell told us also that
[52:40] Mel fought for the body of
[52:43] Moses now here Daniel is uh is uh seeing
[52:48] uh in his in his vision uh uh uh here
[52:53] he's he's testifying once once again
[52:56] Michel will stand for his people which
[53:00] of course the the his people in the
[53:03] definite sense is the Jews in the
[53:06] general sense is the redeemed praise the
[53:10] Lord are we
[53:13] together and uh so uh M was Christ who
[53:17] fought the Angelic war in heaven the
[53:20] devil Satan and Michel fought together
[53:22] so fought against each other and at that
[53:26] day Michael shall stand for the
[53:29] people he end standing for the Nations
[53:33] he's standing for the people and many of
[53:36] those that sleep in the dust of the
[53:39] Earth shall shall rise to Everlasting
[53:42] shame and contempt and those that be
[53:46] wise and turn many to righteousness
[53:49] shall shine as the Stars forever and
[53:53] ever now back again to
[53:55] uh Daniel chapter 12 I want to look at
[53:59] something that looks very familiar very
[54:03] familiar and uh uh uh let's look at that
[54:06] together Daniel chapter 12 back let's
[54:09] look at verse 4 let's look at Daniel
[54:12] chapter 12
[54:16] verse4 praise the
[54:18] Lord and thou oh Daniel shut up the
[54:23] words and seal the
[54:26] even to the time of their
[54:30] end many shall run to and forth
[54:34] knowledge shall
[54:35] increase praise the
[54:38] Lord now I say it sound very familiar
[54:41] because if you read Revelation chap 10
[54:45] verse 4 this is Daniel chapter 10 verse
[54:49] 4 we have just read you read Revelation
[54:52] chap 10
[54:54] verse4
[54:58] you hear the same
[55:01] thing verse four says and
[55:05] uh and when the seven tunders have
[55:07] altered their voices I was about to
[55:10] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[55:14] saying unto me seal up those things
[55:17] which the seven tunder alter and write
[55:20] them
[55:22] net praise the Lord now so uh uh
[55:29] uh here in Daniel chapter 4 Daniel I
[55:33] mean chapter 12:4 Daniel is told to shut
[55:36] up the book is the same word that is
[55:39] used in Revelation seal those things
[55:42] shut up the book seal those things uh is
[55:46] the same thing now so what the parallel
[55:49] that I want us to see here is that is
[55:52] for us to understand what is is taking
[55:55] place here in in the Book of Daniel we
[55:58] realize that uh uh uh we we we talk
[56:03] about the image that was given to
[56:05] Nebuchadnezzar in his dream that Daniel
[56:07] had to interpret and that and and that
[56:10] image represent the Gentile kingdoms but
[56:13] then God is also giving to Daniel uh uh
[56:17] a Sevenfold
[56:19] purpose okay he giv to Daniel uh uh uh
[56:24] also the Myster of the Jews
[56:29] Redemption so he's revealing things to
[56:31] Daniel and he's telling Daniel shut up
[56:34] those things seal them for the time of
[56:36] the
[56:37] end praise the Lord there is another
[56:40] thing that comes very familiar also uh
[56:45] uh in the Book of
[56:53] Daniel
[57:01] we look at the ceiling of the book and
[57:10] uh let's let's continue to read Daniel
[57:13] chapter 12 let's get down to verse
[57:16] 7 now to take uh uh Mar of the time just
[57:22] to be able to highlight some few things
[57:24] here and I heard a man clothed in
[57:27] leaning which which was upon the the the
[57:30] Waters of the river when he held up his
[57:36] hands he held up his right hand and his
[57:39] left hand unto heaven and swore by him
[57:43] that liveth
[57:44] forever that it shall be for a time
[57:50] times and and
[57:53] half time
[57:55] 1 *
[57:58] 2 and a half 3 and A2
[58:02] years the three and a half years that is
[58:04] left for the Jews that's where that's
[58:07] where that brother brandham took that
[58:08] from time one times which mean two now
[58:13] one two but one one one and a half so
[58:18] three and a half years so but but just
[58:21] just watch what I want to show you yeah
[58:22] I'm not going into that uh uh uh I'm
[58:26] showing you yet that this Angel he lift
[58:29] up his right hand and his left hand onto
[58:31] heaven and he sore by him that liveth
[58:35] forever that it shall be for a time one
[58:38] year times two years so 1 + 2 3 and and
[58:43] half and when he shall have accomplished
[58:48] to settle the power of the Holy people
[58:51] all these things shall be finished back
[58:53] to revelation
[58:57] Revelation chap 10 and then when you go
[59:00] over to uh
[59:02] uh uh we read verse
[59:07] [Music]
[59:11] four verse five verse five and the angel
[59:15] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[59:18] the Earth lifted up his hands to heaven
[59:20] and he swore by himself forever and ever
[59:23] I mean he swore
[59:25] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[59:28] created the heavens and the things that
[59:30] are dead in the earth and the
[59:35] things okay they have it up there and
[59:37] the things there therein are and the see
[59:41] and the things which are therein that
[59:45] there shall be time no
[59:51] longer are you seeing the similarity
[59:53] here
[59:55] praise the Lord amen are you seeing the
[59:59] similarity now down here there are
[1:00:03] things that are revealed to Daniel and
[1:00:06] the angels tell him shut the book these
[1:00:09] things are kept for the end they will be
[1:00:11] revealed in the end praise the Lord and
[1:00:15] I said the angels are revealing things
[1:00:18] also to John on the island of pmos and
[1:00:22] he tell John see the
[1:00:26] book since I'm I'm I'm I'm showing to
[1:00:29] you see the book write them there at in
[1:00:32] in the beginning in Revelation chapter
[1:00:35] one he told John right in Revelation
[1:00:38] chapter 10 he says write this one
[1:00:41] that I I I I don't want to get into that
[1:00:44] but the the the the the similari is the
[1:00:46] parallel there's a parallel here I want
[1:00:48] to show you is that Daniel was told to
[1:00:52] shut the book John was told to sh shut
[1:00:54] the book Daniel was first told to write
[1:00:56] the vision John was told to write the
[1:00:59] vision now Daniel is told to shut the
[1:01:02] book John is told also to shut the
[1:01:05] book but
[1:01:07] Daniel is having an
[1:01:11] angel that identified himself as
[1:01:14] Michael praise the Lord amen in
[1:01:19] Revelation chapter 10 John is having an
[1:01:22] angel that is called the mighty
[1:01:27] Angel sir they are not too different
[1:01:30] they are the
[1:01:32] same amen Christ delivering the Jews
[1:01:36] Christ delivering the
[1:01:40] Gentiles are we together praise the
[1:01:45] Lord now I will tell you why I'm going
[1:01:47] over these things what I'm taking my
[1:01:49] time to pick up these things bid in
[1:01:52] pieces because this is our our message
[1:01:56] yes what we call the message of the hour
[1:01:59] is not dress Cod
[1:02:01] no is the mystress of God revealed am
[1:02:06] praise the Lord

[1:02:16] the uh to
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:21] okay help me now let me get my thought
[1:02:23] to the
[1:02:25] Jews to the Jews he's
[1:02:29] uh
[1:02:30] Michael the one that would deliver them
[1:02:33] you remember when uh when Gabriel was
[1:02:36] bringing
[1:02:37] Daniel request Daniel prayer the Prince
[1:02:41] of Persia with stood
[1:02:43] the
[1:02:45] amen came to his
[1:02:50] defense praise the
[1:02:53] Lord where we are where we are Church it
[1:02:57] is almost like we are on my
[1:03:00] camel and we are we are just like
[1:03:05] Gesa we are seeing the things that are

[1:03:30] standing for
[1:03:34] us he says Michel will stand for his
[1:03:40] people I'm only telling you there's an
[1:03:42] angel standing for you in this
[1:03:45] day

[1:05:34] Jews when he raised his hand to
[1:05:38] Heaven he said for a Time
[1:05:42] Time a time times and a half all these
[1:05:47] things will be
[1:05:50] accomplished for the Gentile when he

[1:06:48] amen so you can
[1:06:51] see the Plan of Redemption for the Jews
[1:06:55] was given to Daniel The Plan of
[1:06:58] Redemption for the Gentiles was given to
[1:07:03] the the the messenger of the seventh
[1:07:05] Church age but the mystery of of of the
[1:07:09] Plan of Redemption the mystery the
[1:07:12] entire mystery was supposed to be open
[1:07:15] in the last
[1:07:18] day God gave the plan to
[1:07:22] Daniel
[1:07:25] and that's where he has all of these uh
[1:07:27] uh uh uh uh uh uh things there in the in
[1:07:33] the in the Daniel 7th
[1:07:36] week praise the
[1:07:38] Lord so as I was listening to the
[1:07:41] message this morning uh as we were

[1:08:02] to cap this out maybe if you didn't pay
[1:08:05] attention to that then you can go back

[1:08:54] where we are you know we are doing our
[1:08:58] best to serve God but we are afraid
[1:09:01] because it looks like we don't have
[1:09:03] control of many things around

[1:09:12] Lord but that Prophet
[1:09:15] Elijah knew exactly where he was
[1:09:18] standing he knew where he was standing

[1:16:19] life praise the
[1:16:22] Lord
[1:16:24] now okay if we can do our our slide I
[1:16:28] think I still have this fancy thing in
[1:16:30] my
[1:16:31] hands praise the Lord they say I should
[1:16:34] be able to go back and forth with
[1:16:37] it okay maybe they're getting it ready
[1:16:40] back there for me okay did I did
[1:16:52] that body in what you have heard from
[1:16:54] the
[1:16:55] beginning that's
[1:16:57] uh okay
[1:17:05] good
[1:17:09] okay please I'm trying to learn how to
[1:17:11] use
[1:17:13] this okay let me show you something here
[1:17:17] also we want to look at this
[1:17:20] together James said who whosoever shall
[1:17:24] keep the the the whole
[1:17:27] Lord and yet offend in one point he is
[1:17:31] guilty of
[1:17:32] all I was thinking about that
[1:17:36] but uh I I find a good picture there
[1:17:41] something I was thinking about in my
[1:17:42] mind there was something that brought
[1:17:43] this whole thing to to to to mind and
[1:17:46] that's what I want to share with you and
[1:17:49] uh uh but if you look you see what James
[1:17:52] said here
[1:17:55] here how can I say it you you will see
[1:17:59] that uh
[1:18:00] James
[1:18:02] inspiration was also fulfilled in the
[1:18:05] life of the
[1:18:07] lawgiver watch this now in Exodus chap
[1:18:11] 32:
[1:18:13] 19 okay Moses is coming down from the
[1:18:17] mountain when he when he came down from
[1:18:20] the mountain he met the people
[1:18:23] worshiping an
[1:18:24] idol he fell offended and he broke the
[1:18:28] Ten
[1:18:30] Commandments James said whosoever shall
[1:18:35] keep the whole law Moses was holding the
[1:18:37] whole law The Ten Commandments he was
[1:18:39] keeping it bringing it to the
[1:18:42] people and yet of in one point when he
[1:18:47] got there he fell
[1:18:49] offended so he broke the whole Lord
[1:18:55] and you see in the
[1:18:57] picture in another sense James is
[1:19:02] referring to even the one that brought
[1:19:04] the
[1:19:06] Commandment in the Commandment it is
[1:19:09] said that do not worship any graving
[1:19:13] image Moses had that he was keeping the
[1:19:17] whole law the Ten Commandments in his
[1:19:20] hands praise the Lord when he got down
[1:19:23] to the
[1:19:25] mountain he found the people worshiping
[1:19:28] an
[1:19:30] idol he got offended at
[1:19:34] that and then he broke the Ten
[1:19:41] Commandments praise the Lord are you
[1:19:43] seeing the picture but what brought my
[1:19:46] mind today is now to teach you on the
[1:19:49] Ten Commandments I think you learned
[1:19:50] that in Sunday School
[1:19:53] but Moses the lawgiver he brought us Ten
[1:19:58] Commandments he brought us Ten
[1:20:01] Commandments and Jesus the prophet like
[1:20:06] unto
[1:20:08] Moses amen when he came down on Mount
[1:20:17] Olive he brought
[1:20:19] us 10 Beatitudes
[1:20:26] praise the Lord watch now when the Ten
[1:20:30] Commandments were given to the children
[1:20:31] of Israel we spoke about that uh uh it
[1:20:35] was it was the people saying to Moses
[1:20:38] all that the Lord said we will do so the
[1:20:42] desire
[1:20:43] Lord but when Jesus
[1:20:47] came he
[1:20:49] brought 10 Beatitudes that he gave to
[1:20:52] his disciple blessed uh the the the me
[1:20:56] blessed he gave them all all this all
[1:20:59] this
[1:21:00] blessed praise the Lord and uh uh if you
[1:21:05] if you if you watch
[1:21:07] it you realize that in another sense
[1:21:12] Jesus was telling
[1:21:15] them honor the law the word was given to
[1:21:20] you as a law as a
[1:21:25] burden but those very words that was
[1:21:28] given to you now I say unto you that was
[1:21:31] the very same time he said
[1:21:34] that you were told that an eye for an
[1:21:38] eye but now I say unto you whosoever hat
[1:21:43] a brother without a
[1:21:45] curse praise the Lord so Jesus now was
[1:21:49] trying to bring to us what Moses brought
[1:21:55] as a Lord with burden he's bringing it
[1:21:58] to us with a
[1:22:04] blessing praise the
[1:22:06] Lord
[1:22:08] amen there is not a burden it's a
[1:22:12] blessing blessed are the meek blessed
[1:22:15] are those that suffer persecution for my
[1:22:18] name's sake blessed are the poor in
[1:22:20] spirit blessed out of that
[1:22:23] but actually you will realize that if
[1:22:25] you go through Matthew Chapter 5 from uh
[1:22:29] verse 1 to 12 you're going to find only
[1:22:32] nine
[1:22:36] Beatitudes praise the Lord the 10th
[1:22:40] beatitude is in Matthew chapter 11 you
[1:22:44] remember brother Brandon preached the
[1:22:46] forgotten
[1:22:48] beatitude that was where Jesus told John
[1:22:52] blessed is he that is not offended in me
[1:22:56] that's
[1:22:58] right praise the Lord where are we going
[1:23:02] with
[1:23:05] this in
[1:23:08] Revelation last week we were talking
[1:23:10] about all the
[1:23:12] Sant that John saw in
[1:23:16] Revelation in Revelation John also saw
[1:23:20] seven
[1:23:21] Beatitudes
[1:23:25] John spoke about blessed is he that
[1:23:28] readeth and they that hear the word of
[1:23:31] this prophecy so there's a blessing in
[1:23:33] hearing the word or reading it so if you
[1:23:35] can read it please play in your
[1:23:38] car amen yes sir don't let the devil to
[1:23:42] R you of that
[1:23:43] blessing he speaks about blessed at the
[1:23:46] dead which died in the Lord henceforth
[1:23:50] amen why because because Paradise is no
[1:23:54] longer under the influence of the
[1:23:58] devil so blessed are they that die in
[1:24:01] the law henceforth when we die we go in
[1:24:04] the sixth Dimension we go under the
[1:24:08] altar are we
[1:24:12] together blessed is he that watch and
[1:24:16] keepeth His Garment least he walk naked
[1:24:20] and they see his shame blessed are they
[1:24:24] which I called unto the marriage supper
[1:24:27] of the
[1:24:28] Lamb blessed and holy is he that have
[1:24:32] that that that that have part in the
[1:24:35] first resurrection which is the rapture
[1:24:38] right are we
[1:24:43] together behold I come quickly blessed
[1:24:47] is he that keepeth the saying of the
[1:24:50] prophecy of this book and and blessed
[1:24:52] are they that do his
[1:24:56] Commandments are we
[1:24:58] together
[1:25:01] amen so I I don't know how I how I find
[1:25:04] it but it's just all the seven they keep
[1:25:06] popping up praise the Lord I just
[1:25:09] thought I should share that with you
[1:25:11] amen now we want to talk about this this
[1:25:15] uh promise of internal life abiding in
[1:25:18] the word abiding in what ye have heard
[1:25:22] from the beginning the word abiding
[1:25:24] means to remain in to
[1:25:27] continue uh uh to preserve in
[1:25:30] anything a state of mind to hold fast to
[1:25:35] be truth to abide by to
[1:25:38] keep and uh uh uh I think I took that
[1:25:41] either one one from the other I think
[1:25:43] the upper one was from uh uh the the
[1:25:45] Greek concordance this one is from the
[1:25:47] Hebrew concordance to stand to remain to
[1:25:51] endal take one's
[1:25:58] stand to stand take one stand to be to
[1:26:01] be to to be in EXT standing attitude
[1:26:05] stand for Take A Stand Paul in the book
[1:26:08] of Hebrew I mean uh uh Ephesians says
[1:26:11] when you have put on all the armor of
[1:26:13] God then stand amen praise the Lord so
[1:26:17] we want to talk about that the
[1:26:20] abiding now before I go into
[1:26:23] that I want to share something with you
[1:26:27] and uh uh uh uh when we do these
[1:26:31] PowerPoints like that they don't come
[1:26:33] out much clearer back there than they
[1:26:35] come up yet so I'm going to be turning
[1:26:37] this
[1:26:39] way now so uh H uh I thought about this
[1:26:44] and I thought that I would share this
[1:26:46] with you before I continue brother Bram
[1:26:47] says here in the Ephesian Church age
[1:26:50] yeah yeah it is in G
[1:26:54] 81 praise the
[1:26:56] Lord are we
[1:27:00] together
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:05] amen but thou uh but do we or an angel
[1:27:10] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:27:14] you than that which ye have that which
[1:27:18] we have already preached unto
[1:27:21] you let him be a
[1:27:24] curse it was the Apostle who brought the
[1:27:28] original word of the Gospel that's Paul
[1:27:31] that original word could not be
[1:27:35] changed not
[1:27:37] even a DOT or a dash of
[1:27:40] eight Jesus also said it now now the TT
[1:27:44] you know could be
[1:27:46] alter Paul knew it was God who had
[1:27:50] spoken to him so he said even if I come
[1:27:55] and try to
[1:27:57] give a second
[1:28:00] Revelation try to make one little change
[1:28:04] in what I have
[1:28:06] originally let me be a curse you see
[1:28:10] Paul knew
[1:28:14] that he knew that first revelation was
[1:28:18] correct God K gave a first revelation
[1:28:23] then a second Revelation explain that he
[1:28:28] came give a first revelation in the
[1:28:30] second Revelation means that God is not
[1:28:33] learning
[1:28:36] better okay he's not learning better to
[1:28:41] say uh yesterday I told you this but
[1:28:45] today you know I I I think I understand
[1:28:48] it
[1:28:49] better okay no he's he's now
[1:28:55] learning he is the W he is the Fountain
[1:28:57] of all wisdom of all
[1:29:01] knowledge praise the Lord so he cannot
[1:29:05] give a first revelation on a subject and
[1:29:09] gave a better Revelation on that same
[1:29:12] subject that's what I want to make my
[1:29:14] emphasis on he gave a revelation
[1:29:17] anything that come s is just
[1:29:20] informational
[1:29:23] and we living in such a time where
[1:29:25] people take information as
[1:29:31] Revelation and you hear it all over the
[1:29:33] place well the Lord revealed this to me
[1:29:35] the Lord revealed this to
[1:29:37] me in in Biblical context Revelation
[1:29:41] only comes to the
[1:29:43] prophet the Lord God speaks to the
[1:29:48] prophet I don't have a
[1:29:50] revelation every everything I'm bringing
[1:29:52] to you is just information on a subject
[1:29:56] I'm using the word to give you more
[1:29:58] information on a
[1:30:01] subject I don't have a
[1:30:04] revelation no preacher have a
[1:30:08] revelation the Lord God speaks to his
[1:30:15] Prophet are we
[1:30:19] together can the church say amen amen
[1:30:22] am I making you afraid oh
[1:30:25] well praise the
[1:30:28] Lord I want to set you
[1:30:31] free amen you see that's the reason why
[1:30:35] all the gifts comes back to the word my
[1:30:38] gift is judged by the word you have a
[1:30:41] dream bring it back to the word you
[1:30:43] think God speaks to you bring it back to
[1:30:45] the
[1:30:50] word
[1:30:53] if it does not fit in the word it's not
[1:30:55] good for
[1:30:57] you it's not good for you don't make a
[1:30:59] name for yourself that name will take
[1:31:01] you to hell if it does not fit in the
[1:31:04] word leave
[1:31:07] it all of those things are is the spirit
[1:31:11] of thee you have to realize that that
[1:31:14] the loudish
[1:31:16] age is the P the the the the the the
[1:31:19] Church of the loudish age is the
[1:31:21] Pentecostal
[1:31:27] church
[1:31:29] amen the voice of Revelation 4 has
[1:31:32] called us out of the laisha edge we have
[1:31:35] come out of the
[1:31:41] edge
[1:31:44] spiritually naturally we stay in the
[1:31:47] age so sometimes those things of the age
[1:31:52] affect us you hear that you hear it
[1:31:54] among people God revealed this to me the
[1:31:56] Lord revealed this to me brother I got a
[1:31:59] revelation I was reading yesterday iord
[1:32:01] Revelation you just got a
[1:32:04] better
[1:32:07] understanding you don't have a
[1:32:09] revelation you don't have a
[1:32:14] revelation let's read let's let's
[1:32:17] continue to
[1:32:20] read
[1:32:24] God can't give a first revelation then
[1:32:27] the second Revelation if he did he will
[1:32:29] be changing his
[1:32:31] mind he can give a revelation and then
[1:32:36] add to
[1:32:38] it as he did in the Garden of
[1:32:43] Eden when he promised the seed of the
[1:32:47] woman and then
[1:32:50] later uh uh destinated that sea had to
[1:32:54] come through Abraham amen so when he to
[1:32:58] spoke to Abraham what did he says your
[1:33:01] seed will possess the
[1:33:03] gates is that same seed that he spoke
[1:33:06] about in Genesis chapter 15 The Seed of
[1:33:10] the
[1:33:12] woman that's the reason why the seed is
[1:33:15] not a natural seed it's a spiritual seed
[1:33:20] so it move in progression it keep
[1:33:23] progressing are we
[1:33:26] together
[1:33:32] Amen Let me let's let's look at
[1:33:34] something
[1:33:36] else I might never get to what I want to
[1:33:39] preach but it's
[1:33:50] okay well let's
[1:33:54] uh let's let's continue to read let's
[1:33:56] continue to read it might it might take
[1:33:58] me into a complete different direction
[1:34:01] but let's continue to read
[1:34:04] here if he did that he will be changing
[1:34:06] his mind he can give a revelation and
[1:34:10] then add to it as he did in the Garden
[1:34:13] of Eden when he promised the seed to the
[1:34:17] woman and then later destinated that
[1:34:20] seed had to come through Abraham and
[1:34:24] then later said it will
[1:34:26] come by the same blood line of
[1:34:31] David you see that's the reason why if
[1:34:34] you remember when we were talking about
[1:34:38] bypassing the
[1:34:39] curse
[1:34:41] because the the the seed that's that's
[1:34:44] if if if you watch brother Bram will
[1:34:46] always says when uh when uh uh
[1:34:50] when when Satan got the Hebrew boys in
[1:34:53] the fire he thought he got the seed he
[1:34:56] says I got
[1:34:58] them amen praise the Lord because in in
[1:35:03] his mind he was he was he was looking
[1:35:05] for a natural
[1:35:09] seed he was also
[1:35:13] following you know he was following he
[1:35:15] was watching their
[1:35:18] promise are we together now so uh uh uh
[1:35:23] and and and and and when we were talking
[1:35:24] about that God came and and brought the
[1:35:27] promise down to to to David and said
[1:35:29] David I will give you a seed with an
[1:35:31] everlasting
[1:35:34] Kingdom I sure that God set sat on
[1:35:37] attention an everlasting Kingdom so I
[1:35:39] have to follow the seed of David but you
[1:35:41] see there in jeconiah when God curs th
[1:35:46] sea line of David that this man will
[1:35:49] have no CH then how would David now have
[1:35:53] an everlasting
[1:35:55] Throne you see but God in keeping his
[1:35:59] word he had to B pass that sea
[1:36:03] line and and and give Israel a promise
[1:36:07] that the Virgin shall
[1:36:11] conceive you
[1:36:13] see so it is not a new revelation it
[1:36:17] might look like new it had never
[1:36:19] happened before a virgin has never it's
[1:36:21] not a new revelation because back in
[1:36:24] Genesis he said the woman will have a
[1:36:27] seed so it's not a new uh it's not a new
[1:36:31] revelation it's just a
[1:36:36] progression the same way we progress in
[1:36:39] our
[1:36:41] understanding we used to believe a a
[1:36:44] trinity Doctrine we don't believe that
[1:36:46] anymore
[1:36:50] right are we
[1:36:52] together
[1:36:54] amen I'm hoping it's making sense to
[1:36:59] you and little said it will come by the
[1:37:03] same bloodline in David but but it was
[1:37:08] the same
[1:37:09] Revelation it only gave the people more
[1:37:14] information to help
[1:37:17] them receive and understand it
[1:37:22] praise the Lord am it only gave them
[1:37:25] more information to help them to receive
[1:37:29] and understand it praise the lord it's
[1:37:33] almost like the
[1:37:36] word why God have a fivefold Ministry
[1:37:39] just to give us different style of
[1:37:41] presentation it's the same
[1:37:44] word it's the same word the gifts are
[1:37:47] just designed to make you to look at it
[1:37:49] like this and look at the same way you
[1:37:51] go shopping you are looking at the thing
[1:37:52] all over look at it
[1:37:58] look that that's just all you
[1:38:01] doing it's just for you to be able to
[1:38:03] look at every angle of the
[1:38:07] word praise the Lord if a man thinks
[1:38:10] that he's bringing H uh his own
[1:38:13] Revelation glory be to God we don't need
[1:38:18] it amen we don't need
[1:38:22] it he says it's the same Revelation it
[1:38:25] only gives the people more information
[1:38:28] to help them receive it and understand
[1:38:30] it you see sometimes those things bother
[1:38:34] the local
[1:38:35] church because I'm your pastor you get
[1:38:40] you get uh uh uh uh used to
[1:38:42] understanding the way I present the word
[1:38:45] uh uh uh and then a brother will come
[1:38:49] and say something
[1:38:52] sometimes if he don't use my exact
[1:38:58] words a a a TR he said it was the same
[1:39:01] chuban that Ezekiel Saw he said it was
[1:39:04] the same chuban that aah saw when Isaiah
[1:39:08] said their train filled their Temple he
[1:39:11] said they were moving so fast that like
[1:39:13] they were moving like train he said in
[1:39:16] in Revelation H H chapter 4 it was the
[1:39:19] same cherubin that John
[1:39:22] saw but they were all looking at it from
[1:39:25] different
[1:39:26] position he said the chuban was given to
[1:39:29] protect the church so those those
[1:39:32] cherubin dwell with the church in all of
[1:39:35] their
[1:39:36] Journey Moses saw the in the Garden of
[1:39:39] Eden protecting the Tree of Life when
[1:39:42] John saw it in the Book of Revelation
[1:39:44] the church has already arrived home
[1:39:47] that's
[1:39:50] right
[1:39:53] praise the Lord
[1:39:58] amen because those things uh you
[1:40:04] know sometimes on on little
[1:40:08] information people create a certain line
[1:40:11] of belief and then and then they bring
[1:40:13] they bring forces among the
[1:40:18] people praise the Lord and it says
[1:40:22] that's my Revelation you if it is your
[1:40:24] Revelation I don't want
[1:40:27] it the reason why I don't want it
[1:40:29] because you are not a prophet
[1:40:35] that's are we together now so look here
[1:40:39] also as we read he says uh uh uh but the
[1:40:45] same Revelation it only gives the people
[1:40:47] more information to help them receive
[1:40:49] and understand it
[1:40:51] but God word can change this the seed
[1:40:55] came exactly as revealed Hallelujah get

[1:41:06] apostles or the prophets or the teacher
[1:41:09] it is the word that try
[1:41:16] them are we together
[1:41:19] amen it's it's it's almost like uh you

[1:42:00] word
[1:42:10] uh I show this to you over in the book
[1:42:13] of Deuteronomy where the uh when Moses
[1:42:17] was instructing the children of Israel
[1:42:19] he says if a man
[1:42:22] he says if a
[1:42:24] man steal an
[1:42:27] ox or he say steal a sheep a man the man
[1:42:32] and the man is caught stealing the Sheep
[1:42:35] he must Resto the sheep for
[1:42:40] forth
[1:42:42] amen he stole one he should repay back
[1:42:46] four
[1:42:47] times that's what Moses said Moses was
[1:42:50] the proph
[1:42:51] Prophet
[1:42:53] amen now naon will use that very same
[1:42:56] thing to
[1:42:58] David when Nathan went to David he built
[1:43:02] a story what was that an inspiration he
[1:43:05] took what the prophet Moses said and he
[1:43:08] buil an inspiration to be able to help
[1:43:11] deliver
[1:43:12] David if he have gone to David house and
[1:43:15] said David you you have just killed a
[1:43:19] person
[1:43:23] amen you have committed adultery you
[1:43:26] know the Lord showed me last night I saw
[1:43:28] you I saw you and B he went to David he
[1:43:31] said David we have a
[1:43:35] problem we have a very poor man that
[1:43:38] have only one
[1:43:41] lamb and there's a wealthy gu in this
[1:43:43] time that went and took their poor man
[1:43:49] lamb praise the Lord
[1:43:52] all he was using was what Moses
[1:43:57] said yeah just what Moses
[1:44:00] said David says what honor my
[1:44:05] rulership the man that have done that
[1:44:07] the man should
[1:44:10] die Nathan says you are the
[1:44:13] man but you are not going to die why
[1:44:17] because I caught you
[1:44:19] right-handed M by a vision I CAU you on
[1:44:25] Vision so you're going to restore it
[1:44:28] four times go back to to 1 Samuel or 2
[1:44:32] Samuel the story you realize Nathan told
[1:44:35] David four things that will happen in
[1:44:37] his
[1:44:40] house praise the Lord amen you you
[1:44:44] remember the story the brother Ben B
[1:44:46] Woods when his brother you know he told
[1:44:50] his brother that about brother Brandon
[1:44:51] those guys were were Jehovah Witness
[1:44:53] told his brother about brother Brandon
[1:44:55] and uh you know and and and and and uh
[1:44:58] his brother came to see brother Bram you
[1:45:00] know he says uh you know this guy he's
[1:45:02] he's reading people mind in order of
[1:45:05] that and the law showed brother brother
[1:45:08] Brandon that brother Ben who's brother
[1:45:11] had just committed
[1:45:14] adultery amen so he he told him he says
[1:45:19] he says he says sir what's about last
[1:45:22] night it was good you went through the
[1:45:23] window that man will have blow your
[1:45:25] brain
[1:45:29] off he knew his brother did not know
[1:45:31] what he
[1:45:34] did praise the
[1:45:37] Lord he knew that his brother could not
[1:45:40] tell brother Brandon that because his
[1:45:41] brother never knew what he
[1:45:45] did but said it was good you went
[1:45:47] through the window that guy will have
[1:45:48] blow your brain off it was easy for him
[1:45:51] to surrounder his life this man that
[1:45:53] know my secret they think I just did
[1:45:55] last
[1:46:01] night are we
[1:46:04] together so Nathan is telling David I
[1:46:07] caught you right-handed and by the word
[1:46:10] of God the the word never said when you
[1:46:12] catch the man you should kill him the
[1:46:14] word say if you catch him he should
[1:46:16] restore four
[1:46:19] times
[1:46:22] so David this is going to happen to you
[1:46:24] this is going to happen to you this is
[1:46:26] going to happen to you this is going to
[1:46:28] happen to
[1:46:32] you so you see it's just one
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] Revelation every other thing that comes
[1:46:39] is just information or inspiration
[1:46:42] whichever way you want to call it well
[1:46:45] let's get into our subject we almost out
[1:46:47] of
[1:46:48] time praise the Lord
[1:46:52] are we together
[1:46:54] am
[1:46:58] okay this thing need to
[1:47:02] work praise the
[1:47:05] Lord now so we will we will what we want
[1:47:08] to talk about here is uh is uh
[1:47:12] abiding John said ye abide in what ye
[1:47:17] have heard from the beginning and Jes
[1:47:20] Jesus here is uh is is is is telling us
[1:47:25] in in in St John chapter 15 like I like
[1:47:28] I said last week when when when Jesus
[1:47:31] was saying that he was preaching to his
[1:47:32] disciple I am the vine ye are the
[1:47:34] branches you know abide in in in me and
[1:47:38] I in you you know it's it's it's the
[1:47:40] same way it's the same way people come
[1:47:42] they sit around the message it just
[1:47:44] looks like you're talking more more
[1:47:46] about brother Brandon than Jesus
[1:47:49] Christ
[1:47:51] that's how it might sound to
[1:47:53] you amen but you read right in your
[1:47:57] Bible there in the book of as the Bible
[1:47:59] says when uh uh H the Bible says and
[1:48:03] Moses was read in the synagogues every
[1:48:06] Sabbath there is no book in the Bible
[1:48:08] called
[1:48:12] Moses and I believe the same thing that
[1:48:16] these disciples as they sat on Jesus
[1:48:18] ministry the they all T this guy is all
[1:48:21] abide in me and I abide in you I I he
[1:48:24] keep using this
[1:48:27] thing praise the
[1:48:29] Lord but when
[1:48:31] John went to the island of
[1:48:34] pmos after the Holy Ghost has
[1:48:37] come the Bible tells us that the Holy
[1:48:41] Spirit started to bring back to their to
[1:48:43] their Memories the things that g the
[1:48:46] Holy Spirit starts to make the thing
[1:48:48] make the world real to them
[1:48:53] amen Jesus told him now I wash your feet
[1:48:57] you don't know what I'm doing you wash
[1:48:59] one another feet he said but you will
[1:49:01] know from here
[1:49:04] on praise the Lord and Paul comes in the
[1:49:07] book of Ephesian he tells us that we are
[1:49:10] watched by the watching of the Water by
[1:49:13] the
[1:49:17] word so what Jesus did to them in in in
[1:49:21] a literal form and and and establish an
[1:49:24] ordinance for the church it is what the
[1:49:27] word of God does to
[1:49:29] us every time we come to service we come
[1:49:32] for a feet washing how we can walk right
[1:49:36] how we can stand on the Promises of God
[1:49:40] right are we
[1:49:44] together so Jesus is telling them I am
[1:49:47] the vine ye are the branches abide in
[1:49:52] me now John will come from the island of
[1:49:55] the pmos and he will be using that very
[1:49:58] same statement AB in what ye have heard
[1:50:02] from the
[1:50:04] beginning trying to show us our our our
[1:50:09] place of
[1:50:11] worship
[1:50:12] amen our place of
[1:50:15] worship we are not we are not coming
[1:50:18] together to come into good sh church we
[1:50:20] are coming into Christ we are coming to
[1:50:23] abide in the
[1:50:27] word are we
[1:50:30] together so we have just read that is
[1:50:33] our promise of eternal life when we
[1:50:36] abide in the word the promise of eternal
[1:50:39] life is to stay in the
[1:50:42] word you will realize that is actually
[1:50:45] the power that we
[1:50:47] have I was just telling the brother
[1:50:50] during the week we were you know talking
[1:50:52] with a friend back there from Ghana
[1:50:54] fellowshipping together I was telling
[1:50:56] this brother I says you know when when
[1:50:58] when when you you you think about it
[1:51:00] Jesus says I will give you power and the
[1:51:02] human mind we we we we we think about
[1:51:05] exercise we think about muscle we think
[1:51:07] about you know what physical
[1:51:12] strength no but God power is in his
[1:51:18] word amen
[1:51:20] it's the word that gives us the power to
[1:51:24] resist the lust of the word it's the
[1:51:26] word that gives us the power to stand
[1:51:29] for Christ to stand for
[1:51:34] righteousness so actually the power to
[1:51:37] the church is a power of
[1:51:40] endurance a power that can make you to
[1:51:44] endure praise the Lord amen if it was if
[1:51:49] it was based on our physical strength we
[1:51:51] will be
[1:51:54] finished praise the Lord you find people
[1:51:57] believing God for their healing they're
[1:51:59] going through things in their body you
[1:52:02] know where pains and different thing
[1:52:04] they are holding on to the promise of
[1:52:05] God they keep praising God they keep
[1:52:07] serving God where are they getting the
[1:52:09] strength from when their physical body
[1:52:11] is falling
[1:52:13] apart it's the word that is keeping them
[1:52:18] together
[1:52:22] praise the
[1:52:24] Lord even sometimes our young people
[1:52:27] they don't even understand what they are
[1:52:29] going through their mind is all the
[1:52:31] devil is just blasting their mind with
[1:52:33] different thing they are going through
[1:52:34] different things in their body and all
[1:52:36] of that the the feet discouraged the
[1:52:38] feet condemned but yet there is there is
[1:52:40] there there is a hope that drops in
[1:52:42] their heart they want to get back to
[1:52:44] church they want to come into the
[1:52:46] fellowship what is that is that
[1:52:48] endurance power it's not your strength
[1:52:52] it's not your
[1:52:53] knowledge it's not your mental
[1:52:56] conception that's why Jesus said I will
[1:52:59] give you power when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:53:02] upon you he said I will drop something
[1:53:04] in your soul something that will be able
[1:53:06] to keep you in a time of
[1:53:10] [Applause]
[1:53:17] trial raes now to the Swift
[1:53:20] praise the Lord neither neither is not
[1:53:23] to the one that
[1:53:25] impress but to the one that
[1:53:27] endure he that endureth unto the end
[1:53:32] Jesus said the same shall be saved
[1:53:35] praise the Lord while they are running I
[1:53:38] would

[1:58:40] word we are not following a man no we
[1:58:45] are following the
[1:58:48] word
[1:58:51] amen whenever when you hear the the the
[1:58:55] manifestation of the sons of God let me
[1:58:57] let me let me explain it to you like
[1:58:59] this St John chapter 1 John said in the
[1:59:02] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:59:05] God the Word was God and the word of God
[1:59:09] put on flesh and came and dwelt Among Us
[1:59:11] so what he's saying is that whenever the
[1:59:16] logos take on the flesh is is the
[1:59:20] manifestation of the son is the
[1:59:23] manifestation of the Son of
[1:59:26] God praise the Lord David saw Goliath
[1:59:30] challenging that young young boy he got
[1:59:33] there in a camp taking some food for his
[1:59:35] brothers and he he says he says what is
[1:59:38] this noise this man challenging the army
[1:59:40] of the Living God praise the Lord
[1:59:45] amen knowing that the prophet Samuel had
[1:59:48] just anointed him couple of days ago a
[1:59:51] couple of weeks ago a couple of months
[1:59:53] ago whatever time it was but he was
[1:59:56] anointed by a
[1:59:58] prophet amen so he was he was already
[2:00:02] under the anointing of the word he was
[2:00:05] already honor the anointing of the word
[2:00:08] because he was honor a promise to become
[2:00:11] a king of Israel and here he comes and
[2:00:15] meets a
[2:00:16] challenge praise the Lord
[2:00:19] the moment he open his heart and he says
[2:00:23] no way no way I can't sit down here for
[2:00:26] an unsec concised Philistine to
[2:00:28] challenge the army of the the Lord God
[2:00:31] says that's the one I want the Lord God
[2:00:33] just pick up that
[2:00:37] flesh praise the Lord you see that in
[2:00:40] your in your own life there are times
[2:00:43] where you stand for the word you say no
[2:00:46] you just get a
[2:00:48] strength
[2:00:50] praise the lord and there are times
[2:00:53] where you reason you reason you reason
[2:00:55] you reason and you don't get the
[2:00:57] strength is because you did not open
[2:00:59] that channel whenever you open the
[2:01:01] channel the logos come and pick up your
[2:01:08] flesh praise the Lord that is the same
[2:01:11] reason why Sam S could pick up a a a
[2:01:14] gate on his shoulder Sam could tear a
[2:01:17] lion apart Sam could k the Philistines
[2:01:20] but the day where he closed the channel
[2:01:22] and allowed thead to cut his head his
[2:01:25] eyes were taken out he didn't not have
[2:01:27] the strength again because it is not you
[2:01:30] it is when that channel is open that the

[2:15:05] say all that the father has given me
[2:15:08] will
[2:15:13] come that's that's an Earnest statement
[2:15:15] from my heart to you

[2:15:27] lifted up I will draw man how do we lift
[2:15:30] him up by the standard of the word
[2:15:34] there's a word that is given to us
[2:15:35] there's a word we have to we have to
[2:15:37] uphold there's a
[2:15:40] repetition the name of Jesus we
[2:15:43] represent him at work we represent him
[2:15:45] in the street we represent him when we
[2:15:47] are alone when we lift his name up he
[2:15:49] says I will draw I get the drawing power
[2:15:53] in my
[2:16:06] hands are we
[2:16:11] together about in what you have heard
