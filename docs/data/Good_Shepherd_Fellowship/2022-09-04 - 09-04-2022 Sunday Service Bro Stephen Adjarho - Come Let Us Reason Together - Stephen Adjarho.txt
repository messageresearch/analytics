your name jesus all right let's go ahead and sit we have a special here this morning from sister naomi sister naomi god bless you real quick there was another song i was going to do today and this one came to my heart and um okay i i was listening to a sermon this morning where it showed me that this was the right song it says um says god seeks after man man in his nature is a rebellion against god he doesn't he's against god but god loves the man since the fall in the garden of eden god has still been calling for his child i don't know where you how you are but i have such a burden when i go shopping and everything i'm looking isn't there somebody still that wants to love the lord with all their heart and so anyway this song came to me a while back and um i pray that it'll be a blessing to you and if maybe there's someone you're thinking about that you'd like to see come to the lord maybe this will get something started [Music] where are you [Music] the spirit is searching all across the land for the last remaining children of the land [Music] where are you [Music] it is [Music] it's not all about how good that you are it's all about you responding to his call come home searching searching it's time for you to come [Music] other voices whisper that you really want to stay where pleasure-seeking spirits bout to steal your soul away [Music] is [Music] come home [Music] resist the devil he wants to ignore your flesh then drag you through the mire while he sits back and left hold on the lifeline is [Music] is pleading his open arms [Music] our father [Music] come home why are you waiting the earth is about to get it's quick [Music] my child [Music] [Music] let's put our hands together for jesus sometimes songs like that can just bring tears to me amen amen sometimes you have to listen to the versions of those songs and just draw that moment amen so songs they are just so inspirational yeah they create that kind of atmosphere in your life when you you're alone you just sing those songs and mean it to your heart you just feel that presence of god so let us put our hands together for jesus [Applause] let's go ahead and sing our next song um i think we can skip that song and go to psalm 45 while we call on the preacher we'll call after this song we'll call on brother then to introduce a preacher for us i'm the preacher of the day let us go ahead and stand [Music] [Music] and [Music] blessedness [Music] ah [Music] so [Music] so uh [Music] uh [Music] [Applause] hey hey praise the lord hallelujah praise god shall we be seated for a moment musician just stay here for a while praise the lord you are all warmly welcome to the house of god once again we know when we are away a lot of things happen so it's always heartwarming to come back and now we're able to see everybody's face and uh that gives us the assurance that we are all pressing on the upward way because guess what the battle continues yes till god decides to wrap it up the battle continues yes just expect a battle don't be a coward when you step out there just know that somehow god is believing in you god is trusting in you to go and when the opportunity comes don't let god down how many people were blessed on wednesday night praise be to god that was just a wonderful atmosphere what a wonderful time with the lord we have been so blessed in this assembly that we have seen the arm of god time and again praise be to god and if christ harris we know that we are going to see more of him there is no doubt whatsoever whatever seed god has planted he is going to water it and that seed in its own season praise be to god would blossom and would bear fruits and nothing will stop the program of god you know a lot of the times when we read the scriptures we we want to identify ourselves with the good characters and we hardly want to identify ourselves with the bad characters but if you follow that last wednesday service closely that even in the bad characters we are reflected when you look at the judases there is a fears the abiram the chorus the detains mention them we are reflected in all these characters judas saw christ and there was no second chance for him as the preacher said on wednesday can you think of the number of times you have sold him and you are associated here a lot of times a lot of us have not been faithful in our tithing can you think of the number of times you've been unfaithful and you are still here some people lifted their voices against the prophet of god and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up can you think of the number of times you have lifted your voice against the word of god and you are still seated here some people got themselves defiled with the ornaments that god warned them not to and the second they never got a second chance can you think of the number of times you have defiled yourselves with the ornaments of this thing of this life their sins and their trespasses and you associated here this brings me back to the vision brother branham saw when he saw a world hanging in the air surrounded by a rainbow and god told him that the angel i mean the rainbow is the blood of christ that is just keeping the wrath of god but for that blood that blood on the mercy seat praise be to god this makes you to appreciate the grace of god more it makes you to appreciate the grace of god more there's something people did and never got a second chance you have got a second third four fifth till you can't even count it but for the blood of christ who are we wonderful jesus praise be to god god is so merciful and do not take the grace of god for granted what the grace of god has done for you never take it for granted it was just a wonderful time of fellowship god knows our needs god will supply our needs according to his riches in glory but the most important thing don't ever play that place the card before the horse the most important things of life should never be overlooked where adam fell that relationship he had with god as we heard on wednesday that is where christ is bringing us back to that relationship if you don't have a relationship with god guess what you can have all the blessings of this world you are the most miserable creature that ever lived it is better to have christ and to die to die a proper to die to die with christ in your soul knowing that when this life comes to an end there is a better one that is awaiting you than to die with all the riches on clothes and then you get to the end of the road and you don't know where you're going to spend eternity praise be to god it was a wonderful time this morning brother one is not here he went to a wedding with brother jarrod who is ministering for us this morning to chicago and uh bradajaro flew in this morning to take the service but the one is in chicago he is going to take the service there today so by the grace of god whatever your heart desire is always come to the house of god expect him never on any day on any occasion just gather up because it's sunday i'm going to church that is fine but have something on your heart always come expecting always come in expectation praise be to god and do not come looking at a man come trusting and believing in god praise be to god so this morning [Music] bradajaro is going to minister for us he is not a new face and if he was after last sunday i mean last wednesday he was no longer a new face praise be to god before we call him in as a musician softly play we are going to go before the lord in prayer i have two prayer needs here um please pray for sis irene will not be in service this morning because of stomach issues she is doing online service this morning praise be to god this is coming from sis kelly and then our agent prayer request from sis naomi my sister-in-law her name is judy has that covey demon bordering her she is diabetic and has heart problems so this is very serious praise be to god we are giving god all the serious problems there is nothing impossible in his name [Music] christ not only died for our salvation he also died for our healing because the bible has made it categorically clear that he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his tribes we were healed so we have a promise and we are just going to remind god of his promise concerning us praise be to god and i also want to take this opportunity to remember my wife sister too she is not feeling very fine she's been complaining of fatigue tightness here and there and whatever need they be in the house of god this morning we trust that god by his grace would visit every one of us as we stand praise be to god and if you have any special need any unspoken request with our eyes closed and our hair is bowed you can lift up your hand praise be to god shall we pray our lord and our savior jesus we thank this so very much oh god for this morning for another opportunity to gather before your turn of grace trusting and believing that the lord our god is going to manifest his beauty further before the very house of your children this morning father we are so very much grateful for guarding us together here father all god as a hand would gather its young ones under his wings that you may minister unto us according to our needs

your daughter sister for two into your hands this morning and as many as are sick in the house this morning father will lift them into your hands this morning oh god father we are coming by the way of your word we say that by your stress we are healed and father o god we pray in the name of jesus let your arm of deliverance be revealed in the lives of your children let your arm father all god be revealed in their lives and let every demon of circumstances let every sickness let every disease further let every infamily every charm and every spell the enemy has cast upon your children father all god be truncated in the name of jesus may you confound the enemy may you put the enemy to shame may you over true father oh god every institution of darkness in their lives and we pray dear lord

of your holy spirit move over your way oh god and minister unto every single need father speak to every single soul there are as many of us that have gathered tonight we will never leave your presence the way we have come in father may you come and be a part of this service lord if we do come together and you don't show up our garden is completely useless father we have come because we know you are

ear touch us father in what only you can do in the name of jesus father we leave sister t before you this morning even though she's in service father she couldn't make it to the sanctuary she is following the service in her car because father she is just tired and weak may you give her strength in her body father we pray dear lord jesus she is in the final hours are the final the final weeks of her pregnancy we pray nourish her strength nourish her strength keep her father under the tabernacle of thy mighty ring so god do not let the enemy ever have his way against your daughter we pray build hey be her strength and stay in the mighty name of the lord jesus we pray and we thank this so much oh god that you've heard and answered our prayers this morning in jesus name amen praise the lord following this morning's the sunday school the song that was a song we are marching we are marching to zario okay so i would like us to sing that song as we welcome the man of god in our midst and i just want to remind you if you ever forgot i want to remind ourselves that we are in the journey we are in a journey praise be to god and when a man is in a journey you look at the man and you can tell that this man is in a journey you don't have to be told let people see you the life you are living and tell that this person is in a journey [Music] that this is not your home praise be to god shall we sing that song as we invite the man of god in praise be to god [Music] cannot worry your voice for a minute i am [Music] around the [Music] god [Music] me [Music] beautiful [Music] god [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] this morning amen i want to thank god for his grace and his mercy and uh bringing us here safely this morning i believe the lord has something for us this morning amen i strongly believe that may the 31st borough owner myself and a few of the ministers who traveled to alaska and every bit of the trip just show hindrance and uh i left brother one on them in anchorage and i was flying to shivac uh you know shivac is where brother andrew and the brethrens they are amen i don't call them eskimos because they crack a choke on that and they say they say the turbo fleet and then say you call us eskimos and you eat raw meat say eskimo meat eaters of raw meat say we don't eat raw meat you do so we crack jokes on that so i was fine down there i got to the airport and uh they said there was no flight for me and then i knew that the lord wanted me to be there by all means because there was just obstacles after obstacles after obstacles at that point in time i just rested my mind i called brother andra said there is no flight and and shivac is not like it's not a city you're going into the the village and so maybe probably maybe one or two flight and that's it and they have those little uh shuttles they just trusted god and then finally they got a flight and one of them the man that was standing there say where you where you going i said shiva said what are you going to do there amen i said there are people there and i'm going to go see those people amen and so we're driving and and we're talking about let's get it let's get a ticket so that way we don't uh we don't get into the rubbles of the wedding and all of that and not be able to get a ticket so we got a ticket we taught and i got to the airport and i was about to check in my baggage this morning what i was already driving away and [Music] the machine said you can't check in your baggage 12 hours ahead of time and then i called the lady and said can you come help me out please and she said uh it looked like you got the wrong ticket and so i looked at my phone i said maybe i'm using the ticket for my trip back to virginia so i kind of looked back again and said no this is the right ticket and then we realized that when we're booking the flight but i won't got actually 7 p.m flight so the devil didn't want me to be here so so when i thought of it 7 p.m i said my it just got real and uh we have to do something on this one so i went to the counter i told ladies is there where we can change it let's say you have to pay the difference i said it doesn't matter because i have to be in minnesota this morning amen and god being so kind i got to the counter talked to the lady and she looked in and checked the flight and she said there was a flight for this morning and the flight was just our schedule i got the flight amen yeah am i this morning amen praise god so so that means we're gonna have uh [Applause] that means we're gonna have a good service this morning amen what makes it good is you amen you say why is it a good service because we are trying to really understand christianity from the true perspective that he came to the gentiles see the perspective that christianity came to the agenda was lost even after god sent a prophet to revamp and clear the darkness that covered true christianity people made creed and dogma courts and society out of the light that the prophet brought to show you what true christianity really is the gentiles don't know what true christianity is we don't even the jews when christianity came to them they didn't know what it is so god have to raise a man who was persecuting the christians god had to raise him and actually bring the true teaching of what christianity really is peter didn't know what christianity is right after the holy ghost in acceptable he didn't really know what it is they were still going to they was going to the temple they were they didn't know what they didn't know what this is they were eating and they separated from gentiles they didn't understand what this is they thought they were still in judaism and they just received holy ghost so they've got the holy ghost but they still have some old square teaching they didn't really understand what christianity is and here was paul who really he was baptized and soaked into judaism it was it he was a student of judaism he understands judaism like his back like the back of his finger he know what judaism was and here was paul with all those knowledge he felt that these were some crazy people trying to bring abomination trying to desecrate judaism and he was ready to wipe them out and then god will meet him on the way and god will tell him that i am jesus now you don't get you don't have a clue of that this man only know one god you know many god even you're true this morning i won't be one of them but this man only know one god that's it his shoes his belt is careful everything about a jew speak of god everything when you are going into your house there is something they have on the wall it's called the mezuzah they have to kiss it there's a scripture on it on their head they have to tie a scripture on it on their hand they have to type scripture they have to attach scripture all over their body and then they also have to have a big scroll to read from so a jew is a man that is struck is so struck into one god all those scriptures talk about one god it's not about how you get a job there's nothing about that to the jew everything about those scriptures is about god god god god god and so this man who knows about that one god and the rituals and the traditions and all those things that that one god has set in place some group of juveniles came up and they they claimed they want to turn israel upside down they've just nailed their master to the cross and they told that was the end of the story and now they saw what they nailed to the cross multiplied in 120 people you see this is going crazy we thought we just nailed this into the cross they nailed it to the cross and it exploded on 120 amen and they tried to nail 120 he exploded to 3 000. they tried to nail it at the explanation of 5 000. it doesn't begin to explode and but abraham said they thunder the seven thunder is like a rocket it explode they bring a five-star that five-star bringer and it just become infinite there is no end to its explosion but yeah it has exploded to us and now we begin to handle it with levity because we don't even know what we're holding you don't even know what's in your hand you're holding the most precious thing in your hand and you don't know what it is it's about you so we're going to continue from where we stop on wednesday because on wednesday was a continuation of on sunday which the son of god was talking about the quickening power which most people often misunder they misinterpret amen when they get quickening power they're thinking of leaning on somebody and god healing that person no that's not what we're talking about we're talking about god producing children on earth that's what quickly is all about john received quickening power he never performed one miracle until his head was cut off probably the only miracle we could see was when they chopped off his head but he received quickening power so he goes to show you that quickening power goes beyond just creeper walking blind icing and all of no it goes beyond that quick neighbor were quicking this man until he reflected god that's what we're talking about god producing children it's not just healing secrets healing is everywhere in case you don't know there are men giving motivational speech this morning and healing is taking place because where do you want to be healed do you want to be healing your mind or you want to be healing your body now most of this healing happened in the body because people science has found out how they call it placebo they can talk you into drinking water and you think you're taking some medication and you heal when look at my healing this morning we're talking about god producing himself children because what happened in eden what the the the breakage in genesis 3 was not healing god lost children god lost a channel so from genesis 3 god no longer have a child amen adam started having his own children and brother abraham kept saying god doesn't want to be a grandfather but guess what in genesis 4 god became a grandfather that's your bible but i said god he has no grandfather in his program but in genesis 4 god became a grandfather something like something that was not part of his program came to manifestation if you read the book of luke and the book of matthew read the chronological of jesus christ and when you hit when you come to said it says said the son of adam i don't know who the son of god amen so said cannot if you ask said who is your father he can't say god because god was not his father his father was adam but if you ask adam who is your father adam will tell you his father is he said god so adam have a direct link to god as a father but you and i don't have that that's bro stealing right there and this brush even bro stephen look like we have so many steven in this place i know i know i shook inside i said that's another one we have so many stephen in the all over the place amen look like one goes another concern you're only stephen's in this place amen it's a beautiful name amen so so you find out that god wanted a song and and and this is serious and i pray god help us to see the seriousness of it that the beauty of the church the treasure of the church has become a reproach the treasure of the church has become your approach the treasure of the church is not the way you do your hair nobody cares about that if somebody care about that should be your husband another person who cares about how you do your hair that's the business your business and your husband's business it's not my business i don't care you do your hair that's your business and probably the person that helped you to do your hair to make money from you it's happens in business also yeah it's not it's not that's not that's not why we're here so we're here for a more serious thing than that and if we hear for something more serious than that it means the next person doesn't matter when you're having that relationship with god your wife doesn't if your wife doesn't matter when you're having that relationship with god you shouldn't be ashamed when you're having a relationship with god there should be no shame and you shouldn't even think your brain should not even work you should just come the way you are and just come before god's presence and settle your case with god don't worry always listening that's not that's not a person's business it's between you and god because god wants to have a son and you that is you and so that is your business amen i'm going to read the quotes i didn't read on wednesday because on wednesday we just got the service short and i'm just going to read the quotes and then we will we're going to the message this morning and if the musician can uh just play that the song amen i'm just going to sing a cross of uh one of the songs and i'm going to read those quotes the song says you see god and you see my father you will always be mine for all of time and you are still god i pray that song translates into your relationship with god because god is the god and he see your father but you've not known that yet you've not really understood it trust me you've known that so you've not understood christianity yet you're a christian you may have got the holy ghost you may not go to a point but you've not understood you've not understood what god has given you privilege into you've not and that's why you shall change yourself so many times that's why the devil comes to he comes to talk to you so many times because he knows you don't really understand or you you don't understand what you've got you don't understand you know you've got something but because you don't understand what you got he knows how to play with your mind [Music] he is a good business man he knows how to play with your mind because he knows you don't understand what you have but the brah didn't understood what he had also a preacher of heaven and preached of all those great evil there were there was a reality that was lacking in what he was preaching [Music] but by a preacher of heaven called prayer line call all those met the angel of god and all of that but yet he was afraid of dying because he said he thought it was going to be a spook or like a cloud floating in the air without hands to shake somebody he said i'm going to say all my nervous say oh that's a novel i don't have eyes or i don't have hands to shake him no more that's what they were thinking there was a reality beyond that that reality goes beyond just intellectual preaching and all of that god have to open the great divide take him beyond the cutting of time and when he came back his side will never be the same again he said i will never be the same again because why he saw a tangible land he said to feel the people they hug me and when he came back to this dimension he said because there is a land beyond the river he can sing that song without a melody but with reality [Music] that there is a land beyond the river i have been there and i'm back [Music] when i was a child [Music] i heard a beautiful story [Music] how you love me so you died on cavalry [Music] he things i won't change my love is the same you still love to me oh you still know you see my father [Music] [Music] oh you [Music] almost [Music] oh you still know [Music] you always be mine for a long time amen you [Music] low [Music] amen [Music] oh [Music] i feel [Music] amen [Music] you still my [Music] hello [Music] you always be mine for all of time why do music keep playing what abraham said in the message the sermon of spirit [Music] but that's not what the gates of hell is against the gates of hell is not against your job that's what motivational gospel has brought to us the gaze of hell is not against your your the house you want to buy it's not against your mortgage it could use that as distraction it's against just one thing [Music] but that's not what the gains of hell is against it's against the spiritual revelation of christ being here the only thing the devil is against is not against your job [Music] it's not against the business you're trying to put up it's against the spiritual revelation that christ is here they say yesterday today and forever that is the only thing it's a dates i'm going to make use of time quickly as that song keep playing let's rise up [Music] you still [Music] you see [Music] you've [Music] for all [Music] amen god bless you that will be all the singing we have this morning let's turn to the book of luke we're going to be reading luke chapter luke chapter 18. let's say praise the lord amen if anybody will praise the lord it's going to be you and me because we have every reason to praise he who show us who we really are we don't really know ourself and that's what we're trying to talk about this morning because the devil knows that and he's trying to play on our mind because he knows we don't really know who we are so he often plays that's that's a key position he wants to stay on he doesn't care if you're speaking dog if you cast that devil because you know after you're done with that jubilee you're going to come back to that ignorance of who you are he knows that after that wonderful special number after you play that drum in the spirit after you've played that piano in the spirit after you've sanded everything he knows that you will come out of that presence to your ignorance he knows that and he's waiting for you so when you're done with all those jumping around he's waiting and then he start to speak to you and try to tell you who you are not and he knows you are he knows you will accept he said he's been in that business for years it begin to tell you who you are not and then your brain starts walking and then you begin to keep condemination upon yourself and then it tells you you just did this don't come to church and then you listen and you stay home you just see the other one it's called don't answer the phone and then you don't answer the phone oh the dickies are coming go through this way you saw the dick in the walmart hide and you hide and then he begin to bring more unfaithfulness in your life he knows how to play the game but you just got to be smarter than the devil and the only way you can be smarter than the devil is to focus on one thing who are you you may not speak and talk you may not perform nothing when you know you are you have found the greatest gift it's your identity everything will be taken away from you there's only one thing that nobody can take away from you they can take away your rights which they're already taken away but they cannot take away your identity let's say praise the lord they can't take away your identity they can take away your right you think you own your house you don't i was writing a quote to my wife we're driving to church i just read that quote to her from church eight book i said see this house we don't own it we'll be driving back from church the government could pass a law and won't be able to get into that house no more but we still have our identity no law can take away that isn't proceeding you just no during covey you see a little bit of it that the government can push you to the world they can bring more laws because they in covet sit that way sit away from your wife some husband believer would shake their wife so why belly wanted their husband to shake their head you see that's how man can fit into your life and give you laws you follow and the devil knows how to do that but no matter all those laws know who you are so that when everything is taken away you know who you are god bless you church let's read the book of luke chapter 18 we're starting him from verse 1 and then we'll go to genesis before rescue let's bow down our heads almighty god any man can flip open these pages and speak motivational words but lord may you find entrance into our heart this morning this is our desire blessed master in jesus gracious then we pray amen and and and speak this parable unto satan whis trusted in what that's i'm reading luke 18 verse 9 and respect this parable unto certain we structured in what they trust in themselves that they wear what and what okay so these guys are trusted in themselves now the trust that they have in themselves is that they wear what righteousness and they despise others now you're going to find out righteousness is not trusting in yourself it goes a long way from that now but this this parable jesus is giving is about those who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and they despise others we're going to continue from where we stop on wednesday with the condition for sunday it's not just jumping or shouting i'm not worried about you jumping but i'm worried about god finding entrance to your heart and my heart that's what we're here for it's not just the emotional part of it it's about us living here with weapons to beat the devil it's not beating them by singing song but beating devout of your own life that's what we're talking about so the same beating devil is not beating the devil in the brother he's beating the devil out of your own life that's what we're talking about so you find out here these two men say and the speaker speak this parable unto satan which trusted in himself that they were righteous and despise others two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other republican the pharisee stood and prayed to us with himself god i thank thee that i am not as old men are extortionary unjust a daughter or even as this republican there were two of them in the church that day this this republican i fast twice in the week i keep tight of all that i possess and the republicans standing afar off it was far it was starting to far off the republicans standing up far off would not lift up so much as his eyes onto heaven but smooth upon his breasts saying god be merciful to me a sinner see the public can recognize the presence it was in he recognized where it was in so he stood that far off and he let us say lord be merciful to me a sinner when you come into god's presence what are you going to be saying will you be beating your chest or you'll be asking for mercy i tell you this man went i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be a base and he that humble at himself shall be exalted let's turn to the book of genesis chapter 15. genesis 50 will read from verse 1. after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abraham i am thy shield under a seating great reward can you imagine you just wake up in the morning bro stephen all these tvs now amen you just wake up in the morning and you just hear god say i am your shield brother aaron i'm your exceeding great reward oh man you don't need to go to work that day you know what i'm saying just like oh yeah we could we could call it we could call it off today look at the rapture it's going to happen right now because god telling you that not the pastor saying god himself communicating that to you i am your sealed and i am your exceeding great reward now when god was done with that what would we have expected i said my abraham would have had some jubilee but that's not what happened here and abraham said lord god what would that give me god already said i am your reward but say see you see i told you the devil knows you very well he knows how to beat your head it's his job he said he said and abraham said lord god what would that give me see i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliza of damascus and abram said beyond to me thou has given no seed and lord one born in my house is my hair and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine hair but he that shall comfort out of that own bowel shall be done here and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed the lord and what now think of you shall be seated now you may be seated right now you see the irony of those two scriptures some trusted in themselves that they were what they didn't stop there they trusted in themselves that they were righteous and they condemn all that they despise others so there is something that make them to trust in themselves they didn't just wake up from themselves say oh no there's something that made them to do that something placed them in that platform or that pedestal where they feel they can trust themselves and they can despise others now brother brown was saying in the church book he said the cycle of revival and of death has never ceased ecclestic would say there is no new thing under the sun now what has happened before is what will happen again but just new characters playing the same old script so we find out here in the scripture we just read the lord jesus gave us these two men who went to the temple to pray and one of them he came just as he was but the other fellow he didn't come just as he he didn't come he didn't sing that song anyway he came justifying himself because he think he was doing something that makes him righteous so because of that he despised this other man this i'm not just like this man i do this i do that and he was counting all he was doing i paid my time and all this man was saying he was correct he was correct in all he was saying amen and we follow the story we follow the story and we pick out these two these two characters in in verse 9 to 14 of luke and we have the story of the pharisee and we have the story of republican so this story is going to swim all this way and it's going to enter chapter 19 where brother brown would take the message uh zacchaeus the businessman and all many of those messages about circus will be from chapter 19. now you're going to see something very interesting in chapter in chapter 18 in verse 18 of chapter 18. now let's look at 18 uh uh 18 18. i'm going to lay the scripture first and then we'll go into the message 18 18 has this to say and a certain word ruler asks him saying good master what shall i do to what do i do on board so he say good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life now this man he he wanted to know what he needed to do to inherit eternal life that's why he left his house that was a quest in his heart what do i what have i got to do i want to do something to inherit eternal life now watch this young man and watch the man in in uh uh chapter chapter 18 verse 11. watch that man in chapter 18 verse 11 and watch this young man like i told you this story is going to snake its way all the way into chapter 19. and jesus said unto him why colors thou mean good not as good save one that is god that knows the commandment do not commit adultery what did this man say in chapter chapter 18 verse 11 what is this what was he saying did he say it wasn't a daughter did he hear him say that oh yes he said it he said it the pharisees stood and prayed to us within himself saying god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortionate just what is next you see there i'll talk right that's what he said he said it so follow carefully we're going somewhere and that we're going inside the bible that's where we're going we're taking a journey now we see this young man because jesus just told you a parable and that reality is setting into the parable and he's done telling this parable and then we see a really strong man and this man wants to have eternal life and they say master what do i need to do and jesus begin to tell him what he needs to what he he should have been doing thou knowest the commandment do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness another father and a mother and he said what all these have i came from my youth up this man has kept all these commandments from his youth up and still he knew there was a vacuum about the question of eternal life nobody knew that nobody knew that when they see himself this brother is very lovely he's very obedient he's very kind he respect his father he's always in service he pays his dad he's offering he doesn't run about with the women out there and all of that he has a good testimony but himself there is something he knows that nobody knows but today he took the challenge to to go for a quest what will i do to fill that gap what's this question what will i do to have eternal life now what he was expecting is another task but what needs to be done to have eternal life you're going to find out that there is no task that man has to do it is what god has done what man needs to do will be living on god just lean on god god has done it you just have to lean on him that's it but man doesn't want that man i want to do something so i can he just just say i i i prayed that was why my wife was pregnant oh yeah you prayed very well so those who who didn't get their wife pregnant they didn't pray their prayer didn't go above the roof so ma wanna ma one will tell every success that i did something this happened cause an effect that's what you want to do so grace begin to evade him but he doesn't know that he's beginning i i do this when i do this this happened there is nothing you're going to do to bring down god there is nothing it is the mercy of god that will always visit you so as much as you can get yourself out of the way when you get yourself out of the way you're not doing anything anyway but when you are in the way you are doing a whole lot so when you can get out of the way then god can come in the way and do what he needs to do [Music] so can we get out of the way this morning so this the lord told him and he said all these i have kept from my youth up now when jesus said these things he said unto him yet lackett's doubt one thing sell all that thou has and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall did have riches enter into the kingdom of god some of us think that he's talking about dollars no you could be reaching pride you could be rich in arrogancy and you can also be rich in religion and prayerlessness you could have zillions of of of prayerless attributes in your life i say let us pray you want to channel the cross and run out of your ass like a like a candle that is shot out of a cannon i cannot bust out of canon that's assimilates prey that's what i was devoting oh god guide me my job got me and you're already holding your key already open the car hello guide me guide me guys and you are driving to your office are you sure you're going to reach your office how about you settle down and talk to the lord before you get out of that house so even if you don't come back home you know that the last thing you did was to talk to your creator that should be the last thing you did oh lord i bless you lord it's give me bless me give me bless me that's the prayer that we have reduced our creator to we have reduced gold to sam's club where we go to shop give me help me bless me give me open this open that close up about i lose that's what we've reduced go to no relationship now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet like as thou yeah yeah yeah yeah luck has that one thing sell all that house and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they have riches enter into the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through the through a needle eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and then i heard it said who dare can be saved look at where many responders there that is this is serious who they can be saved and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god then peter said lord now listen to peter quickly because he know that he has followed the script to this point and peter said lord we have left all and followed him see somebody somebody fit the description we have left all and we have followed thee and they said unto them verily i say unto you you that have left all and i follow there's something for you also very last song told you there is no man that have left houses or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of god's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time so when your focus shifts from those things and your focus come to the things of god god is telling you you will receive manifold he said we shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting see that's what his mom was looking for that's what he was looking for and so we we go back to our readings on wednesday because we're going to blend it all like i said it's going to be a continuation and we're reading the the gospel of matthew chapter 10 in mark chapter 6 and luke chapter 10 verse versus luke chapter 9 verse 1. in india we read matthew 10 verse 1 he said when he had called on to him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases now slow down as we read that scripture and just hear me carefully just hear me carefully i see there were some requests that was brought this morning abroad dan was reading those requests and and the church prayed for those requests now he said this is jesus the lord jesus speaking and when he had called unto him 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirit the first thing you have to deal with before you talk about divine healing is some clean spirits that's the first thing you're going to deal with it's a clean spirit it says so is to cast them out and to heal all manner of sicknesses and all manner of diseases you see when you cast out unclean spirit from your life then you have confidence in god remember saying if our act condemned us not amen then we know that when we ask something we will receive and so what the devil tries to do many times is to bring condemnation to your heart because once he can bring condemnation to your heart he knows that when you are praying you it can tweak you you will never believe the prayer you will pray under the anointing as soon as you get out of that place he begins to bring elements of deceit that will make you to begin to disbelieve what you have just prayed for and the bible says without faith it is impossible to please god god does not answer your prayer based on your face he does not answer your prayer based on your membership in the church he does not answer your prayer because you are a preacher he does not answer your prayer because you are a prophet you only answer your prayer on the basis of faith without faith it is impossible to please god if you want to please god is you must have faith if you don't have faith is upset with you this is a serious talk right and look at what he talks about he said all you fools swords of heart to what believe you see she was addressing his disciples he full sources little faith because without faith it is impossible to please god is that a scripture i think so i think it's a scripture i think so that's that sounds like the book of hebrews right amen is without faith it is no you see we read some scriptures i thought that the amenities about yourself you don't even know just like the disciples they understood christianity as they moved because they were deep rooted into judaism when the holy ghost came the only gods did not just wash them like a glorious and once away their brain no they still have their mental faculty they're supposed to grow into an understanding they have received an experience with god in their heart they're supposed to grow with their experience into an understanding of how to live their life but they were carrying a borrowed culture they were still doing sabbath they were still going to temple they were still doing all those things even when the lord jesus said the hour comment and now is that the true worshiper which will be the disciples that will receive the holy ghost not caiaphas and anas and the pharisees no no the true worshipper you see there will not worship the father in the temple or in the mountain like samaritans you see the body will worship the father and world in spirit and in truth anywhere you don't have to be in a beauty no more it's in spirit and in truth so don't let your revival always be on sunday and wednesday prayer meeting your development should be everywhere you go and we talk about divine healing people oh thought potato thought was not some hollywood movie thought poor has been before but abram came in case you don't know that right oh but abraham spoke school into existence that's not a new thing that happened you said what are you talking about go and listen to the message paradox and but the brain was showing us paradox right from the old testament into the day we living palace is a supernatural event that breaks the law of nature and you cannot really fathom it in your mind and one of the paradox what abraham gave us is how a man will speak to the moon and the sun and god obey his voice [Music] and so but the blood spoke to existence that's not even so great because the brown spokes couldn't resistance under the blood of jesus christ moses spoke fleeing to resistance under the brother boost and of course so just in common too this man is speaking interested under the blood of god himself but this man is speaking under under the blood of goat who has more faith to express he's the man that has the blood of god because it's not the blood of god but abram was under the blood of christ and he spoke something into existence but the problem is we have all tied into abort abraham but we are not tied into god's expression it's god's expression it's not but abraham knows god's expression that's why we have misunderstood why god sent buddha abraham because we are gentiles that's how gentiles are we make idol out of anything that comes our way even our toothpick you use one toothpick and you keep keeping it keeping it they are still burnt small inside the the package three they will say no i love it i just i just like the way it's clean i just like doing just try nothing see this is the life we live in we make i do out of every little thing there's an old saying a friend of mine used to say you see when you when you say i must i must i must get the satisfaction uh that i must get the money what out of this clothes that i'm wearing he said to turn you to the madman because if you buy that suit two million dollars he said i'm not i've not yet worried two million dollar word and you keep wearing it they say pasha you stitch it you see this coat is very expensive i must the money that i bought i must i must i must get the feeling out of it and it got turned this way you stitch it at the end of it or you'll be putting on rag because you're trying to get the value out of it so we find out that as you read the scriptures say he gave unto them what power the power is to take out unclean spirit once there is no clean spirit there you can relate with god because the problem why you are not related with god effectively is because of unclean spirits something you have done they have made you to do and and then they bring those condemnation upon you now they say don't come to us don't do this and don't do that don't even don't even show your face you are not even worthy don't even read the bible don't even pray you are condemned you are going to hell and you begin to listen to that voice and you think it is you that is thinking it it's not you thinking somebody's talking to you amen so we say we didn't say on wednesday that when you go home there was an assignment for everybody and i was surprised my mass daughter came to me gracie came to me said he said bro stephen what is the message church the young lady wanted to search on clean spirit that serious happening somebody is listening and when she said i was like my goodness i said when you go home search not just only the message search the scripture type the word unclean spirit and when you type it look at your life don't look at it don't look at your wife because most of the time you know us brother i want to want to show it that you are the minister your wife is the unbeliever you know you want to work on her god has told you to work on her to make her a bride and you forget that jesus is not marrying you you are part of the bride also yeah this is the reality this is the reality and we have a lot of distance to creep in and we we brought loose air and but the problem said the seventh engine message was to tie up the loose end and we are creating more loose end again in our family in our day-to-day life we're creating more loose ends the message and the minister of willem brown was to tie up the loose end and bring it to us as the word of god because luther has a loose end to how he saw god he didn't really see god in his clarity that's why he smoked pipe and drank beer why was interpreting the bible today if you see one of your dickens drinking beer and smoking pipe you you know that something has gone wrong with the church you better find an exit and be running for your life but luther did that that was half i saw god in the relationship and god was god was okay with what relationship was having with luta he was not okay with the beer and the the pipe he was smoking but god was okay with the relationship he was having with luta because you know that that was a foundation that was leading to something else and it led to something else uh john wesley came up and said we must sanctify our life we can't smoke pot you see god led into something else and we still begin to preach sanctification and all of that and then that was not the end of it i said we don't just have to live a clean life we must also be able to express the attribute of god miracles that are coming we call it a pentecostal and uh but the brain will come saying it's not just miracles and all of that god have is identified by his characteristic the miracle and all those things have to vindicate the world [Music] so you can have miracle and that miracle does not vindicate nothing and you can also have miracle that miraculous confirming something now but the difference between both abraham and many ministries you see today is that they have miracles about abraham have there's no miracle but abraham have that somebody have not have and someone is not having today but the difference is that god is giving this miracle to show you that i'm bringing out the clarity of the scripture through this man that's what god is bringing down but this man somebody just believed god and god healing to that person so if this man bene or any of this pentecostal minister if they ever throw a challenge what are you say if what i have been preaching all these years if it is not true god don't hit the nobody will be healed because god will never vindicate lie it will not be getting error will only vindicate truth so while people don't understand and that's why i feel sorry for people who say oh but abraham but plagiarized and brother abraham did this and now they are going back to pentecost when we say pentecost not the bible now we're talking about the the pentacles that we have all these speaking tongue and all this gimmick the handwriting that's on the wall that's actually what they're going to babylon so they think they begin to give you male likes meat we go sword and all these people these men had miracles but not according to the scriptures they didn't throw a challenge on god saying for i am preaching you can't preach trinity i said god if this is not true if this is true let this people walk the people will not walk because god is not free amen it will never work god will only vindicate his word he will not vindicate your creed somebody might say well so why are these words even healing god is honoring somebody's fate but if this man challenge god god will not heal this person because if god healed that person it means god is saying this doctrine is the truth but what's brother brown after but the brown finish preaching the message but abraham said if what i have said is the truth he will come down to vindicate it time and time and time and time and time and time and time so that is why i used to say this i don't waste my time to try to prove the cloud scientifically right if you are science degree that's right for you because when you can prove god it's no longer safe you have to believe god so why do i believe it because this man truly god is what i have said if it is the truth come down and vindicate it and god came down okay so simple if you say this man is lying that's a tall rocket i don't even care what joshua said because just was not there when god gave me the message amen some of the old judgment said this joshua said uh people will be surprised one day that it's a tall rocket i don't care even what will the paul say because billy paul was not the one i believe the message bill paul did not bring the message to me just not bringing the message to me billy because abram did not bring the message to me i blessed god for them that they also saw the same message i saw that's what makes us brothers amen but they didn't bring it to me we are brothers that's that i'm glad i have brothers like that i'm i'm so glad i'm so privileged that i have breasts like that but it did not bring the message to me god brought it to me god brought it to everyone in here in different ways amen but you got to see that it is god that brought it to you because if you don't see that as god that brought it to you if the man that through whom god used if that might begin to find in some way then you will follow that man but when you can see that this is god that came to talk to me when i was a catholic priest it was god that came to talk to me you are not seeing that man if that man says i'm going back today to be a catholic christian father i say go and may god prosper your way that's why you're going but as for me and my husband will serve the lord [Music] god will not vindicate hidden dogma so if brother stephen if somebody saying no but abraham said this it's not true and said this happens and so they it's not true we don't have to argue too much all we need to do is you go ahead and and present it the way you want to present it and call god on the scene right it's not it's america is full of intellectual devils intellectual devils you can't go to the jungle of africa and meet some old lady in liberia or nigeria be saying you know the torah case he doesn't even know what hurricane is you know about the stubborn pot to cook food should i have time for that foolishness she don't have time for that foolishness that you're talking about she only knows about the daily life she's living are you talking about some tall rockets all those scientific grammars because she should be looking at you like a fool and that's what you are the fool has said in this side there is no god amen you become so smart until you have become a fool so go ahead talk about what you want to talk about say what abraham is first and when you are done don't end it there don't don't get some clap call god down yes because this man after any time he talked about oh he said those seven ninjas came down and they formed that cloud and said oh lord if i have said the truth you will come down to vindicate it he's here god you you after you say he lied you come tell us that he's here and let's see how it flows it's as simple as that we don't have to waste time you don't have to listen okay let me watch this video about atlanta no no no no no and don't go into fighting with those people that want to make you a christian let everybody go their way and live their own life if you see those brothers in the road hug them shake their hand they are your brothers they say god jesus you just said no i believe that for abraham is the one that god made used to make the bible play that's fine they see your brothers according to matthew 25 there were five virgins that were blind so they were sick virgins my body were blind so you should give god praise that you're not blind and don't don't worry about that man just keep giving god praise what god is doing for you that way you will not have attitude towards people you will not have unclear spirit coming into your whole life because of my unclean spirit we want to get rid of them because the bible we haven't said it this way is he a merry heart he led faster than what medicine amen that's what the bible said when you can get that evil spirit at a merry heart he led faster than medicine that's the scripture in the book of proverbs so get all these devils don't worry about that man open abraham he said that okay that's your revelation we're all fine god bless you let's i'm still moving on on this road as we see we are mashing the zion there are so many zion there's zion illuminati maybe that's where you're going to but i imagine don't know that's high on you just say it that way just just allow your life to be moving smoothly don't don't put pressure and quality no no no we are marshmallows right now we are singing that song you could be going to zion indiana i'm going to spiritual scion but we call it zion you and i were calling in zion so i don't know desire you're going to but i know the zion i am going to so i should not be arguing with you i don't know where you're going when you and i enter our mata i don't know what's going to fit your your your your cut i don't know i don't know what's up what about that i should worry about what took me into that place and that's what's worried about what brought you in the relationship with god so we find out i think we struck that on on wednesday and now i wanted to come back to it and this one please when it comes to the play there are many holy people there are many holy people brother ariel there are many old holy people but lawrence many holy people brother brother max holy people bro bill in the catholic church in case you don't know that don't think that because we message don't even use that language we mess it because you are making the denomination but abraham said whomever but i must say whoever that bride is is a word an individual he said perhaps it's not a group of people it's an individual and what abraham said the new bed is the revelation of jesus christ to an individual it's not for you no to you and so that reversal come to abrasive a comfortable area a comfortable mask any complicated bible we express the same thing hence we gather that's what brings us together because we met the same god and he brought us together is that right he brought us together now we find that there are many holy people in all the structures yes don't let the devil deceive that they are not holy because it's holiness holiness is when you separate yourself unto god but that's not the end of your work with god so there are many people who has had an experience with god in the baptist church in the seven day adventists and in the catholic church and all those structures they have separated themselves onto god they don't smoke they don't smoke because they don't like the cigarette no they don't smoke because they have a dealing with god that make them to think i shouldn't do that that's what make them holy but they are not righteous right amen righteousness and holiness are two different things this man on the altar was telling himself he was thinking of himself that i am what i am righteous and he was despising others he's thinking he said that i am righteous i told you thinking does not make you righteous i think it can make you holy but it does not make you righteous but this man was thinking in himself that i am righteous and this man is not good it's not where it has come to today many of us say oh we are messing a believer that man is not this and you will see some baptist people that live more godly like that you are your condemning them amen you see some evil some pentacles are people who live more better life than you and you are condemning them they may have not seen that god said the prophet but they have a life you don't have amen amen amen oh it's abrasiving you you you're going to the wrong road now no it's the road you're supposed to go to so righteousness and holiness are two different things time will fail me to bring some few characters in the bible abimelech was it was he was serving god in all holiness have you asked yourself what is the difference between abimelech and abraham the worship of the same god few years later bruh stephen goliath will come out from that that country because ghat is one of the territories of the philistines and the king of the philistines one time was a godly man happy birth few years later they became idol worshiper but at that time of abraham abby malek worshiped god god came down to talk to him but years later god became their gone how did this happen how did it happen that a people that had a relationship with god came down and talked to abimelech that was he he had a relationship with god i said god you know the integrity of my heart i would depart from it i'm holy and god said yes that's why i didn't kill you because you would have been dead so i didn't kill you because you you you live a holy life you wouldn't take this man's wife if you know he's his wife so i will i will i permit you i pardon you for that they say you see god brother steve was not emphasizing on abraham abraham why did you like that's not that's not part of the discussion god told abimelech he said happy meal go and meet that man he's a prophet let him pray for you if he doesn't pray for you you are finished not only you your entire nation is gone amen so go meet him now does that justify now praise god amen we can lie if you lie you it shows who you are that does not justify life because you see that lie that abraham light went on to isaac also isaac also take the same life but it's quite a logical lie [Music] it's a logical lie yeah because when abraham was talking about it he said yes he's my sister but from a different mother to justify what is the question was not whether she's your sister from a different mother is she your wife no she's not my wife that's the question the question was plain is she your wife no she's not my wife because you cannot marry somebody's ex-wife that was why they were asking him that question he said your wife no she's not my wife okay i can't have her now they took her away but it's a logical lie and brother brown would like that same logical lie his lawyer would be calling him i'm saying look like oh i have a broken loose and that that task case was almost running him crazy and brother brown said tell him i'm not in here he told his wife to to lie say tell him i'm not in here. and then i said billy and then he jumped out of the house am i there it's logical it's logical but they still lie because you went out to say you are not eating and but the brain will say this way he said not only did i sin against god i made my wife to do it also now watch carefully we'll talk about clean spirit we want to follow it from the prophet so maybe that will humble many of us did he get on by abraham to lie it's a clean spirit i know some people they remember abraham god said oh wow we're just going to beat our blessing when he come out of the church he has insulted our god if you go to some places they will beat you up for saying that but we're talking about god's word what is about true christianity that god sent a prophet to open our eyes so see clearly and brother abraham will go and be praying for somebody because take your ass off you hypocrite right see you cannot minister you see what the scripture said there after you have casted on clean spirit then you can heal all manner of diseases but he was trying to heal all manner of diseases without casting that unclean are you spirit me at all i don't know if you follow me carefully because this is you are me we are we are amen the angel of god said take your hands off you rebuild abraham and abraham told the boy's father say he said excuse me i have something to do what to make right i have something to make right how many of us have someone to make right this morning what are you waiting for i'm going to do this here i'm going to do this you may not have ness yet but i say i'm going to have i have a son to make right and problem drove to the to the lord's place that's what i said when i when you called i was actually in the house oh my gosh do you know the thoughts that was running through the brain's mind at that point in time the devil said your ministry will end yeah after you are done they will say you are lying when you are saying the truth so you are afraid this drug don't god if you tell that man they will say the prophet of the hour it will be new york times it will be in cnn that will improve life you see the devil if it was just easy that but the blood just went to that man the devil was speaking to his mind the same way the devil speaks to your mind not to make your wrong right to keep that unclean spirit but for you to cast out unclean spirit you must have hatred for it amen you must hear it you must have any if you miss about cleanness that have slipped into your life if you don't hear it it will remain there and if you don't hear it ask god to give you hatred there's a quote for that but abraham said god create hatred for sin in my heart oh yes that's what the brahman said he said create hatred for sin in my heart he said because sin is appealing so you need the grace of god to create hatred for that appealing to him you must be honorable since that we must be on board don't just carry out we are we we are only something by his grace well something by his grace so you find out there that people are holding these choices so holiness is when you separate something when something is separated onto the lord that thing becomes holy that's what you have in the temple you have holy vessel holy veil uh holy lantern because they downtime just like any other lantern but what make it holy was because he separated it unto the lord the holy vessels in the house of god that uh better says her we used to drink wine and the hand of god would come down and write on the world men and men had to kill for sin and all of that the reason that you call it a holy vessel is because that vessel was made by was named basilia uh the craftsman who was very skillful in artificial work of brass and all of that god would give moses uh this inscription tell him how to make it and i would give them vision see god we show them why it is in heaven and this man will replicate those vessels on earth and they will separate them to the house of god that make that cup a holy cup it's not because they wrote holy on it it's because it was separated for god's use that's why it's holy but it's not righteous because writer said it take one thing to make something righteous and you know what it is believe abraham believed god and it was what counted to him for righteousness paul we pick that same scripture and show that we are also children of faith abraham so the same road abraham passed is the same road you are now we are passing we believe god that's what make us righteous but that's not what makes you holy because righteousness is what god does for you amen holiness is a fight you will fight every day righteousness is what god does for you like what abraham would say salvation is a free gift but i said character is not a gift it's a victory you must win every day and to be holy it's not a gift you must fight every day with this devil but the problem one place he was saying is i was telling my wife i find a critical spirit coming on me that's what the realm said right and he said church he not brought it to his church he said church pray for me i don't want that thing on me oh man you see what i'm saying but abraham himself death with this unclean spirit he said i don't want that thing or me how many of us want to know this morning okay but some of us have it if not all of us but do you hate it you don't that's not the end of your story you can ask god to give you hatred you see god made permission on both sides of the fence when you pray and you don't feel faith you don't feel enough grace to believe ask god to give you faith don't just let it be like i try and miss no ask god to give you faith we serve a living god when we've done what we need to do when we've cleaned all these devils that are bordered our mind when our heart does not condemn us the opposite there will no god answer but when you are condemned the bible says god is greater than your heart amen we're going to be closing i'm just going to read some few quotes we're going to be drawing it to the close amen i'm going to read a quote from the message recognizing your day on this message i'll be paragraph 83 but abram said why do we do that why do we do that they want a great awakening that's what everybody's talking about oh there's going to be a great revival thought pool and all of this all of that thoughtful is just the life of god in the believer in the third realm that's it it's not something falling from the sky it's not some new discovery from pluto no it's the same christianity that has always been and but abraham only used different terminology as it relates to our generation that's it but i'm saying whatever and are working to be awakening they are good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride these are good people this is what i'm talking about brother and sister more jack moore of shreveport louisiana he said by being christians they feed the pool of the hour but they haven't recognized what ha what what's been done see they just really prove but they don't know what is going on in reality oh there's going to be a great survivor there's going to be this they're going to be dead that's because they're christians they're christians that's why they are feeling that but they're missing something that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they are looking for it way off in the future to come when it is already happening right by you they're looking way far away when it's already happening right by you but abram is going to tell us in the message feast of the trumpet and he's going to tell us that the holy ghost was bound by what the river of creed and dogma from reaching the people now what really happened what i'm talking about but bruh was talking about the book of acts which is not the act of the apostles is the act of the holy spirit in the apostles that brother steve was truncated and but the brown would tell us in the church book how it happened he said it was crooked ministries he said the word that was used there is nika nico later you see they begin to conquer the lady they begin to make them feel that it is only through the preachers that god can be seen that's the love of the devil see the reason god called uh uh your brother one uh brother uh ariel or any of the ministry that you all go to see a team protest or any ministry that's ever passed away the reason god called him is to be a servant i have not seen where servants beat their chest before the master's children but in this generation it's happening amen the servants want to become the lord so we all suffer that's about that's about all the story is and someone to show you who you really are that is the the meant is to show you who you are and that's how we cut through thick and peace just to show you who you are because you don't know who you are some of us think that we are we are meant to be going to club houses some of us think that we are just out there to have five jobs and not come to church that's what we think but my job is to fight trunatic darkness to grab you and show you you are beyond dollar sign that's my job when i need that and i pray it is god show him who he is because when you can know you are then there will be no pressure anymore it's good the time is going to come that's not going to be preaching in the millennium because we've known who we are we are in training we are so all the purpose ephesians 5 is that god sent us 5-4 ministry for what our identification so that you can see who you are in the scriptures you can be able to see clearly so when you open the bible you are not just reading stories you are actually seeing the manuscript of your life and so you are you are looking back to page and looking at yourself just like that was praying in the morning when we read the bible we see ourselves in every story when your spirit your life manifested through somebody that day you will see it nobody may see it your wife may not see it but that will hit you boom and if you read that scripture intellectually you will not see it that's why trust listen don't read the bible in haste if you don't have time make time right but don't ever read the bible in haste don't if you have two minutes spend that two minutes to read if you don't have two minutes don't just open to it and then you are running no no spend time create time because when you treat the bible in a sacred way that is the only way you can get something sacred from it you're wondering why we're not seeing it why is this not happening why is that not happening why this is not happening look josh healing can happen anytime in your life this is why i told the church back home i say any time bro jordan any time you feel the presence of the pillar of fire ask god for the impossible you could be in your bathroom singing when it comes down you don't have to be in the church you could be your car singing when it comes down you cover me in your office doing your job and then it comes down when it comes down ask god for the impossible [Music] that is how it has always been you want to go ask god that thing you feel that is so impossible to overcome ask god for it it could be in the service it could even be walmart oh yes yes and you never say glory to god hallelujah and they say she's crazy that's what they said but they don't know that any man that's not crazy is not a living being every living being is crazy who's not crazy here this morning raise up your hand okay that's what i said we are crazy people everybody from the presidency to the high class we all crazy brother you're laughing your boss is crazy too and i bet don't tell him that he's gonna he's gonna get get a bad shape everybody's crazy somebody told one i said you're really crazy i said of course i said you just don't know you crazy too i said but we are crazy for different things some are crazy for money some are crazy for drugs some are crazy for women some are crazy fulfilled but i'm crazy for god we are crazy people we are living in a world full of maniac but who who is making you a maniac that is the question because there is something you're doing somebody look at you say this man is crazy and he's also doing something you look at he said this woman is so crazy and so everybody calling israel crazy you want to be crazy for the right thing so you just see these two young men i'm trying to background on this one now and and i'm almost getting to the close the time already making me nervous because i feel i feel we already closed back home so but we're going to bring it to the good clothes and god we bless our heart with the word he said we're cussing yesterday bro one bro simon peter we're talking i said it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be breathtaking now bring it i'm not able to finish this message today i'm not i'm not worried about it amen you know why because god has a ministry you see the devil has deceived people that i am the one that can talk it better you are just being foolish because you are not the one that wants you to begin with it is you talking when you are giving motivational speeches 17 steps to become a rich man 14 step or not to control your home if you want to know all those steps read your bible amen otherwise you'll be spending your hard earned dollars on silly books 14 steps on how to become a remodel all those steps are in here and if you don't understand that listen to the tape right it will explain what those steps are and we cannot spend money on books and then before you know it we are spending money on books you buy those books we never have time to read it right let me touch one of those from clean spirit this word is a very wicked one amen many of us know it has come on us many times the preacher will be preaching bro steve i said you always go bro steve because we have so many stephens here amen and brother bill we'll try that we could try that we could try josh also and we could try emmanuel and god's will amen there's this devil brother steve that if you're not careful with it it's a religious one because the most wicked of all devils is a religious spirit now watch this brought jordan height operate the ministry come to preach as soon as the minister is on the puppet bringing the word of god this unclean spirit comes on you it diverts your hearing from hearing what the minister is saying you are writing what the minister said on a piece of paper instead of what the minister said going into you and showing you who you are you are actually putting all those information in a paper and when the service is over you go home and you throw that paper in one corner you may never see it again until you die now the word of god was not made for the paper the quickening power was meant to go into you and bring fruit but now you put the quickening power on the piece of paper and you're talking that paper somewhere and that's all about the paper and you do it service after service after service and when you look at yourself it was a glorious meeting what was preached you can't even remember the title everything's just some clean spirit it comes from people all the time as soon as the minister start talking some people that's when they are reading their bible they cross their leg amen and when they leave here they go home they never see their bible you see you see this we're nothing about prostitute no no these are the wicked devils that when the word of god is coming to show you who you are you already know these stories that you're not paying attention to those stories but you're just reading them how many of us have felt that before amen all right sure we have christians in here that's what make us christians if you guess you don't know because the value of the church has been watered down their treasure has become their reproach it used to be that men women will honestly come to the altar and confess before god people will actually come just as they are and god will touch there but what do we have now actors pharisees that's what the brother said he said pharisees write that quote on the puppy the other day one was translating for him he said i wonder i will only get the people to god i will get them to the church now after this the beginning of brother brown ministry one of the key thing god gave him was a condition and that condition is a condition that helps him regulate these devils amen what was the condition if only thou would be sincere it's only sincerity that will make you come just the way you are if only that will be sincere nothing will be able to stand before your prayer not even cancer church listen to this why is it that when you pray things stand before your prayer i'm not saying maybe you are not sincere you are not sincere if you are sincere it gives you boldness to approach god you are not particular say i do that no no you are approaching god say father i am here this is my need but when you are not sincere before you go to god something is coming you did this you did that you did this and he said well lord we thank you heal heart you know your heart that you have not even prayed that uncleanness in there it will damage so many things in your work with god the fascinating damage is the fear of god it was very dangerous it would damage the fear of god and look at the church today everyone is so happy and all of a sudden what abraham said in christmas of god review he said the devil we shoot somebody in the church with a toxin and then before you know it opera comes in the church if they don't let me speak in this church the stress will scatter ask yourself can you be saved and you desire god's word to go in robots you want the house of god to go it's red if you don't now now let's go down now let's come back to the scripture what possibly could do that a sinker told us i the eye disease i will do this i will if i will do that i will do this i will sit in the house of god i will preach the great message i will when i preach it when they let me i i i i the eye disease brought the devil down the eye disease took away the fear of god and he was not concerned about the kingdom no more he wasn't to wreck anything that stands on his way brother if the eye disease come on you you are not finished you can come just the way you are i say lord i have contacted the eye disease something is telling me if i don't preach this church should scatter how devils can it get you see we're talking about religious devils now he did not let me preach in this church he did not let me on the platform look wow so let's ask a question what are you preaching to us with this kind of spirit who are who are you trying to preach to is he church that's why each and every one of us is our obligation to be spiritual because when you are spiritual intellectual message will not feed you nothing but everybody say you cannot get warmed by a painted fire attacks most of the some people think it's emotional song it's all in the flesh it's to play the piano playing and you you jump in and after all of that is over what kind of life will you leave that's right that's right amen i don't talk to my message yet yeah i'm going to talk to the message down isaiah chapter 1 verse 18 come now and let us reason together say the lord though your sin be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red as like crimson they shall be as wool if you will be willing and what obedience now look at that word willing obedient it's a willful obedience nobody's forcing you to obey you just doing it willingly if you are willing and obedient what will happen okay that's what i told that so if you are willing and obedient you shall eat the fruit of the land but whatever is trying to say but if you refuse and rebel you shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord has spoken it i'm going to be speaking on this morning come let us reason together an invitation to reason god is calling you and me to reason but the brahman said we are not to reason but this is the first time you're going to see god is inviting you to come and reason because you don't know who you are and that's our parents that reason with their children they are able to transfer quality attributes into those children if you don't listen with your children you'll be a detector that's right you'll be you'll be like a bully you tell them what to do they don't know why they are doing it but when you sit with them and you listen with them you find how effective it is that when you are not there they know why they shouldn't do it but when you bully them they are only seeing your bullying they don't know why they shouldn't do it and the nature of man is always towards venture the moment you say don't do it they want to go and do it right away but when you can sit down and reason with them when god can sit down and reason with you to show you why divine healing is laying in front of you but in your mind like oh if i was in brother brahm's time i would have just gone say abraham have this cancer i will just pass through the prayer line you see we are some of us were living in that that time i thought i was going to speak on today but the lord was dragging me to this scripture here jesus was saying in the book of luke 17 22 he said a time will come you will desire the days of the son of man you will not see it and the bible says he was talking to his disciples he said you will desire one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it and that's the time we are living in today whenever the brown was here i would have just gone to his house cancer and my chin and will just pray for me i would have just gone if i have cancer here without your spirit or the pill of her that pill of eyes here but please unclean spirit has very little way but it's still here he took battle of his life to cut off all those veils of darkness and we could see through a mass ministry to say it's here and he said well anybody could say that anybody could say it's here bro anybody could say here it's here bro bill anybody people say that bro josh oh yes yeah and then all we see is just grammar and logics that's how we see but you ever say he's here he said your name is josh ali your name is dan ali no man can say that right oh you are depressive and you are praying about your uncle insurance please he's putting on a blue tie who could say that he wasn't bothered christ was there but he was using his instrument to show you beyond every shadow of doubt the air can demand not something somebody's praying right there sister you're praying for swine swanson so but that does not heal you you see that only beauty your faith that if this man can know that oh god help us if he can do this then he's really yes amen the wreck on december 24 1965 did not carry him away it only carried with the tool that was beyond measure showing us that is yes yes yes yes yes he said he's here and when god together to what i was saying i wish he was here i wish he was here i wish he was here you see what i'm saying you see where we are we're back again god won a victory and then we went back into the defeat god sent barabra to show you beyond every side of them that christ is here it's not emotion it's not a sensation it's a person just as you are it's god hallelujah amen oh amen god help us it's not a man may god help us to see it amen where you can be right there say let us pray and you can believe god right from there i said i don't want to be laying hands on the people he said because when god hit they'd be thinking like this man that is doing it he said when the world is coming forward they can believe right then it happened in their life and they know that it is their faith that created it in their life it's not a man so if the minister does not show up or your husband does not show up you know god is always there they say i will never leave you not forsake you that is unfairly what i promise that trafficking saint paul can hold your husband amen you could bring a phone call only i'm dying of dying a husband jump out of his office he's running and god gets into his car and he's doing 70 or 25 trying to get to you and then he hit the traffic he can't fly he has to wait for the traffic to clear up and then you are there oh and then you are all angry this man does not love me you know you see that the same devil will be walking on your mind he does not love me i called him four hours ago and then when your husband shows up on the door the first thing you gonna say bro whistle why why why is this why you told me when you marry me say you love me four hours just come to rescue me see the devil we first of all dominate your mind he will never give you time to think on anything on clean spirit they are always ahead of the game look how many of us here this morning everybody won't preach one message you don't like it you don't you don't come to church no more this is unclear they are faithful you can bless them for money to evening they will be in church very early next service day very faithful they don't say amen to anything you preach but they are always in church and the message comes and blast them blast them brah jordan is praying against them all up there suffering is praying against them tsunami is praying against the unclean spirit that's the lord cast them out of my life and the next service they are back again before you open the door they are already here sitting waiting for somebody to anoint now if they are so desperate how much more you these are devils they have an end so they are fighting by all means to wreck to wreck your identity to make sure you don't know you and that is the greatest fight to fight it right it's identity war right and it's manifested in the natural and that's why you see what we call identity crisis that's what's going on spiritually when the lord jesus came when god came down as a man what did the devil tell him the question of the lord jesus christ was if you be what you see that as if being the son of god the evidence is turning stone to bread it's not that's why people have made it today and because you're a song you cast out devil say i pray and they were healed god is with me that's not an evidence that god is with you it could be an evidence that you are being cursed amen but the devil kept telling the lord jesus if thou be the son of god turn stone into a bread don't stone the bread it's not an evidence of being the son of god you see but the devil was keeping what was they were doing he was giving another criteria for you to attain sonship and that criteria is the one many people are taking today i'm the i'm the best singer once i sing everybody following the anointing you see the devil just deceiving you [Music] i'm the best preacher if i don't preach that convention the convention have not started you have been deceived by the devil right now right if you be the son of god turn stone to bread jesus will tell him the the principle he said must have not lived by bread alone because abraham said the holy ghost feed only on the word of god and if you are the son of god you only feed on the word of god it's not johnny stone to bread you see what people have gone into say miracles happening there they get the greatest miracle that can happen to the man is when god changed your soul and gave you a desire for his word [Music] just imagine just imagine the society we are living in today things are getting more confusing the government is confused everybody is confused ministers are confused how will you feel bro steve if you open your bible and peace come to your heart how will you feel they can't that's that's not measurable how if this is if you open your bible and peace come to your heart that's my prayer i always say god whenever i open this book let it speak to my heart because we are getting into tougher time right what gives you peace is it the new car you have no no you can imagine why we have road rage today what gives some people peace is the new car somebody just drive by and scratch the bumper they bring out their their gun and they shoot that person what give you peace is he a wife you can kill because of your wife if what give you peace is tied to fellow love you will keep for it right kabab say feel the love is human love it's jealous but if what gives you peace is the word of god after you've had a quarter with your husband and you open that world and that peace come and then you go back to your husband you sit and say honey devil can't rule this home amen the devil cannot rule this home i am sorry for creating that atmosphere and your husband says say honey i'm i'm sorry also and you hold hands together and caster the evil spirit you must hate it to cast it out well i i i can't apologize to her but when i say the man is the head of the house if i apologize now she'll become the head slowly i can't do that i can't i can't do that i can't do that no no no no no no no no no but the man said the husband is the head of the house that when the husband comes and it's all beat up the wife should come and sit on his lap and and cook him good food that's what brown said that's a quote see sincerity will make you face your reality many times we are arguing about who is right and who is wrong see let me say this to you church this this morning take this to heart no matter what what goes on in your home as married couples or unmarried or whatever take this to your heart don't always deal with who is right and who is wrong right always focus on the middle what went wrong something just went wrong your wife that you feel like she's the sweetest in the planet now you're almost chopping off her head has gone wrong and if the dickies come to your house and finally find out where it came true and say you are right your wife is wrong that does not fix what went wrong right but if they can find out what went wrong i said bro sister the devil just came into this home it doesn't matter what he did to you or what he did to your husband let's cast him out because he can't rule he can't rule me on you if i keep my pride and you keep your pride we have a new king king devil see our pride we install a new king and we don't want that so i'm speaking this morning now there are many homes this morning they just had a new they just had election election was over in their home they just reinstalled the devil and are you sleeping you're facing this way your wife is facing that way because you got a new scenario in the house it's dictating the policies that rule your family this is serious talk church this is what about unclean spirits and god is telling you see like i told you when you reason with your children it may look so simple but you make them to depart from those things you're telling them but when you bully them they don't know why you are saying they shouldn't do it keep telling your daughter i don't want to go with that boy she will still keep going with that boy but if you can sit her down and tell her you know married look at that boy with all those crazy hair look it's going to defy you and you you actually don't argue with how you you reason with her and then you're communicating with her and she see why she shouldn't do it and most of the time we communicate the wrong way we just bullied our children and we become bullied when you're coming everybody's like crosses they're hiding you create hypocrisy in your own home you create actors but when you reach it with them let them do what they want to do because they're going to do it anyway nobody give birth to a christian how many of us give back to your believer raise up your head okay that's what i thought you all give birth to a sinner that's what you give back to how many of us are trying to change that oh pastor daughter is like this are you silly the person will be like that until she meet the god that the pastor met oh the dickens daughter does not serve god and so what about it did why did he met god that's why he's that's why he's doing what he's doing and if his daughter is going to behave now she has to meet the same god our father mate see how your clean spirit walk they walk on both ends now because the point figure out what this dick in the white eyes like this the wife is like that even in the past pastor why do this person do the devil want to wreck the house of god that's his desire wreck it so nobody comes to trust will we come to church we'll serve god we will put we'll put our hands on the wheel god sent us come let us listen together and joshua killed the reason with god and was the story that the light is flowing with making honey and when they went there they were not looking for nothing but milk and honey that's what they were looking for through a child in the land they were not seeing the giant they were looking at the promise right right but all these sort little telescopes they were looking at something else they were seen as in the misery they were sent to to spy the city to see with their eyes those ten men were like ministers and and fathers and mothers they were transpiring to the things of god and bring a good report to their children to their church to their wife to their family and these guys went into the land only joshua and caleb let me put out a sister this morning only joshua and caleb and sisters could come back and say i can live as a sister with my husband i can be humble and sweet and i said no no you can't control me this america can't go through you can't no no no no no bringing bad reports they're looking at the chat in the light he did this he's not going to control me he's not going to control me let's put on the brothers this morning they went to the land they spied a lot and this to to spy joshua and kill him kim said we are able to live holy we are able to be humble we can apologize to our wife we can apologize to the church we can apologize to the dickens you will make mistake but we we can't apologize but abraham said the zeal of this hour is what it's repentance you see he said the devil twisted he's gonna give us something oh let's pray let's let's do brother's prayer meeting and we are saying you know god we are praying oh dude we are spiritual no no no but it is repentance right in all those prayer meetings these people are doing you see arrogance begin to creep in right and people make mistake they can never apologize to his sister they can never apologize to their brother but they can pray heaven hell you are praying hollywood heaven you can't pray the rehab down with that character what your prayer is atmosphere you are just feeling sensation you're not really bringing god down you're not bringing god you just oh lord maybe brian i play the piano very well and you feel some sense you think holy ghost is there you are just actually in an emotion but this man went there bro steve they said we can live their life because abraham lived it amen he apologized to his wife he apologized to his children he apologized to his lawyer he he he was not so proud that he couldn't do it i was watching brad shadlam the other day and he was apologizing to his church yes it doesn't make you little it makes you a christian that's the that's the treasure of the christianity when you can prophecy the zeal of the hour is what the zeal of what repentance to be able to say i am sorry and only a believer we have that right and you can be a believer the devil is telling you something else but look at that word carefully you see people in the scripture who also the devil taught the same story he's telling you you just have to hold to god's word like abraham he believed god and god said you are righteous before then joshua would tell us that abraham worship idols that's what joshua told the book of joshua so probably many of us in here we're watching some idols of pride my way or no way and fashion and all of that before you come out of your house you can spend two hours on the mirror until you come late to the church say sunday school doesn't really even matter i mean this helps what might they got to look beautiful this is a sister it's not a sister thing it's lack of commitment because if god means so much to you you should look beautiful that because that's the nature of you might want to look beautiful but it should not be at the expense of your spiritual life if safara has not spent time looking at that mirror she would have seen that her husband died in the church she may have told the truth because how how did the husband come to church and she was not there when the husband died how did this happen they loved each other when they saw the lord they were together is that right that's what she said they conspired to give the first report but when it was such service you see how the devil walks when it's conspiracy to lie they were together but coming to church husband was ahead she was behind that would have spared her life it sounds funny this morning i'm not trying to make you joke this is serious business somebody just died sapphira was somebody's mother if you don't know she was somebody's sister yeah and then and i also was somebody's brother see when we read the scripture i was telling my mom my wife one day i said when we read the scripture let's slow down and really let it seriously with our life when you read an israelite slave two to twenty three thousand people those people were people's family see it's not hollywood movie it's not sparta this is spatter it's not a war movie this is reality somebody just lost their life because they were not serving god and when you look at what those people did that 25 000 people died you are doing it most every time of the week you're doing them the fact that you are doing them doesn't make them right you cannot nobody in here can christianize sin you cannot see the sin in joshua's life he's seen him receiving his life he's saying not sin in your life and then it's holding it's not and that's how god is calling us in a solemn hour come let us reason together and when you take that invitation and you come to god you will realize that this message is not an intellectual message it's not a school it's just something that god has sent to show you who you are in this world that's it god not assembled abram so that you can open the brahmas no he sent him to show you who you are that's it amen no other person could show us who we are some are telling us on how to get a car and how to be reached and that will be that but here comes a message showing you who you are in the word of god the musicians can come up i told you i'm just going to lay foundation to this we're talking about unclean spirits and god is calling you to receive with him because this is deep not deep means this is deep this is what we relate with every day of our life unclean spirit it's why you look at the message and you listen to a tape you can't even follow the tape you're looking to the table they say something and then you you live there and you go there and you can't even you don't know the end of that tip anymore this is why people have been in the message for 40 years received 30 years they have not been able to listen to the seven seal the only knowledge they have of the servants is what they attract to them and now we are living in an age where we have cds see this is even obsolete now we have chips chips is almost obsolete you have it in your phone you can listen to any message you want to listen to you can open the bible on your phone if you have a smartphone you don't have to be smart the phone just have to be smart [Music] and god has used the devil's own tool to bless us at one time to open the bible and read it you'll be bumped on a stick in england the person that translated the bible the new testament to english will enter in there they break his neck and bond him on the stake for doing what for translating the bible to english for people to read how many of us have bible this morning in our head and you are not brought you can't even read the page from it in a solemn way you are enhanced when you are reading it you think when tinder was translated into english his intention was for you to read it in his no he wanted you to read this thing so that he can have impact in your life because till they are seeing something in this scripture he has seen something in this world something has opened up to him and said if i can get these people to see it he was not trying to show that who the king was the king was living a dirty life he didn't have a male son and then he married his brother's wife this they could not have a man's soul so thin there was not trying to show them who t there is he read the bible and he blessed his life and he took an oath i will make sure this thing gets to the cover man in the streets and look at us where last did you open your bible so of course as we call it the church this morning that's why we remember to dust it that's how we brought it out of where we kept it but somebody gave his life just for you to read it in english somebody had to live a regardless life the angel of god talked about abraham he said you have chosen the harder way it is of your own choosing somebody choose the other way so you can see yourself in what thing they translated here we are we begin to chase things that the devil has put in place to make us not to know who we are how many of us think that is the effort that we put into our job that put base on our table you can wake up tomorrow paradise and already working with your eyes that bleach if that happens will you be worried of running late to work no you won't be worried about that if you wake up tomorrow and you are brain dead we will be worried about paying your mortgage no you will not that would be your least worries but god has given you something trust me listen to this god has given you something it is true you may see me badly and you are reading the bible it's not really it's not really making sense to you you're not really falling in love with it be honest just saying lord make me fall in love with this book that's your prayer request oh i have all night we pray oh lord hold on say let us pray oh god oh lord oh lord you are not praying you are making sound blood call if you're gently god wants communication sister kelly he wants to communicate he said what's your problem you open the bible it's just a book to you you don't want to be a book you don't want the bible to be a book to you you want to open it and you feel that radiance of god's glory coming to us i read you are smiling and there's that smack on your face they look like that is it crazy in your job you're not crazy with what you're crazy about something just struck you and you gotta have a call open up and i said oh coffee this is gonna kill the old world and you go back again walk in that book there's a smoke on your face right person why is he happy because you have had a relationship and this is a book that tells you more about who you are why darkness is in the land people are falling with diseases god is the healing he said yeah but religious spirits condemnations and things we are alive in our life are not blocking the next channel casting out all every unclean spirit and the word heal all manner of diseases how many of you believe that i was talking to you this morning have any of you believe that i was talking to you this morning do you believe if you believe raise up your hand all right you just say so so it means you have to pray in that wilderness if something in your heart is doubting your prayer then that's your prayer request you say prayer request is for intellectual prayer request is reality i am praying for healing for my sister and i'm believing in my heart that it may not happen i'm still in probability relationship with divine healing what do i need to pray for god help my unbelief you are not believing you are saying no you are you are following the procedure in mark 9 jesus 2 before that man he just sent his disciples and the bible said 2 until they went and they came back said we cast our devil we hate the sick we did this and then one man brought his son when whenever i heard about the revival he brought his son you see this this boy the devil is trying to kill him and all the disciples were praying oh lord oh lord the lord the man told the lord jesus he said your disciples could not cast out the devil and you know what he told jesus this man guarded mach 9 they just came from a revival in chapter 8 they cast a devil and they did all those great things in chapter 9. they brought their sick before them they could not cast out the devil now they were confused they said lord why why couldn't we why couldn't we cast it out then he gave them another level he said ye he said oh ye of little faith he said sauce does not come out without prayer and fasting now listen to this we come to about abraham now he says trust god not come out with that word without prayer and what fasting now you know what abraham prayer and fasting but i'm calling puggatory now why did whatever call it purgatory in the beginning about the bran's ministry the angel of god talked about abraham if only you will be sincere nothing can stand for your prayer not even cancer but later on the entire temple abraham in a vision when he was pounding that mount that snake the ancient top of the bread he said you must be more sincere follow me 1947 when he met angela they said you if you are sincere if you are nothing can stand for your prayer but this time but abraham said god told me i am not sincere enough yeah that sister god talk about abraham you are not sincere enough god says enough you know what the brother said he said i am going to forget me i am going to fast and pray because god said i am not sincere enough the disciple could not cast it out because yes about cleanness in there who will be the greatest who will be this who's going to be the next leader who will be jesus said don't worry about that nonsense this is all about with goodness god is the greatest hallelujah now we can we can relax and we can begin not successful where they belong and begin to allow god to take control when we cannot pray god didn't tell you to send your children didn't tell you to save your husband all god told you to do is pray let your requests be known unto god but we want to do it you gotta hey god send us a prophet you gotta take this no no no no pray let your heart deserve in the lord of god don't give up on your children oh i pray for them don't give up on nobody god i have prayed oh god happy this morning this morning we're just talking about righteousness bro steve we use abraham and the mexicans slow down a little now listen to this we're not talking about righteousness but i don't know who the first believer is you know the first believer is sister the first believer was god himself he see god is not telling you to do something that he has not done and listen to this church if you play that song you see god to see your father i just want i want us to know who your father relays because we're following our father we're going to grow into the image of our father before that give me that song as the deer panted for the water broke so i want to say this now listen to this church have clothes i have clothes already oh god boss and for sloth the first believer was god himself and you prayed for something oh god said my husband said my husband it's not gonna be safe two years three years four years five years yeah all this person yeah it's not 100 years old i'll tell you that i don't need to be a prophet the oldest man here a woman is 100 years old the first believer sister expressed one thousand years of faith when god said let there be light brother you know how long it took for the light to come one thousand years god was still waiting you get abroad judge he was running rasheed was ready for one thousand years he was still ready he didn't say oh no i mean let that be let it be flash oh i mean i mean i mean he said let there be light and impatiently with it god expressed one thousand years of patience before what he said he believed it for 1 000 years before it happened oh god help me this morning god help me this morning how many of us have prayed for something that we are waiting for for for 200 years raise up your head how many of us have prayed for something and you are waiting about 200 years raise up your hand do i say a hand up there 200 yen 199 how many of us have prayed for 170 years and you're waiting are you the apple 170 what about 150 i feel like abraham this morning bro jordan and i'm standing before god i said if there'll be 15 soda that's what i feel like we're asking now how many have prayed for 120 years and god didn't answer raise up your hand 120. how about 100. bro sleep did you ask god sorry for 100 years yet have you been praying for something for 100 years god the first believer waited for one thousand years he kept believing he can't believe it he can't believe it but i must say darkness begin to conglomerate he kept believing he was not struggling there was no gimmick and they said i didn't say he tried right loris let him be like the level let him be like there was no emotion to reach if it is god's word it is god's word oh let there be light let there be life let there be light and god begin to believe his word he relaxed on his word he rested on that world and you have prayed for the salvation of your sons you have prayed for the service of your husband you have prayed for your life what do you need to do rest but abraham said in the message why are people toast all about he said the christian faith is solely based upon rest less rise of this god is telling you this morning you may lose your job you may lose that high-paying job but don't lose your identity you may lose your car you may lose your interest but don't lose your identity the devil may have mustering you throw you into the mouth and rub you on the mouth and say you don't need to save god anymore because you are no good yes you will never be good but the blood of jesus christ is the only good thing that happened to you if the first believer has to wait for one thousand years how long have you waited have you been ashamed of yourself this morning that you complained god did not do this and you've never waited you've not waited up to 10 yes 20 30 whatever your desire is this morning let's all talk to the lord remember trust better brave how to make that wrong right before he said that prayer for that man he answered hang on let me go and make this wrong right i just lied and i made my wife lie i just did something that i want not to do i have allowed the wrong influence for me let me make that right and when he made it right the devil knew he got his match casting out all unclean spirits and healing all manner of diseases we just heard of the name of a sister they had coveted said naomi brought their request what is kovi this is one of the devils but when you have settled yourself and you know you have made your rights wrong before the lord the person then you can come boldly before god god didn't tell you to heal anybody but i said pray talk to me [Music] oh sing it from your heart you're not in melody just singing from your eyes singing as

heart and make you restless telling you every now and then you're not a believer and you're beginning to believe the love of the devil you have no time to read your bible you have no time to pray because the devil just keeps feeding you this mess he just keeps feeding you this trash you have no time to ever listen your tapes it's your phone now you have no time because the devil just keeps

lord to see if our god could wait for a thousand years to to see his what come to pass how much more we are to wait how much more we have to wait on that world keep believing and we could keep calling everything that's against the world as though they are not casting down every imagination and every strong thought of unclean spirit that try to insult themselves above the knowledge of god in our lives grant him blessed master oh gracious father may your children see who they are may they see lord god you are yellow to carry out your promises in their life it's not emotional it's not
