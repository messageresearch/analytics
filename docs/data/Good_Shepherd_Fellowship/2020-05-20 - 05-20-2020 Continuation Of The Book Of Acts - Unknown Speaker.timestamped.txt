[17:34] Lord God bless you sister now me tonight
[17:38] huh
[17:39] we want to we want to just look at
[17:41] something and but before we do that and
[17:44] a couple of testimonials here and once
[17:49] again we pray for that gentleman David
[17:54] and then Monday morning we got a call
[17:59] that he went to be with the Lord so our
[18:04] prayers will be with the wife and the
[18:07] children and but you know is it's just
[18:12] some of those things there phase part of
[18:16] life you know we live in two died in and
[18:22] what matter is our home beyond this life
[18:28] that's that's what matter in all of this
[18:32] so we pray for the wife and the children
[18:34] that the grace of God will I know sister
[18:38] Cosima why they been giving their
[18:40] support to the lady so and and then just
[18:45] at a time where the devil thought he was
[18:48] going to you know once again discourage
[18:55] us spit in our face like I was saying I
[19:00] have another testimonial year from from
[19:03] sister bureau our sister she been with
[19:08] us for a while and she had the
[19:13] opportunity to do the work of a nanny
[19:16] she goes you know she helped different
[19:19] families with their children so after
[19:22] she came back and she was working with
[19:26] her family and then they found another
[19:29] family for her to go and help him and
[19:31] this time
[19:32] this family that she's working with the
[19:36] from Somalian Muslim family and and two
[19:43] of the young kids you know they're in
[19:47] the health condition I think the little
[19:49] one that she told me in had to be fed
[19:52] through feeding tube and and I think the
[19:55] next try after also is having a
[19:58] disability so I mean when she when she
[20:02] went into the home normally she stays in
[20:04] the home with the family and you know
[20:07] and she helped the kids and you know do
[20:10] some other things in the house so she
[20:13] said she actually started praying and
[20:17] asking the Lord you know why he sent her
[20:20] here I know every time she have a new
[20:23] you know assignment to do she always
[20:26] talked with talked to me about it you
[20:29] know she was playing everything give us
[20:31] the contact so we can be able to pick
[20:33] her up for church you know and we will
[20:35] check on her to find out how everything
[20:38] is going and for some reason I mean the
[20:44] grace of God has been with her with
[20:46] their family and in so much that she she
[20:52] said I mean the the people and and the
[20:57] children I mean they're just so much in
[21:00] love with Hardin and the children mother
[21:02] kept telling her there is something
[21:05] special about you you know and they get
[21:09] you know kept saying that to her but
[21:11] last Monday there was there was a
[21:16] situation and this child has a nurse
[21:20] that comes to the house you know to come
[21:23] and do all the cleaning of the tube and
[21:25] putting the tube in and you know setting
[21:27] everything right you know they're
[21:29] supposed to be done by a medical
[21:31] professional
[21:32] so this day the the nurse came and and
[21:38] the mother you know has gone out so it
[21:41] was only the nurse and sister beer to
[21:43] the house but the nurse was you know
[21:45] doing the tube in every
[21:46] the testing the child you know doing all
[21:49] the vital signs and different things
[21:51] that she would do as a nurse so right in
[21:55] that moment since tobira says she heard
[21:57] the north that the nurse stream you know
[22:00] she she streaming you know I mean in in
[22:03] a kind of scary sound and and she ran
[22:08] there to find out what was happening but
[22:10] apparently it looks like the child was
[22:12] losing its life in the hand of the nurse
[22:15] and the nurse was so afraid I mean she
[22:18] was crying in you know streaming and and
[22:21] our sister told her that don't cry the
[22:25] child is not going to die she says
[22:28] that's why I'm here you know and and the
[22:33] nurse was just shaking all over I mean
[22:35] she told me in his testimony I think a
[22:38] few days ago my goodness and I was just
[22:41] so I was just so in and she said right
[22:43] there right before the end I mean the
[22:45] child was was I mean color was changing
[22:49] I mean life was growing out of the child
[22:52] and the nurse was just there
[22:54] you know streaming and so afraid shaking
[22:57] you know I mean all her medical
[23:00] experience have gone through the window
[23:02] she didn't know what to do she was
[23:03] saying the child is dead and and and
[23:07] sister Bureau just to right there
[23:09] lay her hands upon the child pray for
[23:12] the child and the child revived back you
[23:18] know and the child revived back and she
[23:21] told me she says and the child went from
[23:24] their moment without the tube or the
[23:27] connection you know all the medical
[23:29] connection that was on the child she
[23:31] went with with our and I mean the nurse
[23:34] surprisingly also because you know
[23:37] that's a Muslim family the nurse also is
[23:41] a Muslim girl you know and I mean she
[23:45] was just standing there and asking the
[23:47] sister what watch was she dead you know
[23:49] and all of that but I just thought that
[23:53] that was tremendous testimony you know
[23:57] praise the Lord
[23:58] so when when the devil thing is
[24:00] coming to spit in our face God is still
[24:02] moving a many God is doing things in the
[24:05] life of his people praise the Lord
[24:07] amen so I was kind of for thinking on
[24:11] what to speak about I first prepared to
[24:14] talk tonight I wanted to brag on Jesus a
[24:16] little bit and so I was I was I was you
[24:21] know thinking about the errand and my
[24:23] mind was just going in between a few
[24:26] different tarts and like we spoke about
[24:29] you know apostolic time before us so
[24:33] tonight we will we would just talk a
[24:36] little bit from the book of Acts and
[24:38] then while I was home this afternoon
[24:43] sometime around I think around the
[24:46] morning a brother called me also you
[24:48] know and and I mean he we talked on the
[24:52] phone and he kind of for testified you
[24:55] know she has some things would mean in
[24:57] you know what the Lord I placed on his
[25:00] heart to do and I thought about this
[25:03] after we got off the phone you know I
[25:06] just stood up right there you know I was
[25:09] doing some work I just stood up I said
[25:11] Lord you know what a good girl you are
[25:14] you know brother Branham talks about
[25:18] standing at your post of duty and many
[25:22] times the way we have honest to that
[25:25] over the years is there either you are a
[25:28] song leader or you are a musician or you
[25:32] are a deacon or you are one on an
[25:35] officer or you have a position but but I
[25:39] think as a believer our post of duty is
[25:43] to stand with the word when we are
[25:47] standing with the world we are at our
[25:49] post of duty
[25:50] so whether in church or out of church
[25:53] when we are making decision on the base
[25:56] of the word you are standing at your
[25:58] post of duty and remember better Branham
[26:01] says that's the only place that God can
[26:02] bless you amen
[26:04] so if we only gave the post of duty to
[26:07] people that have offices in a church
[26:09] then God will not bless the rest of the
[26:11] congregation you know so whether in
[26:13] church
[26:14] or out of church our post of duty is to
[26:17] stand with the Word of God
[26:20] that's the believer post of duty because
[26:22] that is the I mean the believer position
[26:26] in Christ to stand with the Word of God
[26:28] so and I just and any reason why I
[26:32] thought about that is because you know
[26:35] when a man or a woman make a decision or
[26:38] make a choice based on the Word of God
[26:43] you know you just make a choice I'm
[26:46] going to do this you know even though I
[26:50] mean it's beyond your reasonable you say
[26:53] I'm going to do this because the Word of
[26:56] God says I must do it you know you have
[27:00] just given God an opportunity you know
[27:03] this almost like Shadrach Meshach and
[27:05] Abednego he says okay even if he will
[27:08] not deliver us you know even if we know
[27:12] our God can deliver us but if he choose
[27:15] not all this time we are not going to
[27:19] buy them I mean you gave God the
[27:21] opportunity you have taken yourself off
[27:24] the scene and you have given God the
[27:26] opportunity to step on the scene and and
[27:29] and defend his name and defend his word
[27:34] praise the Lord
[27:35] so we just thank the law so let's take
[27:38] our our posts of duty and as we will
[27:42] read the scripture 290 amen as Chapter
[27:44] one asked chapter one oh yeah thank you
[27:52] for a scared there's a habit
[27:57] amen praise the Lord
[27:59] as chapter one that just reverse one now
[28:04] based based on these two testimonies I
[28:06] want I want to I want to speak on this
[28:09] subject tonight I'm just introducing
[28:11] this in and we pray that the grace of
[28:13] God would be able to continue with us
[28:15] you
[28:16] the former treating have I made all two
[28:21] fellows of all that Jesus began both to
[28:26] do
[28:27] and teach until the day in which he was
[28:33] taken up after death he true the whole
[28:39] Eagles have given command on to the
[28:43] apostle's whom he have chosen
[28:46] let's pray together Heavenly Father dear
[28:49] Lord we talking about apostolic time
[28:54] among us love father we want to go back
[28:58] to the wrecker
[28:59] Oh God where you started to move ammonia
[29:03] postures father net-net
[29:06] at a time word you are in a fleshly form
[29:09] but moving through the hearts of the
[29:12] believers so God we just prayed in acts
[29:15] the Lord you were coming and bless your
[29:18] word tonight father Oh bless your people
[29:21] in your homes of garden and Lord Jesus
[29:24] we want to thank you Father Lord Oh God
[29:27] for standing with our sister Lord Jesus
[29:29] and back in your word our poor father
[29:32] Lord God we just pray that you would
[29:35] glorify yourself Lord Jesus
[29:37] oh god father Lord may she be a witness
[29:41] in that home of father Lord Oh God if
[29:44] there's a purpose of salvation or we
[29:47] know that purpose will never be defeated
[29:49] Lord so we just prayed committing those
[29:52] little children in your hands or father
[29:53] we asked a Lord God you will just move

[30:07] bride of Jesus Christ
[30:08] Oh God around the world your people that
[30:11] are standing for your name's sake in
[30:13] this hour we just ask the Lord you bless
[30:15] the service now Lord bless your word as
[30:17] we bring a fine father tonight come and
[30:20] break the world God speak to our hassle
[30:22] father may something be said that we
[30:24] draw us closer to you we love you and we
[30:28] appreciate you in Jesus name we pray
[30:30] amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you
[30:34] can have your seat I read this quote
[30:37] from s position
[30:40] and I will find my my subject from there
[30:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ I just
[30:52] want to read this line but Branham says
[30:54] now remember this Christ in the truth
[30:59] church is a continuation of the book of
[31:05] Acts amen
[31:07] now if apostolic time is a Manas then I
[31:12] believe we are in a continuation of the
[31:16] book of Acts
[31:17] I was looking a lot of statement abroad
[31:20] branimir on dish and he compared it to
[31:24] writing another book of Acts and that
[31:30] their statement and not a book of adds
[31:34] you know I thought about it and I says
[31:37] well I know brother Brandon really never
[31:40] meant you know writing a separate book
[31:43] of ads but it is just the continuation
[31:45] of the book of ads and and and this is
[31:49] where it comes out beautiful to support
[31:51] that statement of brother Branham when
[31:55] Luke that wrote the book of ads when he
[31:59] wrote this
[32:00] this treaty toe-to-toe Phillips where he
[32:06] made the statement about the formal
[32:09] treaty now their former treaty that he
[32:12] was referring to is the book of look
[32:16] it's a book of look so in one sense Luke
[32:23] was telling to you fellas I give you a
[32:26] report of what Jesus did when he was
[32:29] alive this is a continuation of their
[32:33] report so it's a continuation of the
[32:38] book of odds just like where Branham
[32:41] saying you know and the beautiful thing
[32:44] year is there let's look in Luke chapter
[32:49] 1 verse 3
[32:53] let's look in Luke chapter 1 verse 3
[33:10] reading from one for as much as many
[33:13] have taken in hand to set forth in order
[33:17] a declaration of those things which are
[33:20] most surely believed among us even as
[33:25] they delivered them unto us which from
[33:29] the beginning were eyewitnesses and
[33:32] ministers of the word it seems good to
[33:36] me also having had perfect understanding
[33:40] of all things from the very first to
[33:45] write unto thee in order most excellent
[33:49] to your Phillips now this even in this
[33:53] introduction Luke put out that I'm not a
[33:58] disciples
[33:59] I was net and eyewitness of many of
[34:04] these things because he was net counted
[34:10] among the twelve no he was not counted
[34:15] among the twelve now that's what would
[34:17] make the book of us beautiful because
[34:20] even just just imagine right from the
[34:22] beginning of the book of ad God use a
[34:26] man that was not the disciple he was not
[34:29] a minister Luke says right here in his
[34:33] book he well he was not a minister of
[34:34] the word so it just showed that the book
[34:40] of Acts is starting with common people
[34:43] it's going to speak about common people
[34:47] people that God will use in India in
[34:50] India profession God will use as a
[34:53] housewife and as a mechanic as a
[34:57] physician you know and in different
[34:59] people how the Spirit of God will just
[35:02] move not only the twelve that was with
[35:04] Jesus not only the 120 that was in the
[35:08] upper room but God is now pouring out
[35:11] his spirit just like he prophesied but
[35:15] joy of the Prophet and he's going to use
[35:17] common people
[35:21] pray so long so look here is is writing
[35:25] this account to TIA Phyllis now for some
[35:28] reason my mind I just got stuck on there
[35:31] this afternoon and I started reading
[35:33] different accounts to find out who these
[35:35] two fellows was that he was that he was
[35:37] sending this message to praise the Lord
[35:39] and but with this address that look give
[35:46] us here in Luke in his episode where he
[35:50] says here verse three it seems good to
[35:55] me also having having her perfect
[35:59] understanding of all things from the
[36:03] very first to write unto thee in order
[36:07] most excellent Theophilus I point out
[36:11] here that your Philips was he was a man
[36:16] of high office let me say that way he
[36:21] was either a Roman general you know and
[36:26] this also shows that beside the twelve
[36:30] disciples that was walking with Jesus
[36:33] there were other people that the gospel
[36:35] affected there were other people like
[36:38] Jairus we know that he was a secret
[36:41] disciple like Nicodemus even though he
[36:45] was in the sahih Drance council but
[36:47] there was something about the Ministry
[36:49] of Jesus that he testified
[36:52] no man can do this work and said God be
[36:55] with him so beside the twelve disciples
[37:00] that Jesus was what working with the
[37:03] Bible even told told us about a Joseph
[37:08] i'ma tell them the one who gave his he
[37:11] stone for Jesus to be burying now we
[37:14] realize that at a particular point that
[37:17] the scripture is starting to bring these
[37:19] people are to show them the Ministry of
[37:23] Jesus was having effect in the life of
[37:28] people that were secretly believing
[37:33] whether they were Roman soldiers whether
[37:36] they were innocent hindrance Council you
[37:38] know one better Branham talks about
[37:39] Jairus he talks that I mean Jairus was
[37:42] trying to keep his repetition he tell us
[37:45] about Zacchaeus the business man and he
[37:50] talks about these different characters
[37:51] in the Bible so we realized that I mean
[37:55] it was not just the twelve disciples
[37:57] that was with Jesus it was not just they
[38:01] in their wives and their children there
[38:03] were other people that the gospel of
[38:06] Jesus Christ was affecting their life
[38:10] praise the Lord
[38:11] now yeah Luke comes in and it's so
[38:16] please the Lord God was so pleased with
[38:19] Luke report inspire him in such a way
[38:24] and you will realize that I mean look
[38:27] account that he gave he says I gather
[38:32] these things from eyewitnesses and I
[38:35] mean he did it almost like what's the
[38:40] brother that wrote that book Owen you
[38:44] know but yeah Owen juggling the same way
[38:47] he writes he he take the story bit and
[38:50] pieces and he puts it together and it
[38:53] becomes more clearer because he's taking
[38:55] it from eyewitnesses this person said oh
[38:58] okay I remember you know Peter told me
[39:02] in this and Jim is the same thing that
[39:04] James about Peter left this information
[39:06] out so I'm going to bring James
[39:08] information that's what I mean now the
[39:11] story is more clear up that's why he
[39:13] means when he says here I have perfect
[39:15] understanding because he was going
[39:17] around gathering information and dog
[39:20] telling it together to make the picture
[39:22] more clearer God using common people he
[39:31] was not he was not part of the twelve
[39:33] disciples you don't have to be a
[39:35] minister God can bless you in your
[39:41] profession and he can bless the ability
[39:44] you have he can be able to bless
[39:47] just that little China of gift that he
[39:49] gave you whatever that you love to do
[39:53] and you can be happy to do it God can
[39:55] bless that and use it for his purpose
[40:00] what an introduction you think about the
[40:03] book of Acts and you think about the
[40:05] Apostle you think about the Holy Ghost
[40:07] it's so easy for you to jump over as
[40:10] chapter 1 and stand and talk about the
[40:13] days of Pentecost and talked about the
[40:15] Holy Ghost coming but let's go back to
[40:16] the introduction the introduction of the
[40:20] book the man that wrote the book and the
[40:23] one that he was addressing the book tour
[40:29] praise the Lord if we will if we will be
[40:34] looking forward to the continuation of
[40:37] the book of Acts I want to tell you this
[40:40] continuation is not God using special
[40:43] people it's God using common people the
[40:47] common people that make themselves
[40:49] available for God to use if you make
[40:52] yourself available God will use you he
[40:55] will use you in your own situation he
[40:58] will use you to overcome your own
[41:00] weakness he will use you to help
[41:02] somebody he will use you in any way that
[41:05] he want to use you God will use you
[41:09] that's what we are looking at here this
[41:11] is the continuation of the book of art
[41:13] because the thing about it there is that
[41:16] we when we talk about a book of ask our
[41:19] mind goes to the miracle our mind goes
[41:22] to the Holy Ghost coming down there and
[41:25] in everybody speaking in tongues our
[41:27] mind goldstone that the lame man being
[41:29] walk and I mean raise up and get a
[41:33] beautiful for him to walk and and all of
[41:35] that we just look at those special
[41:37] events in a book of us but before those
[41:41] events it look never wrote this this
[41:44] episode we will not have no account if
[41:50] he did not have the burden to go down to
[41:54] Peter house and sit down with him and
[41:56] said tell me tell me that
[41:58] Testament I love to hear those things
[41:59] and
[42:00] you go down to John house and he said
[42:02] tell me and I said tell him his story he
[42:04] goes home it's on his mind
[42:06] he takes his book he starts to write oh
[42:08] my goodness
[42:09] CEO Phyllis you were enjoy this one I
[42:11] Peter just told me something again I
[42:13] love what he told me oh my goodness I'm
[42:16] going to compile all of those things and
[42:18] send him to you God using common people
[42:23] that make themselves available
[42:28] that's the continuation of the book of
[42:31] Acts it never stopped in the Apostles it
[42:35] never stopped in every farmer he never
[42:38] stops in the man that God has raised up
[42:40] through the ages it never stopped in
[42:43] brother branham ministry God is still
[42:45] using common people that would dedicate
[42:48] himself they will make themselves a
[42:52] channel for God to use I mean god bless
[42:59] some people they know how to put details
[43:02] together
[43:03] I mean I'm for me I just hit the
[43:08] highlights you asked me one thing I hit
[43:11] the highlights I get out of it some
[43:13] people that goes to the details I mean
[43:15] that's the way that God used people and
[43:18] as the go to those detail is easy for
[43:21] other people to get the full picture of
[43:24] what happened that's why you were
[43:28] realized in the gospel you go to Matthew
[43:31] Gospel he hits some highlights why by
[43:35] calling he was a tax collector he was a
[43:41] tax collector he just hit he just hit
[43:44] highlights but you know a physician
[43:49] brothers can they love details
[43:52] you go to the doctor office and then you
[43:56] actually actually what happened to you
[43:58] he says I have a headache okay you have
[44:00] a headache when there is started you
[44:05] know how many times I mean do you have
[44:08] this all the time he keeps asking you
[44:11] questions he keeps
[44:12] asking you because he wanted he want to
[44:14] get down to the point and that's the
[44:19] kind of a person that look was because
[44:22] he's a physician
[44:23] oh praise the Lord oh man my goodness my
[44:31] goodness how can we have the
[44:36] continuation of the book of us if we
[44:38] just keep it only in the preachers and
[44:40] all the preachers are fighting against
[44:42] one another
[44:44] there must be common people
[44:48] there must be common people there were
[44:51] people the Bible even talks about the
[44:55] women that were around Jesus ministry
[44:58] let me tell you those women they never
[45:00] just left their husbands no they were
[45:03] supported by their husbands in in all
[45:07] that they were doing for the ministry
[45:11] when the scripture brings them out and
[45:14] talks about Solomon it talks about me
[45:16] remodeling talks about all of these
[45:18] different women it's not because the
[45:20] belief that the message of Jesus or
[45:22] believe the Ministry of Jesus oh the
[45:25] judge decided to live single I know they
[45:27] had children they have husband they have
[45:30] house duty but when it came to a place
[45:32] where the top they could be effective in
[45:35] a ministry of Jesus they stepped out to
[45:37] the plate if it was to make bread if it
[45:40] was to make a juice if it was so I mean
[45:45] make a pillow for him to rest his head
[45:48] on where the table they were needed in a
[45:50] ministry they stepped out to the plate
[45:52] but they had their normal life they
[45:55] believed in his ministry they knew that
[45:57] he was the Messiah after what mirror
[46:01] modeling experience being seven devil
[46:03] being cast out of her you know all the
[46:06] stubborn spirit and fighting and
[46:07] everything that she was doing being cut
[46:09] a humble heart
[46:11] she loved the Lord Jesus but if she must
[46:14] follow Jesus she must also be respectful
[46:18] to her husband they never just left
[46:20] their family life and just ran behind
[46:23] Jesus what would they have done
[46:24] when he was crucified what would they
[46:27] have done when he had sent it up God
[46:35] using common people praise the Lord amen
[46:50] so we look at Luke a little bit look at
[46:54] this brother Luke a little bit collusion
[47:00] chapter four let's let's let just get a
[47:04] few record on him here Paul talks about
[47:11] this man the Bible says he was a
[47:13] physician amen and you know it's right
[47:17] here you know it put us to the place
[47:20] where we we want to use this and
[47:22] encourage our young people you know
[47:24] don't I mean don't seek the Holy Ghost
[47:26] and and and and don't do well in school
[47:29] the Holy Ghost will help you to do well
[47:30] because the Holy Ghost supposed to
[47:32] remind you praise the Lord so you can't
[47:36] tell me you're looking for the Holy
[47:37] Ghost and you feeling in your test
[47:39] you're looking for the wrong spirit
[47:41] because the Holy Ghost supposed to
[47:43] remind you he's supposed to bring back
[47:46] to your mind those things that you have
[47:48] been taught God show it over and over
[47:54] through the scripture that he used come
[47:57] on people
[47:58] marty was a tax collector he was very
[48:01] good to be in the body when Jesus told
[48:09] him come and follow me it did not it did
[48:12] not troll his tax collecting skills out
[48:14] of the window it did not roll his career
[48:17] out of the window see the reason why God
[48:22] would bless us in in the things that we
[48:25] do and give you better career is because
[48:28] God want you to go into the into the
[48:30] work market because there's some of his
[48:32] children in that place and the only way
[48:34] he can get them is to get somebody
[48:37] working in the same of
[48:38] is somebody working in the same company
[48:40] and then he can use you as a channel to
[48:43] be able to fish his children out if God
[48:49] makes every one of us to be just I mean
[48:53] all his children just doing one thing
[48:57] nobody will be safe out there
[49:01] he will have to take a supernatural move
[49:03] of God to get people from from from in
[49:07] the car in industry to get kept in touch
[49:10] to be said it will have to take but God
[49:12] will receive a man that has the ability
[49:16] to do certain things because they are
[49:18] more of his children in their line of
[49:20] work and he can use that man or that
[49:23] woman as a testimony that's the reason
[49:25] why wherever we find ourself as we go
[49:28] down into this book I mean Luke talks
[49:32] about it wherever we find ourselves we
[49:35] want to be a witness of Jesus Christ
[49:40] because birdbrain says that's what
[49:43] internal life is living for others
[49:47] living for others so that life can flow
[49:51] through us and influence others praise
[49:55] the Lord Amen that's what we are net I
[50:00] mean we are not ashamed to testify you
[50:04] know to tell people when people get
[50:08] attracted to your weight of light and
[50:10] people get attracted to I mean and since
[50:13] there's just something about you I mean
[50:16] I just I just I just appreciate the way
[50:18] you do things you know we found an
[50:21] opportunity to tell them that we are
[50:25] saved by grace to tell them that once I
[50:28] was a sinner this this this nice person
[50:31] you've seen how I was not always nice
[50:34] but God grace get hold of me
[50:37] amen you have to find a way to tell
[50:41] because sometimes we just love to stock
[50:43] in the praises oh you are a nice you are
[50:46] a nice guy and and then pretty soon you
[50:48] stick your head out I mean and it equate
[50:50] to put a proud spirit
[50:52] on you and the devil knows how to do
[50:54] that and you and he would just misplaced
[50:57] I think he said it to be I mean a pure
[51:02] love of God that is flowing through you
[51:05] he gets right in there and start to
[51:07] pervert it to be lost and then it turned
[51:09] to all sorts of things when someone
[51:13] starts to appreciate the grace of God in
[51:15] you and you just point them to the
[51:17] saving knowledge of Jesus Christ it gets
[51:21] their attention if this person used to
[51:24] be or if they were now like this and the
[51:26] grace of God helped them to be like this
[51:28] then I think I want that same grace you
[51:32] know but sometimes we just want to take
[51:34] all the praises and we don't give
[51:36] nothing to God oh you are a smart guy
[51:39] yeah you know what I went to this school
[51:41] I get this degree you know when and and
[51:44] you just leave Christ out of the picture
[51:46] you will never be a witness that way
[51:48] amen that's the beginning of the book of
[51:52] Acts praise the Lord
[51:54] Paul year speaking in a book of
[51:57] collusion verse chapter four verse 14 he
[52:01] talks about Luke Luke table of physician
[52:04] and you know he brings our look here and
[52:09] and there is there is another chapter
[52:11] somewhere where Paul he spoke about Luke
[52:17] I think there is 2nd Corinthians chapter
[52:20] 8 let's look at that I have few of them
[52:25] reading down here so I hope I'm giving
[52:28] you the right one now yeah 2nd
[52:34] Corinthians chapter 8 verse 18 listen to
[52:38] what what what Paul said about Luke II
[52:41] am he says and we have sent with him the
[52:46] brother whose praise is is in the gospel
[52:52] throughout all the churches whose praise
[52:59] is in the gospel which means look
[53:02] account of the gospel
[53:04] it brought out some things that make the
[53:09] story of Jesus in his disciple more
[53:12] clearly so all the churches enjoy just
[53:18] like when people takes brother always
[53:20] book you know and and they listen to
[53:23] those little story the way he don't tell
[53:25] the stories together and he makes the
[53:28] picture clearer now that was the same
[53:30] way Luke account was I mean all the
[53:36] churches talks about this guy oh my
[53:38] goodness and then and and and even some
[53:41] people mistake him to be a disciples
[53:43] you're told that he was one of the
[53:45] twelve and many Christians today mistake
[53:50] Luke to be a disciple they thought that
[53:53] he was one of the twelve he was not
[53:56] number with the twelve but he went
[54:01] around and gather all of these testimony
[54:03] had a burden on a high just to do
[54:05] something for the Lord and he had this
[54:14] testimony in him on the brothers whose
[54:18] praise is in the gospel throughout all
[54:22] the churches they talk about Luke
[54:25] account
[54:26] praise the Lord amen
[54:30] Peter and all of these disciples they
[54:34] had the pressure of the responsibility
[54:36] after Jesus has left and they were all
[54:41] afraid waiting there in the upper room
[54:43] now if God did not give us a male like
[54:46] look we will not even have an account of
[54:51] what happened on the day of Pentecost if
[54:55] God did not give us a male like look we
[55:02] will not even know what were what the
[55:04] first church was who have no idea
[55:19] and years said he rides to this man
[55:21] chill Phyllis most excellent to you
[55:25] Phyllis he gave him the respect to
[55:29] realize that T Oh Phyllis
[55:31] no matter what his position was there
[55:34] was something about the gospel of Jesus
[55:37] cried I was trailing him every time Luke
[55:39] was sent a report to him man I really
[55:42] enjoyed that testimony last night look
[55:44] oh my goodness I went to work you know I
[55:46] was I was there there and they were
[55:49] talking something about Caesar and they
[55:50] were talking about I mean uh Rome has
[55:53] conquered the world but I mean just
[55:55] raising a little gear back to life my
[55:57] goodness I mean that thing was just on
[56:00] my mind God using common people using
[56:04] Luke testimony if he was a physician he
[56:09] went to medical school that day and what
[56:12] he was doing was taking the gospel of
[56:15] Jesus among his professors taking a
[56:18] gospel of Jesus and more the people that
[56:20] he's caught to associate with we're
[56:24] venom said son I made to go out he said
[56:27] god bless him he said just like Paul
[56:29] Paul was a learned man and God bless him
[56:31] Paul could stand before anybody he had
[56:35] the education tool to put his words
[56:37] together I mean he would stand before
[56:40] Caesar and he would even talk and and I
[56:43] mean those Roman gods their hat would be
[56:45] so moved
[56:46] won't tore him apart shut up you almost
[56:48] destroyed me to be a Christian because
[56:53] that was the way he was caught Peter was
[56:58] a fisherman so God caught him to be able
[57:01] to go in the area you know and that's
[57:04] the way he made every one of us we are
[57:06] very different that's the reason why you
[57:08] gave God too much of work when you try
[57:11] to be like somebody because he can use
[57:14] you that way he have to bring you back
[57:16] for you to be yourself
[57:17] and then use you in a way that he want
[57:21] to use you the continuation of the book
[57:25] of Acts
[57:27] he says remember Christ in the truth
[57:32] church is the continuation of the book
[57:36] of Acts Christ in common people if we
[57:44] just start appreciating what God is
[57:47] doing in our life instead of looking at
[57:50] file and and looking at other people and
[57:52] comparing just bring it back to yourself
[57:55] see how much the grace of God has helped
[57:57] you praise the Lord
[58:05] having a Bible study with brother Brad
[58:09] laughs nodding and I mean we just had
[58:11] such a good time there you know in the
[58:14] church in and then I mean at the end he
[58:16] says he says oh I feel so sad that you
[58:20] have to drive all all the way back in
[58:23] you know less less I mean let's move
[58:25] there the Bible said it somewhere else I
[58:27] mean close to that side I said no I want
[58:30] the Word of God to be in this church why
[58:32] it is staying in rooms while the rubbles
[58:35] are all over let keep preaching the word
[58:37] here it might help these guys to go
[58:39] faster amen
[58:45] we have such a good time and and you
[58:50] know trusting the grace of God and just
[58:53] working on something and and I believe
[58:56] that God grace came down last night and
[58:58] and he got it praise the Lord you know
[59:02] he got it you know and and we there with
[59:05] that scripture where Peter said you know
[59:07] baptism show us a good conscience
[59:09] towards God you know and I was telling
[59:12] him at that's that's where God begins
[59:13] with with us if you don't have a good
[59:17] conscience to what God you can never
[59:18] live right if you don't have a good
[59:20] conscience toward God you will never
[59:21] appreciate what God is doing for you if
[59:24] you're conscious to us God is just
[59:26] church membership just to be identified
[59:28] with a church I don't know how you
[59:30] survive it because the first thing that
[59:35] God starts with his children like any
[59:38] parent when
[59:40] that child is born because of the nine
[59:44] months experience the father being
[59:47] around the mother you know a caring for
[59:49] the child why to try to stay in a warm
[59:52] they try in some ways some mysterious
[59:55] way that little life is conscious of the
[59:59] beam that is around and when the child
[1:00:02] is born she she or he stop becoming
[1:00:05] conscious to the voices that's the
[1:00:07] reason why even Dahl is a month old
[1:00:10] child when it gets in the hands of a
[1:00:12] stranger is able to differentiate a
[1:00:14] stranger from the parent the first thing
[1:00:19] it becomes conscious that this field
[1:00:22] likes my mama there's a feeling there's
[1:00:26] an atmosphere that is around and that is
[1:00:28] the first thing that God brings to his
[1:00:30] children a good cultures that God is God
[1:00:34] and he's a holy God that's the thing
[1:00:39] that brings the fear of God that gift of
[1:00:41] wisdom to do the right thing praise the
[1:00:50] Lord amen what I'm just I'm just having
[1:00:57] a good time here amen
[1:00:59] I mean I'm having a good time here
[1:01:02] because I mean I just I just I just got
[1:01:06] captured in the top I mean the whole
[1:01:08] afternoon I was just staring ass chapter
[1:01:11] one the very first verse that's where my
[1:01:13] mind was I was just I was just reading
[1:01:15] history on the verse just to see the
[1:01:18] different things
[1:01:19] you know and in the different historical
[1:01:22] account out there about the life of Luke
[1:01:33] praise the Lord
[1:01:34] verbatim said is the message talking
[1:01:37] 1963 he said and so does the bride and
[1:01:42] Christ becomes one the ministry of the
[1:01:46] bride and the ministry of christ is the
[1:01:51] scene now see what what Luke said let's
[1:01:56] go back to Acts chapter one he said a
[1:02:09] former treaty the former treaty have
[1:02:13] army and their former tree like I said
[1:02:19] is the Gospel of Luke all cheerfulness
[1:02:22] of all that Jesus began both to do and
[1:02:27] teach that was what was in the first
[1:02:31] treaty in the first account
[1:02:34] he said all to your fellow watcher now
[1:02:36] you know everything that I sent to you
[1:02:38] about Jesus life he live did not ending
[1:02:43] his life denied and because you have to
[1:02:46] realize the Adam till Phyllis is the one
[1:02:49] I mean Luke is the one that recorded
[1:02:52] right here Jesus ascension he's the one
[1:02:57] that recorded the angel said to Jesus at
[1:03:01] the same way you see me going I will
[1:03:03] come back so he's telling he's selling
[1:03:09] that to Philips the account that I sent
[1:03:12] to you it does not finish it does not

[1:03:35] as I said who have believed our report
[1:03:37] the arm of the Lord is revealed unto
[1:03:41] them and that was what was happening to
[1:03:43] look because he
[1:03:45] leave the report of the eyewitnesses God
[1:03:47] was making a more real and clearer to
[1:03:51] him praise the Lord because he believed
[1:03:55] the the the testimony of those witnesses
[1:04:02] God was just lowering his in I mean his
[1:04:08] mind I mean I mean the picture become
[1:04:11] more clearer he said I got a perfect
[1:04:13] understanding from everything that I've
[1:04:17] gathered it's getting better to your
[1:04:23] fellows

[1:04:49] burial and the resurrection praise the
[1:04:54] Lord the gospel stop with the death the

[1:06:47] whom verse 3 also he showed himself
[1:06:51] alive after his passion by many
[1:06:56] infallible proofs
[1:07:00] Lucas bringing out more storage he
[1:07:04] showed himself after his passion after
[1:07:07] his suffering after the cross after the
[1:07:11] whipping after everything that he went
[1:07:13] through he show himself through
[1:07:17] infallible proofs been seen of them
[1:07:21] forty days and speaking of the things
[1:07:27] pertaining to the kingdom of God now
[1:07:31] Luke comes right in here
[1:07:33] he's talking about this one verse
[1:07:37] covered the two men walking on the road
[1:07:40] of a myers he show himself to them
[1:07:43] infallible proof when he came through
[1:07:45] the water and show himself show his hand
[1:07:47] to Thomas and Thomas crying o my Lord
[1:07:50] and my god
[1:07:50] he showed himself and at the graveside
[1:07:54] he showed himself to the woman and all
[1:07:56] of these scriptures praise the Lord
[1:07:58] show himself true infallible proof I
[1:08:02] don't know what what is the time he okay
[1:08:04] it's just eight thirty eight I try to
[1:08:08] find a place to close here
[1:08:10] praise the Lord Matthew 27 let's look at
[1:08:21] Matthew 27 praise the Lord
[1:08:48] Matthew 27 verse 50 oh praise the Lord
[1:09:00] Jesus
[1:09:02] the scripture says here you know in
[1:09:09] there are Jesus when when he when he
[1:09:13] cried with a loud voice the other of the
[1:09:15] ghost and behold the veil in the temple
[1:09:19] rain in twins from the top to the bottom
[1:09:22] and the earth quake and the rocks rain
[1:09:27] verse 52 and the graves were opened and
[1:09:30] many bodies of the saints which slept
[1:09:34] arose now look it's just a firing year
[1:09:39] in in apse is just a moaning to tear
[1:09:43] fellows referring to this to whom also
[1:09:46] he showed himself alive after his
[1:09:50] passion by many infallible protein seen
[1:09:53] of them for today's scene of them for
[1:09:56] today's who adores I that was seen 40
[1:09:59] days now you realize that's what brother
[1:10:03] Branham took the scripture where he says
[1:10:05] hey Abraham and Sarah was walking
[1:10:08] through the city you know he was hauling
[1:10:11] Sarah Haines they were walking through
[1:10:12] the city said this is the city this is
[1:10:14] Jerusalem who you know they are looking
[1:10:17] at us let's go this way you know he says
[1:10:21] just in their 40 days period why because
[1:10:24] the Saints has come from out of the
[1:10:27] grave and Bourbon says they had a 40
[1:10:34] days period on the earth and when Jesus
[1:10:38] extended he went with them
[1:10:48] in Chapter 15 I mean these are just all
[1:10:55] notes I wrote down here I can hardly see
[1:10:58] them but yeah first Corinthians chapter
[1:11:03] 15
[1:11:17] remember the Bible says and the dead in
[1:11:19] Christ will rise first and we that alive
[1:11:22] will we will meet them and wear bottom
[1:11:26] since we'll have a time here on earth
[1:11:28] that is the very same thing that Luke
[1:11:30] testifying year because it happened if
[1:11:33] you happen the first time it's going to
[1:11:36] happen again some of these things are
[1:11:43] not just brother branham teaching there
[1:11:45] are biblical teachings they are right in
[1:11:47] the Bible first Corinthians chapter 15
[1:11:51] verse 3 for I believe for I delivered
[1:11:54] unto you first of all that that wish I
[1:11:59] also received how that Christ died for
[1:12:03] our sins according to the scripture and
[1:12:07] that he was buried and that he rose
[1:12:11] again the third day according to the
[1:12:14] scriptures and that he was seen of
[1:12:19] Cleophas them of the twelve after that
[1:12:24] he was seen of above five hundred
[1:12:31] brethren at once of whom the greater
[1:12:38] part remain unto this present but some
[1:12:44] are fallen asleep now so Paul year also
[1:12:48] testifying of this very same experience
[1:12:51] after he ascended he was seen of people
[1:12:58] you know he's testifying of this very
[1:13:01] same thing that the Luke is telling us
[1:13:03] here you know they're after Jesus
[1:13:07] resurrected before his ascension there
[1:13:13] was a forted for today's period of time
[1:13:15] that he's painting and there were many
[1:13:21] poor evening pleasure to the place were
[1:13:24] he testified he was seen of about five
[1:13:27] hundred at a time
[1:13:32] none of the gospel I mean that I give us
[1:13:36] that record I don't believe that Paul
[1:13:39] was just making up the story he says
[1:13:42] this is what I receive from all the
[1:13:48] testimony that I've gathered in people
[1:13:50] that testified they say yeah I was there
[1:13:54] in a meeting you know we were just
[1:13:56] gathering a little prayer meeting and
[1:13:58] our Lord Jesus just appear and the glory
[1:14:01] was around his face praise the Lord
[1:14:05] you know the thing about it there is
[1:14:08] that we just we just think about
[1:14:10] ourselves and sometimes we think that
[1:14:13] the little children that comes to the
[1:14:16] meeting and now also our witnesses but
[1:14:20] you ask this little kid they will tell
[1:14:22] you some of the things to see in service
[1:14:23] that you did not see praise the Lord
[1:14:28] you ask them they will tell you some of
[1:14:30] the things that see that you didn't that
[1:14:32] you know your eyes were not looking - oh
[1:14:34] yeah I saw the preacher when he did that
[1:14:37] praise the Lord
[1:14:38] you know how the kids will talk about oh
[1:14:40] yeah I saw one brother when when I
[1:14:43] better take a flint shake take off his
[1:14:45] shoes you know that's the thing that
[1:14:48] catches the eye attention you use you
[1:14:50] are flowing into the mystery and you are
[1:14:52] hearing the hallelujah amen
[1:14:54] the little kids are just looking at
[1:14:55] those little little information that
[1:15:00] when you when you get their account so
[1:15:03] when Paul talks about the 500 don't want
[1:15:06] to count the men and the women count the
[1:15:08] little ones that were there because some
[1:15:10] of these little kids that were over in
[1:15:12] Branum Tabernacle they can give us
[1:15:14] testimony or what they saw in the
[1:15:16] meeting sister Carol always talked about
[1:15:25] her experience at Marian devil's service
[1:15:30] just a young girl you know an innocent
[1:15:33] man go into the service and she's
[1:15:35] preparing for the service and I mean she
[1:15:37] she tells of what what she knows other
[1:15:40] time the thing that capture her mind
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:43] to honor my we never leave her model
[1:15:44] until she goes to glory
[1:16:00] pretty low let me go ahead yakking I
[1:16:01] can't highly see some of the verses that
[1:16:03] I wrote down the Minister of the bride
[1:16:07] and the minister of Christ is to seem a
[1:16:12] continuation now remember these former
[1:16:15] treated all to your fillers have I wrote
[1:16:18] to you that Jesus began to do and
[1:16:22] continue to do you know so better Bernal
[1:16:26] is putting us right back there in Acts
[1:16:28] chapter one and and and Happiness to
[1:16:31] understand what Luke was saying the
[1:16:33] thing that Jesus did and he taught he's
[1:16:39] continuing to do it he talked about a
[1:16:43] comforter to come he talks about a Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost the experiences in the upper room
[1:16:47] I'm again I'm getting to that authority
[1:16:49] of Allah I'm going to tell you what
[1:16:50] happened he talks about the Holy Ghost
[1:16:52] to come he talks about what you see in
[1:16:55] my ministry the work that I do greater
[1:16:57] works you would do and Peter just told
[1:16:59] me he and he and joined the race and
[1:17:02] lame man up and get beautiful you know
[1:17:05] and and and the things that he began to
[1:17:08] do the things that he taught it never
[1:17:11] stopped in his earthly ministry is
[1:17:13] continuing by the Holy Ghost he's back
[1:17:16] in the midst of the church in the form
[1:17:19] of the Holy Ghost these things that we
[1:17:21] read in the message they are not just
[1:17:23] there for brother Branham they are there
[1:17:26] for the bride are there for Christians
[1:17:28] today people to seek God or blessed are
[1:17:32] those that we know believe with our sin
[1:17:34] you know and I believe that's the people
[1:17:37] that we are that's the people that we
[1:17:40] are praise the Lord that we will believe
[1:17:44] all of these all of these testimonies
[1:17:46] that we that we hear you know I don't I
[1:17:50] don't seem so I don't want to be you
[1:17:53] know a little bit different but
[1:17:55] sometimes most of the people that was
[1:17:57] around I mean and it was so familiar
[1:17:59] with a lot of the things that I was
[1:18:01] happening in Jefferson there I mean some
[1:18:04] of these people are all going into
[1:18:06] crisis you know because some things that
[1:18:09] that is all and with information that
[1:18:12] they have today
[1:18:13] it's just it's just creating a lot of
[1:18:14] crisis for them why because they are
[1:18:17] looking at some some some physical
[1:18:20] things now um I said we received those
[1:18:22] things by testimony and bringing it back
[1:18:24] to the Word of God the Holy Spirit is
[1:18:26] happy also passed by the man it's taking
[1:18:30] us beyond the man praise the Lord
[1:18:33] some of the people they have sat right
[1:18:36] there and saw the healing ministry and
[1:18:38] all the things they saw I mean this
[1:18:40] picture is so much in your mind that
[1:18:42] they cannot pass the man they want him
[1:18:45] to come back from the grave but God by
[1:18:51] the Holy Spirit and the information that
[1:18:53] he has given us it makes us to go beyond
[1:18:56] the man into what God want to do in this
[1:19:00] age don't want to pick us up from where
[1:19:08] we are and use us in the little way
[1:19:13] there will not be an impersonation of
[1:19:16] what God did in that ministry Roberta
[1:19:18] Branham but God can use us in a little
[1:19:20] way he can use us as a housewife he can
[1:19:24] use us as a loving husband to our wives
[1:19:26] and our children he can use us in the
[1:19:29] simple way the book of us who go on and
[1:19:34] on and on us who will go through it if
[1:19:38] the Lord give us grace
[1:19:41] the former treaty all chile's have
[1:19:44] already that Jesus began to do and
[1:19:47] continue to do and it did not stop there
[1:19:50] in the book of ad he's continuing to do
[1:19:53] it today that's the place where we are
[1:19:56] getting home where Branham says
[1:19:58] continuing to do his death did not stop
[1:20:02] him no sir he returned again so two
[1:20:08] fellows were banished putting emphasis
[1:20:10] there on Luke
[1:20:11] conversation that his death did not stop
[1:20:14] him the things that he thought he never
[1:20:16] owned it a taught the disciples just for
[1:20:21] them to have notebook and have I mean oh
[1:20:24] yeah he said this year in 1957 he
[1:20:27] said this year no no no no the thing
[1:20:28] that he taught them he has come in the
[1:20:30] form of the holy spirit to make those
[1:20:33] things real among them deaf did not stop
[1:20:39] him but scared even when he died he went
[1:20:44] down to the grave he preached to those

[1:21:10] believe the message I was preaching
[1:21:11] Noah's dead in Moses day in Ezekiel day
[1:21:14] he testified to them and and and I mean
[1:21:17] wow every one of them coming to
[1:21:19] consciousness of war this is the one
[1:21:20] that Abraham talks about all this is the
[1:21:23] one that Moses was talking about the
[1:21:25] lawyer gosh I raised of a prophet he
[1:21:27] gave them a testimony he went down there

[1:22:18] again in the form of the Holy Spirit to
[1:22:22] continue the work continued on said the
[1:22:26] book of Acts Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:30] yesterday today and forever Byrd Branham
[1:22:33] said that is the talking that is the
[1:22:36] talking we are talking about
[1:22:37] that's the talking life
[1:22:40] that's why he gave his he want to give
[1:22:42] us that talking life so he can continue
[1:22:45] on the work that he had promised praise
[1:22:51] the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:22:59] praise the Lord if I keep going like
[1:23:06] this I can preach for another hour
[1:23:08] Revelation chapter 1 I will stop on this
[1:23:12] verse and give you something to read and
[1:23:16] steady Revelation chapter 1 let's read
[1:23:20] the scripture says the revelation of
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ which God gave to him who
[1:23:29] is to him the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:34] which God gave to him many times we
[1:23:38] think is John no that's not John Jesus
[1:23:41] had a revelation that he was baring he
[1:23:47] was supposed to reveal the father in
[1:23:49] flesh the revelation of Jesus cried with
[1:23:55] God gave to him to show unto his
[1:23:58] servants things which must shortly come
[1:24:01] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[1:24:06] his injured on to his seven John we will
[1:24:12] stop right there while he was bearing
[1:24:14] the revelation why in flesh he revealed
[1:24:18] a father he came back in the form of the
[1:24:21] Holy Ghost to revere the father in the
[1:24:24] many other bread reigns in the meaning
[1:24:28] of God's attributes he had a revelation
[1:24:35] of the father it was not a revelation of
[1:24:39] himself the revelation that God gave to
[1:24:42] him he was to declare the father and
[1:24:47] today we have the same revelation to
[1:24:50] declare the father
[1:24:54] because we are a continuation of that
[1:24:57] revelation the revelation we can see
[1:25:01] that God has given to us we have a
[1:25:05] revelation to declare the father that's
[1:25:14] the continuation of the book of Acts
[1:25:16] that's what the Holy Ghost is giving
[1:25:18] form that's what Luke is all excited
[1:25:22] here to share with you fellas he said
[1:25:26] all that Jesus began to do and teach and
[1:25:31] continue to do he continued to reveal
[1:25:35] himself he continued to show himself he
[1:25:40] loved to show up hey man why he was here
[1:25:46] he always had himself he goes by the
[1:25:50] riverside he goes and into the desert to
[1:25:54] stay there alone but when he came in the
[1:25:56] form of the Holy Ghost he loved to show
[1:25:59] up hey man he loved to show up he says
[1:26:04] wherever two or three I gather in my
[1:26:07] name I would be there he wants to show
[1:26:12] up in our homes he wants to show up in
[1:26:15] our situation give God an opportunity to
[1:26:19] show himself up in your situation oh you
[1:26:24] get a nice idea to solve the problem all
[1:26:27] of us it's beautiful but just keep God
[1:26:29] an opportunity Tim when you say Lord I
[1:26:31] place it in your hands don't start
[1:26:34] making planes place it in his hands and
[1:26:37] say Lord I'm just watching amen
[1:26:40] we put it in his hands and we made
[1:26:42] backup plane if you don't show up before
[1:26:44] this weekend this is what I'm going to
[1:26:45] do amen all give God an opportunity so
[1:26:52] he can show up in your situation because
[1:26:55] he loved to show up he loved to show up
[1:27:00] he loved for his children to see him
[1:27:06] so we can have a testimony we can have
[1:27:09] something to talk about the continuation
[1:27:12] of the book of Acts is the revelation of
[1:27:15] Jesus Christ that's what it is it's the
[1:27:21] revelation of Jesus Christ the same
[1:27:24] yesterday today and forever
[1:27:26] that's why the talking is all about
[1:27:30] that's what the talking life is all
[1:27:32] about
[1:27:35] it's Christ coming in bright form Christ
[1:27:42] coming in bright form the scripture says
[1:27:50] when Lazarus was sick the same for him
[1:27:55] he told him he was coming but he went a
[1:27:59] couple of days Johnny the more they were
[1:28:02] calling him the father he was going away
[1:28:05] praise the Lord the Father he was going
[1:28:10] away
[1:28:11] well after Jesus resurrected he was in
[1:28:18] that he was innocent in a celestial body
[1:28:25] so in their Celestra body he could
[1:28:29] travel as a thought he could move a
[1:28:35] little bit faster year there and other
[1:28:42] that's how he was showing himself to
[1:28:45] these many ones in 40 days it just gave
[1:28:50] me a little touch here that you were
[1:28:53] just trying to encourage showing showing
[1:28:56] up in a different prayer meetings going
[1:28:59] to the widows that believe in going in
[1:29:02] and even visiting the secret believers
[1:29:04] and encouraging them because of the
[1:29:10] sahih Drance council under the roman
[1:29:12] government there were many that was not
[1:29:15] showing himself up as disciples the
[1:29:17] because they did not wanted to be
[1:29:19] persecuted there were many secret secret
[1:29:23] believers and I believe when he
[1:29:28] resurrected he visited these ones in a
[1:29:31] special way maybe he never just went
[1:29:35] down and says well Joseph I'm alive
[1:29:38] but he passed by in a special way in his
[1:29:43] wife oh I saw someone like I was lon
[1:29:47] you know every time when he comes around
[1:29:49] you know that that sweet feeling someone
[1:29:51] just passed by let's go outside and
[1:29:53] check because all of this Romans was
[1:29:57] going around among the believer He is
[1:29:59] risen even Thomas did not believe it he
[1:30:06] says no or this your conspiracy theory
[1:30:09] I'm not going to believe it until I see
[1:30:11] it until I see I'm not going to believe
[1:30:16] it
[1:30:16] Lonnie oh how much how much Thomas loved
[1:30:21] him but there were just a lot of second
[1:30:25] stands around that was weakening his
[1:30:27] faith and when he showed up to that
[1:30:31] meeting that night it was not for
[1:30:32] everybody it was for Thomas he called
[1:30:35] him by name and say come on come on come
[1:30:38] on Thomas yes my hand put your finger he
[1:30:42] never called everybody he showed up at
[1:30:44] the meeting many saw him but he did that
[1:30:46] thing particularly for Thomas just to be
[1:30:49] able to raise his phone
[1:30:57] in such an hour God is moving he's doing
[1:31:03] things some things that will be
[1:31:07] testified and so sooner we get into the
[1:31:11] supernatural and started talks about
[1:31:12] what God is doing why should it be
[1:31:15] difficult for a brother or a sister to
[1:31:17] believe that God did this for another
[1:31:19] sister when a preacher come around is
[1:31:22] easy for us to believe it when the
[1:31:24] preacher says it but when the brother
[1:31:25] says it why should it be difficult is
[1:31:27] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:31:29] he's using common people he's showing
[1:31:31] himself to common people if you are
[1:31:37] expecting him and create an atmosphere
[1:31:39] of expectation he will show up in your
[1:31:43] situation he when I give you if he was
[1:31:50] show up and you would know that he was
[1:31:52] the one just like Thomas he said oh my
[1:31:55] lord oh my god praise the Lord
[1:32:00] let's bow our heads tonight
[1:32:14] we so appreciate I mean in our local
[1:32:19] assembly we have all of these little
[1:32:22] ones we have a lot of our sisters that
[1:32:25] are in the medical fee working in these
[1:32:27] nursing homes and fuel as they trust in
[1:32:32] the law to be to be nurses we have some
[1:32:35] you know working at the airport we have
[1:32:40] I mean people
[1:32:45] lab technicians we have I mean people
[1:32:49] that are in in different places
[1:32:52] different places
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:33:01] wherever
[1:33:02] wherever grace have put us grace want to
[1:33:07] use you grace want to be seen through
[1:33:11] you in that situation or in their
[1:33:16] through their position wherever grace
[1:33:19] have placed us that's the reason why if
[1:33:24] you apply for a set for a certain job
[1:33:25] and you don't get it don't feel bad
[1:33:27] friends have a place that he want to use
[1:33:30] you maybe go who have never used you in
[1:33:32] that place oh I think if Christians will
[1:33:38] start asking God for a job where he will
[1:33:40] use them then just looking for the
[1:33:45] higher paid job we will get job so
[1:33:48] easily we will love it and we will
[1:33:50] glorify the Father because God will use
[1:33:54] their to meet our every need
[1:34:00] what an awesome God he is
