[39:18] of
[39:19] God nobody is
[39:22] worthy to do this
[39:24] job it is your job job it is you that
[39:27] know how to break the
[39:29] bread but father Your Grace has pick men
[39:35] because you can never do without a man
[39:38] and that is why it has fallen our lot to
[39:40] reach your pride with the word of God so
[39:44] tonight father come Among Us in your
[39:47] special way break the bread again as the
[39:51] breading that walk with you miles they
[39:54] recognize you after the breaking of
[39:56] bread
[39:57] I believe we are going to do same if you

[40:09] seats turn your Bibles to the Book of
[40:14] Matthew Matthew
[40:19] 24 verse
[40:21] 35 a special test that I believe
[40:25] everyone is familiar with that
[40:29] test Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[40:34] but my words shall not pass
[40:37] away may the Lord add blessing to read
[40:39] of his word you can have your seat for
[40:44] now we are thankful that we have got
[40:46] opportunity to be in his
[40:49] presence this where Cain refused to
[40:53] walk but we are privileged to walk in
[40:55] his presence
[40:57] and there is nothing that can pull us
[40:59] away because we are part of him and we
[41:03] have been magnetized to him and when you
[41:05] are magnetized to God I don't see what
[41:09] can pull you apart there's nothing that
[41:11] can pull you away from
[41:13] God so I really appreciate my friend
[41:17] bran brother it's not because you are
[41:19] here bra said what you say at the back
[41:22] of the man say it at his
[41:25] presence don't speak good things when a
[41:28] brother is there and then you speak bad
[41:29] things behind
[41:30] him be bold and tell him to his brother
[41:33] you are not
[41:36] right and if you go behind him you say
[41:38] the same thing if he's good you go
[41:41] behind him say he's good in his present
[41:44] he's good you don't change your that is

[45:38] than love is
[45:41] corrective and love conquers everything
[45:45] if you have love you always conquer most
[45:48] of his sermons he explain how God used
[45:52] him tremendous because he love even
[45:55] animals you know the story how he loved
[45:57] them how he show passionate love yeah he
[46:01] said if you want to conquer you must
[46:03] have love yes that is the only tool that
[46:07] you can use to
[46:11] conquer he said your works the your work
[46:15] tells what you
[46:18] are we are talking of that is time
[46:21] tested
[46:22] memorials he said Heaven and Earth shall
[46:25] pass away yes but my word will not pass
[46:28] away that is the only Memorial we can
[46:31] talk
[46:32] about something that will not pass away
[46:36] it stands and it will stand forever and
[46:38] ever because the word is
[46:42] God you see a man's character is made
[46:47] known by his works right wherever you
[46:50] are you are always prove what you are
[46:54] yes no matter how much you
[46:58] testify whether you say Pro or con that
[47:03] has nothing to do it your always tells
[47:07] what you are tells what you are
[47:10] inside every job that you do manifest
[47:15] what you are yes praise the
[47:19] Lord I was in a
[47:23] fness and the pastor took me
[47:29] and when we were going there were many
[47:32] tourists a lot of people were going to
[47:34] that
[47:36] mountain but
[47:38] we have a perfect objective we have a
[47:42] vision we know where we were going yes
[47:46] many people were just walking oh just
[47:48] admiring the place the mountains but we
[47:50] know where we were going yes praise the
[47:54] Lord so talking Jesus Christ yesterday
[47:57] today and forever that is the3 he said
[48:00] you only see what you are looking
[48:04] for if you come here tonight looking for
[48:08] Jesus you will see him yes amen if you
[48:12] come here to
[48:14] criticize you have plenty to criticize
[48:18] amen plenty on your hands to criticize
[48:21] it depends on what you are looking
[48:24] for
[48:27] many people were moving we were moving
[48:29] and a lot of people going to the
[48:31] mountain but we were going to a specific
[48:34] place there's a special place that we
[48:36] had in our
[48:38] mind right so if you're here as a
[48:41] Christian you must have your destination
[48:44] in your mind you are not just here to be
[48:46] a Christian you are not just here to let
[48:48] people see you you are here because you
[48:51] have a destination amen prise the Lord
[48:55] you you must have that in
[48:59] mind time test the
[49:03] memorials the prophet said now look at
[49:08] Moses Moses and Pharaoh he said they use
[49:11] the same
[49:13] window but Moses was seeing
[49:16] predestinated Sons and Daughters of God
[49:19] through that window but Pharaoh used the
[49:21] same you know and he
[49:24] slaves in has what you want to see
[49:31] amen Abraham SE 59 that is what we go to
[49:37] look by faith and see like Moses looking
[49:42] out the same window that Pharaoh did
[49:45] upon the same people Pharaoh called them
[49:50] M
[49:51] duus that is all that he saw just a
[49:56] bunch of
[49:57] slips by faith Moses told them to be the
[50:01] promised
[50:02] people praise the Lord same
[50:05] window you can come and sit here on the
[50:08] seat but you preach this message when
[50:11] the man is falling everybody can grab at
[50:14] that congregation or at that that be
[50:16] beyond the camp there in the you can
[50:18] grab your man but they will go home and
[50:22] they will be hungry
[50:24] again
[50:26] everybody is eating Mana as we here but
[50:29] there are some people that will cross
[50:32] over and get behind the decks where the
[50:35] Mana is available every day it doesn't
[50:38] rot when you move to that Dimension you
[50:41] will feed every day you will never go
[50:43] hungry that is where I want you to
[50:46] be leave the campground mana and come to
[50:49] the holy of
[50:51] Hol
[50:54] right
[50:58] Joshua go told Joshua that Joshua when
[51:01] the priest get to
[51:04] Jordan let them stand still as Jordan
[51:09] part as Jordan part and then they walk
[51:12] on dry land let them stand
[51:14] still and let every tribe the head of
[51:18] each tribe pick a stone under the feet
[51:23] of where the priest stands you don't
[51:26] pick your store anywhere you want to
[51:28] pick but where the PRI is
[51:30] standing that is where you cannot pick
[51:32] any message you cannot but where brother
[51:35] BR
[51:36] stood that is the same message we have
[51:39] to present to you so the priest has they
[51:43] stood in Jordan and all this Tri they
[51:45] pick Stones under their
[51:48] feet and he said now when
[51:51] you get to the other side and your
[51:54] children children ask you what about
[51:57] these Stones tell them it's a
[52:04] memorial this is what God did to us when
[52:07] we Cross Jordan it dried up and we pick
[52:11] the
[52:11] stones he said it is a
[52:15] memorial and God said to Joshua we want
[52:18] to make a memorial onto this go out
[52:23] there and send each Israelite one out of
[52:27] a tribe and pick up 12 Stones and make a
[52:32] memorial and this Memorial shall be that
[52:35] when your children are passing through
[52:37] this way they will ask what caused these
[52:40] stones to be here and ye shall give them
[52:43] the story of how God stay the Jordan
[52:47] that is a wonderful memory someday I
[52:50] hope to look at those stones in the near
[52:54] future or where they they still stand as
[52:59] a memorial but then I think of another
[53:04] Memorial what a g breed Memorial that
[53:08] was they had a wonderful Memorial but we
[53:11] are here to talk of a memorial that
[53:14] nothing can really compete with that
[53:16] Memorial that is the word of
[53:20] God that's
[53:23] right the Hebrew children is a memorial
[53:27] we talk about how they were put in the
[53:30] fire but fire could not consume them we
[53:32] read the Bible it's a
[53:36] memorial you
[53:39] understand David stands as a
[53:42] memorial like we heard about
[53:45] David talk about him look at this lady
[53:48] David he stands as a
[53:50] memorial why because he stood on the
[53:54] word of God he heard the Revelation and
[53:58] he believed that God's word cannot
[54:02] fail and that is how he destroyed that
[54:06] giant that everybody was sced about they
[54:08] were afraid of gol in the message
[54:12] preparation so he go the one and the
[54:15] staff and he goes up there to his
[54:17] brothers to meet his brothers out of the
[54:21] field and this big giant run and
[54:27] R he R he happened to r that day before
[54:31] a wrong man that's
[54:34] right he has been roaring but that day
[54:37] he Roar before a wrong man brother if
[54:39] you have the Holy Ghost and you are
[54:43] firmly established on the
[54:46] Lord when somebody is holding God say so
[54:49] don't joke with that
[54:52] man God said so
[54:58] listen he R before a wrong man that
[55:02] day he has got the leeway he come and
[55:06] mess up and go free but that day there
[55:08] was a man at the camp yes that's
[55:12] right and David said what is happening

[1:19:18] will face all the challenges whatever
[1:19:20] situation that's the word of God amen
[1:19:24] amen I was recently in our
[1:19:27] cancers in Pastor a Martin convention
[1:19:31] this man is almost 91
[1:19:33] years there was prophecy many things in
[1:19:36] the meeting it was fantastic it was
[1:19:39] good but I observe
[1:19:42] that some of my friends ministers they
[1:19:45] have been Inus by the atmosphere
[1:19:51] andas you are a preacher you go
[1:19:53] everywhere have you been seen this this
[1:19:56] this wonderful
[1:19:58] experience I said brother it's good that
[1:20:02] prophecy and all those but let me tell
[1:20:04] you there is nothing greater than the
[1:20:07] word of
[1:20:09] God that said is they not saying that
[1:20:12] you should not prophesy the reason you
[1:20:14] cannot prophesy it means you are not up
[1:20:17] to the test you are not ready you are
[1:20:19] not ready to do anything for God let me
[1:20:21] tell you frankly many of us gift is
[1:20:24] sitting in you but you are not ready to
[1:20:26] use it you have hang your coat on the
[1:20:30] wall you pin it on the
[1:20:34] wall but I told them it's good but
[1:20:37] brother it is minor the word of God even
[1:20:41] if any prophecy come that is false is
[1:20:43] the word that check the prophecy so the
[1:20:47] word is supreme yes sir that's right
[1:20:50] correct I them
[1:20:56] amen then Jesus told him it's good that
[1:21:00] you build this Temple but I'm telling
[1:21:01] you it will all be pulled down but
[1:21:04] there's only one Memorial Heaven and
[1:21:07] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[1:21:09] not pass away

[1:53:03] here and uh uh over there in Joshua
[1:53:07] chapter 4 verse 7 the bible says then ye
[1:53:10] shall answer and said uh
[1:53:15] uh you shall
[1:53:18] answer answer them that the Waters of
[1:53:20] Jordan were cut off before the Arc of
[1:53:23] the Covenant of the Lord when it passed
[1:53:25] over Jordan the Waters of far Jordan
[1:53:28] were cut off and those stones shall be
[1:53:31] for a memorial unto your unto the
[1:53:33] children of Israel do you realize that
[1:53:37] as our brother was talking just now I
[1:53:39] went back to my notes and I was just
[1:53:40] looking at some things do you realize
[1:53:43] that
[1:53:44] uh when Elijah was about to go at the
[1:53:48] beginning of Elijah Ministry he had to
[1:53:51] build an altar of 12
[1:53:53] Stones now remember when God gave this
[1:53:56] instruction to Joshua there were 12
[1:53:58] Stones that were built in the River
[1:54:00] Jordan and there were 12 Stones that
[1:54:03] were built out of the River Jordan so
[1:54:06] there were two
[1:54:08] Memorial there were one that was outside
[1:54:11] and there was one that was in the middle
[1:54:14] if you go back and read the scripture
[1:54:15] rightly so Elijah came and then on my
[1:54:20] Cambell he had to rebuild the altar of
[1:54:23] the Lord and what did he do he took 12
[1:54:26] Stones
[1:54:28] again and build an
[1:54:30] altar before he left he took uh Elisha
[1:54:35] going down they had to go across
[1:54:39] Jordan he parted the River Jordan if the
[1:54:42] water was parted then definitely Elisha
[1:54:45] saw the memorial that Joshua
[1:54:48] built praise the Lord because it was an
[1:54:53] everlasting
[1:54:54] Memorial
[1:54:57] amen and then when John the Baptist came
[1:55:00] where was he preaching By The River
[1:55:04] Jordan but this time he did not point
[1:55:06] the people to
[1:55:09] Stones he point the people to the one
[1:55:12] that the memorial was speaking
[1:55:14] [Music]
