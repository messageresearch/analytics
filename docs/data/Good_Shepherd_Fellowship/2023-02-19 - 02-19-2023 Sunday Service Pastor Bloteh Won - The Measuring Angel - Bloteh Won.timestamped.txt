[53:24] Ezekiel chapter
[53:28] 47.
[53:31] Ezekiel chapter 47.
[53:35] I think I'm having
[53:38] to get around there quickly or as I run
[53:40] into crisis
[53:48] praise the Lord
[54:08] um Ezekiel chapter 47 let me quickly
[54:12] grab
[54:22] let's read from verse 1.
[54:25] let's read from verse 1 Ezekiel chapter
[54:28] 47 reading from verse 1. afterward
[54:32] he brought me again unto the door of the
[54:36] house and behold
[54:38] Waters issue out
[54:40] from under the threshold of the house
[54:44] Eastward
[54:46] praise the Lord
[54:49] and you know the the the
[54:51] Tabernacle the front part of the
[54:54] Tabernacle was always facing East
[54:58] so let me I just want to give you a
[55:00] mental picture so you can you can
[55:02] picture this is this is like this is a
[55:05] vision that Ezekiel is talking about
[55:07] yeah just to create a picture in your
[55:09] mind so uh uh uh this house was uh
[55:14] type of the temple you know what his
[55:17] word
[55:18] so water issue out from under the
[55:21] threshold of the house Eastward
[55:24] from
[55:27] from the Forefront of the house too
[55:31] towards the east and the water came down
[55:35] from under from the right side of the
[55:38] house to the south side of the altar
[55:42] then brought he me out of the weight of
[55:46] the get northward and led me about the
[55:50] way without
[55:54] to get by the way that looketh Eastward
[55:58] and behold they ran out Waters on the
[56:02] right side and when the man the heart
[56:06] the line in his hands when fought his
[56:09] word he measured a thousand cubits and
[56:14] he brought me through the waters and the
[56:17] waters were
[56:19] to the uncle
[56:22] again he measured a thousand and brought
[56:26] me
[56:27] through the waters and the waters
[56:31] were told their knees again he measured
[56:36] its housing and brought me in true
[56:40] the waters
[56:42] he brought me through the waters were to
[56:45] the lens now and if you pictured in your
[56:47] mind uh Ezekiel in this vision is led by
[56:51] an Angel and a measuring Angel and as
[56:54] the angel is bringing him into the water
[56:59] this water that is gauching out from
[57:02] from art from out of the temple from the
[57:04] threshold of the temple is coming out
[57:07] and as as the angel brings him every
[57:09] thousand uh uh measurement the water
[57:13] coming from his uh his his angle to his
[57:17] knees and to his looms and uh and and
[57:21] afterward verse 5 he measured a thousand
[57:24] and and it was a river
[57:29] that I could now pass over
[57:34] for the water were raising
[57:37] Waters to swim in
[57:40] a river that could not be passed over
[57:44] praise the Lord so almost another sense
[57:47] is that this this water that was
[57:50] gulching out swept him from off his feet
[57:56] and there was no no more time for
[57:59] walking it was time to swim
[58:01] amen
[58:02] praise the Lord
[58:04] let's go to Revelation chapter 11.
[58:10] Revelation chapter 11 we will take one
[58:12] verse from there
[58:17] and then I will allow you to sit while I
[58:20] remain standing
[58:32] praise the Lord is that not the truth
[58:33] you say that remain standing
[58:38] Revelation chapter 11 let's read verse
[58:41] 1.
[58:45] and there was giving me a read
[58:49] like onto Iran
[58:52] and the angel still saying rise
[58:57] and measure
[58:59] the temple of God
[59:03] their altar
[59:06] and them
[59:07] that word and then their worship they're
[59:11] in
[59:12] I want to read that again
[59:15] and there was giving me a reef
[59:18] like onto a road
[59:21] and they injured still saying rise and
[59:24] measure the temple of God the Altar and
[59:28] them that worship now you have to
[59:30] realize three things I measure you
[59:32] the temple is measured
[59:34] the altar is measured
[59:37] the worshipers
[59:38] I measure
[59:40] praise the Lord
[59:43] chapter 21
[59:56] . I say I was going to allow you to sit
[59:58] but it looks like you didn't want it to
[1:00:03] so I would keep you up again for uh
[1:00:06] for one more verse
[1:00:15] verse 15 21 verse 15.
[1:00:22] this is about the holy city
[1:00:25] verse 15. and he and he that talked with
[1:00:30] me had a golden Reed to measure the city
[1:00:35] that gets thereof
[1:00:37] and the walls there are three things I
[1:00:40] also measured here let us pray

[1:02:13] years I appreciate I preached this
[1:02:15] message here
[1:02:17] uh on the measuring injury
[1:02:20] but uh uh
[1:02:23] there was something that was happening
[1:02:25] to my
[1:02:26] to my my iPad one time it kind of freeze
[1:02:31] I mean a setting up kind of frees on me
[1:02:35] and then I had I had I had some of my
[1:02:37] notes in their app it's one of my study
[1:02:40] abs
[1:02:41] and I was trying to move it up and down
[1:02:43] so I was trying to be smart I said okay
[1:02:45] well so since you want to behave like
[1:02:48] this I would delete you and reinstall
[1:02:51] you
[1:02:51] you know and uh and I deleted the app
[1:02:57] and uh and and reinstall the app
[1:03:01] and then when I did
[1:03:03] and when I did uh
[1:03:06] I reinstalled the app it started working
[1:03:08] I went I went back to go and find my
[1:03:10] notes they were all gone
[1:03:14] so uh
[1:03:16] I lost it somewhere in the clouds
[1:03:23] so I was thinking about this uh
[1:03:26] back there in in South Africa that's one
[1:03:30] of the brothers that had a great greet
[1:03:32] the meeting before I speak and then he
[1:03:34] came up and then he read uh uh
[1:03:37] revelation
[1:03:38] 11 and when he read it the thought hit
[1:03:41] my mind I said yeah I think uh
[1:03:44] that that calling shot with the
[1:03:46] measuring injure
[1:03:48] and so I went back and started looking
[1:03:50] for my notes and then I realized oh God
[1:03:53] it's gone
[1:03:55] it's it's somewhere there in the cloud
[1:03:57] but uh I started thinking about it there
[1:03:59] were a few things that came in my heart
[1:04:01] and I thought that well I might go back
[1:04:02] and preach on the measuring engine my
[1:04:06] note is gone but the Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:09] and we just need to find an inspiration
[1:04:12] and the Lord will bless it so we will be
[1:04:14] speaking on the measuring angel
[1:04:17] this morning yeah
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:21] and we have to realize that we are
[1:04:25] dealing with a god of precision
[1:04:28] a God that loves measurement
[1:04:32] a God that loves measurement
[1:04:35] is a god of measurement
[1:04:37] and uh uh as we as you look into the
[1:04:41] scripture

[1:06:05] keeping yourself updated with uh things
[1:06:08] that are happening uh there there are a
[1:06:11] lot of religious things that have been
[1:06:13] going on uh
[1:06:16] I've been following this uh news of a
[1:06:19] group of people that have been looking
[1:06:21] close into California uh prophecy and it
[1:06:26] was very strange that uh this person
[1:06:28] that was that was uh pulling up these
[1:06:31] things was able to look at few people
[1:06:34] that have prophesied about California
[1:06:36] thinking and uh and and uh and they also
[1:06:40] talk blood brand and prophecy as an
[1:06:43] outstanding prophecy concerning
[1:06:45] californium and uh and also uh uh uh the
[1:06:51] there's a big religious persecution
[1:06:54] that's that's been happening around you
[1:06:57] know uh in
[1:06:59] most part of the word Indian India is
[1:07:03] having the big one there uh
[1:07:09] the the government being cracking down
[1:07:11] on churches and different things and uh
[1:07:15] Brad told me the
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:21] churches in
[1:07:24] um
[1:07:24] even in the bamako area there's uh
[1:07:28] Burkina Faso that's that's West Africa
[1:07:33] they have been having some some problems
[1:07:35] there so I mean they have different
[1:07:37] things that just been happening around
[1:07:40] that people have been keeping close
[1:07:43] eyeshadow and uh and you know and and
[1:07:47] but another one there's there's turned
[1:07:51] out to become something big around the
[1:07:54] religious world in America is uh is over
[1:07:58] in Kentucky and turkey
[1:08:00] and now I think this is going into the
[1:08:03] second week now uh there is there is a
[1:08:07] university a Christian University
[1:08:11] it is actually a Methodist University
[1:08:15] that was the University there brother uh
[1:08:19] Omen evil came from ominiva actually
[1:08:22] came from that University
[1:08:24] and uh that University was is actually
[1:08:30] started right after John Wesley Revival
[1:08:36] you know when uh when when John Wesley
[1:08:39] started preaching and uh you know uh the
[1:08:43] the Wesley Revival of sanctification
[1:08:45] started hitting you know the the world
[1:08:48] from England they came over to the uni
[1:08:51] to the United States and you know uh it
[1:08:54] was after that that they started that
[1:08:57] University there but it has a history
[1:09:01] it has a history of of of an outbreak of
[1:09:07] of uh Revival experience
[1:09:11] and uh when I look at
[1:09:16] I was looking into that
[1:09:18] let me see if I can
[1:09:22] is the houseboro university in Kentucky
[1:09:26] uh
[1:09:28] it's in a little city called Wilma Wilma
[1:09:30] in Kentucky
[1:09:32] and uh it has its history go as far back
[1:09:37] as to 1905.
[1:09:40] and now
[1:09:43] that's their Revival history 1905 1908
[1:09:47] 1921
[1:09:49] 1950 1958
[1:09:52] 1970 was one of the one that is known
[1:09:56] it's known because that 1970 Revival
[1:10:02] spread out you know it was it was a big
[1:10:05] thing in uh in in the U.S and it started
[1:10:09] hitting different universities campers
[1:10:12] you know and all of that
[1:10:15] and I was listening to uh one of the
[1:10:18] guys that were that was leading the
[1:10:20] University at a time I think he was the
[1:10:24] dean or one of the the the the guys that
[1:10:27] were there uh Dr King Lord and he was he
[1:10:30] was testifying he has gone over to
[1:10:33] Canada and why he was over in Canada uh
[1:10:37] you know the thing called him that you
[1:10:41] know those universities they would have
[1:10:42] Chopper you know they would have Chopper
[1:10:45] every morning they would get in their
[1:10:47] Chopper and someone will speak and then
[1:10:50] from there speaking uh uh you know they
[1:10:54] were prayed and they would do their
[1:10:55] Chapel thing and this it happens that
[1:10:58] this morning uh back there in 1970s
[1:11:02] after Chopper you know uh they started
[1:11:05] praying and the praying just went on
[1:11:07] they would not stop
[1:11:10] they just kept praying and kept praying
[1:11:13] and kept praying and kept praying you
[1:11:14] know and the thing called Dr King's law
[1:11:17] and says we have a problem you know and
[1:11:20] uh uh Dr King's law was worried what you
[1:11:24] know what's going on you know he says
[1:11:26] Chopper Chopper will not stop
[1:11:29] you know Chopper keep going on you know
[1:11:32] so uh but the the background the
[1:11:36] background of this
[1:11:38] is that a
[1:11:40] ah is it actually started as
[1:11:44] as a burden now remember now because
[1:11:47] this this University have had a history
[1:11:51] of uh of of an outbreak of Revival and
[1:11:56] movement among them it has it has always
[1:11:59] created that Crave in the hearts of the
[1:12:02] people to always experience something
[1:12:05] you know so there will be there will be
[1:12:08] a time where the but I I call into that
[1:12:11] I took uh King's law he says it actually
[1:12:13] started from a young lady that had a
[1:12:16] burden
[1:12:17] you know so they started a small group
[1:12:20] of just six person
[1:12:22] and uh and uh they decided that
[1:12:26] every morning they would get together
[1:12:28] and pray for 30 minutes
[1:12:30] they would just have their own uh uh you
[1:12:34] know uh
[1:12:36] time together prayed and steady whatever
[1:12:38] time they're just they're just devoted
[1:12:41] 30 minutes
[1:12:43] every morning for 30 days
[1:12:47] you know they were they were being
[1:12:50] accountable to one another you know and
[1:12:52] you know and they were just they were
[1:12:54] just gathered together and you know talk
[1:12:57] about their experience you know confess
[1:12:59] their weaknesses they have struggled to
[1:13:01] one another you know and all of that so
[1:13:04] at the end of their 30 days
[1:13:09] they went to Chopper and then they
[1:13:12] started testifying of their experiences
[1:13:14] and they decided they had to you know
[1:13:16] all of those six each one now will start
[1:13:21] a group of six on their own
[1:13:23] you know uh so it was it was uh you know
[1:13:27] six times six group that started and on
[1:13:31] and only went with that until this
[1:13:34] fateful day of February uh
[1:13:39] Ted 1970
[1:13:42] but February 2nd
[1:13:45] while they were having their their
[1:13:47] morning devotion
[1:13:48] you know uh
[1:13:51] you know they will always ask one
[1:13:53] another do you do you do you believe
[1:13:56] that we can you know we we can do you
[1:13:59] believe that we can have an experience
[1:14:01] you know and then one of the young man
[1:14:03] says he says that this place is so you
[1:14:07] know uh uh I'm feeling so blessed and I
[1:14:09] think that this thing is going to happen
[1:14:11] and definitely on the third they have
[1:14:14] that outbreak but one of the things that
[1:14:17] struck me as I was I was I was looking
[1:14:19] today is I've been looking through it
[1:14:21] the entire week I mean
[1:14:24] uh the university I mean all through the
[1:14:27] week I mean people from all over the
[1:14:29] country has been going to Can Turkey uh
[1:14:32] uh because of what is happening there
[1:14:34] now there is a whole lot of a mix I'm
[1:14:37] saying this to be able to bring you to a
[1:14:39] place there's a whole lot of a mix
[1:14:43] you know but uh there was something that
[1:14:45] Dr King's King law said that that you
[1:14:49] know that interests me in that I
[1:14:51] appreciate it he said
[1:14:53] you know uh this this this whole thing
[1:14:57] started because of an Earnest dealing
[1:15:01] with personal sin
[1:15:04] disobedient and personal problems
[1:15:10] it was not it was not uh a kind of for
[1:15:14] everybody think it was few individuals
[1:15:17] that felt that the need to address some
[1:15:20] things in their lives
[1:15:23] if the god of the Bible is truth they
[1:15:27] wanted to experience him
[1:15:29] oh man yes praise the Lord
[1:15:33] you know and uh
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] I mean what do we do most of the time I
[1:15:41] remember if if some of you remember
[1:15:43] brother brother Vincent
[1:15:46] that was with us here the professor he
[1:15:48] he's over in Indiana teaching one of
[1:15:51] those universities so one one uh you
[1:15:54] know one time all the professors they
[1:15:56] were asking because they are only
[1:15:57] Christians professors that teach at
[1:15:59] those universities so that we give them
[1:16:01] an opportunity to speak so I think uh
[1:16:05] they gave him an opportunity one time to
[1:16:08] speak and then he called me on the phone
[1:16:11] you know he wanted me to listen to his
[1:16:13] uh his exhortation that morning
[1:16:16] called me on the phone and said well
[1:16:18] brother one you have to pray for me you
[1:16:20] know uh I'm having this uh uh time here
[1:16:25] to to be able to speak so they do all of
[1:16:28] that but then what happened after that
[1:16:30] is that they gave you know opportunity
[1:16:33] to the young students to come and tell
[1:16:36] their experience
[1:16:37] and and and when they come up to tell
[1:16:40] their experience
[1:16:42] you know they are dealing with with
[1:16:46] personal things
[1:16:48] you know and and even even what is going
[1:16:52] on there now now not at the University
[1:16:55] right now as you and myself are talking
[1:16:57] you know I mean people have been having
[1:16:59] all night staying all night you know on
[1:17:03] uh down there
[1:17:04] and what is going on now is the other
[1:17:07] you know uh all of these young people
[1:17:10] crying out you know uh uh uh publicly
[1:17:14] you know uh uh confessing their thoughts
[1:17:18] of uh those are struggling with smoking
[1:17:21] you know vaping pornographic and all of
[1:17:24] the adages you know uh crying out you
[1:17:27] know and uh uh and one thing he says is
[1:17:30] that the emphasis was not on the gift of
[1:17:35] the of the spirit the emphasis was on
[1:17:38] repentance
[1:17:40] and confession
[1:17:43] you see that was the thing that was
[1:17:46] missing in the Pentecostal Revival
[1:17:48] because the emphasis was on the gift
[1:17:52] praise the Lord and and and and the
[1:17:55] thing about it there is that the people
[1:17:58] that are still struggling with sin can
[1:18:01] be gifted
[1:18:04] amen they can be gifted they can be
[1:18:07] anointed but yet they can be possessed
[1:18:16] praise the Lord now so you see yeah uh
[1:18:20] and and what is happening here you know
[1:18:22] that I'm completely sidetracking here
[1:18:25] but I pray that the holy spirit will
[1:18:27] bring everything together and uh but
[1:18:29] what is happening here is the other uh
[1:18:32] you have some people other people too
[1:18:34] that are standing back and being a
[1:18:36] little bit critical of everything that
[1:18:38] is going on there and I will tell you a
[1:18:41] big bunch of data people around the
[1:18:42] message and uh uh uh you know when when
[1:18:46] you know when you see the uh you know a
[1:18:48] community like that of uh of young
[1:18:51] people you know uh I mean you look at
[1:18:55] the address code and you look at the the
[1:18:57] way they are you says well that cannot
[1:18:59] be God you know and and and here is it
[1:19:03] we have all the dress called but we
[1:19:05] dress scene in necktie we dress scene in
[1:19:09] decency
[1:19:10] praise the lord we put the Bible on our
[1:19:13] arm and then we can play out all the
[1:19:16] religious God and yet instead we are
[1:19:18] burning on the scene
[1:19:21] amen I think I would want to go to a
[1:19:24] place like that where people are
[1:19:26] confessing they are saying to be able to
[1:19:28] gain the courage and say God help me
[1:19:30] help me I need you
[1:19:32] praise the Lord
[1:19:34] then for me to stand back and see the
[1:19:36] young lady crying and say well see the
[1:19:38] way she dresses I cannot be God
[1:19:42] said
[1:19:45] praise the Lord
[1:19:51] there is a lot of controversy about it
[1:19:53] yeah I mean I don't you know the thing
[1:19:55] about it there is that I would tell you
[1:19:58] if you have not experienced a Revival
[1:20:01] you don't know what it is
[1:20:04] if you have really never experienced a
[1:20:07] Revival you don't know what it is
[1:20:11] glory be to God
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:14] a Revival like brother Brown Shades is
[1:20:17] it's a time of cleaning out
[1:20:19] it's a time of purging
[1:20:22] praise the lord it's a time of purging
[1:20:25] where you are desperately in need of God
[1:20:29] is yeah the the the grace of God is
[1:20:32] helping you to identify things in your
[1:20:34] life
[1:20:35] and you want to get rid of it
[1:20:40] praise the Lord you want to get rid of
[1:20:43] it so that was what the experienced in
[1:20:46] uh 1970 that was one of the biggest
[1:20:51] outbreak there uh uh uh at the Asbury
[1:20:55] University
[1:20:56] and I mean it was you know there's a big
[1:20:59] move on there you can follow a lot of a
[1:21:01] lot of documentary on there and then
[1:21:03] they had another one again in in 1992
[1:21:06] 2006 and it looks like this one they
[1:21:10] have in this year is it's a big thing
[1:21:12] now you have to you have to realize you
[1:21:15] know uh people can only walk in the
[1:21:18] measure of the word that is given to
[1:21:21] them
[1:21:23] praise the Lord
[1:21:24] they can only walk in the measure of the
[1:21:27] word that is given to them
[1:21:29] praise the Lord
[1:21:31] and and and that that Revival uh uh uh
[1:21:36] you have to know uh uh the the the the
[1:21:39] the Wesley Revival was all about
[1:21:43] sanctification
[1:21:44] it was about uh uh uh you know cleansing
[1:21:49] it was about identifying confessing you
[1:21:52] know and cleansing and and when when I
[1:21:55] when I listened to the report that are
[1:21:57] coming from out of there I said I says
[1:22:00] they are just under the shadow of their
[1:22:01] Revival even though the time of their
[1:22:04] Revival has passed but they are just
[1:22:06] under the shadow you see God is uh uh uh
[1:22:10] you cannot put God In The Box
[1:22:13] you can put God In The Box
[1:22:17] praise the Lord
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] no doubt there there are many that are
[1:22:24] going to come out of there after they
[1:22:26] have gone through all of their they are
[1:22:28] going to come out of there and and they
[1:22:31] are going to struggle with different
[1:22:32] things
[1:22:33] because brother Branham taught us he
[1:22:36] said when when God moves the devil moves
[1:22:38] also
[1:22:40] okay you have all of these all of these
[1:22:43] uh celebrity coming down from uh
[1:22:45] California you know all of these ones
[1:22:48] that are into gospel music that are all
[1:22:50] you know that they have sort themselves
[1:22:52] out to the devil you know and they are
[1:22:55] all trying to go into the meeting there
[1:22:57] and identify with that you know some are
[1:23:00] going to criticize and they're just a
[1:23:02] mix of spirits
[1:23:04] hmm
[1:23:08] praise the Lord
[1:23:11] but you see this the thing then is that
[1:23:14] that the the the the the shoe grab our
[1:23:17] attention is that uh you know if if if
[1:23:20] uh if if there's a group of people that
[1:23:22] are out crying out for God
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:28] where should we be
[1:23:32] where should we be
[1:23:34] we can be playing Church
[1:23:39] if there's a group of people that are
[1:23:41] crying out for for for the Holy Ghost
[1:23:43] and in media I mean they are crying out
[1:23:46] for God to be real to them
[1:23:51] and we have a professing bride of Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ for the rapture
[1:23:59] praise the Lord
[1:24:04] it's not something that's happened 10
[1:24:05] years ago is something that is happening
[1:24:07] right now as I'm speaking to you from
[1:24:10] this pulpit
[1:24:16] are we together
[1:24:30] praise the Lord
[1:24:32] I've just been praying I'm I'm saying
[1:24:34] Lord
[1:24:36] uh
[1:24:37] just
[1:24:40] just do something for us
[1:24:42] you know we get we get to that place of
[1:24:45] uh of uh of all the things that we know
[1:24:48] we started with all of these things you
[1:24:50] know brother Brian said there will be no
[1:24:51] National Revival Burbank says you know
[1:24:54] what the Revival is over but balances we
[1:24:56] we know all of those all of those things
[1:24:58] are just intellect
[1:25:02] you can put God In The Box
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:08] you can put God In The Box
[1:25:11] all I'm saying is the other if uh if
[1:25:15] those people are crying now for God if
[1:25:17] the Deep color too deep there is a deep
[1:25:19] to respond
[1:25:25] we can have the kind of a attitude
[1:25:27] careless attitude that we have towards
[1:25:30] the things of God and then criticize
[1:25:33] people that are wanting more of God
[1:25:37] if you don't want more of God get out of
[1:25:39] the way
[1:25:47] that's right praise the Lord
[1:25:49] so we want to look at this this uh
[1:25:51] measuring Angel as I said put on your
[1:25:54] calendar we will have uh Crosby with us
[1:25:58] in the March 10 11 and 12. so uh I hope
[1:26:02] you remember that now we will remind you
[1:26:04] as we go back we want to look at this we
[1:26:07] want to look at this and and uh talking
[1:26:10] on the on the measuring engine brother
[1:26:13] Branham used their scripture that
[1:26:15] Ezekiel scripture in the message uh
[1:26:19] the sadisan church age now when he read
[1:26:23] that Ezekiel 47 he said this he says and
[1:26:27] the way that it was done was by God's
[1:26:32] perfect way
[1:26:33] and programming
[1:26:35] now he's using the angel taking Ezekiel
[1:26:39] you know to to to the water that is
[1:26:43] pouring out out of the temple from the
[1:26:45] threshold of the temple the angel is
[1:26:47] taking Ezekiel in us as Ezekiel goes
[1:26:50] towards the water the angel we measure
[1:26:53] there is a measure that is given and
[1:26:56] that measure is just as far as his uncle
[1:26:59] now Barbarian would take that and and
[1:27:02] and make us to understand how every age
[1:27:06] got a measure of God
[1:27:10] praise the Lord
[1:27:11] so he would take that now he's he's
[1:27:14] taking that that vision of Ezekiel to be
[1:27:17] able to to make us to understand how
[1:27:20] there was a measure given to every age
[1:27:24] he says and that he says and the way
[1:27:27] that it was done was by God's perfect
[1:27:30] will and God's programming there the
[1:27:33] Lutheran heart the Holy Ghost
[1:27:35] potentially on a justification it was a
[1:27:38] measure
[1:27:39] that was just
[1:27:41] at the ankle level
[1:27:45] praise the Lord are we together
[1:27:48] he says the motherless heart is
[1:27:52] potentially on the sanctification
[1:27:56] and today is brought back a restoration
[1:28:00] that's the pentecustom the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:03] here
[1:28:04] are we together
[1:28:06] amen so it was the ankle leveled and the
[1:28:11] need and then the limbs
[1:28:13] but when the angel took him to the next
[1:28:16] level is sweping off his feet
[1:28:21] he had to swim his way through
[1:28:24] [Laughter]
[1:28:26] praise the Lord amen
[1:28:30] I don't know what level you are
[1:28:36] praise the Lord
[1:28:37] brother bam says yeah he says Be
[1:28:39] watchful
[1:28:42] and strengthen the things that remain it
[1:28:45] that
[1:28:47] are ready to die that's that's that's uh
[1:28:50] that's talking to that church age now
[1:28:52] the idea
[1:28:56] now the idea Express
[1:28:59] in the two words watchful and
[1:29:01] strengthened at least to wash contain
[1:29:05] not only the idea of being awake but to
[1:29:10] be alert
[1:29:12] to be otherwise
[1:29:15] anything with a danger and loss
[1:29:20] so strengthen means more than just to
[1:29:23] give strength a means to be fixed and
[1:29:26] established
[1:29:27] for permanency
[1:29:31] are we together
[1:29:35] these two commands refer to what is left
[1:29:39] of the truth
[1:29:41] which itself is ready or about to die
[1:29:45] now brother Branham is describing the
[1:29:48] sadism Church age to make us to see that
[1:29:52] the truth in that age was about to die
[1:29:56] out but the spirit called out to thy age
[1:30:00] and say Be watchful
[1:30:01] amen and strengthen what you have
[1:30:07] praise the Lord
[1:30:09] and then what what a time we can bring
[1:30:11] there because we realize that everything
[1:30:14] that affects all the church ages comes
[1:30:17] right down to our age
[1:30:20] praise the Lord
[1:30:22] amen
[1:30:23] it comes down to our age so we can even
[1:30:26] apply that to our age when we see how uh
[1:30:30] uh uh uh the churches are dying out and
[1:30:35] we see that uh you know there's there's
[1:30:38] a very poor example of of Christianity
[1:30:41] all of those things now the little truth
[1:30:45] that you have the the the the the the
[1:30:47] the place where the Lord has quickened
[1:30:50] the word to you to make the the message
[1:30:52] real or to make the coming of the Lord
[1:30:55] real why not you strengthen it
[1:31:00] praise the lord it's not supposed to be
[1:31:03] just a head knowledge
[1:31:06] it's supposed to be something that is
[1:31:08] influencing our life
[1:31:14] are we together
[1:31:20] this expression of the spirit comes
[1:31:23] before me as an illustration you know he
[1:31:26] is going to uh bring it into uh a little
[1:31:31] illustration here where he's talking
[1:31:33] about uh you know a group of people in
[1:31:36] bondage physically and uh uh and and
[1:31:40] trying to find a way to get out of there
[1:31:43] to escape out of there but uh let's
[1:31:45] let's move on yet a little bit Wednesday
[1:31:48] night we uh uh you know we we use this
[1:31:52] quote over in invisible Union where
[1:31:54] brother Branham says but watch when the
[1:31:56] spiritual bride when she begin to have a
[1:31:59] Revival
[1:32:00] when she began to come back and line
[1:32:03] herself up with the word of God and our
[1:32:07] emphasis Wednesday night was that is the
[1:32:10] bride Revival
[1:32:12] stay in line
[1:32:15] praise the Lord
[1:32:17] stay in line
[1:32:19] that's the bride Revival to keep in line
[1:32:24] the every effort we make to line up our
[1:32:26] life and line up ourselves with the word
[1:32:29] of God you are being in Revival
[1:32:34] because what was that uh a word did in
[1:32:37] Revelation chapter 3 uh uh uh
[1:32:41] uh uh to to them that I love
[1:32:46] amen amen
[1:32:49] what was the crowd of the spirit repent
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:56] that was the Cry of the spirit
[1:33:00] to them that I love and I trust him
[1:33:03] the spirit cried was to repent
[1:33:08] so brother bear I'm saying here is that
[1:33:11] uh when when when that spiritual bride
[1:33:13] begins to have a Revival when she begins
[1:33:17] to come back and line herself up with
[1:33:19] the world watch again and and you see
[1:33:21] how that the scripture at that time
[1:33:25] there will be a message that would sweep
[1:33:27] out to catch that bride catch that woman
[1:33:30] the Elitch praise the Lord
[1:33:33] for us the words sit on the deceiver who
[1:33:36] deceive the first bride to sinning
[1:33:40] against God by misbelieving his word now
[1:33:43] today as we see the church natural in in
[1:33:48] your intellectual gospel Glory father
[1:33:50] and father
[1:33:52] from the word
[1:33:54] in social groups we find them we we find
[1:33:58] that the woman of the word on the street
[1:34:01] members of such carrying themselves in
[1:34:04] the same atmosphere praise the Lord you
[1:34:08] can tell them they they have lost all
[1:34:10] sense of common decency and the people
[1:34:12] and that's the way it is uh the church
[1:34:16] has and you can see it going straight to
[1:34:19] the incommunical council
[1:34:21] just as setting as anything in the word
[1:34:24] and right into room as hard as they can
[1:34:28] go see cause it's prophesied Amen
[1:34:32] that's her behavior but then watch again
[1:34:36] the spiritual church how how that group
[1:34:39] of people call out elect through every
[1:34:43] Revival if in in in in Martin Luther
[1:34:46] time it happened just the same way in
[1:34:51] the in the Reformation it happens the
[1:34:54] same thing just like in John Wesley time
[1:34:57] it happened the same thing and when
[1:34:58] Pentecostal started what was happening
[1:35:00] bringing the people back to the word
[1:35:04] amen amen that's what was happening
[1:35:07] bringing the people back to line up with
[1:35:10] the word
[1:35:12] now so when we look at the the what I
[1:35:14] want to for us to to uh to do it on uh
[1:35:18] grab your attention here is that uh just
[1:35:22] like how the angel in uh uh Ezekiel was
[1:35:27] taking Ezekiel uh uh through this flood
[1:35:31] of water that have break out of the
[1:35:33] threshold from the temple and and the
[1:35:36] angel was taking him and and in every
[1:35:39] step he had a he had a measurement he
[1:35:42] had an experience you know on his ankle
[1:35:46] his knee his lungs and then he got to
[1:35:48] the place where he was overwhelmed you
[1:35:50] know he was taking off his feet he had
[1:35:52] to swim his way through now God was just
[1:35:55] showing Ezekiel the outpouring of the
[1:35:58] spirit
[1:36:00] how he was going today with his people
[1:36:03] by measure in every age
[1:36:06] praise the Lord Amen in every age there
[1:36:10] was going to be an outpouring of God's
[1:36:13] spirit to be able to bring his people
[1:36:15] back brother Baron says in a message
[1:36:17] Oneness he says that's the reason why
[1:36:19] the Holy Ghost was pulled out he was God
[1:36:23] Gathering his children back to himself
[1:36:26] he says that great big Pillar of Fire
[1:36:28] distributed himself and and and and and
[1:36:31] there was clothing tongues on on
[1:36:33] everyone head they had a little bit of
[1:36:36] that fire it was it was almighty God
[1:36:38] Gathering himself back
[1:36:41] to himself
[1:36:43] praise the Lord now so but if you look
[1:36:47] over here in Revelation chapter 11 now
[1:36:50] you have to see that this is right after
[1:36:53] Revelation chapter 10
[1:36:56] where it talks about the mystery of God
[1:36:59] being revealed it talks about the seven
[1:37:02] angel now Revelation 10 comes you have
[1:37:05] to realize it's the same Angel The
[1:37:07] Mighty angel that is the measuring angel
[1:37:10] the measuring angel in every age is the
[1:37:14] mighty angel now so here in Revelation
[1:37:17] chapter 11 there was giving me a read
[1:37:20] like unto a road the angels to sing rise
[1:37:25] and measure the temple
[1:37:28] measure the altar
[1:37:32] and the worshipers therein
[1:37:36] so the temple have a measurement
[1:37:40] the altar
[1:37:42] represents the word
[1:37:46] it has a measurement yes
[1:37:50] now the worshipers also
[1:37:54] should be measured what does that mean
[1:37:57] it means that God has a standard
[1:38:02] he has a standard of how he want the
[1:38:06] temple to be
[1:38:07] he gave Moses
[1:38:11] a precise measurement
[1:38:14] praise the Lord if he was when he was
[1:38:17] going to to to to to drown the word in
[1:38:19] the time of Noah
[1:38:21] when he called Noah and gave Noah a
[1:38:24] magic a message that message had a
[1:38:28] measurement
[1:38:30] of how the ACT should be the length of
[1:38:34] the eye the weight of the Ark
[1:38:37] praise the Lord
[1:38:39] amen
[1:38:42] it's not everything goes
[1:38:44] no God has a precise way that he want
[1:38:50] things and until things meet that
[1:38:53] measurement he cannot bless it
[1:38:58] praise the Lord
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:08] he gave us measurements
[1:39:12] our years upon the Earth our Heights and
[1:39:16] all of that he's a god of measurement
[1:39:21] there's a way that God wants things to
[1:39:24] be done
[1:39:25] there's a way he wants us to order our
[1:39:28] life
[1:39:29] the temple had a measurement
[1:39:34] he told Moses
[1:39:36] give him a vision
[1:39:38] for him to build the temple I call into
[1:39:40] the vision
[1:39:43] that he saw it in the mountain
[1:39:45] and when Moses came down he came with
[1:39:48] this pattern the temple had to be
[1:39:50] measured you you see that in the
[1:39:52] building of the temple uh qubit year you
[1:39:55] know and and this cubic year and this
[1:39:57] length Year God was very precise
[1:40:04] and God is very precise how he will get
[1:40:08] us in the rapture
[1:40:11] he's not going to take your measurement
[1:40:14] or how you want to get in the rapture
[1:40:18] praise the Lord
[1:40:21] amen
[1:40:24] God is very precise how we must run this
[1:40:28] church
[1:40:30] he's very precise if he's going to dwell
[1:40:33] in this place if he's going to bless
[1:40:35] what is done here it must be done by his
[1:40:38] measurement
[1:40:41] God is very precise how you must run
[1:40:43] your home yes
[1:40:48] praise the Lord
[1:41:01] Murder band says in a message spoken
[1:41:04] word is the Original Seed
[1:41:09] he said
[1:41:13] if you want a church
[1:41:16] start
[1:41:17] with the word
[1:41:20] praise the Lord
[1:41:22] don't stop with the people
[1:41:25] it's not the people that makes the
[1:41:27] church
[1:41:28] is the word that makes a church
[1:41:31] it's not the amount of people that miss
[1:41:33] the church
[1:41:35] if you want to start a church
[1:41:37] it's not how much instrument you have
[1:41:43] praise the Lord
[1:41:48] it's not it's not about the the the
[1:41:50] high-rise building you have
[1:41:54] you don't start by building the building
[1:41:56] a building
[1:42:00] you start with the word
[1:42:07] you'll wanna when join the Baptist
[1:42:09] started after stepping out of all of
[1:42:11] those years from the Wilderness his
[1:42:13] first message was repaint
[1:42:17] because that has been the the the
[1:42:20] groundwork to every Revival
[1:42:24] if we were if we would ever experience
[1:42:26] God in our life we must go back to the
[1:42:28] basic of repentance
[1:42:34] there's God's measuring Rock to turn
[1:42:37] people around
[1:42:41] if we will be if we would turn around
[1:42:43] and have any experience of turning
[1:42:46] around in our life the way God's
[1:42:48] measurement for that is repentance
[1:42:59] are we together
[1:43:03] if you want a church he said start with
[1:43:06] the word
[1:43:08] if you want a life of God
[1:43:12] start with the word
[1:43:19] if you want to experience God start with
[1:43:21] the word
[1:43:22] in the beginning was the word
[1:43:25] the word was with God
[1:43:28] when God wanted to start a creation he
[1:43:31] started with his word let there be
[1:43:36] it was the beginning of all things
[1:43:39] we cannot leave the principle of the
[1:43:42] word and expect to be blessed
[1:43:50] we can leave the principle of the word
[1:43:52] and expect to be blessed
[1:43:59] praise the Lord
[1:44:01] that he didn't make their gods
[1:44:05] and make the rules that govern their
[1:44:07] gods Our God make us
[1:44:12] and give us his root that govern our
[1:44:15] life
[1:44:21] praise the Lord
[1:44:23] amen if you have a god different from
[1:44:25] the one that we are serving here take
[1:44:27] him outside
[1:44:28] because there's no place for him here
[1:44:32] praise the Lord
[1:44:35] hear people when they want to be stuck
[1:44:37] in their ways and when they come to
[1:44:39] church to accept my God carry your God
[1:44:40] outside because the God Will Save here
[1:44:43] he's governed by this Bible
[1:44:45] he's not governed by your idea
[1:44:49] he's gone by this word
[1:45:00] if you want a livestock with the word
[1:45:04] accept the word of God in his fullness
[1:45:11] praise the Lord
[1:45:20] accept the word of God in his fullness
[1:45:25] every measure of it
[1:45:32] praise the Lord
[1:45:36] God has a measurement
[1:45:39] even the Bible it talks about our faith
[1:45:42] there's a Measure of Faith
[1:45:46] that is given to us
[1:45:49] there is a measure of Grace that is
[1:45:52] given to our dispensation
[1:45:57] praise the Lord
[1:46:01] when the people in the days of Noah
[1:46:04] choose to go after their own hearts and
[1:46:06] get get themselves into everything that
[1:46:09] God himself involved they stretch out
[1:46:11] God's grace
[1:46:14] to that ancient time and the spirit of
[1:46:16] God with no no longer strive with man
[1:46:26] whatever
[1:46:28] we want to start
[1:46:30] it must be with the word
[1:46:33] we must start with the word
[1:46:37] amen
[1:46:38] amen you cannot you cannot despise God's
[1:46:42] word
[1:46:44] you can now Trump God's word under your
[1:46:47] feet
[1:46:48] especially when God has opened his word
[1:46:51] to you and Truth has been revealed to
[1:46:54] you and the spirit of God is dealing
[1:46:56] with your heart
[1:46:58] praise the Lord
[1:47:00] amen all you are doing is that you're
[1:47:03] using your teeth to dig your grave
[1:47:07] that's a hard way to do it
[1:47:11] that's a very hard way to do it
[1:47:18] start with the word
[1:47:21] accept the word in his fullness
[1:47:24] every measure of it
[1:47:26] and if that is the fullness of God in
[1:47:30] you
[1:47:31] then the rain that's falling will
[1:47:35] produce exactly
[1:47:37] what's in your garden
[1:47:41] is just like uh the the the the our
[1:47:45] floored
[1:47:46] that was the reason why those things I
[1:47:48] place precisely there in the scripture
[1:47:53] when the angel brought Ezekiel
[1:47:56] the effect of the of the of of that
[1:47:59] stage of water was just to his angle
[1:48:02] praise the Lord when the angel took him
[1:48:05] into another level he fed the water up
[1:48:08] to his to his knees
[1:48:11] there was the measurement for that age
[1:48:15] praise the Lord
[1:48:17] when the angel took him father he fed
[1:48:19] the water around his waist and his lions
[1:48:25] praise the Lord
[1:48:32] so to everything
[1:48:35] to everything God set out
[1:48:39] a measurement a road how he's going to
[1:48:42] do it
[1:48:44] when Noah
[1:48:46] follow
[1:48:48] the measurement of God
[1:48:50] when he followed
[1:48:52] the measurement of God he followed God's
[1:48:55] instruction
[1:48:56] how the ACT should be built
[1:49:00] because he followed that instruction
[1:49:04] it created an atmosphere
[1:49:08] praise the Lord
[1:49:10] now all these why animals of different
[1:49:13] nature
[1:49:15] who come on there endure together Happy
[1:49:18] Lane
[1:49:23] praise the Lord
[1:49:27] they could come honor that
[1:49:29] because it was built on the God's
[1:49:33] instruction
[1:49:36] he follows God's measurement
[1:49:42] praise the Lord
[1:49:45] are we together
[1:49:50] Moses did the same
[1:49:55] he did the same when he instructed the
[1:49:57] people to build a tabernacle
[1:49:59] in the wilderness
[1:50:04] praise the Lord
[1:50:05] now you see because Moses gave them the
[1:50:08] instruction that God gave him and the
[1:50:11] god the precise measurement even though
[1:50:14] it was a tabernacle they could erect
[1:50:17] they could bring it down and they can
[1:50:18] carry it and then and then put it back
[1:50:20] up you know uh it was not difficult to
[1:50:23] do
[1:50:26] because because all the Levi's that were
[1:50:30] in the Tabernacle
[1:50:32] all the Levites that were in the
[1:50:34] Tabernacle beside the the Aaron and his
[1:50:37] sons that were going into the holy place
[1:50:40] all of those Levi's had a work to do
[1:50:44] those three tribes of Levi's
[1:50:47] there was one that was their job was to
[1:50:51] take down
[1:50:52] the other ones their job was to
[1:50:54] transport
[1:50:57] and the other Levi's their job was to
[1:51:00] take care of things arrange things in
[1:51:02] the Tabernacle what is that that is also
[1:51:06] measurement
[1:51:09] it's measurement in the state they all
[1:51:11] have their work to do
[1:51:17] they're all everybody in their place
[1:51:24] the Lord
[1:51:26] and because that measurement that other
[1:51:30] was followed every time the Tabernacle
[1:51:33] was set up they got the blessing
[1:51:37] the presence of God would come down and
[1:51:39] worth it
[1:51:43] praise the Lord
[1:51:47] do you think about it
[1:51:49] yes God asked him right here that the
[1:51:52] temple should be measured
[1:51:55] the word should be measured that's a
[1:51:58] word for the people in this age there's
[1:52:02] a word for the people that are going
[1:52:04] into that Temple
[1:52:06] and the worshipers
[1:52:08] must also be measured
[1:52:14] praise the Lord
[1:52:18] the worshipers must also be measured
[1:52:21] so there is a word that tells us how you
[1:52:25] know how we dress how we get ourselves
[1:52:27] together how we get our life together we
[1:52:29] get our family together how The Church
[1:52:31] Must Be run
[1:52:33] the church is never run on on people's
[1:52:36] opinion
[1:52:37] right
[1:52:44] praise the Lord
[1:52:49] if we'll be able to experience God in a
[1:52:52] way that he wants us to experience him
[1:52:56] we must measure up to God's word measure
[1:52:59] up to God's standard brother William use
[1:53:01] that yet he said he said God has a
[1:53:04] program and we must measure up to that
[1:53:07] program
[1:53:09] we must measure up
[1:53:11] to God's program
[1:53:14] praise the Lord
[1:53:20] you'll realize that uh uh every every
[1:53:24] idolatry every other form of worship
[1:53:28] that man has created throughout the
[1:53:31] throughout the ages they don't want to
[1:53:34] worship the almighty God but yet they
[1:53:37] take things from the holy God worship
[1:53:40] and strive to the idols
[1:53:43] that's right
[1:53:45] amen they don't want to worship the
[1:53:48] almighty God they don't want to worship
[1:53:50] the god of holiness
[1:53:54] praise the Lord
[1:53:55] but they love his music
[1:54:00] amen
[1:54:02] praise the Lord every form of idol
[1:54:05] worship you see because worship actually
[1:54:07] came from God he's the object of worship
[1:54:12] praise the Lord
[1:54:15] he was the first one that created Bane
[1:54:17] to worship Him
[1:54:19] when he made the angels
[1:54:25] so every form of worship you have
[1:54:28] every form of worship even the people
[1:54:31] that are in the Dark World you know they
[1:54:34] they say a strap reference
[1:54:38] Jesus said when you pray say Our Father
[1:54:41] Who Art in Heaven worship him they are
[1:54:43] reverence him
[1:54:45] praise the Lord
[1:54:49] the people in the dark world and and
[1:54:51] devilish worship they're also as tribe
[1:54:54] reverence and they are only making so so
[1:54:56] heavy on your head
[1:55:00] praise the Lord You Gotta Give it
[1:55:04] amen you got to give it
[1:55:09] praise the Lord
[1:55:11] think about this
[1:55:16] when you choose to go into
[1:55:20] the military
[1:55:23] and to go and save the country
[1:55:25] when you get there the first thing to do
[1:55:27] is that
[1:55:30] they change your identity

[1:55:35] shop
[1:55:36] and cut your head
[1:55:38] they gave they make every one of your
[1:55:39] look like brothers
[1:55:44] praise the Lord
[1:55:45] amen
[1:55:47] in as much as
[1:55:52] it looks cool they are sending a message
[1:55:54] to you
[1:55:57] as you come through those Gates we tell
[1:56:00] you how you dress
[1:56:04] we tell you how you dress the way you
[1:56:06] were brought up to dress you don't dress
[1:56:08] like that yeah right
[1:56:10] it's a simple message they are telling
[1:56:12] you
[1:56:13] we will give you the clothes that you
[1:56:15] were wearing
[1:56:17] praise the Lord
[1:56:18] we we will supply the clothes that you
[1:56:20] would wear we would dress you
[1:56:24] I mean
[1:56:28] they caught your head it asks you to
[1:56:30] look in the mirror how does it look
[1:56:33] you like it

[1:56:38] push-ups
[1:56:43] praise the Lord
[1:56:45] amen
[1:56:51] and you see
[1:56:54] God standard
[1:56:56] is the highest tender
[1:56:59] the highest tender his Tender Is even
[1:57:02] above the military standard
[1:57:06] but you see that that just shows how sin
[1:57:10] has made us slave
[1:57:14] that until we get the whip to our back
[1:57:16] we will not do what we know that is
[1:57:19] right to do
[1:57:23] until we get a whip to our back
[1:57:26] we would dress anyhow
[1:57:31] copy after the word
[1:57:34] calling ourselves Christian we treat
[1:57:36] ourselves anyhow we are honor Grace
[1:57:40] praise the Lord now you see it and
[1:57:43] that's the reason why it now shows that
[1:57:46] uh the way that God deals with us he's
[1:57:50] now having a whip on our back
[1:57:53] praise the Lord
[1:57:55] amen
[1:57:57] he's not having a whip on our back but
[1:58:00] what he's doing is that he's dealing
[1:58:02] with our heart and the way that he deals
[1:58:05] with your heart it reflects on your
[1:58:07] outside
[1:58:10] the way God deals with your heart
[1:58:13] why are you dress decent
[1:58:17] why you make yourself to look like a
[1:58:19] gentleman that must be respected it's
[1:58:21] because God is dealing with your heart
[1:58:23] if God is not dealing with you how you
[1:58:26] will feel you will feed after the
[1:58:27] culture right
[1:58:30] praise the Lord you want to grow your
[1:58:32] hair crazy go ahead grow like crazy
[1:58:37] I'm not going to open a barber shop for
[1:58:39] you
[1:58:46] praise the Lord
[1:58:48] but God has a measurement he has a
[1:58:50] standard
[1:58:57] how are we going to get I mean are we
[1:58:59] we're talking about a time and I mean
[1:59:01] see see all of those young people
[1:59:04] they are in their own word it's what
[1:59:07] they know
[1:59:14] but with the grace and the measure that
[1:59:17] is given to them if God can be dealing
[1:59:19] with them how much about you and myself
[1:59:22] that are sitting under the Revere word
[1:59:24] of the hour

[1:59:30] measuring Angel comes down every day as
[1:59:33] you open the word
[1:59:36] he want to take us from one level to
[1:59:39] another
[1:59:41] but we are so filled with our own ideas
[1:59:49] God has a program and we must measure up
[1:59:52] to that program
[1:59:55] we try to teach our ministers knowledge
[1:59:59] we ought to teach them
[2:00:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[2:00:44] than the born-again Christian
[2:00:47] as the holy ghost that make us better
[2:00:50] it's not the clothes that we wear that
[2:00:52] make us better
[2:00:53] or while we think about ourselves
[2:00:56] is what God is doing in our lives that
[2:00:59] make us better

[2:03:26] confessing their sin and wanting God to
[2:03:29] change their life Why Can't We Gather on
[2:03:31] our knees and say God do something for
[2:03:33] those young people foreign
[2:03:55] chapter 2 verse 8.
[2:03:59] I would therefore thy man pray every
[2:04:02] word lifting up holy hands with our
[2:04:04] wrath and doubting now and if you if you
[2:04:07] look at this if you look at this this is
[2:04:09] this is very beautiful I hope that the
[2:04:11] Lord can help me to bring out in a way
[2:04:13] that I that uh that he did with me on it
[2:04:18] I will therefore that men pray
[2:04:20] everywhere now that word man is is is
[2:04:24] used in the scripture for the human race
[2:04:29] amen
[2:04:31] there are places in the scripture where
[2:04:33] is used for the him for human rights but
[2:04:36] if you narrow the thought down in the
[2:04:38] way that God deals with us
[2:04:43] okay in a way that God's deals with or
[2:04:46] let's read another scripture then you
[2:04:47] will be able to appreciate uh First
[2:04:50] Timothy chapter one
[2:04:53] no not first Timothy I said First Peter
[2:04:55] chapter 3.
[2:04:59] First Peter chapter three you see you
[2:05:01] you realize that I'm nervous because I
[2:05:03] want to let you go now
[2:05:06] but I just want to give you something so
[2:05:08] you think about before you leave from
[2:05:10] here first Timothy 3 verse 1 the Bible
[2:05:12] says likewise hear why be be so be in
[2:05:16] suggestion to your own husband that
[2:05:19] if anyone obeyed not the word
[2:05:23] they also May without the word be warned
[2:05:28] by the conversation of their wife now
[2:05:31] you have found that
[2:05:36] a woman also can be worn by the
[2:05:40] composition of her husband
[2:05:42] but the Holy Spirit
[2:05:44] intentionally
[2:05:47] place it like this men pray everywhere
[2:05:51] woman
[2:05:53] because the way that she's made
[2:05:58] the way she's made
[2:06:00] amen
[2:06:02] we we have been taught by the prophet
[2:06:04] that God gave us those three sacrificial
[2:06:07] for Redemption
[2:06:09] amen there is something that is placed
[2:06:11] in her life just like we always says you
[2:06:14] know uh uh I mean uh when when a woman
[2:06:17] dressed decent I mean uh uh everybody
[2:06:20] will associate her to be a kind of a
[2:06:22] holy ghost woman
[2:06:24] there were no stray that she said holy
[2:06:25] ghost woman why because she's made that
[2:06:28] way
[2:06:29] amen if I dress decent and wear my suit
[2:06:33] am I just think I'm a banger
[2:06:36] praise the Lord that's the first thing
[2:06:38] that might think I'm working at the bank
[2:06:39] or some kind of a CEO you know that's
[2:06:42] that's what I would think
[2:06:44] praise the Lord now so you see God
[2:06:47] in a way that he made us there is there
[2:06:50] is also a way that uh uh uh uh a design
[2:06:55] that he placed in the scripture
[2:07:00] praise the Lord
[2:07:02] there's a design in a way that he placed
[2:07:04] it in the scripture now it's true that
[2:07:07] men pray every word means the human race
[2:07:09] every one of us we must pray everywhere
[2:07:11] lifting up our holy hands but if you
[2:07:13] narrow it down to the man you will
[2:07:17] realize that uh in a way that the woman
[2:07:20] is made in the way she's made science
[2:07:23] proved that she she multitasks more than
[2:07:26] the man Amen in a way that she's made
[2:07:29] God gave her a womb God placed something
[2:07:32] under her heart
[2:07:36] amen and because of her design
[2:07:41] she's she can she can she can pray more
[2:07:45] than a man can let me let me say it that
[2:07:47] way
[2:07:50] because it's not the worst it's the
[2:07:52] heart
[2:07:54] the way she's conditioned
[2:07:57] she can carry things
[2:08:00] praise the Lord
[2:08:03] she can carry things so in my mind I'm
[2:08:05] sitting down there as God is dealing
[2:08:07] with me and I'm I'm saying that uh uh
[2:08:09] you know Apostle Paul is worrying more
[2:08:12] about the men
[2:08:13] because what their brother Branham says
[2:08:15] he says he says man it's not the muscle
[2:08:17] he says it's the whole that you have in
[2:08:20] your pains from kneading on your knees
[2:08:25] he says that's what a man is
[2:08:29] praise the Lord
[2:08:31] and you just look at the church look at
[2:08:33] the laodisha church this church is led
[2:08:36] by women
[2:08:37] go in the churches
[2:08:40] you will find out that the women are
[2:08:43] more than the men
[2:08:47] and that also
[2:08:50] has destroyed our society
[2:08:54] because man has left his place of of
[2:08:58] leading his home
[2:09:01] praise the Lord
[2:09:02] we want to lead our home with our
[2:09:04] muscles and our money and the place that
[2:09:06] a man must lead his womb is on his knees
[2:09:10] let's man prayed everywhere
[2:09:17] praise the Lord
[2:09:20] now you you will understand that I have
[2:09:23] a message where I I mean kind of for
[2:09:25] setting on on uh Elijah the woman hit
[2:09:27] her I'll bring that to you
[2:09:30] and uh and and then and then when you
[2:09:32] come over to the place of the woman also
[2:09:34] you will realize because of the way that
[2:09:37] she's designed
[2:09:39] amen
[2:09:41] age she takes her place
[2:09:44] like we said her virtue is her power yes
[2:09:50] so what Peter is dealing with here is
[2:09:53] that uh if a woman can rightly take her
[2:09:56] place
[2:09:57] or attitude can change the atmosphere of
[2:10:01] the home her attitude can change the man
[2:10:05] that word conversation means her
[2:10:07] behavior
[2:10:09] she's designed for that
[2:10:12] amen
[2:10:14] she's designed
[2:10:17] so you see how the scripture is placing
[2:10:20] these two roles
[2:10:24] that's the way that God built it
[2:10:27] that's the way he designed it
[2:10:34] are we together
[2:10:46] she's made that way
[2:10:50] she can carry things on her heart you
[2:10:52] know like brother Brandon Chase I'm
[2:10:53] using that you know he says the
[2:10:55] scripture says my hearts are failing for
[2:10:57] fear but he says the Bible didn't say
[2:11:00] women heart he says if you look at the
[2:11:02] racial men there are more from heart
[2:11:04] attack than women
[2:11:06] it all comes back to that it's not that
[2:11:09] women are has another feeling for fear
[2:11:11] but the Bible the Bible intentionally
[2:11:15] sometimes they say those things to grab
[2:11:17] your mind what the Bible address this
[2:11:20] like this
[2:11:22] there's a key in it
[2:11:25] praise the Lord
[2:11:28] there's a key in it if you can grab the
[2:11:31] key you get the blessing
[2:11:33] you can open the treasure
[2:11:45] God has a program
[2:11:48] and we must measure up to death
[2:11:51] praise the Lord
[2:11:52] there's a way he want his church to be
[2:11:55] and we must measure up to it
[2:11:58] there's a way that he won our home to be
[2:12:05] This Promise is unto you
[2:12:07] and to your children
[2:12:09] and to as many as the Lord Our God shall
[2:12:12] call
[2:12:15] and until we measure up
[2:12:18] until we meet the measuring angel
[2:12:23] which is the mighty angel
[2:12:26] which is the Holy Ghost
[2:12:28] the measuring Angel is the Holy Ghost
[2:12:35] praise the Lord
[2:12:42] the temple is measured even even
[2:12:45] even the new city the gates are measure
[2:12:50] the walls I measure
[2:12:52] the city is measured
[2:12:56] that's what Revelation 21 says
[2:12:58] so God is a god of measurement
[2:13:03] praise the Lord
[2:13:05] he's a god of measurement
[2:13:08] there's a period of time
[2:13:10] what he wants to deal with you
[2:13:13] he wants to ship your life
[2:13:16] praise the Lord
[2:13:18] amen
[2:13:18] he will always be your God if you miss
[2:13:22] that period of time you are just going
[2:13:24] to struggle
[2:13:28] you are just going to struggle
[2:13:31] praise the Lord I mean there are people
[2:13:33] word I mean they will never be able to
[2:13:35] sit under any Ministry
[2:13:43] they will never be able to sit under any
[2:13:45] hair shape
[2:13:47] praise the Lord because either they are
[2:13:50] too short or they are too long
[2:13:55] the ministry can never meet them or they
[2:13:57] know too much
[2:14:02] or they know too much
[2:14:09] praise the Lord
[2:14:13] there's a time there's a time appointed
[2:14:16] when you look at even appointed time is
[2:14:18] a measurement
[2:14:20] because over in the Old Testament it was
[2:14:22] seven years
[2:14:24] they don't go over seven years God gave
[2:14:26] a definite time to be a time a time
[2:14:29] appointed
[2:14:31] he gave a definite time for it for it to
[2:14:33] be a time of restitution
[2:14:36] there was a definite time that Jubilee
[2:14:37] time that a person could go free
[2:14:42] now if you refuse to go free
[2:14:45] then you are brought to the post offer
[2:14:48] of the house and you are stamped which
[2:14:51] means you always belong to this house
[2:14:58] there was a time
[2:15:01] praise the Lord
[2:15:06] and the scripture was said today
[2:15:09] is the day of visitation
[2:15:13] the day that God is dealing with your
[2:15:15] heart
[2:15:16] don't put it away
[2:15:19] amen yeah
[2:15:21] there are times to fix things
[2:15:24] if you don't get it fixed in that time
[2:15:26] and that time pass you will not
[2:15:30] praise the Lord
[2:15:32] amen I mean even when you when you when
[2:15:35] you see how God deals with with you
[2:15:37] sometimes even even as a preacher
[2:15:40] there's a time where you have a burden
[2:15:44] because it's the burden is the anointing
[2:15:46] that makes you to do several things
[2:15:49] you just don't do it because you want uh
[2:15:52] you know uh you just wanna a kind of for
[2:15:56] routine no
[2:15:58] is the burden when when that anointing
[2:16:01] leaves you there is nothing you can do
[2:16:03] there is nothing you can do
[2:16:09] there is nothing you can do sometimes
[2:16:10] you have the burden to to be able to
[2:16:12] help you know a situation or help
[2:16:16] somebody and you're putting all that
[2:16:18] time there and it comes you see the very
[2:16:20] same person you just don't have it
[2:16:21] because it's not a mental workup
[2:16:25] is something that God burning you to do
[2:16:30] so there's a measurement there's a limit
[2:16:32] to that
[2:16:33] that's what time is
[2:16:36] everything in time has measurement
[2:16:39] the days have 24 hours the months have a
[2:16:43] time it begins it has a time it ends
[2:16:46] to every measurement it has a beginning
[2:16:48] it has an end that's what time brings us
[2:16:54] that's what time brings us
[2:17:02] there's a time where God wants you to
[2:17:05] experience more of him
[2:17:08] he want to pull you to himself
[2:17:15] I can show you another another scripture
[2:17:17] but I would just take me all the time
[2:17:19] Paul right there in Corinthians
[2:17:23] he says like this he says uh uh uh uh
[2:17:26] you know uh what if if a man is not
[2:17:29] married he having all of this time for
[2:17:31] the Lord
[2:17:33] okay
[2:17:36] praise the Lord that that's a
[2:17:38] measurement
[2:17:39] it does not means that uh you know uh
[2:17:43] you can save God better when you're not
[2:17:45] married than when you are married no
[2:17:47] that's not what it means
[2:17:49] many people think like that but that's
[2:17:51] not what it means
[2:17:55] what it means is is more in a place that
[2:17:58] now you have this period of time where
[2:18:01] you can be able to season your life
[2:18:03] where you can be able to get in the
[2:18:06] things of God because now when you get
[2:18:09] married you will now be serving God
[2:18:11] through or with another person
[2:18:17] praise the Lord you will now be saving
[2:18:20] god with another person it will not just
[2:18:23] be you you will be able to bring this
[2:18:25] place that's why the man must not extend
[2:18:27] he said he must let his wife know before
[2:18:29] he keep himself to himself because if
[2:18:32] you are not single anymore you are too
[2:18:35] so why you have this time to be single
[2:18:38] young people
[2:18:39] put yourself in the face of God build a
[2:18:42] prayer life
[2:18:44] that when you get married it will be
[2:18:46] part of you yeah
[2:18:50] it will be part of you
[2:18:57] because if you don't get it done now
[2:19:00] praise the Lord
[2:19:02] if you don't get it done now
[2:19:05] it's not when you you have a home you
[2:19:07] have to work you have children and
[2:19:09] everything you you never cultivated that
[2:19:11] in your life
[2:19:14] it will be a struggle
[2:19:20] it will be a struggle
[2:19:25] so to everything to everything there is
[2:19:28] a measurement
[2:19:31] musicians you can come
[2:19:35] if the lord gave us the grace we'll
