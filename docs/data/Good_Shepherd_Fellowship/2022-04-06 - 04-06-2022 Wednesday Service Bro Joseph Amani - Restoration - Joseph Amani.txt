========================================

[Music] [Music] it will change the way you think about the world you live in and the world beyond [Music] chapter 1 mysterious birth sign covering the years 1909 to 1912. 15 is not too young to have a baby muttered ella branham to herself trying to bolster her courage why i'm just as ready as the pain struck again stronger more commanding than before ella felt her panic rise with a spreading discomfort she held her swollen stomach and groaned not yet please not yet not until charles comes home beads of sweat popped out in her forehead she staggered across the dirt floor to the cabin's only window set in the middle of a crude wooden door the window had no glass only a wooden shutter which ella left open during the day and closed at night now it was open charles she screamed her voice seemed to evaporate into the kentucky back woods with his vast expanse of hills and hollows stretching out from her in every direction knowing her nearest neighbor lived miles away made ella feel desperately alone the pain tightened around her stomach driving her into a panic charles she screamed again charles where are you then her voice sank into a feeble sob please come home i need you charles branham had received his logging pay that morning and had walked into berksville kentucky to buy a new pair of bib overalls in honor of my first child he said but what was keeping him so long had he gotten waylaid by a tavern if so it would not have been the first time in their one-year marriage but surely charles wouldn't do such a thing today he knew their baby was due anytime the contraction subsided leaving her spent ella sagged against the splintery door jam watching the sun settle behind the maples and oaks that had just begun to bud it was april in the year 1909 ella shivered as she closed the shutter now the only light in the cabin came from the sunset filtering through the chinks between the roughly squared logs pencil beams of light move slowly across the table a homemade affair built from a sawed-off tree stump with wooden pegs for legs and a bench for a seat the only other piece of furniture in the single 12 foot long room was a primitive bed nailed to one wall ellis staggered to the bed and collapsed on its straw tick pulling the quilt up to her chin the corn chuck pillow crackled under her head with every move as the room darkened to black ella thought about her former home in paris texas which she had so recently wanted to escape last year it had seemed intolerable but now from this position it did not seem so bad she had grown up in texas as ella harvey her father was a hunter trapper and school teacher her mother was a full-blooded cherokee indian ella the oldest of four children had lived a wonderful carefree childhood until three years ago when her mother died from scarlet fever at that time ella was barely 12 years old and her youngest brother was only four the chore of mothering fell heavily into ella's lap a little over a year ago she'd met charles branham at a rodeo charles was short and handsome with curly black hair broad shoulders and enough cowboy skills to defeat almost every bucking bronco that he challenged ella was smitten by his charm charles was 18 and she was 14 but she felt years older at that time marriage had seemed like a good way to avoid the drudgery of caring for her younger siblings now she wondered if she had merely jumped from one hot frying pan into another here she was 15 years old a stranger in the kentucky hills having a baby 40 miles from the nearest doctor with not even a friend to call on for help burying her head in her pillow ella wept charles branham returned to the cabin an hour after dark he had been drinking of course but not enough to dull his thinking he inched the door open quietly so that he wouldn't disturb his young wife if she were asleep then he heard her moan charles quickly lit a pine knot and set it on the lid of a fruit jar the pine knot burned with a dim sputtering light that gave off volumes of smoke because the cabin was naturally ventilated the smoke drifted up past the rafters sifting out through the cracks in the clapboard shingles overhead charles ella whispered weakly tonight's the night go fetch your mama charles built a fire then he hurried to his mother's cabin the night was cold and clear and the starlight made it easy to keep on the path an hour later he returned with his mother and two neighbor women grandma branham was a crusty old woman tough as bacon rind but seeing this little 15 year old girl in labor softened her like hot grease softens boot leather not that grandma branham ever used boots herself she'd never owned a pair of shoes in her life now she took charge of the situation having had 17 children of her own she was well prepared to act as midwife for her new daughter-in-law she insisted that charles wait outside he did not argue taking a blanket he crawled under the lean-to tacked onto one end of the cabin making his bed on the wood chips and bark pulling a flask of whiskey out of his pocket charles polished it off to calm his nerves before long he fell sound asleep as dawn approached the commotion inside the cabin grew more intense charles roused the eastern horizon was turning lighter with the approach of dawn but the sun had not yet risen he cursed himself for having dozed and then started to worry because his baby had not yet been born was something wrong maybe he should go inside and check before he could make up his mind he heard the high pitched squall of a newborn the cabin door flew open and one of the neighbor women called charles branham it's a boy sheepishly charles shuffled inside and closed the door the room smelled of smoke from a greased candle on the table grandma branham finished washing the infant weighed him at five pounds then gently laid him in his mother's arms charles stood near the bed with his hands tucked into the bib of his new overalls nervously watching this wiggling grunting little creature that was his son ella said charles he's got your blue eyes charles studied the small eyes but in the dim light he couldn't tell their color we'll call his first name william he said and his middle name will be marion ella tested the name with her tongue william miriam branham it sounded distinguished enough and he can go by the name of billy charles i think billy's going to have your curly hair too open the shutter so i can see him better it was shortly after five o'clock tuesday morning april 6 1909 daylight filtered in through the chinks even though the sun had not yet topped the horizon charles opened the shutter then drew back startled something had darted through the open window a light like a star about a foot in diameter ellis screamed and cradled her son tightly to her bosom the others bewildered step back against the wall the strange light circled the room several times then stopped over the bed hovering above the new mother and the child glowing yellowish green pulsating with a life of its own for less than a minute it held that position not long yet long enough for everyone in the cabin to be sure they had really seen it then as quickly as it had come in the fireball left whirling up past the rafters and out through the roof charles stared up at the clapboard shingles with wide unblinking eyes suddenly a flurry of wings turned his attention towards the door where a dub had landed on the sill of the open window the snow white dove eye the room with curiosity almost as if looking for something when it spotted the newborn baby it cocked its head and cooed before it flew away charles gazed after the bird for a moment then rolled his eyes back up towards the roof one of the neighbor women muttered well i never the other mused i wonder what kind of youngin this boy will be billy branham was only 15 minutes old born yonder on the hill with a light over him some passed it off as sunlight reflecting from a mirror ella and charles knew better since there were no mirrors in their cabin besides the sun had not yet come up they were puzzled was there some spiritual meaning in the light charles wanted to forget it but ella wouldn't let him she insisted that something must be done and finally decided that their baby should be taken to a church and dedicated to god at first charles argued against this idea but finally he consented although the concession raked against the grain of his character now the question came up where should they take him the ancestry of charles branham was strictly irish catholic on ella's side the harveys were irish catholic too except for ella's mother who belonged to the cherokee nation however both charles and ella had drifted completely away from their catholic foundation and neither of them had any formal religious convictions they agreed that for their purpose the best church was the nearest church so when billy branham was two weeks old charles and ella bundled him up and took him down to the opossum kingdom baptist church where a small congregation met each sunday in a rustic log building with a dirt floor and pews made from boards lying across upturned blocks of wood the opossum kingdom baptist church had no regular pastor on most sundays the congregation sang songs and read from the bible but every two months a circuit preacher came through and delivered a sermon the old preacher was there today he offered prayer over little william mariam branham asking god to someday use this boy in his service it was the last time billy branham would enter a church building for 23 years locking often forced charles to be away from his wife and son during the week that october in 1909 a blizzard stranded him in a lumber camp far from home ella four months pregnant with their second child worried as her supplies dwindled when her firewood ran out she wrapped her feet in burlap bags and struggled through the waist high drifts and biting wind fighting her way into the woods to chop down saplings and dead branches dragging them back into the cabin in a desperate attempt to keep her fire going but winter food gave out she despaired fire cooled to ashes ella was too weak to make another trip outside for wood gathering every scrap of clothing in the cabin she wrapped herself and her son as best she could crawled into bed and pulled the quilt over them outside the wind howled unceasingly the room chilled until her water bucket froze ella stared up into the rafters and considered again that strange light at her son's birth she had thought of it often over the past six months sometimes she believed it was a sign that billy was destined for greatness now it seemed meaningless since death for both of them could not be far away her nearest neighbor was an old man who lived across the valley when the storm blew out this neighbor stepped outside to do some chores he could just see the top of the branham cabin and he noticed there was no smoke rising from the chimney at the time he didn't give it much thought but after several days he grew concerned he knew smoke had been coming from the cabin before the storm and no one could have left the cabin during the storm figuring something might be wrong he decided to investigate as he approached the cabin he saw there were no tracks in the new fallen snow that confirmed his fear that no one had left the cabin after the storm ended he knocked but got no reply when he tried the door he found it was locked from the inside now he knew someone was in there someone who must be in serious trouble or they would have answered him with a great effort he managed to force open the door what he found inside made him shudder and her baby were huddled on the bed almost dead from cold and starvation hurriedly the neighbor grabbed ella's axe and went into the woods bringing back enough fuel to warm the cabin finding no food he trudged home and returned with as many groceries as he could carry calling a doctor was out of the question so the old man took care of the young mother and child himself by the time charles broke through the drift to his cabin his wife and son were starting to recover their strength the rest of that winter charles stayed close to home hunting and trapping to keep the larder filled in the spring he went back to logging after the ice thought he would hitch up an ox to the logs and one by one drag them down to the cumberland river where other loggers would lash them together into a raft float them down to the ohio river and then on to the mississippi in march of 1910 charles and ella had their second child edward a few months later now 16 felt another baby growing in her womb she bore her third child early in 1911. it was another boy she named him henry charles logged through the sprig in summer into the fall of 1911. misfortune struck again ripping charles from his young family and almost destroying him as the youngest of 17 children charles brown had grown up with many rough teachers he learned to hold his whiskey when he was just a boy and he learned to settle disputes with his fists in the fall of 1911 charles was at a party when a fight broke out moonshine and hardened men made a wicked mix and soon the fight grew into a ferocious brawl involving everyone in the room one powerful bully named willie yarburl knocked a friend of charles to the floor jumped on him and drew his knife and was about to plunge it into his heart when charles brought his chair down on willy's head charles backed away and drew his own blade willie forgot the man on the floor and went after charles willywood would have slit charles throat if he had gotten a chance he was a merciless man who had killed his own son with a fence rail but charles knife found its mark first leaving willy in a pool of blood senseless though still alive news of this brawl reached berksville kentucky charles was implicated as a ringleader and charged with attempted murder a sheriff rode up on horseback to arrest him before the sheriff could find him charles caught wind of his danger he had to leave in a hurry not knowing where he would go or what he would do before he left he promised ella that as soon as he found work and a place for them to live he would send for her using an assumed name so he could not be traced and so in the space of an afternoon charles branham vanished leaving his wife alone in the woods to fend for herself and their three babies billy was two and a half edward was one and a half and henry was barely six months old at 17 ella was almost a child herself before a few weeks had passed she realized charles had left a part of himself with her she was pregnant again had fallen winter stretched ella to the limit of her strength she seemed to be living through a nightmare trying to care for three babies in a rude isolated cabin while she herself felt nauseated much of the time she had no money no resources and no energy if it had not been for the help of charles relatives poor as they were ella knew she would not have survived but finally the seasons changed the ground flawed and her nausea ended henry passed his first birthday edward his second and billy his third the baby kicking and twisting in ella's womb was getting near delivery once during that spring of 1912 a sheriff stopped by the cabin asked if ella had heard from her husband she could tell the truth she had not heard from him and had no idea where he was a few days after the sheriff's visit billy and edward were playing outside the cabin where a small spring kept the ground muddy billy wanted to show his younger brother how strong he was so he picked up the biggest rock he could lift held it over his head and threw it towards the spring the rock sank deep into the muck by the water's edge splattering mud all over edward who promptly cried and waddled back to the cabin a robin began to chirp with gusto billy searched the branches until he spied the bird in a nearby tree he took one step toward it and the robin flew away at that moment something so startling happened that it would brand itself to his tender mind it'd become his first significant childhood memory from where the robin had been perched there came a sound like wind rustling the leaves then a voice boomed from the tree a very clear human voice which said you will live near a city called new albany with a shriek of terror billy took off for the cabin as fast as his stubby legs could take him squealing mama mama ella was wiping mud from edward's tummy billy what happened she asked as she hugged her oldest son to her side a bird talked to me mama i heard him singing in the tree then he talked to me ella laughed you were dreaming child but billy insisted i heard him mama i heard him talk and what did the bird say ella tease still thinking it was billy's imagination he said we would live near a city called new albany this reply startled her it did not seem like something a small boy would make up in his play she stepped around behind the cabin and called into the woods hello anybody there when she came back inside billy asked mama where is new albany it's a town in indiana just across the river from louisville kentucky about a hundred miles from here billy where did you hear talk of new albany i ain't never heard of new albany mama until that bird talked to me mama when are we going to live there will papa live there with us ella shook her head several weeks later a long-awaited letter from charles arrived ella sat at the stump table staring at the envelope she held between her trembling fingers billy stood in his tiptoes peeking over the table top open it mama ella giggled nervously of course we've waited a long time for this why wait any longer carefully she undid the glued flap removed the letter from its envelope opened it and began to read since her father was a school teacher she had received a fair education but charles had almost no schooling and could neither read nor write not even his own name one of his brothers living in louisville had written this letter for him what does it say mama billy asked she talked as she read it says that your papa is in indiana he's found steady work and a place for us to live and he wants us to come right away it's in a little town called utica about 10 miles northeast of she stopped abruptly and looked with amazement at her three-year-old son how could it be where mama where is utica billy persisted ella said slowly billy we're going to live 10 miles northeast of new albany indiana [Music] yes [Music] i see the stars [Music] displays [Music] your god today how great thou art [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i wonder when i look down

shall deceive the very elect amen amen all right we're gonna jump back in genesis chapter 3 and i'm gonna read chapter three say this now the serpent was more subtle done any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman ye hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said into the serpent we may eat of the tree of the fruit of the trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is the mist of the garden god hath said you shall not eat for it neither shall not touch it least ye die amen amen let's pray lord jesus christ we say thank you again for this moment god may you come again god and teach us by yourself god we surrender our souls we surrender everything in your hand god may you come and take over this pope god god i don't i don't want to be here god but i want you to be here in my place god may you speak to your people yourself when you say amen to your own word god we say thank you for everything god made those who came here seeking anything god may you be the resolution for anything for them god and we surrender everything in the mighty name of jesus christ we pray amen all right let me see that again so tonight i have just a little uh is this this message brother branham preached this message in 1965 it's called satan's eden amen amen satan's eden and we know that god himself created the garden of ed uh the garden of eden himself created but why president branham called this message the satan's eden it's very interesting preaching that when i was starting this and i said god i want to understand why brother branham called this a satan's eden what was behind this it turns out that eden is the form of church amen amen because from the beginning brother god wanted to establish the relationship between him a human being that was the purpose to create the garden that's it nothing else just to have the relationship and president branham went far and said every day god came and visited adam and eve in the evening time which was a type of our age we are living in morning they woke up maybe they used to shower and take breakfast and in the evening god came at them eve are you there they fellowship together every evening now the enemy was watching and he was not happy about what god was doing with his children in the garden and that's where the matter started and that's where the issues start until today now brothers and sisters in order for you to know what is going on you need to identify yourself in the age where you are living in for you to know exactly where am i and that's the problem the church has today a lot of people they don't know how to identify themselves in the scriptures be because if i don't identify myself in the scriptures as brothers are pastor one preachers last night uh last sunday how are you going to convince yourself because the scripture is very very very open but how can you identify yourself into these scriptures and that's how you know really if you are in satan's eden or you are on god's side amen amen and i'm so glad because today is the birthday of our prophet amen amen it has a a big impact on us what kind of birthday oh it's a brand name birthday but dig inside pray god why brother brandon came it's not just a normal birthday brother amen amen so now to identify yourself in a scripture is when you're gonna see yourself in a scripture that means you see and say ah that's me an example the this samaritan woman how she identified jesus christ by the scripture because she identified herself in the age that she was living in she said this is the age where the messiah should come and when the messiah will come this is what the messiah will do and that was the word mere flesh on her edge that she was living in lord nobody preach her but the way jesus christ was explaining to her the way just class was describing himself to her she knew ah this is what isaiah said when the messiah will come this is what will happen he will tell us the thought of our heart now she ran in a village and tell people come and see a young man who is telling me exactly what is my life what's that she identified herself in the scripture so for her to know exactly where she is and that's what believers need to do can you just say i'm the message believer but identify yourself in don't just follow people to church because you are following them but you need to identify yourself in a scripture because once you identify yourself in the scripture that's when you're gonna see the relationship between you and god coming in common because you remember your salvation is personal between you and god my wife and my wife's salvation is not under me no my kids no it's just me and my god amen amen and that's what you have to what to do my precious brother sisters so on this last age i'm gonna just cut straight in this last age what do we have why brother branham say this is the settings heading because the church is in a situation where people claim that they are christians but they are not what a christian what kind of christian are you what kind of christian am i because in a garden when satan the serpent came and talked to eve by the time that she seduced eve that's when she went away from the way of god at the same time god stepped out of dargen now that became a territory of the devil god was not there anymore each time when god says something and you don't apply yourself to the word god said my precious brother i'm telling you that territory become devil's playground that's when we're going to pray there's no answer because god is not there anymore you become a cross land and once you become a consulate now the devil is there and once the devil is there he's gonna come and lie to people with a false preaching amen and once we become a false preaching now the devil is gonna just read the scripture but you can't really get the full meaning of what really the preacher is saying because god is not there because the life of god is not there anymore that's why you see people they're not changing you come to church but people never change you still the same when you see a little one i think i can get a little one there you see a little small ah i think i can smoke a little bit you see whatever woman oh i think i can talk to her all these kind of things because maybe you are in a land that is already cursed so now is me and you to identify really exactly which side are we my precious brothers and sisters being in a message is not sufficient just say i am in a message it's not but leave the message that's what the holy ghost wants you to do my precious brother you need to leave the message [Music] amen glory to god amen amen now let's read the let's read brother brandon a little bit here i'd like to read bruce branagh so settings garden we're gonna read uh page three paragraph thirteen let's see what preservation i'm saying here i want to speak to you something to bring to establish to to alliance to you the promise of god for this age see something not something that somebody else was in some other day but something you know how brother branagh used to repeat himself and then them things are all right we only refer to those things but i brought but i thought i will try to bring something to your mind with this scripture i got written here that will enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you are fighting in now to learn the tactic of the enemy so that you can block everything before he gets to you see that's the main thing is the loan to keep the punch of you as much as you can amen amen because we know the enemy is there brother he's looking for his looking for me and i'm gonna tell you one thing the enemy is not looking for denominations nah because he knows that's that's that's my territory he's looking for those who are not in his territory now in this last age what god have done for us what god have done for us on this last age because we were lost that's why i mean sometimes i said to people just claiming jesus christ is my savior as my savior even the devil he knows the devil knows that jesus christ is my savior he knows that word but tell tell the devil to believe brother branham as his prophet he'll never amen amen he'll never do that why because he knows that this prophet came to reveal everything from genesis to revelation and anyone who's listening to this prophet that means they know the tactic they're not to tackle me down now on this day the birthday of brother branham now is me and you to ask ourselves really what happened why president branham came it's been more than 100 years since brother mr brother was born until today now before that you have to see before that what happened because before that we were living in a dark ages nothing was revealed the devil was really in his territory he was playing around until branham was born now and then we have revelation 10 be fulfilled everything came to light after everything come to light now you my brother my sister was sitting there that's when now you came and said this is true because me and you we were in a denomination because we had the seed of god in us now when you heard that voice of god talking to you because the seed is like this you are the seed and then you have the ground right so the ground that's where you put the city in now you have the light the light that's god voice when you are in the ground as i said when you listen to the word of god that's the seed now yo you're gonna start coming out from the ground because the light is touching the ground now you start coming out because you listen to the word of god that was pretty scenario for you because there's a many seed brother everyone has a seat everyone has a seat now who are those that when the lights came and hit the ground and came out because i remember when i was uh well when i was a little kid my mom and i we used to go to uh um just to his fe to her field just to to plant some some um some beans oh oh to plants um uh some cassava or anything so when we're in a field in the farmer so we we just get there and we put like uh i can say like mace right corn we put corn in and then my mom said joseph you're gonna see it's not all these condoms we put in the ground all of them are gonna come out even though they look good some of them they're gonna be just dead and i was like why i said yeah that's the way it is and i said that's the way it is how i say yeah it's not me it's all about god i said okay and really three four days later i came back with my mom and you're gonna see the line that we put those uh those go in some of them did not come out someone yeah to be honest and then we go back and we take them out and put another one there the next day that one came out say ah what happened that one you don't have life in that's the same way you're gonna see how many people maybe they preach you this message with somebody else but you listen but somebody said no that's not for me that's the same way brother you've been listening the message with somebody else but you heard you say this is for me you said a man because you listened because say this is mine because somebody was telling you that ah adam and eve they ate apple but you heard the prophet came and said brother that was not apple and he said this is what i was looking for it's not apple i know something was right something was not right it's not apple now you just get there and you listen now and then you say this is mine you get it and once you get it now you live it and once you leave it now the holy ghost came in your life now you become a world flesh walking in the street of minneapolis [Music] and that's how god deals with all of us we need to reach that maturity of living the world that's where we used to go some others they used to be there and then they say i'm tired of this message i'm going back that mean it was not meant for you i'm not surprised because for me brother i'm telling you every single day that i listen to this message is new it can be the same message they preach for me brother every day every day is new brother because it's a spiritual food it's a food brother it's food we eat every day right we eat every day forget about just okay i'm in prayer i'm just uh fasting no no fussy just eat every day for you to survive right you eat breakfast dinner and so lunch and dinner maybe you eat just breakfast and dinner every day who have been tired of eating tell me nobody you see now is the same in the same way with the word of god every day you listen to the lord of god you rejoice brother you rejoice say yes this is mine you never go back brother if this was meant for you brother you're gonna keep going every single day every single day gonna keep going you're gonna be listening to it and you're gonna keep rejoicing every single day and whenever you go to the street you're gonna testify the goodness of jesus christ now going back adam and eve in that garden was just god was trying to establish that relationship and that's what god wants today brother this message is to bring us back to what we have lost i think whenever pastor one is going to start preaching about the 70 uh the 70 weeks of daniel you're gonna understand what i'm talking about is to bring us back to eden because that's what god was made hidden for that it was not for fun it was not just because there's a lot of trees there no brother god wants to visit you face to face because adam was able to see god face to face now today we can see god first of all because we have this flesh because we have sin between us now that sin that's what put a barrier between us and god now the only way you can talk to god is to talk to god through the scripture because the scripture does what can clean you and you can see god in another form which is spiritual but before adam and eve they couldn't see god's spiritual brother they'll seek god first to face like it is like i'm seeing my brother here amen now the only way for you to go back there is to get out of the zone of the devil's eden because that zone is so dangerous it's a zone where you can see god it's a zone where the preachers they're gonna just tell you what you want to hear they won't tell you exactly really what your soul want is a zone where the devil have taken everything the flesh the scripture they mix it up together and he gave to you and once you have everything mixed up brother you have nothing left but because if you can understand pretty good brother back then i remember because my mother she's a uh she's a pantocratist she's not a message believer i remember when i was a little kid five years or six years old i used to go with my mom pentagon's church but brother they used to cry a lot when they go to church they cry the preachers preaching people are crying or praying it's like they're touching them but today is different story people are so comfortable in a church like they're in a club it's like they want to drink some marijuana and drink i don't know what so they're so comfortable some of them they have their phones they put their yeah so what's that the devil has mixed everything up brother and that's what the devil want to bring into this message to us what that's why we should be so careful that's why matthew 24 said if it was possible you have to see what kind of seduction is that yes amen amen because we are elected because you are elected that's why you can't be deceived other than that brother you could be back then it wasn't like that people are so comfortable today in the churches they just sit there they just listen and some of them maybe they have their girlfriend and and then you ask yourself is this a church or is this so what is going on now when the brother brother came brother the whole story changed that's why mia called him the prophet of all prophets it's a great day today it's his birthday but look around what he has done jesus christ himself spoke into a human being what jesus christ have done on the cross brother branham himself is just part of the salvation amen he was to pay the price but the redemption was coming what jesus christ have done on the cross my preachers brother everyone can talk about it but now who can come now and talk about the bride the spiritual food of the bride because the bra after jesus christ on the cross there was a lot of work to do brother there was a lot of work to do until today they still have work to do that's why i said the devil he knows what jesus could have done on the cross but the devil didn't know really exactly what the bride needs for the rapture because that rapture you needed a real food a really spiritual food for you to go on a rapture and that's what a lot of people they are missing today because when you have their food their food is going to give you the access the key to go to rapture amen now god had to send someone behold i'll send you elijah the prophet be foul jesus christ before he said that on malachi cut he knew that okay i'll be on a cross but it's not sufficient until elijah come again and preach again amen remember it's still the same jesus christ he's still the same jesus christ brother but the true food because the devil have mixed up everything up now to bring people out of the confusion god had to send luke 17 30. god had to send malachi 4. god had to send revelation 10 7. amen amen these are the scriptures that people are passing by every day every day they are passing by one day i was talking to one of my brothers i say do you know about malachi 4. malachi 4 what i said malakai fo he went and read malakai for say ah that john baptist i said no read malachi 3 malachi 3 oh yeah it looks like makkai 3 does yeah now you have to look for malachi 4. now you're going to have to go to look for malachi 4. because right now we have only malachi 3. you know my akai 3 is john baptist right because john because john baptist he didn't come on a day of judgment no but this malachi we're talking about here is the day of judgment before this day brother found this guy if you find this guy you're gonna miss uh that means you're gonna escape this day amen amen you're going to find this prophet found this prophet and you're going to see yourself in a rapture and this brother was like i'm confused i said brother we need to pray this brother didn't understand at all i said okay let's pray i keep telling him about about malachi 4. until he understood that malachi 4 is another elijah who's coming before the judgment and when he will come he will establish everything the restoration of the word of god the resurrection of the bride something if they say restoration means what first of all that word restoration i'm not an english you know so native who's a okay i might just say this who is pure american here brother maybe you restoration meanwhile the restoration to restore to bring it back to its original condition did you hear that to bring back to brother speak up speak out brother did you bring back to an original condition thank you so much to bring back to the original condition amen that's what they call restoration because even jesus christ said in matthew 9 i think when his disciples said hey we said oh maybe the scripture said that elijah will come and say yes elijah has come come oh but that karma says something brother jesus christ said about to elijah yes elijah he all yeah he's here karma but when now the same second one will come he will restore now that restoration that's what the bride wants that's restoration that's what will take you to the rapture brother because since this event was already messed up by this by satan now god had to send someone to restore everything from genesis all the way to revelation amen i like that i like that definition brother bring it back to original like the original okay i don't know how to say it oh man that's sufficient brother that's good bring it back to original it's like it's like something that was already broken now you have some a original engineer who need to come and repair it exactly the way it works without putting anything in between nothing in there brother if you are true christian this is the way it should be bring back judge order this the way it was paul said if an angel came from heaven and preached another one hi that kind of restoration that we needed and that kind of preaching was already lost brother until when president came you wanna be a deacon you gotta be married only one wife no divorce no girlfriend here just one you wanna be a pastor yes you gotta be married one wife not divorced you wanna preach as a woman go ask your husband at home now the devil said ah human right to watch or i don't know whatever human right you know everybody is ego we are all ego yes we are yes of course we are amen but in front of god there's a limit there's an order that's the restoration that we needed a brother in this commemoration of brother branham birthday this is what blasphemy came to tell us that's what we needed brother identifying ourselves in a scripture when you read when you see exactly where am i and you can see ready this is me and that's why you can jump and say amen that woman to the to that to that pool the way she jumped brother because she saw herself in a scripture the reason why you believe this message brother and sister because you saw yourself in there and that's what we should teach our children because you were born in a message it does you have to identify yourself in a message yes our children on their turn you need to identify yourself in the scripture don't just follow me as your father i'm gonna tell you barack obama identify yourself earlier at least identify yourself because those are my children i'm gonna tell them identify yourself by telling them by preaching them every day so they can understand what the message means for them don't just follow me because i'm your father amen but come and cry and say god i need you i need to see you god in this last age you have sent someone who's gonna be there for me you spoke into someone because that's the way it's supposed to be because the promise is on those last days he will send a lie to the prophet elijah the prophet according to luke 17 30 that's the son of man that's a prophet because there's a difference between the son of man and the son of god amen amen so now the way god came in this last age he came as a prophet as he identified himself as a prophet that's when he spoke into a prophet and this is where we are today the devil have broken every single thing brother the deception is so high how they are my precious brothers and sisters everywhere you look around is deception you turn around your tv is deception eternally your phone is deception you go to work it's worse you're gonna street is worse how can you stay in the land of the message how can you my personal brother is by prayer prayer is the key that's the only way you're gonna come out of there my precious brother there's another thing going on out there that's why he's saying all i'm the message believer brother is not really sufficient you gotta go farther than that you gotta keep pushing and when you push hard and that's why you pray hard and you read the message hard and you read your bible hard and you keep coming to church and that's how the holy ghost will come in your life because you are crying out to god god i need your help god i'm here there's a deception out there i don't know because in this zone of the devil by crying out by singing amazing grace it's a really amazing christmas precious brother to get into this message is an amazing grace and never seen in my life because if we can start test testifying my testimony i can take two days brother me a little boy like this i know my minute is over me i used to steal like crazy you know back in africa back back in maybe early 2000s when i was maybe 10 years old 9 years old something like that you know we used to have like the cinema you know so you go to cinema and then they have a big tv with um they used to put like like a big cotton and then they do projection like this projection here so my mom she used to sell until today she's still doing it she used to sell oil they palm oil i know yeah so they palm oil and that to that palm oil that's why you used to get school fee eat and everything but i used to steal that money for me to go you know to go to the tier to the cinema my mom cursed me one day he cursed me because of stealing when i was in sixth grade when i believed this message this brother told me his name is bashige i see remember him and this brother until today we never met it's been more than 20 years we never met me and this brother he told me brother you need to come to god and i said come to god what do you mean i was a catholic so you need to come to god otherwise you're gonna die i was failing on my classes i couldn't so everything was really bad on my life as a 10 years old boy very terrible guy how do you 11 i was like this age very terrible boy brother but what the first day i put my foot in a message church that day brother until today i never went back you know to to middle school like elementary school back in africa we wear scotch right you know very short sorry you know very short like this so when you wear those my mom so when i came back from church i told my mom i don't know where to show it anymore my mom was told what are you kidding me i say yes ma'am i don't want to wear those anymore i said okay i mean something is changing here i went to school i used to play like he does music i still remember those musicians where i'm so giving piano baba baba i used to play brother when i went back to to school the day after that was sunday monday going to school brother i did not sing anymore i was a troublemaker boy to school fight i was the first one to fight and everybody saw me but joseph what's going on today i just came and just sit there and read start reading my bible people start bullying me how come you're gonna start reading a bible today what's going on boy i said no i'm not going there anymore i met a man i went back home i told my mom mom no more shots ma'am i need a trouser i need a pants my mom was like what's going on my mom saw that in one two weeks the money was there even if someone came to buy oil and before i used to you know get the money i put in my pocket and then run but now someone's come to buy oil and i give my mom mom this is the receipt and this is the money everyone was like what's going on with this boy and then i say ma'am it's jesus 10 years old boy brother 10 years old boy it's jesus my mom went to the market and get a pen for me yes to school i can wear those shorts but when i'm home i need to wear a paint because i can show my legs ah this is something new my mom keep observing me my grade went up the first second in my class what's going on all the teachers say joseph you become someone new that's the transformation that i got and then after that my mom my mom went to to her farm and get a big sack it's like uh i can say like um oh the pineapple yeah like a big bucket of cassava plus she went and brought a big chicken as something that she can offer to church she said this is an offer that i'm giving to this church for transforming my son into a better person but she never believed the message she did that one for me until today i never left until today i never left amen amen that is now now can you imagine at that age if i could continue like that when i was that age today i could be maybe maybe a big gangster smoking and marijuana and do anything so maybe i couldn't be here today now you're gonna tell me that i'm bored of this message no no brother no no brother i'm gonna keep going i'm gonna keep fighting fighting every day never be tired brother never never be tired brother keep going keep praying every day because there's something that you can hear but when i put my foot in that church brother as a 10 years old boy like this boy i'm telling you i heard something different and never even the atmosphere you know when you go to catholic church there's those here thinking people are running like this but when i went there the only the only thing i could hear it was the paper oh man something is right no something i could feel that deep that the atmosphere was different and then i was speechless at the same time observing what is going on in there i'll just keep my my my hand like this and when they start preaching brother it's like they are preaching to it's like that day even i talk to my brother i say did you take that preacher that's that's me that you know that's me i was doing all this i said no brother he doesn't know even you i cried like a baby one year later i was baptized 12 years old until today and the sunday that i show up to that church message beautiful church that the same sunday i was supposed to serve to the catholic church and i was supposed to you know to take that long cross like that because i was the servant my my fellow servant they came to my house said joseph didn't show up i said i'm not coming back the same day i told them i'm not coming back brother until today hallelujah that's what i said everyone has a testimony you're supposed to build a testimony with god your relationship with god the experience with god you have to build that because when i remember where god took me from brother no you better cut my head off you cut it off brother i cannot deny this message i'll never you cut my head off yes and that's what we need for us to go back to eden build that relationship with god his personal brother is personal because my experience is different from your experience different from yours different from from our pastor build your own have your own relationship with god fellowship with god god love love to fellowship brother that's what god wants the only way i can find you with him just read the bible read your message and pray you're gonna say he's gonna talk to you brother i'm telling you since the ego he gonna talk to you he have come to you and he would you gonna hear he would have talked [Music] [Applause] he is gonna talk to you you're gonna hear god talk because i heard god talk to me i mean it's up that's the only way you can do it brother have that fellowship with god i do believe in fellowship when a brother and sister came together i do believe in that i do believe when when when when a christian want to develop that relationship with god that's the only way you can overcome your anxiety that's the only time you can become your you know overcome your fear everything that you are going through is through that fellowship with god because this message is taking you back to eden what we have lost that's why it's taking you back brother don't expect anything more if you want to go back to edinburgh you're going to go back there because now you know the tactic of the devil this message came to reveal the devil to put him out thank you jesus and once he's out there's nothing he can do is now me and you to leave the message to stay in the line and to read between the line to stay in the land and to read between the line that's how we can overcome this because i know near close is very like the end is very near very very very like like right there it's coming i think the last uh i think the first time i speak over here say let's be ready and the only one and the one way we're gonna be ready is to leave this message thank you let's be there amen amen i really thank everyone for the time and i appreciate brother brazawan for giving me this opportunity and i believe that uh the time will come we're going to meet again and we're going to be together it's a really hard moment for me to uh to leave this place but i'm still your child my wife is there my kids and everyone and i'm you're gonna see me here coming like back and forth you're gonna see me here coming back and forth because we are in this journey together i'm not alone you are not alone i need your prayer you need my prayers that's all i can give you and also we need to pray for our pastor you need to pray for one another that's the only that that's that's the only thing i can really ask the church because you remember when when disciples they were like persecuted the only way they used to come you know to to stay united was prayer paul was that side philippe was on that side but was prayer when daniel was in babylon the only time he used to say this is the time i need to so there was a window that was facing israel and it was a time for him to pray and he went there and pray he stay connected to god honor with prayers that's the only way we can overcome this brother because time is coming and that time is very very very very near and we really thank god for this message because it's a truth that everyone out there is looking for and you are here brothers and sisters because you are predestinated to listen to this message as i said earlier there's a lot of people that maybe you heard this message together but they never believe it why you why me that's what you can ask yourself i'm not wasting my time you know wasting yours is god trying to invest his word in you maybe there's someone out there who need this message that's why when you eat you're gonna let me get to somebody else and then you tell them about the message you bring them back again to the bride of god i'm telling you this time is not going to end until the last one get in if he's a child of this little boy here brother we're gonna wait until that child of this little boy came to life by staying together in prayer may god bless you [Applause] because he leave i can face tomorrow [Music] i [Music] fear is gone because i know i know i know and life is one the living just [Music] i can face [Music] is gone because i know this i know yes i know [Music] one more time now oh because he lives i confess to [Music] is future life is what the living just because he lives [Music] once more let's just pray together as our brother as admonish us let's pray that for one another let's pray that the lord will be with brother joseph and his wife and and their young children that the law would help them he would keep them in the path of his word he would keep them [Music] and the law will be with us as well [Music] let's once again thank the lord for a word a message a grace brother branham said in the message perfect faith this work this word will not work for you the word of god will not work for you until you identify yourself in it he said jesus could have perfect faith because he knows he knew what the word said about him the only way the word can work for you is for you to be able to identify yourself in the promises of god you have to be just like that child i've never seen the mirror saw mirror for the first time and said mama this is me you have to say lord this is me you are speaking to me you are dealing with me thank you lord for dealing with me thank you lord for speaking to me that's the only way the world works for you [Music] when you
