also knowing that our faith is show in our hearts but let's read the scripture tonight and we will just trust the lord to be able to to say something to encourage ourselves before we get right into the communion tonight i refer to this uh i refer to this uh uh this morning or this afternoon and so uh i want to get back to it let's read chapter two of the book of colossians and reading from verse 8 chapter 2 reading from verse 8. praise the lord let no man beguile you of your reward is that what i'm reading what verse i say verse 18. i called only one eight i didn't call the one so which meant i'm getting cross eyes sorry it's chapter two verse 18. let no man beguile you of your reward in voluntary immunity and worshipping of angers and trolling into those things which he have not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind praise the lord i will come back to that again and now holding the head from which all the body by joined and then having nourishment minister not together increase with the increase of god wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiment of the word why as though living in the word ye are subject to ordinance touch now taste night handle that which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and the doctrines of men which things have indeed a show of wisdom in well worship will worship that's what i was referring to this this morning self-worship which things have indeed a short of wisdom in well worship and in immunity and neglecting of the body not in any honor told the satisfying of the flesh if year chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then be raising with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitted on the right hand of god set your afflictions on things above not on things of the earth for year i did and your life is here in christ here with christ in god let us pray heavenly father as you pray lord and just ask that god you will come and honor the fate of your children after lord gather service law this morning we are back in the house of god lord father precious lord and is to be able to honor you lord and father and also to appreciate the grace oh god that you have worked in our life father gail because without you lord we won't be here we prayed also lord god remembering your children and i will make the service tonight for one reason or the other we ask that grace will be their portion father and dear lord god those that are streaming in also we ask precious lord that you will bless him we love you we appreciate you father god we uh think about lord father brother uh mark wilson lord jesus from winona that was uh thinking to come this morning but because of icy road he couldn't make it remember father lord but wesley and sister carol out there we pray father lord for our brother for one hernandez lord jesus and his family we just asked for this different one's lord we lift them up into your hands so father lord garden and precious lord jesus we will lift into your hands lord a prayer request year that with these young people planning to go for eubank right there in horizon requesting that we remember them in prayer we pray the father you will go before them let it let it all god not be a sight seeing let it be father a heart seeing worthy heart will be able to see you lord i pray to god we give you every praise glory and honor as we now face your word in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed are you tired from the service this morning praise the lord you got something to eat amen you got some some rest i'm not going i'm not going to worry i'm i'm hoping that we'll be out ellen and because if i stay long it's my body that will pay for it praise the lord and uh so this morning we were we were taking the path and and trying to talk about you know crossing over and possessing our inheritance and uh crossing you know jordan and brad branham talks about jordan uh you know represent death you know but uh uh in in another way jordan uh uh in in some spiritual sense also uh uh you know uh represent us crossing over into the into the full promise praise the lord crossing over into a closer walk with god that's what i'm my prayer is that this new year will be for us that we have crossed over to a new year with for a closer walk with god amen a life of dedication but we were trying to show you know that even though these were seeds of abraham and and they were children of the promise and uh the land that abraham promised that he see we inherit you know uh but god decided to establish the patriarch 12 tribes by the sons of jacob and and and then we show how [Music] at the time of their natural birth you know that's where it comes from giving calling with our repentance uh uh under their natural birth they were born on a sign they were born you know in whatever sign they were born on a place them into their inheritance so that's out of that was what we were trying to look at but we started looking at uh from from from the mothers we which type you know our our first experience with god and uh our birth and finding our place because when we are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you are you are actually being baptized into the mystical body amen you have identified the bible says you have a good conscience towards god and uh me let me share something to you where you uh uh uh uh friday night i i got home and and just before i go to church and and some of the young uh uh little ones were all waiting for me to the house they have practiced a song they wanted to sing and i wanted to sing this song mary that you know that's your little boy now so they practice it i mean they really nailed it down you know they had they had their verses there was a way this person would think this person would jump in it was just so beautiful and and i sat right there they just asked me if they could if they can practice you know because i told them they have to practice before they sing okay if they can sing this song if i approve of it then they will be able to sing and they did a very excellent job i mean very excellent job if they if they put that together by themselves that was excellent but look at this now and and i started to talk to them i asked them what is the meaning of the sun everyone put their hand up you know uh it means mary did you know your son was going to walk on water you know beautiful explanation they gave to me and as we as we get into the conversation so then i asked him you know i asked him i said well uh uh think about the song mary did you know you're a little boy now now uh the one that we're singing about is jesus is he a little boy they said no then i said okay uh you know now if we sing this song mary did you know that your little boy will walk on walter you know uh uh in one sense we're still making jesus a little boy so which means every time his birthday come he will be a little boy you know and every time his birthday mary did you know your little boy and uh just talking with those with those little ones and little girls it was it was amazing to see how they could quickly come to understanding that this would just only be a song but it would not be appropriate to worship jesus because he's not a little one praise the lord as much as it sounds it has merit that you know your little boy will walk on water you know it has all of this but it's not appropriate why because uh uh is is placing you you see is is that cultural set of mind the person that wrote that song wrote the song for christmas with the mind that jesus is in the manger praise the lord which of course is a it's a a gospel songwriter by mike larry he wrote that song and uh but you know if you really bring it to term to look at it and it just amazes me the reason why i'm saying it is because you see the good conscious towards god that the word of god brings to the heart of even the little ones they might not have the kind of a revelation that you have they might not have that be able to dig in the word and but just to see the the the good conscious that they can be able to quickly grab it and says oh yeah wow praise the lord well i mean if it were if it was if it was uh you know uh uh uh uh another song i think they would have done a good job but now so this is what i'm talking you know so it all comes back to that early experience when god start dealing with us as as children many times we parents we struggle with it because you know in in our mind we are looking looking to see our children having the holy ghost speaking in tongues prophesying you know bringing visions when we ourselves have not got there yet and then you know and then we put all of this pressure on them uh uh with with this expectation you know the message say you shouldn't do that you know the message that you and that and and and and and we don't find a time to be able to nourish what the grace of god is doing in their life and how god is dealing with them the little things that they are recognizing the little things that you know the lord is helping them wave water is to be able to read their devotional or to be able to pray before they go to bed and and all of that we don't we don't seem to nourish those things but we want to see them you know why you know you you have that mind that's that's you know that's every parent uh uh uh uh subconscious things that we we gear right into you have that mind to see them doing the right thing you know uh but it it all goes back to us in our early walk with christ you know so the mothers there the the you know the the prophesied that the the groaning they were honored as they called this child out and and the things they said over the child became uh uh uh you know uh the order of their life where they would have been then we also look at genesis 49 where we see the father and on on his die in bed he comes back and then he called each of his sons and then he blessed him but the bible says that he says come and gather i will tell you things that is concerning you to the last day things that is concerning you to the last day so we see the mother as the alpha the beginning of their experience and we see the father which of course that's what the father is he's the provider he's the seer of the home he looks far ahead praise the lord now beautiful enough we we we see moses the prophet also coming there in deuteronomy 33 and he's taking you know he's taking that very thing because they're about to go over jordan he's not going with them joshua is going to positionally place them in the lane but then he's taking that again and then he's laying it out and we see how he did it by inspiration because of what jacob has said moses took a different order that right after rubin he called judah and then he called levi in what in one of you now so but the thing that uh uh you know uh uh that was kind of for driving our our inspiration this morning is to see that how with with the promise that was giving these people even though they went over to the natural land that the you know joshua divided the land to them you know some were able to to to to take their territory some compromise on their territory and all of that now we see is is it's a physical land but we also realize here there is a spiritual part you know that will that will show up later on you know they they they stay in their possession they did whatever they wanted to do and the years went back and in all of that and then coming showing right over in the book of revelation we see that god on the inspiration is is becoming conscious of something that took place you know uh uh uh in the history something that took place in their work something that well that uh uh you know uh uh the mob says well we didn't have no choice you know uh uh or maybe they were driving by their you know uh the uh the uh political party at that time you know because richie brown came out and said sir my father there with you this way and i'm going to deal with you like a scorpion so they said oh now we don't want you we just joined with jerry brown but to realize to see how this man raised us something in israel that became a sin for many generations the people struggle their struggle his struggle it took them into captivity with the assyrians they came out they took them into captivity with the babylon just because of that evil that was set up and and it's all the form of idolatry amen now so we we bring that down and and and try to compare it with uh with our with our walk that's what we were trying to do you know just like jesus said that the race is not to the swathe but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved praise the lord many of the people that have you know that have uh uh you know uh uh left following christ and have stepped down the astender left the message you know many of those people will say just like we can say today i would lay down my life for this word i would die for this message peter did it right in the face of christ say over my dear body any man would touch you and he meant what he said because he took out a sword and cut someone's ears off but just before the day break he denied the lord three times praise the lord so you see it brings us to the place it's i'm not preaching this uh uh a scare tati message here if you're feeding into a ski uh fear channel you better disconnect because that's not what i'm doing i'm not trying to make you scary praise the lord because the message that make you scary your soul don't feed on it it's emotional only your spirit feed on it praise the lord and so uh uh so what what we're trying to to help us to see here is the other this is what it is i read a quote here uh uh uh some time ago and and and where brother branham talks about how you can you can lose your your adoption you don't lose your sonship but you can lose your place it's shown all in the scripture we also talk about that how how the the first bone has always been swapping but that's a beautiful picture to be able to understand why the new birth is very important because you look all through the scripture uh king was the first born of of of eve but then a set took his place amen esau came out first but jacob took his place joseph brought madison and in front before him but the hand was crossed the younger one took his place now so you see jerry said that the scripture has a principle for the first born the firstborn has the breath right amen but you look all through the scripture aaron was the older brother but moses came in and he and he took the place david was the younger brother but yet over all his brother god honor him so you see god on a shadow was pointing to the new birth your first birth is your first bone praise the lord your first birth is your first born that has all the ethnic rights it had the right to lie it had the right to steal it had the right to do everything that is wrong because it's born in sin and shipley in iniquity your first born is your first birth praise the lord amen but we see in the scripture how god on the shadow slowly he started bringing in the one that was not considered the one that was hating and he brings brings that one out to prominence he brings that one out to a place like even uh a jeff time despised upon his brothers but yet god will bring him to a place where he will be the one that will deliver the people and he will be a judge over them so you see god hear the mystery of the new birth praise the lord he hear the mystery of the new birth just like branham shared you know talking about those mystery the measured of the new birth you know uh uh uh uh uh the holy ghost without sensation are we together so i mean that's that's what god was doing and that's what he's doing he's majoring on that new birth your your your body is going through struggle and different things are happening on you but the thing that god is building is the character that goes to that new birth praise the lord the first brother you look at the the prodigal son the firstborn he's the one that is complaining praise the lord but a younger son came back and then he became the one that was adopted so that's that's what i want you to grab it's not that uh you know the word of god or the message wants to be lazy the message don't want us to do anything i mean in everything that we find ourselves doing everything that we lay our hands to do on you have to realize that wherever you find yourself even stay in your bedroom lock the door close down the blind in that darkness god is going to use that darkness to beat you praise the lord he's going to meet that use that darkness to meet you you might get scary and look for light so you see that's that's what he's working on he's working on that birth it is his life that he has given to us are we together amen i heard someone say something they said his story has taught us a lesson that man has never learned from history praise the lord one last in truth there is that many i've never learned from history because and you see yeah it's just like verbatim said he says the devil steady us he said to us he if if he can just if he can just uh uh uh uh you know uh uh allowed us to get to the place where we can get passion about something or passionate about some he knows he knows how to work in that spirit realm he knows how to work in that spirit frame he knows how how to trap us you know the the people that don't know god well he can use all the things around them but for you that is desiring god he's always getting in that spirit room trying to use one of the senses of the spirit to always get at you now so that's that's what we were trying to to show this morning what we were trying to show there is that the you know uh let us not allow the enemy to create any form of idol in our spirit let's make no man an idol amen that let us make end nothing on otto the not the church and now the pastor not just no man and adam let's let's uh you know let's let's be able to move on with god don't make an idea an adult don't make a revelation an idol praise the lord having a revelation or understanding of the word do not make it because that is the very same thing that paul is addressing here that's the very thing that he's addressing with this church and he dealt with the same thing in the book of hebrew so we realize here but the thing that is that that is beautiful here is that he's using that very same world be god he says don't let no man begot you of your reward now that's the place where the emphasis was on this morning the inheritance was their reward right amen it was a physical reward and it was also a spiritual reward because you have to know that the the the the 24 others when brother branham talks about the 24 headers he make us to realize that it's made of the patriots amen they are going to they are going to have that as a reward are we together amen he said so don't don't don't allow any man to beguile you of your reward or stop you from getting into the fullness of your reward don't allow them man to be your reward christ is our reward are we together now so as he dealt with this he gets down and and and uh and and and if you watch what he's saying here you know uh uh we got you of your reward in a voluntary humanitarian worshipping of angels and intruding into those things which he have not seen you know where people can be so mystical you know and and people can and can word just on supernatural gifts and super all of those things they are beautiful but the thing about it there is that let every experience that you have draw you closer to god let it throw you right in the arms of god praise the lord don't stay with the experience and leave the word every experience must put you right in the hand of christ because he is your bridegroom he's granting you that experience because he want to draw you into a more intimate relationship he want to draw you into a closer walk but yeah he's talking about how people can be begotten of their reward by all of this angel worship and all you know trying to make things more mystical and and all of that and pretty soon is just all about themself trying to establish themselves in their own mind or in the minds of the people praise the lord now just like we saw in the scripture i have to close here now just like we saw in the scripture we realized that that was the thing that that that that that was that was terrible about this whole jeroboam thing that was the thing that was terrible about it because he was not concerned about the house of god or about the people getting closer to god he was just concerned about holding the people to himself and as long as he can be able to give them an idol this is the god that brought you out of egypt going over there is enough as long as he was able to get the people to come short of getting to the temple where they saw the shaykh coming down they saw the glory of god as long as he was able to get the people coming short of getting into the presence of god taking something for a substitute thy thing became an idol that god did not forget he did not forget that so in revelation he was trying to show because if you read revelation chapter seven you see that but if you go to revelation chapter 14 that the entire trap is back which of course over in ezekiel the entire trap is back that that that is in the millennium but you see god was showing in in in in type what happened to uh uh dan and ephraim you remember that in the scripture where the bible says ephraim has joined himself to un to his idol praise the lord and we we're living in uh in this age you remember brother branham talking about uh you know the statue being built the image being built he says the stone cut out of the mountain with our hands struck down your image and started to build a spiritual kingdom but then he make us to understand that the kingdom was built from the feet up and now he says we are in the eye edge he says there is nothing above that beside the intelligence the intelligence which is christ himself in the ih he he hold it down to uh a prophet because a prophet is a seer praise the lord that's spiritual that's dispensational but even physical we are in the eye age because everything that the enemy will use in this age and time to get at us he has put it on display praise the lord he has put it on this play so we see all of that that is the way of trying to to be god our mind of either being attached to some you know uh uh uh uh individual i mean it's it's just a soft i think appreciating the brother appreciating their sister there is nothing wrong with that but you see it becomes so subtitled that the enemy can just makes it so easy for you to stop at that that don't tell that guy say anything instead of getting to christ and say i want to see what the lord will say even if he would say anything to me let me see what god would say through him praise the lord that's how that's how uh uh terrible it is brother branham shared uh he said this in the in the in the seven in the seven uh seven seals message he said they she said he talking about the same thing he says and also in revelation 14 john seen them again in the troubled order that's the two of tribes he said that's right every tribe to his place what happened now remember he said under the heavens that his name will be blotted out blotted out of the tribe's fed under the heavens as long as as long as he was under the heavens there will be no more and this hundred and forty-four thousand is done here in in a tribal part yeah he says you see they have been blinded they have only the sacrifice of bulls and god he blotted them out under the heavens but the gentile in the days of the holy spirit against that your name he says your name was taken completely off the book of life and could never have have forgiveness in this word or in the world to come now so what what he's trying to put together here is that because in revelation seven two of the tribe means were blooded out and then when you come to revelation 14 the entire order was put back together now so brother branham is trying to to make us to understand here because what is happening that is exactly what paul talks about that man over there in uh uh corinthians chapter 5 that we read about let's let's just read a scripture here and then i will find a place to close amen i will find a place to close let's go to first corinthians chapter three i've spoken this before now this is paul now talking here he says verse 9. for we are liberals together with god we are girl husbandry yeah a god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masturbator i have laid the foundation and another men built their own but let every man take he how he build their own now he's making us to be cautious again now for us to be afraid amen he's telling you watch your environment watch what you are doing let's go on a little bit now he says uh uh for all the foundation can no man lay then that which is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver and precious stones will heal and stable every man work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire praise the lord now you see fire cannot burn gold off fire can only make gold to shine brighter fire would do the same thing to savor fire will do the same thing to any precious storms but it's different you put fire on wood you have this building coming down praise the lord if you put fire on hell you'll have this whole place burned are we together now so let's let's go in a little bit yeah he says every man work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revered by fire and the fire shall try every man works of what sought it is if any man work at bad which he have built there on he shall receive a reward so you see the same thing again the reward but but watch this now if any men work shall be burned he shall suffer lost what does that mean means that you are you're all about yourself you are not you are not you are not doing you are not working in you know what to glorify god it was is i mean if it is god-giving then it's pressure stones then it's go it's god that gave god if god i gave savior is god i gave precious stones it's man i made wood he cut the tree down and he saw it in make wood it's a man that makes help he gathered in the field and he put it together and makes hell are you grabbing the concept that i'm trying to deal with you amen so he's bringing us to the place of consciousness let's watch our walk with god as we move over into our inheritance it's all about god it's not about man it's not about you it's all about god praise the lord now that man went and did something wrong paul said excommunicate him to the devil so his flesh can be punished why he did that why he did that the reason is because he wanted the the proudness of that flesh because the problem was he did wrong and he was proud about it he then had a repentant heart he was a good brother but he was proud about it he was a seed of god but he was proud about he was just dealing with a pride and an arrogant spirit and all he needed to do was get in a situation where he would get on his knees and cry to god for mercy and sometimes that is just what god's children need they just need a little spanking from the father praise the lord in second corinthians he came back repenting paul says you're bringing me he's a brother don't start looking at him funny praise the lord amen because we know about his own we don't know about yours yet praise the lord we know about his we don't know about yours yet so don't look at him funny so you see it's all about him all about him sometimes god were allowed and put us in a situation it's almost like telling brother branham that there is a trial and not telling him what the trial is and the man brother branham has the gift of evangelist because in the fight for ministry is the two gifts that is honor the ego anointing an evangelist and a prophet so you know he the way he blasts in you know and people call him woman hater and whatever they want to say because i mean he would just tear everything down but yet right there a young man and young woman making love in the church you know a lostful spirit just came on them right in service and all because god was watching to see what his seven would do praise the lord all church members they can talk how the pastor can compromise he favors certain people i was there i saw them i saw them he never said nothing nothing he didn't say it about it he jokingly telling a young man you'll stop there if that my own child he will start rebuking them but that did not have anything to do with you that did not have anything to do with those young people they were just the instrument used because god was testing his seven and the law said because you did not condemn them you have passed the test and that's how sometimes we grow in grace the lord bless us our spiritual life is coming up you know we're receiving revelation from the world we are praying we are consecrating ourselves then a little trial just come along and the way you would deal with that he would either have to step you back a little bit he said go back you need to go back and work on this or the way you would deal with that he would give you a helping hand i think i need to bring you up a little closer praise the lord instead of us being i i seven and men seven looking at looking at us we better be looking up the lord bless you

deal with all of this but uh we will see how the law will will be able to to help us so [Music] [Music] praise the lord first corinthians 11. [Music] first corinthians chapter 11 we will read from verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i deliver unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me what a way to remember the lord people that's that's that's the purpose of the communion the purpose of the communion is not your spiritual status it's not where you are in your walk with god the purpose of the communion is to remember the lord to remember the lord you see the devil in his blame game oh you say you are this oh you are not that and so it gets in our head until we make this thing order by ourselves and where we are with god it's about him the purpose of the communion is to remember him how how do we want to remember him tonight you see just like brother branham said revelation series he said the body of jesus set on the throne as a memorial the only thing that is left with us as a memorial is this this is just a memorial we are not catholics this is not the literal blood and the literal body of jesus praise the lord we are not cut it's a sign that many people around the message try to become catholic in that way praise the lord they can they can disregard this word and then when it comes to communion they want to become like some kind of a nun or catholic priest this word is higher than this ordinance [Music] we are just coming to remember the law we take a reflection of what his grace has done that if it was not his grace we will not be here [Music] there's two in remembrance of me after the same manner he took the cup when he had saw saying this this cup is the new testament of my blood this two year as of as he drink it in remembrance of me [Music] for us as often as eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord on waterling you are not remembering him the right way if you think you can just come and become part of the communion and live any kind of a life it's a wrong way to remember him it's the wrong way and and and you're going to pay for it praise the lord we are not taking sacrifice from the communion we must be able to approach it with reverence we must be able to approach it with the right kind of a lie because that's the way we want to remember him praise the lord [Music] wherefore whosoever eat this bread drink this cup of the lord on waterling shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a manners examine himself let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drink it on water and eat it and bring a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are shaking we we execute them on you and many sleep let's buy our hairs now [Music] father we leave this bread to you lord father we come this evening thanking you now lord we have been taught by a prophet being taught by a word [Music] to know that lord god this is an ordinance that we must come with all sincerity and father god so we
