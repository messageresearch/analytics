TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the first fruit he was that sheep that's why they had the way that she or it was the first one that come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of it would come there was a sign and today because he was the first son of god to come to fall maturity to be in god he was plucked up from the earth and has waved over the people oh what a glorious lesson by the quickening power the first one all there is you've been typed in many times and we'll see later that he was typed but this is really the first fruits of them that said he was raised over the promised seed that had promise of life he was raised as the day of pentecost when there came a found in heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was at the pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to come and to be waved again we realized in the last days according to luke 17 30 in the sunday again in the days that the essay and of man will be revealed in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word would make flesh and dwelt welcome moments and of all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of god the word of god but found by wonders we see the day that in the book of luke here as we just quoted from uh luke the 17th chapter 31st and malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us let's give it a shot christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all types in many places he was the first fruits of those who said in the bride coming off christ coming out of the church there'll have to be a sheep again of the sheep what was the sheep the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was the wheat that proved it was a sheep i'm sure you see what i'm talking about i don't know it was waved over the people and the first time they will come forth for the broad age or a resurrection out of god's denominationalism will be our message that the full maturity of the world has turned back again in his full power and being waved on the people by the same kinds of wonders speaking to his wife because i give also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in christ jesus but god's question is power he was waved to them the word which he loved was way back through along the day of pentecost the word made manifest now and he's our face to be waved again in the last days now for instance you say when i went there brother bran i know a church that well i do too but now for instance what if if we were going to go back to tucson this afternoon now and each one of us had a was going to go in a a big cadillac brand new and all of the seats were made out of absolute skin softest of the leather soft and easy to sit in and the floorboards were plush the steering wheel were nickel plated and had diamond studs all over it and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels were all had bearings and greased up and the tires were all puncture proof and blow out free all been tested scientifically they've been pushed off the assembly lines both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline that's the running power the gasoline because it is the octane but now when you're going to start them all those that look just alike but there's one of them don't have any spark any firing power well you say the power is in the gasoline brother but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power that's there's a power there to confirm that this gasoline it just might as well be water until no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheath until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamics but it needs the dominant power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it should still be water see but the only proof of it life on it and it will prove words guys and when you try to put the holy spirit in the denomination you're as much as straight you get a splatter you'll ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but all i'm so fast that there is a 1014 power the word of god and a holy ghost light it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that shoved that cadillac down the road on the dynamic power of the holy ghost which came back to us waved over the people at the day of pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever that was the first sheep come up from all the prophets which was the son of god the king of all prophets there's been churches churches brides brides churches ride brides but there's got to come one hallelujah that has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamic shut up makes that church live in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelifter assignment our job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right there's got to be a dynamic to make it work that's what he proves he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word the body of jesus christ whole stepping dead in the grave shaken to life and rise again and roll away i am he that was dead so dead until the sun said he was dead the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics god's word he was a dynamic to prove it and is he being the group the bride has to come forth called this part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and the others that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bones life of his life power of his power she is him as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken his spirit the famous spirit coming the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him had put it together and made mechanics and dynamics and tell the church or the people all these easter bunnies and turtles and big churches and pirates will fail and pass away until that church becomes both time and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so hey why is that in john 14 12. he that believer told me the words that i do shall he lose hope [Music] amen i'll give him a charge of my dynamics and his mechanics that's [Music] the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up down all you want to and deny this word amen you won't do any good you're just cranking around them the pistons have got sparked out of fire but no gas need to far back it'll only work as they come together amen so one will set steel and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yes they both might look like both claim to be churches no claim to be bribed but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings it to pass but what he said is the truth it just won't no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics comes when the time enemy comes that bar is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that exposures it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion ever moved for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of god mechanic with the dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's a spark that fires the gas see you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the words the father living father sent me so send i you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything i do only that which is pleasing to god now as he sent me swords and it was the same mechanics it takes the same dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the dynamics will take its place paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but to spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner it's the same spirit that raised him up that quickened the true believer to eternal life i remember potentially now watch as we are getting out of our time notice the same spirit now romans 8 1. let's just read that again in romans 8 1 and we'll see what that says all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm sorry and romans 8 11. but if there's a problem there's this catch but if the spirit of him god the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt in you oh there you are if the bridegroom's spirit dwells in the bride when god made his first bride grew he made the bridegroom first and he was both man and woman in spirit forming in the dust of the earth and making material and notice when he made e from adam he took not another piece of clay he took from the same piece of clay the same word for adam was the spoken word you see he took from him and then taken the he had masculine and feminist spirit and he took the feminist spirit away from adam and placed it in eaves who are still part of adam's spirit is adam's flesh then it was adam's spirit the dynamics that quicken the mechanics of his body so the bride must also be flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh go become his flesh we'll get to it how is it done how what is this great transformation notice now if the spirit of him god that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you oh the productivity ones of course like the seed laid up on the earth the one that had life and many of them are dead they were just rotten seeds the waters and things burn them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life god know it was laying there now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the holy spirit comes to claim its own how this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the sun was set across the earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to lie it was not to bring all the dirt to the life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around alive not all men will receive crimes oh no but those which god for our dame life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's when it comes to quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the sun and say oh this old sun's so hot that rock said there's no sun so hot but that little seed said that's what i'm looking for and it began to spring forth the line it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to quicken the rock not to quicken the earth but to quicken the life of the seed now the holy spirit comes now of course it wasn't set why won't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to him god told me i don't believe i don't care what you say if you could raise up the dead or anything heal the sick and prove it anyway i still don't believe that this turn on your unbelievers it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't said to you it's said to those who will believe the message is to the believer to them to perish is foolishness but to them that are in christ and part of that seed is life my crude little story about the farmer putting the egg of the eagle egg under the heat see that little eagle was absolutely he was a he was an odd looking little creature when this uh farmer had did that thing that he did to put this uh eagle egg under this old hand and she hatched on a funny-looking chicken it was a it's odd a little salty he didn't look like him his feathers wasn't like the rest of them and he just he was an odd little guy and uh all rested chickens recognized him in odd fella and the hen went around he didn't even like the dike she was feeding me he just didn't like that scratching in the barnyard he didn't have nothing to do with that so he wondered why he had to be the odd one around there any thing and he never tasted anything that he just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it see because he was a chicken too biggest and uh the hen would cluck and you know days of miracles his pain there is no such a thing join the church it just didn't hit right with the little guy so he fought around the hands until one day his mammy the old eagle old laid so many eggs there was one missing she knew that that eagle was somewhere so she starts out on the hunt for him and she's turtles over the mountain tops and down in the valleys over and everywhere before he might of be by this time he it's time for him to be born the time from be hatched out so maybe a crow come in and picked up my egg maybe a vulture i don't know if something picked up my egg but i know that egg is in my mind i got a son somewhere i got the honey oh god he's that great eagle and his thoughts he wanted to have a church in order to have a people no matter what cuddled him no matter what he's hatched out under he's hunting he's hunting for his own and one day the story goes this old eagle flew over the barnyard she's looking everywhere and she found him oh for that resurrection to recognize that he really was a chicken astro he was an eagle and he's always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard a scream and said look up this way and he looked above him and there was a creature with 14 feet wings powerful in all the chickens there was in a bar in your heart and claimed him to be her son he said mama how can it get to you so just jump start flopping or you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere god knows hallelujah he's got a predestinated poor dane church you know he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the holy spirit begins to fly over that wave she he's the same yesterday just had forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how many tried telling him the eagle he didn't know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle he would understood it until he seen something that reflected him that he reflected rather and when we see not a denomination not a phd not a lld not a good neighbor but a son of god molded in the image of god with the dynamic power of god to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real ego recognizes the call of god's word why he's an eagle a ego to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word amen the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it this then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit of god to obedience to the word of god quickly what do you want to know how i could get there with her he'd been taught he couldn't do that you can't get no higher you jump he's a chicken see but this eagle said that's not soul well look at the chickens no matter what the chickens are your eagles just start spreading the whole joining get a little exercise in him start moving up the word to the word the works that i do shall you also he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he also because i live he lives also in the spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you he quickens your mortal body see what does it do now listen to what you know that this easter i want to mean more to you than any easter i want you to see we know what it's done for him but i want you to see it's not well it has done the same for you amen what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body that we live in it quickens it in other words brings it to life now you who once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything a bunch of cigarettes and you women who once had short hair and painted and carried on wore shorts and things like that oh it wants something to scream and you look down here and it was the word hey it quickened your you said no more shorts no more liquor for me no more no more stealing no more see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjections of love christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word then you say that these things oh i think it's hard for women to wear uh scratches when the words that knows the equations you do that i think you're drawn to it see it's you that it becomes you become part of the word it brought your body not well you say well let me tell you something my pastor i don't care what your pastor said what the word says if you want to be a chicken go on with them but if the pastor speaks different from this word then he's not a feeder of the eagles he's the feeder of the hymns see not of the eagles see eagle eats on eagles for them and queen of the bible said it's wrong to do that in the man and so forth and what all you do it's wrong say days and miracles just past this bible said he's the same yesterday forever let's say they have mental telepathy there's some kind of a mind reading this discernment all these divisions and anxious nonsense see they are chickens that's right they don't know what eagle food is but brother when you hear that scream there's something in you your ego should begin with why you are that seed that the resurrection of the s-o-n has gone in the wave sheep upon the earth to make you recognize that you are an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it it's the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal life now how we flesh of these flesh and blood is born because quickly while we're yet moral sinners mortal ready to allow these bodies it quickens that body what's quick it brings the line the spirit that wants like to drink run around commit adultery and all these it's quickened while the things die and you're resurrected it quickens your mortal body therefore your bodies is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics [Music] there's your resurrection there's the church in the resurrection with you these bodies right now are quickened see you've heard you believe it changed you probably denomination to the word see the dynamic if it comes upon water it will splutter paste some miracles but when he hits that 1000 oxygen the dynamics strike that but strike a chicken it won't do no good but when he strikes the eagle he moves out the dynamic with the mechanics see what i mean that is if he is a true eagle now he will understand let me straighten a little scripture here for you i think we're off of the phone but we are still here saint john 5 24. jesus said he that teareth my word and believe us on him and send me has everlasting life now look i go down the street just take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding i'll make it say nothing else but it's saying what it says see the right word there in the greek in the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right i go down yours there's a drunk coming along the streets with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking god's name in vain and everything else like that save did you hear that preacher said did you yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle now brother brown want more scripture in that all right my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow amen as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had told me that i come said it just the way he told me some minister lady gave me a right triangle balling out she said i guess you take the place of god i said no man said what you told her sin is forgiven the word said only god has power another pharisee i said you see that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was he told denied christ the son of god he said blessed art thou the son of jonah flesh and blood never this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys whatever you find on earth what you lose on earth that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day but the sun the groom it's a flesh today by the bride whosoever sends your remit to them they are remitted whosoever sends you retain to them they are retained now the catholic church picks that up and takes it to the priest but that's carnal watch it was a spiritual revealed word that did it that's reason he told him go baptize the name of father son holy ghost he knows they know who he was talking to a little preacher the day he said to me he said brother branham i've come out and joined one over to a certain uh certain church a pentecostal church where the pentecostal now has started taking the round wafer you know you've heard of that i guess the kosher the moon god you know and they all accepted it and taken it this man said this congregation went through he said what are blessed is blessed now you know what the priest says he has power to turn it back to the body of christ see just six to one half dozen the other that's the same and um he said i want to ask you something he's trying to dodge that issue of the baptism in jesus name because this was the man that said it was it was the antichrist that did that he said do you think it's all necessary that a man should be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's the gesture he said after he's been baptized in the name of father son holy ghost i said yesterday he has been baptized amen he hasn't baptized it all amen no name that's the title i said it isn't recognized i said why did uh why did peter he said well let me tell you something he said now in acts 10 49 he said why peter he had to speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them but i said he turned right around and said can a man forbid water these should not be baptized he said when you're speaking over there a while ago about acts 19 where paul passed it up close to absolutely find them disciples and said well i said they wasn't baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost i said no they were baptized unto repentance not for remission of sin unto repentance because jesus had been made on you the sacrifice hadn't been killed he said well why do they have to be baptized or i said the man that had the key said this forbids knowing unto you that there's not another name under heaven given among man whereby you must be saved salvation alone goes in the name of jesus christ whatever you do in war or indeed do it all in the name of jesus christ there's not another name no church no hierarchy no titles or nothing else yet he is the rose of sharon lilly valley morning star alpha omega beginning in the jehovah's rapha manasseh all these he's all these things but yet he there's not no salvation in any of those titles jehovah no salvation rose of sharon that he is no salvation father son or holy ghost no salvation only the name of jesus christ and then the bible says that repentance and remission of sin must be taught in his name beginning at jerusalem now to the outermost parts of the earth he said do you think it makes any difference i said sir i want to ask you something he and i and my wife were sitting at the table he just moved over stimulants i said we are both arizonans we live here and i and we know our council and our ward and all our mayor the governor everything he said yes i said now if i told you brother to go over here and sign up for our dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona would you go sign it like that do you think they'd receive it at the desk well he said i guess not he said why did jesus say that after this is it see wow if i told you to go sign for this dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona and us being citizens of arizona and knowing who the governor is what you notice sign it in the name of sam goddard see i said because he is the governor of the state i don't have to question you you know who the governor is when he said father son and holy ghost he knowed how to go to baptize they know who he was my sheep hear my voice he said oh i see but now the next thing what do you believe he that heareth my word and believe us on him that sent me has everlasting and when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential when you have received this holy spirit now that they did at pentecost they were the mechanics now the dynamics had to come they had believed you know our good baptist friends tells us when we believe we've got it but they didn't have it yet they believe acts 19 did believe but they didn't have you received the holy ghost since you believe see they had the mechanics all right because the apostles were i mean apollos was teaching to them and proven by the bible the mechanics that jesus was the christ but they didn't have the dynamics yet that's it all right what panics you potentially have the earnest the waiting now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come to subject to the word it make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different now look then quicken you who were once dead in sin and trespasses and darkness has he quickened what by his spirit that raised up jesus on easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal body now what it also quickens brings to life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else or it will quicken your mortal bodies to the word so it will you can't run without it you just splutter you don't believe all of it if you have pork gasoline part water you ain't going to go nowhere you've got to take it 100 gasoline if you don't you're back for you ain't got no power well i'll be this one don't believe that don't you ain't going nowhere but oh when you take the let it light up on that ever
