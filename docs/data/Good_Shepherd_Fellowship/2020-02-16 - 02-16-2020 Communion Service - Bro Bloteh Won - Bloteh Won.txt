[Music] [Music] praise the Lord let's take our Bibles tonight musicians thank you for happiness praise the Lord amen by the way of an announcement when we get over to the communion we will take the communion and then brothers you we have to remember we're going back there the sisters we use the place of worship tonight for their foot washing so we just want to bring that to you by the way of an announcement praise the Lord as I chapter 5 as Iook after 5 praise the Lord this morning we were speaking on neighbors being yeah we wanna stayed in a tux or Fubini out tonight so read Isaiah chapter 5 verse 1 now I will sing to my well-beloved a son what he's doing present tense what he's doing in our mess why he redeem us for why he redeem us why he have took us through different trials why he have given us grace and an overcoming power in different areas of our life because right now god what it is it don't have to be a big thing it can be anything it's more effective than when a person will say so I want to pray to the Lord Jesus is the Lord Jesus fights against the church on earth when when Jesus revealed himself to pour water he said why are you persecuting me poor never met him in the flesh but what was persecuting the church because the church is the living body of Jesus Christ and I stand on it on the authority of God's Word to tell you tonight now if you don't believe what we are doing in this assembly just get away from me praise the Lord because I believe that God has a body of people that are dedicating himself to God amen praise the Lord and we will invest in that body well invest in what God is doing praise the Lord amen that's what the devil finds the church remember brother Brennan says he's not going to let you to be that way he's going to do everything and anything he can do amen you rather stare out something among the people I'll make a little gossip to go around and and and and and and and break the fellowship of the people break the joy of the people why because he knows the power that is in this living body their body on the throne can do nothing until it has a body on earth that is dedicated praise the Lord they have never been a time in Christian history word you have a bunch of people calling on the name of the Lord Jesus with with no commitment it's just easy to take a badge I believe the message and it can run from one message church to another message Church then looking for the best the best preacher they're looking for the best congregation and and no sense of commitment praise the Lord and the devil would do all those things among the people why because he knows the power that is in the living church he knows that when two or three come together when two or three come together and agree on anything praise the Lord he can make us to be looking in the future for something when the very thing is right under our nose praise the Lord it's right on our nose can you imagine what will happen in God can just open our eyes and open our understanding and stir our hands praise the Lord that was the reason why the move of God was so strong after the days from the date of Pentecost and after because the scripture says the people dwell together in one Accord Amen you know what was happening yeah I mean every time they gather together they they were expecting some kind of a miracle to happen it was expecting God to just do something praise the Lord those disciples had just they just came from an experience where Jesus enter into their meeting not coming through the door they were gathered together he just came right into their meeting show his hands if you have that kind of experience every service you expect Jesus to show up now when if the people come to church with that mindset expecting Jesus to show up praise the Lord God it's working right now in this body here on earth praise the Lord in this body right here on earth we must be able to see God moving in the lives of the young people see God moving in the life of husband and wife praise the Lord and I say all of this to come right back to the place that God has always looked at his church like a vane yeah amen and that's why Jesus over and over he speaks their parable a man that has a vania and then he raised up a man to be a stealer over the Ivania that's what the Prophet the prophets were to Israel that's what the Prophet was taught to the aged that's what the pastor is to the church or the faithful ministry and God on only needs the fire for ministry he gives all the men's gifts he gave all the main ability just every one of us finding our place and when we find our place you know what we look for we look for the little foxes that spoil the van praise the Lord amen whatever you can use to find a little foxes because we must get the foxes out of the vine if now they coming eat all the leaves and eat all the fruits with a little gossip year then a little suspicious next year then a little is in here and in what of you then before you get to know with your brother balances is just like a cop's that being dressed well sure it is nothing but they're cops praise the Lord but if we can use whatever God has placed in our hands to get the little foxes away praise the Lord when a little suspiciousness comma better Bantam says you tell the devil no sit on you I a liar that's my brother God has always looked at his church and his people through the ages like a fan yeah praise the Lord when we look at our home like a vein yeah look at the family unit praise the Lord we rejoice in seeing our our our children growing in a faith even if the glory through one trial or another we rejoice in that God believing that God is dealing with them wherever they are and whatever their situation is praise the Lord he says I am the vine ye are the branches if we just stick up whether it's a hole you have in your hand or this is stake you don't have to come running after me I don't have to come running after you let's look for the little foxes and get them from the vine praise the Lord then you would enjoy the fruits that we grow our enjoy the fruits that we'll go we will enjoy the atmosphere praise the Lord all the beautiful perfume that all the leaves and the different trees were put up together what are the young people singing or whether you know there's somebody praying we all will enjoy that if we get the foxes from in Irvine this by our house tonight and pray as humans we will always have will always be misunderstood you could be saying something and I never had the right I will miss understanding but if I know that that brother it's a vine that is planted by the Lord I will not want the enemy to put know a feeling in my heart if I know that sister no matter what she's going through she's a vine that has been thrown by the Lord for a new growth I would not want to take no negative thinking in my mind even if I don't see her in church for the wide and she show up oh I don't see him in the church in church for the why or you show up I'm not going to take a negative attitude I would I want no evil thing to go through my mind change my heart O make it as for true change my heart Oh may I like you change my idol God yes change my heart Oh making ass was true [Music] change my heart Oh [Music] may I be like you now are the potent Dada [Music] mommy'll and make me this is what I [Music] change my heart Oh [Music] change my heart Oh may I like you let you speak to him tonight [Music] we spear in flew through me flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me I lay my hands in washi to my if I die need me holy sphere I just pray for one another tonight if a brother or the sister the family is now with us tonight and they come across your mind just say a word to the Lord and ask that God watch over that vine that God will be able to bring fruit out of that vine that you would just he would just he would just deal with us he would just knock our hearts together he would just pull us together like the hand will bring her young wants on the whole wings as the holy spirit to be our leader as he have always been his grace would just be with each and every one of us remember our young people committing them in the hands of the law that the grace of God will be able to deal with them medium at the very points of their needs and we just remember all of these ones in Jesus name father dear father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ creator of heaven and earth we come Lord in all guarding asking you for in our house before you Father they are the great shepherd the Lord of ours saw the giver of life in every good game father we come to you tonight Almighty God we thank you precious Lord for the Lord where you have loved us we can be called the children of God Father we come Lord Jesus pour in our has before you tonight all the alluring and asking to God father nor in the law we are dealing with an enemy that know his time of God and whatever he can do Lord Jesus to pull us away from the great fellowship of the holy spirit to pour away into an isolation of God to pause way father in to deny to God and put us away into lives he's going to do it who father God Lord Jesus all he have to do it is to just speak to that reasoning and continuing to breathe upon a new Godfather but Lord we will turn back to your world tonight and to know that God father Lord Jesus we are stand tonight because of a blood that was shared we are all redeemed by a blood a price that has been paid Lord there is now one soul in this building tonight Oh God that can come any other way
