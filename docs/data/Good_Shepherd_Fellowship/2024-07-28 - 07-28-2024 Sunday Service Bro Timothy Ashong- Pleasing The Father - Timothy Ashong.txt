and and greet our visitors I think you all Fe a little change in the service this morning but uh uh the service last night and uh and and the service this morning as a continuation was actually supposed to be our 29th uh Church anniversary services that we should have done last week because of some reason we thought that we would do something different and what we wanted to do uh this week was to put on the Garment of Praise like I said amen for the spirit of heav and we really want to thank the Lord that he came true for us last night amen he came true for us last night praise the Lord you know uh uh he's our presentent help in time of trouble and his strength is made perfect in our weakness praise the Lord and uh uh just like uh brother Liam said uh we got Mee him in teny uh preaching for Brother Bill Young's uh friend of our was there and uh uh so we we ask him if you uh spare some time of his busy schedule to come down and and and minister to us in singing and he he gladly accepted the invitation so we kind of for work it out for this week but uh uh when he came in he told me even before then he text me you know to pray for him he uh he was uh having which of course he told me it was very strange and uh and I just believe that it's the devil that was trying to to stop the weekend amen and he asked that we pray for him so I told him okay and then so when when he got in we were talking a little bit he told me I was almost close to cancer and i' never cancer and uh so we want to thank the Lord that uh uh he was able to make the sacrifice to come praise the Lord and uh so uh we want to greet uh him and his wife sister Lewis praise the Lord amen and uh last night I did a PO job I didn't greet the visitors please forgive me that was uh that was very I was I was too excited amen so and uh so we want to greet uh uh brother Leon and sister Louis uh we really enjoy having fellowship with them praise the Lord I really enjoy spending time with them and u uh just like I said also we want to greet uh uh Sister Rose and her son brother fed and uh there's our sister that just sang for us and uh uh she and her son from Chicago there with brother Wilson Ral Wilson Sister Rose is like a big sister to me I have many of them so you they'll keep coming praise the Lord I'm from a very big family I told you right from the beginning and uh many years ago uh uh one of the ministers back from Nigeria contacted me she was moving over to join her husband in Chicago and uh uh so uh we knew our friend there brother Robel Wilson that was the closest person where she could Fellowship so we we REM recommended her to uh to the to the group there and then ever since uh uh she and her children her daughter got married and she she's mov out with her husband but uh uh she and her son fed and even the husband has been very close to us praise the Lord and uh you know it's it's uh it's difficult to pass to people from distance I don't I don't know how other do it I can do it so uh brother Robert Wilson is her pastor but I'm her brother amen amen so she talks to me about everything so good to see you sister f amen I mean uh Sister Rose and uh and brother fi and then uh we have another visitor and he's a special visitor to me and my family there uh brother James James is back there and uh James used to be and uh one time we were we were trying I was trying to get uh uh someone that will that will uh uh teach uh way instrument so uh if you remember uh some years back we have brother uh what is his name brother Ezekiel uh Spanish brother with his boys so uh one of them were learning the saxophone and the other one was I think playing on the trumpet or so so I was looking online to find a teacher that would do wi instrument praise Lord sopone is one of one of my instrument I love the SAS I can play so uh so I I I bought this instrument and then I went online and then I saw an Aver and then I contacted James but just at the time to the family was going through some changes and they had to move back to to Oklahoma the there was now well in all of that and all the things that happened but then we got in contact with uh with James and then he uh literally became a teacher to my children you know and was also uh uh part of the family he was I mean he was just part of the family just enjoyed to see how he and the kids uh were fooled around you know on their birthday and different things they told me that he was coming I never knew it was today so James it's good to have you praise the lord it's good to have you [Applause] so uh with time now being very uh friendly with us as we would like it to be praise the Lord and uh uh uh we that's the reason why we had the change in the order of the service i t that uh because I told Brother that he would do us uh uh some singing uh a few songs Saturday night and if he can do one or two Sunday morning before the preaching and uh so that's why we stay they kept this stage for him so uh we will we will have we have uh our brother come and then uh he will do uh a song uh or two that he will Fe LED and then we will change the order of the service I know brother uh Lawrence told me there were a couple of other species but you are with us praise the Lord so uh we we will ask that you bear with us let's uh let's uh just enjoy our visitors that will be leaving tomorrow Sister Rose go back tomorrow and uh uh the young go back to Tennessee tomorrow so Berlin you are welcome come up God bless you [Applause] [Music] could you imagine receiving a package beautiful wraps and pretty bows and and you open the package there's not anything in it I feel that way at some Churches I've been to but here a beautiful package and the bows were all perfect and I opened it and the joy of the Lord spring from that package and the smiles on people's faces and the wonderful Pastor you have God has blessed me to be here and enjoy this and see the miraculous Brad of Christ that has been molded from nobody knows where only you know where he brought you from but it's such a wonderful thing thank you for there's three things you tell you're getting old your hair turns gray your eyes gets dim and there was something else anyway I think people have more fun than anybody's just I want to laugh and sing and praise the Lord and because I've been born again not to be a old grouch or sit around not smile or not speaking nobody but just manifest what's in me I'm filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's the same today as he was ever was when he walked the shores of Galilee he's right here the same Jesus Christ this morning when I first came to message I started listening to the messages in here the prophet tells stories and one that got me in years ago talking to hady rod and uh you know her boys were kind of a little mean guys and and hadie had he said the right word and the prophet said just ask anything you want and you can have it and she said the salvation of my sons and they came and gave their heart to God so reading that and think about I wrote a song many years ago a woman named Mary received a visit from an angel of the Lord she said be unto me according to Thy word she said the right thing and the promise was given to her just say the right word what you ask will be given just approach him with the right attitude had he right said that's the truth brother Brandon she said did the right thing her sons received eternal life around 900 denominations claim through his pridee they all say he's coming back for them oh but to show down is going to tell who belongs to him she'll say the right word the rapture's going to take her away from here just say the right word what you ask will be given just approach him with a rise atud had he right said that's the truth brother Brandon she said the right word her son rece eternal love amen [Applause] little closer there you go great I have a song one of the biggest producers in Nashville he wanted to record it was a big people like Gaither but U he said I want you to rewrite the second verse because he didn't like what I said and the title of the song was Jesus on your [Music] hands and you're looking at a man that's got some mad he cried almost thinking about changing the words that Jesus gave me to saying to his bride to please those people out there you can have it brother amen give me the truth give me peace of mind I would never betray him he never betrayed us oh thank you Lord the head is TR and [Music] P all the unbelievers came pilot said I find no fault they screamed away with him place on him a purple Ro crucify this man and release to us let his blood be on our [Music] hand he'll either be in your [Music] heart on your [Music] hand once you met the Savior you'll never be the same again oh you can turn and walk away or you can choose this man he'll either be in your [Music] heart be on your hand here's the verse he want me to [Music] rewrite Jesus said he would return things would be the same that oh unbel and crowd they turn him down again so he sent an [Music] indictment for crucifying him again here what they didn't like they chose their [Music] denominations now he Jesus he be your heart or on your [Music] hand you met the Savior you'll never be the same again oh you can turn and walk away or you can choose this man he'll either be in your [Music] heart be all

sick be healed Lord Lord may your name be glorified Thou King etern there is Noone like you bless us father in the name of our Lord and our savior the Lord Jesus Christ we pray with faith and Thanksgiving amen let's just read the scripture before we sit down praise the name of the Lord let us read from the gospel of St John joh let's read chapter 8 we read verse 28 and 29 then said Jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that I am he and that I do nothing of myself but as my father have taught me I speak these things and he that sent me is with me the father have not left me alone for I do always those things that pleases him amen amen let's be seated while I read from the book of Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 let's read from verse five by faith Enoch was translated that he should not sit death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word amen amen so this morning we greet to all in the name of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ Our Redeemer and our all in all we want to thank God that he has given us this opportunity to come back to his house and we thank the Lord for this last night and the son worship and I thank God for our our elder brother who has committed his life to sing the Bride As song hallelujah it's a wonderful thing and I pray that every one of us will find our place in the body of Christ to do that which places the father in John chapter 6 verse 38 Jesus said for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of F that sent me and this is the Father's will which have sent me that of all which he have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day yes and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone we seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life amen and I will raise him up at the last day Hallelujah so just to read the scripture alone is a blessing Hallelujah and we love the Lord and we love his people hallelujah and uh I just want to read this quot here before we go the prophet said I was sitting back with brother wood just a few moments ago and a certain little fellow that's been around the church here for a long time he's always wanted to find his place I believe I could tell him if it's just if he did just do it it's singing brother Temple you might do one thing and another but you are good singer I sure appreciate that and if you just tend Yourself Loose to singing God will use you amen God bless you and the prophet said you know I run over everything else but the right thing get in the singing there is your talent you have to use that wonderful so I just read that in appreciation of the ministry the gift that we just saw demonstrated in the life of our other brother and every one of us must find where our talent is and when you find it use it to be a blessing to the body of Christ I want to thank our pastor but I want for giving me another opportunity to be here and to Fellowship ship with the Saints as always said I just love the Lord and I love his people and I love to encourage the people of God to keep pressing on Amen the upward way yes for soon and very soon all will be over and I just look around and I see that we have already finished first part of the year the seventh month is ended and as we know every passing day bring brings the coming of the Lord closer so we are 7 month closer to the coming of the Lord because seven months has just gone and then the question or what I have what I thought of and he said uh we all can test testify everything that is around us testify that something is fixing to happen and if the seven the coming every passing Day brings the coming of the Lord Jesus closer then my question is have you been brought closer since the year began since you have been hearing the word since you have been hearing the preaching since you you have been hearing the songs since you have been coming from the coming of the year to this hour how closer have we been because he's coming nothing will hold him but will you be ready and are you ready every person Day brings is coming closer think on these things how close closer are you to him it's good to come to church but coming to church alone is not everything there is a reason that we come to church not to show ourselves or the cloth that we wear which is nice you're all beautifully dressed but how closer are you to his coming all these days and weeks that passes by has that has has it brought you closer to him may the Lord help us amen and this morning just to encourage ourselves I want us to speak on pleasing the father and the scripture tells us Enoch before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased the Lord amen our lord Jesus told us in the scriptures I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and he said the will of him that sent me is that all that he has given to me I should lose none of them so he knew why he came if he did not know why he came he could not have paid the price even though it was a difficult thing to do remember even when he spoke about Calvary I'm going to Jerusalem and he was speaking to the disciples and he was telling his disciples what is awaiting him and he was was telling them oh I'm going to Jerusalem I'm going to be arrested and the son of man will be betrayed and all of you will leave me and I will have to go alone and brother Peter Apostle Peter told him took in the Bible say and rebuke Jesus don't say you are going to die we love you don't and Jesus said get it behind me you don't even know the things of God you don't know what you are talking about so he knew why he came and he did not allow his closest disciple or the chief among them or the great Apostle Peter with all the revelations and the claims Jesus because he knew why he was born why he came here he did not allow anybody no matter how close they've been to him no matter how much he loved them and he wanted to stay with them he said no I must go am pleasing the father what are we here for what have you come here for what have I been born for why have you believed this message why I we here we must know what we are here for because you cannot do much until you know what you are here for no man will progress until he knows the ground on which he's progressing until you know where you are standing that is why Apostle Paul said I know whom I have belied amen and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to his trust so it is becoming of us to know what we are here for now as we talk about pleasing the Father the scripture also told us or speak to us in the book of uh Hebrews that we have read spoke about Abraham spoke about Noah spoke about and spoke about Enoch and then and then and then the scripture told us Enoch live on this Earth Enoch walk with God amen amen and remember a walk is Progressive it's not marking time it's walking and he said he worked with God and he was not seen because God took him away and then he told us by faith he did that Faith with his Revelation and then that is revelation is the will of God made known to you right to know the will of God and Revelation brother told us it makes a difference in everything we do in our worship in our services in our callings it does makes a difference and the prophet taught us it made the differ in the garden of aeden between Cade and Abel amen let me just say something to you I see some people already starting to doze sleep off and I want to promise you I will let somebody call you and don't think that I'm embarrassing you I'm embarrassing the devil amen take note of that because I promise I will help you thank you and I will not let the devil deprive you praise God Amen because that's not what you came here for it's too early Hallelujah I remember I think somewhere last week I was preaching in how you some where the L and then I see somebody trying to me I said hey I give you my warning if you sleep I will call you I'll make somebody call you I thank God for that sister after said brother thank you it was me thank you for calling me and I really admire that sister and she was telling I was the one that they were speaking to that's good so don't worry I will help you amen praise the Lord so don't let the enemy deprive you of what you came here for you didn't pay your transport or drove to come here so that you do off may God help us you people go to the stadiums they don't they don't sleep and they go to their Stadium even before the people start to play the soccer or whatever they already charge up they already singing they already shouting so that they beat them upon their shouting discording they same but we are talking about an undefeated Champion a mighty conqueror who conquer both the seen and the Unseen World we are talking about the resurrected Christ he is our hero amen he is our captain he is Our Redeemer he is alive Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so I don't like people to come to church and do the things of God as if we are mour we are not mourning we are celebrating the hero we are celebrating the mighty conqueror we are celebrating the resurrection and the life they all in all somebody clap for Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord Oh Glory to God I'm telling you the way you are clapping the people in the state they will not be clapping like that they clap for men and they clap and they and they raise their hands and you are cing for Jesus like this the T of our Salvation the Lord of lords and the King of Kings he's our savior he's Our Redeemer he PID the price of redemption he is alive the people of God must worship God the people of God must praise God the people of God must God oh we to glorify him he is the king of kings he's our coming King he's the Lord Of Glory he's worthy to be praised and he's worthy to be worshiped oh hallelujah oh praise the name of the Living God hallelujah I love to worship him I love to praise him I love to exalt him and glorify him for if it had not been for Jesus where will I be and where will you have beenen oh yes he paid the price of redemption amen he gave his life amen if somebody pay your morgage for one month or you are to be cast out taken out you you've gone into depths and he comes he said I'll paid amen he paid for it amen with his life amen yes he pay your debts the debt that you own the debt that I own we could not pay and the Creator Emmanuel God became flesh amen God was St naked amen Jehovah was pit upon Amen to pay your price to pay your debt is worthy to be praised he worthy to be worshiped let's worship him with a meaning worship god with many know what you are here for hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen may the Lord help us amen hallelujah amen the prophet of God said we've got to get in such a place till we are translated like Enoch was Hallelujah that's right he had this testimony that he pleased God he had the testimony by faith that he pleased God is that right and the Bible said without faith it is impossible to please God so you've got to have the same

of dressing do you know that offices have code of dressing right may God help us change amen are we getting it Jesus I do that which always pleases the father Emmanuel God in flesh the Bible said though he was God he thought it not rly to be equal with God but he humble himself and made himself of no reputation amen he the Bible say he was obedient to death amen uel obedient to death whatever it will cause him to please the father he was ready to do it what are we doing what are we doing Church bride of what are we doing elect of God what are we doing and remember our God said I am a jealous God God said he said I'm a jealous God Amen that is why he told Abraham take your son the one that you love go and sacrifice him for me because that was everything to Abraham Isaac I'm Ling he has testified that's my son yeah God gave me to him and then God said enough of your boast enough enough of your talking take your son Isaac God specify Isaac the one you love and go and sacrificing for me he didn't explain anything God didn't explain amen and listen God will not explain nothing to you he doesn't own as explanation it does not own as apology that's right why this no no no listen I've preaching to the people listen there's a time when you go to school whether homeschooling or public schooling or what they call it religious school or whichever School you call it Mission School or whatever there's a Time the teacher will give us lectures or teach you explain this if you have a question say yes please I need explanation and and then it will be explained to you what what is this they will explain it to you the lecturer gives lectures here and there but there is a time when the lecturer don't speak again the teacher don't speak again the teacher don't explain nothing again you said when test when you are being tested teacher don't speak in the exam call or you don't say please I want explanation put your hand down the teacher that will be smiling with you at a point it doesn't smile again you try to smile with you it doesn't even look at your face why it is test examination when God is testing you sometime the Devil comes to you and he tell you but you have been praying for long why is it that God is not answering your prayer why is this and that yes God is not answering because he's testing you right amen that's right when he was testing Abraham he didn't speak to Abraham he only said take your son and go and sacrifice him for me he has to work for three days three days not driving on the super highways uh 75 south or 95 is whatever there was nothing like that his de jungles passing with that have grown taller than them because remember we are talking about how many years back over 3,000 years back amen right and he has to take his son alone Walking with God walking through maybe stumble and4 and Isa carrying firewood and where are we going I remember one time I was in seron and I walk over 20 miles and I asked the brother brother have we not reach he said brother be patient I was almost crying because it was not motorable you cannot use a bicycle oh I'm sorry bro thank you you could not even use a bicycle and then some plac we have to roll our Tres and take off our shoe because we have to go through water and then we get to a village we say greet the people there so I would realize say we have ready then we start brother let we go no more go again and all I was questioning myself how am I going to return return over 20 miles walking this about 19991 somewhere there early 90s there in and there was war in the country you from Africa West Africa knows they was fighting and and and the mountains they call it you know means lion mountains and they thought we come to what have if Li come from this place and it was Battle for me if a lion I said if anything will happen to me here who will help us there is no way out and we go and the brother said brother let's go I was almost crying on the way Abraham and Isaac work for three days how many miles they covered just one church service to sacrifice to God abrah said I am my soul we are going to worship God amen amen he didn't complain he knew God has spoken and God's word must be obeyed God didn't explain to him God did not tell him I am testing you no the word just came to him and early in the morning he started he didn't even tell Sarah if you had told Sarah it will not have work that old mama would have told Abraham M sir I beg you me I finish my life take me and sacrifice me I will not never allow you to take my song you know how many I suffered you know how many reproaches I went through you know the difficulties I went you will take this man from me then you better kill me amen amen I'm telling you put yourself in that woman show so when God spoke to the heart of Abraham he took it yes he kept that Revelation he didn't ask for any man's opinion imagine if Abraham had had for an opinion from any of his friends any of the church people any of the sisters and brothers this is what I feel that I show something is telling me that I should take Isaac to go and sacrifice what do you think oh what is that is the devil I rebuke it in Jesus name amen that fellow would have rebuked it it cannot be God but Abraham knew it was God Amen he knew the voice of God he has been with God has walk with God and he know the way God does his things so he does not need any man's opinion or what anybody think about it or what anybody says about it and when God speaks to your heart you don't need my opinion you don't need anybody's idea God has spoken somebody told the prophet oh if I can see vision of the Lord said this is the vision book anything you take your bible to read That's Vision this is God Vision book you want Vision before you obey the
