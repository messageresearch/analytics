Nigeria this uh uh morning over in France so we pray that the Lord will grant our brother a safe travel praise the Lord Brother Steven aaro and uh one that is very familiar to us here uh I called this morning and wanted me to send greetings to the church and I was speaking with brother brother brother Stanley brother Stephen and Stanley they they came from way back I was speaking with brother Stanley in the week he wanted me to bring greetings brother ler ader also spoke to him he also want me to bring greetings and just many of them and it's hard to just remember this week on Wednesday night uh brother Paul over there from uh uh uh bridport he said with brother Simon Peter he will be with us he will speak Wednesday night and then uh will speak on Sunday morning normally we will have a weekend service for our Memorial day but not this year not this year and and uh uh uh and and uh um even uh uh July July about the second or third week we normally we have uh a weekend service for uh um our church uh anniversary meetings we've been doing that since we came back from coov because uh uh that was some of the reason why we broke down the walls and did all of this just to be able to to to honor the church for being here all of these years so uh but this year what we will do instead of having the weekend service we'll have a praise night and that's what we will do with brother young that will be coming from Tennessee be coming with his wife hoping to come with with one of his sister that's brother Bill Young's brother this brother was uh he was a 10 evangelist many years back uh in the early 80s 70s and 80s he was a preacher carrying tents around the US speaking but then after the while he got off the field and then uh uh he went into using the inspiration of preaching now he's using that inspiration to write Psalms he wrote over 200 Psalms uh right from the message of the hour and uh uh um his songs were were very very uh inspirational and and comfort to me when I when I heard them back back uh back in the early late 90s early 2000 uh uh someone gave me a copy of his songs and they were really a blessing and uh uh there's one song he sang few of them we sing here all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom he wrote that song and uh I want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word he wrote that song and uh uh and one song he wrote that uh uh uh is that song uh uh I used to like this song because of uh uh the missionary spirit that was for me uh he says uh uh let's carry the word wherever he sent he says uh we all he says maybe the last one is right in your backyard you don't have to go to Puerto Rico you don't have to go to Mexico there might be your neighbor could be the last seed and that was very blessing so we'll have him here in July and uh and then he'll be doing a Saturday night singing for us just like we did the last time with brother Christin from from uh London so uh uh and then Sunday morning do couple of songs and then we will preach or have someone preach and then uh that would be what we want to do for our church anniversary weekend and uh so this morning we want to bring a praise report just like I said brother Joel Pasco in Wisconsin uh Pastor there with uh the little group there uh Clintonville uh his uh his his daughter um uh we've been praying for her she had that uh bone Mar transplant and uh last week uh I think last week to the beginning of this week uh she was she was kind of they did the transplant already and her body was trying to adjust to it but a whole lot was going on she was vomiting in all there very weak but early this morning he sent a text message that his daughter uh nil if I'm right is up 500 and the white blood cells are beginning to to become productive amen so he want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord and [Applause] uh praise the Lord for that and uh uh yesterday we spoke with brother wand nandes and he and his wife like we said they are over uh visiting her parents over in Japan you want us to to keep keep them in prayer too so I I got a hold of him yesterday morning talked to him a little bit and uh uh Becky also travel that's why she's not playing uh well so we we just want to thank the Lord and uh right after service I try try my best I've never preached short before so I can promise you I'll try my best to be able to to to pre up because we have a we have a need that we want to we want to uh uh bring before the church this morning but uh I want it to be an offline uh uh uh uh need so something that we want to pray about so right after right after the service we will come to the end of the service and then uh those that might want to leave for for work or other things you will have you leave and then those that uh uh we will either stay right in here and then or come back few minutes and then we can be able to to bring that need before you and uh uh so with that being said with that being said and as we trust the Lord this morning to be able to help us let's just stand to our feet so we can get to the reading of the word praise the Lord let's just stand to our feet God bless you brother bukari amen I saw you sleeping in there and uh uh there's our our dear brother there from uh from the Fargo area then uh uh he and his wife uh the Train the service whenever they can whenever they are in town they make sure they come down to see us praise the Lord the last time he was traveling back from the from uh from the New York area New Jersey and uh we had some time to sit down and really Fellowship really get to know our brother so uh we want to thank the Lord for Grace upon his life but we will read this morning uh uh St John chapter 20 we take our Bibles and read this morning St John chapter 20 and uh uh couple of weeks back I think a week or two I I I preach on the message the bleeding word I want to do a part two of that we were talking about the blood uh how it's not the the the chemical blood it's not the literal blood uh the blood has become the word amen why it has become the word is because the life is in the blood amen The Life of Christ has come back on his word praise the Lord amen what we call the Holy Ghost is the word of God promis that have come back to the believer as a life so uh uh that's uh that's what we want to address this morning so let's go to to St John chapter 20 let's go to St John chapter 20 uh I was not I was not I I I went into this a little bit when I was away away there in uh uh Tennessee uh speaking there for my my good old friend brother young and just like I said on Wednesday night and we were we were just talking on the blood that speak better things and we were talking about how the word becomes the blood and uh and I mean the Holy Spirit came down in the service and and uh uh it was just awesome to feed the presence of the Lord are we together let's read from uh verse 19 let's read from verse 19 it might it might just be fitting for us it might be fitting for us read from verse 19 St John chapter 20 reading from verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week which is Sunday when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews praise the Lord all of these guys were afraid at the time Jesus was present with them they were talking all over the place praise the Lord but now they are afraid and that's what happen when we don't have the Holy Ghost amen for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst where did he came from the doors were shut that's what the Bible says when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in their mess and said unto them peace be unto you praise the Lord hallelujah if Jesus would do that this morning in a physical body some of us may faint with the door shut he just comes through the wall and say peace be unto you praise the Lord so we realized that he was he was not in uh uh uh uh terrestrial body he was not in this body he was in more of celestial body it's it's another form of body but it's a body it's a body that can be seen but yet is a body that is not uh uh subject to the element of time praise the Lord amen verse 20 and when he have uh said so or so said Peace be unto you he said Peace be unto you and when he has so said he show unto them his hands and his side then where the disciples Glide they were afraid first but now they are glad why because he's with them when they saw the Lord then said Jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father have sent me even so sent are you and when he have said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost are we together he said receive ye the Holy Ghost now you have to realize that this is before Pentecost okay this is before Pentecost but he's breathing on them he breathed on them and he says receive ye the Holy Ghost let's read the next verse down whosoever sin ye remade they are remade it unto them and and whosoever sin ye retain they are retained praise the Lord let's bow our heads and pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just want to thank you this morning and Lord I'm I'm so glad Lord so glad I was I was reminded Lord father that today clock 50 days and and it can just put us in the right mindset Lord father to say thank you thank you Father Lord that we can do a little commemoration of the of the Holy Spirit the promise of the Holy Ghost and you said Lord father to us that oh God the Dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the Holy Ghost that's what we need Lord that's what we need precious Lord we have the mechanics we have the word in in printed form we have it on our phone we have knowledge of the word but we need the Dynamics to come and stract the mechanics Lord we need it oh god father to set our hearts on fire to get us Lord father Shing the things of the word oh God and running to you oh father to kick us out of religion and put us Lord father into the life of Jesus Christ oh God to get us busy Lord father God oh and getting ourself ready cleaning ourself up Lord father oh God for the great translation hour we pray that Lord father you will just come and take your word this morning break it to our hearts oh Father Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you have your seat while we turn to second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 praise the Lord second Timothy chapter 3 and uh they are there but I'm looking for verse 16 2 Timothy chapter 3 if that's where you are I'm looking for verse 16 praise the Lord in second Timothy chapter 3 the Bible says all scriptures all scripture is given by inspiration of God if you remember we spoke on this time back and the reason why I'm coming to this because that word inspiration in the Greek it means the Breath of God are we together amen all scripture is the Breath of God and like I said before God don't have no bad breath amen God don't have bad breath the Bible says and God breathed into the nostril of man and Man became a living Soul praise the Lord so you take it back to what Paul is saying all scripture keep that verse up all scripture is given by the birth of God which means mean every word from the Bible is is the Breath of God so which mean is giving to give life yes when if God breathe in the beginning and his birth make man a living Soul means that every scripture in the Bible is to give life is the Breath of God to give life are we together and because it's the Breath of God Paul says is profitable is profitable for Doctrine and we said Doctrine is what is Right Doctrine is the backbone of the church because the church is not run by our ideas we don't run church about our ideas or our feelings we must bring everything that we are doing back to the scripture if a church does not have a Doctrine is it's it's not a church you don't have nothing that you are standing for praise the Lord so Paul is saying that every scripture that is given to us from the word of God is God's breath and he and he breathed upon us just like we saw in in in in John Chapter 20 The Bible say he appeared to them even before the Holy Ghost before they will have Pentecost he appeared to them peace be unto you that's why he said praise the Lord he moved forward again he said Peace be unto you and the Bible says he breathed upon them praise the Lord without saying nothing to them he just he was doing the very same thing that he did in Genesis 1 or Genesis yeah Genesis uh uh 2 it's in Genesis 2 that he breathed upon man and Man became a living Soul so the same thing that he did in Genesis 2 he's doing it year now in another form because what this time is a spiritual birth that he's giving to the to the to the disciples are we together so Paul is saying all scripture is given by the Breath of God and it's profitable it's profitable are we together every scripture is profitable for Doctrine Doctrine is what is Right amen for Doctrine is profitable for reproof it's profitable for reproof and reproof is what is not right so it's in a sense that every scripture is there to tell us what is right and what is not right what we should do and what we should not do are we together is profitable for Doctrine for reproof and for correction correction is how to get right praise the lord it's good for what is right but if we don't have it right then we need correction to tell us how to get it right because if God will correct us for not doing right and don't tell us how we can get it right praise the Lord that's the difference between punishment and discipline amen punishment you are locked up for the wrong that you are done discipline you are told that this is not right this is the way to do it so every scripture is given for correction how to get it right and also for instruction how to keep it right how to stay right are we together it's good for Doctrine Doctrine is what is right what we need to stand for what are we build on Jesus said Upon This Rock I will build my church what is the principle why are we here are we just trying to add to the to the to the uh uh 900 plus different churches that are already upon the Earth what are we here are we together but I I I brought this scripture so we can be able to get an Insight on what uh Jesus was doing there to the disciples the Bible says he breathed upon them and he says unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost praise the Lord amen he says receive ye the Holy Ghost so uh uh uh uh the Holy Ghost is the Breath of God is is the life of God and when we when we started talking on this subject we uh uh we try to establish you know how uh the life is in the blood that's the reason why uh uh in the Old Testament under the sacrifice of bulls and goat they were not supposed to you know uh uh uh temple with the L the blood the blood was offered they had to be pulled you know the priest deal with that and all of that and uh but this morning I want to go I want to go in the direction here hoping and just trusting that the Lord will be able to to help me let's just let's read something from the fourth seal we we read this we read this uh when we started uh uh on the subject so we want to read this from the fourth seal the the mysterious rather watch how he does now oppos refuse to repent and and to go back to the original blood word the word becomes blood and flesh praise the Lord this this is all this is all back in the church ages you know there were four h rather when you read in Revelation you the four h R so uh uh and and and we realized that uh these RS uh they were they were power powers of of of the devil that was trying to handle the church they were trying to handle the church from experiencing the literal life of Jesus like we always say Satan don't have a problem if you just want to be reles he does not have a problem if you want to be uh a church member but it's Shak him in his bats if you want to be a Son of God Amen if you want to be a Son of God that take God by his word and be serious on the word of God the devil don't have a place to stand with that amen so uh uh uh bringing this start we we we we we want to uh uh trying to show how the word becomes the Flesh and the blood the the word becomes the Flesh and the blood when when we spoke on that I gave you uh uh we share uh uh Joseph experience in praising praise the Lord amen in most cases when we talk about Joseph being a type of Jesus Christ we look at the two men that were in praison and we say one man got freed and one man died just like Jesus on the cross but but we we realize it was more than dead because it was not only the two men but it was also the Two element that they have one was a baker the bread the other one was a cup Bearer a brocca which is a cup Bearer and he had the wine and both the bread and the wine wine Jesus uses there to represent his life he says take this bread amen and the bread represent his body which was death praise the Lord amen so the baker dying was representing the death of Jesus are we together and the and and the cup Bearer uh being the life was representing the blood of the New Covenant are we together praise the Lord amen you love the Lord amen yeah we thank the Lord for his uh for his grace and and u now so we see here uh uh trying to take take that and and and and and bring that to a place so we can we can see how the word becomes the blood amen now this that we read from St John chapter 20 was after the resurrection but before the death and the burial and the resurrection Jes Jesus will have his last service with the church his last meeting will be the communion service that will be his last service he will have and uh uh uh and and and during that service he will take he would take uh uh a bread an un living bread and he would take uh uh a wine from from the van and then he will bring it and the disciples are looking at him he takes it and then uh uh He blesses it and he says Take and Eat This is my body praise the Lord amen he said Take and Eat This is my body he takes the cup pour the wine and he bless it he says this take drink this is the blood of the New Covenant amen now he's taking the wine like we said we are we are not we are not Catholics to believe that uh the bread is the literal body of Jesus or the wine is the literal blood of Jesus that's not what we believe we believe that that is a representation amen now let's look in the scripture and see why that was important the reason why it was important I read a scripture to you before we go further is that Jesus is trying to to point the church he's trying to point the disciples back to the word praise the Lord he's trying to point the disciples back to the word because in the Old Testament when they come to the Tabernacle and the uh and and they and they offer uh uh uh a lamb the the the high priest put the hand of the the worshipper on the lamb he confessed all his wrong and and and the lme is killed in the place of the worshipper are we together and when the lme is killed what they do is there they take the body of the Lamb they burn it praise the Lord and when they burn it they take the Arches amen they take the arches of the Beast and they come and and they M it with water praise the Lord they take the arches of the red haer and they mix it with water and that water during the service is is sprinkle on the congregation now it's it's a it's a symbol it's a sign that this animer gave his innocent life for for the worshipper amen praise the Lord so just as the animer is innocent the sprinkling of the water water represent pardon and and and innocent that the wrong that you have done has been placed under the blood now you are free to go you are innocent are we together so the the the the sprinkling so now Jesus now he's he's bringing his disciples to the place to realize that in few hours because it was it was the the the night before he was arrested in few hours he's going to be giving his life praise the Lord he's going to be giving his life he's going to die on the cross of Calvary he will be nailed he will be pierced in the side and all of that but yet I was I was speaking there in uh uh uh uh Tennessee I said Jesus never told him I'm going to die you'll gather all the buckets and all the gall that you can get and Y go and meet me on calary when that Blood start pouring youall put the bucket there and take as much as you can praise the Lord but he's going to take a representation amen and said this wine represent the blood of the New Covenant are we together so now the representation is now going to be greater than his lital blood because the representation is going to stay with the church or alone are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord let's look over here in Hebrew chapter 13 maybe Hebrew chapter 13 will help us to to be able to go further with that oh God help me this morning I need your help amen I need your help this morning Hebrews chapter 13 you read Hebrews chapter 10 chapter chapter 9 and 10 you would see where Paul was talking about the sprinkling but Hebrew chapter 13 amen now let's read verse 20 Hebrew 13 reading verse 20 list now see how the Apostle Paul speaking to the Jewish church here he he will uh uh bring it out he says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the Sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant now what was the blood of the Everlasting Covenant was it the literal blood that was shared or was it the representation because Jesus says take drink this is the blood of the New Testament the blood of the New Testament is the blood of the Everlasting Covenant why because the blood of the New Testament that word testament is the same as Covenant amen a a a a it override the old Covenant the New Covenant when a New Covenant is brought in the old Covenant is done away with praise the Lord so you see Paul is saying here that that that that that Jesus raised from the dead on the promise of the blood of the New Covenant are we together so he said now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting cover them make you perfect in every good works to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing so what is that working in us what is that fulfilling that praise the lord we realize that it is not just uh it is not just uh uh uh uh you know the the the the old doing or just the the physical blood but it is the spiritual is the spiritual effect of the blood is the word that is that is working in US Amen to make us perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight praise the Lord amen we took another one also and and and that one is is one that is that is very common to to every one of us we just want to do a little review here let's go back to first John chapter 1 1 John chapter 1 John bring it out more clearly here first John chapter 1 amen 1 John chapter 1 we will just read from verse six we actually want to read verse S but let's read verse six quickly if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth verse seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleans us from all sin so again Paul is making us to see our connection with the blood is our walking in the light amen as we walk in the light of God's word that is our access to the blood and the Very easier way to to be able to see it it is the same provision that God Made For Adam and Eve when when when when the broke God's word the Bible says he killed a lamb in the East of Eden and and he brought it because there is no way that a holy God praise the Lord amen I was reading some something and uh where one time uh uh uh uh I think there socr he says he says I do not see how a holy God can reconcile a sinful man he says I believe it but I do not see it because because there has to be a meeting Ground God in his holiness there is no way we in our sinful nature can come unless there is a meeting ground praise the Lord amen and that is the same provision that God made he took he took a bleeding lamb and went after and went after H H Adam and Eve and went after Adam Adam where are you praise the Lord like a like I normally said God knew where Adam was it's just that Adam never knew where he was amen God was not asking the question in the sense that he don't know where Adam was he knew exactly where Adam was but Adam never knew where he was praise the Lord for the fact that he was not at the place that God placed him amen he was hiding behind a fake Lea when God has set him to the place of dominion and ruler over the Earth praise the Lord hallelujah so so so when when when God coming to look for Adam there is the holy God that is coming to find a sinful man he brought a provision of a bleeding skin praise the Lord because God will only meet us through the blood it has to be through the blood so God coming to look for Adam he brought the bleeding skin and when you read there in Genesis the Bible says he robbed Adam and Eve took up their fi leaf and he wrapped them up in the bleeding skin and in that way he sent them from his presence the blood now now h h h mediate between God and man praise the Lord So Adam and his wife was walking away from the presence of God with blood dripping down it became like a constant at me praise the Lord so now God will do the same for you and myself this time it would not be a fresh bleeding skin but it would be his word that's the reason why John said if we walk walk in the light just like Adam walking with the ship skin W around him if you are walking with the word r around you then you have access to the blood are we together praise the Lord if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin I was I was thinking about something uh during the week and uh we would let's let we would do we would quickly do a run through and be able to and look out there this morning I I pray that it will get our attention just like it did God m in the days of Noah the Bible says God saw that men were evil amen God saw that men the imagination of of of men thoughts was evil and he was coming down to George the word but there is a statement there where the Bible says that no flesh will be saved amen and it it is not the one that struck me more more High the one that struck me is that because of the evil that was upon the Earth the Bible says the spirit of God will not strive with men amen the spirit of God will now strive with men because his imagination was evil continuously are we together amen look at this Paradox that H uh almighty God spirit will not will not will not come close to a man who IM imagination is evil in that time think about that now look at the Paradox years hundreds of years after the prophet Jo will prophesy that I will pour out my spirit upon praise the Lord if you know what the scripture is let's say it don't be afraid Jo proph prophesy that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh you see the Paradox glory be to God I will tell you I will show you why that is a paradox in Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 Jeremiah chapter 17 ver9 is a very familiar verse if you don't know it by heart if you get there you will know that you know it it's just that you didn't know the verse the Bible says that the heart of man amen Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9 the Bible says that the heart of man is desperately wicked glory be to God Amen the heart of man is is is deceitful above all and desperately wicked who can know it now if you if you look at that word carefully I think sometime back I I read that to you it means me that the heart of man is incurable the heart of man is incurable that is the defect of the Fall the heart of man is incurable now a person can have a heart attack people goes to the hospital they do Heart bass that is just the muscle of your heart they are repairing for the blood flow it's not the heart that the Bible is talking about it's just the muscle of your heart the one that you have in you is the muscle for your blood flow there are four vibes your heart have four Vibes where the blood flow in and out of your heart to go through all your body that the doctor will be able to repair praise the Lord but the heart that is deceitful praise the Lord there are sense of the heart heart that is called the spirit man that is called your mind praise the Lord that is deceitful and the Bible says is desperately wicked who can know it amen it is it is like I said it's it's a defect from the fall when man fell from God that heart of man was was was affected with with with a sense of weakness that sometime a man can be so wicked to himself praise the Lord he can be so wicked to himself now you will see that is the reason why when you look in the Bible also in Ezekiel chapter 36 God promised that I will give you a new heart why because the old heart that we are born with is incurable praise the Lord there is there is no form of church going or religion that can change a man's heart until God gave you a new heart praise the Lord and and and what makes it very striking here when you look in the scripture here is joah that is prophesying that I will pour my spirit upon All Flesh it's a very dangerous thing when the spirit of God comes upon an unconverted heart praise the Lord when a man has a man or a woman you know every man born of a woman has the spirit of God on a on converted heart is the most dangerous thing that the word can ever have praise the Lord because that man has the spirit of God he can preach he can sink and and and and I mean he can he can get in the spirit and speak tongues and all of that but if his heart is converted praise the Lord that very man that looks like an anointed preacher can be one of the most evil men praise the Lord with a crural heart he can molest his own family he can abuse his family all in the form of religion so you see the prophecy of joed we have see we see the Pentecostal Church run with that oh that God said he will pour His Spirit on on All Flesh and and and right in there you see them you know all in the spirit prophesying and and and and their very appearance is a disobedient to God and all of these people you know what they are dealing with things fing with one another and all of that but they can come to the place and speak in tongues and you know and it's it's a very dangerous thing when the spirit of God get on an unconverted heart few weeks ago brother Lord preached a message where he was talking about Saul and the Bible says a saw among the prophets why because Saul prophesied but when it came to the place for Saul to do what the prophet Samuel told him to do he never had the heart to do it he had the spirit of God on him he could go among the prophets and prophesy and do all of that but the heart was not converted and because his heart was not converted he will argue with Samuel he would disobey Samuel and he he will even get an evil spirit a man that can get in the spirit and prophesy will yet take a javing to struck David to the war that's how the human heart is desperately wicked the Bible says no man can know it we have a generation that say follow your heart you don't know your heart don't follow it what you call follow your heart is just follow your your your desires and that that's why God will promise that I will give you a new heart he says and I will put a new spirit in you and then I will come and give you my spirit praise the lord we living in an age we're in a time where people want the church to adopt their lifestyle we don't want to do we don't want to follow the the the the scripture other looks old faction but we want the church to adopt our lifestyle now let me ask you which one will we follow praise the Lord because every one of all we like we have what we like and we have what we don't like what you like might not be what I like praise the Lord so we having problem there how can we adopt yours and leave mine out praise the Lord if the church is to adopt our lifestyle you see that's the reason why it will never works it's not going to work because God never promised Jesus never says I will build my church upon your lifestyle right no that's not what he says he says I will I will build my church Upon This Rock which is the revelation of Jesus Christ and the gifts of Hell will not Prevail against it praise the Lord that's that that is the time that we are in people we are living in such a time where all of these things is becoming a pressure on the church and because we want to keep the church door open so it looks like we must come on pressure we don't want to lose this person so they can they can bring their loose life and and then yeah we must accept it we don't want to lose this other person they can bring I mean whether the what they want to live in h h a polygamous life and have many why we must accept it because we we must keep the church the church will never survive on that it will never survive on that God that ordained his church he knows how to sustain his church the problem there is because we think church is the four walls no church is not the four walls it's not the four wall church and men and women that have given their life and ready to live a Godly life that's what the church is I'm so glad that Jesus make it so easy for me he said wheresoever two or three that's what he said praise the Lord so if I can find two or three that is ready to stand upon the word I said come let's have church praise the Lord amen church is is is classified the moment you tell somebody oh I'm a preacher how how many members do you have praise the Lord how many members do you have oh yeah we can have the thousands if we just step up the standard come as you are will not have C praise the Lord but you see what what actually is going to be is that we're just going to start another Tower of Babel praise the Lord because everybody will come with their own confusion their own argument right that's not the way I see it that I I don't believe it that way may God help us we try to stay truth to this word in the best that we know how to glory be to God Amen it has always been the problem All Through the Ages All Through the Ages it has always been the problem let me share this with you God keep his word now if you notice what caused this trouble which trouble it was that was with Moses in his exitor what caused Moses trouble there was a Mis multitude that went up with them the supernatural has been done down in Egypt and when the supernatural has been done everybody flocks in you see that's the reason why we having a generation that is that is a sound seeking generation because the moment that we can we can fake prophecy or we can fake healing go and pay somebody money and say well you walk on crutches come in church we'll pray for you and and and so it can show that we can heal the sick that's the kind of a generation that we living in Praise the Lord before we realize everybody's coming oh that that church down there they can pray for people when the supernatural is done people flock after it they are not coming for the god that do does the supernatural amen they are not coming because the identify that God is in the midst of the people no that's not where they are coming praise the Lord because now it's going to be theater just sit sit and see the men of God watch see the men of God it become a show thing now there is somebody here somebody you had a headache last night don't worry God is God is going it has just become a shamble praise the Lord it become a theater people sit in the audience and ready now to witness some kind of a clown on the pit but where is the life where is the life how can the church clean the blood without the life what was the blood sheare for praise the Lord what was the blood she for glory be to God how would you get it we have a defying age this age is defying the church Jesus said I will have a church without spot to wrinkle this age is saying no way praise the Lord no way we are going to uh h h h there there Revelation letter us to know there are 2 million demons that have been poured out around the church and and and we cannot say that we have 2 million people standing pure and clean with the word so the church having more power that is that is Waring against it even though we can say like gaha and and and Elijah there is more with us than them that are against us praise the Lord but the fact about the matter there is that we have lot of things that is Waring against the church that is trying to make the word of God of non effect it's not a problem if we just come and and and sing to the songs dance with the music and just give you some Bible story and go home but where is The Life of Christ asaiah said when the spirit of the Lord H H Spirit of the enemy come as a flood God will raise up a standard and I believe there are seen God is still here today no matter what we are dealing with God is able to raise up a standard in the life of our young people he's able to raise up a standard in our homes he's able to raise up a standard in a church that will keep it set by the word of God hallelujah it's dangerous glory be to God because we are in a defining age with everything that has been preached with everything that have been taught the people still find excuses to adopt new things in their life praise the Lord they feed from Hollywood they want to look pretty they do everything and then at the end of it the church is now burden with prayer request I was following a uh h h a young lady there you know and and uh uh down in one group there in South Africa got into all of these uh uh uh chemical body changing thing praise the lord it's God that that make the pigment of our body praise the Lord glory be to God and now she's dealing with body cancer praise the Lord why because she wanted to be pretty if he wanted to make you h h h white or whatever color you want he will have brought you that way with everything that has been taught the church always go find something new thing to adopt are we together we always try to go and find new things to ad door new form of life when we have a word that is given to us that we need to strive for praise the Lord glory be to God I was looking at something something I read last week I believe not many of you caught it because the reason why I said it is because it struck me myself I never I never saw it until I read it last week but I didn't comment on it let's go back to to uh Matthew I mean Malachi chapter 2 amen we use the scripture I'm a big believer in this scripture amen I'm a very big believer in this scripture if you read Malachi chapter 2 you will see where Malachi was was bringing he was dealing with Israel in in in an elective love relationship with Jehovah he says uh uh God telling Israel I love you you he says you are saying to me how do I love you I prove it to you just like Esau was uh Jacob brother and I said I love Esau more than Jacob praise the Lord so God was dealing with Israel in an elective law if you come down to chapter two he's talking to Israel and and and he's getting he's getting Israel in a kind of a romantic form and he says well remember the wife of your youth he said Israel I deal with you when you were just a little handful of people in in Egypt it was not because of your size I love you because I promised your father Abraham amen God told Abraham that he would become you know uh blessing like the stars of Heaven the the Sand by the seashore God gave him the blessing before even Abraham had a child are we together but y say he's dealing with Israel now and he uses this word chapter 2 verse 16 the Bible says for the Lord the god of Israel said that he hateth putting away now that word putting the way you look in different version it brings out divorce okay God is saying I hait divorce now I would read another scripture to you that will hit your mind just like it hit me praise the Lord amen God is saying saying I hate divorce and we have used like I said I'm a very big believer of that I'm very big believer of there we have we have used the scripture over and over to show how uh you know divorce is not an option but let's go to Leviticus chapter 22 Leviticus chapter 22 amen glory be to God I'm going to get in trouble but as my life has been I've always been in trouble amen I've always been in trouble I've always been in trouble Leviticus chapter 22 we were reading uh last week and talking about the Widow and and how the priest is you know he takes care of the Widow he takes care of the fatherless and uh the offerings and and and all of that we were reading about that so we read this scripture last week 22 verse 13 the Bible says but if the priest's daughter be a widow which mean her husband DED or all divorce watch now in as much as God expressed to Israel and putting his word I hate putting the way I hate divorce God make provision for divorce I will tell you why let's read a little bit but if the priest's daughter be a widow all divorced and have no child and is returned onto her father's house as in her youth now this was the scripture that I read and I pointed to Hannah Anna not Hannah but Anna that was in the temple when Jesus was dedicated the Bible say uh uh uh uh her hus die and then she she she kept herself from 17 years old until she became an old woman now that was the scripture I was referring to because she was in the temple so which means she was sustained by the temple now the Bible yet is making us to to realize that if a priest daughter be a widow or divorc and have no child and his returned to her father house as in her youth so so shall he so no she shall eat of her father's meat but there shall be no stranger eat thereof praise the Lord now the reason why I brought this up is to is to let us to know that in as much as God hate divorce God hait abuse praise the Lord amen in as much as God hate divorce he hate put in the way God frown at abuse but he makes provision for one that is put away and in most cases the one that is put away has been abused because if you look back in the Old Testament the reason why the belt of divorcement was given Jesus said is because of the hardiness the hardiness of the heart which mean there were men that were so crural yes praise the Lord they took their wives as warp paper why because they were under the law of polygamy they have more than one wife more than two more than three so they could love this one and and if you dare do anything to me you will stay right there you will care for yourself you will do everything for yourself there was a lot of abuse that was done why because the man says I am the man so in as much as God ha divorce he frown at abuse he frown more at abuse you know why because the first daughter of God if she was abused God first daughter was abused he will make provision year for the woman that is put away glory be to God hallelujah the Bible says under the Old Testament if you really study the story you will realize that just like the daughters of zarapa had to go to Moses to obtain an instruction how they would get inheritance for their fathers that's the reason that's that was the same way many fathers many others went to Moses and say how can we deal with this Moses had to go on the mountain to seek the face of God to bring a solution why because hon the lord of polyam the woman the man had 10 wives but all the woman are obedient to him so if she's ill treated she can't go anywhere she become like a property to the man it's now under the New Covenant praise the Lord our wives are not our property amen they are not our property and that's the reason why I'm saying there I mean we we have a generation that want us to adopt their their lifestyle thank you praise the Lord now so but what I'm getting to yet is that I just I just dropped that one in for the reason I'll come back to it what I'm getting to here is that uh uh we we we talking about the bleeding word how the word bleeds for us amen the word has has has lost his life on us when we sit under the preaching of the word we are sitting under the sprinkling of the blood Paul who says in Hebrew he said just like the Old Testament instrument was sprinkled seven times so God did honor the seven Church ages to be able to bring the pure word and and and and preach it on the people through the messenger Paul and all the messenger Through the Ages God brought a pure truth when Luther came out with the judge shall live by faith it was a pure truth and those that believe that word they were Sanctified by that word are we together glory be to God but we see here with this Paradox it's a dangerous thing a dangerous thing when uh when when an unconverted heart is Anointed by the spirit of God praise the Lord you go back to uh uh uh uh first king chapter 19 Elijah on the mountain and God said what Dost thou yeah Elijah praise the Lord he say I'm the only one left God said no I have 7,000 that have not bowed down to B but let me tell you what you're going to do for me go and anoint Asel go and anoint jeu go and anoint Elisha now God was Distributing the anointing of Elijah on AEL he he's the one that will bring the world against uh uh uh Ahab he will later become the Syrian King so God put an anointing of elij to deal with the political system jood will be the one that will destroy all the prophets of B another anointing of Elijah to deal with the religious system praise the Lord he has the political system covered he has the religious system covered then the anointing on Elisha praise the lord we have the bride cover amen the anointing on Elisha will have the church cover because once again there will be a people that would say where is the god of Elijah glory be to God but if you read the story and you go on you will realize that Elijah never anointed AER he never anointed jeu the only person he anointed was elishah he throw his metal on Elisha and Elija burned all his tools and then he went with Elijah but it will be elishah that would do the finished work of Elijah so this bride is here to do the finished work of the messenger the messenger is not coming back again it is our duty praise the Lord so elishah will be the one to anoint jeu amen if you remember that in the story juu was anointed he got on his cherub and he started running and and and and another guy saw him and says that person coming looks like jum he got there he he got over there and got all the worshippers of by he says is there any worshiper bar they say yeah we are there he said you're getting let's worship bar we will worship bar like nobody has worship by he put every one of them in the house praise the Lord and He armed men with sword he said Mark all the doors if one of these Soul Le your life will be given he killed the prophets of B he his anointing was to deal with the religious system praise the Lord Elijah was the one that anointed Azar he was a young man he was just a young boy Elisha when he took he took the anointing oh where where is mine they were talking he took the oil and he broke the bottle and just wasted over him when Elijah wasted the anointing oil on him elishah started to cry the Bible said he started to cry he says I seen the evil that you will do to the daughters of Israel I see how you will smash their babies on the wall and you will rape their women he said am I a dog am I a dog for me to be so wicked he never knew what the anointing would do to his uncon converted spirit the anointing on we have a rebellious generation why because the the message of the hour is the anointing of this age you can sit under the message and and and and and become terrible because you think you know the word you can argue with the preacher but there is no conviction in the heart he started crying he said am I evil that I will do this Elijah never said one word to him but when that time God ready he was the one that brought a war against Israel he was anointed because God said that that that the dogs will eat the Flesh of Ahab just like it did over to the prophets when that anointing got a hold of him he he never even remember there a Prophet prophesy over here praise the lord it's dangerous to profess the things of God without a new birth without a new birth without a regeneration in our hearts we will hold this Bible in our hands and do wickedness even to ourself we will hold this word in our hands and seal our conscience you will justify everything that you will do thinking that you are doing right it's one o' musicians you can come we will continue just like I said we want to have a prayer meeting right after the service there's a need that we want to pray for so uh I will stop right here and sing that song change my heart oh God is Not cleans my heart the heart must be changed it's not it's not cleans my heart we can
