========================================
[Music] all right to finish the transgressions to finish what to finish israel's transgression what is a transgress is to go against something a transgress against me is to do a wrong to me transgress against you is doing wrong to you so israel did a wrong to god and in this 70th week what's going to happen god is going to finish the transgression of israel amen finish the transgression we'll be turning away the ungodliness of jacob amen all israel will be born again [Music] all of them will receive the holy spirit now number two write that down on your paper we just stay a long time on that but i don't want to go to preaching on it i just want to talk to you so that you can get us down close when we get into these seven seals and you'll just move right on to the church through the seals through the flags and know where we're standing amen all right number two make an end of sins now let's read again daniel to finish transgressions and and make an end of sins that's the second purpose of coming first is to finish israel's transgression and to make an end of sins where did israel sin where did they do their vital sin where did they separate themselves from god now listen close let's turn to saint matthew 24 and here's where israel made her fatal mistake here's where she's done her life sin and the reason she's in the condition today matthew the 27th chapter of saint matthew's gospel and the 25th verse of the 27th chapter let's begin about the uh uh the 21st verse the governor answered and said unto them whether all these twain will ye that i release unto you and they said barabbas now remember that's israel barabbas pilate said unto them what shall i do with jesus which is called christ listen adam they all said unto him let him be crucified remember that's their messiah that daniel said would come remember this morning in the lesson here you'll be cut off not for himself not nothing he did let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil has he done but they cried out some more saying let him be crucified then pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather a tunnel was made and he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it listen here's your mistake here's your sin then answered the people and said his blood be on us and on our children [Music] he was making it in the sin for them how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing that he had to blind their eyes that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded and he knew they were blind that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive them father father they don't know what they were doing they were blind for our sake they were made blind in their unbelief they did this but when they see him again amen amen putting me into sin what is sin unbelievable they did not believe that was a messiah they could not see him to be messiah yeah he thought every sign the messiah was supposed to do but they could not see it they were blind so when you see people say i don't believe anybody i can't see it i can't see this baptist the holy ghost don't be angry with them they are blind they say i can't see this message of him coming i can't see this baptism the holy spirit i can't see the serpent see i can't see this stuff they're blind i don't know him just pray for them all right in their unbelief but when they see him when he comes again it will make an end of their unbelief oh my let's just turn first to genesis the 25th the 45th chapter and get a type of it i got wrote down here some genesis 45 you just taking down the notes oh how i love this good old gospel all right now we know where we're at can you hear me all right back to the building say raise up your hand if you can hear me i got this sitting a little close now we're going to read a portion of this scripture i want you to listen to you that don't have your bible you that have your bible get genesis first let's start in the 44th chapter beginning with the 27th verse it's joseph and joseph was a perfect type of christ we know that how many knows that hated of his brother's why because he was spiritual and saw visions interpret dreams he was a spiritual man among his brethren and they hated him and his father loved him so jesus hated all the denominational churches but loved of his father god why did the him because he was spiritual amen because they told they said he was a fortune teller a devil you remember what joseph's brother said to him here comes that dreamer these same things and they sold joseph for almost the same price that judah sold jesus for 30 pieces of silver thrown him into a ditch and went and told the father that something killed him he was dead but he was taken up from the ditch christ was thrown into a ditch and was taken up and from there he went to the highest place there was on earth amen amen joseph went to the right hand of pharaoh and jesus went to the right hand of god [Applause] in his temptation before his exaltation jesus before he was exalted went through temptation why i believe this billy sunday the great advances said every every tree had a million angels sitting in it that day of the crucifixion said just pull your hand loose and point to us we'll change this scene around here but he couldn't do it carefully said he saved himself others he cannot save he didn't always find a comment if he saved himself he couldn't save others so he gave himself to save us he saw blind from it now they then when he was there in his exaltation or before his exaltation his temptation remember joseph was put into prison because he was innocent the aroma of the israelite general by the name of pharmacy prophecy went and went away on a trip he had a pretty wine and his wife had joseph come into the house to do something and he tried to get joseph to do something wrong and he was loyal to god i'll tell you there always you women out hard at you 9 will take up for you a minute the woman is a weaker vessel i know there can't be a bad man for he's a bad woman but man who knows that man who knows that you are a son of god and take advantage of a woman shame on you no matter what she does she's a weaker vessel you know then if she goes to acting i'm ladylike take her to the hand and talk to her like a sister you're a son of god don't do them evil things look at joseph he was an example to you and when timeless wife this beautiful woman honorable hires one of the highest women there was in the country begged him and persuaded him and he turned and she caught him and tried to hug him up to her and he jerked till he pulled his coat off and run from him amen yes sir i want to come into toll alone said he come in to ravish her and she left his and he left his coat there and for that he went to the dungeon but in the dungeon god was with him no matter where he put him he was a type of the son of prosperity everything joseph done prospered and when jesus returns to the millennium that's the reason that deserts will blossom as a rose everything he does will prosper he's the son of prosperity where are you but joseph it was blessed wherever jesus says it's blessed so get him in your heart be blessed so we find out that joseph then was put into a prison and in the prison there were two men one of them was lost and one was saved jesus in his temptation on the cross one thief was lost and the other insane when he was exalted he went to the right hand of god when joseph was exalted he went to right hand of pharaoh and no man could speak to pharaoh without speaking to joseph person getting permission and when joseph left the palace oh my when joseph left the palace trumpet sounded and man right ahead of him saying bow and e joseph is coming amen and when jesus leaves [Applause] and remember when he was rejected of his brethren what did he do he got a gentile life he got an egyptian wife when jesus was cut off from his brethren back here the jews he married a gentile bride [Music] [Applause] but now after years after children have been born he's from manassas he had a family then one day his brethren come to visit him watch we know the story how he put the little thing in there stand back and act like he couldn't even speak their language had an interpreter for the hebrew when he was a hebrew himself and her brother come down they didn't know him he was a mighty prince and right now christ visits the jews heels are sick and stuff and they still don't know who he is amen that messiah let's begin 27 verses 44th chapter and thy servant my father said unto us you know that my life bear me my wife bear me two sons and one of them went out from me that was joseph the very one they were talking to and i said surely he is torn to pieces and i saw him not sense and if you take this also from me and mischief befall him you shall bring down my great hairs with sorrow to the grave they had a little benjamin down there his little brother you know who benjamin represents this new bunch of real genuine jews is getting there now to make that 144 thousand this this race is coming up amen not these wall street crooks no no that's more cannon fodder that made jews that made jews the real jews are these little benjamins coming up down here they never even heard the word of jesus christ now therefore come unto me and thy father and my father and the lord be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life god's own life is bound with israel he's married to her we're going to get to that in a few minutes if the lord willing amen he's married to israel his life is bound to her just as i'm bound in the spring i'm back there my wife and you're bound to your wife your life is wrapped in it and god is married to israel amen and what was it jacob said my life is wrapped and bound in this child i shall and it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad is not with us joseph is going to keep the lads you know we know the story and that he will die his daddy and thy servant shall bring down the great hairs of our servant our father with sorrow to the grave look at that plea that reuben's given now for thy servant becomes surety that's a lad unto thy unto my father saying if i bring doc bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the land oh my see he's standing right before joseph his brother this is joseph and he don't know him oh wait till that millennium starts brother [Music] uh instead of the lad a bondsman to my lord listen and confess him lord and let the lord go up with his brethren for how shall i go up to my father and the lord be not with me lest preventure i see the evil that shall become of my father pleading giving his own life how them jews will stand there with their hands up watch what's now the 45th verse listen close don't miss it when joseph could then joseph could not frame and refrain himself before all them that stood with him brother that's when sin is going to be made into the unbelief is going to scatter and he cried and caused every man to go from him and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known to his brother what is it even his own wife went back to the palace oh my the bride in glory while jesus returns we'll get into it here amen to make himself known and he wept aloud joseph just couldn't hold it any longer he screamed out and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard it plum back over into the palace they heard joseph screaming and that was a type of christ meeting the jews that he knows he blinded them so that we can have a chance but when he comes to them again sin of israel will be over and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph what do you think jesus will say i am your messiah i am the one that you crucified does my father yet live and his brothers could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence oh i got to stop here just a minute let's turn over to zechariah the 12th chapter turn with me now to the book of zachariah the 12th chapter of zechariah and maybe i'm taking a little too much time and starting preaching on this but i i hope not and i i want you to get it so bad zachariah let's get to 12th chapter of zechariah and see what he's going to say now when he's standing before his brethren zechariah 12 and the 10th making me into sin now all right 12 chapter and 10th verse notice and i speaking here of the raymond the siege of jerusalem the beast and the armies just tuck away and so forth all things have become to the end now this is almost to the millennium fix and start the millennium right now and i will pour up on the house of david at upon inhabitations of jerusalem the spirit of what grace [Applause] upon the house inhabitants of jerusalem daniel's holy city the spirit of grace and our supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn listen tomorrow morning that will be when he stand there making himself known to them right joseph did listen and if that day shall there be such great morning in jerusalem as the morning of i can't pronounce that name h-a-d-d-a-d-r-i-m-o-hedraman in media and in the land shall be mourning every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart and the family of the house of nathan apart and their families apart the house of levi and their wives and families apart to see me and theirs apart and all the families that remain every family and their wives apart they'll be so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see that that very one that they crucified in the night standing there their own precious joseph there will be such mourning and they'll say where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends oh amen you know what i mean to make an end of sin of unbelief that's what he's coming for amen and this 70th year of daniel 70th wheat brother coming and making the end of sin put it away you understand now what's the first to finish the transgression to make an end of sin number three to make reconciliations for iniquity use writing it down and i had about six other scriptures there but i'll just pass over it because it's hot we don't want to take too much time i won't get as much of it as they can but not told you too long all right [Music] to make reconciliations for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliations but it will not be applied to them it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it am i and why did they blind you say well maybe today because i'm blind you're willfully blind they were blind because god blinded him that you're blind because you're wealthy blind there's no reconciliation for you if you believe not i am he said jesus you'll die in your sins that's right now let's turn back to zechariah again the 13th chapter now let's listen here make reconciliation uh this i was looking for someone here to hear this but maybe the lord will get it someway and that day there shall end that day dr scofield has here in his footnotes or his paragraphs headings the remnant the repented remnant pointed to the cross to make reconciliations for iniquity iniquity is something that you've done wrong that you know better that you ought not have done it am i if i conceive iniquity in my heart god will not hear me now in zechariah the 13th chapter let's begin at the first at the first verse in that day there shall be a fountain opened in the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and uncleansiness there shall be a house open go ahead we can just read it on down i want you to mark that so you will read it but now i've got marked out here to start at the sixth verse and read to the ten all right let's read now and see read through the ninth brother and one shall say to him that were what are these wounds in thy hand then he shall answer those which i have was let's see answered those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends awake o sword against the shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn my hand upon the little ones now jesus quoted that scripture see smite the shepherd and scatter the sheep but notice the next paragraph he just quoted that much of it but watch what the next sentence of it says the next part of it and i will turn my hands to the little ones what the benjamin group that's coming up now [Applause] i will turn my hand to the little ones smite the shepherd israel first israel spoke the shepherd scattered the sheep to all the world but god said i will turn my hands back to get them a new one when reconciliation for iniquity has been made israel will be saved every one of them let's turn to isaiah the uh isaiah the 66th chapter of isaiah and read just for a moment and see what god says about israel being saved how long it will take to save israel watch how quick it will come in isaiah the 66th chapter and the eighth verse if you want to read it all all right who has heard such a thing who has seen such a thing shall the earth be made and bring forth one day in one day for as soon as zion travails she brought forth her children as soon as i saw that that was their messiah she was born again amen in one day make reconciliations for sins and to make a reconciliations for iniquity uncleansiness oh my they did that what was evil that which was wrong reconciliations was made for their iniquity number four to bring in everlasting righteousness that's the fourth uh thing that he come for the fourth uh what he's come to do to bring in everlasting righteousness make an end to sin reconciliation and to bring in everlasting righteousness when israel transgressions had come to an end when israel's transgression now we're going to i want you to catch this because when we bring that woman and the dragon cast out you're going to come right back to this same scripture again be sure to put it down when israel's transgression has come to an end satan who is their accuser and our accuser satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit amen when what when bringing in everlasting righteousness something that cannot end all that cause unrighteousness this will be done away with let's get revelations the 20th chapter the 13th first just a minute and let's read here just a minute revelations 20 and 13. uh no i beg your pardon revelations 1 to three it is i didn't see that little mark between my respiration here it gets in my eyes revelations the 20th chapter and let's see and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the keys to the bottomless pit on a great chain in his hand he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and casting into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nation no more until the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that must be loosed a little season make an everlasting bring in everlasting righteousness satan in the bottomless pits and when he does that and seals up the devil which has deceived the people now let's just turn back to rebecca the second chapter rebecca the second chapter and now we're going to see why he sealed up this old serpent and what it was done for and what takes place immediately after he is sealed up i like this don't you it uh it brings us to a knowledge of some rebecca ibeka the second chapter and the 14th verse i believe it is i want to read when this takes place watch for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge and the glory of the lord as the waters covers the sea hallelujah amen thank you in other words when the enemy has been cut away the end of sin has come the bringing in of everlasting righteousness has come satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit and the knowledge of the lord shall cover the earth as the waters covers the scene amen glory to god it's coming brother [Music] when the knowledge of the lord shall fill the earth and see in the sky oh my heart is growing crying for that day of sweet release when our jesus shall come back to earth again amen all right now the millennium then is on that's when the millennium when the city is to be built for it i heard about six more scriptures but we'll hurry now when we come back i'll pick up these other scriptures but just get you a general idea number five to seal up the vision and prophecy he shall come to seal the vision in prophecy i hate to say this but some great writer that i was reading about today if he didn't have that messed up he said what it was just to show how stupid oh excuse me i don't miss it forgive me i don't mean that i really didn't no uh a man without anointing see the man said you see here that visions and prophecy was always allowed to the jewish church and said from daniel's time on when daniel come it meant that they would have no more vision or no more prophecy that all these things today that they talk about not having visions and prophecy was all a thing of the devil that there was no such a thing as visions and prophecy brother there was dozens of prophets after daniel and there were john the baptist there was jesus christ there was the prophets to the new testament there was angels how in the world can a man say that amen but you see that's what the selfish motive they're trying to push something over on the people to make a little church doctrine a little petty thing to become a reality to the people if the people haven't got the holy ghost they'll be deceived by them now let's not take what some man said now there's not a scripture to prove that so how could i take that well let's find out what really is the ceiling of [Music] so you
