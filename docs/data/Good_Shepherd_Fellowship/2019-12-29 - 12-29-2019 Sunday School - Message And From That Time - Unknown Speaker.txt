========================================
now we are very happy tonight have with us one of our guests share the as we call it the prayer service on New Year's night a good friend of mine brother Ernie fan ler one of the converts to the Lord Jesus Christ trophy of grace originating his home in Switzerland that's where he came from and I believe a brother with him there with her living in Shawano now German by descent a brother waters were happy to have them with us tonight and then we have also with us tonight a precious brother of the faith South Africa brother David Duke listen we're happy to have him with us - and we're David in our are anticipating or praying and Lord to give us some great work together this coming year into Africa and different parts of the world brother David is here now to talk it over and pray over with it between now and Monday to decide just when and where in to to Africa and different parts of the world to go as brother David has had a very prominent office with the Pentecostal world convention and also is well known with many great religious leaders throughout the entire world and it's been very influential in persuading and causing as far along as we are now to help bring the body of Jesus Christ together of all denominations of faith regardless of what they search they have or what they brand their branded it's that the church and who Christ died for him and I've often thought of that used to help round up the cattle many times out west we brother David and set out there where they drove the cattle up to the drift fence up into the mountains to feed them on the let them graze on the pastures the of the forest while the meadows was growing in the bottom wild Medes and then they cut the medes and feed the cattle out through the through the wintertime when there's two split up in the mountains and used to set their on the saddle and watch the Ranger bringing those cattle through in each ranch in the bottom that could raise a ton of hay I think a raise 50 ton of hay that meant they could but 50 cattle if they could raise a thousand ton of hay a thousand head of cattle could go through each man carrying a brand on his cow they watched the brands of course the different branches so they wouldn't get him mixed up and then when the Ranger he wasn't so interested and what kind of brands was going through because there's all kinds of brands but there's one thing and he really had to check that was a blood tag they had to be registered Hereford or they couldn't get through the gate they would turn it back see and I think that's the way it'll be at the judgment they'll not be what kind of brand we're wearing but if the blood tags there that's the thing that'll that'll count the blood tank and I'm very happy to have brother David with us and I'll see brother Estel dealer was here just a moment ago I seen him raised up back there from somewhere and other ministers who were wanting to hear from tonight and then and I guess brother Ruddell and then will be coming in calls her go to state till midnight however brother David can't stay till midnight he's very wanted man everywhere and as soon as brother Rogers heard that he was over here while he's going to stand and have him over there at 10 so that means you'll be leaving here pretty short to get way out there and South Louisville and I thought it would be nice if it would be alright with brother David if if we'd have him to come up and speak what's on his heart each forest do whatever the Lord lays we'd all like to hear brother David do places from South Africa let me say this that when I was in over in Africa and my great campaign the Lord gave us over there his brother was my interpreter brother justice I believe his name is brother justice and a real fine family of people are these Duke Lisi brothers I think is I guess they're all ministers as far as I know uh maybe father - that was the minister and they're from a fine family of people and brother David packs a great name amongst all the churches and denominations around the world and brother David I'd like for you to come up now and speak for us or whatever God's put on your heart to say come right up and I'm very happy to introduce to my church tonight this is brother they are Manorville our pastor and to the church this is one of my precious friends and and fellow warriors and the service of God brother David new places the South African brother David hurry right back and be with us again that's very fine we're sure happy brother David said some things I just wish that I had my pen I could have jot them down but I'll always remember grandsons the grandchildren well we sure appreciate a visit of our brother and he is was the connected with the world Conference of Pentecostal believers and a great man and the line of his work throughout the whole world and we were fortunate tonight to have brother David come speak to us on this New Year's night and you can see what great men think about our long think about his great service now I believe that tomorrow in being new years it's just a few hours now and had to leave early in the morning so I thought I'd just speak a little bit if it's all right little brother Beeler and the other ministry share won't take much the time and I think if we'd say Amen and go home and be a wonderful message and we could be thankful to the Lord for what that we have here tonight and now but this being New Year's night we just entertained each other by the kingdom of God preaching until it comes a new year and I've got to get up in the morning you're here early way before they and I'm not as young as David maybe I maybe I don't feel as young as she does he's a horse David's a little little bit older than I am I think he's separate years older maybe ten but he's a certainly a fireball for God travelling 50,000 miles this year for the kingdom of God on his road now where to preach it brother Rogers and tomorrow to be with some somewhere else and somewhere else and somewhere else and back here in Monday and I've got to meet with him to make arrangements for a worldwide tour coming now and we're to be in Africa I understood this afternoon in March this is coming March time to meet Clayton sound more from the full gospel Christian businessman this week or this coming week first part of it and make arrangements for Jamaica Haiti's I go next week into Kentucky are down into Georgia have them meetings there come right back and come down to Kentucky and night your night they're catching these churches and come right straight back home from there and go to that Atlantic City for begin to 27 to the 30th and lay there the morning of the first and beginning and Kingston Jamaica the racetrack that night for 10 days meeting there and from there on in then to the eighties and wherever we don't know work to go from there just as the Lord will lead us how all these are in making yeah I haven't said yes David shear slates coming garden brother Gordon leans he's coming for South America and and the rest of Christian businessman for the Latin speaking America and brother David's fruits Switzerland Germany on down but we don't know yet you keep praying I don't want to go nowhere until God says go and the best of my knowledge therefore if I feel led to go then want to get off the plane I in the waters the opposition is I could say I come in the name of the Lord Jesus I was thankful for David the friendship that we've had together because the man is a very important man but he he certainly believes this Ministry of the Lord he certainly does and our names have been associated together throughout the entire world now brother David 9 and I'm so glad to have association with a man like that but friends I appreciate that but the greatest thing that I can think of being associated with Jesus Christ the Son of God great one now brother never leave some of them of be speaking in a few moments but I want to read just a little something out of the scripture now and it's good I think on New Year's life to see different preachers the way they approach the texts and what they say and so forth and each man having his own way of preaching you know God didn't make us all alike he made us different he made us different than our statue he made the world different and big mountains the little mountains prairies deserts big white flowers blue flowers and all different kinds he just makes us different that's all he makes redhead black heads why did a fat slim tall and all of whatever Morrissey he just is makes us different God is a God of variety and I kind of like that don't you but just the same thing all so let us turn now in our scriptures over in the book of st. Matthew st. Matthew's Gospel a beginning with the and the fourth verse I want to read far a read it's a text the Lord helping us st. Matthew the fourth chapter I believe before we read let's pray gracious Heavenly Father it is again with grateful hearts that we approach this new year and we approach thee and bring to thee all of our cares of the past and past that you put them in the seal forgetfulness and remember our sins against us no more and may not only we check up with our spiritual being but in our may we check our fellowship with thee and forgive us of all of our sins and we ask that your spirit will deal with us tonight if there be any unclean thing about us Lord take it as far as the East is from the West cast it into the sea of forgetfulness t remembered against us no more that we might enter into this new year clean wash by the blood of the Lamb and be ready made this 19 and 60 be the greatest year that we've ever served you give us exceedingly abundantly all these meetings that are in progress Lord that we're thinking of with brother do places around the world into the Asian over into Europe and all around Lord let it be your will and your power that'll lead to these things and if we should at any time be stepping off of your divine ordained path may the Holy Spirit put a blocking away and stop us Lord and turn us back to the right place friend bless this little church Lord MOT way close to 30 years I guess it stood here now as a memorial of the grace of God to a humble people we pray father that you'll bless brother Neville the pastor bless all the church bless the trustees the Deacons the song leader the pianist and all the laity everyone the Sunday School teachers whatever more Lord may we be able to grow this year in the grace of God and may our members ship grow into greater numbers and more grace of yours that then this has been in the years gone by granted father now I help us as we approach this text that we're fixing to read thy word and only you Lord can interpret and we pray that you'll grant it to us for the kingdom of God's sake in Jesus Christ's name Amen we're now seeing just now thought I have chosen for a text for the next few moments it's found in the scripture here and I will read it it's call or call it this from that time I didn't think I said the other night I didn't suppose I get to come down because it my throat was getting raw and my wife said to me yesterday or day before she said then I suppose you'll not be going down to the church and I said honey I don't think so my throat's so sore and raw and then no more than that night when I sit down he picked up the scripture I run on to this brother saath Minh came by he said would you be going to church tomorrow night I said yeah I'll be there and mediate looked around at me and she said I don't understand you I said I don't expect you to think I said or no one else no one that's led by the Spirit of God can ever be understood our Lord they could not understand him he looked like he talked one way one minute and another way another minute and somewhere else he talked about something else sometimes it was Jesus speaking the other times it was God speaking you seen even the disciples said their place a low now speaker saw plainly now we understand then Jesus says do you under you now believe see after that you just can't do it they called your letter the spirit and you start doing something you find out that you see your God wants to use you somewhere you got stop here and go here just letter the spirit there are odd peculiar people that has a life that you want to consecrate to God and then I always say this I will do this if the Lord is willing see if I make a promise to anybody I'll do it if the Lord is willing and therefore then if it is the will of Lord Nabi I'll speak on this message if the Lord is willing he could give me a call write this message to take off for California I cast aside everything and take off for California as hard as I could go and I want to live like that I don't want nothing tying me down I don't want no great big something in other words worth millions of dollars you have to get so much money every day to tie me down I want to be whirl with God says I want you to go down here to these people's only five of them but go down there stay there after you leave I want to go there I haven't got no obligations and if he wants me go overseas I heard it just mentioned going to Germany artists to Africa and some millionaire woman just the time if the spirit pulled up on me to go to Africa she said I'll sponsor the trip and pay every bit of it that's all why should I worry about money and things with my father owns all of it he can just speak to this rich man or that rich man or this people or that people and no need of me have to worry about it see God just takes care of it all well that's where you live just let him take care of it it's so good now let us turn in our scriptures to the fourth chapter and let's begin to to read about the 12th verse of the 4th chapter of the Gospel according to st. Matthew now when Jesus had been and now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed unto Galilee leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast in the borders of zu berlin at Netherland that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of Zebulun and the land of neptulon by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people that set in darkness saw great light and to them that would set in the regions of the shadow of death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach to them to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand I want to speak on the subject and from that time you know as human beings we all think of things from a certain time substance such a thing taken place and from that time and now many times you meet an old man or an old woman and they like to refer back to a time that something taken place that they can distinctively mark it out and say it was at that time now I suppose there's practically all of us sure tonight could call to member memory remembrance of certain things that taken place at certain time from that time something changed something such a thing it happened at that time and from that time on it was different and it's a good thing that we can in some of those memories of things that we think of is worthy things that change and there's some things that is not so worthy of thinking of for instance if the woman of an ill thing that she said there was a time that I was a good righteous moral girl and on a certain night or a certain place a certain thing happened and since that time she's been on the wrong road her life has been marred with sin and blackness darkness and all the judgment waits her but she can remember from that certain time it happened when she tucked the wrong road the the Junkman's a night on the streets that trying to drink his sorrows away you might pick him up like I was down on the Bowery here some time ago in New York the great center of the drunken people I was walking with a certain minister and there laid a man oh this plenty of man harmless helpless laying there with the front of their clothes all wet and and their beard all over their faces and just in a terrible condition and they were perfectly harmless and this minister said pick that one up and just ask him now I went over to this man which was lame with one foot across the bumper of a car and his head laying down on the street and where that he had been unable to to go with hands on the to the restroom and so he was just in a terrible condition and I took a hold of him and I said can you speak and he wouldn't make me no answer so the minister got down he knows more about how to deal with you and he asked him who are you finally got him roused up enough to see if you oh by me a drink and come to find out he could port his finger to the bank that he used to be president of well is that we are preachers could you tell me what took place if you promised me a drink well we couldn't do that I said I couldn't add sorrow to your sorrows I want to help you all this story come home one night and there was a what he called a Dear John letter on the table that is wife and nifty minute he loved her and she taken his children and he was divorced and run away with another man and he said I didn't know what to do to shoot my brains out or what to do so I went down to the saloon and from that time there he was that's all over the world the liar you might take one as I've said to man one day that our thought was telling jokes and come to find out that he told so many lies II really believe in myself and I said what makes you do that now sit down to talk with him I said I want to ask you those stories or two why for people to believe he said that first one I can ever remember telling he said I was the little boy that was raised in a good home and he said I went out and smoked corn silk cigarettes just to be smart and I eat some coffee to take it all for my breath and you said I'd done it back behind the old chimney behind the house and he said I'll never forget when mother caught me up and said to me Sonny let me smell your breath and I'll blow my breath into her face and she said you've eat coffee to take something off of your breath what have you been doing have you been smoking cigarettes and he said something told me to tell her the truth you said but I said no mama I cross my heart I haven't been smoking cigarettes he said in from that time that started it we can all find something beginning at a certain time and from that all things was changed and there's other worthy things that we could think of man with good intentions has tried to start things anew to do things at certain time for instance when electricity was first in found by Benjamin Franklin and it was able to conquer they begin to say from this time all there'll never be no more Wars because of this electricity can be put into fences with such a high voltage - no man could cross it they meant well and right after the first world war when when the Kaiser Wilhelm signed the Treaty of Peace we were told here in America I was a boy of about nine years old but I could remember of the people all saying we'll never have another war from this time on it's settled forever but we had another war I'm one of the great you in all right I would say before that they form what was called the League of Nations and they said now we'll have no more Wars because we've got a League of Nations that will patrol the world and if there is enough bras somewhere these men out of every nation will go there and police the world but it was a failure it was not on having wars and the Union will become the same thing we are told out by prediction at tomorrow night our Sunday night the same man that predicted Pearl Harbor to the deck moment that the the airplanes would vomit said that Sunday night at 12 o'clock that 75 percent of the American people going to ashes that Russia will bomb the United States this coming Sunday night at 12 o'clock the same man it predicted Pearl Harbor they're not putting it out cause people go Frannie I don't believe it no because he can't suffer atomic war one of theirs pastures of sound mayor this way we'll throw in that way in the world will go to pieces something's got to happen yet before Jesus comes that's right for instance the young married couple that was a certain time that they got married and they they put their bowels together and they pledged one to another their loyalty and they said that we will love honor and cherish each other as long as we both live but there come a time that something happened all these things are there's a time when something happens and maybe all their vows and all the league's of Nations and so forth maybe had good intentions but they all come to an end all become crawling beneath this the the feet of man with all the good intentions we can have or all must come tune in [Music] you
