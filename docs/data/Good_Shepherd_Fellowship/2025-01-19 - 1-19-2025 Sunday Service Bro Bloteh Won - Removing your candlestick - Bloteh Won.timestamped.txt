[52:16] prayer meeting this morning I would hope

[52:24] to and uh but uh we we would like to uh
[52:30] once again thank you all for coming out
[52:33] uh and uh being part of the service this
[52:36] morning and and we just want to thank
[52:39] you
[52:41] um with a heart of
[52:43] gratefulness Wednesday night we share
[52:47] with you u a little bit what was
[52:49] happening around our
[52:51] family and uh lost brother uh to uh
[52:57] after doing his liver
[52:59] transplant and then uh uh Friday night
[53:04] man I was just I was just I was just
[53:06] going through a whole lot I think it was
[53:09] the enemy was trying to get himself to
[53:11] me and uh uh and then around 2:00 a.m.
[53:15] in the morning I got a text uh from
[53:19] Nigeria a very good friend of mine uh
[53:22] he's actually a brother- inlaw to
[53:25] brother Deli a very very good friend
[53:27] brother Samson went to be with the
[53:30] Lord and I mean I was just I was just
[53:33] Crush you know uh uh he's a he was a
[53:37] pastor of a local
[53:40] church and uh uh and uh he's he's a a
[53:45] wonderful character very wonderful
[53:48] character and a good preacher very
[53:51] wonderful character I remember
[53:55] 2010 we did a convention that was just
[53:58] before I travel so we did a convention
[54:01] in April and then I traveled to the US
[54:04] in in in
[54:06] May and during that
[54:10] convention we we shared the convention
[54:13] together many many preachers and uh he
[54:17] preached an evening service I can
[54:19] remember and he said this evening he's a
[54:22] he's a doctor he said this evening we
[54:25] are going to do a
[54:28] surgery and our patient is going to be
[54:34] mosquito he says you see how mosquito is
[54:38] very tiny to do a surgery on
[54:43] mosquito you got to pay
[54:45] attention because anything you touch on
[54:48] mosquito can take mosquito life
[54:51] away so he said we're going to do a
[54:53] careful surgery to see
[54:56] you're going to join me in the theater
[54:59] for us to do a serery on
[55:01] mosquito and I mean no one knew where he
[55:03] was going with that but that's the kind
[55:06] of a character he was and I mean he
[55:08] brought the house down that night that
[55:11] evening and uh uh you know couple of uh
[55:16] months back I think some part of last
[55:18] year they were in a building
[55:22] construction and uh and I think uh he
[55:25] was trying to to help out the bed inside
[55:29] and he I think was trying to pick up a
[55:31] bag of c and he he caused a problem in
[55:35] his
[55:36] back and they sent him off the pullit
[55:38] for for many months I learned last
[55:42] Sunday was his first time back in the
[55:44] pit
[55:45] preaching so I remember he sent me the
[55:48] text very I mean very funny character
[55:50] very funny character he's a he's a good
[55:53] he's a good man and he sent me the text
[55:56] he says uh uh uh I'm I'm telling you I'm
[56:00] not feeling well brother W he says uh
[56:05] uh I if I die now you're going to send
[56:09] you're going to send all the support to
[56:10] bury me I don't need it then I need it
[56:14] now so when uh when I got the text he
[56:18] passed away all of those thoughts just
[56:20] flood through my mind you know they just
[56:23] flood through my mind I was lying there
[56:25] on the bed I said oh my God oh my God
[56:29] but uh I'm hoping to talk to his brother
[56:32] he and his brother his brother is uh uh
[56:36] Simon he also pastored another church
[56:39] both of them came out of uh a Muslim
[56:41] family their dad was a Muslim when they
[56:45] believe the message as young young boys
[56:48] so they had to go away from
[56:50] home and uh and that was just how their
[56:53] life Journey started so
[56:57] we we want to stand with them and and
[57:01] I'm hoping to talk to brother Del or his
[57:03] brother sometime in the
[57:07] week praise the
[57:09] lord well we don't know when is going to
[57:13] be our
[57:14] [Music]
[57:18] time so we want to we want to put the
[57:21] best that we that we want to put in this
[57:25] morning I was actually going to speak on
[57:27] uh on a t uh and uh what I wanted to
[57:31] talk on actually was to encourage uh uh
[57:37] uh
[57:38] responsibility and uh and then I I I
[57:42] thought like I said I was I was kind of
[57:44] a struggling between two thoughts where
[57:47] to go this
[57:49] morning uh because I I didn't want it to
[57:53] be to be misunderstood
[57:57] and uh
[57:59] uh but yet
[58:02] uh i t that uh with the time maybe we
[58:08] can just take something to encourage you
[58:10] this
[58:12] morning praise the Lord amen and then
[58:16] thinking about uh uh thinking about
[58:23] uh uh the loss of our brother brother I
[58:27] was just I was just so much uh caught in
[58:30] the place
[58:32] where I
[58:38] will I think I would just change my
[58:41] route this
[58:42] morning so
[58:45] uh doc you can look in the mail there I
[58:48] will send you something different from
[58:50] what I want to talk on this morning
[58:52] let's stay into our feet
[58:57] and we go to Revelation chapter
[58:59] 3 let's go to Revelation chapter 3 take
[59:03] the notes on
[59:05] Candlestick they use the one on
[59:07] Candlestick instead of the first one I
[59:09] sent
[59:19] you Revelation chapter
[59:23] 3 oh no not chapter 2
[59:26] read
[59:29] um I'm thinking about the loud isue
[59:32] church age but it's in Chapter 2
[59:35] Revelation Chapter
[59:38] 2 it's just it's just a little
[59:42] exitation I've thought about this for uh
[59:46] for a long time
[1:00:04] Revelation Chapter 2 let's read from
[1:00:06] verse one and unto the angel of Ephesus
[1:00:10] write this thing said he that holdeth
[1:00:14] the Seven Stars in in his right hand who
[1:00:18] walketh in the midst of the seven
[1:00:21] goaling candles
[1:00:23] STI I know th work
[1:00:28] that thou and thy labor and thy
[1:00:31] patient and how thy cannot bear them
[1:00:35] which are
[1:00:36] evil and thou Hast tried them which say
[1:00:40] they are Apostles and are not and has
[1:00:43] found them
[1:00:45] liars and and have born and have
[1:00:49] patience and for my name's sake has
[1:00:52] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[1:00:56] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:01:00] thou Hast left thy First
[1:01:04] Love
[1:01:06] remember therefore from when thou are
[1:01:09] fallen and
[1:01:11] repent and do the first work or else I
[1:01:16] will come unto thee
[1:01:19] quickly and will remove their
[1:01:22] Candlestick out of his place
[1:01:26] except
[1:01:27] thou
[1:01:29] repent let us pray Heavenly Father Lord
[1:01:33] Jesus uh I labor under these thoughts on
[1:01:37] the weekend thought I could change it
[1:01:39] this morning still feeling the
[1:01:41] impression of going that direction I
[1:01:43] want to ask your blessings upon it Lord
[1:01:46] and father something will come out of
[1:01:48] faith that will be a blessing to your
[1:01:50] children dear Lord God sometimes you
[1:01:53] give a man an inspiration Maybe not for
[1:01:56] these people maybe for somewhere else
[1:01:59] maybe for the individual himself but
[1:02:02] Lord as we trust you together we just
[1:02:05] want to Fellowship around these thoughts
[1:02:07] we know your word is inspired we know
[1:02:10] your word is blessed we need the
[1:02:12] blessing Lord we want that God you
[1:02:15] condition our hearts and mind this
[1:02:16] morning that we can be able to receive
[1:02:19] from you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:21] we pray amen the Lord bless you you may
[1:02:24] have your seat
[1:02:27] praise the
[1:02:29] Lord praise the
[1:02:31] Lord you love the Lord amen H the Lord
[1:02:36] is good all the time he's
[1:02:40] good
[1:02:42] amen now so uh uh with this with this
[1:02:48] Tau uh
[1:03:02] praise the Lord I will I will start off
[1:03:05] with this and uh
[1:03:08] uh
[1:03:13] uh there is something uh many years that
[1:03:18] uh I read in the church age
[1:03:20] book and and it have it have it have
[1:03:24] stayed with me for a while
[1:03:27] let me let me read
[1:03:29] this
[1:03:32] um this is from the Ephesian Church
[1:03:38] age that will be the second quot do has
[1:03:41] not the
[1:03:44] first how beautiful the Savior praise
[1:03:47] and command his
[1:03:51] children he takes full
[1:03:54] account all
[1:03:56] of the fine spiritual attitude and
[1:04:00] behavior just just pay attention here to
[1:04:07] me he takes full account of the fine
[1:04:11] spiritual attitude and behavior he know
[1:04:14] that there is weakness among them when
[1:04:17] we read uh uh uh Revelation Chapter
[1:04:21] 2 God is acknowledging to the church he
[1:04:24] says I know your word
[1:04:27] works I know your works so that's what
[1:04:29] brother brand is referring to here
[1:04:31] saying he he acknowledged that there is
[1:04:34] weakness Among Us he knows that there
[1:04:38] are failures Among Us he knows some of
[1:04:40] the things that we are dealing with and
[1:04:43] he says but yet he does not cry against
[1:04:48] it isn't that just like the Lord he
[1:04:53] knows how to encourage us in the right
[1:04:56] thing the right matters and discourage
[1:05:01] Us in the right matters see what he says
[1:05:04] here that got my
[1:05:06] attention we could all learn a good
[1:05:09] lesson here in running the church and
[1:05:13] our family what is the lesson that we
[1:05:16] could learn how to encourage the right
[1:05:20] think and how to
[1:05:23] discourage the wrong thing
[1:05:27] praise the Lord amen
[1:05:30] amen the Lord just
[1:05:33] done punish us for everything that we
[1:05:36] does he knows our our
[1:05:39] abilities he knows some of the things we
[1:05:42] are dealing with but yet he comes around
[1:05:46] and try to encourage Us in the right
[1:05:48] thing and discourage Us in the wrong
[1:05:52] thing and he says this a good lesson we
[1:05:55] all can learn
[1:05:57] that in running the church and running
[1:06:01] our family and better still we could all
[1:06:04] learn a good lesson in that God deals
[1:06:08] with each one of us in the exact way
[1:06:13] praise the Lord am amen he deal with us
[1:06:17] in the exact
[1:06:19] way he has a way to come around and
[1:06:23] discourage the wrong things if we are
[1:06:25] listening
[1:06:27] he will find a way to come around and
[1:06:30] also encourage Us in the things that we
[1:06:32] are doing well if we are
[1:06:36] listening better still we could all
[1:06:38] learn a good lesson in that God deals
[1:06:41] with each one of us exactly this way
[1:06:44] don't ever be discouraged saints of God
[1:06:47] for God is Not on gracious to forget
[1:06:50] your labor of love whatever we do even
[1:06:54] giving a cup of water to someone has a
[1:06:58] reward and the blessings from the Lord
[1:07:01] that's what Jesus said amen so let's
[1:07:04] let's uh let's uh whatever we find you
[1:07:08] know our hand in our hands to do let's
[1:07:10] let's do it amen let's do it as unto the
[1:07:13] Lord because he is the one and the only
[1:07:16] one that
[1:07:17] rewards praise the Lord yeah he's is the
[1:07:20] one and the only one that
[1:07:23] rewards so uh uh like I said I like to
[1:07:27] start up with this and I will go back to
[1:07:31] the the first let's go back to the first
[1:07:34] one I kind of a change on her so I have
[1:07:37] to help her
[1:07:40] out now it's almost the same scripture
[1:07:42] we read remember and repent that's what
[1:07:45] he says there remember therefore from
[1:07:48] when thou are
[1:07:51] Fallen where did you come from from
[1:07:54] Pentecost now he's talking to the church
[1:07:57] now he's talking to the church age where
[1:08:00] was the church birth at at
[1:08:02] Pentecost and Pentecost is not a
[1:08:05] denomination Pentecost is an experience
[1:08:08] amen we are Pentecostal by experience
[1:08:12] Now by
[1:08:13] denomination are we together where did
[1:08:16] the church come from from
[1:08:18] Pentecost from Pentecost you fell down
[1:08:22] to where you are now backsliding repent
[1:08:26] and do that first work go back to
[1:08:29] Pentecost again go back to your old
[1:08:32] experience amen go back to your uh or S

[1:11:43] upon the cause of Christ isn't that
[1:11:45] right don't we do it the the the bottle
[1:11:50] leer unhe hurting the church is unhe
[1:11:54] hurting dead is isn't The Prostitute
[1:11:57] that is hurting the church is the people
[1:12:00] who profess to be Christians that are
[1:12:03] hurting the
[1:12:05] church uh we know the bottle leer is we
[1:12:09] know who the bottle leer is we know what
[1:12:11] the prostitute is when our sisters dress
[1:12:14] like that that's different that's what
[1:12:18] hurt the church when the man drink like
[1:12:21] like the men drink the men of the church
[1:12:24] drink like the bottle leers well then
[1:12:26] that's what Hur the church they are
[1:12:29] professing to be Christians and then do
[1:12:33] that the people
[1:12:37] look for you that name let him that even
[1:12:42] named The Name of Jesus Christ depart
[1:12:45] from sin see get away from it oh we we
[1:12:49] are so short Brethren me you all of us
[1:12:53] we are so short of what Christ want us
[1:12:56] to be and right here in this day at uh
[1:13:01] uh it's time to lay aside every sin that
[1:13:05] easily beset us and wrong with patient
[1:13:08] the race that is set before us amen amen
[1:13:12] remember and repent oh I will
[1:13:16] remove the light of the sty out of out
[1:13:20] of his place what what his place in the
[1:13:24] church
[1:13:26] church but if you don't repent and go
[1:13:30] back to where you was at your first
[1:13:32] place I would I I will I will take your
[1:13:36] pastor right away from you and remove
[1:13:39] him out of this place now if you read in
[1:13:41] the church AG book he said it he said is
[1:13:44] for a church the pastor he said for the
[1:13:48] home it could be the husand now this is
[1:13:52] where I want to go with this whole thing
[1:13:55] or the Candlestick the Candlestick is
[1:13:58] the light
[1:13:59] bearer amen amen the candle is the light
[1:14:04] Barrel it's uh is is what is what the
[1:14:08] light the light uh uh uh you know what
[1:14:12] the what was placed in the Tabernacle to
[1:14:14] be able to Bear light to keep light in
[1:14:17] the Tabernacle so when we talk about the
[1:14:21] candles steak and the removing of the
[1:14:24] candle steak this is where my thought
[1:14:26] went with the whole thing because the
[1:14:29] Candlestick is said in Revelation a
[1:14:32] Candlestick but the Candlestick actually
[1:14:36] in the Tabernacle of of uh of of of
[1:14:39] Israel it was like a lamb
[1:14:42] standand okay and those and those
[1:14:46] lamb they were light that's what BR B
[1:14:50] said Church H book he said they were
[1:14:52] light from the fire from all of the
[1:14:56] altar now follow my thought now yes's
[1:14:59] the Candlestick but the Candlestick got
[1:15:02] their light from the fire from off of
[1:15:06] the
[1:15:07] altar are we together amen okay and uh
[1:15:12] when the priest goes into the Tabernacle
[1:15:16] he takes uh uh the the the light from
[1:15:20] The Altar and then he comes and light
[1:15:23] the Candlestick the first one one and
[1:15:26] then from the first one he goes and
[1:15:28] light the second one and from the second
[1:15:31] one he goes and light the tear one so
[1:15:34] it's it's a continuation of light it's
[1:15:36] the same light it's the same fire are we
[1:15:41] together amen but it's going from one
[1:15:43] Candlestick to another Candlestick to
[1:15:46] another Candlestick until the seven lamp
[1:15:50] stem or the seven Candlestick is lighted
[1:15:53] are we together
[1:15:56] amen and he he said that the the
[1:16:00] Candlestick or the lampstand they wheat
[1:16:04] the the the the wheat that that that
[1:16:06] pulls
[1:16:08] the the oil to keep them they all they
[1:16:12] all survive from one
[1:16:14] board okay the whe go down to one board
[1:16:17] and then it pulls and keep the
[1:16:19] Candlestick lighting now see where I
[1:16:22] want to go with this thought
[1:16:25] praise the Lord St John chapter
[1:16:28] 1 St John chapter
[1:16:31] 1 see where I want to go with this talk
[1:16:35] now praise the
[1:16:39] Lord our life every one of
[1:16:43] us our
[1:16:46] life when we when we give our first cry
[1:16:50] in the hospital it was just like our our
[1:16:53] Candlestick was turn
[1:16:56] on Okay we all are just like a candle
[1:17:01] light we all are just like uh uh a
[1:17:05] candle
[1:17:06] light St John chapter 1 let's read verse
[1:17:10] one here in the beginning was the word
[1:17:12] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:17:14] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:17:17] God all things were made by him and
[1:17:21] without him was not anything made that
[1:17:24] was made listen to this in him was life
[1:17:30] and that life was the
[1:17:34] light of
[1:17:36] men so when you got the breath of light
[1:17:40] the Breath of Life a light was turned
[1:17:45] on from from the source of
[1:17:49] Life the the the the the Zoe The Giver
[1:17:53] of Life
[1:17:55] the Bible says in him was life in the
[1:17:59] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:18:03] God and the Word was God that word was
[1:18:05] made flesh all things was made by him
[1:18:09] praise the Lord amen and in him was life
[1:18:13] and that life was the light of men
[1:18:20] that's what I want us to pay attention
[1:18:22] so just like the Old Testament now you
[1:18:24] have to realize Moses built the
[1:18:27] Tabernacle according to the faction that
[1:18:29] he saw in heaven so just like the Old
[1:18:32] Testament Tabernacle the candle state in
[1:18:36] the Tabernacle were light from the Great
[1:18:38] Fire of God your life that you have this
[1:18:42] morning in this
[1:18:44] building the day that you were
[1:18:47] born your body was a
[1:18:51] Candlestick when life came into that
[1:18:54] body
[1:18:55] a light was turned on
[1:18:57] Amen because life is light are we
[1:19:01] together that's what the scripture is
[1:19:04] saying
[1:19:06] here are we together are you are you get
[1:19:10] grapping the concept okay let's look at
[1:19:14] another let's look at another comparison
[1:19:18] in the scripture 2 Samuel chapter 21
[1:19:25] I'm uh I hope I can be able to bring it
[1:19:28] in a way that it will be a blessing to
[1:19:30] you this morning
[1:19:46] amen 2 Samuel chapter 21
[1:19:56] the Bible will describe something here
[1:19:58] of
[1:19:59] isra wanting to go to
[1:20:04] battle
[1:20:07] uh the Philistines were making war with
[1:20:10] them
[1:20:25] okay let's let's read verse 17 you can
[1:20:28] read the entire story but 17 is where
[1:20:31] word m i will our tau is this morning
[1:20:34] are we together amen praise the
[1:20:38] Lord second
[1:20:40] Samuel chapter
[1:20:51] 21 2 Samuel chapter 21 on verse
[1:21:00] 17
[1:21:02] amen so uh if you look at verse 17 here
[1:21:06] the the Bible says and Abel the son of
[1:21:10] zero seced him and smot the Philistines
[1:21:15] and killed
[1:21:21] him and uh uh let's let's let's go back
[1:21:25] to verse 15 we will get a good picture
[1:21:27] because what is happening there is that
[1:21:29] he have just protected
[1:21:31] David he had just protected David so uh
[1:21:36] verse 15 moreover the
[1:21:38] Philistine had yet wared against with W
[1:21:41] uh again with Israel and David went down
[1:21:44] and his servant with him and fought
[1:21:47] against the Philistine and David walks
[1:21:49] faint now David was older now than he
[1:21:52] was when he killed Goliath this is not
[1:21:55] the young David this is the older David
[1:21:58] now David has been King for many years
[1:22:01] and he's
[1:22:04] old and uh
[1:22:08] Ash which was the son of the Giant and
[1:22:13] and uh uh the weight of who spear weigh
[1:22:17] 300 shakers of Bri in weight he been
[1:22:22] gather with a new sword for Tau to have
[1:22:26] slain David now this is one of the
[1:22:28] Giants son but AB be sh shall the son of
[1:22:33] zero secur him which mean he he kind of
[1:22:37] covered David he shaded David and he
[1:22:40] smart the Philistine and killed him then
[1:22:43] the men of David swar unto him saying
[1:22:47] thou shal no more go with us to
[1:22:53] battle that quench not the light of
[1:22:59] Israel praise the Lord amen why they
[1:23:02] call him the light of Israel because he
[1:23:05] was the
[1:23:07] king are we together amen he was the
[1:23:10] king he was the head of the nation so in
[1:23:14] that sense he's the
[1:23:17] light of
[1:23:19] Israel amen just like the pastor is the
[1:23:24] head of the church he is the light he is
[1:23:27] the
[1:23:29] Candlestick he is not the only
[1:23:32] light are we are we together now I want
[1:23:35] you to understand this now just like the
[1:23:38] man is the head of the home he is the
[1:23:43] light what is the light for the light is
[1:23:46] to show the
[1:23:49] pathway okay it's a sense of
[1:23:52] leadership so here the man of Israel
[1:23:56] decided that David will no longer go we
[1:23:59] don't want to quench the light we don't
[1:24:00] want to be without a king we don't want
[1:24:03] to be without a leader so what they
[1:24:06] would do is now they will keep David
[1:24:08] home that he can no longer go to war are
[1:24:12] we
[1:24:14] together are you are you grapping the
[1:24:20] principle because it's it's all about uh
[1:24:23] uh uh uh understanding the principle
[1:24:26] then you'll be able to appreciate you
[1:24:29] know where where we going with this
[1:24:32] thought praise the
[1:24:36] Lord so the Bible
[1:24:39] says the word in the beginning had the
[1:24:43] life and that word was the light that
[1:24:47] lighted every man that cometh in the
[1:24:49] word so it makes us we have our
[1:24:52] individual light which a is our life and
[1:24:56] uh we we could we could carry it in a
[1:24:59] progressive way but I want to just I
[1:25:01] want to keep it in context this uh uh uh
[1:25:04] let's let's also look at Luke Chapter
[1:25:07] 2 let's look at Luke Chapter
[1:25:11] 2 and then we will go back to that code
[1:25:16] and then I will share my thoughts with
[1:25:18] you I'm hoping not to keep you
[1:25:21] long that was the plan
[1:25:28] praise the
[1:25:31] Lord Luke Chapter 2 let's look at verse
[1:25:35] 32 and I I will say some things here
[1:25:38] that will that will will you know that
[1:25:41] will kind of uh bring some balance to
[1:25:44] what we are we are sharing this morning
[1:25:46] Luke 2:32
[1:26:04] this is uh
[1:26:06] Simon uh the blind prophet when Jesus
[1:26:08] was
[1:26:09] dedicated this was his speech let's read
[1:26:12] from verse 29
[1:26:15] Lord now let that seven seven depart in
[1:26:18] peace according to Thy word for my eyes
[1:26:21] have seen their salvation
[1:26:24] which there has prepared before the face
[1:26:28] of all people a
[1:26:31] light to lighten the Gentiles now you
[1:26:35] could take this back to Isaiah chapter 9
[1:26:38] Isaiah chapter 49 Jesus was promised to
[1:26:42] be the light that will men that have sat
[1:26:46] in darkness great light has sprung unto
[1:26:50] them praise the Lord amen so in one
[1:26:55] sense also the messenger of the age
[1:27:00] becomes the lightbearer of the age are
[1:27:03] we together that's what the Candlestick
[1:27:06] represented Candlestick is just a light
[1:27:12] bearer are we together amen now so here
[1:27:16] is where this whole thought is going if
[1:27:20] the Candlestick if the lamp stem in the
[1:27:24] in the Tabernacle is light from the
[1:27:27] great altar of
[1:27:30] God the fire is taken from the altar of
[1:27:33] God is put on the first candles stick
[1:27:36] and it goes onto the next candles stick
[1:27:39] you see how uh uh brother Brandon talks
[1:27:42] about that in the church age how every
[1:27:46] uh uh the succession of Ages Every age
[1:27:49] inherit from the age that have passed
[1:27:54] are we together am the blessing of the
[1:27:57] Ephesus Church age went to the SAR
[1:27:59] Church age also the battle of the of the
[1:28:03] Ephesus Church age because they started
[1:28:06] dealing with the nicolan spirit it also
[1:28:08] went to the second Church age that's
[1:28:11] what make the seventh Church age h h h h
[1:28:15] a more difficult age because we inherit
[1:28:18] all the blessings and we also inherit
[1:28:20] all the
[1:28:22] battles I would
[1:28:25] together so one lamp stem was light from
[1:28:30] the next one then the tear one was light
[1:28:33] from the second to the tear the fourth
[1:28:35] from the so just like that but I also
[1:28:39] believe that uh it was God God was also
[1:28:44] setting a a a president to show us how
[1:28:48] responsibility is
[1:28:52] transfer praise the Lord
[1:28:54] let's go back to Genesis chapter 1 the
[1:28:58] Bible says in the beginning God created
[1:29:00] the Heaven and the Earth he was the one
[1:29:02] there he said let there be light and
[1:29:04] there was light he did all the creation
[1:29:08] and then on the sixth day God Will Make
[1:29:12] A Man In His
[1:29:14] Image and in his
[1:29:17] likeness and then on the seventh day God
[1:29:20] will
[1:29:22] rest what is the pr principle there God
[1:29:25] in all of his work he never took rest
[1:29:29] until he was able to get a Man In His
[1:29:34] Image are you seeing the the principle
[1:29:38] so when God was able to achiev to get a
[1:29:41] man in His image and in his likeness
[1:29:44] what happened the work will continue now
[1:29:47] God can rest amen amen amen are you
[1:29:51] seeing the principle so you you see what
[1:29:54] happened is that if the if the
[1:29:57] Candlestick if the first Candlestick is
[1:30:00] light and the light don't move to the
[1:30:03] second candles stick if that first
[1:30:05] Candlestick go off what
[1:30:07] happened everywhere is dark because the
[1:30:11] light was not being able to
[1:30:16] transfer so you see in every age in
[1:30:20] every age I'll read something to you
[1:30:23] that's how all these for his people and
[1:30:25] he bring those very same thing down to
[1:30:28] us as far as a church he bring it down
[1:30:32] to us as far as in our
[1:30:37] home praise the Lord
[1:30:41] amen are we together am
[1:30:45] amen that as a
[1:30:48] lightbearer if you
[1:30:50] don't like the Next Generation why ever
[1:30:54] you have year when you die it die with
[1:31:00] you praise the
[1:31:03] Lord
[1:31:06] amen if you don't light if you don't
[1:31:08] pass the light
[1:31:11] on as a as as as a family if we cannot
[1:31:16] be able to pass the light on to to our
[1:31:19] children if we cannot bring them to the
[1:31:21] place to be able to understand uh you
[1:31:23] you know what uh uh uh what is this
[1:31:26] Christian Life all about what what are
[1:31:27] we taking them to church for if we
[1:31:29] cannot get that light if we cannot get
[1:31:33] those candlesticks light
[1:31:38] off praise the Lorden God God is
[1:31:41] Sovereign I'm not I'm not going to put
[1:31:42] God in a box okay I'm only trying to
[1:31:46] show you a
[1:31:48] principle praise the Lord amen I'm
[1:31:52] trying to show you a principle yes
[1:31:55] amen because we we see it
[1:31:58] everywhere and uh uh uh lately we have
[1:32:01] seen it a whole lot in our
[1:32:05] community of uh message
[1:32:07] Believers praise the
[1:32:10] Lord
[1:32:13] amen the the pastor de he's uh he's he's
[1:32:16] the man you know we love him we
[1:32:18] appreciate him but sometimes it becomes
[1:32:20] all about him
[1:32:24] and the light do not pass
[1:32:26] on and then when that Candlestick is
[1:32:30] removed sometimes the people go in
[1:32:32] darkness for the
[1:32:34] why the church plate the F and all of
[1:32:38] that is because the light do not move
[1:32:44] on are we together think about the great
[1:32:47] light of God the Bible says he was the
[1:32:51] light to light the Gentiles
[1:32:55] take this I'm I'm trying to make it in a
[1:32:58] way that you will picture it in your
[1:33:00] mind when the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[1:33:04] of Pentecost what did the Bible says the
[1:33:06] Bible says the Holy Ghost fell and upon
[1:33:09] their head it was like tongue of fire
[1:33:14] and tongue of fire is just like how the
[1:33:17] Candlestick is when the candle light is
[1:33:20] light is just that's what it's called
[1:33:22] tongue of fire it's just like like a
[1:33:24] tongue and the tongue is in a kind of a
[1:33:27] a little bit like a paramid shape but
[1:33:29] it's
[1:33:31] round so that light
[1:33:34] Jesus lighted all of those 100 that was
[1:33:38] in the upper room amen praise the Lord
[1:33:42] do you see why the first church was
[1:33:47] successful when they killed him all
[1:33:49] every one of them got discouraged they
[1:33:51] went back to their fishing net those
[1:33:53] that were C went back I mean now Matthew
[1:33:56] didn't have anywhere to go he was a tax
[1:33:58] collector he was working for the Roman
[1:34:00] government now he have joined himself
[1:34:02] with this religious group and I mean
[1:34:05] they were all discouraged but when Jesus
[1:34:08] resurrected and show himself in their
[1:34:11] midst praise the Lord
[1:34:14] amen all they were all encouraging and
[1:34:17] they were keeping he told them you go
[1:34:19] and wait in the upper room until I
[1:34:21] Endure you people with power amen so
[1:34:25] what was he going to do he was going to
[1:34:27] use that great light that he was to
[1:34:30] light each of those Candlestick why
[1:34:33] because he wanted the responsibility to
[1:34:36] go
[1:34:37] onen amen amen even Mary the mother of
[1:34:41] Jesus Salomon and the other women they
[1:34:44] were in the upper room wanting to be
[1:34:49] lighten because it's
[1:34:52] truth the man is the head but most of
[1:34:55] the time the man is not
[1:34:57] spiritual not every
[1:35:00] time sometimes and in many hom the woman
[1:35:03] holds the spiritual responsibility she's
[1:35:06] the one fasting she's the one praying
[1:35:08] she's the one and I mean the the God is
[1:35:11] just breaking his brain to bring all the
[1:35:12] money
[1:35:16] home even though it do not it it it do
[1:35:19] not change the placement in the
[1:35:21] family why because one time God raised a
[1:35:24] debor as a
[1:35:27] George she was the spiritual woman she
[1:35:30] was the prophetess she was the one that
[1:35:33] was receiving word from the Lord to be
[1:35:35] able to tell Barack how to go into
[1:35:38] battle amen so sometime God does that
[1:35:42] yes are we
[1:35:47] together praise the
[1:35:49] Lord I'm may not be preaching your
[1:35:52] typical message message but it's okay
[1:35:55] praise the Lord hallelujah amen but I
[1:35:58] want you to grab this I want you to grab
[1:36:01] this Con uh H H uh this concept because
[1:36:05] brother brandom say it's a good lesson
[1:36:06] we can teach it at church we can also
[1:36:08] teach our family
[1:36:10] there praise the Lord
[1:36:12] amen because sometimes where where we we
[1:36:17] we we we fail as parents is that we send
[1:36:21] the children to school to learn
[1:36:24] they're just going to gain knowledge it
[1:36:26] does not make them
[1:36:28] responsible we don't we don't we don't
[1:36:31] teach them responsibility we don't
[1:36:33] transfer responsibility to
[1:36:39] them amen amen they learn they learn
[1:36:42] grammar and different things you know
[1:36:45] and then they correct you when you when
[1:36:46] you're when you're speaking is not right
[1:36:48] he said no papa that's not the way to
[1:36:50] say it this is the way they can say it
[1:36:54] as much as that is
[1:36:56] beautiful but there is a god-given
[1:36:59] responsibility and that's what I'm I'm
[1:37:02] trying to do this morning I'm trying to
[1:37:04] show that each and every one of us have
[1:37:07] a god-given
[1:37:08] responsibility that's right amen amen
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:13] amen life was candle in us when when
[1:37:17] when when uh when when we were giving
[1:37:19] birth to a candle light was light as as
[1:37:23] we come down through through the through
[1:37:25] our age of life God in his Mercy also
[1:37:29] candle our light by giving us another
[1:37:32] spiritual
[1:37:33] light praise the
[1:37:35] Lord but you see what happened is that
[1:37:38] uh men become so selfish with their
[1:37:41] light it's only for
[1:37:44] them and when that Candlestick go off
[1:37:48] it's
[1:37:49] dead nobody they just they just remember
[1:37:52] you but you see when you live
[1:37:57] on you live
[1:38:00] on when you rais men to carry on the
[1:38:04] work praise the Lord Moses live on yes
[1:38:09] when he had a Joshua and a Caleb to take
[1:38:13] the people over to the promised land and
[1:38:15] put them in their inheritance yes
[1:38:19] amen they could tell the children of
[1:38:21] Israel this is the place that Moses
[1:38:23] spoke about even though he was not there
[1:38:26] but he live on Amen we can say a prophet
[1:38:29] say we can say brother brand said yes
[1:38:32] why because that pillow of fire has
[1:38:37] candled some some people amen it has
[1:38:40] been able to light some other men that
[1:38:42] can take the message faithfully and
[1:38:44] carry on amen
[1:38:50] amen praise the Lord amen that's why we
[1:38:52] see politics is
[1:38:54] fing because men are only learning the
[1:38:57] corrupt part of
[1:38:59] politics there is no men that are
[1:39:01] learning how to fight like the the old
[1:39:04] fathers fought for rights and fought for
[1:39:06] what was right they are not learning it
[1:39:09] just only learning the corrupt how to
[1:39:11] you know build their pocket up and build
[1:39:12] their Marions and make their family
[1:39:14] better it's just s you die all that
[1:39:17] money stay in the bank is is for
[1:39:19] nothing that's true
[1:39:24] God never
[1:39:25] rested until he got a man in His
[1:39:35] image until we can be able to bring
[1:39:37] forth another generation that can carry
[1:39:40] the fire of
[1:39:44] God until we can be able to be impart
[1:39:47] for in the little way that we can amen
[1:39:55] that's what it's all
[1:40:04] about you see some some some families
[1:40:07] you know what I mean I mean just many
[1:40:09] different examples we can give
[1:40:17] you when the head of that home is gone
[1:40:20] the family can no longer keep themsel
[1:40:22] there
[1:40:25] and before then it all it looks it
[1:40:26] almost looks like oh yeah you know they
[1:40:28] they were all wonderful but sometimes
[1:40:31] sometimes and many times we are just
[1:40:34] guarded by
[1:40:36] fear we are just been kept there by
[1:40:43] fear and keeping by fear do not
[1:40:46] last it's the same when you keep people
[1:40:49] under a legalistic teaching it do not
[1:40:51] last
[1:40:54] because you know what is happening it is
[1:40:56] only truth that can reside in your soul
[1:41:00] your soul can only feed on Truth your
[1:41:03] spirit can be
[1:41:04] intimidated your spirit can be it only
[1:41:07] dwells in fear fear will just keep you
[1:41:09] in that place and keep you religious and
[1:41:12] do not give
[1:41:20] birth are we together amen
[1:41:28] so you see when God set up that he set
[1:41:31] up that principle that's why brother
[1:41:33] Bram taught in the church ages he says
[1:41:35] as the as the Candlestick is life from
[1:41:37] the fire of
[1:41:39] God and he light the first Candlestick
[1:41:42] he says just like how that Candlestick
[1:41:44] is light he says that's how every
[1:41:48] Minister H that Messenger will have that
[1:41:51] same burning bush experience
[1:41:53] amen amen just saying brother brandham
[1:41:56] said it's not
[1:41:59] enough if we say brother Bram said and
[1:42:01] we don't have the life to back it I mean
[1:42:03] we just we just have it a public
[1:42:06] speaking the word do not have an
[1:42:10] impact the word do not grab the
[1:42:19] people are we together amen
[1:42:28] so just like how the the the the
[1:42:30] messenger is light by the fire of God
[1:42:33] the minister on him must be light by the
[1:42:35] fire of God and then he must also be
[1:42:37] able to transfer that fire of God upon
[1:42:40] the people amen amen
[1:42:49] amen are we together
[1:42:54] it's not the ministry of the preacher
[1:42:56] that makes the
[1:42:58] church no sometimes we think that's
[1:43:01] that's what it is now we yet about this
[1:43:04] man we it's just it's just the name of
[1:43:06] the minister that is out there but
[1:43:08] that's not what makes the
[1:43:12] church is the pillow of fire is the Lake
[1:43:16] of Fire is God taking that word and
[1:43:20] sparking your life and sparking your
[1:43:22] life and Spark in your
[1:43:33] life are we together
[1:43:36] amen that's what God wants to do it's
[1:43:39] it's it's a it's a continuation walk in
[1:43:42] the light as he is in the light it's a
[1:43:44] continuation he want to carry out that
[1:43:47] responsibility
[1:43:56] sometimes you think about
[1:44:01] that you find a wonderful group of
[1:44:03] people
[1:44:05] together all looks like a loving group
[1:44:07] of
[1:44:09] people when that fire of God is Not
[1:44:12] candle in the hearts of the people let
[1:44:14] little situation Rises this people that
[1:44:17] were looking like a loving group of
[1:44:19] people it looks like they have never
[1:44:21] seen one another it starts to say
[1:44:24] horrible things about one another that's
[1:44:25] right
[1:44:27] amen what were we doing we're just
[1:44:30] making another denomination
[1:44:35] yes we are all
[1:44:38] lightbearers the Bible say he lighted
[1:44:41] every man that cometh into the word we
[1:44:44] are all light bearer
[1:44:55] are you seeing the are you seeing the
[1:44:57] channel of thought that I'm I'm taking
[1:44:58] this morning I didn't wanted you to
[1:45:00] missunderstanding you know you know you
[1:45:03] read this you know uh God take take the
[1:45:06] pastor away it looks like I'm coming to
[1:45:07] die and I'm giving my found of speech
[1:45:09] I'm not dying
[1:45:12] now
[1:45:14] okay I'm not dying now it's not fairw
[1:45:17] message I'm preaching to you but it's
[1:45:19] just that it's necessary for us to let
[1:45:21] ourself know
[1:45:23] because the truth of it is that that's
[1:45:25] where we are faing that's where we are
[1:45:28] faing in our
[1:45:32] homes that's what we are
[1:45:38] feeling if we cannot carry this light
[1:45:41] you know uh uh for for for for the
[1:45:43] Candlestick of our children to be light
[1:45:46] when we are no no no longer around or
[1:45:49] they get to that age of challenge they
[1:45:51] don't know how to on the light they
[1:45:54] don't know that they are
[1:45:55] lightbearers they don't know that they
[1:45:57] are individual
[1:46:00] lightbearers why because they just been
[1:46:02] following your light daddy say I must
[1:46:04] not do this mommy say I must not do this
[1:46:07] they never come to the place to realize
[1:46:09] that they have their individual
[1:46:11] Candlestick and they have to shine light
[1:46:13] in their little corner
[1:46:15] amen
[1:46:20] amen when the child comes to that place
[1:46:23] of
[1:46:23] conviction they can be able to stand
[1:46:26] among their friends and say no I can't
[1:46:27] do that because it's not right I'm a
[1:46:31] Christian then that little light is
[1:46:35] beginning to
[1:46:44] shine are we together
[1:46:47] am are you seeing what I'm going with
[1:46:49] this praise the Lord
[1:46:55] well thank God I can be able to bring it
[1:46:58] to you so you won't S there U now now
[1:47:02] brother bam said this in why why are
[1:47:05] people to us about let's read that
[1:47:20] one there are seven goaling
[1:47:24] candlesticks by that Holy place and is
[1:47:28] giving
[1:47:29] light the candle stickes are giving
[1:47:34] light there to the man who quit his
[1:47:39] drinking quit his smoking quit lying
[1:47:43] quit
[1:47:44] stealing treat his neighbor right good
[1:47:48] to his wife or her good to her husband
[1:47:52] the same way men and women the
[1:47:55] Believers he come into a place where he
[1:47:58] quit all his
[1:48:01] meanness
[1:48:05] which which is through the blood with
[1:48:11] sanctification he's called to a new life
[1:48:15] and he
[1:48:17] walks in
[1:48:20] there he don't have to walk
[1:48:23] by the light out
[1:48:26] there he's got a better
[1:48:28] light he's walking by the Light of the
[1:48:32] seven golden Candlestick which is
[1:48:34] burning olive
[1:48:36] oil and the olive oil which represent
[1:48:40] the Holy
[1:48:41] Spirit the
[1:48:44] fire was the baptism which brought which
[1:48:47] brought baptizing or or even baptized
[1:48:50] right in there by the whole Holy Ghost
[1:48:53] amen now so when he when he taught that
[1:48:57] message why people are talk about he was
[1:49:00] all he was also in the same line of
[1:49:04] thought you know that people come too
[1:49:07] far they come so far to a sanctify life
[1:49:12] and never get a light from the
[1:49:16] altar are we together amen what did
[1:49:20] Isaiah said Isaiah chapter 6
[1:49:23] when he repented he said who is me I'm a
[1:49:26] man of Da he said there was an angel
[1:49:29] that flew from off the altar with a core
[1:49:32] of
[1:49:33] fire and came and touched his
[1:49:39] lip why because that's that was what he
[1:49:42] told God I'm a man of unclean
[1:49:46] lips the fire of God came and sanctify
[1:49:50] his lips
[1:49:54] praise the
[1:49:55] Lord and when we talk about the pillow
[1:49:58] of fire that's what the pillow of fire
[1:50:03] is I'm I'm in as much as I believe that
[1:50:07] that that that God can create a glory of
[1:50:09] light that can hang on me what is the
[1:50:12] need of that light if my life is not
[1:50:14] changed I want a pillow of fire that can
[1:50:17] drop down in my heart and change my
[1:50:20] nature amen am amen amen
[1:50:26] amen praise the Lord amen think for
[1:50:29] example the children of Israel they
[1:50:32] follow the pill of the pill of fire hang
[1:50:34] over them 40 days 40 night everywhere
[1:50:37] they were going in the day it turned to
[1:50:39] the pillar of cloud in the night it was
[1:50:41] a pillar of fire yes with all of that
[1:50:44] they were still gossiping they were
[1:50:46] still aring they were still disobeying
[1:50:48] Moses
[1:50:53] so what is the need of that if that
[1:50:55] pillow of fire Cannot drop down in my
[1:50:57] heart sanctify my lips clean my Minds
[1:51:00] from Evil thought change my nature
[1:51:02] that's what I want that's the kind of a
[1:51:04] pillow of fire I
[1:51:08] want
[1:51:16] amen are we together amen
[1:51:26] so you see that is
[1:51:29] uh that is the way God transferred his
[1:51:36] responsibility when he rais up a
[1:51:38] man he take that
[1:51:41] fire to the next faithful
[1:51:45] generation praise the Lord amen if not
[1:51:49] the work of God will be dead that's
[1:51:51] right
[1:51:54] the light of God will go
[1:51:58] off let Israel in battle they are seeing
[1:52:02] they are seeing how weak David is he's
[1:52:04] not as strong as he was and these Giants
[1:52:07] are trying to revenge and kill him they
[1:52:10] said no we will not bring the light of
[1:52:13] Israel to war anymore because when the
[1:52:16] king is dead the nation goes into
[1:52:20] darkness
[1:52:22] until another king is raised
[1:52:25] up praise the Lord
[1:52:28] amen so they pull him out of
[1:52:31] battle because he was the light to the
[1:52:34] nation
[1:52:37] yes as husman we all light to our
[1:52:42] home it's not enough to just say I'm the
[1:52:45] man of this house no that's is not
[1:52:48] enough that's
[1:52:51] right we must be able to take that fire
[1:52:53] from off the altar amen through prayer a
[1:52:57] life of Consecration and say
[1:52:59] Lord uh I light my children I light my
[1:53:04] wife Let the Fire of God burn in this
[1:53:07] house
[1:53:14] yes I can I can pull all the millions of
[1:53:17] cot on respect your pastor and can't
[1:53:20] write in and just say the brother BR
[1:53:22] said respect your pastor you must
[1:53:23] respect the man you must respect his off
[1:53:25] I can do all of
[1:53:29] that it does not change anything
[1:53:34] right praise the
[1:53:37] Lorden but when the fire of
[1:53:41] God can come from out of the pages of
[1:53:43] the word if God can be able to say
[1:53:46] something that would grab the people
[1:53:48] heart and create a prayer life in them
[1:53:51] and create a life of concentration in
[1:53:53] them but not need to be whing people on
[1:53:56] their
[1:53:57] back amen they are not
[1:54:00] slaves for us to use coat and be weeping
[1:54:03] them they are the redeemed that must be
[1:54:05] rejoicing in the word when the word is
[1:54:07] preached we must know that is our labor
[1:54:09] T we must rejoice in it amen amen amen
[1:54:24] are we
[1:54:30] together the Lord is beautiful you know
[1:54:33] you think about all of
[1:54:35] that you think about all of that I'll
[1:54:37] read this to you I might pick it up
[1:54:39] another time I thought that I would
[1:54:41] finish at 1 1 p.m. today so I don't want
[1:54:45] to go above that
[1:54:50] time let's read this
[1:54:53] spoken word is the Original
[1:54:55] Seed I will pick I will pick up from
[1:54:58] there another
[1:55:05] time that's what every generation has
[1:55:08] its own
[1:55:10] Revival and Chang at the
[1:55:14] word so The Sovereign
[1:55:17] God at the Judgment Wesley group will
[1:55:21] rise up and these uh STW Methodist of
[1:55:26] today will answer for Luther will rise
[1:55:29] up the Catholic Will Rise Up from back
[1:55:33] behind Arena's Mighty poap and all those
[1:55:37] and will have to stand the Judgment for
[1:55:40] hybriding the word of God to
[1:55:43] Dogma now I remember
[1:55:45] correctly that's why each generation has
[1:55:49] its own Revival
[1:55:52] it gets a chance at the word so you see
[1:55:57] God gave us a
[1:55:59] chance praise the Lord amen we can sit
[1:56:03] down yet and say world if we were at we
[1:56:06] can sit down yet and weep to have been
[1:56:08] at Aza weep to have been there when
[1:56:11] Luther put the Theses there but God has
[1:56:13] given a chance at our own
[1:56:16] Revival where the word can live in our
[1:56:19] midst that's right if we all can put our
[1:56:22] shoulder to the will and know that we
[1:56:25] are responsible for this little group we
[1:56:27] have a chance at our
[1:56:31] Revival what is the Revival is to make
[1:56:34] this word
[1:56:36] live
[1:56:38] amen not just wearing a h h h attack on
[1:56:42] us I'm a
[1:56:44] Believer but living like
[1:56:48] one and creating an atmosphere where
[1:56:51] others can also come come in and live as
[1:56:54] at
[1:56:55] once we had a CH we have a chance at re
[1:56:59] Revival it is on our hands amen it is
[1:57:02] whatever we do with
[1:57:06] it praise the
[1:57:08] Lord
[1:57:14] amen if you know and realize how this
[1:57:17] little
[1:57:19] group is a blessing to the Feld that
[1:57:23] comes
[1:57:24] here and uh to the
[1:57:27] Community Praise the Lord
