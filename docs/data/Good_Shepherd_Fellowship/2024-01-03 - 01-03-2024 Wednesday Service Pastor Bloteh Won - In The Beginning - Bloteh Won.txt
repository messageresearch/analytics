by reading the first chapter of the first book of the Bible amen because I'm I want to speak tonight on the beginning that we every everybody have a beginning amen so we want to begin we want to begin the year like the way God begin time praise the Lord amen Genesis chapter 1 we read verse one in the beginning let's let's read it together that would be good that would be good if we can just read verse one together in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth praise the Lord St John chapter 1 in John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 we will read uh verse one and verse two and uh maybe we can also read it together verse one and verse two in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with god let's pray together father we are so grateful Lord we want to thank you we want to appreciate you we want to glorify your your Holy Name what a wonderful savior you are father we want to thank you for our lives thank you Father Lord that

Lord father you will come and take your word break it to our hearts into our understanding tonight what a wonderful savior you are we love you because you first love us come bless your word now in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat in whatever we want to share tonight if we will call it a subject we will say it in the beginning or the beginning of God but I would just say in the beginning praise the Lord on my Note this said the beginning of God but I was said in the beginning the thought kind of struck me tonight I will share that with you is uh uh we know that God is infinite amen we know that he's infinite we know that he has no beginning he has no end but yet we will discover from the word that God has a beginning praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I'll make sure I explain myself tonight before I go home because if I don't do it I'm going to I'm going to come up on the other side praise the Lord so we just just want to thank the Lord and uh uh we want to uh greet uh uh brother shedra for coming to be with us tonight good to see you my friend Happy New Year Praise the Lord he kept promising me he will come and then uh uh so I kept looking on the road to see him and never saw when he enter praise the Lord or El I was going to call him in the office for us to talk a little bit but word is good to be in the house of the Lord so tonight I I want to talk on the on the uh the beginning just as we are beginning the year and the the reason why and the way I'm going with this is just to say there uh uh when God before he be he became God we know that he was the great intern of spirit and uh uh he was the great internal Spirit he was Elohim we have to know that God uh uh God When when when when he became an object of worship there was a beginning and that's what we will look into tonight but before we do that I just give the background of what why I came up with this subject and I thought that uh like I said as as as a church as a people as children of God uh we will realize that uh the great in of God for him to come down and express himself he had a beginning there was a beginning to death God himself don't have a beginning we know that uh he's self-existent we know that uh uh he don't have a father you know our mother no beginning of time no beginning of day that is the Great internal Spirit but in expressing himself uh uh there was a beginning and there was what Moses referred to when he said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth but uh uh if you remember uh on on Sunday night while we had our our uh how we can call it crossover service last service of the year coming into the new year we were speaking on something and uh that is that is the attraction uh uh what we were asking ourself what is our attraction for this year what are we attracted to and uh uh and then in talking about that I read a scripture uh uh I read a scripture over there in in uh St John where Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and uh uh and then I was also talking about uh uh the drawing principle I spoke about the five kingdoms that we have we have uh uh uh from from the kingdom of God to the hon Kingdom and then the animal kingdom the plants Kingdom and also the mineral Kingdom and uh if if you realized that night I don't know whether I was uh because I was tired or or so I I I saw myself a little bit struggling on on the subject to be able to bring there rightly but as I was uh uh uh thinking about there today uh meditating today for some reason I went right back to the same place again uh uh looking at that word when Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me and it's it's because of that scripture I was trying to Brak the the the the principle of drawing the principle of uh of of how God you know draw us onto him and uh and then as I was looking at there there was a scripture also in the Book of James that that spring out to me uh James said draw night unto God and He will draw night unto you praise the Lord amen draw night unto God and He will draw night onto you so all of that you know uh uh brought me to the place that I thought that it would be it would be it would be beautiful for us to just look at a little bit on their principle of drawing before we go any further tonight so just like like I was talking about those five kingdoms you will realize that uh uh uh it has it has an ascending order it has a descending order and uh uh but as we talks about drawing tonight you will realize that uh uh for the minus to come up uh for us to be a benefit from them like I said the plant kingdom has to reach them okay the pl Kingdom has to reach down in the soil of the earth to be able to draw the mineral up and uh uh the the potassium and and uh and and all the different minerals electrolytes and all of that uh uh brother Brandon will always call them the 16 elements and uh they are all in the earth God placed them in the earth and uh and and he structure it is way way that the plant will have to reach down and draw them and then uh uh the animals will also have to reach down to the plant and draw them out of the plant and sometimes we go and eat plant and vegetables and and all of that uh uh and then we get down to the animon kidum and uh and then also almighty God step down into their human kingom but as I was thinking about uh that whole drawing uh uh principle today my mind uh got uh a little bit uh stuck on their thought when I was reading the book of James draw night onto me and I will draw night onto you you know because of the way that uh uh the grace of God has helped us with the opening of the word in the sense of uh uh the understanding of the word sometimes your mind gets to that place where uh you you get a little bit uh uh you you you really trying to try to figure out uh the best way to be able to understand this because the truth of the of the matter there is that it is not we first that draw onto God he's the one that reached down onto us and he's the one actually that is drawing us onto him praise the Lord Lord so then I started looking through uh uh different things in the scripture instead in this afternoon to be able to make a little sense of that so we will just read few quotes here before we get into our subject tonight if you would just bear with me we will start with unconditional Covenant this one just nailed it for me it nailed it it really helped me uh uh he's talking about elshad he's talking about God being elsh there the breasted one he says watch I am the breasted one just draw n unto me now so if you take the sense of the breasted one and uh uh uh uh the baby uh will be will be crying the baby will be hungry it will have to take the mother you know to just get close to the little one then you see the little one swinging in the head to be able to grab the breast or grab the bottle to be able to breast field so for us to ever draw night onto God is because he has come close praise the Lord is because he has come close there is no way in our human self we can draw night to him just the same way there is no way the minus from the earth can can can you know can can can can can come up can draw up by thems except the plant roots gets down in the earth to be able to draw them up so he's the breasted one praise the Lord he is the breasted one and that is the reason why we don't take uh uh you know Glory when God is blessing you in your prayer life or you are reading the word and you are enjoying the word and he's opening your understanding in the word you don't think that it is yourself because you spending many hours no it's because he's around his present is around and that's that is that is the Consciousness that I want to come to and I and I also want to bring you to that is because he present is around let's look at this other one great Shining Light he says and if you notice God only reveal himself to those who search and long to see him draw night unto me and I will draw night unto you said the Lord and sometimes God let things happen that's that's what I want for us to understand because it's he drawing n to be able to Brink you so what will he do he will allow things to happen God let things to happen so that we will draw unto him for God has surely ordained that certain even must take place and they will unfold just as his great time take it off praise the Lord so he will allow things to happen we might not understand it but it is him drawing us n to him he's conditioning Us Praise the Lord he's conditioning us so we can get into that channel to draw night onto him let's take another thought here also and I think it will be it uh it will be good for prayer meetings to be going on all the day long around here just everywhere for you cannot get anything from God until you get closer to God you know it is written in the scripture draw night unto me and I will draw night unto you praise the Lord amen and if we are here now uh and if we are here now for one so purpose that is to draw not unto God let do that with all that is within us draw nigh unto God now if you look at the scripture other there draw nigh onto me and I will draw now onto you it almost sound like God is saying you have to move first before I move praise the Lord no the real sense is that you move because he has moved you amen it's almost like God saying to Adam Adam Adam where are you no God knew where Adam was Adam never knew where he was praise the Lord amen it was not it was not a a a question of seeking for Adam it was just a question of Awakening him do you know actually Where You Are do we know where we are tonight praise the Lord let's take one more and then uh we will we'll turn over here blos that's the greatest time of anybody's life is just to sit down and meditate take everything off your mind if you would do that there wouldn't be so much nervousness around the country if we who just think on God draw night unto me and I will draw night unto you praise the Lord now so uh uh uh we we we also know uh the thought what brother bam say when when you are talking about him that's when he comes night so if you follow that that trench of thought you will see that he he he drive us to that place the way of drawing that unto God is thinking about his promises thinking that he is able praise the Lord amen it's I mean it's it's it's is just is just is just thinking on him meditating upon his word because that's what brings his presence night on on uh unchangeable word of God you know is as you think of him that's when he draw closer to you so just think about that if you you draw nigh to God is keeping him on your mind meditating upon his word counting him uh able to do everything that he have promised to do praise the Lord so well I pray that uh the Lord will be able to help us because Jesus said you know uh uh if he be lifted up He will draw Us Praise the Lord and you know that's the principle of drawing you know drawing don't go down drawing goes up praise the Lord if you ever had to pull water from the well you know that's that's the way it goes you know the bucket goes down and then you keep drawing like this you got to pull the bucket up so Jesus said if he be lifted up He will draw all men onto unto him so uh that is that is that is that for for that uh for that talk tonight I want to talk on uh uh the beginning the beginning of God I actually took this thought uh uh in the in the in a short subject I spoke on uh uh while I was away and then uh uh it started uh uh you know uh coming back to my mind and thinking about it now you will realize that uh uh John when he wrote his book in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Sunday we spoke a little bit on the the genology of Jesus Christ I'm hoping that this coming Sunday we can continue on uh on talking about the subject of the king uh there is there's a whole lot that we couldn't get to last Sunday so maybe by the grace of God if the Lord help us we might continue in that direction but I want you to realize that uh it was only Matthew and Luke that took uh uh the genealogy of Jesus Christ and both of them came in a very unique way and by the grace of God we going to look at that Matthew approach was very unique like I said his approach was all about uh presenting our Lord as the king I believe that the Holy Spirit had that on him for him to bring everything about the kingship of Jesus Christ and we're going to look at that as the Lord would trust us as the Lord will help us now Luke on the approach was different and uh uh uh uh Luke talk about the savior he he talk about the visitation of of the of uh the angels to uh the the the the uh the Shepherds on the hill and we realize that Luke experienc was much earlier you will realize that Luke in his account he spoke about the people that witness Jesus earlier experience he's talking about the Shepherds on the hill he spoke about uh uh uh after 8 Days Jesus had to go uh uh to the temple to be circumcised under the Covenant of Abraham they had to circumcise the little boy and there was a blind woman Hanah that was in the temple and there was also this old Prophet Simeon that was in the temple praise the Lord now so you were realized that uh all of these people they have their own peculiar experience about this child that was born so Luke had a very very detailed you know he talks very very detail in uh in in his account Mark and uh and John never played around you know uh uh uh you know the birth of Jesus we know that MK he was burden with uh with Jehovah 7 you will realize that most of the prophecy that Isaiah spoke about Jehovah 7 Mark went in their direct John on the writing was completely different that's what I want for us to dwell to tonight and there is a reason why we will get to it John on the writing was influenced by his experience on the atland of p on the island of pmos John never wrote his account until he came back from the island of pmos praise the Lord amen he never wrote his account until he came back from the island of pmos now so this introduction that John wrote here in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God John took this introduction from his experience on the atland of on the island of pmos there was something that happened and that's what I want for us to to uh to follow tonight by the grace of God Amen because when Moses wrote his account he wrote his account from an instruction of the Lord From The Vision when God took him upon the mountain and the 40 days he spent upon the mountain God be begin to show Moses by Vision what uh uh the the the beginning was like you have to know that Moses was was landed praise the Lord and I believe uh uh he was able to to to to take notes instructed by the Lord as he was showing him everything from the beginning and because it was a vision it was uh there there was there was love lot of it that was not tooo clear but God gave him an account to let us to know how the beginning was the creation of the word now John says here in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and with without him was not anything made that was made now let's let's let's try to find where John took this let's go to the Book of Revelation I've been promising you that we might we might do a revelation series uh I'm I'm still praying about it and uh we uh might go back and there take the church is book take the Book of Revelation and just and just read and and uh I think it will be good for every one of us are we together let's read Revelation chapter 1 as we will uh uh uh bring an introduction here Revelation CH 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him we have gone over this before the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sent and signified by his Angel unto his servant John so we know John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw so we know that if there is one book that Jesus himself wrote is the Book of Revelation praise the Lord he is the author of the book of Revelation John was only his scribe John was told to write the things that he saw and the things that he heard so John had his little book or tablet or whatever it is and uh as as he was seeing things he was writing it praise the Lord and uh uh uh so we see here that he he he signified by his Angel onto his seven John John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and all things that he saw blessed bless blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in for the for for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you John you are instructed to write these things and send it to the churches that are in Asia praise the Lord now so we won't have all the time to read everything here but that that's a place I want to bring you and where I want to bring you tonight is for us to be able to see that uh John as as as as a scribe here writing everything that the Lord Jesus is instructing him now another thing I want us to also underline is that the book started by the revelation of Jesus Christ and I believe that it's it's it's it's using that introduction because the ministry of Jesus Christ is continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ did not end when he ascended up praise the lord we know that the ministry of Jesus Christ contining in the book of Acts with the apostles and here we find that the revelation of Jesus Christ when I spoke on this there in South Africa I entitled it the continuation of the revelation of Jesus Christ and we are the continuation of the revelation of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord because that's the reason why we are redeemed that's the reason why he call us so we can continue what uh he's doing in this day are we together pray praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen now so you will see here that John as he's called to do this work Jesus one time told the disciples we we spoke about that what what what is what it is to you that if this man stay till I come you know there kind of for Romans that went around no John is not going to die but we know that uh you know Jesus was pointing to this time because uh this will be the time where John will see the coming of the Lord he will see it and he will experience the coming of the Lord now so we realize here from Revelation chapter 1 that John saw Jesus in the midst of the seven golden can Stak and the Seven golden canle steak is representing the seven Church ages praise the Lord amen so when we say that he's here we must believe that he is here because in Vision John saw Jesus in his in the midst of the church praise the Lord you know what John remember John remember when Jesus said in s John chapter 14 I will never leave you I will never forsake you in a vision when he saw Jesus in the midst of the seven golden candle Stak he realized that uh uh everything that Jesus said to them while he was in the flesh came more real to John praise the Lord it was more real to John in this experience than when Jesus was in his physical body walking with them on the shore of gathering praise the Lord I'll show you a few of them before we close tonight I think I get five minutes to do there five or 10 minutes I'll try my best now so John saw out of that this is where I want to bring us tonight as as uh as we will so as when John saw Jesus in the midst of the seven golden can s if you look at chapter 2 that's Revelation 2 verse1 Jesus is now going to tell John to introduce him to all the church ages so at at the beginning of every Church age Jesus gave his introduction he introduced himself to the church ages praise the Lord are we together he told John he says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus you must write these things write these things say he that holdeth the Seven Stars let the angel of the Church of Ephesus know that the one that is sending this message is the one that is holding the Seven Stars and the Seven Stars are the seven messenger of the seven Church ages are you seeing the picture so when you get to the beginning of every Church age age Jesus introduced himself said John this is my introduction to this church age Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 laisha Church age unto the angel of the Church of the laition right John pick up your pen write this onto the angel of the laisha church age praise the Lord amen send this message and let him know who send the message praise the Lord are we together and then in the introduction he was says unto the angel of the laisha church write these things said their amen the one that is bringing the message to this church age is the amen now he introduced himself to the last age as I am the finality praise the Lord I am the amen he could not introduce himself to the Ephesian Church age as the amen praise the Lord he had to introduce himself to the loudish church age because that that is the last age he introduce himself as the amen praise the Lord amen these things said the amen they faithful and Truth witness this one that is bringing the message this one that is speaking to the church age he is the amen he is their faithful and Truth witness then he said the beginning of the creation of God Amen praise the Lord amen now you now you it's it's almost like uh you know when you you uh someone is dictating and you are writing you know uh sometimes you find that you know uh uh uh you are preaching and someone is interpreting and sometimes they they interpreter get very excited because he he hears something he wished that he was not interpreting because he might go running around or rejoicing or maybe making note on that thing that he have heard praise the Lord John heard Jesus introducing himself to our age as the amen the truth and faithful witness in the beginning beginning of the creation of God praise the Lord now do you see why you see why and where John got his introduction as in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God John took it from your age he took it from the introduction of our age he okay when Jesus introduced himself to the Lish Church age he introduced himself as the beginning of the creation of God I can just only imagine in my mind that when John heard that he made a little star over there he said I have to look into this I never heard him saying this when he was a mon Us Praise the Lord that he say he is the beginning of the creation of God praise the Lord amen the beginning of the creation of God that's how Jesus introduced himself to our age what is that the beginning of the creation of God not the creation of the creatures not God creating or the beginning of creation no the beginning of the creation of God God creating himself God gave himself a beginning the one that don't have no beginning he's giving himself a beginning are we together you see that is the reason why I'm I'm coming to this is is not to be mysterious it's not to you know turn your head around your shoulder no the reason I'm I'm coming to this is even great Elohim he gave himself a good beginning we wouldn't have had a word that is standing like this if God never started right the beginning of everything is very important praise the Lord amen the beginning of everything here said the scripture is allowing us to know that God himself gave himself a beginning why because the beginning is the foundation the beginning is the birth praise the Lord amen and if God will start creation if he will if he will start anything anything that he he in his mind that he hide in his mind to express for him to start he begin with the word hallelujah praise the Lord Brother B says if you want to start a church start with the word you want to start a family begin with the word that's what he said because God himself began with the word in the beginning was was their word praise the Lord is that what the scripture says in the beginning was the word so God himself begin with the word it shows that when we begin with the word we never going into filise God are you getting the picture praise the Lord amen that's the beginning of the creation of God so when John came back from the island of pmos and he will start writing his own record of all that he experienced with Jesus he never started from Bethlehem or from Nazareth he never started from H A Manger he never spoke about the the wise man nothing John said I heard him saying he was the beginning of the creation of God if I would start my record I would say in the beginning was the word praise the Lord John got there from Jesus introduction to our age the beginning of the creation of God what is that what's the meaning of that praise the Lord simple that's what brother bam says the Theologian will call the logos is the great internal Spirit one time he fill all space he fill every word but he condemns himself into a body called the logos hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen and that was his beginning why because he was breaking into time and and anything and everything in time has a beginning so if God will come to time he has to give himself a beginning it was called the lust but it had it had a shape it had a form what was that form see what John said in uh in in in St John chapter one John saw all of these things in the vision St John chapter one whether he says all things were made by him amen and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light so thou bore in the beginning was a body of light the lust it was not a it was not an invisible form no when God was Spirit he was invisible now he's coming to time he had to be visible so the lust was a body of light are we together amen amen amen now you will see the importance of why that experience in Houston the experience that brother brandham had in Houston with d Bess the picture we have with the pillow of fire over brother brandham head praise the Lord Paul met the pillar of fire on the road of Damascus it's only written it's only recorded in the scripture but God in his Providence never allow it to be photographed why because Jesus Christ introduction to poor age was not the the beginning of the creation of God the reason why we have that in our age is because that's how he introduced himself to our age praise the Lord that's why brother Bram said over and over he says that that photo is not about me I just happen to be there he says that is about the angel of the Covenant that led the children of Israel and it even goes back to the beginning he says that logos was a form of an amber color light that was the form that God took from the beginning praise the Lord do you know what I realized recently I realized that the wise men were following the pillow of fire if you go and stud of the message you see many times brother Bram he referred to the wise men following the same sty he said is that same light that led the children of Israel hallelujah it's the same pillow of fire so you see the form that God took from the beginning came to identify him when he took a body form amen amen are we together now don't don't don't don't don't get carried away with uh with everything I'm saying my my emphasis here is that if God the great Elohim God the great intal God the one that had no date of birth if he would give himself a beginning to start time think about it now that's that's the reason why I feel that the thought is important to start time to drop into time for God to materialize himself and start to make things and start to create things start to make shape and form and all of that for God to do that he have to have a beginning the beginning is very important how we begin is very important praise the Lord that was what John captur on the island of pmos he saw it that he is the beginning of the creation of God that's what he said he is the beginning of the creation of God and John would come and said in the beginning what the word the word was with God the Word was God all things were made by him that's verse three let's look into colossian chapter 1 let's look into the book of colossian chapter 1 and see something here that that will be after your book of Philippian lay my Foundation here and then I'll start preaching amen now so you see over here in Philippian chap I mean I Chapter 1 sorry after the book of Philippian we read from verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which have made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have the Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of our sins so we realize that all of this he's talking about Jesus Christ are we together amen is that right do you realize he's talking about Jesus Christ amen then he continue on still talking about Jesus Christ he said who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature the first born is the beginning so Paul is using the same language that John heard Jesus introducing himself to the laisha church age he's using the same language let's let's go ahead a little bit again and you you will see that he's using the same language and and the reason why he's he used that same language who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created is it not the same thing that John said in St John chapter 1 all things were made by him and without him was nothing made Paul is saying the same thing here Paul was not on the island of pmos but Paul saw the pillow of fire on the road of Damascus praise the Lord and when he saw the pillow of fire he said who are thou Lord he says I'm Jesus whom you are persecuting praise the Lord amen oh I have no doubt in my mind that Paul from that time he kept asking how how how how it say that you are the pillow of fire is isn't that the same pillow of fire that met Moses in the burning bush praise the Lord I have no doubt in my mind that Jesus told him I am the beginning I'm the firstborn of every creature Hallelujah that's the beginning of God are we together when Moses said in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth that was the way he saw it in the vision when the vision got to Paul the vision got a little bit more clearer then what Moses saw it praise the Lord amen now just just keep in context what we're talking about is the beginning the important of the beginning the important of how we begin our year hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen we must not begin the year with some fale let's begin the year with the word hallelujah let's begin the year because you see in that beginning the beginning of God is the beginning of Praises because brother brandham said when God became God now he became an object of worship praise the Lord amen so let's begin with worship that's the reason why when Jesus taught the Lord's Prayer he said when you prayed said Our Father who are in heaven hallow our worship you must you must have your beginning with worship because the beginning of God was the beginning of worship amen praise the Lord when he began he created angels to worship him because now he has taken the form that he could be worshiped praise the Lord amen you see that's the reason why angels are attracted to the word the angels of God they are attracted to the word because that was the first form that God took he took the form of the word called the logos the pillow of fire it's just language is all the same we must not make it complicated praise the Lord so here is John I mean Paul here using the very same language that John use who is the image of the invisible God the first Bor of every creature by him were all things created that is in heaven that is in Earth visible h h h and and invisible whether they be Throne Dominion principality power all things were created by Him and for him that was the same thing that John said in in John 1 all things were made by him and without him was nothing made Hallelujah praise the Lord amen you see there the Alpha and Omega principle H Paul was the messenger to the alpha age amen John heard the introduction of Jesus Christ to the Omega age and we are we are the one here to witness it we are the benefactor of it hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen the beginning of God is the beginning of worship brother Bram say here let me read this and and uh then maybe I can start preaching or we close either one he said here in the message uh sep and [Music] Seed he said talking about when the morning start sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy way back before the foundation of the world what is the foundation the beginning right praise the Lord amen because brother brandham said when God took that form all his attribute you and myself was represented in that form amen amen yes why because God was expressing his thoughts he was about to express you and myself so we condescended with God that's why Jesus who said I came from God I will go back to God he never only came from God When when when when he was born by married he came from God when God condescended and became a body of light and you and myself was there God praise the lord we condescended with him we came from thought form praise the Lord you can't remember it that's why you looking at me like that that's okay praise the Lord that's okay brother bam said what happened he says that was the very same time when God took that expression then you you and myself as sons of God we shouted for Joy praise the Lord amen amen and that is the reason why every time the word is expressed in truth it must bring us a sense of Joy because that was our first expression a child of God that was expressed from the mind of God you cannot be offended at the word whether the word call your name whether the word correct you praise the Lord the only attitude that you express in the beginning was to Rejoice was to shout hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen and brother Bram said yeah he said when the morning star sang together and the son of God shout for Joy way back before the foundation of the word how do we know that wasn't that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking seing us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus Christ praise the Lord it is it's only the last day spirit that can freeze us up from rejoicing in the word praise the Lord amen but as more as we come to this reality to know that we're not just finding ourself here in church we came in the condensation of God as God was making himself known expressing himself in types and Shadow you and myself we were condescending with him hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah amen that's the reason why Jesus can you imagine Jesus was telling his disciple don't Rejoice because demons has been cast out or you healed the sake he said Rejoice because your name is in in the book all those join every one of them there just saying what name in the book praise the Lord he never understood it until on the island of pmos on the island of pmos when he broke into the into the vision of Revelation chapter 5 who is wored to take the book and to lose the seals thereof amen praise the Lord even when Jesus said it that they none of them I mean I mean that's that's that's a thing that excite the people today we want some kind of a manifestation oh yeah you know go God healed say hallelujah praise the Lord but yeah when the truth of the word is preached the El it respond to the truth of the word praise the lord we rejoice in the word because that's where we find Our Truth identification Hallelujah are we together am you see the the the impact of the vision the impact of the vision when brother bam was preaching a lot of these things during his ministry it did not impact to the people he was talking about I mean we are we are living in a a netic age and man is going to go crazy and uh you know the uh uh uh uh the people that are going to go you know be losing their mind he's talking about uh the drug world and and and and and and the kind of evil spirit and the sex spirit that will come upon the word and and and I mean all of those things that were just like I mean this William brandham you pray for the sick I mean you are just shouting at people all the time time they they kept thinking about it like that but now you and myself we are seeing the reality of what he spoke Hallelujah because he was speaking on a vision a prophet preached on a vision praise the Lord and when we see those things then it hit our mind oh yeah well that's that's what that's why the message says he said those things many years back that Jesus there telling all of this St John chapter uh 24 Jesus told them and said there will be false Christ and false prophets many will come in my name and say and say having you know they will prophesy they would do many Jesus told them all of that it never affected John until he got the vision when he got the vision of Revelation then over in first John he said little children you have heard that the Antichrist will come let me tell you he's not coming he's already here why he was speaking from a vision but Jesus told them that when Jesus was in his physical body they couldn't grab it they never hon to it but when John experienced it on the island of pmos he saw the Beast Spirit he saw Revelation chapter 13 He Saw Revelation chapter 17 he saw Revelation chapter 18 he saw all those things in the vision when he came back to the church he said little children the Antichrist is not something to come it's already here is the spirit that will deny you of Christ coming in your flesh because he said every spirit that do not confess that Jesus has come in the flesh is not of God is of the Antichrist praise the Lord you know the way the church word interprets that they say oh if you did not believe that Jesus Jesus Christ came then you that's that's the Antichrist that's not what John said because when Jesus was here it was not Jesus In the Flesh it was God In the Flesh when Jesus was here it was the fullness of God in flesh Jesus in the flesh is the church Christ in you the hope of glory that's Jesus In the Flesh so John is saying from his experience on the island of pmos that if you are not confessing daily that it is no longer I that live but Christ live in me if you are not confessing that and you are only confessing I'm weak I'm lazy oh the devil John is saying you are under an influence of the Antichrist you must be confessing every day through your tough battle oh greater is he that is in me that he that is in the word is no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me John said if you not confessing there you under an antichrist influence that is the impact of the vision that's the reason why I said on tell this word impact us it's not just to know the quot and know the story about the message but the purpose of the word is to affect our life it affected John so much that when he came back his story was completely different he could not talk like the rest of the disciple they were talking about oh we were on the sea of gilee oh we were on this sea of G he said no my people no what I saw on the island of pmos that man that was with us the messages he preached to Us Praise the Lord we were all looking for The Healing Ministry we were just only interested when he was Healing The Sick but the words that he spoke to us John got and A New Beginning he got a very new beginning he was impacted by the vision he could no longer Trace himself back to the days of Galilee to the fishing trips and and and and all of those stories he could not Trace himself back to it because say he was caught in the vision praise the Lord I'll tell you Happy New Year again happy New Year Praise the Lord in my prayer let begin with the word amen if we want to walk in Victory let be begin with the word because the word is our original beginning the word is Our Truth beginning praise the Lord amen amen all church is just the place We Gather but the word is our actual beginning the beginning of God worship is the beginning of God Jesus said when you pray when you come before the father go back to the beginning and start to worship because that's what happened in the beginning forget about your problems and start to worship identify yourself with your original beginning your problem and trials are not your beginning they just caught you in time your original beginning is worship it's praise is Thanksgiving the Lord bless you let a musician comes in the beginning was the word the word was with God praise
