[0:00] group of people
[0:02] and I can honestly say this
[0:05] I have
[0:06] in my age I'm beginning to think about
[0:09] slowing down
[0:12] and
[0:13] I've often thought
[0:15] if the time ever come
[0:18] that I could really settle down and just
[0:21] sit down in a church
[0:23] and enjoy fellowshipping enjoy the word
[0:26] where would I go
[0:28] who would I choose to set under
[0:32] and I don't believe
[0:34] that I would have to go and look very
[0:36] far
[0:37] but y'all would have to pray for me
[0:40] because your Winters are brutal
[0:44] amen now my wife don't know that
[0:51] amen so you would have to pray for me
[0:54] and not only in the weather case but my
[0:57] wife also
[1:03] brother brother
[1:05] Hernandez says if I can make it here
[1:08] brother you can make it also so
[1:12] church I'm not going to hold you any
[1:14] longer I I think those of you that have
[1:18] been here with me before
[1:20] over the years since uh 2000
[1:24] I think you know that I love you
[1:26] and appreciate you
[1:28] and
[1:30] every time I get a call
[1:33] will you come to Minneapolis
[1:35] my heart is already on fire
[1:40] I am going to share one more thing with
[1:43] you and this is personal
[1:46] it was on the way into church yesterday
[1:48] and Brother Juan called me
[1:51] and he didn't know how I don't say he
[1:54] didn't know how but he
[1:56] approached the subject that I'm going to
[1:59] talk to you about
[2:01] trying to be as smooth
[2:04] as it could be
[2:07] and he asked about the cost of the
[2:10] airplane tickets
[2:12] it was concerned I'm sure
[2:15] how am I going to reimburse brother
[2:17] Prater
[2:18] for his expense and getting here
[2:22] traveling isn't like it used to be
[2:24] right it's like everything else
[2:28] so I asked brother well why worry about
[2:30] it
[2:31] and then a few more words are spoken I
[2:34] said well you can pay me back
[2:37] by coming to Fort Smith Arkansas in
[2:41] October
[2:42] of this year
[2:44] and he is on the roster to preach so
[2:47] y'all get in mind to let him go
[2:50] but more than that come with him
[2:53] get in that bus that he's been talking
[2:56] about
[2:59] and come to Arkansas
[3:02] where the reason we're having our
[3:05] meeting in October is that
[3:07] it's about 110 degrees there now
[3:12] and that gets a little uncomfortable
[3:15] even for me
[3:16] so I want you all to know that you would
[3:19] treat you so many ways you'll have to
[3:21] like one of them
[3:25] but it's been a pleasure over there it's
[3:27] been a good journey
[3:28] some of you this may be my first time
[3:31] having met you or fellowship with you
[3:36] but I love you
[3:38] and the Lord does too
[3:41] and I spill I I just feel a real close
[3:45] Association
[3:47] with each and every one of you
[3:50] and if I start calling names and selling
[3:53] this person that person how
[3:55] how you have impressed me over the over
[3:57] the years
[3:59] well we would be here the rest of the
[4:00] night

[8:13] but I saw it
[8:15] and as I was looking at that Shore so
[8:18] peaceful and so quiet
