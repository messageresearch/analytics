bless you all come please take your seat while we are still standing can we reach out for our bibles hebrews 11 11 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise be to god shall we be seated our lord and our master jesus we thank you for having ahead and answered our prayers already for we know whenever we open our mouths that there is a god who is listening yes you have never let us down you have been faithful you have kept your word of promise towards us and we are so grateful we praised you tonight we worship and we bless the father in jesus name may you come and honor yourself in our midst tonight and speak to us in jesus name amen praise be to god happy to see you guys once again it's always a joy to be in the house of the lord there is no better place to be other than gathering before his throne of grace now this book of hebrews we have just read talks about nothing but faith and as you continue to read on as we talk about abraham talks about noah and how god felt on it whenever faith was expressed by his children now when you get to hebrews 12 verse 1 right after verse 11 it talks about wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do have so easily beside us and let us run with patience the race that has been said before us praise be to god a race has been set before us and with patience let us run this race that has been set before us i loved running a lot when i was in school i loved taking to the tracks i was a very good athlete even though i didn't receive any honest but i loved it for very good reasons both in the tracks and outside of it because the faster i could run the better it was for me growing up i had a lot of challenges i was really a very very bad boy so but i loved athletics a lot and of all the races there are i would want to compare this race that has been said before us to the relay the relay you have someone run bring the stick sometimes i would forget and i'll say a button when i see a button no i'm talking about that stick that is what i know someone brings the baton to one person he takes it runs and gives another person and that is how it continues and i want to compare this race we are running this race that has been set before us to a relay there was a story about a woman that appeared in a competition and they had prepared for this competition so well and they were determined to take a price and she was the last in the set to finish the race the first person who ran ran the race in a very good time it was four by four hundred in other words you go around the field once and then you hand over the baton to the next person and then she was the last person as soon as she took the baton something happened and then she fell flat on her face and she sustained bruised in her hands and on her knees and when she got up she felt so badly that she did not even see where the button was and as she turned looking for it one of the athletes just ran took the baton and handed it over to her at that point you would think that it was over of course everybody goes in the competition to win a medal at this point she was last to say the list there was no way she could catch up so the easiest thing for her to have done was to call it quit but she didn't do that she took the baton and she started limping and running and she was crying and she was bleeding and she was just running and bleeding saying to herself oh how i have let my people down we have left home thousands of miles to come for this competition we have left daddy we have left mommy we have left our friends for this competition we have been training for this competition for a year now and we are poised to have won this competition i have messed it up and yet she wouldn't give up she was running and thinking to herself oh how she maybe how the police were disappointed how she let them down and how they were probably going to meet her and then vent their anger on her but she still never gave up she was running limping crying as she inched towards the cross i mean the finish line and as she was just getting there and crossing the line her colleagues were there and as she was whipping they just rallied around her put their arms around her and said no do not cry it was meant to be they started encouraging her she was whipping she said i'm sorry i disappointed they said no don't worry about it and then not only what did she receive praise from the people that came to support them but she had a standing ovation from almost everybody that was at the stadium praise be to god and when i look at the race that we are running i couldn't compare it to anything but to the relay when you think about this race we are running and you think of how we have gotten to this point how many people have lost their lives to get this message to you that sometimes you feel so down and out you feel so discouraged but yet when you think of how people were fed to the lions and yet they would not give up people refused to live so they could hand this button over to you people were imprisoned so they could hand this button over to you then you know that the message will have believed the word of god is dripping with blood and when you think about it alone it's difficult to quit you stay in your course you may be limping you may be crying but the good thing about this race we are running is that there is a murder for everybody that crosses the line praise be to god the miracle is not only result in the first second and tenth but whoever crosses the line there is a medal for you praise be to god amen so we are running a race and when i talk about it what on earth would make a woman or would make somebody that is given the option to live and yet would choose to die for what they believe to be the truth then i know that it has to do with faith faith and tonight we are going to talk about faith amen praise be to god faith now faith the substance of things hopeful the evidence of things not seen the only way the only way to get faith is by the word there is no other way around it faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god there is no other way around it i used to think that miracles give faith but the brother said miracles don't give faith they only increase your faith so if there is no faith you will rejoice with the miracles and after that you go back to your arrows and live in that mess but if there is faith the first day it comes and it lifts you up praise be to god but the things that we know would give us faith how often do we do it sometimes we don't know where our bibles are until it is sunday or until this is wednesday and we are coming to church we hardly read our bibles we can spend our day playing games watching movies on the internet doing all sorts of things being on the chat line but when it comes to the word of god we have very little time and this is what is going to help us the things that do not help us they are the things that we spend time on but the things that we know would help us in our work with god we don't do them now sometimes we think that iniquity is knowing what you shouldn't do and then you doing it brother branham said that knowing what is right and failing to do it is also iniquity so when you know something is wrong and you do it it's iniquity and when you also know something is right and yet you will not do it it's iniquity knowing what is right to do and yet you will not do it for goodness sake why do we even come to church you come expecting god to speak to you god speaks and yet you will not act on it it was better you didn't even come praise be to god amen we are living in an age where there are a lot of voices calling for attention so the devil will make sure that the things that will help you you don't give hit to it he will keep you so busy working schooling cleaning cooking eating and the very thing that will help you you would not do it because he knows the more faith he has you have the less he has to deal with you because faith genuine faith rests on the word of god praise be to god we are talking about faith tonight and i'm taking this inspiration from the message the prophet preached faith is the substance of things hoped for now we have talked about faith in this house a lot of times and i like the way the prophet put some of these things using the five natural senses i loved it on sunday when the lawyer put those the diagram was so beautiful i loved it it was very nice now there are five natural senses and the first sense of the spirit is just to help us contact this earth and the spiritual world but there is another world praise be to god we are not going into that tonight and i'm going to use the five natural senses to establish a foundation i'll keep within my time i'll not go even five minutes above praise be to god now faith has no substitute faith is a must it's a must there are there is no two ways about it for you to receive your healing you need faith for you to please god you need faith in for nothing at all i mean can you tell me what child of god you would be if your intention is not to please god if you have a different intention other than pleasing god i would want to know what that is for the bible says without faith no man can please god and every child of god wants to please god so faith is a must yes in your daily work with god you need faith if to to have daily victories you need faith so faith is a must it's not when you feel like it now i'm using the five natural senses to establish a ground here let's take our sense of sin now i can see that there is a wall clock over there i can see it there is no way you can tell me that i am not seeing it because i am looking at it it's definite i'm looking at the clock so there is no way you can convince me that i am not seeing the clock now those days we used to go fishing and sometimes um it rains and then the water fills the dam and then we go in and to catch mud fish i don't know how many of you know mad fish it's a very black big slippery fish and then we go into the muddy waters to catch them now you are in the muddy water up to west level and your hands are in the water you are not seeing beneath it's your hands which are down there and then you are just working your way through and sometimes you catch and it will miss and when you get grip of it you know you have caught it your eyes are not seen beneath the water you are not seeing it but there is another sense that is telling you that you have gotten a hold of it and there is nothing that will tell you that you are okay you have not caught it so i am holding the fish under it and i know i am holding it and my sense of touch is saying that yes you are holding the fish there is nothing in the world that can tell me otherwise because i know that i am holding it praise be to god when we move there when there is music playing my eyes do not see the sound i don't feel the sound but i have another sense which tells me that there is music playing because i can hear it and it is definite you couldn't convince me otherwise because i'm hearing it praise be to god you can put on a perfume in the house nobody is there with you but once you walk through the door another sense my sense of smell tells me that you are wearing a perfume my eyes are not seeing the smell my ears are not hearing the smell i am not feeling the smell but there is a sense that can tell me that you have put on a perfume praise be to god and so it is with taste so it is we taste now these are definite we are talking about faith tonight and faith is not a myth a definite sense you know when it is there and you know when it is not there you know whether you have it or not it is a definite sense it does not play on emotions the substance of things hopeful the evidence of this not seen if you are seeing it is sufficient if you can see it then there is no faith it's like you holding on to that fish in the muddy waters and your eyes are not seeing it but you know it is there that is what faith does that when faith has taken a hold of it even though the eyes are not saying it you know that by the grace of god you have caught it faith is a definite sense praise be to god faith the power of god said i don't know if i'm going ahead of myself but that is fine is the sixth sense it is the supersense it is superior to all the senses thank you there is nothing like it yes and even though my eyes are seeing something and you can't convince me it's not there sometimes their eyes would lie to you sometimes they lie to you sometimes your sense of touch would lie to you sometimes your sense of hearing will lie to you sometimes your sense of test would lie to you but faith would never lie to you and the problem of god has made us to understand that faith is more definite than all the senses but you know what our problems are sometimes we try to believe more in the taste we see we try to believe more in the things we hear if we can believe the natural senses which are inferior which are inferior to the spiritual sense to faith why can't we believe that why can't we believe they're spiritual because they are inferior and we believe in them but there is something that is by far higher and more superior than all the senses that we have in the natural ways so you don't have to see to believe because you know you're not spelling you are not seeing a perfume you are smelling it and you know it is there so why do you want to see before you believe why do you want to see before you believe sin is not believing you don't have to see it praise be to god praise the lord the lord jesus told thomas that because you have seen you have believed but blessed is he they have not seen but yet has believed thank you jesus if you can see it there is no faith but faith comes in when you don't see it but yet you know it is there it is not a guessing work you are not guessing it you are holding on to it you know it is there and nobody can tell you otherwise praise be to god that is what faith does it's a deathly sense praise god now some people think that positive thinking is faith positive thinking is no faith positive thinking is as good as it can be don't have to be a christian to think positively we have muslims who think positively we have um hindus there are people who don't even belong to any religion and they think positively and you can't serve god with positive thinking brother abraham said faith is positive it's positive but positive thinking is not faith it's good to be a positive thinker positive thinking is just you it's just your effort it's resting on your ability on logic adding one plus one giving you two and you can see you can see i mean something that makes sense to you that is not faith faith is positive but remember that positive thinking is not faith embryo goes on to talk about sometimes people have hope instead of faith and you think you have faith but you only have hope there are two different things here and i try to look out hope is a feeling of expectation just a feeling of expectation remember that faith has nothing to do with your feelings here hope is a feeling of expectation and a desire that something good is about to happen but what faith does faith takes out the feeling praise be to god it takes out the feeling and it replaces it with the word amen and you know that it is not your feeling you know that is that says the lord and as the prayer of god said that says the lord faileth not when you are sick and you are being prayed for you don't have to feel like you are getting well to receive your healing against all odds you would believe because it is the word of god it does not have to make sense to you if it makes sense to you then that is something else but against all us against all us you say believe that it is going to happen because the word of god says so praise be to god we are talking about faith tonight now there is something i want us to look at as we go down as the prophet god said there are two powers god and satan god oppressed with faith satan oppressed with fear so faith is a tool in the hands of god and fear is a true in the hands of satan now fear let me say this there are a lot of places in the bible where you see the fear of god the fear of god the fear of god that is not the type of fear i'm talking about i used to have one english tutor who told me that no word has a meaning that every word takes its meaning from the sentence the sentence in which it finds itself and that makes sense to me so the context in which you find that word tells you what that word means so fear here when the bible says fear god is just to stand in out of god is to reverence god so that is not the fear i am talking about here so know that there is a distinction here so the devil uses fear as is true of oppression praise be to god and when we talk of fear you know it's not like maybe you are driving on the highway and then you slide on a 10 sheet of ice and then you miss your heart beat that is not what i'm talking about or you find yourself in a very high tower and then you look down and you just that is not what i'm talking about but for you you know there are people that just have this fear of something bad going to happen at any time they fear every shadow that passes by and they fear their own shadow for every time they are thinking of something evil coming thinking of something right somebody coming after them the devil uses that too so much against the children of god and i would want us and you wonder fear as i try to look at the meaning is an unpleasant emotion and the word emotion here again feeling caused by the belief that something bad is going to happen and i became a little curious i said let me look at what the belief means belief means family health opinion or conviction that something bad is going to happen you are holding onto it firmly family you are convicted that something bad is going to happen in fact when i looked at it it was almost like looking at faith whereas faith is positive in this sense is negative because when faith is holding on to something it must surely come to pass and then think of it this way if i had my own way i would say fear is equal to negative fate or faith in reverse it's like you are expressing faith but negatively and you wonder why that fear fear is so so so strong it's a very strong weapon yes and you have to fight fear the way you would fight cancer if you were ever told you have it it's a very very strong demon the demon of fear now when faith takes root it brings results and you wonder why fear when it has also taken roots produces results we saw that in the life of job when he said for the things which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of has come upon me that is how strong fear can be there are things that you are so much afraid of it's like you are inviting them you are inviting them you need to fight fear it is not something good to live with there is no pride in saying oh me i'm afraid i fear this no fight it if you know you have a spirit of fear fight it i had a friend he was a teacher in a um in in in in a school um at jss a junior secondary school as we used to call them in those days i don't know if they still exist in ghana now when i when i came to accra i left the northern region came to accra there was a war between the two major tribes in that part of the country and i heard that one afternoon they were in the house when a shout went forth that all the customers are coming they are in town with their weapons oh and the people just started jumping from their best jumping those who were cooking jumping from the kitchen people going through the windows and two blocks away there was a police station and they were all gathering at the police station and when they got there they were doing a head count and there was this his wife um forgot the name then the wife said i have not seen george i have not seen george and i said where is george he said george was in the house he said oh where is he i said i don't know but we were in the house together and then they said what are the men praise be to god you know in those settings when they call for the men they are calling for something else and the men some men were drawing back and then some came forward with their weapons they said let's go to the house when they got to the house george was lying on the bed i don't know how many of you have had a bad dream before where you see yourself lying down and you just want to get up and it's like something is pressing you down so george was lying on the bed with his eyes open and then he was just shaking he was there shaking he was paralyzed with fear fear would only kill you fear is nothing to entertain praise be to god fight fear like you are fighting the devil praise be to god i have attended seminars where i heard of people coming to say oh there was there was a position i was qualified for the position but out of fear i chose to be the second out of fear fear would rob you of your victory fear would rob you of your success fear would rob you of your joy in christ fear thank you jesus it's not anything to entertain fear is of the devil amen fear is not of god praise be to god praise the lord so the devil would always use that instrument to get your attention in one way or the other but children of god know no fear praise be to god i remember when the children of god got to kadesh banya and they were supposed to go and despite the promised land oh they went they saw the giants the malachi's the zebra size and what have you but guess what again fear fear god had given them the promised land it was this to go and inherit but here fear stood in the way a lot of the times your blessings are behind enemy lines a lot of the times your blessings are behind enemy lines they are yours they have been given to you but the enemy is in the way do not let fear stop you if you have to fight and die fight and die amen do not live in fear praise be to god do not let go life come in your way and when the devil comes your way tell him for every goliath there is a slingshot there is a slave shot of faith they will bring that goliath down do not look at the size of the enemy do not look at the stone keep your focus on the promise keep your focus on the word that was how caleb and joshua please god they were not looking at the size of the of the enemy they were keeping their eyes on the promise keep your eyes on the promise keep your eyes on the word praise be to god i'll be closing the next five five minutes or so i listened to joe biden's pick for the defense secretary uh retired general lloyd austin and when he was retiring in his speech he said something i don't know whether because i love stories stories come to me or i go looking for them but somehow we got to meet so he said something and that caught my attention he said in 2003 they were in iraq and they were caught up they were pinned down by enemy fire the enemies just they were just caught up and he said at a time there was one eighteen is a 19 or 20 year old young soldier and when they started firing he jumped into the enemy's side and then after the fight and everything he called that young soldier and he asked him why is it that when we got into the enemy territory and they started firing you jump to the enemy's side and then he asked the soldier were you afraid and they also just said yes i was scared to death but when i heard the voice of the commander i knew that it shall be well praise be to god oh when i heard the voice of the commander i knew that i shall be well this takes me back to the story of the athlete who were talking about that you get to a point i don't know how many of you have ever gotten there that you know that you are bruce and you are battered and yet you are not giving up because you hear the voice of the commander and you know that it shall be well [Applause] just limping running crying having sleepless nights but you hear the voice of the master and you know that it shall be well praise be to god oh that sometimes people will look at you and they will laugh at you and they ask themselves does his god really live does his god really exist see how he's suffering see how she's suffering oh praise be to god like job's life told him why don't you catch your god and die did i tell you why don't you cast your god and die why don't you leave your god that you hear the voice of the master the voice of the commander-in-chief of the army of the lord who has never lost a battle and you know that it shall be well oh sometimes you get so disheartened you want to throw in the towel you are holding the button you want to just cast it away that you hear the voice of the master and you know it shall be sometimes you are sick to the point of death and the doctors will tell you that is the end but you hear the voice of the master and you know it shall be well praise be to god that against all us against all us you hear the voice of the commander-in-chief and you know that he shall the world praise be to god we are serving a living god we have not believed carnival the lord our god is our life our god is not dead praise be to god [Applause] remember we are serving a living god as the musicians come faith faith that is faith in the house praise be to god amen thank you jesus it shall be well whatever it is that you are going through put your hopes in god god would never lead you astral let your faith be anchored in the world for heaven and earth shall pass away but the word of god will never pass away and if your faith is unclear in the word i don't care the storms you go through praise be to god those thumbs will pass but you will remain to declare the glory of god god speaks god speaks most of the times we don't listen most of times we don't hear him but if you can hear the voice of god tonight god is telling you that it shall be whatever the storms are whatever the problems are whatever difficulties

the commander praise the lord and he says all is well amen we just want to thank the lord what a worth to come after the prayer meeting tonight praise the lord you know but then talking about the relay i just think uh hebrew chapter 11 is a relay because paul started talking from god to adam from adam to abel and he just went in the relay throwing faith from one to another amen praise the lord i just think it was beautiful tonight but you know just like brother dan said and and we know by the word of god [Music] that the substance faith is a substance what is the substance of fame it's a word if it is not the word is not faith the substance of faith is what god has said and the contracts here is that fear do not have no substance fear is just nothing and you see that's the reason why we are in an age that is having one of the most dangerous idol the idol of this age is nuttiness the people don't believe anything it's just it's just vague it's open it's empty there is nothing in it that's what fear is there is nothing in fear fear does not have a substance [Music] praise the lord it don't have a substance it's just an an an an imagination a belief that have got a hold of you but there is nothing in it why the substance of faith is the word of god praise the lord the word that's why paul said in in in hebrew 11 the word we have today god had made it by faith by faith this word came into existence god has to believe his own word god has to say amen to his promise when he said let there be light he said amen there's going to be light because the word of god can never fall to the ground it can never fail god is his word that just what it is church [Music] let's just stand on our feet and sing there tonight oh every promise in the book is my [Music] yeah i am trusting in

hallelujah tonight [Music] yes [Music] i'm living by faith [Music] praise the lord praise the lord amen amen knowing that the word that was given to us in this age is god's own word amen he that declared the end from the beginning has spoken to us he that declared things even before they came to pass has spoken to us you know i was thinking the other day way back when brother branham says a woman in a purple dress you know what i was thinking in my mind how much the angels went to work to influence that lady to make her the choice of of a dress because a prophet he gave a prophet a vision 1933 and the angels went to work to bring it to pass that same god that spoke in a vision to brother branham and gave the cotter the shirt that brother biscuit would wear on that hunting trip is the same god that called out a purple dress is the same god that have promised you the holy ghost it's the same god that i've said i will never leave you i will never forsake you praise the lord now if we can see those ones coming to pass then everything that god has promised you you can hold to that if god will be so particular to give a color of a dress praise the lord brother and said he never even realized that his wife put the checkabout shirt in his clothes but because god said it god show it to a prophet there is no way there could be a mistake in that vision there had to be a boy with a checkable shirt they had to be a woman with a purple dress they have to be a bride they have to be a bride they have to be a young virgin bride that is going to take a rapture one of these days praise the lord if the angels were at work to bring that promise to pass amen i believe that the angels are our work amen to bring my promise to pass amen everything that concerns my body change praise the lord god is working on it he has everything in his control he declared things before they even happened he that declared the end from the beginning he's not into our time that's the reason why never put time never put god on your calendar don't do it because god is out of the time cycle he's out of the time cycle he's not into your 24 days i mean 24 hours a day 30 days 31 days a month god is not into that he's out of that cycle all you can do just believe take him by his word and say he that have promised will never fail the lord bless you let's go in the peace of the lord we look to see you on sunday morning living by faith in jesus above [Music] me [Music] i'm [Music] trusted the son of god i'm living by faith [Music] walking jesus eyes rescue me oh yes i am covered covered by his block walking by faith [Music] and i'm [Music] jesus has rescued me [Music] oh i am covered [Music] you
