morning uh i just want to appreciate brother juan brother scott everybody for inviting us uh told brother juan when he's calling me he said well we might do a a couple's banquet and this and that and i said brother i said i'm just glad i'm coming i said don't don't worry i'll i'll preach once i'll preach 10 times i don't care whatever you want me to do but we just want to be here and we so enjoyed that couples meeting last night and i'm sitting there thinking you know next time he does one whether i'm the preacher or not i should be here bring my wife come on down and and try to encourage my daughter me and then brother scott said my son that'd be awesome a little revival family revival in in minnesota praise the lord anyway we just appreciate everybody thanks for the hospitality and we're glad to be here this morning if we could before we get started i'd like to i have a video that i want everybody to watch and um so brother jordan if you could go ahead and play that it's just a little video to check your uh you know i'm not sure what the word would be called but your attention span maybe to pay attention and they want you to count how many basketballs are tossed and it says right here okay here we go count how many times the players wearing white past the ball how many times the players wearing white pass the ball pay attention don't say anything just watch count the correct answer is 16 passes did you spot the gorilla for people who haven't seen or heard about a video like this before about half missed the gorilla if you knew about the gorilla you probably saw it but did you notice the curtain changing color or the player on the black team leaving the game let's rewind and watch it again [Music] [Applause] here comes the gorilla and there goes a player and the curtain is changing from red to gold when you're looking for a gorilla you often miss other unexpected events hey man you can stop it there the monkey business illusion yeah that's the monkey business illusion how many didn't even see the gorilla several people did not see the girl the first time i watched this i did not see the gorilla i was so focused on counting that ball yeah amen how many saw the curtain change colors just a few and then how many also saw the player with the black shirt leave amen well praise god so you can see that's a good little example of perception we don't always see what we think we're seeing or we don't always get all the information that we think we're getting amen when the police the police know that so when they investigate an accident scene many times there could be five eyewitnesses eyewitnesses and they all have a different story and so they have to learn how to try to put all this together because it's just that we don't always see everything that we're looking at is that interesting yeah especially in relationships right many times we perceive something the wrong way and it's a big deal so we don't always uh see what we're looking at or or see it all so i have a couple of pictures i'd like to bring one of the pictures up here if we could the first one on the light spectrum okay here's the light spectrum now i'm not a scientist and i don't know a whole lot about it there's probably people here that know so much about it that i don't know but what i do know is that in the light spectrum all these things are there gamma rays x-rays ultraviolet rays infrared rays radar fm tv shortwave am so there are all these things within the light spectrum but we are limited by our sight to only see visible light and that is this little area of the entire light spectrum the light spectrum is this huge we see this much so because we live in a atmosphere excuse me in a dimension the third dimension light time and matter so we've been limited amen that's why the scripture says when jesus when god came down he came down a little bit below the angels so he dropped down out of a higher dimension and he walked inside of jesus the man amen became god elohim was in this man he condescended down below the angels and became in the flesh man amen so we are limited by light time and matter our eyesight our as brother branham said we had five uh inlets to contact our earthly home with feel taste smell hear and and whatnot and so uh all we can see within the entire spectrum you can't see tv coming through here right although brother brown picked it up and he told us a long time ago he said but there is tv there are movies going through here in another realm we just can't see them right so then if we can't see all that stuff we that means when the angels many times they're here we don't see them is that right so now this is the interesting thing that i think is interesting is out of the lights out of the light spectrum that we see what we would call visible light we see the rainbow colors the seven colors now can we go to the next slide please or a picture so there's the prism a three-sided prism anytime light goes through a three-sided prism or like when it rains it refracts light and when it refracts light what happens is a rainbow takes place right so when light is coming in and light what we call light this is light but it's actually light is actually derived from three colors cyan magenta and yellow so it takes these three colors to make light are you with me so when light refracts through a prism out comes seven colors praise the lord so we know that brother branham told us that god is perfected in a triune being not a trinity like they teach but a triune being father son and holy ghost so all three father son and holy ghost they meant together make one light amen not three different beings but you understand the office of father son and holy ghost god is the only complete father son of the holy ghost in the office so when the light is refracted out comes seven colors amen and that's why the bible says the seven spirits of god the seven seers of god so now within the within the light spectrum we have seven ages and we have seven messengers and the seven messengers amen were what they were eyes they were eyes that could see amen so god gave the earth gave the the the church eyes throughout each age a a a gift where they could see light amen now you're hearing me okay praise the lord that's we're done with that now if we could perhaps we'll stand this morning and read a couple scriptures ephesians uh let's take ephesians chapter one yesterday i for our friday night i forgot my bible and i used this big print bible so this morning i purposely left my bible behind i like this bible ephesians one i want to put one on my pulpit back home verse 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ that's our position in christ in heavenly places amen zachariah chapter four we'll just take a quick uh reading there verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see us thou so now hear god the angel of the lord is speaking to this man zachariah let's pray heavenly father we pray that you'd add the blessing to your reading of your word we pray lord god that you administer every heart father many were up late last night but father help them lord to be able to receive this morning lord god we don't want anything holding us back from hearing what the spirit saith to our hearts lord god that you might have that on way and speak this morning we pray in jesus christ's name amen god bless you may be seated so here this the the spirit of the lord is now speaking to this prophet he says what see us thou so now god knows that we are limited to in our eyesight he knows that we can only see in a third dimension but now he also knows how to get attention of a prophet and to show them something and the prophet what a prophet is a seer they have eyes they can see and so now he says what see us down and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it so god is showing him a vision and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and i speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knoweth thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zero zer i don't really know how to say the word jerubal saying not by might not by nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone there of with shouting's crying grace unto it grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts had sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things now brother brown preaches the message uh god in simplicity and he brings this out that this is our god operating in in small things and through simplicity but doing mighty works he said for they shall rejoice and shall say the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth and we can pick that up in revelations chapter one as well but we won't turn with me to second kings chapter six second kings and chapter six in verse 15 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth beholden hosts can pass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him i'll ask my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw now remember now there's a seer standing there a prophet a seer he sees the host of heaven the young man is standing there who's limited by light time and matter who's limited in his eyesight he sees the syrian army but he doesn't see the host of heaven and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around about elisha and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he says oh excuse me let's go back to verse 17. and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see praise the lord and and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots round about elisha now i want to speak this morning on the ministry of angels again part two and uh there are several dimensions in the light in excuse me that we don't see we don't see the fourth dimension the fifth or sixth seventh dimension our eyes are limited to what the like spectrum allows us to see amen so by god's grace he has provided amen through the church ages he has provided seven messengers that that could see whose eyes were opened and they could see the seventh angel the seventh seal he was a prophet seer amen when the top of the pyramid in the vision of junior jackson he had a dream and the top of the pyramid was cut open with a with a crowbar and down on the inside there was a white rock and he said no one has ever seen inside of this rock yet referring to the revelation of the word of god and praise the lord and brother branham is sent back west to come back to get the visitation of seven angels to come back in east to preach the opening of the seals that we might see jesus and his program amen are we together praise the lord god knows as i was saying god knows that we are limited in our eyesight therefore we are told to walk by faith amen all things are about possible to them that can believe we're in a challenge we have to believe we have to have faith because all this is happening around us there's angels in this room but we must believe they're here because that's the only way most of us will ever see them is by our faith praise the lord because most of us are not prophets although some people see angels and some people have seen the pillar of fire praise the lord i have never seen the pillar of fire but the interesting thing is is my brother who's not a message believer has seen the pillar of fire all over me so and and and that's that's nothing to say about brother flint i'm just a brother i'm a believer but the pillar of fire is with the church they have taken pictures not just with brother branham but they have pictures of the pillar of fire amen and i've spoke to brothers personally who have seen angels excuse me so perception now so we are limited by sight but we are also limited by our perception as what we saw in the in the illustration of the monkey so sometimes we're looking at something very plainly and our information that we have we believe in a certain thing and this is what we're seeing but yet there could be something else happening we didn't see the monkey we didn't see the the curtain change but it happened [Music] you were all sitting here and some of you didn't see those things yet those things happen right before your eyes interesting yes and that is why god can come into a church setting like this this morning and one person can be moved on powerfully by the spirit of god the very person sitting next to them feel nothing see receive nothing and nothing happened to them because they're not connected properly praise the lord and if our mind is busy doing other things many times we miss and we don't recognize the unfailing realities of the living god one time when i was years ago i was troubled about something my mind was full of business and driving down the road and my little children were with us and they were worshiping the lord in the back seat because me and my three oldest children they were in the back seat and worshipping the lord i was frustrated with business my mind was full we got home and get out of the car my little boy gets out i look at him he's just weeping weeping probably 10 years old 11 somewhere in there and i look at him and he goes oh dad wasn't that an amazing presence of the lord and i thought wow lord i didn't feel you i didn't sense you i didn't know you were there god forgive me god came into the car those three children were anointed by the spirit of god and i was driving and i sensed nothing i felt nothing i got nothing and you know that that's true because sometimes you come out of a service and a brother or a sister will be testifying my goodness what a powerful move of god and yet in your mind you're thinking what kind of a message was that and one time i one time it was perfect i was really tired and and i used to watch a lot of lonnie jenkins videos because they sent them to me and i i was up one night and i was watching a video but i was really tired and i was thinking while he was preaching or teaching i was thinking man that seemed like he's lost that that click there that that whatever and later on i thought you know what i better watch that again because i was tired and i watched it again i was on the edge of my seat amen oh my goodness i was on fire what was the difference my perception what i was really seeing it's all the same it was the same word but now there was some spirit there and that's why it's so important that we come to church expecting we come to church the house of god asking god i have a need help me praise the lord years ago i had a couple of we had a couple of uh donny reagan tapes that that blessed our heart and we were going down into idaho and down there the church was failing they were dying there was just a couple of families left and they were struggling they're doing very good now and it was in my heart i wanted to help these people and we went down there and i was preaching to them in the living room and they're sitting in their chairs arms like this like almost like can you hurry up and shut up so we can get back to whatever i mean they're just lounging and i thought wow god help us because i know that the gift of god belongs to god it doesn't belong to me but the gift of god is operated by the individuals the people and then i saw so i thought okay i know what we can do and i was praying and i said hannah let's get together and we got together with my brother-in-law and sister-in-law we sat down and we watched a video of brother donnie reagan preaching and man we got i mean we went into glory and we had a prayer meeting and i mean we just called out to god such an anointing such a powerful move of god so i thought okay so we invited some other brothers from the church and let's sit down and watch it and and this older man he was sitting there you know sometimes our age kill us because we get to think that we know so much and sometimes our our reasoning power kill our faith because we've been around so long and so now we play the other tape i'm expecting revival we had revival tonight before we're going to break into final revival we're going to get back into church i'm going to preach and we're gonna we're gonna go into another glory and then all of a sudden we're watching it and it just no feel there man we just couldn't get into the spirit of god as soon as the tape was over the old man's coming did you notice that preacher his hair never got messed up moved his head around all the and i thought now i know why because he's sitting there in the skeet of the in the seat of scoffing he's sitting there in the seat of unbelief he bringing his unbelief and i was a brother i'm not putting him out don't get me wrong he was just in the wrong channel his perception was wrong he didn't know what he was seeing he didn't know what he was hearing praise the lord so perception is an important thing hallelujah in the case with elisha and geheza both are looking at the syrian army but both are seeing two different scenarios elisha his eyes were open and he he could see but gehey's his eyes were limited so gahe's perception was much different than elijah's perception are you hearing me that's why the prophet of god we're preaching and one time he's preaching and all of a sudden he says he stops and he says the angel of god is here he said he's standing right over there by that man [Music] and he says can't you people see him it's so plain to him there is a man standing there that's the angel of god and he's like can't you people see him he's right there and he would come up on the platform and stand there by brother branham the angel of god he would be preaching he said i are talking i'm saying i'm waiting for him to come then all of a sudden he's here how does he know he's there he's standing there stand up brother juan so all of a sudden he's talking i'm waiting for him to come now appear the angel we won't worship this guy he's our brother so all of a sudden stay here all of a sudden here is the angel the people don't see him but he's there and now somebody come up brother jesus your turn come on up we might as well put him in the hot water too he's going to sneak off to the philippines we'll pray he'd come back to minnesota come over here brother now he's the one that come up and i'm brother brown i get the good job well he's the angel that's even a better job and this is the brother with the infirmity or the need just like most of us sitting here we have a need but now this man came to church because he wants god to meet him he wants god to deliver him to help him to heal him whatever he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that god keeps his promises and that he's not a man that he could lie amen so he put his name he got a prayer card and now he's standing before the prophet now the prophet don't know the man but now all of a sudden something happens because he's a seer with the gift in his life that god put there now all of a sudden he starts to see the angel's standing right there watching over everything the presence is super strong the patient that comes first usually scared to death he said don't fear he won't hurt you he can't see him but now all of a sudden he feels him but now all of a sudden there starts to it he feels him if he is a believer the doubter they're the one that come forward to try to challenge they feel nothing so they stand there bold not even knowing they're in the presence of god and now here he is standing here and now our discernment starts to come your name is jesus is your name jesus i got that part right but i got to ask him where you're from he's going to the philippines i don't know and brother branham didn't know and then brother venom would out of his voice he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart the faith would rise up and the man could take his healing god bless you brothers thank you [Applause] but then brother venom would say i don't know what did he tell you whatever he told you you better listen to it he'll go back to tape and he'll listen to it again what did i say here's a man that would have to go listen to his tapes many times to even know what he preached even though the people couldn't see it but prophets our seers and seers can see many things so they're not limited to the light spectrum so what i always say is prophets walk by sight faith they come in their in their room and all of a sudden there's the angel of the lord they see him he's a man brother adam was there he was praying he said and all of a sudden he heard a man walking into the room and then all of a sudden appear an angel a man a messenger an angelic being the angel of the lord and i said you have been sent you have got a gift and you're obese and god's going to use this gift in a mighty way are you following me so prophets are seers jeremiah what do you see i see a cauldron it's fell into the north you have seen good there will be an army rise out of the north amen so they're given a sight that the rest of the body doesn't necessarily possess amen some might have some of that but do you understand amen because i think it's foolish that some message people think that people can't have discernment it's a gift of god other people can have this sermon but not that kind of discernment not that kind of gift not that kind of seeing that's a prophet of god that's a major word prophet that's very much different than any other gift [Applause] because that's one of the ones when this light spectrum breaks through the prism of father son and holy ghost and now there are seven spirits of god that are seven seers one for every church age praise the lord so now the bible encourages us because we are limited sometimes we're like hey so all we can see is our trials our fear our trouble our circumstance our defeat it's all we can see and we think because of the third dimension and the reasoning power of our mind we think that that's reality but that wasn't reality that was gahe's reality until elijah said open the boy's eyes and that's why the message of the hour is so important to us because it's just like elijah speaking open their eyes lord open their eyes lord praise the lord so the bible encourages us to look through the eyes of faith to unlock the realities of the living god amen the trial is only the opportunity presented to the child of god to overcome to receive a testimony praise god amen hallelujah so we are looking at the unseen we're looking at the host of heaven encounter around us god help us to see the unseen brother brown says from the message questions and answers see now it's promised that sinners has angel excuse me now it isn't promised that sinners has angels it's only the redeemed has angels so if you're a sinner this morning or encourage you to get your life right with the lord and he goes on he says the angels of the lord and camp about those that fear him now we know that that means they put tents down they encamp they're here they're always with you brother scott 24 7. there are angels around every believer on the entire earth and they don't just they don't just move around they camp down there with you praise the lord angelic beings protecting us and guarding the children of god amen the bible says your angel always be holding the face of the father in heaven from the message here ye him now lord realizing that standing near there's perhaps many many angels because there's believers here and the bible says the angels of god are encamped they're not going back and forth but they're camped encamped about those who fear him many more are being called from glory tonight to encamp around those who've raised their hand to teach them the way of life how they should live so the question is what is your perception this morning are you limited to these four walls these lights this guy up in the front screaming at you with a beard or is there something by a sixth sense that's letting making you aware by your faith that's right the scriptures is true there are angels in this room that's exactly right i might not see them lord but i know they're here hallelujah they might be in another dimension but they're here i say we should just pause for a minute and let's ask the lord lord open my eyes open my eyes not so much my sight eyes although i would love to see angels but open my faith eyes and my walk is by faith your walk is by faith brother brown said in one place he said do you realize you have more faith than i do he said i see the angel you don't so you have to believe and we know that that other realm operates only on belief what you believe but here's the nice thing all things are possible all things are possible to them that believe to them that believe all things are possible hallelujah you believe that this morning praise the lord so god help our unbelief amen this morning we're knocking on father's door if you come to church you've got a need if you come to church expecting nothing right now i'm telling you and you have a need start knocking on heaven's door amen we're in the third dimension amen but heaven is here it's just in a higher faster dimension god is here the angels are here amen amen do you hear me god is here the angels are here all things are possible so then that can believe praise the lord we are standing on holy ground now what's your perception this morning what are you thinking so isaiah now isaiah was a prophet of god and he had a buddy named uzziah and uzziah was the king and uziah you know their buddies and so the king always helped take care of you isaiah everything going pretty smooth but then when i when uzziah passed away all of a sudden isaiah realized amen because something's going to happen to isaiah let me read it in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple so isaiah breaks into a vision above that stood the seraphims each one had six wings between he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly so isaac isaiah is there his friend uzziah died just bring a situation into his life and he's praying and brother ellis said he start to realize he'd been using his gift wrong and while he's praying he breaks into a vision now he goes somewhere where does he go all of a sudden he's in the throne room and he sees by vision i lost my excuse me saints he sees by vision he breaks into this vision and he sees the throne he sees god high and lifted up he sees his train filling the temple he sees angels flying all over seraphims but where did he go brother said if you dream you go somewhere he said you go into the re in the end you go into your subconscious hello so isaiah was right he didn't go physically anywhere he was probably maybe in a common spot that he prayed at a lot but now he he moved by vision into another realm where he could see beyond life time and matter he could see beyond the light spectrum now what is he looking at he is looking at reality this is not reality what you're seeing with your eyes is not reality but what you're seeing with your faith eyes your sick sense that is reality so many times when people are struggling and they're want to overcome this or overcome that and they start feeling like they've got to go somewhere i got to move here i got to go do this you don't have to go anywhere you don't have to move anywhere you don't have to go anywhere all you have to do is travel there amen through prayer through faith god can meet you in your house god can meet you driving your car down the road god can come in and do mighty things for you when you're out camping god can do mighty things for you sitting on the church pew this morning and god can do mighty things for you on wednesday night when you come to church amen come on saints of god god is not limited he doesn't just arrive on sunday morning he is there 24 7. the angels of god are there 24 7. he knows everything you're thinking your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words do on earth hallelujah glory hey hallelujah one time i was struggling about something i'll just tell you i was sitting underneath the ministry that wasn't preaching the truth and i was struggling and i just knew something was wrong so i went into very much consecration and prayer fasting and praying and praying and praying and spending my time and my hours praying alone and one afternoon i was praying and i was laying on the floor prostrate before the lord my wife was gone and i was crying out to god and all of a sudden i went somewhere i went into a vision and in the vision i saw a giant stamp stamp the church door and move away and the word ichabod was left that means the lord thy god had departed how did i get there by prayer how did i get there by god's grace amen where did i go i didn't go anywhere physically but i moved into an atmosphere amen i moved into the presence of god amen and god spoke to me god showed me a vision i'm asking you this morning can you believe god can you trust god can you sit in your seat this morning and start to doubt your doubts and start to ask god because he knows your need [Music] sometimes we come to church church is the house of god sometimes we come to church we're worried about what our brother and sister our neighbor will think about us he says well i really would have jumped up and shouted and praise the lord but i didn't really want to get out of the line sometimes young people they sit there and they know and even old people they know there's a need in their heart and the spirit of god moving but they become resistable but it's not really them that's resistable it's a spirit of the enemy that's resistable and brother brandon said do you notice in discernment when i start to discern people many times their faces change he said they changed his basic not the person he said but the devil get ready to be exposed and that's why these kind of meetings sometimes make people nervous because the devil getting ready to be exposed and all of a sudden because you want to know the importance of exposing the devil because he's easy to cast out once he's exposed the minute that you recognize that's not you that's the devil you have the right and you can cast him out isaiah's vision changed his perception my vision changed my perception cohesive vision changes perception praise the lord amen and what did the lord say to the deception in this age this age is the most deceiving age this is the age the hardest stage that's right this is the age full of sciences of the age full of all kinds of crazy stuff this is the age with less people believing in god and more people you say but the churches are filled with with people going to church the denominations let me tell you something they don't believe god the way you do and i don't mean just the message i mean they don't literally believe that he's actually real they don't believe the stories in the bible to them their allegories and their good stories but that's not the way we believe god we believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the true church still cast out devils the true church still heal the sick we still believe in the old-fashioned holy ghost-filled gospel and that's what separates us from this deceiving age the church of the living god has power power to heal power to save power to transform power to take those thoughts that are plaguing your mind and cast them out hallelujah [Applause] the lord told us the deception is denominational blindness in this laodicean age they're blind 52 genders they're crazy they're blind they're insane to believe there's more than a man and a woman you tell me they have their right mind they don't have the right mind i don't want their psychology books i don't want their religious books i don't want anything they have to offer give me the bible give me the message of the hour give me jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah what they call science i don't even want to hear it [Applause] [Music] people get caught up believers get caught up climate change how do you know it's real they told us way back then he said science proved if a ball could move if an object could move more than 35 miles an hour it would leave the earth that never happened there was doing a study the scientists were doing a study at the kennel state park when they used to play baseball way back in the early 1900s nobody ever hit it out of the field they did a study is it possible to hit it out of the field the science concluded it's physically impossible and right after they come to the conclusion somebody hit it out of the field and it's been hit out of the field many times since that's just science some of it's okay some of us are okay how do you know what's okay how do you know what's not okay brother brown said how do we know north is north and south this south how do we know these things we don't know but what we do know is that this bible is nothing but the truth this bible still saves for the god of the bible still saved still heals amen he can still heal the blind he can give blind eyesight he can heal the lame and they can walk again just like a young little boy he can do the mighty acts that he did in the scriptures he does the mighty acts that he did in the prophets ministry that's our god that's our god that's our god that's our god [Music] that's not your preachers that's our god the sick sense faith believes all things are possible the sixth sense faith believes angelic beings are present the uh sixth sense of faith knows that god can change the scene faith put you in a position to where you can come to church and you have a need and you can come with expectation and that faith will bring jehovah god our lord jesus christ on the scene for your life [Music] one time i needed a healing i had just athlete's foot i probably could have went to the doctor and maybe got some medication and it really hurts if you've ever had athlete's foot it was all over my feet i didn't actually know what it was at the time and i was embarrassed i don't always see my feet that's disgusting what is going on with me and i thought but god is still healer so i prayed lord i want you to heal my feet and i'm coming expectation and lord this is the way i prayed i said lord i know you're my healer and i pray lord that when the time is right because remember the angel of the lord come to the city after brother and prayed for those people the goiter fell off and the healings took place some two weeks later i said if it with the visit so you can get you can it doesn't matter your healing going to come and then i'm sitting there i said at the right time and all of a sudden one day during church the holy spirit moved and the holy spirit spoke right to my heart and said now it's your time i went up to the altar and a guy that come pray for me was a known hypocrite don't even know why he was up there why do preachers around this message preach these kind of men a man in adultery huh we don't need that trash we need the spirit of god amen and he walked up and i stopped myself i said i'm not letting that man pray for me but then a thought came amen you don't have to worry about the man worry about my word god honors my word i mean i honor my word and i ran up and i said lord i'm trusting you he laid hands on me and god healed me [Music] [Applause] praise the lord now that's just that's just a testimony right we all have testimonies but where is your testimony and and those testimonies are from the days gone by what about right now what do we believe right now do we still believe that god can heal us do we still believe god can deliver us do we still believe god the holy spirit can go out to our children and go out to our family members and save them hallelujah so there are many things that faith can open our eyes to the supernatural presence of god faith change peter's perception man can't walk on water it's impossible for man to walk on water come on church do you actually think people can walk on water they can't but through god all things are possible walk on water peter said lord did that be you bid me come to thee he said come he walked on water he was walking on water and all of a sudden he started to think about the waves and the water and we can't walk on water we cannot walk on water they come up they get prayed for he said well he's a person that caught get up out of the cot they rise up they haven't stood out of the cop for years and then somebody said oh get back in the car get back in a wheelchair and he said if they get back in their wheelchair they're going to die in that wheelchair and sometimes we come up and we ask god god pray for me and the rest of our life we spend our time thinking i don't know why i couldn't muster up the faith for god to pray for me i mean to heal me and then therefore we settle back down on the church and we forget about it and then we start testifying of our sickness we start testifying of our weakness we start testifying where we were defeated but we know that god is able but the problem is the devil try to lie to your mind and tell you but he's not willing all things are possible to them that can believe right john ryan came through the line and brother branham prayed for him and he walked off the line he was a blind man he walked off the line pretty soon he'd come back through the line he'd come back up brother brown said i've already prayed for you he said do i know sir but i can't see he said but you said you believed he said you believed you told me when i pray for you you will believe he says and now you don't believe he said if you don't believe you're going to stay blind your whole life he said i do believe you sir i don't have any reason not to believe you he said then go and testify that you have been healed so he was on i think he sold newspapers on the corner he was testifying extra extra the lord god had healed me in a meeting last night very soon a few weeks i was going by he's sitting in a barber chair and the barber started making fun of him i said hey john i can imagine the other guy sitting around watch this hey you can see pretty good huh i can see god open my eyes i'm healed he was looking at the promise of god he was looking at the unseen he was believing god you were not looking at the circumstances he were not paying attention to the light spectrum he was going beyond the light spectrum [Applause] oh you can see pretty good and all of a sudden his eyes open [Music] a few years ago a sister in belgium i think it's belgium if i remember right brother daryl was there preaching this girl she was born without a hip socket so she come up to get prayed for and then brother daryl told her you go testify that jesus christ has healed you and then write me when he has so this went on for a couple years she never talked about her bad hip but every time that somebody will say do anybody got a testimony i want to thank god for healing me and she'll come into the church and she'll walk out of the church but there was something in her she believed she knew that god was willing to keep his promise and that god was able to keep his promise and she wasn't taking no for an answer she was not taking the devil's answer she were not taking the doctor's disease the doctor's name or whatever else and it got so bad that her parents told her you stopped saying that in church you're embarrassing the family believers believers hmm so she's sitting in church the pastor's anybody got a testimony she says i've got one and her friends looked at her not again really she said i want to thank jesus christ for healing me and about that time they hurt and and god put a new hip socket in her body and she can walk you running around the building [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the same god the same god that was with brother branham it's the same god that's with the bride [Music] we were having a meeting back home a camp meeting the presence of god come down so strong in that church everybody was rejoicing people were coming up for prayer we had one man i had invited he was a pentecostal and he said he said i don't need i don't need to come to your meeting i've got the holy ghost i'm pentecostal i said well whatever you're welcome if you want to come but you don't have to come well all of a sudden he shows up i said i thought you weren't coming around he goes well i just decided to come the presence of god moves he comes up for prayer he's crying he said what do you want he said i want the holy ghost he thought he had the holy ghost he didn't have the holy ghost everybody in the church just getting moved on powerfully by god one man standing there a pretty tough man he stood there for like six or seven hours as the spirit of god moved mightily children were being slain in the spirit crying out to god laying there shaking under the power of god for hours god was moving mightily there's always an unbeliever there's always somebody around who allow the devil to lie to them and he'll just stand in there get nothing from god isn't that sad come into the house of god that's right god move in a mighty way and sometimes that's a problem with what the difference between a sinner and a saint and sometimes a sinner i've heard this i've been raising the church i've heard this my whole life yeah a little passed by and god moving and god talking to people all around you and god reaching out to the spirit of god trying to urge the young people trying to urge the old people amen soften your heart soften your heart let god move go back to the beginning god forgive me i don't want to take take the doctor's answer you know brother brandon he walked in he prayed for fff boss but i think it was his niece or something like that and the doctor and she would die on the machine said the machine tell her he's dying brother and pray for her and he leave and the parents start to rejoice praise the lord and the nurse come and say how can you be rejoicing your daughter dying and he says well uh you know he treated very good said listen ma'am you're you're looking at these machines he said but we're looking at the promise of god [Music] hallelujah and god healed her faith peter walked on water you see there are many things that we are limited to in our own ability but god has given us another channel called faith which knows no limitations you see now that we've come this far we realize demons come to church angels come to church the preaching of the word starts going forward angels and demons are fighting throughout the service amen god bless you brother [Applause] the devil he has been lying and telling some people that you failed god he lying you cannot overcome he's lying amen you'll not be you're not he's not that god is we is able but he's not willing to help you you've already tried it's not going to happen let me tell you something if you come up doubting the promise of god you will fail but when you decide that's right god's word is right i don't want to i don't care if i feel it i don't care what the circumstance but i know god's word is right i can only see a spectrum but i know god's word is right i can see life fracturing through a and see a rainbow i know the promise is there amen i might not be able to see everything with my eyes a gorilla walked through a curtain changed i didn't see that the second time i watched it i didn't even see the curtain change or the guy but i knew the gorilla was there and i'm like you got to be kidding me they got me again sometimes saints are you hearing me god can still meet that inner desire that need that you want the one you put on the shelf i said the one you put on a shelf i said the promise that you need in your life brother perry green preach a message guess who the first one at the altar brother branham you're gonna preach a powerful message a lot of times ages saints just sit there i wouldn't show my brother around the meetings i wish i was in brother brown meeting but if i got that attitude that the attitude i would have when i was at brother brown's meeting the attitude god be said lord jesus the devil had been lying to me you are a god that's supernatural brother told us he said god is supernatural he said anything or god goes supernatural takes place yes yes hallelujah yes are you hearing me saints anywhere god goes the supernatural take place he said water is wet if you jump in the water you're going to be wet so he said god is supernatural amen and then you said they say well yeah well you know if god was here this today yeah he could do the supernatural he is here you don't see him you don't feel him some of you are feeling him and some of you are definitely seeing them by faith he said i don't see him i don't feel him do you see the tv running through here where's the show bonanza the cowboys and indians where are they at i don't know but they're here and if i had a tv i could put a tv out and i could turn it on and i could drive that tv right into the fourth dimension pull that show that i want to see bonanza that's right this is actually a stupid show used to watch when i was a kid and thought it was so cool and i watched one some years ago and i thought well that's really lame i didn't even know all that junk was in it but the tv could reach up in the fourth dimension and pull it down now every single one of you are sitting there going you know i know that's true sure it's true of course it's true right i mean how do we take these things here and all of a sudden there's a video game from somewhere in the states well we are in the states there's a movie there's uh whatever there's a text it moves travels without a thought all of a sudden there's a text from a brother in india and then i preach on zoom and i'm preaching to people around the world and preaching in india and i'm sitting in my living room i'm in my kitchen the dining room at the table and i'm preaching and there's people around the world seeing it in real time seeing it happen right then how did that happen because what the prophet god told us is nothing but the truth there's a fourth dimension in the in the light spectrum and science has figured out how to tap into that and pull it down well let me tell you something if science can prove that and bring that down that means at that other dimension where god dwells you have been given a channel of faith you have been given a channel to reach out to reach up and pull down that faith pull down that promise to bring god on the scene hallelujah the message is supernatural the message was delivered supernaturally and nowhere along the line have we been told that one day we're going to cool off and just become a church god has promised us to be with us at all times so don't let the devil push you down hallelujah don't look at your circumstances don't be like a hazel looking at the syrian army let your perception be adjusted by the word the devil is good at painting misconceptions and lies [Music] but our messenger the prophet elijah he made known to us the unfailing realities of the living god amen the host of heaven now let's look at reality let's look at reality not joe biden's reality not trump's reality not the pope's reality they're all rotten [Music] but let's look at reality some of your young people i don't know you go to school the stuff they teaching you over there is crazy let's look at reality what is reality god is reality [Music] reality is that god is here reality is that he is here to back up his word amen amen the host of heaven is here to back up god's word the reality is satan is nothing but a liar a bluff a stealer a cheater a no down no good amen at all but the reality is that the children of god have been given power to cast him out so don't be like a hazel fearing the enemy but grab your ox gold like shamgar grab your faith amen what do you got in your hand you've got faith faith in what the word of the living god and you can rise up in your life and drive that lying demon out of your life drive that spirit out every promise in the word of god belongs to you every single promise [Applause] don't look at your circumstances open your eyes to the realities of the supernatural god stop testifying of your weakness stop testifying of your sickness stop testing firing on your problems start claiming your healing start claiming your victory this room is filled with angelic beings they're trying to increase your faith demons of doubt are here trying to steal your victory amen hallelujah you might as well be the beneficiary somebody's going to be amen so take back your healing saints take back your victory take back your children take back all the promises of god take them back hey man what kind of challenge are you facing i don't know what challenge you're facing what kind of unbelief are you facing what is it that you're facing because brother brown said you better kill that enemy before that enemy kills you are you facing well perspective have you this what perspective have you settled for have you given up on the promises of god or are you becoming more determined to go into the enemy's camp and take back what he has stole from you hallelujah back home we had a sister of four states cancer force four states stage four cancer got supernaturally healed we had a woman come this is just recent we had a woman come up it's not even a believer she come to our church and she had a big old thing in her what was that thing hanging down a tumor and i'm praying for i said oh god have mercy i'm in this tumor we are at a wedding and she was there and my wife said that's that's her that's fancy fancy right fancy i said what she looks so skinny the tumor was gone god healed him he's still a healer i'm only sharing some testimonies back their testimonies all over the place amen because why did god heal her because god's a healer i just told you the testimony about brother brian dying in the hospital from covet and had a visitation from an angel and the angel spoke to him and said you're going to be okay god healed him why did god heal him because god answers prayer amen he's a very present help in a time of trouble my wife my poor wife been suffering from hives suffering all over her body and recently god came down and healed her i thank god [Music] hey matt we sing the song if you got pain he's a pain taker and that's nothing but the truth we got a young man in our church that claimed to be an atheist because jesus christ is still a savior god changed his mind god transformed him and now he's a believer he got so bad he said i'm an atheist i don't believe anything but now he's serving the lord hallelujah now what about you my brother my sister what miracle do you need god to perform i said miracle or god's a miracle worker i've seen god do

maybe i have you could stop me if i have i'm in the in the town we come in we were supposed to be allowed to use the covenant church for our meetings so we had to have a meeting with the pastor of the covenant church and he said oh no no we have this guy uh he paul paul's journeys he's coming through and we're going to have a meeting and but you guys are welcome to come well that wasn't what they told us so i was just sitting there we're in a little little uh they have little houses most of them aren't very big not even as big as this room probably are about the same size i guess we're sitting in there and brother andrew asked this minister he says have you ever read the church age book that i gave you the blue book and i thought uh oh oh lord i got up and i went to use the bathroom and got down started praying lord help us we're fixing to get in a rat's race here a big mess i know we are i said lord please help us so i came back out and i said lord i'm just going to keep my mouth shut i'm not going to say anything i'm going to be quiet i went back out sat down and then brother they're talking and he says brother andrew says well just ask brother flynn he knows i'm like no please so here these two big men say you mean to tell us that you believe jesus christ visited this generation through a prophet of god and i said well that's exactly what we believe and as soon as i said that's exactly what we leave they both went back in their chairs and almost fell back they were like whoa and then they came forward and then they started and as soon as they started the door kicked open and brother john came in because when we showed up and they said we couldn't use the covenant church he looked at he says i'm gonna go find a place for church and he left then he comes back well they sent this man to seminary school brother john so when he comes back in the pastor harvey says oh brother john you came for the meetings after all because an income for your guys denominational meetings is that i came with these brothers so we could have church and by the way brothers my parents said since they won't let us use the church building we can have church at their house and they're already broadcasting it across the vhf all over all over the city all over the town all right so we got right out of there before they get chastised i was real good we went up to have church we're sitting in a room amen that's smaller than this the the the living rooms like that and then the the rooms are there just they just have like a curtain hanging there and i'm back there trying to pray young preacher and i'm trying to pray and get ready for service and i never preached in this kind of environment well and i mean exactly like that i had preaching homes but they were believers these were no believers except brother andrew was there and another couple believers but the rest of them there were like 18 people there and they were not i'm 18 13 i think it was 18. 18 people there never even heard the message and we're sitting in there and uh you know they're we're trying to get ready for service and the phone rings yeah hello what do you want they're trying to lead songs yeah i know we're getting ready to have church ah yeah okay okay yeah that sounds good click people running out and out making noise i thought oh god have mercy waste our time coming here oh god no no feeling and preach i like to have feeling before i come out this way that's why the what the preacher knows and he loves sometimes he can come he's ready but but he's waiting for the lord and then when they call the preacher usually they're about to win the holy spirit strike them and all of a sudden they come in a stronger way and all of a sudden you're back there in the little room and wham and now now i'm ready to preach maybe before the i don't want to be here and so i'm sitting there and now all of a sudden this old eskimo woman stands up and starts talking and i thought great we got a woman preacher in our midst wow this is going from bad to worse but i'm sitting there thinking well lord you know you did send us here we believe and we're trying our best and so then she sets down so then it's time for me to preach i'm like wow standing in the living room these people all sitting there tv here kitchen here everything open pretty soon i'm trying to preach these little kids running hey and they walk what's going on one turns on the tv the get up turn off the tv and in there making peanut butter jelly sandwich talking and screaming and i'm preaching i'm like wow lord help me survive this so i got done preaching and i'm like this is the worst message that i've ever preached this is the worst atmosphere i've ever been in uh well okay this was a defeated one here i don't know and a thought came to me brother benham said no service is complete without an altar call he said that one place well okay i'll i'll throw an altar call out there and i gave an altar call and all of a sudden the pillar of fire dropped in that house it was so bright we could hardly see the light every single one of those perfect people were baptized they were at the altar weeping and crying asking god forgive me help me give me the holy ghost and the old man and the old women who couldn't even speak english they were also there crying and weeping and thinking god glory to god but the beautiful thing thank you jesus was that when that old eskimo woman stood up and started tested started testifying i thought well what you know she's preaching you know a woman preacher she stands up she starts testifying she's telling them of a dream she said you know they they he would they were the parents of the of of all the people and grandparents and she said you know that me and dad we go to church all the time we don't understand a word they preach because we don't speak english there's no bible in their language they said but we know god is real and we've been praying and we were praying for god to help us and she said and i saw a dream i had a dream and i told you some of you about this dream there's a white man that come across and they come to this village and then she points i didn't know she was saying this she points and she says that's the white man in my dream right there that's him our god is still the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah so i'll ask you my brother sister what miracle do you need god to perform i say well i'll be glad for healing good then be glad for healing and receive it i need the devil to quit plaguing my mind then good speak to that devil right now because the bible said the believers will cast out the devil it didn't say the preachers will cast out the devil it said the believers will cast out the devil speak to that devil speak to that liar amen we come into the camp of the living god and we are here and we're leaving with something we didn't just come to church to come empty and leave empty we came to receive from the living god [Applause] [Music] god's word is true the believers lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that is the truth the believers not just the preachers come on church god can move supernaturally in your life you say well i never felt god supernaturally god can move supernaturally in your life god can do a mighty work god can change the scene you made mistakes you messed everything up don't worry about it god's not worried about it that's the devil lying to you god can change the scene [Applause] hallelujah pick up your board pick up your sword my brother cast out that devil of torment amen hallelujah take back your victory take back your mountain take back your inspiration take back your position in heavenly places hallelujah sometimes since we just forget who we are we forget what we're raised up for we forget that our god amen he the devil bruised him his heel but god stomped on that devil amen the mighty conqueror defeated him at calvary and greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world there's god living in there that's god living in there let the lion speak let the faith rise up believe god's word i remember a story you know sometimes we feel all alone don't we we're going to a trial hard time the devil be lying to us and we're listening to his lie he knows how to get in our complex people get complex and get in there you know brother brown had complexes and come home for one night it was his birthday and he didn't realize it and he got home at night and all these people were in there he looked in the window and they were all laughing and having a good time they were waiting for brother brown they're going to give him a surprise party when he stopped he looked in the window he thought man if i go in there i'm just going to ruin their fun and so he went for a long drive not even knowing they were in there waiting for him it's a complex and sometimes when people have complexes and mostly everybody has a complex of one kind or another the devil know how to get into that complex sometimes and they know how to work that complex and they know how to cause problems and then pretty soon if you're not careful you feel all alone and then you don't really want to talk about the situation the worst thing a person can ever do is clam up and not talk about a situation you know why because when you when you speak of the problem you're exposing the enemy when you expose the enemy he loses his ground he can't hold on no longer he has to let go but what happens is he get us he get us all beat down he'd get us in a corner he'd get us in a complex now all of a sudden we don't really want to go to church and whatever happening and all these things are happening and pretty soon we start to think well you know maybe i'm not really a believer and the devil pretty good at that didn't he you're not really a believer been baptized the name of jesus christ got filled with the holy ghost been serving god your whole life and all of a sudden you're not a believer just because you're going through a hard time well i got news for the devil we can't lose our salvation we can only lose our fellowship with god we cannot lose our salvation and brother said the holy spirit just wait for you he's waiting he wants to come back in he wants to bring the revival back he wants the sweetness back he wants the fellowship back he want it back more than you wanted he wants to save you more than you want to be saved he wants to heal you more than you want to be healed he wants you to stand here and be able to give a testimony and i'm in the testimony not of talking about your problem i mean a testimony of how the power of god came into your life i'm in the testimony of a vision a testimony of a speaking in tongues a testimony a lot of messages we don't believe in gifts and we don't believe in speaking in tongues that's not my god [Applause] i've spoken tongues i've seen visions i've seen miracles i've had god use me into discernment i don't believe i have the gift of discernment but god has used me that way i'm a preacher preachers could use that way but the devil like to try to i isolate somebody and make them start feeling like this they remind me of a story one time that i heard i think it was the vietnam war and these guys they're like commandos the rangers they have to go into an area a small group of them go in they sneak in and maybe they have to kill somebody or something but they're behind enemy lines and then they had a rendezvous the helicopter would land at a certain time in a certain place they had to be there i mean these guys are incredible they have to have compasses and gps's and they got to figure all this stuff out they got to sneak be quiet get through the woods they're in the enemy there's enemies all around them and then there's the rendezvous and they got to get there well one of these one of these men by time he got he bite he was running late because he was there were too many enemies he had to stay still he had to stay right where he was when he was finally ready he could go he took off he got but when he got there the helicopter was gone everybody was gone he was all by himself behind enemy lines and i thought that's just like a believer when the devil get them beat down and they start thinking like that and they're behind enemy lines and they don't realize and the helicopters left and there they are and all he had was communication so he communicated back to the chief or whoever whatever they call him and the guy talking to him on the phone he's like this guy is in big trouble what are we going to do we can't go get them it would be certain death to send a helicopter and we would all die we can't go get this man and the man's like okay man here's my coordinates can you come get me he says no we can't come get you and all of a sudden the man start breaking down oh my goodness what am i gonna do just like a person oh my goodness what am i going to do i feel like god has forsaken me i feel like i'm all by myself i'm all alone i'm scared to talk to the past i don't know what to do and the man the leader on the phone on the whatever you call that started speaking to him and said who are you it was my name such and such he goes that's not what i'm asking you i'm asking you who are you because what do you mean i said i want to know who you are he said well i'm a commando he said you're a what he said i'm a commando he said you're a what he said i'm a commando that's right i'm a commando i am a commando i can get out of here on my own glory to god saints of god you've got angels with you 24 7. you've got the power of god with you 24 7. glory let's praise god thank you lord jesus hallelujah hallelujah greater is he
