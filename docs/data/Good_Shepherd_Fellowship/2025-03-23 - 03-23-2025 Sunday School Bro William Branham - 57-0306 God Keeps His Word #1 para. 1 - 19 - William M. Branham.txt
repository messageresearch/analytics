TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Let us bow our heads to Almighty God and offer to him a word of prayer. Shall we pray? Our kind heavenly father, we thank thee tonight for the love of the Lord Jesus and for being with us to this another day. and has by thy grace permitted us to assemble here together tonight. And thou has promised that wherever two or more are gathered in my name, I'll be in their midst. And we know that thou art here because you have promised them. And we pray that you'll bless us tonight, your presence being here. May we all recognize it. And may the Holy Spirit take the word of God and give it to every heart just as we have need. Save sinners, heal the sick and afflicted, call the backsliders back to the home of grace. Grant these blessings we ask in Christ's name. Amen. As the nights grow on and the meeting begins to come towards the last of it of this present meeting, I am trusting to God that many things will be done for his glory. I am horse in my throat. Not from a bad cold, but just too much speaking. This is about four months straight with hardly a night off. So you can imagine what a great terrible strain it is from the frozen regions until the tropical jungles. And there's no let up yet. I've got go from here immediately leaving Monday morning and I've got to be at La Christian at 1:00 Monday after leaving here and then on up into California to open back into Kansas dedicating a church the mayor up into Canada around through Canada and then if the Lord so permit immediately after the Chicago Christian Business Van Convention a complete worldwide tour all the way around. So I need prayer and need it very bad. So you pray for me now tonight as we open this blessed word of God. I just love to read of the word. Don't you like the word faith cometh by hearing? Hearing the word of God. We can rest so assured on God's word because it's eternally right. It's forever the truth. And with the help of the Holy Spirit, I would like to read for a text praying that he will give us the context out of Numbers the 13th chapter and the 30th verse. And Caleb still the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are able to overcome it. just as a scripture reading. And now I trust that God will help us as we go into this. And now tonight, if it would be so for the next two or three nights, I'd like to teach on the subject this God keeps his word. When I was first converted and was ordained in the Baptist church, I had a good old teacher by the name of Dr. Roy Davis. He was a lawyer before his conversion. And he talked everything from a legal standpoint in the Bible. And when I remember my first sermon I preached, I preached on Samson, a grinding for the enemy. Well, I went over and had my own hands tied to the post and oh, I went through every emotion that I guess that I felt the preacher could go through. And when I noticed old Dr. Davis sitting there with his finger up to his mouth just watching me. And after the service was over, I'd made my altar call. A lot of the old mothers is walking up, patting me on the shoulder. Oh, they said, "Billy, that was wonderful." And Dr. Davis said, "I want to see you in a study." I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "That was just about as ridiculous as I ever heard in my life." Oh, it really took the sales off of me. So I said, "Well, what's the matter, Dr. David?" He said one time when I was practicing law said I went out and I heard a few cases tried and said when I heard the cases I watched the emotions the attorneys went through and said when I tried my first case after I was sworn to the bench. He said, "I took off my coat and it was a lady I was defending and said, I pounded on the desk. I cried. I walked back and forth and said, I thought I had the case whipped. That's all there was to it." and said the old judge sat there and after a while he wrapped on the dim bench and said judge your honor how much more can this ridiculous thing can your court stand well said then I felt I felt like I was just whipped so I walked out defeated said I went out home said well I'll study something else I'll never make a lawyer said after somebody knocked on the door and who was said what said the old attorney and he come down he said Roy I was watching you and he said you know this court said I reason I did that I want you to be a real lawyer said I know it's in you to be a lawyer but this court doesn't make its decisions upon your mental emotions you had a lot of mental emotion but you had no law in defense. And he said, "That's the reason I said that." And I think that's a very good thing. I said, "Dr. Davis, I thank you." He said, "Billy, all of your emotions and going on and tying Samson to the post and with him and putting his eyes out, you didn't get very much scripture. Men are not saved by emotions and all the little sad stories you tell. Man saved by the word of God. That certainly fixed me up. Since then, I've decided this that God doesn't judge us upon our emotions or upon our affiliations with church, but he judges us by his word. Heavens and earth shall pass away, but God's word shall never pass away. Amen. Now, in the day that we're living and the times that we're living in, I think it behooves us to check up with the word of God and see where we're living in the hour we're living. Now, God spoke of this day, and this day is one of the most outstanding days that the world has ever seen. It is one of the greatest times to preach the gospel that the world has ever known. Now, in the Old Testament, there was about three ways of knowing the will of God. Of course, one of them was a written law. The next was by a prophet, the next was by a dreamer. And when a prophet prophesied or dreamer dreamed, they let that speak before the urine thunder. That was the breastplate that was on Aaron's breast. And in there were stones that represented each tribe. And if that prophet was right or that dreamer was right, there come a sacred light over that breastplate and was called urum thunder. And no matter how real it seemed, I want you to get it. No matter how real it seemed, if those lights didn't flash on the urum thundum, God had refused the message. Any Bible scholar knows that the urum thund has been done away with because that priesthood ended. But God's urum thunder today is God's word. The word is his ur thunder. Woe unto him that'll add or take away anything from this book. This is God's eternal truth. And in the day where there's people saying, "Oh, we don't need the Bible. It's been translated 15 times or more, how do we know it's right?" Till the heavens and earth pass away, God's word will never pass away. Every doctrine and everything else of the Bible that we have in the church must be based upon the word of God. Must come from the word. Not just one place, but from Genesis to Revelation, it must say the same thing. Because we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture. For the Bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses, let every word be established. You could take one scripture, fix it around, I can say in the scripture, Judas hung himself. You go do likewise. But that wouldn't be rightly dividing the scripture. See, that was pertaining to Judas and not to you. And now we're starting tonight on two or three nights if the Lord permits on God keeps his word. He's got to keep his word. And in order to be God, he has to stand behind everything he said in his word. And that's exactly where my faith rests is upon the spoken word of God. Now, our text starts off tonight with the covenant people way down in Egypt. Yet, they were in there waiting on the word of God which had been spoken by to Abraham that there his seed would sojourn in this strange land for 400 years. But in such a long wait, the people had got away from the real meaning and wasn't looking for the day to come. And another thing we could say, they wasn't looking for it in the way that it did come. And that's what's the matter with us today. We've got our mind set up on the way God's got to do things just the way we think he's going to do it. And usually we're wrong. God promise he would deliver them. And when a little baby boy was born down there in a poor peasant home, little could they ever think that that was the emancipator of Egypt or of Israel. But it was. And when the time come for them to be delivered, Israel failed to recognize their leader to bring them out. What did it take? It taken 40 years more before God could ever get the church in condition to take it out. Now, I believe this. I could be wrong. I'm just a man as you are. But I believe the coming of the Lord is past due. I believe the reason that God can't come is on the condition of his church. Amen. It's all separated and broke up and everything that could be thought of is mixed into it. It's got to come a time for an oldfashioned shaking down, settling down for the church of God. Now, as we see this day, that was a perfect tight thing of this today. First thing they had, they had the ark, a prophet, an angel, the word, their prophet, their angel, a sacred life that followed them. And as they came out of Egypt after Moses finally God taken 40 years to bring them into condition and they were 40 years past because of their differences and not recognizing. The Bible said that in the days of Noah God was longsuffering. He wasn't willing that any should perish. And he says, "As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the coming of the son of man." I believe the coming of the Lord is passed due. Then for he had to wait long in Noah's time. He had to wait long in bringing out Israel. I believe he's waiting long, but I believe his patience is getting thin with us. I just met Brother Hooper a few moments ago. First time I've seen him for a long time. Said, "Brother Brandham, I want just a minute or two with you before you leave Arizona for this may be our last time seeing each other. It seems like there's a great checking up time somewhere. As I think of it now, after 40 years, finally God got them together and they recognized this prophet Moses who went down there with the word and on their road out coming out of Egypt following God. And they they came to a place looked like a halt or a standstill. And after they had done seen the glory of God down in Egypt with signs and wonders that God had did, when they seen the pressing time come, when the Red Sea had them cut off, the deserts had them cut off, and Pharaoh's army just behind them. Oh, what an hour. But God seems to take pleasure in getting his children in such a position. It's strange how God leads his children. As a poet used to say, some through the waters, some through the floods, some through deep trials, but all through the blood. God has the way leading his children. So odd and peculiar. And how strange that newborn baby come up out of this great wilderness of sin and was led right up here and cut off. Why? Seemingly all nature mourned for that. But God's path happened to lead through the Red Sea. And how beautiful to notice just in that crucial hour. Oh, I love God for that. God waits till the very crucial moment. But he can speak and things keep up according to his word. He had promised them to take them to the promised land and he's obligated to his word. That great dark crucial moment. How easy it was for God to figure it out. He just stuck the pillar of fire and moved it over in between the Egyptians coming and it was light to Israel and dark to them. Now that's what it is coming to now my brethren. It's coming a place that those who reject Christ, he's becoming darkness to them. To those who accept it, it's becoming light to them. We are living in that day just before crossing. And did you notice how easy it was for the creator God to send down a strong east wind and justified the Red Sea and take his children across? Oh, the Red Sea got scared and just walled itself up because God's path led to the middle of it. That's the way God does things. If people, these people who was keeping his word, walking in the light, moving on, following God's commands, everything just opened up for them. And if you want things to open up, take God at his word and start moving forward. Now, we understand that they came to a place called Katish Barnea. That was a judgment seat or a testing time for all of Israel. And God always test his children by his word. Did you hear that? God tests his children by his word. If you believe his word, God tests you by the word. Now, if you notice, there come a time to go over and spy out the land. And when they went over to spy out the land, they came back the 12, 10 of them said, "We can't take it. We just can't take it because the cities are all walled and we look like grasshoppers upside of those great giants." But two of them said, "We can take it." That was Caleb and Joshua. And friend, I want you to notice that Caleb and Joshua was looking at one thing and the 10 was looking at something else. The 10 was looking at circumstances and Caleb and Joshua was looking at God's word. They said, "We can take it for we're well able to do it because God said we could do it." And I believe tonight as hard as I have preached and other ministers who sees the vision, I still believe that there's some way that we can break down the middle wall of petition and make churches of God run together as a brotherhood. [Applause] I don't know how it will be done, but God has said that he would have a church without blemish, without spot, without wrinkle, and he's going to have it. I believe it. Then they got them a false prophet. When people won't receive the truth, though it be in the minority, they'll raise them up the false prophet. The Bible said in the last days that false prophets of people would heap for themselves teachers having itching ears and would be turned away from the truth unto fables. Now God has to keep his word. He has to do it. Turned away from truth onto fable. And you notice they went and got another man by the name of Kora. And Kora got all the people together, as many as he could, and pulled them off and segregated them from the rest of them and started himself a little denomination of his own. saying, "There's more prophets besides Moses. There's more holy men. We are all holy man. And each one of us had just as much right to believe this as they had to believe that." But brother, it was a lie to begin with. God has a program and that program is written in his word and his word said we should be one all together not a divided divisions and fusses and stews but we should be one. Christ prayed that we would be one. And he said, "This will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other." How can gifts and signs work in a church? How can God perfect his church when there is so much division among us? How can when one says this and one says that and one says something else and all contrary one to the other. There is one supreme judge. That's God's eternal everlasting word. And God keeps his word. So quicker we can line up with that word, better off we'll be. God keeps his word. [Music]
