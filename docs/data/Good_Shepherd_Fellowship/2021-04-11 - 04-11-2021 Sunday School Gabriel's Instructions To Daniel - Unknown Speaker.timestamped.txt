[0:00] [Music]
[0:16] let's turn over
[0:17] in jeremiah the 25th chapter and read
[0:20] what jeremiah had to say
[0:25] actually let's begin at the eighth verse
[0:26] because i want you to be
[0:28] sure to get it the 11th verse is where i
[0:31] had wrote down here to read but let's
[0:32] begin the eighth verse
[0:34] therefore thus saith the lord
[0:38] of hosts i just like that
[0:41] i can hear a prophet stand up with the
[0:44] saith the lord
[0:45] god brother that's it
[0:49] to me that settles it that's all of it
[0:52] thus saith the lord of hosts because you
[0:55] have
[0:56] not heard my words
[0:59] behold i will stand and take
[1:03] all the families of the north saith the
[1:06] lord
[1:07] and nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon
[1:09] my servant
[1:11] and will bring them again against this
[1:14] land
[1:15] and against the inhabitants thereof and
[1:18] against all the nations around about
[1:20] and i will utterly destroy them remember
[1:23] them
[1:23] were god's elected that he's talking
[1:26] about
[1:29] that wasn't infidels that were church
[1:32] members
[1:34] yeah moreover i will
[1:38] take from them the voice of mera
[1:41] the voice of gladness just like we have
[1:43] the day all
[1:44] rock and roll ricky and elvis and noah
[1:48] the voice of the bridegroom the voice of
[1:51] the bird
[1:52] or the bride rather the sound of the
[1:54] millstone
[1:55] the light of the canal and
[1:59] this whole land shall be desolate
[2:05] you're that private crowd this
[2:09] whole land shall be desolate
[2:12] and not to impersonate this great
[2:15] servant of god
[2:17] but i prophesy that this whole
[2:21] nation shall become destined
[2:29] god shall punish this nation for her
[2:32] sins
[2:35] if god would not let israel his elected
[2:38] abraham seed who he made the covenant
[2:41] and promise with
[2:42] if he would not let them get by with
[2:44] wrongdoings
[2:46] though they were religious to the core
[2:49] had the great churches the priests and
[2:51] the rabbis but because of the immorals
[2:54] and things among them and
[2:55] god made them reap what they sowed so
[2:58] shall we
[3:04] 11th verse this whole land shall become
[3:08] destined and astonishment that is
[3:12] everybody just looks at there they are
[3:15] they were so great look at them now
[3:18] and these nations shall serve the king
[3:21] of babylon
[3:23] seventy years
[3:26] that's a lifetime that's when you're
[3:31] blessed old mother was a baby
[3:34] they were in there without a guard
[3:36] without a church without a song without
[3:39] anything
[3:43] for a complete generation so all that
[3:47] sinning generation died out
[3:52] and it shall come to pass when 70 years
[3:55] are accomplished
[3:59] that i will punish the king of babylon
[4:04] and that nation saith the lord for their
[4:07] iniquity
[4:08] and the land of the chaldeans and will
[4:12] make it a perpetual desolation and i
[4:15] will bring upon that land all my words
[4:17] which i have
[4:18] pronounced against it even all that is
[4:22] written
[4:22] in this book which jeremiah has
[4:25] prophesied against
[4:26] all the nation for many nations and
[4:30] great kings shall
[4:32] serve themselves
[4:35] themselves of them also and i will
[4:38] recommend according to their deeds and
[4:41] according to their
[4:42] words of their own hands for thus saith
[4:45] the lord god of israel unto me
[4:48] take the wine cup all the theory in my
[4:51] hand
[4:52] and cause all the nations
[4:56] to whom i will send thee to drink of it
[5:00] i know the word gemma i'll give you this
[5:04] message
[5:05] don't sit still don't stay in one place
[5:09] but
[5:09] prophesy to all the nations hallelujah
[5:13] do you follow him prophesy to all the
[5:17] nations
[5:18] show my signs and wonders let them know
[5:20] that i'm coming to do this
[5:24] and they shall drink and be moved and be
[5:27] mad
[5:29] because of the word that i will send
[5:31] among them
[5:32] what do they do in this very day they
[5:35] call you
[5:36] a false prophet call you a
[5:40] a compromiser call you a
[5:43] a fanatic a saucer
[5:47] or a dreamer of dreams or some kind of a
[5:51] mental telepathist they will
[5:54] be mad and the word mad if you'll break
[5:57] it down means crazy
[5:59] am i they'll actually go crazy and say
[6:02] oh
[6:03] pay no touch that holy roller yeah
[6:06] that nonsense because of the word that i
[6:10] will send among them
[6:14] you see the history repeating itself
[6:19] jeremiah wouldn't agree with this
[6:21] pharisees sadducees herodians
[6:23] whatever they might be he's he just
[6:25] packed a word out
[6:30] and it made them all mad at him
[6:34] what now notice and
[6:38] then i took the cup at the lord's hand
[6:42] and made all the nations to drink it
[6:45] jeremiah didn't stay home
[6:47] jeremiah didn't just stay in one little
[6:49] spot but he made all the nations drink
[6:51] it
[6:51] unto whom the lord had sent me
[6:56] jeremiah took the word of the lord the
[6:58] wine
[6:59] of his word and the wine is the power of
[7:02] his word
[7:04] wine has a power wine is an intoxication
[7:08] mind has got power behind it and i took
[7:11] the lord's word said your mind
[7:14] am i made it manifest
[7:17] the wine and the power that's in it i
[7:20] exercised before i am
[7:24] and they would not hear it god said then
[7:27] i'll
[7:27] send them for 70 years into babylon
[7:31] that's just what he did
[7:35] the righteous and unrighteous one alike
[7:38] now back to the
[7:42] lesson daniel had been reading
[7:45] yesterday daniel read
[7:48] the same word
[7:51] that we are reading this morning
[7:56] daniel read the same bible
[7:59] the same punctuation the same
[8:02] sentences the same things that i'm
[8:06] by the help of god will read you in the
[8:07] next few messages
[8:09] amen the came to show you that
[8:12] we are at the end time and daniel
[8:17] taking the word from jeremiah goes down
[8:19] into
[8:20] fablab and he wants the anointed prophet
[8:27] and he performed miracles
[8:30] time could interpret unknown tongues
[8:35] and done signs and wonders among them
[8:44] amen
[8:47] stood alone but jeremiah
[8:51] had wrote these words many many years
[8:54] before
[8:55] and daniel interpreted the word god said
[8:58] now wait a minute we're coming near the
[8:59] end time
[9:01] for i've already been down here 68 years
[9:04] and the prophet of the lord amen
[9:07] hallelujah
[9:08] my brother the true
[9:11] prophet of god that prove yourself a
[9:14] prophet prophesy to us
[9:16] i've got it wrote here in a book that
[9:19] said 70 years will be accomplished
[9:22] oh lord god we're nearing the end
[9:26] all that generation has died out what
[9:29] will you do now lord you promised to
[9:31] send us any
[9:32] set yourself in order to pray
[9:35] oh god if there ever was a time that we
[9:38] ought to be setting ourselves in order
[9:40] to pray
[9:41] it's now amen for we as his true servant
[9:45] [Music]
[9:46] we see by the letters
[9:50] of the apostles
[9:53] by the warnings of the holy spirit
[9:58] that we're in the last day the holy
[10:04] spirit speaks it in the last days
[10:07] man will be headed high-minded lovers of
[10:10] pleasure more than of god truth breakers
[10:12] false accusers
[10:14] incontinent the sponsors of those that
[10:17] are
[10:17] good i understand by letter
[10:24] i understand that therapy nation against
[10:27] nation
[10:27] in the last days i understand that there
[10:31] will be
[10:32] tidal waves in the last days
[10:35] i understand that there will be fearful
[10:38] sights like flying sailing for fear
[10:41] there'll be a perplexity of time
[10:44] and a distress amongst the people i read
[10:47] that they'll all go into organizations
[10:49] and denominations and have a
[10:50] confederation
[10:52] in the last days
[10:56] i hair in the understand days
[11:01] i understand they wear sharks clothes
[11:04] and walk with high-heeled shoes
[11:05] tinkling as they go in the last days
[11:08] i understand it will understand that the
[11:11] preachers will be
[11:12] false shepherds in the last days that
[11:14] will compromise
[11:16] i will not feed the people the word of
[11:18] god
[11:19] but we'll go after creeds and things
[11:21] instead
[11:24] i understand there will be a voice
[11:26] coming
[11:30] [Music]
[11:33] calling the people back to the original
[11:35] message
[11:36] back to the things of god i understand
[11:39] by the book
[11:41] those things will take place amen i
[11:44] understand that in the last days there
[11:45] will come a famine
[11:47] the churches will be so organized and so
[11:50] set
[11:50] and everything that in the last days
[11:52] there will come a famine
[11:54] and it will not be for bread and water
[11:56] only but for
[11:57] hearing the true word of god amen
[12:01] and people will go from the east from
[12:03] the west from the north and the south
[12:06] seeking to hear the true word of god but
[12:08] the churches will be so
[12:10] organized and tightened up if they'll
[12:12] fail to hear
[12:14] i understand that by book but in that
[12:17] day
[12:18] oh god
[12:23] there will be a branch rise up from
[12:26] david
[12:27] [Music]
[12:28] hallelujah before that day comes at the
[12:32] end time and
[12:33] he'll have a message that'll turn the
[12:35] hearts out of the
[12:36] children back to the fathers
[12:40] turn them back to the original go back
[12:43] again to the end
[12:45] and start i understand that that'll take
[12:49] place just before them
[12:53] and i see her going in prophets
[12:56] that israel will become a nation they'll
[12:59] reestablish the temple worship
[13:02] god will go to dealing with her again
[13:04] when she comes to your homeland
[13:07] oh two prophets arrested the gentile
[13:10] church moves out
[13:12] two prophets will arrive elisha and
[13:14] moses the israel
[13:15] will get it as we go through
[13:20] but to tell him all the way down what
[13:23] was determined for the jewish race
[13:25] all the way to the consummation
[13:28] [Music]
[13:29] amen yes a little bit and got the whole
[13:32] thing
[13:35] yes just to know daniel was trying to
[13:38] find out
[13:39] how your servant my brother has
[13:42] prophesied
[13:43] 68 years ago and said there's 70 years
[13:46] this people are staying here all the old
[13:48] generations practically gone now
[13:51] there's an old pentecostal generation
[13:53] raised up 40 years ago old fighters is
[13:56] called
[13:57] they organized and beaten fussed all
[13:59] down through mount harbon nebo
[14:01] all through there but finally we're at
[14:03] the river now
[14:05] he's going to raise up a new one for the
[14:08] joshua to take him over
[14:11] the law failed moses went with it moses
[14:14] faces have
[14:15] failed but the spirit of god
[14:19] joshua the word joshua means jesus our
[14:21] savior
[14:23] that the holy spirit will come into the
[14:25] church
[14:26] not an organization but the holy spirit
[14:30] will get among the people
[14:32] and make her ready to go up well holy
[14:34] cross jordan
[14:37] i understand by the reading of the book
[14:40] that's what's to take place and god
[14:41] knows that's what i'm seeking now
[14:43] that i might comfort his people and tell
[14:45] him what's at hand
[14:47] both here this morning and out through
[14:49] the lands of these tapes will go
[14:51] worldwide that we're at the end time
[14:56] he revealed all the way until the
[14:59] kingdom was completely restored
[15:01] and the millennium set in that was
[15:03] gabriel's message
[15:05] he said i've come to tell you that there
[15:07] is 70 of
[15:08] years 70 of weeks yet determine
[15:11] upon thy people determined to the end
[15:15] of the jewish generation there's 70
[15:18] of which i watch what he said
[15:21] that now from the going forth to restore
[15:26] 78 weeks are determined upon thy people
[15:28] and upon thy
[15:30] city thy seed
[15:34] bath and business
[16:17] now when we get to the the seven of the
[16:20] six fold
[16:21] confirmation we'll find what that city
[16:23] is
[16:24] bring it down and prove who it was who
[16:27] founded it where it come from

[16:33] all great things are in store for
[16:36] all right 78 weeks are determined upon
[16:39] thy people and upon thy
[16:41] city to finish the transgression

[16:47] he told him that
[16:48] the 70 of weeks was i mean 70 years is
[16:51] about finished
[16:52] 68 is like two years and we find out
[16:54] that jeremiah's prophecy is
[16:57] just exactly right two years later they
[16:59] went out
[17:00] nehemiah went and got an order from the
[17:02] king and built the wall
[17:03] in trouble sometimes it worked he said
[17:06] the wall

[17:09] to make an
[17:10] end of sin to make an end of sin who to

[17:35] end of sin
[17:36] make reconciliations for iniquity and to
[17:39] bring in the
[17:40] everlasting righteousness
[17:44] and to seal up the vision in prophecy
[17:47] and to anoint the most holy
[17:49] watch know therefore and understand that

[20:08] earth and said it in orbit
[20:10] i was preaching the other night sunday

[20:13] how that there's nothing fails
[20:16] while this world turns so perfect till

[20:20] and moon will pass in 20 years a day to
[20:22] the exact minute
[20:24] i can't tell you but any time peace we
[20:26] got in the world
[20:28] it'll lose two or three minutes a month
[20:30] or a game to remain the best we got
[20:34] we can't make nothing that perfect
[20:38] because there's only one thing perfect
[20:41] amen that's god
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] and god in his word is the same
[20:48] so god's word is perfect
[20:52] if we can find these days we'll find
[20:55] exactly when the consummation will be
[20:59] you get it it's determined
[21:03] through the consummation
[21:06] the 24th verse thy people
[21:10] and the holy city which is jerusalem
[21:14] got 21st 24th verse sure jesus referred
[21:18] to this in matthew 24.
[21:20] now brother collins
[21:24] if he's sure this morning i don't know
[21:26] whether he is or not
[21:28] and the do not you ask the question
[21:31] i guess it's all right for me to say
[21:32] brother colin
[21:35] about the abomination and make of
[21:37] desolation
[21:39] see what it meant jesus spoke of it
[21:42] in matthew 24 chapter and we find out
[21:46] yeah matthew 24 15 now let me just get
[21:49] that right quick so you can see
[21:51] what jesus speaking of the same thing
[21:53] here referring back to daniel
[21:56] matthew 24 15 to you that's taken out i
[21:59] want you each one now especially
[22:01] tonight and next sunday bring them
[22:03] pencils and papers because we're
[22:05] unless you've got a tape 24
[22:08] and the 15th verse
[22:14] and when therefore and when
[22:17] ye therefore shall see the abomination
[22:21] of desolation spoken of by
[22:24] daniel the prophet
[22:27] i think this is 480
[22:33] 345 86 years beforehand
[22:37] 486 years beforehand daniel the prophet
[22:41] standing in the holy place
[22:42] now look in your bible it's in princes
[22:45] whoso readeth
[22:47] let him understand now he's talking to
[22:51] the jews they want to know what about
[22:52] this temple
[22:54] when will it be destroyed when will it
[22:56] be rebuilt
[22:58] when will there come a time it won't be
[22:59] one stone upon another
[23:01] how long will it last he said when you
[23:04] see the
[23:04] abomination that make a desolation
[23:07] standing
[23:08] when daniel stood in the holy place that
[23:10] when you see this come to pass now let
[23:12] him
[23:13] read understand what he's talking about
[23:15] that's the reason we're praying to god
[23:18] to make that so
[23:19] perfect that there'll be not one
[23:21] shattered out because
[23:22] we're not supposed to put our own
[23:24] interpretation to those things
[23:26] it's got to come to thus saith the lord
[23:30] amen so i'm leaving it right there until
[23:32] i understand
[23:35] revealed all things to him that
[23:37] abomination
[23:39] and remember it has a compound meaning
[23:42] just like call my son out of egypt as
[23:45] israel was called out so jesus's son
[23:47] called out
[23:49] that'll be just exactly take place as
[23:52] certain as i'm standing here
[23:54] and he did it in a way and he's made it
[23:56] all he had
[23:57] all hid from the church oh when we get
[23:59] down into that
[24:00] into those six-fold understandings how
[24:03] he's got all this he hit from the church
[24:04] so if the church be watching it every
[24:06] minute
[24:06] didn't know when he was coming but now
[24:11] the church age is about over so it's
[24:14] just
[24:14] ready now for the coming is getting
[24:16] ready
[24:19] this is the one most important
[24:21] scriptures in the book
[24:23] what does it do it tells the closing of
[24:26] the
[24:26] jewish nation the jewish people
[24:30] the scripture the 70th week it discloses
[24:34] and tells exactly from the time that
[24:37] daniel started there until the
[24:41] end of the consummation it's one of the
[24:44] greatest time pieces
[24:46] how many churnies say if you won't know
[24:47] what day of the week it is look at the
[24:49] calendar
[24:49] you want to know what time we're living
[24:51] in watch the jews
[24:53] right there's god's calendar taken from
[24:56] right here
[24:58] any theologian any bible scholar anyone
[25:01] will tell you
[25:01] that this is the timepiece hey about the
[25:04] jews
[25:07] now what time we got but just
[25:10] people hot oh boy it has nothing
[25:14] to do with the gentiles
[25:17] these seven sealed seven flags seven
[25:20] more seven trumpets
[25:21] have not one thing to do the gentile
[25:24] church will be in glory at that time
[25:27] don't have nothing to do with us the
[25:29] gentile church
[25:30] it only deals with israel
[25:34] daniel thy people and jerusalem
[25:39] now and discloses the facts
[25:43] that god deals only with the jews when
[25:47] they are
[25:47] in their homeland amen hallelujah that's
[25:51] where i think you hit the core right
[25:53] there
[25:55] they're always trying to allow from the
[25:58] time
[25:59] that israel was there at daniel's time
[26:04] and one great writer because i know some
[26:06] of his followers are sitting here i
[26:08] won't say it but that's the reason they
[26:10] had all this false stuff
[26:12] did you know how the miller knights
[26:13] before they came 70 adventists
[26:15] what they did up here in 19 and 19 got
[26:17] their wings you all sent the courier
[26:19] paper he got up here to fly away that
[26:20] morning
[26:21] that was taking daniel 70 a week
[26:26] miller knight then later on by miss
[26:28] ellen white
[26:29] which was their prophetess turned around
[26:32] and called themselves
[26:33] 70 adventists and now they change their
[26:34] name to the voice of prophecy
[26:38] three different names for the same cuff
[26:41] now but they were wrong
[26:45] because they were trying to apply those
[26:47] 70 weeks
[26:48] to both jew and gentile and he says here
[26:51] it's for thy people
[26:54] and god never did
[26:57] deal with the jew out of palestine
[27:00] and when the messiah the seventy in two
[27:03] weeks was cut off
[27:06] not for himself or us
[27:09] was cut off israel was scattered and has
[27:12] not
[27:13] never come back to their homeland unless
[27:15] the last few years
[27:18] so time wasn't counted in there from the
[27:21] church age
[27:25] you get it would be 19 and 19.
[27:30] i can show something happen to 19 and 19
[27:33] well that's when that
[27:34] angel third angel's message struck and
[27:36] the war went for
[27:38] exactly but it wasn't that was when the
[27:40] war stopped in a mysterious way we get
[27:42] that in the seventh chapter when we get
[27:43] to it
[27:45] let me get to the seventh chapter you
[27:47] all heard me preach that many times
[27:49] i think when the angels best said hold
[27:52] the four winds of the earth shall we
[27:53] seal the jews the servant
[27:55] and now they kept waiting to all the
[27:56] gentile age that moved out then when
[27:58] they come in
[27:59] then then he seals the jews 144 000
[28:01] receives the holy ghost
[28:05] there's 144 000 seal
[28:08] revelation 7 you've read it i saw a
[28:10] great number already in heaven
[28:12] john's on of all kinder tongues the
[28:14] nation
[28:16] and they stood before god with palms in
[28:18] their hands and white robes on
[28:20] saying hallelujah amen glory wisdom
[28:24] honor my
[28:25] power be to our god forever and ever
[28:28] amen
[28:30] couldn't understand them but he looked
[28:31] back and he saw mount sinai
[28:33] glory 144
[28:37] 000 that had not been defiled with women
[28:43] jews women churches they enjoy no
[28:46] organizations lutheran methodist baptist
[28:48] and presbyterian
[28:49] but they have been jews from the
[28:51] beginning
[28:52] orthodox and had their temple they're
[28:54] worshiping
[28:56] on mount sinai that's 144
[28:59] 000. that's after this the church is
[29:02] done in glory
[29:04] [Music]
[29:05] so mr smith was wrong had to be
[29:08] because how you going to apply that down
[29:10] here in 1919 take 144 000 then you're
[29:12] back and wrestle light again
[29:15] then you're right back to the russellite
[29:17] doctrine that jesus come in 19 and 14
[29:20] 1919 he took his church and now he's a
[29:23] mystic body going around over the earth
[29:25] ray going to grandma's grave and
[29:26] grandpa's grave and raised them all up
[29:28] all those that were russell lights
[29:30] nonsense amen it don't make sense in the
[29:32] world it won't come out right
[29:34] amen no sir it doesn't amen
[29:37] but god's got the truth yeah god's the
[29:39] one who can reveal it and place it in
[29:41] there and show it exactly to him
[29:44] hallelujah and i believe he'll do it
[29:47] amen
[29:48] i don't know it i'm telling you the
[29:49] truth i do not know but i'm believing
[29:51] amen i'm believing that he will
[29:54] so you see god never did deal with the
[29:57] jews i want you to keep this in mind
[29:59] as long as israel that's what i try to
[30:02] tell this brother sitting over here
[30:04] let's talk about going to israel stay
[30:05] away from israel am i
[30:08] stay away from it all you people talk
[30:10] about converting the jews
[30:11] before this message is over you'll see
[30:13] it's thus saith the lord by
[30:14] word and by spirit amen israel be
[30:17] converted over the whole nation in one
[30:19] night
[30:20] the bible said so but the gospel is not
[30:23] even to them
[30:24] there's a few renegades that's out and
[30:26] so forth like that they come in and
[30:28] outside the main body of jews that come
[30:30] and get saved that's true
[30:32] i believe that with all my my heart but
[30:34] remember as long
[30:36] as israel's out of their nation they
[30:38] cannot be saved
[30:39] now they are returning and they will be
[30:41] saved all the whole nation in one day
[30:44] amen the bible said so one day we'll
[30:47] bring
[30:47] completely all israel right back to god
[30:50] praise the lord
[30:51] there will be such a mighty thing strike
[30:54] israel one of these days
[30:56] until shake the whole nation hallelujah
[31:01] even the prophet cried out and said and
[31:03] one day has thou did this
[31:06] and one day they will see it
[31:10] there will be a mighty thing my opinion
[31:13] it'll be a
[31:14] mighty prophet that will rise and stand
[31:16] before israel
[31:18] [Music]
[32:04] you
