[0:52] come up here5 but it's always a pleasure
[0:56] to me to speak to God's people at any
[0:58] time because I feel as they said in the
[1:01] battle time I'm one of them and to be
[1:05] Associated here with such a lovely group
[1:08] through the week I have certainly
[1:09] enjoyed eventually all these wonderful
[1:12] testimonies of the Brethren who has gave
[1:15] us these great testimonies of their
[1:18] healing and of their the businessman who
[1:21] has told us of their how of business
[1:25] prospered and brother Garder last
[1:27] evening I appreciated his test
[1:30] talk and so many things have happened
[1:32] and I have come to get full as U I said
[1:37] W boo CL one time said that down in
[1:41] London England that they was he was
[1:44] walking around with a police one night
[1:46] because he missed his car couldn't go
[1:48] home his Stree car it's too late and it
[1:52] was raining and said he found a man that
[1:54] was over intoxicated laying in the
[1:56] street so they just picked him up and
[1:59] throwed him in the p wagon take him over
[2:02] put him in the jail Mr said well down
[2:04] the of the Salvation Army said well we
[2:08] would take him in fix him up give him a
[2:11] hot bath and give him some coffee and
[2:13] stuff said you still let him lay on the
[2:16] floor sure I won't hurt
[2:17] him so uh why do you mean it won't hurt
[2:20] him nobody's too full of drinks but so
[2:23] whiskey so much any got po get filled up
[2:25] the cold and stuff can't get in I think
[2:28] that's the way I meeting so filled up
[2:30] with the Holy Spirit a world the devil
[2:32] don't even have it
[2:35] hand this thing just keeps coming off
[2:37] he's not supposed to hold my
[2:40] hand one of the outstanding things that
[2:43] struck me greatly among the testimonies
[2:46] which they've all been very great but
[2:48] one of the things was the testimony of
[2:51] the brother fman
[2:52] [Music]
[2:54] brother of his uh how the Lord dealt a
[3:00] brother Crown how many heard his
[3:03] testimony Dr ham and I were talking
[3:05] about a little later and now you see
[3:10] brother Krauss being a very fine
[3:13] Christian he had tried hard he's good
[3:16] friend and are a friend to brother or
[3:19] Roberts had prayed for him and he didn't
[3:23] seem to get any different then he
[3:25] thought oh brother Brandon prayed for me
[3:28] you know all right so well I pray for
[3:31] him no different I stood by him for 45
[3:36] minutes almost one day in his lovely
[3:38] wife to see if the Lord would speak an A
[3:41] Vision to say something to him but
[3:43] nothing happened and then finally at the
[3:47] hospital when the doctors was operated
[3:50] and giving no hope or not much hope of
[3:53] ever seen come through again then when
[3:57] he was at the end of his Ro then
[4:01] father's gra set
[4:03] in and the glory of the Lord came down
[4:06] on him and the room and he would just
[4:09] said just fa in God's
[4:12] Beauty and
[4:14] when love has been
[4:16] projected then it's time for a Sovereign
[4:19] Grace to step in it'll do it every
[4:23] time you the strange thing of how we
[4:27] human beings like to do things ourselves
[4:31] but we are children of God and many
[4:33] times we have to just take a seat and
[4:35] sit down till God comes around and does
[4:36] it his
[4:38] way
[4:41] and noticed a little child I was just
[4:43] sitting back there a few moments ago
[4:45] talking to a very fine medical doctor
[4:47] from Chicago who I had the privilege of
[4:50] having breakfast with this morning and
[4:53] we were speaking and you perhaps you
[4:56] knows this I'm sure many times you have
[4:59] a little child and he gets on a little
[5:02] uh temper tantrum we call it our home oh
[5:06] he's just scking and squealing and going
[5:08] on he's going to tear up everything and
[5:10] go to hold his
[5:11] bread and usually a mother will come and
[5:14] shakeing and throw him up in the air and
[5:16] try to get him get his best I don't
[5:17] think this the case in history Bo
[5:19] whatever remember
[5:21] died he just has to run to the end of
[5:24] his road and then nature takes
[5:28] over that's way with us Christians
[5:31] sometime we just have to run to the end
[5:32] of the road to let Grace take over we
[5:35] have to run all our theology out so God
[5:37] can really get the
[5:39] word you believe
[5:42] that
[5:44] and God does work in mysterious ways his
[5:47] wonders to
[5:49] perform now I've noticed this that each
[5:52] one of us as Sons and Daughters of God
[5:55] many times I have thought of
[5:58] Pentecost well said they were all in one
[6:01] place and one
[6:03] Accord now where there Unity what was
[6:08] power and then if we only knew that each
[6:12] one of us in a um amateur way is a
[6:18] Creator uh we are sure that you
[6:21] understand that youing the little
[6:24] success that the Lord has given me as
[6:27] I'm to testify this morning
[6:30] of success is because of this one thing
[6:34] that the patients that I'm praying for
[6:37] in the SI line I have to enter into
[6:40] their Fellowship of suffering with
[6:43] them and that's the reason I can't have
[6:46] a line where you just run through like a
[6:48] bunch of sheep coming to a yard You' got
[6:52] to feel the the need of that individual
[6:57] is standing before you if you don't
[6:59] don't you can't have the feeling of it
[7:02] like Paul Raider once said said he was
[7:05] going to work one morning so he in his
[7:08] wife had a little well of disagreement
[7:12] and he said as he started out he Ked his
[7:15] wife goodbye she was crying but he
[7:17] always walked out the the gate turn back
[7:19] and said bye she say goodbye so that
[7:22] morning went the same routine pass F and
[7:24] said goodbye and she said goodbye then
[7:27] he went out the street and begin to
[7:28] think something happened to me today or
[7:31] something happened to her that I know we
[7:33] never meet again in this
[7:35] chur you got to thinking about it and
[7:37] said God began to deal with you you ran
[7:40] back to the house real quick jerk open
[7:42] the door just standing behind the door
[7:44] still weeping said he never said one
[7:46] word to her but just pulled her around
[7:48] and kissed her again turn that back
[7:50] around went out went to G came back and
[7:52] said goodbye but she said goodbye back
[7:56] she did it said the the difference was
[7:58] the last time there was a feeling
[8:03] in so that's the way it is there's got
[8:08] to be a
[8:09] feeling there's got to be something that
[8:13] that's projected from you to meet the
[8:16] person you're talking to you me the go
[8:21] down in Mexico we were talking down
[8:26] there and on the platform there was an
[8:27] old man came to the platform who was
[8:29] blind I looked down his old wrinkles
[8:32] feet and they were probably never had a
[8:34] pair of shoes just all the full old man
[8:38] and he want to kneel down and take out
[8:39] his Rosary for prayer eat and what the
[8:42] sa I raised him up and to The
[8:45] Interpreter I said no need of doing that
[8:48] but when he put his arms around
[8:52] Bri I thought you know and my dadd would
[8:55] live just been about his
[8:58] age with a pair of shoes on I look down
[9:00] and it wasn't fit him or I to give him a
[9:04] shoe but to feel that whole man so
[9:10] deed and Z know after all of that never
[9:16] maybe a good meal no clothes Harry to
[9:18] wear maybe life had had a lot of burdens
[9:21] that only a a man of H like you would
[9:26] know than to be shut off and darkness
[9:30] where he couldn't see something inside
[9:33] him began to bed oh God that poor Mort a
[9:37] man like I am as a healing he loves eats
[9:42] drinks Liv he's a man and he's in this
[9:47] condition while praying for him put my
[9:50] arms around him his old hands ran across
[9:53] the shoulder P I said heavenly father if
[9:57] this would make me feel to him like that
[9:59] what does it do to you in a few moments
[10:02] I heard him screaming and going on he
[10:04] received
[10:06] his now what it is is love and love my
[10:13] brethen I realized I'm sending here this
[10:15] morning with a seventh grade education
[10:17] talking to
[10:18] father but no make make any difference
[10:22] of how much Theology and how many ways
[10:25] we turn into scriptures to make it sit
[10:27] our point
[10:29] there never nothing take the place of
[10:33] love where that they see for it'll
[10:37] vanish with his knowledge it'll do the
[10:39] same thing but love will endure
[10:42] forever and if we this morning as
[10:46] Christian people and facing the great
[10:49] crisis that's on this Earth
[10:51] today and in meetings like this if we
[10:54] can concentrate for one thing the
[10:56] purpose in our heart that we love the AR
[10:59] of the Lord Jesus that we could
[11:02] see the other evening while speaking in
[11:05] the Tabernacle Church behind the
[11:08] placees seeking on
[11:12] love and how that we must have the
[11:15] healing of the people we must feel for
[11:18] them and love them love is the greatest
[11:22] weapon that God ever put into the hands
[11:24] of
[11:26] man and through that you can't fool
[11:30] people you think you knowing I was a
[11:33] game
[11:34] conserv my mother's a have Indian and I
[11:39] I love out go and just a little s line
[11:43] now to life to let you
[11:45] know what I mean when I'm speaking
[11:50] this until the bir gets on the Christian
[11:55] church for lost soul were fight in the
[11:58] air
[12:01] let us stop as seeking I believe in
[12:04] gifts and signs and wonders while firmly
[12:06] let go put the body but let's not touch
[12:09] that ahead of love and lost soul let's
[12:12] get into a burden on our hearts the Holy
[12:15] Spirit marking the Jews in the first
[12:18] Jerusalem he only come to those who sigh
[12:21] and cried for the Abomination that was
[12:24] done in the midst of the city and I
[12:27] perhaps this morning would take us to
[12:29] this challenge all the glory all the
[12:32] power all that God has given to us here
[12:34] in this meeting and the great things
[12:36] that we've seen how many L on their face
[12:38] right now and cried inside for the
[12:40] Abominations of
[12:41] Minneapolis there you are he only Mark
[12:44] those
[12:45] kind now to show how love is
[12:50] projected this is you might laugh at
[12:52] this but it's it's true is unst
[12:55] understanding
[12:57] here sometimes
[13:00] I was out in a field when I was Game
[13:03] Warden and they had been a a bull had
[13:06] killed a color man at the Burke Farm
[13:09] just below where I live great gery Bull
[13:13] and he had had been sold away to another
[13:17] man and he just turned him mve into the
[13:20] pasture and I knew that bll was there
[13:22] but I never thought I was over on the
[13:25] criek Turning Lo some fish and I thought
[13:28] of a man that call for me to go pray for
[13:30] him so going up across the hills to pray
[13:34] for the man being about perhaps 3 or 400
[13:37] yard from the fence in a little clump of
[13:40] bushes this gery Bo was bed down
[13:44] there and when I got close to him he
[13:46] raised
[13:47] up and he was a
[13:51] killer I look back to the fence there
[13:54] was too far me to run he too close to me
[13:58] so there was no tree for me to get
[14:01] into well I thought this is the
[14:04] end I can't go no farther or if I try to
[14:09] run you'll catch me so what can I do now
[14:14] that's when we come to these crisis that
[14:17] when s Grace steps
[14:20] in then something happened in my life
[14:25] that I wish it would if it ever comes
[14:28] again that it'll never leave and I only
[14:32] wish that there was some way that I had
[14:35] the power this morning to project this
[14:37] to this group of men and women here they
[14:40] will never leave you like in the AMC of
[14:44] for up the orgon when he ran through the
[14:47] platform to kill me many of you said
[14:48] that b something happened there you've
[14:52] also wondered guess how those things
[14:54] happen if something in the F of
[14:57] despising that man though he was there
[14:59] to take my life a Divine love set in for
[15:04] him and he called me a hypocrite the the
[15:07] grass thousands of people saying St the
[15:10] face threw back his F and said I'll
[15:11] break every Bor in your body people
[15:14] probably say here was there but instead
[15:16] of despising a
[15:18] man something grace came
[15:22] in in the moment when I needed
[15:26] it Grace Ste in
[15:29] and projected a Divine love into my
[15:32] heart I could project to him and talk
[15:35] their sins of man like a man like
[15:38] I but he he likes to eat and drink and
[15:42] his family but the devil has him
[15:46] bound so the love of God can stre me and
[15:50] the man humble himself and across my
[15:54] feet Grace step in When Love was
[16:00] protected and in the case of this fool
[16:02] trying to kill me he got up on his feet
[16:06] looked at me and S three or four times
[16:09] and thr his horns into the
[16:11] ground I looked around there was nothing
[16:15] and as a officer I supposed to pack a
[16:17] gun and I would have Glide and had it I
[16:20] would have kill the bull and they went p
[16:22] on but I had no
[16:26] gun god came to her but I had no gun so
[16:30] he wanted to
[16:33] show his divine grace in a crist's
[16:39] hour and something struck
[16:43] me way better than a gun or any weapon
[16:46] of this world it was the divine grace
[16:50] that struck my heart and thinking of
[16:53] that animal wanted to live as same as I
[16:56] wanted to live
[16:59] and instead of hating him as he was
[17:01] tending to take my life I love
[17:05] him that sounds
[17:08] juvenile but it's a
[17:12] [Music]
[17:27] truth
[17:32] [Music]
