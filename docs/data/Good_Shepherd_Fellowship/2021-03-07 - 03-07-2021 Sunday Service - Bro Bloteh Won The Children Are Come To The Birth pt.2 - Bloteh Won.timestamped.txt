[54:38] that is in you amen
[54:40] amen amen that word that you have
[54:42] received of christ
[54:43] so this morning we want to talk about
[54:45] the children that come to the birth now
[54:47] you have to remember
[54:48] we said last week we were not talking
[54:50] about the mothers we're not talking
[54:51] about the mothers we were talking about
[54:53] the children
[54:54] you know because by nature god designed
[54:57] it that when that child has grown
[54:59] to maturity in the womb whether whether
[55:02] it's a chick in the head
[55:04] whether it's a baby in a warm the food
[55:07] that if
[55:07] that they have been fed on and then the
[55:10] right atmosphere and the right exercise
[55:13] and the right treatment
[55:14] will give that child such a strength
[55:18] at the time of birth amen
[55:22] and life is going to come forth praise
[55:25] the lord so the children
[55:27] i come to the birth amen
[55:30] amen and so we we won't look at yet our
[55:35] mother
[55:36] rachel amen uh
[55:39] uh the scripture says here uh
[55:43] this is uh genesis chapter 35 was word
[55:47] jacob has has
[55:48] met the angel amen you go back to verse
[55:51] one he had met the angel or the angel
[55:54] met him
[55:55] one of the two but there was a meeting
[55:56] that went on
[55:58] praise the lord whether he met the angel
[56:01] or the angel met him there was a meeting
[56:03] that went on and he did not walk the
[56:04] scene praise the lord so it will be the
[56:07] same whether you meet god or god meets
[56:09] you you can never be the same after that
[56:11] meeting
[56:12] praise the lord amen so jacob have just
[56:15] met the angel
[56:16] and the angel you know has has uh has
[56:19] ministered to him
[56:21] and and uh and then he was
[56:24] he was living there now and uh and you
[56:27] know and on his way
[56:29] now right in that time uh
[56:33] richard was close to giving birth
[56:38] but i want to bring your attention to
[56:40] something here that i want to
[56:41] that i want to slide into this genesis
[56:44] chapter 10 to 1. let's go back
[56:47] a little bit amen
[56:51] genesis chapter 10 one let's go back
[56:56] if you familiar with my preaching you
[56:58] will know that i love my bible
[57:01] amen amen i love to read this bible
[57:04] amen and i'm sure you do the same
[57:08] amen genesis chapter 10 1 will bring us
[57:11] to a story here where
[57:12] jacob was about leaving his
[57:14] father-in-law's house
[57:16] lobby after he had worked he have you
[57:18] know
[57:19] uh give raise his family and uh
[57:22] and he have gotten some wealth god
[57:25] started to deal with him because he was
[57:26] seeing that things were changing
[57:28] one time he was loved by leban but now
[57:31] and things are beginning to change
[57:33] and the lord told him to get away and so
[57:36] he was afraid of lobbying
[57:40] and then he decided to steal himself
[57:42] away
[57:43] which means he decided to sneak with his
[57:45] family out of the house
[57:46] but something happened right in that
[57:49] time let's follow a little bit here
[57:51] verse uh
[57:54] 19 let's start from verse 19 and lobby
[57:57] went
[57:58] to share his sheep and richard has
[58:01] stolen the images that
[58:05] were her father's now
[58:08] let's put the story into context
[58:11] jacob having the feeling to leave and
[58:14] god dealing with his heart he put he set
[58:16] his wife down
[58:18] and he told them he said see what is
[58:20] happening and i'm losing favor with your
[58:21] dad
[58:22] and uh and we have to get and and i have
[58:25] to get out of here the lord god has
[58:27] spoken to me
[58:27] and all of that he said and and and in
[58:30] the in the in the scripture
[58:33] his wife said uh
[58:37] i mean we don't even have anything we
[58:39] don't have no inheritance of our father
[58:43] he have even saw us and he have not even
[58:45] given us any benefit
[58:48] praise the lord so if you keep that in
[58:50] context
[58:51] you will now understand why richard had
[58:54] to take her father
[58:55] images now these images it is not
[58:58] in the context of a false god
[59:02] nor because the lord god spoke to
[59:04] lobbying
[59:07] that very same night these images is
[59:10] more in a sense that loving was a
[59:12] businessman perhaps
[59:13] and then he bought you know he bought
[59:16] images that worth money because
[59:18] she was taking it away not as a god to
[59:21] worship
[59:22] but she was taken away as as an
[59:24] inheritance
[59:27] maybe to sell along the way
[59:30] so she can she can feel like i've got
[59:33] something from my father's house
[59:37] are we together amen amen
[59:41] i mean if if if laban would run after
[59:44] uh after jacob you know for those
[59:47] images then which means the wolf
[59:50] they were very expensive and they were
[59:53] very meaningful to him
[59:57] that's right are we together amen now so
[1:00:00] richard she stole her father
[1:00:04] images and as the story would go on
[1:00:08] let's drop down to verse 30.
[1:00:12] but one thing you want we want to keep
[1:00:14] in our mind here
[1:00:15] is that jacob never knew about it
[1:00:20] amen she never told jacob about it
[1:00:26] that's there's a
[1:00:28] that's a flashing red light
[1:00:32] that's a bad sign right
[1:00:36] amen right because when akam
[1:00:39] stole the babylonian gaming he never
[1:00:42] told his wife about it
[1:00:44] he never told his children about it but
[1:00:47] when god was about to deal with icon
[1:00:51] it cost him his entire family
[1:00:57] are we together amen
[1:01:00] verse teddy
[1:01:06] and now this is uh uh 11
[1:01:10] speaking to jacob he have ran after
[1:01:12] jacob
[1:01:13] verse 26 you will see it in 11 said unto
[1:01:15] jacob what have that done
[1:01:20] and he went on and said all of this
[1:01:21] verse 30. and now
[1:01:23] though thou will that need be gone
[1:01:26] because they are so longer
[1:01:30] after their father's house yet wherefore
[1:01:32] have thou
[1:01:33] stolen my gods
[1:01:37] praise the lord amen now
[1:01:40] and jacob answered and said to levin
[1:01:45] because i was
[1:01:48] afraid for i said periventure
[1:01:52] thou who they take by false that
[1:01:54] daughters from me
[1:01:58] with whomsoever thou founded thy gods
[1:02:02] let him not live
[1:02:05] before our brethren discern
[1:02:09] doubt what is done with me
[1:02:14] and uh and take it today
[1:02:18] for jacob knew net that richard
[1:02:22] has stolen them now i want us to
[1:02:25] to underline that verse 32
[1:02:29] because we will come back to it now
[1:02:32] today
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:36] now jacob now knowing that
[1:02:39] rachel has taken this he said
[1:02:44] with womb you find your gods
[1:02:48] let that person die
[1:02:52] praise the lord amen now you have to
[1:02:55] realize
[1:02:56] that god was dealing with this man
[1:02:59] though he had trouble along the way
[1:03:01] though
[1:03:02] he stole the blessing though he he he
[1:03:04] you know he
[1:03:05] he cheated on the sheeps and all of that
[1:03:08] but god
[1:03:08] was dealing with this man
[1:03:12] praise the lord amen amen amen
[1:03:17] and and and he said that
[1:03:20] out of an earnest heart
[1:03:23] because as far as he's concerned
[1:03:27] there is nothing like that under his
[1:03:29] roof
[1:03:31] as far as he concerned his wife would
[1:03:33] have told him if she knew anything about
[1:03:36] it
[1:03:38] and then you can read the rest of the
[1:03:39] story the bible went on and she's uh
[1:03:41] you know and and and and and a lot of
[1:03:44] them went into jacobs 10 and into leo
[1:03:47] stan and
[1:03:48] you know now rachel has has taken the
[1:03:50] images and put them
[1:03:52] you know uh in in the camden furniture
[1:03:55] and sat upon them
[1:03:57] you know and she told her father you
[1:03:58] know i can't move because you know
[1:04:00] uh this time of a woman is upon me i
[1:04:04] please don't don't don't make me to wake
[1:04:06] up and he checked every word and he
[1:04:07] didn't add
[1:04:08] he didn't he didn't see the image so he
[1:04:10] believed going away
[1:04:12] that jacob did not hide his his images
[1:04:15] or his gods
[1:04:16] and then uh uh
[1:04:21] all along the journey you know i mean
[1:04:24] the the bible
[1:04:25] uh give us this account and
[1:04:28] you know and never give us the rest of
[1:04:30] the story praise the lord
[1:04:32] the rest of the story in the fact of
[1:04:34] whether rachel
[1:04:36] ever told jacob what was going on with
[1:04:39] with those images that she talking
[1:04:41] in one of you because you have to
[1:04:43] realize that right after that jacob and
[1:04:45] leban went into a coveted
[1:04:47] you know he just let the lobby between
[1:04:49] me and they
[1:04:51] and uh and they made a covet in there
[1:04:53] but
[1:04:54] this is this is where i'm coming to with
[1:04:56] this whole thing
[1:04:57] jacob has just said
[1:05:01] if there is one that have taken this
[1:05:04] praise the lord
[1:05:05] amen let that one die
[1:05:10] least did he know he had just spoken the
[1:05:14] word
[1:05:16] concerning his wife
[1:05:20] jephthah went to a battle
[1:05:24] georges chapter 11
[1:05:28] and the lord he sucked the face of the
[1:05:30] lord
[1:05:33] and he said lord you know i've been
[1:05:35] estranged from my brothers
[1:05:36] rejected but now they have come to me
[1:05:39] that i should fight for them
[1:05:43] lord if you give me the victory the
[1:05:45] first thing that ran out of my house
[1:05:48] i would sacrifice sacrificed little did
[1:05:51] he know it was going to be his only
[1:05:53] daughter
[1:05:55] praise the lord when you're dealing with
[1:05:58] god you don't play with words
[1:06:02] because god is worth himself
[1:06:05] amen praise the lord amen
[1:06:08] amen and uh just like brother branham
[1:06:13] said in the church
[1:06:14] ages we we learn to encourage ourselves
[1:06:16] in the things that are right and
[1:06:17] discourage the things that are wrong
[1:06:20] you know we we we saw the uh as
[1:06:23] chapter five what happened to ananias
[1:06:26] and so far
[1:06:27] you know so it's it's all through the
[1:06:28] bible
[1:06:30] you know it's all through the bible you
[1:06:32] cannot outsmart god
[1:06:36] praise the lord you can ask my god
[1:06:39] and and especially when you come on the
[1:06:41] under the marriage covenant and you
[1:06:43] expect your god to bless your home
[1:06:45] you know and all of that we have to be
[1:06:49] transparent with one another
[1:06:54] praise the lord amen because one thing
[1:06:57] that
[1:06:58] uh one one one one thing one mistake
[1:07:01] that you may
[1:07:02] you know uh uh see also that is written
[1:07:05] in the bible
[1:07:05] you know if if if if if a child is
[1:07:09] living in a father's house which is a
[1:07:11] girl
[1:07:12] and then she goes out and make a vow and
[1:07:14] all of that if the father don't know
[1:07:16] about it he has the right to
[1:07:18] ignore that vow why because she's he
[1:07:21] she's honored his hair shape
[1:07:23] and she must not go out and just do
[1:07:25] things without
[1:07:27] consulting him also the woman that's
[1:07:30] what the scripture says if the woman
[1:07:32] goes out and make a vow to the temple
[1:07:34] you know we will build you a new temple
[1:07:36] we will break this altar down and she
[1:07:38] did not tell her husband and the husband
[1:07:40] gets to know about it he has the right
[1:07:42] to ignore that
[1:07:46] praise the lord now the reason of that
[1:07:49] is because
[1:07:52] the marriage coveted and the family
[1:07:54] coveting
[1:07:55] is a covenant of protection
[1:08:01] it's a covenant of protection
[1:08:07] praise the lord are we together
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:17] and i mean we can going on we can go on
[1:08:19] and on
[1:08:21] you know with uh with uh
[1:08:26] with with different examples but i'm
[1:08:28] trying just to set a scene here
[1:08:31] you know uh uh uh
[1:08:34] to create a picture here and uh
[1:08:38] in our mind you know because
[1:08:41] i don't believe that that uh
[1:08:44] that jose i mean jacob and rachel was
[1:08:47] even looking up to this
[1:08:50] see her sister leah is the older sister
[1:08:53] and leah has had had more children than
[1:08:55] richard hi
[1:08:59] praise the lord amen
[1:09:02] amen now i'm not i'm not giving you
[1:09:04] scriptural interpretation because it's
[1:09:06] not my place
[1:09:07] it's a prophet place to interpret
[1:09:09] scripture but i'm just trying to create
[1:09:11] a picture
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:16] praise the lord
[1:09:20] mean that i mean as as christian we
[1:09:22] don't play with words that's what the
[1:09:23] strip just said let your yeah be
[1:09:24] yet and your nade name
[1:09:29] we have to be truthful we have to be we
[1:09:32] have to be
[1:09:33] transparent we have to get one another
[1:09:36] involved
[1:09:41] like i've said and i've always said i've
[1:09:43] always believed this
[1:09:44] you're having all of these independent
[1:09:46] believers
[1:09:48] you know that live their independent
[1:09:51] lives
[1:09:52] you know they are not questionable to
[1:09:54] anybody they get their revelation
[1:09:56] praise the lord but yet
[1:10:00] with their independent life they want to
[1:10:01] be part of a body
[1:10:03] it does not work like that that's right
[1:10:07] it does not work like that
[1:10:10] no matter where you come from and what
[1:10:12] you know
[1:10:13] if you if you are part of this body you
[1:10:15] must be subject to what this local
[1:10:17] church believes
[1:10:19] if you don't agree with it our doors are
[1:10:21] open for you to come and visit
[1:10:24] you know we love those long-term
[1:10:26] visitors
[1:10:28] we don't forget about them so easily
[1:10:35] but it's a body when you live together
[1:10:38] as a family
[1:10:41] you cannot be independent in the family
[1:10:47] jesus said if you're not gathering you
[1:10:49] are scattering
[1:10:52] amen think about you know in the feeling
[1:10:55] and people are gathering apples and this
[1:10:58] guy is not working but he's the one
[1:11:00] talking
[1:11:01] it's going to be less work because he's
[1:11:04] just distracting people that are working
[1:11:07] he has all the storage you know when i
[1:11:10] used to be to this place
[1:11:11] and this this person is trying to do
[1:11:13] some work and they're looking at him
[1:11:14] look at me let me let me show you this
[1:11:18] but you think about it if every hands is
[1:11:20] at work
[1:11:21] and you are and you are telling story
[1:11:23] that we can live and we are all working
[1:11:25] the world go more faster than when you
[1:11:27] fall your hands
[1:11:28] and stand on the banks you want to be
[1:11:31] giving instruction
[1:11:32] but you don't want to touch what is what
[1:11:34] is being done
[1:11:35] it don't work like that family unit
[1:11:38] don't work like that
[1:11:40] church don't work like that marriages
[1:11:43] don't work
[1:11:44] like that
[1:11:49] praise the lord what am i preaching on
[1:11:50] this morning
[1:11:52] what is taking me down this trail amen
[1:11:56] glory be to god but
[1:12:00] here he said something has been sold in
[1:12:03] this home
[1:12:06] and jacob trying to be
[1:12:09] truthful and trying to be transparent to
[1:12:12] his father-in-law
[1:12:14] he says it would have been better for
[1:12:17] him to say
[1:12:17] i don't know about it i never took your
[1:12:20] images
[1:12:22] i don't know about it but he been
[1:12:26] so convinced that he know of his
[1:12:29] household
[1:12:32] he know of his house he know his that he
[1:12:35] know
[1:12:36] the things his children are doing he
[1:12:38] know the things his wife
[1:12:40] are doing because they communicate he
[1:12:42] says if you find
[1:12:43] this let the person die
[1:12:50] now you have to know that lebanon didn't
[1:12:52] find it
[1:12:53] but god knows who took it amen
[1:12:59] you can hide it and make all the excuses
[1:13:02] that we will never know but there is a
[1:13:05] sovereign god
[1:13:07] that you are dealing with
[1:13:13] praise the lord amen amen
[1:13:16] well whoever pulling me down that road
[1:13:18] you just take your break a little bit
[1:13:20] because i have a message here to preach
[1:13:22] amen
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:27] so we come to genesis 35 verse 15.
[1:13:32] and jacob gets to this place after he
[1:13:35] have met the angel
[1:13:36] let's just deal with some few things
[1:13:38] here
[1:13:39] and jacob called the name of the place
[1:13:42] where
[1:13:42] god speak with him bether
[1:13:46] and we all know the alpha means
[1:13:49] the house of god amen
[1:13:52] it means the house of god uh
[1:13:55] an an ancient place and seat of worship
[1:13:59] in ephraim on the border of benjamin
[1:14:04] belther means the house of god
[1:14:07] are we together amen and the bible says
[1:14:11] year
[1:14:12] verse 16 and they're joining from belter
[1:14:17] and there was bought a little ways to
[1:14:20] come
[1:14:21] to ephrata amen
[1:14:24] so they were just between belter
[1:14:27] and e frother now that that is the
[1:14:31] region
[1:14:31] that that is that is that was now called
[1:14:33] beth to him
[1:14:35] that region between belton and ephrata
[1:14:38] but before
[1:14:38] it was buffed to him so uh they were in
[1:14:41] this journey just a little way to get to
[1:14:43] ephrata and
[1:14:45] and and and rachel
[1:14:48] birth pain came on her i mean
[1:14:52] now i was looking at the word ephrata
[1:14:56] just like we look at belter
[1:15:00] an ephrata means
[1:15:07] a heap of arches an
[1:15:10] arch heap praise the lord
[1:15:14] amen it means also
[1:15:18] a place of fruitfulness
[1:15:21] now how can a place of arches
[1:15:24] become a place of fruitfulness well
[1:15:27] that's the reason why the burns farm
[1:15:31] when the trees are cut down that's what
[1:15:34] the brain found
[1:15:35] because the trees when they are burned
[1:15:38] the arches
[1:15:39] now become fertilizer to make them feel
[1:15:43] truthful praise the lord amen
[1:15:48] amen because there is fruitfulness
[1:15:51] in arches glory be to god
[1:15:54] amen oh my goodness
[1:15:57] amen i feel like there is not enough
[1:16:00] room here for me to preach i might run
[1:16:01] through this wall
[1:16:04] amen
[1:16:06] when i look at that last night what i
[1:16:08] was telling
[1:16:10] and saw that ephrata means
[1:16:14] an arch heap i could not help
[1:16:18] but think about job
[1:16:24] glory be to god oh
[1:16:27] my amen
[1:16:31] let's read this god seven job let's read
[1:16:34] this a little bit
[1:16:35] notice what happened then then he broke
[1:16:38] out in balls and set out on the arch
[1:16:41] heap
[1:16:43] out there stripping himself with
[1:16:46] a croc or something his wife comes to
[1:16:48] the door
[1:16:49] all his friends were gone three church
[1:16:52] members came down
[1:16:54] turned their back on him for seven days
[1:16:57] wouldn't even speak to him accuse him of
[1:16:59] being a secret sinner
[1:17:01] not not much consolation
[1:17:05] from the church then amen the church has
[1:17:08] failed
[1:17:09] no consolation from the church i mean
[1:17:12] people go to church they just go
[1:17:14] i mean i mean you don't get the comfort
[1:17:16] that you should be able to get because
[1:17:18] the oil is in christ now secret sinner
[1:17:22] listen job knew in his heart
[1:17:25] that he wasn't a secret sinner he did
[1:17:29] confess his sin
[1:17:30] upon the base of the sheer blood and
[1:17:33] he knew that god was on an
[1:17:36] obligation to meet him on the basis of
[1:17:40] death and we say amen now so
[1:17:43] the thing yet is that job
[1:17:47] where job got the arches from
[1:17:51] to pull over himself was the very same
[1:17:54] place
[1:17:55] where he was making sacrifice for his
[1:17:58] children
[1:18:02] the scripture make us to know that job
[1:18:04] makes sacrifice
[1:18:06] every year whether it was an wallet
[1:18:08] whether it was monthly
[1:18:09] he made sacrifice and burn offering for
[1:18:12] his children
[1:18:12] and said perhaps maybe my children are
[1:18:14] wrong or maybe my children is doing this
[1:18:17] and he made sacrifice to that place
[1:18:19] until
[1:18:20] it became a heap of arches
[1:18:25] could that be the very same place that
[1:18:27] rachel died you think about it
[1:18:29] i'm going i'm going to go on and preach
[1:18:31] now so
[1:18:32] uh job came down to that very same place
[1:18:36] identifying himself with his sacrifice
[1:18:38] because he knew
[1:18:40] he was doing what was right in the sight
[1:18:43] of god
[1:18:43] making sacrifices for his children was
[1:18:45] not wrong now you ever see his children
[1:18:47] had died and his body is all broken up
[1:18:50] above
[1:18:50] he comes right on their ash heap and
[1:18:53] take the very same arches
[1:18:56] from his sacrifice and he pull it over
[1:18:59] him
[1:19:00] what a way to identify with your
[1:19:03] sacrifice
[1:19:06] oh glory be to god amen
[1:19:10] hallelujah yes sir
[1:19:14] amen and and and and and
[1:19:17] he fractured means a place of
[1:19:19] fruitfulness
[1:19:21] amen a place of arches
[1:19:25] is fruitfulness isaiah chapter 61 verse
[1:19:30] 3
[1:19:30] god promised that he would give beauty
[1:19:32] for arches
[1:19:35] praise the lord so in the midst of
[1:19:38] arches in the midst of chaos
[1:19:40] god is able to bring out something
[1:19:42] beautiful
[1:19:45] amen praise the lord
[1:19:49] in the midst of your arches he's able to
[1:19:52] bring
[1:19:52] something beautiful one of these days
[1:19:55] when this mortal body is gone
[1:19:57] and they have turned to dust god is
[1:19:59] going to bring an incorruptible body
[1:20:02] out of the dust
[1:20:06] amen he gave beauty for our chase
[1:20:10] but let's travel on there because we are
[1:20:12] running out of time amen
[1:20:13] time is not our friend but we see this
[1:20:16] this
[1:20:16] this becomes very important this becomes
[1:20:20] very prophetic
[1:20:24] it becomes very prophetic
[1:20:29] it becomes a place of the resurrection
[1:20:34] oh my goodness amen
[1:20:39] in front of the heap of arches a place
[1:20:42] of fruitfulness
[1:20:45] praise the lord amen
[1:20:53] and richer the name rachel means
[1:20:56] you a female sheep
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:04] so you just think about it now we are
[1:21:06] building something here
[1:21:13] a female sheep that is a type of the
[1:21:17] church
[1:21:18] because the church is a female
[1:21:21] praise the lord amen
[1:21:25] she's leaving the house of god
[1:21:29] and coming to this place remember jesus
[1:21:32] said until the sea
[1:21:33] goes to the ground and die right amen
[1:21:37] amen until the sea goes to the ground
[1:21:40] and died and became and become
[1:21:42] arches it cannot bring forth again
[1:21:47] praise the lord amen so the church left
[1:21:50] his glory
[1:21:51] at pentecost and it went down to the
[1:21:53] field of arches
[1:21:55] under the roman persecution
[1:22:00] praise the lord amen amen
[1:22:04] the roman power that fought of iron and
[1:22:08] clay got upon the church
[1:22:10] and starts to ground the church to
[1:22:12] arches
[1:22:13] burn them out of stake and crucify them
[1:22:16] but god was going to bring a beautiful
[1:22:18] thing out of there
[1:22:21] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:22:25] amen amen amen
[1:22:28] oh my my mind
[1:22:31] praise the lord you know i enjoy
[1:22:34] preaching to myself because i can preach
[1:22:35] whatever i want to preach
[1:22:38] amen i don't have to be careful of what
[1:22:41] you think about it
[1:22:44] glory be to god amen
[1:22:48] now so retro means a a female sheep
[1:22:52] yo and uh and uh and and right here
[1:22:55] we see here that uh uh uh the scripture
[1:23:00] uh the fraternal and richard in travel
[1:23:04] now you you look at that also
[1:23:07] yeah we we will get to that yeah
[1:23:13] amen then the bible says and it came to
[1:23:16] pass
[1:23:18] when she was in high level the middle
[1:23:21] wife said unto her fear net
[1:23:24] thou shall have this son praise the lord
[1:23:28] amen the male wife could see that her
[1:23:31] body was becoming weak but the child
[1:23:34] was ready to come out
[1:23:37] praise the lord amen amen
[1:23:42] and it came to pass
[1:23:46] now brother branham taught us
[1:23:49] that the the patriots
[1:23:53] the hebrew mother when they were giving
[1:23:56] birth
[1:23:57] amen so this is a perfect sign
[1:24:03] when they were giving birth
[1:24:06] they they slam they make an expression
[1:24:10] she cried out all the child of my sorrow
[1:24:18] she called him benjamin
[1:24:22] the child of my sorrow
[1:24:25] son of my sorrow that what it means
[1:24:30] praise the lord isaiah 53 verse 3 the
[1:24:34] bible says jesus will be the man of
[1:24:35] sorrow
[1:24:37] amen so you can see
[1:24:40] why when jesus was bombed this prophecy
[1:24:43] was repeated
[1:24:44] richer weeping for her children
[1:24:48] and every child of god you are born
[1:24:50] under this promise
[1:24:52] that's the reason why you have sorrow in
[1:24:54] your days you have
[1:24:55] sorrow in your life because sorrow
[1:24:58] is the secret place where god
[1:25:02] brings your changes where he changes
[1:25:05] your arches to beauty
[1:25:06] is in your sorrow
[1:25:13] she cried out the son of my sorrow
[1:25:17] and the bible says that was her last
[1:25:19] breath
[1:25:24] lord be to god amen saint john chapter
[1:25:27] 16 the bible says
[1:25:28] a woman when she's in travail
[1:25:31] have sorrow
[1:25:37] the church goes through sorrow
[1:25:42] people said nothing happened in the
[1:25:43] seaside they had they say everything
[1:25:45] whatever they want to say about the
[1:25:47] church
[1:25:48] thinking that is on the ability of a man
[1:25:52] for something to happen in the church
[1:25:54] no god did not put his promises on the
[1:25:57] ability of a man
[1:25:59] god is more than ever to do what he want
[1:26:02] to do
[1:26:03] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:26:06] when those jews went through
[1:26:08] the gas chamber almighty god was sitting
[1:26:11] on his throne
[1:26:12] because he knew he had everything
[1:26:15] in control he knew that it would take
[1:26:18] the arches of those jews that was burned
[1:26:20] in the gas chamber
[1:26:21] to bring a glorious build uh uh
[1:26:24] israel a beautiful israel
[1:26:28] and return his people back to his word
[1:26:34] amen
[1:26:42] praise the lord amen we're just laying
[1:26:44] some foundations down here
[1:26:50] is climbing her birth pain
[1:26:53] all the sun of my sorrow
[1:26:58] and the bible says that was her last
[1:27:00] breath
[1:27:02] her soul left away from her body
[1:27:09] and when they called jacob
[1:27:13] he wept he wept
[1:27:18] and he picked up the little baby and
[1:27:21] said you are the son
[1:27:22] of my right hand from the son of sorrow
[1:27:27] to the son of the right hand
[1:27:33] glory be to god amen oh
[1:27:37] my god are you sure you're ready for me
[1:27:39] to preach
[1:27:40] amen amen
[1:27:47] that's the joining of the church that's
[1:27:50] the joining of every child of god
[1:27:53] it's from the son of sorrow to the son
[1:27:55] of the right hand you can never get to
[1:27:57] the right hand
[1:27:58] until you go through the house of credit
[1:28:02] praise the lord amen
[1:28:06] the children i come to the birth and
[1:28:08] there is no strength
[1:28:10] glory be to god amen amen
[1:28:13] many men see a lot of prophecies it's
[1:28:16] just
[1:28:17] it's just tied right into days amen
[1:28:20] i'm just trying to skip like a lamb here
[1:28:22] amen and just and just get to the
[1:28:25] get to the point here but they are just
[1:28:26] they are just a lot of things that i
[1:28:28] just tie
[1:28:29] right into this amen amen praise the
[1:28:32] lord
[1:28:32] amen hallelujah amen amen
[1:28:36] and and that's that's the way god is you
[1:28:39] know
[1:28:39] he gave us bit in pieces
[1:28:43] of his internal thoughts because his
[1:28:45] thoughts is internal
[1:28:46] that's right amen you know he he just
[1:28:49] slide him
[1:28:50] in on the types in shadow
[1:28:53] praise the lord amen and i was studying
[1:28:56] and
[1:28:57] i i saw this uh you know uh uh if right
