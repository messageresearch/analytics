[6:41] I would deem uh to be a greater

[6:45] stand in the in the pull pit to break
[6:48] the bread of life to waiting hungry
[6:51] thirsting people and this is a great
[6:53] privilege first I'd like to ask if if
[6:57] any of the right family is your have or
[6:59] Arville or any hadie is Arville with you
[7:03] Haddie um ask him if You' come to the
[7:05] house immediately what I told him you
[7:07] know uh drop by the house if we can I
[7:10] forgot to bring it down with me this
[7:11] morning something for the little doggy
[7:14] they got down there so I'm uh just if
[7:16] you will just drive right by the house
[7:17] as you leave out for for your Ser uh
[7:20] after service and now Edith uh haddy's
[7:25] sister that we know is a little girl
[7:28] that's been been crippled up since she
[7:31] was a baby and she's a woman now and
[7:34] she's in very bad shape now uh about a
[7:39] year ago I went down there when she had
[7:41] her first spell and immediately I found
[7:44] what her trouble was by the help and
[7:45] grace of God now really what's the
[7:48] trouble with a child she's setting her
[7:50] limbs hip together and she can't even
[7:52] move them apart it's because of the
[7:54] tremendous pressure on um the the nerve
[7:58] system but what it is there's nothing
[8:01] physically wrong with the child outside
[8:03] the Affliction of infantile Paralis when
[8:05] she was about 6 months old she screamed
[8:07] and cried all over her life nearly till
[8:09] we prayed for her many years ago and and
[8:13] she's been happy ever since until about
[8:15] a year ago and now it's really menopause
[8:20] in other words the changing of her life
[8:23] and her nerves are in such a tremendous
[8:25] condition and the little lady has got on
[8:28] her mind that she's dying she she's just
[8:31] not going to live just from one hour to
[8:33] the other and you know healthy strong
[8:36] women have terrible times sometime I
[8:38] have to take shots of Harmon and and go
[8:41] into the institutions and take shock
[8:43] treatments and everything during that
[8:45] time the human being has two changes of
[8:47] Life they have the change from a boy to
[8:51] a man from a woman from a girl to a
[8:54] woman about 16 17 years old they get
[8:56] like a bunch of just fly benites and and
[9:00] uh if you can just suffer with him
[9:01] during that age I got a daughter in that
[9:03] age right now Rebecca pray for her and
[9:06] uh Billy all every one of us we come
[9:09] through that little frantic age and uh
[9:12] and so we must suffer with them
[9:14] realizing it's something that that they
[9:17] they have to go through now Edith that
[9:19] this changing of of the of the seven
[9:22] years every seven years your life
[9:23] changes so the seven time seven you see
[9:26] it and it's makes it kind of hard that's
[9:28] a complete change and it it bothers the
[9:31] women man usually get U Kind of a Funny
[9:36] carrying on doing that time and
[9:38] sometimes leave their wives but women
[9:40] are are unfertile after that and we all
[9:43] go through that we must remember that
[9:45] it's things that we must bear with one
[9:47] another and understand those things and
[9:49] little Edith has gotten this condition
[9:51] and she's lost much weight and she looks
[9:54] bad and and I tell you uh some night not
[9:57] all of you together but just a little
[9:59] trip now they set up with her day and
[10:00] night and a little trip down there from
[10:03] this Tabernacle and and the different
[10:04] Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here

[10:08] right family I'm sure they'd appreciate
[10:10] it just go down sit with them a little
[10:12] while talk to them shake their hand and
[10:14] if no more than a little friendly visit
[10:16] we we forget that's so easy you know and
[10:19] when it comes to our own home then we
[10:20] appreciate it and we must remember
[10:22] others appreciate it too and uh the
[10:24] right family I'm sure would appreciate
[10:26] that I I know you would have done it if
[10:28] you know this condition existed but you
[10:30] didn't know it so there therefore uh I
[10:33] was telling you this morning for go and

[12:53] to and uh we're glad to have brother and
[12:55] sister veil in this morning and maybe
[12:58] there's many more here we don't
[13:00] understand I see a sister here I believe
[13:01] from Chicago I can't I know the group
[13:04] here but I just can't call their names
[13:06] exactly so we we appreciate from
[13:08] everywhere wherever you are I see the
[13:10] Brethren here two young fellow is to be
[13:13] ordained young in the ministry at least
[13:16] this morning to uh our colored Brethren
[13:18] from up in New York has just received
[13:20] their credentials through the
[13:21] Philadelphia church and uh give in this
[13:24] church as where they come from and we're
[13:27] going to lay hands upon them that God
[13:29] will bless her Ministry in New York we
[13:32] got two or three little churches up
[13:33] there I believe brother Delino has a one
[13:37] of the little groups there and we are we
[13:39] appreciate them and and here's two more
[13:41] going out now to make uh have services
[13:43] for the people there and we're we
[13:45] appreciate these things the Lord bless
[13:46] you richly so many I look around see
[13:49] different ones that you just can't call
[13:50] all their names but I know that he
[13:53] understands now I believe if our sister
[13:57] The Pianist or one of them that come
[13:59] here and play for us when the coal of
[14:01] fire had touched the prophet making him
[14:04] as pure as pure can be when the word of
[14:08] voice of God said who will go for us
[14:10] then he answered here am I send me when
[14:13] we ordain these ministers by laying on
[14:16] of hands now we realize that the
[14:18] scriptural way of ordaining a minister
[14:21] is laying on of hands I think that's
[14:24] where our line Brethren are the
[14:27] Battleford people and so forth got mixed
[14:31] up and when they seen that laying on of
[14:33] hands to impart spiritual
[14:36] gifts now we do not believe that gifts
[14:39] comes by laying on of hands we believe
[14:42] that a laying on of hands is a sanction
[14:44] to what we've already seen it's a
[14:48] amen now when they lay hands upon
[14:51] Timothy and upon those Brethren they had
[14:54] noticed in them man was the gift
[14:56] remember stir up that gift which was in
[14:58] you come from your grand grandmother
[14:59] Lois and they seen this in Timothy and
[15:03] therefore the elders laid hands upon him
[15:06] ordaining him not put hands upon a man
[15:09] that nothing has ever been showed forth
[15:10] you see and they just ask the blessings
[15:13] and we all believe that so we don't
[15:15] impart spiritual gifts we only recognize
[15:19] them and lay hands upon them to sanction
[15:21] them that we believe that God has done
[15:24] such things for the people uh notice
[15:27] this morning way back in the back
[15:29] brother mckenny uh from I believe it's
[15:31] Kenny or mckenny the Methodist Minister
[15:33] sitting back there it's just recently
[15:35] been ordained here too I believe that
[15:38] was right from the platform fora whole
[15:40] forth up in Ohio with brother da and
[15:43] sister da and the group from up and all
[15:45] how oh when we all gather together these
[15:48] little places coming together it's
[15:50] wonderful no denomination no ties of
[15:53] nothing but only Jesus Christ that's all
[15:55] just sting together in Heavenly places
[15:58] all right sister if you give us let's
[16:00] just sing this one verse of that when
[16:02] the coal of fire had touched the prophet
[16:04] let's sing it together
[16:06] now when the coal of fire had touched
[16:10] the
[16:12] prophet making him as pure as pure could
[16:18] be when the voice of God said who go for
[16:24] us then he answered
[16:29] I send
[16:31] me speak my

[23:19] much of these good things we just have
[23:20] to take a little here and a little there
[23:23] in order to get it all in the service
[23:26] this morning now
[23:29] today we are I'm speaking upon a subject
[23:33] that I I sometimes don't like to
[23:37] approach these real
[23:40] terrific uh times now last Sunday if
[23:44] some of you wasn't here and and didn't
[23:46] get the message of the Third
[23:49] Exodus and if you like the tapes I
[23:52] believe you'll enjoy that one the Third
[23:55] Exodus uh what we got a sick boy here or
[23:58] something
[24:00] oh a little boy God bless him
[24:04] next all right just the end the service
[24:06] we go pray for the sick anyhow you see
[24:08] so we now
[24:11] uh we are we ask you maybe if you can to
[24:14] get the message on the Third Exodus the
[24:18] third time that the uh light the angel
[24:23] of the Lord that has called the people
[24:25] to an exodus has visibly showed itself
[24:29] on Earth in an
[24:31] exodus I think that's real outstanding
[24:35] to me the Third
[24:38] Exodus would you care if I took off my
[24:48] coat they um it's awfully warm in the
[24:52] Tabernacle this morning and the only air
[24:55] conditioner we have is is what you can
[24:57] fan you have to generate your own power
[25:00] so we are planning on someday putting a
[25:03] cool system in here as soon as we can
[25:04] get things fixed now we would appreciate
[25:09] if you uh if you like to hear the
[25:10] message the Third Exodus now we've had
[25:13] many Exodus but we can definitely put
[25:18] our hand on the place time of three
[25:22] Exodus that God in the form of a pillar
[25:25] of fire has come down to call all and
[25:29] separate people amen now not it's
[25:32] separating of people and we find out
[25:36] that when he called his first Exodus he
[25:39] went before them in a pillar of fire and
[25:41] led them to Leading them to a land where
[25:44] later he appeared before them in a form
[25:48] of a man called Jesus Christ he come
[25:51] from God and went to God and the that he
[25:54] was rejected and he come then to call a
[25:57] people out out of a out of a
[26:00] formal condition if they got into like
[26:03] they had down in Egypt to give away to
[26:05] sin and to the the ways of the Egyptians
[26:09] and God called them out and now we find
[26:12] the second time they give away under
[26:16] captivity to a Roman Empire and they got
[26:19] off in the Creeds and got away from the
[26:22] real sincerity of the worshiping God
[26:26] again sent another Exodus
[26:29] uh the he appeared in the form of a man
[26:33] that led man in the first Exodus he was
[26:36] a pillar of fire then when he came on
[26:40] Earth in the land to where he led them
[26:43] what a beautiful type it'll be in the
[26:45] Millennium where he's leading the church
[26:47] now we shall see him as he is we'll have
[26:53] a body like his own glorious body and
[26:55] today by the Light of the gospel
[26:59] reflecting from a light a pillar a far
[27:03] visibly Among
[27:05] Us science has seen it it's in the
[27:08] magazines and across the world and it's
[27:13] both scientifically and spiritually
[27:17] recognized as the same Pillar of Fire by
[27:20] the same signs and same things that did
[27:22] always amen and now in the midst of days
[27:26] when there's a lot of fanaticism and
[27:28] things yet God always identifies
[27:33] himself now we find this and what a
[27:35] glorious thing it is to know that this
[27:38] Earthly Tabernacle someday this old
[27:41] frail body that we're sick and Afflicted
[27:44] in will be changed and made like un his
[27:46] own glorious body then we shall see him
[27:49] as he is and be with him in the land
[27:51] that we're Bound for today oh almost
[27:55] make us feel like standing and singing
[27:56] I'm Bound for the promise
[27:58] land they probably be singing at the
[28:01] baptismal service anyhow cuz that's our
[28:03] baptismal song now
[28:19] [Music]
