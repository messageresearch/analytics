TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so so so [Music] do [Music] so so [Music] [Music] gee [Music] now [Music] is is oh is [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] yes oh [Music] my god [Music] maybe [Music] is is [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] is [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] over the [Music] world um [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] let's sing that last verse again too is and he will [Music] yes [Music] i must tell jesus [Music] jesus jesus can't have me [Music] i want to read a quote here from brother branham just before we go into prayer from the message he cares do you hear [Music] and just singing this verse just just kind of writing that quote on my mind or how the word evil you know is pressing upon us but brother branham said this and he said we found out that many people try to find comfort by drinking now don't look at drinking just look at many people try to find comfort because some find it by drinking and some find comfort by different things he says you know we have a saying which is pretty well known among us today that many ministers drink sometimes before they come to the pulpit they take a heavy drink of intoxication it's been known to see ministers on the platform that even struggle under the influence of aquifer that ought not to be so it should not be it's because many times we might condemn the man now listen to this now many times we might condemn the man or condemn the person when maybe we ought not to do that that's right we ought to find back what's the trouble what is making the person to find comfort in whatever they are finding comfort in yes praise the lord now listening that brother branham continued he said [Music] he said we ought to find back what's the trouble he said many of them was converted from alcohol and we find out if they if they are in that condition it's a disgrace and a reproach now so brother branham is condemning it if the person is doing that it's a disgrace and it's a reproach but yet the problem is that god brought the person out of it sometimes uh it is uh uh things that wrongs in the family of the person praise the lord even though the law brought them out of it but you have to know that the uh uh they are the uh their flesh they are formally strained sometimes pulled on them sometimes detects to them now so let's let's read down a little bit he says it's a disgrace and a reproach but no more a reproach than it would be to lie or to steal to lust after woman women or any other things that's in the commandment anything that is against the word [Music] and maybe a man born high passion he's talking about lustful desire and he sees these modern striptease on the street and he's constantly in trouble he says the man is born that way that's the condition of his natural birth praise the lord now when when he ought to do the minister that drinks or the man or the woman that smokes or dressed immoral trying to draw her comfort from being so well put together that she wants to cause uh a man to look at her now so brother branham goes on and and he goes on as he talks to but if you just stay right in that place of where our comfort is where where our [Music] comfort and you and we know that the holy ghost is promised jesus said he will be our comforter [Music] because uh god will not promise us another comforter only because he knows that in the sinful nature that we are born on earth there are many strains in our family that will bring us comfort that will bring us comfort [Music] listened to brother branham saying this and i was i was just i was just uh listening to something the other day molding the lawn and working at in the back of the house and and and i start to realize that uh right from our womb from from the warm when the child is conceived in the warm we stops to adopt different comfort right from the womb [Music] we start to adopt different comfort science proof that when a child is in a womb and and [Music] the mother or the parents is always playing godly music the child will get comfort from that and they are certain things that uh if the child is born in the home where there are us always fascists and strive and all of that it will the child were born uh with a lot of discomfort and and different things so i started to think on this and just before we prayed tonight just before we prayed tonight [Music] and i would just want us to take it too hard and take it as as a prayer burden as we approach the law tonight that we can we can search our own heart and just look down our life there are different things that have brought us comfort you know uh and as brother branham is saying this he says you know sometimes we we we get too fast to judge the person or too fast to condemn ourself it's just for us to realize that all of these all of these different things that that you know that detects uh to us in bringing comfort and drive us in the play in in uh you know in in the different strains of life that we are drawn in you notice is is all of those things that comes from our first birth yeah all of those things that comes from our natural birth but with god promising us himself he's promising us himself as our comforter meaning that we can get a superseding comfort in him in spending time with his word and spending time in prayer and uh and just identifying that he can bring us enough comfort than anything that that we can get comfort from whatever this flesh would give to us as a comfort would just be a pacifier it would never satisfy it would come for us for a while and we would get out of it and we would go back to it again it would never satisfy but when he the comforter comes if we can identify him as the comforter as the comfort they are satisfied when we are trouble when we are restless when we are burdened we will run to him because he is the only one that can satisfy praise the lord so as we just buy our house tonight and go to the lord in prayer i want us to approach him tonight and as we identify in our heart as our comforter as the only one that can satisfy [Music] and that's why we come to him tonight no matter what we're struggling with in our mind no matter what the enemy is trying to detect to us and he brings those things to weaken us to condemn us but you have to remember that jesus said i will give you another comforter i will give you another comforter and we can get comfort he's a loving god that cares for us he don't want us to be restless he don't want us to be troubled he don't want us to be discomfort he want us to come to the house of god and realize that we can get comfort in his presence we can come we can bring our hearts we can bring our burden to him so whatever it is tonight i just want us to just go to the lord in prayer maybe it's a habit maybe it's it's a family strain maybe whatever it is that we fake comforting most especially most especially the ones sometimes there seems to be a sense of comfort but yet it brings a lot of condemnation to our hearts let's take it to the great comforter tonight i believe the lord can replace it i believe he can give us a satisfying potion i believe he can give us himself that we can get strength let's speak to him tonight heavenly father dear lord we know god father lord just like we signed that verse of the son lord god how this word evil elude us lord the father it brings up god what looks to be comfort whether lord jesus whatever it is of god and yet your prophet identifying lord father preachers that were struggling on the alcohol and people that struggle on the smoking and people that struggle even with the way they're dressed and oh god god and father different things lord as long as we are in this life of god there is there are things that we do that bring us comfort lord father but you are our satisfying portion you are the one lord god that comfort above our father

chapter 9 let's read from verse 5. for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise praise the lord that's the reason why we have bad to cry because if you know your battle cry you will not be confused amen bottle of a warrior is with confused noise and garment rolled in blood praise the lord amen if you are afraid of blood you just go back gideon say go back go back because this is not children's plan amen but this shall not but this shall be with burning and fuse of fire so this is going to be a complete different battle amen the burning year is going to be the holy ghost that will do the burning in this battle for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder this blessed my heart that this particular verse unto us a child is born and his son is giving they bless my heart because that was brother branham christmas message that he was returning to preach when he went to be with the lord so it's always special to me and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this heavenly father we want to ask your blessings tonight and we just pray that lord god you will you will bless this little portion of the word thank you father god that lord you we can find comfort you are the truth comfort you are the comforter lord father and lord we are learning from your word and your ways their father you have a different way that you comfort us and then the way we think comfort is yes and and so lord we pray but random says the ego stirred his neck he will the mama eagle is going to scatter the net because he she want to create a different comfort for the eagles that they will not trust in the net they will trust in their wings and sometimes so god you shake our nets because you want us to trust in our wings you want to straw you want us to trust in the god-given abilities that you have given to us father we love you what a faithful god you are what a blessed savior we appreciate you father bless the service tonight thank you for the wonderful presence that is in this place of god that your people bring with them or father the hearts of god that come to praise that come to pray to god father and is seeking you day and night bless us now in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord thank god i remind myself i sent a note back there to be reminded and it looks like the holy spirit want me to be reminded because i thought i would be reminded on sunday and not forgotten and so i just i said well let me just send an email to the church please remind me amen last wednesday i was speaking i was speaking on something and i think i got my picture mixed up so i thought that i should correct that in the books because as chapter 16 before we get to what we want to speak tonight let's let's just turn to acts chapter 16 let me just correct that and uh and then we will get into what we want to talk tonight uh brother stephen ajard is flying from virginia he will be here tonight so i'll leave from service to pick him up from the from the airport uh he will uh he will be visiting with us uh we we we had a need to go down in and uh and help a family did in missouri so he's a trusted friend so i'm going to send him to help me do that one praise the lord and then tomorrow brother valentine will be flying in also in the evening and he will stay and be with us on the weekend brothers brother jarrod will be back next week and then we will give him opportunity to testify to us praise the lord amen now as chapter 16 then came he to their body and lestrade and behold a setting disciple was there named timmeters the son of a certain woman which was uh jewish and and believed but his father was greek so timothy was a gentile timity was a gentile which was well reported of the brethren or were reported of by the brethrens that were at least tried in a coldness him who paul have to go forth with him and and talk and circumcise him because of the jews now in last wednesday i said titles i kind of misplaced that i said titus so that's that's what i wanted to correct tonight it was timidity not titus so paul uh poor half uh uh for some reason right after the service that i mean the lord just picked me on it i was driving home as i was thinking i said i didn't get this thing right so i kind of for such a before i went to bed or as i would have a bad dream i want to make sure that i sleep well when god is getting after you you better make sure you do what he wants you to do as you get a bad dream let me warn you now i'm telling you personal experience so him will paul have to go forth with him and talk and uh and took him and circumcised him because of of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek why would paul do that and paul will be the same one that will be blasting that the jews now to force the gentile to be circumcised but why would paul do that because timothy will become a pastor of a jewish church trinity will become the pastor of a jewish church there are things that uh we learned that god's ways are past falling out you can put god don't trust your brain to understand god don't trust your brain to understand god you got to trust your heart so so that was what i got wrong and that's why i wanted to make sure that i got to get that clad on the box praise the lord and now there are some other few things i could say about that but i'm already into the time almost 8 30 years so i have in 30 minutes to preach to you tonight and uh and unless you want me to preach longer then you can lead me till 10 o'clock praise the lord but something caught my attention today i was uh i was just thanking the lord for something in and praying and uh and the holy spirit brought something to my mind i preached this message long time ago a long time ago i remember that uh one time i preached on the refugee camp in ghana but uh uh i want to speak tonight on the zoo of the lord of hosts we perform this the zeus of the lord of hosts will perform this now so we see here we we know that uh uh this whole thing uh is from god asking the king to ask for a sign on a which he said a virgin shall conceive so in connection with isaiah chapter 7 in expansion of that prophecy we see here that the coming of the messiah the coming of the christ child the coming of god in flesh i want you to get the picture before i get into all of my drama this is god promising his desire when he said to the serpent the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent god watch over their promise and he was you know he was working all through the ages but here he said that it's coming into plainview now the picture that i want you to get here god becoming flesh god becoming flesh the promise that the virgin shall conceive and unto us a child is born unto us a son is giving that promise that is going to come to mankind is going to be brought to us by only one means yes the zeal of the lord will perform this it's going to be god's zeal that will bring it to pass god will be so zealous he will be so serious that he would get a hold of a man joseph and prepare him with all his life experience to be able to watch over a young woman the zeal of the lord will perform this and if god if the word make flesh if the word made flesh or the word becoming flesh the first time the zeal of the law performed it would take the zeal of the lord to bring the word in your flesh it won't take your works it won't take your religious exercise the zeal of the lord will have to perform this if god said i will have a bride that would be a rapture it would take the view of the lord to do it amen praise the lord so we have to we have to be we have to be careful we have to examine our zeal i want to talk a little bit about zeal tonight because we're living in an age where [Music] it's a zealous age there are a lot of people rioting and a lot of things going on when we look in the in the laodicea church age we found that we find that same word promised to this age verse 19 of chapter three as many as i love god's love to this age i rebuke and trusting be zealious therefore and repent praise the lord be zealious therefore i believe that the zeal of the lord is also expressed to our age because this is the age because the the beginning of this age we know that the introduction when christ introduced himself to this age he introduced himself as the beginning of the creation of god so there is another creation another creation that is going to be formed in this age and it will take the zeal of the law to bring it to pass just like the creation of almighty god in the womb of mary it took the zeal of the lord to perform it praise the lord are we together brother branham said this when he he dealt with that in the church age uh revelation 3 19 i'm reading from the exposition of the church asia as many as i love i rebuke and trust him resilience therefore and repaint he says be zealious and repent now this false church has zeal make no mistake about her no make no mistake about that joseo has literally been that of the jews saint john 2 17. if you can just try to copy your mind what it was let's go to st john 2 17 and read that i was praying in there and you know i was i was just placing some things in the hands of the lord and and to me it just felt like the lord answered me back and said the zeal of the lord would perform it so he blessed my heart and i was meditating upon it and then i went back and started looking at some things so we see here that brother bran mentioned here the disciples in john chapter 2 and his disciples remember that it is written the zeal of the house has eaten me up you know what the story is jesus enter into the the temple whipping the people out of the temple and and and the bible says right there the holy ghost brought that scripture to the minds of the disciple they are looking at the act jesus whipping these people out and the holy ghost brought what david said in the psalm that this day this scripture is fulfilled amen that's right praise the lord amen now so so brother branham says here not that you have to realize that the false church has zeal make no mistake about her ozil has literally been that of the jews and what was he referring to they were very zealous thinking that they are keeping the commandments of the law they have now turned the house of god to the dance of thieves amen being very zealous trying to achieve and raise money for the church and different things that they are trying to do they were doing it in a religious i mean they found lord of reasons to back that up praise the lord so brother branham is now comparing that is he's identifying that kind of action where people will find reason to do certain things very reasonable and they will get the energy behind it they will find all the scriptures in the code to back what they are doing but it's a false zeal the zero of the the zero of the house has eaten me up he says but it is a wrong zeal not the zeal of the house but the zeal of those jews that's what he's referring to because he's comparing their zeal because you have to realize that jesus was the word of the hour amen he was the word he was the promise of the hour now what what is what what is the thing easier for those guys to do is to go right to the word of the hour and say jesus what should we do no they they have their sahendra's counsel they have their their their clegic and they decided they agreed upon it they voted upon it and out of there and he decided to do it so he says but it was a wrong seal it is for the house of their own building not the house of the lord but the house for their own building it is for their own creeds and and dogmas and organization their own righteousness does that sound does that make sound to you their own righteousness paul dealt with that in romans chapter nine he says the jews were zealious in their righteousness they were zealious and they crucified the very word they crucified the very christ in their own zeal paul says oh how my heart believed for my brethren they have zeal but without knowledge amen they have zeal they want to do things for god but without knowledge so he says here for it is their own creed and document and organization their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own idea praise the lord they have put the word out they have laid the word down and and and and they're able to convince this person to convince this person and you know and all of that and and it brings it brings them a strength they are in tools amen they have a passion they have a burden but they have put the word out for their own idea that they disposed the holy ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside internal life as a person and make internal life an idea and make internal life a feeling they have put away internal life as a person praise the lord they have put aside internal life as a person and make it good works or even church conformity rather than good works but god is calling for another zeal amen god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong now you have to see the contracts here because this is laodicea age the age of the people's right and who's going to step back from the spirit of the age and say god i'm wrong i need help who's going to step back from the spirit of the age and say god i'm wrong that's the view of the hour be zealous and repent how will you repent if you don't realize that you are wrong how will you ever repent if you don't identify an area where you need to repent praise the lord so you see the blessings that have come to the bride because it's the zeal of the lord that is bringing us to constant repentance it's because god has predestinated us to be a bride and whatever it takes him to bring us on our knees he's going to do it whether you like it or not he has a different way of making you comfortable join the bathroom ministry comfort you comfort you my people and he come there and blasting other people what can i for comfort is that sure what kind of a comforter i thought this man supposed to be petting the people on their back going to their house and doing their groceries praise the lord oh that's the kind of comforter that we like somebody to do all the work for us but he was a different comforter he said it's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife god has a different way of bringing comfort no matter what comfort we get from this world is just a pacifier it's just a pacifier go through the night the next morning you wake up all your troubles are on the table praise the lord i put on the table five brother you're right it's right beside the bed brother branham said but god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong who is going to say the spirit of this age is to justify yourself in whatever you are doing that's what make the age an age that is defined is the age of people's right who is going to say i'm wrong praise the lord water said that all these denominations are basing on they have their claims of original church they can trace where they came from amen every one of them and how god worked mightily in their day they claim that they are right as long as they can trace their church back to john wesley and they can trace their church back to luther and they can trace their church back to azusa street praise the lord amen and we can trace our church back to jeffersonville and brother branham as long as we can we can keep ourselves in that comfort praise the lord are we together but you see that uh like the prophet said god is calling for a different kind of physio because this is the zeal of the lord is the zeal of the lord that will perform this amen and you just think about it tonight i mean this is a prayer meeting i don't want to make this a revival service just think about it tonight just think about it god is the one that make this promise amen and he's going to see to it he's going to see to it that this child is born now if you if you go back to verse 5 that was the reason why the holy spirit honored the prophet said every battle is with a confused noise he said but this one going to be different sure because the one that is in charge of this battle is not going to fight it in confusion he's determined from the foundation of the word his mind is made up he has a blueprint that is already written he's not going around recruiting who who i can get on my team he have already predestinated man he had predestinated a people for this age praise the lord he says the entire message will meet the end time condition that's what he said so you say you got we you ha we have to understand the zeal of the lord because that's the kind of a zeal that we want to be under we don't want to build our own zeals praise the lord we want to be honored his zeal we want he's the one to be the one leading he said the same thing there in zechariah's it's not going to be by power it's not going to be by mine it's going to be by my spirit the zeal of the law will build this house but i'm saying she's never depending on our human ability when he make his promise he's depending on his strength he's depending on his ability he's only looking for the person that will says i'm willing yeah am i praise the lord amen and pressing i will just surround themself that would just make themselves available that's the way i learned to understand that word yield the members of your body make yourself available praise the lord amen just make yourself available he saw that unavailable duncan he says bring that donkey i would ride on their ass and go down all the other donkeys were busy he said go down there there's a donkey that is available don't lose it bring it praise the lord i wish i could be an available donkey for the lord hallelujah so that's the picture that i want you to to to to keep in your mind tonight and and meditate upon it let the holy spirit digest it in your soul is that if for the coming of christ in flesh in mary the view of the lord performed that how much more of god being made flesh in you the promise of the holy ghost making you an overcomer having his preeminence in your life is now what you the do of the lord will perform that let's let's just look at some few types here i won't keep you long tonight if you look into the word you will realize that uh you love the lord tonight amen in genesis chapter 25 the bible speaks about finney house praise the lord now what you want to realize here is that fene heist was not the messenger the messenger was moses moses was the one that was called to the exit he was the one that was called to lead the people he met the the the burning bush he met the pillar of fire he was the one that had the commission amen and why he brought the message and everything and the people were in the adjoining there was something that happened when the people got down there to buy poor [Music] they started mixing themselves up with the word and we know there was a lot of mismultitude that joined the camp and uh and pretty soon they started you know missing himself there uh with the word in and and here we find that uh uh uh the god to this place and the people says the bible says the people you know the eighth and then the rose up to play that was the way paul distributed they were brought down to this feast and uh we see the children of israel you read the rest of the story there in numbers chapter 25 the churn of israel got down to this feast and and and yeris said they are lingering with with uh the people of the land and they started doing things and i mean they got drunk and they started misbehaving and pretty soon they're no longer paying paying attention to the messenger they want to be free like the rest of the denominations around them why we can do this while we can do this the only reason why we can do this is that brother branham said brother branham say praise the lord because people think that's the way that uh uh i mean they think that's the way we keep you in bondage right for like they say that's the way that you know the message keeps you in bondage because everything brother brandon said brother branham said praise the lord i don't know how we're keeping you bunnies who call you we never went and arrested you from your house you brought yourself now so pretty soon they were not they were not paying attention to moses and like the scripture who tells us there you know well they got so much into this until they started defying themselves breaking the lord of god running around with uh with with the people of the land the more about faith and all of those things that were happening there and here we see it i'm trying to give you a picture of when a man comes under the zeal of the lord completely different than when he creates his own zeal when he's driving by his own zeal and trying to make it the zoo of the lord so yeah the people they're getting in this order and they're doing things and you know and all of that and and uh and then pretty soon they're no longer listening to moses as the prophet is crying now stay in line stay in line he says in the vision they were now looking at the wallet church and they started stepping out of line and he's crying still in line until he came out of the vision stay crying stay in line they are not listening to moses again he's crying stay in line we are on our journey we're not settling down here and right honor the voice of the messenger this hebrew man took a strange girl into the tent right under the voice of the messenger praise the lord and this young man he was not a leader he was not a leader he was none of those men like like like joshua and all of those people that were closer he was not a leader but something came upon his heart his desire was not to take over the exodus his desire was to stop the evil that was happening in the camera praise the lord amen that was his desire his desire was to correct the evil that is in the camp because sooner he realized that if we let this go it will influence every one of us pretty soon my mind my my dad will leave my mom and start running after another woman pretty soon i myself as a young man i will i would not want to to take a a a a a strange woman and the scripture says he took a weapon and that most both the man and the woman right there and when he did that the bible says he held back the wrath of god amen in verse 11 verse 10 and the lord speak unto moses saying infinity phinehas the son of eliza the son of aaron the priests have turned my raft away from the children of israel why he was zealous for my sake he was zealious for my sake he's identified under the zeal of the lord why because he had the courage to rise up and stop something that was rising in the camp he was listening to the prophet voice or listening to the prophet message and realized that the people is doing something wrong completely wrong they have no they having no this no regard to what moses is saying and god says he was serious for my sake praise the lord the ministry of moses after seeing the supernatural and seeing everything that is saw in egypt he was one of those young men that witnessed the terror of pharaoh and the house man being drowned he was one of those young men that witnessed that praise the lord are we going to trash out of those experience are we going to trash all of those experience just because now we think we can be free are no longer in egypt no finney house was not willing praise the lord amen he witnessed saying light and gushing and darkness all over egypt he witnessed the effect of applying the door on the lantern of the door post one of his best friend that was an egyptian boy at first born dying he witnessed all of that praise the lord so he was he he his life was affected by the ministry the message of moses and all he was trying to do all he was trying to do he was just playing his little part i i have to do something in my little corner because i don't believe that was the only evil eye that was happening that day there were a lot of men that were drunk and they were all sleeping all around and living all sorts of life he could not go around everybody he just thought that this one is before me i'm going to deal with it the seat of the lord god says he was zealious for my sake and he even pleased the lord to to to establish a covenant with any house because he allowed the message of moses to influence him he knew that that was not their final destination he knew there was a joint in the head there was a promised land to ghetto praise the lord i'll take another another comparison here and leave you for the night second king chapter 10 it will be this man called jehold you have to remember when the lord met elijah the prophet what does that hear elijah he says uh i alone left god said no having seven thousands that have now bowed down their needs to build he says go you annoyed elijah and you're still annoyed aiza that was a syrian king and annoyed jehu now this is what i want i want also so uh for you to be able to see it because because jehu was just another ordinary boy sure but the anointing of the prophet is going to change his life yes setting honor the prophet message is going to influence him in a different way you see the zeal of the law will not make you to do something contrary to the prophet of god it will not it will not make you a challenger to the prophet of god praise the lord so think that you are zealious and now there is there is a lot of error in the message and you are the one that is called to correct it you are simply saying the messenger failed in his work that's what you are saying praise the lord but you will realize that all of these men that was anointed a lot that god told elijah to annoy the reason was just to finish the work it was not to correct the work of elijah but to finish his work because elijah was the one that prophesied that the dog would like the blood of ahat and it took the anointing of elijah on aheza because he was the captain of the syrians that brought war against israel honor which they have died praise the lord it was elijah that said that the the the doors were laid jesse their blood it will have to take the anointing of elijah on jehu because after he killed the prophet saw bob he saw uh jessica up in the in in in in a historic building and that very same anointing that killed the prophet obama went and smashed her through the window so what what was said it was the anointing of elijah continuing the work praise the lord it's it's because it's the anointing that does the work just like the prophet of god has spoken in the age and he's not yet we're not going to bring him back from the dead because we believe it was the spirit of the law that was upon him and that same spirit says upon the bride today we're not going to wait and wish that he comes back from the grave it's that spirit that is here on the bride on the fire for ministry to make sure that christ have a bride and the spirit that begin the work is able to finish it because it's the zero of the lord that performed his work it's not man intellectual it's not man's strength it's a zeal of the lord praise the lord just like i said you see paul over there i said romans chapter nine actually it's romans chapter 10. verse one burdens my heart desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be safe for i bear them wrecker that they have a zeal of god but not with knowledge praise the lord for they been ignorant of god's righteousness is going about to establish their own righteousness their own righteousness and that's what man has done around this message god's righteousness comes by the word we are watched by the watching of the word it comes by the word after the word has taken hold of your life that's a conviction that's a new birth then the holy ghost starts to produce those things it's now when we bring measuring stick to church and say come and stand here let's see how your shoes is or how how your dress is you we can do all of those things they don't take sin from the heart they don't take the desire and we have to take the watching of the water by the world that brings conviction that's the thing that changed lives now when we bail him out of people's life we are not happy with this then we get inspiration then we go and find find coats to preach and blast being ignorant of the righteousness of god they establish their own righteousness they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the lord for righteousness for everyone that believeth christ in you the hope of glory unless he changed our hearts unless he revealed himself to us unless he changed our heart and reveal himself to us yes we will establish our laws and rules and put ourselves in bondage because pretty soon we'll be condemned by those very things that we established and now we become hypocrites it's only righteousness when we do it but when other people do it no no no no nope we gotta rip it down we gotta tear it apart the god that spoke his word will be for me we perform it our duty is to preach the earnest truth we must preach the whole counsel of god to you praise the lord for moses describe the righteousness of god which is of the lord that a man which does those things shall live by them and no may have been able to but the righteousness wishes of faith speak on these wise saying that in the heart who shall ascend into heaven for that is to bring christ down from above praise the lord or we shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what but what serious if the word is nigh thee even in their mouth what is that what does that mean confess the promises of god confess what god says about you and then your body will obey your confession when you see it in the word take it as your own and confess it the word is an id even in the mouth we only look in the word for what we want for other people we don't see what is for us that's the problem that's the problem bible says jesus have perfect faith because he could identify himself in the word praise the lord why the lord could achieve the promise of this hour in the life of brother branham praise the lord you you just think about it look at this did this scripture is fulfilled better man is preaching a birth pains with a new bible god set the scene god set the scene just to be able to grab his prophet attention after brother brandon preached the message he said i left keep thinking about what happened he said he kept thinking about what happened when he went in the hotel just imagine wherever i came back that evening to the businessman to explain to them what happened this morning he said while i was in the hotel the holy spirit reminded me and said look it's in luke chapter four look and see luke chapter four there is nothing in this message that is out of scripture amen there is nothing in this message that is out of scripture let me tell you the end time message is the fulfillment of scripture that's what the message is it's the fulfillment of scripture peter said we are not following calling devised people we are following fulfilled scripture that's what makes the message sweet when you can see it in the scripture he says the holy spirit reminded him go back he went back look it's in luke chapter four then all the picture starts to come together you say oh my god he said he went back and all through that the voice that was that was sinking in in his head just listening to but uh this day this scripture is fulfilled the first series he said it kept singing in my head this day this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled that's what the message is it's fulfilled scripture is fulfilled scripture but the righteousness of god wishes of faith speak on this wise verse 8 is verse 8 i was so sorry but what's heretic the word is 90 even in the mouth and in the heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if thou shalt confess with their mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in the heart that god has raised him from the dead that shall be saved you see what the church did to this is that they point the people back to calvary that that is the evil thing that they did because when you read this scripture what they do is that they take the people's mind back to cavalry you got to believe jesus of that day they send them back to a historical scene when the word year is the same yesterday today and forever so the church says well you got to believe that they tell you you believe that jesus died you believe he came in jerusalem he went to the cross for you on gogota they create all of the historical sin in your mind right and then you cannot see the present day christ that is raising amen that's why the prophet preached a message is the raising of the son in christ the rose has risen in our day he has raised in our day out of the pages of his word that's what the message is people it's fulfilled scripture that's the thing that brings strength when you can see it in the word when you can see it in the word it's not something that you're hearing on tapes or reading in the message and there is no way you can trace it back to the word you can find it the lord bless you tonight musicians you can come before we pray let's just sing their song now let's stand on our feet the comforter has come comfort has come comfortably is here i don't know
