========================================

[Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture the royal seed of abraham with like faith as abrahams will hold to the word with him for they are predestinated together the last day messenger will appear in god's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for israel is in the homeland any time now he will come according to malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated pointed out in the word revelations 10 7 and god will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did elijah and be ready for the mount zion showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called god's truth by deceivers but this prophet will come and as the forerunner to the first coming cried behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out behold the lamb of god coming in glory he will do this for even as john was the messenger of truth to the elect so is this one the last messenger to the elect and word born bride christ eulogizes the church revelation 2 13 i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth i know thy works these are the identical words uttered to each of the seven messengers relative to the people of god in each age as they are spoken to the two vines true and false they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but they ought to strike terror in the hearts of the other for though we are saved by grace apart from works true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please god first john 3 7 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is james three eleven dot the fountain sent forth at the same place sweet water and bitter romans 6 2 how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein matthew 12 33-35 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things now if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever first peter 1 23 he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed of life that is in him his works therefore will be scriptural oh what an indictment this truth is going to be against the pergamian age there stands that matchless one and in his hand the sharp sword with the two edges the word of god and that word will judge us in the last day in fact the word is judging even now for it is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it cuts asunder the carnal from the spiritual it makes us living epistles read and known of all men to the glory of god i know thy works if a man fears that he might not please god then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of god in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of truth was the criterium then it is the criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another plum line as the world is going to be judged by one christ jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as james suggested look into the mirror of god's word i know thy works as he stood there with the word examining their lives and the light of the blueprint he had laid out for them he must have been pleased in a goodly measure for they like the others who had gone on before were enduring the persecution of the unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto the lord difficult though it was at times to serve the lord yet they served him and worshiped him in spirit and in truth but with the false vine it was not so alas they had repudiated the life that is built upon the word and were now going further and further away from the truth their actions bore witness to the depths to which they had sunk thou holdest fast my name to whom can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life they held fast then they were holding fast now but not with fatalistic dread as men who live out barren lives they were holding fast in his strength in the assurance of the spirit that they were one in him theirs was the sure knowledge of sins forgiven and they bore the name of christian in testimony to it they knew and loved that name that was above every name their knees had bowed to that name their tongues had confessed to it whatsoever they did they did it all in the name of the lord jesus they had named that name and departed from evil and having taken their stand they were now prepared to die for that name being assured of a better resurrection take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and of woe it will joy and comfort give you take it then where you go precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven already in the second century those words father son and holy ghost had spelled out trinity to many and the polytheistic idea of three gods had become a doctrine in the false church it would not be long until the name was taken away as indeed it was in this age and in its stead the titles of the one great god would be substituted for the name lord jesus christ while the many apostasized and embraced a trinity and baptized using the titles of godhead the little flock still baptized in the name of jesus christ and so held to the truth with so many dishonoring god turning him into three gods and changing his gracious name to titles one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attend such a great name would still be visited amongst the people indeed those signs were mightily and wonderfully manifested though certainly not in the false vine men like martin were greatly used and god bore them witness both by signs and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost that name was still effectual as it always has been and ever will be where the saints honor him through the word and faith thou hast not denied my faith in acts 3 16 when peter was asked how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his jesus name through faith in his jesus name have made this man former strong yea the faith which is by from him jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is jesus name and jesus faith brought about the miracle peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name he said that jesus name used in the faith which is from jesus performed that great work this faith is what the lord was speaking about in revelation 2 13. it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the believers romans 12 3 according as god hath dealt to every man according to verse 1 the men are brethren the measure of faith ephesians 2 8 by grace are you saved through faith and that faith not of yourself it is a gift of god and it also says in james 2 1 my brethren notice he too is talking to brethren have not the faith of not in our lord jesus christ with respect of persons in this pergamian age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the lord having cast aside the doctrine of election and opened wide the church door and their fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of that faith of our lord jesus christ and not only used that faith in acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of god apart from the measure of the faith of the lord jesus himself as today's church is filled with mental believers who endorse the virgin birth the shed blood going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith i live by the faith of the son of god paul did not say that he lived by faith in the son of god it was the faith of the son of god that had given him life and kept him living in christian victory no they had not denied that salvation was supernatural from start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name and his faith and they were blessed by the lord and accounted worthy of him antipas my faithful martyr there is no other record in the word or in any profane history concerning this brother but surely there need not be it is more than enough that he was for known and known of the lord it is more than enough to see his faithfulness unto the lord recorded in the living word he was a christian he had the name of jesus he had the faith of our lord jesus christ and he was amongst those who lived by it he had responded to the words of james have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons full of the holy ghost and faith as was stephen he respected no one he feared no one and when death was pronounced upon all who would take that name and walk in the faith of jesus christ he took his stand with those who would not turn back yes he died but like abel he obtained a witness from god his name is written in the word and though dead his voice still speaks in the pages of god's divine record another faithful martyr was carried to his rest but satan did not triumph then even as he did not triumph when he killed the prince of peace for as satan was despoiled at the cross even so now will the blood of antipas cry out to hundreds more who will take up their crosses and follow him where satan's seat is the reason that this is part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave soldiers of the cross were overcoming satan right in the midst of his own throne room they were winning the battle through the name and faith of jesus right in the camp of the leaders of darkness what a tremendous commendation like the mighty men of david who invaded the camp of the enemy to bring david thirst quenching water so these giants of faith invaded the realm of satan's earthly stronghold and by preaching and exhorting brought the water of salvation to those who lived under the shadow of death now as much as these words concerning the throne and realm of satan are a part of god's praise for his elect they actually set the stage for the denouncement of the evil that has gained supremacy in the church pergamus satan's throne and dwelling place to many these phrases have been merely pictorial rather than truly historical but they are surely real and history bears that out pergamus was indeed the throne and dwelling place of satan it happened on this wise pergamos was not originally the place where satan as concerning human affairs dwelt babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters it was in the city of babylon that satanic worship had its origin genesis 10 8-10 and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and iraq and akhad and kalna in the land of shiner genesis 11 1-9 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shiner and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth babel is the original name for babylon it means confusion it was literally started by cush the son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son nimrod the mighty hunter nimrod according to the genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of babylon was called the head of gold amongst all world governments that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that scripture identifies it with satan completely in isaiah chapter 14 and in revelation chapter 17 through 18. and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of mythology though the names of the gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on until jesus reveals himself to his brethren he will be worshipped and honored though under a different name from nimrod and in a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adored since the bible does not deal in the histories of other nations in detail it will be necessary to search the ancient profane records to find our answer as to how pergamos became the seat of the satanic religion of babylon the major sources of information will be in records of egyptian and grecian culture the reason for this is that egypt received her science and mathematics from the chaldeans and in turn greece received them from egypt now since the priests were in charge of teaching these sciences and since these sciences were used as a part of religion we already know the key as to how the babylonish religion gained its strength in these two countries it is also true that whenever a nation was able to overcome another nation in due time the religion of the subduer became the religion of the subdued it is well known that the greeks had the very same signs of the zodiac as did the babylonians and it has been found in the ancient egyptian records that the egyptians gave the greeks their knowledge of polytheism thus the mysteries of babylon spread from nation to nation until it appeared in rome in china india and even in both north and south america we find the very same basic worship the ancient histories agree with the bible that this babylonish religion was most certainly not the original religion of earth's early peoples it was the first to drift away from the original faith but it was not itself the original one historians such as wilkinson and mallet have proven conclusively from the ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one god supreme eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving and good and just but as satan will always corrupt whatever he can we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the truth as he has always attempted to receive worship as though he were god and not the servant and creation of god he drew worship away from god to the end that he might draw it unto himself and so be exalted he certainly did accomplish his desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world this is authenticated by god in the book of romans when they knew god they glorified him not as god until they became vain in their imaginations and through darkness of heart accepted a corrupted religion to the extent that they worshiped creatures and not the creator remember satan was a creature of god son of the morning thus we find that where once truth was disseminated amongst men and all hell to that one truth there later came a day when a vast group turned from god and spread a diabolical form of worship around the world history bears it out that those of the tribe of shem that stood with the unchanging truth were in solid opposition to those of ham who turned away from truth to the devil's lie there is no time to engage in a discussion of this it is merely introduced that you may see there were two religions and two only and the evil one became worldwide monotheism turned to polytheism in babylon the devils [Music] you
