[58:12] praise the Lord
[58:14] Psalm 105 Let's uh
[58:29] let's read from verse 12.
[58:38] oh let's read from verse 16.
[58:42] let's read from verse 16.
[58:45] I just want to use this as a
[58:49] uh scripture reading tonight and then we
[58:52] will go right into what we want to talk
[58:54] about tonight
[58:56] amen
[59:04] okay
[59:07] from verse 16 moreover
[59:09] he called for a farming upon the land
[59:14] god called for the farming upon the land
[59:17] of Egypt
[59:19] he break the whole staff of bread
[59:23] he sent a man before them even Joseph
[59:29] who was sold
[59:32] for a seven
[59:34] whose feet they hurt
[59:37] in filters
[59:40] he was lay in iron
[59:43] until the time
[59:46] that his word came the word of the Lord
[59:49] Tried Him
[59:53] the king sin and lose him
[59:56] even the rulers of the people
[59:59] and let him go free
[1:00:03] he made him Lord of his house and ruler
[1:00:07] of all his substance
[1:00:10] let us pray together
[1:00:12] Heavenly Father
[1:00:14] Lord Jesus we pray
[1:00:18] that you would take these few words
[1:00:19] tonight Lord
[1:00:21] take these words of God in
[1:00:24] now break it to our hearts so father
[1:00:27] We Want to Thank You Lord God that we
[1:00:30] can come together and bring you on the
[1:00:33] evening sacrifice
[1:00:35] bless Lord Jesus and even your children
[1:00:38] that are streaming into the service
[1:00:40] tonight keep us all in one Accord father
[1:00:43] Lord and their God and
[1:00:47] put us aside tonight Lord and bring to
[1:00:49] us Lord your internal thoughts in Jesus
[1:00:53] name we pray amen
[1:00:55] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[1:00:57] your seat
[1:00:59] praise the Lord
[1:01:03] man as we read over here
[1:01:06] in uh
[1:01:10] Psalm chapter 105
[1:01:14] uh I taught about this and and stay
[1:01:16] keeping our
[1:01:19] thoughts of praising of love
[1:01:24] but uh
[1:01:27] you read Genesis account
[1:01:29] of Joseph
[1:01:32] being taken to Egypt
[1:01:34] and you read the account also of his
[1:01:40] imprisonment
[1:01:43] sometimes it's hard for us to
[1:01:46] imagine some of the treatment that he
[1:01:49] went through so just thinking about this
[1:01:52] today and I was actually uh
[1:01:58] going over starting over the message
[1:02:00] again for the prisoner and then the
[1:02:04] Herbert Branham saying something and
[1:02:05] then I remember there was somewhere in
[1:02:07] the psalm where the Bible described
[1:02:09] Joseph being in filters of change and
[1:02:14] lying in ions
[1:02:16] praise the Lord
[1:02:19] and I believe that's what David was
[1:02:22] trying to describe here or the samis was
[1:02:24] describing when he said
[1:02:26] uh
[1:02:28] he sent a man before them even Joseph
[1:02:31] who was sold
[1:02:33] for a seven whose feet they hurt in
[1:02:36] filters
[1:02:39] he was laid in Iron until the time that
[1:02:44] his word came the word of the Lord try
[1:02:48] him
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:51] so uh
[1:02:54] looking at that tonight
[1:02:57] and then we would drop back a little bit
[1:02:59] to our top dead of
[1:03:02] Paul the praise in the Broadband shared
[1:03:04] down here he said he was bound he was
[1:03:09] bound by a chains and by felters of love
[1:03:13] to do the will of God
[1:03:16] and and that une he was a prisoner
[1:03:21] he was in the filters of love
[1:03:25] that in the filters of law he was in the
[1:03:31] York with Christ
[1:03:33] he could yoke up with nothing else he
[1:03:36] was yoke up with him
[1:03:38] praise the Lord
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] now so that's that's what actually I was
[1:03:45] thinking about to today and as I was uh
[1:03:53] looking through what we were speaking
[1:03:55] tonight but what I want to do uh this
[1:03:58] evening I want to also go back
[1:04:03] to the book of phalaiman
[1:04:20] we read the the
[1:04:25] we read the first verse on uh
[1:04:34] read the first verse on Sunday morning
[1:04:38] and then we took our speed from there
[1:04:41] and we we start heading on
[1:04:48] but what I wanted us to do is to just to
[1:04:52] see if
[1:04:53] the law will give us Grace to just go
[1:04:56] through this letter that Paul wrote here
[1:05:00] and uh and then uh
[1:05:04] in coming days if the law will allowed
[1:05:06] us to look into the subject we will
[1:05:09] start to appreciate some of the thoughts
[1:05:11] that go along because uh uh brother
[1:05:14] Brandon used the first verse like we did
[1:05:17] and uh and then he drew their subject of
[1:05:21] Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ and uh
[1:05:25] but yet we realize that there's a whole
[1:05:29] lot here that is in this one chapter
[1:05:33] book
[1:05:34] and uh uh a kind of a story of
[1:05:39] redemption that is right in here you
[1:05:42] will see as we look into into the the
[1:05:46] letter year you will realize that uh it
[1:05:50] holds a story of redemption
[1:05:53] and uh
[1:05:54] uh I pray that the Lord will just bless
[1:05:58] us together so back in the book of
[1:06:01] phalaimon let's let's look at uh
[1:06:07] chapter one
[1:06:09] the only chapter it has verse one
[1:06:14] just to be able to get a background
[1:06:16] tonight next week uh
[1:06:19] uh our services starts from Friday night
[1:06:22] and there will be no service on
[1:06:25] Wednesday evening and so we can prepare
[1:06:28] ourselves for the weekend so we pray
[1:06:30] that the Lord will just give us a
[1:06:33] wonderful time in his presence amen
[1:06:36] praise the Lord
[1:06:39] Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:06:42] and to me to our brother
[1:06:45] unto faliman
[1:06:47] our dear beloved and fellow laborer
[1:06:52] praise the Lord
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:55] so just like uh we we read to you on
[1:07:00] Sunday Brad Brown says Paul was not uh
[1:07:05] only using that title or being a
[1:07:08] prisoner because he was in prison but he
[1:07:11] was also he was using that just to be
[1:07:15] able to describe a bigger or a broader
[1:07:20] spiritual condition that he felt uh uh
[1:07:25] you know in in his spirit that he was a
[1:07:30] prisoner
[1:07:31] what she had a prison of Jesus Christ
[1:07:33] not a prisoner of Rome uh not a prisoner
[1:07:37] of what was happening around him but he
[1:07:39] felt like he was a prisoner of Jesus
[1:07:42] Christ amen whatever that he was dealing
[1:07:44] with it was because uh the Lord allotted
[1:07:49] there to him
[1:07:50] praise the Lord
[1:07:53] and uh
[1:07:55] verse 2 to our beloved
[1:08:00] our fellow soldiers and to the church in
[1:08:05] their house
[1:08:07] grace to you and peace from God our
[1:08:11] Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:15] now you will see here that as as uh as
[1:08:20] Paul addressed this you have to know
[1:08:23] when we get into the story the story is
[1:08:27] uh all about phalaman and his uh runaway
[1:08:32] slave
[1:08:35] onesimance but yeah Paul is writing the
[1:08:39] letter not only to phalaman but he's
[1:08:43] also writing the letter to the church
[1:08:47] that was in his house
[1:08:50] praise the Lord
[1:08:51] amen and I think there is a reason why
[1:08:56] the letter that was supposed to be a
[1:08:59] personal letter
[1:09:00] is also now addressed to the church one
[1:09:04] of the reason why is because this
[1:09:07] runaway slave is now returning back as a
[1:09:10] brother
[1:09:12] and he's going to belong to that church
[1:09:18] praise the Lord
[1:09:19] amen so even us as uh Parliament I read
[1:09:25] this letter it was delivered to him he
[1:09:29] will also have to give it to whoever was
[1:09:32] the minister whoever was leading the
[1:09:34] church whether even he was the one that
[1:09:36] was leading the church now he will now
[1:09:38] have to read this letter one of the
[1:09:41] reasons there also was to be able to
[1:09:45] destroy any form of gossip
[1:09:49] praise the Lord now we have to remember
[1:09:51] that Paul himself suffer from a similar
[1:09:55] situation
[1:09:56] he had a repetition of one that
[1:09:59] destroyed the church
[1:10:02] and when he got saved
[1:10:04] it was hard for the Believers to receive
[1:10:07] him
[1:10:09] praise the Lord
[1:10:11] it was hard even even when the Lord
[1:10:14] appeared to ananias and say I'm sending
[1:10:18] one to you ananias nor in the report of
[1:10:21] Paul he he spoke back to the angel of
[1:10:24] the Lord he said Lord you know this man
[1:10:26] destroyed the church
[1:10:28] how can you send him to me
[1:10:31] so Paul realizing the effect when one
[1:10:36] have an evil report
[1:10:41] and he sent among the saints
[1:10:44] praise the Lord
[1:10:46] amen
[1:10:47] so what was supposed to be a personal
[1:10:50] letter
[1:10:52] to Philemon Paul is now addressing it
[1:10:55] toward the Church
[1:11:00] told the church in their house
[1:11:04] praise the Lord
[1:11:06] told the church in their house
[1:11:10] now I emphasize on that as a church in
[1:11:14] their house because you realize that in
[1:11:17] Romans 16 5 the Bible also recorded that
[1:11:21] Paul sent greetings
[1:11:24] to a group of believers
[1:11:26] uh uh and and he and he used the
[1:11:29] likewise greet the church that is in
[1:11:32] their house
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] in the book of First Corinthians Paul
[1:11:38] also used that same word
[1:11:41] the churches of Asia salute you aqualia
[1:11:45] and Priscilla salute you as salute you
[1:11:48] much in the Lord with the church that is
[1:11:52] in their house
[1:11:55] praise the Lord
[1:11:57] and uh
[1:12:05] in in collusion also uh the the fourth
[1:12:08] verse Paul also used the same word when
[1:12:11] he was talking salute the brethrens
[1:12:12] which are in laodicea and the church
[1:12:16] which is in his house
[1:12:19] now I say this just to be able to to
[1:12:23] give us a little picture here because
[1:12:25] that's where the church the the gentai
[1:12:29] church was birth we remember as chapter
[1:12:32] 10 in the house of Colinas amen why
[1:12:36] Peter speak this word the Holy Ghost fed
[1:12:39] upon them so the early church as the
[1:12:41] Believers spread out and then and the
[1:12:44] gospel was was going out we realized
[1:12:47] that this was a common formula of the
[1:12:51] early church the Bible says they were
[1:12:53] going from house to house breaking bread
[1:12:56] praise the Lord amen this our setting of
[1:13:01] church
[1:13:03] was not the original setting of church
[1:13:07] now this will also give us a background
[1:13:11] when you go back to the book of
[1:13:12] Deuteronomy you will realize that Moses
[1:13:16] also instructed the children of Israel
[1:13:18] how the law of the law must be written
[1:13:21] on the adult post and how their their
[1:13:24] children must be taught at home and and
[1:13:27] it also goes back to to let us to
[1:13:31] understand and see the value that God
[1:13:33] puts on the homes of the believer
[1:13:37] praise the Lord amen the value that God
[1:13:41] put on the home of the believer the
[1:13:43] believer if God can give us a Godly home
[1:13:47] we will have a golly church amen if he
[1:13:51] can give us a Praying home we will have
[1:13:53] a Praying church if he can give us a
[1:13:56] home where the word is having its
[1:13:59] influence and preeminence we will have
[1:14:01] that same atmosphere in church praise
[1:14:04] the Lord
[1:14:05] Hallelujah
[1:14:08] and then uh
[1:14:11] uh uh actually this our setting of the
[1:14:15] church if you go back to church history
[1:14:17] after uh uh uh
[1:14:21] um Constantine and and and uh you know
[1:14:25] after he Associated himself with the
[1:14:28] church now you have to realize now
[1:14:30] Constantine was a big guy he was a a big
[1:14:34] God in the Roman army and then after he
[1:14:37] Associated himself with the church
[1:14:40] there was no way that he would go to the
[1:14:44] homes of those poor Believers you got to
[1:14:47] realize that most of the people that was
[1:14:49] making uh uh uh the the the the church
[1:14:53] in the book of us the New Testament
[1:14:55] Church just like this it was in
[1:14:57] different homes praise the Lord they
[1:14:59] were praying in John Mark home when Paul
[1:15:02] was really Peter was released from
[1:15:04] praising so that that is the formula of
[1:15:06] the church so we we realized that when
[1:15:10] Constantine when Rome start taking his
[1:15:13] influence
[1:15:15] over the church that was word now a
[1:15:20] place like this you know where they were
[1:15:22] Now setting out a place for the
[1:15:24] Believers to leave their homes and then
[1:15:26] come over to the church
[1:15:28] that was worth all out of there was
[1:15:31] birth where state was now having its
[1:15:34] influence over the church the state was
[1:15:37] the one that that that that
[1:15:40] employed the state uh appointed who can
[1:15:43] be the bishop over this church who can
[1:15:46] be the pastor over this church and and
[1:15:49] and and when a man was appointed to that
[1:15:51] position then the state pay him
[1:15:55] praise the Lord
[1:15:57] amen and and we see those were some of
[1:16:01] the things that God used the Reformation
[1:16:04] to break the church from
[1:16:07] that was what God started the
[1:16:09] Reformation move to be able to break the
[1:16:12] church from the grip of the state
[1:16:18] praise the Lord
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] so when Martin Luther came out with uh
[1:16:24] the message that Josh shall live by
[1:16:26] faith you know uh every every other
[1:16:29] group saw him as a rebellion I mean he
[1:16:32] was he was he was rebelling against the
[1:16:35] state
[1:16:37] well it was God it was a move of God to
[1:16:41] be able to get his church his redeemed
[1:16:45] people because the church was not the
[1:16:48] building the church is a people that was
[1:16:50] called out
[1:16:52] amen so it was God's move to be able to
[1:16:55] get his redeemed people from the grip of
[1:16:58] the state
[1:16:59] and bring them back under the leadership
[1:17:02] of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord
[1:17:06] because when Jesus says I will build my
[1:17:09] church and the gifts of Hell will not
[1:17:11] Prevail against it he was not talking
[1:17:13] about a building
[1:17:15] praise the lord we know that he was
[1:17:17] talking about a mystical church he was
[1:17:20] talking about and redeemed people coming
[1:17:23] on of the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:27] praise the Lord
[1:17:29] so that's the formula that's God's
[1:17:31] formula Church begins at home
[1:17:36] praise the Lord
[1:17:38] Church begins at home that's God's
[1:17:41] formula
[1:17:47] are we together
[1:17:57] grace to you and peace from God our
[1:18:00] Father
[1:18:01] and the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god
[1:18:05] making mention of being always in my
[1:18:08] prayers amen
[1:18:10] hearing of thy love and faith which thou
[1:18:15] have towards the Lord Jesus and towards
[1:18:19] his sins
[1:18:22] praise the Lord now so you have to think
[1:18:25] about it this way that that phalaiman
[1:18:29] was he was not just a a common person he
[1:18:33] was somebody just like uh uh Colinas in
[1:18:37] a in in the book of Arts those were men
[1:18:40] of authority those were men there was uh
[1:18:44] of a higher class for him to be able to
[1:18:48] have uh uh to be uh uh a slave owner and
[1:18:54] and also to be at this place so these
[1:18:57] were people there were there were a part
[1:19:01] of the ruling government at that time
[1:19:03] but you can also see that the the grace
[1:19:07] of God was not just only for the Common
[1:19:09] People the grace of God also went out
[1:19:13] and got men of high status amen
[1:19:16] like like uh uh uh like Nicodemus you
[1:19:21] think about uh uh uh uh Joseph amateurs
[1:19:25] that give his grave to Jesus those were
[1:19:28] men of high classes
[1:19:31] praise the Lord
[1:19:32] amen so even even men of high classes
[1:19:36] can be reached by the grace of God
[1:19:38] Hallelujah men of high classes can come
[1:19:42] to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:19:44] Hallelujah
[1:19:46] praise the Lord
[1:19:48] so we see here that Paul is is thanking
[1:19:53] him he says we have heard of your love
[1:19:56] we have heard of your faith and uh and
[1:19:59] and and towards the Lord Jesus and the
[1:20:02] love and faith that you have towards all
[1:20:05] the sins of God praise the Lord
[1:20:08] Hallelujah
[1:20:10] that the communication of that faith
[1:20:13] may become effectual but but the
[1:20:18] acknowledging of of every good things
[1:20:22] which is in you in Christ Jesus for we
[1:20:28] have great joy and and consolation in
[1:20:32] thy love because that the vows of all
[1:20:36] the sins are refreshed by Thee the
[1:20:38] bowels of all the sins are refreshed by
[1:20:41] thee brother
[1:20:44] praise the Lord
[1:20:46] Hallelujah now we are coming to a very
[1:20:49] interesting place in this letter
[1:20:53] coming to a very interesting place Paul
[1:20:55] yeah they are commanding parliament of
[1:20:59] his faith and the love and the testimony
[1:21:01] that they have heard you know how he's a
[1:21:05] loving brother and he have opened his
[1:21:08] home for the Saints to gather there and
[1:21:10] you know and and all the things that he
[1:21:13] was doing and being of of a man uh uh of
[1:21:17] the high class he was also helping the
[1:21:20] you know the saints that were in need
[1:21:22] and all of that those were all things
[1:21:24] that were part of the early church
[1:21:26] but there is something that is coming
[1:21:28] here
[1:21:29] I want for us to watch wherefore though
[1:21:32] I might
[1:21:34] be much bold in Christ
[1:21:38] to enjoy the
[1:21:41] that which
[1:21:43] is convenient yet
[1:21:46] for Love's sake I rather
[1:21:49] be SD
[1:21:51] being such
[1:21:54] and one as Paul the age
[1:21:59] and now also
[1:22:01] a prisoner
[1:22:03] of Jesus Christ now Paul used a very
[1:22:07] important expression here that that's
[1:22:09] what I want for us to watch
[1:22:11] as I was reading this I thought that uh
[1:22:14] this this will be very interesting for
[1:22:18] us to just read the one chapter together
[1:22:21] this Wednesday night so I left my notes
[1:22:24] aside and I said we will just go over it
[1:22:27] now Paul is saying here
[1:22:31] I could be born to you
[1:22:34] I could be bold to you and in my
[1:22:37] position
[1:22:38] as
[1:22:41] an apostle to the Gentile in my position
[1:22:44] as the one that led you to Christ
[1:22:46] because he's the one that led uh
[1:22:49] phaloman to Christ in my position
[1:22:52] as your pastor I could be born to you to
[1:22:57] instruct you
[1:22:58] which means to be direct to dictate to
[1:23:01] you what I want you to do but I'm not
[1:23:04] going to do it
[1:23:09] praise the Lord I'm not going to do it
[1:23:14] I'm going to allow you
[1:23:17] to use your faith in Christ and the love
[1:23:21] that you have for God
[1:23:22] to make the best judgment in this matter
[1:23:27] praise the Lord
[1:23:29] I'm not going to impose to you sometimes
[1:23:32] many times sometimes that's what and
[1:23:35] many times that's what the the the the
[1:23:37] the the
[1:23:38] Believers expect from the pastor just be
[1:23:41] direct just tell us what you want us to
[1:23:44] do
[1:23:47] praise the Lord
[1:23:49] but many times if those things are
[1:23:52] allowed
[1:23:55] and pray the song then the people comes
[1:23:58] back and says the man is controlling the
[1:24:00] man is the he said nikolita and he
[1:24:02] control the people and tell them what to
[1:24:05] do no the holy spirit is the one that
[1:24:07] that is the best amen he's the one
[1:24:10] that's supposed to deal with us
[1:24:12] my duty is to be able to preach the word
[1:24:16] to you to instruct you not to detect to
[1:24:19] you
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:22] and so that's what Paul is saying here
[1:24:26] I'm not going to detect to you
[1:24:30] in this matter
[1:24:32] I have the right
[1:24:34] he used some very very smart words here
[1:24:39] praise the Lord
[1:24:43] he says we're fall back in verse 8 again
[1:24:46] though I might
[1:24:48] be much bold in Christ
[1:24:51] to enjoying the
[1:24:53] that which is convenient yet for Love's
[1:24:57] sake I rather be Siege thee
[1:25:01] being as
[1:25:04] and one has Paul the age
[1:25:07] he's talking about
[1:25:09] being being aged being older
[1:25:13] and also a prisoner of Jesus Christi
[1:25:19] for my son
[1:25:22] onesimus
[1:25:24] whom I have begotten in my bounds
[1:25:28] praise the Lord
[1:25:30] Hallelujah
[1:25:35] which in time pass
[1:25:38] was to be unprofitable
[1:25:42] but now profitable to be and to me
[1:25:48] is is very interesting here because
[1:25:51] onesimos means profitable
[1:25:55] that's the meaning of his name
[1:25:58] praise the Lord
[1:26:00] now so Paul is now saying
[1:26:03] I'm going to beseech you
[1:26:06] when it comes to this
[1:26:08] my son
[1:26:12] now realizing that phaliman was a
[1:26:15] convight of Paul definitely now it makes
[1:26:19] both of them brothers
[1:26:22] praise the Lord
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:28] he said in time pass he was unprofitable
[1:26:31] today
[1:26:32] but now he's profitable today and also
[1:26:37] to me whom I have sinned again
[1:26:43] thou therefore receive him
[1:26:46] that is
[1:26:49] my own vows
[1:26:53] praise the Lord
[1:26:55] receive him as you will receive me
[1:27:00] praise the Lord
[1:27:03] that's that's word made flesh
[1:27:06] we can preach it we can talk about it
[1:27:10] but when we must experience it
[1:27:13] amen someone that have hurt you
[1:27:17] praise the Lord
[1:27:18] someone that has been ill to you
[1:27:21] for you to be able to receive him as you
[1:27:24] will want them to as he will as you will
[1:27:27] want to be received
[1:27:31] praise the Lord
[1:27:37] But realize Paul is living it in the
[1:27:41] hands
[1:27:42] of
[1:27:44] Parliament
[1:27:46] why because it's a tricky place it's the
[1:27:49] Rock and the high place
[1:27:57] if he comes back now let me give you a
[1:28:00] background
[1:28:01] in those days if uh if a Slave
[1:28:06] a slave could work for his freedom
[1:28:10] praise the Lord
[1:28:11] he can work and buy his freedom
[1:28:14] and also out of kindness his master who
[1:28:17] set him free but if a slave run away
[1:28:21] he gets
[1:28:23] on the on the record for wanted
[1:28:28] so wherever he is in the Roman Empire he
[1:28:32] could be arrested
[1:28:34] and he could be praising whether it was
[1:28:36] honor that condition that he met Paul we
[1:28:40] don't know
[1:28:42] praise the Lord but you think about it
[1:28:44] now he's returning back
[1:28:47] where there are many other
[1:28:50] uh uh uh uh people that have slave
[1:28:56] now so
[1:29:01] action to him put him in a place where
[1:29:05] If he if he just let him go you know
[1:29:10] just allow him to be free
[1:29:12] what are the other
[1:29:15] uh uh uh owner of slave or you know
[1:29:19] going to how high how are they going to
[1:29:22] behave
[1:29:24] and then if he comes and and and yet his
[1:29:30] uh attitude is indifferent to him
[1:29:33] affected Church
[1:29:39] praise the Lord
[1:29:41] amen it will affect the church
[1:29:45] now so it's a very sensitive area
[1:29:56] verse two of whom
[1:29:58] I have sent again
[1:30:01] thou therefore receive him that is
[1:30:08] who have retained with me
[1:30:15] that industrial he might have ministered
[1:30:19] unto me
[1:30:20] in the bounds of the Gospel
[1:30:25] now so Paul is saying I will have kept
[1:30:28] him with me
[1:30:31] praise the Lord
[1:30:33] but I'm sending him back
[1:30:35] to you
[1:30:37] which of course there is there's there's
[1:30:40] a lot of reason there because Paul being
[1:30:43] a prisoner
[1:30:45] uh unisimus who have stayed right there
[1:30:47] with him and uh uh and self him and all
[1:30:52] of that but it was not going to repair a
[1:30:55] lot of things
[1:30:56] because this man herself in phaloman
[1:30:59] house
[1:31:00] let's let's take Fatima have boys they
[1:31:04] they I mean they know they know him they
[1:31:06] got used to him and now every one of
[1:31:08] them they are hurt because of what he
[1:31:11] have done
[1:31:13] praise the Lord so in one sense keeping
[1:31:17] him away will not bring a complete
[1:31:20] healing
[1:31:23] he has to return back to where he have
[1:31:26] done the wrong
[1:31:28] praise the Lord
[1:31:30] amen
[1:31:32] you know brother Branham said that's the
[1:31:34] reason why he said because sin was
[1:31:37] committed in this body he says that's
[1:31:40] the reason why the unjust will be raised
[1:31:43] from the dead and in the body that they
[1:31:45] commit sin in their body they will be
[1:31:48] judged
[1:31:54] amen so Paul yeah wanting the
[1:31:58] restoration and he wanting the healing
[1:32:01] not only offer of uh of uh
[1:32:08] but also to realize that the the
[1:32:11] strength is going to bring to the church
[1:32:15] praise the Lord
[1:32:17] you see sometimes when we have some of
[1:32:19] these sticky things in church where
[1:32:22] people are talking about and people are
[1:32:24] talking about it just people you know
[1:32:26] this thing you know this thing happen
[1:32:28] and and those things are happening
[1:32:30] Church it happened every word but
[1:32:32] sometimes it takes how the Holy Spirit
[1:32:34] deals with those things
[1:32:37] equal strengthen the church
[1:32:40] praise the Lord how the holy spirit will
[1:32:43] just collect all the gossip from our
[1:32:46] mouths
[1:32:48] and all our personal opinion
[1:32:51] amen how the holy spirit will just
[1:32:54] gather all of that
[1:32:57] and bring us to see the bigger picture
[1:33:00] bring us to see why he allowed such a
[1:33:03] thing in the church
[1:33:11] praise the Lord
[1:33:20] recently there was something that took
[1:33:22] place
[1:33:23] I never thought about it it just came to
[1:33:26] my mind
[1:33:27] on the last communion service we had
[1:33:31] there was a lady that came into the
[1:33:33] church
[1:33:35] and
[1:33:37] I never even saw her at the time I was
[1:33:39] preaching I think she came in just at
[1:33:41] the time of the communion I never saw
[1:33:44] her so uh uh right right uh in in seven
[1:33:48] the communion you know uh you know well
[1:33:51] I mean we served the communion and
[1:33:54] everything but what happened was after
[1:33:56] that I called I called the Deacon in the
[1:33:58] office and we were talking about it
[1:34:01] and uh and we spoke about it a little
[1:34:04] bit so I was I was instructing him I was
[1:34:08] instructing him to to uh to get the lady
[1:34:11] uh or get one of the the elder sister to
[1:34:15] be able to to talk to the lady uh uh why
[1:34:19] the service was going on
[1:34:22] so after the Deacon left the office
[1:34:25] when I closed the door
[1:34:29] it was just almost like
[1:34:33] you know the Lord just brought
[1:34:37] Simon house
[1:34:40] with the lady that came to wash Jesus
[1:34:42] feet
[1:34:43] I was sitting right in the office there
[1:34:45] it just that just hit me
[1:34:49] because I know in myself in my own self
[1:34:52] I know how I would deal with it
[1:34:55] you know
[1:34:57] my I felt like my Approach was a little
[1:35:00] bit rough and the Lord just hit me with
[1:35:03] that so I stepped out quickly and I
[1:35:05] called brother uh called the the Deacon
[1:35:07] brother and I said just just leave it
[1:35:09] let's leave it let's leave it let's talk
[1:35:11] about it after just just leave it
[1:35:15] and now so I sat in the office I just
[1:35:18] prayed I said Lord uh uh you know
[1:35:20] forgive me for the way I taught thinking
[1:35:22] about this and just just uh we just gave
[1:35:25] everything to you and uh
[1:35:27] you know and then after this after the
[1:35:29] service I mean the talk just stayed on
[1:35:31] my mind for the rest of the evening I
[1:35:33] was just I was just saying to myself I
[1:35:35] wonder why the Lord allowed this
[1:35:39] because normally the Deacon will call
[1:35:42] the person if if they are a stranger and
[1:35:44] talk to them and uh
[1:35:48] you know when I when when I used to be
[1:35:50] radical I would even refuse the person
[1:35:52] right in the communion
[1:35:55] you know and I saw I was just I was just
[1:35:58] thinking about it all through the night
[1:35:59] I said Lord I wonder why you allow this
[1:36:04] am I never know
[1:36:06] praise the Lord
[1:36:08] and uh
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:11] you know so it's it's just one of those
[1:36:13] things
[1:36:15] it's just one of those things
[1:36:18] the lord gave us gifts he gave us
[1:36:21] officers and he gave us his word the
[1:36:25] prophecy you know how to handle those
[1:36:27] things you have given Church order you
[1:36:29] are giving church discipline but
[1:36:32] sometimes when when those kind of a
[1:36:34] situation happen
[1:36:37] like I've always said uh sometimes if
[1:36:41] the law brings people you know that that
[1:36:44] is not up to our dressing standard and
[1:36:46] when the Lord allow people that you know
[1:36:49] that is not up to our believing standard
[1:36:51] to come into our mess sometimes is how
[1:36:55] the Lord is trusting us to see how we
[1:36:58] would deal with them
[1:37:01] praise the Lord the Lord told Brother
[1:37:03] Branham there's a test waiting for you
[1:37:05] he never told the prophet what the test
[1:37:07] was
[1:37:09] and then how could he test his Prophet
[1:37:12] with young people making love right in
[1:37:15] the service
[1:37:16] how could he do that
[1:37:18] how would the Lord allow that
[1:37:23] testing brother Branham for the greatest
[1:37:25] part of his ministry just before the
[1:37:27] airport
[1:37:32] and brother Branham says I'm roaring
[1:37:34] myself and
[1:37:38] I know him myself I will never allow
[1:37:41] that to happen
[1:37:43] but the Lord just got a hold of me and I
[1:37:46] said young man stop doing that
[1:37:49] and the more I said it the more they
[1:37:52] kept doing it I said this is the house
[1:37:54] of the Lord don't do that here
[1:37:58] praise the Lord
[1:38:00] just for the Lord to tell him
[1:38:03] that you have passed the test
[1:38:10] this was the test
[1:38:12] to your temple
[1:38:17] praise the Lord
[1:38:19] amen amen
[1:38:20] so Philemon yield is facing his tests
[1:38:23] how is he going to deal with this
[1:38:28] a man herself in his house his family
[1:38:31] got used to him and and his children and
[1:38:34] and even the church God used to him he
[1:38:37] was he was a slave though but uh but I
[1:38:39] mean he was he was he was the one
[1:38:41] everybody got new now he's coming how is
[1:38:44] he going to deal with this and Paul is
[1:38:46] saying I'm not going to detect to you
[1:38:51] I'm going to allow you to deal with this
[1:38:56] praise the Lord
[1:38:58] amen Paul is saying I could have kept
[1:39:01] him
[1:39:01] to myself
[1:39:03] for him to minister unto me verse 14 but
[1:39:06] but without
[1:39:09] the mind
[1:39:13] who I do nothing
[1:39:16] they are the benefits should not be as
[1:39:19] aware of necessity but willingly
[1:39:24] praise the Lord
[1:39:28] for perhaps
[1:39:30] he therefore departed for a season
[1:39:34] that thou should have received him
[1:39:37] forever
[1:39:41] not now as a seven
[1:39:44] but above a seven
[1:39:47] a beloved brother especially to me
[1:39:53] but how much more unto thee both in the
[1:39:57] flesh
[1:39:58] and in the Lord
[1:40:00] praise the Lord
[1:40:03] if thou counts mean therefore
[1:40:06] a partner receive him as myself
[1:40:11] praise the Lord
[1:40:13] I believe for father monies it's easy
[1:40:17] he had a lot of confidence in Paul he
[1:40:20] knows his testimony among the saints
[1:40:24] but also the people around him
[1:40:28] praise the Lord
[1:40:30] also the people around him
[1:40:33] how is he going to handle his family his
[1:40:36] wife and his children to be able to deal
[1:40:38] with this man
[1:40:40] that might have stole some things from
[1:40:42] the house
[1:40:45] and how is he going to bring this man
[1:40:47] before the church and say this is our
[1:40:50] beloved brother
[1:40:56] some of the responsibility that is in
[1:41:00] leadership
[1:41:05] Paul says uh verse 19 our Paul have
[1:41:09] written it with my own hands
[1:41:12] praise the Lord
[1:41:14] some of the reason why he said that is
[1:41:16] because most of the time they use tribes
[1:41:20] he will be detecting and they will be
[1:41:22] writing his letter
[1:41:23] well he wanted
[1:41:25] to to to show an attachment to this
[1:41:29] letter
[1:41:30] that he might change in my feathers
[1:41:34] I wrote this with my hands
[1:41:40] praise the Lord
[1:41:43] I Paul have written it with my own hands
[1:41:45] I will repay
[1:41:49] I will repaint it
[1:41:53] I I do not say to thee how thou owe it
[1:41:58] unto me
[1:41:59] even thine own self beside
[1:42:04] yeah brother
[1:42:07] let's let me have joy in thee
[1:42:11] in the Lord refresh my vows in the Lord
[1:42:17] having confidence in thy obedience are
[1:42:20] wrote unto thee knowing that thou will
[1:42:24] also do more as are saying praise the
[1:42:27] Lord
[1:42:29] Hallelujah
[1:42:36] but whether prepared means also a
[1:42:39] lodging for I trust that through your
[1:42:42] prayers I shall be given unto you
[1:42:47] praise the Lord
[1:42:49] amen
[1:42:50] I believe there was some there was a
[1:42:54] uh how can I call it that was there was
[1:42:58] a smart way to be able to seal the
[1:43:00] letter
[1:43:01] in a sense to say I would come and see
[1:43:04] what the church has done with this
[1:43:06] situation
[1:43:08] so prepare the place for Me Maybe by
[1:43:10] your prayers I will come but Paul never
[1:43:13] came out of praising from this he stayed
[1:43:15] there in the dungeon that was that was
[1:43:17] word that was some of his last letter
[1:43:19] that he wrote now so we see here that uh
[1:43:23] uh uh this uh whole thought of this
[1:43:28] prisoner of Jesus Christ that Paul uh
[1:43:31] introduced this letter wave which which
[1:43:33] subject will be dwelling around a little
[1:43:35] bit here
[1:43:37] we see the whole context there
[1:43:40] and even when we take ourselves into the
[1:43:43] picture to realize
[1:43:46] that uh
[1:43:50] the father have to send his son in our
[1:43:53] place
[1:43:56] the Lord
[1:43:58] amen
[1:44:02] which is which of course that was the
[1:44:04] beautiful picture like if I says one
[1:44:07] have to die
[1:44:10] for all they have to give one
[1:44:12] so between Jesus and Barabbas
[1:44:19] the religious World truths Barabas
[1:44:23] but can you think
[1:44:26] what it was for Barabbas because he knew
[1:44:29] he was condemned
[1:44:32] he has started an insurrection
[1:44:36] praise the Lord he was condemned
[1:44:40] and most of the time those kind of for
[1:44:43] Crime it was not just like uh you know
[1:44:46] uh uh you know uh a petty crime that was
[1:44:50] something against the state of Rome
[1:44:54] so he was condemned
[1:44:58] for them to come to his praising and
[1:45:00] tell him
[1:45:02] you've been called out to go free
[1:45:05] praise the Lord
[1:45:07] he was you I guess he was wondering in
[1:45:09] his mind
[1:45:10] what has happened
[1:45:15] have we taken over the Roman government
[1:45:17] or what what actually has happened
[1:45:19] but just for him to get outside and
[1:45:21] realize there's another man and he's not
[1:45:24] a Roman either
[1:45:26] that is going to take his place
[1:45:33] social Redemption story
[1:45:36] and that's why Paul is playing out here
[1:45:41] I could have kept him to myself for him
[1:45:43] to minister to me
[1:45:44] because he has started to be profitable
[1:45:46] to me
[1:45:50] praise the Lord
[1:45:54] he has started to be profitable you see
[1:45:57] I was thinking about this as I was uh uh
[1:46:00] uh looking at this because you'll
[1:46:03] realize here that when Paul sent out
[1:46:06] this letter that was the very same time
[1:46:08] he sent out the letter to the Ephesian
[1:46:11] church and also to the church that was
[1:46:14] in laodisha and also to the collusion
[1:46:16] church and and the church in Philippa
[1:46:20] and then he had to send onesimance
[1:46:25] with someone that will protect him
[1:46:29] because you have to realize that he's a
[1:46:32] runaway slave
[1:46:33] so he's a man that is wanted
[1:46:37] he needed to be protected amen that he
[1:46:41] was going back to his slave owner and
[1:46:43] you know he was going to reconcile and
[1:46:45] all of that so I I mean I was just
[1:46:48] thinking in my mind
[1:46:52] because many of the times when Paul was
[1:46:55] writing these letters like I said he was
[1:46:58] in Chains so he will ask for the uh a
[1:47:02] stride and a man would come and sit down
[1:47:04] and be writing uh everything that he's
[1:47:08] saying and writing it just as he's
[1:47:10] saying in my mind I was thinking was
[1:47:13] that the was that the situation with
[1:47:15] onesimus
[1:47:17] that just by listening to the letter
[1:47:19] that is sent to the Ephesian Church
[1:47:22] all listening to the letter that is
[1:47:24] written told the church in in in in in
[1:47:27] in Philippa
[1:47:29] could be able to to to to create a
[1:47:33] conviction
[1:47:35] because Paul never preached to the man
[1:47:38] uh uh the the Philippian Jailer
[1:47:42] he understood that and when the man came
[1:47:45] he says yeah yeah we are I mean we have
[1:47:47] not gone and and the man looking at him
[1:47:49] and says that then what what can I do to
[1:47:51] be safe
[1:47:52] he said believe thou in the house
[1:47:56] praise the Lord you see those other
[1:47:58] believers they live with such a sense of
[1:48:02] consecration around him
[1:48:05] amen I mean people seen us were easily
[1:48:09] drawn into their presence just because
[1:48:13] of the life of consecration that that
[1:48:16] they believe
[1:48:18] praise the Lord
[1:48:21] that Paul will be able to to to to
[1:48:24] minister to this man and and and and and
[1:48:27] and he will be he will be so Earnest
[1:48:30] enough to to to to to start to tell all
[1:48:33] his life story how I got in it and and
[1:48:36] and and uh
[1:48:38] my master is is Philemon volume up from
[1:48:41] word
[1:48:45] say really you mean you were you you
[1:48:49] mean you stole from him
[1:48:52] do you know him oh yeah he's my son in
[1:48:55] the gospel
[1:48:56] really
[1:48:58] praise the Lord
[1:49:02] but such an atmosphere such a life of
[1:49:05] consecration the atmosphere that it
[1:49:07] created around them remember the prophet
[1:49:09] of God says those he says those Apostles
[1:49:12] they were men of few words
[1:49:17] they were not men that were arguing over
[1:49:19] the godhead or they were arguing over
[1:49:22] the seals or arguing over a Doctrine
[1:49:25] there were men of few words
[1:49:28] they were carrying such a present with
[1:49:31] them that they just had to say few words
[1:49:36] it was enough to be able to capture a
[1:49:38] man's heart
[1:49:40] praise the Lord
[1:49:43] and sometimes that's the thing that that
[1:49:45] that trouble us because we think we need
[1:49:48] to be able to explain the godhead before
[1:49:50] we can witness to Jesus Christ all all
[1:49:52] you need to do is to just have a
[1:49:54] consecrated life
[1:49:56] just telling somebody that God love you
[1:49:58] is enough to be able to draw that person
[1:50:02] to a life of conviction
[1:50:05] you don't have to explain the seals you
[1:50:07] don't have to explain that God sent a
[1:50:09] prophet all you need to do you just need
[1:50:12] to have a life behind the name amen
[1:50:16] because there's the light behind the
[1:50:18] name that make the demon tremble
[1:50:25] praise the Lord
[1:50:27] that's Paul doing a work of the ministry
[1:50:31] reconciling
[1:50:34] two men that one love one another I
[1:50:37] believe that father my love onesimus I
[1:50:40] say seven
[1:50:41] and being a Christian a slave master I
[1:50:46] believe that he was nice to all of the
[1:50:48] people serving him
[1:50:50] a man that He Loved Before the man that
[1:50:53] he he took into his home and and into
[1:50:56] the life of his family have now stolen
[1:51:00] something away
[1:51:01] Rob his home and gone
[1:51:05] praise the Lord
[1:51:07] but Paul knowing that the work of the
[1:51:10] ministry is a work of reconciliation
[1:51:14] praise the Lord
[1:51:16] it's a work of reconciliation
[1:51:20] that's the work of the ministry that's
[1:51:22] why the Holy Ghost must be doing in our
[1:51:24] homes
[1:51:26] reconciling us
[1:51:28] with one another reconciling us
[1:51:31] and then we can carry also that Ministry
[1:51:34] the reconciliation to people that are in
[1:51:36] need
[1:51:38] is not trying to find culture and trying
[1:51:41] to find scripture where we can break
[1:51:43] people apart
[1:51:46] and separate ourselves no
[1:51:49] a Ministry of reconciliation
[1:51:54] trying to reconcile a man back to his
[1:51:58] master
[1:51:59] because that's that's what Christ did
[1:52:02] for us he reconciled us back to the
[1:52:04] father amen
[1:52:07] praise the Lord
[1:52:10] so you see the responsibility
[1:52:15] he said I will send you back
[1:52:19] Onision he had a responsibility
[1:52:24] Philemon also had a responsibility
[1:52:29] praise the Lord
[1:52:31] he's going back to live in the presence
[1:52:33] of the very people that he have heard
[1:52:37] and to trust the grace of God to be able
[1:52:41] to heal the wounds
[1:52:47] praise the Lord
[1:52:49] maybe at a time he was not a not a
[1:52:51] Believer he might have said nasty thing
[1:52:54] about the church
[1:52:57] he might have mocked them he might have
[1:52:59] teased him
[1:53:03] are we together
[1:53:18] I'm going to read a few things here from
[1:53:20] Brother Branham
[1:53:21] and then we were close
[1:53:25] but I just thought that it would have
[1:53:27] been a good thing
[1:53:28] for us to go through
[1:53:31] just read that letter
[1:53:33] like I said I was supposed to be a
[1:53:36] personal letter
[1:53:39] but Paul had to address it to the church
[1:53:42] because the church has a responsibility
[1:53:46] praise the Lord
[1:53:49] the responsibility of the church
[1:53:52] is the mystery it is is the ministry of
[1:53:54] reconciliation
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:59] where we where we can reconcile
[1:54:01] ourselves back and reconcile one another
[1:54:06] praise the Lord
[1:54:08] even even when uh uh the the order of
[1:54:13] discipline that is placed in the church
[1:54:15] that when a man is now living up to the
[1:54:18] standard of the word and he's trying to
[1:54:19] bring reproach on the church
[1:54:22] the Apostle Paul said he must be we must
[1:54:25] turn him over to Satan he must be as
[1:54:28] communicated what is the purpose of that
[1:54:30] reconciliation
[1:54:33] that's the purpose of that the purpose
[1:54:35] of that is that when he's turned over to
[1:54:38] the devil just like it was in uh uh
[1:54:41] First Corinthians chapter two of that
[1:54:43] man that was sleeping with his uh
[1:54:45] father's wife he was he was
[1:54:47] excommunicated and then when Paul came
[1:54:49] back uh uh uh he had repented and he was
[1:54:53] restored back to the church the prep was
[1:54:56] there is that when a person is as
[1:54:58] communicated that he will that his flesh
[1:55:00] will be dead with it would bring him
[1:55:03] back to to to repentance for him to be
[1:55:06] reconciled so the purpose of the church
[1:55:08] the ministry is reconciliation a
[1:55:11] Reconciliation is not behind the things
[1:55:13] we are doing we have missed the purpose
[1:55:15] of the church
[1:55:20] if we try we if if if if we are seeking
[1:55:24] to show that we are a straight group or
[1:55:26] We Don't Take No Nonsense I mean we are
[1:55:28] straight we are on the word there is no
[1:55:31] room for compromising year then and and
[1:55:33] and and and and we think that is the
[1:55:35] drive of the church where we're just
[1:55:38] burning ourselves out
[1:55:40] we are burning ourselves out because
[1:55:42] pretty soon we will be faced with all of
[1:55:44] those uh uh uh false energy that we put
[1:55:47] in the minds of the people
[1:55:51] the purpose of the ministry
[1:55:54] is reconciliation
[1:55:58] praise the Lord
[1:56:00] that is the purpose of the ministry that
[1:56:02] is the drive of the ministry that's what
[1:56:05] the Holy Ghost want to do
[1:56:07] but you see
[1:56:10] this is nothing that
[1:56:12] we can do in ourself
[1:56:15] praise the Lord
[1:56:17] amen this is not thing that we can do in
[1:56:21] ourselves
[1:56:22] a man or a woman
[1:56:24] has to be a prisoner of love
[1:56:29] you have to be bound by God's word
[1:56:34] you have to be in that confinement of
[1:56:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:56:40] will he directs your talks he overrules
[1:56:44] your feeling
[1:56:46] praise the Lord he can be able to drive
[1:56:49] you to his purpose
[1:56:52] not to our own will or our own feelings
[1:56:59] you see this this is this this that we
[1:57:02] have just read it's it's many years
[1:57:05] away from
[1:57:07] this time that we are living
[1:57:09] reading about uh Joseph being in factors
[1:57:13] of chains and iron is many years so it's
[1:57:17] easy to read these things from the
[1:57:18] scripture and even from the message and
[1:57:20] say Amen
[1:57:23] but when the word is made flesh
[1:57:26] when we have to deal with faith in our
[1:57:29] own life
[1:57:31] we have to deal with faith in a
[1:57:33] situation of a neighbor or a brother or
[1:57:36] a sister
[1:57:40] dealing with faith in a place of a wife
[1:57:43] of or a loved one or a family member a
[1:57:47] siblings
[1:57:51] praise the Lord
[1:57:53] sometimes that's worse
[1:57:56] the rubber meets the road
[1:58:00] because it's easy to preach forgiveness
[1:58:04] but
[1:58:07] when phaloman will see
[1:58:09] unisima is coming with a letter in his
[1:58:12] hands
[1:58:14] from Paul
[1:58:18] receiving it from Paul he having so much
[1:58:21] Covenant that if Paul was the one that
[1:58:23] taught this man
[1:58:25] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm convinced
[1:58:28] that he have fully repented because Paul
[1:58:31] will not send some some Halfway
[1:58:33] Christian to me
[1:58:37] but it does not stop there
[1:58:41] he have his family
[1:58:43] Paul said receive this man
[1:58:45] just like you will receive me
[1:58:50] oh he's going to be more profitable
[1:58:52] profitable to you now because he's no
[1:58:55] longer
[1:58:59] not on it now Paul did not say he's no
[1:59:02] longer a slave but he's not only a seven
[1:59:05] to you but he's also a brother
[1:59:13] praise the Lord
[1:59:16] it goes to show that it is not just a
[1:59:19] slogan when we call one another brother
[1:59:21] God bless you brother God bless you
[1:59:23] Sister it's not just a slogan it's not
[1:59:26] enough for just a handshake what is the
[1:59:29] feelings
[1:59:30] what is the feelings
[1:59:33] what they what do we take to heart when
[1:59:36] you say God bless you brother
[1:59:40] they'll say I want to just stop in the
[1:59:41] handshake
[1:59:47] praise the Lord
[1:59:50] you know how easy it would have been for
[1:59:52] family man and Paul who have wrote him a
[1:59:54] letter your former servant that stole
[1:59:57] from you and ran away from you he's now
[1:59:59] saved he's here with me and he's saving
[2:00:01] me
[2:00:03] oh it would have been easy for that
[2:00:05] church to praise the Lord oh thank you
[2:00:07] Jesus
[2:00:09] read that letter in church everybody
[2:00:12] will raise their hands they would clap
[2:00:14] their hands for Jesus
[2:00:16] but he's coming through the door
[2:00:18] praise the Lord he's coming through the
[2:00:21] door he's going to sit right in the
[2:00:22] assembly with you
[2:00:29] he's coming through the door he's going
[2:00:30] to sit in there somewhere with you
[2:00:34] if he was a robber are we going to allow
[2:00:36] him to be alone in the house anymore
[2:00:40] or something is going to trigger in US
[2:00:47] watch him
[2:00:49] is that is that going to be the attitude
[2:00:55] are we going to count on what the blood
[2:00:58] of Jesus Christ has done in the life of
[2:01:00] a person
[2:01:03] or are we going to bring all our humans
[2:01:05] truth in and and and and our our
[2:01:08] critical thoughts and and drawing in our
[2:01:10] mind
[2:01:13] is that how we are dealing with the
[2:01:15] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:01:21] praise the Lord
[2:01:25] I say this and then I close
[2:01:27] there's a story
[2:01:29] that went around
[2:01:31] and uh
[2:01:33] I try to build it a sermon on that many
[2:01:36] years ago called the blood and Triumph
[2:01:39] and this story was
[2:01:41] how
[2:01:43] a pastor's son
[2:01:44] LED
[2:01:46] a girl that was a real world girl
[2:01:49] and she was just living a horrible life
[2:01:51] on drugs alcohol
[2:01:54] immoral life
[2:01:56] praise the Lord
[2:01:57] but this young
[2:01:59] boy led her to the Lord
[2:02:02] and uh
[2:02:06] and that's how she goes safe
[2:02:08] and
[2:02:10] she was growing in church and all of
[2:02:12] that
[2:02:15] and it turned out when he wanted a wife
[2:02:18] he fell in love with her
[2:02:22] but then the church
[2:02:24] would not accept
[2:02:25] him to marry her
[2:02:29] praise the Lord
[2:02:34] and when the and when the young man
[2:02:36] stood before
[2:02:38] the the others of the church
[2:02:43] he read Hebrew chapter 6.
[2:02:48] he was reading
[2:02:52] and then he told the people
[2:02:56] what we are talking about tonight
[2:03:00] it's not this young lady
[2:03:02] while we are talking about tonight is
[2:03:05] not just onesima
[2:03:08] what we're talking about tonight is the
[2:03:11] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03:13] on trial
[2:03:16] we are putting the blood on trial
[2:03:20] how much confidence do we have
[2:03:24] in the work of the blood
[2:03:27] the person says I'm sorry
[2:03:30] please forgive me
[2:03:31] how much confidence do we have in the
[2:03:35] blood
[2:03:39] do you see how we can trample over the
[2:03:41] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03:44] just for our self-gratification
[2:03:48] we want to be convinced we want to be
[2:03:51] satisfied
[2:03:55] he said is the blood on Triumph
[2:03:58] you you now put him in on trial
[2:04:01] I don't think you are putting this young
[2:04:02] woman on trial
[2:04:04] I don't think tonight we are putting
[2:04:06] onisimus on trial
[2:04:10] we are putting the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:04:12] we try it
[2:04:17] are we going to call the thing that
[2:04:19] God's blood has Center father he had
[2:04:22] Justified
[2:04:25] are we going to say it's not justified
[2:04:28] enough
[2:04:29] because it has not met our church
[2:04:32] standard
[2:04:34] or I have not met our our our doctrine
[2:04:38] of
[2:04:39] points
[2:04:44] praise the Lord
[2:04:48] let us never put the blood of Jesus on
[2:04:50] trial
[2:04:53] praise the Lord
[2:04:55] Amen Let Us never put it on trial
[2:04:58] because if you even try to put it on
[2:04:59] trial
[2:05:00] it would never fail
[2:05:02] because they have never lose its power
[2:05:06] praise the Lord it had never lose his
[2:05:08] power
[2:05:09] it can say sanctify the most worst
[2:05:12] sinner
[2:05:15] Brad Brown said they can take a person
[2:05:17] from the pit of sin
[2:05:20] and make them a sin in church
[2:05:25] praise the Lord
[2:05:30] and may God help every one of us
[2:05:34] in a way
[2:05:36] we deal with one another
[2:05:39] in the way we deal with our brothers and
[2:05:41] sisters
[2:05:43] praise the Lord
[2:05:45] even with the way we deal with the ones
[2:05:47] that are weak in faith
[2:05:49] let us not put the blood on Triumph
[2:05:54] let us not pour the blood and try it
[2:05:55] brother Branham said question and answer
[2:05:57] he says if if a sin let me make one of
[2:06:00] the worst state if a prostitute should
[2:06:02] walk through this door tonight
[2:06:05] and come to this Altar and give her
[2:06:09] heart to the Lord
[2:06:10] praise the Lord the prophet of God said
[2:06:13] before God she stands as Justified
[2:06:18] as every one of us sitting here tonight
[2:06:23] praise the Lord
[2:06:24] now when a place where you are older
[2:06:26] than heart is in your chronological age
[2:06:28] for the many years that you've been
[2:06:31] serving the lord
[2:06:34] but before God
[2:06:39] she's saying that justified God don't
[2:06:41] see one person more Justified than the
[2:06:43] other
[2:06:44] no God don't see that
[2:06:48] if he sees us Justified we are all
[2:06:51] before God the same
[2:06:58] praise the Lord
[2:07:02] but just like I said
[2:07:04] you have to be bound
[2:07:06] in the chains of love
[2:07:09] you have to be bound in the chains of
[2:07:12] God's love
[2:07:16] for you for you to be able to treat
[2:07:21] and not a sinner that is saved by grace
[2:07:25] just like
[2:07:28] the grace of God treated you
[2:07:34] you have to be bound
[2:07:36] in the chains of love
[2:07:40] in that filter of Love verb say Paul was
[2:07:43] bound
[2:07:46] in the theater of love
[2:07:54] anything less than that
[2:07:57] we're going to be so critical
[2:08:02] we're going to be so radical in our
[2:08:05] attitude
[2:08:10] praise the Lord
[2:08:20] let's buy our heads tonight
[2:08:42] I'm a prisoner
