grace his love and his mercies Upon Us praise be to God yes before we open the scriptures early this morning I I I was just thinking because I had a rough night then I said if I come behind the pocket I need I need a handkerchief so if I have to use it but I don't have one then I remembered we have paper towels here I said the paper towel would do but I don't want to blow my nose and put it anywhere around here I even forgot I could put it in my pocket praise the Lord then I said no it's a huggage if I need but I don't have one and then I got up got ready went into my closet just picks what I'm wearing right now and I went to I to iron the the parents normally I wouldn't even put my hands in the pocket lo and behold I put the prince on the ironing board and here was the handkerchief inside halfway out and I said praise God you know the very little things the very minute things means a lot to the God we are serving it may not mean anything to you but it meant a lot to me praise be to God so whatever you are going to no matter how small it is just know that it means a lot to God he is in the minute details of every aspect of our life praise be to God if we can reach out for our Bibles before we get seated tell with me to Hebrews foreign I mean let's just start from verse one Hebrews 12 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do have so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endeared the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the Throne of god let's take verse 3 also for consider him that endured second tradition of Sinners against himself lest ye be worried and faint in your minds shall we pray our Lord and our savior Jesus we thank this so much for having made it possible again for us to be here this morning we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace that has been Upon Our Lives we thank you for your tender hand Lord Of Love that has taken a hold of Our Lives and we are so grateful father that before there was a world you knew us and praise be to thee all God for undertaking for us in every aspect of Our Lives for we have come this far purely by the grace of God we are so grateful Lord that we are serving a living God last night through the early hours of this morning we had a heavy downpour I don't know about this area but around Saint Michael the rainfall that we saw was probably the heaviest since coming to the U.S and I got up this morning looked through the window and I said when rain comes down during spring it's just to give life to the trees to the shrubs to the grasses and they are happy they're blossom and they prosper and the same rain comes in four and the trees and the shrubs and the grass they die and my mind kept going around this is not the first time this thought has come to me but father to know that we are living in the springtime of Our Lives even though it is late spring that the word of God comes to help us identify Who We Are to to to make our lives bloom it is pertaining to your kingdom to prosper Us in the things of God and that if we do not heed to the word now there is coming a day when the seasons change and this word goes back goes back to the children of Israel at that time the Bible makes us to understand he that is filthy will be filthy still he that is clean will be clean still it doesn't matter how much of this word we hear then that wouldn't make any difference Lord now that the doors are open father we pray the O God In The Name of Jesus and let us heat to your word let your word be deeply rooted in our hearts we pray and we besieged in the name of Jesus and let the light of the word father so shine in our lives Lord that we will give God a glory Lord everywhere we find ourselves we're just thank him we bless you and we glorify the father for all that they have done for us we want to take opportunity opportunity giving us one we don't want to look down upon it we don't want to ever get to a place in our lives and then turn back and see all the opportunities we have blown away to think that oh we had that opportunity to make a change and yet we made it to sleep by we don't want that to be our profession Lord we pray that you help us oh god father we have gathered with many needs on our hearts this morning and we pray father oh God come and take control over over the prophet Lord father I yield myself into your hands this morning and I pray Use Me Lord to minister unto every single need there is in the house this morning that as many of us that have gathered and as many as are following the service online Our Lives will never be the same again granted unto us father we pray and will be switched in Jesus name our Lord and savior we want to remember brother John Bibi before thee my Mary our Henry Jordan praying for since Jemima and father we lift all this needs into your hands and there are the various needs that are in the house this morning we pray father oh God may you remember your children according to their needs Lord and attempt to them Father repeatedly we pray in Jesus name shall we be seated praise the Lord are you happy to be in the house of God this morning praise the Lord where else would we rather be than be in the house of God praise God that is there is no place that compares to being in the house of God David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of God you may have dragged yourself here this morning I know there are a lot of us not working the night and it's not easy coming back from work in the morning and getting ready and coming to church but there is a reward for it if God has to pay you for it how much is he going to pay you for an hour but there is a reward for you it is not an easy task is difficult we are not going to undermine that it is a difficult thing and you may have dragged your feet you may have come maybe against your will but there is a part of you that is glad you are here praise be to God I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of God it's just an amazing thing to see the spirit of God moving in every single service if you come to see God you will see God I remember last last two weeks one brother one brother was preaching I was seated in the foyer and something I had talked about I don't know how many weeks ago he picks it up praise be to God and I remember I think it was a Wednesday service that night and I was talking about whatever it is that is going on in your life never forsake the Gathering of the Saints make sure that when the doors are open you are here do not let the devil ever give you a cause to stay away from church service and I said that so long as you are in service so long as you are in church the devil can never have this way and I remember giving an example of how let's say an animal is just trying to pray take his prey normally it doesn't go in the front or right in the midst of the animals no it just hides and then it just looks at the animals as they pass it's just waiting for the one that has has isolated itself the Wonder has decided oh that brother there has offended me I don't want to be in that group I'm just going to be by myself oh the minister offended me you know what I want to be by myself and then he takes a stand behind he isolates himself and then the animal just goes in and then picks takes it down best so long as it is in the midst of the rest is very very difficult for the lion or any other animal to just go in and catch his prey and I said just come anyhow and then the brother comes and then he picks it up trying to encourage us never forsake the garden of the Saints make sure you are in church anytime the doors are open be here to serve God and then he goes right and then he takes a different example that when you set fire and you look in the cold I mean you look in the fire every call has fire but when you reach out and you pick one out and you put it on the side it will just sit there before you realize it dies out it's a good thing to be in the house of God for every single service but when I was preaching last week and he read a scripture he took it from Psalm 27 4. if we can just read that Psalm 27 4. praise be to God Psalm 27 4. one thing have I desired of the Lord that that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple praise be to God one thing have I decided of the Lord be it in the house of God is such a precious thing then when all of life is over I want to be in the house of God and to be at the feet of the Lord that when life comes to a standstill and the doors are open I want to be in the house of God and be at his feet that when I get to a place and I don't understand what is going on I still want to be in church that when all the Miracles the signs and the Wonders when they all cease and there are no more tongues I still want to be in the house of God when the doors are opened and to be at his feet to seek the face of God and to acquire in his presence praise be to God it doesn't matter what happens being in the house of God can never be treated with any other thing we come we don't have the eyes to see but there are a lot of things that go on that when you sit down under the anointing of the word that is being preached that chains are being broken their course attacked asunder habits just leave sicknesses are healed it's not only when you come in the prayer line but as you sit down and you are feeling on the word things are happening praise be to God your life would never remain the same one thing is sure that the devil would never sit down and just let you go on and enjoy the way the way you want to order he's going to come your way invite him he doesn't need any invitation he will come anyhow brother running when he was preaching before then brother femi he gave us a story about his dad giving them telling us has given us a story his dad told them in Africa you know the hunters just picking up from what he told us they have a hunter's back and I know what he was talking about there are bugs they never wash that bar can be very very Dairy and when you see it you know that is a real Hunter every kill they get they put it in that bag and he said he does he says told them that every every animal the hunter kills he puts it in that bag and he said his dad told them that the hunter does not go after what it has already killed because he has it in his back right why does he have to run after it anymore it rather goes after the animal it does not have so when the devil is pursuing you it's because he doesn't have you when the devil is on your Trail it's an indication that the devil hasn't gotten you Emperor only said when he cited examples of uh I mean are most of transportation starting from the oldest Mass man using their legs and then he came I think he came to houses or donkeys cats I'm not very sure talks about cars talked about uh the place and he talked about what the the space rocket and he said he just takes a flight and just gets into space and he was trying to encourage us that you can take a walk with God and then you can get to a place where the devil can never follow you you can take a flight with God and the devil can never follow you now you can get into the presence of God and the devil cannot get there right praise be to God and last week brother what brother one was preaching and then he talks about the Tabernacle of Moses and talked about the Temple of the Temple of um Solomon and then the layout the inner Court the the other call the inner court and the innermost Court which is the holist of holies and you realize that you can get into the holies of holies into this Shekinah Glory into the presence of the almighty God a place where the devil can never venture none in the Old Testament days it was just a high priest who would go in there once in a year to I thought for the sins of the people but after Calvary the veil to the temple was right in Twain that every one of us not only the high priest but every one of us can walk into that presence of God not once in a year you can do that thousand times in a year and it is still all right praise God you can get there the devil cannot follow you but what happens a lot of the times a lot of the times we live below our God give giving privileges a lot of the times a lot of the times we really forget Who We Are by the way the theme of my sermon this morning is looking at the bigger picture praise be to God looking at the bigger picture we should change ourselves and we live below our god-giving privileges because we are not looking at the bigger picture yeah praise be to God now when we go back to the scripture we read Hebrews 2 verse one to three I am actually basing this on verse 2 the Bible says okay looking up unto Jesus the order and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross brother Branham told us that Jesus could have married now think about it if he had decided to marry and then he married and had an Earthly family and just stayed here what was going to become of you and me hey Gabriel brother told us being a private said he was tempted in everything possible in everything possible in everything that can ever cross your mind he was tempted in it and yet without sin and the prophet of God told us to be tempted is no sin is when you yield to it then you have given birth to sin and he did not sing praise be to God now think about it when the devil took him to the top of the mountain and he said just look at the the world just look at it and he showed him the world and there is Glory thereof and he said if you worship me I will give everything to you think about it if he had fallen for it where would you and I be why would you and I be if he had fallen for it sure but for the joy that was given him for the joy that was before him he did not yield to these Temptations right there was a joy that was set before him he was looking at the bigger picture he was looking at the bigger picture just think about it when he came to the end of his Road on this Earth he foresaw what he was going to go through it's one thing staking a man to the tree and just put in a bullet in their head or in their heart it doesn't take long they are gone and I have said before that I have seen a situation where somebody that was committed to death and also what is that what is death is one day born when they die wait till that day comes it's not an easy thing death of any kind it's not an easy thing to go through and that day comes and normally what they do to them they will come and tell them you know what ah yes your day has come your cup is full so uh get ready tomorrow we are going to kill you it's a good thing God has made death a secret can you imagine the chaos that was going to be on this Earth and I tell you they will tell you that anything you want ask for it will give it to you some will say oh I want this uh they will give them a package throw it down light another one it's not an easy thing and we are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ who could what he was going to go through not a death by the bullet I mean all the the torture the torture that that that that the punishment I mean the the cruel death that has not been any death more cruel than that and then he prayed prayed now when you read the scriptures he said father all things are possible take this cup away from me and then right the next sentence he said nevertheless not my will let your will be done just this morning it never hit me like that before but just this morning he just came to me that between him saying the father take away this cup take it away from me and then the next verse say nevertheless let your will be done how many minutes was it how many seconds elapsed how many hours went by I don't know but I don't believe maybe he just said take this cup away from me nevertheless that always be that I believe there was a lot of consideration that went on yes I believe that he began he began to began to and then he started thinking of the bigger picture I came here for a purpose thinking about it I came here here to die for the sin of this for this for the sin of the world I came here then I may destroy the west of the flesh I came here to to set the bondage he that is in bondage free he started thinking of the bigger picture and then he got to that person said father nevertheless not my will but your will be done looking at a bigger picture what if he had refused to die I'm all right what if he had refused to die why would we stand but he was looking at a bigger picture praise be to God now brother said in one of the messages he preached a lot on this as title but in one of them uh hearing him in one of those messages in 1956 I think two of them in that year and a couple uh in the other years right and I read I may never he was actually pray they never get able to shake their hands in this life but someday standing Yonder in the near future when life is all over and the great table is set and thousands of miles across the sky and we we look across the table to each other and the tears running down our cheeks love to hear them say yes brother Branham that night I cuddle Tabernacle it changed my life praise be to God while we are holding each other's hands and the tears of joy running down our cheeks the king will come out and wipe all our tears oh tears from our eyes and say don't cry children is all over now enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world praise be to God keep them sweet humble full of Mercy being the salt of the earth until the hour that you come for us I present them to thee thou has said in thy word no man can come to me except my father draws him first and all that comes to me I will give them eternal life and will raise them and will raise him up at the last days we know that that's the truth the person that I was looking for enter into the joys of the Lord that's been prepared for you since the foundation of the world the Lord Jesus for the joy that was set before him the Bible says he endured the cross the shame because there was a joy that was set before him is saying that says from the foundation of the world there is a joy that has been set before you and me so it was not only the Lord Jesus but there is a joy that has been said before you and me are we going to endure our cross he endured looking at the bigger picture are we going to endure our cross you said do we have a cross yes we have a cross because the Lord Jesus told his disciples If any man comes after me let him deny himself take out his cross and follow me so you have a cross I have a cross are we going to endure our cross are we going to deny ourselves he denied himself are you going to deny yourself and to follow him to take up your cross and to endure the cross for that matter are you going to do that and there is absolutely no way you can do it without looking up unto him as the scripture says looking up unto Jesus The Altar and the finisher of our faith the only way you can and endure the cross is by looking up to him praise the Lord looking at the bigger picture when you are looking at the bigger picture you don't see yourself you don't come in the picture when you begin to see yourself in the picture something is wrong when you begin to see yourself in the picture something is wrong and why looking at the bigger picture you don't even see the devil our anniversary you don't see him says somewhere that the devil is not even in the picture it's weird that put him in the picture he is not in the picture and why looking at the bigger picture the only person you see is Christ he is our mediator the mediator between God and man there is no way to look at a bigger picture without looking up onto him who is the author and the finisher of our faith that he alone bore our sins he alone took our judgment he was condemned to death just for love not because he did anything wrong but he was condemned in our place he became sin who never committed anything that we should become the very righteousness of God he gave his all for us he alone died in our place and while looking at a bigger picture there is none else you see but Christ if you are seeing someone else or seeing yourself then there is a problem somewhere praise be to God Christ is the bigger picture there are a lot of examples I can draw from but I just chose to here I think we are very good on time yes praise be to God that when when when when when Moses mother gave birth to him the king had issued a decree that any male child that is born should be cast in the Nile but the Bible says that Moses mother looked at him and he said he's a proper child he knew he was a proper child and he did not fear the king's commandment they did not fear the king's commandment they kept him because they knew that there was a purpose for his life they were looking at the bigger picture they didn't care what the king had said but they knew that God was going to keep him and when they kept him they couldn't keep him anymore we know the story how his mother made a basket pitched it and then went to put him on the Nile river that was infested with crocodiles and you will think that why would any mother do that or why would any person in their right Minds do that faith does not count on what you think is right put him on the river so you are looking for him he is out there and I dare you to go for him why because God had promised to deliver the children of Israel out of bondage and they knew that Moses was a deliverer God was going to deliver the children of Israel through him and they knew that God was going to protect that gift they were not looking at what the king had said they were just looking at the hand of God upon his life they were looking at the bigger picture and they didn't care what the King has said and Moses himself when he came of age and looking at the bigger picture as a matter of fact there was nobody that was I mean looking at his background where he came from and then being the nest Pharaoh in the making and turned his back on it it takes it takes the grace of God a man that was groomed to be the next pharaoh with all that power and authority the Pharaoh had all the wealth and the pets but looking at the bigger picture he chose not to be called Pharaoh's daughter's son he would look through the window and then see the children of Israel in the markets and identify himself with them looking at a bigger picture he didn't want to enjoy the pleasures of Egypt for a while he was looking at a bigger picture it doesn't matter how they insulted them how they broke their backs from the whips looking at a bigger picture he identified himself with them we're gonna talk about Abraham now when God called him to separate himself from father mother from Kindred from his stripe just come out to a line he was going to show him he stepped out and the Bible says that all his life he was looking for that City with the foundation whose builder in Mecca was God himself looking at the bigger picture God prospered him so much so much that Abraham could have said you know what I have been following this God for True to too much you know I am blessed I am satisfied with what I have today and then just decide I'm not going on anymore but that was not Abraham's position in spite of the blessings God has bestowed upon him he was still looking forward to that City he was still looking forward to that City looking at the bigger picture praise be to God looking at a bigger picture now in in the year 1666 September of 1666 . there was there was um there was there was fire in um London and they call it the great fires of London the great fires of London that fire lasted for four days and in central London out of the 80 000 homes or houses they were 70 000 houses were gutted by fire 70 000 houses out of the eighty thousand houses in central London gutted by fire and over a hundred thousand people were declared homeless what amazing thing that happened though was that not modern I think probably four or five people died the people that died were not more than 10. now when Central lending got consumed by fire there was a renowned architecture architect by the name of Christopher Wren w-r-e-n who was tasked to rebuild the Cathedral Saint Paul's Cathedral an Anglican Church he was tasked to rebuild that Cathedral and then one day when he went out there were three people Masons that were laying breads he went to the first one and he asked him what are you doing he said I'm laying bricks then he went to the second one and he asked him what are you doing he said I'm building a wall then he went to the third one and asked him what are you doing he said I'm building a cathedral praise be to God to every passerby all these three people were doing the same thing right but as a matter of fact they were not doing the same thing they were not doing the same thing mm-hmm we can come to church every day of the week or as the case is every Wednesday and every Sunday we can come to church and to everybody around here that sees us coming in and going out they will look at it and say oh they are all doing the same thing but what is the true picture before God what is the true picture before God now the first person when he said I am laying bricks he said I am laying breaks so I can get some money to take care of my family so all he was thinking of was just that present time was just that moment he was not thinking of anything further just that moment what he was going to get laying bricks the second person that said I am building a wall his story was not very different I am laying building a wall so I will get some money and take care of my family he was just thinking of the present moment but there was a third person who said I am building a cathedral he was not looking at the wages that was not how do I say that his point of Interest he was paid all right maybe he was even paid more than the first two people that that was not his satisfaction he was looking forward to a cathedral and when he said I am building a cathedral he said I am building a criteria for the Almighty praise be to God building a cathedral for the Almighty and then you look at a person like that when that person that place was in Ruins when he stood and looked at the ground he saw a cathedral that when the people were asked and he looked at them Excavating the ground he saw nothing but a cathedral that before the first block was ever he was looking at it and he was seeing a cathedral right now when they were laying blocks and raising walls that was not what he was seeing he was seen a cathedral he was always looking at a bigger picture and that was what was driving him so beyond the payment and Beyond the money and Beyond the past and Beyond the promotion he was looking forward to a cathedral for the Almighty and what he was seeing the rest were not seeing it the people that were passing by were not seeing it but he was in something Beyond it is possible it is possible to be in the house of God and yet be short-sighted sure you can be in the hands of God and all you are interested in is just coming and going out because it's Sunday because it's Wednesday but there is something Beyond coming and going there is something Beyond coming to church and sitting down and hearing the word of God and going there is something beyond that and are you seeing the bigger picture are you seeing the bigger picture or is just for the foreign just for the moment or what you get for the moment maybe here in the U.S we don't see it much but elsewhere you enter a bus before you avoid as a preacher on the bus and then you start preaching I remember having one Muslim friend who were in Ghana together with roommates um and then he's he's in uh somewhere in North Carolina now he's a Muslim he was and he still is and then he was going from kasoa to Accra and I he has so much respect for Christianity he has so much respect one time he told me that um if not of his background that he was going to be a Christian he told me that so he entered a car was going to Accra and then um the driver was playing a reggae song and then he turned it off and then a man stood and started preaching and then he listened and when the man was done he was asking for um offering and then he offered he gave money but he got so disappointed when after everything was said and then the car was quiet and the driver was so touched that he put on the gospel this very man that was preaching probably the driver oh put back the reggae song on [Music] my goodness Lord have mercy the money the man told him oh put back the reggae song on what a shame so there are people just for what they are going to get just for your belly for your stomachs and the Bible talks about them so but you may say oh no that is not my case but it is equally a very pitiful sight right that you can come to the house of God sit down hear the word get up go and come in and you don't see any effect of the word in your life you don't see any effect in your life the bigger picture is not you the bigger picture is not you remember that someone died in your place for God so loved the word that he gave us only begotten son whosoever believeth he should not perish but have everlasting life that somebody died in your place somebody took upon himself your sins and he nadered to the cross and that there is no sin that can be imputed unto you under the blood [Music] that you are free to save your God that you are no longer in bondage that you are a child of God praise be to God don't look at you what you did yesterday if you fall it's a child of God that has fallen that doesn't make you a demon get up and put your life together praise the Lord don't settle for anything less you can kill a sheep and then I don't care whether you boil it or you roast it or you fry it it will never change it into a goat right a selection sir the Bible says they just shall fall seven times and shall rise again don't let the devil pin you down because he did something wrong yesterday that is the blood of The Mercy Seat praise be to God we have a place to run for shelter and that is how we are still coming to church praise the Lord he was looking every time he looked he saw a cathedral the others were not seeing it and Beyond coming to church and going every day when we come we ought to see the hand of God we ought to be seeing what God has done not what we have done or what we can do we've been called to a finished work that's what we should be looking at that is why the reward is in this life we get some wedges and I'm not talking about going to work and making some money no yes we do that but we get some little blessings here and there by beyond that there is a reward [Music] don't settle for the blessings and then forget of the greater picture right because the reward far outweighs the blessings of this present time looking at a bigger picture and what he saw that there was a cathedral standing at long last what Joy that brings right it gives you a sense of accomplishment it gives you a sense of purpose it gives yourself Pride that you forget of all the payments you you ever given and then your joy is in this Cathedral that is standing that you can knock on your chest and see I was part of this dream praise be to God I was part of this dream we can also talk about Michelangelo that when he brought that big rock and every day he will just sit down and be chipping it chipping it for years just tripping it here and there people may have passed and looked at it and maybe have passed some get real comment or maybe have you have laughed at him why would you go and get some job why are you wasting time every day sitting here oh if it wasn't for your wife maybe you would have died ah you need you need to be making some money but he will just sit down why there was a each other was locked in in his mind a picture nobody saw only he could see that picture and as he was chipping it here and there people looked at it it didn't make sense to them they didn't know what this man was up to but every single Chip he made brought him closer to the picture that was in his mind you're coming to church and going may not make sense to anybody but every single service every single service when you come and you hear the word of God and you're taking something is getting you a step closer when you take your Bible and you read people may sit down and look at you as if you are crazy but with every verse with every chapter you are getting closer every single prayer draws you closer praise be to God there is a reward and that is coming is coming and then one day he did the last shipping and then here stands the statute of Moses before him praise be to God and then he looks at it and then he screams it was so real and then he hit it with his hammer mother speak it and left a dent it was so real to him so real I believe if that rock if that statue has spoken he will not be surprised because it was so real to him can you imagine how much satisfaction can you imagine that reward there is no amount of money that can replace that no amount of money that can ever replace that praise be to God so every step we take we are to be seeing a bigger picture coming and going is not enough keep looking at the Unseen by eyes of faith set your eyes on the go keep your eyes on the bigger picture because you can be distracted you can be distracted you can take your eyes on the bigger picture and the next thing you will not believe what you do the next thing you don't believe where you find yourself right best so long as you keep your eyes on the bigger picture on Christ on his finished works on what he has already done you are keeping your eyes on the go you are keeping your eyes on him I Promise You by the grace of God you are going to get to the right destination praise the Lord looking at a bigger picture God is looking at us in the end the imperfections of the present time the ups and the downs the hairless and the heartaches the troubles The Temptations the trials and all those things God is not looking at that God has a perfect picture of you praise be to God he has it in his album that we are going through a lot at this time but God is looking at you in your perfect state and that is what matters to God he has the final picture he has a final picture of you that is what matters at most now if if if we must see the same picture he is seen if we can only see what the father is saying they ups and downs will not hinder our work with God there's only one that matters all the father sees is he is between God and man for God so loved the word that he gave us his only begotten son if our sacrifices should be accepted it has to be through the Sun whatever we do we have to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whether we live whether we die whether we marry whether we giving to marriages whatever we do we have to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus there is no way our sacrifices can ever be received outside of him when God looks down all he sees is Christ the blood the blood that was shed for you and me and under that blood there is no sin there is no iniquity too big to be forgiven praise the Lord if God has to pay us for our Deeds how many do you think that would be if God has to pay you and me for our Deeds how much do you think that would be I don't think we would even like it because the Bible says the wages of sin is there right and that is our Deeds but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus something we don't deserve that is the reward that is the reward for saving God praise the Lord there is a reward for serving God whatever sacrifices you make for the kingdom of God would never go in vain whatever sacrifices you make in the service of the Lord it will never go even God would remember because if men being even know how to give good gifts to their children our heavenly father will remember your labor of love God will give you his holy spirit God Will Never Let You Down praise be to God will remember every sacrifice girls that behave yourselves God will remember your labor of love and every sacrifice you make for his kingdom God will remember it there was a story that was told I remember when I was doing not my national service I had done I was I was teaching in a TIA media Secondary School somewhere in Northern Ghana I thought that for two years and my Headmaster he was a Muslim and I had told a story I think I have since told that story maybe 20 30 times I don't remember now he said that a young man that completed his his uh a levels um here it will be the equivalent of high school he completed his a levels and now he wanted to go to university but there was no money he was Cash trapped so he went around selling books to be able to gather some money to go to school and he went to a village and in that Village there was a young girl and then he asked for water to drink and a girl went got him a cup of water and not only that but he emptied a tin of milk in that cup of water and then gave it to him to drink and then he drank that war and he was very very grateful then the girl said what are you selling so all their books uh can I can I can I see it the man said yes so she took it and just read the preface I said oh it's a nice book um let me go ask my daddy if he can buy me one he ran to his daddy with a book that he didn't have money so she came back and said I'm sorry um I couldn't daddy couldn't buy me the book and he felt so bad he felt so bad bad because he was sleep of these Book Sales he felt so bad that he couldn't give this girl the book but he asked the girl's name what is your name the girl told him his name and then he kept the name at the back part of his mind they never met again oh man finishes four years and I went into the medical school and he came out as a medical doctor and then he was posted to a village to go and save and he was there unknown to him this very girl was married and was also in the same Village and one day the doctor just left he had clothes for the day he went home I just want him to rest and here comes a call oh we have an emergency there is a lady that is in labor and she's at the point of death and she just he just took his things and just jumped and then rushed to the hospital and in fact if you know about some of the things that happened and uh I I I I I I I I I stayed in one one town in the northern region where a doctor a medical doctor killed 13 women who were in labor and they had complications and she had to operate on them this man killed all of them the 14th person was actually a friend a friends a friend's wife he was working at the Commercial Bank at the time and the man was so good the woman was so good and people went on their knees to cry to God that was the only woman that came out alive so it tells you how dangerous the things we take for granted here in America some parts of the world is not as easy as it is and this woman had to go oppression and they were scared to death and then she went through the surgical oppression mother was fine the baby was fine now they come to this next phase the next phase of the the hurdle you know how how expensive surgical operations are here in America I don't know how much but maybe it will be in the range of ten thousand dollars Maybe I don't know I don't think it would be anything nice so now this poor man had to raise money to go and pay for this surgical operation to get his family back and then he went and saw the food the food they had in their van that they were supposed to eat till the next season he went and sold everything and then he cut your animals and sold all their animals and it did not reach any way everywhere he went for help nobody could help him and then he ends up comes back to the hospital and then the mother he his wife and the baby they end up at the doctor's office and uh the doctor asked the woman um so um where have you lived before he said oh my parents uh gave birth to me he mentioned the place and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah then the doctor got to know this is the lady this is the lady so they were asking for the bill so the man said you know what just go to the accounts office and they'll tell you the bill you can pay on your way out and the mind you he didn't have the money so the doctor took a piece of paper and then he wrote on it paid with a tin of milk so it didn't make sense to them so they took it they went to the cashier they said this is your bill the man the man wanted to cry they said no but there is a note from the doctor it says paid with a tin of milk they say no we don't understand that so on their way out now the doctor came and said do you remember there was a young man several years ago that was selling books and then go to your village and then you give that man a cup of water is a yes are you the one who say yes I'm the one and the woman started crying he said yes that is paid that has taken care of the surgical oppression praise be to God now you look at a cup of water and a tin of milk how many does it cost in the U.S today not quite three dollars and then you substitute that for something that would cost ten thousand dollars it doesn't make sense that is what a reward does a reward far outweighs the wage there is nothing that compares to the reward of God whatever your toils are whatever your headaches are whatever your problems are whatever sacrifices you are making for the kingdom of God whatever it is that you are going through to serve God and to live right for God remember there is a reward awaiting you and even the Bible says that if you give a cup of cold water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the reward for you praise be to God there is a reward for it we are not looking forward to what we deserve because what we deserve we don't even like it we don't deserve we don't like what we deserve the musicians can come over we don't we don't like what we deserve we are counting or what God has done we are counting on the reward of the almighty God we are looking up to God the author and the finisher of our faith here is the bigger picture we are looking at and when you keep your focus on the bigger picture and you know it is such you and what you are capable of but it is God and what he has already done there is absolutely no way absolutely no way you are not going to make it right because we know that our God is able [Music] he gave his life for us he died in our place he took upon upon himself our shame and our reproach that we should be a free people there is so Power in the Blood there is still Power in the Blood to set the captives free there is so Power in the Blood to heal Heaven by every manner of sickness to heal any disease it could be spiritual it could be physical there is enough Power in the Blood to change any circumstances keep your eyes where your eyes belong don't look at yourself there is nothing good in a man right that we should be proud of God but when you keep your eyes on God there is no doubt whatsoever that God is going to see you through because he knows when you are dependent on him he knows you're not depending on your abilities he knows you're not depending on your capabilities or what you can do and what you cannot do right if there was anything a man could do then we don't need God praise be to God if there was anything we could do we don't need God but there was nothing we could do and the situation has not changed there is nothing a man can do we only have one way out is to keep our eyes on the bigger picture knowing that the picture is bigger than you there is a purpose in your life God has brought you here to serve his purpose we are not just here to just wonder true just get to the end of life and that is it we are here to serve the purpose of God that God through us will reveal himself to the world we are serving a living God praise be to God [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I would just want us to go into a very short time of prayer [Music] I want us to go before the Lord this morning this afternoon [Music] praise the Lord and to talk to God [Music] the Bible has made it categorically clear now his word will not go out and return unto him void I believe with all my heart that God has spoken I don't know what you are going through I don't know what you are dealing with I don't know the storms that are in your path it is about time that you stopped looking at yourself if you could hurt yourself you would have helped Yourself by now but there is no man that can help himself in any way form or shape that we are all dependent on him and when you keep God before you if you are looking up unto God who is the author and the finisher of our faith he is going to see you three one way or the other and I just want us to pray this morning talk to God talk to God praise be to God talk to God in the name of Jesus shall
