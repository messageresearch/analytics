========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign not contrary to the word you say well I was revealed to me that if it's contrary to the word it never come from God Amen that's right now if you want to take Max Matthew 16 18 Jesus said himself that the entire church his church would be built upon spiritual revelation of himself which is the word I say unto you that thou art Peter and Flesh and Blood never reveal this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock now I know our Catholic friends there you say it was built upon Peter and Peter the apostolic soil so and so on an Apostolic consent uh succession the Protestant said it was built upon Jesus Christ not to be different but take just what he said he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this you and Upon This Rock spiritual revelation of what the word is I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell will never Shake It Down his wife will not be tempted with other man I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell to never shake it and Abel and Cain in the Garden of Eden Cain drawed his own conception he said now look God's a good god he's all over all nature so I'll get the beans and potatoes and I'll get the flowers and I'll make him real pretty altar that's a church he knelt down he believed God he worshiped God put up his hands and offered this sacrifice he done everything religious that Abel did Abel built the same kind of an altar but when Abel brought his he brought a lamb now Cain thought that making an antidote for sin that his father mother must have eat fruit as they were taught in that Garden but Abel by divine revelation know that it was a blood that did it by divine revelation and the Bible said in Hebrews the 12th chapter 11 chapter that Abel by faith Revelation offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice that came by which God testified that he was righteous is that right amen brothers sisters just as plain as anything can be I mean there's the whole thing now on the marriage and divorce it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it but he promised in this last days in this age that every hidden Mystery in the Bible would be redeemed I mean it was at Revelations the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it that all of these hidden mysteries on on marriage and divorce all these other Hidden Mysteries that's been were being revealed in the end time now you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the skies the Seven Angels standing there come back in the opening of The Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true now just a little bit farther but now here I know you took time for you go eat but I'm just eating fine amen notice how the woman's got her place and she is a jewel Solomon this man had had 10 000 wives or had a thousand wise rather he said that a man that's found a wife has found a good team he said a good woman is a jewel in his crown that's an honor but our unrighteous one is water in his blood that's his life he said there might be a one righteous man found in a thousand Solomon said this but said you wouldn't find one righteous woman in a thousand said that now notice that that how it is but you see woman you are you are a jewel if you want to be a jewel but the desire has to be by you and you see while the marriage and divorce was and Jesus pointed back on her it was because your time was the cause of all sin that's the reason polygmy and divorce and things was introduced at the beginning it never was so and it won't be so in the World Over Yonder look at Jacob out of whom come the Patriarchs he had at least a dozen wives he married two sisters and had concubine wise besides that common law women that he lived with and those Patriarchs is born right out of those concubine women is that right amen see you have to make the world run smooth oh I got pages on them if a clergyman ever questions me on it and then we get together we can talk it but surely if he's got any spirituality at all he can see right here it's the truth there's no question to him a good woman is a good thing I know that I know it by real women I've met real women as genuine just as real as any man that ever walked she's a byproduct and a piece of him and in the fall he listened to her and he just she's part of him but it's up to her she's made so she can be filthy and she's given the right to refuse or to accept that's contrary to the original nature that at the beginning see but there you are now it's 12 o'clock so I'll just omit something here for a few minutes I want to ask you something now remember I say this to just my group only and out in the air I'm saying this to only my own followers this message is only to them and what I'm going to say here any Minister that's his sh he's a Shepherd of the flock let him do whatever he wants to that's up to him and God any priest any preacher that's up to you my brother I'm only speaking you're in Jeffersonville the only place I'd speak this at is because it's my own flock it's a flock that the Holy Ghost give me to understand to be overseer over and he'll hold me responsible for it these people of mine's been converts here from across the land that have led to Christ and little children I'm here to help you and I am your friend you might think I'll speak against you I'm saying this to you for your good Ness I love you and if that isn't so God's my judge you know I love you this is an awful strong thing I didn't know how to bring it out what did I do when I got men and women sitting in my congregation someone's been married twice to three times good man and good women all mixed up I've done it false teaching exactly not waiting on the Lord what God has joined together let no man put us and I want man join together what God joined together when you got a direct Revelation from God that's your wife and the same thing that's yours the rest of your life see but what man joins together anybody can put apart but what God joins together no man better dare to touch it whatsoever God joins together said let no man put us under not what some half drunk magistrate or something else put together or some backslidden preacher with a bunch of Creeds and a book that let them do anything in the world the word of God laying right there amen thank you I'm talking about what God joined together now I want to say this to you I'm very careful what I say to you I don't mean to be rough with you three people I don't mean to be rough with you my pastor Brothers I don't mean that but I'm responsible realizing that this has been given into my hands and if I can't hold it I don't know how to give it out and I know that this tape will go oh my I just get rid of the office open up cause here it comes just like it was on the serpent seed but it's absolutely proven to be right I got papers I hear out of paper of women right now and even in in the great some of the great diocese has got the pictures of the original a snake crawling a woman's leg just and how it goes around her she has all kinds of Sensations and things something that a man could never touch her with this huge snake wrapping around her and so forth that's exactly the truth and it's going worse and worse and will get worse serpent which he was not he could not have had the sex affair with her when he was a serpent but remember I was having a debate the other day with a not a debate just a Assembly of God Minister and associate said you're wrong on that I said I may be I'd like for you to tell me he said to anyone he had begin to talk about it first thing you know he got himself lost and one thing he said he said brother Abraham where is that specie God said one of his kind now worry is that specie you said was between man and beasts that science can't find out where is he at said is he on the Earth was he a chimpanzee no because of Japan's blood won't mix with a woman no other animal mixed with her no that water neither will a man spurn uh mixed with a with a female it won't do it then where is that certain animal now God said let everything bring forth of its kind I'll wait it just a minute in the sweetness of the holy spirit said tell him it's here now at first I said well it may become distinct he said but brother Branham that we are talking about the word aren't we I said yes sir and I said the course claimed that the other things like dinosaurs and and Mammoth and so forth mammals mammals rather they're distinct and so forth I said it could have been that he said brother Branham we're talking about proof of the word of sin sure then the original sinner ought to be here also amen and I said Lord Jesus you said take no thought watch you shall say when you come before man because of me given to you in that hour Lord what shall I say he said tell him it's here just the same as C divisions on the platform I set a chair not knowing where he said where and before I could even think he said it's a serpent it's exactly what it was for he's no longer a beast he was cursed and put on his belly for the rest of his days he's here is that right and still in that act that he done that's still the same sin Works around a woman like a male sex like that that's where she has her walleye conditions and things when she has her Sensations far beyond what any man could ever do I'll stop there because we're in a mixed crowd against the man I'll we'll talk more about it got all the papers and things laying around here right at my hand right now now let's go to bring to you this morning let's go take the full day in this but I'll close now I'm saying this this is to my church only the not my church The Little Flock that believes me and follows me this is to them the other day knowing that when I tell you anything it must come thus saith the Lord then I had the scriptures as he revealed it to me but Lord God what can I say to that congregation I'll have separations man will be steady on the porch and out the yard and everywhere else shall I leave her women shall I leave my husband what shall I do I said Lord what can I do something said to me go up yonder in the mountain I'll talk to you and while I was up in the mountain not knowing that down in Tucson they were seeing me but even this teachers call the children from my little girl in them from the school room and said look the internet Mountain there's a fiery looking Amber Cloud going up in the air and coming back down going up in the air coming right now Miss Evans are you here Ronnie you here I come on back down to the station this young boy by The Filling Station at Evans Filling Station there and before I known what the boy was going to say Tuck Me On My Feet you said brother Graham he was up in that mountain over here I said what do you mean Ronnie no see you'll see what he was going to do a lot of times things happen I don't you don't say it to people it becomes the thing of it is you see so much happening becomes common to you see I just don't tell the people I surrounding what was you he said I'm sure you're right where you were at I said I'll call Mama and we stood here and watched that cloud hanging up in here going up and down I said it's got to be Brethren sitting up in there somewhere that's God's helping God and the whole city people looked at it on a bright day with no clouds over it over this big Amber Cloud hanging there coming down like a funneling going back and spreading out foreign friends and then I'm closing you can go from this that's when this was being revealed to me what I'm going to tell you right now so don't miss it now I'm speaking to our followers only who's following me and this message only not the outside bearing me a record of this before God just to this group only now we are found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology is that right that's why you women married a second time in you man because misinterpret theology now I want to show you something that he told me and if God our creator was questioned the question when he was here on Earth Jesus Christ and when he is delivering Prophet came forth Moses down in Egypt to bring the children out of his of Egypt to put him in the Promised Land and Jesus said here that Moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was Moses found such as let him suffer God permitted Moses that prophets sent to the people to Grant this writing of divorcement to him and in First Corinthians the the seventh chapter the 12th and 5th verse in the New Testament prophet Paul who met the same thing in the church and spoke this this is I not the Lord is that right because of the divorce conditions it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and God recognized that righteousness and Paul also had to write when he found his church in that condition now you believe this to be true amen and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message just brought me this far should not guard up on the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer yet to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word let them go on in the eyes they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that is right it wasn't so and it will not be at the end but under moderate conditions as God's servant I won't call myself his Prophet but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be sent for that I'm laying a ground for him when it does come so under the modern conditions I command you to go to your home with your life now if you are happy with her live with her raise your children in the emanation of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring them up in the emanation club and now that you are as you are let us go now to late evening hour that we're living in and press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ for all things will be possible until I see you tonight the Lord God bless you while we pray Lord God we give you thanks we give you praise Thou Art the same great Jehovah that suffered Moses Moors is that servant what would he tell these people and God you suffered him to give a riding of divorcement Paul the great Apostle who was the writer of the New Testament as Moses was of the old Moses wrote the laws and a dispensation of laws May the prophets their words was injected into it but Moses wrote the laws and you suffered him already to write them a writing of divorcement because of the hardness of their heart the great Saint Paul being the writer of the New Testament could also make such an assertion that I speak under these conditions ah not the Lord so is it today Lord God at the end of the world as we're here unto the mercy of God knowing it soon we're to answer in his presence and that you have did so much Lord I'm sure in the sight of these people they'll hang on to this like it come from you and to Bear record year to day of many people sitting here that even saw that sign up in the mountain or the angels of the Lord came in the Whirlwind where it came in the Seven Angels or the revealing other seven Mysteries was unfolded and that same angel in the same direction on the same Mountain the day that this was revealed God I pray that the people who go home being thankful that God has granted this grace to them I only spoke at Lord through permission and I only say it to permission Lord and let the people be so grateful that they'll never try to do that sin again and may they never try to do any sin but love you with all their hearts Lord make these families happy and may they grow and raise their children in the emanation of God for my message it was all my heart is delivered Lord I don't know how to do and Satan has fought me for weeks and hours without sleep but now I've command it Lord to these people that they studied and go and live for you granted lord it's off my shoulders now they're in your hands I pray that you are blessed and bless these handkerchiefs Lord that's just been set on here for this sick and Afflicted may this night be one of the greatest powerful nights that all the people will be healed granted Lord bless us together may we go in peace happy rejoicing because the god of creation has showed us since the beginning and is extended to us and our mess that we're in his grace again in this last days oh great and eternal God how we thank you for it and may our hearts be so happy that we'll never have another desire to sin against you in Jesus name amen I love him why shouldn't you love me [Music] I love him foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I say it now so the ministers understand this is to them that follows this message only oh are you happy I told you the truth thus saith the Lord all the way through now let us stand and raise our hands as we sing it again I love him I love him for his grace I love him for his Mercy I love him for his word and the word of the Lord came to the prophets [Music] ah [Music] come on brother [Music] foreign [Music]
