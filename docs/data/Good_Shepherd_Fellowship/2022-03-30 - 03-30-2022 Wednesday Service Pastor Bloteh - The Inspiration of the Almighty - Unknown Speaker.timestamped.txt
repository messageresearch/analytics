[37:40] saw the
[37:42] follow
[37:43] the service
[37:46] wins on sunday
[37:48] but then speaking on trust
[37:50] trusting the lord
[37:52] uh
[37:54] even when it is the difficult thing to
[37:56] do
[37:57] and as i was listening to the other i
[38:00] just thought i said well i mean trusting
[38:02] god is is
[38:04] is
[38:05] a difficult thing to do
[38:07] praise the lord
[38:10] it's not it's not
[38:11] as is not easy
[38:16] that
[38:17] we have to trust him when it's difficult
[38:19] to trust him
[38:21] i believe
[38:22] that
[38:24] [Music]
[38:25] the scripture says his mercy
[38:28] is renewed every morning
[38:31] and
[38:34] the renewing of god's mercy
[38:37] unto us
[38:39] god renewed his mercy
[38:43] for us to trust him
[38:45] and he gave us different opportunity
[38:48] every day if you if you just if you just
[38:50] observe the dealing of the law with you
[38:53] you realize
[38:54] that god will give us different
[38:56] opportunity
[38:58] to see how much we trust him
[39:01] praise the lord
[39:03] amen
[39:04] and it's it's strange because i was i
[39:07] was studying
[39:08] on the
[39:10] on the weekend
[39:12] speaking there in dc
[39:15] uh actually
[39:16] was uh uh
[39:19] speaking a little bit on on
[39:21] leadership
[39:23] but i was taking uh
[39:26] jaitum parable
[39:28] in the book of george's
[39:30] spoke on that year a long time many
[39:33] years ago
[39:34] but jaton parable after his brother
[39:37] abimelech
[39:39] killed all the sons of jeruba which is
[39:42] gideon
[39:44] and
[39:45] a little jaitan was able to escape
[39:48] and then he went on the hill
[39:51] and he yelled down to the people and
[39:53] shashi
[39:55] and he said
[39:58] the trees went out
[40:03] to
[40:05] find a leader
[40:09] and they went to the olive tree
[40:12] and says come and rule over us
[40:15] praise the lord
[40:16] that's georges chapter nine maybe you
[40:19] can read that when you get home
[40:21] come and root over us
[40:23] and uh and and and the olive tree said
[40:27] uh no i don't want to leave uh
[40:30] my service to god and my service to men
[40:34] you'll find that in the in the in the
[40:36] parable of jaden it was it was very very
[40:39] amazing to to see that
[40:41] and then they went also over to the uh
[40:45] to the fig tree
[40:48] and uh and the factory signal no
[40:52] yeah i don't want to lose my sweetness
[40:55] then the trees went to
[40:58] to the vine
[41:00] and the vine says what i know i'm
[41:02] serviceable to god i'm serviceable to
[41:05] man
[41:06] and then the trees went to the brom bomb
[41:11] and the brown bone says well
[41:14] if you will want me to rule over you
[41:16] then you will have to trust
[41:19] so i was actually studying on the word
[41:21] trust
[41:22] you have to trust honor mine my wings
[41:27] you have to trust yourself to me
[41:30] but the the amazing thing there is that
[41:33] the brown bone does not have
[41:35] no
[41:36] shade
[41:38] because it's a tongue tree it's just cut
[41:41] all over the place you know it don't
[41:43] have no shade
[41:45] but yet it's asking the rest of the
[41:49] trees
[41:50] to trust
[41:52] themselves on him
[41:54] and and and that world trust
[41:59] is uh
[42:00] uh um it has a characteristics
[42:04] in the in the old testament
[42:09] is used is used many times in in many
[42:12] places trust in the law with all your
[42:14] heart lean on to your own understanding
[42:16] laying that on to your own understanding
[42:19] and it's it's used but there are four
[42:23] words that are that are used yet over in
[42:26] uh
[42:27] ruth chapter 2
[42:30] verse 12
[42:32] the word trust
[42:34] is is used
[42:38] to find refuge
[42:40] praise the lord i read it in that
[42:43] wrote two scriptures down so let me just
[42:46] look at it quickly i will just
[42:49] read in there
[42:52] so let me just look at it quickly
[42:54] tonight
[43:06] and we have to remember i mean
[43:09] every day
[43:10] you know whether it's going to be
[43:13] because of
[43:14] of
[43:15] of finance or is going to be because of
[43:18] a job what is going to be because of
[43:20] whatever
[43:22] the law want us to trust him
[43:26] everything that we are experiencing in
[43:28] our life sometimes
[43:30] uh
[43:31] you know we
[43:33] we
[43:34] we turn
[43:35] to make
[43:37] our daily life we turn to think that we
[43:40] having a separate christian life
[43:44] from
[43:45] our
[43:46] our natural or our normal life
[43:50] every part of our life the brother
[43:52] branham says god is interested in the
[43:55] least things that concern us
[43:58] praise the lord

[52:00] ground
[52:01] and took up her son
[52:03] and went out

[52:07] heavenly father
[52:08] dear lord
[52:10] it's been a while lord we have we have
[52:12] endured
[52:13] on this
[52:14] chapter of the bible

[52:18] because we see
[52:20] uh
[52:21] a type year
[52:23] and in in the scripture father god word
[52:26] and we believe we are living in in such
[52:28] a time lord father where the the bride
[52:32] of jesus christ this gentile bride
[52:35] that this woman this shaming a woman
[52:37] type in the bible
[52:39] father lord god we believe this is our
[52:42] our lord our time
[52:43] where this church lord father this bride
[52:46] must be living by the breath of god this
[52:49] church must be living honor the spirit
[52:52] of inspiration lord not living by our
[52:55] own thoughts oh god father and what we
[52:58] think and what we feel and we feel like
[53:00] and we don't feel like but god father is
[53:03] the our lord god where the people of god
[53:07] must be driven by the spirit of
[53:09] inspiration because it's the breath of
[53:11] god it's the life of god that dwell in
[53:14] us so father just like the old god
[53:17] father lord is written in your word in
[53:20] you we move we breathe and we have our
[53:23] being so we ask tonight lord come come
[53:26] and just take lord father this portion
[53:28] of the word

[53:39] spirit will have us to say so lord just
[53:42] come or father as you blessing your
[53:44] people around the world remember us lord
[53:47] father meteors are the very point of our
[53:49] spiritual needs physical needs health
[53:52] wise as well in jesus name we pray
[53:55] amen
[53:57] amen the lord bless you you may have
[53:58] your seed
[54:00] praise the lord
[54:02] amen
[54:03] praise the lord
[54:07] praise the lord
[54:11] amen so just just like uh uh we was
[54:15] sharing with you a little bit we were
[54:17] talking
[54:18] there the uh fellowshipping with the
[54:21] saints
[54:22] and we were we were speaking on
[54:24] leadership that way
[54:26] and uh uh so we took those four trees
[54:30] uh and and and if you realize and you go
[54:34] back and read the scripture
[54:36] you will see that uh each one of those
[54:39] trees
[54:40] the the olive tree
[54:42] the fig tree the involuntary in first
[54:45] instance all of those tree has
[54:48] very significance to israel
[54:50] and and and they also have significance
[54:53] to to to the people to the people of god
[54:58] and uh
[54:59] [Music]
[55:03] but what what uh
[55:05] what caught my attention
[55:07] uh as as i was as i was studying uh and
[55:11] reading the edits that
[55:13] all of those trees were able to identify
[55:16] that they have a service to god
[55:20] and to man
[55:22] praise the lord it's very beautiful
[55:25] because most of the time
[55:28] we think about serving god and we want
[55:30] to be a service to god and and and
[55:33] sometimes we think uh uh is is you know
[55:37] is is by preaching to the people it's
[55:39] all part of faith and we think you know
[55:42] uh is is uh is by just breaking in the
[55:45] spirit and doing all of these spiritual
[55:47] things but you will realize that
[55:51] every true service to god is to his
[55:53] people
[55:55] praise the lord brother branham says
[55:58] when we self humanity
[56:00] spoken word is the original seed he says
[56:02] you are serving god
[56:04] any service to humanity
[56:06] is a service to god
[56:09] praise the lord
[56:10] can you imagine how many people
[56:13] have the
[56:14] opportunity to serve all of those
[56:17] refugees that are running from ukraine
[56:20] people open their homes
[56:22] people try to bring them water
[56:25] and and all of that
[56:27] and and and these are some of the things
[56:30] since of god
[56:31] you think about
[56:33] some of the things that we gave
[56:36] some people internal reward
[56:42] praise the lord we're thinking about the
[56:44] service of god we think about great
[56:47] missionary work there are people that
[56:49] are called to do that
[56:51] like this brother i was talking about
[56:52] brother robert wilson he's like a kind
[56:54] of a one-man army
[56:56] you know he he raised his own funds and
[56:59] then he goes to parts of the world
[57:02] where there is really not not really the
[57:04] message church is
[57:06] and he goes there and try to work he
[57:08] goes to other places where they are
[57:10] message church put them together
[57:12] you know encourage the pastor
[57:14] you know feed the people
[57:16] for for for
[57:19] uh
[57:20] three service uh a weekend friday
[57:22] saturday sunday night and you know and
[57:25] all of that
[57:26] and you know and people do different
[57:29] things
[57:30] but just just think out of the box
[57:34] of
[57:35] uh
[57:36] church service
[57:37] preaching the word
[57:39] or
[57:40] giving out tracts
[57:42] you know there are people
[57:44] that will be blessed with internal
[57:47] reward
[57:49] because
[57:50] of their service
[57:52] to humanity
[57:55] praise the lord
[57:58] and uh you know i think about those
[58:01] things
[58:02] uh you know think about it and just
[58:05] and just sometimes become emotional
[58:08] when i watch all the different things
[58:10] that are happening there praise the lord
[58:13] amen
[58:16] glory be to god
[58:19] so that's that was the thing that caught
[58:21] my attention on that scripture
[58:24] that parable of jolting
[58:25] you know the trees
[58:27] wanting a ruler over them
[58:30] but yet
[58:31] the one that
[58:34] you know that wanted to do the work or
[58:36] that thing that he was qualified the
[58:38] brown bone he don't the brow bone don't
[58:41] bear no fruit
[58:43] they don't have a fruit
[58:46] like i said they don't even have a shade
[58:50] you know brother branham
[58:51] restoration is the bright tree of the
[58:53] bride tree he said the shade is for
[58:55] fellowship
[58:56] you know so the brown bone don't even
[58:58] have that it's just only good for
[59:00] destruction
[59:03] only good for fire
[59:05] yes
[59:06] and that's exactly what jacob said to
[59:08] them
[59:10] the brown bone said trust yourself honor
[59:12] me
[59:13] praise the lord
[59:15] amen
[59:16] he says and then if if you if you break
[59:18] that trust i will burn you
[59:22] i would turn the whole city on on fire
[59:26] that was exactly what
[59:28] uh uh abimelech did
[59:31] uh
[59:33] but then there was there was another
[59:34] beautiful piece in that scripture
[59:37] uh and the beautiful piece was
[59:40] it took
[59:42] a little woman
[59:45] the bible did not even give us her name
[59:50] it took a little woman
[59:52] to bring an end
[59:56] to to to the foolishness of abimelech
[1:00:00] kill all his brothers just because of
[1:00:02] power
[1:00:05] force himself on the people of shashin
[1:00:07] with with uh with uh with political
[1:00:10] talks
[1:00:14] but it took a little woman
[1:00:18] the bible says she took a stone
[1:00:25] he was a feminine david
[1:00:28] she took a stone
[1:00:30] and broke the score of abimelech
[1:00:36] praise the lord
[1:00:39] so
[1:00:41] we were
[1:00:42] talking
[1:00:43] speaking about god
[1:00:46] is never without a witness
[1:00:50] he's never without a witness
[1:00:53] he will use strange people
[1:00:57] in difficult times
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:02] praise the lord
[1:01:03] he will use strange people
[1:01:05] in difficult times
[1:01:08] and i believe that god has called us
[1:01:11] each and every one of us
[1:01:13] for us to be vessels of honor
[1:01:16] he have called us for us to be vessels
[1:01:18] that he can use
[1:01:20] and you know the amazing thing about god
[1:01:22] he don't put you on schedule
[1:01:24] just like your work will put you on
[1:01:26] schedule
[1:01:28] he wants you to be available
[1:01:31] he wants you to be available
[1:01:36] for any given time
[1:01:39] praise the lord
[1:01:42] and like the prophet of god said he says
[1:01:44] when when you are available
[1:01:48] at a time
[1:01:49] that god wants to use you when you are
[1:01:52] available for a divine movement
[1:01:56] but better in the message he says it is
[1:01:59] just like
[1:02:00] eating
[1:02:01] honey
[1:02:03] from the skull of a lion
[1:02:07] when you know that
[1:02:09] you have just done something
[1:02:12] it was the right thing you were at the
[1:02:15] right place at the right time
[1:02:18] he says it the feeling is just like
[1:02:22] eating honey
[1:02:24] out of the squad of a lion
[1:02:27] that was what samson did he killed the
[1:02:29] lion and went his way
[1:02:32] and the bees came and make honey right
[1:02:34] in the skull of the lion
[1:02:36] at the time he was hungry
[1:02:38] the very lion he killed was able to
[1:02:41] provide food for him
[1:02:47] and the prophet also says
[1:02:50] when you just realize
[1:02:53] that you have missed it
[1:02:54] he said what a horrible feeling
[1:02:58] when you just realize that god has given
[1:03:00] you an opportunity
[1:03:03] to be a blessing
[1:03:04] an opportunity to be a witness
[1:03:07] and you blew it
[1:03:09] he says what a horrible
[1:03:12] feeling yes
[1:03:16] praise the lord
[1:03:18] i wish i was in poland to run to the
[1:03:21] border i know what it is because i've
[1:03:23] been in the world zone before
[1:03:25] so but i'm not there i'm right here in
[1:03:28] minneapolis
[1:03:30] i have to watch out what is going to be
[1:03:33] my own opportunity
[1:03:35] i have to watch out
[1:03:38] i have to be
[1:03:40] very sensitive
[1:03:42] praise the lord is when you have come to
[1:03:45] the place to live
[1:03:52] a life
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:54] god
[1:03:56] has delivered you a little bit from
[1:03:58] selfishness
[1:04:00] some of the the reason why we miss those
[1:04:02] opportunities because we go the whole
[1:04:05] day
[1:04:06] thinking about one person
[1:04:08] safe
[1:04:10] how am i going to do this how am i going
[1:04:13] to do dad how am i going to do and then
[1:04:16] sometimes we just walk right past
[1:04:19] an opportunity
[1:04:21] that will have made the father to say
[1:04:23] yes my boy
[1:04:30] selfishness can imprison you
[1:04:39] so that was one of the one of the things
[1:04:41] i drove from that scripture
[1:04:44] out of those trees
[1:04:46] they have quality in them
[1:04:48] to save
[1:04:50] god
[1:04:51] and to save
[1:04:52] man but that's not what i'm preaching on
[1:04:55] tonight
[1:04:57] that's not what i'm preaching on tonight
[1:05:02] praise the lord
[1:05:04] exodus 21
[1:05:07] exodus chapter 21 let's read verse one
[1:05:13] praise the lord
[1:05:17] exodus chapter 21 let's read verse one
[1:05:21] it's just a prayer night
[1:05:23] good to see you brother joel
[1:05:27] uh how was your drive down to iowa
[1:05:31] i mean it was good praise the lord
[1:05:33] praise the lord
[1:05:36] praise lord
[1:05:38] exodus chapter 21
[1:05:41] let's read verse one
[1:05:50] did i say 21
[1:05:52] no 22.
[1:05:58] exodus 22.
[1:06:08] exodus 22 verse 1
[1:06:10] if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep
[1:06:15] and kill it listen very closely now
[1:06:20] this is a commandment of the lord you
[1:06:22] got to listen very closely
[1:06:26] if a man shall steal
[1:06:28] an ox or a sheep
[1:06:31] and kill it
[1:06:33] or sell it
[1:06:35] he shall restore
[1:06:39] five oxen for an ox if he's an ox
[1:06:43] he should he must restore five
[1:06:47] praise the lord
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] and if you even read down
[1:06:53] you realize that if the man is caught
[1:06:57] then he have to double pay
[1:07:00] if he's caught
[1:07:01] stealing
[1:07:03] yeah
[1:07:04] praise the lord
[1:07:06] but let's let's stay with this
[1:07:09] and four sheep
[1:07:12] for
[1:07:13] a sheep
[1:07:15] praise the lord
[1:07:17] he must
[1:07:19] restore
[1:07:20] if he's an oxen
[1:07:22] on an ox that he's told he must he must
[1:07:25] restore five
[1:07:27] but if he's a sheep he must
[1:07:29] restore
[1:07:30] fall
[1:07:31] praise the lord
[1:07:33] and we can say this is doubt said the
[1:07:35] lord
[1:07:37] because this is this is an instruction
[1:07:40] from the prophet moses
[1:07:43] praise the lord
[1:07:44] but then you'll realize that
[1:07:48] when
[1:07:49] david was in his ordeal
[1:07:52] the the beautiful thing there is that
[1:07:55] when when
[1:07:56] when uh when uriah's died
[1:08:00] in uh second samuel 11 when uriah's died
[1:08:05] and job sent a message
[1:08:08] to david you know what he told david
[1:08:12] he reminded david
[1:08:14] about the woman
[1:08:16] that killed abimelech
[1:08:20] it's amazing
[1:08:23] it's amazing
[1:08:26] that's not what i'm talking about
[1:08:27] tonight let me stay let me stay on this
[1:08:30] it's amazing that he reminded david he
[1:08:33] said go and tell david
[1:08:36] we have lost the world
[1:08:38] he and if he asks you
[1:08:40] how did this happen
[1:08:43] say to him was it not a woman
[1:08:53] well let's stay right here now so when
[1:08:55] david got into his problem
[1:08:58] the prophet netan
[1:09:01] received a word from the lord
[1:09:04] to go and talk to david
[1:09:07] so nathan the prophet
[1:09:10] got on his way
[1:09:13] maybe he took a straw and under his arm
[1:09:15] and he was walking and everybody knew
[1:09:18] when they saw the prophet coming they
[1:09:20] knew that
[1:09:21] this was serious
[1:09:24] and when nelton got there to david
[1:09:30] he said king i'm here to see you
[1:09:35] the king said you can have your seat
[1:09:38] abil i sure believe that david was
[1:09:40] trouble
[1:09:42] because he have seen the prophet
[1:09:46] he says i have a problem in uh he says
[1:09:50] there is a problem in this kingdom
[1:09:53] and and david says what is said
[1:09:56] and nathan said
[1:10:00] there is a poor man
[1:10:03] that have one sheep
[1:10:06] now so what the prophet mitten is doing
[1:10:09] by inspiration
[1:10:11] he's taking what the prophet moses said
[1:10:16] praise the lord
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:18] he's taking exodus 22
[1:10:21] the entire story that nelton bill
[1:10:25] told david was exodus 22 verse 1.
[1:10:29] sure
[1:10:31] are we together
[1:10:33] so he's taking their honor inspiration
[1:10:37] to be able to draw
[1:10:42] to be able to capture
[1:10:46] david
[1:10:49] praise the lord
[1:10:51] now being the prophet and whatever the
[1:10:54] lord has revealed to him yes yeah my my
[1:10:57] seven has done wrong he he has killed
[1:10:59] you riots and then and and then go on to
[1:11:02] him and you know and and here is nathan
[1:11:04] here using the very words of the prophet
[1:11:07] moses and what he's doing is that he's
[1:11:09] going to preach preach a message honor
[1:11:12] inspiration but he going to dramatize it
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:19] he's going to dramatize it in a way
[1:11:22] where david will feel comfortable to
[1:11:24] even say amen
[1:11:29] praise the lord
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:32] you know you hear those people preach it
[1:11:35] sometimes it's just on a guilt
[1:11:44] sometimes it's just on a guilt
[1:11:48] so uh uh a net one year now he says
[1:11:52] there is there is a rich man in it and
[1:11:55] and there's a paul manning and he takes
[1:11:57] the the poor man only
[1:11:59] sheep on the line he had
[1:12:04] praise the lord
[1:12:06] and as he's saying that david is getting
[1:12:08] off of his sh off of his seat he's not
[1:12:11] captured by what nathan is telling him
[1:12:16] but what was
[1:12:19] the prophet nathan doing he was under
[1:12:21] inspiration
[1:12:24] to be able to bring
[1:12:26] david to a conviction
[1:12:29] and he was going to use the word of the
[1:12:32] lord to breathe
[1:12:34] life into david dead body because david
[1:12:37] was dead
[1:12:40] because that's why he said the men have
[1:12:42] done this
[1:12:43] that man should die
[1:12:52] that's what inspiration is
[1:12:54] is the breath of god
[1:12:58] it's the breath
[1:12:59] of god
[1:13:07] praise the lord
[1:13:14] david stood up
[1:13:17] pre-checked
[1:13:18] the man i've done it that man was died
[1:13:21] and nathan said
[1:13:23] you are the man
[1:13:30] praise the lord
[1:13:32] he said you are the man
[1:13:40] glory be to god
[1:13:44] can you imagine where david was
[1:13:49] after hearing the prophet saying you are
[1:13:52] the man
[1:14:01] and if you you even read the scripture
[1:14:03] there in the in uh
[1:14:04] in chapter 12 you'll realize david said
[1:14:07] the man that have done this must restore
[1:14:11] fall forth
[1:14:15] he asked that the man should die
[1:14:18] and he also asked that the man should
[1:14:21] restore because he knew what the law
[1:14:23] says
[1:14:26] he knew what the court of of of uh
[1:14:30] of uh of moses said right
[1:14:34] praise the lord
[1:14:36] and i i i can show you different places
[1:14:39] in the scripture where this play out
[1:14:42] but what i want to bring you to is the
[1:14:44] other
[1:14:46] you see
[1:14:48] the bible says
[1:14:51] there is no scripture
[1:14:53] that is written
[1:14:55] you know by
[1:14:57] by private interpretation
[1:15:01] amen
[1:15:05] no scripture is written by private
[1:15:06] interpretation
[1:15:09] that's what that's what the scripture
[1:15:10] says
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:15] holy men were inspired
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:20] they were inspired
[1:15:22] i want to get this get this right so
[1:15:24] read it to you all scriptures are given
[1:15:28] by inspiration of god
[1:15:30] and it's profitable for doctrine
[1:15:34] and we said doctrine
[1:15:35] is what is right
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:40] is profitable for reproof
[1:15:44] all scripture
[1:15:45] is profitable
[1:15:48] to help you
[1:15:54] and is profitable for reproof what is
[1:15:56] not right
[1:15:59] praise the lord
[1:16:01] is profitable for correction
[1:16:03] how to get it right
[1:16:06] an instruction how to stay right
[1:16:09] yes
[1:16:11] that's what god gave his word for
[1:16:14] but it's the breath of god that's what
[1:16:16] inspiration is the word inspiration
[1:16:18] means the breath of god
[1:16:20] we we read
[1:16:22] uh
[1:16:23] brother branham on there
[1:16:25] if i can be able to just
[1:16:28] drop back it a little bit
[1:16:30] and when we start this blasphemer name
[1:16:33] the church
[1:16:34] is a mystical body born by the breath of
[1:16:37] god
[1:16:38] did you get it the church of god is born
[1:16:41] by the breath of god
[1:16:45] uh
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:48] god
[1:16:49] breathed
[1:16:51] into the nostril spiritually
[1:16:56] of adam
[1:16:57] and he became a living soul
[1:17:01] did you know
[1:17:03] the pentecostal the true pentecostal
[1:17:05] church was born by the breath of god
[1:17:07] when that when that uh
[1:17:10] wind blew into the upper room
[1:17:13] amen yes
[1:17:16] when you know that the mighty wing that
[1:17:18] came into the opera room that's what
[1:17:20] brother branham is referring to
[1:17:22] now you you can think about it those
[1:17:24] people they were all scared to death
[1:17:28] because uh uh uh uh the the pharisees
[1:17:32] the sahendra's council has already make
[1:17:34] a plan and wrote a story in the
[1:17:36] newspaper that they have stolen the body
[1:17:39] of jesus christ to be able to prove the
[1:17:41] claim that he was raising from the dead
[1:17:44] right
[1:17:46] praise the lord
[1:17:48] so i believe they were looking at the
[1:17:50] case so uh you know to be able to judge
[1:17:52] it and then pretty soon they will start
[1:17:54] arresting those disciples they were all
[1:17:56] you know in the upper room waiting on
[1:17:58] the promise but it was scared to death
[1:18:00] but what happened
[1:18:02] when their mighty rushing wind came
[1:18:04] right into the upper room and breathed
[1:18:07] upon them
[1:18:08] the bible said brother brown said peter
[1:18:10] took a soapbox the man i was a friend
[1:18:13] and i was denying jesus i don't even
[1:18:15] know him he took a soap bus right in the
[1:18:18] middle of town
[1:18:23] praise the lord
[1:18:24] so you see that the breath of god took
[1:18:27] him from fear
[1:18:30] blew all his fear away
[1:18:33] amen he's not ashamed to testify that
[1:18:35] i'm a believer i'm a christian i can't
[1:18:38] do this i you know he's not he's not
[1:18:40] afraid
[1:18:45] praise the lord
[1:18:47] that's what the inspiration of the
[1:18:50] almighty will do
[1:18:54] praise the lord you know you know you
[1:18:56] know at what time the church you you
[1:18:59] look through church history and you look
[1:19:01] through the scripture you see it all the
[1:19:03] time
[1:19:06] it have been in desperate moment brother
[1:19:09] branham said uh uh you bear with me
[1:19:12] tonight uh
[1:19:13] i'm just i'm running back from one one
[1:19:16] thing one to another so
[1:19:18] uh i might not have things up there for
[1:19:20] you tonight but says look in spiritual
[1:19:23] inspiration he says look i'm trying to
[1:19:25] say
[1:19:26] that the woman was inspired
[1:19:30] and inspired people
[1:19:33] through all ages are strange to the
[1:19:36] world
[1:19:38] but
[1:19:39] they are always doing
[1:19:42] god's will
[1:19:44] it was a strange thing
[1:19:47] that paul taking handshakes off of his
[1:19:50] body in april
[1:19:52] and send them to sick and afflicted
[1:19:54] people now so you see it's not something
[1:19:57] that is premeditated
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:01] inspiration is not something that it
[1:20:03] that is premeditated it's something that
[1:20:06] strucks you from the inside and when it
[1:20:09] strikes you it takes over your being
[1:20:13] praise the lord
[1:20:14] david going to meet goliath it was not
[1:20:18] premeditated because he went to take
[1:20:20] food to his brothers
[1:20:22] but when he heard he heard goliath
[1:20:27] bringing an insult on the living god
[1:20:31] praise the lord
[1:20:32] it just overtook him
[1:20:34] and you see that little boy
[1:20:37] running out there there looking for
[1:20:39] rocking and running out it was
[1:20:41] inspiration
[1:20:43] it was not it was not all he had a
[1:20:46] testimony
[1:20:47] how he killed a lion he had a testimony
[1:20:50] of how he came to bed but that moment
[1:20:52] was not a moment that he prepared for
[1:20:57] it was inspiration that took him
[1:21:01] praise the lord
[1:21:04] for him to go and face the giant of
[1:21:06] their day
[1:21:08] a man that was well trained
[1:21:14] praise the lord
[1:21:16] so you see
[1:21:17] inspiration has always
[1:21:21] has always possessed the church
[1:21:24] in a time where you don't think about it
[1:21:30] you don't plan for it
[1:21:33] praise the lord
[1:21:35] look at the shimmy now woman
[1:21:37] she was just about to enjoy her son
[1:21:40] after she had waited for him many years
[1:21:42] and then you know on on the field and
[1:21:44] and and all of that and i mean the boys
[1:21:47] say oh my head my head come and come
[1:21:49] junior come and sit on my leg right
[1:21:51] there the ball die
[1:21:53] so right in that
[1:21:54] moment in that dying movement now the
[1:21:58] reason why this is important or uh i'm
[1:22:02] kind of for lingering on this is because
[1:22:04] i believe that uh
[1:22:07] you know i believe the church i believe
[1:22:09] the bride is moving right into that hour
[1:22:13] praise the lord
[1:22:15] after coming from under you know a
[1:22:18] global coronavirus uh you know a time
[1:22:22] and you know in in in people
[1:22:26] locked down and you know and you know
[1:22:28] and people started building different
[1:22:30] theory in their mind michael the beast
[1:22:32] all sorts of things
[1:22:35] praise the lord
[1:22:39] and we know that it's not the end to it
[1:22:44] we are living in a world where we we
[1:22:46] we are going from one worst situation to
[1:22:48] another worse
[1:22:50] we have not even taken the marks off of
[1:22:52] our face larry's russia uh uh uh uh uh
[1:22:55] bombing ukraine we'll know what next
[1:22:57] will happen
[1:23:01] praise the lord
[1:23:03] you see and that's the reason why
[1:23:05] in this
[1:23:06] unexpected moment
[1:23:12] praise the lord
[1:23:13] in this unexpected moment
[1:23:16] look at israel
[1:23:19] before the red sea
[1:23:23] and behind them they can see the dust of
[1:23:25] the egyptian cherish in the air
[1:23:30] praise the lord
[1:23:32] amen
[1:23:35] mountains on both sides
[1:23:40] glory be to god
[1:23:43] you see that's the reason why as a
[1:23:45] believer you have to you have we have to
[1:23:47] make sure that that channel
[1:23:49] is clean
[1:23:52] that there is nothing that is stuck in
[1:23:54] that channel
[1:23:56] because it's not when you get to that
[1:23:58] desk oh lord god forgive me my sin oh
[1:24:00] jesus christ oh how can i meet the
[1:24:03] sister to make things right how can i
[1:24:04] meet this brother to make things right
[1:24:07] that's just that just a religious spirit
[1:24:13] we must live every day right with god
[1:24:22] if the sun should not go down on your
[1:24:24] anger
[1:24:25] the sun should not go down
[1:24:27] when you realize that you have
[1:24:28] displeased the lord
[1:24:35] the mountains on both sides rescue
[1:24:37] before them
[1:24:38] and they can see the egyptian
[1:24:40] terror they can see the dust coming
[1:24:45] and the people
[1:24:46] oh uh uh all of those men that's why we
[1:24:49] were saying leave us in egypt why you
[1:24:51] brought us down here i mean they were
[1:24:53] seeing their death
[1:24:56] in that in that state of confusion
[1:25:01] moses under inspiration said the
[1:25:03] egyptian you see today
[1:25:05] you will see them no more forever
[1:25:08] how it will happen he didn't know
[1:25:11] but on her inspiration he said the
[1:25:14] egyptian you see today
[1:25:16] you will see them no more
[1:25:19] that's what happened
[1:25:21] because when you have that channel you
[1:25:23] allow god to breathe
[1:25:27] when god speaks to you you can inhale it
[1:25:33] praise the lord and then you can exhale
[1:25:35] it again
[1:25:36] you are not afraid
[1:25:38] to express it because you know
[1:25:41] that's god's word
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:50] the inspiration
[1:25:53] the almighty
[1:25:55] job said that's what gives wisdom
[1:26:00] the inspiration of the almighty
[1:26:03] give it wisdom
[1:26:08] praise the lord
[1:26:12] look through the bible
[1:26:15] look at when joshua says son standstill
[1:26:18] that was not a premeditated thing he had
[1:26:22] a life of these people on his hands
[1:26:29] they were not playing games it was not
[1:26:31] high and sick they were playing
[1:26:36] they were fighting the battle
[1:26:40] praise the lord
[1:26:42] and when he had gone down the road
[1:26:45] that uh
[1:26:48] not a place that he has that he was
[1:26:50] familiar with
[1:26:52] he needed a son
[1:26:56] to be in that position to make sure that
[1:26:59] we finish with this battle
[1:27:02] praise the lord
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:07] you know what it was going to be if
[1:27:09] joshua would have just gone there and
[1:27:10] says hey
[1:27:12] kill it
[1:27:13] and uh joseph you're coming home my
[1:27:16] hands up you remember what we did for
[1:27:18] moses yo you're coming home my hands up

[1:27:28] god don't back impersonation
[1:27:32] see you're coming hold my hands up you
[1:27:34] you remember when we had moses hands on
[1:27:36] and we won up no
[1:27:40] he was right in the fight
[1:27:43] with his sword drawn
[1:27:48] he was ready for for business he was in
[1:27:50] the fight

[1:28:19] me see if he's standing no he just said
[1:28:22] it and went straight to work
[1:28:28] he said it and went straight to work
[1:28:32] but brahms said you don't put the c
[1:28:34] there and go deacon says is it is he has
[1:28:36] it gemmatized yet
[1:28:43] some of our attitudes are the greater
[1:28:45] hindrance to our prayers
[1:28:48] because we don't trust the one we are
[1:28:50] talking to
[1:28:51] if you trust him you give it to him
[1:28:54] he never even said give it he said
[1:28:56] cassid

[1:31:24] i pray that the holy spirit will be able
[1:31:25] to make this thing more clear to you
[1:31:28] a girl will be able to deal with you in
[1:31:30] a special way
[1:31:32] and make you to realize how much
[1:31:35] we need inspiration
[1:31:38] you know like uh uh
[1:31:40] you know but i remember dan talking
[1:31:43] about you know how much
[1:31:45] the breath that we breathe is important
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:55] ezekiel chapter 2 let's look at this
[1:31:56] principle as a principle here i want for
[1:31:59] us to look at
[1:32:00] verse 1
[1:32:02] and he said unto men son of man
[1:32:05] stand upon thy feet
[1:32:08] and i will speak on today
[1:32:13] and their spirit entered me
[1:32:16] when he speak unto me
[1:32:19] and set me upon my feet
[1:32:22] that i heard him that speak unto me
[1:32:27] do you see the principle there
[1:32:32] there's a principle
[1:32:33] god is speaking to ezekiel
[1:32:36] and asking him
[1:32:38] stand on your feet
[1:32:40] so i can speak to you
[1:32:42] praise the lord
[1:32:44] amen
[1:32:45] now if you take there you will think
[1:32:48] that
[1:32:49] it sounds like a command
[1:32:52] sure
[1:32:54] amen it sounds like he's giving ezekiel
[1:32:57] a comment still on your feet
[1:32:59] so i can speak today
[1:33:02] but as god is saying that the very
[1:33:05] command
[1:33:06] now became the thing that took ezekiel
[1:33:09] on his feet
[1:33:14] he then now obey that command by himself
[1:33:18] but the word that spoke unto him
[1:33:21] woke him up
[1:33:24] [Laughter]
[1:33:26] praise the lord
[1:33:27] you know it says just like jesus saying
[1:33:30] to the woman
[1:33:31] cut in adultery
[1:33:34] go and sing no more it was not a command
[1:33:38] he was not giving her a command he was
[1:33:41] telling her of the present state of her
[1:33:44] life
[1:33:47] neither do i condemn thee
[1:33:49] go and sing no more
[1:33:53] it does not don't it does not mean don't
[1:33:55] do it again
[1:33:57] it means that you will not do it again
[1:34:04] oh praise the lord you see and that is
[1:34:07] the place where people struggle they
[1:34:10] think that brother branham the message
[1:34:12] has brought a lot of law all the message
[1:34:15] said this all the message says that
[1:34:18] walk in the light
[1:34:20] and more will unfold
[1:34:26] praise the lord
[1:34:29] did you grab the principle
[1:34:31] let's read that again
[1:34:33] i think i'm almost time here to close
[1:34:36] let's read that again
[1:34:41] he said unto me
[1:34:44] son of man
[1:34:46] stand upon thy feet
[1:34:49] and i will speak
[1:34:51] unto thee
[1:34:55] and the spirit enter into me
[1:34:58] when he speak unto me
[1:35:02] as he was speaking unto me
[1:35:04] the breath of god
[1:35:06] entered into me
[1:35:08] as he was speaking and i was hearing him
[1:35:12] the breath of god entered into me
[1:35:16] and put me on my feet
[1:35:20] praise the lord
[1:35:22] amen everything that god has said in his
[1:35:25] word
[1:35:26] his spirit followed it to bring it to
[1:35:28] pass
[1:35:29] [Music]
[1:35:31] with your seat with our sinful nature
[1:35:34] there is no way we can practice the word
[1:35:36] of god or the lord of god to get it
[1:35:39] right
[1:35:43] oh that's why the prophet isaiah said
[1:35:45] his word do not go out and return back
[1:35:49] to him vow the spirit follow the word
[1:35:53] to bring it to pass
[1:35:59] but why why why do the world don't come
[1:36:01] to pass is because you are trying to
[1:36:04] hemoprocess the word
[1:36:06] when you try to process the word humanly
[1:36:09] you are hybrid in the world
[1:36:12] you are not supposed to process it law
[1:36:15] how is it going to happen oh yeah no
[1:36:19] glory be to god
[1:36:32] and the spirit entered into me
[1:36:34] when he speak unto me
[1:36:37] and set me upon my feet it was the
[1:36:39] spirit
[1:36:41] that was obeying what god said
[1:36:46] the spirit woke him up
[1:36:49] as i was hearing the word
[1:36:54] that's the breath of god
[1:36:56] that's what happened when the word is
[1:36:58] preached
[1:37:00] and the people
[1:37:02] are on the expectation they are in the
[1:37:04] spirit to receive the word
[1:37:08] praise the lord
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] and the preacher comes and evangelically
[1:37:14] comes and he's rebuking sin and he's
[1:37:17] calling this thing out and you're not
[1:37:19] there sitting in the seat of a scum
[1:37:20] falling and just saying who he think he
[1:37:22] is and and all of that that's the reason
[1:37:24] why brother brahm says unbelief only
[1:37:27] handle
[1:37:29] the
[1:37:33] that's unbeliever
[1:37:43] think about this
[1:37:45] brother branham said
[1:37:49] every mortar
[1:37:53] should have heard the word of god only
[1:37:56] one time
[1:38:01] only one time
[1:38:04] as ariel morton must have the
[1:38:07] opportunity to hear the word of god
[1:38:10] one time
[1:38:12] every mortar
[1:38:15] it took five minutes
[1:38:19] in the presence of god
[1:38:20] yes sir
[1:38:22] to change moses
[1:38:24] from a man of temple
[1:38:27] to the most meekest man
[1:38:31] five minutes
[1:38:42] praise the lord
[1:38:49] when god speak his word
[1:38:53] just like mary
[1:38:56] be it unto me
[1:38:59] i call into that word
[1:39:04] praise the lord
[1:39:06] amen
[1:39:07] she said lord be it unto me
[1:39:10] i call him
[1:39:12] to that word
[1:39:14] that very moment
[1:39:17] she was conceived
[1:39:21] that very moment
[1:39:27] she was conceived
[1:39:35] praise the lord
[1:39:38] she was conceived and she never even
[1:39:40] knew it
[1:39:46] praise the lord
[1:40:02] let's read this one more time and then
[1:40:04] we will find a place to close here
[1:40:11] glory be to god
[1:40:14] but i hope i hope you get you get what
[1:40:17] we try to drive to
[1:40:19] we are moving in an hour
[1:40:23] in a day in time
[1:40:25] an age
[1:40:27] we are getting tall
[1:40:29] with everything that is happening around
[1:40:31] us
[1:40:32] praise the lord
[1:40:35] amen
[1:40:45] it might get to the places well you know
[1:40:47] i love
[1:40:48] this salmon book
[1:40:50] this is my study bible i've on the line
[1:40:55] my favorite reverses i've highlighted it
[1:40:58] praise the lord
[1:41:03] and there might be situations where
[1:41:06] you might not get back to your study
[1:41:07] bible
[1:41:10] praise the lord
[1:41:12] the purpose
[1:41:15] of the holy ghost was because god wanted
[1:41:18] his word
[1:41:19] to leave the pages of the book
[1:41:25] to dwarf in you
[1:41:32] praise the lord
[1:41:37] and he said unto me son of man stand
[1:41:39] upon that feet
[1:41:41] and i will speak on today
[1:41:43] and the spirit enter into me
[1:41:47] when he speak unto me
[1:41:52] and set me upon my feet
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:57] i heard him
[1:41:58] that speak unto me
[1:42:01] so it was almost before ezekiel realized
[1:42:03] himself you already standing
[1:42:07] before he could process
[1:42:09] what was said to him you were already
[1:42:11] standing
[1:42:14] sure
[1:42:16] upon his feet
[1:42:22] we're praying a little bit here
[1:42:27] i was thinking on
[1:42:28] on
[1:42:32] something i will
[1:42:34] talk a little bit on that on sunday if
[1:42:36] i'm led in that direction
[1:42:39] but paul in the in the book of ephesians
[1:42:43] ephesians chapter 6
[1:42:45] let's turn there
[1:42:48] we are closing
[1:42:57] ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 finally my
[1:43:00] brethren be strong in the lord and in
[1:43:02] the in the power of his might
[1:43:05] put on the whole armor of god that ye
[1:43:08] may be able to stand
[1:43:10] against the wild of the devil
[1:43:13] for we rise are not against flesh and
[1:43:15] blood
[1:43:17] but against principalities
[1:43:20] against
[1:43:22] power
[1:43:23] against the ruler
[1:43:25] of the darkness of this world against
[1:43:26] spiritual wickedness
[1:43:28] in high places
[1:43:31] wherefore take unto you
[1:43:33] the whole armor of god
[1:43:36] that ye may be able to to
[1:43:39] to withstand
[1:43:41] in the evil days
[1:43:43] and having done all
[1:43:45] to stand
[1:43:47] praise the lord
[1:43:49] just like it took the spirit
[1:43:52] to follow the word to make the prophet
[1:43:55] ezekiel stand
[1:43:57] that's how it would take
[1:43:59] the spirit
[1:44:00] to follow the word to follow the message
[1:44:04] to make a bride to stand in this age
[1:44:07] until that happened
[1:44:09] we don't have nothing to be able to
[1:44:11] stand against
[1:44:12] the evil
[1:44:14] that the enemy have
[1:44:17] all his plots and his plan and
[1:44:19] everything
[1:44:21] but as paul goes here to tell us
[1:44:24] having done all to stand
[1:44:26] he says stand there for having your
[1:44:28] lying girls with truth and having your
[1:44:31] breasts having the breastplate of
[1:44:32] righteousness the short of your feet
[1:44:35] now he he sell out of this he gave us
[1:44:38] all of this which of course we know
[1:44:41] there are seven
[1:44:43] uh uh
[1:44:44] elements he gave here
[1:44:46] four i mean six of them
[1:44:48] uh uh are physical elements
[1:44:52] praise the lord
[1:44:53] uh uh to be able to give your lyrics the
[1:44:56] breastplate the righteousness your the
[1:44:58] your your feet show
[1:45:01] and
[1:45:03] the
[1:45:03] sheet of faith
[1:45:05] and uh
[1:45:07] the helmet of salvation the swole
[1:45:10] which is the word of god
[1:45:12] sex element a physical element there is
[1:45:16] a seventh element
[1:45:19] that he gives where he says
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:23] praying always
[1:45:26] with all prayer
[1:45:30] and all of the all of all of the
[1:45:32] elements that he gave
[1:45:35] their you know uh the
[1:45:37] the describing and and like like we have
[1:45:40] said before they are all elements that
[1:45:42] help a warrior
[1:45:44] to be able to dress
[1:45:46] and to protect himself the breastplate
[1:45:50] is one year the lens year the you know
[1:45:52] your shoes here your helmet year
[1:45:55] so the entire front
[1:45:57] part of this warrior
[1:46:00] is protected
[1:46:04] and because most of the time there's the
[1:46:06] way we think as humans
[1:46:11] praise the lord
[1:46:12] i will tell you a very
[1:46:14] important secret tonight
[1:46:17] do you know that god
[1:46:20] put the important organs of our body
[1:46:25] on our back
[1:46:31] praise the lord
[1:46:33] amen
[1:46:34] sure
[1:46:36] the importance organ on our body they
[1:46:39] will tell you
[1:46:40] when the military is trained
[1:46:43] they will tell you in the time of war
[1:46:45] and you get in any kind of a difficult
[1:46:47] situation
[1:46:49] you must lay on your face never lay on
[1:46:52] your back
[1:46:55] you have to cover your back
[1:47:02] because
[1:47:03] any bullet through your back
[1:47:07] is closer to any of your major organs
[1:47:15] it will tell them to pull their hands on
[1:47:17] their chest
[1:47:19] and lay forward
[1:47:22] or face up
[1:47:29] praise the lord
[1:47:32] because
[1:47:35] but he ever said yeah that
[1:47:42] and that's that's the thing young people
[1:47:50] and that's the reason why the devil
[1:47:54] fight us to pray
[1:48:00] he makes you busy he makes you lazy
[1:48:04] you are either busy or lazy
[1:48:09] pray for the water
[1:48:10] because he knows that prayer
[1:48:13] cover
[1:48:15] your most vital spiritual
[1:48:18] element
[1:48:22] a cover your back
[1:48:28] praise the lord
[1:48:32] he knows that
[1:48:44] even the four beasts around the throne
[1:48:46] in a way that brother branham described
[1:48:48] it
[1:48:49] they are all
[1:48:52] looking forward
[1:48:54] one beast looked this way one looked
[1:48:55] this way one look this way one looked
[1:48:57] this way
[1:48:59] they're all looking
[1:49:02] at the full compass direction
[1:49:07] but they are looking in that in that
[1:49:09] direction to be able to cover the back
[1:49:12] of one another
[1:49:17] this guy now supposed to look back here
[1:49:20] because this guy is covering his back
[1:49:22] and the other guy is covering his back
[1:49:36] praise the lord
[1:49:41] the most
[1:49:42] vital organ
[1:49:44] is easily reached
[1:49:46] from the back
[1:49:50] i'll talk a little bit about the spine
[1:49:52] on monday on sunday
[1:49:54] when if the lord
[1:49:56] lead us in that direction
[1:50:01] but we are in an hour it's a crucial
[1:50:03] hour
[1:50:04] people
[1:50:07] it's an hour
[1:50:09] where
[1:50:10] we have to
[1:50:17] be sons and daughters like the
[1:50:19] scriptures say sons of god are led by
[1:50:21] the spirit of god
[1:50:22] yes sons and daughters
[1:50:28] people
[1:50:29] that are available
[1:50:32] like the scripture says pray without
[1:50:35] seizing
[1:50:41] that's how much
[1:50:46] that's how much
[1:50:48] protection we provide
[1:50:51] for our weaknesses
[1:50:54] the prophet said sweeten your temple we
[1:50:56] pray
[1:51:01] to be able to speak the words of grace
[1:51:04] it comes to prayer yes sir do you know
[1:51:06] brother brahms he said those apostles
[1:51:09] were men
[1:51:10] of few words
[1:51:15] they were men of few words
[1:51:19] it's not because they didn't have
[1:51:20] anything to say
[1:51:24] it's because
[1:51:26] they were constantly
[1:51:30] living in another dimension
[1:51:33] they were constantly
[1:51:35] their spirit was constantly supplicating
[1:51:39] before god
[1:51:44] their spirit was constantly
[1:51:46] supplicated before god
[1:51:51] say oh god have mercy
[1:51:53] have that young lady
[1:51:56] oh god
[1:51:58] have mercy
[1:52:00] oh god

[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:14] hoping
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:26] you see a lot of the times
[1:55:29] we have we are caught up in this
[1:55:32] religious concept
[1:55:34] [Music]
[1:55:36] that jesus said you have to go into your
[1:55:39] closet lock the doorway
[1:55:42] and because we spend less time in our
[1:55:45] homes
[1:55:47] so we have less time to pray because we
[1:55:49] have to be at the house we have to go in
[1:55:51] the room we have to close the door in
[1:55:53] everything
[1:55:55] but if you realize that brother abraham
[1:55:57] said your heart is the throne of mercy
[1:56:01] the throne has come to the heart of the
[1:56:04] believer
[1:56:06] it means that you can pray anywhere
[1:56:10] and anytime
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:15] you can be walking right down the street
[1:56:19] and have a heart of supplication
[1:56:24] you can train yourself to pray even in
[1:56:27] your busy hour
[1:56:36] but because we are captured in the mind
[1:56:38] in the church mind
[1:56:41] i have to go to church on wednesday
[1:56:42] night so i can pray
[1:56:44] and even you don't even come on time to
[1:56:46] pray 10 minutes

[1:56:53] that all because i show up so i was in a
[1:56:56] prayer meeting tonight oh the prayer
[1:56:57] meeting was wonderful
[1:57:10] we have to be hearts of supplication
[1:57:12] hearts that are that are burdened as you

[1:57:18] puts something on your heart you say oh

[1:58:36] read for me lord
[1:58:39] let the ancient word impart to god
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:43] father
[1:58:45] just like how the preaching of your word
[1:58:48] took ezekiel on his feet lord jesus
[1:58:53] let the ancient world impact tonight oh
[1:58:55] god
[1:58:59] oh let just pray together tonight as we
[1:59:02] put our house before the lord
[1:59:13] we can
[1:59:14] protect the important organs of our life
[1:59:18] the organs of the family
[1:59:22] the way to be able to protect it is to
[1:59:25] cover every prayer
[1:59:27] that is a place that that that
[1:59:30] that
[1:59:31] the provision that the apostle paul made
[1:59:34] for the covering of our back the
[1:59:35] covering of our weaknesses the place our
[1:59:38] hands can reach the place we can see
[1:59:42] verb said we must keep that place on the
[1:59:45] prayer under the blood
[1:59:48] because the enemy have a right to that
[1:59:50] place
[1:59:56] oh father i pray tonight lord just just
[2:00:00] pull down though god the spirit of
[2:00:02] supplication upon the people
[2:00:05] oh father lord god
[2:00:08] lord jesus so father where we will learn
[2:00:11] to pray behind our steering wheels we
[2:00:14] will learn to pray to god by just going
[2:00:16] for a walk and speaking to the lord in
[2:00:19] the early morning we will learn to pray
[2:00:21] even when our hands are busy lord our
[2:00:24] minds will be on the lord
[2:00:26] breathe upon us oh god
[2:00:31] that's the reason why prayer life is is
[2:00:33] dead in the church because the people
[2:00:36] are stuck in traditions
[2:00:48] when god want to breathe upon us
[2:00:51] wherever we are whatever we are doing
[2:01:00] oh god
[2:01:03] stirred our house lord
[2:01:07] stirred our hearts so father
[2:01:12] we become so based and so occupied in
[2:01:15] our minds our minds become so occupied
[2:01:19] that we cannot even spend about five
[2:01:21] minutes before the lord because we are
[2:01:23] so busy on our mind
[2:01:30] our hearts cannot be touched
[2:01:33] that's why we can cry before god
[2:01:35] because if god moves upon your heart
[2:01:40] that is the place of your emotion
[2:01:44] oh father
[2:01:47] breathe lord into our prayerless life
[2:01:50] lord pray for god
[2:01:54] let the inspiration of the almighty
[2:02:02] o precious lord

[2:02:35] to use that moment to breathe upon us

[2:02:40] for god to the earth so we can breathe
[2:02:42] upon somebody lord we can be able to

[2:02:47] encourage them or father
[2:02:49] how many opportunities have we blown oh

[2:11:45] do you think enoch was doing
[2:11:47] when he was walking
[2:11:50] he was communing with god
[2:11:55] he was communing with god if god can be
[2:11:58] able to bring you to that place
[2:11:59] [Music]

[2:12:05] place
[2:12:06] and your heart can be so busy with god
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:10] it's it's not something that anybody can
[2:12:13] do or everybody can do
[2:12:16] because some people they i mean
[2:12:19] they lose everything with little
[2:12:20] distraction
[2:12:23] as soon as somebody says something yet
[2:12:24] they want to know who's talking and
[2:12:26] who's that
[2:12:28] but for you to be in a busy place
[2:12:31] and then you are shouting with god
[2:12:36] that's the believer's position
[2:12:40] that's the heavenly places
[2:12:45] times are becoming busier
[2:12:48] we get a lot of things on our hands to
[2:12:50] do
[2:12:51] little time to do it
[2:12:55] if the devil can just keep you in a
[2:12:57] religion and say well you got to pray
[2:12:58] wednesday night go for prayer meeting
[2:13:00] all you know the bible said jesus said
[2:13:02] you got to close the window and this
[2:13:04] there yeah he's the same one that said
[2:13:06] that and he's the same one that told uh
[2:13:08] that said through the apostle paul
[2:13:10] prayer without ceasing
[2:13:11] he says let men lift up their hands
[2:13:13] everywhere lift up holy hands
[2:13:24] the bride is getting into a place
[2:13:27] the bride is getting into a place
[2:13:33] where the world is disappearing from her
[2:13:35] eyes
[2:13:37] and all the destruction you know
[2:13:38] everything that
[2:13:40] uh the enemy is putting out there
[2:13:43] is is just becoming glad
[2:13:46] and when she look at everything she see
[2:13:48] her beloved
[2:14:02] [Music]
[2:14:06] stand on our feet and wash it

[2:14:38] jesus
[2:14:41] [Applause]
[2:14:42] [Music]
[2:14:48] [Applause]
[2:14:52] me
[2:14:55] [Music]
[2:15:20] yes jesus draw
[2:15:24] me close
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:27] closer on to
[2:15:30] you
[2:15:32] lord let the word
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:45] and jesus draw
[2:15:48] me closer
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:16:06] you know many times when i hear people
[2:16:08] say
[2:16:11] when i used to be at this place
[2:16:13] oh i used to pray
[2:16:15] when i used to be at this place or be in
[2:16:17] africa and all of those things
[2:16:19] [Music]
[2:16:25] a prayer life
[2:16:27] is a life of relationship
[2:16:31] it's a life that you grow in you grow
[2:16:34] in a prayer life
[2:16:37] it's not it's not an exercise
[2:16:41] no it's a relationship it's something
[2:16:43] that you grow in
[2:16:47] so if you if you ever did grow
[2:16:50] if you ever grow
[2:16:54] someone that you have a relationship
[2:16:55] with
[2:16:57] it does not change
[2:17:00] it does not change for you to think that
[2:17:01] oh yeah i thought you know i come to
[2:17:03] america i'm working now so i'm so busy i
[2:17:05] can't even pray oh that you did not have
[2:17:08] a relationship in prayer
[2:17:14] because if you have a relationship you
[2:17:16] have a wife you have children even if
[2:17:18] they lock you up in praising it does not
[2:17:21] kill
[2:17:22] your emotion for them
[2:17:25] the more you are far from them the more
[2:17:27] you desire them more
[2:17:33] it's something that we must grow in
[2:17:38] we must grow in that relationship
[2:17:40] we must grow
[2:17:44] just just the same way the devil fight
[2:17:46] against marriage relationship
[2:17:49] that's how he fight against a prayer
[2:17:51] life
[2:17:52] because he knows that prayer life brings
[2:17:55] you in an intimate relationship with god
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:05] in every relationship you don't you
[2:18:06] don't start from the top
[2:18:08] you grow
[2:18:10] you grow you learn how to talk
[2:18:14] you learn how you learn how to break
[2:18:16] into feelings
[2:18:17] [Music]
[2:18:23] the lord bless you tonight
[2:18:31] i
[2:18:31] desire to wash it
[2:18:36] and let's sing that one more time we are
