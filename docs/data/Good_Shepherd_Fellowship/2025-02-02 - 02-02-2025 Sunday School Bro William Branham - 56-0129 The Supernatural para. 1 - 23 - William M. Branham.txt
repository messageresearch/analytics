[Music] the Lord bless you friends thank you and you'll be seated just a [Music] moment it always makes me feel good to to feel welcome uh that's kind of a I'm a Kentuckian myself you know and I I like to hear that making you welcome and uh such a nice welcome to this city and among you my Christian friends certainly makes me feel grateful to you Always by Brother Rogers I I love him he's been a wonderful little brother to me and how he's certainly been a real tool in God's hand here in Owensboro I just looking across the street there where you're going to build a new church or something over there that he was telling me about this morning at The Breakfast Table and that's wonderful see you you progress like that that's just show that you're you're backing up the right thing and God servant is um trying his best to give the best he can to God's people i' ever congregation appreciate a pastor like that that to see what your finances your ties your offerings and so forth you are he going straight into the kingdom of God to EMB better the kingdom of God make a better place not for himself for you he he's got the sheep on his mind the shepherd always has while in Palestine over in the oran rather I often wondered on the parable of the Bible The Parables rather of the Bible what some other them men and um you almost have to go into the orance to find out what this bible really means once I I've sat down and many of us as as Western ministers has um pondered over the thought what did they mean by this what did this mean and what did that mean and if you ever go to the Eastern country and see their un changing uh habits well then you find out more about the Bible it become a new book to me after I went to the east for instance like Jesus said I believe in St John 10 I think I am the door to the sheeple I am the door to the Sheep pole I often wonder how that that meant that he stood at the gate and received all the people as you come in or I thought maybe the shepherd stood and number the Sheep when they come in like that that's I used used to think that and perhaps many of you my brethren and clergymen have thought the same thing but once there you find out that there it's a difference it isn't U the numbering of the sheep but the shepherd himself becomes the door there's a crowd like a place of a shelter over and um he brings in all the sheep and PS in in there then he goes and lays down across the door and the Sheep are the wolf can't come in or the Sheep go out without crossing the shepherd isn't that wonderful see he is the door to the Sheep Bowl see nothing can come to the Sheep unless the shepherd permits it and if we got the shepherd at the door how secure and and happy should we be Satan can't touch it unless the shepherd permits it and it's all for the good whatever it has to be see what I mean that's when you said I noticed again and the Shepherd in this country Shepherd doesn't mean very much that well it's some ancient word but over there a Shepherd oh my and sheep the people live by their sheep and the shepherd um takes care of them one time while going to the country I noticed in the Far East of U of the little in India how that they had a Shepherd came down and was bringing his sheep and he thought that Parable there where he said my sheep know my voice a stranger they will not follow now that sheep was born under the tutorship of this Shepherd he learns that voice he'll never pay attention to anybody else's voice he learns that Shepherd's voice another Shepherd might call they might do whatever they want to but there's some little something about that Shepherd that the Sheep recognizes see that's the way it is with God's sheep strange voices they it just don't sound right they just won't go that's all and a sheep can be tempted but when it finds out that it's the wrong Shepherd he'll turn away and I know notice how the Sheep follow the example of the shepherd coming down through the street where there's a little narrow streets the streets in the Eastern countries there were made in the days of Chariots when they had the Chariots that went through the street and horse riders and they're very narrow very seldom you find one as wide as that post there very seldom sometime maybe all 12 ft wide the street M the of the like in Oslo Norway the street there is only about 8T across in The Old City it's around, 1600 years old and then you find out they didn't have automobiles in this Modern Age where they Shuffle and jostle through the Broadways see naam called them Broadways and they standing on the Outer Drive in Chicago I thought of that many times how that a three and four breast on each way the Broadways and the elevation of the separation of the streets in the middle out they press the button in the place and for several miles a rail rise up like this to separate your traffic at different times of the evening and at different times of the day Broadways in that days one of those Lanes would have been a complete highway but seeing this Shepherd come down through the city it was a it was alarming there come a whole string of sheep po me now the easterners put all their dainties out on the street even their meats and everything else lays on the street and all their fruit and their Pro produce lays that on the stre feet just right here's the store like said they keep their stuff back in there but you buy right off the side of the wall and there's no sidew walk it's just a street so everybody walks right in the street just right down the street the cobblestone street and here come a Shepherd down the street walking walking along and behind him a string of sheep a city block long and them sheep walking right by the produce and things and wouldn't turn right or left they kept their eyes on the shepherd moving right on through I thought oh god what the shepherd mean not look right or left not be tempted by this or that but walk in the footsteps of the shepherd they want to follow the shepherd I noticed one day while we were in a little British Jeep riding around there's a Shepherd had a whole lot of animals up on the hill there he was feeding them they were leading them and taking them places and in there he had sheep in there he had goats in there he had mules had camels everything he was feeding them all it was all grazing the shepherd was watching him I said my shepherd here means many I said a Shepherd is a grazer but said you know the strange thing it is Mr Brandon he said when night time comes you watch that all those sheep go right straight to the shepherd said the mules will stay out in the pasture and said the camels will stay out in the pasture but said and the goats will stay out in the pasture but said the Sheep all come straight to the shepherd when he comes night time why said because the Sheep are putt up at night and kept safe I said Mr don't talk like that you'll make me start shouting right here in the middle of the road night times are coming many are grazing on the same thing but only the Sheep will he recognize see what I mean just the Sheep the Born Again many are called to your chosen or I love him today don't you let us speak to him now before we open his word our heavenly father we come to thee on this sabbath day raining on the outside may we might call it Gloom hazy rainy weather but how could the farmer put in these crops if we didn't have have much moisture this spring there be no through food raised ground would be dry people would Parish we realize that this is like experience of a Christian sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chasing of the Lord many things to correct us that we'll be fruit bearing Christan sometimes has to prun is cut off take away take out of her hand and we think sometime oh God what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing so we pray father that today that you'll prune every one of us from the least to the greatest of Pastor God we pray that you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you father take away the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing Christians the day coming when it's go to get dark then we want to go into the Sheep fow we want to be sheep today Father we want to follow exactly in the footsteps of the shepherd He gave us his example said I come not to do my will but the will of him that sent me may that be our motive today God to do the will of God who has saved us bless the church today in the Sunday School throughout the entire world and remember us Lord this little spot you're in ensb today that you will pour out your blessings upon us for we're needy and hungry and thirsting for righteousness our promises it shall be fulfilled in Jesus name we pray Amen in these Services a visiting with brother Rogers which is always a great uh privilege to come and to meet with brother Rogers and you dear saintly people here in other churches through Owensboro and the cities around about I've learn this that no matter if he's Chinese Japan Korean German whatever he is as long as he's a brother or she's a sister there's not a bit of difference than him they're just all sheep of the Same Soul watching it through the different nations throughout the world have come this you get into a communistic country where have had to be have had to have people with rifles to keep the crowds back and I've had to have people that would soldiers that I had to duck my head down and Mill around me to keep them getting shot till they get me out into somewhere into the darkness where they couldn't see to shoot me at and things like that preaching the gospel bringing Good Tidings of great joy of the Lord Jesus Christ and then it's it's marvelous to know that Jesus in the midst of all of that it just as sweet and good dear just there's nothing alarming about it just taking a message and today it's our privilege to be here with you and at the sports center this afternoon or this evening or other for the service we pray that you'll all find a place if your own church is not having service while be out to visit with us and we'd be glad to do all that we can to help you to make burdens a little lighter make the community a little better place to do right a little easier and a harder place to do wrong that's what the the meetings are intended now today as we're just going to speak a little I have a a very bad voice and and I'm I got a vision in my heart and I thought this morning it's Sunday school just before the uh the coming forth of the preaching this afternoon and if God willing today this afternoon I want to speak on a very uh or this evening rather a very uh outstanding uh scriptures concerning the time that we're living and I believe but God's help the subject I probably will approach you from a different way than the first one of the first messages I preached after the great visitation of the Holy Spirit a few weeks ago and I thought being that we were together this morning just as a little group of Christians here that we would talk just Heart to Heart heart with one another a while and I know that down in every man's heart there's something that yearns to see the supernal here not long ago I was sitting in California in a meeting wearing a hair piece on top of my head and wearing a pair of dark glasses just to listen at a Brother's theology because they'd recognize me if it wasn't I sat with people right next to them and they didn't even home just sitting there just see looking around you even hear him talk about me they didn't know it was me just sat there and I happened to be sitting by a man with his collar turned around there was a minister come to the platform and the man's one of my converts to Divine Healing but he he'd preach a while then he'd go back and a violet would change his clothes when he get a little sweaty and come back out again on the platform and this great man sitting there shaking his head he looked over me he said does that act like a servant of Christ I said I am not the judge I said he said uh well I said I think his message is wonderful he said um are you a Christian I said yes sir I am and he said um well he said do you think a servant of Christ should just put on a whole lot like that and dress like that and act like that and I said wello you see to my opinion God has people in different categories to catch people that live in different categories he talking about said Bo the man has two elvado every year I said I'm very thankful that God's that good to him see and uh but he looked down at me kind of strange and he said um are you a Christian I said I'm a minister he said uh my name is so and so and I said my name is Brandon he said you wouldn't have to be the Brandon that pra for the sick I said yes sir oh he said I see you can see why I taken up this other brother and he said um Mr Brandon he said uh aren't you a Baptist I said I why yes sir he said I want to ask you something he said I am a certain doctor of Theology and a certain Church well a presbyterian and he said you know what on this West Coast CH he said we Presbyterian people had the entire Coast seed down that we had the biggest churches the finest Congregation of any churches on the west coast and said you know what broke us up I said no sir he said that c Christian Science come in and broke up our church and said now this Pentecostal groups coming coming in and breaking up Christian Science and everything I said mhm I said Doctor do you know hungry children leap from a garbage can if they're hungry said well I guess that's right I said if you Presbyterians as you said you were if you would have stayed with the word of God and give the children the bread of life that cult would have never broken up I said you just lay down that's all and I said people are still people and there every man is trying to look beyond the curtains he's trying to see where he come from and where he went to and if the Church of the Living God won't produce it then the devil will rise up some Cults to give him some false things I said therefore you ought to stay with the word of God they' all been Presbyterians and that's right truly that's the way I think generally the feeling of people are now I want to read a little text of scripture here and um maybe the Lord add His blessings to it and I'll lay my watch out because I know your Sunday School classes will be adjourning pretty soon and we have some after service now I thought I'd just talk to you just just Heart to Heart a little bit this morning in the Sunday School lesson and we find this just across the page from where I preached last night from Second Kings this is second king 5th now listen at the fourth verse and it was so when Elijah the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes he sent unto the king and said will you rich your clothes come to me and know there is a prophet in Israel now the thing we want to talk on this morning for a little while is the super Supernatural we're all hungry for Supernatural you Methodist Brethren are hungry for Supernatural I got a Methodist preacher with me that's hungering and thirsting for the supernatural you Baptists are hungering and thirsting for Supernatural oh lovely Mar now surely if God is still God he's still Supernatural don't you believe that he's got to be now we're trying to place God in some prehistoric or some historical God but what good does a historical God do today what benefit is the god of Elijah to a man today if he isn't the same God what are you learning about him in the Seminary if he was some historical fact or not the same today you'd be better to learn agriculture or something something would help somebody is that right you'd be better off if you learned to your children to be an architect instead of a minister if he's a historical God and not the same today what good does the god of Moses do if he isn't the same God today just reason that in your minds now we are so in so always concerned about our experiences a little lady told me last night which is in our midst a preacher of a certain great denomination Church and I asked her did her father ever Pastor so and so and she said brother Brandon my father only had uh uh grammar school education therefore they would not permit him in bigger churches because his education was too poorly perhaps a fine spirit filled man but the organization would not promote him no matter how spirit filled he was because of uh inadequate educ ation there they miss God Peter couldn't even sign his own name and he had the keys to the kingdom of God given to him by Jesus Christ we're looking to education education's fine but that's taught in school houses the church is a place to know of God and learn of God and in the Supernatural and God is a supernatural and the same yesterday today and forever now we want to to see and place this before our our audience that that God still is the same that he ever was the people gets away from God but God Remains the Same his his nature and his power and his desire is always the same through every generation it ever changes it's always the same it's the people that gets away from God and not God from the people they lose their faith God covers all space all everywhere he's omnipresent so he's everywhere and he's always has been everywhere and he always will be everywhere but it's the attitude of the people that brings the result that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got in one place and one ACC card it's the atmosphere what brings the result you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their mind but the Lord Jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happen to the Call's headlines and newspaper in the morning right it's atmosphere I don't believe in joking from the pull pit because the pull Pit's no place to joke it's a sacred place I'm quoting something just for this here Mr BOS were very good sense of humor and he said brother Brandon to prove that it's atmosphere said you could take a hen egg and put it on under a puppy and tie him down and it would hatch a chicken see it's a warmth of the puppy's body that would hatch the egg it don't have to be under the hen it can be under the puppy it could be in the incubator it's the atmosphere and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of God Among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place they're reasoning and wandering and steing and thinking and all tore up don't know where they do stand half of not even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right you can't do it it won't be like it's got to be in one accard one place and settle down with one motive one thing then you're going to see something happen it don't only work that but if you look at it in the scientific World say you're all a bunch of salesman and we're going to sell chiet or Pontiacs or some kind of a car and one in his heart really thinks the stud Bakers are better and so forth like that get us all the the Buick is the best and the other some of the car get us together like that you can never have a right kind of need take it in the devil's word go over and say we're going to a dance one man standing up and saying well now he he don't know about where he wants to dance or not and this girl over and she is thatting the music sing near my God to thee L an atmosphere for a dance well that's not any different and want a lot of atmosphere you going into to church for a service of God just that contrary right the only thing to bring the right atmosphere then for the dancers to put on their old music that Mak dances and everybody gets thinking what a good time they're going to have dancing and so forth and they'll be having their big hoop up in town put the right kind of a music on the Pian the Oregon and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there and go to meet everything that they had me up something will go taken place atmosphere but that's the hardest thing there is to do and that is to get people in that atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the atmosphere of believing and that's the reason sometimes a Divine Life that's been called and set aside has become a fanatic or crazy or or Mystic or something to the eyes of the general public is because you're considered a a a a I'd say an erotic or a insane person is because that you have changed your Dwelling Place got into a different atmosphere and your one motive your one thought is to stay in that atmosphere and any person that ever come into that atmosph one time I'll never be satisfied nowhere [Music] else and that's why I believe that we should have our churches under control by the holy ghost that men and women in their work and wherever they should be should continually desire and they will if they've ever once come into that atmosphere [Music]
