TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you for what you have done for us we just cannot express from our hearts how we appreciate this and how you come to our rescue when we're in trouble we have learned through the years to trust you and believe you and i pray this afternoon lord that you will pour your blessings upon this people may there not be a feeble person in our midst when this service is injured if there would be one in here who's not right with god may the power that raised jesus from the grave quicken their mortal bodies lord and their soul and turn them to you granted those without the holy spirit may just be the one great day that they'll never forget lord forgive our sins we would pray that you would bless brother sullivan our gracious and precious friend and his thoughts for the people and to try to bring them every possibility that he can to help him i pray that you'll bless brother sullivan bless the ministers throughout the land everywhere give to them an exceeding abundance of lord may they stand gallon in the pulpit and proclaim the word of god for we're living in the closing hours of the history of this world let thy goodness overshadow us in these times for we ask that in jesus name amen i am so grateful to you people as to god for this brother sullivan tuck it up on himself you see it would be right for brother sullivan to do that so we were fixed to prepare for we thank you for your kindness and now for the love offering if you didn't have to do that you know that wasn't necessary just they paid expenses the hotel and the food what we had that that stuff was necessary but thank you very kindly and it'll go to help missionary and bring people to god there won't be any cigarettes about with any whiskey nothing is wrong you'll go for the right thing and i pray that god will put that on your account up there and multiply it by 10 pounds each dollar or penny or nickel that you gave towards this service and now i want to thank the united states army for letting us have this building to set in to have these services i certainly do thank them with all my heart and as i understand brother sullivan said everything would be paid up right we've never left a city yet on one cent what everything is taking care of we just don't believe in anything else you mustn't oh anyone you must be square and straight and if you owe somebody go face them and tell them that you're old but just give you a little time your faith always that's a better that's a good mark of christianity be an honest upbringing you want to live just what you talk about if you don't live it yourself how'd you expect somebody else to live so you are written epistles read of all men so always be honest just true tell the truth no matter how bad i've heard something tell the truth anyhow because you can always tell it the same way each time and you tell a lie you'll have to go a million miles around and still you have come back to that lie again and you've made an awful thing just be honest and you can always tell it the same way because it's the truth that's way at the bible tell it just the way the bible says it don't compromise with it see it just that way it's written right here and you can point your finger to it that's where you defeat satan satan said to jesus if thou be the son of god i see you perform a miracle they say you're a miracle worker turn these stones to bread and let's see you're hungry he said but it is written man shall not live by bread alone he took the father's word and defeated the devil right on his own grounds so you can do the same thing defeat the devil on his grounds with the word of the lord then i will always be grateful to brother solomon this excuse this expression i think when they're made by the soul and they throw away the pattern i think there's only one man i ever met in my life that reminded me of brother sullivan that was e howard cable i don't know whether he ever known him or not from the from brother caleb was just a good old country boy brother sullivan and he'd stick his hands down his pocket so far to his suspenders he'd draw way down and talk with his head sideways and he was just one he hired care and so i'm i'm so glad to have brother sullivan as a friend and a brother in the gospel and i pray that god will bless him in his little church up here his precious wife his loved ones and to you the other ministers that you're to you and your congregation full gospel preachers upon little technical things of the scripture we might disagree with one another i disagree with my wife on some things you know what that's on [Music] she likes apple pie and i like cherry so we disagree and i'll tell you what i do with mine i like a good hot piece of cherry pie i could stand it right now and pour butter on top of it and then pour molasses on top of that brother you've got something worth eating my wife's afraid of it i think she's afraid of the calories she might like it but you know how the women are they're afraid it gets the thin you could stick them with a pen cut them to the bone and yet they want to they want to reduce that's the nature of them i guess others and um but i like that now we disagree upon that other things were all right but you see we're not perfectly in agreement so we would see the same thing brethren but the main thing we're eating power that's the main thing principally upon the baptism of the holy spirit and the coming of christ and the great evangelical fundamental doctrines of the bible we certainly stand arm-in-arm with that as one big united brethren without a denominational barrier without anything to hinder us we march towards calgary as one great army together if i can ever be of any help to you i'll be glad to do it and i'm sure you'd say the same thing to me and you can be a help to me and that's one thing you can do that i know is pray for me that god will never let me go wrong i i it's not in my heart to go wrong i want to go right i want to do what's right because i realize as brother jack bohr told me one time he said brother branham i wouldn't stand in your boots for all your experience at the day of the judgment because god's going to require you a great answer that because these give you millions of people in your hands now if i know i'm going to stand there and answer for those people and what kind of the gospel have i got to preach what kind of a sincerity you want to hold the purchase of his blood in my hands and as he's give me a gift beyond a shadow of doubt any sensible thinking person will know it has to come from god and with that if i lead somebody off on the wrong path just because a certain group said that god would make me pay for it at the day of the judgment but when i seen the vision here not long ago and heard them people scream out did you get your little book last night the businessman's voice that's good and in the vision sometimes we'll have it printed in full detail that's not all of it but in that and seeing that and i stood there just as just as i'm standing right now and i was looking at myself laying on the bed watching my wife and yet standing here looking at myself and here was those people standing around like that when i said will paul have to be judged for the gospel he preached said yes i said i've preached every word just exactly the way he did and the millions screamed out we are resting on that that's where i wanted to be on the cross there i want to be that way just like that just what paul said i don't want to add one thing to it take one thing away from it just what the bible said that's this way i want to keep it going and of course you keep it like that denominations on every side is going to rise up a barrier against it and then many times the brethren think that i'm against my brothers god knows different from that as long as he knows what's true see it's not against brethren it's a system that's making us not to be brothers it isn't the word of god keep us from being brothers it's the system that we join into that keeps us from being brothers that's right so where must we stand stand on the word and god will draw man to it that's right don't never organize it denominationally just keep it though in god and just keep moving on just watching the end hold steady god will bring the rest of it [Music] there's been so many things you've done for me i appreciate it now if i can help you towards giving you a prayer cloth or something now don't ask me doctrine because i don't desire to do that so many people writes me questions about marriage and divorce and so forth which is a tangle in the church i always refer them back and say ask your pastor people wrote me a letter and said what about this and what about that i refer the letter back you'll get it see your pastor on a little thing because after all he's your shepherd he's he's the one that god sent to watch over you and we might disagree upon it then that caused a confusion in your church we don't want that no no we just want you to quit doing things that's sinful things out of the bible just keep moving on towards god see and if you cause little frictions and things like that that upsets the church so i'd rather your pastor tell you about marriage and divorce and these things and them things let him do it he's god's servant too and he's equipped to do that remember the good samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to the end that's the church and gave the man there two tents and told him if he needed any more he pay him when he come so he's got two tents he's able to doctor you if he's a man of god if he's a man of god it stands on the word of god he's got what god give me the spirit and the word is that right how is it word worship in spirit and in truth and the word is the truth is that right now thank you very kindly again and now i'm awfully tired and real tired this afternoon i never instantly stay in another hotel as long as i live big drunken party and all night long beating the doors and screaming and women i just set up all night and so i i never intend to have another hotel i'll go to a motel i'm gonna get me a truck so i'm sleeping it outside on the ground somewhere get me a tent in the sleeping bag or somewhere where i get to myself that's right it's so simple this nation no wonder it's honeycomb and rotten to the core right up here in another place in your state not only this state everywhere right up here a few years ago i was in a religious meeting up here in the state a big city and that night a religious group a orthodox church with teenagers had a convention [Music] i never i've been in africa under voodoo and everything i ever heard anything like that and the next morning i can't tell you exactly where mixed audience laying on the floor immoral things that have been done whiskey bottles over and then young kids [Music] boys and girls in the same room all night together and the next morning the holy father is sitting out there and then come up bowing to him like that under the name of jesus christ [Music] have i gone crazy what what's the matter me i just can't stand those things and something shakes me to pieces when i see that is that to represent my lord jesus a drunken immoral party with immoral things that used on them young men and women laying on the floors in the waste baskets and bottles and oh my goodness could you call that christianity no one of the world's in a sinful condition well what does a sinner say when he looks at that thousands of them them young girls so drunk they couldn't hardly stand up in the room all night and then boys and all the dirty talk you ever heard of your life i put pillars over my head like this try to go to sleep out in the floors drunk and run up down the floors like that religious now i can expect these sinful people right now that call and sell sports out here in a bowling game one of my kids is starting towards a bowling alley out running out of the country call that sport that's not sport what's this if you want to be right get right with god through i want to read for you just a word out of the bible you find this few words i want to read here for a text found in 17th chapter first king's first verse as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be doing our reign in these years according to my word [Music] first kings first chapter 17th chapter first verse if i can send you a prayer talk anytime just write to me my secretary here is present now brother mcguire i mean he's ever got a prayer call from us let's see your hands stand up for the gym i want to see that you and your wife too here's my secretary and they're his wife the ones that work that's a boy and girl that sends you your prayer calls from the meeting both consecrated christians and the voice that sweet little boy she here on the phone when he called me that's the little lady sitting here his wife her father and mother and name are here with us today and the loved ones all around so and then you know my field secretary mr mercer brother leo mercer is here somewhere in brother gene golden and so if we can send you a prayer call anytime anything we can do pray for you on the phone anything we can do we'll do it this strange looking man with a staff in his hand [Music] his step study lies gleaming with the glory of god his beard blowing on the side an old hairy piece of sheepskin wrapped around him he's making his step just as sturdy as he walked down the road to samaria he wasn't very much to look at [Music] but he had thus saith the lord for that great nation of israel yeah he lies in the tishby a prophet of the lord he wasn't much to look at but he had the word of the lord he wasn't afraid to stand before the king for he had been the presence of greater than a king he had been in the presence of jehovah therefore he knowed where he was standing [Music] and when he walked before the king he didn't stutter and stammer he know what he was talking about he could say to the king thus saith the lord god of israel there will be no rain or no do until i call for it why did he say that till i called for it according to my word because he had the word of the lord he was a prophet and the prophet has the word of lord [Music] it's a striking thing to see the parallel between israel of the old testament and america now [Music] both of them are great nations both of them had been founded and their people had come there because of religious persecutions [Music] israel had been persecuted by pharaoh and had been in bondage for hundreds of years or they were deprived of worshiping the true and living god and have been deprived of that privilege and they've become slaves but god had made them a promise in his bible for in his word and by his prophets that he'd give them a land and they'd come into this land and drove back the occupants of that land and it possessed their inheritance for god had a purpose of doing that and so is this great nation of ours we come here and on plymouth rock this nation was founded on freedom of religion because our forefathers had fled persecution of the modern jezebel system and had come up and stood many great persecutions and martyrdom under that false system of jezebel and according to the bible of revelations the 13th chapter god had promised them an always and a place for the woman was carried into the wilderness where she was fed for a time time and a dividing account god had made the promise to america or to the church to the woman to come into this country did you know it's revelation 13 all the other beasts that come up out of the sea waters revelation 17 17 said the water switch-style sauces thickness and multitudes of people all the other beasts that come up out of water thickness in multitudes of people but when in united states come up it come up out of the earth where there was no people and remember when it come up it looked like a little now lamb lamb has two horns and that's civil and ecclesiastical powers but when they united remember then that lamb spoke like the dragon did before him and the dragon was wrong [Music] when the dragon stood before the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born the red dragon who stood before the woman israel to devour the child as soon as it was born and stood out of persecution killed all the children from two years old down rome the dragon stood at the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born and then we find that this country came up as a freed country and was had a lamb which means the lamb of god but after a while this same system that we have spoke like the dragon and exercised all the power the dragon had before him they parallel one to the other perfectly and remember when these israel came up and took her homeland in palestine drove back all the occupants of that land and possessed the land we came in and took it from the indians drove them back and possessed the land god had a reason for that god was going to show the world what he could do with a a little band of people that wanted freedom and freedom of religion to serve god what did they do for israel he made israel the most mightiest nation in the world and she stayed that way until she got out the will of god what did he do with america he made her the mightiest nation in the world until she's getting out of the will of god [Music] parallel one to the another exactly when israel came over in the land they were a great people because they had great leadership they had god caring man over them such as david king solomon all the world feared him and they enjoyed that privilege of no wars no troubles and living under the power of god until people from all over the knowing world come to see him god gave him a gift of discernment is up on solomon and the queen of the south from queen of sheba came all the way across the sahara desert taking her three months just to hear the wisdom of solomon [Music] and when she saw that solomon could discern spirit and made known to her the secrets in her heart she said all i heard about you was right more besides she was convinced that that was god and america upon the basis of our forefathers who came here for religious freedom we had godly man in them days as leaders george washington abraham lincoln [Music] man of renowned character man of god america was america in those days george washington here at valley forge before he crossed the delaware praying all night until he was wet unto his waist kneeling in snow and the next morning when the americans started to crosses only about 20 percent of them had shoes to wear the american army but they had a principle they had something that they had to fight for they didn't care what comer went the farmers come in stopped his pie and took out his ox and got his life and went to fight for what he know was freedom the next day our biggest four or five bullet holes musket bullets went through his coat hat and never touched thee man of god who founded this nation great man no longer they wrote long may our lands be bright with freedom's holy light protect us by thy might great god our king some time ago i talked to an old man down at cardin indiana he told me about when the capital wasn't cardin and how he said how he went the ox cart down to here that the governor speaking he and the governor's only two had had two pieces of suit on said that he raised the sheep and cheered him and washed them and his sister spun it and made him a coat to go with his trousers the old fella sitting there then of about 85 or 90 years old [Music] pulled his beard like that he said billy that's when i'm married he was american i looked at the old fellow and i thought boy you a lot of these young ones wouldn't believe it but you're telling the truth what happened to israel after all this godly background they began to get carefree they began to get to a place where they well they didn't care what went on they began to go get slack in their worship to god although they held a form of religion just like we had they had a form of godliness but they begin to get free with their people and they begin to bring in different harrises in their church the worship of balaam began to creep in and israel pleasure man drunk and such things as that and finally brought in a leader who didn't know god ahab who succeeded his father and his father was an ungodly man rich man but an ungodly man and he done all the sins more than anyone before him ever done but israel in their drunken stupor [Music] they put a man in like that and put him on the throne to be a ruler over them they thought it was all right just like a lot of americans did today he's a good politician so what difference does it make it won't make any difference because he's a good politician a lot of americans too many catholic the catholic church is on the rise we have had one catholic president and will no doubt have another never dawned upon my heart so much before the the last election and then i think where we were at and so on this i i won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation it's a number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation 13 13 5 13 everything's in 13 everything is woman and remember thus sayeth the law they'll be a woman she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i see her a great woman a nation vow to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out if you're young if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet this day this word of prophecy is fulfilled known jesus made that god known he revealed [Music] you
