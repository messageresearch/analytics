representation is also seen when we stand for one another and uh [Music] pray for one another before we go into the service tonight and before we pray the uh [Music] just at the time I we will preparing a communion in the office and uh getting the service ready for tonight uh there was there was a text message that came through my phone a WhatsApp message by the way from uh from overseas and uh and now I want to play something I was I was playing the book of Isaiah chapter 50 what I Was preparing the communion 53 actually and uh so I took my phone and I wanted to have my audio Bible going and then I fed on the on the message there uh one of our dear beloved brother that's uh brother Gideon retief there's willing retief son he took over the pastorship from his dad when brother Branham went over to South Africa the church that hosted brother Branham but a willy retief came out of that church and then even though the original people uh church group their host their brother Branham try to create a lot of uh uh what I say problem because of the way the meetings were set you know they set the meeting in a way where uh you know they want the brother Branham to go by the way they said things but then over the years uh Brother Willy retief and some of the other brothers that came out that embraced the message uh [Music] they were the kind of a pioneer of spreading the message in South Africa and all the South Team part of Africa he went to be with the Lord I think two years ago if I'm right and then his son Gideon took over the church so the text message came true he was on his way to church this morning and got a Hot and Hot attack and he went into led into an accident and he also went to be with the Lord so it's a kind of a hard thing for the uh the church did and and generally for the country because like I said upon near the message over the years I was there when I was there December I was talking with one of the the I was here one of the headers to brother uh Owen Palm he was pastoring the church over in Kimberling the the Diamond city of South Africa so he was giving me some of the history when he began and because they all were going there I

bless you thank you musicians let's go to the book of Isaiah I wanted to just take a thought from the Sunday School tip this morning marriage and divorce you'll you'll realize that couple of uh Sundays ago I took few images and talking about Design This is Where I I actually was driving to by giving you those few images to look at let's uh Isaiah chapter 54. Isaiah chapter 54 let's read verse 4 and verse 5. just for the service tonight we pray that the Lord the preacher has already preached this morning so don't expect me to preach or don't make me impressed let me now say don't expect me to preach please don't make me appreciate me I just want to encourage you verse 4 fear now for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither shall neither be thou confounded for Thou shalt not be put to shame for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth amen the shame of that youth the shame of your beginning praise the Lord the shame of your weakness amen praise the Lord for Thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth and shall not remember the reproach of the witherhold animal for thy maker is thine husband the one that have designed you is the one that have espoused you amen is the one that have called you that have chosen you to himself for thy maker is thine husband the Lord of hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole Earth shall he be called amen let us pray Heavenly Father we prayed and asked that Lord you will bless this portion of your word that we have read and and we ask the Lord God you just bless the few thoughts that is on our heart tonight Lord as we go back to god father and remind ourselves from few things that we listened to this morning in Jesus name amen praise the Lord verse 56 I'm in verse 6 there says for the Lord have called thee as a woman forsaken and greeting in spirit and a wife of Youth when there was refused so thy God Amen tonight I want to just speak on a little talk that I make her is thine husband amen now just like I said we go straight back to to marriage in Davos I send the uh the few notes that I wanted to just go over tonight now you'll remember like we said Wednesday night brother Brandon refer back to uh Danny Herron uh prophecy because the subject of marriage and divorce was going to be a high subject but being the messenger of the hour the tax was given to him for him to be able to bring the word of truth because there were there was a lot of mix of that on the entire subject of marriage and divorce people had a lot of interpretation amen you go back to the Bible you see it and then he make us to know that uh uh by the grace of God he took a high choice right from the beginning of his ministry to be able to stay with nothing but thus said the Lord amen and another high Choice he had to you know uh trust the Lord to be able to guide him I mean not not how the the privilege to be out of high school or go to theological school and uh he had to hired God to help his ignorance amen now so uh uh but then as he as he brings the message brother Brandon if you follow the tip this morning or you've been you've been playing the tip at home studying you will realize that he came to this place where he started uh uh dealing with the makeup of the woman praise the Lord when he started dealing with the makeup of the woman and and if you if you do remember uh I think I read that a couple of Sundays ago what brought a brand name you know he he spoke there he says uh [Music] I should have added this is all part from the same message but he was speaking here in you know and and trying to uh come for the church and make uh the the sisters to know then he says I hope our sisters will understand and out of there which of course I'm very sure that you are you are acquainted with amen okay let's just go to what we we send out there you grab the thought as we go along now he says but in the human race he's talking talking about uh uh is dealing with the subject of beauty and it's it is all about the woman here is the woman that's pretty now the man if he is there is something wrong amen there there is cross up see somewhere originally is that way in a sense like in every in every uh other uh uh species you realize the rooster and the hand you look at the The Lion and the Lioness and all of that he described that he says but when it comes to the human race the the woman was uh she was designed to be praying over in uh in uh Cod brother Branham says that's the makeup of the woman she can't help it she want to be pregnant that is the way she was made he says uh this is it is not bad if she you know will present herself decent it's just that she must not be like uh you know how like he said like a magnet passing through a tencent stone you know he says a magnet passing through a tensing Soul he says it just it just get it grabbed to anything you know and sticking on and Shining all over the place he she must not be like that but it's her makeup for her to be pretty praise the Lord that's the way that she's made now so he goes on yet he says uh he said wow was it done to deceive by her designer Satan is still working on her too in this last day praise the Lord the increase of of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception when did the church look any more prettier than it does today everything is fish is featuring great now I know when uh when you when we read there to deceive by her design or Satan now that's that's the place that I want to dwell on tonight because you see the uh that expression actually has made some people around the message believe that Satan is the one that designed the woman and gave her her future which of course is wrong I want to address that by the word tonight praise the Lord because I don't believe that's what brother Branham is teaching I can show you right in the scripture where he designed a woman Genesis chapter 3 let's go there because I've always I've always uh I've always uh fuss with this even though as as human we are the we are the the highest expression of God's creation amen because man was made in His image but if you look if you if you try to look at it in science life you will see that I mean generally the uh uh you look at the mail the way that God designed the mail and the way he designed the female you will see that uh uh even down in the animal life he gives uh you know everything that the female animal needs to be a mother to her to her little ones that's the same way he gives to the human everything that that the male uh needs to be a father you know that's the same thing so if if we get into that place and uh the the scriptures is let's let's just read yeah I'm figuring all over the place foreign was more subtitled than any beast of the field which the Lord God has made and he said unto the woman and he said unto the woman ye have God said ye shall not eat of every tree and a woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the tree we might eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said God have said ye shall not eat of it neither touch at least your dad and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God for God does know they are in the day so what is he this what is he doing he's designing the mind of the woman to get off the promise praise the Lord amen he's designing the mind of the woman to get off of the sacredness of God's word and what is he going to do design the mind of the woman to look her filth right taking her mind off of the original promise of God's word to introduce felt right I'll believe there's there's how he designed a woman I would not want to believe is is her makeup praise the Lord I will tell you I will tell you why I don't believe there because I have seen some of the devilish acts that have been behind these teachings some of the degrading art that have been behind this teaching praise the Lord because it is something that Society have struggled with Society have struggled with it in the fact that because of the misconception just like brother Brandon will says the Mist teaching that has been around misinterpretation of theologic that's the same thing that I brought a misconception and Mesa are teaching even even in the cyclone and traditional word what makes a uh uh other tribes and other religion struggle with the female praise the Lord it all goes back to this because if we don't understand if we don't understand and don't take God's word for what it says the Bible says Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 when God said let us make man in our image God made man male and female that's what the scripture says he make man male and female praise the Lord I mean cultures have struggled with it religion has struggle with it and I believe that uh this message is the law of Liberty that must set us free are we together because you will look and and and and and in that way that throughout the entire Bible it has been looked at that way because of the misinterpretation that comes from Genesis not understanding that uh uh that that that the woman was a part of the the the the the the original thought of God of creation when God was expressing that image in flesh is just the sequence that he expressed the man all of these things brother Branham will explain it to us and make us to understand it was all part of God's Plan of Redemption we'll read it right here this evening in God's Great design he designed it that way it was never to make the woman a second class or a cast down and that is the thing that Society has struggled with all of the thing we are struggling with uh LGBT and and uh uh uh Sexes and all of the things that we are struggling with it all comes goes back to this praise the Lord now so brother man let's let's read here now let's let's read and and uh uh and and follow the thought here but I had to I had to dash back because I didn't wanted to leave a question in your mind why was it done he said to deceive by for designer Satan is still working on her too in this last day how is he doing it is he shaping her body how is he doing he's doing it by perverting her mind when her body is supposed to be the temple of God when she's supposed to Value the three sacred virtue that God has given her she's using her body as a means of survival she was not made for that purpose are we together the increase of being of the of the beauty of the woman is showing the time of deception when did the church looks any more prettier than it is today everything is featuring great big fine building and you know millions of days and millions of that don't you see she their uh deception now there is nothing can stop like her and she is designed so that she can be deceiving and Satan is really working on her today in this last day because he is her designer I can prove that now to go right back at the beginning who started to work on her how did he start to work on her on her mind that's right here in Genesis chapter 3. it's not in Genesis chapter 2 it's not in Genesis chapter one it's right here in Genesis chapter 3 how he starts to work on her on her mind to take up mine from the original picture of God's word and put her mind on the field of the flesh I don't have anything to do with the the create you you cannot make Satan her creator to believe that Satan gave her her physical future you are making Satan her creator brother never said Creator he said designer go right back to the beginning who started to work on her Adam or Satan why did he say Adam or Satan what is he coming back to Genesis chapter 3. praise the Lord do you think that Adam had to preach to her no I don't never had to preach to her because why she was taking out of him that's why they were co-equal right Adam never had to set her down and says you know uh uh uh uh you know God said we shouldn't do this you know uh God said we can speak we we can name that he didn't have to do it why because they were all both honor the same Covenant they were co-equal so he did not have to preach to her he did not have to teach her the man the woman like Paul says if the woman wants to learn anything let her ask her husband at home why because it goes back to Genesis 3 15 your husband will be the ruler that was a different Covenant that was a covenant after the fall that was when now God subject her to her husband to to for him to have the ruler over her praise the Lord now so why didn't uh uh uh uh so now you see here he says uh I can prove that to you go right back to the beginning who started to work on her Adam was hit on God or sit and see that's her designer is her Chief weapon to troll man to her to her field so so just just see where he's getting to see where he's underlining it will explain itself to make you to see what the prophet was saying do you know how many people this statement stumble that struggle with this so what is brother Branham online here what is he underlining that's her designer is her Chief weapon to throw men to her self that's what he's underlining when God made Eve in the beginning she was not filthy she was not filthy she never came from the hands of God as a fallen woman until she was deceived praise the Lord I will prove it to you also by size no girl is born from their mother broken no every girl that is born she's born she's born a virgin until her mind is perverted are we together it is our chief weapon to throw man to her failed being a pretty woman she she can sweat a man in a way she wants her brother any way she wants a brother is Aunt uh the the bootleg joined down here that gets the man is the pretty woman walking down the street twisting herself half dress that's the deceiver right there and she is dealing with it absolutely dealing she's dealing with what decent dress what is she dealing with what did he say is it not on the ball can you not answer me why is she dealing with half dress that's what he's talking about so every time I see point this out he he goes to uh uh the falling state of the woman every time he talks about deceiving he talks about the falling state of the woman today are we together you have to know that the devil is religious he's very religious brother Branham said he knew the principle of life amen he's very religious he's too bad like I've always always uh expressed yet he's too bad and and and there was there was there was nothing that made him so angry then when he heard God especially let's make man in our image amen and uh and and and and and then he stood by and and saw uh how God brought for all the creation and and and that God will create a darkness and God will pour the entire uh Universe to sleep to be able to bring out this woman that they ever knows there is something about the woman if he can get her in his hands he can be able to turn God's even upside down he knew that praise the Lord and being religious he had right on that to deceive every religion every religion I will tell you that is Christianity honor the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pour value on women every religion looks at a woman as a second class praise the Lord amen Israel is is Christianity honor the Baptist in honor the leadership of the Holy Ghost there are Parts the right value of God on the woman praise the Lord if you don't see their sheets of blessing rather you go into struggle with your wife if you don't see that she's a blessing you're going to even struggle with the way that God is dealing with you because the way that God is dealing with you you come under the female aspect you're going to deal you're going to struggle the way God is dealing with you nothing wrongs in tribal spirits around the world until different tribes they're all created for for male if you have a female child it looks like you don't you don't even have a child foreign from the beginning praise the Lord well I don't know if you were expecting this for communion service but however I won't take the entire evening foreign true praise the Lord that I call it a perverted understanding of Truth it's a perverted it's a limited understanding of Truth if you go back and really understand Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 if you go back and study it and understand that that was the expression of God that's what his El Shadel because in God the place that gave life Jesus said how I will have longed to Harbor you not like the rooster but like the hand however her Young let me tell you is God that puts value because he knows the value of the woman and if you don't allow God to put value on you you want to look for some kind of a man or some kind of for media to put value on you or some kind of for culture you will be a lost being praise the Lord because in all of the way that the word is struggling for equality there is an evil see that is sold that they don't believe what they are struggling for they think they believe it they don't believe it let me go quickly because we will not get through everything or else who have to read the entire marriage and that voice message to you tonight brother Graham says may look at Natural Beauty it's deceiving and that's why a woman is giving that beauty amen follow the thought now looks at natural beauty is deceiving that's why the woman was giving their beauty for deception to deceive a beautiful woman if she don't use it in the right way is a curse to her that would send her to Hell quicker than anything else I know of why because there is a three sacred virtue that would be perverted that's why we sent her to hell is the misuse of the The Virtue because the reason why God gave it to you to to the woman it was because of his purpose praise the Lord for life for Redemption so the misuse of that and that's the reason why God will send any creature to hell is because of the misuse of his word man would go to hell if he misuse his authority right sir are we together I want I want you to see uh what what I wanted them I was I was hoping and praying for is for you to just see that this thing is not just it's not just a statement there that you struggle with but for you to see it from the place where it comes from the culture and it's in in the religion you know and and and just how it is the beautiful place the beautiful expression of God bringing his first daughter do you do you imagine in your mind how it breaks the Father's Heart what it is to almighty God praise the Lord when brother Brandon made their statement a chain is only strong at its week of Link praise the Lord that's what it took to break God to make him to condescend it is that expression of the woman go ahead he says yeah now notice but God is future in character there is no beauty that we should desire Jesus but there's never was a character like him on the Earth and what are the three virtues surrounded character praise the Lord the inventors motherhood Womanhood what is that character that's just all a horse praise the Lord now we find out today the church the church character Satan and his group look after big beautiful churches beautiful things that's what the word looks at today all is the person and great so and so and so pray so Godly walking out and and big Robin and I don't even know why I put this yet is is not driving my touch but the real sense of God looks for the character of the Vindicated word okay now I know why I put it in yeah amen because it's it's not it's not the physical building amen is now what the church has in terms of musician or our organization the world what the the real believer should be attracted to is the Vindication of God's word is God bringing his word to pass in our midst if not we have no reason being here if God is now fulfilling his word in our mess in this assembly we don't have a reason to exist that's what we must be looking for praise the Lord a pure picture of the church today that we stand by the word we know is going to be made vedicated we know it's coming into Power some days praise the Lord amen how soon and yeah I'm I'm just getting down here you may ask me why did he permit her to be designed us why did God do it I don't want to take too much time because I got a lot more to say why the question might arise then why did God make this woman like this so look at now what brother Brandon is talking about here why did God make this woman like this then he said her designer is Satan can can you look at that just look at that thought and bring it back to the word sure praise the Lord are we together it's it's almost like if I want to take it into uh into the this this line of thought for you to be able to see it uh uh it's it's like uh engineering now the the designer has the thought in this mind amen he pulls everything down there on uh on on on paper and you have the people that do the building the construction and put the you know everything together now let's go ahead he says why did he permit her to be designed us why did God make this woman like this why did he permit her to be made like that it was for his own good pleasure it was for his own good pleasure praise the Lord amen now you get there to to Isaiah 53 where the Bible expressed that the pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hands wish me everything that Jesus will go through to be rejected to be beating to you know the bloody up and taking off his being and all of that all of those things will fulfill the pleasure of the Lord and God had a pleasure it was for his own good pleasure what was that pleasure that we all know the making noon of his attributes he was he just didn't want us to be limited with the knowledge that that the Angels know him for just as a holy God he wanted us of his children to know him as a savior as a deliverer as a Healer are we together now brother Brandon will says that it was for his own good pleasure sure now if you want to turn to Romans chapter 9 amen Romans chapter 9 let's turn dead and then we will close our service tonight praise the Lord if we had the need to pick up on their thought again like I've said listen to the tips and now if you have a question write it down we'll talk about it if I can answer your question publicly I will answer it personally if I feel the need be praise the Lord now Paul will come over here in Romans chapter 9 he's just coming out of Romans uh chapter 8 where he uh expressed this great toll if God be for us who will be against us amen and he spoke about predestination he spoke about God love for us you know in all of that now he comes over here to uh to uh Romans chapter nine let's read quickly and then I will I would close here so we can get into our community service I say the truth in Christ align that my conscience also bearing witness of witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continuing sorrow in my heart now he's you know he's coming to this place of uh looking at election he's coming to this great place of looking at election for Ayah for I could wish that myself were occurs from Christ for my brethrens my my case men are calling to the flesh oh I'm an Israelite of whom pertaining their adoption and the glory and the Covenant and the giving of the Lord and the service of God and the promises who rules are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed forever amen praise the Lord man he will get down to talking about uh Abraham and all of that he would get you would get right into the subject of election that's where the scripture will let us know that uh you know God says I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy are we having whom are we having you know he gets right into that place where the Potter cannot say to the clay why you make me dance now so you see brother Branham is making us to understand year that it was for God's Own pleasure amen he being the great Potter praise the lord we just have to follow we have to follow to see what he wanted to achieve and a way to follow him is to is to follow his Plan of Redemption because that's where he brought everything down to him his Plan of Redemption he helped us for us to be able to see the fall in in Genesis praise the lord we can see the fall in Genesis and and we we don't become just like other uh unbelievers that we says well I mean what did the God make why did God make the devil right why did God make man to fall why because we have followed we have we have had the grace to be able to see the big picture praise the Lord and here Isaiah the prophet talking to Israel and showing Israel you being the people of God you have gone from one captivity to another captivity being the people of God that saw the hand of God that God called Our Father Abraham and yet we have gone through all of these things that we have gone through but yet he's able to say to them your maker is your husband the one that have made you the one they have designed you for you to have gone through everything that you have gone through he's the one that have drawn you to himself in the book of Hosea he's he expressed to Ezra through the prophet who's here he says I'm the one that have wounded you I will heal you you say I have wounded you I will heal you praise the Lord now so you see you have to see you have to see the big picture for you to appreciate why he gave us wounds because he's a Healer why he allowed us to go through what we we go through because he's able to make it right it's not because we are cast of or we are we are we are we as we are second grade I mean the way over the years people ride on this thing the woman uh uh uh as a byproduct now whereby Proto will just misunderstood and misuse but you know why I was driving it it was this same old devilish thought it was the same or devilish thought that the woman was not in the original creation so she's looked down she will always fail that's the reason why she was never allowed to go to school in the beginning she was always kept behind it is where that thought is coming from praise the Lord it almost sounds to me like she's Satan's child praise the Lord you know what I'm saying this is is because there are very same thoughts that have affected the society has also affected the church it's worth the same teaching that says the days of Miracle is passed praise the Lord you can never amount to God's holiness you can never live right you cannot live above sin we are all sinners is the same old thought the same way the devil Rob Eve he robbed Eve and design her mind that's where the designer was he took her mind from the purity of God's word and put it on fleshly felt right praise the Lord we we we we will never be able to rise to to the image of God or rise to the potential where God want us to be if we don't keep our eyes on the word if you keep your eyes on the flesh you will keep filling you will keep feeling praise the Lord you keep your eyes on what people says you will keep feeling you got to keep your eyes on God's word because your maker it's your bridegroom praise the Lord your maker is your bridegroom when brother Branham talks about that story about that little prince that went down there in Chicago and looking for the bride and he saw that that that girl and uh like a Cinderella story and watching beaches and going out and and then he disguised himself he hire everything to make her a princess he had what it takes to make her a princess that's the reason why he never went down looking for fine dress because he had what it takes to give her fine dress he was not looking for high he because he had what it takes to give her high heels he was not looking for you know how she did her hair because he had what it takes to make her what he want her to be praise the Lord so what was he looking for he was looking for a character that was submit to his authority a character that was submit to the world that's what God is looking for praise the Lord I hope that this is on YouTube because I know I would get in trouble for it there are people that don't like you to preach this because they think that you are feminists when you preach truth like this praise the Lord and we are the same people that are looking for Revival we are looking for the power of God and brother Branham says when the bride know who she is I want you to know who you are that you are not set on design you are not a church design you are not a man design you are almighty God designed that's by our history foreign [Music] father Lord Jesus precious Lord sometimes we listen to the tips loading listening to the prophet of a truth Lord God sometimes brother Brandon Wright gets right down on that trail and he's grounding sin and he's dealing with thanks Lord father how many times lord the devil hover over us Lord and just make us to feel condemned when that is the very messenger you said Lord behold I send you Elijah the prophet and Lord God he was to bring us out he was to lift us up he was to deliver us by the message of the hour father oh God I prayed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ o god father may you bring that Liberty to God father I know Lord this will be stretch Lord guarding in no way Lord God I want I'm I'm promoting a women movement or women liberation that's not what it is Lord it's just to be able to look at some truth because we know father your Prophet said Lord these truth will held down at the river of euphriti demon powers Lord have the truck the church back from its truth I pray to God I pray to father thank you I pray Lord Jesus may your grace just move in a special way Lord and help us Lord father help us Lord [Music] to learn to appreciate you father appreciate you Lord God for the way you made us Lord even father Lord God if we have disability at all if there is an area in our life of God what it seems like we have come short Lord oh Father we won't cast ourselves down lord for we will know that you made us for the purpose Lord you made us for the purpose you made us for your pleasure fathers oh God father O Father O Father foreign Lord enculture and all of these things that's the word that we live in O Father we struggle with these things Lord we struggle with these things so father [Music] but you are you are making us Lord and teaching us we are learning to appreciate you let's stand on our feet let us live for Holy hands and worship Christ Our King Jesus Christ the Lord amen and worship him I just want us to thank him in our own way let us live for Holy hands magnified his name and worship him let us [Music] magnified his name and worship Christ the Lord oh worshiping Jesus Christ the world father we just thank you Lord we thank you Father Lord take the thought from My Heart Lord and Ministry to the children Lord father Lord I want I want us to be able to see the value that you have bestowed upon us Lord that father our value is not man's interpretation our value to god father it is not how men look upon us Lord brother Brandon talking about that he says men look at the outward Beauty he said when Samuel went down to the house of Jesse Jesse brought all of his sons and never even thought about David he never even remembered that David was his son because he was thinking about a king would be a man with muscles and a man that is all dead and a man that is he never even thought about David when God was looking at the character that has been built in the heart of that little boy because of all of his struggle being despised being rejected God put you in a situation that he put you in because he want to build a very strong character in you a character where you will ever trust God foreign [Music] how we long to wash [Music] [Music] to wash you Heavenly Father thank you Lord for grace that have found us Lord thank you Father Lord for the value of the blood that you have put upon our life for God you put the value of your own blood Lord Jesus oh God that's the value you have put Upon Our Lives oh God and you wrote on our forehead that we are not for sale we cannot be sold father God to man's theologic lord soul to man's doctrine of god father we cannot be sold even Lord father to this present Society because they don't have what it takes law to purchase us we are not for sale thank you foreign bless the rest of the service now it's about to go into communion tonight we ask that you will bless us Lord bless us in your presence bless us oh God we thank you we appreciate you father we glorify your name tonight in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen [Music] [Music] let's take our Bibles let's go to the book of Corinthians just on the news a couple of days ago because of all of the suppression First Corinthians chapter 11 all the suppression over there in Iran and in Iraq or or the the Muslim world that I have in all of these things a young lady ran from her parents and went back to she went over to Turkey and she was living there then and uh trying to break away from the life of suppression that she's being honored and she uh you know parents up there was not happy with her and I think she went back home just just being a girl trying to get back home to see her parents and all of that her dad killed her and turned himself into the police [Music] reason why the devil went after Eve even though he don't understand it [Music] praise the Lord but you just you think about it you think about it a father you are you all are there and your father just called one of your inner room say close the door and you don't know what they talk about there is always that curious thought why Daddy call this one why [Music] for God to to send the entire creation to sleep to bring out Eve that makes Satan jealous he knew there was something about the woman he don't know what it was but he knew that if he can get on her there is something about the woman that God will shove the entire creation just like when when uh Joshua says stands there [Music] even when we come together in few numbers we might be four or five Jesus said wherever two or three I gather in my name it's not the great numbers that make the church is there two or three that comes with determined heart to be able to pause their shoulder to the wheels to stand for God's word [Music] you feel you follow things in the Middle East you hear the counter for abuses that is that is that is that is all out there that is happening in our way [Music] let me not get away from my subject tonight I think I have preached enough average enough let's read our our scripture tonight First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23. let me now get it [Music] I mean I get into this foreign [Music] in parents you know what they would say he said boy you get out there but when they when when there is something happening around the guild and it's like the parents guess never just and and not what Tim didn't say the boy can go out and fool around and and become stupid and that was part of the family name when a girl goes around and and she goes and do something or maybe get pregnant it brings a big blame on the family why because there is something in a woman that reflects she's made with a nature that reflects brother Branham says our attitude brings a reflection it tells people whether we are Christian or not there is just something about the female attitude that reflects you can dress you wear the necktie and everything and and uh you know you dress smart and people would just says well are you working in the bank but when a woman dressed decent what is it she's a Christian it's one of those those holy Holiness people that's the first thing they throw on her is one of those Holiness people I think she's a Christian praise the Lord why because God placed in your nature flesh okay okay let's read verse 24 verse 23 for I for I receive of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus Christ the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he have stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me for us often as yet eat this bread and drink this cup it do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord on watering shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup for he that eat it and drinketh on Walt till it eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat let's just go to the Lord in prayer pray for me and I pray for you let's pray for those that are not here with us tonight let's pray for the assembly [Music] even though not directly like like brother Steve said this morning when he was praying we are so connected as a body that when one hurt we all feed the hurt but the few ones that have been having losses in their family even though in distance but yet we feel it I just pray this prayer if you have the law would just bring different wants to your mind tonight you know whenever we come to this moment this time of praying is not it's not time for you to pray for yourself you got to find someone to pray for there's more this time of praying for the communion you have to believe that somebody is praying for you and you find someone to pray for it helped us to break away from our selfishness [Music] remember others as we believe that they'll remember you let's
