========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some of the finest boys that I ever met their man uh that I've ever met and just quickly just as soon as they heard the message they were sold on it 100% now that can only come by for ordination the only way it can come now the question is here I thinking that see not why the Lord was bring me back and know it knowest know it not th naked miserable wretched blind and know it not before I get to that spot I might brief what I said a few days ago heing a message on I believe it was the uh God of this world blinded the eyes of the people that they absolutely worshiped the devil in religious Services did you all get that all of you understood it and then in that same message I brought the subject that a woman wearing immoral clothes indecently she is be judged at the Judgment bar as a street prostitute that sounds awful strange let me draw you a little picture now here is an attorney in the city a young fell and he's a nice man as far as as politically I imagine he may be decent any his politics and then um he goes with a girl that's very popular they fall in love and marry they T to all the parties and the great uh things and they all drink together finally she uh has a nice home he lives in a nice neighborhood he's well thought of amongst the people but he both of them drink she wears shorts cuts her hair wears makeup everything just as sexi beautiful woman displaying herself well she never goes to church at all neither one of them so moving next door to him comes a woman from the Baptist Church or the Methodist Church her and her husband now this woman uh let's make it Methodist because the Methodist sco a little more on Holiness than the Baptist all except the New Testament Baptist they believe in Holiness but usually Baptist don't go for Holiness at all see they don't believe in such a thing so then now let's make it Methodist cause to believe in Holiness and uh then a Methodist woman moves next door to this woman on the same street her husband is um let's say he's a public accountant and uh or some office well this Methodist woman looks over to the other woman and when this lawyer goes out of town say his name is John say his name is John now don't presume on that now I miss taking fiction names now and his name is John well she used to go with Ralph and that's fiction name all of it see just so you get the story to make the picture well first thing you know at a drunken party Ralph hugs her again well she gets all fired up because she's in love again with Ralph she think things then after a while Ralph begins to meet her and she can put it over John pull it over his eyes and she thinks she's pretty smart duck because she can run with Ralph married to John see the woman don't even have a very bearing of decency and she thinks nothing about that but this Methodist woman has raised up in another bracket she does at least go to church chur and she thinks that that woman is horrible while she says to her husband when he comes in I see that man go in there and meet her and when John's out on a Case somewhere Philadelphia somewhere he takes her out in this Roadster and they lay out on the beach I see him come home don't even pull the curtains down sometime kissing her and making love to her next door oh isn't that awful she says to her husband well she's nothing but a public prostitute it's true she's worse than a public prostitute because she's a married woman and she U This Woman This Methodist woman thinks that's horrible she never goes to church now this Methodist woman would not do a thing like that no indeed she's a decent woman and another thing she would not touch a bit of whiskey because the Methodist Church 90% of their program is probation against whiskey against whiskey so they got a pro program and them people of that Methodist Church don't live no higher than that church teaches but this same woman this Methodist woman goes out of an evening with her husband wearing shorts on Sunday after Sunday school she cuts her hair she wears lipstick and even smokes a little now in God's word there are both prostitutes right but this one here is naked miserable wretched blind and don't know it one's just as guilty as the other for a man that looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart and if this woman now she'd say wait just a minute Mr brandom I'll give you to understand I am no prostitute my sister maybe if you'd be tucked before a Bible and put your hands up on the presence of God and swear that you've been this this true true your husband as you could be your body belongs to your husband but your soul belongs to God there is a evil spirit that's ano you if that if you're not then you're I can prove that you're totally insane what would happen your grandmother should walk down on the street with them shorts on that have put her an insane institution she come out without her dress on there's something wrong with her mind if it was so then it's so now amen so it throws the whole world into Insanity amen the whole thing's insane and it's so gradually crap until the people don't know it now is she a prostitute not by her husband bow to her body but before God she's got a evil prostitute Spirit on her that makes her dress like that and she's in the lady of seean church agent and don't know that she's doing that the innocent woman don't know that God will judge her for a prostitute there you are you get it to her you can't tell her there's no way of getting it to her the Bible said they're naked and don't know it amen amen if you call her a prostitute personally she have you arrested she would I never talk personally about anybody I talk about Sin I don't say this certain Church Mr so and so very Reverend so and so he's a no no I say that the doctrine of that see the whole thing together I don't call individual it's not individuals it's the system that they're in it's a world system brother George right sitting here's 75 or 78 years old I guess what would you think would have happened if you don't went to see sister right someday she' been standing in a pair of shorts well You' have never You' have you'd have had the woman locked up You' you have never married her well if any young man in that day would have done it the same thing would have took place well if it was sin and wrong then it's the same thing but the people has growed into Insanity Amen Let Me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass a whole world is grouping in insanity and will get worse and worse and worse I'm telling you be a bunch of Maniacs it's almost that way now could you imagine a man driving with his lights off on the wrong side of the road a Ricky young kid supposed to be right out of high school kill a bunch of people is that stop him the next him come right behind him doing the same thing can you imagine a young man that thinks any anything of himself getting out here and acting the way they do could you imagine a young woman and the bloom of Womanhood beautiful well built shaped profile face beautiful and the very thing of her being pretty shows that we're to end time see she's went all together to worldly feature wory things and not the beauty of Holiness amen Sweetness in her oh I've seen women on the outside of them wasn't nothing to look at but you speak to them one time talk to them a few minutes they're real genuine something that you can't get away from see beauty of the outside is of the devil it's of the world look at King's Children how they went into it when the sons of God saw the daughters of man were Fair they taken under them wives and God never did forgive them look at them Israelite women with with calloused hands and hair stringing when them sons of God came up through the land of boab and met them daining women with wh set hair fcy and a lot of manicure on their faces or what you call it and when them sons of God saw those real fair women a false prophet said we're all the same that's right and they married among them and God never did forgive them they perished in the wilderness every one of them died there without hope without God and eternally lost D forever though they had seen the goodness of God though they had drank from the fountain that never runs dry they drun from the smitten Rock they had seen the brass serpent perform Miracles that come out from under the baptism of Moses and the Sea they had seen the hand of God that eat Angels food and had done all those things but married in that women bring them in and marry among them not commit adultery just marry among them God never did forgive it that's the second time it met now here we are on third time more deceiving now than ever I know that's hard and I've often wondered in many ways how will it ever be why do I have to talk so IAL to people what makes it so and yet I noticed if it wasn't God there wouldn't be nobody not a woman who sit and listen at me amen but they come back amen because there's somebody that's got a little anchor of Truth there that knows that that's right regardless they know it's right now watch what happened I know it's hard it's just like if a doctor give you medicine you refuse to take it then don't blame the doctor if you die and this is like medicine what about these people they always claim to me to be a woman hater you see you just watch the way the women act I'll show you where the church is the women morals isn't lady oia in the world physically naked miserable blind and don't know it the CH the people the women of the world and the church is in the same stage watch's the natural type the spiritual right through each time now someday at the Judgment bar I know it's not popular to say it and if a man's not already to say it you better not say it because you're impersonating and then you'll get in trouble sure enough now notice I'm actually she looked like in times held a woman's mouth open and poured the medicine in her mouth and then hold my hands over her mouth and she'll spin it out every time what if a doctor did that to a patient then the patient died because they refused to swallow the medicine at the Judgment bar when all these things like cutting hair and wearing shorts and I'm only building the hours coasted hand when you're going to see something happen when something's going to take place in all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that'll shake the whole Nations why I've been picking on women it's just been laying up here for something that you can hit it around the head with it even trying to tell them watch TR holding the hand down like guess this what mouth just spit it out then who can blame the doctor how are you going to say at the day of the judment when the very voices is cried out against it or play the record right back in the face of the people then how are they going to get away from it spit it out between your fingers pour some more down and finally shake their head and re go back and go back W do it get you come back again and pour it in again then who's to blame not the doctor not the medicine but the attitude of the person exactly be a horrible day one of these days when this sinful adulter this generation stands before almighty God I see my ears creeping up my shoulders stooping and I know 30 years here in this platform here 33 years here on the field a that's a long life that's 33 years of service only one recret I have that I didn't have 133 years of it or this will be the last opportunity I'll ever have while you're Mart to preach the gospel God help me to stand true as true can be to that word say justice he says what made that Methodist woman how could you ever get a tour here she is that lady of see a church agent now we'll take the Pentecostal woman she shouldn't wear shorts make up or cut her hair but she looks back down at the Methodist say look at that woman do so and so say the woman don't wear shorts but she said and herself with bob hair right higher you riseing God the more sinful the whole thing looks and then sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the Holy Spirit take you up into a sphere then the whole thing looks chaos then when you come back down you seem like you're to the people you're a rascal that you're you're nothing but an old sarcastic you're a fool because you stand as an old crank and always rebuking the people or if you ever climb into them Spears one time where you can be in the presence of God not through emotion but to genuine Holy Spirit lifting up the whole thing is wrote eobot the glory of the Lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit that's right there none of them that's righty now let me draw you a little circle if I had a Blackboard but I want you to watch here I'm going to make one ring like this I'm going to make another ring on the inside inside of that ring that's two then I'm going to make a ring on the inside of that ring that's three rings three circles now that's you that's God God in a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God he can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit now let me draw you a little circle if I had a Blackboard but I want you to watch here I'm going to make one ring like this I'm going to make another ring on the inside of that ring that's two then I'm going to make a ring on the inside of that ring that's three rings three circles now that's you that's God God in a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God you can't be manifested any other way and neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are that's Body Spirit Soul without either one of them you're not complete amen see if you didn't have a soul you'd be nothing you didn't have a spirit you wouldn't be nothing if you didn't have a body you be a spirit not a body so God is complete in the tri Unity of a being not trunity of beings but one being in a trunity father Son and Holy Ghost is one true manifested God God notice sh this wait I I believe I read just a few minutes ago listen to this unto the angel of the Church of Lady oans write these

Colossians the book of Colossians and get the I believe it's the first chapter I'll have to look this because it's not premeditated here so I'll as I used to be when I was a young preacher I could
