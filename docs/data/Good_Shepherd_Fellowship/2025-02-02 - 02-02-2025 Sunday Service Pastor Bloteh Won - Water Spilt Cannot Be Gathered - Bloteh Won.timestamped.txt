[46:36] about it were just about 10 10:00
[46:40] between 10 and
[46:42] 10:30 I I I just fail to call brother
[46:44] Bill Young because I have not talked to
[46:46] him for a while to uh to uh to see how
[46:50] his wife was doing she was uh sick with
[46:53] pancreatic cancer we've been praying for
[46:55] her and I sat down to call him and then
[46:58] I thought about brother Clay farmer he
[47:00] too was not well so I decided to call
[47:03] brother Clay but I didn't get him I left
[47:04] a voicemail and then brother Bill Young
[47:07] went for my mind so uh uh when I went
[47:10] back to the office I thought oh yeah
[47:12] brother darl W also was now well let me
[47:15] check on him so when I called brother
[47:18] darl he's doing well stay coughing and
[47:21] he having a Shar pain in his chest he
[47:23] asked that we continue to pray for him
[47:25] and uh he also sent his greeting to the
[47:27] church and then right in the
[47:29] conversation he told me oh brother one
[47:31] uh uh uh I just got a got a uh someone
[47:36] just called my wife to let me know that
[47:38] sister Shelly has gone to be with the
[47:40] Lord that brother Bill Young's wife so
[47:43] she left her uh when I talked to him it
[47:46] was just
[47:47] 11:00 so I thought calling him between
[47:50] 10:00 and then just 11:00 she passed
[47:54] away and uh uh so they will be having
[47:57] the funeral tomorrow we want to hold
[47:59] them up in
[48:00] prayer and I trust that the Lord will
[48:04] will we really strengthened him it's I I
[48:07] was just I was just thinking I mean I
[48:09] was so I was I was just uh so
[48:11] overwhelmed until I just have to close
[48:14] work and and and come home but I was
[48:17] just thinking about just the past year
[48:20] brother Bill was so sick I remember the
[48:22] last time I was there for the funeral we
[48:25] had to literally told him in the cheer
[48:27] the brother and myself we had to T him
[48:29] up the hill you know to the gravide for
[48:32] him to do his pastoral Duty and then we
[48:35] have to T him down the hill he was
[48:37] sitting in the chair you know I was
[48:39] helping the brother Donnie and we were
[48:41] we we told him I mean he was so sick
[48:44] that every time sister shot would say to
[48:46] me she would say brother Wong I don't
[48:48] know what I would do if they'll go if
[48:50] they pass away she said I would just I
[48:53] would just lose it you know they were
[48:54] they were teenagers when they got
[48:56] married and uh so I was just thinking
[48:59] about that I was say I think the Lord it
[49:02] pleased the Lord to just flip it around
[49:05] knowing that she might not be able to
[49:07] handle it maybe the Lord choose to call
[49:09] her home sooner you know and uh but that
[49:14] was just my thought and uh it could be
[49:18] thousand miles away from the
[49:20] truth but uh uh they were they were very
[49:23] good very very good friends very very
[49:26] good friends I came to know them in a
[49:28] short period of time but uh I was so
[49:30] welcome in their home I mean I go and
[49:33] preach we would sit down at their table
[49:35] 2:00 a.m. in the morning they keep
[49:37] telling me stories you know when they
[49:39] were young when they got married and I
[49:41] mean all sorts of things and uh yeah so

[54:48] is the arm of the Lord reveal
[55:06] he is despised and rejected of man a man
[55:09] of sorrow and acquainted with grief and
[55:13] we hate as it were our faces from him he
[55:17] was despised and we esteem him that
[55:32] let's read together but he was wounded
[55:35] for our
[55:36] transgression he was bruised for our
[55:39] iniquity the chasman of our peace was
[55:42] upon him and with his strives we are
[55:45] healed amen let's turn to Matthew
[55:48] chapter
[55:50] 8 Matthew chapter 8 praise the Lord
[56:08] praise the
[56:14] Lord Matthew chapter 8 let's read from
[56:17] verse
[56:19] 14 and when Jesus was come into Peter's
[56:22] house he saw his wife mother
[56:26] and sake of fever I don't know how the
[56:30] Catholic can read this and think that
[56:32] Peter was the first pope or first priest
[56:35] because yeah he was married he had a
[56:37] wife his mother-in-law was
[56:41] sick and he and he touched her hand and
[56:45] uh and the fever left her Jesus touched
[56:48] her hand and the fever left her and she
[56:50] arose and Minister unto unto them
[56:57] when the evening was come they brought
[56:59] unto him many that were possessed with
[57:04] devils and he cast out the spirit with
[57:08] his word praise the Lord the preaching
[57:12] of the word is always the casting out of
[57:15] spirit amen he cast out the spirit with
[57:20] his word and heal all that were
[57:24] sick that it might be fulfilled which
[57:28] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet
[57:31] saying himself took our
[57:34] infirmities and bear our sickness praise
[57:39] the lord we ask God to add blessings to
[57:42] the reading of his word in Jesus name
[57:45] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[57:48] your
[57:49] seat praise the
[57:51] Lord amen you know I I just I just
[57:55] learned uh recently uh that uh uh the
[57:59] the Jews the they
[58:02] normally will prayed after
[58:05] meal we pray before
[58:10] meal I learned that they normally pray
[58:13] after
[58:14] meal so I was thinking about it I say I
[58:17] say how how how fitting it is that uh
[58:21] you know we pray at the beginning of the
[58:23] word and then we pray at the end of the
[58:25] word so we f faing both Jews and Gentile
[58:27] approach you know we are praying before
[58:30] meal and then after meal and uh uh now
[58:34] so I I want to catch I want to just hold
[58:36] your attention on the thought that I
[58:38] want to go then I go into my you know my
[58:41] my uh uh uh a talk that I want to get in
[58:45] before I come to preaching this morning
[58:48] we just read Isaiah chapter
[58:51] 53 and Isaiah chapter 53 was talking
[58:54] about the atonement
[58:56] amen he was wounded for our
[58:59] transgression he was bruised for our
[59:01] iniquity the CH tement of our peace was
[59:04] upon him and by his stripes we are
[59:07] healed praise the Lord it was a prophecy
[59:10] talking about the Fulfillment of the
[59:13] atonement everything that the Old
[59:15] Testament sacrifice represented was
[59:18] going to be fulfilled in
[59:20] Christ but this is what I want us to see
[59:23] y said in in in uh uh uh before Jesus
[59:28] died before the atonement before the
[59:31] lamb was crucified before he was hang on
[59:35] the cross the atonement was already in
[59:40] play are we
[59:42] together he was wounded for our
[59:44] transgression he was bruised for our
[59:46] iniquity but he had not been wounded yet
[59:49] on the cross he had not been bruised yet
[59:52] on the cross he had not been Smitten by
[59:55] God on the cross but yet the atonement
[59:57] was in
[1:00:00] place are you seeing the picture amen so
[1:00:04] just just hold that in your mind just
[1:00:07] keep that in mind I'll come back to that
[1:00:09] again because that's what I want to
[1:00:11] that's what I want to talk about and I'm
[1:00:14] continuing my uh my talk from Wednesday
[1:00:16] night uh where the water cannot be
[1:00:19] gathered that's what I want to continue
[1:00:22] uh uh this morning and really trust in
[1:00:25] the Lord to be able to help me to go in
[1:00:28] uh in a direction I will be able to
[1:00:30] edify you like I said Wednesday night if
[1:00:33] I came across like an angry preacher I
[1:00:35] was not angry you know I thought about
[1:00:37] that and and uh you know uh uh I mean my
[1:00:43] my my my children remind me all the time
[1:00:45] you know Dad why are you angry I say I'm
[1:00:47] not angry now but you talking like you
[1:00:50] angry praise the Lord so I mean I was I
[1:00:53] was not angry at all not you if I was if
[1:00:56] I should be angry it must be at the
[1:00:57] Devil amen I heard a preacher that says
[1:01:00] I wake up in the morning and I take all
[1:01:02] my anger on the devil before I goes
[1:01:05] out so uh
[1:01:09] uh uh I'm not sorry for what I preach
[1:01:13] but I sorry if my if my Approach came
[1:01:16] you know uh um different to
[1:01:20] you I have no reason to attack you from
[1:01:23] this poopy uh there is one thing I must
[1:01:26] be chasing must be uh devils not people
[1:01:29] amen you are God's Heritage you are the
[1:01:32] Sheep of his pasture and uh
[1:01:36] uh so uh uh Wednesday night Wednesday
[1:01:41] night if we if you want to throw your
[1:01:42] thought back a little bit Wednesday
[1:01:44] night we talk about Psalm 119 who all
[1:01:48] remember there who all went back and and
[1:01:51] look over s nting you know and uh uh uh
[1:01:55] did you did you enjoy it if you did it
[1:01:57] praise the Lord I see I saw uh hands
[1:02:00] going up there and and that's that's
[1:02:02] good and uh we were just talking about
[1:02:04] how beautiful that is the longest
[1:02:06] chapter in the Bible and uh uh uh the p
[1:02:09] is in that Bible uh beside two
[1:02:14] verses every other verse in that 170
[1:02:19] something verses in the Bible are all
[1:02:23] praises and the PSAL it used the Hebrew
[1:02:27] alphabet he broke it into 22 section of
[1:02:31] Hebrew alphabet eight verse a
[1:02:35] peace so so H H more com commentator
[1:02:40] thinks that uh uh it's a kind of a music
[1:02:42] thing that he
[1:02:45] did because a cord on the piano is done
[1:02:49] uh uh with Eight Keys when you do your
[1:02:53] D it's it amen oh my goodness my music
[1:02:57] thing is coming praise the Lord
[1:03:01] amen I can't wait for it to come I'll
[1:03:04] turn the preaching over to somebody
[1:03:06] else amen so uh you know he did it in in
[1:03:10] eight verses and it's it's very very
[1:03:14] very beautiful and uh and the the thing
[1:03:17] about it that is that the inspiration
[1:03:20] behind that is that uh there are there
[1:03:24] are many millions of different ways that
[1:03:28] we can we can lift our hearts To God In
[1:03:30] Praise millions of different ways that
[1:03:33] we can be able to you know uh uh uh send
[1:03:39] our prayers to God I knew about a young
[1:03:42] brother that uh came from a Catholic
[1:03:44] Family back in the aage course his
[1:03:46] parents used to used to give him hard
[1:03:49] time for coming to church I mean he used
[1:03:50] to sneak out of the house he would come
[1:03:52] and spend some few meetings in service
[1:03:54] some service and of that and then he
[1:03:56] will go but he he was he he had he just
[1:03:59] had his very beautiful uh Talent of
[1:04:02] writing p in every service he would
[1:04:05] write a word to the Lord you know he was
[1:04:09] he would give it to the deacons he says
[1:04:10] I want this to be read to my Lord you
[1:04:12] know he would just Express his gratitude
[1:04:15] you know and uh I mean it was just it
[1:04:17] was just beautiful it was just
[1:04:20] beautiful it was just beautiful and I
[1:04:23] and I think that's that's what God is
[1:04:25] calling us into now so when he did that
[1:04:28] I I I promise you that I was going to if
[1:04:31] if the if the technician can just throw
[1:04:33] my little picture up there I quickly
[1:04:35] caught one before I came out of the
[1:04:37] office I thought I had it in my in my in
[1:04:41] my note but I I didn't have it so I got
[1:04:43] I quickly screenshot it if you can just
[1:04:46] uh uh uh uh deem the light here now so
[1:04:50] you see all of this is the first letter
[1:04:53] in the Hebrew alphabet
[1:04:57] and what is beautiful here is that uh uh
[1:05:01] if you if you notice here you will see
[1:05:05] that
[1:05:07] uh uh you will see that
[1:05:11] uh the the the the the uh
[1:05:17] English we write from left to
[1:05:21] right okay Hebrew is reading from uh
[1:05:25] right to
[1:05:29] left and uh if you look at it actually
[1:05:33] you realize that all language go back to
[1:05:41] Jerusalem because uh you will see that
[1:05:45] uh the Nations that are west of
[1:05:50] Jerusalem they write from left to
[1:05:54] right like English Latin Spanish Russian
[1:05:59] they all ride from left to right and the
[1:06:03] the the Nations that uh uh east of
[1:06:07] Jerusalem right from right to
[1:06:11] left if you actually go back and study
[1:06:15] uh uh you'll realize that uh uh uh uh
[1:06:19] you go back in Genesis chapter 5 it
[1:06:22] talks about all the descendants of Adam
[1:06:24] it talks about
[1:06:26] uh uh Enoch and uh you know uh history
[1:06:29] says uh he's he he's the originator of
[1:06:37] language okay that's that is just uh you
[1:06:40] know uh uh a side piece so the the
[1:06:44] Arabic The the S strip of Egypt and uh
[1:06:49] uh the Hebrew all of them go from right
[1:06:52] to left and then English we all go from
[1:06:55] left to right so they all meet at
[1:06:59] Jerusalem so uh
[1:07:03] uh now so like I said uh this this is
[1:07:07] the first first uh letter in uh in uh
[1:07:11] Hebrew alphabet and the the
[1:07:14] sist were so determined you know this
[1:07:19] brings out that the story of that little
[1:07:21] boy that we we read on on Wednesday
[1:07:24] night it brings it out more more clear
[1:07:27] to
[1:07:28] us you know and and you you would think
[1:07:31] about it that brother Brandon mentioned
[1:07:34] that story and uh uh yeah I don't know
[1:07:36] whether he he you know uh uh uh he
[1:07:39] related to this I've never seen it in in
[1:07:42] the quats before but just to know that
[1:07:45] God himself had a design like that in
[1:07:49] his word that's the beautiful
[1:07:52] part that is the beautiful part you know
[1:07:56] so I mean it's so it's so beautiful it's
[1:07:59] so beautiful when by

[1:14:00] Saints praise the Lord amen that's how
[1:14:05] that's how how
[1:14:08] much prayer is
[1:14:11] important praise the Lord a man may not
[1:14:15] know how to read one verse in the Bible
[1:14:19] but a man that can come on speaking
[1:14:21] terms with God a man that is able to to
[1:14:25] get down on his knees and he know that
[1:14:28] he's not uttering vain words but he's
[1:14:31] having communion with his
[1:14:34] maker praise the
[1:14:40] lord we talk about sister jimama and and
[1:14:43] we all get excited about the
[1:14:46] story but that story will have never
[1:14:49] been wrden if she was not a woman of
[1:14:52] Prayer
[1:14:57] a woman that can be able to get down on
[1:14:59] her knees never have H H anything that
[1:15:02] could be distrib like this word home she
[1:15:04] had a little place that was decent
[1:15:06] rating God bless our home that was what
[1:15:09] was on the world but she knew how to
[1:15:11] talk to her
[1:15:12] maker and so much that God will give her
[1:15:18] a word God would give her a vision and
[1:15:21] describe a man of God you think about it
[1:15:25] it was in the time of
[1:15:27] segregation it was in the time when the
[1:15:30] nation was dealing with that but it did
[1:15:32] not matter to
[1:15:35] God God had a prophet on the land and
[1:15:38] God had a daughter of God that had that
[1:15:41] had a need God had a daughter of God
[1:15:44] that beli in
[1:15:47] him I am that shiming that woman where
[1:15:50] is my
[1:15:52] Elijah praise the Lord where is my
[1:15:57] Elijah she don't get time for all your
[1:16:00] message
[1:16:02] politics she got time for what the Bible
[1:16:05] says she could identify herself in the
[1:16:08] scripture and say I am that Lord I am
[1:16:12] there I look right in your word I'm
[1:16:14] theing that woman where is my
[1:16:20] Elijah praise the Lord yes the prophet
[1:16:23] of God that can see the Vision that can
[1:16:25] tell people the day they were born what
[1:16:27] happened in their life he had no idea
[1:16:30] not one idea of what was going
[1:16:34] on a a poor woman Faith was controlling
[1:16:41] him he had no idea that's how much
[1:16:45] prayer is important
[1:16:49] people let's not throw down the
[1:16:51] important things and start running after
[1:16:53] things
[1:16:55] that we can't grab this is what we must
[1:16:57] stand on you stand on Prayer by faith to
[1:17:00] be able to understand Revelation if now
[1:17:03] it just become a head knowledge it
[1:17:05] frustrates you because when you think
[1:17:07] you understand it then you read
[1:17:08] something else again it confus
[1:17:15] you the first thing that God will
[1:17:17] mention under the
[1:17:20] seals it's not the name of
[1:17:23] Elohim it's not the UNR name of
[1:17:28] God is the communion that he has with
[1:17:31] his
[1:17:33] children the love letters that he
[1:17:35] received from your
[1:17:38] heart he kept them under the
[1:17:42] seals praise the
[1:17:52] Lord praise the Lord
[1:17:58] you wake up in the
[1:18:00] morning and you say good morning Jesus
[1:18:03] good morning
[1:18:06] Lord to some
[1:18:09] people it's a never seen way to
[1:18:13] pray and we we must go through the seven
[1:18:16] Redemptive name you are Jehovah jarra
[1:18:18] you are Jehovah yeah he is I mean but if
[1:18:21] you saying all of those things just to
[1:18:24] show how how much of Redemptive names
[1:18:26] you know and it's not really connecting
[1:18:30] you you're not feeling the
[1:18:33] personer you're not feeling a personal
[1:18:36] that I'm talking to
[1:18:40] somebody then you just reciting
[1:18:45] words you are just reciting words
[1:18:58] praise the
[1:19:03] Lord I turn on my
[1:19:07] pillow when I spot the daylight I get so
[1:19:10] tired in my body like it was this
[1:19:13] morning just going in and out of
[1:19:17] sleep just I lay right
[1:19:20] there and I remember many years back
[1:19:28] the thought trouble
[1:19:31] me I always used to say to myself Lord
[1:19:34] what what happened when it ever gets to
[1:19:36] the place that maybe something happened
[1:19:39] to me and I you know my knees is bad and
[1:19:42] I can't get on my knees because I mean
[1:19:44] uh as a as a young believer I spend many
[1:19:47] time many many hours on my knees I were
[1:19:50] influenced by the by the book that I
[1:19:52] read by Ian bounds
[1:19:55] power to
[1:19:59] pray I I would stay six hours on my
[1:20:03] knes praying but it it was all it always
[1:20:07] used to bother me
[1:20:09] because when I lay down on my bed to
[1:20:12] pray I get so
[1:20:15] distracted unless I take that position I
[1:20:18] don't feel comfortable but then I always
[1:20:20] say to myself Lord this should not be
[1:20:22] the only way I should pray I should be
[1:20:25] able to lay down I remember going to
[1:20:27] seon one time and brother Elijah and
[1:20:29] myself travel and we were coming back I
[1:20:32] was so tired so the brother that was
[1:20:34] taking us back to the Border because we
[1:20:36] went through the Border uh uh so we we
[1:20:40] we got to a place that we were going to
[1:20:41] sleep that ran a hotel and uh uh uh and
[1:20:46] I was tired so I told Brother
[1:20:48] Elijah and the brother they wanted to go
[1:20:50] walk around the time I told him no I'm
[1:20:52] I'm tired I'm not going anywhere y' can
[1:20:54] go I will stay right here and for the
[1:20:57] first time for the first time I will lay
[1:21:01] down on a
[1:21:03] pillow and I will have such a communion
[1:21:06] with God for the first time I will lay
[1:21:09] down on the pillow and start praying and
[1:21:12] and feel like I'm praying I'm
[1:21:16] talking now my mind floating all over
[1:21:19] the place I've really struggled I'm
[1:21:20] telling you I'm telling you something
[1:21:22] it's a it's it's a real thing because in
[1:21:25] my mind I I thought that no I mean uh
[1:21:29] kneeling down yeah is you you are being
[1:21:32] obedience you are worshiping the Lord
[1:21:34] but I mean uh it should not be the only
[1:21:37] way to
[1:21:39] pray the Bible says let men stand
[1:21:41] lifting up holy
[1:21:44] hands so standing is also a position to
[1:21:48] pray praise the Lord whether the person
[1:21:51] can sit whether they can lay it on the
[1:21:53] floor whether they can kneel on their
[1:21:56] knees praise the
[1:21:59] Lord it is just that place
[1:22:03] where a son and you know I mean just
[1:22:07] just like we all do it there is now one
[1:22:10] position for you to be in for you to be
[1:22:11] on your phone talking to
[1:22:13] somebody you can be cooking you have
[1:22:15] your phone right here okay yeah
[1:22:18] uhhuh yeah yeah hello hello are you
[1:22:23] hearing me
[1:22:27] praise the
[1:22:31] Lord glory be to God in the same in the
[1:22:35] same sense you can also be staring
[1:22:36] theart and say Lord Jesus I thank you I
[1:22:39] just commit the situation in your hands
[1:22:41] whatever it is I don't want the devil
[1:22:43] bothering me Lord I know you are in
[1:22:51] control but it's just to show show us
[1:22:55] how
[1:22:56] much prayer is important to God the
[1:23:01] Bible says he inhabit the Praises of his
[1:23:06] people you can know all the Mysteries if
[1:23:10] you don't have a Praying relationship
[1:23:12] with God is for
[1:23:17] nothing it's for nothing and without a
[1:23:20] Praying relationship with God you just
[1:23:22] have ha knowledge
[1:23:24] those things can never be made manifest
[1:23:26] in your
[1:23:32] body it mean that God has a goalen vse
[1:23:36] to put my prayers Malachi he says I have
[1:23:40] a bottle of remembrance where I put your
[1:23:53] tears praise the
[1:23:55] Lord you know what you know what uh uh
[1:23:59] in our our uh uh Liberian coloa when
[1:24:04] they tell you say you get dry
[1:24:07] face when they say you get dry
[1:24:15] face and that's that's that's how the
[1:24:17] church is becoming becoming Christian
[1:24:19] with dry face
[1:24:27] are we
[1:24:28] together what am I talking about this
[1:24:33] morning Psalm 119 put me in all of this
[1:24:37] praise the Lord amen but I hope I'm
[1:24:41] saying something that is a blessing to
[1:24:43] you I'm hope I'm saying something that
[1:24:46] is a blessing to you praise the Lord
[1:24:49] because you see uh Jesus let us know
[1:24:52] this principle that he don't cast
[1:24:55] uh uh uh uh prayers before swans he
[1:24:58] don't give precious things Wednesday
[1:25:01] night we took uh uh uh invisible Union
[1:25:04] where brother Brandon make us to know
[1:25:06] that prayer is one of our sacred
[1:25:10] virtue it's a sacred
[1:25:13] virtue it's a
[1:25:17] trust God trust to meet
[1:25:21] you he trust to commune it's just like
[1:25:25] having a time and and he coming down to
[1:25:28] meet Adam and Adam was not there it was
[1:25:31] a trusted time that he would meet Adam
[1:25:35] for
[1:25:36] communion and that's why he made
[1:25:39] us because the great inent of God was
[1:25:42] tired of being
[1:25:44] alone he wanted his attributes that he
[1:25:47] can commune with and in such a based and
[1:25:51] loudish age God has sent a word to call
[1:25:55] you and
[1:25:56] myself that in the business of all that
[1:25:59] is happening we can be people that can

[1:29:31] your mind have you ever been in praying
[1:29:34] you really you want to pray about
[1:29:36] something but what you want to pray
[1:29:38] about something else keeps coming to
[1:29:41] your mind somebody else keeps coming to
[1:29:43] your mind you are saying this but you
[1:29:45] are thinking on that person the best
[1:29:48] thing to do forget about what you want
[1:29:50] to say pray for the person on your mind
[1:30:01] when the doctors was about to do surgery
[1:30:03] and all of that and and and after two or
[1:30:05] three days this brother praying he just
[1:30:08] felt that that that that that that uh uh
[1:30:10] impression on his heart to pray for this
[1:30:13] brother and and you know uh uh and and
[1:30:16] he prayed for the brother and the Lord

[1:31:08] iniquity the little things we allow in
[1:31:11] our life we make them so
[1:31:13] major and God has become so minor in our
[1:31:17] life he's the last one we think about
[1:31:19] when we have problem he's the last one
[1:31:21] we want to consult when we real thing
[1:31:24] that we are dying that's when we need
[1:31:28] God when he should be the first one we
[1:31:31] must Pi talk before even we pick up our
[1:31:33] phone in the
[1:31:36] morning I pick up mine first too to look
[1:31:39] at the
[1:31:40] time or maybe when the alarm wakes me
[1:31:48] up that's how much prayer is important
[1:31:52] communion that's what we made for he
[1:31:56] expresses attributes in every age to
[1:31:59] have people to commune

[1:32:12] understand they go from one verse to
[1:32:14] another and gather courts and cours and
[1:32:16] they don't even have enough
[1:32:19] time to spend on your knees with God
[1:32:28] that's how much prayer is
[1:32:32] important just listening to something

[1:40:35] you been you've been able to to
[1:40:36] appreciate what we were trying to bring
[1:40:38] to you amen it's it's very very
[1:40:40] important since I mean it's very very
[1:40:43] important brother Bram compare prayer to
[1:40:48] astronauts is prayer when the church
[1:40:51] become a Praying church that's what take
[1:40:54] take us off the
[1:40:58] ground praise the Lord if we just fing
[1:41:01] about Doctrine or I mean I mean uh uh uh
[1:41:05] uh he's he's quoting this he's quoting
[1:41:07] that we just the prophet of God say we
[1:41:09] in
[1:41:12] kindergarten he says it's in
[1:41:13] kindergarten that the children throw
[1:41:15] papers at one
[1:41:16] another college students don't do
[1:41:22] that it's prayer that takes a church off
[1:41:25] the
[1:41:26] ground it brings responsibility to the
[1:41:29] people the people know that they are
[1:41:32] they are responsible for what they are
[1:41:33] coming to do
[1:41:36] here
[1:41:38] remember wasted water cannot be gathered
[1:41:42] that's what that t woman told
[1:41:45] David wasted water Cann now be
[1:41:48] gathered make sure that every meing you
[1:41:51] are spending in this place you are now
[1:41:53] wasting
[1:41:58] time when you leave your home and come
[1:42:01] and make sure that every second you are
[1:42:03] spending in this building you are not
[1:42:05] wasting your
[1:42:08] time because that time you can't get it
[1:42:20] back are we together
[1:42:25] but let's look at
[1:42:27] this asaiah
[1:42:31] said he'll be wounded for our
[1:42:33] transgression he will be bruised for our
[1:42:36] iniquity the Chas of our peace will beat
[1:42:40] upon him and by his tribes will be
[1:42:43] healed are we
[1:42:45] together glory be to
[1:42:48] God and Isaiah the
[1:42:51] prophet he was
[1:42:53] he was summing up all the Old Testament
[1:42:57] sacrifice the totod dos the Sheep the
[1:43:02] scapegoat the
[1:43:04] Bulls praise the Lord amen you read you
[1:43:08] read that it's it's it's it's uh it's uh
[1:43:11] Hebrew that you will read where Paul
[1:43:13] will says the Bulls and goat have you
[1:43:16] read that in Hebrew the bulls and goats
[1:43:19] Paul Paul will be the one that will
[1:43:21] bring that to us you know what what it
[1:43:22] was
[1:43:24] the bulls and goats the Bulls was the
[1:43:27] high priest
[1:43:31] sacrifice
[1:43:33] amen the gods were the people
[1:43:38] sacrifice when the high priest is
[1:43:40] bringing the sacrifice everybody see it
[1:43:43] that's why when something happened to
[1:43:44] the preacher it blows
[1:43:47] up that's how God designed it his
[1:43:50] sacrifice has to be big he has to put
[1:43:54] more time to praying more time to
[1:43:56] studying the word more time to paying
[1:43:58] attention it's not just h h h the kind
[1:44:00] of a car he ride the house he drive the
[1:44:03] suits he change no he must be able to
[1:44:05] put more time into the service of God
[1:44:08] that's how God design
[1:44:11] it so his sacrifice is the
[1:44:15] bull when he come across the street
[1:44:18] everybody say he's going to he's going
[1:44:20] there they know that he's going to
[1:44:22] confess his
[1:44:24] Sint praise the Lord you can skip with
[1:44:27] your owner go behind the behind the
[1:44:30] building maybe a little one you can put
[1:44:32] it under your arm and hide yourself but
[1:44:34] you can't put a bull on your arm you got
[1:44:37] to walk through the city with
[1:44:38] it that's the reason why when a man
[1:44:40] don't live up to the word of God and you
[1:44:42] bring H uh disgrace to the word of God
[1:44:45] it's spray
[1:44:47] out the neighbor who knows it everybody
[1:44:50] knows about it that's how God designed
[1:44:54] it are we together what am I talking
[1:44:57] about so asaiah summing up all the Old
[1:45:01] Testament sacrifice and he's nailing it
[1:45:04] right there in Isaiah chapter
[1:45:07] 53 that this is the Fulfillment of
[1:45:10] everything that was done in the Old
[1:45:12] Testament as a sacrifice he was wounded
[1:45:15] for that was transgression he was bruis
[1:45:17] for our iniquity the Chas of our Peace
[1:45:20] So the Fulfillment of this prophecy say
[1:45:23] was
[1:45:25] Calvary amen are we
[1:45:29] together the Fulfillment was Calvary so
[1:45:32] here said now that even before Jesus
[1:45:36] went to
[1:45:39] Calvary people was were
[1:45:43] benefiting from the
[1:45:46] atonement
[1:45:48] amen he was casting out
[1:45:51] Spirits amen
[1:45:53] amen he was setting the oppressed
[1:45:57] free before even the atonement was paid
[1:46:00] before he died on
[1:46:02] Calvary people were benefiting how much
[1:46:05] more that he have already
[1:46:08] died praise the
[1:46:11] Lord
[1:46:14] amen if he can if he can heal a a Peter
[1:46:19] mother
[1:46:21] Lord praise the Lord
[1:46:23] that's what I says I mean uh I mean uh
[1:46:25] uh uh the the the uh uh the people in
[1:46:29] Rome will have a hard time to defend
[1:46:32] this because Peter can never be their
[1:46:34] first
[1:46:37] pope he couldn't he would not he would
[1:46:39] not even uh H H uh be qualified to be a
[1:46:43] priest in the Roman
[1:46:46] church because yeah the Bible says his
[1:46:48] mother-in-law if he had a mother-in-law
[1:46:51] he had a wife
[1:46:56] praise the Lord that's what happen when
[1:46:58] you build a Doctrine without
[1:47:00] scripture they will always run in
[1:47:03] conflict with the
[1:47:06] scripture are we together the scripture
[1:47:09] is the foundation for all our our
[1:47:11] doctrinal principle if he cannot rest on
[1:47:14] the scripture don't hold to
[1:47:17] it amen because it's not on Rock it's on
[1:47:21] sinking sand I we together so y said now
[1:47:26] that so this whole thing I'm bringing to
[1:47:29] you uh came about in a
[1:47:32] conversation with uh h h h h a preacher
[1:47:36] that was trying to challenge brother
[1:47:38] brandham on Divine
[1:47:41] Healing and was telling him that that
[1:47:43] you know uh uh uh uh the whole Divine
[1:47:46] Healing thing is a HX you know uh uh
[1:47:48] he's he's reading the people mind and
[1:47:50] and all of that so he's he's challenging
[1:47:53] brother Bram on Divine Healing why
[1:47:55] because he's using Matthew chapter 8 to
[1:48:00] says that the the the the the
[1:48:05] Fulfillment of Isaiah 53 was before
[1:48:12] Calvary so we cannot point to the
[1:48:15] atonement because yeah Matthew said when
[1:48:19] Jesus prayed for for Peter's
[1:48:22] mother-in-law so it will come to pass
[1:48:24] what Isaiah
[1:48:27] said and where he was pointing to was
[1:48:30] Isaiah 53 are we together amen so let's
[1:48:35] just let's just read this we shared this
[1:48:37] with you some time ago but let's go back
[1:48:39] to that again God's provided
[1:48:42] way he said well Rend brandom I want to
[1:48:44] ask you something he said if I will
[1:48:47] prove to you by the Bible that asai your
[1:48:50] prophesy prophecy has already being
[1:48:53] fulfilled and done away
[1:48:56] with he said talk our infirmities and so
[1:49:00] forth and bruis for our iniquity and I
[1:49:03] said yes sir he said all right Matthew
[1:49:05] chapter 8 that was where we
[1:49:07] read
[1:49:10] said that when evening was come they
[1:49:12] brought to him the multitudes and people
[1:49:16] that he might heal them and he healed
[1:49:20] them all which was to fulfill W which
[1:49:25] was to fulfill which asaiah the prophet
[1:49:28] said himself took our infires so he's
[1:49:32] trying to prove that that's what fulfill
[1:49:35] asah prophecy that's what fulfill uh uh
[1:49:39] uh Isaiah 53 that was before Calvary so
[1:49:44] why after Calvary are we pointing back
[1:49:47] to Isaiah
[1:49:50] 53 are you are you getting the argument
[1:49:53] amen why after Calvary are we pointing
[1:49:57] back to Isaiah 53 when in the Scriptures
[1:50:00] it says that according to Isaiah 53 it
[1:50:04] was
[1:50:05] fulfilled praise the Lord
[1:50:09] amen you see that's why prove that when
[1:50:13] God when God has done something because
[1:50:16] he did it he can do it as many time he
[1:50:18] want
[1:50:20] to are we together
[1:50:24] because he did it he can do it as many
[1:50:27] time he want to amen God is stayed in
[1:50:32] the saving
[1:50:33] business praise the Lord if the grace of
[1:50:37] God has saved you thy Grace can stay
[1:50:40] safe sinner on the
[1:50:43] street
[1:50:47] Hallelujah that's the reason why in as
[1:50:50] much as it is truth
[1:50:53] but yet it's a horrible thing for when
[1:50:56] when we say this message is not for
[1:50:59] everybody if you think it is good for
[1:51:02] you you must believe that is good for
[1:51:03] somebody else if you could be saved God
[1:51:06] can save people also in as much as it is
[1:51:10] truth that yeah it's not for everybody
[1:51:13] but it's not something for us to hold
[1:51:16] to and throw to people face where this
[1:51:18] message is not for everybody
[1:51:23] are we together Let's Travel a little
[1:51:26] bit here with
[1:51:28] this
[1:51:31] amen see when we take things in our life
[1:51:34] things that we are struggling with
[1:51:36] instead of bringing it to the throne of
[1:51:38] God and crying to God to deliver us when
[1:51:41] we find reason to justify ourself and
[1:51:43] live
[1:51:47] wrong remember wasted water cannot be
[1:51:51] gathered if you waste the grace of God
[1:51:55] if you waste God's mercy there will be
[1:51:58] time that you will need
[1:52:01] it there will be time that you will need
[1:52:04] it if God has given you Grace and
[1:52:08] brought you into communion with him that
[1:52:11] your heart Can Be Touched by the word of
[1:52:13] God you better cherish
[1:52:15] it if you start pumping your heart and
[1:52:18] say God blow me and see if I will feed
[1:52:20] it because now you are wa you are
[1:52:22] lifting weight you spraying your chest
[1:52:25] let the preacher preach and see if I if
[1:52:27] I will feed it there will come a time
[1:52:30] where the word of God will mean nothing
[1:52:32] to you no matter how hard a preacher we
[1:52:35] preach it will mean nothing to
[1:52:40] you you will just say there we have
[1:52:42] heard it I have heard it I have heard it
[1:52:46] that's how we are in church people just
[1:52:48] shook their shoulder
[1:52:53] wasted water cannot be gathered let's
[1:52:57] let's let's move a little bit here are
[1:52:59] we
[1:53:00] together amen thank you I'm not sleeping
[1:53:04] yet
[1:53:05] amen I'm not sleeping
[1:53:11] yet so yeah he's he's trying to prove
[1:53:13] his point here and
[1:53:16] uh uh he took our infirmity you see
[1:53:21] brother Brandon that prove Pro that it
[1:53:23] was fulfilled right there because the
[1:53:25] Bible said that it was fulfilled so
[1:53:28] which mean if God did it he can do it
[1:53:35] again how small is our
[1:53:39] God how small is
[1:53:42] he that when he does something he can't
[1:53:45] do it again when he do it one time he
[1:53:47] can do
[1:53:50] it the question question yet to be asked
[1:53:54] the question really to be
[1:53:56] asked is that why is the blessing of the
[1:54:02] atonement on this side before Calvary
[1:54:06] that is the real question to
[1:54:10] ask because Calvary is the Fulfillment
[1:54:13] of Isaiah
[1:54:15] 53 you see that is the reason why the
[1:54:18] Jews have problem with Isaiah 53
[1:54:23] for them to accept Isaiah 53 is to
[1:54:27] accept
[1:54:29] Calvary praise the
[1:54:31] Lord
[1:54:35] amen the believe that the prophet said
[1:54:37] it they believe that it is the Messiah
[1:54:39] that will fulfill that but it will still
[1:54:42] struggle and say no it was not
[1:54:47] Jesus praise the
[1:54:49] Lord it was not Jesus
[1:54:56] let's go ahead here and take this down
[1:54:59] so we can close up here are we together
[1:55:02] brother you mean to say uh uh uh that
[1:55:06] you believe that asai your prophesy he
[1:55:08] was wounded for our transgression bruis
[1:55:10] for our iniquity so far and with his Tri
[1:55:13] we are healed the healing taking place
[1:55:17] there th fulfill it he says that's what
[1:55:20] the Bible said I said then the atonement
[1:55:24] had more power before it was made you
[1:55:28] see because this is the side of Calvary
[1:55:30] that we are talking about so the
[1:55:33] atonement has more power even before the
[1:55:36] word was
[1:55:37] fulfilled praise the Lord you remember
[1:55:40] that story about The Bible school boy
[1:55:42] that says uh you know in the bible
[1:55:44] school we read that Marx 16 is not
[1:55:46] inspired his own mother shall glory be
[1:55:48] to God if God can heal me with an
[1:55:51] uninspired verse what will he do with
[1:55:53] the inspired one amen if the atonement
[1:55:58] can have more effect on this side what
[1:56:00] would it do when he have already been
[1:56:02] fulfilled and we believe
[1:56:07] it are we together glory be to
[1:56:13] God said then the atonement have more
[1:56:16] power before it was made then after it
[1:56:19] was made after it came in effect because
[1:56:22] that was a year or six months before
[1:56:25] Jesus
[1:56:27] died are we together the atonement
[1:56:30] having even been made so how could it be
[1:56:34] that that is the real question that he
[1:56:36] was supposed to
[1:56:38] ask that is the real question because if
[1:56:42] when the Bible say he was wounded who
[1:56:44] was wounded Jesus had not been wounded
[1:56:47] yet but yet they're enjoying the benefit
[1:56:50] blam Baus enjoy it the woman with the
[1:56:52] blood issue enjoy it
[1:56:54] amen the Widow at now her son was raised
[1:56:57] back to life Lazar came back from the
[1:57:00] dead all of this happened before the
[1:57:05] atonement are we
[1:57:08] together you love the Lord amen are you
[1:57:12] enjoying the word
[1:57:14] hallelujah that's why we must do we must
[1:57:16] enjoy the word
[1:57:26] there two men had had not even been made
[1:57:28] yet so how could it be well I said I
[1:57:32] want to ask you something brother he he
[1:57:35] got in using big words and I said now
[1:57:38] don't go to speaking in unknown tongues
[1:57:40] for me because I can't understand it you
[1:57:44] just speak plain English amen just like
[1:57:47] uh uh uh just like youed here in the
[1:57:49] King James uh Bible I we together glory
[1:57:54] be to
[1:57:57] God will you admit that that that Divine
[1:58:00] Healing is in the word is in the word I
[1:58:02] just want to say see be no yes in the
[1:58:05] word but the
[1:58:07] atonement is over the
[1:58:10] word praise the Lord amen the atonement
[1:58:15] is over the word what what does that
[1:58:18] mean how does it how does it come to us
[1:58:21] the atonement is what over the word amen
[1:58:25] are we ready now so you will see here
[1:58:28] that
[1:58:32] uh the Bible led us to know that the
[1:58:36] Lamb of God was slain from the
[1:58:40] foundation of the
[1:58:43] word are we together amen so even before
[1:58:48] God created A World Before men were
[1:58:52] called in sin before people will get
[1:58:54] sick God has already made a
[1:58:59] provision
[1:59:02] amen so you see the power of the
[1:59:05] atonement he have already made
[1:59:08] provision that's the reason why no
[1:59:11] matter what the devil tried to hang over
[1:59:13] our life it can never take hold you must
[1:59:17] never allow it to take hold
[1:59:22] water is a habit you are struggling with
[1:59:24] whatever it is praise the Lord tell the
[1:59:27] devil it can never take hold because
[1:59:30] before I was born there was a sacrifice
[1:59:33] in the mind of
[1:59:39] God so they are two men having more
[1:59:47] power are we
[1:59:49] together now let's go ahead here
[1:59:54] Mark 16 is not inspired okay whatsoever
[1:59:59] thing you desire you pray uh believe you
[2:00:02] receive it see whatever see yes it's the
[2:00:05] word but uh but uh it's not in the
[2:00:09] atonement glory be to God Amen let's
[2:00:13] drop down a little bit brother B will
[2:00:16] says
[2:00:17] here I gave him a little
[2:00:19] Parable now brother random now is going
[2:00:23] to behave like the woman of teoa that we
[2:00:28] read
[2:00:29] about you remember the woman gave David
[2:00:32] a
[2:00:34] parable amen he's now going to give this
[2:00:38] intellectual preacher a
[2:00:44] parable I said brother one time there
[2:00:47] was a king and he had a great Kingdom
[2:00:50] and and in this he he made a Ru and the
[2:00:54] atonement and so forth required death
[2:00:59] and so he called the slave up and it was
[2:01:03] and and it was deaf praise the Lord so
[2:01:07] there wasn't nothing for the slave to do
[2:01:10] but
[2:01:12] die so he said what can I do before I
[2:01:16] kill you now this slave man uh did
[2:01:19] something that was wrong praise the Lord
[2:01:22] and the Lord of of the king require
[2:01:25] death when you do this you have to die

[2:02:07] away

[2:02:13] of
[2:02:16] water
[2:02:18] what glass of water is your last wish
[2:02:26] people want to go to to to uh uh Disney
[2:02:30] Land and your owner wish is just a glass
[2:02:33] of
[2:02:33] water praise the Lord
[2:02:39] amen but this this looks like this was a
[2:02:43] predestinated
[2:02:45] slave they this was a slave that knows
[2:02:48] the power of the atonement this was a
[2:02:51] slave that know the power of a
[2:02:53] promise praise the Lord he was not
[2:02:56] carried about with all the flashy things
[2:02:58] around and I me you want to ride the
[2:03:01] king's Chariot I mean what what what a
[2:03:03] privilege to sit in the president lemon
[2:03:05] in but that was not what was on his
[2:03:08] mind he said give me a glass of
[2:03:13] water praise the lord gave me a glass of
[2:03:16] water and
[2:03:18] so they brought him a glass of water and
[2:03:21] a pour fellow knew he was going to
[2:03:24] die
[2:03:27] so he was shaking so hard he couldn't
[2:03:31] hold the glass in his hand and he said
[2:03:33] now wait a
[2:03:34] minute for I take my
[2:03:38] life
[2:03:41] amen the king says before I take your
[2:03:43] life you drink the water before I take
[2:03:46] your life and I'm and I'm not going to
[2:03:49] take your life until you drink the glass
[2:03:52] of
[2:03:52] water and the slave threw the water on
[2:03:55] the
[2:04:01] ground praise the
[2:04:04] Lord I'm not going to kill you until you
[2:04:07] drink the
[2:04:10] water praise the Lord he could have gone
[2:04:13] Drive in lemon
[2:04:15] Zine when he finish doing oh wow oh
[2:04:20] wow and you do
[2:04:24] heyha
[2:04:25] praise amen he could have gone through
[2:04:28] ho all over the
[2:04:34] place he took the glass of water he Wast
[2:04:37] on the
[2:04:40] ground praise the
[2:04:42] Lord the word was you drink the water
[2:04:46] after the water you be killed that water
[2:04:48] you requested
[2:04:52] oh I I I think they brought him a fancy
[2:04:55] Trail a
[2:04:56] goaling all of those things did not
[2:04:59] matter to
[2:05:01] him he was looking at the power of a
[2:05:06] promise the power that is in the king's
[2:05:12] word the power when the king promised
[2:05:15] when the Kings
[2:05:17] speak the prom the power that is laying
[2:05:20] in the pages of this
[2:05:29] F he took the water he pulled it to the
[2:05:34] ground
[2:05:37] amen I said
[2:05:40] now what is he going to do i h h h if if
[2:05:45] he's the man of Honor he has to keep his
[2:05:48] word no matter the law says he got to
[2:05:53] keep his word so you see you see the
[2:05:56] parable the parable that that that was
[2:05:58] happening
[2:05:59] here what what what what brother Brandon
[2:06:01] was trying to bring him to understand is
[2:06:04] that even though the H H he Jesus was
[2:06:08] Healing The Sick but God had to keep his
[2:06:11] word to go to
[2:06:14] Calvary amen because he was Healing The
[2:06:18] Sick it never stopped him from paying
[2:06:20] the ultimate price
[2:06:22] because that's what his word
[2:06:28] said are we together amen and then when
[2:06:32] he paid the ultimate price he was the
[2:06:35] water on the ground and he said what it
[2:06:37] is finished what is done is done there
[2:06:42] is nothing that the devil can bring
[2:06:44] against you because wasted water cannot
[2:06:47] be gathered that's the reason why the
[2:06:49] devil accusation against you can that
[2:06:51] hold because Jesus said it is
[2:06:59] finished praise the Lord there is
[2:07:02] nothing that he can bring against you
[2:07:03] that can ever hold the reason why it can
[2:07:06] hold is because you believe him and you
[2:07:08] don't believe the word you don't believe
[2:07:10] the promise you don't believe what
[2:07:12] Christ have done for you you believe
[2:07:14] what the devil is pling your life with
[2:07:21] he spilled his blood on the ground that
[2:07:24] was the Wast of water and when he did it
[2:07:27] he said it is
[2:07:32] finished what would the king do the king
[2:07:36] said if you drink the water then you'll
[2:07:38] be killed for the man to drink that
[2:07:41] water the king must leave his throne
[2:07:44] gather on the ground and gather the
[2:07:46] wasted water but wasted water cannot be
[2:07:49] gathered
[2:08:01] oh glory be to God oh sweet
[2:08:05] Jesus oh sweet
[2:08:09] Jesus if we were just want realize
[2:08:13] praise the
[2:08:14] Lord even though the devil is trying to
[2:08:17] slip this book out of our hands amen
[2:08:21] and say we got a Bible on our
[2:08:24] phone that's okay but how much
[2:08:28] importance are we putting to the
[2:08:31] promises that is in this
[2:08:33] book to realize that everything that
[2:08:36] concern our life and everything our life
[2:08:39] is involved in there is something God
[2:08:41] has written in the pages of this
[2:08:45] book that can answer our question that
[2:08:48] can heal our sickness
[2:08:53] we are feeling on what the society is
[2:08:55] giving us we are feeling on what the age
[2:08:58] is giving us we are feeling on the
[2:09:01] devil's
[2:09:02] lies instead of believing God's
[2:09:06] word he wasted the
[2:09:09] water and he's standing there looking at
[2:09:11] the king the king looking at
[2:09:14] him praise the Lord the rope that is
[2:09:17] supposed to hang in is hanging up
[2:09:20] there the guys that supposed to hang in
[2:09:22] they all standing up they're looking at
[2:09:24] him praise the Lord and he's standing
[2:09:27] there he's looking at the
[2:09:31] king praise the Lord you see how you
[2:09:35] make the devil
[2:09:37] powerless amen when you realize that
[2:09:41] Calvary has taken all his teeth from his
[2:09:44] mouth he can only bite but he can bite
[2:09:48] you make him powerless when you are able
[2:09:51] to to open the word and say you devil is
[2:09:54] written right here in the pages of this
[2:09:56] Bible that by his tribe I'm Healed I
[2:10:00] don't care how you afflect my body but
[2:10:03] that's what the word says and I believe
[2:10:12] it you know brother Brandon says there
[2:10:16] are people that the devil will not know
[2:10:19] what to do to them and there are PE
[2:10:22] those people are the people that knows
[2:10:25] the value of what is written in this
[2:10:29] book praise the Lord he will slap you on
[2:10:32] every
[2:10:33] side praise the Lord the next morning he
[2:10:37] see you you bounce back your hands up in
[2:10:39] the air he don't even know what to do to
[2:10:48] you because you know the value of this
[2:11:01] book wasted water cannot be gathered
[2:11:05] what God has done is
[2:11:07] done if he said by his tribe you are
[2:11:11] healed he not coming back to to do
[2:11:13] anything he have already done
[2:11:17] it it's already done it is for you to
[2:11:21] cash it
[2:11:23] in is for you to believe it until it
[2:11:26] become real to
[2:11:30] you praise the
[2:11:34] Lord if he has saved you you are save
[2:11:38] praise the Lord all the devil can do is
[2:11:42] Rob your mind abuse your mind and have
[2:11:44] you to live on
[2:11:48] privilege but yet you'll be safe amen

[2:11:54] will be testifying about the joy of the
[2:11:56] Lord how the Lord and you you will just
[2:11:58] be
[2:12:01] there why because he abused your mind so
[2:12:04] much that you can't even believe you get

[2:12:09] even
[2:12:12] safe praise the Lord you are surprised
[2:12:16] that you are oh I'm safe that's thought

[2:12:24] and I I didn't even know if I have the
[2:12:25] Holy
[2:12:29] Ghost praise the lord it's a finished
[2:12:32] work it's a finished work but many are
[2:12:35] not
[2:12:36] enjoying the joy of their salvation
[2:12:39] because they have put so much theologic
[2:12:42] in their
[2:12:43] mind that is abusing
[2:12:47] them praise the Lord
[2:12:54] what is done is

[2:13:17] done it butam say if Jesus was here this
[2:13:21] morning wearing my suit he will tell you
[2:13:23] Isaiah

[2:13:28] question he will ask
[2:13:29] you because I was wounded for your
[2:13:31] transgression I was bruised for your
[2:13:36] iniquity praise the Lord amen you see
[2:13:40] that's that is the power in Catching in
[2:13:43] the word instead of running around and
[2:13:45] looking for some kind of a Superman to
[2:13:47] lay his hands upon
[2:13:49] us there are people that are gifted no
[2:13:52] doubt they are gifted because God gave
[2:13:55] them their portion praise the Lord but

[2:14:02] God praise the Lord and let me tell you
[2:14:05] let me give you some a secret let me
[2:14:07] give you a
[2:14:09] secret Jesus

[2:14:16] was talking about little
[2:14:18] children and the prophet of God will
[2:14:20] come tell us that little children have
[2:14:23] so much Faith why because they are
[2:14:26] innocent if you make them to believe
[2:14:29] that they can pray for you the Bible uh
[2:14:32] David said out of the mouth of babes
[2:14:34] will come
[2:14:36] Praises amen praise the Lord

[2:14:55] through oh I I committed if God forgive
[2:14:57] me and you know I a get Faith yet a
[2:15:00] little child don't think about
[2:15:03] that Jesus bless my mama so mama I can
[2:15:07] feel well

[2:15:11] powerful that's very powerful that's
[2:15:14] that's that's inocent and precious words
[2:15:27] Hallelujah you know the church teach us
[2:15:31] they says 12 years old is the age of
[2:15:33] accountability so the child must be 12
[2:15:35] years old you wait to abuse the mind of
[2:15:37] the child expose the child to the place
[2:15:40] where the devil will start making them
[2:15:42] to sense the changes in their body in
[2:15:44] order of that you weaken their faith
[2:15:47] when a child is Young and and and that
[2:15:49] little desire is in their heart to be
[2:15:51] baptized pray for them and baptize them
[2:15:55] their innocent Faith Can can believe God
[2:15:58] more than your intellectual Faith
[2:16:00] because many of the things that we
[2:16:02] parents have is just intellectual Faith
[2:16:04] you are looking at the child little
[2:16:05] mistakes innocent mistakes praise the
[2:16:10] Lord and you think that oh they're not
[2:16:12] orderer yet to be

[2:16:22] I'm just
[2:16:30] preaching but you see all of these
[2:16:32] little ones that you drag to
[2:16:34] church you might think they are just
[2:16:37] little ones they are there and and they
[2:16:39] don't hear nothing they are just in the
[2:16:41] church you know uh uh maybe they're just
[2:16:43] making you to go out and come back and
[2:16:46] be grateful for
[2:16:47] them praise the Lord
[2:16:51] because because of those little children
[2:16:53] many times they are they are Gathering
[2:16:55] angel is protecting them and because you
[2:16:58] are close you are also
[2:17:03] protected glory be to
[2:17:06] God
[2:17:08] hallelujah that's our responsibility to
[2:17:10] teach
[2:17:12] them for them to come to that place of
[2:17:14] the fear of
[2:17:17] God glory be to God
[2:17:23] amen Peter says if they have a good
[2:17:25] conscience towards God that's what they
[2:17:28] need to be baptized is to have a good
[2:17:31] conscience towards God that's why the
[2:17:34] Bible says so you teach them to have a
[2:17:37] good conscience towards God are we
[2:17:39] together you love the Lord amen but you
[2:17:44] see Wast of water cannot be gathered
[2:17:46] that's why the tech woman said to David
[2:17:50] what has happened has has already
[2:17:51] happened don't hold the kingdom down
[2:17:53] David don't hold the kingdom
[2:17:55] down asalon is
[2:17:58] dead the people are waiting for you to
[2:18:02] get back on the
[2:18:04] throne there are things to happen we
[2:18:07] must not allow things that you know the
[2:18:10] the the devil used in the past and 10
[2:18:12] years and all that don't let it to hold
[2:18:14] you down forgetting those things in the
[2:18:17] past Paul says let's press onto the mark
[2:18:19] of the High Calling
[2:18:28] praise the
[2:18:29] Lord
[2:18:32] hallelujah you see because the thing
