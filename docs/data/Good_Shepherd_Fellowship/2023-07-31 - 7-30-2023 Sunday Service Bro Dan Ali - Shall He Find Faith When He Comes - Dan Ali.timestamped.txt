[54:33] Book of Luke
[54:44] Luke 18.
[54:48] and we are reading from verse 8.
[54:52] Luke 18
[54:55] verse 8.
[54:58] and I read
[55:01] I tell you that he will avenge them
[55:04] speedily
[55:05] let me start from verse 7.
[55:12] and shall not God avenge his own elect
[55:16] which cried day and night unto him
[55:20] though he belong with them
[55:23] I tell you that he will avenge them
[55:25] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[55:29] man cometh
[55:30] shall he find faith on Earth
[55:34] praise be to God
[55:36] shall we be seated
[55:48] nevertheless
[55:51] when the son of man cometh
[55:54] shall he find faith
[55:56] on Earth praise be to God
[56:02] I had to do some old school
[56:05] I did a lot of writing not a lot
[56:09] and I don't have the best of
[56:10] handwritings
[56:13] if I go to a place and I can't read
[56:17] I will see how that goes
[56:19] praise be to God
[56:30] I am here this morning to encourage us
[56:34] praise be to God
[56:36] there is nothing new I am bringing our
[56:39] way this morning
[56:42] but just to re Echo
[56:45] the things we've been hearing
[56:49] praise be to God
[56:51] and I am here to remind us
[56:54] to keep pressing on
[56:58] praise be to God
[57:01] keep holding on
[57:05] keep holding on
[57:08] never let go
[57:11] if there is anything you ought to be
[57:13] doing in this day and age and in the
[57:15] time we are living in is to keep holding
[57:18] on
[57:19] till when till when Christ takes over
[57:26] you holding on it's what you can do
[57:31] and there is nothing much you can do
[57:37] when you give your life to Christ and
[57:40] you are baptized and you you you are
[57:42] living the life and you are going
[57:44] through that sanctification process it
[57:47] is not an easy thing
[57:49] until the Holy Ghost comes in and takes
[57:52] over it is you
[57:55] struggling or trying to
[57:58] it's a good thing to keep
[58:02] till he takes over
[58:06] until he takes over
[58:09] you have not reached yet
[58:13] praise be to God
[58:18] there is an animal
[58:20] I don't know this is English equivalent
[58:25] but it's it's a small animal
[58:27] in Africa it looks like um
[58:31] like like a squirrel
[58:33] when that animal takes a hold of a hold
[58:36] of a branch
[58:39] you can kill that animal
[58:42] it will still be holding onto the branch
[58:45] it will never let go
[58:47] and when Christ has taken a hold of your
[58:50] life I don't care what you go through in
[58:52] this life you would keep holding on and
[58:55] it is not you but it is Christ and you
[58:58] doing the works
[59:00] by your strength there is nothing you
[59:02] can do
[59:04] he is our strength
[59:07] praise be to God
[59:09] until he has taken over
[59:12] there is nothing much
[59:15] you can do
[59:17] but keep holding on
[59:20] tell Christ
[59:22] has completely taken over
[59:24] then you can say with Paul that it is no
[59:27] longer either but Christ that lives in
[59:29] me
[59:32] that when you get to the Lions then
[59:35] you don't care about the Lions
[59:38] they Wonder put you in the boiling oil
[59:40] you don't care about it now when they
[59:43] bring you before the furry furnace
[59:46] all you see Christ
[59:50] why because he has taken a hold of your
[59:53] life so much so that nothing else
[59:56] matters but Christ and him crucified
[1:00:02] brother brother said
[1:00:07] that if he had
[1:00:10] two drops of blood
[1:00:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ in a glass
[1:00:18] or a charger
[1:00:21] he has been wondering how he is going to
[1:00:24] take care of it
[1:00:25] and he talks about how how tears will be
[1:00:28] running down his face and he'll be so
[1:00:31] careful with it not to waste it
[1:00:34] and then he says the best seated before
[1:00:37] me talking about the bride of Christ
[1:00:40] is more precious than the two drops of
[1:00:43] blood his literal blood in a glass or
[1:00:46] charger
[1:00:48] because
[1:00:49] we are the pitchers of his blood
[1:00:54] we are the purchase of his blood
[1:00:57] now think about it
[1:00:59] if the prophet of God says that if he
[1:01:03] had two drops of his literal blood and
[1:01:06] he'll be so so careful
[1:01:10] the way he works not to waste it
[1:01:14] can you imagine how how careful you and
[1:01:17] I are to be
[1:01:20] we are not talking of his literal blood
[1:01:24] here now
[1:01:28] we are talking of the life in the blood
[1:01:32] and when that life is in you when the
[1:01:36] Life of Christ is in you
[1:01:38] how careful do you ought to be in your
[1:01:42] work
[1:01:43] how careful do you ought to be
[1:01:47] how careful do you ought to be
[1:01:51] the Bible says the day that name of the
[1:01:54] name of the Lord should depart from
[1:01:55] iniquity
[1:02:01] be careful the way you walk
[1:02:04] be careful the things you do
[1:02:08] be careful what steps you take
[1:02:11] because you are bearing the name of
[1:02:13] Christ
[1:02:17] one word wrong move
[1:02:19] and you draw his name into reproach
[1:02:22] the biggest hindrance today is not the
[1:02:26] unbelievers day
[1:02:27] the biggest hindrance
[1:02:30] is those that call Christ I mean name
[1:02:33] the name of the Lord and who profess
[1:02:35] Christianity
[1:02:37] that have become stumbling blocks
[1:02:41] to the world in which we are living
[1:02:46] it's a shame
[1:02:49] it's a shame
[1:02:52] thank you
[1:02:53] that the world are looking up to us
[1:02:57] because they know who we are
[1:03:00] and we do not care what we do
[1:03:04] and the places we go
[1:03:08] but if you know who you are
[1:03:12] you know how far you have come with
[1:03:14] Christ
[1:03:15] you know why you stand as a child of God
[1:03:19] it doesn't matter what happens
[1:03:22] if it will cause you to lose your life
[1:03:26] For the Love of Christ
[1:03:28] you are going to do it and you'll do it
[1:03:31] Faithfully
[1:03:32] praise be to God
[1:03:35] message
[1:03:39] God Came Upon him
[1:03:42] brother says something
[1:03:44] I'll be going left and right back and
[1:03:46] forth I have just written small things
[1:03:47] here and there I don't even know
[1:03:49] so in that message
[1:03:51] the prayer of God says
[1:03:56] that the most miserable person I know of
[1:03:59] in all America is the man who says I do
[1:04:04] the best I can
[1:04:05] I go to church I hope I'm all right the
[1:04:09] salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope
[1:04:12] so
[1:04:13] it's a no so
[1:04:16] praise be to God
[1:04:18] you know when you are Christ
[1:04:21] the Holy Ghost best record which with
[1:04:24] your spirit that you are a son or
[1:04:26] daughter of God
[1:04:28] all things all things have passed out
[1:04:32] all things have passed away and all
[1:04:34] things have become new
[1:04:36] oh
[1:04:37] I hope we get it tonight
[1:04:42] not a borderline Minister nor not a
[1:04:45] borderline Christian
[1:04:48] stand in the Liberty where Christ has
[1:04:52] made you free
[1:04:53] be not again entangled in the Yoke of
[1:04:58] bondage or halfway
[1:05:01] I would
[1:05:06] you would you you would you would be hot
[1:05:09] or cold
[1:05:11] for being lukewarm I speedy
[1:05:15] from my mouth
[1:05:21] turned in the Liberty
[1:05:25] where Christ
[1:05:26] has made you free
[1:05:29] be not again
[1:05:32] entangled
[1:05:34] in the Yoke of bondage
[1:05:37] praise be together
[1:05:39] now we can look at the children of
[1:05:42] Israel
[1:05:44] the way God deals with them and we can
[1:05:47] apply that
[1:05:48] to our lives
[1:05:51] now when you look at the children of
[1:05:53] Israel in captivity in Egypt
[1:05:57] and you look at you as an individual
[1:06:00] and as the Bible says
[1:06:02] that is sin
[1:06:05] was I shaping iniquity was I in in sin
[1:06:08] was I conceived and in iniquity was
[1:06:11] hardshiping
[1:06:12] come to the world speaking lies
[1:06:14] every one of us
[1:06:16] was born straight into captivity
[1:06:21] every one of us was born straight
[1:06:24] into bondage
[1:06:30] you didn't have to do anything
[1:06:33] to become a sinner you were one right at
[1:06:36] Birth
[1:06:38] because we were Sinners by
[1:06:41] representation because one person saying
[1:06:44] all of us sinned and also we are
[1:06:46] righteous by representation by faith in
[1:06:49] Christ Jesus not because you have done
[1:06:52] anything right
[1:06:53] because how good works are as filthy as
[1:06:57] filthy rights in the sight of the father
[1:07:00] so we're born into captivity
[1:07:02] that we came into this life
[1:07:05] and then we lived all sort of lives
[1:07:08] we were in bondage
[1:07:11] the forces of Darkness the evil spirits
[1:07:15] name them they were just on our case and
[1:07:18] they were directing whatever we do
[1:07:20] whichever way we go whatever everything
[1:07:23] we're doing we were in bondage
[1:07:26] like the children of Israel
[1:07:28] were under their Taskmaster Masters so
[1:07:31] were we you had no choice
[1:07:35] but to do what the evil spirits wanted
[1:07:37] you to do
[1:07:39] but unto every child of God there is a
[1:07:43] time of visitation
[1:07:45] when that time has not come there is
[1:07:47] nothing you can do
[1:07:49] but when that time has come and you have
[1:07:52] seen the glory of God and God has
[1:07:54] delivered you
[1:07:56] as the prophet of God is saying here
[1:07:59] stand in the Liberty where Christ has
[1:08:02] made you free
[1:08:04] do not again
[1:08:07] do not again
[1:08:10] go back into that yoke of bondage
[1:08:15] there is Liberty in Christ
[1:08:21] then in that Liberty
[1:08:24] now we saw how that God delivered the
[1:08:27] children of Israel
[1:08:28] with all those signs and wonders
[1:08:31] following
[1:08:34] and then they got to the Red Sea God
[1:08:36] parted the Red Sea they went through it
[1:08:40] and in the wilderness God was with them
[1:08:43] and when God Called Moses to give the
[1:08:46] Ten Commandments
[1:08:47] what did the children of Israel do
[1:08:50] they prevailed on Iran to build them a
[1:08:54] god
[1:08:56] how forgetful can men ever be
[1:09:03] how forgetful can we ever be
[1:09:08] that with all those signs and wonders
[1:09:13] that they saw God
[1:09:15] they knew God was with them
[1:09:18] because no man could do the things that
[1:09:22] they saw unfolded
[1:09:24] and yet
[1:09:26] they could build
[1:09:28] a calf a golden calf
[1:09:31] and then they just started worshiping it
[1:09:33] oh this is the god that delivered us
[1:09:36] from bondage the god that kept my
[1:09:39] goodness Lord have mercy
[1:09:42] we may sit here and say oh we don't
[1:09:45] worship idols of course there are places
[1:09:48] in the world I know of that when you go
[1:09:50] there and they even give you a cup of
[1:09:52] water you'll not be bold enough to drink
[1:09:54] it why because in front of every single
[1:09:57] house they have gone down the river and
[1:09:59] they have just brought some clay and
[1:10:01] they have built themselves gods and they
[1:10:03] have slaughtered animals on it and it
[1:10:06] looks so so filthy
[1:10:09] and they save that and you will say oh
[1:10:12] we are in America oh come on we don't
[1:10:15] sell Idols why because there is no image
[1:10:18] before you because you didn't go to the
[1:10:20] forest to go and cut at the branch of a
[1:10:21] tree to come and worship it
[1:10:24] anything that comes between your God has
[1:10:26] become your Idol
[1:10:29] it can be your wife it can be your
[1:10:32] husband it can be your child it can be
[1:10:35] your work it can be your your promotion
[1:10:37] it can be anything anything that comes
[1:10:40] between you and God has become your Idol
[1:10:45] you have to make sure that when it comes
[1:10:50] with your work with Christ
[1:10:52] that there is nothing in between
[1:10:56] if anything stands in your way
[1:10:59] if anything stands in your way
[1:11:02] it's time
[1:11:04] to get on your knees
[1:11:07] praise be to God
[1:11:10] and God was not happy with them
[1:11:14] and that is how forgetful we can be some
[1:11:17] of the times
[1:11:19] that we see the glory of God that will
[1:11:22] see the hand of God in our midst that we
[1:11:25] see God changing lives that we see God
[1:11:28] moving in our midst but then we get to a
[1:11:31] place and something happens and then we
[1:11:33] forget of all the good God has done for
[1:11:36] us
[1:11:37] and we are ready
[1:11:41] to throw away
[1:11:43] all that we have believed for all those
[1:11:45] years
[1:11:46] Lord have mercy
[1:11:58] oh
[1:12:01] praise the Lord
[1:12:19] and don't think
[1:12:22] that Christianity
[1:12:26] is an easy walk no it is not
[1:12:32] like the sister just sang the special
[1:12:34] this morning
[1:12:36] and uh the song leader asked by the
[1:12:39] Ariel to interpret it
[1:12:42] it is not
[1:12:44] an easy Road
[1:12:47] it is not
[1:12:49] an easy walk
[1:12:55] when God has delivered you
[1:12:58] you are delivered
[1:13:04] but you are have been delivered from
[1:13:08] something
[1:13:10] that something is cast away is cast out
[1:13:14] but Christ gave a parable
[1:13:17] that when an evil spirit is cast out of
[1:13:20] a man it goes
[1:13:22] it goes it doesn't stay it goes
[1:13:26] but after a while when it has gone Roman
[1:13:30] and roaming and roaming it comes back to
[1:13:33] where it was before and it comes to spy
[1:13:36] into sea
[1:13:37] and if it is clean and there is nothing
[1:13:40] in there nobody occupying it it goes
[1:13:43] back and then it brings an enforcement
[1:13:47] seven more wicked spirits and then they
[1:13:50] come and inhabit them and the end of
[1:13:52] that man is worse than before
[1:13:56] so when you are delivered you are
[1:13:58] delivered
[1:14:01] but that evil spirit is going to come
[1:14:03] back somehow
[1:14:06] and we saw that when the children of
[1:14:08] isawa delivered from Egypt
[1:14:10] the Pharaoh and his men sat down and
[1:14:12] they said no we need to go get them back
[1:14:15] here we will not allow them to go
[1:14:17] kind of follow them and we all know the
[1:14:20] story
[1:14:21] how that they all got consumed in the
[1:14:23] Red Sea praise be to God so when God has
[1:14:27] delivered you
[1:14:29] and you are faithful
[1:14:31] there is a song I was listening to
[1:14:33] listening to the other day that says
[1:14:35] that
[1:14:37] um
[1:14:41] God loves
[1:14:43] every broken piece
[1:14:46] of an honest sacrifice
[1:14:51] every broken piece of it
[1:14:53] it doesn't matter how small it is
[1:14:57] God is interested in it
[1:14:59] when God has saved your life
[1:15:03] and you are working with God with all
[1:15:05] honesty
[1:15:07] the best you know
[1:15:10] not with any second motif
[1:15:12] but you have given yourself to God
[1:15:15] wholeheartedly
[1:15:17] and you are living the life
[1:15:20] whatever comes your way
[1:15:23] just be sure that God is there to take
[1:15:25] you out of it
[1:15:28] when you get to that point the battle is
[1:15:31] not no longer yours
[1:15:34] it is no longer your battle it's God's
[1:15:37] battle
[1:15:39] by dead a pillar of fire you have the
[1:15:42] pillar of cloud was leading there and by
[1:15:44] Night the pillar of fire the angel of
[1:15:47] the Covenant was with them
[1:15:49] and they knew God was there and when the
[1:15:51] enemy came against them
[1:15:54] it was not they are doing
[1:15:57] God drowned every one of them together
[1:15:59] with their chariots
[1:16:01] when the enemy comes after you
[1:16:05] just know
[1:16:07] that the God who delivered you that that
[1:16:11] God is with you
[1:16:13] and he has promised us
[1:16:15] that he will never leave us no forsake
[1:16:18] us
[1:16:18] but he would be with us always
[1:16:23] because he knows
[1:16:25] that the devil is going to come around
[1:16:27] somehow
[1:16:29] and when the Devil comes back God is
[1:16:32] there
[1:16:33] praise be to God
[1:16:35] when you are sleeping God is awake
[1:16:39] when you are on the job and you are so
[1:16:41] busy and you don't know what you are
[1:16:43] doing God is there oh my goodness God is
[1:16:47] so so loving that sometimes even at our
[1:16:51] workplaces
[1:16:52] he shows himself there
[1:16:56] brother Johnny knows about this
[1:16:58] but he never heard of this testimony I
[1:17:01] believe
[1:17:01] I think some time ago I shared it here
[1:17:04] we have super sex and that super stock
[1:17:07] takes up to 2 000 pounds of flour
[1:17:11] and then there is a hoist that you that
[1:17:15] that that you wasted on just send it up
[1:17:17] and then you carry it to
[1:17:21] that is a place it has to go now
[1:17:24] I lifted this hoist I lifted these two
[1:17:28] thousand pounds of flour
[1:17:30] that was when I was in the on the cereal
[1:17:32] wing
[1:17:33] and there is there are rocks that hold
[1:17:35] it from the bottom
[1:17:37] so normally you would guide it to the
[1:17:40] hopper and then you take the Rope off
[1:17:45] and then when you take the Rope off and
[1:17:47] then it will just shoot
[1:17:52] they are there are two ropes
[1:17:55] you can take the first one out
[1:17:58] and then wait till the second one gets
[1:18:01] there I mean wait till you get there and
[1:18:03] then you take the second one off
[1:18:06] unknown to me
[1:18:08] the first one had already been taken off
[1:18:12] when I lifted it
[1:18:14] so I reached out and I took the last one
[1:18:19] I didn't realize it
[1:18:21] so I guided this 2 000 pounds of flour
[1:18:25] in the super sack to the hopper
[1:18:28] and as soon as it got there then it
[1:18:31] opened I said oh
[1:18:34] what just happened
[1:18:38] I mean God just shows himself around us
[1:18:43] that why he did not just drop
[1:18:48] they rub us off
[1:18:50] he still did not drop
[1:18:53] until it got where it was supposed to be
[1:18:58] praise God
[1:19:03] is just all around us
[1:19:06] all around us
[1:19:08] when you're on the highway it is there
[1:19:10] at work he is there at home he is there
[1:19:13] it's not only when you come to church
[1:19:16] he is with you every single moment of
[1:19:19] your life
[1:19:21] and wherever you are know that the
[1:19:23] angels of the Lord have been given
[1:19:25] church over you
[1:19:27] to keep you to Bear you up and to see
[1:19:30] you through
[1:19:33] praise be to God
[1:19:38] the title of my message this morning
[1:19:41] is
[1:19:48] shall he find faith
[1:19:52] when he comes
[1:19:57] shall he find faith when he comes that
[1:20:00] is the title of my message praise be to
[1:20:02] God
[1:20:21] so
[1:20:26] God
[1:20:29] would prove every child of his
[1:20:36] praise be to God
[1:20:41] the children of God saw God in Israel
[1:20:46] and in the wilderness as the Church of
[1:20:48] the Living God they saw God
[1:20:51] how God was performing
[1:20:54] now in the wilderness
[1:20:59] that was why
[1:21:01] the most trying moments
[1:21:03] came
[1:21:06] and it is our Wilderness Journey
[1:21:10] our Wilderness Journey with Christ
[1:21:13] that has the most problem
[1:21:18] that when you are going through that
[1:21:21] process of sanctification
[1:21:23] and God is cutting you to shape
[1:21:27] cutting you here and there
[1:21:29] cutting you here and there like you go
[1:21:32] to the Riverside and you dig yourself a
[1:21:33] piece of clay and you come and you mold
[1:21:36] it and sometimes you don't like how it
[1:21:38] looks you break it and you remold it you
[1:21:40] break it and you remold it that is what
[1:21:43] God does
[1:21:44] he will remold you a remote here and
[1:21:47] there cut you here left right and center
[1:21:49] and beg you
[1:21:53] and make sure
[1:21:59] that you are good
[1:22:01] praise be to God
[1:22:04] and can you imagine
[1:22:06] the way sometimes the people do to the
[1:22:08] clay and they break it if the clay had a
[1:22:11] voice
[1:22:12] can you imagine how many times the clay
[1:22:14] would complain
[1:22:19] And We complain about everything
[1:22:23] We complain about everything
[1:22:26] we fail to see that there is a God
[1:22:29] behind the scene that is pulling the
[1:22:31] strings
[1:22:34] We complain so much
[1:22:39] instead of devoting time to prayer
[1:22:42] because the created ourselves and
[1:22:44] seeking the face of God
[1:22:48] We complain about everything
[1:22:52] and the children of Israel the church
[1:22:54] the church in in the wilderness
[1:22:57] just complain a mermaid about anything
[1:22:59] everything
[1:23:01] till they did it for the last time
[1:23:08] for the last time
[1:23:11] that they had the word the word of God
[1:23:15] in their midst
[1:23:17] and they saw the word of God unfold in
[1:23:20] signs and wonders in their midst and yet
[1:23:25] they didn't believe
[1:23:27] they didn't believe
[1:23:30] God said I've given you the land
[1:23:33] but when there was
[1:23:35] Albania and Moses sent the 12 generals
[1:23:38] to go and spider land they came back
[1:23:40] with an evil report except Joshua and
[1:23:42] Caleb
[1:23:44] they said no we can't take the land we
[1:23:46] are as grasshoppers before them and they
[1:23:48] started memory God said I have given you
[1:23:51] the land now you are telling God that
[1:23:53] God is a liar
[1:23:57] shall he find faith
[1:23:59] shall he find faith
[1:24:02] when he comes
[1:24:07] they disbelieved the word
[1:24:09] they did not mix the word with faith
[1:24:13] shall he find faith when he comes
[1:24:21] in the death of Noah
[1:24:24] the Bible says
[1:24:26] there was sin
[1:24:28] everywhere on the land and God is
[1:24:31] repented God that he created man
[1:24:34] and God said he was going to destroy the
[1:24:37] Earth
[1:24:39] but Noah found favor
[1:24:43] with God
[1:24:44] the Bible says he found Grace
[1:24:48] and God extended that Grace
[1:24:51] to all the people
[1:24:54] because for the 120 years was building
[1:24:57] the ark he was preaching
[1:24:59] warning the people of an incoming danger
[1:25:02] the Judgment of God was coming they made
[1:25:06] fun of him and that they could just sit
[1:25:08] down and imagine how on Earth would
[1:25:11] water come from the skies
[1:25:13] it's not going to be this man may have
[1:25:16] lost his mind
[1:25:18] maybe they may have signed their
[1:25:20] instruments in the air and the
[1:25:22] instrument will go and come back and
[1:25:23] tell them oh there is not even a deal
[1:25:27] in the atmosphere don't mind what this
[1:25:30] man is saying he's lost his mind
[1:25:33] until finally
[1:25:37] Noah and his family
[1:25:39] entered the Ark
[1:25:42] and one morning they just woke up and
[1:25:44] they saw that the clouds had changed
[1:25:46] and the wind started to blow
[1:25:48] and they saw
[1:25:50] dripless coming they say oh it looks
[1:25:53] like oh this one has been saying all
[1:25:55] these years is true
[1:25:56] I wonder how many of them run today I
[1:25:58] can started pounding at the door
[1:26:00] but it was lit
[1:26:03] it was late
[1:26:05] when the grace of God has come down take
[1:26:09] advantage of it
[1:26:13] don't keep kicking the grace of God away
[1:26:16] like you are kicking account of an empty
[1:26:18] can of soda down the road
[1:26:23] when the grace of God when you have
[1:26:26] found favor with God
[1:26:31] take advantage of it
[1:26:34] it may not always be
[1:26:40] there would come a time
[1:26:43] that you are going to seek after it with
[1:26:45] tears
[1:26:47] and not find it
[1:26:51] when you can see God moving in your life
[1:26:53] when you can see God at work in your
[1:26:56] life
[1:26:57] take advantage of it
[1:27:00] don't let go of it take advantage
[1:27:07] when a dawn on them that all the things
[1:27:11] that I was saying was true
[1:27:13] it was too late
[1:27:18] we saw that in in in in Sodom and
[1:27:21] Gomorrah
[1:27:24] that they lived so much in sin
[1:27:29] so much evil on the land
[1:27:33] so much so
[1:27:36] that a man didn't even want women in
[1:27:39] their lives anymore neither did a woman
[1:27:43] man riding after man woman running after
[1:27:45] men so much so then when the
[1:27:48] investigating angels went to Sodom and
[1:27:51] Gomorrah because their sin had come up
[1:27:53] before God
[1:27:54] here they came
[1:27:56] in front of lost door
[1:27:58] we hear some Two Gentlemen came here and
[1:28:02] so what
[1:28:03] you need to release them to us
[1:28:05] let's say no I have two daughters who
[1:28:09] have never known men they are virgin no
[1:28:12] no we want a man
[1:28:16] they'll pull lot in and struggling with
[1:28:18] blindness and look God
[1:28:22] brought
[1:28:23] lot and his family
[1:28:26] we know the story how his wife
[1:28:30] turned into a pillar of salt
[1:28:34] because
[1:28:35] she turned back
[1:28:38] when the angel of the Lord told do not
[1:28:40] turn back
[1:28:42] do not turn back
[1:28:45] just focus just keep going
[1:28:49] and God reigned fire
[1:28:52] with Brimstone or Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:28:55] deserve it that is the same God we are
[1:28:58] talking about
[1:29:01] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:03] forever that God has not changed
[1:29:09] praise be to God for the blood
[1:29:12] praise be to God
[1:29:17] that God has not changed
[1:29:21] what he did yesterday
[1:29:23] he will do it today
[1:29:29] the Judgment of God
[1:29:32] fell upon these two cities
[1:29:36] and God consumed them
[1:29:41] the Bible says he that puts his son to
[1:29:43] the plow and turns back is not worthy of
[1:29:46] me
[1:29:51] keep your focus on Christ
[1:29:56] keep your focus
[1:29:59] if there is a little bit of God in you
[1:30:04] when you even sleep and you fall
[1:30:07] your focus is on him
[1:30:11] you will gather your life back together
[1:30:14] and you also keep your focus
[1:30:21] there is no way a sheep
[1:30:24] would find itself
[1:30:26] in a suspect
[1:30:29] and we just lie there and enjoy it
[1:30:32] because it wasn't meant for it
[1:30:35] a big one lady
[1:30:37] and enjoy it for years
[1:30:40] not a sheep
[1:30:43] the Sheep will cry and cry and cry
[1:30:46] till the shepherd comes for it
[1:30:53] if there is anything wrong with your
[1:30:55] life
[1:30:57] and you know it is not right
[1:31:02] you are hearing the word of God
[1:31:05] it is the grace of God to you
[1:31:08] repent
[1:31:10] put your life back to John track
[1:31:15] put your life back on track
[1:31:19] the devil will tell you or you can do it
[1:31:21] tomorrow you can do it tomorrow and
[1:31:23] before you are aware it's one year down
[1:31:25] the line and you have not done it
[1:31:32] there are people
[1:31:33] that have said to themselves tomorrow
[1:31:35] tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
[1:31:36] and then they live for 10 20 30 years
[1:31:39] and they died living in sin
[1:31:46] it is your life with Christ we are
[1:31:49] talking about
[1:31:52] there is a God we are serving
[1:31:55] and God is interested in every aspect of
[1:32:00] your life
[1:32:02] he is interested on in your Uprising and
[1:32:05] in your down sitting
[1:32:07] in good health in sickness
[1:32:11] in terms of Plenty in terms of nothing
[1:32:14] that God is there
[1:32:16] a friend when all other friends are
[1:32:19] around
[1:32:20] and he said he makes a friend on all
[1:32:23] those friends have gone away
[1:32:25] a friend that is with you in this life
[1:32:28] and the only friend that will be on the
[1:32:30] other side waiting to say welcome son
[1:32:34] praise be to God
[1:32:36] how on Earth can you sacrifice this
[1:32:41] how on Earth can anybody in their right
[1:32:45] mind
[1:32:46] look at a god of love
[1:32:49] the god that gave his all for you and me
[1:32:53] his very own life
[1:32:55] he gave it for you and me
[1:32:58] how can anybody look at this
[1:33:01] and then turn it down and rather want to
[1:33:04] still have fellowship with the Devil
[1:33:11] if the devil could repent
[1:33:14] he wouldn't be a devil
[1:33:17] he would have repented
[1:33:19] and you that have the opportunity
[1:33:22] to repent and seek the face of God
[1:33:26] you want to keep company with the Devil
[1:33:29] I don't know why this is going praise be
[1:33:31] together
[1:33:36] when he comes
[1:33:42] shall he find faith
[1:33:45] on earth when he comes
[1:33:49] shall he find faith
[1:33:55] when you have gone through your
[1:33:57] Wilderness Journey
[1:34:00] that determines
[1:34:03] what you have truly believed
[1:34:09] it is not an entirely bad thing
[1:34:13] when you think you are standing
[1:34:17] and then something happens and you
[1:34:19] realize that oh after all I wasn't
[1:34:21] standing
[1:34:23] it is not an entirely a bad thing
[1:34:29] it only becomes bad
[1:34:32] that when you have realized
[1:34:35] that you are not even standing after all
[1:34:38] and then you realize oh it's even okay
[1:34:42] that is when it gets bad
[1:34:46] but then when you can just get off
[1:34:50] with all those broken pieces
[1:34:54] and then you come with an honest heart
[1:34:58] it looks like I'm going ahead of him but
[1:35:00] I think I put something down
[1:35:02] very very close to this
[1:35:04] let me see if I can get it praise be to
[1:35:06] God
[1:35:19] we'll probably get there
[1:35:23] as I told you
[1:35:24] I wrote in ink
[1:35:27] and everything looks like one sentence
[1:35:32] praise God
[1:35:35] so are you going to keep the faith
[1:35:38] are you going to keep the faith
[1:35:44] God will not just take you from the
[1:35:46] street
[1:35:48] and then just give you his Spirit like
[1:35:49] that no
[1:35:51] it doesn't just happen
[1:35:54] it's like picking a glass from there
[1:35:56] from the trash can and then just coming
[1:35:58] home filling it with water and then you
[1:36:00] start drinking who does that
[1:36:04] and God wouldn't do that
[1:36:06] God is going to wash you
[1:36:09] he's going to patch you it's going to
[1:36:12] cleanse you it's going to make sure that
[1:36:15] you are in tune
[1:36:17] you are in tune with this word then he
[1:36:20] gives you his holy spirit
[1:36:24] but that process
[1:36:27] is where a lot of us
[1:36:30] get stuck
[1:36:33] that we don't endure that sound
[1:36:37] chastening of the Lord
[1:36:41] that when we begin to go through things
[1:36:46] we are quick to find a way out
[1:36:51] immediately we are looking for the exit
[1:36:53] door
[1:36:55] when situations are coming into our
[1:36:57] lives
[1:36:59] we are ready to turn our backs on Christ
[1:37:04] and we fail to see the hand of God that
[1:37:07] is working in our lives
[1:37:10] God working in our lives to bring us
[1:37:12] onto an expected end for his namesake
[1:37:22] we have seen
[1:37:25] we have seen
[1:37:29] all of us here in one way or the other
[1:37:32] have pasted of the Deliverance of God
[1:37:36] else you will not be here
[1:37:39] the reason we we come here every Sunday
[1:37:43] every Wednesday whether it's raining
[1:37:46] whether it is snowing it doesn't matter
[1:37:48] the distance
[1:37:49] when the child doors are open we want to
[1:37:52] be in church
[1:37:54] it is because
[1:37:55] we have tested of God
[1:38:01] we are not just here
[1:38:03] as a number
[1:38:05] no
[1:38:07] there is something in you
[1:38:09] that is driving you here
[1:38:13] so in one way or the other we have all
[1:38:17] seen
[1:38:19] the arm of God
[1:38:21] revealed in our lives
[1:38:26] Earth will not be coming and going
[1:38:31] but if for any reason
[1:38:34] there is anybody here that is just
[1:38:36] coming and going
[1:38:39] then you need to seek the face of God
[1:38:41] more earnestly
[1:38:43] because there is more
[1:38:46] to just come in and going
[1:38:49] there is something beyond that
[1:38:52] praise be to God
[1:38:59] now
[1:39:00] when you look at
[1:39:03] in the days
[1:39:07] when God delivered Israel
[1:39:09] that out of the two million people
[1:39:12] that were delivered only two
[1:39:15] crossed over
[1:39:18] and then you look at the deaths of Noah
[1:39:23] out of all the people that lived
[1:39:29] only Noah his wife his three sons and
[1:39:31] their daughters I mean
[1:39:33] wise eight people eight
[1:39:38] eight people made it over
[1:39:42] and then he looked at Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:39:49] only three people Lord and his two
[1:39:52] daughters
[1:39:55] sometimes you can't force you can't help
[1:39:58] but begin to do some calculation
[1:40:03] if out of 2 million
[1:40:06] only two were saved
[1:40:08] and then only it in Noah's time
[1:40:12] and the only three in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:40:17] where do I stand
[1:40:20] it is not for you
[1:40:23] to start making any calculation
[1:40:28] the devil knows that math more than you
[1:40:30] do
[1:40:32] and if you ever want to go that route
[1:40:35] you are going to be in trouble
[1:40:40] instead of you sitting down and making
[1:40:43] the calculation I would advise you
[1:40:47] to take an inventory of your life
[1:40:50] and see where you stand with God
[1:40:54] see where you are
[1:40:56] Christ
[1:40:58] instead of doing that calculation
[1:41:02] don't look at you
[1:41:05] the sacrifice that was slain on our
[1:41:07] behalf
[1:41:08] was a worthy sacrifice
[1:41:11] and our lives are saved is that what we
[1:41:13] are looking at we are not looking at
[1:41:15] what we can do
[1:41:19] praise be to God
[1:41:22] when God sent Jonah to ninevee
[1:41:26] God does not take the Delight
[1:41:29] in destroying his own
[1:41:33] he is a god of love yes
[1:41:36] without a doubt
[1:41:39] when Jonah went to ninevee
[1:41:42] and then he cried against that City and
[1:41:45] told them of the Judgment of God coming
[1:41:47] down
[1:41:50] from the King to his servant
[1:41:54] from man and beasts young and old
[1:41:59] they procla came the fast
[1:42:01] and the bread and they saw the face of
[1:42:03] God
[1:42:05] and the wrath of God
[1:42:07] was staying away
[1:42:13] the wrath of God
[1:42:16] was stand away
[1:42:22] this is the God we are talking about
[1:42:26] he doesn't take the Delights
[1:42:31] the Bible says
[1:42:33] um
[1:42:34] can we open to
[1:42:37] some
[1:42:40] 51 I think it should be
[1:42:43] Psalm 51
[1:42:46] yes 51 17.
[1:43:00] 51 17.
[1:43:14] the sacrifices of God
[1:43:18] are a broken spirit
[1:43:22] and a broken and a contrite heart oh God
[1:43:26] that will not despise
[1:43:31] now
[1:43:32] I tried to find out
[1:43:35] what's this word
[1:43:36] contrite
[1:43:38] what it means
[1:43:44] and a contrite heart
[1:43:47] means to be humbled
[1:43:51] by your own sins and failures
[1:43:56] seeking after God
[1:43:59] and the Bible says a broken and a
[1:44:03] contrite spirit
[1:44:05] God would not despise
[1:44:08] to be humbled by your own sins
[1:44:13] not by somebody else's sins
[1:44:16] oh this brother or this sister this is
[1:44:20] what we are going through this is God
[1:44:22] what you have done how about you how
[1:44:24] about you
[1:44:27] sometimes we have the beam in our eyes
[1:44:31] we don't see that
[1:44:33] but we rather see this pack in somebody
[1:44:35] else's eyes
[1:44:37] first take the beam out of your eyes so
[1:44:40] you can see clearly to take the spec
[1:44:42] from somebody else's eyes
[1:44:47] not being humbled
[1:44:49] by somebody else's sins of failures
[1:44:55] but being humbled by your own sins
[1:45:00] and failures
[1:45:03] a broken and contrite heart
[1:45:06] God would not despise
[1:45:10] that you don't blame people for your
[1:45:12] failures
[1:45:13] you don't blame people for living in sin
[1:45:16] because they did this because they said
[1:45:18] this I am going to do it anyhow
[1:45:25] taking responsibility
[1:45:28] for your errors
[1:45:30] take a responsibility for your mistakes
[1:45:33] take a responsibility for your failures
[1:45:36] taking responsibility for your sins
[1:45:40] and not put into anybody
[1:45:43] and then you can come before God
[1:45:46] with humility
[1:45:49] not with arrogance
[1:45:51] come giving excuses why you did it you
[1:45:54] can never justify sin
[1:45:57] what is evil is evil what is Sin is Sin
[1:46:01] sin can never be justified
[1:46:05] never come before God giving an excuse
[1:46:08] or excuses or reasons why you did what
[1:46:12] you did
[1:46:13] if it is wrong it is wrong
[1:46:17] if it is wrong it's wrong
[1:46:22] come with humility
[1:46:24] with a broken and a contrite heart
[1:46:28] God would never turn you away
[1:46:32] God would never turn your way
[1:46:36] and God saw that demonstrated in any way
[1:46:42] when Jonah cried against their sins
[1:46:45] God sought through humility
[1:46:48] and that's right out to God and God had
[1:46:51] them
[1:46:54] thank God God is not a man
[1:46:58] Jonah was not happy
[1:47:02] when Jonah cried against the city and
[1:47:04] wanted to sat down under that tree he
[1:47:06] wanted to see fire come down
[1:47:09] God is such a man
[1:47:12] if God was like you and me
[1:47:15] oh my goodness
[1:47:18] there is no flesh
[1:47:20] that was going to be saved
[1:47:23] but God is long-suffering towards us
[1:47:27] he is patience
[1:47:29] patient with you
[1:47:31] we ought to be patient with one another
[1:47:35] praise be to God
[1:47:39] we are serving a mighty God
[1:47:42] kiss
[1:47:44] do you care
[1:47:50] we don't have to be Reckless with our
[1:47:52] lives
[1:47:53] and no
[1:47:55] always remember
[1:47:57] never let that lose your mind always
[1:48:01] remember who you are
[1:48:04] that is very very important
[1:48:07] and this work with Christ
[1:48:10] be to God
[1:48:12] shall he find faith
[1:48:15] shall he find faith on earth when he
[1:48:17] comes
[1:48:20] as it was in the days of Noah
[1:48:23] so shall it be
[1:48:25] in the days of the son of man
[1:48:28] praise be to God some people think they
[1:48:31] can outsmart God
[1:48:32] you can never outsmart God
[1:48:37] I remember in the year 2000
[1:48:40] I was still a prison officer I stationed
[1:48:43] in tarkwa western region western part of
[1:48:46] uh Ghana
[1:48:48] um and then
[1:48:50] the
[1:48:54] um
[1:48:55] the New Year Eve the New Year Eve
[1:49:00] normally we have a watch night
[1:49:03] and it is just it is just the norm
[1:49:09] in Ghana
[1:49:11] New Year Eve that is there is there is
[1:49:15] uh a watch night you just go and you
[1:49:18] pray your way through the night into the
[1:49:20] following morning
[1:49:21] and I remember very well in the year
[1:49:25] 2000 December 31st I was on duty
[1:49:29] and I was working so I was I was in
[1:49:33] there
[1:49:34] um based on open prison
[1:49:37] um
[1:49:38] you are there it's just four corners no
[1:49:41] let me see
[1:49:42] I I don't remember again but I believe
[1:49:45] it was
[1:49:46] now praise the Lord
[1:49:49] so that night my goodness
[1:49:54] the atmosphere was charged
[1:49:58] you could hear all the churches in the
[1:50:02] city
[1:50:04] literally praying
[1:50:06] praying and singing
[1:50:09] the atmosphere was charged
[1:50:12] now
[1:50:13] they were saying
[1:50:16] that from from from the beginning of the
[1:50:19] creation to uh the time of the flood is
[1:50:23] two thousand years from that time to
[1:50:25] Christ two thousand years so now it's
[1:50:29] another 2000 years
[1:50:31] something is going to happen
[1:50:33] and they were on fire
[1:50:35] because what is 2000 years and something
[1:50:38] is going to happen
[1:50:43] they were on fire
[1:50:46] and nothing happened
[1:50:49] it's
[1:50:50] 2023.
[1:50:52] nothing has happened
[1:50:54] there is a cool enough
[1:50:59] they had
[1:51:01] that they waited on the Lord
[1:51:04] that Zeal has left them
[1:51:07] the way they were keeping themselves
[1:51:09] because something is going to happen
[1:51:13] because they're creating themselves and
[1:51:15] nothing happened
[1:51:16] they just went back to their old ways
[1:51:18] like a dog going back to his vomit
[1:51:22] but there is a looming Danger
[1:51:24] there is a looming Danger
[1:51:27] if man can only see the grace of God
[1:51:30] there is a little bit Danger
[1:51:35] they have cooled off
[1:51:38] it was just the same way
[1:51:40] with the children of Israel in the
[1:51:42] wilderness
[1:51:43] when Moses went up the mountain
[1:51:45] and they waited and waited and waited we
[1:51:48] don't even know what has become of this
[1:51:49] Moses
[1:51:50] whether he's even alive or not
[1:51:53] and
[1:51:54] it's just always the nature of man
[1:51:59] and they prevailed on Aaron
[1:52:02] to get them an idol
[1:52:04] and they started worshiping the idol
[1:52:07] instead of the Living God
[1:52:10] and today
[1:52:12] people have waited for so long according
[1:52:16] to them
[1:52:17] and they have not seen anything
[1:52:20] and they are going back into the world
[1:52:23] even people in this message
[1:52:28] people that oh my goodness
[1:52:35] praise the Lord
[1:52:40] people that have preached this message
[1:52:44] people that once upon a time we were
[1:52:47] looking after
[1:52:50] drawing encouragement from
[1:52:53] they have abandoned their faith
[1:52:57] why because something happened
[1:53:05] in some cases because they have waited
[1:53:07] for too long
[1:53:11] they have gone back to the world
[1:53:16] but the Bible says
[1:53:19] in Matthew
[1:53:22] 24 if we can turn there for a minute
[1:53:26] foreign
[1:53:38] Matthew 24 43
[1:53:49] Matthew 24 43.
[1:53:54] and I read
[1:53:59] but know this the Lord Jesus has spoken
[1:54:03] that if the good man of the house had
[1:54:06] known in what hour
[1:54:08] the thief would come
[1:54:11] he would have watched
[1:54:13] and would not have suffered his house
[1:54:16] to be broken up
[1:54:19] 44 therefore be ye also ready
[1:54:24] for is such an hour as you think not
[1:54:28] the son of man cometh
[1:54:32] praise be to God
[1:54:35] so you come up a strategy for God
[1:54:38] it was like this purple knew one day
[1:54:41] when when the teeth was coming
[1:54:44] they say oh the thief there's a thief
[1:54:47] coming
[1:54:48] and the chief is going to come in
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:55] there is a chief coming
[1:54:59] and the thief is going to come in at 12
[1:55:01] 30.
[1:55:02] so and he's coming through this main
[1:55:05] door
[1:55:06] so let me sit here and wait for him
[1:55:12] the teeth is smarter than that
[1:55:17] maybe those those thieves does Taylor
[1:55:21] cassava Casa cassava and goats
[1:55:26] but thieves are very smart
[1:55:29] if you want very very smart people
[1:55:32] they are very smart
[1:55:34] but in the wrong way
[1:55:41] and and and and as a matter of fact
[1:55:45] the criminals are always ahead of us
[1:55:51] you look at the FBI and the and the CIA
[1:55:54] and other police
[1:55:56] before they get to realize this is what
[1:55:58] they are doing they have done it for so
[1:56:00] long
[1:56:02] they are very smart
[1:56:04] in the wrong things
[1:56:08] not even come when you're awake
[1:56:11] they will come when you are snoring
[1:56:16] and then you somebody would tap your
[1:56:18] hand on the back and then you think it's
[1:56:20] your your baby oh that disturb me I want
[1:56:23] to sleep and then you wake up and there
[1:56:25] is a gun to your head
[1:56:29] that is how they're in there
[1:56:33] and the Bible is saying that he is going
[1:56:35] to come in as a thief
[1:56:38] when you least expect
[1:56:43] when you are in bed snoring
[1:56:45] spiritually not physically it's a good
[1:56:49] thing to have good sleep
[1:56:51] if you snore like me
[1:56:54] you don't have a problem
[1:56:56] I don't know it's like everybody in
[1:56:58] America I don't know it's not everybody
[1:56:59] though let me know everybody but I
[1:57:02] wasn't snoring when I was in God
[1:57:09] yeah I don't know what is the air water
[1:57:12] is the cold I don't know
[1:57:16] I can snow in the world has to be
[1:57:18] shaking
[1:57:24] praise the Lord
[1:57:26] yes
[1:57:28] so spiritually
[1:57:30] if you go to bed
[1:57:33] and you are at peace
[1:57:35] and when you are supposed to be praying
[1:57:36] and consecrating your life
[1:57:40] and meaning business with God
[1:57:42] and you think all is all right
[1:57:45] you have become so complacent
[1:57:48] and you decide to relax
[1:57:53] you are going to be taking on our voice
[1:57:57] it is not the unbeliever
[1:58:00] that is going to be taken by surprise
[1:58:04] he doesn't care about anything
[1:58:07] I have seen people that say there is no
[1:58:09] God
[1:58:14] and there are people that will tell you
[1:58:15] that don't believe in anything I am a
[1:58:17] free thinker
[1:58:23] but
[1:58:24] you and me no better than that
[1:58:29] we know there is a God
[1:58:33] we know that we are not just here
[1:58:38] to stay
[1:58:40] we know we have a place to go
[1:58:44] we know that the life we are living is
[1:58:46] no longer ours
[1:58:49] we've been bought and paid for
[1:58:52] by the blood
[1:58:55] we belong to Christ
[1:58:59] there is a life
[1:59:01] God expects of you and me
[1:59:07] if you deceive yourself
[1:59:12] or if you want to deceive people
[1:59:17] you are going to be found out
[1:59:24] make sure
[1:59:26] that you are working at your salvation
[1:59:29] with fear
[1:59:37] do not take the grace of God
[1:59:40] for granted
[1:59:42] praise the Lord
[1:59:44] now
[1:59:47] when the son of man comes shall he find
[1:59:49] faith
[1:59:51] shall he find faith
[1:59:54] of
[2:00:02] when the son of man comes shall he find
[2:00:04] faith
[2:00:06] praise the Lord
[2:00:09] that is what we are talking about this
[2:00:11] morning
[2:00:17] thank God
[2:00:19] that he has sent us a prophet
[2:00:22] because the mystery
[2:00:24] of America 4 5 and 6.
[2:00:27] is to turn
[2:00:30] our hearts
[2:00:32] to the faith of apostolic fathers
[2:00:37] behold I will send you later
[2:00:39] before the coming of the Great and the
[2:00:41] Deathly of the Lord and He Shall attend
[2:00:44] Earth of the fathers to the children and
[2:00:47] the Heart of the children to their
[2:00:48] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[2:00:51] with a case
[2:00:58] is Ministry
[2:01:00] the message God has sent us
[2:01:05] is to direct our hearts back
[2:01:09] to the faith that was once delivered to
[2:01:11] the Saints
[2:01:13] to the Faith of Our Apostolic fathers
[2:01:17] it's a proven Ministry
[2:01:21] God has Vindicated it
[2:01:24] with signs and wonders following
[2:01:29] and wherever this message went
[2:01:31] the pillar of fire was there to
[2:01:33] vindicate his word
[2:01:35] the angel of the Covenant was there
[2:01:37] praise be to God
[2:01:40] all to turn our hearts back to the faith
[2:01:46] of our fathers
[2:01:48] shall he find faith
[2:01:50] when he comes
[2:01:53] remember you are supposed to be flesh of
[2:01:56] his flesh
[2:01:57] both of his bones and spirits of his
[2:02:00] Spirit praise be to God and this message
[2:02:03] has come to deliver us
[2:02:06] to deliver us
[2:02:09] from our sins our iniquities
[2:02:12] our superstition
[2:02:14] traditions
[2:02:16] customs
[2:02:18] failure to the kingdom of God
[2:02:21] and it is the spirit of the age
[2:02:25] that overcomes
[2:02:28] it is not you
[2:02:30] we have to submit ourselves to the will
[2:02:32] of God if we want to see the glory of
[2:02:34] God
[2:02:36] it is this message
[2:02:38] that overcomes the spirit of the age
[2:02:41] outside of it I don't know how you are
[2:02:45] going to do it
[2:02:46] if you find something outside of this
[2:02:48] message let me know about it
[2:03:00] in the message
[2:03:03] oh Lord once more the prophet of God
[2:03:06] says do you know that the Roman Catholic
[2:03:10] Church
[2:03:11] was the first original Pentecostal
[2:03:14] Church
[2:03:16] it taken them two thousand years
[2:03:19] to get in the condition is God's
[2:03:23] today
[2:03:28] and then he goes on to say and if they
[2:03:31] Pentecostal organization keeps on
[2:03:34] another 50 years it will be worse than
[2:03:37] the Catholic Church
[2:03:39] that's right
[2:03:41] sin heaping on every side
[2:03:45] now when you read something like this it
[2:03:48] makes your hair to spin for a while
[2:03:52] that the Roman Catholic Church will see
[2:03:54] today
[2:03:56] Once Upon a Time
[2:04:00] Once Upon a Time
[2:04:01] was not in this condition
[2:04:06] that once upon a time
[2:04:08] that stood for what was right stood for
[2:04:10] the word
[2:04:11] believe in Miracle science and wonders
[2:04:14] and the prophet of God is saying it has
[2:04:16] taken them two thousand years to get
[2:04:19] where they are now
[2:04:22] and he's saying
[2:04:24] that this Pentecostal organization
[2:04:28] give it another 50 years
[2:04:30] and it will be worse
[2:04:32] than the Catholic Church
[2:04:34] what does that tell you
[2:04:37] now when you look at the way God deals
[2:04:40] that in in all the seven Church ages now
[2:04:43] God sends a prophet to the people and
[2:04:46] then he can't say he puts that right
[2:04:47] back in track
[2:04:48] and then gives them the word of God and
[2:04:51] then when God takes the man out of the
[2:04:53] sin oh they are happy for a while they
[2:04:56] are living by the word for a while and
[2:04:58] then after a while they start drifting
[2:05:00] away from the right track
[2:05:04] till you look at them and you don't even
[2:05:07] know why they stand
[2:05:09] and God has to send
[2:05:12] another prophet to come and bring them
[2:05:15] back
[2:05:16] now when you look at it this will begin
[2:05:19] to come together
[2:05:22] we are in the last Church age
[2:05:26] the seventh Church age
[2:05:29] we are not looking forward to any more
[2:05:31] Church ages the prophet of God for this
[2:05:33] age has come and gone he has given us
[2:05:36] the message of God
[2:05:38] and now
[2:05:43] it will surprise you
[2:05:45] how people in this message
[2:05:47] churches have already started
[2:05:50] denominating
[2:05:53] now
[2:05:54] another 50 years
[2:05:57] I don't know how it's going to be
[2:05:59] if Christ carries
[2:06:02] another 100 years
[2:06:04] I don't know how it's going to be
[2:06:10] and
[2:06:12] the Bible says
[2:06:16] in Matthew 24 22
[2:06:19] that accept the days be shortened
[2:06:22] they shall no flesh
[2:06:24] saved
[2:06:28] there is more to it than this can we
[2:06:30] just open to it Matthew 22 24
[2:06:42] Matthew 24 22
[2:06:48] and accept those days except those days
[2:06:51] should be shortened
[2:06:54] there shall no flesh be saved
[2:06:56] but for the elect's sake
[2:07:00] those days shall be shortened
[2:07:03] praise be to God
[2:07:05] for the elect's sake
[2:07:09] those days shall be shortened
[2:07:12] but if those days are not shortened
[2:07:15] it is not it's going to be dangerous
[2:07:20] it is not
[2:07:22] an easy thing
[2:07:24] when the son of man
[2:07:26] comes
[2:07:28] shall he find faith
[2:07:31] there is so much sin
[2:07:35] on Earth today
[2:07:39] since
[2:07:41] that we didn't have name for
[2:07:44] 20 30 40 years ago
[2:07:46] they have names for it now
[2:07:51] things you couldn't just imagine
[2:07:55] are happening right now
[2:07:57] in the day and age we are living in
[2:08:01] there is so much sin
[2:08:06] that
[2:08:08] people's faith
[2:08:10] in God is waxing cold
[2:08:16] sin on every side
[2:08:20] sin on every side
[2:08:28] when you look at what happened in Sodom
[2:08:31] and Gomorrah
[2:08:34] and then you look at the country in
[2:08:36] which you are living today
[2:08:43] it tells you
[2:08:45] that we are very very close to the end
[2:08:51] there is a looming Danger
[2:08:55] there is Judgment that is waiting to
[2:08:58] fall
[2:09:03] very things that
[2:09:09] is we are doing it today
[2:09:12] we are doing it today here in America
[2:09:16] and not only are we doing here in
[2:09:18] America but America has become the
[2:09:23] how do I call it
[2:09:27] the ambassadors
[2:09:30] they have become the ambassadors
[2:09:35] to this evil
[2:09:37] because a whole sitting president
[2:09:42] flies a whole jet Air Force One
[2:09:46] somewhere in Africa
[2:09:48] and then he goes Africa has a lot of
[2:09:51] problems
[2:09:54] the disease the poverty the economic
[2:09:58] climate and all that you can mention
[2:10:01] and they go and they don't talk about
[2:10:03] any of those things but they go and they
[2:10:05] are telling the president and his people
[2:10:07] to to to legalize gay and lesbian
[2:10:10] marriage
[2:10:12] is it not a shame
[2:10:15] and years later a vice president a city
[2:10:18] Vice President also gets up and flies a
[2:10:21] plane against Africa to go and propagate
[2:10:24] the same message
[2:10:29] to go and propagate the same message
[2:10:31] it's okay for a man to marry man woman
[2:10:34] to marry a woman
[2:10:39] the Judgment of God
[2:10:41] has come down
[2:10:44] the world has become so so sinful
[2:10:47] that is why President says that God if
[2:10:51] God does not destroyed this Earth that
[2:10:53] does not destroy America
[2:10:56] he would have to go and resurrect
[2:10:58] the people in Sodom and Gomorrah and
[2:11:01] apologize to them
[2:11:04] because the very thing they did that God
[2:11:07] destroyed them
[2:11:08] that is what this country is doing today
[2:11:12] that is what they are doing today
[2:11:15] is so stinky
[2:11:18] my goodness
[2:11:19] at work in the neighborhood in the store
[2:11:22] they don't hide it
[2:11:24] what a shame
[2:11:27] Lord have mercy
[2:11:32] if you put hundred dogs together dogs
[2:11:37] you can never get
[2:11:39] a male dog running after a male dog
[2:11:42] and human beings with conscience
[2:11:46] your conscience must be dead
[2:11:49] your conscience must be dead
[2:11:54] live abominable lives
[2:11:56] and they call it human rights
[2:11:59] Lord have mercy
[2:12:04] and and even what I find strange
[2:12:08] what I find strange
[2:12:10] that when God destroyed
[2:12:14] Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:12:15] when God destroyed the Earth with flood
[2:12:19] he gave a sign
[2:12:21] the Rambo
[2:12:24] that he will no longer destroy the Earth
[2:12:27] by water
[2:12:29] and what amazes me
[2:12:32] is that of all the colors
[2:12:37] they're right in the world
[2:12:41] these people in the alphabet community
[2:12:45] have chosen to go
[2:12:48] for the rainbow colors
[2:12:54] they have chosen to go for the rainbow
[2:12:57] colors
[2:12:58] because when you see the rainbow it
[2:13:01] reminds you of the Judgment that fell on
[2:13:03] on the people in the Solomon I mean in
[2:13:06] the deaths of Noah that's what it is it
[2:13:08] reminds you of
[2:13:11] that God destroyed the Earth with a
[2:13:13] flood
[2:13:15] and has given us a sign that he will no
[2:13:17] longer do it by War
[2:13:19] that is what it brings to you
[2:13:21] and then you have a people that will go
[2:13:24] and take the same rainbow he said you
[2:13:26] know what we know you destroy the Earth
[2:13:29] with water because the people were
[2:13:31] living in sin but you know what we are
[2:13:33] going to do it and we are going to use
[2:13:35] it as our colors
[2:13:39] that is what it means to me what else
[2:13:42] it's like they are daring God
[2:13:46] it's like they are daring God
[2:13:50] last week not last week last two weeks
[2:13:55] Wednesday I have never seen that side
[2:13:58] before
[2:14:00] we were coming to church
[2:14:03] and get it to 94 East
[2:14:06] there was a rainbow
[2:14:08] it's rendered
[2:14:11] I came in a little late
[2:14:14] because the storm was so bad in Saint
[2:14:17] Michael
[2:14:19] and I came and met some branches here I
[2:14:21] knew it was also the same way here there
[2:14:23] was a rainbow
[2:14:25] and another rainbow
[2:14:27] inside of rainbow I have never seen that
[2:14:30] in my life
[2:14:32] two rainbows
[2:14:35] it was so beautiful and as I was driving
[2:14:38] with my wife and a model and gospel I
[2:14:41] said
[2:14:42] this is just a confirmation
[2:14:44] that God said he will not destroy the
[2:14:47] Earth with the flood anymore but it is
[2:14:49] also a confirmation
[2:14:51] that God is going to destroy this Earth
[2:14:54] by this time it is not with flood
[2:14:58] I have never seen it
[2:15:01] praise be to God I don't know what it
[2:15:04] means
[2:15:05] but that was what I was telling them in
[2:15:07] the car
[2:15:10] there is so much evil
[2:15:12] so much evil
[2:15:15] oh my goodness people don't have
[2:15:17] conscience anymore
[2:15:19] oh my Lord have mercy
[2:15:22] Lord have mercy
[2:15:24] that this people can choose to do
[2:15:26] anything they want to do
[2:15:28] and it's fine
[2:15:30] but if you a Christian
[2:15:32] should attack them
[2:15:36] it becomes a problem
[2:15:39] they were matching they were matching
[2:15:41] one day
[2:15:43] any Christian woman that was preaching
[2:15:45] they went and harassed the woman
[2:15:48] and that case didn't go anywhere
[2:15:52] and I was wondering
[2:15:54] if it was the other way around
[2:15:57] oh the news Atlas we're going to talk
[2:16:00] about it
[2:16:03] that is how low
[2:16:05] we have sunk as a nation
[2:16:09] we have sang so low
[2:16:12] that we can't sing anymore
[2:16:16] because we have hit rock bottom
[2:16:24] we are living in the most difficult
[2:16:26] times
[2:16:28] without a doubt
[2:16:30] in the most challenging times
[2:16:34] in the most challenging times
[2:16:36] when I was growing
[2:16:38] you would have to get up
[2:16:40] and then walk several miles or take a
[2:16:43] car
[2:16:44] to go somewhere to go and watch a
[2:16:46] television or to go and watch a movie
[2:16:49] but we are living in an age where you
[2:16:52] can just be in the comfort of your room
[2:16:54] and misbehave if you want to
[2:16:58] that is how dangerous
[2:17:00] the world has become
[2:17:02] there is so much Darkness
[2:17:04] on the land today
[2:17:07] so my spiritual Darkness on the land
[2:17:09] today
[2:17:10] but you know also
[2:17:12] you know also
[2:17:13] my goodness
[2:17:16] you know
[2:17:19] light
[2:17:20] does not shine in the light
[2:17:26] praise the Lord
[2:17:29] and light shines brightest in darkness
[2:17:38] in a time and age we are living in why
[2:17:40] there is so much Darkness on the land
[2:17:45] look
[2:17:46] you don't even need too much light
[2:17:50] shine
[2:17:54] the little light in you
[2:17:58] would shine
[2:18:01] tell us who you are
[2:18:07] what the grace of God can do
[2:18:10] in the life of a man
[2:18:15] praise be to God
[2:18:21] I'll be wrapping up very soon it's 1 12.
[2:18:24] praise God
[2:18:25] now
[2:18:44] when the son of man comes
[2:18:47] shall he find faith
[2:18:51] faith
[2:18:53] come here by hearing
[2:18:55] and hearing by the word of God
[2:18:59] there are a lot of side attractions
[2:19:05] on this path
[2:19:07] we've been called to walk on
[2:19:10] and those side attractions
[2:19:13] are not meant
[2:19:15] to help you
[2:19:17] in your work with God
[2:19:19] they are meant to distract you
[2:19:24] that if care is not taken
[2:19:27] and then you get to a place
[2:19:29] and you say let me just stand and turn
[2:19:32] for a moment
[2:19:35] you can never guarantee what will happen
[2:19:37] next
[2:19:40] there are a lot of side attractions
[2:19:47] don't look left
[2:19:49] don't look right
[2:19:53] keep your focus
[2:19:55] Freight
[2:19:58] keep feeding on the word of God
[2:20:01] Faith come over hearing and hearing by
[2:20:04] the word of God keep feeding on the word
[2:20:10] if the word that created the Heaven and
[2:20:14] Earth
[2:20:15] abides in you
[2:20:18] that word will transform your life
[2:20:23] that word in you will take you to places
[2:20:27] you never dreamed of
[2:20:30] only if
[2:20:34] you give room to the word to work on you
[2:20:41] cannot find place in your heart
[2:20:44] if you cannot entertain the word
[2:20:48] the word will not have any effect in
[2:20:50] your life
[2:20:54] it is not time
[2:20:58] to seek recognition
[2:21:01] don't expect people to come and party on
[2:21:03] the back
[2:21:05] don't expect people to come pleading
[2:21:07] with you
[2:21:10] no
[2:21:12] you should know by now
[2:21:14] Who You Are
[2:21:16] you should know by now why you stand
[2:21:26] straight is the gate
[2:21:29] and narrow is the way that leads to life
[2:21:32] and few Debbie
[2:21:38] my blood is the way that leads to
[2:21:40] destruction
[2:21:46] the way of Christ is not a popular way
[2:21:49] to go
[2:21:50] but that is the way of life
[2:21:54] that is the path
[2:21:57] God has chosen and ordained for you and
[2:22:01] me
[2:22:06] Once Upon a Time
[2:22:10] the horse
[2:22:14] and the Tortoise
[2:22:16] were put together
[2:22:18] in a race
[2:22:21] and you guys know by now that I love
[2:22:23] stories
[2:22:26] because this story was told to me by uh
[2:22:29] gospel
[2:22:31] he came from school one day he said hey
[2:22:33] do you want to hear a story I said yes
[2:22:37] he said there was there was a race
[2:22:39] between a tortoise and a horse
[2:22:44] and um when they started the race
[2:22:48] the horse just went and left the
[2:22:49] tortoise
[2:22:51] by the the whole the horse got replaced
[2:22:53] and then started to rest
[2:22:56] and then he slept
[2:22:58] and the Tortoise came
[2:23:00] and overtook it
[2:23:03] and went and won the race
[2:23:06] praise be to God
[2:23:09] so we are going to fill in the gaps
[2:23:13] that there was a race between a tortoise
[2:23:15] and a horse
[2:23:17] and when you look at it
[2:23:19] a tortoise a tortoise and a horse it's
[2:23:23] not fair right
[2:23:29] but they were put together in a race
[2:23:33] and all the people that came
[2:23:36] everybody
[2:23:38] threw their weights
[2:23:41] behind the horse
[2:23:44] they look at the Majestic nature of the
[2:23:46] horse
[2:23:47] so beautiful
[2:23:50] that they can sit on it
[2:23:52] and ride it
[2:23:55] patting it on the back and playing with
[2:23:57] it
[2:24:00] they found favor with them
[2:24:02] and then look at this poor creature
[2:24:05] put this down there
[2:24:08] that nobody can play with
[2:24:11] I don't know if anybody keeps a tortoise
[2:24:13] for a pet
[2:24:17] I will not be surprised if they do it
[2:24:20] because I know of somebody that has
[2:24:22] snake for a pet
[2:24:28] and if I have to keep a snake for a pet
[2:24:30] I'd rather go in for a tourist
[2:24:33] s
[2:24:36] and then you look at this mean fellow
[2:24:38] down there that you can't even pet
[2:24:41] because if you make a mistake your hand
[2:24:43] goes in between the shells it's going to
[2:24:45] clip it
[2:24:48] and then they put them together in a
[2:24:50] race
[2:24:54] get ready go
[2:24:56] and the horse was gone
[2:24:59] completely gone
[2:25:01] and then here comes the tortoise
[2:25:04] and people were making fun of it
[2:25:06] making fun of it just one step at a time
[2:25:09] one step at a time one step at a time
[2:25:13] and then the horse
[2:25:15] gets to the muddy area and then he
[2:25:18] decides to stop
[2:25:20] to rest
[2:25:22] and days later
[2:25:24] here comes the tortoise
[2:25:27] and then the toilet comes to meet it
[2:25:29] and they have to cross this Mighty area
[2:25:31] the horse said no I am not going this
[2:25:34] way I am too clear for this
[2:25:37] this mess I'm not going to work in it
[2:25:40] by the tortoise one step at a time it
[2:25:43] goes in the
[2:25:45] one step at a time just swimming in the
[2:25:47] mud crosses there
[2:25:49] and the horse says I know a better route
[2:25:53] and they took a route
[2:25:55] over speeding and it crashed and died it
[2:25:58] never made it
[2:26:01] so there is a way
[2:26:04] that has been ordained for you and me
[2:26:09] and me you may not like it
[2:26:12] you don't have to like it
[2:26:15] but it is a word has been chosen
[2:26:18] a word has been ordained for you and me
[2:26:21] that sometimes in your work with God you
[2:26:25] get to that place
[2:26:26] and you look at the situation
[2:26:28] tell yourself no I don't think I want to
[2:26:31] go through this
[2:26:33] but if there is a little bit of God in
[2:26:35] you
[2:26:36] you would go through it for the glory of
[2:26:38] God
[2:26:39] praise be to God
[2:26:42] that people don't have to party on the
[2:26:45] back
[2:26:45] you don't have to achieve those I mean
[2:26:48] get those accolades
[2:26:50] you know they don't have to they don't
[2:26:52] have to pamper you
[2:26:55] it has nothing to do with your image
[2:26:57] physically
[2:26:59] it's what God is doing in your life
[2:27:03] that you are ready
[2:27:05] just for the love of God you are ready
[2:27:08] to do anything
[2:27:12] for the love of God
[2:27:14] people will laugh at you
[2:27:16] oh we know you better
[2:27:18] you used to be like this
[2:27:20] oh I am that normal I don't do that
[2:27:22] anymore but we used to drink with you by
[2:27:25] the grace of God I don't drink anymore
[2:27:27] one step at a time we used to go to the
[2:27:30] club with you by the grace of God I
[2:27:33] don't go there anymore one step at a
[2:27:35] time and then they would laugh at you
[2:27:37] they make fun of you they call you names
[2:27:39] oh you are wearing this you are doing
[2:27:42] this you look like Grandpa you look like
[2:27:44] Grandma praise be to God one day at a
[2:27:48] time
[2:27:49] one day at a time
[2:27:51] and they look at you and they Wonder
[2:27:54] what is driving
[2:27:57] you what is it that is keep pushing you
[2:28:05] he is the author
[2:28:07] and the finisher of our faith
[2:28:12] we are in his hands
[2:28:16] we are Overcomers
[2:28:19] we are we are bound to overcome
[2:28:23] the spirit of this age
[2:28:26] can never hold us back
[2:28:29] there is nothing in this life
[2:28:33] there is nothing
[2:28:36] by the grace of God
[2:28:38] that can hold us back
[2:28:40] we are Overcomers
[2:28:46] God forbid
[2:28:48] that you don't make it God forbid
[2:28:52] but if you don't
[2:28:56] your problem is not with God
[2:28:59] that problem is you
[2:29:05] everything we need to overcome
[2:29:07] God has given it to us
[2:29:10] it is not an easy Road
[2:29:13] it is not don't let anybody deceive you
[2:29:16] it's not an easy Road
[2:29:19] but we have enough Grace
[2:29:23] to be able to walk in this path
[2:29:27] and do that which God wants us to do
[2:29:31] it is not our strength
[2:29:33] we don't even have to begin with
[2:29:38] it is not our righteousness
[2:29:41] because we don't even have it to begin
[2:29:43] with
[2:29:45] it is not what you can do
[2:29:48] because there is nothing you can do
[2:29:55] just come
[2:29:57] by God's ordained way
[2:30:00] there is a way God has ordained unto
[2:30:03] life
[2:30:07] whatever condition you find yourself in
[2:30:11] if you can only remember who you are
[2:30:16] and what God has already done for you
[2:30:20] and what you are banking your hopes on
[2:30:25] praise be to God
[2:30:27] the rest will be history
[2:30:33] there is no failure in the kingdom of
[2:30:35] God
[2:30:39] I don't care how sick you can be
[2:30:42] I don't care how poor you can be
[2:30:45] I don't care how hungry you can be
[2:30:47] I don't care what it is that you go
[2:30:49] through
[2:30:51] if you are in the will of God
[2:30:54] praise be to God there is nothing that
[2:30:56] compares to it
[2:31:00] when he comes
[2:31:02] shall he find faith
[2:31:04] shall he find faith
[2:31:09] will he see
[2:31:11] flesh of his flesh
[2:31:13] born of his bone
[2:31:15] Spirit of his Spirit In You
[2:31:19] when God took aif
[2:31:23] Daddy from the side of Adam and produce
[2:31:25] if
[2:31:26] when Eve woke up from that sleep when
[2:31:28] Adam woke up from that sleep and looked
[2:31:31] at Eve
[2:31:33] he said this is woman
[2:31:36] because she was taken from me
[2:31:38] both of my boys are Flesh of My Flesh
[2:31:42] can Christ
[2:31:44] look at you
[2:31:46] and say the same
[2:31:49] you are the bride of Christ
[2:31:52] you are his wife
[2:31:55] like Eve was to Adam
[2:31:58] can he look at you
[2:32:01] and say you are Flesh of My Flesh
[2:32:04] born of my born
[2:32:07] Spirit of my spirit can he say that
[2:32:09] about you
[2:32:12] if he can't say that about you now it's
[2:32:15] not too late
[2:32:17] it is not too late
[2:32:21] you still have room
[2:32:25] to change whatever it is that needs to
[2:32:29] be changed
[2:32:32] it's not too late
[2:32:34] surely Find Faith the musicians can come
[2:32:36] over praise be to God
[2:32:40] shall he find faith
[2:32:43] when he comes
[2:32:55] shall he find faith when he comes
[2:33:04] pay with the word
[2:33:09] stay with the word of God
[2:33:16] the Bible says
[2:33:20] by the spirit give of life
[2:33:25] there is life in the word of God
[2:33:28] in the beginning it was the way the word
[2:33:31] was it God and the Word was God
[2:33:34] the word is nothing short of God
[2:33:40] okay with the word
[2:33:43] [Music]
[2:33:45] stay with the word
[2:33:48] like that animal I was talking of
[2:33:51] that when that animal gets a hold of a
[2:33:54] branch
[2:33:55] it has a very ugly name in my darling
[2:33:59] I don't want to call the name
[2:34:02] I don't call the name
[2:34:04] but I don't want anybody to try it
[2:34:08] let me lock your job
[2:34:12] it has a very ugly name
[2:34:14] they call it
[2:34:20] it's small it's not big
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:23] and when he takes a hold of a branch
[2:34:27] you will kill it it will never let go of
[2:34:30] the branch
[2:34:37] stay with the word of God
[2:34:41] and there is nothing that pleases God to
[2:34:45] see a son or a daughter staying with a
[2:34:48] word
[2:34:51] to obey is better than sacrifice
[2:34:56] obedience
[2:34:58] full obedience to the word of God is
[2:35:00] what brings God down
[2:35:06] but if you are half and half
[2:35:09] half and half
[2:35:12] what happens is that you have a form of
[2:35:14] godliness
[2:35:17] and you deny the power thereof and that
[2:35:20] is the spirit of the age
[2:35:23] that Luke was spirit
[2:35:26] that local spirits
[2:35:29] a little called you a little hot there
[2:35:31] mix it together
[2:35:33] you are not standing for God and you are
[2:35:35] not standing for the devil either you
[2:35:37] are just in between
[2:35:40] you have become an entity of the enemy
[2:35:45] you better be hot or you better be cold
[2:35:53] praise be together are
[2:35:55] I want us to live here this morning this
[2:35:58] afternoon
[2:36:01] one thing on our hearts
[2:36:05] that we
[2:36:07] are going to live by the faith
[2:36:10] that has been delivered unto us
[2:36:13] the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:36:16] the afraid that overcomes this world and
[2:36:19] the spirit of the age
[2:36:21] we are going to live by the faith
[2:36:24] that when he comes
[2:36:26] he would find faith
[2:36:29] on Earth
[2:36:32] remember he is coming for his own
[2:36:34] and I want us to go in prayer I want us
[2:36:37] to just pray
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:39] just come here and search it to his
[2:36:41] hands
[2:36:42] ask for more of his grace
[2:36:45] because there is nothing we can do
[2:36:47] without him
[2:36:49] and when our lives are not Measuring Up
[2:36:53] that the grace of God will be able to
[2:36:54] see us through
[2:36:58] Beyond coming to church and going home
[2:37:02] there is something
[2:37:05] if you are not seeing it
[2:37:08] by the grace of God it's not too late
[2:37:12] by the grace of God it's not too late
[2:37:15] there is hope for the living
[2:37:20] if you are not dead
[2:37:24] God can do anything
[2:37:28] there is hope for the living
[2:37:31] just look into your hearts
[2:37:33] and see where you stand with God
[2:37:36] I just want all of us to pray
[2:37:40] shall we talk to God
[2:37:44] our Lord and our Master Jesus
[2:37:49] thank you so much father for these
[2:37:51] broken pieces of words Lord
[2:37:56] wait thank you for these broken pieces
[2:37:58] of words
[2:38:01] and they will not mean anything father
[2:38:03] oh God
[2:38:04] except you breathe life oh God into them
[2:38:08] and father we pray this afternoon
[2:38:11] that you breathe life into your word oh
[2:38:14] God breathe life oh God into these
[2:38:17] broken pieces of West Lord as your sons
[2:38:20] and daughters father oh God
[2:38:23] take them in
[2:38:26] and let your word mean something to us
[2:38:30] let your word father mean something to
[2:38:33] us oh God
[2:38:34] now we shall never take the word of God
[2:38:36] for granted
[2:38:38] that we shall never take the word of God
[2:38:41] for granted
[2:38:43] help us father oh God
[2:38:45] to stay with your word
[2:38:48] for heaven and I shall pass away
[2:38:51] the only thing that will not pass away
[2:38:53] is your word Lord
[2:38:55] and we want to stay with your word
[2:38:58] not with the letter father
[2:39:00] because the Bible says the letter
[2:39:02] killeth May the spirit give of life
[2:39:06] father give us life Lord
[2:39:09] father we pray let your word oh God take
[2:39:12] his place
[2:39:13] in our lives
[2:39:15] to keep us from evil to keep us from
[2:39:18] sinning
[2:39:23] let your word father
[2:39:26] abide with us father never to depart
[2:39:28] Lord
[2:39:29] and father we pray oh God that you would
[2:39:33] help us and I'll walk with you
[2:39:36] because we do reckon
[2:39:39] that it is not an easy road we are
[2:39:41] working on
[2:39:43] but we are more than Overcomers
[2:39:47] because everything we need to overcome
[2:39:50] you have given it to us Lord
[2:39:53] help us Lord Jesus
[2:39:56] never to get to a place in this life to
[2:39:59] turn our backs on you Lord
[2:40:01] because it is not worth it
[2:40:04] there is nothing without passion in the
[2:40:07] life in the world we are living in Lord
[2:40:09] accepts you
[2:40:12] may you be with us
[2:40:14] in every step along the way may you be
[2:40:17] with us
[2:40:18] in our Uprising and in our down sitting
[2:40:21] may you be with us
[2:40:23] father may you be with us
[2:40:26] in good times and in bad times may you
[2:40:28] be with us father
[2:40:30] take a hold of our lives in West we
[2:40:32] never dreamed possible and we pray the
[2:40:35] dear Lord Jesus that you would anoint
[2:40:38] ourselves Lord
[2:40:39] anoint us father with your Holy Spirit
[2:40:42] Lord
[2:40:43] and may you give us that inner strength
[2:40:46] we need
[2:40:48] to overcome
[2:40:51] in every aspect of Our Lives
[2:40:54] the Bible says obedience is better than
[2:40:57] sacrifice
[2:40:58] help us father
[2:41:00] not to be disobedient children
[2:41:03] but obey the word of God at all times
[2:41:07] not when it seems convenient
[2:41:10] in the most inconvenient times Lord
[2:41:13] that we shall stay with your word
[2:41:15] because it is the right to do as
[2:41:17] children of the most high God
[2:41:19] God
[2:41:21] father bring us onto an expected end
