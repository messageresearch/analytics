pray that tonight in the name of Jesus thank you Father and praise Beauty and the holy name for having head and answered our prayers oh God in Jesus name amen praise the Lord shall we be seated God bless you musicians you are all warmly welcome to the house of God tonight but a one sent me a text um and uh he told me he was traveling shortly before coming to church he called and he and I spoke he has a brother who is not doing very well at all he has a kidney problem so uh he's gone there with his brother Reverend reads to go and uh you know um just be a support to the family so um we are going to remember them in our prayers and uh remember Denise in the house and in the family um because we are serving a living God praise be to God yes [Music] um yeah I I was just sitting in the office and I was just praying that the time shooting come the time shouldn't come and that time just came too fast praise the Lord yeah um praise the Lord I believe you all know what a hawk is it's another version of um an eagle a lesser version of an ego um in in Ghana uh you don't see Eagles I have never seen an eagle in Ghana but I have all I had always seen um Hawks they were very very common and they will just come in the yard and then just come and pick a chicken and then they are gone and there was this mother hen I don't know how many chickens the mother hen had but the hawk would come and just pick one the Hulk will come I don't know what it was the same hook but it will come every day and pick one it looked like the mother got to a point and said to herself enough is enough and one way or the other we have to sort it out and on this fateful day here comes the hawk again and as the hawk was coming down normally the mother have the all the chickens everyone will be running for the ideal life but on this day the motherhand just jumped and met the hawk in the air and packed it right here and the hawk fell down wanted to fly it was just struggling he couldn't fly then the mother went came over it again and started beating it beat it till the hawk couldn't help itself and the hawk was lying down so a man came by took the hawk and plugged his Fighters off and then cut his toenails and they went and put it in a hand coop you needed to see what the hands in the group did to that Hawk they beat it and beat it and beat it mercilessly this it was so bloody that is what we should be doing to the devil if the devil has been on your case too much and the devil is not giving you room to rest and it's like the devil cannot just leave you alone just tell yourself that enough is enough meet the devil on his grounds praise be to God and I see the Lord Jesus just coming by and plucking his Fighters off and cutting those in those Hills I believe you are just going to beat beat itself praise the Lord yes the devil is on everybody's case don't think you are alone and a lot of the times we give him just too much room don't give the devil room it's like a small child we have all been children before and some are still children growing up that you go to school and if somebody picks on you and they are able to get away with it you become their easy target children I'm not saying when you go to school and somebody misbehaves issued issued it should misbehave with them I'm not saying that I'm just trying to paint a picture praise the Lord you become their easy pick that they can bring their nurses to you at any time because they know they'll get away with it but when they come with a blow and they get too in return next time they give you your space once again I know some of you I know somebody here who likes to just I'm not saying you should go and do it praise the Lord because if they ever bring your complaint will sort it out praise the Lord yes so a lot of the times we give the devil just too much room no Who You Are you are that you are a child of God that you are untouchable you are untouchable that when you speak Heaven yes because the Bible says what we call he hears us and while we yet speak we don't even finish speaking praise the Lord shall we just stand for the reading of the word Matthew 16 19. Matthew 16 19. I read and I will give unto thee the kiss of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven praise the Lord John 1 12. John 1 12. but as many as have received him to them give him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name shall we pray our Lord and our Master Jesus we have come here to encourage ourselves once again oh God and we're praying that you will come in our midst take the words that are spoken from behind this puppy tonight I anoint them into every single soul present that as many of us that have come would never return home the same because the Bible says your word would not go out and return unto devoid whatever purpose we have father for Gathering here tonight which is to worship and to hear from you we pray father that he will honor it tonight by coming into our midst tonight and break unto us the bread of life I spoke to your seven brother one a short while ago before coming to church and father he has traveled with his brother to go and visit a sick brother this brother that is sick has a complication with his kidney father you are still in the healing business because the Bible says you are wounded for our transgressions and you were bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon you and by your stripes we are healed we are coming by the way of the word tonight there is no man that can heal but we have a God who heals and we are coming father oh God by the way of your way tonight and we are claiming healing for this sick relative tonight we are standing in the god father oh God and we pray father be merciful upon Him Father be merciful upon his soul forgiving father of every wrong he has done and we pray father pleading the blood upon him tonight that you will deliver him completely from this kidney complication father for thy name's sake in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus father we pray with Thanksgiving amen shall we be seated there is a saying that half a loaf of bread is better than none have a loaf of bread is better than none my question has always been if you are worth a full loaf of bread why would you settle for half if the whole bread is yours why would you settle for half now you would realize that it is just a ploy of the devil to deprive you of your blessings and your inheritance that you being a child of God knowing what the grace of God has done for you and how far the grace of God can lead you and what God can do in your life that you settle for the minor minor minor things the small small small small things and you are happy with it to be called a Christian and you think that is okay it is not okay the Bible says unto whom much is given much shall be required if you write a full loaf why would you settle for half and that is just the sad story of a lot of Christians today that you are happy that the devil can meet you and tell you this is your limits and are you a child of God you accept it as your limit by the way tonight we are going to talk about the authority of the church praise be to God the authority of the church so don't let the devil tell you that this is how far you can go with Christ that you can do this but you are not good for that at what point does it stop it must come to a stop at what point now I can think of when the midianites while disturbing the trend of Israel year in year out till the Church of Israel but so impoverished and they didn't even have food to eat and then they cried out to God and God had their cry and raised up a Gideon and nobody that when God even called him Gideon you're a matter of valuer Gideon thought God was talking to some other Gideon he didn't even know God was talking to him God raised him from nowhere when the devil is too much on your case don't just sit down and think it is okay and accept it cry out to God and God hears your cry and why you think that would never be helped it will shock you what God would do and we know the story how God Rest Gideon Gave Over 30 000 soldiers and God told Gideon this is just too many you are going with too many people I don't want you to go to war with this plenty soldiers and then you go and then you win the war and then you think that oh it was your strength I want you to see the glory of God so you know what reduce the number that of 20 and 2000 aside and still God was not yet satisfied and we know how he brought them to the water he made them to drink and God still dreamed down the number to 300 it's a Gideon take this 300 and go and then he took this man and they went and they slew the midianites from every single corner praise the Lord and a lot of the times we forget that there is a God behind the scenes who is working on our behalf and bringing this into reality and when we see those blessings we begin to think that it is our strength your strength couldn't even carry you to work to go and do eight hours and come back and we look at the blessings God has bestowed upon us we look at [Music] count count those blessings and we attribute them to our strength we attribute them to our education we attribute them to the good jobs we have and we begin to think that it is us and when God is not even in the picture foreign God appointed him King and he was very successful very revered and very feared one day when he stood on his on a palace and he looked round he started to knock his chest see what I have done started to praise himself instead of praising God how often do we praise the blessings in our lives instead of placing the one who has blessed us and God said I am going to teach you a lesson tonight and that matter was so much respected so much revered and feared his habitation was with the animals in the bush he lived in the bush with animals and they were competing for the grass every morning the animals did not even have respect for him they didn't know that once once upon a time he was a king right he lost all his power a lot of the times we fall short rather we stop short from seeing God behind the scenes we look at the physical and then we try to take the glory for it forgetting that there is a God behind the scenes who is waking and bringing things to pass in our lives that should not be our story praise be to God tonight as I said we will be going all over the place I'm not sure yet but we are going to look at the authority of the church that God has given his church power and authority age is his church a people that God has chosen and people that have separated themselves and people that have dedicated themselves to God and people that have been taken away from their customs and traditions from superstition a people that have given themselves to God puts his power in authority in his church they may not be rich they may not have food to eat they may not have close to where they may not have jobs to do they may never be known from the day they were born till they leave this earth but one thing is sure that they have the power and the authority of God even though nobody knows them but wherever they are Heaven Knows that they are there because they represent God they have the power and the authority of God and that is the church of the Living God it has always been praise be to God when God delivered the children of Israel from Egypt in the wilderness they were the Church of God and they had the power and the authority of God praise be to God that when the children of that when the Egyptians came after them and they wanted to come and then take them back to go and worship them because pharaoh and his people thought no they did the wrong thing and the children of Israel started crying to Moses you have taken us away from Egypt come and die in the wilderness and what have you and then Moses was crying out to God what did God tell Moses why are you crying out to me oh the power and the authority you need for this journey I have given it to you God was not expecting Moses to cry out to him he was just expecting Moses to act to speak praise be to God why because they had the power and the authority of God that by day they saw the angel of the Covenant in the pillar of cloud and by night in the pillar of fire and they knew that God was with them sometimes situations come and you know God is with you we are not children of God by accident we are children of God by Design circumstances would come and go by the Lord your God would always abide praise the Lord and sometimes we tend to forget we tend to forget we have come a long way in this journey and there are a lot of things God has done for us and you can look at your life and you look at the circumstances and you can tell yourself that if God did it yesterday he will do it again maybe sometimes he didn't do it in your life but you can look around and you can see he did it in this sister's life he did it in this brother's life if he did it for them he would do it for me but a lot of the times we forget that we have a living God who is interested in our lives more than we even show interest Moses why are you crying out to me why are you crying out to me that you got to a place God is expecting you to act God is looking forward to you to take an action and that you are looking to God the power and the authority of God in his church and we know how the story ended praise be to God while Jesus walked this at surface you would realize that having the power and the authority of God in your life as an individual as a church as a family it's just not a mind game it is it is is so real very very real that the Lord Jesus when he was baptized by John the Baptist and the Holy Ghost came down into him then he started his ministry preaching the word of God Healing The Sick performing all diverse form of Miracles opening blind eyes healing leprosy just doing good works now the Lord Jesus says that whatever he did was the father doing it he made it very clear that except he sees the father doing it he doesn't do it the father in him doing the works so having the power and the authority of God is not you it has nothing to do with your muscles it has nothing to do with your physical attributes it doesn't matter how weak you are physically it doesn't matter how strong you are physically it doesn't matter in any way it is your relationship with God because it is not you doing the works but it is God in you doing the works the devil doesn't fear you I don't want to go ahead of myself but we'll be getting there very soon it's a very short um prayer meeting tonight hopefully by nine ten nine fifteen we should be out of here praise the Lord so you need to have a relationship with God you need to surrender to surrender completely to God and let God have his way it's not what you want it's what God wants it's not what you want to do it's what God wants to use you for you surrender to God and let God have his way oh that the father was he poured it into Christ and the Bible says oh that Christ is he poured it in the church and the church is not the building the church is you and me oh the Christ is he poured it in the church all the power and the authority he had rest with you and me it's one thing Soldier you go to the wall front and you'll have your AK-47 fully loaded and you have the enemy before you come in with a machete and then you decide oh um whether to use it or not and then they come and take you over with a machete it's a choice but you are fully armed with one of the most sophisticated arms that the enemy can never get close so for you to allow the enemy to come to your territory it's a choice you have made we have been given power and authority as a church as to whether or not we use it it's another thing yeah now you sit down in any filthy demon can just come and be hovering around you and then you see that when you are crying you put your hands on your head hey you are called upon the name of God instead of just speaking and acting on the word of God and taking Authority as a child of God the inner filthy demon and a witchcraft spirit can just come and toy with you and you don't know what you are worth you don't know what you can do as a child of God and then you just sit down and then you keep crying oh that Christ is he has poured it into the church and the Lord Jesus said at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you praise be to God again it is not you doing the works there is nothing you can do we are worthless without him but in him we can do all things because he is our strength praise be to God the authority of the church is Christ in his church among his bride and when you take Christ out of the church you are just left with an organization the authority of the church is Christ take him out of the church and you have no church anymore how we ought to cherish some of these things that it is not about you it is not about you God has promised that you have a people for his name's sake so it doesn't matter how corrupt this world is it doesn't matter how polluted it's going to be it doesn't matter how fit it's going to be God is going to have a people for his namesake it is not about you the most difficult thing for us is sometimes just knowing how to surrender what to say enough is enough and they mean business with God and we always want to be in the picture it is God oh it's not the authority of God is in his church we as a church have the authority to do anything anything so long as it is not against the word of God if it is not against the word of God anything we want as a church we can put our foot down if we know what we have before the children of Israel left Egypt Pharaoh told Moses you guys can go but you know what just leave your animals and everything mother said no we are carrying everything we need everything we are not living anything we as a church can take a stand that we are not leaving anybody behind we are not living anybody behind Barbara says we can claim our children for the kingdom of God you can take a stand he doesn't take the whole congregation you as an individual can take a stand for God all God needs is just one person praise be to God that you come to the place and you are ready for business and when you mean business with God God means business with you you as an individual praise be to God we can read the Church of sin we can read the church of any disease of any sickness because they are demons we can if we get to know who we are and where we stand if we know the authority we have as children of God the devil has no place the day you get to know your Authority as a child of God the devil has no place in your life he will just come and hover around and then once in a while he will try to scare you to see if you jump back stay your ground the worst that can happen is a blessing right because he said do not fear he that would kill you and has no power over your soul to cast it into hell but fear he that can kill you and put your soul in hell so the West that can ever happen to you is to get out of this physical body that's the worst praise be to God and if you are locked him with God if you are locked in with God and your soul is at peace with God what do you fear I don't care what a death comes today or tomorrow I don't care about it I don't care today people fear death more than the fear sin it has to be the other way around death never sends you to hell it is sin that sets you to hell We Fear the things we shouldn't fear when you see sin coming run for your dear life the Bible says that flee from every appearance of evil flee flame is flee it doesn't mean just take your time and what can be smiling no slay means flee run for your dear life death just takes you from one dimension into another dimension it doesn't take you to hell if your life is right with God it doesn't matter when death knocks on your door you are going with your chest out praise be to God because you know whom you have believed you know whom you have entrusted your life to you oh life is saved praise be to God if Christ carries all of us are going to go in the way of the flesh so it doesn't matter whether I live hundred years or Thousand Years oh I live 50 years it doesn't make any difference what makes the difference is what did you do with your life what did you do with your life praise the Lord how did we end up here so we as a church has that Authority vested in US vested in US wherever you find yourself tell yourself that I am a child of God you alone you can change the environment you can change the circumstances you can change the atmosphere and it is not you doing it is the god in you that is doing it but you might guess it you must get to that place to know that you're a child of God with authority don't give the devil any chance the devil is not to repeat it we ought to treat the devil like that Hawk in the hand coop that is how you should treat the devil treat him like that Hawk in the Handcuff he doesn't need any respect the devil can never do anything to you if anything ever happens to you know that it is God whether good or bad never attributed to the devil it is God your life is in the hands of God not in the hands of the devil the devil has no control over your life [Music] your life is in God your life is hidden Christ how is the devil ever going to get in there he must first repent imagine Lord Jesus Christ must live a Sanctified life and get the Holy Ghost then he has become a brother praise the Lord we have enough Authority and um oh I was thinking praise be to God yes we make goodness of the time says that when everybody is sick let them call upon the Elders of the church and if they have committed innocence and with the prayer their sins will be forgiving them and they shall be healed what is it it is talking about the authority that is in the church and Christ is that Authority that when somebody is sick let him set for the illness of the church their God the anointing they'll pray for him he is going to receive his healing no man heals no no man is God who does the healing The Authority that God has given to his church the church has been given power and authority to change any circumstance praise be to God um you know I was thinking about it the Bible says if a man commits sin and then you're a brother or sister you see it the Bible says go talk to that person if I Repent praise be to God if they don't get another person go as a witness if they repent fine if they don't let it come to the church the fellow is brought to the church and the fellow is giving time to repent if he doesn't the Bible gives the church the power and the authority to commit that person to the devil and they may go and go forever and if they are children of God brother makes us to understand that God can whip them back into shape now if there is a person like that in the church what happens is that they are enjoying the protection of the church they are enjoying the protection of the church until the church takes a stand and then they use their power and authority to cast that one out to the devil God will not do anything God is expecting the church to take that stand but if the church chooses not to God will be looking at but one thing is that one person's misbehavior can affect the whole church so now the fellow has become like a cancerous cancerous uh is it gem in the church in the body of Christ when you see a lion praying an animal when you see the animals coming in a group it doesn't just go in front no it will just hide and normally it goes for the animal that is just last the one that is just behind that is just on its own walking by itself but so long as it is in the crowd it is very difficult for the animal to go for it you don't know the protection you are enjoying as a child of God being in the Church of God you don't know the protection you have no idea whatever you are struggling with whatever you are dealing with in your life never stay away from church don't hide it either if it is something that must be made known make it known expose the devil it is not you expose the devil and we'll cast him out by the grace of God because the church has the power and authority to do that whatever you are dealing with whatever you are struggling with come to church if you have to drag your feet to come drag your feet and come if the devil can get you to stay away from church you make the devil very happy then it is very very easy for the devil to just take you out completely but when you are coming and going with all those difficulties something is happening something is getting bound something is getting loose you don't get to realize it but you got to a point in your journey and then you start to ask where did they go and when was it that you don't even know when they left praise be to God Hallelujah the authority of the church so the children of God act on the authority of God the devil gives his power to anything to animals to trees to feel to anything but God gives his power to a disciplined people disciplined people God will not just take you off the street and put his power in you you ought to have a relationship with God you ought to have a walk with God God would have to work on you give you the character of God the personality of God the image of God and then God gives you that power and authority and when you have it you know how to use it praise be to God but I've said in the message who is God Joshua stop the son is it true all things are possible with God nothing impossible but all things are possible to you also nothing impossible to damn that belief all things are possible breath right down and made you if you just know who God was well I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their Authority I'm afraid that Holy Ghost born man doesn't realize their Authority all the authority that God has permitted to the church I will give you I will give unto thee the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on Earth will be born in heaven whatever you lose will be loosed I give you power over serpents and of all kinds of diseases oh everything and nothing shall harm you exercise faith let loose let God have his way God will grant it to you praise be to God like we are just trying to say that the child doesn't know the authority it has it's just like a car that is sitting in the garage and then um I don't know let me see let's see let's for example a hundred horsepower car is there anything like that by the way [Music] now if there is a car in the garage hundred hundred horsepower the car will sit in the garage and get rotten and never experience that power for the car to experience is power it must come on the highway and then you step on the accelerator and then you see the car fly then you know that yes the car indeed has power so we have power we have power God has given us power and authority but we are like sometimes we are like the car in the garage with all the horsepower and we just sit down and do nothing about it and then very soon it's time for us to leave this earth and then we go with all that we ought to live Footprints behind oh the time is just running too fast I didn't know I had this much material praise be to God yes okay let me just read something oh no I would I would have to get somewhere praise be to God what is it in the message expectation 1954 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever made the lamb to work the plan to see the death to hear Devils would Devils would be cast out and the commission follows on Amen and that thing is perhaps being done around the world tonight among faithful believing members of the body of Christ and Divine Healing doesn't lay within you and each of these brothers sitting here your pastors you don't have to wait till they have a Divine Healing program to be healed every one of these men has got just the same Authority that I have brother where I'm speaking or anyone else has got to pray for the sick and that's all we can do is pray for the sick and not only them but if they are off somewhere and can't get to you that Holy Ghost Field sister or brother that lives next door to you has the same Authority praise be to God now if there is a better assistant next to you that isn't a problem or is sick and it's not doing well you can go all hands together and you will pray as you come true praise be to God you have the same power in authority that's right if you can't get to your pastor the Bible said if any if if if if any among you is sick call the Elders of the church let them anoint him with oil and pray over the sick the prayer of faith shall save the sick God shall raise them up not the minister God shall raise them up and if they did anything it shall be forgiven them confess your faults one to another and pray for the and pray for the other is that right one another to be prayed for the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous much that's all you need be filled with the Holy Spirit hey you might be surprised if you only know the gift that's sitting right in the building tonight there is a huge gifts that is sitting in the church tonight a huge gift sitting in the church tonight that we are not seeing it but if God would open our eyes to it to see what we have and what we can do with the power and the authority invested in US I don't think we would want to rest what's going on here prayer what's going on there let your attention be here praise the Lord [Music] I just want to jump over a few things here because it's almost nine o'clock in the message Witnesses 1950 Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform miracles but he does he but he does it through his church his people they shall lay hands their hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out the evil spirits praise the Lord is that right the commission is given to the church and we are the Church of the Living God the commission is given to us in his name which Allah and the sex shall receive their healing and we shall cast out evil spirits praise be to God he doesn't know the commission is given to the church that's what that's what's the matter with the church today he doesn't know his position if you not positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be any feeble person in here in the next five minutes um praise be to God there is a lot we can do then we are already doing there is a lot God has entrusted in our care than we even know God has great expectation for you and me it's not just to come into this life and be another person God has us here for a purpose he has us here for a reason and God is going to bring us onto an expected end for his namesake in the next five minutes that's right that thing of it is you are looking up into the millennium for something to happen one is already here now we are the sons of God not will be we are right now when this night right now this minute we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh if you would only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you have desire of need of or letting you have to do is to ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and it will be given unto you and that's true whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you have received it and you shall have it we get to the place where God is looking up to us and we are waiting for him like Moses before the Red Sea praise be to God like we just talked about it a while ago you go to a place in your life God is looking at you to do something and then you are looking forward to God is looking for you to say something and you are waiting for God to come down and say it God is waiting for you to take a step of faith and you are waiting for God to do it it doesn't work that way praise be to God you can't have Authority without power praise be to God so be careful you are going in the authority of the Holy Spirit always be careful that you are going in the power and the authority of the Holy Spirit not in your personal ability because that is going to fail and you can never have authority without having power like the seven sons of skeva the South Pole demonstrating the power of God casting out demons Healing The Sick and the Bible says they went to a man that was demon-possessed seven of them to go and cast out that demon and when they went they said we are daddy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in whom Paul preaches and who is he to you who is the Lord Jesus Christ to you in the name of the Lord Jesus in whom Paul preaches Who Is He To You and that demon answered them and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you who are you it's sad that demons even recognize your power and authority than you do when the devil's doubles you a daughter of God when they see you they know they have seen a son of God and sometimes they wonder and they Marvel at your action and reaction to some of the situations that come your way because they know the authority you have Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and the demon in that man beat them the Bible says they run out naked and they were abused bloody probably when they were going in maybe they went in according to the order of seniority maybe I'm the oldest let me go in first but what a demon turn on them praise the Lord I don't know how big the door was but I see seven people coming to the door from the oldest to the youngest there was no protocol no I'm the oldest let me stand you young ones go out first no it doesn't work that way praise the Lord so no in whose authority you are going no where you stand you can't just get off and then you wonder in the world and then you just want to use the authority you don't have back home where we come from it doesn't happen here in the U.S now a police officer just comes by the road and then you see a driver that is feeding high speed and the police in his uniform just comes and he starts on the road and he does this he doesn't even look in the direction of the car because he knows that you can't hit him I don't care how fast you are driving they will just hit their brain because the police is on the way they recognize his authority you a civilian go and stand there and do that they are going to bury you so no what power you have no what Authority you have no in whose power and authority you are going it is not about you it is not about you it has never been and it will never be all that Christ is he has poured it into the church and I want us to live here tonight knowing that we are children of God without power and the authority of God in our lives and that we can change anything around our lives which we don't want we combined we can cast out we can turn loose anything not some of the things everything we have the power as a child to do it Christ is the power and the authority in the Church of God thank you so God wants you to have an ex a personal experience with him God does not want you to approach him based on somebody else's experience God wants to have a one-on-one with you one-on-one with you he wants you to have that personal relationship with him and he wants to give you an experience only he can give God has no grandchildren we are all children of God the experience that one person has another person has God wants to give you that same experience he wants to bring you to that place why you will never doubt who God is why you will never doubt the power and the authority of God that you know Who You Are You Know Who You Are it doesn't matter what anybody says You Know Who You Are it doesn't matter what happens you know why you stand the Earth beneath you can cave in it will not change your faith it will never change your faith Godwin does this when something good happens oh God loves me well something bad happens so God doesn't love me when we get what you want oh God is good when we get the button oh no ah I'm not sure if I'm a Child of God but you get to a place in your life and that doesn't matter anymore God wants to bring every child of his to that point that you don't look at the circumstance around your life to determine the relationship that God has with you God wants us to speak and speak like sons and daughters not with fear not without just speak like that little girl I once told a story here about in tema where there's the poor City in Ghana we had this national service Personnel who came to the north and they told the story and I have said this in a in in a number of places that a man just studied a movement in the house and a man knew when there was nobody in the house by that little girl and then he went into that house to take advantage of her and they gave us to I strike you with blindness in the name of Jesus and right there and then the man went blind it will start the following day it was not an hour later right there and that the man went blind God loves to hear us pray because the Bible says we should never cease praying we should pray with our season says that we can never pray enough so we are to pray we are to pray but you know what else God lost when you speak with authority as a child of God praise the Lord now God looks at and say yes that's my son yes that's my daughter speaking because whatever you say as a child of God Heaven backs it God loves to hear that God wants us to speak like Moses that when they saw the children when the Egyptians coming he said this is Jesus you see you shall see them no more with authority you don't have to explain it you don't have to explain it and we know the story those Egyptians nobody ever saw them anymore when Joshua was fighting a war and he needed time he's just stand and looked at the Sun he never read that from the textbooks he never saw anybody attempt that he just said son just stay where you are I need some little time to finish some work today praise be to God it was a Son of God speaking with authority and the son had to obey because the Son of God has spoken praise be to God God wants us to speak with authority not as a coward speak with your chest out like Elijah what he said as the Lord my God lives that will not be due nor Reign until I call for it praise God and I was not you and there was no rain now when when Moses one Elijah was cried out to God saying that they have killed all the prophets and it was him alone God told him he is not you alone there are seven thousand that have not bowed their needs to bow and I believe when the farmers struck the land and there was no rain and there was no deal and there was food shortage I believe that this children of God were praying and seeking the face of God and asking God to be merciful that when God look at his children God wanted to send rain but God didn't even send it he didn't because a Son of God had taken a stand and Son of God has spoken and God honored it God had to come down to Elijah Elijah I I want to send rain but he doesn't have to come from me go tell them praise the Lord God would not bypass the church and do anything God is dependent on you and me praise the Lord when you speak as a son of God why do you speak speak as a daughter of God with authority with authority anywhere you find yourself no that you are a child of God when the Lord Jesus murder man of gadara the demons in him just started oh have you come to to to finish us before our time they recognized his authority they recognize this Authority and depleted that they should be cast into the sea God enjoys seeing his children speak who sent the Elders of Israel to go and tell the Lord Jesus that his servant was sick and you should come and heal him and in the Oscars when he knew Jesus was around he said go tell him not to come under my roof because I am not worthy that he should come under my roof I am a man set in authority I said I tell this go and they go I tell his clam and they come so whatever he is he should just stay there he should just speak the word and the Lord Jesus marveled and he said he has not seen so great effort in Israel wherever there is faith it attracts the attention of God praise the Lord the authority of God the authority of God yes we can talk about um Peter Peter and John are they get called Beautiful when they got there and the man that was born I mean a crib from his father's womb sitting there begging for arms and then Peter Peter just looked at him he's a silver and God Havana but set as I have give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk rise up and walk as I said God lost it when you pray and God lost when you speak with authority I want us to live here tonight knowing Who We Are knowing the power and authority we have as children of God knowing what we can do as a Church of the Living God that there is nothing of the limits there is nothing of the table there is nothing too much that when we speak Heaven is going to back it up praise the Lord in the message Christianity versus idolatry here like uh say for instance here is the traffic coming down the street at Fourth and Broadway in Louisville zoom zoom zoom zoom just fast as they can 60 miles an hour across that street everybody rushing hustling and bustling one little man walks out works out there raises his hand and brother breaks slide well that little man hasn't got enough power to stop one one of those cars but he's got Authority Glory it and his power well if one of them cars would hit him he had demolished him but let him raise his hand why the drivers of the car recognize that uniform oh brother they recognize that uniform breaks slide why look at his authority look what's behind him the whole city the whole system of the city is behind him the law enforcement of the city is behind him that uniform represents that he's different yes because he's an officer he hollers stop well one of them cars go zoom and just take him like that but they better not try it look what's behind him there was quick breaks and slide he don't even have to say a thing just raise his hand that does it sure his authority comes from the law enforcement it's all behind him his self he's weak but what's behind him that's what starts his dressing he's all dressed up in the uniform that's what not not the idol but for the individual ought to be dressed let us put on the whole armor of God the helmet of salvation this great big show the size of a Door of Faith oh brother is not what he is but what he represents that's what the officer is that little man standing there he is just an ordinary man but what he represents our armor is Jesus Christ yes sir all devils slide their brakes when they see that when you see that full armor of God the true baptism of the Holy ghosts amen thus seated coming straight from the Throne of God dressed in the fullness dressed in the full armor of Resurrection not that you are strong you are nothing but what's behind you you are dead you joined the army you've joined the police force you are going to keep law in control of these devils that's right you are on the police force the heart is behind you see you are reckoned dead you are nothing you couldn't stop nothing but your Authority that's been given you because you are raised and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the devil recognizes that everything slides their bricks when your hand goes up so when the devil sees you they know there is trouble around don't let the devil see you and then get comfortable when the devil sees you let them get very uncomfortable that the Son of God is around where I come from when a soldier man goes to town and rocks attack him and they beat him up do you know what a man do all the men in that area they vacate their homes they'll go to the bush they never come back home until the soldier the soldiers come there and do a raid because when you beat a soldier the soldiers are coming back when you attack one soldier you have attacked all soldiers foreign because they know what the soldiers are capable of let it be said of you the same now when a demon comes around you don't touch that woman don't touch that man that is trouble let it be said of you don't let the Devils feel feel comfortable around you when they see you let them see trouble now I want to see you they will keep their distance praise the Lord 926 I'll be done in four minutes praise God now we all know that God is powerful he is powerful all power in heaven on an air belongs to him we know how he created the heavens and the Earth from nothing by his word so we know the power in the authority of God but now when it comes to humanity Christ is the expression of the furthest power and authority to humanity so my soul that even after his death [Music] saw my soul that even after his death and Ascension that did not change it because the Bible says that he is Seated on the right the right hand of God and the right hand of God is power and authority it didn't change that Seated on the right hand not on the right hand side it has nothing to do with Direction but on the right hand of God power and authority the father trusted him and he did not let him down praise be to God and not my will but your will be done he could have chosen not to die it was a choice he made he didn't let the father down where would you and I be if he had refused it why would we stand today he did not let the father down he said personality so he is now trusting in us to go everyone says that we are essential fit praise be to God and in the last commission to the church he said go into the world and preach the message the gospel to All Nations to All Creatures and whoever believes you baptized and whoever does not believe is Damned and in my name in my name not in our power in his name not in our Authority in his name we shall cast out devons Devils sicknesses in his name we shall traitors copiers in his name if we eat anything deadly it's not even harm us it's all about him praise be to God he is trusting in you and he is trusting in me to go and we don't have to let him down we have become his right hand we have become his right hand how else would he Express his power and the authority to the world it's through the church it's through the church he has invested the musicians can come it's 9 30. praise the Lord he has vested his power and authority in the church and we have become his right hand and he is trusting us to go and I don't want us to live here tonight thanking ourselves feeble yes in ourselves yes we are nothing without him without him we are completely nothing without Christ in a man's life that life is so hopeless and useless it doesn't matter how successful you are as I said the other day without Christ you are failure if you don't have God in your life you are just nothing but a miserable creature it's better to have God in your life have a relationship with God and not have food to eat than to sit on tables with Kings and dine with the politicians of this world not having Christ in your life no that all power in heaven has been invested in you [Music] if there is anything happening in your life and you don't like it you can speak to it and it will be we as a Church of the Living God can talk to God and God hears us wherever you find yourself oh that heaven is behind foreign that you are not alone you have never been alone before it even came to your reality the realization of who you truly are God has always been taking care of you it'll start when you gave your life to Christ the devil would have taken you off this F surface before you ever came to that point [Music] but God has been taking care of you all this while it's just in the last 5 10 15 20 30 years that you got to know that oh I am a child of God I'm a Child of God has vested his power and authority in my life that I can speak like Christ he spoke to the wind and the wind obey him peace be still and right there and then the wind just died out and all the power gave it to the church and we are the Church of the Living God then when you speak when you speak even nature hears you foreign God has not just left us 934 praise be to God I want us to go before the Lord in prayer tonight the Bible says his word will not go as a return unto him void the devil doesn't have to keep having his way why does it stop it doesn't have to be tomorrow it has to be right now right now that when you talk to God know that God has heard you and if you have to command the devil command the devil and the devil would flee but know where you stand with God know why you stand with God have a relationship with God just look at your life set your heart see where you stand and I want us to talk to God tonight for us to be able to exercise our power and our Authority as children of God we ought to take a stand for him we ought to take a stand with God just talk to God I don't know how the word of God came to you tonight but I trust that in one way or the other God may have spoken to you I believe that with all my heart and just approach the throne of God tonight that we shall not live here the way we came in and going forward our lives would never be the same that wherever we find ourselves we shall exercise our power and our authority over any situation that comes our way because we know that all that Christ is he has put it in the church and we are the Church of the Living God shall we pray our Lord and our savior Jesus we thank you so much oh God for how far you have brought us tonight oh God we are so grateful that your world has come tonight Lord Has Come to Us you have spoken you have spoken father you have spoken we have heard your word and we pray father give us Grace to apply your word in our lives it is just not enough to have knowledge for wisdom knowledge without wisdom does not benefit it takes the wisdom of God to rightly place the knowledge of God in our lives and father we pray for divine wisdom tonight that will be able to rightly place your word in our lives where it belongs that we may see the effect of your word in our lives oh God for we are not here tonight just to entertain ourselves we have come to hear from you Lord and your word has come to us tonight telling us that father all that the father is he poured it into Christ and all that Christ is he put it into the church and all the power and the authority you have you have invested in the church and we are the Church of the Living God with power and authority and father we pray oh God do not let us lose sight of who we are do not let us lose sight of what you have given the church Lord as the prophet of God said that if we know who we are and what we have there wouldn't be anyone's people in the next five minutes in our midst May the Holy Spirit keep us in constant remembrance of Who We Are and what we have as the Church of the Living God that we shall not give the devil room to come and squat why he doesn't belong that we shall tell the devil that enough is enough me the devil on his own crowns and overcome him because we have been given power to overcome the flesh to overcome sin and to overcome Satan when we live with these things it's a choice we have made but we pray father oh God that go forward from tonight that we shall realign ourselves with the word of the almighty God help us dear Lord Jesus for we need you Lord we need you in our lives if we are getting anywhere at all it will be what you have done it will depend on you not on us for there is nothing we can do may depend on you for you are the power and the

Victory Lord for it is Victory to know Who We Are and what we can do in the name of the Lord Jesus it is Victory do not let the enemy wrestle it out of our hands bless us father and keep us by your
