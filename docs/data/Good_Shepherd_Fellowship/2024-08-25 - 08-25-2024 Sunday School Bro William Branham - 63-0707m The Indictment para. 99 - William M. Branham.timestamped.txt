[7:54] God will never meet with man nowhere
[7:56] else but under the
[7:58] blood when you you turn the blood down
[8:01] then your meeting place with God has
[8:03] been taken away God made his first
[8:06] decision in the Garden of Eden that man
[8:09] would only worship him under the shed
[8:11] blood of the sacrifice and that's the
[8:14] only place that God met with man then
[8:16] and that's the only place that God ever
[8:18] did meet with man and that's the only
[8:19] place he meets with man today is under
[8:21] the shed blood of the sacrifice see I
[8:24] don't care if you're Methodist Baptist
[8:25] Presbyterian if you can forget your
[8:27] differences Roman catholic whatever you
[8:29] might be and will'll come under the shed
[8:32] blood God will meet with both of us
[8:34] there that's where we can all meet and
[8:36] fellowship on the same ground but
[8:38] otherwise he will not meet just because
[8:40] you're a Methodist he will not meet just
[8:42] because you're Pentecostals he'll meet
[8:44] with you under one condition that's
[8:45] under the shed blood when your sins has
[8:48] been confessed and expelled in his
[8:50] presence then by the blood and the blood
[8:52] is always before him and therefore he
[8:55] only can see you through that shed blood
[8:57] and you're white as snow
[8:59] when you've confessed your sins
[9:01] otherwise you're not there you cannot
[9:03] Fellowship that's the reason that you
[9:05] don't see things happening in the
[9:06] churches they confess that they believe
[9:08] the blood but they reject the very plan
[9:11] to get to the blood the word right
[9:15] there's only one way God will honor that
[9:16] word you'll never honor that word come
[9:19] and say I'm a Roman Catholic I demand
[9:21] this to be done you can't do it
[9:22] Methodist Baptist are Pentecostals you
[9:24] can't do it the only way you can do it
[9:26] is under the mercies of God through his
[9:28] grace is the come through the shed blood
[9:30] of Jesus Christ say Lord I claim the
[9:33] promise then if you really are under
[9:35] that blood God's obligated to that word
[9:39] hallelujah But first you got to be under
[9:41] that blood amen you see it now amen no
[9:45] wonder they can't believe in miracles no
[9:47] wonder you can't believe in the
[9:49] Supernatural no wonder they condemn it
[9:51] the same reason they condemned it back
[9:53] there is the same reason they condemn it
[9:54] today amen they're guilty as guilty can
[9:58] be because only under the shed blood and
[10:02] those who dare some little brother who
[10:05] dares under humility to take God at his
[10:07] word and walk out there and confess his
[10:10] sins and forget all these dogmas and
[10:11] things and stand there under the blood
[10:14] and believe it then they want to call
[10:17] him a
[10:18] fanatic they want to class him as we'
[10:21] say it it's not a good word to use at
[10:23] the pulpit but so that you'll understand
[10:25] he's a
[10:27] Oddball after all aren't we we all
[10:30] oddballs see the believer is an oddball
[10:32] to the unbeliever and the unbeliever is
[10:34] an oddball to the believer so who is the
[10:37] Oddball the farmer is an oddball to the
[10:40] businessman the businessman's an oddball
[10:42] to the farmer see so who is he anyhow I
[10:46] tell you salvation is an individual
[10:49] affair with man and God Alone one
[10:52] individual searching out our own
[10:54] salvation with fear and trembling I know
[10:58] no other basis as a teacher this morning
[11:01] or as a minister from Christ than to lay
[11:03] it down upon the
[11:05] word I cannot place it on anything else
[11:08] now we find there then that only under
[11:12] the blood that God met the worshippers
[11:14] so they met it Jerusalem and Christ is
[11:18] God's provided lamb of
[11:21] sacrifice and today there's only one
[11:24] place that God will meet man and that's
[11:26] under the blood of Jesus Christ anywhere
[11:30] else it is condemned God will never hear
[11:33] it you might do all kind of emotions and
[11:36] all kind of isms and shake and jump and
[11:38] have blood and fire and smoke and
[11:40] everything else but as long as that life
[11:42] isn't compared with the word and God
[11:45] thoroughly identifying that life then
[11:47] there's no need of trying it because
[11:49] you're out and God will never meet it
[11:51] till it comes under the care of that
[11:53] blood that's right so you see in the
[11:56] scripture we've got a Jerusalem the
[11:58] church has it's in heaven a Heavenly
[12:02] Jerusalem where God is God and today
[12:07] it's not under some Creed or something
[12:08] that we try to make it a Jerusalem we'd
[12:11] like the Methodist like to like to make
[12:13] the the Methodist headquarters of
[12:16] Jerusalem the Catholic like to make Rome
[12:17] and and the different places where we
[12:19] have our headquarters we like to make
[12:20] that a Jerusalem but the Bible says that
[12:23] our Jerusalem is from above which is
[12:25] mother of all the Believers now and
[12:29] Christ is God's provided lamb notice how
[12:32] appropriate it was now showing it that
[12:34] Jerusalem had was
[12:36] ceasing when it was in
[12:41] effect until that
[12:45] hour the blood of the Lamb was all right
[12:48] until that
[12:50] day but now at the crucifixion it
[12:55] changes the old system is done amen
[12:59] there was a new one and the the lamb was
[13:02] at the
[13:04] sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb
[13:07] was on the
[13:09] grounds they were condemning and doing
[13:11] the very thing there that they had to
[13:14] do it's
[13:16] right God be blessed for seeing this
[13:21] wonderful Heavenly light in this last
[13:23] day because the churches is doing the
[13:25] same thing
[13:28] today till the hour that organization
[13:30] religion is condemned and proved to be
[13:33] sacrificing Christ's
[13:36] word from that on comes the word and the
[13:40] word only from the old Pascal lamb
[13:42] passed away and Christ become our lamb
[13:45] at the day of the crucifixion and the
[13:48] day that the
[13:50] denomination crucified the word of God
[13:53] and accepted a Creed in the Ste of the
[13:55] word that's the day the word come into
[13:58] full effect amen
[14:00] am that's just been
[14:02] recently notice secondly first there
[14:08] Jerusalem secondly they they who the
[14:12] Jews the
[14:14] worshippers think of it the worshippers
[14:18] themselves was killing the very one they
[14:20] they claimed to be
[14:23] worshiping could you imagine such a
[14:26] thing as intelligent man that were
[14:30] priest that were trained that had
[14:34] doctor's degree till it probably there
[14:37] they had to come out of a certain
[14:39] generation before or or tribe before
[14:41] they could even be a priest they had to
[14:43] be Levites their fathers as priest their
[14:46] grandfathers as priest their great great
[14:48] great great great grandfathers as
[14:49] priest and they had to live such a
[14:52] consecrated
[14:53] life but one iot against them they'd be
[14:56] stoned no mercy was granted
[15:00] holy certainly
[15:03] but self-made
[15:07] Holiness had to act like that to show
[15:09] their face for their Church inside of
[15:12] them Jesus said you're full of Dead
[15:13] Man's
[15:14] [Music]
[15:17] Bones how I could bring an indictment
[15:20] right
[15:21] there man who know that to be the truth
[15:24] this word to be the truth and will
[15:26] compromise on it to show a face before
[15:28] some organization
[15:31] I have a right to indict him right on
[15:35] God's
[15:36] word notice they the
[15:40] worshippers the man who had looked for
[15:43] the
[15:44] promise a man who had looked for it to
[15:47] years and ages and with nothing to do
[15:49] but in that constant
[15:52] Seminary but they had divided the word
[15:55] according to the teaching of the
[15:57] Seminary and they had missed the very
[15:59] truth of
[16:01] it
[16:03] they the priest the ministry of that
[16:09] day there at their headquarters they the
[16:14] ministry of that day was killing the
[16:17] very God the very
[16:20] land the very one that they claim they
[16:24] were worshiping they were killing and
[16:27] today I indict this bunch of ordained
[16:31] ministers in their Creeds and
[16:33] denominations they're crucifying to the
[16:35] people the very God that they claim that
[16:38] they love and
[16:45] serve I indict these
[16:49] ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:53] upon their
[16:54] doctrine that claim that the days of
[16:57] Miracles is passed and the water baptism
[17:00] in the name of Jesus Christ is not
[17:01] sufficient and not right upon any of
[17:04] these words that they have substituted
[17:07] Creeds far I indict them as guilty in
[17:10] the blood of Jesus Christ upon their
[17:13] hands are crucifying AR fresh the Lord
[17:16] Jesus a second
[17:18] time they are crucifying Christ to the
[17:25] public taking from them the things that
[17:27] they're supposed to be given to them and
[17:29] they substituted something else in his
[17:32] place a church stre for
[17:35] popularity there
[17:38] they they the ones who ought to know
[17:41] better if anybody should have know
[17:43] better it should have been their
[17:45] ministers if anybody should know better
[17:47] it should be the clergy of this day if
[17:51] anybody ought to know the the the
[17:53] Bishops archbishops and and ministers
[17:56] and doctors of divinity are to not
[18:00] different but why can't
[18:04] they what a
[18:07] contradiction what have we got before sh
[18:10] but a a
[18:11] contradiction they claim that they
[18:13] worship God and they're killing the
[18:15] Prince of
[18:18] Life they there are they crucified him
[18:22] and here they again do the same thing
[18:26] for he is the word that's what it is
[18:29] only a reflection of the word and that's
[18:32] what he is today a reflection of the
[18:35] word trying to find somebody to reflect
[18:38] himself
[18:39] through and these people
[18:42] keep the congregation away from
[18:47] God and and if there anything happens
[18:50] and it's spoke of in the congregation
[18:52] they condemn it from the platform from
[18:54] the pulpit and say it's fanaticism stay
[18:57] away from it
[18:59] and doing so they crucified Jesus Christ
[19:02] in
[19:04] 1963 and are just as guilty as those
[19:06] guys at the at that day it's an awful
[19:10] statement but it's the
[19:12] truth long that's exactly what they do
[19:16] today and upon this grounds upon the
[19:19] grounds of crucifying Christ upon the
[19:22] grounds of taking the word and taking it
[19:25] away from the people is exactly what
[19:26] they were doing there the very word that
[19:29] God was reflecting through his own son
[19:31] to prove it was and the one that they
[19:32] claimed that they love the Jehovah that
[19:34] had manifested himself by the scriptures
[19:37] done exactly what he said he would do
[19:40] exactly what God said he would do and
[19:42] reflected it before because the love of
[19:44] their Church groups and things like that
[19:47] they condemn the Prince of
[19:51] Life and I condemn the same group today
[19:56] and indict them as guilty before the God
[19:59] by the word of God that they're doing
[20:01] the same
[20:04] thing this generation is
[20:07] indied remember Hebrews 13:8 he's the
[20:10] same yesterday today and
[20:12] forever how did they indict him because
[20:15] their Creeds would not accept him and
[20:18] down in their heart they know
[20:20] different didn't not Nicodemus in the
[20:22] third chapter St John well expressed
[20:24] Rabbi we the Pharisees the preachers the
[20:27] teachers we though you're a teacher sent
[20:30] from God for no man could do the things
[20:32] that you do unless God was with
[20:35] him they publicly witness it by one of
[20:37] their renowned man and do because of
[20:42] their Creeds a crucified Christ and
[20:44] today there's not a reader that cannot
[20:46] read acts 238 is same as I can read it
[20:49] and the rest of it is the same as I can
[20:50] read it but because of their Creeds and
[20:53] because of their denominational tickets
[20:56] that they got in their pocket the marks
[20:57] of the Beast that packing around as
[20:59] Fellowship cards and taking those things
[21:02] they crucify to themselves Jesus Christ
[21:05] the fresh and crucifying before the
[21:07] public and blaspheme the very God that
[21:09] promised to do
[21:11] this bringing damnation upon the
[21:14] [Music]
[21:16] race there there are
[21:19] they not the sinner
[21:23] they that is the Church of that
[21:27] day they found found fault with the man
[21:30] who was the
[21:32] word is that right they found fault with
[21:36] the man who was the word now they find
[21:40] fault with the word working through the
[21:44] man and it's vice versa which is in the
[21:48] person that the holy spirit is working
[21:50] through is God's Vindication how did
[21:53] they know he was Christ because his
[21:55] Works prove what he
[21:56] was he said which one of you you can
[21:58] condemn me of sin if I haven't done just
[22:01] exactly what the scripture said I would
[22:02] do and which somebody tell me where a
[22:05] fail somewhere if I haven't showed every
[22:07] sign of that I am the Messiah that I'm
[22:09] the very one that you promised they said
[22:11] well we have Moses We Believe Moses said
[22:14] if you would have believed Moses you'd
[22:15] believe me if you Moses seen my day and
[22:20] desired to to live in this day Moses
[22:22] seemed a far off in the prophets and
[22:24] here you are living right by it and can
[22:26] said you Hypocrites said you can discern
[22:28] the the face of the Skies but the sign
[22:29] of the time you can't
[22:32] discern there it is the sign of the time
[22:36] what did he class him a
[22:37] fanatic a crazy man yeah they found
[22:41] fault with the man who was the word he
[22:44] was the word
[22:47] [Music]
