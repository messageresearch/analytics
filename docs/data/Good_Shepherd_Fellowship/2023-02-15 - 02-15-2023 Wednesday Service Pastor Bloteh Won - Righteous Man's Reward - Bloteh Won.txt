Saints after after service all those that hang around to fellowship with them and you see there's uh there's a blessing to uh the the people of God you know just like I said you we we encourage a preacher you know when when when God send a preacher our way uh is it is a big encouragement to be able to receive from uh from uh from that from their Ministry so I believe our brother was very encouraged uh he enjoyed the worship he enjoyed the the response to the word he enjoyed also uh preaching to you so we pray that the Lord will just a bless of musicians God bless you you can have your seat we will do singing if we have time at the end of the service hearing that uh about our brother George passing the kind of a true me off a little bit but uh there are a few things I would want to go over before I just go into the word that we want to something we want to speak on tonight [Music] brother Branham said this uh uh in the message in the invisible Union I want to start with this and uh for the service tonight and it's a prayer meeting if I if I'll get through it okay then I will go into what I want to speak because it's not really uh just something to encourage you but uh uh um and before I go into that the the deacons uh uh been sharing concern and wanted to remind us of our service time uh and uh they wanted us to be reminded for us to uh return back or remind ourselves of remembering the service time you know on Wednesday night the church is open at seven o'clock some self is supposed to be at 7 30 and they want to remind us so we can we can be able to to go now listening to to uh to that I mean they were kind of for talking they had a uh reminding me on that and especially on Sunday also uh the service time is 10 o'clock that's when the service is open we're supposed to have a time of prayer just before the the Sunday School tape comes on now those things are very important and uh especially what uh what I want to read here and I I was thinking on that and I was just saying Lord uh I don't believe it is it is time for us to to scare you or whip you into that I don't think that's the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be something that you be live out we must we must be quick into death we must we must we must be catch up with that if we have to come and then start to uh make a sermon out of it and run behind you you know let's come to church on time then there is just something wrong with that picture so like brother Branham said yeah he says but watch when their spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back in line herself up with the word so you see the bride Revival is her lining up with the word praise the Lord if we are not lining up with the word uh the the Revival the church Revival is where we you know we uh uh we we put Bibles on the street we paint pictures up we you know put two preachers there Dynamic explosive Revival you know and that's the church Revival but the bride's Revival is when she's lining up with the word praise the Lord in every aspect of our life not only church ordered in every aspect of our life now so listen to this watch when when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a Revival when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word wash then again you see how that the scripture at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that brine catch that woman praise the Lord and that will be a raptury message in another sense it is when the message now starts becoming quick into you you are on the expectation praise the Lord he says for as the word Satan the deceiver who deceived the first bride to sinning against God by misbelieving his word now listen to this and now today as we see the church natural in your intellectual gospel praise the Lord and there and and we we cannot Ascend ourselves from this there's a bunch of intellectual approach around the message we know the courts we know the scripture we can we can give one court and we can counteract it with another Court and all of those things can just be intellectual we can defend our position while we are doing what we are doing we can find a Bible verse we can find the code and defend that and yet it can be just from an intellectual standpoint praise the Lord now but you see uh just before that you have to see your brother Branham before bringing that intellectual he make us to to say he says what what Satan that deceiver who deceive the first bride by sinning against God but misbelieving his word praise the Lord so the position of an intellectual Fair is that you can have all the reasoning of the word and give yourself reason why you should do certain things and yet you are misbelieving God's word because what what is the approach of the enemy is to take the effect of the word when if he can take the effect of the word you can stay with all the knowledge of the word but there is no power to bring forth life he says so the church natural in your intellectual Faith Glory father and father away from the word in Social Gospel we find that the the women of the word on the on the street members of such is caring themselves in some atmosphere you can't tell them they have they have lost all sense of common defensing the people have in all and that's the way the church has and you can see it's going straight to the in communica Council just as soon as anything in the world all right into Rome as hard as it can go cause it's prophesied and there she is that's her behavior but then watch again to the spiritual church how that group of people call out elected true every Revival in Martin Luther's is it happens the same way in the Reformation it happened the same way in the time of John John Wesley it happened the the same thing when Pentecostal first started they dropped them women right back in line with the word and then they'd Drift Away there she goes right back over into chaos but then the time that the people are ready to line up there is a message come from now so you see it is we're not looking for them not a messenger praise the Lord there is not another messenger order not a message coming forth but what is happening in this in this condition is that when we start lining up with the word then the word starts becoming real to you the words that becoming person to you because the promise in this age is that it has to be Christ in bright form so is the word picking on your flesh once again is you rising up to a faith where you can you can speak and believe that it will happen if you are not lining up with the word it is just intellectual praise the Lord Luther was the messenger of one day justification in the church lying right with it some of them the rest of them continue on Wesley come with sanctification the church lying rights with a Pentecostal come with the restoration of the gift the church line and every time they line up with the word they got the result of the word regard the result of the word praise the Lord how can I overcome brother Branham says how can we overcome he says is to keep life right amen he says if we are not keeping to the life of the word we are just like that uh dead Lock you know he talked about the dead lock that looks so big but everything inside has been eaten up he says that just I will be you see so that's how we keep uh uh uh life and and and that's how we also keep the revival going is to line up we have to we have to we have to watch ourselves we have to remember in the preview of the Bride that was how that Vision ended by the sounding of stay in line because that's your Revival your Revival is to stay in line and what the enemy will fight against is to take you out of line praise the Lord that's the reason why it's not going to be a public show it's not going to be a public show it's going to be you as an individual staying in line with the world in every aspect of our life so even as a church we have to realize that if we want if we want to to have a Revival if we want to have and and and I would say is the other uh uh the Lord has blessed us you know the Lord has blessed us but yet uh you know we cannot we can add for our hands we cannot knock our chest for that we have to improve you know all all of the brothers that come and preach here they really enjoyed preaching to you and walks makes a church responsive is when you are in the word praise the Lord and when you are in the word you are studying the word you are listening to the tapes you are praying up you know uh uh it it it takes the preacher out of his notes a preacher can feed it he can feed it when the people are paying attention he can feed it when the people are in the subject he can also feed it when the people are distracted Pentacles come with the restoration of the gift the church line right with it the elite of that day and then fade away went right back off in denominationalism and went right out with the rest of them all of them write down along the line now but you notice when the people begin to try to line with the word there come a fresh message from the word of God rise straight to the people and they catch that message and line up every time is just it's just in God's we we have that we have family every family in year is custom to that sometimes everything will run fine for you for years then all at once you will hit a spell where you said uh uh we say it many times in the South when it rains it falls and everything goes wrong you are going through a nighttime then there's a day break then at night time everything runs in come Trinity praise the Lord and uh God gave no of his This Promise I would just I was just talking to uh a brother and we were we were talking something this morning and I remember this uh you know when I was we were kind of for fellowshipping and I was trying to uh remind him Genesis 8 . 22 that's the last verse there the law saying to Noah why the Earth remaineth see time Harvest Time cold heat summer winter and day and night shall not cease so it's pretty much the same thing that brother Branham is saying here we go through those Seasons we go through those spells you know but we have to know we have to know uh our promise we have to know uh uh you know uh what is promised us for our dying we have to know what the law will have us to do praise the Lord amen and uh and you you uh if you just if you just look at it you will realize that it is it is it is uh it is a constant it is a constant struggle you know you see things keep falling to the left every time you try to keep it right you know clean the you know the the house and then before you come back again everything is out of order you got to put things back in order you know that is just a physical sign of how things goes in our spirit man praise the Lord so we have to be conscious of that amen let's let's turn tonight to uh James chapter five let's turn to James Chapter Five for uh the reading of the word and uh praise the Lord what a mighty God we self what a mighty God we sell James chapter 5. that is uh pretty um Familia scripture for the prayer meeting let's read from verse 17. verse 16 we give us a good picture confess your thoughts one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual servant prayer of a righteous man a village much Elias was a man subject to like passion as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not reign in it rained on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the F brought forth of fruits brethrens if any do if any of you do Earth from the truth and won convert him let him know that he which converted The Sinner from the era of his ways shall save a soul from death and Shahid a multitude of sins let's pray together father we just want to ask your blessings tonight Lord and and we pray that God you will just bless the portion of word that is before us to you be the praise to you be the glory and honor father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat while we turn now to uh Matthew chapter 10. so uh tonight I want to take you know we've been talking on uh there are more righteous than ah we we went and looked at Abraham uh uh that was also uh God promising great and exceeding reward we were looking at uh that which uh the righteousness that exceed the righteousness of the strap and Pharisees so we were looking at that that sense of exceeding you know Paul used it now that is under the same language when brother Branham talks about super Faith he talks about super sign he talks about super is exceeding you know abundant yeah there was nothing to to create another race no it was just meaning there God is going to leave us in in uh or leave us or bless us in and exceed in faith now but I want I want us to just look at something tonight uh Matthew chapter 10. Matthew chapter 10 let's read from verse 14. Matthew chapter 10 let's read from verse 40. he that receive you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man reward and whosoever shall give a drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward amen now uh I know we you read this and uh people that are familiar with the message you go direct your mind goes directly to uh the code there where brother Brandon was asked what is a prophet's reward now I want to I want us to just look at that a little bit and uh and also to be able to to uh to appreciate something here in a way that the that the scripture uh plays some things now so you see Jesus here he's he's he's he's talking in the sense of reward yet and you know and and we know that God reward his people and he's talking about uh you know uh uh being received and talking to the disciples you know uh because he's sending them out uh into missions and says you know him that receive you receive mean him that receive a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive your prophet's reward now uh uh you know someone asked me this question back before Wednesday since his brother won you know Broadband talks about a prophet reward but what is a righteous man reward because it looks like he only answered one part of the the the the scripture because he was asked what is a prophet's reward but what is a righteous man reward now you see it is where in the scripture you will find it looks like two separate statements but it's one in the same praise the Lord okay let's let's look at another one that is very common to us Isaiah chapter 53 we will come back to this Isaiah chapter 53. I hope I can be able to run over this quickly and then just give a little time here for us to pray before we close the service [Music] Isaiah chapter 53 here the Bible says verse 1 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal it looks like two different questions but it is it is it is in the place where one question is answering another question praise the Lord amen because brother Branham would take that in a message to whom the arm of the Lord revealed he says this he said who have believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he said here is it tonight they believe they report the arm of the Lord is revealed amen so them that believe the report they are the one that sees the arm of the Lord being revealed to them so it looks like two separate questions but it is uh uh uh I mean it is the way that God God speaks to us you know uh uh he's asking the question and he's answering the question also so the prophet of God says yet uh uh here is it tonight they believed the report the arm of the Lord is revealed We Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and now rebuke every Spirit of the devil that will bound these people in the name of Jesus Christ the son of the Living God Amen so when we believe God's report when we believe what the word of God says then the arm of the Lord what is the arm of the Lord the power of God amen then we seize the arm of the Lord on the scene you know are like uh uh uh uh Brother Band help us to understand what the right the right hand of the father means Authority so when we believe his report we believe the word that is Promised for our day then we will see the arm of the Lord so just like we talk about uh being in the Revival of the hour lining up lining ourselves up with the word that's the way we we can be able to see the arm of God in our life praise the Lord so you see for the church word we we the the the the people goes in in you know in an in in this faction word I mean uh the the the the the they gave themselves to to uh uh uh uh praying and you know fasting and you do all of those things but the ability to line up with the word is not there it's not that fasting and praying is wrong we must do that you see but it is almost like if you if you do that uh uh uh in a sense of wanting God to fulfill his word to demonstrate his power and and our life will not line up with the word then is completely contrary praise the Lord so to them that belief his report they are the one that will see the arm of the Lord amen now so if you bring their back to the same thing as a prophet's reward and a righteous man reward is won anything why because a prophet is a righteous man praise the Lord a prophet is a righteous man see brother Branham said yeah in the message uh I am the resurrection and the life he said this he says this is the house of judgment the house of God where God comes down and passes his judgment your pastor is supposed to be a righteous man the congregation is supposed to be with him 100 percent praise the Lord another principle why it's supposed to be that way because it helps to the people to build confidence in the man when his life comes on the question praise the Lord he might call fire down from heaven but it's hard for the people to have confidence in him praise the Lord so if your pastor have to be a righteous man your Prophet also must be a righteous man and and the congregation is supposed to be with him 100 you are supposed to be just a hundred percent together and in there if you are not then Satan God away to get in amen you got a loophole somewhere going to have everything cleared out you need to have everything clear out if there's a question on your mind ask it praise the Lord now so this is the pastor this is the the the the header of the local church but place this also in the place of a prophet as we believe brother bran a message we come honor that message and we believe him proving about the scripture that he is the prophet of Malachi 4. praise the Lord while we have confidence in that Ministry it is not only because we ignored about separency or also but because we realize that God helping to live a righteous life praise the Lord that is the thing there that's the thing that create confidence a righteous life so uh the minister is supposed to have a righteous life he must be a righteous man my mind is flinging here on something but that's fine okay let's go back to this now there are questions there over in question and answer kind of for looking at the time here brother Branham yet he takes that he says someone asks him and says brother Brandon if you have a time please explain Matthew 10 41 I would like to know what is a profit's reward well now Jesus said whosoever receive a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet reward a perfect reward is to be a friend with the prophet whosoever received a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receive a righteous man reward is that right and if they will and if they want to know what a prophet reward is is to be a friend of a prophet see that's that's a reward he's your friend like the shimini woman it might come in handy sometimes praise the Lord now so brother Branham dropped a clue here for us when he brings in the life of the shimini woman now there are a few things there because uh uh uh we want to we want to try and keep the word in context so brother Branham is identifying that uh a prophet's reward is to be the friend of a prophet now you have to remember that in Isaiah I believe that chapter 48 almighty God called Abraham his friend okay so it is more like uh we read the scripture there in uh uh Genesis uh 16 God is saying I am your great and your exceeding reward okay is God bringing you into uh into a place of friendship a place of Covenant you know a place of trust let me see their way a place of trust now so uh uh you realize that uh it must also be at a place where uh uh you know the the office of the of the of the of the of the Prophet is there now a prophet of of the age is a Seer you know uh uh uh he's he's he's not only a prophet to one church he becomes unless it's just a gift in the local body but uh you know a prophet Ministry is a prophet to the to the entire age now but there has also some patterns where you you see that uh uh uh uh that place just like we look at the cold weather brand was talking about the pastor must be a righteous man we took that in time also to be able to relate you know the office of the man and also his life the life that he lived before the people now so it is either place where uh uh if you if you look at you know the the life of the man it is worth God bless a man with such a gift to also because you see what happened is that many people when it gets to the place of experiencing spiritual gift they try to either think they are they are superior or they you cannot come close to them praise the Lord amen and and that is that is a dangerous place even our lord Jesus he was called the friend of sinners the ability to be able to step from their Divine Office and still be a human praise the Lord and say be a human and stay be able to communicate with the people like brother Brandon he's dropping this clue he says just like the shimina woman it might come in handy why she became a friend to the prophet that she could invite him to her house and uh you know and and uh uh uh I mean they could talk brother Brandon will go fishing with uh uh uh some brothers go hunting with some brothers and uh you know and uh and I mean we all we call him brother Brandon the people down his street call him Billy they never even call him a prophet because I mean their brother uh air was reading the quotes a year then brother bam talking I was walking and I saw the girl then it says you can come to our house sometimes I'll be walking I'm greeting her and she can't even answer me praise the Lord no he did not say well don't you know I'm the prophet I fulfill my like I fall praise the Lord amen so in in one sense is a blessing it's a blessing in a way that the scripture have it that the scripture where even open us to the life of some of God's prophet praise the Lord because it's only our phrase that we tell our secret to our life is not hate so that is the area of friendship where there it it is not it is not only that we know the the The Man Behind the pulpit we also know his life praise the Lord we also know his life and that is a reward that is a reward comes and and he's the one that tells us there was nobody that wrote the story it was not system either that wrote the story of Billy Paul that wrote the story it was brother Brandon right after that exchange on the telephone when brother Branham came to to to preach the message total Deliverance he was the one that told us I was on the phone I was tired with these people I told sister media I tell them I'm not here I'm jumping out of the house he was the one I told nobody wrote it it was not after he died that we came to find out praise the Lord amen and he's even letting us know he's even letting us know he says the next time the phone rang Joseph said daddy should I tell them that you are not here he said you see that's how those things rub off he's the one telling all these things what is that it's every word God is rewarding us that's the reason why we cannot deify brother Branham because God has made us to see the man that he was and and Care us of his birth and and tell us of uh his upbringing in him all of his struggle and then we have also seen the place where God takes that very same vessel and he brings the word he tells the needs of the people it's a reward to you praise the Lord now so you can you can see that picture just like he dropped the clue there and you think about uh uh uh Moses think about Moses why you think Quran and Daytona Baron why you think that they even got they're taught to challenge Moses if Moses was only going up in the mountain and coming down and bringing in the the word they will be terrified all the time praise the Lord oh yeah they knew about Moses life he ran away from Egypt they know that one they knew that he grew up in Pharaoh's house they knew that one praise the Lord oh they know also that he married an Egyptian why they knew that one praise the Lord that is a place of a public servant your life is in the hands of the public is before the people but you see to the people it's a reward it's a gift for you to know all of this about this man and still respect him praise the Lord that is the struggle that was a problem that Quran ended on half because you see that is the place where the church word we we we we we we we live for our leaders and we worship them is because we only see them in the eye of the ministry and forget that they are humans to be able to carry the two as a balance is a reward praise the Lord so see the man as a man and to respect the gift of God in the office of God it's a reward praise the Lord and many times many times we get into struggle when those things happen so the prophet of God Will Tell Us in the message respect you know if you don't respect him and just be respect the office because it's a reward okay for example like a son or like a child that is in the house there with their parents and the Dare they see you know they are dead and they see all the struggle and everything can uh you know that place to be able to keep the position that this is my father and also to see his mistakes and and to just to keep it together where Brian told us the hardest thing that God have ever had to deal with is to bring warm water to believe in another praise the Lord we appreciate the person it can be your friend it can be a brother or a sister you know we from far we admire them from far we appreciate them and so now it starts to come close and start to see some weaknesses of one another we have the human tendency of despise in the person but if you have the grace to be able to carry the tool praise the Lord to be able to carry the two you know that it's something that is common in uh uh uh the human nature we are good friends and let's remain good friends forever because the day their friendship break all people will know everything about the things that we know about then we start to tell we start to run our mouth that one I know all his secrets someone says that the reason why I can't get rid of my friends because they know all of my secrets I want to get rid of them but I can't get rid of them because they know all of my secrets I believe that's the reason why uh uh James encouraged us there that if you uh you know uh uh uh have a brother back or help a sister back you cover the multitudes of their weakness you now become a steward when a person share their weaknesses with you you become you manage that that weakness does not change your attitude it's a reward praise the Lord it's a reward take it for take it in a scriptural context let me close here foreign why he came down because lot lot was the one that uh that that that did the choosing to go he was the one that brought the proposal there there is a fighting between our harrismen let's let's separate he brought all of this and then he went down there to Sodom and now he's in trouble it's it was it's easier for Abraham to say he looked for it let he get it but that's not Abraham praise the Lord he heard Lord was in trouble he went for lot what happened Lord came out where did he went he went right back into Sodom you see so you are not helping the person uh based on their attitude you are helping them based on your dealing with God that's why God came down and reward Abraham with himself that's a prophet's reward that's a righteous man reward it's not that all the other man is a Raja member you know that that God actually you know I know I get question mark on him so what are you based in the righteousness on foreign it's a reward that's a prophet's reward that's a a a righteous man reward because a prophet is a righteous man you can separate the two he must be a righteous man or as he just have a gift he's not a prophet if your life do not line up with faith he's not a prophet he just have a gift are we together it's a reward it's a blessing when we can be able to see the weakness of someone and cover it cover it with prayers cover it with encouragement not cover it by allowing them to continue no that's not a covering I'm talking about Now cover it by allowing them to continue then you are you you are participating in it but cover it by having an Earnest talk let's sit down let's let's sit down this thing is not right this thing is not right it's going to destroy you praise the Lord and yet we can go away from there with that person having so much confidence in their heart praise the Lord musicians you can come for tonight let's let's go to the Lord in prayer we have
