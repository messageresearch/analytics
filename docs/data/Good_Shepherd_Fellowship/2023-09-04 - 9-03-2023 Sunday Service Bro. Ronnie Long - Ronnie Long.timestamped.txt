[39:24] here praise the Lord amen you enjoyed
[39:27] the service last night praise the Lord

[39:38] it's not always hot here
[39:41] amen
[39:43] [Music]
[39:45] you know I was talking to brother Brooks
[39:46] yesterday then and uh
[39:50] he called me for something and then we
[39:52] were talking I said I said brother
[39:53] Brooks you got to pray for us our answer
[39:55] went out
[39:56] and I've been trying to find the best
[39:59] salmon on shedra Mission Abednego
[40:02] for the church he got the laugh out of
[40:05] it
[40:06] and then last night brother running was
[40:09] preaching and he started mentioning
[40:10] children and Abednego I said yerry City
[40:14] that's just what we need praise the Lord
[40:16] let's give the Lord a hint of praise
[40:18] [Applause]
[40:22] the Lord bless you you may have your
[40:23] seat for the wine praise the Lord amen
[40:27] and uh again we want a Greek Brother
[40:30] Joseph go to see your job and uh sister
[40:33] Indigo
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:37] amen as we can see we are expecting
[40:40] their baby so we will keep them in
[40:42] prayer that that the Lord will
[40:46] uh bless our sister amen
[40:50] and take her through
[40:52] [Music]
[40:55] but it's good to be in the house of the
[40:56] Lord I Thank
[40:59] brother brother Jordan been working on
[41:02] the ASC situation so I promise you we'll
[41:06] get this thing solved amen we will get

[41:10] coming week brother daily will be here

[41:24] mess of the week we'll send out a text
[41:26] here and uh for what we will be doing so
[41:29] just just be on the expectation praise
[41:32] the Lord
[41:33] because uh our brother
[41:36] Brooks wanted him to come and preach on
[41:39] Wednesday and but he said he would get
[41:42] back to me so all of that could change
[41:44] what our service will be on Wednesday so
[41:47] that's the reason what I said I get back
[41:49] to you praise the Lord and uh
[41:53] let's continue to remember better John
[41:55] Bibi as as we said uh
[42:01] trust in the Lord for the miracle
[42:03] the the doctors who
[42:06] could know more because the the stand
[42:09] could not be pulled because of the
[42:11] growth of the tumor
[42:13] so they're turning him over to a hospice
[42:17] care
[42:19] but his daughter took him home and uh we
[42:23] were there Thursday night
[42:25] to visit with him I was there I was out
[42:28] there late
[42:29] and we spent some time there with them
[42:32] and and hear myself have some time to
[42:35] talk and and pray together
[42:38] and uh
[42:41] I learned Friday he was feeling much
[42:44] better I spoke with him his voice was a
[42:46] bit strong
[42:48] so uh
[42:50] to get back out there to see him this
[42:52] evening so let's just keep him in prayer
[42:54] and
[42:56] it's a win-win situation amen if I were
[43:00] brought across this life system I mean
[43:02] he's waiting for him on the other side
[43:03] amen if the Lord deliver him we will
[43:06] still have him here for the testimony
[43:08] praise the Lord so it's a win-win
[43:11] situation
[43:13] praise the Lord and not to take much of
[43:17] the time we will turn the service over
[43:19] to the preacher but like brother Rowley
[43:22] said we met in uh
[43:25] Alaska
[43:27] knew his dad just a little bit from
[43:30] North Carolina and then
[43:33] but I really enjoyed the service there
[43:36] in Alaska I had to close the meeting but
[43:39] he came in and and just just the way you
[43:43] know just the way to see how our brother
[43:46] was laboring with the with the service
[43:50] there and laboring with the people
[43:52] trying to get them into that channel I
[43:55] mean I was sick that night
[43:57] our sake the first night I preached it
[44:01] was cold and I was sweating I went
[44:03] outside so I caught the cold and you
[44:06] know then and he he prayed chain and uh
[44:10] and kept the service going for the
[44:12] testimony I mean we had an outpouring we
[44:15] had an apple and I was so blessed and I
[44:18] think I got healed to preach the next
[44:20] morning so and uh I was so blessed I was
[44:24] blessed by the the administration I was
[44:27] blessed by the gift you see the thing is
[44:29] not just preaching you know because any
[44:32] man can do it any smart person can do it
[44:35] you know you can go and copied and paste
[44:39] copy it in paste but the thing is for a
[44:42] man to be burdened
[44:44] you know for the man to just stay before
[44:47] God and be burdened and then when he
[44:50] comes he live up with the people he he
[44:53] labeled with the people you know in
[44:55] everything that he tried to do and I
[44:57] could see that last night I mean I told
[44:59] him after the survey I said you have no
[45:01] idea you know what the Holy Ghost was
[45:04] doing last night amen praise the Lord
[45:06] and that's and that's what we look to
[45:08] see that's why we love to see you know
[45:11] just like he said opening his uh
[45:14] a message last night you know uh
[45:20] we can read those things that you know
[45:22] that the prophet said but this message
[45:24] has to be life praise the Lord amen you
[45:28] have to be live and if you just watch
[45:30] the way that the holy spirit is going
[45:32] you know thank God he's taking us far
[45:35] away from all of those uh legalistic
[45:38] preachers that just come and whip the
[45:40] people I mean we're dealing with so much
[45:42] thing out there that will come in church
[45:44] and be and be suppressed by a preacher
[45:47] amen because we're having so much word
[45:49] and so much promises in this book that
[45:52] told us that we are more than conquerors
[45:55] amen that we are more than conquerors so
[45:58] let's turn to our feet and then we'll
[46:01] sing a song here and bring our brother
[46:03] and then he will come and preach we'll
[46:06] give him all of the time we will have
[46:08] only one service today and as we plan to
[46:12] have so we give our brother all the time
[46:14] to just preach and label with us this
[46:17] morning and let's also labor with him
[46:20] man let's let's take let's get our mind
[46:23] from all the destruction let's get into
[46:25] the word and let's labor with our
[46:27] brother let's say Amen to the word let's
[46:30] make it easy for the preacher to preach
[46:32] you see because it is not just preaching
[46:34] to you he's also dealing with Spirits
[46:36] amen he's dealing with spirits that is
[46:38] trying to you know corrupt our mind
[46:41] praise the Lord amen so uh uh we just we
[46:46] just thank the lord we just thank the
[46:49] Lord amen now

[55:19] name amen
[55:22] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[55:24] Lord this morning Saints and for
[55:26] everyone was rested well and
[55:29] amen if you have your Bibles
[55:31] will be off
[55:32] [Music]
[55:35] thank you brother if you have your
[55:37] Bibles return to the book of Hebrews the
[55:39] 10th chapter
[55:46] maybe just want to continue in this
[55:47] thought that we started last night the
[55:49] image
[55:50] will speak for itself
[55:53] in Hebrews the 10th chapter and we'll
[55:55] start at the first verse for the law
[55:57] having a shadow of good things to come
[55:58] and not the very image of the things can
[56:02] never with those sacrifices which they
[56:04] offered year by year continually make
[56:06] the comers they're unto perfect for then
[56:09] would they not have cease to be offered
[56:10] because that the worshipers once purged
[56:13] should have had no more conscience of
[56:16] sins
[56:17] but in those sacrifices there is a
[56:19] remembrance again made of sins every
[56:21] year
[56:22] for it is not possible that the blood of
[56:25] bulls and ghosts should take away sins
[56:27] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[56:30] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[56:32] what is not but a body hast thou
[56:35] prepared me
[56:36] in burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[56:38] sin has thou Hast had no pleasure then
[56:41] said I lo I come in the volume of the
[56:44] book it is written of me speaking of
[56:46] Psalms there to do thy will o God
[56:49] above when he said sacrifice and
[56:51] offering and burn offerings and offering
[56:52] for sin thou what is not neither has
[56:55] pleasure therein which are offered by
[56:58] the law then said he lo I come to do thy
[57:01] will o God he taketh away the first that
[57:04] he may establish the second
[57:06] by the which will we are Sanctified
[57:09] through the offering of the body of
[57:11] Jesus Christ once for all and every
[57:14] pre-standous daily ministering and
[57:15] offering oftentimes the same sacrifices
[57:18] which can never take away sins but this
[57:21] man after he had offered one sacrifice
[57:24] for sins forever sat down on the right
[57:26] hand of God from henceforth expecting
[57:29] until his enemies be made his footstool
[57:32] for by one offering he hath perfected
[57:34] forever them that are sanctified
[57:36] where of the Holy Ghost also is a
[57:38] witness to us for after he had said
[57:41] before after that he had said before
[57:43] this is the Covenant that I will make
[57:45] with him after those days saith the Lord
[57:47] I will put my laws into their hearts and
[57:51] in their minds will I write them and
[57:53] their sins and iniquities will I
[57:56] remember no more
[57:57] now where remission of these is there is
[58:00] no more offering for sin having
[58:02] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[58:05] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[58:08] Amen may God bless his word he may be
[58:10] seated this morning
[58:12] and we all know this portion of
[58:13] scripture uh there at the beginning uh
[58:16] Parts I know sometimes uh the language
[58:19] of of the Old English there is a little
[58:22] bit uh uh troubling to understand but
[58:25] basically what what what Paul is writing
[58:27] here is that the the sacrifice of bulls
[58:30] and goats uh was not was not an eternal
[58:32] sacrifice it was something that had to
[58:34] be made every year and it was something
[58:36] that you were only clean on too and you
[58:38] had to wait for that Feast again to come
[58:40] that you could be cleansed under the
[58:42] sacrifice of the bulls and goats that
[58:43] they would it was Blood for Blood right
[58:46] that's the law of God is there's got to
[58:48] be a Blood for Blood and there's got to
[58:49] be a death for a life and that's that's
[58:52] the contrast of the Fall that we're in
[58:54] there's got to be something given for
[58:55] something received and so in these in
[58:58] these times the the the culture or the
[59:00] the tradition was to have bulls and
[59:02] goats as a sacrifice but it was
[59:04] something that had to be done every year
[59:05] and it was something that you had to
[59:06] wait until that sacrifice was made that
[59:09] you could be free again
[59:11] why what would it be to have to wait for
[59:13] a whole year to to be able to feel free
[59:15] again to have to wait for that Feast of
[59:18] uh to come that that you could you could
[59:20] be pure one more time and then you'd
[59:22] have to go and continue on and labor in
[59:24] that for another year again looking for
[59:26] that Feast to come and my what a time
[59:28] that would be uh just being so walking
[59:31] on tiptoes well just uh so uh anxious
[59:34] for that day to come and and waiting for
[59:37] that sacrifice to come again but I'm so
[59:39] glad this morning that we don't have to
[59:40] wait for a feast to come and we don't
[59:42] have to wait for the sacrifice or a bull
[59:44] or a goat but we have an eternal
[59:47] sacrifice for the offering of sin where
[59:49] where the worshipers once purged are
[59:52] guilty no more where one set you're
[59:54] under sanctification you you have that
[59:57] reputation no more so remember last
[59:59] night we got in a little bit of of the
[1:00:01] labels that have been put over you the
[1:00:03] individual or or the church as a whole
[1:00:05] and the individual labels that Satan has
[1:00:07] put over your life but I thank God that
[1:00:09] we have a sacrifice that's applied this
[1:00:11] morning that that label does not apply
[1:00:13] to us anymore that was what we used to
[1:00:16] be but now we're under a New Covenant
[1:00:19] we're under a new commission and and
[1:00:21] Paul says this by the commission of the
[1:00:23] Holy Ghost is the way that this is
[1:00:25] applied so we cannot just come under
[1:00:27] this Grace uh living any kind of life or
[1:00:30] living any sort of way or just halfway
[1:00:32] in halfway out we are not we're not
[1:00:34] we're not Baptists and we're not we're
[1:00:36] not Presbyterians and we're not
[1:00:38] methodists but we're required to live to
[1:00:39] a higher calling than that we can't just
[1:00:42] live a life out at five days a week and
[1:00:44] then come in for the two days a week we
[1:00:45] come to church and have a good time and
[1:00:47] and act like this applies to us but this
[1:00:50] is to the worshipers that were purged
[1:00:52] under the power of the Holy Ghost so
[1:00:54] friend if you're looking for peace in
[1:00:56] your mind if you're looking for comfort
[1:00:58] in your life get under the power of the
[1:01:00] Holy Ghost and he is the comforter he is
[1:01:03] the one that will lead you and guide you
[1:01:05] into all truths we've got to come
[1:01:06] underneath that headship in order for
[1:01:09] this to apply and that's a wonderful
[1:01:10] thing for me to tell you that that all
[1:01:12] these things apply to everybody out
[1:01:14] there but the truth of it is they don't
[1:01:16] this doesn't apply to everybody out
[1:01:19] there it only applies to those that have
[1:01:21] subjected themselves under the word it
[1:01:24] only applies to those that have laid
[1:01:25] aside every other worry and care and
[1:01:28] desire and have come underneath the
[1:01:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost so I think
[1:01:32] that's an encouragement to us this
[1:01:34] morning amen that we those of us that
[1:01:36] have been under the fountain we know
[1:01:38] that this applies and those of us that
[1:01:40] need to come underneath the fountain we
[1:01:41] see the results of what comes from
[1:01:43] giving our giving our life unto this you
[1:01:46] see if you're going to give something
[1:01:47] you've got to see the return you've got
[1:01:49] to see that there's a result now many
[1:01:51] people will come to church and there's a
[1:01:52] Sunday morning here's the resurrection
[1:01:54] morning and there's many churches and
[1:01:56] assemblies and beliefs and doctrines
[1:01:57] gathered this morning and many of them
[1:01:59] are coming together and they're coming
[1:02:01] to the house of God for fear of going to
[1:02:03] hell let me say that that's not any
[1:02:05] reason to come to church that's not a
[1:02:07] reason to come and worship the Lord just
[1:02:09] because you're scared of going to hell
[1:02:10] but the reason we come to church and
[1:02:12] Worship the Lord as we Behold Him in the
[1:02:15] power of his resurrection and there's a
[1:02:17] love within us for him that though he
[1:02:20] slay me yet I'll trust him though he
[1:02:22] cast me to the side yet I'll love him
[1:02:24] anyway why because my love is for him I
[1:02:27] can't help it now you can't help who you
[1:02:29] fall in love with right you can't help
[1:02:31] who your eye has stayed on and somebody
[1:02:33] might try to talk you out of it and
[1:02:35] maybe there's some young men in here
[1:02:36] looking for a a young lady and you find
[1:02:39] one that your mind is just it's just
[1:02:40] fixed on and that's going to be the one
[1:02:42] and your mama might come and say no
[1:02:44] she's not the one but you know on your
[1:02:46] eye that you've got you've got an eye on
[1:02:48] her and there's a love there for that
[1:02:50] well you can't help who you fall in love
[1:02:52] with thank God that that's his law
[1:02:54] because he fell in love with me he can't
[1:02:56] help who he falls in love with but when
[1:02:58] you ever love somebody there's
[1:03:00] everything that you would give for that
[1:03:01] person you would give everything you
[1:03:03] person because they are the love of your
[1:03:06] life that is why we come to church we
[1:03:09] come because he died for us and there's
[1:03:10] a love there within us we don't come
[1:03:12] that we could have a just a tradition or
[1:03:15] have a service and the order is just
[1:03:16] going to go this way and we're going to
[1:03:17] dismiss and we're gonna go get uh this
[1:03:19] kind of food and we're gonna go get this
[1:03:21] you see the routine that we get stuck in
[1:03:24] and we get stuck in this pattern if we
[1:03:26] if we don't recognize why we come why
[1:03:30] we're here this morning I don't know
[1:03:31] about you but I'm here to hear from the
[1:03:33] throne this morning I'm here to hear
[1:03:34] from God Almighty that he can express
[1:03:36] his love to me this morning I believe
[1:03:39] the songs have been sung and we've
[1:03:40] expressed our love to him oh how great
[1:03:42] are thy works oh God there is none like
[1:03:44] thee and we've given the praise to him
[1:03:46] and now this is the time when he gives
[1:03:48] back to the church by revealing in his
[1:03:51] word who we are we are the image of him
[1:03:55] we are not just something like him we
[1:03:58] are the image of him we're not just
[1:03:59] we're not just something that looks like
[1:04:01] him but we are bone of his bone we are
[1:04:04] flesh of his flesh we are the same in
[1:04:07] substance and word right and I know that
[1:04:10] that seems that seems hard for us to
[1:04:11] grasp because we know our inability
[1:04:13] right we know our faults and our
[1:04:15] failures and how we we fell yesterday we
[1:04:17] made mistakes and we fell short and we
[1:04:19] don't always do the right thing at the
[1:04:21] right time but yet even through that
[1:04:23] your bone of his bone your flesh of his
[1:04:26] flesh now we talk about that story of
[1:04:29] that that that uh uh uh uh Chicago meet
[1:04:32] me owner right and he would come down to
[1:04:34] that farm in Texas to look at his cows
[1:04:36] and he would choose that woman that
[1:04:38] would be his wife and he said I'll be
[1:04:40] back for you and she was the wash woman
[1:04:41] there you know the story right
[1:04:44] do you think that that woman made
[1:04:46] mistakes in that year's time
[1:04:48] sure she did do you think she doubted
[1:04:50] that he would come back sure she did
[1:04:53] she made mistakes
[1:04:55] but she was ready when the day came she
[1:04:59] had her clothes on when the day came she
[1:05:01] had her garments on when the day came so
[1:05:03] it doesn't matter what we did yesterday
[1:05:04] but do you have breath in your lung this
[1:05:06] morning do you have a new breath in your
[1:05:08] lung this morning then God's not done
[1:05:10] with you yet he hasn't thrown you away
[1:05:12] he hasn't forsaken you but God has given
[1:05:15] you breath this morning for another
[1:05:17] chance for Redemption another chance to
[1:05:19] be filled with the Holy Ghost another
[1:05:20] opportunity to give back to him this
[1:05:23] morning I'm so thankful this morning
[1:05:24] church that we are not just here
[1:05:26] guessing if he's going to be here but
[1:05:28] it's a promise it's a promise in the
[1:05:30] word
[1:05:33] for us it's not just for anybody it's
[1:05:36] for us the promise in the word has got
[1:05:39] your name on it it's a letter written to
[1:05:41] you this is a this is a letter with your
[1:05:43] name on it this is a letter addressed to
[1:05:46] you and you've got to open the mail and
[1:05:48] you've got to read about yourself you've
[1:05:50] got to see what is he saying about me
[1:05:51] what is the promises that God is saying
[1:05:54] to me I would say like this there's
[1:05:56] there's value in the book right
[1:05:58] I remember one time a brother told me a
[1:06:01] story he said there was this there was
[1:06:02] this Rich uh uh woman in New York that
[1:06:05] had so much wealth and millions and
[1:06:07] millions of dollars and it came time for
[1:06:09] her to pass away and
[1:06:10] and she had a maid that was faithful
[1:06:12] with her all these years took care of
[1:06:15] her for I think 50 years he said
[1:06:18] and she was with her all this time she
[1:06:19] was a widower and
[1:06:21] a widow and it came time for The
[1:06:23] Inheritance to split up and that's when
[1:06:25] everybody shows up
[1:06:27] and her children were there and I want
[1:06:29] this and I want that and it will begin
[1:06:31] to get dispersed and the house went to
[1:06:32] this one and the money went to this one
[1:06:34] and they began to get dispersed right
[1:06:36] and there the the woman said that she
[1:06:39] used to she used to read this uh she
[1:06:41] used to read this book this map of the
[1:06:43] world and imagine what it would be like
[1:06:45] to travel the world and she would read
[1:06:47] this Atlas and she would look over these
[1:06:49] things it would talk about it would talk
[1:06:50] about the beauty of India and Asia and
[1:06:52] Africa and Europe and Australia and she
[1:06:55] would read about these things and said
[1:06:56] one day I'd like to go there and she
[1:06:57] would always read this book and so when
[1:06:59] it came time for The Inheritance all
[1:07:01] that this made got
[1:07:02] was this book
[1:07:04] you think after 50 years of service that
[1:07:06] you know
[1:07:08] my that's all she got was a book and so
[1:07:10] the children didn't dispute her they
[1:07:12] said yeah she can have the book we want
[1:07:13] this and we want that and we want this
[1:07:15] and so it all got settled out and she
[1:07:16] took this book home
[1:07:18] and she began to open the book
[1:07:20] and in every page
[1:07:22] there was a check for a thousand dollars
[1:07:25] she would turn the page there was
[1:07:26] another check for a thousand dollars and
[1:07:28] there was enough money in there for her
[1:07:30] to go to Every destination that she had
[1:07:32] marked in the book but you see if you
[1:07:34] never open the book then you don't know
[1:07:36] the value that's within it but he said
[1:07:38] lo I come in the volume of the book this
[1:07:41] is where I'm hidden these promises is
[1:07:44] what I've given to the church but if
[1:07:45] we're not looking at the promises then
[1:07:47] we'll never know the value that's within
[1:07:49] it but thank God that a word came in our
[1:07:51] day that was able to open the book and
[1:07:54] to begin to reveal the promises that lay
[1:07:57] in store for the church in this age I
[1:07:59] I'm excited to be a believer in this
[1:08:01] time I'm not downtrodden I'm not
[1:08:03] defeated but I know the value that's
[1:08:05] within this book and I've seen my name
[1:08:07] in there and next to every promise Peter
[1:08:10] would say this is a promise unto you
[1:08:15] who's you
[1:08:17] this is a promise for you so let's just
[1:08:19] settle this and you're wondering if this
[1:08:21] if all this and all this uh all this
[1:08:23] truth in here is for you what did Peter
[1:08:25] say This Promise is to you
[1:08:29] This Promise is to you so just put your
[1:08:32] name right there why don't you just open
[1:08:33] your Bible to act sometime and just just
[1:08:35] write right above right above that you
[1:08:37] write your name there This Promise is
[1:08:39] unto blase This Promise is unto Jordan
[1:08:43] This Promise is unto you this is your
[1:08:46] promise this is what he's given to the
[1:08:49] church now we would be daresome to come
[1:08:51] into the house of God and ask him for
[1:08:53] something when he's already given to us
[1:08:57] that would it would be something for me
[1:08:59] to ask this brother to go get my phone
[1:09:00] back there on the desk but I have my
[1:09:02] phone here
[1:09:03] he'd be back there looking forward and
[1:09:05] looking for it and I would have it right
[1:09:06] here
[1:09:07] but I gotta recognize it's already here
[1:09:09] it would be something for us to come and
[1:09:11] ask for healing and beg for healing in
[1:09:13] the house of God when he's already
[1:09:15] giving it unto us it would be something
[1:09:17] to come in and ask for a fullness of the
[1:09:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost when he's
[1:09:20] already given it unto us God is not a
[1:09:23] great God up there sitting on his throne
[1:09:25] just looking down at us thinking you
[1:09:28] need to try harder
[1:09:29] you need to you need a you need to walk
[1:09:31] on your knees no God is a gracious God
[1:09:34] is a good good father God is in love
[1:09:37] with you God cares about you God is God
[1:09:40] is pleading with you to come God is
[1:09:42] pulling on you to come he's Paving a way
[1:09:44] for you to come if you only could see
[1:09:46] the way that he sees you
[1:09:50] friend if you could only just one time
[1:09:52] look in the mirror and see yourself the
[1:09:54] way God sees you
[1:09:55] I believe we're beginning to see it I
[1:09:57] believe the bride is coming to a
[1:09:59] position where once we look through a
[1:10:01] glass Darkly but now we're seeing him
[1:10:03] face to face beholding him as he is once
[1:10:07] we saw it as shadows and types and
[1:10:09] symbols but now their space is applied
[1:10:11] to those symbols I believe we're rising
[1:10:13] up in the position of John where he was
[1:10:15] caught up in a vision and he began to
[1:10:17] see the people of God in this day
[1:10:19] worshiping in spirit and in truth and we
[1:10:22] are the Fulfillment of that Vision right
[1:10:24] what makes a prophet a prophet the
[1:10:27] Fulfillment of his prophecy right we are
[1:10:30] the Fulfillment of this message whether
[1:10:32] you feel like it whether you feel like
[1:10:34] you look like it whether you act like it
[1:10:36] you are the Fulfillment of this message
[1:10:38] we are what makes this message real so
[1:10:40] you can't come to me and tell me that
[1:10:42] there's nothing to this message because
[1:10:43] I know
[1:10:45] I know that it was speaking directly to
[1:10:48] me I can't speak for everybody else but
[1:10:51] I know that it was speaking right to my
[1:10:53] ear identifying who I am in this age and
[1:10:56] I know who whom I have believed in
[1:10:59] you're not going to persuade me out of
[1:11:00] it you came too late for that right you
[1:11:03] can't come to me and tell me that the
[1:11:04] days of Miracles are passed you came too
[1:11:06] late for that but I've seen too much
[1:11:09] I've experienced too much I've had too
[1:11:11] much love I've had too much grace I will
[1:11:14] not turn away
[1:11:16] our our entire Focus has to be on this
[1:11:19] the days the Miracles are not past
[1:11:20] friends we're not just hoping for
[1:11:22] another man to come we don't need
[1:11:24] another man to come that's right we
[1:11:25] don't need another man to come back we
[1:11:27] already have what he promised you can
[1:11:29] murder William Branham but the seed has
[1:11:32] already been sown in the message you can
[1:11:34] take him off the scene but the seed has
[1:11:36] already been on display in the people
[1:11:38] it's too late it's too late and the
[1:11:42] critics try to rise up now and say this
[1:11:43] or say that well where were they when
[1:11:45] the prophet was standing in the Pulpit
[1:11:47] did they have anything to say brother
[1:11:49] Brandon would plead with them please
[1:11:51] come please come to this pulpit and tell
[1:11:54] me where I'm wrong in this scripture I
[1:11:57] challenge you to come
[1:11:58] nobody
[1:12:02] nobody would come hey as service after
[1:12:04] service he would beg the people come
[1:12:06] tell me where I'm wrong come tell me
[1:12:08] where I'm wrong now I'm not that bold
[1:12:09] this morning
[1:12:12] but if I say what the word says then I
[1:12:16] have the confidence to know it's in here
[1:12:18] and if it's in here then it's correct if
[1:12:21] it's in here then it still applies today
[1:12:23] if it's in here if it ever did apply it
[1:12:25] still applies today the confidence to
[1:12:27] know and nobody came to challenge him
[1:12:29] but yeah you take the man off the scene
[1:12:31] and now all the critics rise up and now
[1:12:33] everybody has something to say and now
[1:12:35] everybody's got an opinion or and I
[1:12:37] would just ask everybody that has a a
[1:12:39] critical spirit were you there
[1:12:41] go ahead
[1:12:43] were you there when that happened
[1:12:45] well no
[1:12:47] then I'll take it from the eyewitness
[1:12:50] I don't really care what you have to say
[1:12:52] I'll listen to the one that was there
[1:12:54] I'll listen to the one that witnessed it
[1:12:56] actually happened if you weren't there
[1:12:57] you know in in Ministry we hear a lot of
[1:13:00] of third-party stories
[1:13:02] no he said she said and this one said
[1:13:04] and I didn't hear this directly from the
[1:13:05] source but just take me out my word and
[1:13:07] you end up wondering but were they there
[1:13:09] right did they actually hear them say
[1:13:11] that or do they actually see that happen
[1:13:13] and then begin to you begin to wonder
[1:13:14] whether you're actually there when this
[1:13:16] happened
[1:13:17] well no
[1:13:18] well then we can't credit your testimony
[1:13:20] right you weren't an eyewitness but
[1:13:23] Peter says we have beheld the more
[1:13:26] excellent Glory of Christ being
[1:13:28] eyewitnesses of His Majesty of the
[1:13:31] Transfiguration of what we're no people
[1:13:33] into a supernatural race of God I
[1:13:36] believe that's where we're at this
[1:13:37] morning I believe we beheld the glory
[1:13:41] Amy I believe we've been held something
[1:13:42] greater than the rest of the world has
[1:13:44] beheld and we are coming to the fullness
[1:13:46] of this now this this quote here from
[1:13:48] Feast of trumpets is where I got this
[1:13:49] thought from that we started in last
[1:13:51] night we didn't quite get to the thought
[1:13:52] but we just trust the Lord did what he
[1:13:54] had to do
[1:13:55] but the man would say it's What God Says
[1:13:58] that is the word the bride is with their
[1:14:02] one how can they be one when that word
[1:14:05] was wrote there becomes in you and make
[1:14:08] you and the word becomes one pretty
[1:14:11] simple right when you believe it the
[1:14:13] word comes into you and now you're one
[1:14:16] that's exactly what he promised then
[1:14:19] interpret it God don't need an
[1:14:21] interpreter they say well we interpret
[1:14:23] it like this you've got no right to
[1:14:25] interpret nothing God does his own
[1:14:27] interpretation God said let there be
[1:14:29] light and there was life who interprets
[1:14:31] that he said a virgin shall conceive and
[1:14:34] she did you don't need any interpreter
[1:14:36] it's already interpreted and God said
[1:14:39] these things would happen in this day
[1:14:41] and it is it don't need an interpreter
[1:14:44] it interprets itself
[1:14:47] Hallelujah
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:14:50] Hallelujah if you could if you can see
[1:14:52] what I see it interprets itself
[1:14:54] we're not waiting for somebody to come
[1:14:56] and put a stamp of approval on how we
[1:14:58] worship or how we enjoy the word but we
[1:15:01] are the bride now you asked me how the
[1:15:03] bride is supposed to act
[1:15:05] right how the bride of Christ is
[1:15:06] supposed to act you say well you're two
[1:15:08] you're too charismatic or you get too
[1:15:10] carried away or you yell too much or you
[1:15:12] run too much well I'm the bride
[1:15:14] I cannot help the expression of what's
[1:15:16] on the inside of me there is nothing to
[1:15:18] say that I can't do that there's nothing
[1:15:20] to say that I can't express myself that
[1:15:22] way there's nothing to say that you
[1:15:24] can't just head not in hand raise and
[1:15:25] you're the bride you can express
[1:15:28] yourself how you feel to express
[1:15:30] yourself as long as you're free in the
[1:15:32] word then then you're free to worship
[1:15:35] but too many men have come and tried to
[1:15:37] put a label on you can't do this and you
[1:15:39] can't do that and this is too crazy and
[1:15:40] this is too charismatic and you're going
[1:15:42] to be end up in Pentecost you're going
[1:15:44] to end up going back to here
[1:15:46] sure I'm the bride
[1:15:50] who's writing the next chapter of the
[1:15:52] book Acts
[1:15:53] who's writing the last chapter of the
[1:15:55] book of Acts that will have no end who's
[1:15:56] writing that I am you are so how should
[1:16:00] we act we should act the way that the
[1:16:02] spirit gives assumption to act so you're
[1:16:04] not gonna bother me this morning if you
[1:16:06] want to shout or run or you want to sit
[1:16:08] there and you want to wave or you want
[1:16:09] to stare you do what you do because you
[1:16:11] are the bride and the bride is the only
[1:16:14] one who knows how she should worship I
[1:16:16] don't think it's for a man to stand
[1:16:18] behind a Pulpit and dictate to the
[1:16:20] people how they should worship
[1:16:22] are we worshiping in vain do we have a
[1:16:24] revelation of this then we're not
[1:16:26] worshiping in vain if we know who we're
[1:16:28] worshiping that we're not doing it out a
[1:16:30] vain repetition but we know why we come
[1:16:33] into the house of the Lord we know why
[1:16:35] we bring the sacrifice of praise into
[1:16:37] the house of the Lord and far be it for
[1:16:39] me or any other man to come and dictate
[1:16:41] to the bride how they should give back
[1:16:43] to God I say Let Freedom Ring in the
[1:16:46] house of God I say let Liberty loose in
[1:16:48] the house of God this
[1:16:50] time for the bride
[1:16:54] praise she's free to give Glory she's
[1:16:57] free to do the miraculous she's free to
[1:16:59] do whatever the spirit gives her action
[1:17:01] to do in this age
[1:17:04] we're not under the Mandate of a man or
[1:17:06] a bishop or we're just that would be
[1:17:07] another denomination right but we're
[1:17:09] supposed to be free from denomination
[1:17:11] freed from a denominational Spirit or
[1:17:13] attitude or nickelodeonism we are free
[1:17:17] to worship God how we feel to worship
[1:17:20] Him
[1:17:22] you say well what would make somebody
[1:17:23] act so crazy
[1:17:25] as to run around the church and to shout
[1:17:27] an amen into
[1:17:29] but if you were where they were
[1:17:36] if you had been through the troubles
[1:17:37] that they've been through
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:41] if you had been caught in the bondage of
[1:17:43] condemnation that they had been caught
[1:17:45] in
[1:17:46] sure if you had drug yourself into this
[1:17:49] building like they drug themselves in
[1:17:50] here
[1:17:51] just wondering if this was going to be
[1:17:53] their last service
[1:17:54] I've been I've been in this I've been
[1:17:56] I've been going to a message church for
[1:17:58] 35 years you know how many times I've
[1:18:01] said I'm never going back
[1:18:04] sister how long you been in the message
[1:18:09] did you ever come a time where you
[1:18:11] thought I'll never go back I'm just
[1:18:12] going to give up
[1:18:14] well that's good faith I I'm gonna be
[1:18:18] I'm just gonna be real I don't know who
[1:18:20] else to be I've definitely got some
[1:18:22] defeats and got some I got offended by
[1:18:24] people in the church I got offended by
[1:18:25] Ministries I got offended by hurt by
[1:18:27] different things and I thought Within
[1:18:29] Myself I'm not going back
[1:18:31] I'm just going to turn away I'm gonna do
[1:18:32] it I'm not gonna go live a life of sin
[1:18:34] because there's something that's on the
[1:18:35] inside that won't allow that but I'm
[1:18:37] just gonna go live in a mountain
[1:18:38] somewhere I'm gonna move to me and my
[1:18:40] wife joke we look for houses in Montana
[1:18:42] all the time because there's just nobody
[1:18:43] there we're just gonna move out to
[1:18:45] Montana and we're just gonna be by
[1:18:46] ourselves and we're just gonna hermit
[1:18:48] out there
[1:18:49] because because it's too hard to put up
[1:18:52] with everybody and everything and who's
[1:18:53] right and who's wrong and I'll just go
[1:18:55] off and be by myself
[1:18:58] anybody else ever thought that
[1:19:01] all right just just tap yourself are you
[1:19:04] here
[1:19:06] even when you thought you'd give up
[1:19:08] you're still here even when you thought
[1:19:10] you'd go back to Africa you thought
[1:19:12] you'd go back to Arizona or you thought
[1:19:13] you'd moved to Montana or you thought
[1:19:15] you moved to Timbuktu you're still here
[1:19:17] this morning why because safety cannot
[1:19:20] stop what God has started and even
[1:19:22] though we wouldn't have the courage
[1:19:23] within ourselves to continue God has put
[1:19:26] something within us that is pulling us
[1:19:28] that is drawing us and it's not even by
[1:19:31] our strength it's by his strength within
[1:19:33] us
[1:19:34] how did you get here this morning
[1:19:36] there's something on the inside of you
[1:19:37] were those times when you couldn't you
[1:19:39] didn't want to come to the house of God
[1:19:41] you said I'm never coming back but yet
[1:19:42] you came
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:48] what was it
[1:19:49] there had to have been something to
[1:19:51] Anchor in there
[1:19:52] there had to be something in you that
[1:19:54] Christ could set his acre point to and
[1:19:57] pull you right if it was just the
[1:19:58] strength of a man that anchor wouldn't
[1:20:00] hold if it was just the strength of a
[1:20:02] man you would just have given up and
[1:20:04] walked away like many others have but
[1:20:06] you're here this morning because there's
[1:20:08] something on the inside of you that you
[1:20:10] did not put there that your preacher did
[1:20:12] not put there that's your mom or your
[1:20:14] dad did not put there but God put a seed
[1:20:16] inside you that he could hook his anchor
[1:20:19] to and he could pull you he could pull
[1:20:22] you into his presence and that seat is
[1:20:24] what's pulling us here this morning and
[1:20:26] it was put there before the foundation
[1:20:27] of the world that's right you didn't get
[1:20:29] that seed when you came to the Altar and
[1:20:31] gave your heart to the Lord no that seed
[1:20:32] is what Drew you to that place the seed
[1:20:35] was already there
[1:20:37] it had to have been
[1:20:39] the election of God so he can't help who
[1:20:42] he falls in love with
[1:20:45] him oh well I've sinned and I've I've
[1:20:47] fallen short and how could he love me he
[1:20:49] can't help who he falls in love with
[1:20:52] right he's already put a seat in there
[1:20:54] and even though you try to run there he
[1:20:56] is and David would make his own bed in
[1:20:59] hell there he is he would try to run a
[1:21:01] man running from the presence of the
[1:21:03] Lord there he is and he would try to get
[1:21:05] away and try to get away I tried to get
[1:21:07] away from this my entire I don't want to
[1:21:08] be a preacher
[1:21:10] well I want to be a preacher I saw how I
[1:21:13] went for my dad and I saw I went for
[1:21:14] this brother and that brother I don't
[1:21:15] want to be involved with this I tried to
[1:21:16] run so hard for this
[1:21:18] here I am
[1:21:23] and you've tried to give up
[1:21:25] sure and you said I'll never be back
[1:21:28] but here you are
[1:21:30] you say well I'm just not now why would
[1:21:32] God call you to this place
[1:21:34] and then just leave you
[1:21:36] I'm just gonna keep holding you and keep
[1:21:38] bringing you that you'll just dry up on
[1:21:39] a chair someday
[1:21:42] if God brought you here this morning
[1:21:44] then God's got a purpose in mind for you
[1:21:47] if you still have breath in your lungs
[1:21:49] then God's got purpose for your life
[1:21:51] right is that what that
[1:21:54] God will only take you when your purpose
[1:21:56] has been fulfilled are you here this
[1:21:58] morning do you have breath in your lungs
[1:22:00] and there is a purpose in your life
[1:22:02] you're here for a reason you're here to
[1:22:05] fulfill the word of God you're here to
[1:22:07] put Satan under your feet you're here to
[1:22:09] manifest every promise in the word
[1:22:11] you're here for a purpose so don't come
[1:22:14] to church thinking you're just coming on
[1:22:15] another Sunday but you're here this
[1:22:17] morning for a purpose many of you drove
[1:22:20] maybe hours I don't know how far
[1:22:21] everybody lives but you're here this
[1:22:23] morning for a purpose you did not come
[1:22:26] of your own accord or your own strength
[1:22:28] but God rich in Mercy has brought you
[1:22:30] here this morning and he did not bring
[1:22:32] you here to just fill a seat he brought
[1:22:33] you here to reveal something to you
[1:22:36] he brought you here to make you better
[1:22:38] than how you came we have a reason to
[1:22:41] worship and rejoice the bride knows what
[1:22:44] she's shouting about the bride knows why
[1:22:46] she's so joyous and happy and there's a
[1:22:49] smile there that you can't control and
[1:22:51] you can't put down because she knows
[1:22:53] he's coming for me he's coming for me
[1:22:57] and he's here I feel him in the midst I
[1:23:01] feel him in the life I feel him in my in
[1:23:03] my walk I feel him everywhere around me
[1:23:05] he's already come he's here the Revival
[1:23:08] for the bride is not coming the Revival
[1:23:10] for the bride is already here
[1:23:14] now when are we gonna get revived we
[1:23:16] ought to do it right now we ought to say
[1:23:18] I'm ready let the Revival Fire come let
[1:23:22] the consuming fire come and consume what
[1:23:24] we brought to the house of the Lord this
[1:23:26] morning we speak for ourselves
[1:23:30] him in US
[1:23:32] the final voice
[1:23:34] to the final age
[1:23:37] as we talked about last night
[1:23:40] how Michelangelo would make this Moses
[1:23:43] they would labor in this statue and
[1:23:44] labor and making it perfect and
[1:23:46] Michelangelo would look back upon this
[1:23:48] statue and he would say my eyes so
[1:23:50] beautiful
[1:23:51] looks just the way it's so real
[1:23:54] it's it's so lifelike there should be
[1:23:56] life in this you see the attribute of
[1:23:58] the creator
[1:24:00] but he's not God
[1:24:02] so what does he do he takes his hammer
[1:24:04] and he says speak
[1:24:06] and he slays the statue and the chip
[1:24:08] comes off the knee
[1:24:09] speak
[1:24:11] no matter how hard he would scream at
[1:24:13] that statue it would never speak because
[1:24:14] he didn't have the Breath of Life
[1:24:18] but he would Smite the statue and he
[1:24:20] would say speak
[1:24:23] that statue would just stare at him I
[1:24:25] wonder what that statue would say
[1:24:28] had it been able to speak
[1:24:31] Moses was trapped inside this rock
[1:24:34] all these years since the beginning of
[1:24:36] time trapped inside this block of
[1:24:38] granite and this man takes the time to
[1:24:41] release him
[1:24:43] to make him the image that he always was
[1:24:47] what do you think that statue would say
[1:24:52] what do you say
[1:24:55] I can't say anything but thank you
[1:25:03] we're all sinners
[1:25:05] we've all come short of the glory of God
[1:25:07] and yet to think that a block image like
[1:25:09] that that God would take the time with
[1:25:11] me just a hypocrite on the front Pew
[1:25:13] just waiting for church to get over so I
[1:25:15] could go hang out with so-and-so or go
[1:25:16] do whatever but God would take the time
[1:25:18] with me an individual
[1:25:20] and everybody comes from a different
[1:25:22] walk and maybe you were out insane and
[1:25:23] you were on the streets but God would
[1:25:25] come down and he would take you
[1:25:27] and he would begin carve on it and work
[1:25:30] on it and then he would Breathe the
[1:25:31] Breath of Life of the Holy Ghost into
[1:25:33] that and that would be given the power
[1:25:35] to speak what would you say this morning
[1:25:37] I say we have a reason to praise him
[1:25:39] this morning I say we've got a reason to
[1:25:42] give him thanks this morning that he's
[1:25:44] thought so much of us that he would give
[1:25:46] his own life to it that he would give
[1:25:48] his own breath of life into us that we
[1:25:50] could speak and then we come and we
[1:25:52] don't use it for his glory
[1:25:55] my
[1:25:58] what would we do with that power now we
[1:26:00] see the world does it they take the
[1:26:01] music and they pervert it and they're
[1:26:02] this and they're that those are all
[1:26:03] attributes of God
[1:26:06] but therefore the original purpose of of
[1:26:08] worship
[1:26:10] we know why we're worshiping we know who
[1:26:15] we're worshiping I don't think we should
[1:26:17] let any any label that's been put on the
[1:26:20] church
[1:26:21] condemn us for how we worship you're
[1:26:24] built different than everybody else is
[1:26:25] built
[1:26:27] you're built different I can prove it to
[1:26:28] you in the scripture you are built
[1:26:30] different than everybody else's Bill God
[1:26:33] has designed you as an overcomer in this
[1:26:36] age he's designed you this is uh this is
[1:26:38] uh I gotta skip thoughts here but I just
[1:26:40] feel the Lord moving here
[1:26:42] are we together yeah
[1:26:44] Exodus the 28th chapter now remember the
[1:26:47] individuality of God I'll try not to
[1:26:49] hold you that that long this morning we
[1:26:51] got a timer so we'll try to stick to it
[1:26:54] but if I'm the one up here working
[1:26:56] sweating then you can you can bear with
[1:26:57] me right
[1:26:58] Exodus the 28th chapter
[1:27:02] and thou shalt make the breastplate of
[1:27:04] judgment with the cunning work after the
[1:27:05] work of the ephod Thou shalt make it of
[1:27:08] gold and blue and purple and Scarlet
[1:27:09] enough fire twine linen a fine twine
[1:27:12] linen Thou shalt make it foursquares
[1:27:14] shall be being doubled a span shall be
[1:27:17] the length thereof and a span shall be
[1:27:19] the breadth thereof now this is all you
[1:27:20] think how does this apply to us watch
[1:27:22] the detail
[1:27:23] of God's work
[1:27:25] this is how God is telling Moses to make
[1:27:28] this
[1:27:29] and thou shalt set it in settings of
[1:27:31] stones even four rows of stones in the
[1:27:33] first row shall be a sardius a topaz and
[1:27:36] a carbuncle this shall be the first row
[1:27:39] and the second row shall be an emerald a
[1:27:41] sapphire and a diamond and the third row
[1:27:43] of the guru in an egg in an amethyst and
[1:27:47] the fourth row of barrel and an onyx
[1:27:48] into Jasper they shall be said in in
[1:27:51] Gold of their enclosings and the stone
[1:27:53] shall be with the names of the children
[1:27:54] of Israel 12 according to their names
[1:27:57] like the Engravings of the Signet
[1:27:59] everyone with his name shall they be
[1:28:01] according to the Twelve Tribes so if you
[1:28:04] don't know we're talking about the urum
[1:28:05] and thumbum right the breastplate inside
[1:28:07] the holy of holies
[1:28:09] now think about this brother
[1:28:11] if you could if you could get to the
[1:28:13] urum and thumb today
[1:28:16] how long of a line would you wait in
[1:28:20] to know
[1:28:21] the plan of God for your life
[1:28:24] to know that you're walking in the
[1:28:25] perfect will who should I marry what
[1:28:27] church should I go to who's who you know
[1:28:29] should I should I should I preach should
[1:28:30] I not should I do this should I not
[1:28:32] should I if we could get to the urum and
[1:28:34] thumb that could answer that question
[1:28:36] how long of a line will we waited sure
[1:28:39] as long as it took and these children of
[1:28:42] Israel would give they'd have a dream or
[1:28:44] a word and they'd give it to Aaron or
[1:28:45] the aaronic priesthood and they would go
[1:28:47] into the holy of holies and they would
[1:28:48] speak this and the breastplate would
[1:28:50] cast a light right and if it cast a
[1:28:52] light then they would know that that
[1:28:53] dream was from the Lord or that word was
[1:28:55] from the Lord or they should do that
[1:28:57] because it was of the Lord because you
[1:28:58] can't mimic that there's nothing in
[1:28:59] there to cast that light but as the
[1:29:01] light would cast across us it would make
[1:29:02] a perfect rainbow light
[1:29:05] and there's no way to get a perfect
[1:29:06] rainbow unless you have all these stones
[1:29:08] in this exact order so God is giving
[1:29:11] this order to Moses to build the
[1:29:12] breastplate this way because he knows
[1:29:14] it's the only way that'll work and it
[1:29:16] can't be impersonated any other way I
[1:29:18] sent the brother a picture do we have
[1:29:19] that picture of the of the uh of the
[1:29:21] breastplate
[1:29:26] I know you don't bring in an evangelist
[1:29:28] to teach but I just feel like we should
[1:29:29] go this direction this morning
[1:29:32] okay so that's an exact order
[1:29:34] of the breastplate right
[1:29:36] I actually took this picture off of
[1:29:38] brother Tim Pruitt's desk this he has
[1:29:39] this sitting on his desk and it's
[1:29:41] exactly this way he got it from Israel
[1:29:43] and every stone in here and and these
[1:29:44] Stones aren't necessarily they're not
[1:29:46] shining diamonds they're not just
[1:29:47] beautiful works but everything is
[1:29:49] exactly in the place where it goes and
[1:29:51] when this this light would cast across
[1:29:53] this to Supernatural light would strike
[1:29:55] this it would produce a rainbow right
[1:29:58] and this is how God built this in this
[1:30:01] specific order to do his commission
[1:30:03] right that they would have a way to know
[1:30:06] whether they were walking in the word
[1:30:07] they would have an exact way to know and
[1:30:10] a verification to check with that they
[1:30:12] were walking in the word now think about
[1:30:13] this Fred Jordan how long would you wait
[1:30:15] in line to have two minutes with the
[1:30:17] prophet
[1:30:19] as long as it took
[1:30:21] you'd have a list of questions you'd
[1:30:23] have but you know what before you got
[1:30:24] there you'd probably know the questions
[1:30:25] and he would tell us you just beat his
[1:30:27] presence and just say what what do you
[1:30:29] have for me what are you going to say to
[1:30:31] me
[1:30:32] you say I really need to know this one
[1:30:33] thing
[1:30:34] and I would think that if we really if
[1:30:36] we really chiseled down away everything
[1:30:38] all the life decisions through the
[1:30:40] marrying and who the this and that and
[1:30:42] what's going to happen to this one I
[1:30:43] think the one thing that we need to be
[1:30:44] sure of
[1:30:45] is do we have it yeah
[1:30:48] because once you have that
[1:30:50] you can walk on in faith
[1:30:52] once you're established that you have
[1:30:55] the seed within you you can walk on in
[1:30:57] faith for everything else so I would
[1:30:59] think that if we were going to lay
[1:31:00] before the prophet or we were going
[1:31:01] before the yerman thumb of there was one
[1:31:03] thing that we need to be sure of is that
[1:31:05] we have the seed of God within us that
[1:31:07] we have the Holy Ghost living within us
[1:31:09] and if we're sure of that that we can
[1:31:10] walk on and the rest of the promises
[1:31:12] because we already know they're for us
[1:31:14] right and if God before us who can be
[1:31:17] against us but we know where we're
[1:31:19] standing right we know where our
[1:31:20] confidence comes from now now I know
[1:31:22] this may be a little bit slower this
[1:31:23] morning but just bear with me
[1:31:26] so God designed it this way that they
[1:31:28] would have a way to check where they're
[1:31:29] at
[1:31:30] and he designed it so specifically
[1:31:33] everything had to be in perfect place we
[1:31:35] just read that out of Exodus right
[1:31:36] everything had to be just this way and
[1:31:37] the measurement was this and this was
[1:31:39] this and this and this and this and God
[1:31:40] has an exact order to how he creates
[1:31:43] things now this is his perfect way right
[1:31:46] now if we turn here uh to the book of
[1:31:50] Ezekiel
[1:31:52] the 28th chapter we'll find this same
[1:31:55] pattern again
[1:31:57] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:31:59] me saying son of man take up lamentation
[1:32:00] upon the king of Tyrus and say to him
[1:32:02] thus saith the Lord God thou sealest up
[1:32:05] the sum full of wisdom and perfect and
[1:32:06] Beauty now he's speaking of Lucifer here
[1:32:08] thou Hast Spin and Eden the Garden of
[1:32:10] God every precious stone was upon that
[1:32:13] covering the sardius topaz and the
[1:32:15] diamond the barrel the Onyx The Jasper
[1:32:16] the sapphire the emerald and the
[1:32:18] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[1:32:20] that Tavaris of that pipes was prepared
[1:32:22] in the in the day that was created
[1:32:26] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:32:28] covereth and I have set thee so thouest
[1:32:30] upon the holy mountain of God thou Hast
[1:32:32] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:32:33] stones of fire that was perfect in thy
[1:32:36] ways from the day that was created till
[1:32:38] iniquity was found indeed
[1:32:42] how many stones do we count in Exodus
[1:32:45] 12. how many stones did we count right
[1:32:47] there in Ezekiel
[1:32:49] sardius
[1:32:50] topaz somebody counting this
[1:32:53] diamond
[1:32:55] Barrel
[1:32:56] Onyx Jasper Sapphire Emerald carbuncle
[1:33:01] gold
[1:33:03] how many did you come up with
[1:33:10] nine
[1:33:12] sardius
[1:33:13] topaz Diamond Barrel Onyx Jasper
[1:33:17] Sapphire there's three rows of Three
[1:33:18] Stones there
[1:33:20] nine stones
[1:33:22] that's not the same I'm not good at math
[1:33:25] brother is that the same
[1:33:27] there's three missing right
[1:33:31] now why
[1:33:35] why can't Satan worship like you can
[1:33:37] worship
[1:33:39] why should we not be afraid of being an
[1:33:41] impersonator
[1:33:43] because he can't impersonate
[1:33:46] what we're doing
[1:33:47] he cannot impersonate the word he can
[1:33:51] impersonate the shouting the dancing the
[1:33:53] jumping the tongues the prophecies the
[1:33:55] the sermon he can he can all that
[1:33:58] but he can't impersonate the word
[1:34:03] why because he's missing something amen
[1:34:06] he's missing something that we have now
[1:34:08] we counted right I just showed you
[1:34:10] scripturally right are we good yeah 12 9
[1:34:12] 12 9 he's missing the third row if you
[1:34:16] go back and check it he's missing the
[1:34:18] third row of stones he does not have it
[1:34:20] you just read how God designed Lucifer
[1:34:23] he does not have the whole package he
[1:34:25] doesn't have all the stones that you
[1:34:27] have you are designed in such a way God
[1:34:29] built you in such a way that every stone
[1:34:31] is in his place and this Dimension is
[1:34:33] just right and he has all that just so
[1:34:36] close but he is incapable of matching
[1:34:39] you step for step that's why the prophet
[1:34:41] would tell us there are places you can
[1:34:43] go in this word that the devil can't
[1:34:45] follow you there's a place in Revelation
[1:34:48] there's a place in worship there's a
[1:34:50] place in the word that you can go that
[1:34:53] the devil cannot follow you he cannot go
[1:34:55] with you because he is not made the same
[1:34:58] way that you were made he does not
[1:35:02] you have he does not cast the same
[1:35:04] colors that you come that you cast
[1:35:06] you're made differently than he is he's
[1:35:09] not equipped to go where you can go
[1:35:12] it's time for us to step into a realm
[1:35:14] where the devil can't follow us are you
[1:35:16] tired of the devil beating you are you
[1:35:18] tired of the devil coming at you and
[1:35:20] hammering your mind and hammering your
[1:35:22] body and he's just over your day and
[1:35:24] night that it's time to go further into
[1:35:25] the word then he can go
[1:35:28] we are built to go places that he cannot
[1:35:31] follow us
[1:35:32] it depends on what vehicle we're in
[1:35:36] now we could go back to a horse and
[1:35:37] buggy and try to outrun him
[1:35:40] and he's going to catch up to us
[1:35:44] now in the horse and buggy age that was
[1:35:46] as fast as they could go
[1:35:48] right we're in an area we live in
[1:35:50] there's a lot of Amish folks and they
[1:35:51] ride horse and Buggies and that's just
[1:35:53] as fast as they go top speed of 12 miles
[1:35:55] an hour
[1:35:57] and that's as fast as they're able to go
[1:35:58] there's no there's no world outside them
[1:36:01] to go any faster
[1:36:04] and that was their age
[1:36:06] and Martin Luther went as fast as he
[1:36:08] could go
[1:36:09] in his age
[1:36:10] there was no other vehicle for him to
[1:36:13] get in to go faster that was just how as
[1:36:15] fast he could go
[1:36:18] and then we move into the automobile age
[1:36:20] and you get an old model T and they go
[1:36:23] about 35 miles an hour and that was so
[1:36:25] much faster than the horse and buggy and
[1:36:27] everybody was in the car and they were
[1:36:28] going faster than the next guy and that
[1:36:30] was a progression of the age and they
[1:36:32] got into another vehicle and they were
[1:36:34] able to go faster
[1:36:36] they will ever go further and then the
[1:36:38] car develops and the car develops right
[1:36:41] and then but pretty soon the car is
[1:36:42] going 100 miles an hour 200 miles an
[1:36:45] hour and it's going so much faster the
[1:36:47] horse and buggy just looks like a blower
[1:36:48] going by
[1:36:50] but both in the same age
[1:36:53] right but then comes the airplane
[1:36:55] and the airplane goes so much faster
[1:36:57] than the car goes and they get into that
[1:36:59] vehicle and they're able to go faster
[1:37:00] and higher and further and they could go
[1:37:02] around the world and you see the vehicle
[1:37:04] that they're in but the same age the car
[1:37:06] and the buggy are still in existence so
[1:37:09] you can choose to ride the buggy if you
[1:37:10] want to it's still in this age you can
[1:37:14] choose to drive a car and never get on a
[1:37:15] plane and it would take me 10 or 12
[1:37:17] hours to drive here but I can fly here
[1:37:19] in an hour all right it's my choice if I
[1:37:22] want to drive here in my car and take 10
[1:37:23] hours to drive here or I can get in
[1:37:25] another vehicle and I can go so much
[1:37:28] faster and I can go so much further but
[1:37:31] they're both in existence in the same
[1:37:33] age now now the car when there was no
[1:37:35] airplane left that was as fast as they
[1:37:36] could go
[1:37:38] he couldn't John Wesley couldn't go any
[1:37:40] further he can only get in the vehicle
[1:37:43] that was for his age but we live in
[1:37:46] another age where there's a choice to be
[1:37:48] made there's a choice of what vehicle
[1:37:51] you get in now you can stay in an
[1:37:53] airplane and you could be bound under
[1:37:54] the layers of the ozone but now we live
[1:37:58] in another age where there's a rocket in
[1:38:00] the H and you can choose to get into
[1:38:02] that vehicle and you could go so much
[1:38:04] faster and so much higher in a place
[1:38:07] where the airplane cannot reach where
[1:38:08] the car cannot reach where the buggy
[1:38:10] cannot reach but you've got to get into
[1:38:12] the right vehicle let me say that this
[1:38:15] message in this hour is the rocket of
[1:38:17] this age and if we get in this vehicle
[1:38:20] we can go places where the devil cannot
[1:38:23] follow us he cannot go there he doesn't
[1:38:25] have the fuel he doesn't have the option
[1:38:27] we can go higher than he can go because
[1:38:30] we are built different than he is built
[1:38:33] he's not built like we are we just read
[1:38:36] it in the scripture he doesn't have the
[1:38:38] same material you have but God Made You
[1:38:40] with the material takes to go all the
[1:38:43] way Hallelujah
[1:38:46] I don't think we should be singing I'm
[1:38:48] just barely gonna make it I think we
[1:38:49] should be singing all the way
[1:38:52] I'm going all the way that's our song
[1:38:56] because that is what we're here to do I
[1:38:58] don't know about you church but I am not
[1:39:00] settling for stopping short of
[1:39:02] perfection
[1:39:04] I get her settle to stop short of every
[1:39:06] word and promise that's in this book
[1:39:08] I'll take it and settle this for you do
[1:39:11] you see this Revelation do you see that
[1:39:14] the message came to you
[1:39:16] do you see there's going to be a Rapture

[1:39:19] see there's going to be a Rapture let me
[1:39:21] settle this it's for you
[1:39:25] for you

[1:39:36] right right okay God is not going to
[1:39:38] bring a supernatural Revelation to you

[1:39:59] God that answers do you see that he's a
[1:40:01] miracle working God do you see that he's
[1:40:03] still filling hearts and changing lives

[1:40:48] see that if you see it
[1:40:51] take the land
[1:40:53] taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:40:56] when Joshua sent two spies Moses sent to
[1:40:59] him Joshua sent two they came back and
[1:41:03] said the land is ours they came back and
[1:41:05] said we've already we've already
[1:41:07] overtaken it we've already he's so
[1:41:09] afraid of us he's cowering down in fear
[1:41:12] we don't even have to raise the sword
[1:41:13] we'll take Jericho without lifting one
[1:41:16] sword
[1:41:16] now whose report do you believe
[1:41:19] well the devil's Mighty and he's got a
[1:41:22] Punch coming and you better be careful

[1:41:31] able yeah there's enemies to defeat but
[1:41:34] what are we here to do you think we're
[1:41:35] just here to live out our 75 years we're
[1:41:37] here to fulfill a commission and why and
[1:41:40] walk into the word of God go somewhere
[1:41:42] in the word today that the devil cannot
[1:41:44] follow you go somewhere in a spiritual
[1:41:47] atmosphere you ever get when's the last
[1:41:48] time you were drunk in the spirit and
[1:41:50] you just felt like you were the only one
[1:41:51] in the room there was nobody else around
[1:41:53] it was just you and him it was just you
[1:41:55] and him and nobody else to see the devil
[1:41:57] wasn't in there the Devil Couldn't enter
[1:41:59] the holy of holy because you found
[1:42:01] yourself in the inner Tabernacle just
[1:42:04] you and the spirit of God just you and
[1:42:07] him and nobody was there to interrupt
[1:42:09] that or to disturb that and you could
[1:42:10] they they've drugged me out of places
[1:42:12] that no idea how I got to my bed nobody
[1:42:14] was there to disturb that just me and
[1:42:18] God when's the last time that happened
[1:42:20] for you
[1:42:22] yeah it's something you need to try
[1:42:24] right you know we were out in the world
[1:42:26] we wanted everybody to have a good time
[1:42:27] like we were having a good time here
[1:42:28] brother have them have the bottle here
[1:42:30] past the bottle we pass it around and
[1:42:32] here have some of this and every you
[1:42:33] wanted everybody to enjoy the way you
[1:42:35] were enjoying it well I think church is
[1:42:36] the same you want everybody to enjoying
[1:42:39] the blessings that you've enjoyed in
[1:42:41] your life I think it's time to pass the
[1:42:42] bottle around say hey have a good
[1:42:44] outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:42:46] life and it'll notify your face that's
[1:42:48] your raptured it'll notify you that
[1:42:50] you're being delivered it'll notify you
[1:42:52] that you've got a reason to shout and a
[1:42:54] reason to praise the image is speaking
[1:42:57] for itself we are the ones that are
[1:42:59] called to speak in this age why cry unto
[1:43:03] me speak
[1:43:05] why cry unto me lamentation speak
[1:43:08] and go forward and what is the direction
[1:43:09] of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:11] forward
[1:43:12] never backwards friends we're not
[1:43:15] interested in going back to Pentecost
[1:43:16] we're interested in going forward to
[1:43:18] Pentecost the original pattern of the
[1:43:21] church now don't take us back to Azusa
[1:43:23] Street but go forward
[1:43:25] into the blessing somewhere that Satan
[1:43:28] cannot go he's not built to go there
[1:43:32] he's not made to do that
[1:43:34] yeah you want to hear the prophet say it
[1:43:36] questions and answers now watch that
[1:43:39] pattern I'm taking a lot of time but
[1:43:40] look Judas Iscariot followed the same
[1:43:43] tracks
[1:43:45] he was justified by Believing on the
[1:43:47] Lord Jesus and then accepted him as his
[1:43:49] personal savior he was Sanctified and
[1:43:51] give power to cast out spirits
[1:43:56] but when it come to Pentecost
[1:44:02] amen
[1:44:04] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:06] the fullness
[1:44:08] of the word
[1:44:10] did I read that right the baptism of the
[1:44:13] Holy Ghost is the fullness of the word
[1:44:16] when it came time to Pentecost now we're
[1:44:18] moving Way Beyond the denomination don't
[1:44:20] get caught up on the denominational term
[1:44:21] that's a label
[1:44:25] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:44:27] fullness of the word he showed his
[1:44:30] colors
[1:44:31] that's exactly what the Canaan spies did
[1:44:33] exactly what Esau done they showed their
[1:44:37] colors
[1:44:39] if you take those three stones out of
[1:44:41] the breastplate and you cast a light
[1:44:43] upon it you know what you'll end up with
[1:44:45] a six-colored rainbow
[1:44:49] but if you put that third Stone Those
[1:44:51] third row in there
[1:44:52] you'll end up with a full rainbow
[1:44:55] he cannot
[1:44:57] Satan cannot impersonate you he cannot
[1:45:02] go where you can go why are we playing
[1:45:04] with him in a realm where he's able to
[1:45:06] access why are we going and hanging out
[1:45:09] in a place where he can go and he can
[1:45:10] pull on us and he can take us and he can
[1:45:13] affect our mind and he can battle us and
[1:45:15] he can give us this and he can give us
[1:45:17] this thought and this Affliction why are
[1:45:19] we dwelling in a place below where we
[1:45:21] can go
[1:45:24] well I'm tired of dealing with this with
[1:45:26] this person I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:45:27] gonna cut them out of my life
[1:45:31] and there comes a time when sometimes
[1:45:33] you just got to get around situations
[1:45:34] and just come out from influences in
[1:45:36] your life you're trying to do something
[1:45:38] for the Lord and this influence comes
[1:45:39] along and all of a sudden you feel like
[1:45:40] you're back down you got to cut
[1:45:42] influences out of your life you got to
[1:45:44] cut things out of your life and we're
[1:45:45] afraid to offend people all right
[1:45:49] I don't know brother we're afraid to
[1:45:52] offend people and we don't want to hurt
[1:45:54] their feelings we don't want to lose
[1:45:55] their friendship but yet we'll let the
[1:45:57] Lord stand in the corner with dirty feet
[1:45:59] we'll offend the Holy Ghost every moment
[1:46:01] of the day not to offend somebody else
[1:46:04] but more than that what even more of a
[1:46:06] disgrace is we're afraid to offend the
[1:46:08] devil and we won't take God in his word
[1:46:11] I say devil get behind me I've had
[1:46:13] enough of your lies I've had enough of
[1:46:16] your torment I've had enough I've had
[1:46:18] enough I'm moving on into the promises
[1:46:20] of God I am going somewhere that you
[1:46:23] cannot follow me I am going into a place
[1:46:25] in this word that he can't come he's not
[1:46:28] he's literally not built the same that
[1:46:30] you are he doesn't have it he can't go
[1:46:34] where you can go why stay down here when
[1:46:36] you can be up there
[1:46:38] remember the eagle in that story brother
[1:46:40] man would tell about the the eagle
[1:46:41] standing on the branch and those
[1:46:42] Chipmunks were just chatter chatter
[1:46:44] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:46:46] chatter chatter chatter
[1:46:48] and the Eagles sitting down there and
[1:46:49] brother bear looks the eagle he says why
[1:46:51] are you still here haven't you had
[1:46:52] enough of this
[1:46:54] he says almost like the eagle Cottage
[1:46:56] thought and he took one look and just
[1:46:58] one flap
[1:47:01] that chipmunk couldn't go
[1:47:04] where the eagle can go now the eagle has
[1:47:07] the choice to stay there
[1:47:09] or he has the choice to rise up now you
[1:47:12] have the choice to stay down here and
[1:47:13] listen to what the devil will tell you
[1:47:15] and tell you you're not good enough and
[1:47:16] tell you you're not gonna make it and
[1:47:18] tell you you're good for nothing and
[1:47:19] tell you it's for everybody but you and
[1:47:21] give you a million reasons why that this
[1:47:23] word is not for you you can choose to
[1:47:25] stay down there and battle with that or
[1:47:26] you can choose to use your god-given
[1:47:29] ability to rise above rise above every
[1:47:32] accusation he's not going to stop
[1:47:34] accusing you the accuser of the Brethren
[1:47:36] accuses day and night the only way to
[1:47:39] get away from it is to enter into the
[1:47:42] holy of holies where he cannot go he's
[1:47:45] not built to go into there he's not
[1:47:48] designed to go into there there's only
[1:47:50] one that's designed to go into there it
[1:47:52] is the bride in this hour she was built
[1:47:55] with every stone to go into there
[1:47:58] I think it's interesting if we look at
[1:47:59] this the stones that he's missing we'll
[1:48:01] try to get through this quickly
[1:48:08] the liger Stone was the first stone that
[1:48:10] he's missing on that third word I want
[1:48:11] to get into the you can go back and
[1:48:12] study it on your own time it's a good
[1:48:13] study
[1:48:15] comes from the tribe of God and it's an
[1:48:17] amber color
[1:48:20] God is a judge
[1:48:22] it means to be Vindicated
[1:48:25] he can't be Vindicated anybody ever
[1:48:28] taken the time to look up what
[1:48:29] Vindicated means it means to be loosed
[1:48:33] to be free
[1:48:35] Vindicated loosed overcoming power is
[1:48:38] what it means an overcoming power to be
[1:48:41] loosed
[1:48:45] the devil Works in ways that
[1:48:48] we're not always ready for
[1:48:50] he's Sly he's slick and he attacks us in
[1:48:53] ways we don't see coming
[1:48:55] and sometimes he'll put thoughts in our
[1:48:57] head
[1:48:58] and we wonder where they came from we
[1:48:59] think why did I think that well it's not
[1:49:01] your thought remember brother Brandon
[1:49:03] would be counseling that man he would
[1:49:04] have a thought and brother man would
[1:49:05] tell him you that wasn't for you it was
[1:49:07] for me
[1:49:08] the devil put that in your head because
[1:49:10] he knew I would see it that wasn't your
[1:49:12] thought that was the devil's thought so
[1:49:13] you see in that we see that the devil
[1:49:15] has access to your minds and he can
[1:49:16] plant a thought in there so you might be
[1:49:19] worrying even with this service today
[1:49:20] but those are not your thoughts because
[1:49:22] you're a child of God and your mind is
[1:49:24] fixed on the word right
[1:49:26] so if it's any other thought you know
[1:49:28] where it came from
[1:49:30] right and so the devil works like this
[1:49:31] and I you know sometimes he works in
[1:49:33] ways that we we don't we don't even see
[1:49:35] coming and we'll have a thought and
[1:49:36] we'll if we don't identify immediately
[1:49:38] where that thought came from it'll
[1:49:39] control our mind
[1:49:42] I'm just going to be real real with you
[1:49:43] for a second
[1:49:46] there was a time I was going through
[1:49:47] something in my life that I was I was
[1:49:50] ready to give up I was just done I
[1:49:51] actually we were on our way to church
[1:49:52] and I told my wife I said I'm I'm
[1:49:54] talking the pastor after service and I'm
[1:49:57] going to step out of the ministry and
[1:49:58] step down from being a deacon and just
[1:50:00] stop all this and I'm just gonna see
[1:50:02] what you know see where it goes but I'm
[1:50:04] just I'm just done I got so down
[1:50:08] and just so so down in the place that's
[1:50:10] why I know what I'm talking about when I
[1:50:12] preach that there's Freedom right
[1:50:16] go bound up in my own mind well this
[1:50:18] brother thinks this and this situation
[1:50:19] looks like this and this and this and
[1:50:21] this and this and this you begin to you
[1:50:22] begin to see all these things and then
[1:50:24] once the next movie comes in and begins
[1:50:26] to make you doubt your belief right I
[1:50:28] think well you know maybe there's you
[1:50:29] know
[1:50:31] against the Whittle away at that see if
[1:50:33] you don't identify where the thought
[1:50:35] comes from you'll give it power
[1:50:39] and I literally showed up to the service
[1:50:40] that night with every intention
[1:50:42] of resigning and I sat in the front row
[1:50:44] like I was sitting right here
[1:50:46] and I'm a pretty excited guy when I'm
[1:50:48] when church was going on I'm ready to
[1:50:49] have a good time when I'm playing
[1:50:50] volleyball I'm having a good time when
[1:50:52] I'm in church I'm having a good time
[1:50:54] but this service I was literally sitting
[1:50:56] on my hands
[1:50:58] I didn't want to say Amen
[1:51:00] I wasn't going to give the satisfaction
[1:51:02] of that preacher to say amen I wasn't I
[1:51:04] was done and I knew that if I engaged in
[1:51:06] the service there might be Freedom there
[1:51:09] but I didn't want to be free yeah yeah I
[1:51:11] didn't want it I wanted to live in my
[1:51:14] own my own uh depression
[1:51:16] and I just sat on my hands for the while
[1:51:19] I physically sat on my hands oh this is
[1:51:21] okay but yeah
[1:51:24] and he started preaching
[1:51:26] you know what he turned to Psalms 27.
[1:51:29] you begin to to preach on my desire is
[1:51:33] to seek thy face
[1:51:34] I thought this guy's trying to get me
[1:51:39] it was a Thursday night it wasn't even a
[1:51:41] Sunday morning just the Thursday night
[1:51:42] it was sitting there and
[1:51:44] he probably preached 45-50 minutes
[1:51:48] and I I sat on my hands I wouldn't say
[1:51:50] Amen I'm just everybody next to me hey
[1:51:52] man hey man and I I can tell and people
[1:51:54] were thinking like what's wrong with him
[1:51:55] and I was like I don't care
[1:51:58] I'm mad and I want everybody to know it
[1:52:04] but where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:52:06] there's liberty even when you want it
[1:52:10] when you're in where the spirit of the
[1:52:12] Lord is there is liberty and he began to
[1:52:15] labor in that I remember he said please
[1:52:16] stand and I didn't even stand up I just
[1:52:19] sat there in my hands I could feel just
[1:52:20] the Lord dealing with my heart and just
[1:52:21] I mean and I've you know I've been I I
[1:52:24] believe I got the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:52:25] as a young man maybe in 2021 and I this
[1:52:28] was way down the road this wasn't just
[1:52:30] maybe five years ago that this was going
[1:52:31] on and and and I thought well I know
[1:52:33] I've had an experience with the Lord but
[1:52:35] and he began to woo me just like he did
[1:52:36] on that first day
[1:52:38] and it was the same atmosphere in the
[1:52:41] same anointing and I thought no I'm not
[1:52:43] going to do it I'm not gonna do it
[1:52:46] but you know what happened brother
[1:52:49] something inside me took over that I had
[1:52:51] no control over right
[1:52:54] no control over and it was like a flood
[1:52:57] of Life came back to where there was
[1:52:59] dead spots it was like a flood of Life
[1:53:01] came back where there was limbs that
[1:53:03] were dead and useless and they had no
[1:53:05] flow of life and then but all of a
[1:53:06] sudden to begin and you know why because
[1:53:07] the devil works like this brother random
[1:53:09] describes him as a transparent band that
[1:53:13] gets around now if I if I put a if I put
[1:53:15] a band a zip tie around my hand and I
[1:53:17] put that real tight this this hand is
[1:53:19] going to go numb right
[1:53:21] it's going to turn purple it's going to
[1:53:23] turn useless I'm not going to be able to
[1:53:24] use it for nothing it's just going to
[1:53:25] hurt it's just going to be a dead limb
[1:53:27] right and brother Bram says that that's
[1:53:28] the way a spirit of unbelief works is it
[1:53:31] gets into your mind and it's a
[1:53:32] transparent band that binds your flow of
[1:53:35] faith and if you don't remove it then
[1:53:37] it's cutting off the circulation of life
[1:53:39] to your faith but in the presence of the
[1:53:41] Lord it breaks those bands in the
[1:53:44] presence of the Lord it breaks the band
[1:53:46] that would bind your unbelief right now
[1:53:48] this this this stone that that that that
[1:53:51] the lager Stone
[1:53:53] is only is only a value
[1:53:56] in one condition you know how they find
[1:53:58] out that it's a real lager
[1:54:01] they hold it over a fire
[1:54:04] and that's the only way you can tell
[1:54:06] that it's a real Liga Stone by this by
[1:54:07] the light that shines through the stone
[1:54:09] but it has to be held
[1:54:12] over the fire and through the fire the
[1:54:15] value of the Stone comes out through the
[1:54:17] fire the value of what's on the inside
[1:54:19] of that Stone comes out through the fire
[1:54:21] is where you're really made to be who
[1:54:23] you are and the fire is really when the
[1:54:26] real you comes out but you know what
[1:54:27] brother Brown said when those three
[1:54:29] Hebrew children went into the fiery
[1:54:30] furnace it killed their the mightiest
[1:54:33] men he sat with him this is how stupid
[1:54:34] the devil is I'm sorry but he's just
[1:54:37] dumb he's just dumb he says send these
[1:54:39] three Hebrew children and send my
[1:54:40] mightiest men with them
[1:54:42] they're not built to go where you can go
[1:54:47] Satan's mightiest men are not built to
[1:54:49] step where you are built to step Satan's
[1:54:52] mightiest demon 200 000 000 Horsemen are
[1:54:55] not built to go where you can go you are
[1:54:59] built to go into another realm you are
[1:55:00] built to go into a higher plane and as
[1:55:03] they begin to step into that fiery
[1:55:04] furnace turn it seven times hotter where
[1:55:06] are we at friends we're in a seven times
[1:55:08] hotter age they are not built to keep up
[1:55:11] with us it's time that we recognize who
[1:55:13] we are and the commission that we've
[1:55:15] been given to go beyond where they can
[1:55:17] go and as they stepped into that fiery
[1:55:19] furnace the devil's mightiest men were
[1:55:22] burnt
[1:55:23] in an instant because of how hot that
[1:55:26] fire was
[1:55:27] yeah oh but the children of Israel were
[1:55:28] burnt were built
[1:55:30] to step on that it's in the fire that
[1:55:33] the value of the Stone comes out and as
[1:55:36] they walk into the fire and they're
[1:55:37] still there and they're still there and
[1:55:40] they're still there but who's that
[1:55:41] Fourth Man In The Fire where are we at
[1:55:43] friends we're no longer in this age of
[1:55:46] of an airplane or a car or a horse and
[1:55:49] buggy we are in the fourth flight of
[1:55:51] this age we are in the coming of Christ
[1:55:53] the bride age is on the rocket age the
[1:55:56] Golden Age The Eagle age whatever you
[1:55:58] want to call it I call it my age and my
[1:56:01] age is here to go beyond where other
[1:56:03] people have gone because there's a
[1:56:05] fourth man with us
[1:56:07] and you know what brother bam said
[1:56:10] all that that fire did for those Hebrew
[1:56:12] children it didn't make them smell like
[1:56:13] smoke
[1:56:14] it didn't make them it didn't cast their
[1:56:16] hair on fire it didn't sing their
[1:56:18] fingers it didn't sing their feet you
[1:56:19] know what he said it broke the band
[1:56:24] broke the band now you might be fighting
[1:56:26] with a transparent band of unbelief and
[1:56:28] you don't know how to get it off yet in
[1:56:30] the fire get in the fire of God and all
[1:56:33] that fire will do for you is loose your
[1:56:35] band oh
[1:56:43] us life to come back into you break the
[1:56:46] band off and remember what it was like
[1:56:48] to have to have fire in your hands
[1:56:50] remember what it was like to happen the
[1:56:52] blood flowing through your body but the
[1:56:54] value of it only comes when it's put in
[1:56:57] the fire so thinking not odd that we go
[1:56:59] through these fiery trials but they are
[1:57:01] of the Lord to give us the value that's
[1:57:03] within us right we're still speaking of
[1:57:06] the Masterpiece but God sees the image
[1:57:08] of what he's trying to get out
[1:57:10] he sees what he's trying to bring out
[1:57:15] and he will not settle until he gets to
[1:57:17] perfection
[1:57:19] prophet of God said that God has a
[1:57:22] perfect picture of you
[1:57:24] right yes
[1:57:27] I used to think Jordan I need to be in
[1:57:28] shape when I'm 19 or 20. because that's
[1:57:31] where I'm going to come you know that's
[1:57:32] that's gonna be my body for eternity
[1:57:36] but a lot of us had scars
[1:57:38] by the time we were 19 or 20.
[1:57:40] a lot of Us carry things that we didn't
[1:57:42] we didn't want in our body
[1:57:45] well I got a tattoo when I was 14 does
[1:57:47] that mean I'm gonna have it over there
[1:57:48] because I'm 19 year old body
[1:57:49] that's not the perfect picture of you he
[1:57:52] took right
[1:57:53] the picture of you he took was in the
[1:57:55] back part of his mind
[1:57:57] before the foundations
[1:58:00] and that picture of you is the one he's
[1:58:02] looking at now he's the artist and he's
[1:58:04] comparing the picture
[1:58:08] a little more fire
[1:58:11] a little more trial uh there's still a
[1:58:14] little bit too much of them there right
[1:58:15] there's still a little bit too much of
[1:58:17] this Fallen nature there
[1:58:19] I see the picture yeah
[1:58:22] and he's looking at the bride picture
[1:58:24] she's almost ready yeah
[1:58:26] she's almost ready I see a perfect
[1:58:28] picture of her
[1:58:30] somebody graffitied a little spot there
[1:58:32] washed that off I see a perfect picture
[1:58:36] his picture is oil based it's not just
[1:58:39] washed off it's not just wiped away but
[1:58:43] it's there by oil
[1:58:44] and he sees this perfect picture of you
[1:58:47] and he's the developer
[1:58:50] how many knows what a dark room is
[1:58:52] right
[1:58:54] and he takes this I'm not a photographer
[1:58:56] again but I just know a little bit about
[1:58:57] it and they go into this dark room now
[1:59:00] in the old days they took this camera
[1:59:01] this picture they'd have this big Hood
[1:59:03] over them and they'd have a light bulb
[1:59:04] and it would flash
[1:59:06] and it would capture the image
[1:59:08] yeah it would it would strike that image
[1:59:10] the light would strike this
[1:59:12] magnetic film right
[1:59:16] well the one who took the picture is the
[1:59:18] only one who knows what it looks like
[1:59:21] yeah you were having your arm around
[1:59:22] somebody else and maybe this guy had his
[1:59:24] hands behind you or maybe you weren't
[1:59:26] smiling or maybe you were blinking but
[1:59:27] the one who took the picture we have a
[1:59:29] couple of photographers in the church
[1:59:30] and we're good friends until it's family
[1:59:31] picture time and then don't do this
[1:59:34] don't do that take your hand in your
[1:59:35] pocket do this smile
[1:59:37] but she's the one who sees what the
[1:59:39] picture looks like
[1:59:42] and all the while he knows what the
[1:59:44] picture's supposed to look like
[1:59:46] he's the one who took it
[1:59:48] yeah but it's got to go through the
[1:59:49] development stage
[1:59:51] and he takes it into this I believe
[1:59:53] correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
[1:59:54] there's three major chemicals
[1:59:58] that you use in a dark room I remember
[2:00:00] the names right now but there's one tub
[2:00:02] of liquid and there's another tub of
[2:00:03] liquid there's another tub of liquid
[2:00:05] right well in this dark room there's no
[2:00:08] light allowed except for a red light
[2:00:11] right am I right so this picture the
[2:00:14] only thing that sees this picture is
[2:00:16] through the lens
[2:00:17] of this red light
[2:00:19] and then the developers looking at this
[2:00:21] picture and he's holding it up to this
[2:00:22] red light
[2:00:23] and the only way he sees it is through
[2:00:25] that red light contrasting through the
[2:00:27] picture right and he takes it in the
[2:00:30] first tank and he takes it through
[2:00:31] justification and he's rinsing it out
[2:00:34] and he's holding it to the blood and
[2:00:35] he's holding it up there looking at that
[2:00:37] lens and he's taking it no a little more
[2:00:39] justification and he's developing the
[2:00:41] picture that he sees
[2:00:42] because he knows it's in there yeah and
[2:00:44] he takes it to the nest tank and he's
[2:00:46] sanctification he's going to rinse it
[2:00:47] out in sanctification and he's holding
[2:00:49] it up to the blood out
[2:00:52] yeah
[2:00:53] he's the developer
[2:00:56] he knows what the picture looks like
[2:00:58] yeah
[2:01:00] he knows the potential that's within you
[2:01:02] that's right he knows that all this all
[2:01:05] what needs to be wiped away and there's
[2:01:07] false light in this slide and different
[2:01:09] images and everything on this image and
[2:01:11] he's going to wash it until it becomes a
[2:01:13] clear picture you know the last thing
[2:01:15] that they take it in it's called the
[2:01:17] sealer
[2:01:20] no photographer puts that photo in the
[2:01:22] sealer until the first two stages are
[2:01:24] complete and then when the first two
[2:01:26] stages they hold it up and it looks like
[2:01:28] just like the picture they put it in the
[2:01:30] sealer
[2:01:31] and they sealed that photo and it
[2:01:33] hardens and it becomes and then you can
[2:01:35] turn the light on and then you can look
[2:01:36] at it because it's the manifestation of
[2:01:38] what was taken on that camera many years
[2:01:41] ago and some some pictures are just
[2:01:43] coming to development some some people
[2:01:45] are at different stages of this
[2:01:46] development but we're all developed into
[2:01:48] the perfect picture of Christ do we
[2:01:51] trust him enough to let him develop our
[2:01:52] picture do we trust him enough to let
[2:01:54] him have his way in our life that he
[2:01:56] could do what he pleases to get the full
[2:01:59] value of what's inside of us I believe
[2:02:01] he knows us better than we know
[2:02:02] ourselves I believe he knows what's
[2:02:05] inside of us because the blood is
[2:02:06] telling him what the image looks like
[2:02:08] right the blood is speaking better
[2:02:11] things over you than you realize it if
[2:02:14] you were to tell your own testimony if
[2:02:16] you were to have the own word of your
[2:02:17] testimony you would say I'm defeated I'm
[2:02:19] down I've made mistakes I'm I'm in a
[2:02:21] dark place I don't know where to go and
[2:02:23] you begin to tell your own testimony but
[2:02:24] thank God we're not the ones telling our
[2:02:26] testimony the blood speaketh better
[2:02:29] things
[2:02:32] the blood speaks better things
[2:02:34] I think we should let the blood speak
[2:02:35] for us let the blood speak over us the
[2:02:38] image will speak the blood yeah the
[2:02:42] blood
[2:02:43] brother man would have an interview as
[2:02:45] we try to close here
[2:02:46] brother bam would try to have an
[2:02:48] interview with his sister Bruce right
[2:02:49] before he goes out to preach the message
[2:02:51] the masterpiece
[2:02:52] it's called private interview it's about
[2:02:53] seven minutes long you should go listen
[2:02:55] to it sometime especially a young person
[2:02:57] battling with whether they have the Holy
[2:02:58] Ghost or not
[2:03:01] and this sister is a good saintly sister
[2:03:03] and she's she's there gotta got just a
[2:03:05] few minutes with the prophet and what's
[2:03:07] her question
[2:03:08] do I have it
[2:03:09] yeah
[2:03:10] and you say sister you're a good sister
[2:03:12] I've known you I've watched over your
[2:03:14] life I've seen I've seen you I I've
[2:03:16] watched you under vision
[2:03:18] and I don't see anything in your life
[2:03:20] that would hinder you
[2:03:22] from the Holy Ghost
[2:03:24] now he's saying I can't tell you you
[2:03:25] have it it's got to be a revelation yeah
[2:03:27] but what he is telling her is I don't
[2:03:29] see anything in your life that would
[2:03:31] hinder you from having it
[2:03:33] he said I've watched over your life I've
[2:03:35] watched everything now what would that
[2:03:36] mean to us
[2:03:40] my just to have that word of
[2:03:41] encouragement yeah the prophet to come
[2:03:43] down to you and talk to you and say I I
[2:03:45] don't see anything in your life you're
[2:03:46] you're walking on in total Victory I see
[2:03:48] you there and what a consolation that
[2:03:50] would be
[2:03:51] but you know what she does
[2:03:53] the same thing we would do without a
[2:03:55] revelation
[2:03:56] he says but
[2:03:57] but you don't know all the mistakes I
[2:04:00] make
[2:04:03] you don't know how the mind battles I
[2:04:05] have you don't know how I failed him you
[2:04:07] don't know how I've questioned him you
[2:04:09] don't know how I've wondered you don't
[2:04:10] know and he's saying sister I'm looking
[2:04:12] into your life and I don't see anything
[2:04:14] and she says
[2:04:17] now he said now sister
[2:04:20] I'm about to lay my hands on you
[2:04:22] and I'm unworthy to do that but under
[2:04:26] the blood of Christ it speaks better
[2:04:28] things over us than even how we feel or
[2:04:31] what we see he said now I'm going to lay
[2:04:33] my hands on you because I am not a
[2:04:35] sinner under this blood and neither are
[2:04:37] you
[2:04:40] just take out sister Bruce's name and
[2:04:43] put your name right there under this
[2:04:45] Blood I am not a sinner and neither are
[2:04:47] you I am not a hypocrite and neither are
[2:04:50] you I am not a make-believer and neither
[2:04:52] are you but under this Blood I am a
[2:04:54] blood-bought son and daughter of God and
[2:04:57] I have rights to enter into every
[2:04:59] commission that the Lord has given me I
[2:05:01] say let the blood speak better things
[2:05:03] over your life than even you would say
[2:05:05] the blood will speak greater words than
[2:05:07] your mama would say the blood will speak
[2:05:09] greater words and you would like to
[2:05:10] imagine about yourself let the blood
[2:05:12] speak for you the blood has a voice in
[2:05:16] this age let us speak the blood is just
[2:05:19] as powerful as age I say let it speak
[2:05:21] let it come forth in power let it speak
[2:05:26] the worshiper once purged
[2:05:28] but under this Blood
[2:05:31] oh my we've got a reason to sing under
[2:05:34] this Blood these Egyptians that you see
[2:05:36] today you will see no more forever right
[2:05:40] why because you're under the blood if
[2:05:44] you're looking for me and you can't find
[2:05:45] me it's cause I'm under the blood the
[2:05:47] devil's out there like a roaring lion
[2:05:49] he's looking and he's looking to see
[2:05:50] whom he can devour and guess what he
[2:05:52] doesn't see you he can't see you he
[2:05:55] can't see you why because you're under
[2:05:57] the blood and he's looking and he's
[2:05:59] looking and he's looking who can he
[2:06:00] devour he can't see you you're under the
[2:06:03] blood I'm already under the blood but
[2:06:06] you know what Joshua would have left
[2:06:07] that bucket in there and he'd left that
[2:06:09] hospital that simple Faith right there
[2:06:11] the death angel would have come in his
[2:06:13] house and taken his life yeah but the
[2:06:15] blood had to be applied and he took that
[2:06:18] hospital out of the bucket he walked
[2:06:19] outside I imagine he started painting in
[2:06:21] that doorpost and have the perfect miter
[2:06:24] joints it was just an old doorpost and
[2:06:26] he began to paint it and began to paint
[2:06:28] it red I think we need to paint it red
[2:06:32] they stole our car phrase paint the town
[2:06:34] red I think we need to paint the town
[2:06:36] red again paint the church red again use
[2:06:39] the blood and apply it over your life
[2:06:41] paint this town red again paint this
[2:06:43] hard red again let the blood be applied
[2:06:46] stop coming to church with condemnation
[2:06:48] on you feeling like you're never gonna
[2:06:50] make it let the blood speak over you
[2:06:53] these Egyptians you see today you will
[2:06:56] see no more forever
[2:07:00] and what happened
[2:07:02] oh well Glory that's a good thought
[2:07:05] oh no you see you weren't there
[2:07:09] when the task Masters whipped them
[2:07:12] when the taskmasters kicked him and had
[2:07:15] whips and had and killed their friends
[2:07:16] and threw their bodies over here and
[2:07:18] threw them over there and you see in
[2:07:19] that moment
[2:07:20] every Glory every accuser yeah
[2:07:26] yeah everyone who had dirt on them
[2:07:29] that some fear that a sin would come
[2:07:31] back to haunt them everyone that knew
[2:07:34] that about them they watched be
[2:07:36] destroyed Under the Red Sea they watched
[2:07:39] The Blood come and destroy every
[2:07:40] accusation every enemy that they had
[2:07:43] they knew why they were shouting they
[2:07:46] knew why they were worshiping because
[2:07:48] every accusation that had come against
[2:07:50] him had been cast into the sea have been
[2:07:53] cast into the blood and the and that
[2:07:55] blood speaks something over the church
[2:07:57] that Satan will never hear these words
[2:07:59] he will never I want him to hear this
[2:08:01] because he'll never hear it to him it is
[2:08:04] for the bride and the bride alone you
[2:08:07] never did it in the first place you are
[2:08:10] the sinless Spotless virtuous bride of
[2:08:12] Jesus Christ and you never sinned to
[2:08:15] begin with it was not you in the first
[2:08:18] place let the blood speak better things
[2:08:20] over your life I think it's time we
[2:08:23] listen to the blood
[2:08:24] take the simple faith and apply it over
[2:08:26] your life and say I claim the blood and
[2:08:29] Jesus shed on Calvary those blood stays
[2:08:32] were made there just for me I never did
[2:08:35] it in the first place it wasn't me I'm
[2:08:39] not guilty I'm free I'm free they knew
[2:08:44] what they were shouting about
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:47] they knew they had been given Liberty
[2:08:52] oh and you know what they weren't
[2:08:53] allowed to do in Egypt they weren't
[2:08:55] allowed to play their tambourines
[2:08:58] that's right so the first thing they did
[2:09:02] Miriam grabbed her tambourine said we're
[2:09:04] not in Egypt anymore we're not under the
[2:09:07] bondage of this one or that one anymore
[2:09:09] we're not under the label of this or
[2:09:11] that anymore we're free we're free now
[2:09:14] think about this there was two million
[2:09:16] people that came out of there right so
[2:09:17] if you just take it down to to adult
[2:09:20] aged women probably 200 000 250 000 out
[2:09:24] of 2 million a quarter of them how loud
[2:09:26] was that shout 250
[2:09:30] 000 women that have just been liberated
[2:09:32] from the bondage of condemnation the
[2:09:34] bondage of slavery the bondage of having
[2:09:36] to lose their firstborn or having to be
[2:09:38] told to do or what to do or can you
[2:09:40] imagine the shout
[2:09:42] [Applause]
[2:09:45] how loud it echoed all the way back to
[2:09:48] Egypt and Egypt knew that their army had
[2:09:50] been defeated by the shout of the king
[2:09:52] in the camp I think it's time we let the
[2:09:54] devil know who's on The Winning Side we
[2:09:58] are not defeated but I want him to hear
[2:10:00] it all the way down in hell where he
[2:10:01] came from we are not defeated but the
[2:10:05] shout of the King has returned to the
[2:10:07] camp we know why we're worshiping we
[2:10:10] know why we're praising we've been in
[2:10:12] Liberty in the house of God to worship
[2:10:14] and to praise and to give him glory it's
[2:10:17] our commission
[2:10:18] praise the Lord
[2:10:21] oh my God
[2:10:23] think about this friends now it's not
[2:10:25] just the women
[2:10:27] but now every son and daughter of God
[2:10:29] has been given the same promise these
[2:10:33] fearful spirits
[2:10:35] that you see today
[2:10:38] you will see them no more Forever
[2:10:40] Friends Our God's not lost power

[2:11:40] through Thursday it was just in the
[2:11:41] middle of the week
[2:11:42] so he came to came to church first time
[2:11:44] in years
[2:11:45] sat in the back row
[2:11:48] brother preached had a good service
[2:11:51] the next night he comes he's sitting in
[2:11:53] the middle
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:57] third night he comes sitting in the
[2:11:59] front row right there in that chair
[2:12:02] and the spirit of God began to move in
[2:12:04] that building
[2:12:05] and the pastor came down and he said he
[2:12:07] said I want to at the end of the service
[2:12:09] the Sun to the under the inspiration
[2:12:11] I've felt just somebody just needed to
[2:12:13] give their heart to the Lord I said
[2:12:14] somebody here needs to give it over to
[2:12:16] the Lord
[2:12:17] and the bass player was behind me and he
[2:12:20] stood up he said it's me it's me I'm the
[2:12:22] one I'm the one he's after I'm on me I
[2:12:24] need to give my heart to the Lord he ran
[2:12:25] to the Altar and started pouring his
[2:12:27] heart out to the Lord and after that
[2:12:29] just a just a Miracles started taking
[2:12:31] place in that place
[2:12:33] and after after just a uh maybe an hour
[2:12:36] of this taking place the pastor came
[2:12:38] down and he got in the in the line he
[2:12:39] said I want to claim my children
[2:12:41] he said I've got eight children and
[2:12:43] under this anointing and this power
[2:12:45] that's in this room I believe that God
[2:12:47] will hear our prayer and he said I've
[2:12:49] got eight but I want to claim my oldest
[2:12:50] because he's the furthest God he's the
[2:12:53] one that needs the most help and we
[2:12:54] called all his children by name and we
[2:12:56] began to pray over them now how do you
[2:12:58] get to see back you got to fly there
[2:13:00] right yeah there's a village about 800
[2:13:02] people
[2:13:03] not more than that maybe 850 people the
[2:13:07] only way in is a is one flight a day
[2:13:09] that comes in
[2:13:10] so you don't just get there
[2:13:12] don't just show up there it's not on the
[2:13:15] way anywhere there's no Road
[2:13:18] I don't know how God did it
[2:13:20] but I'm a witness that he did it
[2:13:22] not 15 minutes after we prayed for that
[2:13:25] for that pastor's boy he walks in the
[2:13:27] back door
[2:13:29] I don't know where he came from
[2:13:31] he was red-faced he was drunk he was
[2:13:33] upset he comes in the back door and he
[2:13:34] leans up against the wall the back wall
[2:13:36] of the church
[2:13:37] and we I'm kind of looking at him you
[2:13:39] know wondering and I don't know who he
[2:13:40] is I've never seen him before and he
[2:13:41] just leans up and he starts raising his
[2:13:43] hand and singing the songs we're singing
[2:13:44] he begins to come out of his
[2:13:47] and begins to worship and about that
[2:13:49] time the pastor's wife just recognizes
[2:13:51] what's going on and begins to just take
[2:13:53] a Jericho march on her own around the
[2:13:54] church and began to scream begin to
[2:13:56] shake her tambourine why because she
[2:13:58] knew that God had moved in 15 minutes of
[2:14:01] prayer that she'd been praying for years
[2:14:02] and years and years and years but in 15
[2:14:05] minutes God caused that boy to walk in
[2:14:07] the back door and to come into the house
[2:14:09] of God
[2:14:11] and while that was going on this brother
[2:14:13] sitting in this chair that I left the
[2:14:14] message he comes running to the front he
[2:14:16] says I see it I left Christ I have left
[2:14:19] Christ when I left the message I want to
[2:14:21] come back I want to come back into the
[2:14:22] fold I want to recognize Christ again I
[2:14:24] want to recognize all the power my life
[2:14:26] is gone I have no Liberty I have no
[2:14:29] freedom but I see that it's underneath
[2:14:31] this message and improve the repentant
[2:14:32] heart he comes back into the fold
[2:14:36] that was four years ago
[2:14:39] and I've told this testimony I've told
[2:14:41] this story and all the while the devil
[2:14:42] attacking me and saying well you don't
[2:14:43] even know if that brother's still in
[2:14:44] church
[2:14:45] well I just went there a few weeks ago
[2:14:48] and that brother is playing the guitar
[2:14:51] leading songs back in the house of God
[2:14:53] has never left since that day has been
[2:14:56] back in the folds since that day and you
[2:14:59] think what is too hard for God nothing
[2:15:00] is too hard for God well then I looked
[2:15:03] around the congregation and there was
[2:15:05] the boy I'd even recognize it because it
[2:15:06] looks like a whole different person not
[2:15:08] under drugs and alcohol but sitting in
[2:15:10] the Church of God is their oldest boy
[2:15:11] still serving the lord you see when God
[2:15:14] moves on the scene it's real it's not
[2:15:17] psychology it's not a workup but when
[2:15:20] God moves on behalf of
[2:15:22] faith of a child of God it's real the
[2:15:25] days of Miracles are not passed but it's
[2:15:28] right now they this is what we believe
[2:15:31] for
[2:15:33] what else are we here for this morning
[2:15:35] but to trust in him I believe is the
[2:15:38] same yesterday today and forever and yes
[2:15:42] that still excites me you might think
[2:15:44] I'm simple or juvenile by saying well
[2:15:46] you just said that but I I know what it
[2:15:48] means I know that Jesus Christ the same
[2:15:50] yesterday today and forever means he's
[2:15:53] obligated to fulfill every promise in
[2:15:55] his word the same way he did it for them
[2:15:57] he will also do it for you
[2:16:00] he's obligated in his word
[2:16:02] the way the blood spoke for them the
[2:16:05] blood will speak for you
[2:16:08] he's alive friends
[2:16:10] the music players would come
[2:16:12] he's the same
[2:16:15] in every way
[2:16:17] that he was then
[2:16:20] we had a situation at the church
[2:16:23] a brother
[2:16:26] got real sick during covet we didn't
[2:16:28] know if it was long coven we didn't know
[2:16:29] what it was but he just began to just
[2:16:30] melt away just his body began to
[2:16:33] deteriorate and deteriorate
[2:16:36] turned yellow just lost probably 100
[2:16:38] pounds
[2:16:39] just looked looked like death barely
[2:16:42] coming to churches because he didn't
[2:16:43] have the strength and we were all
[2:16:45] praying for him and pleading the blood
[2:16:46] over him and
[2:16:48] there was a service that happened in our
[2:16:50] church our pastor was preaching
[2:16:53] and the anointing of God came in that
[2:16:54] building
[2:16:58] there was there was people there in that
[2:16:59] service that had been born in the
[2:17:01] message 30 something years they've been
[2:17:02] coming to church and received the Holy
[2:17:04] Ghost in that service for the first time
[2:17:07] he's not giving up on that
[2:17:09] he's not gotten too Mighty where he's
[2:17:11] not still filling with his spirit I fear
[2:17:13] that many churches have gone back to
[2:17:15] trinitarianism
[2:17:21] it's the same it's the actual spirit of
[2:17:24] God why would we not want it in the
[2:17:26] church why would we not wanted to
[2:17:28] dictate our service and to move on our
[2:17:29] behalf and to control our worship and to
[2:17:32] be in our praise why would we I say we
[2:17:34] welcome the Holy Ghost
[2:17:35] I say we bring it in we invited and we
[2:17:37] say Lord I worship you I'll wash your
[2:17:40] feet I want the Holy Ghost to live in my
[2:17:42] life I want your presence to come it's
[2:17:44] abide in my soul I want the power
[2:17:47] restored that was once given I don't
[2:17:49] care what they label me I don't care
[2:17:51] what they call me I want the Holy Ghost
[2:17:54] to come
[2:17:55] yeah and while the spirit of God is
[2:17:57] moving in this service we're just moving
[2:17:59] to the ocean I think probably an hour
[2:18:01] and a half of prayer went on
[2:18:03] we're about to close it up in a voice
[2:18:05] told me brother one a voice put in my
[2:18:07] ear and it said don't forget Brother
[2:18:09] Andy he's the one who was sick and just
[2:18:11] melting away and just withering and he
[2:18:14] hadn't been in church in a while and I
[2:18:15] just happened to look back and he was
[2:18:16] sitting in the back row
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:20] and so I leaned over the pastor I said
[2:18:22] do you have one do you have strength for
[2:18:23] one more
[2:18:24] said yeah I said Brother Andy he said
[2:18:27] bring him I said no we need to go to him
[2:18:29] and friends I've been I've been in
[2:18:31] church my whole life and I know the
[2:18:32] anointing is Sovereign it moves how it
[2:18:34] wants to move and most of the time you
[2:18:36] got to come to get under the anointing
[2:18:37] but this occasion the anointing was so
[2:18:39] powerful we began to walk down the Pew
[2:18:42] all the way to the back and that
[2:18:43] anointing just built and built and built
[2:18:46] and people I'm not making this up but
[2:18:47] people were literally passing out under
[2:18:49] the anointing walking down that aisle we
[2:18:51] found ourselves walking back here
[2:18:52] sitting right about where you are
[2:18:53] brother and and we just began to pray
[2:18:55] over him and it was one of those
[2:18:56] Sovereign anointings where I couldn't
[2:18:57] even get words to come out we just began
[2:18:59] to pray over him in tongues and
[2:19:00] supplication is not even having the
[2:19:02] words and and our pastor began to pray
[2:19:04] and he said if there be anything in your
[2:19:07] life that would hinder you from a
[2:19:08] perfect healing may it be forgiven let
[2:19:10] the blood just speak over it and let our
[2:19:12] brother be healed and he began to just
[2:19:13] pray over him and this brother's been in
[2:19:14] churches his whole life seemingly
[2:19:17] but there was such an anointing that in
[2:19:19] the same Pew down the row
[2:19:21] one of his daughters had a blood issue
[2:19:23] was scheduled for a full surgery the
[2:19:25] next week and under that anointing
[2:19:27] without even having hands splayed on her
[2:19:29] she was healed and that instant by that
[2:19:31] anointing that was in that room healed
[2:19:33] of a blood issue she had for six years
[2:19:35] she was healed right there
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:39] why wouldn't we want the power of the
[2:19:41] Holy Ghost in our church
[2:19:46] [Music]
[2:19:48] that's gonna physically heal me but I
[2:19:50] know something changed on the inside of
[2:19:52] me I'm not the same person I was I'm
[2:19:54] ready to meet him if he should call me I
[2:19:56] was afraid before but I'm Not Afraid now
[2:19:58] I know that he came to me I know that he
[2:20:01] spoke to me well just a few weeks later
[2:20:04] I was on my way
[2:20:06] to a wedding I tell these all for the
[2:20:08] glory of God friends I was on my way to
[2:20:10] a wedding and I was going to go this
[2:20:11] certain route but I I decided to go this
[2:20:13] way and I get a call
[2:20:15] from his daughter and said they didn't
[2:20:17] know what was wrong with them and
[2:20:18] finally they took him to a specialist
[2:20:19] and the specialist told him you've got
[2:20:22] pancreatic cancer your pancreas is
[2:20:24] covered in tumors and cysts dozens of
[2:20:26] them just tumors all over it he began to
[2:20:29] talk to him he said is there any history
[2:20:30] of this yeah my dad died of pancreatic
[2:20:32] cancer at my age and the doctor told him
[2:20:35] well this is probably how you're going
[2:20:36] to go it's just a genetic curse there's
[2:20:37] nothing we can do for it we can't
[2:20:39] operate it we can't touch it it's just
[2:20:41] all over it it's just every your
[2:20:43] pancreas is covered in it
[2:20:47] and I was on my way to this wedding and
[2:20:49] his daughter calls and she says I don't
[2:20:51] know if there's any way you can make it
[2:20:52] there but he's about to get a secondary
[2:20:55] scan taken of how they're going to go
[2:20:57] forward and treatment and is there any
[2:20:59] way you could go encourage him and pray
[2:21:00] with him I was 30 minutes from the
[2:21:03] hospital he was at
[2:21:04] this is a three-hour Drive I just
[2:21:06] happened to be 30 minutes from there and
[2:21:08] you might think there's no way that God
[2:21:10] can get to your situation and come to
[2:21:11] where you're at but he's already on the
[2:21:14] way because he knows where you're gonna
[2:21:15] be when you call out his name and he's
[2:21:17] already come to meet you at that
[2:21:19] intersection
[2:21:20] we walk in that hospital room and I just
[2:21:22] asked the brother I said brother I
[2:21:24] believe God's A Healer he said I know
[2:21:25] God's A Healer and he began to testify
[2:21:27] to me about all the things that God had
[2:21:29] done in his life and all the healings
[2:21:30] he'd seen all the Miracles he'd seen
[2:21:32] take place and that the atmosphere began
[2:21:35] to change in that room
[2:21:36] he testified to me for over an hour of
[2:21:39] the hand of God moving in his life I
[2:21:41] didn't preach to him I didn't I didn't I
[2:21:43] didn't try to I didn't try to work him
[2:21:45] up I didn't try to Baby him he
[2:21:47] encouraged me by the word
[2:21:50] yeah it's in that place to sit brother
[2:21:51] can I lay my hands on you
[2:21:53] he said I wish that you would pray for
[2:21:56] me and as an anointing was there I just
[2:21:58] put my hands on my sin Lord God
[2:22:00] you're the same yesterday today or
[2:22:02] forever and I believe if you ever healed
[2:22:04] a man once you'll heal him again and our
[2:22:06] brothers poured out his heart to you and
[2:22:08] he's he says search me and try me if
[2:22:10] there's anything in me Lord remove it
[2:22:12] Lord bring healing to his body we curse
[2:22:14] this generational cycle that's over his
[2:22:16] life we curse this generational cycle
[2:22:18] that Satan has tried to put over his
[2:22:20] life to tell him that he's never gonna
[2:22:22] move past it we curse that in the name
[2:22:24] of Jesus Christ just a simple prayer and
[2:22:27] brother I walk out and as I'm walking
[2:22:28] out there's a there's a space there
[2:22:30] between the curtain and the door
[2:22:34] I said Lord
[2:22:36] you'll cause these scans to come back
[2:22:38] clean I will travel the world and tell
[2:22:40] of this miracle
[2:22:42] and I walk out the door I didn't make it
[2:22:44] two hours down the road and those other
[2:22:46] scans came back in the day had already
[2:22:48] taken but the results hadn't come in
[2:22:50] until I was two hours down the road and
[2:22:52] they said there's no cancer on your
[2:22:54] pancreas
