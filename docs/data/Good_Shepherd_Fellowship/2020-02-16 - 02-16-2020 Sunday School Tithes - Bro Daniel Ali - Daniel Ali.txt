========================================

we thank you so much Oh God for this morning we are so grateful Lord that we have lived to see this day we know is not because of our smartness or is because because we know how to take good care of ourselves because it pleases thee that it should be and for every day we live to see there is a purpose a god-given purpose now we ought to accomplish in our life we are so grateful Lord that you have gathered us once again by your throne of grace where else would we rather be before the throne of the king of kings and a lot of loss there is none like unto thee for you are great and you are wonderful you are mighty you are just so wonderful go to safe and we thank you so much for what you have done for us O God we are so grateful Lord for having brought us this far and by this we know that we are overcomers because you des have started the good works in us I never given up until you bring this way to a completion Presbyterian Holy Name Oh God we are so grateful that we are the hands of the Almighty God we are not an accident in your hands your tour of us father before you even lay the foundation stone of this earth and we are here to do your will and your will we shall do we thank you so much for being the author and the finisher of our faith this morning father we'll give you the glory and the honor we praise thee father we worship the velocity and we uplift angular for your Holy Name for all that they have done for us Oh God for the next area or so - Farah we are so going to look at our topic on tithing way prettier Lord Jesus just come and help us further in the few things we have to say we just thank you so much Father in Jesus name Amen praise be to God yes so I just have maybe 10 minutes to talk about this then are we invited brother Scott the very day I started this topic since Naomi told me that where Scott has a wonderful testimony about tithing so I said okay that is good to know so I had that at the back of my mind and I have been waiting for the opportunity to get brother Scott to come over and he and I spoke last two weeks and as God would have it he'll be talking to us this morning so 15 minutes to the end of our time I'm going to call him so I just have probably just about 10 minutes so bear with me this morning and I've been talking to this just by way of an announcement so if I go over my time a little just bear with me because that is not part of my our our our our our Sunday school I've been talking to brother 1 and now he wants us to stop playing the tips by the end first week of March unless something changes I think that is what we'll be doing we still have a few things to talk about that so I would have to bring this one end somehow before then so we can go into the tapes praise be to God so just we're reading shall we take again Malachi 3 alright so Malachi 3:10 bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts if I will not open to you if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall be not there shall not be room enough to receive it praise be to God yes so what I have here for the next few minutes I want us to look at why do we pay tithes why do we pay tithe and what I have here is that we pay twice because God is so you know it's a wonderful thing when you do the will of God without questioning it it's a wonderful thing that sometimes you don't understand what the Word of God says before the fact that you know it is the Word of God you go ahead and you do it anyhow we serve God by faith we don't serve God by comprehension don't wait to understand before you give you all to God you whatever field it is do it by feet because it is the word of God and was this soon at any given point in time even were to receive your healing when you are prayed for if the pain level was probably troopers arm normally they say maybe one to over ten and then after we are being prayed for the plane moves from two over ten to ten over ten still Tongo that you are healed why it's not because you are feeling good or you are feeling better but because the Word of God says so God is on it in that praise be to God so we pair ties because the Word of God and joins us to pay ties we observe it as an ordinance as a lot of God we don't have to understand it praise be to God so that is the first reason I have here and then secondly we pay our ties to support the church praise be to God so we don't just support the church with our presence we support the church with our presence and with our tyson offering so it's not okay to sit in the house and then let your tighten offerings come and it's not okay also to come to church and not pay your tithe and offering the two go hand-in-hand that is the way we support the work of god that is the way to go now in the message let us see God paragraph 28 1958 59 but you know I feel like this that a member of a the our first obligation is with their tithes and offerings is to support their church does your first duty to God bring your tight and offering to the storehouse of God and the storehouse you surely know what this is is where you get your food so that's where you get your spiritual food and your obligation is to your church praise be to God so to support the work of God to support the Church of the Living God you have to pay your tithes and your friends what I have here is number three takes it's not our money it's God's money so by paying tides you are giving god what belongs to him you know when you keep something that doesn't belong to you in essence you have stolen it the Bible says in Malachi 3:8 if I can just take it in a minute will a man Rob God yet you have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in types and offering in tithes and offering we robbed God so when you pay your tithes you are just carrying something that doesn't belong to you you are just current something that we launched to God you have just carried it as an obligation as a duty knowing that is not mine it belongs to God so I'm giving it to God praise be to God so that is another reason why we have to pay tithes and there is a place to pay your tithes one day we came to church after church now I've told me her friend had a baby naming ceremony and they had it in the church so we went there and then they were talking about tithing and somebody asked a question no it was a contribution the fellow gave and the fellow said that he was not paying his tied to the church or to the pasta because the pastas misuse the ties and what I view in the first place your obligation or your duty is to pay your tie to God which ever wear the tightest used is not your concern it's not your cup of tea that is another topic praise be to God so and this was what the gentleman was saying and then he said to pay his tight he goes he carried the money and then gives it to the poor it's a good thing to help the poor if you are in a position to do it do not use God's money to do good it's good to do good don't use God's money to win do good God's money belongs to the house of God and you are saying because of that he can still remain he gives it to the poor no that is no way we are being instructed to pay that money or to put that money that is wrong that money belongs in the house of God that is why you get your deliberate man shall not live by bread alone but by every way that pushes our mouth of God you don't get your bread from the poor person day as I've said if you had a position to help the poor do it it's a good there is a blessing in that God loves to see that but I don't take the money that belongs to God and then go out there and then give it to somebody and think you did something good it's very bad very wrong something she didn't do praise be to God why do we pay tight okay so it's right where I want the time to be yes so whereas God is going to share with us whatever God has laid on his hatch and yes open your ears tap into it James don't happen by chance praise be to God relevant good morning Saints first of all bill Danna was I'm thinking about that sir when you're preach about you know finding God's purpose for your life and it reminded me in the scripture if he is one of my favorites not my my real favorite Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10 where it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them that God has for Deen each and every one of us amen forward Amy for the foundation of the world that he wants to walk in your shoes he wants to use your lips that fact he wants you he wants he wants us just get out of the way and let him do as he pleases and then he turns around and and calls us a good and faithful servant for just letting him do what he desire to do through us so I kind of like that program amen so this morning you know Naomi came up to me and she said I'll pray for you this morning I've been praying for ya while she's praying for me because she wants me to come up and tell her myself that's why that's the testimony so but just as brother Dan was sharing a few things it just made me smile you know when I was a little boy I have two older brothers and three younger brothers and when we were just little fallows my mom being a godly woman we'd go to church and she'd give us each a dime and then we were supposed to put that in the offering plate just teaching us early on you know how to you know to be mindful of being a good steward of God's God's money and of course it was very clear to us it wasn't our money and that was for a specific purpose that we weren't supposed to just put it in our pocket and go to the go to the candy store and of course back at that time $0.10 Josh ma says you could buy a whole bag full of candy for about ten cents you get a penny candy okay a good candy bars Snickers bar something was only a nickel I could have two if I decided I was going to be tempted about it but but we realized that it wasn't our money to begin with our mom gave it to us and with a specific purpose that it was to train us to be to take that ten cents and put it in the offering plate that it could be used for God's purpose and you know just fast-forward now here I am for almost 60 years later and God still has the same requirement when I was trained instead of 10 cents it's 10% amen i tithe and so it's still the same and I don't have any notes here but and that could be dangerous because no notes I could just be never-ending so you know brother Gerald Hughes he's an old friend of mine and the pastor he's been pastoring church for about Oh probably about 45 years down in near Columbia South Carolina but brother Gerald tells a story I had a little saying he says he says they would be better off if you went and beat up your grandma and stole her purse than to not pay your tithe because you'd only be accused of beating up your grandma and stealing from her but when you don't pay your tithe our brother already mentioned and the scripture says you're actually you stolen from him and as our brother read he said he said if you would pay your ties he would rebuke the Devourer do you know that God if you don't pay your ties yes he has somebody called a devourer that's gonna collect those ties anyway I believe me you'll probably take a lot more than 10% if he has to come and get it from ya so and once it's okay it's kind of humorous to me because because God knows how to get his point across he can eat you know you either give you the ten cents and you put it in the offering plate or he'll make sure he collects it later on your choice so anyway that comes to the story that I need to tell on myself oh it was kind of early in our marriage we were in our and the old church I we are in over it and well at that time we were over in Plymouth and anyway I one time I just decided I just didn't pay my tithe I wasn't upset about anything I wasn't and I wasn't that I didn't believe it here anyway but I just failed to do it and I wasn't upset with the past or anything like that I just didn't write that check out and guess what then the next time I got my paycheck from work I didn't write it out that time and all sudden I wasn't writing out a month went by two months went by three months a year went by and I just didn't pay my tithe I had no reason not to pay it but I just didn't do it and so I don't even remember how long it was but I was at least a year man if we have to Naomi she'll probably tell her she can't tell you exactly what it was I just I just got I just quit paid it and I just did not have a revelation of it and so anyway the pastor had a project that he was working on and so he asked new me to do some seamstress work for him and after it was quite involved and so when she was it when she was done her bill to the pastor was about three hundred dollars I was pretty extensive work and she was a professional seamstress for a high-fashion men's Collier down in south Dale and so she actually went there one of her friends said what would you charge for doing this custom work and she said oh absolutely three hundred dollars would be a you know would be you know a gift probably to the person you know just to pay that much so anyway he wasn't too happy about it and but yet he paid he paid Naomi the three hundred dollars she turned right around he says honey why don't we let's take this money and put it toward tithe and I said let's start paying our tithes and so the scripture says to provoke one another to good works and so just by her decision to you to turn around and just give that money right back where it really belonged it actually you know I repented and I started paying my tithes and not only did I even start paying my tithe paycheck-to-paycheck that I owed as I got a paycheck but I went back and paid every penny of those ties from like I said a year year and a half so I was paying not only was I paying the tithe then I was paying you know current but also go way back and then 20 percent above that so that I got caught back up and I've never had that problem since and so of course now I'm I smile because it's just an absolute amen you know to what what our brothers saying but you know God is good amen I just want to read one scripture if I can find it here oh yeah it says Luke chapter 6 verse 38 now you know ties is just that's just the beginning amen I don't know brother Dan's touched on offering but tithe and offering are two different things tithe is what is that is the ten cents that God gave you to put back in the offering plate what you do above and beyond that that's offerings and of course tithe is for the is goes towards the ministry in their work in the ministry and then offerings is for the upkeep and our expenses in the building of course brother Stevie get up and talk all about them but God in the final thing I want to say is as God is the important thing is that it's your attitude and I don't know brother Dan you've probably touched on that already too so if I have forgive me but maybe I'll just punctuate that that God's looking he knows your heart and he knows your attitude if you're just giving it grudgingly well how can God bless something that's just you know I have to pry your finger open to get that 10 cents so anyway the scripture Luke 6 verse 38 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over think about that Saints running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again you know God has a way of you just give a little and you'll get a lot more back so if you want to make an investment make it an investment in Christ amen if a cup of water given in the name of the disciple that God will recognize even that what about us as believers didn't Jesus say that he he stood there and say they were actually putting their money in the offering basket they all went by and yet the woman who gave the two months no it was the widow's mice she either two mites God said that he had seen her our Jesus said she's given more than any of these other folks so when you do give whether it's your ties whether it's your offering remember God sees it and he'll remember you for that - that's all I got god bless you ready sketch wonderful yes oh yes so five more minutes so that's good yes as he rightly said they're always say we should provoke one another unto good works yes so you know the the woman is there to complain to compliment you as the main you know you complement one another so it's a very very good thing even though the man is the head of the house you were the woman you have you have a voice you know the English versus what the woman is your better half you are you and you are never very good very well until you have you have the half attached so there is a lot of influence that you sisters have don't don't wish to that getting to the very last portions of it brother Scott mentioned attitude the God is looking for attitude I said it here one time ago that your attitude determines your altitude your behavior in your walk with God determines how far you go with God it's very very important keep that at the back of your minds never forget it in any case whatever you give God would be given back to you with a measure so anything given to God is not lost anything you give to God is not lost and you should be happy as a man for that matter a woman that God is willing to take something of your hand that a lot of loss in the King of Kings who owns all the wealth we can think about that he is willing willing to take something it doesn't matter how small it is he is willing to take it and not look down upon it and bless you in return praise be to God yes so I'm just probably a minute or two away so I wouldn't put in anything so I will try we have just two more classes before we start with the tapes so I will try to compress everything before the end of this month so we can start with the tapes next first week of next month I think yes so shall we just go to God in prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus we thank you so much that we can gather together on a morning like this in adult Sunday School it is not to say we don't know it's just
