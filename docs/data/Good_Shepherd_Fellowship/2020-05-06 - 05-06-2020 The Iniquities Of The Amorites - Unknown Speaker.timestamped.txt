[20:29] distance to get him but we want to thank
[20:32] the Lord this evening and let's just
[20:37] let's just go to the world let's go to

[21:17] and brother brother brother rather
[21:29] brother did you send his greetings from
[21:33] me and I just spoke with in one way here

[21:38] service tonight praise the Lord
[21:42] Genesis chapter 15
[21:54] let's read from verse 13 we'll talk a
[21:58] little bit on this chapter but let's
[21:59] read from verse 13 Genesis chapter 15
[22:03] verse 13 and he said unto Abraham know
[22:09] of a surety that thy seed shall be a
[22:16] stranger in a land that is not theirs
[22:21] and shall serve them and they shall
[22:26] afflict them for hundred years and also
[22:32] that nation whom this yourself will add
[22:36] George and after all shall they come out
[22:41] with great such things and there shall
[22:46] go to the fathers in peace there shall
[22:52] be buried in a good old age but in the
[22:58] fourth generation they come hither again
[23:03] for the iniquities of the amorite is Ned
[23:08] yet for amen let us pray Heavenly Father
[23:14] we won't thank you tonight and we just
[23:19] appreciate you for another time that we
[23:23] can come around your world I pray father
[23:25] bless your children father God as we all
[23:28] pour into the service tonight Lord as
[23:32] your wonderful blessing upon the world
[23:34] we thank you we love you and we
[23:37] appreciate you as we commit ourselves in
[23:39] your hands now
[23:40] in Jesus name we pray Amy hello bless
[23:45] you we have your seat well there are a
[23:51] few things I want us to look at tonight
[23:56] if I forget to say it at least I will
[24:00] not be in trouble
[24:01] happy Mother's Day on Sunday to all our
[24:04] sisters and this is rather lady never I
[24:16] want to be sooner praise the Lord
[24:21] amen tonight let's let's just look at
[24:26] some few things for the background we
[24:30] will be looking into the message or
[24:32] looking away to Jesus there are some few
[24:36] coats I have there I want for us to read
[24:38] and Bert Jordan I think we are done with
[24:44] our the tape we were playing for Sunday
[24:47] school yeah
[24:48] it will be good for us to pick up from
[24:51] from this tape like we will use it
[24:54] tonight so ELISA the people can be able
[24:57] to get a background of what we'll be
[24:59] reading tonight
[25:10] looking away to Jesus bar Branham in
[25:14] this a message he's will beginning
[25:19] non-talking on some few things that have
[25:22] happened over the years in his ministry
[25:24] and most especially is in this ministry
[25:30] where he kind of for pota
[25:33] the manifestation wish of course yeah
[25:38] there are many manifestation of the
[25:41] temple but there were five major the
[25:44] brother brand and pull together as the
[25:48] temple being identified with these five
[25:52] manifestation since 5 is the number of
[25:55] grace is the bride's number so it's very
[25:59] very important to us and now we want for
[26:02] us to look at those five manifestation
[26:05] that identified the temple and so we
[26:10] will look at we will just read some of
[26:12] the few things he said year and then we
[26:18] will we were going to what we want to
[26:21] talk about tonight
[26:22] and I hope you'll be able to see it
[26:32] he said that a pool has now been
[26:35] vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[26:41] what it is what is the tape home the
[26:46] opening of the word the tear pool is the
[26:51] Bryce ministry it's a ministry
[26:56] that's been given to the bride I will
[26:59] explain a little bit on there tonight
[27:00] the tear pool man has been vindicated
[27:03] and I'm and I'm sure you all know what
[27:06] it is now remember there will never be
[27:11] an impersonation today cuz it can it can
[27:17] be see it cannot be praise the Lord
[27:24] now is in existence I'm I am one of this
[27:29] right at this time now is it just
[27:34] happened so it could identify its
[27:39] presence ammonia unaligned death it
[27:45] could identify his presence among you
[27:47] see but it will not be used in a great
[27:53] way the tape on we identify his presence
[27:57] among you now remember when we look at
[28:00] Ruth in in in the gleaming season she
[28:07] came at the end of the harvest but Boris
[28:12] to his men that issued drop a battle of
[28:16] year that she dropped a battle look
[28:20] there
[28:21] because Ruth harvest was not going to be
[28:25] like the beginning of habits since she
[28:28] was in a grainy season she'll be getting
[28:30] little little but one down the row she
[28:34] would just find a bundle they will not
[28:37] all be together it's not a great harvest
[28:40] of manifestation it will happen in a
[28:43] little way God
[28:46] manifests his present among us but in a
[28:49] little bit not in a great way and I can
[28:52] tell you that we have seen it praise the
[28:55] Lord amen
[28:57] we have seen it
[29:00] I mean having prayers being answered in
[29:05] our miss is one of it one of the latest
[29:08] one is I mean we stay have sister quiche
[29:10] with us so I mean there's that's a big
[29:13] answer to pray praise the Lord he says
[29:16] so it could identify his presence among
[29:19] you see but it will not be used in a
[29:23] great way until this council begin to
[29:26] tighten up so when it does the
[29:31] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[29:34] impersonate anything can be done but
[29:39] when that time comes when the squeeze
[29:42] comes down then you will see what you
[29:46] have seen temporarily will manifest in
[29:51] the fullness of its power praise the
[29:55] Lord Amen now with all this that is
[30:02] happening you know many asking that
[30:07] question is this the squeeze is this the
[30:10] time and we have to realize the other I
[30:14] mean this is is it's a plague upon the
[30:18] word I mean we can put that on a type of
[30:21] of the Exeter and and go to the children
[30:26] of Israel to pull the dog the blood on
[30:28] the linkage of the doorpost you know I
[30:32] mean there was there was the the talking
[30:35] a sign of you know they are safely going
[30:38] out and simply coming back in praise the
[30:41] Lord and we believe there we are honor
[30:43] they are talking amen that is the blood
[30:45] that is the bleeding word that we have
[30:48] fellowship in around now so but seeing
[30:53] what is happening around the world I
[30:55] would not I would not affirm that we are
[30:58] in the squeeze but I
[30:59] say to you that we are getting close to
[31:03] that time praise the Lord
[31:05] I mean we are moving right into it with
[31:08] all of the things that is happening
[31:10] there was something that I was thinking
[31:12] about I drew my mind to this and I read
[31:14] it to you right your brother branham see
[31:15] he said talking about a temple it is so
[31:19] sacred that I mustn't said much about it
[31:22] as he told me in the beginning said this
[31:28] said nothing of it you remember that
[31:31] years ago congregation says amen
[31:33] it speaks for itself the tear food will
[31:37] speak for itself
[31:39] praise the Lord I have tried to explain
[31:42] the other that's the first pool and the
[31:45] second and I made a mistake
[31:47] this will be the thing he says to my
[31:51] opinion I don't say the law tell me this
[31:54] this will be the thing that will start
[31:58] the rapture in faith for the girl in a
[32:01] way what would be the thing that we
[32:04] start the rapture effect the
[32:06] manifestation of this tape oh praise the
[32:10] Lord when we see Christ manifesting his
[32:14] word among us now let's read this also
[32:18] now there is coming a time in this
[32:23] nation the word this nation is going to
[32:26] exercise all the power that the Beast
[32:30] had before it which was pagan Rome when
[32:36] when it when it becomes Papa room see
[32:40] that this nation would do it revelation
[32:44] 13 plainly explaining that lamb come up
[32:48] out of the earth there are other beasts
[32:50] come up out of the water
[32:53] thickness multitudes of people this line
[32:56] come up were there were no people alarm
[32:59] represent a religion he says the Lamb of
[33:03] God and remember is speaks like a lamb
[33:08] it was a lamb and then after the white
[33:12] received
[33:13] power to speak like a dragon in it and
[33:16] exercise power the dragon high before
[33:21] him the dragon is room now this is word
[33:25] you know
[33:27] all of this comes you know to my mind
[33:30] brother branham tells us Amir as he goes
[33:33] down in this message he talks about way
[33:36] back then he talks about we been to the
[33:40] place word it would take generation and
[33:44] generation and generation to pay the
[33:47] depths that that the nation have and now
[33:51] with everything that is happening and
[33:54] with with what is on us present in them
[33:58] and I mean the country trying to manage
[34:03] the crisis and trying to manage all the
[34:06] people that are out of work you know
[34:08] trying to I mean trying to keep some
[34:12] sense of order just trying to manage a
[34:15] meaning and it had been a great blessing
[34:17] to everyone of us but this is what we
[34:20] should put in our mind all of this is is
[34:24] not reducing the debt its increasing the
[34:28] depth it's putting us to the place word
[34:32] is setting a platform for us to turn to
[34:38] the dragon for the nation to be
[34:42] empowered praise the Lord you know I'm
[34:49] not trying to preach a scary message but
[34:54] I'm just trying to show that I mean we
[34:56] are stepping right in line with
[34:58] Scripture with everything that is
[35:00] happening you know if years back we were
[35:06] at a place word I mean it would take
[35:09] like Berta Branham says children
[35:11] children children to pay the death how
[35:13] much more now so what is going to make
[35:21] this Lomb exercise the power of the
[35:26] Dragon
[35:27] is when she will have to turn to her to
[35:29] pay off her debts
[35:34] praise the Lord
[35:35] so we have to keep that in mind amen we
[35:40] have to keep that in mind now just like
[35:43] the scripture we rare tonight on the
[35:46] iniquity of the amorite I want to go
[35:51] into that a little bit but I want to
[35:53] show where we are standing we spoke
[35:56] Sunday on children of the promise
[35:59] what is our promise you know we have a
[36:02] promise for the day that we are living
[36:04] in you know and and just like Abraham
[36:09] and his seed now see God is telling
[36:12] Abraham
[36:13] God is affirming to Abraham that Ellie
[36:15] is I will not be the one you know to be
[36:19] your hair say it's going to be your own
[36:21] seed you will have a son but let me show
[36:25] you what is going to happen Abraham gave
[36:27] him a vision took him out there make the
[36:30] sacrifice and everything and then God is
[36:32] telling him your seed was so John for
[36:36] them to ever travel they must be born
[36:40] God is telling your see was so drawn
[36:43] into a strange lane for them to travel
[36:48] if they have to be born so God is
[36:50] affirming to Abraham you will have a
[36:52] seed that will be born and they will
[36:55] soar John into a strange land that is
[36:58] not yet they're going to be there for
[37:00] 400 years wish of course at that time
[37:03] was four generation so even before
[37:12] Abraham had Isaac God is telling him
[37:16] there this thing is going to happen I'm
[37:19] not only telling here I told you before
[37:21] you left your your your fatherland and
[37:24] you had trouble out of these years I
[37:26] told you about that son now let me tell
[37:28] you a little bit about his future 400
[37:35] years
[37:37] and he's going to be I mean he's going
[37:40] to be my treated by the nation's that he
[37:46] would go to all of these things are
[37:47] going to happen to him
[37:50] but then after full generation I'm going
[37:54] to come down with a mighty him and I'm
[37:58] going to deliver them I'm going to bring
[38:01] them out and I'm going to bring them
[38:03] back to this land but before I bring
[38:06] them back to this land there is
[38:08] something that is going to happen the
[38:12] iniquity of the AMA rights
[38:14] I go into before so it's almost in in
[38:19] the same place brother Branham you're
[38:21] talking about the tempo and and and
[38:24] telling us the things that would bring
[38:26] the squeeze upon us you know though
[38:30] where we are going to get all for that
[38:33] before that Valka to come upon the
[38:37] nation you know for all the churches to
[38:39] be regulated where what what would
[38:42] actually happen now he's he's telling us
[38:45] now this manifestation of the temple
[38:49] will really come into power when we find
[38:52] ourself in this place now we can look at
[38:56] everything that is happening around us
[38:58] and say mine mine if all of this is
[39:02] happening it means that we are getting
[39:05] to that place praise the Lord we are
[39:10] getting to that place because I mean the
[39:13] depth is is getting to a limit word I
[39:17] mean we would just have to look for
[39:19] someone to bail us out and when the
[39:24] nation does that it will be surrounding
[39:28] all is religious right to the Catholic
[39:32] Church praise the Lord
[39:38] but
[39:39] brother branham here is now telling us
[39:41] that before we get to that time there is
[39:45] something that is going to happen to us
[39:48] we the bride members we are in this hour
[39:54] we are we are at this time this is this
[39:57] is the part of this is our this is our
[40:01] territory this is where we are and the
[40:04] things that supposed to be happening in
[40:06] the Manas we will be experiencing this
[40:08] manifestation praise the Lord
[40:13] Elijah came on the scene and he said
[40:16] there will be no rain or Dew you until I
[40:21] Elijah call for it now so God had to
[40:26] bring the nation the entire nation to a
[40:29] place where there was no rain there was
[40:32] famine in the land for not only Elijah
[40:35] but also the people that the the 7,000
[40:41] that they now body has to build for them
[40:43] also to experience the same supernatural
[40:46] that Elijah was experiencing praise the
[40:52] Lord
[40:53] so I believe that's where we are where
[40:57] Branham said he says and then after a
[41:01] while receive power and speak like a
[41:04] dragon that's the that's the lamb
[41:06] exercised all the order the power the
[41:10] dragon high before him he says who's the
[41:12] dragon Rome always so don't you see Rome
[41:18] denomination a MacPro testing
[41:21] denomination an image onto the Beast
[41:24] making a power that will force all
[41:27] protesters like a union you have to be
[41:32] in this Council of Churches all you
[41:35] won't be able to have fellowship he said
[41:40] well it's practically that way you can
[41:46] go to a church and preach unless you
[41:49] have a fellowship card or or an
[41:52] identification
[41:53] now he says drop-down he says it's
[41:57] tightening and then when that time comes
[42:01] and the press comes to the place to
[42:06] where you press out then watch what I'm
[42:12] fixing to tell you in a few minute
[42:15] watch the tape ooh then see it will it
[42:21] will be absolutely told the total loss
[42:25] it will be for the bride and their
[42:29] church praise the Lord now so with this
[42:34] being said I want to bring us to the
[42:37] place for us to a few things I want for
[42:42] us to look at now you see Jesus in C
[42:45] Matthew chapter 24 when he was talking
[42:48] about about the Jews and about the
[42:51] temple according to Daniel prophecy the
[42:55] Jews will go back to their place of
[42:59] worship they would go back to their
[43:02] temple worship when the abomination that
[43:06] causes desolation it's taking away now
[43:12] that is for the Jews so in one sense
[43:15] there is something that is hindering
[43:17] them from going back to their complete
[43:20] temple worship and that is the same
[43:23] thing with the church that is the same
[43:28] thing with the bride that is the same
[43:30] thing I mean with the church now we have
[43:32] a promise here and and and and God is
[43:36] telling the children of Israel or tell
[43:40] him a brunette your seed was so John and
[43:44] after they will come back and he Herod
[43:47] this land that I've given to you but
[43:50] before they come and take this land
[43:52] there is something that is going to keep
[43:55] them away that is going to handle them
[43:57] and that thing is going to be the
[44:00] iniquity of the AMA rights
[44:03] praise the Lord now
[44:05] so if we are Abraham's seed if we have a
[44:09] promise
[44:11] praise the Lord then there is something
[44:13] also that is hindering us from their
[44:17] promise wish of course we have a promise
[44:24] praise the Lord
[44:29] now brother Branham in that in that
[44:32] message look away to Jesus he spoke
[44:36] about the 5 manifestations that identify
[44:41] the temple and is beautiful as as I was
[44:44] looking a to them in and looking through
[44:47] their messages he spoke about you you
[44:49] just you just think about it
[44:51] I kind of listed out in a way year that
[44:55] I think it's beautiful
[44:57] he talks about the scorer's wish of
[45:03] course is I put that on the creation
[45:09] because he spoke them into existing
[45:12] and he spoke now right after that
[45:16] experience he came over to sister hell
[45:22] ride house and he was talking about that
[45:24] and that was where she she confesses
[45:28] saber bram there is nothing but the
[45:31] truth and right there the Holy Spirit
[45:35] told him the same God has spoke those
[45:38] strollers into existing he said have
[45:41] told me right now for you to ask
[45:43] anything and she asks for the salvation
[45:47] of Hasan's so honor the temple we saw
[45:52] creation we saw salvation and then we
[46:01] saw resurrection of the little fish and
[46:09] then we also saw healing he says before
[46:15] the doctor we touch sister media
[46:20] you take the tumor away and we also saw
[46:27] what I put in my notes I put dominium
[46:30] but it was control over nature
[46:34] controlling the storm and brother
[46:36] branham you know so as you listen to
[46:39] that message you will find the Bourbon
[46:40] goes over there you know he kind of
[46:43] place it right in there of all of those
[46:46] things that God used to identify the the
[46:51] tape oh let me let me let me show
[46:55] something here let's go to the book of
[46:58] Corinthians let's go to the book of
[47:09] Corinthians praise the Lord
[47:32] Corinthians chapter 12
[48:00] praise more
[48:07] let's read from verse 6 and there are
[48:12] diversities of operation but it is the
[48:15] same God which worketh all in all but
[48:19] the manifestation of the Spirit is given
[48:23] to every man to profit whether for to
[48:28] one is giving by the spirit the word of
[48:31] wisdom to another the word of knowledge
[48:36] by the spirit to another faith by the
[48:42] spirit to another the gifts of healing
[48:48] by the spirit to another the working of
[48:54] miracles to another prophecy to another
[48:58] discerning of spirit and to another
[49:02] devil kinds of tongues into another
[49:05] interpretation of tongues now a brother
[49:09] branham when he talks about the gift of
[49:12] healing him he said he said he said we
[49:17] should realize here that Paul when he
[49:20] talks here he talks about the gifts of
[49:25] healing now in these gifts of healing
[49:29] where Brenham help us to understand that
[49:33] God all of these gifts of healing God
[49:37] can heal by music God can heal by his
[49:43] word God can heal by medical science God
[49:47] can heal by hurts God can heal by
[49:51] praying he plays out of this honor the
[49:55] gifts of healing praise alone but
[50:01] brother Branham also help us to
[50:04] understand too that when the angel of
[50:07] the Lord came to him down in in the cave
[50:10] and told him you have been given a gift
[50:13] of divine healing for the you know for
[50:18] the nation now
[50:19] that's word is different from what Paul
[50:23] promised for the local church he said
[50:28] you have he make emphasis on that he
[50:31] says you have to realize the angel said
[50:34] you have been giving the gifts of divine
[50:36] healing now the way he brother honor his
[50:40] ministry was the first port the second
[50:43] port the first pool by the vibration of
[50:46] the of the hand he could detect the
[50:49] illness the second pole was by the
[50:52] discernment of spirit he will know the
[50:55] very disease of the people and the tear
[50:57] pool will be the word prays alone so
[51:05] that that gift that that God gave to
[51:09] brother Branham now with this gift of
[51:12] these gifts of healing is the gifts that
[51:14] is in the body now you see many men has
[51:18] raised of all true the century and
[51:22] having gifts of healing to pray for the
[51:24] sick brother Branham says they are
[51:26] seeing gift of healing the heart he says
[51:29] that is the same gift of healing and
[51:31] mother have to pray for her daughter
[51:34] because it's a gift that is giving to
[51:36] the church a child has that gift of
[51:40] healing to pray for their sick parent
[51:42] when the scripture says they will lay
[51:45] their hands on the sick and pray for the
[51:48] sick when a wife pray for her husband or
[51:55] the husband pray for the wife is a gift
[51:57] that is given to the church it's
[51:59] supposed to be in the body now God has
[52:06] blessed men with measure of faith but a
[52:13] gift that God has set a sign that is
[52:17] different from what they are postal Paul
[52:20] place in the church
[52:23] yes Roberto Branham talks about that
[52:26] comes that angel of the Lord told him
[52:29] about because that Ministry of no
[52:33] whirring the diseases but the touching
[52:36] of the hand was completely different and
[52:41] he says now one time it has been wrong
[52:45] now when he talks about a year in a
[52:48] message of looking away to Jesus he
[52:54] spoke about it he says talking to this
[52:57] woman and and praying for her you know
[52:59] that was the first time she ever saw it
[53:02] now brother Branham will use this now to
[53:04] be able to tell us how come he got to
[53:08] know about sister media having disease
[53:12] because he just touched a woman and and
[53:16] he told a woman this is what happening
[53:18] to you she said I don't have no symptoms
[53:20] about that brother Branham he said this
[53:22] had never been wrong he called another
[53:27] brother come and he touched the brother
[53:29] he says that there is nothing wrong with
[53:30] him he says even even media comes media
[53:34] is well nothing wrong with her but when
[53:36] he touched system media he felt a
[53:41] vibration on his hand and he says you
[53:44] have a seat she said no now watch now
[53:47] watch and see let's see how you know how
[53:50] God can afford a design this gift before
[53:55] when when brother Branham touched system
[53:58] media they only had Rebecca she had bill
[54:03] appalled and they had Rebecca when Sarah
[54:09] was born better Benham to his dieter
[54:12] because of why he have detected for the
[54:15] doctor to check sister media because
[54:18] system eat I gave very birth by
[54:20] c-section the doctor Church the doctor
[54:24] said I never saw anything where Branham
[54:26] says it had never filled one time after
[54:32] Sarah was born when Joseph was born
[54:34] brother Ben said I told the doctor to
[54:36] check and a doctor check and he says
[54:41] there is nothing dealing belly Berbera
[54:46] says
[54:47] to show how Godward never failed it
[54:56] would be the the the the situation word
[54:59] sis Emilia was stress with Joseph
[55:02] attitude and brother branham had just
[55:05] come come home and she wanted him to
[55:08] correct yourself and you know brother
[55:10] branham let it go and she slammed the
[55:12] door now to see that God showed this he
[55:19] showed this before Sarah was born before
[55:23] I just was born
[55:27] praise the Lord
[55:28] and even after having all of this child
[55:31] the doctor check and there was nothing
[55:34] now remember that I'm trying to to late
[55:38] a little place here for us to seed the
[55:41] iniquity of the Amorite it has to come
[55:45] to that place Nia so something something
[55:52] has to get out of other naturally says
[55:58] to me that they not have the SIS but as
[56:01] soon as she did something that she
[56:03] shouldn't have done where brand says
[56:09] what I understand she's tired she's he
[56:11] says he says poor woman she's tired with
[56:14] these children I live all the time I go
[56:16] in and I just I just know she's tired
[56:18] she don't mean it and he says and then I
[56:21] went outside to wash my car he says and
[56:23] then an injured of the law told me go
[56:25] and tell her to read the book of
[56:27] Chronicles when when Miriam you know
[56:31] spoke something about Moses wife praise
[56:37] the Lord
[56:42] so brother branham one he showing how
[56:46] that divine gift never failed and he
[56:50] also showing how that the doctors check
[56:56] nothing happened but just in the time
[56:59] what she did something that she
[57:01] shouldn't have done what he sought
[57:03] yes back praise the Lord
[57:09] where Branham says this was he said this
[57:11] was about I think two years before Sarah
[57:14] was born so what he saw years back now
[57:19] here is God telling Abraham years before
[57:23] your see was so John they would go away
[57:28] but when they are coming back to their
[57:30] inheritance before they get here the
[57:35] iniquity of the amorite has to rise up
[57:41] praise the Lord because God would not
[57:45] kick them out of the land God will not
[57:47] judge them until they get to a place to
[57:55] stop God's people from taking their
[57:58] inheritance praise the Lord
[58:02] now if we want to if we want to bring it
[58:04] in a time and just compare it there with
[58:07] system either health which is she's the
[58:10] woman she's a type of the church brother
[58:12] Branham is the man he's the ministry a
[58:15] type of the word God had to wait for the
[58:20] ministry that was met all of the first
[58:22] pool there was not something for the
[58:24] second pool God have to wait to the
[58:27] place where we have to come to the place
[58:30] of taking over our in everything's what
[58:33] is our inheritance tear pool what is the
[58:35] tape who for taking us back to Eden
[58:37] position
[58:44] so that way back when he was still under
[58:47] the first pool with a vibration of his
[58:49] hand but it never came out when he was
[58:53] discerning there were a lot of media
[58:55] system me that was sitting in it never
[58:58] came out until this time of the typhoon
[59:04] God is saying your people were so John
[59:07] in a strange Lane and then after 400
[59:12] years I will bring them out with a
[59:15] mighty him praise the Lord amen now I
[59:28] want for us to look at some few
[59:30] Scripture
[59:35] let's look at numbers chapter 21 numbers
[59:45] chapter 21
[59:58] numbers chapter 21 let's read from verse
[1:00:00] 21 and is recent messenger on to see
[1:00:03] whom king of of the amorite saying let
[1:00:07] me pass through the lane we will not
[1:00:11] turn into the fields
[1:00:14] none into the vania
[1:00:17] we will not drink of the waters of the
[1:00:22] will but we will go alone by the king's
[1:00:28] highway praise the Lord
[1:00:33] until we pass that border but seeing one
[1:00:39] who not suffer Israel to pass through
[1:00:42] his border
[1:00:44] but seeing him gather all his people
[1:00:47] together and went out against Israel
[1:00:50] into the witness and and he came to
[1:00:56] Jesus and fought against Israel now so
[1:01:01] here is where ya which were the the the
[1:01:04] iniquity of the am arise play out for
[1:01:08] for the seed of Abraham we being a
[1:01:14] children of the promise you see where it
[1:01:19] plays out the thing they handle us that
[1:01:23] is stopping us from from getting over to
[1:01:26] our inheritance the thing that is that
[1:01:30] is Henry us four completely so run into
[1:01:34] the world
[1:01:35] the iniquity of the Amorite now you have
[1:01:38] to realize that that word iniquity is a
[1:01:41] very familiar word to the believer when
[1:01:45] we start allowing things that we should
[1:01:48] not allow there would be the very thing
[1:01:54] that we handle us from coming to this
[1:01:56] terrible position from coming to this
[1:02:01] place of because we have to realize that
[1:02:05] this promise is on to us is the promise
[1:02:07] of the Holy Ghost what is the name of
[1:02:10] this promise is
[1:02:11] this land is body our land is not a
[1:02:15] physical lame because if God it will
[1:02:20] work through anybody it has to be a body
[1:02:24] that is submitted subjected to this word
[1:02:26] a body that has been surrounded - this
[1:02:29] word your body and my body brother bear
[1:02:31] them to us over and over he don't have
[1:02:34] no hands but your hands and my hands you
[1:02:36] don't have no feet your feet and my feet
[1:02:39] you don't have a mob to talk you have to
[1:02:42] use your mouth in my mouth saying what
[1:02:47] the word says so this is the land of the
[1:02:50] promise this is a land that has been
[1:02:52] redeemed this is a land where the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost is dwelling in praise the Lord
[1:03:06] we can talk about it we can go into into
[1:03:11] all the types but we have to realize
[1:03:14] that brother branham talking about this
[1:03:19] and teaching us this he he he brought it
[1:03:23] to the place of the church I can show
[1:03:25] you coach what brother Branham says the
[1:03:28] iniquity of the MRIs he talks when the
[1:03:31] Pentecostal starts rejecting the word
[1:03:34] you know he type it to the great falling
[1:03:38] away and there are a lot of types out
[1:03:45] there that we can look at but what I
[1:03:47] want to what up what I'm trying to get
[1:03:50] us to see you is there if we are the
[1:03:54] children of the promise and the promised
[1:03:57] seed was a very promise that God gave
[1:04:00] Abraham there is a see word that has
[1:04:03] come to us and this message is that see
[1:04:08] word it has not just come to give us a
[1:04:12] title as message believers it have not
[1:04:15] just come you know to make us to feel
[1:04:18] different like like event then all the
[1:04:20] people in the world but this word has
[1:04:23] come to possess a people
[1:04:24] and to be made flesh in the bride just
[1:04:28] like the world was made flesh in Christ
[1:04:34] that is the reason why he want to have
[1:04:37] the preeminence that's the reason why I
[1:04:46] will he want to have the preeminence now
[1:04:53] if you if you look over also in the book
[1:04:55] of the the book of Joshua you will see a
[1:05:04] little bit of what we read over in in
[1:05:09] the Book of Numbers so the picture here
[1:05:14] that I want I want I want us to see is
[1:05:16] the other God confirming the promise to
[1:05:21] Abraham he's assuring Abraham that you
[1:05:26] will have the sea and he's telling
[1:05:30] Abraham what is going to happen to the
[1:05:32] seed when this seed come forth it's
[1:05:35] going to travel in a strange Lane and
[1:05:38] it's going to come back to this very
[1:05:41] place where I give this promise to you
[1:05:44] but before they get back to this place
[1:05:46] there will be people on the road to
[1:05:49] handle him God has given the promise
[1:05:55] just like we read over here in looking
[1:06:02] away to Jesus all of these five teams
[1:06:05] that brother Branham talked about that
[1:06:07] is the manifestation of the temple he
[1:06:10] said we're going to see it what we saw
[1:06:13] temporarily happening in his ministry is
[1:06:15] going to come to a time word is going to
[1:06:18] happen in this bride ministry but we
[1:06:23] need to get to that place it's not
[1:06:27] something word when the squeeze come
[1:06:29] automatically we will start who we will
[1:06:32] start a manifesting the ministry of the
[1:06:35] table no we have to be to that place
[1:06:38] and then what is stopping us from from
[1:06:43] getting to that place Jesus said because
[1:06:46] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:06:49] shall was called so just like how the
[1:06:53] the iniquity of the arm arise was
[1:06:56] stopping Israel from getting over to
[1:06:59] their promise that is the same way the
[1:07:01] iniquity in this age is Henry us the
[1:07:06] message is just what people caught and
[1:07:08] they argue we know all of these things
[1:07:10] but we are living in an hour what where
[1:07:12] we need it now
[1:07:19] praise Lord we saw it on an honor on
[1:07:23] Erik honor every Elijah ministry they
[1:07:27] had a time of honey and God they not
[1:07:31] only there with the messenger in their
[1:07:35] age the messenger benefited from it and
[1:07:38] the people that believed his message
[1:07:40] also benefited for me honor
[1:07:43] Elijah ministry it was Elijah and a
[1:07:46] widow and her son on Elijah ministry
[1:07:49] there was another widow and her two boys
[1:07:51] that was going to be so they benefited
[1:07:54] from the ministry the supernatural I was
[1:07:57] in Elijah ministry the benefit it is so
[1:07:59] all their vessels before they pay all
[1:08:02] their death they were able to live and
[1:08:04] enjoy the rest of the alive from the
[1:08:06] benefit of their ministry so bourbon is
[1:08:11] literally saying all the things that we
[1:08:13] have heard on tape it's not only going
[1:08:17] to be on table is going to happen in our
[1:08:19] mess but we have to be to a place for us
[1:08:24] to experience those things the other I
[1:08:32] mean the message of Christianity you
[1:08:34] know it's not is it's not just like you
[1:08:36] find out what other religion you find
[1:08:38] people they have been giving setting
[1:08:40] prayers where they reside to recite the
[1:08:42] recited recite they memorize it they
[1:08:44] recite I mean they can come to the
[1:08:46] excellent of their religion when it
[1:08:48] knows how to memorize those things right
[1:08:50] from
[1:08:50] they sleep they don't have to read it
[1:08:52] from the book but for us it's not only
[1:08:55] to memorize it the word want to live
[1:08:58] through us praise the Lord
[1:09:03] that's what the tear food is this
[1:09:10] message has created a brine out of these
[1:09:17] years this word has transformed a people
[1:09:24] this word has been implanted in us out
[1:09:32] of these years we've been hearing the
[1:09:34] message on tapes we've been hearing it
[1:09:36] from different five-four ministry the
[1:09:38] purpose the thing that God been desiring
[1:09:44] to achieve is to have a people that is
[1:09:47] pregnant with the word that is above
[1:09:49] that that would bring for the word it's
[1:09:52] gonna be Christ in bright form we are
[1:09:55] not going to bring for a son that would
[1:09:57] be separated from our body but we're
[1:09:59] going to bring a son that is going to be
[1:10:01] living in our body just like Paul said
[1:10:04] it's not I deliver but it's Christ that
[1:10:06] livery me that is the purpose of this
[1:10:10] message God
[1:10:18] has been preparing us through the
[1:10:21] different trials that we have gone
[1:10:23] through whether is our personal trial
[1:10:25] whether it's a church trial whether it's
[1:10:28] a contract trial I mean many countries
[1:10:30] have gone through their trials you know
[1:10:32] saving the Lord in the time of war in
[1:10:35] the time of farming in a time of flawed
[1:10:36] I mean the bride has gone through
[1:10:38] everything some through the water some
[1:10:41] through the fire some through the storm
[1:10:43] but we all have been going through the
[1:10:46] blood because the life is in the blood
[1:10:49] so no matter what our trial is he's
[1:10:53] putting us through the blood for us to
[1:10:55] be able to bring for that crash like
[1:10:57] nature ready for the moment what would
[1:11:03] the moment what we saw in his ministry
[1:11:07] temporarily for it to be right before us
[1:11:12] not to guess what we would do we know
[1:11:15] what to do praise the Lord we know what
[1:11:21] to do in that moment but Branham says
[1:11:23] right in their in their term in that in
[1:11:26] that room he says you could feed the
[1:11:28] presence of the Lord he said brother Ben
[1:11:30] would you were there when when sister
[1:11:32] hell you I said that you can feed the
[1:11:35] presence of the Lord she had a sick
[1:11:37] sister she had a tall mother and she was
[1:11:42] very poor her husband have died where
[1:11:46] BAM says she was just a farmer living on
[1:11:48] two hundred dollars a month because of
[1:11:54] the atmosphere because of the time there
[1:11:57] was nothing different she could ask for
[1:12:01] when she asked for the salvation of her
[1:12:04] sons that was the right thing she asked
[1:12:06] for so what is God doing he's preparing
[1:12:09] or putting us to the place word we will
[1:12:11] speak the right thing
[1:12:13] we were desire the right thing we would
[1:12:15] think the right thing because we will
[1:12:21] not be filling our mind we're also sub
[1:12:24] negative things and all sorts of foster
[1:12:27] it on the internet there right in a time
[1:12:29] of trial
[1:12:30] you want to say the right thing you
[1:12:32] would not say the right thing at that
[1:12:33] time but when we are feeding our self
[1:12:40] with the word and and and he's giving us
[1:12:42] grace to have the right attitude when we
[1:12:45] go wrong we repent we put our life in
[1:12:48] order
[1:12:49] we don't justify ourself for what we do
[1:12:51] we know that it's wrong we have to
[1:12:53] remember the thing that was keeping
[1:12:56] Israel back is the iniquity of the
[1:12:59] amoeba we're here somewhere he says he
[1:13:02] said God has to even delay the promise
[1:13:05] for two more years just to wait for the
[1:13:11] iniquity of the Amorite
[1:13:14] he said because when Moses went into
[1:13:18] into the wilderness he had to stay for
[1:13:21] two more years he said why did God did
[1:13:23] there he said because the people were
[1:13:25] not ready the people when I read what
[1:13:30] other people the people that was
[1:13:32] supposed to go to the promised land they
[1:13:34] were not ready yet so Moses will make
[1:13:39] you Josh over us you think you know that
[1:13:45] we're better than us brother branham
[1:13:47] share this and better Branham series I
[1:13:49] mean we are using the word to fight we
[1:13:51] are using the word to a hug you but I
[1:13:53] mean we are right at a place now to
[1:13:57] realize that this message is now for us
[1:14:00] to chop one another up this message is
[1:14:02] to prepare people it's to prepare people
[1:14:07] for the hour that we are living in well
[1:14:10] when the brother calls you on the phone
[1:14:12] and and you have the right word to say
[1:14:15] to him you have the right word to say to
[1:14:20] him or if you don't have nothing to say
[1:14:23] you can just listen and said let's pray
[1:14:26] you have the right attitude to be able
[1:14:29] to deal with the situation that comes
[1:14:32] before you that's why he's been
[1:14:34] preparing us for we have the word to
[1:14:39] create the right atmosphere
[1:14:48] all of those things were manifested
[1:14:50] honor the tempo the power of creation
[1:14:53] the power of sedation resurrection
[1:14:57] healing if he gives him power to control
[1:15:05] the storm and system you stay right back
[1:15:07] there and go to where you're coming from
[1:15:09] he can give us power to control touch
[1:15:12] that is flowing to our mind the storm of
[1:15:15] thoughts the storm of our natural nature
[1:15:21] you can say all devil you start right
[1:15:24] there and get out of here that is our
[1:15:32] age that is the time that we are living
[1:15:35] in if it is true that everything that is
[1:15:42] happening is raising up the debt limit
[1:15:45] wish of course is true and it's going to
[1:15:49] put us into that direction wish of
[1:15:53] course that's the direction we are going
[1:15:56] they have much more about with the bride
[1:16:01] we have to be looking into the world
[1:16:04] amen
[1:16:05] he said writing this message she said
[1:16:08] she will know what to do with the word
[1:16:11] praise the Lord she will know what to do
[1:16:15] with the word children of the promise
[1:16:20] that's the hour that we are living in
[1:16:29] this word will be made flesh once again
[1:16:33] remember that brother Branham says it
[1:16:36] cannot be person impersonated no you can
[1:16:39] put it on it's not a dress that you can
[1:16:43] worry it's not a dress that you can
[1:16:47] worry it's a nature that puts you on you
[1:16:54] can put it on a puts you on because it's
[1:16:59] a nature that Dwarfs in you for you to
[1:17:04] put it on would be a impersonation but
[1:17:07] for it support you on it's going to be a
[1:17:11] reality it's a life in you in a serious
[1:17:20] he spoke about that little group talks
[1:17:24] about missing length earrings restore
[1:17:27] how can we ever get to that place
[1:17:40] are we talking positive things are we
[1:17:47] having the right kind of encouragement
[1:17:50] are we addressing things by the word are
[1:17:58] we addressing things by the word or are
[1:18:00] we just care how we just care that we
[1:18:03] honor fear it's another thing we just
[1:18:07] honor fear all I need a hole that goes
[1:18:09] all it's a rapture girl no templates
[1:18:12] were all of these things that that's
[1:18:13] happy I mean we should be in that world
[1:18:22] praise the Lord the iniquity of the
[1:18:26] amorous what am i typing tonight her
[1:18:31] been said in feasts of the trumpet he
[1:18:35] said all those 200 million demons he
[1:18:42] said those were the spirit devils from
[1:18:45] the river you freaky he said it stop
[1:18:48] Pentacles from getting to the promise he
[1:18:53] types that just like the amorite the
[1:18:57] Jebusites and all of the nation that
[1:19:00] were there to fight against israel now
[1:19:02] you have to realize these are just
[1:19:04] common people these are just Shepherds I
[1:19:08] mean they they never had a military they
[1:19:12] were just only following the leadership
[1:19:14] of God the pillar of fire by night and a
[1:19:17] pillar of cloud by day and they were
[1:19:19] meeting organized nations all of these
[1:19:24] nations were organized nation they have
[1:19:26] the high King's Moses were sent a worse
[1:19:31] than Joshua and his men carry this word
[1:19:33] to the king just tell him we just want
[1:19:35] to pass through they were not even a
[1:19:40] nation they were not even I mean a
[1:19:42] people like other nations having King
[1:19:45] having a constitution or they were
[1:19:48] following it just a lot of God but there
[1:19:51] was something about these people the
[1:19:53] other nation
[1:19:54] we're afraid to allow them to pass
[1:19:55] through they are telling them we were
[1:19:59] not taking your land we're not drinking
[1:20:01] your water we just want to pass through
[1:20:03] the fear is there if the past rule I
[1:20:07] mean we don't know what will happen I
[1:20:09] mean they create darkness over Egypt who
[1:20:11] know what they are bringing upon us
[1:20:13] problem says that's a problem with the
[1:20:16] people today they are afraid what the
[1:20:18] Holy Ghost is going to do to them yeah
[1:20:21] they are just afraid how the baptism of
[1:20:25] the holy ghost is just going to rob them
[1:20:26] of every ward eNOS I'm telling you it's
[1:20:30] not going to take anything good from you
[1:20:35] [Laughter]
[1:20:37] it's just going to bless everything good
[1:20:40] you have when the Holy Ghost comes it
[1:20:43] takes everything that you don't want it
[1:20:47] takes it away so they were afraid of
[1:20:52] Israel but yet God please those people
[1:20:58] in your Wayne for Israel to be able to
[1:21:02] fix them to deal with them as they go on
[1:21:04] to their promise remember he gave them a
[1:21:07] promise that I will be with you I was
[1:21:10] saying on that before you he says I sent
[1:21:13] my angel before you he get them out of
[1:21:18] this promise
[1:21:22] first of all he gave them all of these
[1:21:26] promises and Israel just going I mean it
[1:21:30] they carry their young they carry their
[1:21:32] old I mean they are on camera back Shane
[1:21:35] I mean they are traveling all of these
[1:21:38] people but here there was something in
[1:21:41] the mists of them in your heart I mean
[1:21:48] you go around and see all of these
[1:21:50] nations and see how they are built and
[1:21:52] the walls that they have and if you're
[1:21:54] saying we come o people how can we get
[1:21:56] through this but God has given them a
[1:21:58] promise he said with a mighty hand that
[1:22:03] was what he said to Abraham I would come
[1:22:05] down and with a mighty
[1:22:07] him I would bring them to this promise
[1:22:09] to this Lane and that's where we are
[1:22:16] that's our promise people that will be
[1:22:21] able to experience a talking life a
[1:22:27] person I will be able to experience such
[1:22:30] a peace in their heart they can say as
[1:22:33] as much as I know to the best of my
[1:22:35] knowledge there is no evil thought in my
[1:22:41] heart against anybody can get to the
[1:22:45] place and say to the best of my
[1:22:47] knowledge there is not anybody that I'm
[1:22:49] holding anything against the people that
[1:22:54] will be able to experience that that's
[1:22:56] our promise that is the land that we are
[1:22:59] coming to is God possessing this body
[1:23:07] and that was the reason why he gave us a
[1:23:11] son of man ministry he got one man in
[1:23:15] age and he waved him over us he brought
[1:23:21] him to the level of life that there are
[1:23:23] other sons and daughters that are coming
[1:23:26] to that place we will learn how to
[1:23:30] reference God we will learn how to
[1:23:33] listen to his voice
[1:23:42] can you imagine we're branches after he
[1:23:45] didn't listen to God for the first time
[1:23:47] he had to go many years with our God
[1:23:52] speaking to him he had to go many years
[1:23:58] he was stay preaching but he just knew
[1:24:00] that there was something missing I need
[1:24:03] to get back to that place and many of us
[1:24:06] we can look in our lives and says I need
[1:24:09] to get back to that place a son of God a
[1:24:15] daughter of God I have ever experienced
[1:24:18] the grace of God in their life they know
[1:24:22] what it is when it's missing we know
[1:24:26] what it is when prayer is missing we
[1:24:28] know what it is when worship is missing
[1:24:30] we know what it is when truth joy is
[1:24:33] missing we may put up the face but we
[1:24:36] know what it is because we have drunk of
[1:24:39] that wine before so I'm bringing the
[1:24:45] iniquity of the Amorite here in a type
[1:24:48] of the things that are Henry us crisis
[1:24:57] the measure of God reveal where Benham
[1:25:00] says he want to reveal himself to us but
[1:25:03] we are letting this we are let him dead
[1:25:05] we are letting this other thing to stand
[1:25:08] in the way God has been preparing us for
[1:25:15] this hour this very hour where we are
[1:25:20] coming down to and all of the things
[1:25:22] that are happening around us we must be
[1:25:29] able to have an attitude when you talk
[1:25:34] with a loved one on the phone or you
[1:25:36] talk with a co-worker or you talk with
[1:25:40] you know just a stranger and it just
[1:25:43] like everything because everything that
[1:25:45] people talks about you listening to the
[1:25:47] news you listen to the read I mean
[1:25:48] everything is just driving to the place
[1:25:50] of being negative
[1:25:55] but you can be able to take an attitude
[1:25:57] after you have listening to all of that
[1:25:59] to be able to bring them a sign of hope
[1:26:03] you can be able to bring them a little
[1:26:09] release when you tell somebody I'll be
[1:26:13] praying for you you just see the light
[1:26:15] that goes on in the eyes thank you thank
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:22] something happy just this evening I was
[1:26:25] coming to work and with with the with
[1:26:32] the flights flying over today the people
[1:26:35] from the global markets um I mean I
[1:26:37] don't know whether it was some of the
[1:26:39] food places they had a little food in
[1:26:42] the eggs and they were giving it to the
[1:26:43] health worker so I was bathing in and
[1:26:47] one of the boys did he said well how
[1:26:50] long so I never ate their food would you
[1:26:52] like it first ice I wait I was going I
[1:26:57] said no but then I said no I would take
[1:27:00] it so I went I took it from his desk I
[1:27:02] said well I would just keep it in my car
[1:27:04] and then when I get you know on the road
[1:27:07] and and you know meet any of these
[1:27:09] people standing on the road give it to
[1:27:10] him so I kept it in my vehicle and just
[1:27:14] on my way to church in orders that's a
[1:27:17] kind of a turn up there you know from 94
[1:27:20] I was trying to do a turn and just come
[1:27:22] on the road and I was not even thinking
[1:27:24] about it because I was listening to a
[1:27:26] message while I was driving but I just
[1:27:28] came right under the red light and a
[1:27:31] moment I turned my head I saw the young
[1:27:33] man standing across the road with a sign
[1:27:36] in his hand I mean it's just happy but
[1:27:39] scared I mean it happened in such a when
[1:27:41] I was surprised of myself I saw him I
[1:27:43] just reached them I took the bag I ain't
[1:27:45] it out he ran he collected therefrom I
[1:27:48] mean it happened so quick and and i
[1:27:51] fairly myself i said it looks like this
[1:27:55] bag was just ordained for this point
[1:27:57] because i was not thinking about it i
[1:27:59] had there there was almost like i forgot
[1:28:01] about it and it just happened so quick
[1:28:06] that is just
[1:28:08] that is just kind of a natural physical
[1:28:12] example but I'm talking about any time
[1:28:15] of need
[1:28:16] I mean when somebody is just is just
[1:28:20] trying their frustration at you and yet
[1:28:23] I mean just trying the I heard at you
[1:28:26] and they are just throwing everything at
[1:28:28] you are we going to be like Harry right
[1:28:32] you see the right word praise the Lord
[1:28:37] Berta Brennaman their storm he says I'm
[1:28:40] a god I will never be lost
[1:28:44] praise the Lord
[1:28:46] and he tried to find his way he tried to
[1:28:49] find his way and he realized that the
[1:28:51] storm was coming what he did but would
[1:28:53] be like brother branham to realize that
[1:28:55] no this thing these choices we are
[1:28:57] making this way we are dealing with this
[1:28:59] situation he said I have to come to the
[1:29:01] place where I made Lord I need your help
[1:29:15] resurrection of the little fish bird
[1:29:16] random talks about brother banks cool
[1:29:18] brother he says the night before when he
[1:29:22] met brother branham had told him
[1:29:24] something where been deserted him and he
[1:29:29] says well I think banks told him that
[1:29:33] praise the Lord he says in his mind now
[1:29:37] he says he says I think banks told him
[1:29:40] there and then verbatim says well if you
[1:29:44] think he told me in there was about last
[1:29:46] night when I man almost shot you with a
[1:29:50] gun he said nobody would know that
[1:29:54] because he was just in a situation where
[1:29:56] he what lost his life and where burns
[1:30:00] say he had to escape through the window
[1:30:03] praise the Lord I mean just giving him
[1:30:09] the right word what he needs God has
[1:30:16] been training us for this for this hour
[1:30:20] for this time that we are living in
[1:30:26] remember where benches it cannot be
[1:30:28] impersonated you don't have to make up
[1:30:30] something you can just hold someone by
[1:30:33] the hands and just weep with him you
[1:30:35] know I was listening to to something and
[1:30:39] listening to a radio program and it was
[1:30:44] saying is it sometimes when you go to -
[1:30:48] I mean - - more with somebody or to
[1:30:51] counsel someone if you if you don't have
[1:30:54] words to say just sit with them and just
[1:30:58] crying if you can crime just sit with
[1:31:02] them just that time of sitting with them
[1:31:05] quietly holding them by the hands just
[1:31:12] that time brings a lot of comfort
[1:31:17] instead of trying to make up words you
[1:31:21] know some people try to make up words
[1:31:22] and they enter saying things that hurt
[1:31:24] the person more than helping them
[1:31:32] praise the Lord
[1:31:35] sometimes people just need to digest the
[1:31:39] truth of the moment they are in they
[1:31:42] don't need to hear it again they know
[1:31:44] that God knows all about it
[1:31:46] they know that you know God allow it
[1:31:49] sometimes they just need to just slowly
[1:31:52] that just that truth then when people
[1:31:56] come over and over and say it to them
[1:31:58] over and over and say it today it's a
[1:32:00] truth or sometimes the truth can
[1:32:03] frustrate the person what am I talking
[1:32:09] about where Brenham says washed out
[1:32:13] their food then he says it will be for
[1:32:17] the bride and the church I believe
[1:32:24] that's the hour that we are living in I
[1:32:25] believe we are slowly coming to that
[1:32:27] place this word supposed to affect our
[1:32:33] attitude it's supposed to affect our
[1:32:36] response to situation
[1:32:47] I mean we have been servicing with this
[1:32:49] word and all of the things that we have
[1:32:51] been taking that I mean it's we should
[1:32:54] be to the place where things you now so
[1:32:56] easily get on our sleeves praise the
[1:33:08] Lord I forget to say I have had a
[1:33:14] privilege to speak with our local
[1:33:18] pastors today praise the Lord I just I
[1:33:22] just taught us as well I mean how can we
[1:33:25] be in the same city we can even talk
[1:33:27] with all of these things that is going
[1:33:29] on let me check on these when these
[1:33:33] pastors and see how they are coming on
[1:33:35] how they dealing with things you know I
[1:33:38] mean how we have we preparing for the
[1:33:40] hour that is right before us we have to
[1:33:44] realize that we are in this together and
[1:33:48] we're going to come out stronger that's
[1:33:51] what I believe the bride is going to
[1:33:53] come out stronger this thing is going to
[1:33:55] affect us in such a way that we would
[1:33:58] come out and we might not even recognize
[1:34:00] ourself when we are praying we might not
[1:34:02] recognize ourselves you know when we are
[1:34:04] receiving that word
[1:34:14] because you know sometimes it's so easy
[1:34:18] for us to just flow you know with the
[1:34:23] wave but boring against the current
[1:34:26] that's what is sometimes tough we want
[1:34:34] God to walk upon us but with his brother
[1:34:38] sent me agreed is better done asked me
[1:34:40] to greet every one of us but Paul also
[1:34:43] asked me to read every one of us so we
[1:34:46] are grateful I was glad to know they're
[1:34:47] all doing well praise the Lord amen
[1:34:52] but that's the hour that we are living
[1:34:54] people then that is that is just what's
[1:34:57] on my heart tonight you know just like
[1:35:00] how is really hard to wait for the
[1:35:05] iniquity of the amorite and that's the
[1:35:09] same place where we are something have
[1:35:11] to rise up for us to fully come into
[1:35:14] this but then we will not come into this
[1:35:18] if we are not prepared just like they
[1:35:22] miss it
[1:35:23] Glaus have 400 years and he was right on
[1:35:27] time
[1:35:28] 400 years moses was there but the people
[1:35:31] were not ready so moses had to go back
[1:35:36] in the witness forty years have to add
[1:35:39] on it before moses came back out so you
[1:35:45] see when God is training us and he's
[1:35:48] dealing dealing with us and we are not
[1:35:50] paying attention
[1:35:51] we are only causing a delay for
[1:35:53] ourselves we are causing the delay when
[1:36:01] you think that anger is your nature is
[1:36:03] now your nature is not it does not
[1:36:05] belong to you it came down from one of
[1:36:08] your grandfather and you don't need it
[1:36:10] you don't need it for the table
[1:36:13] manifestation you don't need it for the
[1:36:15] rapture you are not needed for the
[1:36:16] Millennial you don't need it for
[1:36:18] internet it so get rid of it now but
[1:36:22] when a person thing all you know that's
[1:36:24] my nature that's my weakness you
[1:36:26] just creating a delay he cannot move you
[1:36:33] to the next place
[1:36:39] so what God have to do he has to give
[1:36:43] Moses a sign he has to give Moses
[1:36:45] something supernatural even though the
[1:36:48] people stay hard I think that doubt in
[1:36:51] their mind about Moses but when Moses
[1:36:54] came with the supernatural that can
[1:36:56] identify them with God they were ready
[1:36:59] to follow the supernatural when he saw
[1:37:02] the plague coming down on Egypt they
[1:37:04] were ready to run run right over to
[1:37:06] Moses and Aaron and say what what did
[1:37:08] Allah want us to do
[1:37:09] Oh last night you said applied the block
[1:37:12] on the lane tail I was at the right one
[1:37:14] or the left one they were ready to ask
[1:37:16] question because they saw that he had a
[1:37:19] word of the law for the Abbaye and we
[1:37:28] don't have to look for it the word of
[1:37:30] the Lord for our day has been right
[1:37:33] before us we've been listening to eight
[1:37:38] preachers being re-echoing this word to
[1:37:41] us the only thing that is keeping us
[1:37:48] from stepping into their for promise is
[1:37:52] our iniquity of the animal rights praise
[1:38:03] the Lord that's the thing that was
[1:38:07] stopping Israel and God showed Abraham
[1:38:12] so God had is showing it to us he show
[1:38:16] Abraham in the promise
[1:38:18] why because Israel need to deal with
[1:38:21] that and whatever is stopping you you
[1:38:25] need to deal with it you need to face it
[1:38:34] their weakness is whatever it is you
[1:38:39] need to face it you need to deal with it
[1:38:41] there's no time to glorify witnesses
[1:38:45] glorify scene there's no time for that
[1:38:49] it's time were Paul say we must we must
[1:38:52] we must hate the very appearance of it
[1:38:55] David said we must hit it with pepper
[1:38:58] hate rain you must get so angry with it
[1:39:03] because all it's doing is just robbing
[1:39:06] you from stepping over into your promise
[1:39:13] this whole egos have fullness of joy
[1:39:16] that can flow through you have you ever
[1:39:18] seen someone laughing and you don't know
[1:39:20] what they're laughing about you just are
[1:39:22] laughing I mean it just they're just
[1:39:26] laughing cracking up you don't know what
[1:39:29] the fun is but it just affected you and
[1:39:32] you start laughing I mean there is just
[1:39:35] so much joy here there is so much
[1:39:39] happiness here there is just so much
[1:39:42] things we can enjoy in these holy girls
[1:39:44] in such a depressing time there is just
[1:39:49] so much in God that we can enjoy and we
[1:39:57] just give us a burden for people that
[1:40:00] are hurting out there we can think about
[1:40:03] them we can pray for them because I'm
[1:40:06] telling you when when you are in a
[1:40:08] depressed situation is hard for you to
[1:40:10] pray you know but so when you are in a
[1:40:16] place where you can be able to
[1:40:18] experience the law of the joy the
[1:40:20] happiness of God then stretch out your
[1:40:23] prayer wings for others that are out
[1:40:25] there they need it he said these things
[1:40:30] that you see temporarily it's going to
[1:40:35] manifest when you see God
[1:40:40] have to bring him through a first pool
[1:40:42] and what did brother branham say he said
[1:40:44] both for the first pool and the second
[1:40:47] pool he said I made mistakes because why
[1:40:49] God told me not to explain it but
[1:40:51] brother Branham over and over he tried
[1:40:54] to explain it to the people to convince
[1:40:56] him this life of Christ he would not be
[1:41:02] able to convince people when Christ is
[1:41:06] living his life through you you will not
[1:41:08] be able to the son comes it does not
[1:41:10] convince you it just shines you know
[1:41:14] people talking oh the Sun is too hot his
[1:41:16] son it does not matter the song is this
[1:41:19] woo well what happened is honestly it
[1:41:21] does not bother the Sun and the
[1:41:24] scripture says the heaven declared the
[1:41:27] glory of God it comes out and do what
[1:41:33] the father one is to do it declare the
[1:41:35] glory of God and that is the same way
[1:41:38] something daughter of God was supposed
[1:41:39] to be
[1:41:51] that's our promise we are children of
[1:41:55] the promise it's not just a title we
[1:41:59] have a promise we have a word for our
[1:42:02] day that we have to walk into the our
[1:42:06] word has to live itself through us and
[1:42:13] we have to be prepared for it how can we
[1:42:18] do it by giving him the preeminence him
[1:42:21] having the first place in our lives
[1:42:23] submitting ourselves to the word so made
[1:42:25] in ourselves to one another allowing God
[1:42:30] that he will live that word through us
[1:42:35] out of your belly will flow rivers of
[1:42:39] water that's a promise
[1:42:41] even before the Holy Ghost was given
[1:42:44] that's why Jesus said unto the church so
[1:42:48] that is the same thing that is before us
[1:42:51] remember those five manifestation the
[1:42:58] creative power salvation resurrection of
[1:43:02] the little fish healing those are the
[1:43:06] things that should be seen among us and
[1:43:13] those things comes from God himself
[1:43:18] it's a proof that God it's among the
[1:43:21] people Paul says if your own believer
[1:43:23] comes among you and see those things
[1:43:26] happening he would say God is in your
[1:43:28] mess and that's what God wants to be
[1:43:35] seen he told Moses build me in the
[1:43:38] tabernacle so I will come and ward among
[1:43:41] you he inhabit our praise he want to
[1:43:49] inhabit our tops he want to inhabit our
[1:43:53] words he want to inhabit our desire he
[1:43:57] want to inhabit our actions and our
[1:44:00] reactions
[1:44:03] he want to feel every fiber of our body
