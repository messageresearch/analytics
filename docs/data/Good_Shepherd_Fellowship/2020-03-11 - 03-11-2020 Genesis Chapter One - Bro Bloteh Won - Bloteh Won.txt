Genesis chapter 1 it's gonna be in the house of the Lord and we will see each and every one of yours is to be able to see you and want to thank the Lord for granting you a safe trip home and back I go to see butter Sam and his family back there praise the Lord we are so grateful to be girls children Genesis chapter 1 tonight let's read in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth Saint John chapter 1 Saint John chapter 1 see John chapter one praise the Lord st. John chapter 1 let's take verse 1 as well in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God let's pray together father we approached your internal Word because I've just declared unto us Lord that a word is God and Father you are antenna come and speak to us tonight Lord God I pray you will the Holy Spirit will move upon the inspiration on our house tonight law to be able to strengthen your children strengthen each and every one of us in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord Allah bless you we have a lot of scriptures who have we'll be running through tonight so have your Bible Hindi maybe the people our system back then will be able to help us to project some of those scriptures I [Music] realized I was speaking I don't know were there you know word the the inspiration came from on Sunday morning I really never thought that we would have had a service for prayer lining but I think it was necessary for us to rededicate ourselves over and over to the Lord amen and it was such a blessing on Sunday what I was speaking I realized make mention on on on Genesis chapter one never had a time to go into eight I don't know if if you know it went over your head or if you if you cut it and then it almost looks like it was it was a kind of a scary thing to say so I decided I'll go go over what I said when I was trying to differentiate between Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 praise the Lord so I want to take that tonight acts that the law would just be able to bring his blessing the Pony praise the Lord Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we just read that the scripture says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth praise the Lord we want to thank the Lord for His manifold blessings and all the things that His grace is doing upon our life we we are so grateful praise the Lord amen but as we look at this subject tonight what actually I was trying to to speak on and for us to be able to see here is there Genesis chapter 1 if you remember this story Becky I don't know if you have my notes there but if you remember the story from spoken word is the original Sieber Branham share 1962 he said my daughter back there Rebecca was saying daddy in school we proved that that there are millions and millions of years this word is all then isn't that contradictory to the Bible he said no sir I said it isn't the different studies of rocks information and you know in other things and so forth there is dropping of millions of years and God said he made heaven and the earth in one 24-hour doesn't that miss prove or disprove the Bible I said no if you will notice telling Moses about the Bible which mean God revealing to Moses what happened in the beginning because we know that Moses is the one that wrote it telling Moses about the Bible he said in the beginning God created the heaven in the earth period are we together amen God created the heaven and the earth period how long it took that's none of our business then he goes ahead and began to bring in his time of potencies in the earth but in the beginning might have been hundreds of billions of trillions of years all of time but God created the heaven and the earth period praise the Lord and then if you if you were also studied you will realize there are all the great scholars of the Bible when they did reference to that beginning and what the reference to is a lot of the scriptures that we will be looking at tonight because you said a lot of things that brother Branham said and sometimes we ask as people you know believing the message it looks like you know he said it is just an astral revelation and there is just no place to put it in the scripture praise the Lord now you remember when when Vittel LaDuke prophesied over brother Branham after preaching what brother Branham preached he said brother Branham what you preach could be placed at the back of the last chapter of the book of Revelation to be the 2012 enemies no it's not supposed to be so because it's written in the word and no man you are or no man shoes Oh track amen he says even those things that are revealed in the in the seals he says they cannot be anything out of the Bible there has to be right in the scripture praise the Lord Amen so we want to look a few of those things tonight if the Lord gives us Grace and one of the place that we will we will try to hold on till tonight is you will see over and over as we look in the scripture you will see this word coming up that is called the foundation of the word praise the Lord and what is the foundation what is the foundation the foundation is the beginning so every word where the scripture said before the foundation of the word is right in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 anything that happened at the foundation of the world is phone right in Genesis when the land wrote your name on the last book of life from the foundation of the word is in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 are we together praise the Lord that is the reason why the scripture does not contradict itself that is the reason why the scripture does not confuse us because God knew exactly what he was saying the foundation of anything is the beginning so when the scripture says in the beginning God created having a lot of death year and some few codes that we will also have to look at tonight and I was looking at one year Berta Branham says he would in 1964 he says God take a picture of you when they God did there Genesis chapter 1 first one if what he said is structured they have to be in the Bible are we together he says God take a picture of you or now no matter how old or wrinkled how this figure whatever it will be that will win right on down true and that body may be destroyed this figure burned it of Alliance whatever it is but it was made up it was made above of gases cysteine element of the earth that was calcium he called all of those elements like cosmic light and sofa now no matter the whole earth is filled with death but now this picture is the me think amen then in the resurrection those gases in Isaacson and teens comes right back again and then he plays he developed the picture again now so we will see few of those things here like I said I'm just trying to to speed up a little bit let me let me start there in in the structure as we want to go quickly tonight if the lord help us am chapter [Music] 18 verse 15 praise the Lord then actually it's a sign of David you realize that David said they're back in in second samuel chapter 22 verse 8 sam chapter 18 verse 15 there's a reason why i'm i want us to look at all of these things he says year then the chiness of the water was seen and the foundation of the world was discovered there Adar rebuke all Lord had ad the blast of the birth of the nostris Amen praise the Lord but we know like like the scripture said or we being taught by the Prophet the oldest book in the Bible is the book of Job and job chapter 38 we see right there in the scripture where God was axing job where were you you know when the sons of God shouted for joy amen from the foundation of the world praise the Lord so all of these things all of these things you know where I will go through the scriptures I mean I'm having a lot of them listed down here that we can we can all run through and see here Matthew chapter 13 verse 35 Jesus said there were secrets that were hate since the foundation of the world Matthew chapter 25 verse 34 he says fear not little flawed is your father good will to give you the kingdom that was prepared for you from the foundation of the world when they all of these things happen Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 praise the Lord amen Luke chapter 11 verse 15 you know what Jesus even talks about how the you know the prophets how men would die for this gospel they shared their blood so if you write that in his mind he was looking down through time I were together in Fisher in chapter 1 verse 4 we were choosing in him from the foundation of the world right there Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 Hebrews 11 no hebrews chapter 4 verse 3 the scripture says his works were finished from the foundation of the world God created the heaven and the earth are we together amen now there are other scriptures also that speaks about a time that we cannot place after the Garden of Eden where can we place that let's look a few of the few of those tonight we read a one on Sunday there was war in heaven when did that took place as Isle chapter 14 verse 12 we know that that is all connected with Revelation chapter 12 speaking about the reward in heaven when Satan Lucifer grew proud and he wanted to to ascend himself above the stars of God how Jairus Isaiah the prophet speaking about that you know hundreds of years what can we place there amen that did not happen after adenine affair there have been before adenine affair praise the Lord let me read something to you here if mm-hm praise the Lord okay he loved the law tonight okay what does it takes to make a crease in life let's take before there was a beginning of the world now the lady comfort from the earth so did you if they'd be so then we will hear our bodies were on the earth before there was any life here we are made of 16 different elements of the earth all of these elements chasm and cosmic light and so forth held together by atom system element and then if their wish which scientifically is sold our body were lying spread out on this earth before there was any type of life on the earth praise the Lord he says yet he said and as the volcanic he says that bursted in formed the material of the earth and so far see is just a a burning brimstone as it was set on possession as he walked up and down there are fairy brain stones of the earth and then when God cool it off and set it over a year in his great mind he has something in his mind that he was going to do praise the Lord in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God now a word is a thought express God had in his mind what he had in his mind what to do but when he expressed it it had to come into existence to become a reality because it was God's word Express praise Lord that they on cavalry he also says he he says the very rock that he wants walk up and down on the earth burning brimstone Lucifer was the son of the morning and he walked on the earth when it was a burning volcano those same rocks that her cool off when Jesus they had a cavalry bridge fall out of the earth praise the Lord now with with with this thought in what Berber enemy seen here and we go back to what as I said in in the book of Isaiah how are they are falling or Lucifer son of the morning praise the Lord amen we realized that a job chapter 1 when when the Bible says when the sons of God presented himself and and yeah he comes in Sicily where they are from Lucifer he sees up and down through our other earth back and forth and what of you now so what what I'm trying to bring forth to us tonight is to be able to see that just like brother Branham said God give this this whole Genesis chapter one story that we have he gave it to Moses in a form of a vision I mean and like I said on solid visions are so fast just like dreams because it's a ram is it is the realm of the subconscious praise the Lord Amen it's something that you know that that is able to play out out of your life in just two minutes or two seconds like birdbrain m-series and you can just dream or you can just see a vision of what is going to happen and just in that short space of time so that is the same way between two verses in the Bible it can hold hundreds of years praise the Lord between just two phrases in the Bible it can hold thousands of years right in between them that's what Burt Branham says God says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth period it might have talked hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years I will together praise the Lord amen the scripture also says the Revelation chapter 3 let's look at this also as we deal with these with this beginning year Revelation chapter 3 when the scripture addresses our age in verse 14 unto the Angel of the Church of Loudy to write these things said they amen they're faithful and the truth witness the beginning of the creation of God it was right back to Genesis chapter 1 it was a it was a very same thing that John referred to because he's the one that there had this experience on the island of Patmos he's the one coming out of there he's referring to the very same thing in us in John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God sometimes we can run it on our lives in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God but in a way that John is expressing what he's saying in a way that he's expressing what is being revealed to him praise the Lord in the beginning was the word praise the Lord and the Word was with God and the Word was God let us let's take something your brother branham said he said question-and-answer on Genesis he said now God gave himself birth or he gave birth to himself if we want to we want to kind of speak it in the way that you we can understand it God gave himself birth to this son which was before there was even an atom in the beginning was the word the Word was with God he says seed jesus said glorify me father with the glory that are hard before the foundation of the world back in Genesis chapter 1 amen see we're back yonder now in st. John 1 he said in the beginning now so brother Branham is here what is he doing he's trying to interpret the scripture in the beginning was the word what happened there that was the beginning of the creation of God and what is the beginning of the creation of God God gave birth to himself and all of that took place in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we have not got to verse 2 yet praise the Lord the lamb wrote your name on the lamb book of life Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 Satan has not come to the scene yet when he comes to the scene that's where there is darkness and in water all over the earth then there's a sign of judgment but there was things that were happening right at that time that he don't know nothing about oh how we can trust this all book man how we can trust this Bible and we can just fall in love with it are we together he says now Genesis chapter 1 you know he's he's taking that breath of God he's bringing everything together now let me drop down a little bit here this is Wednesday night he says now notice me now when this was first formed now watch the little hallow that is that that light that logos he says now I can see it move out to this earth and get over on top of it and begin to move it over close to the Sun now Paul in a book of collusion which says everything was created by him and who was this him this logos the hollow of life that the the form that the bane that came out of God because God is the great intent of spirit praise the Lord are we together I knew as soon as you see it you enjoy it because it's speaking about you it belongs to you he says and when it begins to melt and the great galaxies and then he talks about all of the earth then he drops down here he says then now we get in Genesis 1 we get to the Bible now out of our picture at the Bible Genesis 1 the Word was with our form and Val praise the Lord so actually actually if we were to write about time in the end and in the beginning of time our Bible must actually start from Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 praise the Lord because what God expresses here what what what what he pour out like like even better Branham says he says even when the scripture said in the beginning God he says he was not even God at that time he was great Elohim well he became God because he had been to worship Him so when did that happen all right there in Genesis it all pop right there in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 praise the Lord Jesus s secret here from the foundation of the world even over in in the Old Testament jeremiah spoke about it as i spoke about it you know they all pointed to a time like he said as i said he spread the heavens like a curtain he spread the heavens like a curtain and all of these things Paul says he choose us in him before the foundation of the world amen Peter said in first Peter chapter 1 verse 20 that he for ordained us at the foundation of the world praise the Lord John said in the book of Revelation that names were written on the lamb book of life from the foundation of the world praise the Lord amen you know what I know face and I was I was here there this afternoon studying a little bathing and just praying and just letting me do something and it's kind of a struck me praise the Lord you know how interruption when you are talking and you are you you have been interrupted it's not a good thing for him and it confuses us praise the Lord but God works in the interruption praise the Lord sometimes he brings out the most beautiful picture you remember the woman with the blood issue he was interrupted he said would touch me praise the Lord he was preaching one time having a great revival and pretty soon he saw hearing the zing they started breaking the singing and everything but watch now what Jesus was speaking was never recorded but the interruption was recorded you never give us the same oh he was pretty crazy Amen now Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 comes out and god yes I mean Moses just related I mean it happened so fast with what are the things that will happen he just wrote in the beginning God created heaven and earth all the things that happen he's just put it into that phrase but see the rest of the account was the interruption the efforts with our form darkness was upon the deep the water covered the earth praise the Lord Amen then you see them in science and main in your mind they are rustling all over their to show a big bang that exploded to show audibly I mean they had just caught up they confused interruption will always confuse me God is not confused I mean he's not confused you think about young Mary she was about 18 years I mean just a young girl I mean she she kept her mind pure care for life pure and and just at a time of her wedding it was interrupted God created an interruption and in the whole Judea went crazy I mean a newspaper were exploring it all this this this woman says she saw an angel I mean they were just trying to make a story out of it he called yourself my goodness we just love the Lord that's why the scripture says everything worked together for good to them that love the Lord because God is not confused by the interruption the things that seems like your life being interrupted or things is happening and you don't understand God is not confused by there praise Lord you know you look at these things and yeah I mean used you you studied in and I mean you look into the word it just kind of a blow your mind I was looking at this to see all the things that God did right back there I mean and like where banister question and answer in Genesis he says every every son of God every child of God was represented in that birth of the logos that is the reason why on a date of Pentecost God displayed it by putting light on all of them that was in the upper room - sure that they all had a representation in that great ball of light that was moving in the beginning I would to get him and see the way he said it here he said when that boy was moving he said it was just like a try playing I the first tool of the Father and you and myself was represented a Amen yes that's the reason why that's where we find our joy and our strength when when I mean when that truth connection comes between you and the Father you can play religion you can play church you will really not be able to - I mean to enjoy it but when that truth experiencing that true relationship whether is through trials or difficulties you can still find joy because there was there isn't representation cha playing at the first step of the Father you were represented in there I was representing every son and daughter of God was representing there amen brother Branham says and he took your picture when you were at your best that's what everything that is happening down yet it does not bother him because he took your picture when you were at your best and Jesus comes back and says don't touch one of those little ones because they are angel behold the face of the Father praise the Lord Amen now you see that God placed those things in his word not just to excite us amen he placed those things in his in in in the word and here evade them to us as we as we go along in our relationship with him so we can be able to give more trust that he have it in control praise the Lord he's not just leaving us or letting us to do anything we want to do and we just go in now you know but but he's in control praise the Lord he's in control that's a reason why bird branch is under the seal one of the one of the mystery that was revealed was internal security what is that internal security Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 those thing he did before the curse came he put your name on the lamb book of life the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the Father good will to give you the kingdom before the foundation all of those things were done for your security that's the reason why he says all the father has given me will come now 1 are we lost not one I would lost so just like Moses giving us this account just imagine all of those things the lamb slain from the foundation of the world John talked about it and and and and and Paul talked about he chose us from the foundation I mean all of those things that I spread out there in the scripture I mean a Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 37 as ayah 51 verse 13 all of these scriptures speaks about the foundation of the world but yet Moses put it in those few words in the beginning God created the heaven and he deaf praise the Lord he put he he locked all of those things just aimed their sentence in the beginning God created the heaven in the earth and God revealed a little year to Paul and he revealed a little year to Zacharias he revealed a little year and a prophet comes on the scene he revealed a little to him and says God took a picture of you it's not just a scene it's in the scripture I would together because you see the thing about it there is there that's reverberation chapter 12 I write I wrote all of these scriptures here having a whole page of scriptures down here we should go through it I mean it would be good to go through them but let's let just let just rear evolution chapter tour we are just in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 we have not even gone verse 2 year praise the Lord Amen do you know we can just take that one verse and go right into the rapture with it just Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 if you just are loving that verse and just as seeing God in that verse seeing your redemption in that verse seeing your predestination in that word that's all you need to make the rapture you don't need to know the whole Bible praise the Lord the scripture says here Revelation chapter 12 the Bible talks about this reading from verse 70 from if I'm right reading from verse you read there from verse 1 it goes along verse 4 comes and he says his tail the tail of this dragon drew the tail parts of the stars of heaven and and and they cast them to the earth amen and the dragon stood before the woman now you just think about that the time he drew the tear apart of the skies where was that you take us right back over again to as I up to 12 were he deceived the angels I mean he deceived the angels just like we were talking about Jam welfare that was where James begin because what is James demons what are demons fallen angels they never kept their first estate and when did that happen right between Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 right in between they praise the Lord are we together he drew the third part of the stars of heaven verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought with his angel and prevalent Ned neither was there neither was their place found any more in heaven as I bring it out they were cast to the earth amen and what did the scripture says this these are the people that troubled the earth how did the trouble the earth in the form of sickness diseases coronavirus praise the Lord amen they are just spirits that are rolling over they are just rolling over amen from Ages you even look through the scripture even during the time of our Lord Jesus you find out that every time he prayer when he council to a demon he casts it off amen he casts it off if the same old demon that tempted I mean Adam in the Garden of the of Eden is the same old devil the attempt at something is the same one that entered David I mean the just rolling over from one edge to another and as they go down through the edges they become more dangerous and more deadly and more evil until on earth the pale house they took the name of death that's the reason why our age is the most evil age but Branham says how can I overcome he says every age every succeeding age receive the benefit and also receive the curse of the age before are we together praise the Lord that is the reason why young people let's give our heart to the Lord amen we mind that like the prophets said the days of the revival is over you will not have like it used to be praise the Lord but let God get a hold of your heart your body might go through terrible things your mind might go through terrible things as if you are even losing your mind almost like you want to explore but if God get a hold of your heart that's what matter let God get a hold of your heart amen praise the Lord thank God get a hold of your heart this there is there was something year I wanted to look at the scripture says and a Great Dragon was cast out there all seven that's how he represented himself in Genesis chapter 3 called the devil and sit on that deceiver the whole world he was cast out into the earth in his angels demons were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation why why the subject of salvation comes after this what does it comes because a deceiver is released to the earth and God attributes that were represented in Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 will be affected by this deceiver that's the reason why we need salvation that's why we need healing before he was cast to the earth we never need a salvation there was not a need of healing there was not a need of deliverance well now he's cast to the earth now in salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the queue for the accuser of the bridges is cast and that's why we need preachers that's why we need prayer warriors because the accuser that the bridges is cast him that's why we need worshippers amen praise the Lord but something I was getting to year with with all of this noise that I'm making therefore rejoice verse 12 yay havin a needed word hearing world on to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he had but a short time you think it's now that he knew he had a short time praise the Lord every age he thought it was the end praise the Lord every age he talked it was the end when you when you just think about this play play a question and answer on Genesis just just meditate and see how but Brenham just bring out those things you know just just meditate on how he play out the beginning of time and into time praise the Lord just meditate on it it's very beautiful it's very very beautiful because you have to know for this grid Elohim great internal spirit to be worship he created angels praise the Lord when you look over there in Isaiah chapter 12 I believe in my heart the thing that really really made the devil man when he said let us make man in our image because he knows that God was making something in his image that will be higher than him praise the Lord if God was making something of himself there was nothing or our true creation God never made that statement he never made a son in his image the son had a representation of God but it was never made in the image of God not the moon or the Stars nothing he created but when it came to you when God was about to express you praise the Lord that is the reason why did the devil can get ahold of you he can make the worst use out of you praise the Lord he hid to even think about you and that's the reason why when you have the opportunity don't spare him please amen don't spare him if God gave you grace to praise step on his feet bring all the curses down on him praise the Lord when you just gain that strength to say what is right make sure you said amen praise the Lord just tell him how foolish he is housed a liar yes you are a deceiver you are a bluff automatic off yourself I can't even go into what I want to say tonight praise the Lord because you know he has a short time let me let me give you another comparison of this and what Brian said in the message where he had he had a business meeting in church and [Music] message is floating floating my minds now he says okay he said every scene that went down I will tell you is it just coming to my mind the name of the message he said all of the things he support you read the Bible when Paul talks about the rapture he never talks about the rapture for your day he talks about the rapture for his day he said we die a living he didn't said those that would be living in those days no he said we'd a living amen because they are taught and would have happened in their time I mean Jesus even said it he says these things that you are seeing he said there were prophets of all that long to see them in their day praise the Lord I mean they thought it was going to happy in their day all of those same thing and sisters that gave himself to be burned to the stake in all of that they were looking to see the rapture in their day now this will help you to understand the scripture says that he was just giving a short time he was not thinking that it would have stayed this long when he Adam library Balaam who says when when it was said that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent he said he thought Abraham was a sea he went after Abraham when Isaac came he taught eyes it was the seed he went to destroy Isaac he said he thought Joseph was the seed he why he was trying to do that because he had a short time he thought if I can do it now I'm going to destroy it now if I can get ahold of the children of God in this age and time and just rip them out of the earth I'm going to do it and they're on the other side with God's children they're not putting it in the future they are looking for a manifestation in their time that they are living the bible says abraham he walk around looking for a city whose maker and builder he was not even allah he's all yet it would come where in the future no no no no everyday he was living he was living on the anticipation but brennan said they die with the hope in their heart and it's the same thing that would bring them up because they die on earth at expectation and you will resurrect honor the same praise the Lord oh that's the reason why you can't say well if I you know if I grow because saved a lot that I if I get merit or if I get it but you know if I get my joy and organize myself the Old Testament seems we're not doing that praise the Lord Paul says we they are living amen he talks about the rapture as if it was for him he said they that are gone before or they are waiting for us he were not talking about you he were talking about his he and the officiant church he was talking about that time praise the Lord oh my god quick in that desperation in our heart praise the Lord Amen that when we wake up in the morning we can say Lord is this going to be the day is this going to be the rapture in day praise the Lord I'm going to work Lord it is going to be a rapture in day amen praise the Lord so if you face a trial every day you're not going to postpone it I mean you're going to deal with that devil amen because the devil in his mind this could be his last day he want to perform the best wickedness the best way he can frustrate you he want to do it musicians he can come for tonight praise the Lord you just think about it tonight since why we bowed our heads you think about it before this body was ever drawn out of the dust
