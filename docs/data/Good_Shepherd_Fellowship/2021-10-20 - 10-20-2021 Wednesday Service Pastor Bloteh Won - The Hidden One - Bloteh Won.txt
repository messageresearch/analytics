praise the lord amen amen thank you musicians that will be it for the music tonight praise the lord hallelujah that was a kind of a good prayer meeting tonight the wheels go turning and when the wheels get turning it's hard to stop praise the lord amen that was that was good that was good for the for the congregation of prayer meeting we need we need more of that amen praise the lord i'm uh i'm thinking to to be able to do one more all-night prayer meeting and i'm just trying to find the best time to do it and uh but i'm hoping that we can do uh try to make it a habit around you praise the lord one of my prayer partner has traveled that brother steve john bibi am and a couple of times we have we have come and just spent the night here just praying spend some good time with the lord but it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen the lord is faithful we want to thank him for for giving us uh this opportunity to come with the weather slowly changing on us we will encourage you to dress properly and use max if you want to if you don't feel comfortable because in a sense of feeling uh fever or you know just a different feeling in your body the first thing that comes to your mind i wonder if this is kovac you know kovic becomes uh the evil thought that bother us these days but we will get through it amen the lord is faithful just like we said uh there was some report that came from brother jason uh down there in south carolina some of the brothers one of the brothers in the church they'll work in the hospital so he was able to visit with brother jason and then this morning brother jesus himself took a selfie of himself and sent it out so we want to thank the lord for that praise the lord amen and we also we believe that as the lord is doing it for our brother he's doing it for many of his children praise the lord amen now now uh the lord bless you you may have your city a little bit uh uh yeah i'm just telling you to sit down so i can have you stand up again so i can just i'm just trying to find a place now you see uh uh what what i wanted to to go over just like i announced on sunday i will i won't be here this coming sunday now i'll be preaching for one of the local denominational churches around you so uh pray for me that the law will will just make us to be a blessing to the people there and uh uh strange enough uh uh i was i was thinking about speaking on some thinking and we spoke a little bit on sunday we were talking about uh read a quote from brother brennan marriage and davos where he talks about you know the church being pregnated with the word let me see this what has happened over the years uh and and and this is not just only things that are that are common to us in the message it has been it has been it has happened you know every revival has had these kind of things when when the word of the lord comes just like it was to the children of israel when god was dealing with them through all of those ordinances and the different things you know of the temple and the sacrifices [Music] at that time their level of understanding was this is what the lord wants us to do and and and to them that was all but the mind of god behind all of those ordinances was was big when god was thinking about the lamb he was thinking about the temple he was thinking about you and myself not this physical building praise the lord amen to be able to enjoy the full benefit of the world you must be able to to uh take the word of god apply to yourself and think about god that is not a man god that is merciful god that is gracious the god of correction the god of judgment you think about all of that but it's more in a sense that when god gives his word his mind is to bring us to an expected end amen he want to bring us to a place of fellowship with him he want to bring us to a place of communion he want to bring us to the place where we can experience true relationship as father and children that's god's mind is to bring us to that place it is not just do's and don't it is not just to be able to give us rules and regulations praise the lord now and if we understand it more in a place of a relationship and fellowship with the father the things that he asks us to do we will do them gladly we will not see them as as rules praise the lord now the reason that is that you have to remember when i quoted timothy uh in childbearing paul says a woman will be saved i said that was prophecy praise the lord that was prophecy to the church it was not [Music] about the the the physical woman now you will see there in the scripture i have this scripture also in my note i didn't use that on on sunday i think i did something here tonight too i don't think i've seen my note back there but i don't have much here so uh i will just share the little i have i have one quote to read to you now so uh the bible says god says you know uh in his word there will be no bearing praise the lord he says there will be no barren among your cattles among you know your family your women and all that but you realize that peter comes in the book of peter and said if these things be in you which were the seven virtues he says you will not be boring now so it gives us a mind that when god spoke about barrenness in the beginning it was now more about physical barrenness it was more about his children now being not being barren you know his children have to be fruitful his children has to bring out his nature he has to live his life you see and and that's where all of these different form of teaching legal listening all of these things the gods talk to the lord the gods talk to the physical application and they could not follow the the holy spirit to go through praise the lord amen they couldn't follow the holy spirit to go through and and uh now so uh there were a few things that i i wanted to go over a little bit and just and and and you know and just be able to help help us look at it you know in the light of the world because uh but then while i was thinking about that and just like i said uh you know you remember we talked about the first twins and the second twins what we call the first twins and the second twins in the scripture the first twins was uh uh king and abel amen and the second twins the first twins we said they were two different seed in the same womb praise the lord the second seed was it was the same seed bringing out two different nature are we together amen so you will see that in in in the picture of god jesus taught that in matthew chapter 13 when he said a sower went to saul now so he was bringing us back to genesis to show us that there were two seeds that were sow in the earth and the father said allow them to grow together praise the lord now when it comes to uh uh israel and jacob you will also realize that they were there there were the buffer then came from from from isaac the son of abraham isaac the type of christ but now we realize that the 2c that came out of rebecca they are not as compared to king and abel but what they are compared with is what paul spoke about in romans the war that we have in us we have our flesh warring with our spirit praise the lord amen we have we will have that constant battle until we leave from here you always have mind battles you will have negative things coming to your mind you will always have you know your body not feeling well and and and and different emotions going through your body you always have a joy of the lord in your heart you you always have that that next thing it will be a fight praise the lord now even if you look at king and abel where did i put my my note but let let's go ahead if you look at king and abe i know knocking on it you look at isa and jacob like we talked about this and and and we know that uh that's where the breath ride came from amen the birthright [Music] now but look at this we know that the birthright is to the firstborn but watch this now you will realize how many times in the scripture the god bypass the first bone how many times king was the first that came out of the womb of eve but god bypassed him amen the blessing went to set that took the place of abel praise the lord ishmael was the first that came out of abraham but the blessing isaac was the promise praise the lord so now you think about it now what what what what can we draw from there there is a first birth and there is a second birth praise the lord even though honor the lord is a lord and god is not breaking his lord no but you see in a way that god showed it through the scripture it gives us an idea that god was aiming at the new birth more than the physical birth your physical birth is your first bone that's the first time you were born physically your new birth is your second birth that's why jacob crossed his hands it's a type of cavalry christ crossing his hands for the blessing to go to the second so in god's mind he's more interested in your second birth than your first birth he more interested in you being born by him than being born by your parents so you see uh all of these things are lying in the world all of these things and uh and the devil he knows that too he knows that because when god said the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent head he was targeting that seed praise the lord and then he targeted the seed all alone thinking that it was it was moses all it was uh it was isaac it was uh you know i mean it was jacob he targeted the sea oil on all through the ages praise the lord until god bypass him because all the devil knows about a life being born on this earth was alive to come by sex but when god was talking about the seed of the woman god was talking that's the reason why he clearly said it the devil was not listening to claire he said the seed of the woman if satan would have grabbed that revelation he would have not bothered isaac he will not bother moses you are not about anybody because he will know that god himself would give a woman a seed what am i driving to tonight praise the lord you know sometimes these things and and that is and that's where most of the the the people in in the ages i mean the god they got they got so troubled because some of those things that brother branham said they never under just just like paul imagine paul saying you know let the woman be submissive to her husband in child bearing she will be saved do you know can you imagine how many people that walk from that service and thought that if a woman does not have a child she will not be saved you know how many people walk from that service how many men left their wives praise the lord so i left some few things out that i i i've talked about on on on sunday but uh and then you know just just how those things happen sometimes there the uh uh i was talking with brother eric and he's telling me you know they have the uh the uh uh prayer meeting where they are reading a chapter a day uh brother lawrence and uh stephen wolf started that as a family and and few of a few different uh brothers and sisters brother hillary them and the rest of them has joined that and uh and they told me he told me that the reading from the book of esther then you know and uh i guess because i mentioned esther on on wednesday night i mean on sunday but then there there is something also that i was looking at i know i don't have i don't have time tonight but uh we will make the best use of what we have praise the lord amen what almighty god we self amen so i mean we we went on talking a little betting and now and i was i was just listening to him he was talking he was exalting me you know and talking about some things but let's stand on our feet tonight let's stand on our feeding we can read a portion of the words our god is faithful amen he's a faithful god our god is a faithful god let's turn in the book of esther let's turn in the bulk of esther let's read in chapter four i just want to read these words of uh mother chapter 4 verse 12. and they told to mordecai esther words then mordecai commanded to answer esther think net with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews for if thou altogether holded that peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance am i reading the right place okay if you are quiet like that then i think i'm somewhere else then shot there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place now you have to remember now they have a witness where shadrach meshach and abednego said we will now bow down even if our god will not deliver us we will not bow down so with all of that record that they have malachi is saying to his little niece here is that if you will not do it god will raise our help from somewhere he have done it before praise the lord but thou and their father house shall be destroyed now this is what i want us to do earth and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this who know whether god has saved you god is dealing with you for such a time like this praise the lord let's pray tonight father lord i just ask so god that you will you will bless your word your word is already blessed but we need a special blessing tonight father for this time of god where you will be able to put us together lord the one streaming the service tonight the ones that are here the ones that we watch the service after later just put us love father and deal with us with a few minutes that is left before us in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed who knows whether thou i come we'll know whether you are come for such a time like this praise the lord amen who know whether god has given us this opportunity because he won he wanted the people to stand for him in this hour that we are living in praise the lord don't despise your experience with god don't despise what god is doing in your life praise the lord amen you might not be on the on the housetop and and you might not be on the on the hallelujah bench but yet god in his all-sufficient way is dealing with each and every one of you praise the lord amen but i believe that god has put us in a situation just like i said trying to make you know a saying of mary and joseph you know in a time of taxation when everybody was busy and everybody was quarantined and everything was going on but in that very hour god had a people that he was dealing with and it was a great move of god even though all the world despised it the media was carrying false news and they were they were saying anything they want to say about mary and joseph but that was the greatest move of god almighty god was taking on sistine elements to come endure with his creation the lord amen humans are like that it's so easy when people start to talk about a setting drink we want to taste it we want to see everybody talking about this you know everybody is you know wearing this you know everybody is saying this you know we sometimes we are drawn to that but most of the time that's not how god works praise the lord the bible says we must prove all things and hold fast to that which is proven to be good praise the lord but what i want us to look at tonight is that we all have read the book of esther we could go right back to esther chapter one i i remember many years ago when we were stay recording on on cassettes i preached preach from the book of esther right in the same church i preached a message on the elected lady and uh you know talks about all of the numbers there and all of that but that's not what i want to get in tonight uh i'm trying to find a place to put my fault because i'm having just a few things before me and uh but if if you think about it one thing did also is that uh you know we we all uh know and we learned you know that uh you know the name of god is not mentioned in the in the in in the book of esther it is truth when you read our translation but it is not true when you read the hebrew it is true when you read the the this translation that we have you will you will not find g.o.d god or lord you know uh or yahweh you won't find it but in the hebrew it is not truth but we will not get into that one thing that that kind of caught my attention which of course that other all of those things have you know we have preached there we have said that before and it's just that you know when you when you study it a little bit more you kind of foresee that yeah uh you know almighty god has a reason i started looking at this and i found this uh uh the very persian name esther you have to remember that esther was a persian name given to her the same as shadrach meshach and abednego you know those were babylonian names that were given to them so esther is a persian name in the hebrew esther means hiding it means hating that alone will say a whole lot because this particular book because of the record of god not being written in it or lord or yahweh nothing people have frowned at this book even luther doing his reformation asks that the book of esther being taken out of the bible if the frown at it you know at uh even even the book uh the the books of the maccabees it has history and it talks about how the law delivers it talks about the law you know and and yara said the book esther reading year and and not even the lord's name written in it if you if you read you'll find about luther from that he says you know how how can we have a book like this in the bible but you can you can understand the time that he was living in you can understand the grace of the hour that he had praise the lord so all of that but yeah i was i was kind of looking through that and and studying a little bit and i realized yeah the uh uh esther we we know that her name her hebrew name is adasa advanced is now the meaning of esther in hebrew she was called adasa that was a hebrew giving name esther was a persian name that was given to her and esther means hidden and that is what uh uh esther on on on the other hand is indeed the hidden one the hidden one praise the lord she hides her real name adessa she has her jewish identity she lived in the palace as if she were a good persian girl praise the lord but this is what i want to i want to to grab our attention tonight if the lord will help us many many years ago this thought dropped my mind i remember one time i was preaching there in d.c for brother mark walsh and i was speaking on this and he said he said to me after the service he said bro how can you preach this on wednesday night he says how can you preach this on wednesday night wednesday night is just too short for the message like this praise the lord brother branham said this in the seventh seal let me share this with you he said he said now we are going to speak here now on this seventh chapter to kind of breach in it between the six and the seven seals praise the lord it might it might go over your head tonight but i pray that the lord don't allow it to go over your heart amen he says between the sixth and the seventh seal he said because that's that's the only material that we have to go on right now now he was preaching on the seventh seal but there was something important for him to talk about more than the seventh seal because the seventh seal what is the seventh seal the seventh seal is the end of all things the seventh seal is the coming of christ praise the lord amen but there is something important that he wanted to talk about so that's the reason why he says this he says that because that's the only material we we have to go on right now is sex between the sixth and the seventh seal is the calling of israel now you have to remember that the sixth seal is the tribulation seal the seventh seal is the coming of the lord or the end of all things if everything in the coming of the lord praise the lord now you see why it's not good to preach this on wednesday not because there is no time i'm just going to have your hair spinning praise the lord but i i trust that it will not leave your shoulder amen so he says right between the sixth seal and the seventh seal this is where it would get it would get beautiful is the calling of the jews amen he said now this introvert between the sixth hue is a calling and sealing of the 144 thousand jews calling the tribulation period after the church is gone now there's more we can say to that but what brings this in what brings this to my mind and what makes it important now realize now is between the six seal the tribulation seal and the seventh seal which is the coming of the lord we're dealing with the book of revelation between it is the calling of israel now remember like whatever last week or last uh two weeks we talked about how after the the mount moriah experience after abraham was visited by god amen isaac vanished from the text only for him to appear in the text when rebecca was coming praise the lord which explained to us after revelation chapter 3 john said come up heaven which was the rapture so the church was called to come up higher and the church did not appear again until revelation chapter 19 when john said come and see the lamb's wife now i'm i'm saying this to say to you that things that were brought to us by the prophet messenger were not were not just flying thoughts they were not flying thoughts praise the lord it was brother branham that taught us and said if you cannot find it in the bible don't swallow it he says every revelation must run through the scripture praise the lord amen now the reason why i said this tonight is that uh uh you will realize uh i mean this is it it's kind of a spring out to me and and and and it was it was i mean those kind of things can just make you you just you just weep you know you just you just embrace the word you want to you just want to put the bible inside you know you can do it like that the holy spirit has to transform you because now watch it now because you will realize this whole story of esther that is going to be the calling out of the jewels because the book of esther is written between the sixth chapter and the seventh chapter of ezra praise the lord amen the book of esther is written between the sixth chapter and the seventh chapter now if you read the sixth chapter you will read in the book of ezra you will read about the king darus now you have to remember now that this is the the the meat and the persian so it's two kingdom darus was the king of the meats praise the lord and hassan sirius was the the the king of the persian which of course that was just a title of their king that was not even his name just like pharaoh just like abimelech those were just titles are we together but that was the thing that that kind of stool out to me because esther the book of esther esther raw whoop is it is esther wrote please the importance of the rebuilding of jerusalem esther being in the palace played a very important of of the temple being rebuilt praise the lord of the jews having the liberty to build their walls and build the temple and out of there because you will realize that was even before the time of neymar's are we together if the lord help us we will we will go back to brother branham code and and i will explain some things to you not tonight but i want for us to travel a little bit i want for us to travel first samuel chapter nine first samuel chapter nine praise the lord i'm having about five minutes to do this amen praise the lord if uh if the holy spirit can just lift us up tonight capture us five minutes is no time praise the lord we can we can we can preach a whole series in five minutes but this is what i want to show you first samuel chapter 9 the bible says there was a man there was a man in benjamin whose name was kitch now so this will bring us to the place where saul was the son of kitsch am i right esther chapter 2. praise the lord esther chapter 2 essa chapter 2 verse 5. the bible says noun in shushan the palace there was a certain jews whose name was mordecai the son of jail the son of shemel the son of kitsch a benjaminite praise the lord so we see here saul being the son of kitch molokai being the son of kitch praise the lord another name spring out right here in this scripture is the son of shemel who was he second samuel chapter 16. praise the lord you read second samuel chapter 16 verse 5 shemel was the one that spit on david when david was being going out of the city praise the lord amen and you remember david mann took the sword and he won he says who is this dead dog that was that was spit on my master david said don't do it maybe the lord taught him to do it amen brother burnham says david was seeking mercy from god praise the lord but you think about it now if david mann will have killed shimel there will not be a mother kind yes sir praise the lord amen with with all that david was going through he was rejected and and and i mean he he was a king he lost his place loss is strong this place praise the lord a lot of frustration and and i mean people i mean saying all sorts of things about him but yet yet brother branham used this in crisis the mystery of god revealed he was talking to brother brother uh neville that wrote the church book and bernie is a brand he says why why do you just allow people to say all sorts of things about you praise the lord he says he said brother neither he says colored but he's too fast on the trigger he said he said do you remember when when when david was cast away from the throne and uh and his uh uh uh you know and that benjamin spit on him and and then you you also have to remember that brother branham was dealing with that tax thing at the time that's when he was dealing with that tax thing with the irs and uh and and he was he was actually praying you know he was he was telling lo lord i mean this this thing is scattering my name he was trying to get away from the field you know not to go preaching i mean a lot of things was going on around life at that time and he reminded him he says and david says leave him alone maybe the lord allow him he says he says he says he says leave them alone maybe the lord you know allow them to say those things but bam said it was not even they did not even talk any time he says i was sitting right there brother brother uh leville and my wife he says and there on the wall came a vision the very thing that he was asking the lord for because he took the right attitude because he took the right attitude not to not to blast back at the people and call them serpent seed and call them you know he he says don't do maybe the lord allowed them to do it whatever people want to say let them say it this is right there come a vision on the wall a call to arizona back to the field the law was said and brought back i would take care of all of that you go back into the field praise the lord let david year ride in this situation and he says leave him the lord told him to do it leaving just leave him praise the lord it would be a great grandson of shimel would turn out to be malachi that will be at the right place at the right time are we together exodus chapter 17. we'll read the scripture then another time we will preach okay i think i should be doing that read all my scripture and then another service then i preach praise the lord but it's good for the for the prayer meeting night amen exodus chapter 17 you read from verse 18. exodus 17 reading from verse 8 now verse 18 verse 8 you will realize that exodus chapter 17 israel had just come to that place of of a great trial where the people were murmuring for walter and all of that in god give them a drink amen and the bible says here praise the lord are we together verse seven he called the name of the place masha and marba because of the shining of the children of israel and because they tempted the law saying is the is the lord among us or net now see they have just come out of a trial amen the lord have they have just come out of a trial and god proved himself he came down he turned the bitter water into sweet now they have water to drink praise the lord right after the thought it was it was victory and and and they are drinking from the fountain and they are wasting water on their head you know when god gave us he bless us then we start to waste it you know and and and you know and they are enjoying themselves right after that the bible says the next verse praise the lord then came amalek and fought with israel now that battle was word almighty god became jehovah nisi where where moses held of his hand praise the lord amen where joshua and and the rest of them the hair moves his hand why the now israel was on the on the agility and amalek was the first group of people that went in their way to stop them praise the lord and you can read through the the verse and and uh and moses said unto joshua choose us out man and go out and fight with i'm alike and tomorrow i will i will stand on top of the hill with the rod of god in my hand and so joshua did as moses said unto him and fought with armor like moses and aaron and he went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass you know why the hell moses hand we know all of that you know i'm just trying to bring you to a place here amen verse 15 and moses built an altar and called the name of the place jehovah nisi for he said because the lord have sown that the lord will have wall with amalek from generation to generation praise the lord amen god now telling ezra i will fight with amalek until i take them out of the face of the earth praise the lord amen this these are not just bible stories when god says something in his word he mean it numbers chapter 24 verse 20. praise the lord numbers chapter 24 verse 20 and when he look on amalek he took up a parable and said amalek was the first of the nation but his little end shall be that he perished forever praise the lord so it became a parable in the sense that it became a saying among the children of israel that god says i would take up with amalek they were the first nation that stood to stop israel in their journey for no reason for no reason when the scripture says the battle is the laws you better take your hand from in it praise the lord because if you can fight your battle god can fight for you deuteronomy chapter 25 verse 17. me run through this quickly just a few more strips a year and then we will we will find a place and stop i'll leave you right on the edge of the cliff and you have to hold on until we meet again praise the lord 25 17. remember what amalek did on today by the way when you come out when you come forth out of egypt how he met thee by the way and smoth the hemo part of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou were faint and weary and he feared not god therefore it shall be when the lord thy god has given thee rest from all that their enemies around about in the land which the law that god gave thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shall not forget it thou shalt not forget it praise the lord remember jesus said all of these little ones if you touch them it's better that a male stone was hanged on your neck i'm alex wayne and started touching the feeble ones the little ones the older people the sick that was in the mess started plaguing them hitting them that's what happened when a brother is going through a trouble or a struggle and then we gossip about them we talk about them they are god's feeble ones you are called to pray for them and not to smite them not to smart them with bad words but pray for them god told them thou shalt not forget it now so all of this where we come to word ed saul had his problem it was on this very thing the war against the amalekites amalek he spared the king and the king that he spared is the grandfather of heaven i wanted to hank so you see the same amalek an israel battle ended when the ten suns of hermes was hanged it brought the end of the amalekites the word that god told him in exeter he watched over his word praise the lord so if you can see god in the book of esther please see god there because he's all over the pages praise the lord he's all over the pages amen it's a theological thing which of course is truly it's not physically written there but by divine revelation we can see him through all the pages praise the lord there are few more scriptures i have here but i won't go into them tonight musicians can come but see the see the divine providence see the the divine stage that god said that esther that's why mother kai told her maybe that god brought you to this time for this very reason praise the lord i don't know what i don't know your reason of being in this church i don't know your reason you got to find your reason you got to make your call and your election show you got to make sure that you're not called by the man you're not called by the church make sure that your call and your election is in god we'll call you [Music] i told you since something one time i said look it's completely different in the marriage covenant the right is giving to the man to go and choose his wife but when it comes to this gods give you the right to choose

brought to this time to this age [Music] for an hour like this [Music] and we are in we are also in an introvert this time is called a time where god long suffering suffer but brandon said there was a period of time like that in the days of noah where the outdoor was open for seven days it was a time of god's long suffering [Music] that's the time that we are living a period an introvert a time that is called the long suffering of god [Music] maybe you are brought to this time for this very reason [Music] esther was now placed there because of herself she was placed there because of others praise the lord some of us that god has given the grace to cross the atlantic ocean be in america and we think it's it's it's uh the reason is to get frame is to get fame or whatever you want to get

the things that if you don't help us we could be exposed to what a time we are living in it can also be the glorious time in our life just like it was for esther a slave girl she was an orphan her parents died maybe in babylon or during one of the siege of nebuchadnezzar who can tell but yeah she's sitting in the polish how it's so easy for her to forget the days of struggle and all she wants is the glamour of the persian kingdom now realizing that god has raised her up to deal with the rest of the amalekites let's pray together tonight heavenly father lord jesus we just want to thank you
