set of notes out there but I read from the one from perfect now before we pray tonight brother Branham was saying something here he says remember Jesus as we are in a lesson this morning he never used his power for himself use it for others that's what it was sent for [Music] and you think sometimes Wahoo a man that was so full of the of power like him who have to ever be sick yes sir I read in some books some words were when he raised up that boy The Widow's son from then I believe it was the the prince of the House of David there he sat on a rock and grown with a headache see he bow our iniquity their means to pick them see he ball and he how all things like we have he has sickness he had Temptation he had trouble he have frustration just as we have because he had to be the right kind of mediator so he had to be partaker a harshly man of the fruit before he will know praise the Lord amen says in adoption he said yesterday people don't know what depressing time comes with this type of ministry he said I got real depressed and I said to the wife a witch I could just go on she said why why you said that bill I said oh yeah yeah I have trouble in things and then seems like the holy spirit said are you trying to bypass them bypass them trouble or trying to dodge them see no I said just let me stand right up and face right up in the face of all of it and face it out [Music] amen being led of this of the Holy Spirit and you are neighbors that's right and then one great thing that's bothering you as a demon is demon oppression you always feel depressed like the devil got you or something like that you are trying you are having a spiritual battle aren't you is that truth and especially you get you get in in the afternoon after dinner or something like that in the

chapter 18 let's look at another woman the woman of Luke Chapter 18. I call her the woman of Luke Chapter 18. praise the Lord Amen on this Wednesday night I call her the lady of Luke chapter 18. praise the Lord amen I mean I think the Lord has been gracious to us amen the Lord has been very very gracious to us and uh he's he's been it's been a wonderful thing praise the Lord Hallelujah to just see how you know the Holy Spirit Will will bless us in such a way and then I mean bring his word to us in the way that without complication amen the way the the word comes to to set us free the men to liberate us to make us to experience the part on Luke chapter 18 let's just read about this woman and he speak our lord Jesus a parable unto them to this end Jesus speaking the parable unto them to this end that man ought always to pray and now to faint praise the Lord no wonder why the devil fight our prayer life amen because that's one thing we can do and we will never be out of the word of God when we are praying no matter where we are no matter what time of the day no matter how you are praying with your eyes open your eyes closed and no matter how you I pray you can never be out of the word of God praise the Lord and that's why the devil will do everything to fight our prayer life that man ought to always but always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which fear in that God need a regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversaries amen praise the Lord and he who net for a while but afterward he said within himself praise the Lord though I fear not God none regards man yet because this Widow trouble at me I will avenge her at least by her continuous coming she worries me now Jesus is using this story about an unjust judge a man that don't fear God and he don't regard anybody praise the Lord but yet he will he does not uh being able to build the courage to drive this woman away praise the Lord because of I believe that he might have lied to her so I'll do it next week and and yeah I'll take care of it tomorrow and the next day she's there again praise the Lord and Jesus said that he taught within himself though I fear not God not regard man yet because this Widow trouble it means I will avenge her at least by her continuous coming she wears me now Jesus is using this to teach us how we must always pray praise the Lord I remember in the message Mighty conqueror he says uh you know we have not prayed enough until God answered praise the Lord we have not prayed enough you can never get tired until you get a yes or a no from God until you find out what the word of God is you have to continue praying and the Lord said our lord Jesus said hear what the unjust Josh said and shall not God avenge his own village praise the Lord shall not God avenge his sons and his daughter which cry day and night unto him though he beg long with him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily praise God thank you praise the Lord he will avenge them speedily that word is very interesting to me that word speedy light because God's speed is not main speed right God move in Social speed that he he already do it and you are so caught up in your mind that you don't realize it that he have already done it because he said before you even ask he said before you even ask so he's his son he's on social speed amen and uh uh I tell you that he will avenge them speediling amen nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth now see here how Jesus is liking him the end time faith to our prayer life praise the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father dear Lord we we just want to thank you tonight and oh God uh we we are so grateful as a people Lord we can always thank you father Lord and uh uh that's how I feed in My Heart Lord Jesus every time of God we come together every time we have the privilege Lord to call upon your name oh God thank you for giving gratefulness in our hearts Lord that we can be able to express it back to you father Lord garden and how many Lord Jesus when when when when they ever think about praying is gesto it's just to burden you with needs and no no consciousness of being thankful no consciousness for father or bringing praise and appreciating you father oh God they are just so burdened Lord they cannot look around them and and never see anything that you have done even o God you are doing so much for us and even the sons of men precious Lord we just ask the blessing upon your word tonight father I want to take this tonight Lord Jesus and and address Lord Brother Braham talking about the three sacrifices that was given to the church so I pray that father you bless the service tonight in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so as we as we fear the need uh uh you know I I talk about talk to talk about uh you know uh talking to the young people but they're not fair they need to just us go through this entire uh a series of messages that brother Brandon preached leading up to marriage and divorce and uh and we we have gone through two uh a man running away from the presence of the Lord which of course brother Brandon was teaching us responsibility in that message and then he comes teaching uh the seed is not held with the shark he brought the three women that were a carrier of the sea that types our body Soul and Spirit amen the types of our body soul in spirit our body was born of adultery there's there's Hager our spirit is the one that the promise was given to that syrup our soul is married virgin but you have to know that she's not the sea amen the word is the seed amen praise the Lord so he he talks about that that uh oh you know their practicing of the Holy Ghost without sensation and that's that's where Mary comes in because Christ was born with our sensation and Christ will be born in the hearts of his bride with our sensation now so uh but tonight we want to look at this woman of uh Luke chapter 18 and uh and just like I said praying now I'll go over what blood Brown said because I feel that is very important the reason why it is important to to be able to follow the the messages before marriage and Devils because it helps you to be able to see where brother Brandon was going with this praise the Lord and and many have have pulled out of that message a lot of things there that have been a lot of contradiction all through the years and and people have uh pulled out of that message uh where they think they are broader brand name you know uh taught her uh you know uh the woman being a lesser when he used the word byproduct but there was a misconception you know misunderstanding from many people and uh when brother Brown talks about now being in the original creation uh people misunderstand that but when you follow the messages uh uh before marriage and divorce it helps you it helps you for you to for you to relax and appreciate because people listen to marriage and divorce they are on the edge and they want to see whether you know I'm in the will of God or uh you know are there something wrong or you know my life you know brother I'm going to call out this and and all of that but for you for you for us to just realize that with the hunting question that's been on the prophet of God mind that he took a time to go before the Lord and and bring your word back to the people to be able to address their condition it is not something that should be frightening right there's something there should be relaxing we should be gracious that we have a word that we can go back to praise the Lord amen and I will tell you tonight there the pattern did not only work for 1965. the pattern works tonight [Music] praise the Lord the pardon works tonight amen amen glory be to God so we want to we want to look at this uh this uh this wonderful woman here amen uh what a character you know what a character that I read that quote to you before blood branch is a Praying Woman can do more than a man standing behind appropriate praise the Lord I love that I use that in Zimbabwe when I was there and uh yeah yeah there was there was there was a kind of a very wonderful story that came out of it in uh the the my friend the host Daddy was he was because his daughter was getting married and the wife was was uh trying to help prepare their uh in Australia so she couldn't make it for the meeting so you know they were talking back and forth and she was streaming the service you know so so he says something to her then and then he she pulled that one as a card and sent it back to him he says yeah the Praying Woman can do more than the man behind the pulpit so he started laughing praise the Lord you know so but we thank the Lord tonight but that's exactly what I Think Jesus is uh is bringing to us here just just go back again uh uh as as the scripture says you know Jesus uh intentionally I would say intentionally he lay out this story and the Bible said that men ought to always pray and not to faint praise the Lord no matter how tough the situation is getting to be we we have to pray always praise the lord we have to pray always and and we have to we have to trust the Lord and learn that uh uh praying is not it's not uh a ritual praying is communion amen praying is communion praying is is fellowship is talking to the one that we love to talk into our father talking to our creator you know so uh we uh we you know we you know you you get to the place where sometimes you you get uh in this position where you you you only learn and understand that you know I need to be in a certain position for me to really pray it's true sometimes you just you just got to be away from everything if you really want to be lost in praying I mean you cannot do it anymore you'll be so distracted amen you can pray anymore but you cannot get lost in the morning man you get lost in the in the in the different store not in the spirit right praise the Lord amen in about the thing that is that uh uh just like Paul says you know uh be be instant in season and out of season that's one of the same principle that Jesus is trying to teach us here were men ought to pray and faint net and then he brought the story of this woman you know that uh I mean she would not she would not just give up until what she needs is restored praise the Lord now when I read this story what I think about I think about over in the book of Kings the the Widow that there was coming to the king for her Lane to be restored right praise the Lord amen she came to the king and and of uh you know trying to ask the king and the very moment that she came Elijah Elijah was there testifying of a woman who receive her son back to life praise the Lord and it happens the other uh uh Elijah appointed to the woman here is the will I'm talking about a receiver her son back to life and the King remember that this is a woman that is asking me to Restore Holland so he asks that everything she lost must be restored praise the Lord amen and so you see that uh is a very very very important principle but I want to take it tonight in in going back again uh uh invisible Union to be able to show like blood brand and we'll take the three sacrifices that God gave to the woman he would take it also with the church that's what I want to do tonight so invisible union he starts out yeah he said marriage is the oldest Institute in the world marriage is is marriage was performed first in in an Institute in the Garden of Eden a woman is trusted with certain characters that she must now Define a woman was not even he says uh he says uh even in the beginning of the creation because God knows that she who fall now so you you follow this now and and and just like I said uh when brother Branham used it if you if you look at Genesis 1 26. where he says let us make man in our image male and female then you realize that brother Branham was meaning when God was expressing right Genesis 1 into flesh right that's what he means when she when he says that he was he was talking more in the form of the sequence that he came the man came first before the woman in flesh right but when he made man in Genesis 1 20 says he made man male and female Creator he then praise the Lord sir now so yeah he says see she was a byproduct of a man because but but because she was cast over on this side now you watch that statement now watch that statement she was cast over on this side watch that statement he said she was she has also been giving a sacred charge from God for Redemption so the vet you were giving to her for Redemption now that's the reason why brother Branham is saying she was cast on this side so she never came in the original forming into flesh right God hate her because of redemption right praise the Lord amen yet it was going to be a man that would pay the price but the promise of redemption was given to the woman it was the woman's feet not the mercy praise the Lord and that's the reason why I said in in on Sunday is that God empowered the woman from the beginning in her very making her strength is hiding you know Australia is now the all of this what a man can do a woman can do no that's that's not her strength is the word not understanding there but the strength of a woman is hidden signs prove it a woman can multitask more than a man because of the way she's built because of the way she's built she can do many things at one take care of the children cooking food and everything cleaning the house she can must be that's the way God made her now so he said she was cast over in this side she has also been giving a sacred charge from God for Redemption she got character that she must not Define if she who my them she defied for life no matter how much she is forgiving she cannot be justified now I will come back to that and uh I will come back to that just like I said I'll be able to pick that up again I have I have a taught him there not to explain it it means what it says but I just want to I just want to share some things with you on that her body was giving to her a sacred trust from God she is to bring for life into the Earth her body is a betting ground for life therefore that's the reason she's giving this sacred church now so you see she she's a life Giver all tied to Redemption amen now this is where I want to grab you also now I'm speaking now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands praise the Lord now you have to realize you have to realize that by our natural birth by our natural birth we are born default so God most emphasis is for his spiritual church right are we together yes amen I want I want you to be able to grab that in your mind praise the Lord let me let me say it this way so you can be able to understand it a young man or the young woman that uh that fall from grace and and the devil might have rubbed their life into everything when they receive Christ and they are born again they are more veterans before God than the woman that have not divided herself and walking in in in on the street I mean in pain since she have never no man I never touch her but this son of God or this daughter of God that have repented and have accepted God's grace is more ventrous before God are you together now amen that's that's what I want you to understand because brother Branham is bringing this thing from a natural standpoint so we can be able to understand it but the emphasis the emphasis is for the church yes sir so if we just want to stay with the natural part that's where legalism is built right are we together amen the natural is just as important as the spiritual but the most the more emphasis is for the spiritual right just the tip just like the tip we played uh the seed is not here with the shot he made the same emphasis in that message he said you have to watch this because this is for the church right so he says yes I'm speaking now I'm bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands I'm not speaking to you woman what whatever you are whatever you are that's between you and God or you men but I'm speaking of the church in Christ but when we even tell us here in this very same message our invisible Union that when Paul uh Romans chapter 7 he said Paul use that as a prophecy for the church are we together praise the Lord he says I'm speaking of the church in Christ and and this now this is giving to bring for life or she's giving this to bring for life they are only God himself can give she's put in this position so you see how do you see how uh important that is to God praise the Lord think about it this way and and the better way to be able to understand it is look at uh uh Judges chapter 11. Jeff Thai making a promise to God that the first thing that comes out of my house Lord if you give me this battle if you give me victory in this world the first thing that come out of my house I was sacrificing to you this was God's first daughter this was the first female that came out of the hands of Jehovah that's how much this subject is important to God that's how much the church is important to God that's how much these three sacrificial is important to God are we together yes sir she's giving to bring for Life The Only God himself can can give notice that has committed to her her sacred virtue sacred woman who and then sacred motherful honor her husband what what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she is a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to hovet you to her husband the church has the same responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ praise the Lord do you see why Jesus whoa will will take a parable and compare the constant asking of God a life of prayer that man should pray always that Jesus will take prayer and liking it or qualify it too the faith of the son of God praise the Lord because just as the first virtue is important in the life of a young woman so prayer is important in the life of the church praise the Lord Jesus says when you pray when you stand praying he says forgive so you see prayer in itself it's an atmosphere it's an environment where a person lay it's not a ritual that a person does ingests and just bubbles some words to God right it's an atmosphere it's an environment that you live in and to be healthy in that environment you cannot be healthy if you are holding things in your hearts if you're having unforgiving spirit praise the Lord just like how you see that's the reason why the devil will defy the church if the church lost his prayer life if a Believer lost lost his time or her time with having communion with God it must not be on the family devotion it must not be on the church prayer meeting it must be something that we have private to ourselves I love to wake up in in 6 a.m in the morning and pray with the family I love to uh to come to prayer meeting but above all I love my own personal time with God right right I lost my own personal time with God praise the Lord a man must pray it always and faith in that when the son of man cometh will he find faith he's not going to find faith in a prayerless church you know true he's not going to find Rapture in faith in the people that have no relationship no connection no communion with God how can we have rapturing faith when there is no communion are we together you see when the enemy can just get our minds so cut up and stop in the physical where we just looking at the physical flesh and the physical requirement of a woman and we can use that and blast and talk all of that instead of spending time on our knees sir Amen in praying for our wives and praying for our daughters and praying for our sister praise the Lord oh yes that prophet of God told us how much uh uh uh uh since since Eden since Eden Eden show it to us the enemy attacked the precious life of the woman and in the day and in this day and age that we are living we see it all over us because he knows he knows brother Brown says he knows the principle of life he knows the power that is in these virtues you know the devil knows that the power that is in these virtues when a woman can stand on it that's that's the reason why the prophet of God said over and over he says uh motherhood is the backbone to the nation this is the backbone to the nation so how we how we we need to trust the Lord and and and cultivate more time to spend with God in praying amen what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church she has a responsibility as a as a woman has a soccer responsibility to her motherhood to convert you to her husband the church has has a sacral responsibility to to prayer told the word and to Christ you know for a long time I saw as a young believer that I struggle with honestly to the word into Christ I said but that's the same praise the Lord but it's more than that people it's more than that amen it's more than that because it's so it's so easy for us to conform to the word and conform to to the doctrine and have no relationship right right that to Christ is our personal relationship with the person of Jesus Christ because the word must be put in flesh now that's what the church is also in the same condition she's a type she has the same precious virtue by Spirit giving to her to preserve the spirit and the word and never commit adultery with anything of the word or anything State virgin told the word as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband praise the Lord now you think about this now let me let me let me ride with you a little bit on this you ever said that uh uh God has redeemed us from such and an evil were born in Saint simply in iniquity just like just like I said our spirit was marked amen our spirit was defined by our natural birth let me see it that way because we come into the word speaking speaking lies but you see like the prophet of God saying here is that uh when when when God redeemed us when when he saved us through our faith and confession in Jesus Christ and he has brought us to himself and and and and and have given us his spirit for us to come into such a fellowship such a relationship with him he looked at us as a veterans bride yeah praise the Lord he looked at us because this is under the very same message where brother brand preached that he looked at us as a bride that has been Justified right and that's why Paul preached there justified by faith our faith raised us up to such a place where we are now honored no condemnation unto them that are in Christ we are not dealing with guilt in and out today I'm saved tomorrow I'm condemned no he raised us up yeah so that core equalness John hears with cracks praise the Lord and that's some of the things that have failed in uh in in in in many of our marriage relationship what a man has not been able to have that Grace to be able to raise his wife up praise the Lord he's just looking for the next occasion to go back okay that's why you did that I see that's why you did that right are we together now that's the reason why I'm saying there there is is this this is a very good foundation I'll tell you many years ago that was that was my experience there was a subject I was struggling with in the message and I mean I said it I I whatever material that I had in the message I looked through I looked through I just fell to myself I said for some reason I I I just they were just a need I just I said Lord I Need Your Grace to help me understand this and the Lord just laid on my heart to him to steady the entire series leading up to marriage in their voice praise the Lord and God will not tell you to do something like that unless he has an answer for you and there the Lord just helped me to see it praise the Lord I realize that all of those years are because of legalizing that have come into the message most of the people did not go they never went into the field they stopped right at the bridge right they couldn't cross right they stop they stop other do's and don'ts right and they couldn't cross to go in the seals and see what the labor type the Deliverance in healing that the message has brought it's all about this virtuous bride this bride that has been redeemed by a better blood then the blood of our fathers and mother a better sacrifice a better coveting it's all about this bride it is not about our self-achievement praise the Lord now that's what the church is also she's in that same condition she's a type she has the same precious that you buy the spirit given to her to preserve the spirit and the word that's the thing that keeps the church is now us trying to do buddy buddy buddy buddy don't keep the church it's the spirit and the word that keeps the church [Music] trying to know it that's not why it keeps the church what keeps the church is the spirit and the word yes sir and that's why we are giving that we have to be in prayer the preacher has to pray for you you have to pray for the preacher because we are all in this together it's a spiritual warfare praise the Lord amen but now remember now we're trying to keep this woman that Jesus spoke about here how her continues her continuous coming to the judge is a type of us never giving up on anybody never giving up on any situation always believe in God trusting God confessing the promises amen praise the Lord amen you have to realize that brother Branham says when love projects yeah When Love projects He says then Sovereign Grace takes over and that's what prayer does it brings up the love of God and IT projects a Deliverance for the person IT projects healing for the person IT projects a a God moving on the scene for the person then the Sovereign Grace of God goes to work but you you can net you you are not projecting when when you when you go up writing says yeah I keep praying for you but you keep doing that same thing praise the Lord sure amen just like the projector there it does not have no letters in it praise the Lord yeah it comes from back there sister fading and they're all they just they just stop some few kids and they go straight on the wall yeah it does not make up your mind and say no I'm not that's that's not the one I want to project send it go back send me send me the the next no it does not praise the Lord yeah amen we have to project the promises yes God this is what your word said believe on the Lord Jesus me and my household will be safe that's why your word says and just read me a quote today brother Brian says where he says what happened he says he says that is that's the same thing for healing he says your faith will project and heal you your body is saved by your feet will create a projection of you being healed he says and then now they will take your sick body to go and meet your well body because every time you go to pray every time you are not looking at this body you are looking at that body that is well [Music] you are looking at that person that has overcome you are looking at that son or daughter that is Victory you are not looking at the one that is giving you trouble you are looking at the one that faith has already project amen yes sir praise the Lord you see that's why brother one brother by him preached perfect Faith yeah he talks about he says he says that he says there are wolves that will now be able to grab it he said they will not grasit they would struggle there was struggle he says but that's the place where God brings perfect through the bride it puts us to that place it puts you to that place word uh I mean because what happened is that uh that's the that's the thing that religion does all through the church when those things are happening then you start disassociating yourself from this person because you think that person is bad I've been praying for them they don't want to be they don't want to be yeah I mean it's not working yeah praise the Lord but you see perfect raise you up to the place where it have created a vision and in that Vision you see this person better than what they are now so being around them does not bother you right it does not bother you you don't have complex because your faith has provided a vision and what you are looking at you are looking at the invisible not the visible [Laughter] you are looking at the invisible every time you stick around and you give them a hug that that picture comes back to your mind you see them better than what they are now sure praise the Lord how do we come to that faith continuous praying continuous praying yes sir how do we come to that place realizing the ancient time that we are living in all the things that are happening and everything that is happening around us or even the devil or something I want to use the ones that you love the most right the ones that you love the most praise the Lord why because he want to damage that place in you where you can never rise to the place to ever think positive about that person for Faith perfect faith is a vision of Faith it's a vision Faith it's not a muff talking Faith people it's a vision fact it's not a mouth talking faith and I praise the Lord your man ought to pray a faint gnat because as soon as you break into the vision is over it's over as soon as you break into the vision and the Holy Ghost can project and show you yeah it's over praise the Lord It's Over say brother man I've never seen that animal that you are talking about I've hunted all of this mountain I've never seen it but say it was a vision if it is not yet maybe it's somewhere else but I've seen the vision and it never failed even though a terrorist but it never fail because it always speak for itself and that's what happened when perfect raise you up to the place where it had created a vision yeah praise the Lord all things will happen the church were rocking and paint some oh Peppa Pig has created a vision praise the Lord we're going to stay with that Vision than to follow your emotion and all of your destruction no we're going to stay with that Vision because it never fails praise the Lord you see that's the reason why you don't you don't you don't you I mean you are not moved but oh yeah I mean 10 person come to church today oh the church is growing you know many people no no no no no no you get a vision yes there's a vision of where we are going [Music] the vision is not about how many people it's about where we are going praise the Lord amen amen ought to pray always and faint net and faintness because when the son of man cometh those are the kind of for people that we have the son of man faith in the hour of the son of man praise the Lord amen amen most of these people that have you know are saying all of these things and falling on the Wayside you know they were they were just they were just hoping that a Rapture come quickly just like brother Branham says here he says I was I was honored I was on a depression I was saying oh my God Lord my wife told my wife I just want to go to be with the Lord the Holy Ghost said you want to bypass it right you want to bypass the test amen yeah glory be to God are you afraid of Philly are you afraid is it there's a fear in you that you will fail you know what helps you to overcome your fear is a vision right it's a vision praise the Lord by the word raise you to a place where you have a vision it helps you to overcome your fear praise the Lord when the devil brings down you say when I fought I Rise Again I see myself there I have to get there because I've seen it praise the Lord so you see that is the kind of a virtue you you read about uh people that spend their time with the Lord in praying you know and just like I said you know Birdman says here you know I read that because I was going to come back to it he talks about uh she got a character that she she must not Define and if if she will mind that she defined she defied for life now so you're just like we took the the the spiritual part he's talking about a physical woman yeah we we took the spiritual part of Faith you realize that uh I mean that's why we have all of these you know constant fighting until you know uh the Rapture or our last birth we will keep fighting right amen because like the prophet said you know Christ is revealing this whole in his own word he says there's a place now every one of us he says they don't have the right to that place he says and that is a place that we have to keep under the blood where did it come from from our our natural birth amen it comes from our natural birth so you see so it is it is other place where you will uh uh yeah I'm I'm kind of for trusting the Lord to keep me here I don't want to get so much and take much of your time tonight but it is at a place where you you learn and start seeing how to appreciate the grace of God amen just like I said on Sunday you know uh uh I mean uh people like brother Brown says we read that you know uh you don't we we don't know the story behind those women right but yet they had the best story of redemption you know we don't know about him try to give us a glance of the story behind those women the rehab uh other parents and some of the things that was going on they put their dollar in the street to you know to make money but yeah there was a predestinated seed in her right praise the Lord amen so you see that there are places where uh uh uh uh when it comes even to to the to the to the Natural Woman I mean there are some I mean because of whatever their experience was uh uh you know uh they never had the grace to to go right into marriage you know uh uh in in the virtual state but God has given them the grace to to to to be blessed with their Womanhood after they have been safe you tell me about decency praise the Lord amen now you think about this she gets so decent and so honorable that there is no way to be able to associate her with a miserable life in the past that's right amen yeah some went through all a source of struggle but yet they are such a mother to their children praise the Lord sure mother such an example so you see what I'm saying here is that uh some of the the wrong teachings that have gone with this right that people misunderstand this in in their but I said Broadband says you are defiled for life so which means that it just it just destroys you all everywhere of your life I mean if you even bring it if you even bring it back to the bride of Christ after we've been safe praise the Lord amen I mean I I saw some of some of the some of the brothers that they don't tell you the their testimony you will never even know that uh I mean they have they have ever done anything wrong sure right because the grace of God raises a man up to such to such a place her we are now putting on the church name we are putting on the name of Jesus Christ the Lord you see that I mean just like I said on Sunday I mean where do you go then you hear people teaching on the three sacraments you like the way brother Branham taught him that's the reason why in marriage in that voice he brings out the point of misinterpreted your logic right some of the things that were that were taught wrong where do you go that you heard that I mean what what what book what what preacher out there that ever is able to take this apply it to the church and talks about why God gave it to the woman you won't you will not find it you will not find it because all of these things are tied back to the seals they attack back to the Mysteries right it's something that has been a mystery yes sir praise the Lord is being a mystery a little girl uh as small as she is and uh she always have her daughter it's in her to be a mother right she has that mystery in her to be a mother as soon as she started getting up eight uh 9 10 12 years old she started becoming very particular of what she want to wear why make sure to do that Womanhood she wants to appeared nice she do her hair like this what makes her to do that because it's in her praise the Lord because but all down through the the ages the the the the the light of God never shine on this subject for preachers to to pick it up yeah right praise the Lord some you know I knew that it was it was important you look over in the Old Testament you see the important that I mean that that a young woman must leave her father house to her husband house right praise the Lord even beside that there were there are cultures that that that that that teach that also sure Robert Brownwood talks about coming from South Africa and seeing some of the things that were don't be which he said it would be a shame if that ever is trying so those things were in nature so brother Brandon bringing it it was not like a law to the church but it was to show us this is the same thing that the Church of God is lacking you know it's the same thing that the Believers like he will never live an overcoming life if he does not have Devotion to prayer to the word and a relationship with Jesus Christ he can never live an overcoming life he can only live a church life he can live a church life he can fight for the message the prophet says this is that that's how it's supposed to be and then but he can never live an overcoming life true because a man not living an overcoming life we knows in his heart the things that he's guilty of that's why when Jesus says he said anyone among you that have not seen you cast the first stone praise the Lord they were holding the courts the prophet said this woman must be stoned but they were not living and overcoming life amen right they were all guilty and the Word was able to pick up guilt in them young people this this is not for you to strive this is to make you an overcomer mom is to make you an overcomer now for you to be afraid and what what is going to happen if I if I get a job no you have to have an experience with Christ to know that when you are stepping out there you are a son of God and Heaven is behind you [Music] praise the Lord removed if the son of May cometh will he find faith praise the Lord will he find faith no wonder we can have a plague like Coronavirus you find people they have sought in message churches listened to the prophet being afraid are we in the tribulation oh my God the tribulation we tribulation has come I miss the rapture they were just in church they had no relationship with Christ if you have a relationship with Christ you know there is no Rapture without you praise the Lord amen but I want I know you're going nowhere without me brother I know that there's no rapture praise the Lord amen so I don't wake up in the morning and I don't see my family and says where my wife going the Rapture took place the Lord is having that relationship with Christ the certainty praise the Lord after your day your day's work is done you retire you sit down you read the word you meditate you put your heart in communion with God they say father if I didn't live my best today forgive me give me Grace

life down and they were just try to instead of being a blessing try to just make the service miserable for them but sister you have to be grateful you have to be grateful I mean where where were we
