[44:27] so i went to thinking i mean having
[44:30] 25 years anniversary what different can
[44:33] we do
[44:34] are we going to i didn't want us to rent
[44:36] at a hotel
[44:37] i wanted for the services to be here so
[44:40] we started thinking about it
[44:43] and i felt in my heart like i inherited
[44:47] this church
[44:48] with this building so i thought that
[44:51] well maybe i could do something special
[44:55] as
[44:55] as as an appreciation to the people
[44:59] so uh we came up with this project we
[45:01] spoke with brother jordan
[45:03] and a few of the other brothers
[45:09] says well maybe we can just change the
[45:12] carpet paint the building
[45:15] break down the office and
[45:18] uh but jordan said okay i'll work on it
[45:21] and he went together and he put a plane
[45:24] together
[45:26] and this was supposed to be at three
[45:28] weeks work
[45:30] it turned to be a four months work
[45:35] uh the man that we hired for the job
[45:38] good
[45:39] gentlemen good christian man we would
[45:41] not demonize them
[45:44] just the that for some reason
[45:48] they could not get the job done on time
[45:51] and it just couldn't do it right so
[45:55] you know i would leave from work every
[45:56] day and come and meet them here and i
[45:58] would tell them i said look you are
[45:59] robbing me
[46:00] i don't have an office i don't have a
[46:03] place to come in
[46:04] and you know and just have a private
[46:07] time
[46:08] when i get home i want to spend time
[46:10] with my family
[46:12] and so i'll come here all the time
[46:15] but it came to a place where we talked
[46:17] that it was necessary
[46:19] for us to just come get to on
[46:22] a good end and even end with them
[46:25] and then whatever that is
[46:28] left over with the help of
[46:32] the brothers we will be able to finish
[46:34] it ourselves
[46:37] so
[46:40] last sunday we worked all through the
[46:42] night i think we left from here
[46:44] last saturday maybe about 1am or so
[46:49] to be able to have last sunday service
[46:51] here
[46:52] which of course you and i year
[46:55] because we had ladders all year i mean
[46:58] the video did where not to show you this
[47:00] place
[47:01] you wouldn't have believed it you know
[47:03] ladders and wires all over the place
[47:06] i think you can see one standing out
[47:08] there in the hall
[47:09] you know i preached on the ladder last
[47:11] sunday but a farmer we have a ladder
[47:13] you're going to get on jacob's ladder
[47:15] this morning
[47:17] praise the lord so but that was the
[47:20] purpose of this
[47:22] and for no we will not regret it for one
[47:26] for one reason for no reason that's what
[47:28] i want to say
[47:30] and we are so thankful to be able to
[47:33] have a body
[47:34] to be able to have people that we can
[47:37] call our
[47:38] brothers and sisters and people
[47:41] that god has given to us to be able to
[47:44] grab the vision
[47:45] of what we are trying to do on this
[47:48] little corner
[47:50] and uh
[47:53] and we we've been so glad you know all
[47:56] of these years all the few years that
[47:58] we've been
[47:59] we've been working with this assembly
[48:02] so because we were not having an
[48:05] anniversary
[48:06] meeting because of the change of
[48:07] everything that was happening
[48:09] we just thought that i just thought i
[48:12] know
[48:13] uh you know i i fought with some of the
[48:15] brothers
[48:16] he says wow the place is not done let's
[48:18] just get it right
[48:19] i just i just felt in my heart it's not
[48:23] you know it's not the it's not the
[48:25] building you know what we want is the
[48:27] word of god
[48:28] in the midst of the people so
[48:31] so i called brother farmer i know we
[48:34] throw up
[48:35] meetings and meetings over and over
[48:37] cancer with him call him back cancel
[48:39] with him
[48:40] so i just called him the other week i
[48:42] said well we will not have the
[48:43] anniversary meeting
[48:45] but we will sure have you come and
[48:46] preach for us that we can
[48:49] be leaving there we will have got
[48:51] everything done and have a saturday
[48:52] night sunday
[48:54] morning service but we just we couldn't
[48:55] get it done and i'm telling you brother
[48:58] farmer was
[48:58] he was into the plow yesterday put him
[49:01] simmering on the wall
[49:02] and plastering and everything so we had
[49:06] a great time here
[49:07] and but
[49:11] here we are it feels so good
[49:15] to be with god's people
[49:18] if he's so good to be with brothers and
[49:20] sisters
[49:23] of light precious faith praise the lord
[49:26] we will greet our dear brother and
[49:30] his wife from pennsylvania but brad
[49:33] there's uh
[49:33] brother anderson sister christian dad
[49:36] but andrew's father-in-law
[49:38] uh they drove down and to visit with
[49:41] them and
[49:42] came to service with us god bless you we
[49:45] thank the lord for granting you a safe
[49:47] travel
[49:48] praise lord amen
[49:51] amen sister grace
[49:58] it's so easy to forget about you when
[50:00] you are here you know because you are
[50:01] home
[50:02] and sister grace and her boy is from
[50:04] tennessee
[50:05] visiting with her dad and mom bruce cat
[50:08] and his wife
[50:10] and uh and everyone that is following us
[50:13] online this morning so brother farmer
[50:15] will be preaching
[50:16] this morning whatever the lord placed on
[50:18] his heart
[50:19] as we normally do and this evening
[50:25] we will we will get back
[50:28] uh maybe an hour before the service
[50:31] stack
[50:32] i love to play the tape only believe
[50:35] [Music]
[50:38] 1961 was in that meeting
[50:42] that the holy spirit called brother
[50:44] brother farmer out as a little boy
[50:46] and
[50:50] and he'll tell you all about it tonight
[50:52] and the reason of that
[50:55] one is because we still have
[50:58] eyewitnesses
[50:59] of what we believe like i said
[51:03] last sunday after all
[51:06] period experience with the lord jesus he
[51:09] said we are not following
[51:10] conan devised people but we are
[51:14] eyewitnesses
[51:15] [Music]
[51:16] of his resurrection
[51:20] that was one of the reason and the
[51:22] second reason
[51:24] is that after being away out of these
[51:26] months
[51:27] i thank the the chief shepherd for
[51:29] keeping you amen
[51:30] because there's no way i could keep you
[51:33] praise the lord
[51:34] but i said that every time i say lord
[51:36] you are the chief shepherd
[51:38] you know where your people are you know
[51:41] their needs
[51:42] even though we are not gathering
[51:43] together but you are able to minister
[51:46] counsel pray for them i mean just just
[51:49] help them in whatever ways
[51:51] and if we just passed the microphone to
[51:54] testify this morning
[51:55] there are some testimonies that we just
[51:58] run and just fill this wrong
[52:00] but we want to give the time to the word
[52:02] of the lord
[52:03] amen so the second reason
[52:07] was to be able to create an atmosphere
[52:11] that will build faith we all know we are
[52:15] living in strange times
[52:16] there never been a time we have to come
[52:18] to church with max
[52:20] take our temperature the hand sanitizer
[52:23] and all of that
[52:24] and these are just strange times
[52:27] [Music]
[52:30] but these are the times where we need
[52:32] faith
[52:35] because jesus said when the son of the
[52:38] son of man come will he find
[52:40] faith and we can say yes lord
[52:44] if you come you will find faith you will
[52:47] find people contending for the faith
[52:49] that was once delivered to the sins
[52:52] [Music]
[52:54] so we will use this evening service to
[52:56] build faith
[52:57] and uh and he will preach to us and just
[53:00] as the holy spirit will lead him
[53:02] we will pray we will worship and we will
[53:04] just
[53:05] commit everything in the hands of the
[53:07] lord let's stand to our feet
[53:08] and
[53:12] let's sing amazing grace it was amazing
[53:14] grace
[53:16] where family you can come up
[53:20] [Music]
[53:26] god
[53:28] [Music]
[53:37] like me
[53:43] [Music]
[53:50] oh but now i'm
[53:55] [Music]
[54:09] amen thank god for his amazing grace
[54:12] there's a little song that we sing at
[54:14] home i don't know if y'all know it or
[54:17] not if not i'll try to teach it to you
[54:20] it says lord lord lord you've surely
[54:23] been good to me
[54:25] lord lord lord you've surely been good
[54:27] to me
[54:28] lord lord lord you've surely been good
[54:31] to me
[54:32] you have done what this world couldn't
[54:34] do
[54:35] it's a little bit of a happy song but
[54:38] church i believe we've got something
[54:39] this morning to be happy about
[54:42] then it goes on to say you healed my
[54:44] body when i was sick
[54:48] then another verse even says you saved
[54:51] my soul when i was
[54:52] lost and then there's another verse
[54:56] you know we can get healed and get sick
[54:59] again
[55:00] [Music]
[55:03] but when he fills you with the holy
[55:06] ghost and we are sealed into the kingdom
[55:09] there's no taking that away because
[55:12] we're sealed to the day of our
[55:14] redemption
[55:16] oh lord lord lord
[55:19] you've surely been good oh
[55:22] lord lord you've surely been good to me
[55:28] lord lord you've surely been good
[55:32] [Music]
[55:45] you healed my body when i was sick
[55:48] you've surely been good to me
[56:08] you saved my soul when i was lost you've
[56:11] surely been good
[56:13] you saved my soul
[56:15] [Music]
[56:23] now now if he hasn't filled you with the
[56:27] holy ghost
[56:31] i was talking to some of the brothers
[56:32] yesterday the most
[56:34] dangerous time to drive a vehicle is
[56:37] that twilight time when it's
[56:40] not really nighttime and it's not really
[56:42] daylight i don't care if it's in the
[56:44] morning
[56:45] just as it's breaking day or if it's in
[56:48] the evening
[56:49] when the nighttime's coming on the deer
[56:51] will come out because they feel
[56:53] comfortable
[56:54] being in those shatters right on the
[56:56] side of the road
[57:00] it's the most dangerous time and you let
[57:03] a christian that
[57:04] gives their life to the lord but they've
[57:07] not come under the seal of the holy
[57:09] ghost
[57:10] it's the most dangerous time of the
[57:12] world
[57:15] oh but to us that have entered in
[57:19] it's the most glorious time
[57:21] [Music]
[57:25] if you can't sing this from this last
[57:28] verse from the bottom of your heart
[57:30] i challenge you to not leave the
[57:34] building
[57:35] until you know that you've been filled
[57:38] with the holy ghost
[57:42] oh you killed me with the holy ghost
[57:46] you've surely been good to me you
[57:49] filled me with the holy ghost you surely
[57:52] thank
[57:56] [Music]
[58:06] me amen god bless y'all
[58:11] it's good to be back up here with you
[58:14] been several years
[58:17] but we uh i i've enjoyed my time already
[58:22] you'll be seated for just a minute if
[58:24] you want to
[58:25] i've enjoyed my time already with you
[58:29] over at brother carlin's yesterday was
[58:32] just sharing some testimonies seen the
[58:35] lord just do
[58:37] some wonderful things brother uh juan
[58:40] hernandez here with us
[58:42] he told brother scott he said if you
[58:44] don't give me a
[58:45] a seat on the front row i don't think
[58:47] i'm even coming
[58:50] but you know you get to talking about
[58:52] the lord and we've got a promise of this
[58:55] that when we start talking about him
[58:57] that he comes around
[59:00] amen and uh my i thought one time
[59:03] brother juan was just gonna jump
[59:05] up and run off on us you know he but the
[59:08] presence of the lord
[59:10] comes around and and you know i i live
[59:13] for that uh you know we've sent a
[59:15] meeting here uh uh
[59:16] i guess it's been about four years ago
[59:19] out in new mexico and
[59:21] and the presence of the lord was so real
[59:23] that there's a
[59:25] a minister a brother kenny capps sent a
[59:29] a message a
[59:32] a missionary and he goes all over the
[59:36] country and his wife was in the meeting
[59:38] and
[59:38] they had a little boy there at the time
[59:40] about seven or eight years old
[59:42] and just the presence of the lord swept
[59:45] through the
[59:46] building while brother wayne lawson was
[59:48] preaching
[59:49] he went skipping across the platform
[59:52] hollering i'm going in the rapture i'm
[59:54] going in the rapture
[59:56] and just wave after wave of the presence
[59:59] of the lord
[1:00:00] swept through and that sister thought
[1:00:02] she was leaving the ground right then
[1:00:04] and turned around to grab her little
[1:00:06] boy's hand because she didn't believe
[1:00:08] him
[1:00:10] i'm not content to live out of that
[1:00:13] presence
[1:00:15] i don't want it to just be a for a
[1:00:18] little time
[1:00:18] here and a little time there but oh i
[1:00:21] just
[1:00:22] i'm not content
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:26] you take somebody that really gets
[1:00:28] hooked on drugs
[1:00:30] they're not happy unless they're doing
[1:00:33] drugs
[1:00:34] i want you to know i'm a junkie of jesus
[1:00:38] i'm hooked on jesus i'm an addict to
[1:00:43] jesus
[1:00:46] and it's my desire to stay in his
[1:00:49] presence
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:52] god bless y'all brother juan thank you
[1:00:54] for having us up here and

[1:01:03] to have different preachers come in and
[1:01:06] but you know really all we want is one
[1:01:08] preacher and that's

[1:01:13] lord willing we'll we'll talk to you on
[1:01:15] that in just a minute but
[1:01:17] if you want to stand with me again we'll
[1:01:20] we'll read a couple of scriptures
[1:01:22] and uh uh witnessing to a lady there in
[1:01:26] the
[1:01:27] the the motel this morning her name was
[1:01:30] mary and she'd ask that we would
[1:01:31] remember her
[1:01:33] husband and her son both of them needing
[1:01:35] a touch from the lord
[1:01:39] we how many believes that
[1:01:43] the lord is the best mechanic that there
[1:01:46] is
[1:01:48] i've seen it
[1:01:51] as a matter of fact a minister that
[1:01:54] was with y'all down there at manchester
[1:01:57] brother dale potter
[1:01:58] one time he had a transmission go out on
[1:02:01] him on a car
[1:02:02] while he was out on a preaching trip and
[1:02:05] they laid hands on the car and god
[1:02:07] healed the transmission and he drove it
[1:02:09] for another 50 000 miles
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:16] one time i was going up north to visit
[1:02:18] my daddy and it started

[1:02:34] out and i popped the hood and i looked
[1:02:36] at it and i
[1:02:37] i thought well i don't see nothing wrong
[1:02:39] there's no fire
[1:02:40] jumping all over the place and we got
[1:02:43] back in the car
[1:02:44] started driving a little bit farther
[1:02:47] and just about two miles down the road
[1:02:49] it started cutting out again
[1:02:52] and i pulled over on the side of the
[1:02:54] road you know sometimes when you don't
[1:02:56] know what to do
[1:02:58] just follow instructions
[1:03:03] so i prayed
[1:03:06] and i got done praying and it was just
[1:03:09] laid on my heart to uh
[1:03:13] i asked my wife i said do you have an
[1:03:15] old burp diaper or something we had
[1:03:17] small children in the car with us

[1:03:24] and uh i said let me have it and i
[1:03:30] popped the hood and i
[1:03:31] wrapped that burp diaper around the
[1:03:34] distributor

[1:03:42] but we got in the car and drove the rest
[1:03:44] of the way up to chicago

[1:06:33] how many years that brother juan has
[1:06:35] been here with him lord
[1:06:38] we appreciate those things all but
[1:06:42] most of all lord we appreciate you
[1:06:46] may you come down amongst us lord take
[1:06:49] me and
[1:06:50] use me for thy glory i pray
[1:06:53] in the name of jesus
[1:06:58] amen amen
[1:07:01] god bless you if you turn with me in
[1:07:04] john
[1:07:05] chapter 12.
[1:07:11] i'd like to read a couple of scriptures
[1:07:15] starting there at the
[1:07:16] the 20th verse down through the 24th
[1:07:27] john 12 and verse 20.
[1:07:32] and there were certain greeks among them
[1:07:35] that came up to worship at the feast
[1:07:39] and the same came therefore to philip
[1:07:42] and said
[1:07:44] which was of beseda of galilee and
[1:07:47] desired him
[1:07:48] saying sir we would see jesus
[1:07:53] philip cometh and telleth andrew and
[1:07:56] and again andrew and philip tell jesus
[1:08:00] and jesus answered them saying the hour
[1:08:04] has come that the son of man
[1:08:06] should be glorified verily verily
[1:08:10] i say unto you accept a corn of wheat
[1:08:14] fall
[1:08:15] into the ground and die it shall abide
[1:08:18] alone
[1:08:19] but if it die it bringeth forth
[1:08:24] much fruit and then also in ephesians
[1:08:27] the fourth
[1:08:28] chapter very familiar scripture starting
[1:08:33] at
[1:08:33] verse nine now he that ascended
[1:08:38] what is it but that he also descended
[1:08:41] first into the lower parts of the earth
[1:08:44] he that descended
[1:08:46] is the same also that ascended
[1:08:50] up far above all heavens that he might
[1:08:53] feel
[1:08:54] all things and he gave some
[1:08:59] apostles and some prophets
[1:09:02] and some evangelists and some
[1:09:06] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:09:10] of the saints
[1:09:12] for the work of the ministry
[1:09:15] for the edifying of the body
[1:09:18] of christ may the lord add his blessings
[1:09:21] to his word and
[1:09:22] you can feel free to be seated but if
[1:09:25] you
[1:09:26] later feel like just jumping up and
[1:09:28] praising the lord that's fine too
[1:09:32] against such we have no customs
[1:09:37] you know what a striking thing
[1:09:41] uh we uh we find that
[1:09:46] took place here
[1:09:49] and it had been just an odd day
[1:09:51] altogether
[1:09:53] that you know
[1:09:57] the lord jesus had had told a couple of
[1:10:01] the disciples
[1:10:03] said uh tell you what i want you to do
[1:10:06] you go over here to this village that's
[1:10:08] right over here by us
[1:10:10] and just as soon as you get into town
[1:10:13] you're gonna find a donkey tied up with
[1:10:15] a
[1:10:16] little old colt foal with her
[1:10:19] and no man's ever ridden on that cult
[1:10:22] but
[1:10:22] i want you to loose it and bring it
[1:10:27] and if anybody asks you anything about
[1:10:30] it just tell them the lord has a
[1:10:32] a need of this and they'll turn it loose
[1:10:35] to let you bring it
[1:10:38] so they went and they found that to be
[1:10:41] true
[1:10:43] they uh uh of course we can find in
[1:10:45] matthew and mark where
[1:10:47] it it goes through the whole story of it
[1:10:50] uh of how that they said uh hey ma'am
[1:10:52] what are you doing turning that cold
[1:10:54] loose and uh
[1:10:58] they said the master has need of it
[1:11:04] and of course the lord jesus got upon
[1:11:08] that cold
[1:11:12] and you know we're surrounded by a virus
[1:11:15] right now
[1:11:20] in case you hadn't heard
[1:11:28] and nobody knows what to do for it
[1:11:32] they don't have a vaccination for it but
[1:11:35] i know an inoculation
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:48] they they give us advice to do things
[1:11:51] one way and then
[1:11:52] a month later tell us no that's the
[1:11:54] wrong thing to do don't do it
[1:11:56] and a month later tell us go back to
[1:11:58] doing what we told you to do in the
[1:11:59] first place
[1:12:02] they don't know what to do because they
[1:12:05] never rode this donkey before
[1:12:12] but i want you to know that the the
[1:12:15] creator
[1:12:18] of the donkey it didn't have to be
[1:12:22] broke by somebody to ride when he got on
[1:12:26] it he had dominion over it
[1:12:28] the same way that you and i have
[1:12:30] dominion
[1:12:31] over every circumstance that's apt to
[1:12:34] come up in our life we've been given
[1:12:36] dominion over
[1:12:38] all things are under our feet by the
[1:12:40] name of jesus christ
[1:12:42] amen oh it had been a strange day
[1:12:47] he rode into town and when he did they
[1:12:50] were pulling off their coats and
[1:12:52] throwing it down and
[1:12:54] and they were cutting limbs off of trees
[1:12:57] and
[1:12:58] and strewing them down in the way that
[1:13:00] that the lord jesus would come through
[1:13:03] and the donkey was walking on this
[1:13:06] carpet
[1:13:07] of clothes and limbs that they had
[1:13:09] thrown out there
[1:13:13] and they started hollering hosanna
[1:13:17] blessed be the king
[1:13:22] where we get the song that we sing
[1:13:26] hosanna blessed be the rock
[1:13:31] and you know the thing of it was they
[1:13:33] did not even
[1:13:34] understand they were being moved by the
[1:13:38] spirit
[1:13:41] oh i think it's important for us to get
[1:13:44] in the spirit
[1:13:44] the prophet of god told us that we ought
[1:13:47] to pray for revelation
[1:13:48] more than everything else
[1:13:52] but they was inspired to do it and they
[1:13:55] didn't even
[1:13:56] realize that they was living what
[1:13:59] zechariah 9 9 had
[1:14:02] had prophesied that it that would be
[1:14:05] done
[1:14:07] it was a strange time
[1:14:11] the lord jesus was coming into town and
[1:14:14] you know it wasn't the first time
[1:14:17] that he had went down to jerusalem
[1:14:21] the scripture tells us when he's just a
[1:14:23] 12 or 13 year old boy you all know the
[1:14:25] story that
[1:14:27] three days journey back mama and daddy
[1:14:30] starts looking for him
[1:14:31] and they can't find him and they thought
[1:14:34] that he was with them and
[1:14:35] how we see that typed out with the
[1:14:38] nominal church they just keep going on
[1:14:41] and they thought that god was with them
[1:14:43] they've not seen him
[1:14:44] in their midst they've they've not felt
[1:14:46] his presence for years and years
[1:14:49] but they thought that he was with them
[1:14:52] but i got news for you wherever you've
[1:14:54] left him is where you got to go back to
[1:14:57] so we see that when they could not find
[1:15:00] him but they had turned around
[1:15:01] and went back and no doubt as the lord
[1:15:04] jesus
[1:15:05] was going into jerusalem for this
[1:15:07] passover feast
[1:15:09] those things came back to mind and he
[1:15:11] might have remembered
[1:15:13] about how that when they came and said
[1:15:15] where have you been
[1:15:19] he said i've been about the father's
[1:15:21] business
[1:15:22] i said maybe joseph looked at him said
[1:15:25] son
[1:15:25] ain't no carpentry work to do down here
[1:15:28] he said oh
[1:15:28] but we're building a kingdom
[1:15:33] oh yeah i was about the father's
[1:15:35] business
[1:15:38] you might be the one that provides the
[1:15:40] meals that i eat but you're not my
[1:15:43] father
[1:15:44] because what was wrong in in mary was of
[1:15:48] the holy ghost it was another man
[1:15:53] a strange day
[1:15:58] and you know the scripture tells us when
[1:16:01] we
[1:16:01] if you was to read the entire chapter
[1:16:04] there in
[1:16:06] in uh john 12
[1:16:10] of how that the lord jesus was fixing to
[1:16:14] go to a dinner before the
[1:16:16] the passover down at mary and martha and
[1:16:19] lazarus's house
[1:16:22] and there was a lot of people that was
[1:16:24] coming into town
[1:16:26] for this passover feast
[1:16:34] but they wasn't just coming to see jesus
[1:16:39] they also wanted to see lazarus because
[1:16:42] they had heard that there was a miracle
[1:16:44] that had taken place
[1:16:46] and they wanted to see him and the jews
[1:16:49] were
[1:16:50] so against the ministry of
[1:16:53] jesus christ
[1:16:58] that they wanted to kill lazarus because
[1:17:01] lazarus
[1:17:02] as brother one was saying this morning
[1:17:05] was a witness
[1:17:06] of the miracle that had been done
[1:17:10] they didn't only want to kill jesus they
[1:17:12] wanted to kill a witness so
[1:17:14] the same way that the enemy trying to
[1:17:17] tear down the message of the hour trying
[1:17:20] to tear down
[1:17:21] the ministry of jesus christ in this day
[1:17:25] is also desiring to tear you down
[1:17:28] because
[1:17:28] we are witnesses of what god has done
[1:17:33] hallelujah what i'd like to look at for
[1:17:37] just a few minutes
[1:17:39] is the fruits of the ministry
[1:17:44] of jesus christ
[1:17:47] so one of these greeks that that comes
[1:17:50] in they they they go up to the disciples
[1:17:54] and
[1:17:54] to philip and andrew and says sirs we
[1:17:58] we'd love to see jesus okay can you get
[1:18:01] us an appointment with him
[1:18:04] can you get us an interview with him
[1:18:07] so they talked it over amongst
[1:18:09] themselves and they go and tell
[1:18:11] jesus and jesus said boys it's time
[1:18:16] oh don't you just love it when god says
[1:18:19] it's time
[1:18:21] amen you might have been praying for
[1:18:23] healing for a long time
[1:18:26] you might have been praying to come back
[1:18:28] to church here for three months
[1:18:32] but wasn't you glad when somebody gave
[1:18:34] you a telephone call
[1:18:36] and said it's time amen
[1:18:40] it's time all things are ready
[1:18:45] oh we're longing to hear that once again
[1:18:47] aren't we
[1:18:49] amen but the lord jesus
[1:18:54] presents himself to these greeks
[1:18:58] which remember was a type of you and i
[1:19:02] he was surrounded by the jews but now
[1:19:05] he's turning to
[1:19:10] greeks
[1:19:14] and he doesn't walk out and say i'm the
[1:19:17] messiah that you've been longing to see
[1:19:20] he didn't say i'm jesus of nazareth
[1:19:25] but instead he started teaching them
[1:19:28] of the law of sowing
[1:19:31] and reaping now we're surrounded by farm
[1:19:35] country up here
[1:19:37] and i don't know of any of these farmers
[1:19:39] sister carlin that has ever
[1:19:42] went out and planted one
[1:19:45] bushel of corn that they was expecting
[1:19:48] this fall to get one bushel
[1:19:51] of corn
[1:19:59] out of this 140 acres how much you think
[1:20:02] you're going to get
[1:20:04] oh they might be expecting 120 bushels
[1:20:08] an acre but he ain't looking back for
[1:20:11] one bushel
[1:20:14] because if that corn of wheat goes into
[1:20:17] the ground
[1:20:23] and it dies
[1:20:26] it's going to bring back many times
[1:20:31] an odd way that when somebody says i
[1:20:34] want to see
[1:20:35] jesus he starts talking about a corn of
[1:20:37] wheat dying
[1:20:44] amen a lot of people came to the prophet
[1:20:48] of god and they said
[1:20:49] sir we want to see jesus the first thing
[1:20:52] he go to doing is preaching to him about
[1:20:55] divine healing
[1:20:56] and how to accept it they say
[1:20:59] but we want to see a miracle but first
[1:21:01] we had to be taught
[1:21:02] how to even accept it these greeks
[1:21:05] desire
[1:21:06] to see the lord jesus and the lord jesus
[1:21:09] started telling them about a crop that
[1:21:12] was fixing to come
[1:21:13] behind him
[1:21:20] a striking odd way that the lord jesus
[1:21:23] had of presenting that
[1:21:25] and we know that the prophet of god used
[1:21:28] this
[1:21:28] subject matter a number of times
[1:21:32] uh uh on why sirs we would see jesus the
[1:21:35] unveiling of god
[1:21:39] the masterpiece spiritual food in
[1:21:42] in due season boy i'd like to stop right
[1:21:47] there for a minute but
[1:21:48] maybe we'll do that tonight
[1:21:52] things that are to be
[1:21:56] let me back up here just second but the
[1:21:59] last
[1:22:00] four or five messages that brother
[1:22:02] branham preached before he went off the
[1:22:04] scene
[1:22:07] three times he brings up these
[1:22:10] scriptures
[1:22:12] in things that are to be on the rapture
[1:22:16] and on leadership the only one that i
[1:22:19] know
[1:22:19] of of the last sermons that brother
[1:22:21] branham preached
[1:22:23] that he did not mention these scriptures
[1:22:25] was communion
[1:22:26] and when you've got communion you've got
[1:22:28] john 12.
[1:22:31] amen
[1:22:36] sounds like he right there at the end he
[1:22:38] was really trying to get us to see
[1:22:40] something doesn't it you know when
[1:22:44] when the lord jesus was speaking there
[1:22:47] was times that he was driving a point
[1:22:49] down
[1:22:50] and we read it in our scriptures and it
[1:22:53] he'd say verily
[1:22:54] verily and of course the the scholars
[1:22:58] had looked into that and they
[1:22:59] told us and and the prophet of god made
[1:23:02] mention of it
[1:23:03] that it it the meaning of that was truly
[1:23:06] truly i say unto you
[1:23:07] it's putting emphasis on it but here we
[1:23:10] find at the very end of the prophet of
[1:23:12] god's ministry
[1:23:13] of how he put emphasis on three
[1:23:16] different times just right in a row
[1:23:18] that he mentions these things
[1:23:22] now
[1:23:26] the ministry the fruits of the ministry
[1:23:31] of jesus christ
[1:23:34] now the world has a pattern
[1:23:37] and in that pattern you notice you you
[1:23:40] take a preacher that it seems like that
[1:23:42] the lord does
[1:23:43] a little something in his life and all
[1:23:45] of a sudden they want
[1:23:47] so and so ministry
[1:23:51] pardon me for calling a couple names but
[1:23:53] they don't mind
[1:23:54] publicizing what uh kenneth copeland
[1:23:58] ministries
[1:24:01] billy graham ministries
[1:24:06] all these other uh uh jimmy swaggart
[1:24:09] ministries
[1:24:13] order order my books from
[1:24:18] jsm
[1:24:26] and i wonder if we haven't even let that
[1:24:28] trickle down into the message just a
[1:24:30] little bit
[1:24:32] let me tell you something it better not
[1:24:34] be about the man you lift up a man
[1:24:37] and that man will fall the prophet of
[1:24:40] god said don't put him on a pedestal
[1:24:45] we don't look to paul for our salvation
[1:24:48] we don't put paul on a pedestal
[1:24:52] we don't even put the prophet of god on
[1:24:54] a pedestal
[1:24:56] but the message that he brought was the
[1:25:00] word of god
[1:25:01] it was not
[1:25:05] it was not william branham ministry
[1:25:08] it was the ministry of jesus christ
[1:25:15] god's not willing to share his glory
[1:25:18] with anyone
[1:25:20] it's not brother one's ministry that has
[1:25:23] brought this church to the worship
[1:25:25] that you have it's the ministry of jesus
[1:25:29] christ that brings us to worship
[1:25:32] amen amen
[1:25:37] we don't follow that world pattern
[1:25:41] you know we read in the scriptures and
[1:25:44] even when it
[1:25:45] looks like that it's calling a certain
[1:25:47] man's
[1:25:48] ministry the prophet of god he uh
[1:25:51] many many many times and
[1:25:55] looking at the word zoe the life of god
[1:25:58] now
[1:25:59] some people would say oh brother force
[1:26:01] that only means
[1:26:02] life if a prophet tells me that a word
[1:26:08] means the life of god it's the life of
[1:26:11] god
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:17] if he tells me that logos
[1:26:22] was the word of god whether it was
[1:26:26] written or that the written word is
[1:26:29] just a thought that's expressed
[1:26:33] i believe that logos was logos
[1:26:36] when it was still in the mind of god if
[1:26:40] it had never been
[1:26:41] written yet but god said let there be
[1:26:44] didn't have a voice to speak it through
[1:26:47] but the
[1:26:47] thought of god that was in his mind it
[1:26:50] was
[1:26:51] then that it was still logos
[1:26:55] when he saw you and i before there was a
[1:26:58] foundation to the world
[1:27:00] oh my we was talking about this on
[1:27:02] brother scott's back porch here
[1:27:04] uh yesterday just a little bit
[1:27:07] the the world does not have a foundation
[1:27:11] that's made out of concrete and steel
[1:27:13] beams
[1:27:15] but it's held into its orbit by
[1:27:18] the the contrast between the gravity of
[1:27:21] the sun and the speed that it's going
[1:27:24] around
[1:27:24] and ten other you know they used to say
[1:27:27] nine planets when i was in school
[1:27:29] but about like your brother said you
[1:27:32] know he was talking he said now when i
[1:27:34] went to
[1:27:34] to medical school they said this but now
[1:27:37] we know more about it
[1:27:42] you know when when we was in school
[1:27:47] i saw dinosaurs
[1:27:51] they said nine planets but you know they
[1:27:53] had better telescopes now i guess
[1:27:56] so they they found that there's another
[1:27:58] one but all of these things
[1:28:00] even though we didn't know there was a
[1:28:02] tenth one there
[1:28:04] it was helping hold this earth in the
[1:28:07] orbit
[1:28:07] that it is then that's just the
[1:28:10] foundation of this world
[1:28:13] and then this earth is just one of ten
[1:28:16] planets
[1:28:16] that's in our solar system and they tell
[1:28:20] me that when we look up at night at the
[1:28:22] milky way
[1:28:23] that all that that looks like a white
[1:28:26] fog that
[1:28:27] in that band is all little teeny tiny
[1:28:30] stars and we can't even count how many
[1:28:33] that there is
[1:28:34] but then they estimate that there are as
[1:28:37] many more uni in the universe
[1:28:41] as much as we can see in the whole milky
[1:28:44] way
[1:28:44] there's that many more milky ways out
[1:28:47] there
[1:28:48] and then we try and put god in a little
[1:28:51] bitty box somewhere
[1:28:53] that if god don't do something the way
[1:28:55] that we think it fits in
[1:28:57] in our little theological box that god
[1:29:00] can't do it that way
[1:29:01] you ain't gonna put god in that box
[1:29:04] he's the one that made all of it
[1:29:08] he's the one that made you and i
[1:29:12] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:29:15] now in the dialogue that brother branham
[1:29:18] would look at him
[1:29:19] and see these words from how it came in
[1:29:22] the new testament directly from the
[1:29:25] greek
[1:29:25] i i don't know the greek
[1:29:28] i can't pronounce it
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:38] but the word
[1:29:41] that they use
[1:29:44] for ministry when it was
[1:29:48] when paul was speaking to timothy and
[1:29:51] telling him
[1:29:52] take make full proof of thy ministry
[1:29:57] it wasn't so that timothy could say
[1:30:00] this is my ministry
[1:30:04] see timothy was saying the same thing
[1:30:06] that paul said
[1:30:09] so because paul was preaching the
[1:30:12] ministry of jesus christ
[1:30:14] timothy was also preaching the ministry
[1:30:18] of jesus christ
[1:30:20] amen spirit led unorganized
[1:30:24] but just however the lord led to do it
[1:30:27] he'll lead an apostle to preach one way
[1:30:30] he'll have a teacher to do another he'll
[1:30:32] have an evangelist
[1:30:34] to do another he's got a pastor doing
[1:30:36] another
[1:30:37] but it's all by one spirit and it's
[1:30:40] all the ministry of jesus christ to his
[1:30:46] congregation
[1:30:48] brother david at home doesn't have a
[1:30:50] congregation
[1:30:52] the lord jesus has a congregation and my
[1:30:54] pastor
[1:30:55] is over that little group
[1:30:59] amen you know then that way if somebody
[1:31:03] gets up
[1:31:04] and they decide that they've got to
[1:31:05] leave it it don't
[1:31:07] it keeps us from getting hard feelings
[1:31:10] because it wasn't our people anyway
[1:31:14] it's god's people
[1:31:17] amen and when people come in
[1:31:20] we just glorify god because this is more
[1:31:23] of the body
[1:31:24] of god's people we're
[1:31:27] we're not a divided people
[1:31:32] hello we've got the world
[1:31:36] cosmos out here rioting
[1:31:39] because it's this against that against
[1:31:42] that against that and some of them say
[1:31:44] they're with this
[1:31:45] and actually what they're doing is
[1:31:46] fighting against all of them
[1:31:49] but that's not so with us because we
[1:31:52] that are in christ
[1:31:54] we are one we are one
[1:31:58] what makes a librarian sit down with an
[1:32:01] american
[1:32:02] with a guy in and with a disc and we're
[1:32:05] the colombian
[1:32:06] that we can all join together and praise
[1:32:10] the same lord jesus
[1:32:12] and
[1:32:17] rejoice over the same quotes
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:24] what is it that does it it's
[1:32:28] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:32:31] fellowship and with christ in you the
[1:32:34] hope of glory
[1:32:35] with christ in you the hope of glory
[1:32:38] and it's christ fellowshipping with
[1:32:41] christ
[1:32:42] because we're all in him
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:49] amen this word
[1:32:54] ministry was service
[1:33:03] boy that lets the wind out of my sails
[1:33:06] doesn't it forest farmer don't have a
[1:33:08] ministry
[1:33:10] imagine that brother one invited
[1:33:13] somebody up to preach to y'all
[1:33:15] that he don't even have a ministry
[1:33:19] he plays steel guitar somebody says oh
[1:33:23] brother farmer that that's a ministry of
[1:33:25] music
[1:33:27] well if you're going to call it a
[1:33:30] service
[1:33:33] because i'm not there for anybody to see
[1:33:35] me
[1:33:37] when i'm playing music just like all
[1:33:38] these folks that's playing music here
[1:33:40] this morning
[1:33:41] they're not up so that uh oh man listen
[1:33:44] to this rep
[1:33:47] nope the only thing they're there to do
[1:33:52] is to help set the atmosphere
[1:33:55] where that the ministry of jesus christ
[1:33:59] is welcome to come down amongst us
[1:34:02] so they are also partakers of the
[1:34:05] ministry
[1:34:06] of jesus christ and just welcoming that
[1:34:10] spirit down
[1:34:11] that we can rejoice in him that saved us
[1:34:16] and sealed us into him
[1:34:19] it's not an individual ministry
[1:34:22] that's why that we can have four or five
[1:34:25] ministers
[1:34:26] come together and it's just like one
[1:34:29] is building a platform for the next
[1:34:31] night and then for the next night
[1:34:33] and then for the next night and then and
[1:34:36] it's not a competition
[1:34:40] god don't fight with himself
[1:34:43] no but you've got different vessels
[1:34:46] but they're just pouring out that same
[1:34:49] oil
[1:34:50] it came from the same spout
[1:34:55] you take on those seven golden candle
[1:34:58] sticks i
[1:34:58] i'm sorry i'm getting sidetracked
[1:35:00] because i can preach right here for
[1:35:02] about three or four hours
[1:35:04] on those seven golden candlesticks on
[1:35:07] the original
[1:35:08] it had a word that was down that center
[1:35:12] stem now you remember
[1:35:13] the all seven of them drew out of one
[1:35:17] bowl of oil it was the same oil that was
[1:35:21] feeding paul's day
[1:35:23] that is feeding our day to day that's
[1:35:26] the reason why that we're entitled to
[1:35:28] have an ax2 meeting
[1:35:30] right here this morning amen
[1:35:37] i was in a service one time down in old
[1:35:39] mexico
[1:35:41] and i i said something my interpreter
[1:35:44] didn't know how to
[1:35:45] uh how to translate it so i reworded it
[1:35:48] and
[1:35:48] i don't even speak good english
[1:35:52] no wonder i'm hard to interpret into
[1:35:54] spanish
[1:35:57] and so brother sandy beach was there
[1:35:59] next to me and i i reworded it
[1:36:02] and he just stood there he still didn't
[1:36:04] know how to say what i was saying in my
[1:36:06] old hillbilly english
[1:36:10] so i turned around and i said something
[1:36:12] else and his son baruch was
[1:36:14] sitting down here about where you're at
[1:36:15] sister and he just kindly bugged his
[1:36:18] eyes out like that
[1:36:19] and then just a few minutes later we
[1:36:22] were
[1:36:23] had an open pavilion uh uh open sides
[1:36:26] around it just a ten roof
[1:36:28] and and there was too many people there
[1:36:30] to to get them all
[1:36:31] under and there was some that was
[1:36:33] outside like back behind where you three
[1:36:35] brothers are back there
[1:36:37] and i would say something before brother
[1:36:40] sandy could even interpret
[1:36:43] their their rejoicing throwing their
[1:36:44] hands up and i thought well
[1:36:46] they're just getting caught up in the
[1:36:47] spirit of the thing
[1:36:50] but after service baruch comes up and he
[1:36:54] said brother force that is so neat
[1:36:56] now the only spanish i know is what you
[1:36:58] can find on a mexican food menu
[1:37:04] they taught me to say dyla bendiga and
[1:37:07] they kindly smile at me i know i'm not
[1:37:09] pronouncing it right
[1:37:10] but they know what i'm trying to say
[1:37:11] that's god bless you
[1:37:14] you know i i wanted to learn how to say
[1:37:17] thank you
[1:37:18] and god bless you
[1:37:22] i don't have a need for the rest of it
[1:37:26] but the brother said that when brother
[1:37:28] sandy didn't know how to interpret
[1:37:30] that i turned around to him and told
[1:37:34] him what to say in spanish in the same
[1:37:37] dialect that they used in that village
[1:37:42] and the brothers back there then for
[1:37:45] five minutes
[1:37:46] was hearing in spanish before
[1:37:50] brother sandy ever interpreted what i
[1:37:52] said
[1:37:53] that's what happened in the upper room
[1:37:56] in acts 2.
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:38:01] my son clifford was uh we got the
[1:38:04] witness into a pentecost
[1:38:06] uh a pastor there in our town
[1:38:09] and uh uh of course he was fussing at
[1:38:13] my son and he said clifford i ain't even
[1:38:16] sure that you've got the holy ghost i
[1:38:17] ain't never heard you speak in tongues
[1:38:21] clifford said my daddy's been in more
[1:38:23] than acts 2 meeting than you've ever
[1:38:25] been in
[1:38:29] amen they all heard it
[1:38:32] they was all turning around and saying
[1:38:34] to each other are all of these men
[1:38:36] galileans how is it that we're all here
[1:38:39] and
[1:38:39] whatever everyone i'm saying i thought
[1:38:41] you told me that guy couldn't speak any
[1:38:43] galilean
[1:38:46] but that's the way we heard it
[1:38:49] that's my god amen
[1:38:53] why is it that sometimes that we can be
[1:38:55] sitting in a service
[1:38:56] and the lord go to speaking to us
[1:38:59] directly
[1:39:00] and we get outside and you walk up to
[1:39:02] somebody and you say
[1:39:03] oh brother did you hear what brother
[1:39:05] juan said in there he said well
[1:39:07] what was he saying well he said such and
[1:39:09] such such and such
[1:39:10] and that's exactly what i just went
[1:39:12] through today
[1:39:13] and i really needed that
[1:39:16] you say i never heard him say that
[1:39:21] and so you go down
[1:39:25] you go tell brother jordan i want a copy
[1:39:27] of the tape
[1:39:29] if brother once said that i must have
[1:39:31] fell asleep or something
[1:39:33] and you go back and you listen to it and
[1:39:35] you come out you say brother brother
[1:39:37] juan didn't say that
[1:39:39] oh yes he did he just preached on it
[1:39:41] yeah i heard that
[1:39:42] he just preached on that you go back
[1:39:45] and okay here's this there's this but he
[1:39:48] don't say that
[1:39:53] but we hear it in our own language
[1:39:55] sometimes what the spirit is saying
[1:39:58] it never was said vocalized but the
[1:40:00] spirit of god the ministry of jesus
[1:40:03] christ
[1:40:04] drops down something that was just meant
[1:40:06] for you what meant for everybody
[1:40:08] but you heard it oh the glory of
[1:40:12] god
[1:40:17] amen if a
[1:40:20] corn of wheat abides alone
[1:40:30] again you pardon me for calling a couple
[1:40:33] of names
[1:40:35] but you hear him on the news all the
[1:40:36] time
[1:40:41] if bill and melinda gates
[1:40:45] the biggest charitable foundation in the
[1:40:49] world
[1:40:51] if they never die out to self
[1:40:57] all they will ever amount to
[1:41:02] is bill and melinda gates
[1:41:11] when brother branham was preaching the
[1:41:13] seven church ages in 1954
[1:41:15] he said a grain of corn if it abides
[1:41:19] it abides alone it'll
[1:41:22] never mean no more
[1:41:26] than one grain
[1:41:30] of corn
[1:41:34] it'll never amount to one more
[1:41:40] than one grain of corn
[1:41:46] you and i if we do not
[1:41:49] totally die out to self
[1:41:52] that christ can reign through us
[1:41:56] and take us and use us i will
[1:42:00] never amount to one more
[1:42:03] thing than just the son of glenn and
[1:42:06] gwendolyn
[1:42:07] farmer that's all i'll ever be
[1:42:13] one day there'll be a chunk of granite
[1:42:17] with my name carved in it
[1:42:20] and that's it
[1:42:25] but when we can die out
[1:42:29] that christ can live through us
[1:42:32] that the book of acts is a continuation
[1:42:35] because you and i are living it out
[1:42:43] though we may come to church we may pay
[1:42:46] tithes
[1:42:47] we may put into the offering
[1:42:50] i want you to know it was a blessing to
[1:42:52] me yesterday to come in and see
[1:42:55] just the brothers all coming together
[1:42:57] you'd have thought we was fixing to have
[1:42:59] church here yesterday afternoon would
[1:43:01] you
[1:43:04] man everybody come up shaking hands
[1:43:07] i'm glad the colvin police wasn't around
[1:43:10] they'd said
[1:43:11] y'all ain't got mask on you ain't
[1:43:13] sanitizing your hands
[1:43:15] but we were shaking one another's hand
[1:43:18] and everybody coming in put an arm
[1:43:21] around
[1:43:21] the other one y'all ain't immediate
[1:43:25] family oh yes we are same daddy
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:30] hey man
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:33] amen we we all got the same name
[1:43:38] this is jesus christ
[1:43:42] hallelujah
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:49] we can donate our our time to the church
[1:43:53] but if you don't die out to self
[1:43:56] it'll never amount to nothing but just
[1:43:59] one person
[1:44:02] oh but you take somebody
[1:44:06] that will find an altar i don't care if
[1:44:08] it's in the front of the church
[1:44:11] or if it's in your chair or if it's in
[1:44:14] the woods
[1:44:16] or if it's in the woodshed
[1:44:20] the prophet of god said that he didn't
[1:44:22] even know how to pray
[1:44:24] when he tried to give his heart to the
[1:44:25] lord
[1:44:28] so you know what he did he got a pen and
[1:44:33] and wrote down a b c d e f g h
[1:44:36] i j k l m n o p q r
[1:44:40] s t u v w x
[1:44:43] y z and he said i know the lord how it
[1:44:47] knows how to put it together so you'll
[1:44:49] know what i'm saying
[1:44:57] and he died out
[1:45:02] he died out
[1:45:09] you know in my flesh
[1:45:14] the older that i get the more of glenn
[1:45:17] farmer
[1:45:17] i see in this flesh
[1:45:21] you know what i'm saying
[1:45:24] sometimes i have to watch what i eat
[1:45:27] because my daddy had to watch what he
[1:45:29] ate
[1:45:32] are you hearing me
[1:45:37] i still love to hunting fish
[1:45:42] don't y'all get mad at me i still love
[1:45:44] guns
[1:45:48] my daddy loved guns my daddy loved to
[1:45:51] hunting fish
[1:45:54] are you hearing me but this flesh is
[1:45:57] unconvertible
[1:45:59] but there's something down on the inside
[1:46:01] that it pulls this flesh
[1:46:03] into subjection to the word of god
[1:46:07] because it got changed and it's no
[1:46:10] longer the life
[1:46:12] of glenn and gwendolyn farmer but it's
[1:46:14] the life
[1:46:15] of the lord jesus christ
[1:46:21] brother branham said his mama was half
[1:46:25] cherokee indian
[1:46:27] and he said i still love the outdoors he
[1:46:30] said there's something that even my
[1:46:32] conversion
[1:46:33] didn't take away from me you may have
[1:46:35] something because we're part of
[1:46:38] god's flower garden of variety
[1:46:41] some of us are marigolds some of some of
[1:46:44] y'all
[1:46:44] some of us is dandelions
[1:46:50] but sometimes people don't even want us
[1:46:52] around
[1:46:54] but you know what in the spring of the
[1:46:56] year they sure are pretty yellow out
[1:46:58] there when nothing else is blooming yet
[1:47:02] amen and then you got some that they are
[1:47:05] just
[1:47:06] genuine roses
[1:47:10] i've got a rose bush there i i i enjoy
[1:47:14] messing with them things a little bit i
[1:47:16] i hope you don't think i'm too awful
[1:47:18] sissified just because i
[1:47:19] uh love flowers but i i do know this
[1:47:22] there's a quote and i'll find it for you
[1:47:25] if you want me to
[1:47:26] where the prophet of god said that we
[1:47:28] could learn more about
[1:47:29] god looking at a bouquet of flowers
[1:47:33] for one minute than what you could learn
[1:47:34] in a seminary for years
[1:47:39] amen i've got a rose
[1:47:43] at home that's called a mr lincoln i i
[1:47:45] don't go out and buy my wife a lot of
[1:47:47] flowers
[1:47:48] i grow
[1:47:53] yeah i i'll go out when when the
[1:47:57] crocus are blooming when the iris says i
[1:48:00] i i'll keep her base full right there
[1:48:03] over the sink you know where
[1:48:06] i've got one that's called a mr lincoln
[1:48:09] it's a dark red rose
[1:48:12] and it is the most fragrant rose i think
[1:48:16] in the world
[1:48:18] you cut that rascal off i can take it
[1:48:21] in the house and sherry can be back in
[1:48:24] the bedroom
[1:48:25] she'll say you brought in mr lincoln
[1:48:27] didn't
[1:48:30] i'm talking about in five you know what
[1:48:32] i'm saying
[1:48:34] and i believe that god's got some people
[1:48:36] but you can't even get in the same room
[1:48:39] with them
[1:48:39] until you know that you've been in the
[1:48:42] presence of a son or a daughter of god
[1:48:46] amen oh lord let us
[1:48:49] magnify the creator that has made us
[1:48:54] amen we can do
[1:48:57] all these things for the church
[1:49:01] we can support it we can take brother
[1:49:03] one out to eat
[1:49:05] every sunday but if we don't die
[1:49:08] out all you'll
[1:49:12] ever be is a meal ticket for brother one
[1:49:17] and the guy that's always there to work
[1:49:20] on the church
[1:49:23] well i thank god for
[1:49:28] but the kingdom of god is more desiring
[1:49:32] than just somebody that works and
[1:49:36] somebody that pays their tithes and
[1:49:38] somebody that gives in the offering
[1:49:41] somebody that's willing to play the
[1:49:42] music
[1:49:46] it's life
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:50] every every
[1:49:54] vision every
[1:49:57] dream every
[1:50:01] nudge
[1:50:05] have you ever had one of those times
[1:50:07] that you really felt like that you
[1:50:09] you ought to do something and and
[1:50:12] you know isn't it amazing how busy that
[1:50:15] we get sometimes
[1:50:17] we get so busy that we can't even let
[1:50:21] the lord have his way
[1:50:22] in our life the way.
[1:50:26] do you all know what i'm talking about
[1:50:28] i'm a married man
[1:50:31] are you hearing me i'm a married man you
[1:50:34] say brother farmer you ain't got a ring
[1:50:36] that's cause i lost it this week
[1:50:39] i lost some weight and i'd i'd drive
[1:50:43] down the road and i'd play with that
[1:50:45] ring
[1:50:45] i knew it was loose
[1:50:48] and i thought you know what i've got a
[1:50:50] smaller ring at home that i used to wear
[1:50:53] when i was a younger man
[1:50:55] you know ain't that crazy you're small
[1:50:57] then you get bigger and then when you
[1:50:59] get older you start getting smaller
[1:51:00] again
[1:51:04] i don't understand i don't understand
[1:51:06] how a how black and white cow can eat
[1:51:08] green grass and
[1:51:11] give white milk either but yeah that's
[1:51:14] just the way lord does things
[1:51:18] and that ring went to get a and and i
[1:51:20] thought
[1:51:21] you know what i really need to pull that
[1:51:22] off and put it in the ashtray
[1:51:24] and and and go back and and get that
[1:51:28] other ring trade out for but but i don't
[1:51:31] want to take off my wedding ring
[1:51:34] now i can't find it
[1:51:38] but i was already nudged to do
[1:51:43] you know i've got to worry that
[1:51:45] sometimes when the lord just lays
[1:51:46] something on your heart
[1:51:49] and and you you just drop what you're
[1:51:51] doing and go do it
[1:51:55] i call them gold star days you know hang
[1:51:58] that one on the calendar
[1:52:01] man lick that baby and stick it to it
[1:52:04] i need a reminder of this one and you
[1:52:08] know it happens to us all the time
[1:52:12] each and every one of us
[1:52:15] god gives every one of us
[1:52:19] a gift in our life
[1:52:22] they let me play guitar at home just so
[1:52:24] i won't sing
[1:52:33] i can even write a song and somebody
[1:52:35] else will offer to sing it
[1:52:40] okay but no matter what it is
[1:52:43] god has given you something.
[1:52:51] god has given you something and when god
[1:52:54] gives it to you for the body that is as
[1:52:58] much a part of the ministry of
[1:53:01] jesus christ amen as the prophet of god
[1:53:05] was amen
[1:53:09] you may not touch as many but
[1:53:12] gods give you something i sat and told
[1:53:16] the brothers here
[1:53:17] just the other night i've seen the lord
[1:53:19] do more
[1:53:20] in my life around a dinner table than
[1:53:23] what i've seen in big meetings
[1:53:27] amen
[1:53:31] there's a brother out in murphy idaho
[1:53:35] this morning
[1:53:37] that i was in a meeting up in genoa
[1:53:40] illinois three years ago
[1:53:45] and uh i was sitting talking to a couple
[1:53:48] brothers
[1:53:49] and my attention got pulled to brother
[1:53:51] carlos back over here somebody just
[1:53:53] called brother
[1:53:54] carlos name here to to me yesterday or
[1:53:56] the day before the
[1:53:58] this is the one that he had a great
[1:54:00] testimony brother scott where you at
[1:54:04] was that you yes
[1:54:08] here you go he was going through
[1:54:12] a time of depression
[1:54:15] and i was sitting there talking to some
[1:54:17] people and my attention got pulled back
[1:54:20] over my shoulder
[1:54:21] and i turned around and i i said brother
[1:54:23] come here
[1:54:24] and and he didn't hear me or he didn't
[1:54:26] think i was talking to him
[1:54:28] i said brother come here so somebody
[1:54:30] grabs him
[1:54:31] and says hey bro brother farmer's
[1:54:33] hollering at you and so
[1:54:35] he says you want me i i said yesterday i
[1:54:39] i said come over here i said i just felt
[1:54:42] led to
[1:54:42] to say this and and i thought maybe
[1:54:45] you'd like to hear it
[1:54:47] and i went through how the lord had
[1:54:49] delivered somebody
[1:54:50] everybody else got up in a few minutes
[1:54:52] and left the table brother carla stayed
[1:54:54] there
[1:54:56] he said why did you call me over here
[1:55:00] i said because i felt led to
[1:55:09] he said i've been fighting a suicidal
[1:55:11] spirit for over a year
[1:55:15] i said brother do you believe that god
[1:55:18] delivered you of it
[1:55:21] he said yes i do i said the prophet of
[1:55:23] god said if something comes to you
[1:55:24] strangely or mysteriously
[1:55:26] check it out by the word and consult
[1:55:28] your pastor i said he's right over there
[1:55:31] why don't you go talk to him and bear
[1:55:33] witness of it the man stood up the next
[1:55:35] morning
[1:55:36] and was given testimony that the lord
[1:55:38] jesus had delivered him
[1:55:41] it wasn't because of something that i
[1:55:43] preached in that meeting
[1:55:44] i wasn't even one of the preachers i was
[1:55:46] just there to support the meeting
[1:55:50] but my attention was called back to
[1:55:52] brother carlos because brother carlos
[1:55:54] had a need
[1:55:55] and the lord jesus finally got forced in
[1:55:58] condition
[1:55:58] that he was listening to jesus and even
[1:56:01] after hollered at him two or three times
[1:56:05] oh god help us to be persistent in the
[1:56:09] ministry of jesus christ
[1:56:11] we don't give up just the first time
[1:56:13] that something comes about
[1:56:15] if we did we would not be gathered here
[1:56:17] this morning
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:21] the contractors may have dropped the
[1:56:23] ball
[1:56:24] the brother stepped in and picked up the
[1:56:26] ball and run with it
[1:56:28] the prophet of god said it like this if
[1:56:30] johnny won't bring in the wood you bring
[1:56:32] in the wood
[1:56:34] brother jordan he come in
[1:56:38] you'd have thought that he was ramrod in
[1:56:40] a big construction job
[1:56:43] all the brothers go up to him what can i
[1:56:45] do what do you need me to do
[1:56:50] we do our i i believe the the scripture
[1:56:53] says it according to our several
[1:56:55] abilities don't ask me where it is but
[1:56:58] i i believe that's the way that it's
[1:56:59] worth it
[1:57:01] so everybody was just doing whatever
[1:57:04] they could
[1:57:07] you may think what i'm saying is a
[1:57:10] little bit strange
[1:57:12] you know there's a few quotes there's a
[1:57:14] few things that that brother branham
[1:57:16] said that
[1:57:17] that is so unusual that it's just been
[1:57:20] striking to me all my life
[1:57:23] it'd be okay if i share one of them with
[1:57:25] you
[1:57:31] one time there was a brother was talking
[1:57:33] to brother branham
[1:57:34] that he wanted him to come by his house
[1:57:36] i believe he lived up at sellersburg
[1:57:38] indiana
[1:57:39] and brother branham said uh do you live
[1:57:41] in a white clobbered house got a picket
[1:57:44] fence around it
[1:57:48] and he said yeah he said brother brandon
[1:57:51] have you ever been there you said yeah i
[1:57:53] was there just a few minutes ago he said
[1:57:55] i didn't see you said i was there in a
[1:57:56] vision
[1:58:01] there was another one
[1:58:04] that brother branham in a prayer line
[1:58:06] called out a man
[1:58:08] and he said in your bedroom he said
[1:58:10] you've got baseboards that's made
[1:58:12] out of tongue and groove flooring
[1:58:18] now you almost have to be a carpenter to
[1:58:20] to know what i'm talking about there
[1:58:22] but what it is it's flooring that that
[1:58:25] has a lip on it and then a groove on the
[1:58:27] other side where it snaps kindly
[1:58:29] together like that
[1:58:32] and the prophet of god told him it was
[1:58:33] painted red and told him what kind of
[1:58:35] wood that it was painted
[1:58:37] with are you hearing me yes
[1:58:41] but now there's another story that
[1:58:43] brother branham tells
[1:58:45] and that was that there was a lady that
[1:58:47] was sitting down in the church
[1:58:49] a a hat or a seat there and she seen a
[1:58:52] a a mama with a sick baby
[1:58:56] that was bringing them in and she had a
[1:58:58] prayer card in her hand
[1:59:00] and the compassion of that mother
[1:59:03] sitting back there
[1:59:04] uh looked at this mama holding a baby
[1:59:08] and she said
[1:59:08] sister said here why don't you sit here
[1:59:11] in my
[1:59:12] seat and i'll go find another one and
[1:59:15] she said well you don't have to do it
[1:59:16] and she said no i i just want to do that
[1:59:19] for you
[1:59:20] and she said well thank you thank you so
[1:59:22] much
[1:59:23] and she said what he heard said i see
[1:59:26] you've got a prayer card
[1:59:28] but would it be okay if i prayed
[1:59:31] for your baby and she said well
[1:59:34] certainly honey that
[1:59:35] that would be wonderful
[1:59:39] and the little mama just reaches over
[1:59:42] and prays i
[1:59:44] we don't even have any word that she was
[1:59:46] carrying a bottle of oil in her purse to
[1:59:49] anoint that baby
[1:59:53] we don't
[1:59:57] but she prayed for the baby
[2:00:02] and she goes and gets a seat she can't
[2:00:05] even get one on the main floor
[2:00:07] now she has to go way up in the balcony
[2:00:11] but that night in the prayer line
[2:00:16] the man of god was discerning
[2:00:20] the case of the prayer card
[2:00:23] that that mama had and she said
[2:00:28] he said there's a woman sitting way up
[2:00:30] in the balcony
[2:00:32] that she gave you her seat
[2:00:35] and asked if she could pray for your
[2:00:37] baby and she prayed the prayer of faith
[2:00:40] for it
[2:00:40] your baby's already healed go your way
[2:00:43] giving god the glory
[2:00:44] that lady up in the balcony was as much
[2:00:48] a part of the ministry
[2:00:49] of jesus christ as the prophet was
[2:00:52] telling them that that's where the
[2:00:54] healing took place
[2:00:57] amen amen amen
[2:01:03] we exercise faith
[2:01:06] amen faith was accounted to
[2:01:10] abraham for righteousness
[2:01:16] the lord just leads one of us to do
[2:01:19] something
[2:01:21] and you do it and you see
[2:01:24] what's taking place
[2:01:33] brother juan will tell you i really
[2:01:35] don't eat that
[2:01:36] much
[2:01:43] in the motel this morning
[2:01:47] i went down and got a cup of coffee
[2:01:50] and they had a little old bag there had
[2:01:52] a a
[2:01:53] apple in it and a a granola bar

[2:02:17] take something
[2:02:18] to the truck and i thought well i'll

[2:05:20] oh all you black brothers and sisters in
[2:05:23] here you got one over on me right now
[2:05:28] because there's another little story
[2:05:30] about a prophet one time
[2:05:32] that was flying on an airplane and it
[2:05:34] took a storm to ground that plane
[2:05:37] in memphis tennessee but he had a letter
[2:05:41] that he needed to send out so he had
[2:05:43] plenty of time
[2:05:44] to go down to the post office so he
[2:05:48] heads down that way and as he's headed
[2:05:50] back for the plane
[2:05:52] something says go this way
[2:05:58] so he goes that way
[2:06:01] and he's thinking boy it's about time
[2:06:03] for that plane to take off
[2:06:07] but he said keep walking
[2:06:12] so he goes on walking and he gets on
[2:06:15] down
[2:06:17] he said in one place he said lord
[2:06:20] i i asked the lord why would you bring
[2:06:23] me down to this district down here by
[2:06:26] the
[2:06:26] the river just keep walking
[2:06:31] pretty soon there's mama out there
[2:06:34] leaning over the fence
[2:06:40] morning parson
[2:06:46] how did you know i was a parson
[2:06:52] parson you ever heard about that
[2:06:53] shooting that woman he probably preached
[2:06:55] on her a dozen times
[2:06:58] he said yes ma'am she said well i was a
[2:07:01] woman like that woman
[2:07:06] the lord gave me a son i tried to raise
[2:07:08] him right but he got out in the world
[2:07:13] picked up a disease
[2:07:16] said i got to pray and lord works my
[2:07:19] lives and elijah of this day
[2:07:22] had to come to meet that woman it may
[2:07:25] have taken a
[2:07:26] storm like what we had in town here the
[2:07:28] other night
[2:07:29] to ground that plane but god can create
[2:07:32] the storm
[2:07:33] to cause a plane to land in a place that
[2:07:36] it ain't scheduled to land
[2:07:38] you start a ruckus on a plane where they
[2:07:41] have to land it in a place other than
[2:07:42] where it's designated for
[2:07:44] they'll throw you in jail but they ain't
[2:07:46] gonna throw god in jail
[2:07:48] he created the storm he's the one that
[2:07:51] grounded the place
[2:07:54] branham said i laid my hand on that oh
[2:07:57] ain't jemima's back
[2:07:59] and said it was wet with a dew where
[2:08:01] she'd
[2:08:02] been out there in the wee hours of the
[2:08:06] morning
[2:08:09] how did she have that dream
[2:08:13] there's another place not right there
[2:08:16] but there's another place that brother
[2:08:18] branham tells that story
[2:08:20] and she said where's that briefcase
[2:08:22] you're supposed to be carrying
[2:08:26] brother brown said it's back in the room
[2:08:33] the ministry of jesus christ
[2:08:36] working through a mama
[2:08:39] hanging over a fence amen
[2:08:43] your mamas wonder why it is that
[2:08:45] sometimes
[2:08:46] that you have to pray and pray and pray
[2:08:49] and the baby's sick or your husband's
[2:08:51] sick
[2:08:52] and then all of a sudden something just
[2:08:54] comes over you
[2:08:56] that you drop down on them knees and you
[2:08:59] know that the windows of heaven was open
[2:09:02] and you know that your voice got heard
[2:09:06] and you say satan you're a liar
[2:09:09] you can't make my baby stay sick
[2:09:12] i claim it's healing in the name of
[2:09:15] jesus christ
[2:09:16] and you walk in and the fever's broke
[2:09:18] like that
[2:09:20] it's the ministry of jesus christ
[2:09:26] amen amen you and i
[2:09:31] are the fruits of the ministry
[2:09:36] of jesus christ
[2:09:39] amen amen how many children have we got
[2:09:43] in here 12 13 years old

[2:09:58] lord can speak to you son
[2:10:03] are you hearing me you dedicate your
[2:10:06] life to the lord the lord speak through
[2:10:07] you
[2:10:09] one time there's a little boy that he
[2:10:11] wasn't even but three years old
[2:10:14] and the ministry of jesus christ worked
[2:10:17] through that boy
[2:10:18] and woke him up he he had been dedicated
[2:10:21] he was taken down into eli's house
[2:10:23] his mama when when mama couldn't have a
[2:10:26] little boy that she wanted to have
[2:10:28] she said lord if you'll just let me have
[2:10:30] a little boy i i'll dedicate him to you
[2:10:38] and when the spirit of the lord was
[2:10:40] really calling out he
[2:10:45] he goes run into eli and said did you
[2:10:48] call for me said
[2:10:49] no son i ain't called for you you're
[2:10:51] going back to spit
[2:10:53] a little bit later eli heard his name
[2:10:56] called again he went in and asked eli

[2:11:02] did you cough for me
[2:11:04] no son i ain't called for you
[2:11:08] and the third time that backslid
[2:11:11] preacher realized that god was doing
[2:11:13] something

[2:11:20] the lord jesus at 12 or 13 when he was

[2:41:11] message
[2:41:12] you know
[2:41:16] i've said this before to disassembly
[2:41:22] brother branham i was just listening to
[2:41:25] that
[2:41:27] in the dreams and the visions that led
[2:41:29] to the seals
[2:41:31] but brandon was talking about the vision
[2:41:33] he had
[2:41:34] going to brother angie bright where the
[2:41:37] lord told him
[2:41:39] he says stole the food that's how you
[2:41:42] would keep the people
[2:41:45] and i would tell you that this this
[2:41:47] revival this message
[2:41:49] has has been kept because
[2:41:53] of that obedience to what the angel told
[2:41:56] him
[2:41:57] if we never had these messages on tapes
[2:42:02] we would have been worse than any group
[2:42:07] we have it on tapes and yet we have all
[2:42:09] the problems
[2:42:12] we have different doctrines polygamy and
[2:42:15] different things that have come
[2:42:16] out of this message if we never had it
[2:42:18] on tape
[2:42:23] we would have never even knew what a
[2:42:25] true revival
[2:42:26] is and those
[2:42:30] messages on tapes
[2:42:34] i believe one of the reasons
[2:42:38] that god told his prophet is to be
[2:42:41] able to sustain an atmosphere because
[2:42:44] it's the atmosphere that brings the
[2:42:46] result
[2:42:49] if we cannot get the atmosphere we can
[2:42:51] never get the result of the book of arts
[2:42:56] the tapes are not to bring brother
[2:42:59] brandon black from the grave i look to
[2:43:00] see him
[2:43:01] in the rapture the tapes are to sustain
[2:43:05] the atmosphere
[2:43:06] that we keep this bride to the coming of
[2:43:09] the lord
[2:43:10] and that's why we play the tips for the
[2:43:12] tip does not heal you
[2:43:14] the tip builds your faith for you to
[2:43:17] receive your healing
[2:43:20] because when you hear what god has done
[2:43:23] and you hear uh uh the man of god
[2:43:26] calling by discernment it based your
[2:43:29] faith
[2:43:30] for you to believe that if god did it
[2:43:32] then he can do it now
[2:43:35] that's why it does
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:42] praise the lord and and that that's why
[2:43:44] we encourage ourselves
[2:43:47] you know sometimes you play tapes like
[2:43:49] even we play tapes for our sunday school
[2:43:52] some people don't listen they just feel
[2:43:54] like well
[2:43:55] i can listen to the tip anytime i want
[2:43:56] to listen to it
[2:44:02] when you despise that it's hard for you
[2:44:05] to catch up
[2:44:06] with the atmosphere of what the holy
[2:44:08] spirit is doing in your local assembly
[2:44:21] praise the lord so the lord bless you
