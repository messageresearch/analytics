the Lord thank you musicians and uh praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen let's take our Bibles and we just want to uh re-echo some few things to you uh Sunday we never had a time to uh share some of our notes with you so uh uh we just got caught under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and and we want to thank the Lord for for blessing the service praise the Lord so tonight uh by the grace of God um we want to read uh Revelation chapter 4 we want to look into Revelation chapter 4 Revelation chapter 4 let's read from verse 6 Revelation chapter 4 let's read from verse 6 and Before the Throne there was a seed of glass like unto chrst and in the midst of the throne and around about The Throne where four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a cough that we call an ox and the T Beast had the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and the four Beast had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and and and they rested that day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is which is to come praise the Lord amen which was which is which is to come we see there there SE expression in the early part of uh The Book of Revelation but let's go ahead and when those beasts had given glory and honor and and thanks to him that sat on the throne who who liveth forever and ever the four and 20 others fell down before him that sat on the throne and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever and cast their Throne before him before and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying thou are worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou have created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created amen let's pray together father we just want to thank you tonight and Lord we just want to recap on few things oh god father and we pray that Lord you will come and help us tonight we just placing ourself before you now father and asking that you would bless us in a special way tonight in Jesus name amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat this evening I was a bit CAU between two thoughts two line of thoughts for the service tonight and uh uh if you remember back we spoke on uh uh the cup Bearer we spoke on the cup Bearer and so I was caught in a thought to to to speak on uh Contin Contin to speak on the cup Bearer because as we ended that service if you will remember uh uh we spoke of another cup Revelation chapter 17 there was a there was a woman that had a cup in her hand and that cup was filled with the blood of the Saints that's another cup thereof A system that is bearing a cup there has uh uh there has had the whole world the Bible says all the kings of the earth is drunk with uh with that wine that she has given so I wanted to go into that uh uh today but last night as I was uh I was I was studying actually uh uh yesterday and uh something caught my attention and it has to do with a little bit of uh uh history that uh you know and and as I was looking into it and I thought okay this uh this is going to is going to take us more than the time we want to spend on the Wednesday night and uh uh uh really need to give you a background for you to be able to grab there but let me just tetir your conscious on on on what what the thought is what is happening yet is there uh uh like we said Jesus one of his last word to the church was take this cup this is my blood drink it and uh uh uh uh my blood of the New Testament he says this bread eat it and this is my body now uh uh we will realize that uh uh as much as that was symbolic to the church we know that uh uh it will be very very important for us to understand that with the prophecy over in Revelation chapter 17 that runs over to Revelation chapter 18 mystery Babylon uh we will see that the Bible says all the kings of the Earth was drunk with the wine of her forication so I was actually going to bring it in the way for us to be able to realize that if you are not drinking from the Lost cup you are drinking from the cup of mysteries Babylon because it's a cup that the Bible says all the kings all the leaders all the president every country praise the Lord is drunk with the wine and I don't need to tell you if you look at what is happening out there in the word you will know only drunk men can behave like that praise the Lord amen you see what is happening in politics it's only drunk men that can behave like that man with all their I mean all their study all their uh uh learning you know uh uh uh uh and and and yet uh uh the economy of the word keep going back that uh you know uh uh with all the invention that they making we having more sicknesses that is breaking out the doctors can't find their their you know uh uh uh the name for it or what what is the cause of it and uh so we are living in a drunken word we are living in a drunken word and and when we get into and start to look into the scripture you will realize that uh uh uh spiritual drunkenness is more dangerous praise the Lord the man that is that is uh that is an alcoholic can be delivered we know Rosetta was delivered in the meetings of brother Brandon you know the man that is suffering from some kind of alcoholic Spirit can be delivered by God's grace if uh if the Lord comes down he can deliver but this drunkenness that is that is happening in the word I mean is is so is so terrible and it's on a prophecy so uh that's what I thought we will We I was going to go into tonight but I thought that maybe we would do that another time so I just I just felt like okay this is a Wednesday night and uh we were going to take up uh the prayer request that we did and uh uh I even thought there were going to be more prayer requests so we can just uh make a little prayer meeting tonight but that's only one we had so I thought I would use this not and then just go back and recap on what I was trying to we were we were fellowshipping around on Sunday praise the Lord amen so we can just go back and fellowship a little bit on uh uh uh the word of the Lord praise the Lord amen sometimes you you get under the inspiration and then uh you just keep going you don't I mean pay attention what the people grapping on that you just hope that the holy spirit will be able to bring it to them praise the Lord but we were over in Revelation chapter 5 now I read in Revelation chapter 4 just so we can be able to uh uh go back and cap on the the the four beasts or the four living creatures uh uh four Beast four living creatures that's that's how the Bible called them now so uh and what I want wanted us to to be able to grab and pay attention to you is that uh the Bible says uh uh in verse six that the four beasts uh um where four Beast four of eyes before and behind praise the Lord amen they were full of eyes before and behind now if you follow the little drama that we Tred to dramatize just keep that picture in your mind if you follow that you will realize that uh uh uh before then it looks like they having two eyes here and two eyes behind them but no because they don't move in separate Direction praise the Lord amen so if the lion is here and the ox is here when they are all under the Lion's anointing they only look that way so you see here they are not having a discussion and say me I see it this way this is the way I see it no so they are having eyes before and eyes behind now the beautiful thing that is also about that is that uh there is no way you can bypass the Beast because they're going to see you amen there is no way that you can bypass because they having eyes so that this one facing this way is the eyes before this one is an eyes behind this one facing this way could be an eyes before and this one facing this way is going to be a eyes eyes behind so it's not it's not more in a place they all uh you know each Beast have four eyes no they are all under one eye you remember the Bible talks about the eye of God moving to and for through the Earth it's just one eye okay it just it just I'm I'm not just meaning just one eye like one eye like this no but just it just you know One Direction looking in One Direction let me let me say it that way so you'll be able to grab the picture here praise the Lord amen so that is what I want I want you I want us to to be able to pay attention to yet that the four beasts uh uh there were four of ice before and behind that is just how much God is in control of what he's doing praise the Lord that is how much God is watching over his people and God is watching over his word the Lord do not sleep he do not Slumber are we together amen yes I want us to I want us to pay attention to that that the Lord do not sleep and he do not Slumber now there was uh that was uh uh you know that was uh one part of it that was one part of faith if you get down to verse 8 you'll see another picture there also the Bible says uh and they were full of eyes within they were four of eyes before and behind and they were four of eyes within praise the Lord are we together now this in the Bible represent power it represent power that's where uh uh uh uh science takes the word horsepower when it says your vehicle have this horsepower or this machine has this horsepower is is is all coming from there this in the Bible yeah represent power and what I want us to pay attention to also is that the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols are we together it's a sybol The Book of Revelation from Revelation chapter 1 the Bible says the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ it will come in very handy I want you to remember that that book is is is the revelation of Jesus Christ and and and what also is important in there twoo that I want for us to pay attention to that was the only book that Jesus wrote John was just the Scribe he was doing the writing but he was instructed by our Lord Jesus Christ to write the things that he sees are we together amen now so uh revelation chapter 5 that we read from have a very unique position and that's what I want to I want to bring to you in in in a little way tonight if we don't get through it we we will we'll still have time so Revelation chapter 4 it shows us the full power the full anointing that God will use throughout the church ages the full anointing that God will use all through that God has been using all through ages to deal with his people let me bring it to you this way that you understand a little bit brother B preached a message influence and when he preached the message influence he read from Isaiah chapter 6 and then he he read that scripture where the Bible shows our coming to the temple breaking into vision and he's saying the angels with two Wings the fly and right your Revelation say they have six wings two Wings they fly two wings uh the they cover their feet and you know and and all of that now brother Brandon brought that message to us and he was talking about influence but what I want us to be able to to to grab the emphasis of the Holy Ghost brother random talks about one man influence upon another he used the example of word Isaiah was influenced by user but what I want us to pay attention to is that God took Isaiah in the temple to put him under a new influence praise the Lord if Isaiah will be a prophet to be able to bring the word of the Lord to the people he must get from under the influence of a man and get under the influence of the Angel are you seeing the picture he must get from under the influence of the church and get under the influence of the word praise the Lord he must get from under the influence of a man and get on God's influence so that that is that is that is what that is what the prophet of God was trying to bring to us that in this age God is putting the bride under Angelic influence praise the lord we are not influenced by by the World Council of churches we are not influenced by the national Affair neither by the politics our influence is coming from the Angels amen those seven angels that brought the that brought the the the the message of the opening of the seals that's where he was trying to get our attention to unveiling of God brother brandom said uh it is this place where uh uh uh you are saying things and not saying it and hoping that the people will grab it that's what the messenger was doing he was saying things hoping that we would be able to grab it are we together because you see the the the uh uh uh uh uh the message of the hour is a message of Revelation it's a message uh uh is God's secret to his people for the hour so you see God will allow the the prophets to be able to say some things that even the devil in all of his wisdom will not be able to grab it but the babies will be able to pick it up by Revelation amen so that's where I want for us to pay attention are we together Jesus at the beginning of the church at the beginning of the church when the disciples went out they healed the sick they came back they were rejoicing he says don't Rejoice because demons are subject to you he said rejoice in the opening of the seals Rejoice because your name is written on the book that's right praise the Lord he said because I see Satan falling like a lightning so just imagine a little Revelation that the that the that the disciples had had Satan falling how much more when the church come to full revelation of who she is she will be an invisible Army and the devil will be under her feet praise the Lord so you see the word the message just come to empower you the message come to show you who you are are we together Amen brother bam says Revelation chapter 5 is one of the sublime scripture in the Bible Revelation chapter 5 is a parenthesis it's a parenthesis it's between chapter 4 and chapter 6 and I will show you a little bit what is happening between chapter 4 and chapter 6 amen so in chapter 4 we have seen the power from the throne that is going to influence the church let's read chapter 6 praise the Lord are you ready for the word of God tonight you came under expectation praise the Lord are we together Revelation chap 6 verse1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were uh were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast say come and see one of the four beasts from Revelation chapter 4 amen are we together are we together sir are we together one of the four beasts from Revelation chapter 4 is talking to John praise the Lord are we together okay I'll use this my two friends come bring your bring your Bible it's a book of symbol so it's good to have people to play it out or else it's difficult to see come stand right here open your Bible just open your Bible praise the Lord amen we'll come back to Revelation chapter 5 but pay attention now re realize that it's in Revelation chapter 5 that the lamb took the book and lose the seals amen now so in Revelation chapter 6 Revelation chapter 5 the lamb open one of the seal and I heard it John said I heard it and it was a noise of thunder and one of the four Beast said come come and see praise the Lord are we together this is the Lamb that has opened the book are we together the book is open this is John this is the Beast right when the lamb open the book and loose a seal this Beast said to John come and see the Beast is showing John what is what the lamb has opened are we together okay just stay right there the Beast said come and see then John in verse two says and I saw so when the Beast show John say come and see come come come John come and see John is saying this is what I saw this is what was pointed to me are you seeing okay the lamb open the book and there is a beast here re remember now the Beast is a power the Beast is an anointing are we together now so this anointing is going to open John eyes to see what is in the book and when John look in the book he says this is what I saw praise the Lord let me open the book to the right place let me help the lamb to open the book to the right place praise the Lord are we together okay so the John is now saying verse two I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went forth to conquer amen he went forth conquering and to conquer now so the lamb opened the book The Beast which is the anointing is now opening John eyes to see what the lamb has open are we together now so John is now seeing a vision the Beast remember now it's a symbol it's just a symbol right the Beast is representing an anointing the anointing that open your eyes to see water baptism that is not father Son and the Holy Ghost is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not your intelligence is an anointing that open your eyes if God don't open your eyes you will not see it it's an anointing that open your eyes for you to see de Hallelujah are you seeing it so John is representing the church that's right he's representing the entire church he's directed by the anointing the anointing is giving him an instruction the anointing is opening his eyes Isaiah said is the anointing that breaks the Yoke are we together so the Beast the the anointing is saying John come and see I will show you I will open your eyes are we together praise the Lord amen what I want you to also understand is that in Revelation chapter 5 that is the parenthesis are we together John was told the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed are we together who is the lion of the Trap of Judah who is the lion of the Trap of Judah what's happening what's happening to message people your problem is that you are afraid to be wrong that's your problem I mean you must respond to the word and realize that you can never be wrong you can never be wrong are we together who is the lion of the Trap of Judah Jesus Jesus is the lion of the Trap of Judah who is the Lamb of God Jesus what's wrong with her praise the Lord the the hether said the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed praise the Lord and when John looked he saw a lamb the the Ed was not wrong the Ed never made a mistake the he was right because the hether was seeing the anointing that prevailed the anointing that prevailed was the Lion's anointing that's what the Ed was seeing praise the Lord you have to realize that John also was under the Lion's anointing because the lion anointing begin with the first church age are we together but when John turned around he saw a lamb it was it was our lord Jesus you see that's the reason why you got to keep symbols in your mind is our lord Jesus playing two roles one Ro as an overcomer and one Ro as a sacrifice are we together amen now so that is that is that's that's that's what that's what the Beast showed John when the first SE was open now realize now pay attention and that Beast that show John what was in the first seal the Bible said one of one of the beasts the Bible said I heard there was a noise and and said come and see it now so the Bible said one of the beast but if you pay attention as we go along you will realize that that Beast was the lion yes amen it was the The Lion anointing that showed John what was in the first seat and what the lion anointing was showing John is that pay attention now the Bible said verse two and I saw and behold a white horse now horse is also a beast just like Lion is a beast HSE is a beast so the the the lion anointing was showing John the anointing that will be fighting against him right the anointing that will be trying to conquer the church praise the Lord if if the Beast did not open John eyes John will think that is this brother that don't love me or this sister I don't love me oh is this person but as the anointing open John eyes John begins to see that there is a power that is trying to conquer the church a power that is trying to bring division among the people a PR a power that is trying to kill the people prayer life right a power that is trying to make the people backslide what was that H doing conquering it was conquering it was weakening the people are we together so the Beast is showing John pay attention here when the first seal open look the Beast is opening John eyes just like Elijah they to Gesa on the mountain when he open his eyes he saw the the the the the mountain filled with angels and then he could say there are more with us than them that are against us so if God do not open your eyes you will not even see what is happening in the service that's right it will just be a place you come through the door and you go out that's right are we together amen then we read again buy y bear with me okay you help to preach verse three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast what was the second beast according to Revelation chapter 4 why was the second beast talk if you know it the O A Cal that was the second beast so when when he when when when he open when the lamb open the second seal remember now the lamb is Christ when he open the second seal the anointing is also the anointing of Christ amen so and it's the anointing that is is opening so what I'm trying to show you here is that it's the lamb that is opening the seal the lamb is the anointing and is the Lamb that is opening John eyes so it's the lamb that is doing everything it's the lamb that is convicting people it's the lamb that is changing lives is the Lamb that is healing sick is the Lamb that is it's the lamb that is doing everything if you don't see the lamb you will think you are the one doing it that's why when John looked to see a lion he saw the lamb we must see the lamb all the time and when you see the bleeding lamb it will humble you all the time are we together so the lamb has brought another anointing to show John something different praise the Lord amen the lamb has introduced the church to another an anointing because the first anointing which was the lion anointing led the first three Church ages praise the Lord amen that's where great missionary work the disciples were Brave to go to any part of the world why because they were under the anointing but when catholism to started strangling the church when catholism started you know trying to organize the church praise the Lord amen God had to bring another anointing to bypass the Beast system praise the Lord because as Catholic as catholism was attacking the church the church was under persecution if God did not give the people an O anointing they would be afraid right take for example when Jesus was arrested all those disciple deny him those very same men that were celebrating demons are subject to us the night that Jesus was arrested every one of them the Bible say every one of them Peter deny him there was one the Bible says in the gate the ask another one he said no I don't know them every one of them deny him every one of them so you see God had to give the church an anointing for the season that's right that they were in and that is the same thing that he do to us he gave us an anointing for the season that we are in praise the Lord that's the reason why there is nothing that come against the church that we came be right so as the church was organizing and the Roman system was attacking the church God now the lamb had to come in the form of an ox the the lamb has to anoint the church with an ox anointing are we together so the second beast the Bible says said to John come and see it so the second beast now is now going to expose by Revelation which is Vision to join the Antichrist power so you have to see it's two powers Christ power is in four beasts the lion the ox the man The Eagle right amen that's Christ power for the church that's the power that Christ locked the church in eyes within Eyes Without Eyes before eyes behind are we together but now the power of Christ the anointing of Christ must also expose the Antichrist anointing so the Holy Ghost now is calling John come and see it you come and see it when the second seals were open come let me show you how the devil will hide himself among the people the first time he came he came like a like a warrior he had a board but he did not have no Arrow a deceiver you cannot go to war with b and you don't have an arrow to strike but you see All Through the Ages the people has believed that that that beast on on a white it was on the white hearse you know ring and conquering they call it the Holy Ghost All Through the Ages they believe that that was the Holy Ghost but when the seals were open brother Brandon said no it's an antichrist because he had a bow he never had no Arrow are we together are you seeing the picture now so when the second seal was open praise the Lord the second beast said come and see come John come and see it and there went out another house that was red the first one was white the second one is red is also a power praise the Lord amen the first one was white innocent it was an innocent power that creep among the church innocent spirit the Deeds of the nian or all we trying to do we just trying to put people in their place you know uh I mean y y sure you know the the pastor must have this seat you know uh uh this this is for the clergy this is for the in just innocent innocent uh infiltrating of the enemy that separated the people make the leot a lower class and the clergy a higher class it was white now when the second beast came this this one now it has a color it's red and see what the Bible says and power was given giv to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth so it was it was it was a spirit it was an anointing if it's taking peace what is it bringing if it taking peace what is it bringing War if it's taking peace what is it bringing if he taking peace what is it bringing War Christ is the Prince of Peace so he will not take Peace So this cannot be a spirit of God that will be taking peace off the Earth and if it's bringing War definitely is identifying a time of Bloodshed where the Christians will be killed are we together are you getting the picture he took peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword it's a swore of death are we together I just want to to to be able to just grab something and then and then have uh these boys to sit down now verse five and when he had open the te seal I heard the te beast and what was the te Beast Revelation chapter 4 what was the T be man praise the Lord man was the te Beast the anointing of a man wisdom intellect okay and uh so the T Beast said to John come and SE and then when John look I beheld and L a black horse it's getting darker it was first White it went red and now it's black so you see the enemy power is increasing the Demon's power is increasing is intense in it first came in innocently that's how the enemy will always come it's just an innocent joke it's just an innocent game it's just an innocent saying that's how he will enter then now he start taking form when he start taking form then it start getting serious what was an innocent joke start becoming serious what was an innocent game start becoming serious that's a reason why there's no innocent lie right because brother brand says every lie is an entrance of a devil there is no innocent lie there is no joking line are we together it went from white red black you see God God the lamb so care for his church church not to leave us blindly just go to church and come home just go to church and come home he so care for the church that he's calling the church to come and see it giving the church ministry that will open their eyes giving the church word that will expose them to the time that they are living in and the things that is happening around them that's the reason why you have yourself to blame you have yourself to blame if you allow the enemy to torment you you allow the enemy to you know rule You by some kind of a habit you have yourself to blame because God has given us enough word to expose the devil enough word to bring you above your struggle that how much God care for his church are we together let's go quickly you read that when you go home verse 7even and when he have opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast what is the fourth Beast ego beautiful beautiful I heard the voice of the fourth Beast saying come and see and I look and behold this one is pure which mean the mix of color white red black have mixed death hell itself yes sir which mean that the that the enemy power from the first three Church ages the the the enemy power from the Dark Age and the enemy power from the reformer Everything Has Come Together that's the reason why it's so hard to live Christian Life unless God give you a birth unless God give you a revelation because all the spirits from from from that crucify Jesus Christ that ran behind the Apostle they are all in this day fighting against you Bel belonging to the message is not all about it I believe the message I baptized in Jesus name it's not all about it we are not we are not into a picnic we are into a battle yes it's a battle that is already w we have to stay under the cross we have to listen to the instruction of the Lamb when he said come and see open your eyes and see don't sleep in church so in as much as there there are four anointing that should gather Church the lamb has also revealed four anointing that is fighting against the church God bless you boys say that thank you [Applause] are you seeing the picture and these four anointing they don't have no Christmas plan for you praise the Lord amen no they don't have no Christmas plan if if if if they were not important if they were not destructive the line would not reveal them the line would not expose them if they were things that we must just Overlook they are the powers that is Waring against our children the power that is Waring against our marriage the power that is Waring against our church are we together now you see that's that's the reason why Revelation chapter 5 was or is the most Sublime scripture in the Bible glory be to God because like I said and brother brah said Christ is revealed in his own word he said what is the seal the seal is Christ you have to understand it that way the seal is the releasing of Christ because what Adam fell from Adam fell from the very life of God he was a Son of God made in the image of God and God birth into his nostril and he became a living Soul so when the enemy came and introduced a perverted life to him he fell from the life of God the very life of God and that's what this message have come to restore not just to make you a church member this message has come to strike your soul with the very life of God so we must not take proud and worship our nature well that's my nature that's the way I can behave it's not good it will ruin you to hell yes the devil have access to that nature right you just praying your nature whole day it's not even helping you praise the Lord whenever when whenever we fall and whenever we get into a weak position well that's my nature that's my weakness I can read something to you from from uh souls in praising brother BR says all the church ages from Ephesus to laaa he said they were all under the blood this age has been given the life that was in the blood that's what the token is that's the reason why uh H uh uh uh uh uh we we have a word of such a high standard people come around they don't understand it why because it's the releasing of Christ Christ is releasing his life once again when Adam was in the Garden of Eden he did not have the nature of his father and his mother he did not have father and mother his father was God the life that was that was producing out of him was God's own life and that's what God want to restore us back to for us to go in the Rapture that's why you don't you don't we don't play you don't play with little things habits lies in this identify it place it under the blood deny it you don't play with it it's going to ruin your it's going to ruin your life it will deny you from a token life it's going to deny you from a token life praise the Lord and that's I mean that's that's all that uh uh you know uh uh the the the the generation is Young uh uh uh people love the Lord they serving the lord you know your parents are start carrying to church when you were small oh you you always want to be in church praise the Lord as soon as we buy our car and get our driver license we get our important things to do then we start to slack from church then the next thing is that we want to get married I just want to settle down get my family praise the Lord and that's wonderful and then when we when we get married you know that yeah you know my wife believ the message she knows that I I you know adulterate is wrong my husband believ the message he knows that we don't do those things so because of that concept we start playing church we think that we have arrived but there is a devil out there there is a there is a pill house out there like the Bible says a rolling lion praise the Lord if he can just drop things in your mind or drop things in your Spirit Dro things in the church praise the Lord and we start campaigning and fasting this one and and that one and this one that I mean the devil don't have a work to do brother bam says he goes have a picnic you have me fighting against you the devil goes for picnic that's the only time he goes for vacation he want to drop things right in our home he will just bring it in innocently it's always his approach is is is the is is the first horse rid always come white it come so innocent and then why it stay there the color start changing praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight I will have read some things to you tonight but uh the drama has taken all the time praise the Lord I hope it was a blessing it's just to encourage you amen it's just to encourage you is just to wake you wake you to the reality of what is happening that's where we are this is the full power the full anointing that is given to influence the church and it influences Us in in every stage of our life when you are mouring or you are going through trial God will come and comfort you he will give you an ox anointing for you to Bear it praise the Lord sometimes he gave you a lonon anointing you have an aggressive Faith he just raised you to that place you just believe God you are taking God's word you you can't take no for for for an answer it's it's it's a lion's anointing and sometime all you need is just a man's anointing he open your understanding to a scripture the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want it's just enough praise the Lord that's what he has given to influence the church that's the thing that influences us that's why whether in the good time or in a bad time there is something that that that that that that encourage you there is something that influen you to keep pressing on the church is influenced by this anointing and the church is also fought against by the four beast power that is out there praise the Lord you love the Lord amen you know we used to sing a little chorus back home that says you know the chorus was actually from uh the chorus was was from St John chapter 4 come and see the man that told me everything that I have done but this one we can say come and see the lamb amen come and see the lamb Jesus is the Lamb Jesus is the man that told me everything that I've done Jesus is the Lamb that has reveal everything everything that I know everything I have seen everything have understood that's why you can don't you can make things in your mind it must line up with the word if it does not line up with the word the enemy is going to hang you with that thing you love the Lord tonight amen musicians you can come come let's just uh sing a song uh [Music] [Music] [Music] the thing that is giving you that is keeping you in your right mind is because you are drinking from the Lord's cup don't underestimate [Music] it every time we come to a service and the Holy Ghost bring an inspiration on a preacher and he says something that encourages you the preacher say something you get mad at him well you should explain to yourself why you getting mad you should just explain to yourself why why should I go to the service and get mad but as long as we are drinking from the Lost [Music] cup we identify with his death his Buri his resurrection it open our eyes to see the things that God want us to do because I'm telling you if you are not drinking from the Lamb's cup you are drinking from that woman's cup it's an adulterous cup it's going to make you drunk you will be right in church you be doing things that you know you're not supposed to do [Music] let's stand to our feet tonight while we sing that song together and just lift our hands to the

reality Jesus is hoing me now let me tell you something let me tell you something you can bring that song right into what I explain to you tonight Jesus is the Lamb that's what overcoming is when it said the lamb has prevailed the lamb has overcome he's the one that is holding the book He's giving you victory by showing you the tricks of the enemy and brother bam said that's how we overcome we overcome by Goring the lies of the devil we overcome by Goring the tricks of the enemy and that's what the lamb is doing come and Seed not come and sleep come and Seed [Music] to give you Victory you got to see it it's not why you fight it's not you when you see it when the Lord open it to you the lord gave you a revelation of it that's what gave you Victory is the opening of the word that gives

every time we we say this just for an [Music] example there was now one time that Jesus ever openly spoke to Judas yet he knew that he was the son of pedition but he was calling Peter out every time Peter would do something he was calling it's a sign of an elect when the word is calling you when you can take correction from the [Music] word Jesus said blessed is he that is not offended in me how can we be offended in the word when when when the word comes to correct us it comes to set us right right it comes to put us in our place it comes to help us to walk [Music] better like I said don't glorify don't glorify don't glorify your fleshly nature don't glorify those things well mean that's my nature don't glorify it if it's not right Lord change me Lord make me better Lord help me to Rise Above [Music] This because it's is the life on displayed is the life on displayed not just being covered by the blood but the life must be on display it has to be a token life it has to be a token

be to that place and say Lord help me to say the truth all the time Lord help me when I'm wrong I must be able to apologize Lord help me let me get my temple out of the way is not helping me it's
