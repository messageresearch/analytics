got to remember it so as soon as I heard it I said okay brother Max's daughter name is Karen I make sure that I don't forget about it if there is one good thing this trip did for me is to remember her name amen is it's a it's an awful thing when you when you just forget people names so I'm glad that it's not going to go away from me the moment I think on Max and uh sister terce I would remember her name but we had a good time we had a good time and uh uh uh they had a nice group down there and uh also brother L say I should send his greeting he want me to greet you specially say greet Mom for me so uh uh uh and uh he came down to see us uh and we we had good time there together and uh we had a uh Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning service praise the Lord amen what the desert that place is very hot came right out of the airport my tongue got dry in my mouth I knew I was in the desert amen but uh it was good Monday we brought the rain down amen we brought the rain down so the god Showers of rain amen so we thank the lord we had a good good three services with them and what a blessing amen so it's a blessing to preach to people that love the word amen praise the Lord what a horrible thing it would be to preach to people that don't love the word man you just you can just feel the negative energy but you're just preaching and preaching and preaching you know and and even when you want to stop just keep asking you to preach but uh we have to remind him that we need to come back home praise the lord we never went with any plan to die in the desert we wanted to preach and come right back home I want to look at something tonight that caught my attention for the while I've been looking at it before before we got down there to harizon didn't preach on the door even though while uh just talking to brother um Daniel we had a oh man that uh old Soldier man I mean that old man he he would just he would just keep you thinking amen keep you thinking so tonight let's go to St John chapter 3 very familiar very familiar in John chapter 3 very very familiar very familiar that's what Jesus gave the teaching on the new birth and uh and for a good while now I've come to realize that this teaching of the New Birth is for preachers if there are ever a group of people that need to be born again are preachers when Jesus was talking he was he was talking to a teacher of the Lord he was not talking to the publicans and uh you know and he was talking to the teachers of the Lord so uh praise the Lord let's read from verse one there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rber we know that thou are a teacher come from God we know we the Pharisees we we the Sanhedrin we the ruler of the Jews he's speaking on behalf of the entire Jewish Council he says we know which mean if they know means that they are talking about it amen they are sitting and they are discussing we just heard he healed the blind look gentlemen we might not believe what that man believe but he's a man from God praise the Lord amen I said that I do a little parenthesis here a brother sent me a video today and uh it's a Pentecostal preacher that is preaching and he's talking about brother Brandon he get his story all mix up but he's talking about brother Brandon and he says uh you know well uh uh he's talking about brother Brandon how brother Brandon you know Inspire him talking about brother Brandon discernment and this brother text me you know send me the video and then he text me you know uh even even unbelieving preachers are talking about the prophet and this man is not even in church he's unbelieving preacher he's talking about the prophet you that a true uh believer you are not in church we don't even know where you are praise the Lord someone that is testifying about brother brandham you call them unbelieving preaches you that a Believer we can't see you praise the Lord the Lord that that is a parenthesis I don't even know where I was going with that praise the Lord but when I look at I just I just shook my head I didn't even reply because I know where he wanted to go I mean uh uh uh if we if we believe that he's a prophet we must we must follow the message he has given us he have instructed us how to you know uh uh raise our home and love our wives serve the love better is not just knowing him as a prophet but doing what the message taking the message that he has given to us okay let's let's get back to our reading tonight praise the Lord the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Raba we know that thou are a teacher come from God and no man can do this miracle that thou dust accept God be with him praise the Lord amen so they know that this man God was with him they couldn't understand all the details of his ministry but he knew that this was a man of God praise the Lord amen and uh we we we sit on the branch of uh uh American politics and another woman is running for president everybody is on the edge because they want to bring 1933 prophecy brother Bram said I mean the whole internet is going to be filled with it but it has already been fulfilled you know he told us to every prophecy there is a spiritual application and and the and the physical PA he told us that you know there that was that was the uh the scol colar Beast which is which is the the the the Roman Church praise the Lord but we know that no man can do these things except God be with him verse three Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I said unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven the Lord bless you you may have your seat let's stay right there we read that again now Nicodemus is saying all of this to Jesus this is just just just a little hesitation now uh just I really want us to spend time in prayer tonight and uh uh Nicodemus is saying all of this to Jesus it it might sound like uh like an acceptance speech it might sound like uh a little word of Praise all the time the the Pharisees are condemning him you are aible you you get evil spirit but this time one of them is coming and he's and he's and he's saying something that might sound like a little a little accepting speech we know that you are a teacher from God and no man can do these things that you are doing to open the blind eyes and and a man born blind you open his eyes and uh uh we knew uh BL bimos and and you give him his sight and and uh uh uh jy's daughter you rais jy's daughter up I mean these guys they had the record of everything that Jesus was doing praise the Lord they might stand in the public and argue but when they sit in councel they said this man was a man of God praise the Lord now you would think that after Nicodemus who say that Jesus Will says oh man thank you Nicodemus I'm very glad you know I'm I'm happy you know uh I'm really really appreciate you coming tonight but he turned to him and said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now Jesus was trying to show Nicodemus the disconnect why you believe that I am a manent from God but yet you are not following me he was trying to show him the disconnect from your own mouth you say no man can do this work yet you don't believe me to be the Messiah praise the Lord amen so he was trying to show Nicodemus the disconnect and that disconnect is still real today it's the disconnect that we all have we all we are born with that disconnect praise the Lord our natural birth give us a disconnect we can go to church come to church enjoy the music listen to the preach preaching even sit there and say that's truth praise the Lord amen but yet there is a disconnect and sometimes our heart believe that is the truth but yet the strength to be able to step into that truth so Jesus was trying to show Nicodemus the disconnect that's what I want that's the first place I want to establish tonight don't worry we have a long way to go with this subject I'm just only greeting you tonight except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen and as we will as we will we will we will go along and read you know we will we will learn that uh see means to understand praise the Lord except he's born again he he would not be able to really put it together because he believed that it's God but sometimes he take it personal he think that it's against him they thought that Jesus was was was you making the the Lord of God of tradition says oh you are trying to blast us and you know and and sometimes we take it personal because that disconnect is there and that is the work of the Holy Ghost to connect you your real you with the Father the real you that is beyond all all your Tendencies your your habit your attitudes your thoughts they rear you to connect it back to God that's the work of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord do you see how much when we talk about the fall the fall it means that men fail from somewhere and that fall created a disconnect praise the Lord so Jesus came to to brid their back he came to bridge death back are we together are we together do you see how people can sit down believe the message for many years and walk away and say it is not the truth all because of the disconnect and sometime the disconnect is now with the is is now with the Bible because this this this Bible this word of God remain truth amen it remain truth but it's just at that place there our our our human tendency our falling nature cannot come to submit under the word to be kill that Fallen nature do not want to die that there sep seed because whether we believe it or not uh uh we have a mixture amen a mix between sep and uh the SE and Eve that's what breed this body of house amen so uh uh so there but then listen here Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born praise the Lord can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born how can a man be born again praise the Lord now he's a rotor of the Lord he's a he's a he's a strip as a scallet a man uh when it talk about the ruler of the Lord you know uh they were the men that steud they steud the Torah that language he could not he could not connect it to the Torah there was nothing in the Torah that that he could really connect it to to explain to him about a new birth praise the Lord but he says something he says something and that's what I want to dwell on you know you you start to talk about the New Birth uh uh uh you know uh every one of us can be able to pull up our carard tonight and explain if I should start from uh God's way tonight and then just go everybody can be able to say to me tonight what the thing what the think the new birth is and none of you will be wrong but I'm not going to talk about the New Birth tonight I want to talk about going back into his mother's wom that's what he said to his understanding he said how can a man be born when he's old do he have to go back into his so so this is this is where I want I want for us to to pay attention because with all that we know and all that we can say the new birth is one of the thing that we do every one of us do we we take the new birth with the understanding of our natural birth praise the Lord amen and that that's what nicodemo was doing do I need to go back to my mother's home to be born again do I need to experience another natural birth and many of the times that's what we do because how do we do it we look at our natural life to be able to tell how much we are born again are you understanding what I'm saying we look at our natural life I mean if we are on fire we are praying you know what the joy of the Lord is my strength you know you you you have an evidence that you are born again but sometimes when you have trials and things are going on in your life and and and you question yourself am I really born again what what are you doing you are doing just like necro demon say praise the Lord you are expecting yourself to go back into the womb to be born a new why because you are looking at your physical tendency to believe that you are born again because know at this you I get no evil thought so I think I'm born again when it come again why I really don't know if I'm born again are we together how can a man how can a man be born when he is old how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb to be born and that's exactly what the church has been doing all of these years we have been going right back into the mother organization War praise the Lord oh that's that that's not how I believe it that's not how my church taught it in our church this is the way we used to you are going right back to your old womb you see because that is said even with the natural birth of the baby are you comfortable tonight amen are you okay tonight praise Lord even with the baby one time the the womb was the mo most comfortable place for the baby as that little baby grow in her mother's home she begins to know get a sense of everything in that atmosphere as she grows praise the Lord amen it's almost like when you grow in a church you you know the pastor you know when he will come praise the Lord you know which way he come from you know his favorite song you know you know you know you know you know why because you grow up in that church you grow up in that family you grow up in that Community you know everything about that Community when you move to the next place you say I'm I all place that's not the way they used to do it you are not in your old place amen when things starts to happen What do we do we want to go back do I need to go back that's what necod demon is saying and that is the thing that has handled our walk with God and I will say it and say it loud to you tonight that this message of the power is not to produce Pentecost no it's not to produce Pentecost are we together amen why because why I say that because you see when we read the book of Acts when we read the book of Acts that was the birth of the church Church all the the the apostles they prayed together in one ACC call you know they were they were in one ACC call you know the the the the the the they bring all their things and lay at the Apostle feet you know while they and then what is in our mind that was the beginning of the church so every Church Must Go will be going back to the to the womb but what did the prophet said he said we will write another book of Acts now that we will go back to the book of Acts no we will write another book of Acts because if we stay with the message the same holy ghost that came on the date of Pentecost is with us are we together so we're not going back to to to to Pentecost Acts chapter 2 no Acts chapter 2 is a stepping stone to birth us into a new experience are we together amen and that's one of the things that that that that that that that that handle the people All Through the Ages we having the very same problem that necod demon is having praise the Lord amen we have the very same problem because y said that we we we we we we believe that uh I mean that the disciples they repented they were baptized in Jesus name they reive the gift of the Holy Ghost you know and and and and and and and they started performing Miracles we we believe in Jesus we baptize in jesus' name you know uh uh uh uh we we receive the holy because so in our mind now we must be playing out the same thing praise the Lord many of us the way we think about the New Birth is the way we understand the natural birth to us when when my Mama gave birth to me I was born praise the Lord I was born and uh in in a in a natural sense in a natural sense I have a birth date praise the lord it's coming us soon anyway October 1st I have a birthdaye praise the Lord amen that's my birthdaye well let's let's read something I will tie that together tonight I will I'll leave you at 9:00 we have a service on Saturday night so I shouldn't keep you longer I try to leave you at 9:00 I send just a quote up there if uh our sister will help me put that up tonight the angel of the Lord praise the Lord amen can we read the first phrase together the new birth is an experiened praise the Lord and if you look all through brother Brandon message he make an emphasis how the new birth is an experience let me bring it to you this way I have my birthday the day I was born is that the only experience I will have in my life you you understood my question but I didn't hear no answer praise the Lord after after my birthday or after your birthday is that the only experience you have is the beginning praise the Lord when you start to sit is an experience so that experience of sitting can you call it a birth if you call it a birth will you be making sense why the reason why you would not call it a birth because you attached birth to the womb when the prophet said birth is an experience you see you be we we behaving just like necod demons you will not call that a birth because you only attach birth to the womb the birth that is attached to the womb is natural birth the new birth a prophet say is what experience so do that means that every experience you have in your Christian Life is a birth does that means that praise Lord are you afraid praise the lord it's a test where nobody fails okay nobody fails so don't be afraid don't be afraid to be wrong nobody fails amen you already passed before you were tested are we together but do you see where I'm coming from are you understanding what I'm driving to tonight because that is the disconnect that is the problem with the Christian church we keep going back and brother brandham said it's it's it's an unclean Spirit he said it's it's an unclean Spirit the three unclean Spirit from the book of Acts those Spirit of frogs he says uh he says that's that's what it is he said that's a spirit that is that is on the church that's the reason why the church never keeps her Victory why because she keeps going back praise the Lord if if the night she gave her heart to the Lord she cry oh she cried and and and she she just cried she will cry uncontrollably and and and and all the joy of the Lord just fill her heart that she want to keep experiencing that same thing every day every day every day every day that baby will never grow that baby will never grow no we must grow from experience to experience we must be Experiencing God in New ways in our life praise the Lord the same thing that happened to the church organization when Luther came out the J shall live by faith it was a birth because it was an experience of justification it was a move of God but what happened the same old thing she went right back to her mother's wom went back to the Catholic system and every time the church goes back it denominates every time you go back you denominate because what they what they prophesied the pillow of fire keep moving and he want to carry us from one experience look at the walk with the children of Israel in the wilderness God never kept them one place they were going from one experience to another experience and what were they Desiring go back to Egypt they wanted to go back to their mother's wom why because they were comfortable with Egypt Egypt was a comfort zone for them they know where to go and get a garlic they know where to go and get the bread they know where to go and get the onions this other place is a new place we don't even understand anything here I mean everything they do in this church is different and I mean it's not like our church it would never be in your church if a child was just going to stay in the womb that all it would knows it would never speak human language because it's just in the womb and that's the thing that is that is that that that's the trouble for the church because the people God used to theas Creed blessing the the moving of God the speaking of tongues and prophecy and all of that Propet comes and he starts to bring the word so we don't know that all of these years we've been taught Adam and Eve ate apple and he's coming he's saying this who is he that's the very same thing that Nicodemus and his men were doing and that's the very thing the church keeps doing on and on and on that's why today we think we get the victory tomorrow we lost it because you know in Liberia in our church man when we come together for church in Liberia I mean let me tell you don't know I know what you're doing your in liia you understand what I'm talking about and as long as you stay that way you are not going anywhere you keep living in the past the presence is not real to you you are not real to the environment that is around you you know you are not even understanding what God is doing why because you are living in a dead past the past is dead that's what the scripture says living those things in the past let's press onto the mark of the High Calling that's what the scripture says people that make the past their Heroes your hero is dead you make the future of your hero he has not come yet so you are dead are we together love the Lord tonight am I making sense is a picture coming together amen because that's the way we associate birth the moment you talk about birth is associated with warb in the natural sense praise the Lord in the natural sense glory be to God Amen so when a person is uh is is is is orthodox and think that every birth must must be birth from the womb and the year that this little child was placed in the incubator this starts to feel funny because the way you understand birath it must be a womb so now in your mind you starts to feel funny praise the Lord amen yeah because when you stay when you stay to those to those old ideas you don't appreciate what God is doing in the present times praise the Lord you don't appreciate it oh my my my my you love the Lord let's let's let's let's go back to that code that's the only one I have tonight I bring the rest of them as time goes on Amen I have I have bunch of subject lining up that I've never finished and I'm starting the new one but it's okay I we'll pick it up as we go along love the Lord the new birth is an experience it's a gift of God is the Seal of your faith the Holy Ghost is a seal Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption God made Abraham a promise and Abraham believed God what was the promise that God made Abraham I make you a father of nation I'll take you to a land who maker and Builder is God but do you know that God gave Abraham three birth he had to come out of his Kindred amen he had to come out of his Nation he had to come out of his his father house if we want to call it that way we we sh with three way we can be able to place it so so all of those things that Abraham had to come out of if you take it in the Natural Life sense it was an environment that he live in it was an environment that he lived in and he was comfortable and that environment was a warm for him because it kept him he survived but yet God told him to come out to be birth praise the Lord amen so you see the church can relate a new birth to Christian experience but yet their old traditional ideas can be hindering them from experiencing what they are birthed to they gave their life to Jesus they accepting as their lord and savior but their Traditions the the way they were grown the way they were taught the things that is in their mind is hening them for enjoying this blessing because they they are those they are stay in the womb of how things were done back there that's why the church couldn't move on with the Revival praise the lord it's almost like they were lost Luther said the judge shall live by faith let's go back to the Bible and and leave this Latin language of of of of the Roman Catholic church we are just speaking Latin we can't even understand what we are talking about and the church comes out they are lost like brother Bram says he says that baby comes out and it's it's realized oh wow there's a lot of space here oh wow glory be to God is kicking his leg why she's having an experience she's experiencing a new environment she get a lot of room now to move around glory be to God while she was in that womb she never thought that she could walk because she was just curved in the womb but here say she's birth and when she look at the Ultra sign said what was that me praise the Lord come come come come and see me come and see me but she couldn't do that when she was in the womb and that's what happened when we stay in the womb of our old ideas old church creates you will never be able to enjoy the things you are birth into praise the Lord when a prophet of God said you never did it the first place it will just become a slog for you you don't understand that because you are stay in a warm of where you got to work your way to Salvation you got to show works it never become real to you because you are stay in that ideas of the old church the way it's supposed to be done every preacher bringing the church back to their old womb the other preacher said that's the way that that's the new birth this the new birth is this he still caught up in his old denominational ideas praise the lord we must preach and make the people feel bad then then the message is Anointed when the gospel is to set them free what kind of for people that are free Fe bad this world makes you rejoice look it look like we be we being so beat down on our head to even say the amen we got to be begging for it we got to look over our shoulder before we say amen and they come to spank men again praise the Lord amen we're all of the room that we have to lift our hands and praise the Lord we're not even using the atmosphere why because we're so crumbled down in the womb of our old church all ideas all denomination praise the Lord that little baby in the womb is just being technical how am I going out of here I got to think about it praise the Lord how can I get out of here you better learn to start rejoicing in the Liberty that God has given you you better learn to start rejoicing in the word let the word of God brings you Joy let the preaching of the word word revive you make you happy you go to work you s you come to church you s what is that praise the Lord why should the joy only stay on the piano when the piano is just the beginning of it don't worry Joy when the anointing struck me you see me playing so don't worry you're looking at s now me don't worry amen people just I mean we just sit back we are observing okay I know what he's talking about yeah I know what he's talking about yeah you're trying to talk to me indirectly yeah I know why you going with that thing praise the Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord amen love the Lord tonight I look at the clock it says 9:00 musicians you can come up close let's stand on our feet little bit let's sing that chorus the joy of the Lord is my strength I'm not going to do the Laughing part because I don't know it we just do the is my strength the joy of the Lord

father we just brought this little thought tonight to encourage your children Lord oh god father how we are haunted in our mind no Lord God when necod demon went that night it troubled him Lord Born Again born again what did he mean what did he mean he's talking about born of the water born of the spirit he's thinking about it and yeah the disconnect is there he can't connect he can't connect to that because it's not a natural birth it's not a natural birth oh dear God father I know even Lord your people could be thinking different in your mind tonight Minds could be going from here there Lord and up y father but Lord God I believe that's what your Prophet man when he he says after the seals were open the Bible became a new book they bringing us to more reality than Traditions father I pray to God May that Spirit birth upon this church Lord because Lord the reality of your word it takes fear away from us it takes doubt away it takes condemnation away from our heart because we know Lord Jesus Jesus we keep falling in love with you you keep taking us Lord from one experience to another oh God I pray father that even this weekend Lord you will give us Lord another experience when we when we are connected back to that place Lord when we are connected back oh God to our original identity then we can say like d David our glad when he said unto me let's go into the house of the Lord we want to hear the word we want to be in your presence Lord because oh God the word brings rejoicing you speak to our hearts Lord even even in a sense of correction we can lift our hands and say thank you Lord you called my name you spoke to me you corrected me father if there is one thing that we must be angry about is the life of sin oh God like David said we must hit it with perfect hatred we must hit sin Lord if the preacher cry out to God he must cry out against sin we have no reason to be angry with with your children we have no reason to God to be chasing them down and shaming them and condemning them but we must preach the Lord of Libor we must preach the word that will bring conviction that Lord they can be thankful that you corrected them thankful Lord that you spoke to their heart thankful that you rebuked them but he will take that connection Lord and only you can give it even Nicodemus a ruler of the Lord he couldn't see it do I have to go back to my mother's wom and Lord that's what the church has been doing for 2,000 years that's how the church has been doing to God all through the church ages we keep going back to our mother's wom but Lord you have called a little bride you have called a little bride to come up higher you are called a little bride of God to come up higher and to begin to look at things different and begin to experience and and and appreciate the different things that the grace of God is going to take her life through she don't have to be afraid she don't have to live with condemnation and judgment in her mind but she can enjoy Bo the perfect Liberty James says when we look in the word we are looking into the perfect Liberty of Jesus Christ father I pray that you bless us now and as we go home and uh bless us Lord Jesus as
