[35:24] to send one of God soldiers home brother
[35:27] Samuel Dale in Georgia went to be with
[35:30] the
[35:31] Lord and uh so brother Samuel that
[35:35] preached for us on Wednesday night was
[35:38] actually supposed to go down to preach
[35:40] for brother
[35:41] Samuel and uh when we got a call that he
[35:45] was rushed to the hospital and then uh
[35:48] he went to be with the Lord so because
[35:50] of everything down there we had to we
[35:53] had to change things around I I wanted
[35:56] for brother samel to come and another
[35:57] time but when he called me then I said
[36:00] okay let's see how we can be able to
[36:02] work this out so uh this morning brother
[36:05] fam Joseph from Nigeria is uh a good
[36:09] friend of ours and he's familiar with us
[36:12] here I think the last time he was here
[36:14] was 2018 so it's been a while so he was
[36:18] actually supposed to fly over on
[36:19] Wednesday night but with the change in
[36:22] schedule we we were able to talk with
[36:25] brother Benny Perry to and preach there
[36:28] in South Carolina while we have brother
[36:31] Samuel come and speak for us just to be
[36:34] able to accommodate the brothers and
[36:36] then uh uh so brother famy came in and
[36:41] uh
[36:43] uh Thursday night but Samuel flew out on
[36:47] Friday morning to
[36:49] Ohio um to to leave with the Saints
[36:52] there this morning and while we were
[36:55] getting ready for service this morning I
[36:57] got another call uh another good friend
[37:02] of our us and uh our
[37:05] brother uh John
[37:07] badugu if uh some of you will remember
[37:11] he uh preached for us here before and I
[37:14] call him uh uh I call him brother I call
[37:17] him Big
[37:18] John Big John a very big brother uh he
[37:22] was getting ready for service this
[37:24] morning and uh and then he just he just
[37:29] slum it took a while for his family to
[37:31] know that he was he was not I mean he
[37:34] had slum up or thought of and then when
[37:38] they got to him he was
[37:40] unresponsive so they called the the
[37:43] ambulance and U tried to resuscitate him
[37:47] and took him to the hospital and
[37:49] pronounced that he went to be with the
[37:51] Lord now uh uh brother John did did a
[37:56] lot of work in Togo and Benin that's
[38:00] that's two countries there in West
[38:02] Africa right between Nigeria and Ghana
[38:06] and uh he really work in the rural area
[38:10] so uh this uh this is a really blow to
[38:14] the the group there you know because he
[38:17] was he normally come over and be with
[38:19] his son in South Carolina just to be
[38:22] able to do some of his medical checkup
[38:25] so that's why he was around for
[38:28] and yet it pleased the Lord to take our
[38:29] brother home so we will just uh let's
[38:33] just bow our heads together and we just
[38:36] want to remember these different wants
[38:39] and these different needs

[50:33] that you ever meet in this world but we
[50:35] are God's children and someday we spend
[50:39] eternity together amen and then uh tral
[50:45] blocks and fences and colors and all
[50:49] that will be a thing of the pass the
[50:52] prophet said will speak one great big
[50:54] language in heaven
[50:57] amen then we have the same
[50:59] tongue and all will blend into
[51:03] eternity amen see the world is a is life
[51:09] is enshrouded in Mysteries things that
[51:12] we can't even understand but we always
[51:16] submit to the will of God Amen things
[51:20] happens around us and uh we don't the
[51:23] prophet taught us not to ask God why
[51:27] because we are God's children because
[51:29] we've been taught that all things works
[51:32] together for good to them that love the
[51:35] Lord amen and are they called according
[51:38] to his purpose and sometimes if God will
[51:41] open our understanding to know why
[51:43] certain things happen Hallelujah you
[51:46] crawl from here on your knees to your to
[51:49] where you came from this morning even if
[51:51] it's 100 miles with your hands up say
[51:55] thank you Jesus
[51:57] thank you Jesus and yet is not pleasing
[51:59] to the flesh but is the will of him that
[52:02] knows tomorrow which is God Almighty and
[52:05] we always submit to his will and we keep
[52:08] on clutching to the word of God because
[52:11] that's the only thing that is setting
[52:13] today that's the only thing that has
[52:15] life that's the only thing that has the
[52:18] attachment of Eternal reward any other
[52:21] thing that is contrary to that is
[52:24] fut cannot be dependent upon everything
[52:28] is a sinking sign the whole world is
[52:31] sinking amen America is sinking Nigeria
[52:34] is sinking but God's kingdom is not
[52:37] sinking no amen so we keep on holding on
[52:40] to it and someday God's mercies will
[52:43] deliver us at the golden corridors of
[52:45] Heaven Hallelujah and then it will be
[52:48] worth it all when we see Jesus

[54:34] it to you yes Lord by grace through
[54:36] faith he Save You by grace and you are
[54:39] holding on to it by believing that it is
[54:42] so yes nothing else you can't prove your
[54:45] salvation other than that I can't prove
[54:48] it other than that there's no physical
[54:50] element we can use to prove as a y stick
[54:53] that I'm saved you are saved we are
[54:55] saved by through faith
[54:58] believing that we are saved all right
[55:01] and uh and that and that not of
[55:04] yourselves it is the gift of God Amen
[55:07] not of Works lest any man should boast
[55:11] for we are his what workmanship we are
[55:14] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[55:17] unto good works which God hath before
[55:21] ordained that we should walk in them if
[55:24] be seated why will take Revelation
[55:28] 3:14
[55:30] amen Revelation
[55:35] 3:14 the Bible also
[55:39] says and unto the angel of the Church of
[55:42] the leans right these things sayth the
[55:47] amen
[55:49] hallelujah the
[55:52] final the faithful and true witness the
[55:56] beginning of the creation of God the
[55:59] beginning of the creation of God spoke
[56:02] hallelujah amen so this morning just a
[56:05] little uh thought or word of
[56:08] encouragement and that is uh God's
[56:11] workmanship amen preacher have a lot you
[56:15] know maybe not speak from this speak
[56:18] from this and they just need God to help
[56:20] you to be able to pick out one and it's
[56:23] the spirit of God that is the mother of
[56:25] the church that know what the church has
[56:27] need of the preacher in his physical
[56:29] element doesn't Hallelujah and sometimes
[56:32] you can even pick your title and the
[56:34] Holy Spirit change your subject to suit
[56:37] the need of the people and we all we
[56:40] only trust in God Almighty so this
[56:44] morning trusting that we have our
[56:46] undivided attention we want to uh speak
[56:49] on God's
[56:51] workmanship Hallelujah now uh
[56:54] workmanship sometimes
[56:57] we like the man that built this Pulpit
[57:00] the his pay sometime we call his pay or
[57:03] his payment workmanship but that is not
[57:06] what we are talking about this morning
[57:09] yes maybe he charge $100 or $1,000 you
[57:12] see that's the amount money he want to
[57:14] charge for this the money we pay him is
[57:17] also known as workmanship but that is
[57:19] not a definition this morning Hallelujah
[57:23] workmanship means something that is made
[57:26] something that is affected something
[57:28] that was
[57:29] created right yes so back to the pit
[57:32] this pit now is the workmanship of the
[57:35] carpenter that made
[57:37] it right and as he made
[57:42] it he trust his own skill he beli in his
[57:46] own work and after he finish making it
[57:50] did he come condemning it
[57:53] no maybe the pastor gave him the
[57:56] specification he want social Dimension
[57:59] the width the length the breadth the
[58:00] height everything and he made it
[58:03] according to his specification or
[58:05] wherever it was made right and after he
[58:08] finish making it he will look at it and
[58:11] he will admire it oh this is better than
[58:14] the other one I made for suu church you
[58:16] know this one is here the angle he will
[58:19] look at it and he will admire it he will
[58:23] love it he will appreciate the product
[58:27] of his own skill amen he will appreciate
[58:30] the very work of his own hand he won't
[58:33] condemn
[58:34] it right yes and if the pastor the
[58:37] trustees are trying to condemn the work
[58:39] he will convince them to believe that
[58:43] his work is perfect he will never agree
[58:46] that his work is is not good Hallelujah
[58:50] and if man will not condemn his own work
[58:53] how much more God do you think God will
[58:56] condemn his own work Hallelujah and here
[58:59] the Bible is telling us that we are
[59:01] God's workmanship in other what God made
[59:04] us
[59:06] yes right and if man what man made he
[59:10] will not condemn it do you think God
[59:11] will condemn what he made come on
[59:14] brother it's not possible and here is
[59:16] God the Eternal he knew the End Amen he
[59:20] knew the end right from the beginning
[59:22] right and is the word of the Living God
[59:26] is the provision to overcome every
[59:29] Temptations and trials because God knew
[59:32] the end he saw you know he saw the end
[59:36] right from the beginning and he saw
[59:38] every activities of the devil how the
[59:40] devil will rise up against the church
[59:43] therefore he made the provisions in his
[59:45] scriptures to fight and overcome the
[59:48] enemy because God saw Satan before Satan
[59:51] moved yes then he could profer he could
[59:55] make something to
[59:56] counter the activities of the devil and
[59:59] that is why we always hide ourselves
[1:00:01] behind the scriptures behind the word
[1:00:04] this is the only fortification we
[1:00:06] have praise the name of the Lord that's
[1:00:09] the only fortification we have no other
[1:00:12] fortification anywhere praise the name
[1:00:14] of the Lord so workmanship is something
[1:00:18] that is affected something that is made
[1:00:21] something that is produced the act or
[1:00:24] skill of the work man the art a t the
[1:00:28] art of a Workman amen the art knowing
[1:00:32] how to do something praise the name of
[1:00:35] the Lord the out of uh playing the
[1:00:37] keyboard the art of preaching the art of
[1:00:39] carpentry the art of uh you know artist
[1:00:43] painting sculptor and all that so the
[1:00:45] art of a
[1:00:47] Workman the prophet says we only come to
[1:00:51] remind us of what we had already known
[1:00:54] not bringing any special thing
[1:00:56] hallelujah or anything new now the Son
[1:00:59] of God himself said believe me for the
[1:01:01] very work sake if they could project it
[1:01:04] for us where is our
[1:01:06] screen no
[1:01:10] screen BR W answer me
[1:01:12] now I thought you said they will project
[1:01:15] just go ahead go ahead I should just go
[1:01:17] ahead yes all right God bless you amen
[1:01:21] and God bless all our friends Hallelujah
[1:01:24] from Steve God bless you sir
[1:01:26] and BR used to sit here right amen so
[1:01:31] the Son of God himself said believe me
[1:01:33] for the very work sake no I'm asking
[1:01:36] because if it's there I could see it
[1:01:38] I'll just read and I'll be free from
[1:01:40] this but all is well Hallelujah the Son
[1:01:43] of God himself said believe me for the
[1:01:46] very work sake you know when Jesus came
[1:01:48] believe me for the very work's sake he
[1:01:50] put an emphasis on his own
[1:01:53] works that's Jesus Christ here we go to
[1:01:57] St John chapter
[1:01:58] 10 St John 10 from verse 37 and 38 St
[1:02:03] John chapter 10 we see what happens
[1:02:06] there St John chapter 10:
[1:02:09] 37-38 if I do not the works of my father
[1:02:12] sayth Jesus he say what believe me not
[1:02:18] because Jesus came here preaching the
[1:02:20] word of God doing good Healing The Sick
[1:02:24] raising the Dead isn't it feeding the
[1:02:28] hungry and yet it was difficult for them
[1:02:31] to believe him and he told them look if
[1:02:35] you can't believe if you can't believe
[1:02:37] me he said for the very sake of the
[1:02:39] works that I do these works are not
[1:02:42] natural they are Supernatural you should
[1:02:44] believe me because of that
[1:02:47] work and Jesus Works meant a lot to him
[1:02:51] because the prophet said he placed a lot
[1:02:53] of emphasis on his way
[1:02:57] you can't believe me you believe the
[1:02:58] work they testify of me they prove that
[1:03:02] they show that I came from God and I'm
[1:03:04] going back to God and Nicodemus said you
[1:03:07] said look nobody can do these works
[1:03:10] except God be with him and it was still
[1:03:13] difficult for them to believe and then
[1:03:15] he told them believe me for the very
[1:03:17] work sake Hallelujah so now in believe I
[1:03:22] do believe I do that's 38 though ye
[1:03:26] believe not me believe the works that ye
[1:03:29] may know that that you may know and
[1:03:31] believe that the father is in me and I
[1:03:33] in him Hallelujah so the prophet say
[1:03:36] Jesus emphasized his work his works why
[1:03:39] he was here on Earth The Works that he
[1:03:42] did were ordained of God to inspire
[1:03:44] faith in him amen hallelujah the work
[1:03:49] that Jesus
[1:03:51] did for God by God inspired faith in
[1:03:58] Jesus for example the song leader let
[1:04:01] song this morning he was working for God
[1:04:04] right working for the church he was a
[1:04:07] blessing to the people that we encourage
[1:04:10] him to
[1:04:13] continue so as Jesus was working right
[1:04:16] and God vindicating it inspired Faith
[1:04:21] yes right yes you are preaching you are
[1:04:24] doing whatever you are doing for God and
[1:04:26] it it inspires faith it gives you the
[1:04:30] whatever to continue serving God so
[1:04:33] Jesus emphasized his own
[1:04:36] work now it was a great part of his
[1:04:39] ministry his holy spirit in the Apostle
[1:04:42] Paul said for we are his workmanship I
[1:04:44] love that thought for we are his
[1:04:46] workmanship created in Christ Jesus onto
[1:04:49] good works not unto bad works not onto
[1:04:52] Fear The Works which God has uh before
[1:04:56] ordained that we should work in them
[1:04:58] Ephesians 2:10 these Works were to
[1:05:00] inspire faith in him as they will show
[1:05:03] forth that that that relationship to him
[1:05:08] that Paul described as created in him
[1:05:11] amen now let's continue we read
[1:05:14] Revelation
[1:05:15] chapter 3:14 the Bible says that Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ is the beginning of the creation
[1:05:21] of God right and of course these are
[1:05:24] things we've heard in our in the schools
[1:05:26] and preachings and all that and the
[1:05:28] prophet said that the that word does not
[1:05:31] mean as it
[1:05:32] sounds it say it means as it sound it to
[1:05:35] mean that God created Jesus and then
[1:05:39] Jesus created other
[1:05:41] creations the prophecy is not so because
[1:05:45] Jesus is God so if God created Jesus and
[1:05:48] Jesus created other creations the
[1:05:50] universe and everything it contains it
[1:05:52] to mean that God created God and then
[1:05:56] God started creating other creations
[1:05:58] it's not
[1:06:00] so this is a distinct creation from the
[1:06:04] finished physical
[1:06:06] product right now so the B said the
[1:06:10] beginning of the creation of God that is
[1:06:13] who the Lord Jesus say he is hallelujah
[1:06:16] Jesus said he is the beginning of the
[1:06:18] creation of God mhm now if it sounds the
[1:06:23] way it means or if it means the way is
[1:06:25] sound then something is wrong because
[1:06:28] Jesus is a man of 2,000 years I'm
[1:06:31] talking about the physical body he a
[1:06:33] is's a man of 2,000 years but creation
[1:06:36] was about 6,000 years ago so that cannot
[1:06:39] imply that cannot mean what uh what he
[1:06:42] means right so he is a is a been of
[1:06:46] 2,000 years and uh the the the world is
[1:06:50] about 6,000 years old so it can't mean
[1:06:53] that that Jesus was was the very being
[1:06:56] that God
[1:06:57] created hallelujah amen that's Andrews
[1:07:01] you've changed brother God bless you
[1:07:05] amen so it does not mean as it sounds
[1:07:09] this is a distinct creation from the
[1:07:12] physical creation and Jesus happens to
[1:07:15] be the beginning of that wonderful
[1:07:18] creation and I believe you belong to
[1:07:20] that family this morning Hallelujah so
[1:07:23] now we you see just taking them the way
[1:07:27] they sound has made some people in fact
[1:07:29] multitude of people get the idea that
[1:07:32] Jesus was the first creation of God
[1:07:34] making him lower than the godhead and
[1:07:37] Jesus is the fullness of the godhead
[1:07:39] bodily Hallelujah then this first
[1:07:42] creation created all the rest of the
[1:07:44] universe and whatsoever it contains but
[1:07:46] that is not right you know that doesn't
[1:07:49] line up with the rest of the Bible these
[1:07:51] words are he is the beginner
[1:07:55] amen these words are the prophets giving
[1:07:58] us the understanding in seven Church
[1:07:59] ages he said these words are he is the
[1:08:02] beginner or the
[1:08:04] author of the creation of
[1:08:07] God and what is a beginner beginner
[1:08:11] means one that begins
[1:08:14] something so Jesus is the one or was the
[1:08:17] one that begins this creation of God a
[1:08:21] distinct creation started or began from
[1:08:25] Jesus
[1:08:26] onto this day apart from the first
[1:08:29] Creations Hallelujah we'll get it as we
[1:08:32] go on we are lay the background I know
[1:08:34] to lay the background of a building is
[1:08:35] not very easy hallelujah amen you move
[1:08:38] rocks you move sand you move this you
[1:08:40] move that people will come around say
[1:08:42] what are these people doing but you have
[1:08:44] the image of what you are building in
[1:08:46] your mind so we will get there by the
[1:08:48] grace of God so
[1:08:50] Jesus is the beginner or the author of
[1:08:54] this creation of God now and uh what is
[1:08:58] the author you say author means one that
[1:09:02] originates or create
[1:09:05] something one that a source praise the
[1:09:08] Lord am so he is the beginner all the
[1:09:11] author of the creation of God now we
[1:09:14] know for shorty that Jesus is God Amen
[1:09:17] we know Jesus is God right and the
[1:09:19] prophet said very God Amen Hallelujah he
[1:09:22] Tau it not robbery to be equal with God
[1:09:24] hallelujah
[1:09:26] and that was why the Jews pick up Stone
[1:09:27] to Stone him he said you being a maned
[1:09:30] to make yourself God what did he say
[1:09:32] when he said I am the son of the Living
[1:09:34] God and they knew the meaning of being a
[1:09:36] Son of God Son of God means God In the
[1:09:38] Flesh that's mesiah that's right they
[1:09:40] are Jews were Gentiles we're Idol
[1:09:42] worshippers so Jesus was God very God he
[1:09:46] is the creator amen Jesus himself is the
[1:09:49] creator so how come that he was created
[1:09:52] being the beginning of the creation of
[1:09:54] God no sir
[1:09:56] hallelujah what was created is the body
[1:09:58] called Jesus that the thing that was
[1:10:00] begotten by God mhm but it was not made
[1:10:04] of the of the Dust of this
[1:10:06] Earth if the body of Jesus was made of
[1:10:09] the Dust of the earth then is part of
[1:10:10] the Cur Earth then it can't redeem any
[1:10:13] of us amen amen you hear what I said
[1:10:16] amen if Jesus body was taken from this
[1:10:19] Earth as yours and mine were taken from
[1:10:21] this Earth then Jesus body is part of
[1:10:23] the cursed earth right then he will not
[1:10:26] be qualified to redeem any of us so he
[1:10:30] came from that Holy region where there
[1:10:32] was no curse God alight spoke the cell
[1:10:36] and the egg into existence and
[1:10:38] fertilization took place and he infused
[1:10:40] it into the home of Mary that is why
[1:10:43] Mary was a surrogate mother she was just
[1:10:45] an incubator Hallelujah it was an
[1:10:49] Immaculate
[1:10:50] Conception no human touch no human
[1:10:56] nothing no emotion no human emotion it
[1:11:00] was perfectly Immaculate holy to begin
[1:11:03] with that is why he could redeem us and
[1:11:06] that is why he could be the beginning of
[1:11:08] this new race and I'm grateful to God to
[1:11:11] be a member of that
[1:11:13] race praise God Amen so now he is the
[1:11:16] creator Jesus is the creator John 1 John
[1:11:20] 1:3 St John 13 says all things were made
[1:11:24] by him Hallelujah and without him was
[1:11:27] not anything made that was made that's
[1:11:29] right so how come then there him being
[1:11:32] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:11:33] mean that God created him no sir it
[1:11:36] doesn't mean that Hallelujah he is the
[1:11:39] one of whom it is said Genesis 1:1 oh
[1:11:41] thanks be to God in the beginning God
[1:11:44] created the heavens and the Earth it
[1:11:46] also it says in Exodus 20111 for in six
[1:11:49] days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the
[1:11:52] sea and all that in them is and rested
[1:11:55] the seventh day so there is no doubt
[1:11:58] that he is a
[1:12:00] Creator Jesus is the creator the logos
[1:12:03] the eternal spirit that indwell that
[1:12:05] Tabernacle was a Creator and the flesh
[1:12:09] bore the image of that which was
[1:12:11] inside right amen and sometimes Jesus
[1:12:14] said My Father which is in heaven then
[1:12:17] he confused trinitarian teachers how
[1:12:20] will his father be in heaven and he at
[1:12:22] the same time he is God praise the Lord
[1:12:25] the eternal spirit inside was God uh-huh
[1:12:29] and the body is the body is the mouth is
[1:12:33] the voice that is calling the eternal
[1:12:35] spirit inside father
[1:12:38] amen we understand that is the body
[1:12:42] Hallelujah because the body was begotten
[1:12:46] somebody made the body somebody created
[1:12:49] the body this my body came from somebody
[1:12:52] it came from a man and a woman and I can
[1:12:54] call them mother and Dad isn't it so
[1:12:57] somebody brought Jesus and he could call
[1:13:01] the person father somebody brought that
[1:13:04] body but who brought the eternal spirit
[1:13:07] inside who brought the logos that was
[1:13:09] inside that was God Almighty himself the
[1:13:12] great Pillar of Fire that say I am that
[1:13:13] I am right that led the children of
[1:13:16] Israel through the Wilderness amen
[1:13:18] thanks be to God for the prophet of the
[1:13:19] age that God used him to take our
[1:13:22] understanding back to the scriptures and
[1:13:24] our eyes has been anointed with eyes and
[1:13:26] we are seen by the grace of God Amen so
[1:13:30] now there is no doubt that he is the
[1:13:32] creator hallelujah amen he was the
[1:13:35] creator of a finished physical creation
[1:13:39] let's have that at the back of our mind
[1:13:42] the prophecy that Jesus was a creator of
[1:13:46] the finished physical creation let's
[1:13:50] have it at the back of our mind later we
[1:13:51] bring it to the
[1:13:53] front Jesus
[1:13:55] was a creator of what the finished can
[1:13:58] we say it together he was a creator of
[1:14:01] the finished physical
[1:14:05] creats he created the Mogan your tick
[1:14:08] wood right everything the irons the
[1:14:11] petroleum the Earth the moon the star
[1:14:14] the sun right your cheetah your Lions
[1:14:17] your sea your fishes your Dolphins
[1:14:20] mention them he created that Jesus was
[1:14:24] the creator
[1:14:25] Hallelujah they were they are his
[1:14:28] workmanship and the man that made the
[1:14:30] ppit did he condemn it no God will never
[1:14:33] condemn his creation come on church so
[1:14:37] God help us now having uh go this so
[1:14:42] surely we can see what this word mean
[1:14:45] now to have any other interpretation
[1:14:47] mean that God created go how could God
[1:14:48] be created when he himself is a Creator
[1:14:51] now um but now he is standing in the
[1:14:53] midst of the church he he as he stand
[1:14:56] there revealing who he is in the last
[1:14:58] age he calls himself the author of the
[1:15:01] creation of God and brother Bram says
[1:15:04] this is another
[1:15:06] creation distinct from the first
[1:15:09] Creations distinct from the physical
[1:15:12] Creations this is another creation we
[1:15:14] are talking about God's
[1:15:16] workmanship now so this is another
[1:15:18] creation this has to do with who with
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:22] church this creation has to do with the
[1:15:25] church Hallelujah this creation has to
[1:15:28] do with the church remember the devil
[1:15:31] spoils God's work in the
[1:15:34] beginning and God is
[1:15:36] radical say God is radical not a radical
[1:15:41] radical and a radical is an
[1:15:44] accomplisher a radical does not start to
[1:15:47] do anything and stop it unaccomplished
[1:15:50] he must finish it and that is God and
[1:15:53] from the beginning God determined to
[1:15:55] have a church without spot without
[1:15:57] wrinkle so nobody can spot his work when
[1:16:01] the devil seems to M his work God went
[1:16:03] back to work again to make sure that he
[1:16:05] bring that church to the position that
[1:16:08] he meant it to be from the beginning
[1:16:12] thanks be to God so as it stands H this
[1:16:15] is another creation this has to do with
[1:16:17] the church this is a special designation
[1:16:19] of himself so the beginning of the
[1:16:21] creation of God is a special designation
[1:16:23] of Jesus
[1:16:25] it's a special
[1:16:27] designation is the beginning of the
[1:16:29] creation of God now I will jump he is
[1:16:31] the creator of that church the Heavenly
[1:16:34] bridegroom created his own bride at the
[1:16:36] spirit of God he came down and created
[1:16:38] in the Virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:16:41] the body was born I jump this now now
[1:16:46] Hallelujah we it was not enough for the
[1:16:49] Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a
[1:16:51] human o Supply by Mary no sir
[1:16:55] Jesus was not a single cell of Maries
[1:16:59] over or egg
[1:17:02] never it will be
[1:17:04] imperfect to bring us to Redemption we
[1:17:08] all born in sin shaped in iniquities we
[1:17:12] come to the world speaking lies all of
[1:17:16] us is the message of God through the
[1:17:18] blood of the Lord Jesus that redeemed us
[1:17:21] right and God knew that redeeming nobody
[1:17:25] blood alone is not enough he need to
[1:17:28] keep a force in us which is the holy
[1:17:30] spirit right to keep us constantly on
[1:17:33] check to keep us constantly on check if
[1:17:36] he just redeem us and leave us like that
[1:17:38] we will go back right but he put the
[1:17:41] holy spirit inside Hallelujah to put our
[1:17:45] body under subjection to The Obedience
[1:17:48] of the scriptures every step of our of
[1:17:50] our life even though we go back
[1:17:53] Hallelujah Redemption by Redemption by
[1:17:56] the blood mhm so now of him it was said
[1:18:01] l a body has th father prepared for me
[1:18:03] not God not Mary provided that body
[1:18:07] let's go on now Mary was a human
[1:18:10] incubator and she carried her holy child
[1:18:12] and brought him to birth it was a God
[1:18:15] man he was the son of God he was of the
[1:18:19] new
[1:18:20] creation thanks be to God Amen was Jesus
[1:18:24] born the way were born no was Jesus born
[1:18:27] the way we are born no no sir he wasn't
[1:18:30] born the way we are so he is of that new
[1:18:32] creation and that's so made him to be
[1:18:35] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:18:38] remember Adam amen procreation was not
[1:18:43] to be by
[1:18:44] sex we are believers of the message
[1:18:47] procreation was not to be by sex that
[1:18:50] was not God desire at the beginning but
[1:18:52] the devil came to break God's program
[1:18:54] right and she sold the article to the
[1:18:56] woman and the woman bought it amen and
[1:18:59] when the husband came back amen the wife
[1:19:02] sold the same article you understand
[1:19:04] what I'm talking about sold the same
[1:19:06] gave the same proposition to Adam and
[1:19:09] Adam
[1:19:10] saw the I don't know you know he saw the
[1:19:13] troubles and the headaches and the
[1:19:15] anguish and the problems that were
[1:19:18] attend to his progeny on Earth but he
[1:19:22] could not do a away with a wife he sold
[1:19:25] L to death and sin and all kinds of
[1:19:28] mysteries in life in order to have his
[1:19:31] wife which you know is Christ in
[1:19:33] time amen it's Christ in time so he so L
[1:19:38] to that Adam was supposed to give bir to
[1:19:41] another Son of God who was Adam
[1:19:44] Church who was Adam he was a Son of God
[1:19:48] am come on a Son of God supposed to give
[1:19:51] bir to another Son of God and not Son of
[1:19:53] God supposed to prod another Son of God
[1:19:55] but Adam could not produce another Son
[1:19:57] of God come on and that was God's
[1:20:01] concept from the
[1:20:03] beginning and now why Jesus had to come
[1:20:06] the way Jesus came was the way Abel
[1:20:08] supposed to have come to the world Amen
[1:20:11] but they bypassed that
[1:20:13] concept amen they bypassed that concept
[1:20:17] but God was determined to have his
[1:20:19] church God was determined to have his
[1:20:21] generation God was determined to have
[1:20:23] that new creation
[1:20:25] amen hallelujah so here in the New
[1:20:28] Testament he came through the womb of a
[1:20:30] woman and he had that spoken word
[1:20:33] seed Hallelujah that the Bible called
[1:20:36] the second
[1:20:37] Adam why was Seth not the second Adam
[1:20:41] why was Noah not the another Adam why
[1:20:44] was uh Canaan Abraham Isaac why were
[1:20:48] they not Adam no sir because Adam gave
[1:20:53] bir to his own image
[1:20:55] hallelujah amen God created man in his
[1:20:58] own image Adam was in the image of God
[1:21:01] but Abel was in the image of Adam and
[1:21:04] that is not qualified to inherit the
[1:21:05] kingdom of God a man born by
[1:21:09] man is not worthy to be in heaven that's
[1:21:12] why something had to take place to
[1:21:14] correct his hybridization to correct his
[1:21:17] hrid birth something had to take place
[1:21:20] why was it that when they die in the Old
[1:21:22] Testament they could not go to the
[1:21:23] presence of God the Bloods of bulls and
[1:21:26] good was not was not strong enough
[1:21:28] Hallelujah to appease the sinful man to
[1:21:32] to know to to to pave the way for mine
[1:21:35] before
[1:21:36] God until Jesus Christ had to come that
[1:21:40] Holy Blood Hallelujah a there was
[1:21:43] nothing present that was why God said
[1:21:45] kill a lamb to atoned for your sin but
[1:21:49] that was weak until Jesus blood was shed
[1:21:52] praise God amen amen now men and God met
[1:21:56] and joined he was the first of this new
[1:22:00] I'm feeling good in my heart now and I I
[1:22:02] feel we should Fellowship together so
[1:22:04] Jesus was the first of this new race who
[1:22:07] was born like he was born who was born
[1:22:10] like Jesus was born nobody Hallelujah
[1:22:13] but if you are filled with the Holy
[1:22:15] Spirit you were born like Jesus was
[1:22:17] born come
[1:22:19] on now
[1:22:21] we now not the physical man and God met
[1:22:25] in join he was the first of this new
[1:22:27] race he is the head of this new race H
[1:22:30] Allelujah Colossians 11:18 say and he is
[1:22:33] the head of the body the church who is
[1:22:35] the beginning the first born from the
[1:22:37] dead that in all things he might have
[1:22:39] the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 says
[1:22:43] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:22:45] a new
[1:22:46] creation is that not the Bible if you
[1:22:49] are in Christ you are a new creation
[1:22:52] that's the creation we are talking about
[1:22:54] all things all things have become
[1:22:58] new used to smoke you don't smoke
[1:23:02] anymore you even hate to perceive
[1:23:05] cigarette odor all things have become
[1:23:08] new amen you have your wife at home and
[1:23:10] you have 10 other women outside you
[1:23:12] can't live like that anymore come on
[1:23:15] Church you love the world you don't love
[1:23:18] the world anymore all things have become
[1:23:21] new the prop say a brand new unit in an
[1:23:24] old temp
[1:23:25] is see the same Brother Joseph is it the
[1:23:27] same brother Steve is it the same
[1:23:29] brother one but the characters are
[1:23:32] changed Hallelujah said things are
[1:23:35] different now something happened to me
[1:23:38] when I give my life to
[1:23:43] Jesus now this new creation is not the
[1:23:48] old I hope I'm not shouting amen I just
[1:23:51] have one hour with you I will hand you
[1:23:53] over to your pastor this is my own style
[1:23:56] God bless you
[1:23:58] hallelujah amen so you bear with
[1:24:01] me amen this new creation is not the old
[1:24:05] creation made over it's not a patch
[1:24:09] up or it could be it could not be called
[1:24:12] New Creation I we understand the church
[1:24:16] thus far all of us were to have come to
[1:24:19] the world the way Adam came to the world
[1:24:21] the way Jesus came to the world rather
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:25] of course God gave adam a wife what was
[1:24:28] the wife for for
[1:24:30] procreation but Adam could not wait the
[1:24:32] woman could not wait the devil got ahead
[1:24:34] of
[1:24:36] God and when Jesus no church Adam did
[1:24:40] not learn to believe
[1:24:42] God Jesus did not learn to believe God
[1:24:46] it's me and you that learn to believe
[1:24:48] God come on church as Adam woke up he
[1:24:51] realized himself a human being he woke
[1:24:54] with Faith No Doubt
[1:24:58] anywhere right Adam did not believe that
[1:25:01] if you speak he will not come to pass he
[1:25:03] was not part of him and when Jesus woke
[1:25:07] up he did not wake up to theow himself a
[1:25:09] human being a man with
[1:25:12] doubt doubting God he was not part of
[1:25:15] him it's me and you that byass all that
[1:25:20] then we had to learn how to believe God
[1:25:22] we had to learn how to have faith we had
[1:25:25] to learn how to go to church it was
[1:25:27] automatic for Adam it was automatic for
[1:25:30] for for for for Jesus right right and
[1:25:33] look at it when the angel Gabriel came
[1:25:35] from Heaven to give the announcement to
[1:25:38] John I mean to Zariah in the temple he
[1:25:42] said your father I mean your wife will
[1:25:44] conceive and have a son right yeah he
[1:25:48] said uh what was her name Elizabeth was
[1:25:50] about 80 years
[1:25:51] old and Zachariah the pr the servant of
[1:25:55] God the pastor the prophet call it
[1:25:58] whatever you want to call it was he able
[1:26:00] to take that miraculous message
[1:26:03] Zachariah in the temple doubted
[1:26:06] it right that was when Angel Gabriel
[1:26:10] introduced himself because he was not
[1:26:12] used to doubting God in the place that
[1:26:15] he came
[1:26:17] from forever oh lord your word is
[1:26:20] settled in heaven once God speak we
[1:26:24] break came from it is here and a no
[1:26:27] doubt but he was a preacher in the
[1:26:29] temple when he told him old woman he's
[1:26:32] going to conceive I have a child he
[1:26:34] doubted it and Gabriel told him don't
[1:26:37] you know who he's talking to I'm Gabriel
[1:26:39] I come from the presence of God I'm
[1:26:42] telling you sometime you are doubting it
[1:26:44] he say you be dumb until the baby is
[1:26:46] born
[1:26:48] hallelujah amen but give the word to
[1:26:52] Jesus he will never doubt it doubt was
[1:26:54] not in his
[1:26:55] soul Hallelujah but we were born without
[1:26:59] adamic nature which is doubt to begin
[1:27:02] with which is sin to begin with which is
[1:27:05] death to begin with so we must come
[1:27:09] Hallelujah something must happen to us
[1:27:11] that will take us back Amen to that new
[1:27:15] creation the creation that believe God
[1:27:18] the creation that don't doubt God the
[1:27:20] creation that believe the supernatural
[1:27:22] the creation that believe in signs
[1:27:24] wonders the creation that believe in the
[1:27:26] mystery of the Bible the creation that
[1:27:28] can take the a the prophet in this
[1:27:30] generation that's what we are talking
[1:27:32] about you can't believe the Mery by your
[1:27:34] flesh and blood we can't learn it in
[1:27:37] University it must be given to you by
[1:27:39] divine revelation and is by is by
[1:27:42] predestination you must be in the
[1:27:44] program of
[1:27:45] God right because something must be
[1:27:48] inside to make you believe God in the
[1:27:51] absence of that you will not be able to
[1:27:54] look friends the message may be simple
[1:27:56] to you but it's the most difficult thing
[1:27:59] on earth to be
[1:28:02] believed you hear what I said I said the
[1:28:05] message may be simple to you because God
[1:28:08] had revealed it to you but I said is the
[1:28:10] most difficult thing on earth to be
[1:28:15] believed okay let's march on now God
[1:28:18] bless you so
[1:28:21] now this is exactly what he says it is
[1:28:23] New Creation
[1:28:24] it is another creation distinct from the
[1:28:27] old
[1:28:29] one is another creation distinct from
[1:28:32] the old one no longer is it dealing by
[1:28:34] way of the flesh amen Jesus God is no
[1:28:38] more dealing by way of the flesh that
[1:28:40] was how he dealt with Israel he chose
[1:28:42] Abraham and of Abraham issue Through The
[1:28:44] Godly Isaac line but now out of every
[1:28:47] Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed
[1:28:51] a new creation he is the first of that
[1:28:54] creation Hallelujah he is the first of
[1:28:58] Jesus is the first of that creation and
[1:29:01] that's why you saw him the second other
[1:29:03] he could walk upon the sea amen
[1:29:06] hallelujah he could walk upon the Sea
[1:29:09] and the one that was not of that order
[1:29:12] of that new creation order was who was
[1:29:15] brother
[1:29:16] Peter you understand the church and when
[1:29:20] Peter saw Jesus on the water he was even
[1:29:22] in doubt because he he looked spooky he
[1:29:25] looked like a spirit he looked like a
[1:29:27] masquerade and he said Lord if that be
[1:29:30] you what did he say be me to come and
[1:29:34] Jesus say c o m e come by th Spoken Word
[1:29:40] by the power of the word and he had
[1:29:43] faith in it he started working to upon
[1:29:45] the water that was a supernatural act
[1:29:48] amen it wasn't natural a mortal man to
[1:29:51] be walking on the
[1:29:52] Water right
[1:29:54] Hallelujah that is why you man don't
[1:29:56] swim like this man swim this way because
[1:30:00] under your foot you know it exer more
[1:30:02] more pressure than when you lie down
[1:30:04] upon it are we in church and when he saw
[1:30:09] the stor blly what did Peter do doubt
[1:30:14] started enterry Jesus saw that same
[1:30:17] storm but it did not perturb him it
[1:30:20] didn't disturb him because he was of
[1:30:22] that new creation amen he the beginning
[1:30:24] of that new creation amen and all
[1:30:26] element of the earth must be subject to
[1:30:29] him right Jesus didn't need to pray to
[1:30:34] say peace be
[1:30:36] still M everything are subject to Christ
[1:30:40] amen but God made all things to be
[1:30:42] subject to us through prayers
[1:30:45] yes right so the man that was born by
[1:30:48] flesh the man that was not of that new
[1:30:51] creation Hallelujah he started
[1:30:54] thinkinking but the one that was of that
[1:30:56] new creation he was walking upon the
[1:30:58] water and while Peter was going down
[1:31:00] what did he do he held him by the hand
[1:31:03] thanks be to God but on the day of
[1:31:06] Pentecost on the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:31:09] had an
[1:31:10] entrance into that
[1:31:12] family now why he could walk and his
[1:31:15] Shadows their Shadows was Healing The
[1:31:18] Sick and The Afflicted they could take
[1:31:20] handkerchief and apron from their body
[1:31:23] and the disease were delivered because
[1:31:25] they of that new
[1:31:27] creation let's move on now let's leave
