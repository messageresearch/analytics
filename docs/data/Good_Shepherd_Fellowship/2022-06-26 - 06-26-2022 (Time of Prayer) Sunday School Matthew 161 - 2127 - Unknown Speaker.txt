========================================
[Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Laughter] [Music] desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread which when jesus perceived he said unto them oh ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets he took up neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets he took up how is it that you do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that you should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees then understood they how that he bad them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man ham and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savorist not the things that be of god but those that be of men then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and was sore afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them and the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic and so vexed for oft times he falleth into the fire and often to the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed he shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry and when they will come to capernaum they that receive tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute he said yes and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what think is thou simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangers peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him then are the children free notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast and hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth i shall find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drowned in the depth of the sea woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hellfire take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven for the son of man is come to save that which was lost how seeky if a man have a hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray does he not leave the 90 and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which has gone astray and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the nineteenth nine which went not astray even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if you neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pants and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that bowelist and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came untold unto their lord all that was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me should hast not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was roth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judea beyond jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mother's womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it then with there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed thence and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man set unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet jesus said unto him if i will be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and everyone that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundred-fold and shall inherit everlasting life but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard and when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye hear all the day idle they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive so when even was come the lord of the vineyard set unto his steward call the laborers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee is it not lawful for me to do what i will with my own is thine i evil because i am good so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests sent unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on my right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with a baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he saith unto them he shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him and behold two blind men sitting by the wayside when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to beth fiji unto the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straight where you shall find an ass tied and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and occult the foal of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the cult and put on them their clothes and they set him there on and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and straw them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased and said unto him hearst thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yay have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever and presently the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not he shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if he shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i and likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all whole john is a prophet and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell [Music] you
