the lord tonight amen it's really really good to see everyone tonight good to see everybody in the house of the lord let's turn if you've got your bible to hebrews chapter one and i'd like to pick up verses six and 7 if i could hebrews 1 verses 6 and 7. i want to speak to you this evening on a ministry of angels a ministry of angels hebrews 1 6 and seven and again when he bringeth in the first begotten end to the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him now the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire let's read that one more time and the angels of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire let me read to you now of christ the mystery brother the bible said so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels let's pray together well your heads are bowed this evening if you'd just like to be remembered in prayer would you just lift your hand to the lord take your knee right there before you got my hand up here with you as well heavenly father what a privilege lord it is to come before your presence lord as we have already enjoyed the august presence of the holy spirit it is a benefit to us as your children to be connected by the holy ghost into this heavenly place and lord as we are entering into the very sacred courts of the almighty we come with thanksgiving and praise we come with our token before us and we come lord boldly before thy throne as sons and daughters lord jesus we're asking that the holy spirit will come tonight and take his word lord you see every need that is represented amongst this body whether to be sicknesses or depressions or some situation in their finances or emotions or marriage or life or whatever circumstances may have befallen them lord thou alone has the answer for the need even tonight if it's just for the edification the perfecting of the saints we're praying that you will come by thy word and speak to us o god our father by the things that we'll read and study and understand tonight i pray that you'll anoint me lord that i might get myself completely out of the way that you might use me as a vessel that i could be used as a vessel of honor for thy glory and that i might be a benefit to the people of god and lord as we open up these weekend of services lord with this first night of great worship we already feel a powerful presence in this place lord we know the saints of god have prepared themselves they're ready lord i'm it ready tonight the word is that ready and the holy spirit is that ready and the angels of the lord aren't ready tonight at their post of duty and as we look into this great subject lord i pray that the holy spirit will let us draw near to that realm as it draws near to us granted lord as we commit it to you in the name of jesus christ both speaker and listener in jesus name amen and amen all the saints said amen you may be seated may the lord bless you real good i sure appreciate the lord tonight i appreciate all the great things that the lord has done for us and being a christian is a wonderful privilege it's something that we truly believe is called and ordained of the lord and we don't certainly don't serve god just because we decide to we don't serve god because we desire to be a better person or just more moral or deeper in our ethics but we serve the lord because he chose us before the foundation of the world and one thing is evidently clear and perfectly clear as the children of god is that you couldn't have chose yourself and there is no choosing for you in any way whatsoever as a matter of fact whenever you do your choosing you would have chosen the wrong thing but because the lord is a motivator and because the lord is a leader and because the lord is a person of inspiration it is true that we may have to make our choice but he prodded us along until we got to the right places to make the right choices and you see his whole economy is based upon his desire the thing that he wanted in the very beginning before the foundation of the world and if you could say in a way that god's a little bit self-centered in respect that he wants it his way and if you're the creator and uh you just say for example you know you're like when we were kids we would have games that we would play you know if you was the maker of the rules you were the one that called the rules of the game amen and since he's the creator he can be self-centered if he chose if he chooses to be and he can make the rules and we got to play his program and not the other way around so we know that the lord is not a selfish person but he wants what he wants and he created everything for it to be in his program and in his line of being children of god and all of this coming together as it has here we are 6 000 years later after the creation of man and god is still bringing together his entire purpose his entire plan and everything he desired from the foundation of the world and it's just my job to fall in line with what he wants and so while we pray father thy will be done not my own be done because if i'm just clay and i'm just here as a product of his own will and his own mind and his own creation i have no thought coming about my next steps the next five minutes the next breath i take in him i move and live and have my being and i walk in him talk in him act in him function in him he is the reason that i am what i am today so i'm thankful that the lord is in control of all things aren't you and being that god has a whole plan laid out a whole program laid out we understand that the program of god began with the creation of these angels and even the apostle paul who we believe the writer of the book of hebrews was of course the uh most people in scholars and things would say that oh somebody else wrote the book but when we read hebrews brother branham said it was as close to all of the other writings of paul as we could get and when you look at this particular portion of scripture here you'll notice that he's not referring when it says the begotten the first begotten into the world is not necessarily referring to just simply the lord jesus but remember brother branham tells us in questions answers on the genesis in 53 he said that the first real begotten son of god was the logos or that pillar of fire that proceeded out of god so that was the first as we'd say son of god then we know from melchizedek brother branham said that he creates himself a body to live in and that body was a celestial body not a terrestrial body of course but theophany and then by becoming melchizedek he was forming himself towards flesh until eventually he became jesus christ but then we know that the creation of god did not begin on the earth either we know that sin did not begin on the earth we know that the first battle that took place amongst good and evil did not take place here but it took place in heaven where the stars of god were satan desired to ascend himself above the stars of god and brother brahm tells us in god of this evil age that satan actually preached to the angels that were in heaven he had a desire of his own and we know that from isaiah when he tells us that uh the five wills as he said i will this and i will that and i will the other and i'll be like god and i'll be like the most high and i'll have my own kingdom i'll have my own subjects and what more so satan had his own plan he had his own agenda and god created him in such a way that he could be just that because every angel has free moral agency they were created in a manner that they can choose to stay with the lord or they can step away from god but the difference between an angel of the lord and you and i is there is no redemption for an angel whatsoever once an angel of the lord steps away from the economy of god there is found no place more no more in heaven so we understand even from the book of jude that angels had real estate in heaven they had a position they had a place that god had given them they were created with a certain power with a certain influence with a certain ability and yet because they listened to the devil's lie all of that they were when they were kicked out of heaven all of that went with them when they became demons so let's say between 1 and 10 using numbers if an angel was created as a seven when he became a demon he's still a seven if he was created an eight or a nine or a ten or whatever he was he never lost one ounce of his power but he did lose his real estate lost his position in heaven now don't forget that the angels of the lord were the very first ones to bring in worship when we speak about the worshipping of jesus christ and the worshipping of the saints of god you realize we were not the first ones to say hallelujah and praise the lord and all those words that the angels of god were created that they would worship almighty god as a matter of fact i was not the first one that brought him into the position of being called god god as an object of worship never came into his position as god until these angels that were created spoken by their hallelujahs and praise the lord put him in that rightful place of course i could go back a little bit further right here but i'd mess up the rest of the sermon if i cheated amen and tell you that i really was the reason why the angels were there in the first place but let's just pretend i didn't say that okay now i want you to notice how that when paul begins to outline this in these two verses notice he said that when the first begotten came into the world that the angels of god began to worship him and then these angels of the lord were also created remembered to be ministering spirits sent from god to minister to who the saints of god to minister to the body of jesus christ which would come along many many years later we don't know exactly maybe how long it was before satan done what he done whether there was even time considered during that time period could have been millions and millions and millions of years for all we know but ever what the time period might have been god waited and waited and waited and waited until satan came to the place lucifer where he desired a kingdom greater than that of michael or the lord jesus christ or almighty god and then once he made that shift within himself let's remember when the prophet isaiah picks him up he's not catching what is what what lucifer was saying from his mouth go back and read it he said in his heart he was saying i will be this and i will be this brother the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart no doubt he hid that from every one of them angels he hid that from every one of that angelic community but here's this prophet all these hundreds of years later going right back up there into that angelic community and revealing what was hiding inside the devil's heart goes to prove when you see hypocrites in church they're not the original when you see people playing two-face in church they're not the original they got that from somebody amen the devil was the first one to come online as a christian but yet in his heart not living right come on praise the lord hey listen people don't have to be a ranked sinner doesn't mean you're out there laying in a gut or someone another with a beer bottle in your hand to be a ranked sinner does not mean that you're a drug addict whoa come on preach to me you know the most foul center on the face of the planet a pretender somebody that pretends to be a child of god and yet nothing in their heart to back it up somebody that pretends to love the lord but yet nothing stands out there as a reality amen that's the worst person you could ever deal with bible called it perilous times or dangerous times that men would be lovers of their own self and incontinent and fierce and all of that is wrapped up in the heart but yet all the veil on the outside having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof don't forget people that always put on sheep's clothing if they're not really sheep look for a zipper praise the lord somebody amen search for the zipper that's right now let's look for just a moment and angels can actually take on human forms and share human characteristics if you like to see that in the bible genesis chapter 19 verse 1 and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them bowing himself to the ground in his face toward the ground now we know when lot meets these two angels that he doesn't have abraham's revelation uncle abraham saw three called them one he saw two column two amen and and the revelation of it is simply put that as a child of the living god abraham understood that it was almighty god wrapped in flesh amen he knew it i don't care what would have come along that had websites in that day trying to convince him different he knew it that's what i say about a bunch of this outfit out here that carries on about all the websites and all the defectors and all what they say against this message let me tell you something brother sister and let me speak to every young person and every old person every middle-aged person in this church and those that will hear my voice on this internet if you are convinced that you have met jesus christ there's not enough websites there's not enough preachers there's not enough hypocrites there's not enough devils out of hell to stop you from believing this last day truth [Applause] i don't care what their name is or how convincing they are nobody can run you off if you know what you know yes sir you forgive me this may sound a little racially inclined i don't mean it that way i'm a white man i know i am i don't care how many websites come along and tell me i ain't i look in the mirror and see different i've had the experience i know where my birth was i know who my parents were praise the lord come on amen i know exactly amen my origins the same thing from comes from this message amen when i look down at what brother branham says and they're saying all these different things about the prophet of god i understand that the revelation that come from this man right here lined up with every scripture in the [Music] i bible you one thing the critics wouldn't want to stand before him if he was living today i promise you that now notice and paul you say well that was old testament sure brother brown talked about how that the picked up the dust of their one and said michael stepped in and gabriel stepped in they come down there and appeared to lot and lot said my lords he was a heathen so he believed more than one god that's what heathens believe christians don't believe in more than one god they believe in one god he is not a trinity and he is not a trinity praise the lord well i know you live in the twin cities but god ain't twin amen that's exactly right now i want you to notice that in hebrews chapter 13 verse 2 paul picks up this very same concept and brings it over into the new testament oh you say that was old testament yes but watch what he said be not forgetful to entertain strangers oh praise the lord for thereby some have entertained angels unaware that doesn't mean they're going around looking for them i guarantee you one thing we walked outside this church tonight saw a big ufo make a big spin and go i mean it'd be on facebook twitter twitch you name them you'd be twitching all right it would be everywhere oh i saw a ufo unidentified flying object did you ever stop to think that some of them visitors that come into the church them unidentified flying visitors it might have been the holy spirit checking your attitude to see how you treat visitors see how you treat those that aren't exactly like you [Music] you know them non-message people that we look down on so much well they don't believe the message at one time i could have said that about you and me sure even though i was raised in it i didn't believe it not to the holy spirit revealed to me riveted to him i didn't you didn't either don't look at me that way but the holy spirit could appear to you and i we've all heard the stories about how somebody'd be out maybe they'd be out of gas in the middle of nowhere all of a sudden here comes a man with a gas tank what is that angels unawares not looking for it not searching for it not trying to get cameras and little white balls dancing around and balls of light and things like that no unawares their attitude is such that an angel of the lord could appear to them and they're living their everyday normal christian life and an angel could feel comfortable being entertained by them praise god and hallelujah realize this is the reason why brother venom said that if we live the kind of lives that we should we'd be visited by angels more often praise the lord but you can't you listen they're from heaven they cannot be in a heavenly atmosphere then come down to hell amen people fussing and fighting and arguing and carrying on throwing things come on message church oh i know some of you some of you tonight you think you're those holy angels i'm preaching about you're not you're just as sinful as me you get aggravated just like me words amen in case you forgot amen amen that's right that's right but they have to have an atmosphere a certain atmosphere to come into it praise the lord watch here again in psalm chapter 8 verse 5 speaking about the lord jesus for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor now i want you to notice the way that the arrangements of this was now notice that jesus then did not come into the imagery of an angel meaning that there was something about him that was different now remember the angels of the lord had never smoked never cursed never drank never committed adultery never done any kind of sinful act they were completely holy in body action behavior and everything perfect but an angel cannot propagate its race an angel has no tree of knowledge of good and evil to get married and produce kids so what was it about jesus that was different he was created after the tree of knowledge of good and evil and in the likeness of sinful flesh even though he himself was no part of the tree of knowledge of good and evil he was made in the same fashion as that oh you say well what was the purpose of it oh i i hope you're ready for this now watch when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul you are perfect [Music] you're no longer a sinner we sing them songs and we mean the best when we sing them i'm an old sinner saved by grace when i get born again i am no longer a sinner come on preach to me when i receive the holy ghost i am no longer a sinner my life has been changed completely i'm a saint full of the holy ghost born again i am just as sinless if i've got the holy ghost as jesus was sinless what is about me that's different then what is it about me that's not so sinless that anybody know what i'm talking about your flesh you versus you that's the great fight of the day you versus you oh you thank you and you you oh i tell i'm i believe the message uh-huh what part of you believes the message as i guarantee if it wasn't for the flesh that you pack around you your soul might say amen to every word of god but don't you dare try to pull it over on me that your flesh believes at all it don't oh you say well that flesh is me you need a better revelation of who you are this is just the body that packs you around praise the lord this is only the veil that packs the real me around i am not the sum of my genetic creation even the bible talked about 6 000 years of sin from the fathers all the way down into me can you imagine all of that sin all of that wrong all of those races and cultures back there in my history that we're displeasing to the lord and all of that mess is poured down right in here brother you talk about the reason this bride's going to be an overcomer in the last day it's because she's not just going to overcome just this generation but she's going to overcome every generational curse that followed her all the way down from the beginning of time [Applause] i don't have to just overcome my temper i don't just have to overcome my impatience i've got to overcome my great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great i got to go plumb back to adam and eve and the serpent and i've got to overcome all that too no wonder we need the holy ghost come on somebody i said no wonder we need the holy ghost you think you're going to do that on your own esteem i'll study the method i'll get smart enough let me just explain something to you about warfare this little fellow that we're talking about the devil he is the one that inspired napoleon he is the one that inspired hitler hitler mussolini stalin eichmann anybody ever heard of a little fellow that conquered the whole world in his time huh you ever heard of the great warriors and the conquerors of time anybody ever heard of the pharaoh where to get his inspiration from to rule the world and you think with your little canary brain that you're smart enough cause you got a computer an ipad and you can pull up a bunch of quotes that you're gonna whip him you better have the holy ghost you better be born again because you are no match for the smartness of satan he's been at this a whole lot longer than your eye you've heard the expression can beat you with one arm tied behind his back that's the kind of cro the kind of creature kind of foe you're talking about you think you know the word of god you might have read it he was standing there when it was spoken you can go back into history and you could pull up where adam said this and where that one said that who was it standing in the garden of eden when he said that seed will bruise his head and you'll bruise his heel he wasn't reading that he was hearing it out of the mouth of god first hand and yet we think somehow another because we belong to a message church come on young people you better listen to brother ben all you think because i was born on that message pew i was too we ain't no match we ain't no match we need the holy ghost because listen to me this is a powerful angel this is a powerful demon this being was created to be everything that god was except for a creator not only is he strong but he's smart he's powerful and he's got the world by the tale you know all of this stuff you hate around the world today satan is loving it more every day because brother mama told us this is his eating out here around here it'd be no different for you and i if we was walking through the actual garden of eden and we'd see the great birds of paradise and we'd see all of the beauty of eden we said oh oh you know how it is when you own them vacations and you're in them tropical places and oh just how beautiful it is that's the way the devil feels every time a baby is aborted every time a church brings more deception on and brings more people in to church membership rather than a new birth experience that's how the devil feels every time there's more rioting and there's more hating and there's more killing he looks at that the same as you and i would look at a garden oasis he loves it because everything he sees around him he knows i am in control don't think for a second he ain't that's the reason why when you see people in the church become isolated all of a sudden they go from being on the front row as we would say on fire as we would say and in a moment's time sometimes a few months time just like that they're gone don't you understand the plan that he laid for them was a whole lot more deeper and intense and more serious than the plan you had laid for yourself that's why brother we better throw ourselves on the mercy of the lord jesus and every day of our life we better wake up in the morning with our hands raised in there god i need you i need you god because at this very moment i don't know what demon is planning was i don't know what kind of conferences have been going on down in hell what kind of traps may be led for me down the road i need the holy ghost to give me the leadership i need to overcome amen this is why we overcome by the blood of the lamb it is our protective barrier that keeps us from the fro from satan ever getting inside because the only way he can get in is to become our brother right notice jesus then was created like you and i now listen to this don't get offended now but brother madam said he was tempted by sex tempted by drugs as we would say tempted by worldly things he was tempted in every way that a man or a woman could experience the bible talked about the three avenues that it was tempted by lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and the pride of life jesus experienced the sting of pride he experienced the sting of jealousy of hatred of emulation emulation strife wrath heresy all of those things that we read about in the bible jesus understood them well and because he was created remember joseph was not his father mary was not his mother not one cell of jesus christ had human blood in it if you would have tested the dna of the blood of the lord jesus you couldn't have found a match anywhere on the planet because the dna of the lord jesus christ would have had no father it would have had no matching mother because god was his father glory and god was his mother he was created he was virgin born if there would have even been one cell of natural creation in him it would not have been the son of god begotten by the creative hand of god absolutely was a virgin-born son of god made lower let me think to ourselves why does that help us him becoming flesh why does that mean anything to us because jesus knew that the process would be such we would come to the world in the physical later we would come to us he tells us who's this melchizedek later we would come to the knowledge of the spiritual but we come natural first then the spiritual would follow that natural then from that spiritual would bring a re-creation or a reforming or a renovation of the natural so what good would it do me to have the baptism of the holy ghost in my soul sealed to the day of my redemption i could never go to hell i could never get old i could never age or die in this soul time does not exist in that realm so if you can take your finger and point it to the time you saw me do something wrong in my soul there is no time there's nothing to point to [Laughter] [Applause] glory to god there is nothing that you could put your finger on the day the time the hour the moment it does not exist in my soul [Applause] but in this i still carry the marks of the moment the day the time the hour i still carry it some of you brothers that might have been in the world and you got tattoos on your body the day you got the holy ghost some tattoo's still there some of you girls maybe got ear piercings or maybe running into the world or some kind of thing of course i don't i don't know i'm just saying as an example but when you've got the holy ghost the earpiece is still there them holes in your ears they're still there so what good does it do me to have the holy ghost of my soul and still identify with the tree of knowledge of good and evil i know you're probably thinking what in the world does this have to do with angels just hang on just hang on we almost there don't get impatient now settle down now watch then in matthew chapter 22 verse 30 watch what jesus says about the believer for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given or in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven now that doesn't mean that all of a sudden i'm when i get my body changed i'm going to sprout wings and fly i'm not going to have twain over my face twain over my feet twain on my back so how in the world am i going to be like the angels in heaven well remember the angels in heaven never smoked never drank never cursed never lied never done nothing but been a worshiper of god when my body is changed all right now listen close when you were born off the tree of knowledge and good and evil in your very cells you carry the identity of sin before you let me give you an example out of science and and research now this is peer reviewed research this is authentic doctor research this is not something i got out of wikipedia but they proved when it took a a man and a woman who were high school sweethearts they wanted to run an experiment to see if they could carry the actual dna of the other person that them high school sweethearts had kissed when they were going to high school together and dating 40 years after their first kiss had been shared they swabbed her mouth swabbed his mouth and found each other's dna still in their mouth you understand this is why brother adam said your first kiss be at the altar what's about you old people you should have been hollering a man at least huh brother brahma had a little bit more common sense than what people give him credit for what he said is potentially adultery because themselves are crossing over it proves that somehow even in my birth my natural first birth i carry in my body the identity of everything that come before me oh glory to god hang on i'm coming to something because i'm born off the tree of knowledge of good and evil i've got if i've got my dad's nose and i do if i've got my mama's eyes and that big round garrett face then don't i also have their temper their impatience don't i also carry with me all those sinful type things that come down through these genetics and how did it come to us through the sexual reproduction program off the tree of knowledge of good and evil but when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time he said those women women women came to him and hugged him glory to god he said it wasn't like it would be here on earth there was no sensation glory to god why because all of that will be taken away from you there will be no reproductive organs in your body in heaven you say well what's that got to do with anything it is the identity of all that you have carried in your flesh all these years and so when jesus changes our body he said i'll be made just like the angels as though i never smoked never cursed never lied amen it'll be as though none of that ever took place how could i be truly justified and carry my tattoos to heaven how can i be genuinely justified and carry ear piercings to heaven the very marks in my body would prove that i was a sinner but when we stand there on that day brother drunks prostitutes and everything else not only will he wipe away the tears or the memory of where we come from but he will so change our body until we won't even resemble how we were born we won't even look in that same manner as what we looked as a circle he'll change us completely until we'll be like the angels again watch this luke 20 and verse 36 neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god amen being the children of the resurrection isn't that what we're talking and focusing on this weekend isn't that what easter is all about for us is a resurrected lord jesus why did he resurrect so you and i could resurrect praise the people focusing on the rapture the rapture is a great thing but listen resurrection's just as great if i go by the way of the grave if my life is terminated on this earth i have a hope that once i am planted in the ground [Music] there is a germ of life inside my heart if you plant me in the ground all it will take is for the great s-o-n to raise on the resurrection day and i will come out of that grave amen just the same as i went into it because what goes down must come up and if i went down i've got to come up senator saint you're coming up anyways but as a believer a son of god there is a a power that now worketh hallelujah in the children of god [Music] for if by his spirit it quickened him from the dead it will hurt so high it will also quicken your mortal body i mean seriously what good would it do for you to go to heaven and and and wonder well my body's been changed i wonder if that scar from that knife fight i got in in the 70s is still there when i was drunk that night in the bar and somebody took a beer bottle and cut a gash in my eye and i've carried that scar my whole life if you carry that to heaven it would show the identity of what she was on the earth god has to change every bit of them i want you to think this is the reason why there ain't no old folk in heaven and that's why there ain't no babies in heaven a baby has no history an older person has a history sure they've got they've got attributes about him that does not match with that heavenly agenda amen glory to god do you not realize that we are getting ready to go to the greatest youth camp we've ever been invited to help well we will be they'll be 19-21 in the bloom of health brother you talk about a youth camp we're getting ready to assemble for the greatest youth rally we've ever seen there won't be an old person there no no balding head none of that jesus even said i'll fix it so every hair your head is numbered praise be to god oh thank you lord so he took not on him the nature of angels because you remember if jesus had come to this earth and been like an angel he couldn't have died a sinner [Music] but he come as a man that was going to be rejected by god and jesus was rejected so that we could be accepted this is why he did not die an angel he did not die the son of god he did not die the holy spirit he died as a sinner brother man tells us in demolition in 1954 he said and god sent him to hell to pay for my sins oh but because of where he came from when he got down to hell the only thing he could do was demand the keys [Applause] do you realize brother sister that the devil don't even have the keys to his own house jesus goes down and said my blood is still warm on calvary give me the keys oh praise god oh i told my wife i'm going to preach a short sermon tonight the way y'all are pulling we're liable to be here another two hours when i get to feeling like this forget about the clock forget it they don't exist amen listen to this now we understand that angels do not have infinite knowledge as well mark chapter 13 verse 32 but of the day and the hour that day no not the angels no no man which is in heaven or the son but the father so and again it tells us that when revelation 8 1 when the seventh seal had opened there was silence in heaven but the man said the reason they were silenced the angels never understood it now this ought to make you shout until your shouter shouts because if you realize that the devil at one time was an angel so if the angels have infinite knowledge that means the devil and every demon would have infinite knowledge about you come on somebody but the reason they don't have a successful fight and they're always going to lose is because they don't know what your next steps in life are oh hallelujah they don't know what god is going to do with you the devil don't know my thoughts the devil don't know my heart the devil don't know my mind the devil don't know anything but what i or god lets him know and if i'm stupid enough and ignorant enough to open up my mouth i declare and he wins the battle every time the second i open my mouth and let him know what i'm thinking but if i'm in the hardest battle and trial i've ever been in my life if i'll just keep grinning he don't know what's going on with me as he is not a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart satan didn't understand the mystery of job remember he come to god he said you know i would deal with him if you'd let him go he never understood the mystery of job's life he could not understand how that god would have such a hedge around this man he even challenged him take it off he said all right but don't you touch his life i imagine the devil probably said why can't i touch his life why is he so important oh glory he's a man like everybody else he's got two eyes two ears two nose or whatever else he's got amen he's just like everybody else come on now what makes him so special i tell what made him so special it was god's thought about him and how god felt about this man job and just as the devil never understood the mystery of job's life he did not understand the mystery of the life of jesus brother adam said jesus he the devil never believed he was the son of god he's watched every baby been born ever since cain made the first cry and ever since abel made the first squeal the devil has witnessed birth in this world and when jesus was born from mary had a placenta had water had blood the baby would look like blue and shriveled up like babies look when they're born they ugly when they're born friend i'm sorry they just are they might be the most precious thing you ever laid your eyes on but that's after you get them out of the hospital and get them pink bows in their hair they look good then but when they come out of that mess they do not look like they look oh yes so the devil took one look at mary down there and saw jesus born like every other child was born and god hid the mystery of the life of the son of god in that natural birth never understanding what jesus was watching when he meets him in mount in matthew 4 if thou be the son of god still questioning whether he was or not satan never understood the mystery of the life of jesus the same as he don't understand the mystery of your life he is not convinced that you are all that important but i got a message tonight i've got something i want to say to the saints of god never mind the devil but i got something i want to say to you amen just stick around a little while and you'll find out what god really thinks about you [Applause] [Music] sure in the in the mountain caramel show down it come right down to where elijah could do a lot of talking but it was god had to do the walking when jesus stood on mount transfiguration it was the holy spirit god his father that come down on that mountain and performed all of those great things to block out everybody save jesus alone and in the third showdown between you and me and denominations and all the rest of this world it'll be the same way jesus will speak for this bride amen remember what he said in the book of revelation he said though come an hour well he'll make them fallen short feet and declare these are the ones that i loved oh i know why you ain't screaming that's hard for you to swallow don't forget eagles were called to swallow such things your throat's big enough just get your mouth open you'll get it praise the lord right even the angels didn't understand could you imagine how he must have felt when brother branham comes to this earth and begins to tear off that first seal and begin to look at it and say well that was christ don't you understand the devil had enough sense to know he was the writer of that first age it was really so simple that satan could have explained what the horse rider was about he lived it that wasn't the real mystery behind those seals the real mystery behind the seals was not a doctrine get that out of your mind that is not what those seals were all about the real revelation of the seals had nothing to do with solving little simple mysteries of god as to what happened in the garden and those type of things you got the concept of it all wrong brother explains it to us in the breach what it really was that the lamb's book of life had been sealed with seven seals now we're getting down to the real meaning and in that book was names in that book was names of the sons and the daughters of god [Applause] when these people running around saw brother brown didn't do nothing big in the seals anybody could have saw that was world war two shaw the devil understood he was a deception in the first you think satan didn't know he was riding out like a white horse rider conquering a car you think he didn't know what he was doing when that sword turned red the devil had enough sense to parallel it that wasn't the mystery that was hid the mystery that was hid was them little sons and daughters of god that would come along in the 20th century squealing and being born along about 1977 or so and they would live their life for about 12 years not knowing where they come from really and all of a sudden the real meaning of the seals would take place when god would speak to me you are no longer a son of homer and wilma norad but you're mine that is the real mystery that larkin nor none of them had not even an inkling of how to define it or explain it and my message to that is plagiarize that there is no plagiarism to such things brother branham's ministry was not to put together facts and figures and dates and explained to us in vivid detail the daniel 70 weeks the whole purpose of those mysteries of god was to do one thing and that was to position israel to particip position the church because the church is not the bride come on the church is not the bride the church is the foolish virgin the remnant that will go through the tribulation come on she is not the bride the church goes through the tribulation the bride goes out of here that was not the mystery of it the mystery of it was that day you opened up your bible and you went hmm what does that mean for me how do i fit into all of that god i wish somebody would help me right now praise be to god hallelujah and amen that was the real thing remember as we were talking about it last night when the sit when the thunders declared themselves in the heaven john heard what was declared the real ministry for john was not when the little book come open and the angel come down to hand him hold the book out like this he didn't say hmm so who was that first horse rider anyways that was not the ministry of revelation 10 8. the ministry of revelation 10 8 was to unify and become one with the mystery praise be to god that's why you've got to find yourself in the word if you don't know your position in the word the devil can beat you around the stamp but if you know your position in the body of jesus christ there's not enough devils to take it away from you [Music] praise god hallelujah in so much that in first peter chapter 1 verse 12 the bible said that the angels of god looked or desired to look and they means they stooped to look down the meaning of that word look means to become acquainted with something you see jesus said these angels have beheld your father's face that since the day you were born actually every person has an angel until they come to the age of accountability every person has someone an angel of the lord that follows them to give them an opportunity at christ sure but reject christ you reject everything that comes with christ that's why you hear people of these centers back when they were kids and supernatural things happened and they could have died could have been run over all kinds of things but somehow something stepped in the way that's right the lord must be just so he sent to them angelic visitors to watch over him to give him an opportunity but when they rejected christ all of that just went away what remains is the same thing with the foolish virgin the real mystery of god of the foolish virgin are the ones that their name remained on the book of life everybody else was blotted out cain judas esau had their name in the book but blotted out the real mystery of them foolish virgins they're the ones that live so close to god till it's never blotted out and they've watched you all of your days watched you when you was rioting yeah watched you when he was in the bar room watched you when you was out in the world or whatever you might have been they watched over you all of your days they've studied you since the day you took the breath of life remember the prophet of god said when your mother was going to give birth to you she got real sweet because there was an angelic presence i know for believers that's you as well i get that but it was also the angels of the lord hastening your birth into this world they've watched you all the days of your life but that moment perhaps at the altar when the holy spirit got a hold of your heart and you come up and you maybe knelt down or stood up at the altar somebody laid hands on you and the holy ghost come down and wonderfully and beautifully delivered you and filled you with the holy ghost that angel of the lord has watched you all of your life stoop down and inspected you what is going on with brother juan what is going on with scott why they're different somehow do you know the bible said that your prayers are stored in heaven like vials did you know that did you know that the prophet of god said that the day that somebody got saved just any general person that maybe their mother had prayed for them and prayed for them and prayed for them and that person that mother went beyond the curtain of time do you know that brother banham said that the night that that boy got saved or that girl got saved that the angels of the lord went back around the throne of god where mommy was standing and told him your boy got saved remember you prayed for him all those years that girl got saved tonight we can't communicate with the dead but they can send the message back ah no wonder there is a great cloud of witnesses being prepared on the other side don't you realize while you're sitting here even in the house of god tonight every time you worship the lord every time you say amen every time you read your bible there is a message going back to the other side get ready get ready the bride is almost ready no wonder when brother branham made his journey over it was almost like somebody had already told them he was coming remember they come running to him praise the lord amen so all this time this angel desired to know what is it what's going on with them so they stooped they bowed over i wish i could understand what that was about you see the angels of the lord have such power that in world war one for example there was an angel of god given the commission to hold the four winds of the earth this angel was so powerful that the prophet said if that war had been allowed to continue that it would have caused armageddon across the whole earth did you know he said that but god had to stop it because there were some sons and some daughters that had to be sealed still and so this angel of god at permission of the holy spirit steps out on the 11th hour of the day the 11th month hallelujah and puts his big hands out and says stop and without any understanding whatsoever historians cannot still they still they still it's right now still 21st century still cannot figure out what brought an end to the great war and we got the answer right in the bible it was an angel of the lord that had the power to say stop oh praise the lord but you recognize that with all that great power when you got saved no wonder the scripture said that when one gets saved in heaven the angels rejoice they don't do like we do just sit in church and well ain't that great well we'll give them six months see where they are in six months no that's that's our rotten attitude the angels of the lord because you see they've been watching folks get filled with the holy ghost for the last 2000 years and they know what the reel looks like you ain't got a fallen angel of the lord they know what the real holy ghost looks like oh bless the lord oh my listen in in in in matthew chapter 4 verse 11. now notice the angels of the lord are servants to the elect did you know that the bible said that not only do they go up and down jacob's ladder but they also encamped so there's always a host encamped about the angels of the lord that doesn't mean that the angels of the lord don't have missions and things they run back to heaven that's what jacob's latter was all about some of them are around the throne room of god protecting the hell of the holy spirit the four guards up there protecting around the throne room of god you before you can even get a prayer through you've got to get through them angels there's guards protecting the throne room of god sure the bible said all of them angels are surrounding new jerusalem paul spoke about it when he said there's an innumerable host you know what i love about that i like what my buddy brother andrew glover said you know andrew his size 19 foot and brother andrew i love what he said the other day he was preaching in here and and we was singing at a meeting samantha 9. brother andrew said you know in the bible he talked about how that there was a 2 000 000 devils remember that but when the angels of the lord were counted they were innumerable you can count the demons but you can't count the angels of the lord and you think that when you need help that there's not resources available for you now watch the arrangement of this in matthew chapter 4 verse 11. now here jesus is entrenched in battle right then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him now the meaning of this word if you want to know what the meaning of this word is it means to wait at a table and offer food and drink to guests so an angel by definition by the very meaning of the word ministered an angel is called of god to be your waiter now friend i'm just reading to you what the bible said have you ever went to a restaurant and sat down there and nobody comes and serves you it's irritating isn't it nothing worse i hate there's three things in this life i hate sitting at a red light i hate a red light i hate to fly and i hate going to a restaurant and not being refilled on my pepsis diet pepsi i i it just irritates me to death because i sit there and watch them go back and forth and back and forth and i think one of them trips you could have got me a diet pepsi but if you ever walk would you expect to go into a five-star you know michelin-style type chef and go on there and sit down samantha and i had the privileged opportunity to go with some saints one time to one of these real fancy swanky michelin type restaurants and they had one guy his one job was to fill everybody's water and he would catch it the last drop go in your mouth he would grab the cup fill it up and put it back in your hand that was his only mission was to make sure you had water at your table would you imagine to go in there and go spend 130 a person or 230 a person and you're gonna get this big fancy meal and walk in sit down and sit there for 20 minutes and nobody can come and take your order you know how you'd react to that you would get on you'd get on yelp you'd help all right you'd fuss you would you would stew you would go on google you would be i mean if you're one of them type of people that like to put in your review on google you would tear them limb from limb your words would be so sharp you wouldn't know you really would you there would be just such a a a a hatred and a and a fire coming out of your fingers forgive me but it's the truth but yet when you walk into them places the business has saw fit that when you sat down at their tables they've got people ordained to wait on you now god has arranged his whole economy with powers joy healing deliverance peace long suffering patience godliness gentleness meekness authority victory songs amen good rest you know the bible promised us good sleep we have been given all of these the business has provided the chief chef has provided for us everything we have need of have you ever went to a kitchen and heard a quiet kitchen don't eat there because a good kitchen is a busy kitchen a noisy kitchen and you know why all that activity is going on because there's some people out there on them tables that's putting in some orders some people in this message believe that heaven is going to be a place of a little folding of their hands a little slumber and a little sleep they're going to be so quiet you know kind of like you are tonight oh i'm just a quiet person yes until you see your favorite dress in the store or that sale at joann fabric or or some football game or ice hockey thing or some other kind of deal like that oh and then all of a sudden you become jubilant beyond explanation sure people think that heaven is going to be a quiet place i got news for you heaven is a metropolis of activity the angels could you imagine just the prayers just the prayers of you that's in this room could you imagine if i was going to serve you to eat tonight and i pulled up to each one of your tables and asked you to give me the desires of your heart in a culinary fashion and say i want this i want that i want could you imagine me how busy i would be just serving this little body right here hallelujah hallelujah no wonder brother he's not just collecting the prayers of the last few hours he's collecting the prayers of your entire walk with god [Applause] heaven is a beehive of activity because the saints are always keeping things moving oh i love that so if you sat down at a restaurant like that and nobody served you you'd be mad as a hornet going back there again and yet when it comes to serving the lord when we have a need all we have to do is call for it i need healing all you got to do is call for it and ask the waiter bring me my healing glory to god bring me my deliverance bring me my children bring me my grandchildren all you've got to do is ask me because you have not because you ask not somebody asked me one time brother ben it makes me uncomfortable hearing this kind of preaching because what if i'm in the bathroom or i'm taking a shower or an intimate place or an embarrassing place or something like that and these angels of the lord looking down on me i said well let me ask you a question said yeah i said have you ever went to a restaurant and a waiter take your order yeah i said do they stand there and listen to all the conversation and engage or they go away and the man and his wife said well they go away i said that's right because they have a respect for their position they're not interested in what you look like when you're in the bathroom they're not there taking notes when you're amen changing your clothes or some kind of nonsense that's an earthly carnal idea of what these angels of the lord are they are there to get your order and take it back to the kitchen amen and they don't move until you move them oh praise the lord i probably shouldn't pick this up right now probably should do this tomorrow but i'm going to hit it let's just take 10 minutes okay when daniel set his heart to understand gabriel told him the moment that you set your heart to understand it created activity in heaven he said 21 days ago we heard you up here but you see this was such such a special meal it took a little bit of fighting to get it down to daniel and it just so happened that the angel or the demon that he met had more power than him because he said the prince of persia withstood me in other words remember the prophet of god said those demons remember victory day shalom he said that demons have control over nations and he said what causes wars on the earth them two demons get jealous of one another and their influence spreads to the earth and causes war kind of like what happens in churches and one gets one against another another gets another and another one gets another kind of like singers musicians somebody outplays them or does a little bit better of a note or something like that and then they get jealous and they hold hard feelings come on come on don't you all look at me like that we are known around the message for our splitting and our jealousy and our this that and the others sure we are we've been marked by it you know what it is demon activity kingdom building and all the such alike sure it is and i'll admit there are times that probably you know uh uh the prophet of god i'm sure probably scratched his head a lot at what he saw i don't think brother branham understood everything he was looking at here's this prophet of god with this great evangelistical ministry he's got the greatest ministry on the planet and like daniel when he looked out over the landscape of them israelites falling down and worshiping at the image of daniel daniel was the image the the idol it was daniel and daniel is watching these jews fall down and worship his own image when he looked across the landscape of his people something in his heart began to ring and he said oh god we need to understand what's going on around here i don't believe brother braham understood everything he saw but i imagine when he got to that point in his ministry of evangelism where things started repeating themselves you see when you're doing a scientific study or a research study they say when you hit saturation what they call data saturation is when you start getting the same information over and over and over again and you're listening to brother branham he's seeing the same thing happen he said i went to california and preached on you women cutting your hair and next year there was more of you than there was the year before he's hitting a saturation point he's looking across the landscape of his people and something is wrong and this prophet begins to set his heart to understand what's taking place amongst the body no wonder seven angels visited him on sunset because brother branham wanted to know it created activity in another dimension and that's how we got the seals and the revelation of jesus christ because he wanted to know what was truth what do you all reckon god would do if you really wanted to understand who you were i mean really understand you see people say things they say they want to get it they say they want to understand it they say they have that feeling but your actions prove you don't really want it you say you want the holy ghost you pick your bible up once every six months you're a liar i care what your name is you're lying because if you really want it you will fight every day of your life there won't be a moment that goes by in your life you won't be seeking and fighting and stretching trying to get to that place in christ you say whatever you want to but the fact of the proof is in the pudding and the eating thereof people say they want deliverance still goofing off of the same old things that they want deliverance from you don't want deliverance you want somebody to pacify you and tell you to be all right no no that ain't the way god does things the holy spirit wants you to become so determined separate from all things that's ungodly and anything contrary to christ and the moment you set your heart to understand it creates activity in another dimension don't get nervous if i come out from behind that i've been vaccinated hallelujah but brother sister whenever we see the angels of the lord acting we think what does it mean for me you remember there's two women that come up in the prayer line the prophet of god was standing there in his discernment and things and he said well you've got trouble with your throat or something of that nature and you had trouble with your stomach go on the lord's healed you and so forth they go on in you know and and and a couple days later the woman gets up and she's hungry so she drinks some coffee and scrambled some eggs that tasted pretty good so she started it on some bacon and what more and after a while it hit her i'm healed stomach trouble's gone her sister that was in the prayer line was right down to one of her friends there right down the road from her so she got up and she run down there to go tell her the good news and there that woman was shaking the bed sheets looking for that cancer that had fallen offer the night before listen to brother brahm's words and i'm closing he said the angels of the lord was passing through that neighborhood with healing and when he passed through that neighborhood with healing both of them received their healing when the angel of the lord passed through the neighborhood he said the time has arrived for us to recognize who's in our city today it's the angel of god one thing i hope we understand and we're never gonna fully comprehend this but one thing i hope we understand before we go out of here is that god set you up with everything you'll ever have need of to get ready to get out of this place we just don't tap in to the resources that is available to us our faith either lacks or our our heart lacks in some area we sell ourselves short when are we ever going to come to the place to stop here and preaching like what i'm preaching tonight and saying the good things about the bride that i've said about you tonight when are we going to come to the place to stop sitting there and beating the time out of ourselves and start opening our heart and saying you know what that's what jesus said about me i'm asking you a question that's right when are we going to come to the hour to where we settle in our heart i am a child of god i'm as sinless as he is sinless i'm as righteous as he is righteous i'm a son and a daughter of god amen sometimes i believe that what we've done is we've put ourselves into a position to where that god can't move for us because we base his moving his moving rather upon our worthiness and our good behavior now listen to me we're going to quit god ain't looking to see whether you've been a good boy this week or a good girl this week or you listen to so many tapes or you read so many books tapes we don't even some of these young people don't know what a tape is amen ipad tape scotch tape what are you talking about i was i was preaching here the other day and there was a young girl sitting in there and i said i might let you know everything's electronic and i said opening a book i said you know them things with papers the mother come up after church she said we go to the library every day [Laughter] oops but when are we going to come to the place to where we just take a step back and say god before i was even born you created this community to take care of me before i had a chance to be a sinner not a saint now but before i had a chance to be a sinner god created this angelic community for me it goes to prove it's not about your merits it's not about how good you are but for the grace of god there go i thank you yeah when your heart desires to know thank you jesus it creates activity if you want to know it creates activity but you got to really want it friend listen some of you may not know me from adam but i'm going to tell you something this june i celebrate 30 years preaching the gospel imagine that y'all got food and refrigerator older than that somehow you know i'm 44 years old but i started when i was 14. i celebrate 30 years this summer i've been around the world i've preached to thousands of people i've preached all over the world i want to tell you something more and more you know what i find i find people that are a bunch of church members satisfied with a quiet kitchen and a few crackers at the table why should i settle for that when there's been a whole seven-course meal spread before me why should i settle for saltines why should i settle for the hand-me-downs like that little lady when she said but the dogs get the crumbs do you realize that one reason jesus blessed her he called her a dog right but you look what she did she didn't say oh yes i'm a dog no she humbled herself even littler than that you know the real translation she said even the little dogs eat from the master's table jesus called her a dog and she humbled herself even lower than that she didn't call herself a full-grown dog she said but lord even the little dogs i'm trying to tell you something brother if we just come to him and say lord i have a need i have a desire i want to know what's truth i want to know what's right it'll create activity and everything you have need of god has already provided it you just have to ask for it stand with me come on musicians let's sing tonight now you might say well brother ben where do i fit in with all of this well it's quite simple actually the real truth of the matter is only you know that answer yeah i could come up here and read a bunch of text and i could read a bunch of scriptures and quotes and i could generalize for you where you might belong but only you know your real place in all of this that's the reason why that the holy ghost did not want us to be almost kind of y'all know what a rut is you know the holy ghost didn't want us to get stuck in a rut come to church read the bible hear the preaching go home that's not why this has all been created for us god wanted us to have a fervent heart you know that word fervent what it means when the bible talked in acts 18 about apollos that said he had a furby was fervent in spirit that means he come to the boiling point if you know anything about cooking at all some of you sisters maybe your brothers in here like to cook you get that pot on the stove and it hits 212 degrees the molecules in that water begin to respond to the heat that's coming below it they respond as a reaction to the action god wants us to be fervent meaning that when when we pray or we worship or whatever we do we're doing it because we're being stirred by the holy spirit we're passionate about it we desire it we long for it how long has it been since some of you wanted it how long has it been since some of you desired it with all of your heart there might be just one of you in this building tonight but if you look inside yourself maybe you've lost that fervency maybe you need that back okay call for the angels of the lord i want that fervent heart i want that fervent desire i want that fervent spirit maybe you're battling a sickness in your body maybe your home is split in half maybe you've got all kinds of things in your history your past you can't get over brother man what do i do i'm telling you the answer tonight call for help if devils had enough brains when they got busted by the prophet of god and that holy spirit calling them out to call for help what about a saint of god who needs help from the lord cough i help don't just stand there call for help don't stand helpless call for help that's why they're here can we pray together heavenly father lord as we bow our heads to the dust from whence we've come lord i'm asking you to come into this place tonight lord you see the need of every saint of god in here lord whether to be some cold formal maybe they're battling something i don't know lord i just create examples we don't really know the need thou alone knows it but god you are able to do abundant abundantly exceedingly above all we ask or think so i'm praying that you'll come into this place tonight the lord you'll give us enough holy ghost gumption that we can call you for help granted lord as we commit our hearts to you tonight in the name of jesus christ amen can we worship together for just a moment everybody now with your hands raised can we sing it together he became that i might become him by grace he became me that i
