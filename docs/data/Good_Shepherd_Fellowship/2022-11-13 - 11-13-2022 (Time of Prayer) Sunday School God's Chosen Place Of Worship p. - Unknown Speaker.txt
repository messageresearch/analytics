[Music] foreign foreign [Music] countries to come into one place and this great tower it was a religious worship of course but not considered in the word of God so there is where you see denominational religion type the Tower of Babel in the Old Testament which this religion was certainly a religion but not the religion of the word of God God has not chosen to put his name in any denomination I want the scripture for heart if it is I know they claim he has but he hasn't he cannot put his name in many places because he said he put his name in one place and that one place each one of our denominations won't say they are that place but it's contrary but where did he put his name now and he what is his name first we'll have to name find what God's name is before we can find what it is he's putting in the place now we find out that he had many titles it's called the he was called Father which is a title and he is called son which is a title he was called Holy Ghost which is a title it's called Rose of Sharon which is a title Lily the valley a title Morning Star Jehovah Jireh Jehovah rapah seven different compound Redemptive names that all of them were titles none of them were named but he has a name when he met Moses he had not a name yet and he told Moses I am that I am and when we see Jesus on Earth speaking in Hebrews the sixth chapter of beg your pardon Saint John the sixth chapter he said I am that I am they said well you're a man out over 50 years old and say that you've seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am and I am was the one The Burning Bush the pillar of fire that was in the burning bush back in the days of Moses yeah I am the I am now we find out that Jesus said also I came in my father's name and you receive me not then the name of the father must be Jesus that's right the name of the father Jesus Christ Jesus said your I carry my father's name I come in my father's name and you receive me not that is the name of Jesus and Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called his name Emmanuel which is god with us then God was manifested In the Flesh in order to take away the sin of the world and in doing so he was given the name of Jesus so Jesus is the name amen amen and the name was placed in a man not a church amen not a denomination not a Creed but a man he chose to place his name in Jesus Christ now we find out that then he becomes the place of God's worship where you worship Him ever before he was even born his name was called Jesus it was so important is give to his mother by the angel Gabriel that his name would be called Jesus Son of God what he was there we have it man this is it alone it is for him alone God's chosen place of worship God's Place chose God chose to meet man was not in a church not in a denomination not in a Creed but in Christ amen that's the only place that God will meet a man and he can worship God is in Christ that's the only place no matter if your Methodist Baptist Catholic Protestant whatever you might be there's only one place that you can correctly worship God that's in Christ Romans 8 1 said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's the gospel amen we can different upon Creeds we can different upon man-made theories you can go to a Methodist Church you have to be a Methodist the Baptist a Baptist a Catholic a Catholic but when once you're baptized into Christ and become a member of his body there's no differences the middle walls of petition is tore down and you are free because you're in Christ Jesus and you worship God in spirit and in truth when you are in Christ Jesus it's God's plan for you to worship Him in Christ Jesus now no church denomination can claim this no one can claim that how dare you to make such claims to do such a thing with being Antichrist spirit be taken away from Christ to take from him you cannot do that Christ is the only place that God needs to worshipers they say today I've had people tell me a man called me not ongoing Beaumont Texas he said Mr random if your name is not on our church book you cannot go to heaven would you ever think of that don't you believe such a thing as that they think you have to belong to that certain church or you cannot go to heaven that's wrong to believe that is Antichrist I'll say this if you believe such a spirit you're lost that's a good sign you are lost because it's taken away from what God did God never put his name in any church he put it in his son Christ Jesus when he and his son became one that's the genuine place of worship no other foundations enslaved no other Rock on Christ the solid block I stand all other grounds is taking sense the nominations are Kremlin fall Nations will pass away but he will remain forever no other place that a man can find to worship God that God will speak back to him amen no place but in Christ Jesus name that's the only place the only place that God chose to put his name in the only place that he meets man to worship you're a loss to believe anything else notice all seven Jewish Beast was kept in the same place they never kept one fish here for the Methodist and one over here for the Baptist went over there for the Presbyterian one back here for the Catholic and one for the Protestant all seven feasts was kept in the same place it's a very beautiful type here we just went through the seven Church ages going to show that God keep all seven Church ages in the word for each Church age produced a part of the word and whenever they produced it and they saw the light just like the people who first discovered and baptize in Jesus name what did they do they made the denomination out of it and it died right there then God moves right out into somebody else he will not stay in one of those Creeds and dogmas he has nothing to do with it there's nothing perverted about God Amen amen God's words holy unadulterated Christ is God's Center Spot of worship he is God yes amen all seven feasts must be kept in this one place you couldn't keep the feast in any other place but them seven Place The Seven Feast of the Year must be kept in one place therefore the seven Church ages had to come from the one single place that was Christ speaking in all seven Church ages it's exactly right type of the seven Church ages but they made denominations out of it now let's look at another type while we're along here that's the type of the Passover foreshadowed Jesus we know to share the sacrifice of Blood by Death the sacrifice of blood was the place that foreshadowed Christ can a denomination bleed could you think of a church bleeding a denominational bleeding certainly not it's taken blood to bleed from a life and the life here Jesus comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a type of Christ and foreshadow Christ because he was the Lamb of God and John introduced it takes away the sin of the world we find Jesus coming into view here in Exodus the 12th chapter notice it was the only place death could not strike When Death was about to strike the land there had to be a certain place all from under this dock only one place that didn't mean it was one house but there was one place that's where the lamb was killed were the Lamb's blood was the death angel could not strike because it was a one place God had put his name and that lamb was named back there in the beginning of the Lamb notice it was in one place he could not strike and now the same is today there's only one place that spiritual death cannot strike that's the word [Applause] death can't strike the word because it's the Living Word of God but when you put Creeds with it the word moves out to itself it'll separate like water from all you cannot mix it together therefore you see when the Creed comes into a denomination they all go ask the Creed and the word dies out and goes on with somebody else and increases it more picks up a momentum as they go from justification sanctification baptismal Holy Ghost and all out into the grain do you see the path God is trying bringing his name all the time right down the same way because he is the word notice he can't die The Word of Life came down notice how perfect now the death angel was not forbidden to strike Egypt great intellectual people it wasn't forbidden to strike its sacred lands it's great buildings it's pharaohs or the priests of the land the angel was not forbidden to strike he could strike any building any place anybody but it could not strike where the lamb was death cannot strike where this provided place of God is and that is in the lamb notice not even once if he forbidden to strike Israel or it's Hebrew priest and or any of their denominations all must be in God's chosen provided place or Deathstroke Church wherever you are what you belong to makes me no difference but there's one thing you must know you've got to be in Christ or you're dead [Music] you can't live outside of you your church might be all right as a building your fellowship might be all right as man but when you deny the body the blood the word of Jesus Christ you're dead the minute you do it because God's chosen place of worship that's where his name is exactly that's where he chose to put his name not in the church but in the sun Jesus Christ notice safety line only in the place of his choosing in his land and in the name of the Lamb notice it was a male lamb are he not a her not a church she but his name not her name or he was going to meet the people as not in her name but in his name him the lamb now we say the church the Great Mighty Church she did this as she did that she's waved the Stars we picked up in population we're great in numbers we're a mighty's cursed she's a great thing but God never said anything about a she the lamb not the church not her name but his name he didn't put her in him anywhere he put his name in him that's why all we must do or word our deep we must do it all in the name of Jesus Christ if we pray we got to pray in the name of Jesus if we ask petition we've got to ask in Jesus name if we walk we walk in Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus name if we baptize we've got to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ amen for all that we do in word or indeed do it in the name of Jesus Christ a fella said to me one time discussing that he said brother Branham my wife I don't said she her name is such and such she's a Ministry maybe sitting here now and he said my wife said she's got my name I'll just say Jones because it wasn't Jones he said now she don't have to get up a morning get the broom and say now I sweep the floor in the name of Jones and I wash the dishes in the name of Jones and I patch the clothes in the name of Jones he said I don't think you have to call any name at all I said I believe you do that's right and he said well why she don't have to say everything she does is in the name of Jones to begin with I said but you never walked out on the street and got her and say come on Jones she had to become first by a ceremony amen a married ceremony Jones if she didn't you're living in adultery and if you're baptized any other way but in the name of Jesus Christ it's an adultery baptism in the Bible [Music] then what you do in word indeed do it all in the name of Jesus after that what you do but first you have to come in his name there's many fine women in this building tonight find loyal women but there's one miss William Branham she's the one goes home with me she's the one that's my wife there's fine people in the world find churches but there's one miss Jesus Christ that's who he's coming for that's where he's namely that's where he's worship is and her and her alone that is true oh yes sir we find that to be true now that's why we all we do in word are deep we do it in the name of Jesus Christ there is not another name given under heaven for salvation but the name of Jesus Christ acts the second chapter says that for being known unto you there's not another name given under Heaven whereby a man must be saved only in the name of Jesus Christ amen I hope you get amen the name of Jesus Christ every highest Heaven is named him all the family in heaven his name Jesus the Bible says and all the family on Earth is named Jesus so that's God's chosen name and where he's put it amen that's his place of worship is in Jesus Christ now we know that to be so no other place to worship but in him there's no another name under Heaven given among man whereby they must be saved his is God's name of redemption God has a name called Jehovah Jireh Jehovah rapah Jehovah Jireh the Lord forgives all our sins Jehovah Rapha the Lord heals all thou diseases he had many titles but he's got one name of redemption that belongs to the human race and that is the name of Jesus amen that's his name he chose to put where did he put it he put it in Christ all our church names Creeds titles is death to trust them your trust in the Methodist Church should take you to heaven you're lost if you're trusting the Pentecostals the Pentecostal Church to take you to heaven you're lost in the Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian Catholic any other Church you're trusting their name or their title or their Creed you are lost because you can't even worship until first you come into the place of worship hey man that's the only place God meets the worshiper is a place he chose to put his name all others you trust in them you'll die he also another shadow of Jesus share I've got marked down the scripture oh so he he foreshed it here he must be without a blemish the place he puts his name this lamb must be without a blemish now what denomination system can you pin this to right what church Catholic Protestant Jewish whatever it is what system denomination can you pin that to without a blemish on it it's all rejected and refused but there is a place Hallelujah that place is in Jesus Christ [Applause] there's not a blemish on him there's no fault in him you cannot pin this all these people try to do so say their churches without fault and all this it's filthy word breakers lovers half dead lay your sin Creed but it is not the truth but even pilate himself his enemy said I can find no fault in him his own enemy testified there was no fault any you can't pin any sin on him he said to the priest of his days which one of you could accuse me of sin who could show me that I'm a sinner tell me one church that can say they never did do anything wrong frankly there's not a one of them hearted but what's murdered and done everything there is on the calendar to do hard they're still calling himself so it's not God's meeting place of worship in any Creed or denomination our friends I don't want to hurt feelings but I'm responsible for a message and that message has come out of this mess [Music] foreign [Music]
