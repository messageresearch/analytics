[1:05:52] he hath sent me to bind up the
[1:05:54] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[1:05:57] captives and the opening of the prison
[1:05:59] to them that are bound
[1:06:01] verse 2 to proclaim the acceptable year

[1:06:30] reading the 16th verse
[1:06:33] and he came to nazareth where he had
[1:06:35] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:06:38] went into the synagogue on the sabbath
[1:06:40] day and stood up for to read
[1:06:43] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:06:45] book of the prophet essaius and when he
[1:06:47] had opened the book he found the place
[1:06:49] where it was written
[1:06:51] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:06:53] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:06:55] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[1:06:57] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:07:00] deliverance to the captives and
[1:07:02] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:07:04] at liberty them that are bruised
[1:07:07] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:07:10] lord and he closed the book and he gave
[1:07:12] it again to the minister and sat down
[1:07:15] and the eyes of all them that were in
[1:07:17] the synagogue were fastened on him and

[1:08:35] know we were in brazil we were there for
[1:08:38] three weeks we were in many different
[1:08:40] churches and
[1:08:42] they tell me that there's over ten
[1:08:44] thousand churches just in that one
[1:08:45] country and ten thousand message
[1:08:48] churches and it's we found it probably
[1:08:50] to be true we couldn't go to all of them
[1:08:52] but every city that we went to there was
[1:08:54] uh 20 25 30 churches in that city and
[1:08:57] they had enough for a convention of
[1:08:59] their own so we had uh
[1:09:02] actually three different conventions in
[1:09:03] different parts of the country and we've
[1:09:06] met some wonderful people some wonderful
[1:09:08] believers and they're just like you they
[1:09:10] believe in the end time message they
[1:09:11] believe that god has sent a prophet to
[1:09:13] bring us to this place to prepare a
[1:09:15] bride and they believe that they're part
[1:09:17] of that bride of jesus christ and i
[1:09:19] believe this morning that this group of
[1:09:21] people is that part is a part of that
[1:09:23] great body of the body of jesus christ
[1:09:26] so we had a wonderful time in in brazil
[1:09:29] and people were healed people were saved
[1:09:32] reports started coming in even before we
[1:09:34] left the country of uh some miraculous
[1:09:37] healings and and uh some deliverances
[1:09:40] and uh we had some baptisms so god was
[1:09:43] in it and we thank god for what he's
[1:09:45] done but this morning is a new day and
[1:09:48] we are not in brazil we're in minnesota
[1:09:51] and happy to be here
[1:09:52] here in our scripture reading today we
[1:09:55] find a prophecy given by isaiah the
[1:09:57] prophet now you all message people you
[1:09:59] know these things then over in luke's
[1:10:01] gospel we find that prophecy that was
[1:10:03] given in isaiah being fulfilled in the
[1:10:06] message entitled the jubilee year uh
[1:10:08] brother branham and it was actually
[1:10:10] preached in 1954 and in october brother
[1:10:13] branham preached uh now isaiah many
[1:10:16] hundreds of years probably between five
[1:10:19] and eight hundred years before this had
[1:10:21] prophesied under inspiration that christ
[1:10:24] when he came he would be anointed to
[1:10:26] preach the acceptable year of the lord
[1:10:28] then it brother brandon says it had to
[1:10:30] become just exactly that way for god
[1:10:33] through his prophet has spoke his word
[1:10:35] and his word must come to pass when a
[1:10:38] prophet of god speaks the word he's not
[1:10:40] speaking his own word he's speaking the
[1:10:42] thoughts of christ and that word has to
[1:10:44] come to pass and i'll just maybe tell
[1:10:46] you one little testimony and
[1:10:49] as i said last night i was i i was
[1:10:51] privileged to to be raised
[1:10:54] born and raised in jeffersonville and
[1:10:56] and i was privileged to be in those
[1:10:58] meetings of some of those great meetings
[1:10:59] and in
[1:11:00] 1963
[1:11:02] after the seals were preached uh
[1:11:05] i was uh 13 years old and uh
[1:11:08] uh the deacons and the crowds when
[1:11:11] brother branham was there as you've
[1:11:12] heard and you know
[1:11:13] they were just fantastic there's people
[1:11:16] everywhere people standing along the
[1:11:18] wall three and four deep uh the the
[1:11:21] people on the uh uh uh sitting on the
[1:11:24] altar people
[1:11:25] in the baptistery they put a board down
[1:11:27] over the pool and they would set chairs
[1:11:29] there and there's there just was never
[1:11:31] enough seating so one sunday morning the
[1:11:34] deacon came one of the deacons came
[1:11:37] and spoke before the church and he said
[1:11:39] look it said as as deacons we would like
[1:11:42] for all the young boys
[1:11:44] 13 or 12 years of age and older to give
[1:11:47] up their seat so that people coming in
[1:11:49] from out of town would have people would
[1:11:51] have places to sit
[1:11:53] in in the congregation
[1:11:55] and being 13 years old i was one of
[1:11:57] those boys that gave up my seat that
[1:12:02] would have more seating for the adults
[1:12:04] and
[1:12:05] so uh now
[1:12:07] then then when brother branham came back
[1:12:09] in town there was a few more seats
[1:12:10] because those boys had given our seat up
[1:12:13] and we were supposed to go out and sit
[1:12:15] in the car and listen to the message on
[1:12:17] the radio which so many people were
[1:12:18] doing there was probably 400 people
[1:12:20] sitting in parking lots around just
[1:12:22] listening to the brother brandon's uh
[1:12:25] message on the radio because they
[1:12:26] couldn't get into the church and so we
[1:12:28] were supposed to go out and sit in the
[1:12:30] car but being
[1:12:31] being
[1:12:32] 13 year old boys we didn't always do
[1:12:34] what we were supposed to do we would
[1:12:36] we would
[1:12:37] listen for a while then we would walk
[1:12:39] down to the gas station get coca-colas
[1:12:40] and you know and talk about such things
[1:12:42] as boys talk about at 13 years of age
[1:12:45] but anyway i was one of those boys that
[1:12:47] that gave up my seat and so when brother
[1:12:49] branham came back in town for the next
[1:12:51] meeting
[1:12:53] my father who was a minister there in
[1:12:55] the church and song leader for brother
[1:12:56] branham uh he was invited to a meeting
[1:13:00] and he said the deacons had a meeting
[1:13:02] with brother branham and brother neville
[1:13:04] and and my father and and
[1:13:06] the deacons told brother bantam what
[1:13:09] they had done
[1:13:10] they told him that they had asked all
[1:13:11] the boys 12 years of age and older to
[1:13:13] give up their seat so they'd have more
[1:13:15] seating for people from out of town and
[1:13:18] uh my father was there when that was
[1:13:20] said to the they told the prophet what
[1:13:22] they had done
[1:13:23] and uh
[1:13:25] my father said when they told brother
[1:13:26] branham that
[1:13:28] he said he looked up like this
[1:13:30] and then he said oh that's fine that's
[1:13:32] mighty fine he said and i want you to
[1:13:35] know
[1:13:36] god will bless those boys for that
[1:13:38] someday
[1:13:39] well to me
[1:13:41] i felt like
[1:13:43] i just feel like
[1:13:45] that that was for me
[1:13:47] and i think i'm standing before you this
[1:13:49] morning as a spoken word blessing of a
[1:13:51] prophet of god because i've been blessed
[1:13:54] because the prophet of god said those
[1:13:56] boys will be blessed for doing that and
[1:13:59] i feel like i've been blessed and i just
[1:14:01] claim that promise i claim that for
[1:14:03] myself and i'm standing before you this
[1:14:06] morning as a spoken word blessing of a
[1:14:08] prophet of god amen all right now to get
[1:14:11] to the message here in our scripture
[1:14:14] reading this morning we find a prophecy
[1:14:16] given by isaiah the prophet then over in
[1:14:18] luke's
[1:14:19] gospel that we read we find that that
[1:14:22] prophecy prophecy has been fulfilled now
[1:14:26] in the message the jubilee year brother
[1:14:28] branham says now isaiah
[1:14:30] and and this comes from the message of
[1:14:32] brother branham entitled the jubilee
[1:14:34] year and it was preached in 1954 he said
[1:14:37] now isaiah many hundreds of years
[1:14:39] probably between five and eight hundred
[1:14:41] years before this had prophesied under
[1:14:43] inspiration that christ when he came he
[1:14:46] would be anointed to preach the
[1:14:48] acceptable year of the lord then it had
[1:14:50] to become just exactly that way
[1:14:52] for god through his prophet had spoke
[1:14:54] his word and his word must come to pass
[1:14:57] now that prophecy in isaiah had to come
[1:15:00] to pass just like the prophet isaiah
[1:15:03] spoke it was god speaking through a man
[1:15:06] and it had to come to pass there in
[1:15:09] luke's gospel jesus said he hath
[1:15:11] anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:15:14] year of the lord and i'll ask you this
[1:15:15] question this morning church do we know
[1:15:18] what the acceptable year of the lord is
[1:15:21] and i know many of us do
[1:15:24] but i just want to read you a couple of
[1:15:25] things that the prophet god said about
[1:15:28] the acceptable year
[1:15:30] in the message entitled this day this
[1:15:33] scripture is fulfilled brother branham
[1:15:34] said notice the messiah standing in the
[1:15:38] platform to identify himself with the
[1:15:41] word of promise for that age i like that
[1:15:44] sentence he was standing in the platform
[1:15:48] to identify himself with the word of
[1:15:51] promise for that age church i believe
[1:15:53] that we're standing this morning to
[1:15:55] identify ourselves
[1:15:59] with the word of promise for this age
[1:16:01] praise god the acceptable year as we all
[1:16:04] know brother branham says the acceptable
[1:16:06] year as bible readers was the year of
[1:16:09] jubilee
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] i say praise god the year of jubilee
[1:16:15] find my place here
[1:16:17] that was when all the slaves and all the
[1:16:20] prisoners as they were had been taken
[1:16:23] and put in prison and had to give a son
[1:16:26] to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a
[1:16:28] debt and they were in bondage
[1:16:31] no matter how long brother branham says
[1:16:33] they had been in bondage or how long
[1:16:36] they were supposed to stay there when
[1:16:38] the year come of the jubilee the
[1:16:40] acceptable year when the trumpet sounded
[1:16:43] every man could go free
[1:16:45] if he wanted to go free
[1:16:47] you're free
[1:16:48] you was no more a slave at that point
[1:16:51] but
[1:16:52] if you desired to remain a slave then
[1:16:55] you had to be taken down to the temple
[1:16:57] stood by the temple post they took it
[1:17:00] all and bored a hole in your ear and
[1:17:02] then you had to serve that slave master
[1:17:05] the rest of your days
[1:17:08] and in the message entitled jubilee year
[1:17:11] we are told by brother branham now jesus
[1:17:13] was prophesied by isaiah to preach the
[1:17:17] acceptable year
[1:17:18] that's what we want to deal on tonight
[1:17:20] he said the acceptable year
[1:17:23] of the old writings the year of jubilee
[1:17:27] so we know this morning that the
[1:17:29] acceptable year
[1:17:31] is the year of jubilee
[1:17:33] it is a time to be set free
[1:17:36] from prison
[1:17:37] or bondage
[1:17:38] it is a time for the manifestation of
[1:17:42] the sons and daughters of god amen
[1:17:45] now in john the 8th chapter the 32nd
[1:17:48] verse i'll just quote it jesus tells us
[1:17:50] you shall know the truth
[1:17:53] and the truth shall make you free is
[1:17:55] that right
[1:17:56] and today church if there has ever been
[1:17:59] a group of people that should know truth
[1:18:03] it is this end time bride of jesus
[1:18:05] christ
[1:18:06] i was talking with brother steve and his
[1:18:08] wife on the way to church
[1:18:09] and they remarked that when they came to
[1:18:13] the message
[1:18:14] they recognized truth
[1:18:16] for the first time they knew that they
[1:18:18] had received truth church is a great
[1:18:20] thing when you can say you've received
[1:18:23] truth
[1:18:25] so if there's ever been a group of
[1:18:26] people that should know truth i believe
[1:18:28] it's the bride of jesus christ and if
[1:18:31] there was ever a time
[1:18:32] in history to know truth i believe it is
[1:18:35] this time
[1:18:37] this is the time that we can know truth
[1:18:39] if we desire to know truth
[1:18:42] the bride of christ has been given the
[1:18:45] truth of god's word by the omega
[1:18:47] ministry of jesus christ in this day
[1:18:51] through the son of man ministry of
[1:18:53] revelation 10 7
[1:18:55] in this very generation
[1:18:57] now i'm from the south of the united
[1:18:59] states i'm not
[1:19:01] from the north
[1:19:03] in the in the south
[1:19:06] uh our churches are usually a little
[1:19:08] noisy
[1:19:11] we we
[1:19:12] it doesn't bother us when people say
[1:19:14] amen
[1:19:15] it doesn't bother us when people jump up
[1:19:17] and shout
[1:19:18] and i'm one of those people that do
[1:19:19] those things when i hear the word i
[1:19:21] don't have to preach but when i hear the
[1:19:23] word i get excited so if you hear
[1:19:26] something this morning and it excites
[1:19:28] you it's all right to say amen
[1:19:31] it's all right to jump up and shout and
[1:19:33] it's all right if you want to come up
[1:19:34] and shake my hand it's all right if you
[1:19:36] want to run the aisle i don't care i'll
[1:19:39] be running right with you
[1:19:40] god bless you this morning
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:48] praise the lord
[1:19:52] so we know that the acceptable year is
[1:19:54] the year of jubilee
[1:19:56] it is a time to be set free from prison
[1:19:59] or bondage it is a time for the
[1:20:02] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[1:20:03] of god amen and today if there's ever
[1:20:07] been a time to know truth i believe it
[1:20:09] is this time the bride of jesus christ
[1:20:12] has been given the truth of god's word
[1:20:14] by the omega ministry of jesus christ
[1:20:17] through the ministry of william branham
[1:20:19] through the son of man ministry in this
[1:20:22] generation where once again in this
[1:20:24] generation
[1:20:26] the priest handed the scriptures handed
[1:20:28] the bible to brother branham you know
[1:20:31] the story and he preached this day this
[1:20:34] scripture is fulfilled
[1:20:36] glory hallelujah
[1:20:38] to identify himself with the word of
[1:20:41] promise for this age
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:45] for this age
[1:20:46] this age that you and i live in church
[1:20:48] this is not laodicea for the fraud this
[1:20:51] is the bright age this is rapture age
[1:20:54] this is judgment age it's time that we
[1:20:57] know who we are it's time that we get up
[1:20:59] and be about the father's business and
[1:21:01] what is the father's business i want to
[1:21:04] ask you this morning what is the
[1:21:05] father's business the father's business
[1:21:08] is ruling and reigning
[1:21:10] in royalty
[1:21:13] we are the royal seat of abraham and
[1:21:15] we're to be about the father's business
[1:21:17] we're to be about ruling and reigning
[1:21:20] in royalty
[1:21:22] and you can do that
[1:21:24] if you know who you are
[1:21:27] the church
[1:21:28] i can't tell you who you are
[1:21:30] the pastor can't tell you who you are
[1:21:32] you got to know by revelation who you
[1:21:35] are
[1:21:36] that you
[1:21:37] are mrs jesus christ
[1:21:43] you are mrs jesus christ
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] do you know who you are this morning
[1:21:49] now i don't
[1:21:51] i don't want to get sidetracked
[1:21:54] i preached on that last night
[1:21:56] but i i could preach on it again today
[1:22:00] it's always good
[1:22:01] to know who you are
[1:22:03] praise the lord
[1:22:05] to identify himself
[1:22:07] with the word of promise
[1:22:09] for this age
[1:22:11] and i say are you with me now this
[1:22:12] morning
[1:22:13] you're right with me i believe you are
[1:22:15] amen
[1:22:16] the truth has been given to the bride
[1:22:18] body
[1:22:19] as a whole
[1:22:22] the bride body as a whole
[1:22:24] the truth has been given
[1:22:27] and we
[1:22:28] as individuals
[1:22:30] have to receive the truth
[1:22:33] we have to know truth
[1:22:36] and become intimate with truth
[1:22:38] with the truth of this hour
[1:22:41] as an individual
[1:22:43] it's not just good enough
[1:22:45] to go to a message church
[1:22:47] that believes truth
[1:22:49] that preaches truth
[1:22:51] and say well
[1:22:53] i'm here
[1:22:54] what are you going to do to bless me
[1:22:56] today
[1:22:57] no that's not how it works
[1:23:00] you may be attending a church that knows
[1:23:02] truth but you have to receive truth as
[1:23:06] an individual
[1:23:09] it's good that the truth has been given
[1:23:11] to the right body as a whole
[1:23:13] but you have to know truth
[1:23:15] for yourself
[1:23:17] as an individual
[1:23:19] and when you
[1:23:21] come to the knowledge of truth
[1:23:23] for yourself
[1:23:25] then you
[1:23:26] have entered into a jubilee year
[1:23:29] you have been entered into
[1:23:31] well glory
[1:23:34] you have been in
[1:23:35] you have entered in
[1:23:37] the acceptable year of the lord
[1:23:40] the
[1:23:41] spirit of truth
[1:23:43] has come
[1:23:44] and taken over your life
[1:23:46] and you know who you are
[1:23:48] you know who you're serving
[1:23:50] you know
[1:23:52] what this message is all about
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] we have to dedicate ourselves to truth
[1:23:59] we have to have
[1:24:01] a personal relationship
[1:24:03] with truth
[1:24:06] have you had a personal relationship
[1:24:10] with truth this morning i believe i'm
[1:24:12] speaking to a group of people who has
[1:24:14] had a relationship with truth
[1:24:16] in their very own
[1:24:18] life
[1:24:19] as we said
[1:24:21] not good enough
[1:24:22] just to join a church
[1:24:24] that claims to preach truth
[1:24:27] you have to know truth
[1:24:29] for yourself
[1:24:30] you have to receive the holy ghost
[1:24:33] yourself
[1:24:34] that will lead you
[1:24:35] and guide you
[1:24:37] into all truth
[1:24:38] amen i don't know how i got sidetracked
[1:24:41] on that because i'm not really preaching
[1:24:42] on truth but it's good anyhow
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:46] hallelujah
[1:24:48] now this morning
[1:24:50] in speaking about the acceptable year
[1:24:53] the year of jubilee
[1:24:55] i thought if it's all right
[1:24:57] it's all right with the pastor i believe
[1:24:59] it is i thought we might do
[1:25:02] a little history lesson this morning
[1:25:04] that'd be all right
[1:25:07] an american history lesson
[1:25:10] amen stay with me now
[1:25:16] this morning
[1:25:18] my title is
[1:25:20] the emancipation
[1:25:22] proclamation
[1:25:24] now i know other preachers
[1:25:27] have preached on this subject
[1:25:30] and i can't preach it like they
[1:25:31] preaching
[1:25:32] but
[1:25:34] they can't preach it like i preach
[1:25:37] so with your help this morning
[1:25:39] with your amens
[1:25:40] we're gonna speak on the emancipation
[1:25:44] proclamation
[1:25:46] now the emancipation proclamation is a
[1:25:48] great american historical document
[1:25:50] that set at liberty a particular segment
[1:25:53] of american society
[1:25:55] and as most of you know that segment of
[1:25:57] society was the negro slaves brought to
[1:25:59] the united states from africa to work
[1:26:02] the large plantations in the american
[1:26:05] south
[1:26:07] and we know
[1:26:08] that slavery was a terrible dark
[1:26:12] stain
[1:26:13] on america's history
[1:26:15] i went to the trouble
[1:26:17] of looking up
[1:26:19] the definition
[1:26:20] of the words emancipation proclamation
[1:26:24] in church it just simply means
[1:26:27] the proclaiming of freedom that's all it
[1:26:29] means the proclaiming of freedom so
[1:26:31] we're going to talk for just a little
[1:26:32] while this morning about the proclaiming
[1:26:34] of freedom and to set the stage for our
[1:26:37] lesson this morning i want to look at
[1:26:39] a few things
[1:26:40] that brother branham shared with us
[1:26:43] now in the message life story that he
[1:26:45] preached in orangeburg kentucky
[1:26:50] brother branham says
[1:26:52] i remember reading of a man
[1:26:53] that was born 100 miles from me
[1:26:56] a hundred years difference 100 years
[1:26:58] earlier in a little log cabin
[1:27:00] his name was abraham lincoln when he got
[1:27:03] off the boat down in new orleans one day
[1:27:05] he seen them auctioning off some colored
[1:27:07] people they auctioned him off as slave
[1:27:10] they'd take a big heavy man his poor
[1:27:12] little wife and children standing out
[1:27:14] crying and they would breed that bigger
[1:27:16] heavier man after they bought him like
[1:27:18] cattle to bigger heavier women to make
[1:27:21] better slaves
[1:27:23] lincoln as many of you know
[1:27:25] in the history when he folded his hands
[1:27:27] he saw that he folded his hands he
[1:27:30] smacked him together and he said that's
[1:27:31] wrong amen and by the help of god
[1:27:35] abraham lincoln said if it takes my life
[1:27:37] i'll hit it with all i got
[1:27:40] and he did
[1:27:42] now in the message paradox
[1:27:44] preached in april of 1964 in tampa
[1:27:48] florida
[1:27:49] brother branham said when i was a little
[1:27:50] boy i set reading my history book i was
[1:27:54] reading one day and seen there where
[1:27:55] abraham lincoln got off of a train down
[1:27:58] in here in new orleans and they was
[1:28:00] auctioning off big colored slaves down
[1:28:02] there to breed him to some bigger women
[1:28:04] to make better sleep abraham lincoln
[1:28:06] took his hat off he twisted his fist he
[1:28:08] was a kentuckian like i was he said
[1:28:11] that's wrong that's wrong brother adam
[1:28:13] said i still say it's wrong god made man
[1:28:16] man-made slaves
[1:28:19] can you say amen this morning
[1:28:22] and we as the bride of christ
[1:28:24] we are not to be slaves
[1:28:27] to anything
[1:28:29] we are not to be slaves to sin

[1:28:40] be slaves to the world we are not slaves
[1:28:43] to big name personalities in the message

[1:28:50] we are not to be slaves to big name
[1:28:53] personalities in the message
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:29:01] we ought to be free

[1:29:06] the power and the demonstration of the
[1:29:08] holy ghost

[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:41] another little story
[1:29:43] by brother branham
[1:29:45] this is from the message go and tell my
[1:29:46] disciples
[1:29:48] preached in april 1954 brother branham
[1:29:50] said this
[1:29:52] he said i passed by a museum over in
[1:29:54] illinois here some time ago
[1:29:56] i seen an aged color man
[1:29:59] with a little ring of white hair
[1:30:01] around his head
[1:30:03] and he was walking around
[1:30:05] in that museum looking
[1:30:07] and after a while he stopped
[1:30:09] and tears began to run down his cheeks
[1:30:13] he backed off
[1:30:15] and started saying a prayer
[1:30:18] i watched him for a few minutes brother
[1:30:19] branham said
[1:30:20] and i was walking around too so i walked
[1:30:23] over and i said
[1:30:24] uncle
[1:30:25] what's the matter
[1:30:27] i see you crying and i noticed you're
[1:30:28] praying
[1:30:30] and that man said
[1:30:31] look laying there brother brown said i
[1:30:34] looked laying there
[1:30:36] and the only thing i could see
[1:30:38] was a dress
[1:30:40] he said sir only thing i see is a dress
[1:30:44] but it was the blood-stained dress
[1:30:47] of abraham lincoln's wife
[1:30:51] he said look sir
[1:30:53] he held up his coat in his shirt he said
[1:30:55] beneath my coat
[1:30:56] is a scar
[1:30:58] of a slave belt
[1:31:00] he said
[1:31:01] that blood on that dress
[1:31:03] he said that's the blood of abraham
[1:31:05] lincoln
[1:31:06] he said it took the blood of abraham
[1:31:09] lincoln to take that slave belt off of
[1:31:11] me
[1:31:12] brother and said i thought to myself if
[1:31:14] it would excite an old colored man
[1:31:17] because of the blood of abraham lincoln
[1:31:19] because it took a slave belt off of what
[1:31:21] the blood of jesus christ mean to the
[1:31:23] believer
[1:31:25] when we look back to calvary and we see
[1:31:28] there that he took the slave belt of sin
[1:31:30] from our hearts and he set us free that
[1:31:33] we've been talking about what a
[1:31:35] difference it is
[1:31:39] church
[1:31:40] we ought to be
[1:31:42] the happiest people on the face of the
[1:31:44] earth
[1:31:46] we should be shouting and praising god
[1:31:49] for the blood of jesus christ
[1:31:52] because we have been set free
[1:31:54] by that blood
[1:31:56] this morning
[1:31:59] this morning
[1:32:00] our text says
[1:32:02] jesus was anointed to preach the gospel
[1:32:05] to the poor to heal the brokenhearted to

[1:32:30] spiritually

[1:32:33] have to experience these things
[1:32:36] as an individual
[1:32:39] as an individual member
[1:32:40] that makes up
[1:32:42] that body of the wife of christ
[1:32:45] church it has to become personal to you

[1:33:04] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:33:07] many of us
[1:33:08] were captives to denomination
[1:33:11] to recover sight to the blind told a
[1:33:13] sister last night about the testimony of
[1:33:15] john ryan

[1:33:18] gave john ryan back his eyesight
[1:33:22] at liberty them that are bruised i
[1:33:23] believe i'm looking at people this
[1:33:25] morning some of them have been bruised
[1:33:26] but they've been set at liberty
[1:33:28] because of the message of the hour and
[1:33:30] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:33:32] lord to preach the jubilee year
[1:33:35] amen
[1:33:36] you and i have to experience these
[1:33:38] things as an individual member that
[1:33:40] makes up the bride it has to be personal
[1:33:43] to each and every one of us
[1:33:45] church the acceptable year is here
[1:33:49] what was this acceptable year it was the
[1:33:50] year of jubilee
[1:33:52] jubilee has come the bright age is here
[1:33:55] the bright age is going on right now
[1:33:59] not it is coming but it is here right
[1:34:01] now
[1:34:05] going back to the quote for just a
[1:34:06] minute there where brother branham said
[1:34:08] i remember reading of a man born exactly
[1:34:11] 100 miles from me where i was born and
[1:34:13] exactly 100 years of heart earlier
[1:34:16] he was speaking
[1:34:17] about
[1:34:18] abraham lincoln and i don't know if
[1:34:20] you've ever been to kentucky and over
[1:34:21] the steve hatz he's lived there but in
[1:34:23] kentucky
[1:34:24] there's a place called hodgenville
[1:34:26] kentucky
[1:34:27] and that is the birthplace
[1:34:29] of abraham lincoln and they have
[1:34:32] reconstructed the cabin the log cabin
[1:34:34] that he was born in
[1:34:36] but if you were to drive
[1:34:38] 100 miles exactly
[1:34:40] from hodgenville kentucky you would come
[1:34:43] to burkesville kentucky
[1:34:45] where brother branham was born
[1:34:48] and
[1:34:49] he was born exactly
[1:34:51] a hundred miles from
[1:34:53] and a hundred
[1:34:55] miles later than abraham lincoln was
[1:34:58] born
[1:35:00] said i remember reading of a man born
[1:35:02] exactly 100 miles from before i was born
[1:35:03] in exactly 100 years for me he was
[1:35:05] speaking about brother adam was speaking
[1:35:07] about abraham lincoln
[1:35:09] and we see that abraham lincoln
[1:35:12] a man from kentucky
[1:35:14] moved into a natural leadership role as
[1:35:18] president of the united states
[1:35:23] and that was the highest
[1:35:25] political
[1:35:26] office
[1:35:27] in the land
[1:35:28] and he
[1:35:30] moved into that leader leadership role
[1:35:33] as president of the united states at one
[1:35:35] of the most trying times
[1:35:37] in american political history
[1:35:39] it was a time of great war and great
[1:35:41] strife
[1:35:42] the american civil war
[1:35:44] it was a terrible time in america
[1:35:47] we had the north fighting against the
[1:35:49] south we had state fighting against the
[1:35:51] state we had family fighting against
[1:35:53] family and brother fighting against
[1:35:55] brother
[1:35:56] it was truly the greatest battle ever
[1:35:59] fought in u.s history
[1:36:01] it's a matter of fact that it was
[1:36:05] a bloody battle it was a great battle
[1:36:08] and in part it was for freedom freedom
[1:36:10] from slavery in the natural world
[1:36:13] stay with me now now this great american
[1:36:15] document
[1:36:16] the emancipation proclamation came
[1:36:19] at the end
[1:36:21] of the greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:23] in america
[1:36:25] it's a factual matter of history that
[1:36:28] the american civil war produced more
[1:36:30] dead american soldiers and casualties
[1:36:33] than world war one world war ii and the
[1:36:35] vietnam war combined
[1:36:38] it truly was the greatest battle
[1:36:41] ever fought
[1:36:43] in the united states
[1:36:45] but the proclaiming of freedom
[1:36:47] the emancipation proclamation
[1:36:50] came forth at the ending of this
[1:36:53] greatest battle ever fought
[1:36:56] and there was a segment of american
[1:36:57] society set free after this greatest
[1:37:01] battle was ever fought
[1:37:04] now
[1:37:06] in this day
[1:37:08] we have another great war
[1:37:10] being fought
[1:37:12] in the spiritual realm
[1:37:14] brother branham said it too
[1:37:16] is the greatest battle ever fought
[1:37:19] church i'm talking about the battle of
[1:37:21] the mind
[1:37:22] and that battle is raging
[1:37:24] we have people that have served the lord
[1:37:27] and served the lord in this message for
[1:37:29] 30 and 40 years and the battle is going
[1:37:31] on in their mind and many of them are
[1:37:33] losing the battle
[1:37:36] they're going back to the world they're
[1:37:38] going back to the nomination they're
[1:37:40] going back
[1:37:43] to where they came from
[1:37:46] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:37:48] it is known as the battle of the mind
[1:37:51] and once again there has been a great
[1:37:53] number of casualties spiritual
[1:37:56] casualties
[1:37:57] in this greatest war ever fought the
[1:37:59] greatest battle ever fought but god has
[1:38:01] once again
[1:38:02] raised up a man from kentucky 100 miles
[1:38:06] away and a hundred years apart from
[1:38:09] abraham lincoln
[1:38:10] abraham lincoln was born in hodgenville
[1:38:13] and whereas abraham lincoln moved into
[1:38:16] the highest political office in the land
[1:38:20] our abraham lincoln
[1:38:23] brother random if you can just stay with
[1:38:25] me on this a minute moved into the
[1:38:27] highest spiritual office in the land
[1:38:32] so the comparisons continue
[1:38:34] not only a hundred years later was he
[1:38:37] born and a hundred years apart
[1:38:39] but
[1:38:40] he moved into the highest spiritual
[1:38:43] office in the land just like that one
[1:38:46] abraham lincoln moved into the highest
[1:38:48] natural position of leadership
[1:38:50] william branham moved into the highest
[1:38:52] spiritual position in the land which was
[1:38:55] god's prophet to the last church age and
[1:38:58] he brought
[1:39:00] an emancipation proclamation
[1:39:02] he rocked a proclaiming of freedom to
[1:39:06] the bride of christ church he brought
[1:39:08] the acceptable year he brought the year
[1:39:11] of jubilee
[1:39:13] to the blood of jesus christ
[1:39:17] he brought it to the bride as a whole
[1:39:20] but you and i have to receive it as
[1:39:23] individuals
[1:39:24] oh it's good that we can come to church
[1:39:27] where he's brought that great
[1:39:28] proclaiming of freedom but you have to
[1:39:31] receive it in yourself

[1:41:08] the bride has been set free
[1:41:10] from
[1:41:11] personalities that would do away with

[1:41:45] was her pastor just the same and you
[1:41:47] know what

[1:41:56] need to be careful
[1:41:58] your pastor he may speak words that
[1:42:02] affect you
[1:42:03] and if you're not even maybe you don't

[1:43:24] brought
[1:43:25] she too
[1:43:27] can go free
[1:43:28] we all know the story
[1:43:30] of the slave who was brought
[1:43:32] to america
[1:43:34] and they took him to the
[1:43:36] big auction where they were auctioning
[1:43:38] off slaves
[1:43:40] and he didn't participate
[1:43:42] in all the
[1:43:44] the
[1:43:45] games and the gambling of the other
[1:43:47] slaves as they were waiting
[1:43:50] to be
[1:43:51] uh put on the auction block
[1:43:53] he sat alone
[1:43:55] and
[1:43:55] the slave owners noticed him and they
[1:43:58] went to his owner and they said
[1:44:00] tell us about that slave why is he
[1:44:02] different why is he different
[1:44:05] we want to buy that slave and the owner
[1:44:07] wouldn't sell him he said
[1:44:09] well he said what is it that sets him
[1:44:11] apart he said because
[1:44:14] in his home country
[1:44:16] his father is a king
[1:44:20] and he's been taught
[1:44:22] to present himself
[1:44:23] as a king
[1:44:25] he knows that someday
[1:44:27] he's going to inherit the kingdom
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:30] no we can't sell that one
[1:44:33] he knows who he is
[1:44:36] he's had a revelation of who he is
[1:44:39] and someday
[1:44:40] he's going back
[1:44:42] to inherit
[1:44:43] every part of that kingdom
[1:44:50] church
[1:44:52] we are
[1:44:53] we have
[1:44:54] a king as a father
[1:44:58] we
[1:44:59] are to inherit
[1:45:00] many promises of god
[1:45:03] but we have to know who we are church we
[1:45:05] have to conduct ourselves as children of
[1:45:08] a king
[1:45:10] you come to church you dress different
[1:45:12] than the world comes to church
[1:45:16] you talk different than the
[1:45:18] denominational churches
[1:45:20] you walk different
[1:45:22] why because you're the child of a king
[1:45:25] and you know someday
[1:45:27] you're gonna rule
[1:45:28] and reign in royalty
[1:45:32] i say praise god
[1:45:34] praise god
[1:45:36] for a group of people who know who their
[1:45:38] father is and they know that their
[1:45:40] father is the king of kings and the lord
[1:45:43] of lords
[1:45:44] and we will conduct ourselves
[1:45:47] as children of a king
[1:45:50] we will know
[1:45:52] who we are
[1:45:53] without a shadow of a doubt
[1:45:56] church
[1:45:56] we must know
[1:45:58] who we are
[1:46:00] where we're going
[1:46:01] and what we are to do
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] in this great battle of the mind
[1:46:09] if the bride
[1:46:10] can accept the pardon
[1:46:13] that's been given
[1:46:15] through that seven seal message
[1:46:17] she
[1:46:18] and the individuals
[1:46:20] in that bride can go free
[1:46:23] now when abraham lincoln
[1:46:25] set those negro saves free
[1:46:28] he was very
[1:46:30] specific
[1:46:32] he set forth
[1:46:33] a certain day
[1:46:35] in the emancipation proclamation speech
[1:46:38] when those slaves could go free
[1:46:43] in the message letting off the pressure
[1:46:46] brother branham said
[1:46:47] i was reading some time ago
[1:46:49] about the emancipation proclamation it
[1:46:51] was a time when they had slavery down
[1:46:52] south those slaves had been whipped they
[1:46:54] had been beaten and they had been abused
[1:46:57] church history itself tells us these
[1:46:59] things
[1:47:00] but when the emancipation proclamation
[1:47:02] was signed
[1:47:04] it was specific
[1:47:06] it set forth a certain day
[1:47:09] and that certain day
[1:47:11] was january the 1st
[1:47:12] 1863
[1:47:15] and it said at the rising of the sun
[1:47:19] at the rising of the sun
[1:47:21] stay with me now all those slaves could
[1:47:24] go free
[1:47:26] all of those poor decrepit heartbeaten
[1:47:29] slaves were so anxious to go free they
[1:47:33] were excited they were so glad to be
[1:47:35] able to go free that the strongest of
[1:47:38] them stay with me now the strongest of
[1:47:40] them
[1:47:41] of those slaves climbed to the top of
[1:47:43] the mountain
[1:47:46] on that special day
[1:47:48] and the night before that special day
[1:47:51] they would go up to the top of the
[1:47:53] mountain
[1:47:54] on the last day of 1862 because they
[1:47:58] knew at the rising of the sun on january
[1:48:01] 1st 1863 they could go free they wanted
[1:48:05] to be the first ones to see the rising
[1:48:07] of the sun so the strongness among them
[1:48:10] they climbed to the mountaintop and they
[1:48:12] wanted they waited
[1:48:15] for the first streaks of the rising of
[1:48:18] the sun
[1:48:20] why because they were excited about
[1:48:23] going free i believe i'm looking at some
[1:48:26] of god's people who have climbed up the
[1:48:28] mountain because they want to go free
[1:48:31] they want to see the rising of the s-o-n
[1:48:35] not the s-u-n but the rising of the
[1:48:37] s-o-n
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:42] brother and said the strongest of them
[1:48:43] slaves climbed to the top of the
[1:48:45] mountain some not quite so strong
[1:48:47] climbed part way up the mountain
[1:48:50] then the weaker ones some of the women
[1:48:52] and the children they were still down in
[1:48:54] the valley
[1:48:56] but the great big strong
[1:48:58] husky ones
[1:48:59] they climbed all the way to the top of
[1:49:01] the mountain and they were up there long
[1:49:03] before daybreak
[1:49:06] they wanted to see
[1:49:07] the first rays
[1:49:09] of the rising of the sun
[1:49:12] they wanted to go free
[1:49:14] and they looked
[1:49:15] and they looked
[1:49:16] until they began to see the first
[1:49:19] streaks of the rising of the sun
[1:49:22] oh they were on that mountaintop
[1:49:25] but you know what it was still dark
[1:49:27] halfway down the mountain
[1:49:29] it was still dark down in the valley
[1:49:34] but there was some
[1:49:36] that wanted
[1:49:37] to see
[1:49:38] the first
[1:49:39] rays of the rising of the throne brother
[1:49:41] random said the strong ones on the top
[1:49:43] of the mountain
[1:49:45] they saw the first streaks of the rising
[1:49:49] of the sun there on the mountaintop and
[1:49:51] they begin to shout
[1:49:53] we are free we are free
[1:49:56] we are free
[1:49:59] halfway down the mountain
[1:50:01] it was still dark they hadn't seen the
[1:50:03] first rays of the rising of the sun
[1:50:06] but they heard the shout
[1:50:09] they heard the shower one
[1:50:11] they heard the shout we are free and
[1:50:14] they
[1:50:15] begin to shout we are free we are free
[1:50:18] it was still dark in their life they
[1:50:21] were still dark in their situation and
[1:50:24] their circumstances
[1:50:26] but they heard the shout
[1:50:27] have you heard the shout today
[1:50:30] there's a shout in the land
[1:50:35] and those down halfway down the side of
[1:50:38] the mountain they begin to shout we are
[1:50:40] free we are free well
[1:50:43] down in the valley where some of the
[1:50:45] weaker ones were some of the women and
[1:50:46] the children it was still pitch dark
[1:50:49] down there
[1:50:50] but they heard the shout
[1:50:52] the shout was relayed down to halfway
[1:50:54] the mountain and the shout was relayed
[1:50:57] down into the valley and they begin to
[1:50:59] shout we are free we are free hallelujah
[1:51:03] we are free
[1:51:05] glory
[1:51:07] are you free this morning
[1:51:11] are you free
[1:51:14] if you're not free
[1:51:16] you can go free this morning
[1:51:18] you can be set free
[1:51:20] glory to god
[1:51:22] glory with god
[1:51:23] we are free we are free
[1:51:26] it is the rising of the sun
[1:51:29] the sun is rising and we are free
[1:51:32] we are free and the shout went down the
[1:51:35] mountain and the ones part of the way
[1:51:36] down the mountain they heard the shout
[1:51:38] they picked it up and relayed it down
[1:51:40] the mountain into the valley and they
[1:51:42] were crying we are free we are free and
[1:51:44] so it was
[1:51:45] it was still dark where some of them
[1:51:47] were out
[1:51:49] but they heard the shout out oh my
[1:51:53] there's been a shout today church
[1:51:55] [Music]
[1:51:56] i believe that's the reason you're in
[1:51:57] this church and not in some big mega
[1:52:00] church not in some denomination because
[1:52:03] there has been a shout that's come and
[1:52:05] that shout said you can go free

[1:52:35] you can choose to say i don't know about
[1:52:37] that stuff
[1:52:38] but i believe i'm looking at a group of
[1:52:40] people who believes to shout they've
[1:52:42] heard the shout they believe the shout
[1:52:45] and they believe that they may still
[1:52:47] have dark circumstances in their life
[1:52:49] they may have dark situations in their
[1:52:51] life but they have heard the shout and
[1:52:53] they're ready to shout they're ready to
[1:52:55] dance hallelujah

[1:55:39] he said i'm so glad of it
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:43] but remember church
[1:55:45] it was after
[1:55:46] the greatest battle ever fought
[1:55:49] when it was over
[1:55:51] and when you and i
[1:55:53] can gain the victory
[1:55:55] in our greatest battle ever fought
[1:55:57] the battle of the mind many of us have
[1:56:00] been there
[1:56:01] we've we've fought that battle
[1:56:04] you know i can remember as a teenager
[1:56:06] there seeing all these miracles that
[1:56:07] brother random did and you know i've
[1:56:09] testified i can testify for three hours
[1:56:11] about all the the miracles i've seen not
[1:56:13] things i've read in a book or heard on
[1:56:15] the tape but things i've seen with my
[1:56:16] own eyes
[1:56:17] and i had to fight a battle
[1:56:19] who was this man because there was
[1:56:21] people that saying that was jesus christ
[1:56:24] and i fought that battle i think anybody
[1:56:26] who's seen those things have fought a
[1:56:28] battle
[1:56:29] but i had to come to the realization and
[1:56:31] the revelation that this man was not
[1:56:33] virgin born
[1:56:35] this man there was no way
[1:56:37] there was no way he could be god
[1:56:39] he was a man he was a prophet of god
[1:56:42] with the word of god and when he spoke
[1:56:44] the word it set people free
[1:56:49] but when you can gain victory
[1:56:52] and maybe your battle of the mind was
[1:56:54] different i don't know but when you can
[1:56:56] gain victory over the battle of the mind
[1:56:59] that greatest battle ever fought
[1:57:01] then you too

[1:57:19] we too
[1:57:21] can know
[1:57:22] the acceptable year the year of jubilee

[1:58:06] the mountain
[1:58:08] we heard the message we heard the shout

[1:58:27] the valley of indecision they're in the
[1:58:30] valley of doubt they're in the valley of
[1:58:32] fear they're in the valley of
[1:58:35] no finances
[1:58:39] but revelation 22 and 17 says
[1:58:43] the spirit
[1:58:44] and the bride say come
[1:58:46] church if you're part of the bride you
[1:58:49] have to find those that are still weak

[1:59:21] maybe you've got a part to play to get
[1:59:23] them to see it
[1:59:24] but if they
[1:59:26] can hear the shout
[1:59:28] and if they can believe the report from

[2:01:07] received
[2:01:08] her emancipation
[2:01:10] proclamation

[2:02:30] 40-year denominational person about what
[2:02:33] god has done
[2:02:35] and they're going to blast you pretty
[2:02:36] good

[2:02:39] as the bride of christ we can know these
[2:02:41] things and we can rejoice in these
[2:02:44] things

[2:02:47] bridegroom has whispered to us
[2:02:50] through the great love letter that
[2:02:52] christ sent to us
[2:02:54] you know there was a time in jericho
[2:02:56] when rahab had her family there
[2:03:00] and two spies came and they talked to
[2:03:03] her
[2:03:04] and they gave her a secret
[2:03:08] the rest of jericho knew nothing about
[2:03:10] the secret but she knew the secret
[2:03:13] and that secret
[2:03:16] saved her life
[2:03:18] you and i
[2:03:20] have been given a secret this morning
[2:03:22] the bride of christ has received a
[2:03:24] secret
[2:03:25] and that secret has set us free

[2:03:31] about the secret but you and i know
[2:03:33] about the secret
[2:03:35] this secret will set us free this secret
[2:03:39] will spare our life and this secret
[2:03:42] the world doesn't want to know anything
[2:03:44] about it
[2:03:47] but we know the secrets that the
[2:03:49] bridegroom has whispered to his bride
[2:03:52] through the great love letter that

[2:05:50] mountain mount rushmore by man
[2:05:54] william branham had his face carved in a
[2:05:55] mountain by god on mount sunset
[2:05:58] i've been there i've seen it i can show
[2:05:59] you a picture of it
[2:06:03] abraham lincoln sounded liberty through
[2:06:05] the emancipa emancipation proclamation
[2:06:07] for the negro slaves in 1863.
[2:06:10] william brandon william branham sounded
[2:06:12] liberty for the bride of christ through
[2:06:14] those seven seals in 1963.
[2:06:17] church
[2:06:19] the world knows nothing about it
[2:06:21] they don't want to know you try to tell
[2:06:23] them and they're going to laugh at you
[2:06:25] they're going to mock you they're going
[2:06:26] to make fun of you oh it means nothing
[2:06:28] that's just coincidence is it
[2:06:31] is it
[2:06:32] do you know who you are
[2:06:34] if you know who you are these things
[2:06:36] mean something to you
[2:06:40] praise the lord praise the lord
[2:06:42] hallelujah
[2:06:43] amen
[2:06:46] those slaves
[2:06:47] had a jubilee year
[2:06:49] in 1863
[2:06:51] 100 years later in 1963 after the
[2:06:55] natural slaves were set free in 1863
[2:06:58] god's bride was set free if you can
[2:07:00] receive it this morning
[2:07:02] our abraham lincoln told us that if
[2:07:05] america had accepted this gospel message
[2:07:07] this emancipation proclamation in 1956
[2:07:11] she would have no more need of doctors
[2:07:12] or hospitals
[2:07:14] but america as a nation
[2:07:16] they rejected
[2:07:17] the spiritual proclamation of freedom
[2:07:21] she rejected her pardon
[2:07:24] and a pardon
[2:07:25] is only a pardon
[2:07:27] if it is received as a pardon
[2:07:29] and i know most of you probably know the
[2:07:31] story
[2:07:32] of the soldier in the civil war he was a
[2:07:35] young man he never been in the war
[2:07:37] before he never had to carry a rifle and
[2:07:40] shoot people before
[2:07:42] and he ended up
[2:07:43] going awol
[2:07:45] he left the army
[2:07:47] and they caught him
[2:07:49] and they
[2:07:50] were going to
[2:07:51] try him
[2:07:52] as a deserter
[2:07:56] and he had a friend
[2:08:00] who when they sentenced him to die
[2:08:03] he had a friend
[2:08:04] who said to him
[2:08:06] look
[2:08:08] i'm going to go see abraham lincoln
[2:08:11] i'm going to get him to write you a
[2:08:12] pardon
[2:08:14] and you'll be set free
[2:08:17] so the
[2:08:18] friend went to see abraham lincoln
[2:08:21] and he asked him and told him the story
[2:08:24] about the young man he was just a boy
[2:08:27] away from home and kind of sheltered all
[2:08:29] his life and he was just scared to death
[2:08:31] and he he didn't
[2:08:34] he really wasn't against the north
[2:08:36] but he just uh
[2:08:38] he just had to get out of there he said
[2:08:41] mr lincoln could you sign a pardon for
[2:08:44] this young man
[2:08:46] and abraham lincoln just took a little
[2:08:47] scrap of paper
[2:08:49] and he wrote ah abraham lincoln pardoned
[2:08:52] and gave the boy's name
[2:08:54] and the friend rushed back to his friend
[2:08:56] and he gave him the note he said look
[2:08:58] look he said the president has signed a
[2:09:01] pardon for you right here he said
[2:09:03] and the man who had been sentenced to
[2:09:05] die he looked at it and he said
[2:09:08] you're mocking me he said
[2:09:10] abraham lincoln didn't sign that he said
[2:09:12] if it was a pardon from abraham lincoln
[2:09:15] he would put it on official white house
[2:09:16] stationery he said you're just mocking
[2:09:18] me you're just making me
[2:09:20] and he rejected the pardon
[2:09:22] he had the pardon but he rejected the
[2:09:25] pardon
[2:09:26] so they
[2:09:28] put the boy to death
[2:09:29] and his friend wasn't ready to give up
[2:09:32] he saw an attorney
[2:09:34] and he
[2:09:35] explained to him what happened he said
[2:09:37] look they put this boy to death and he
[2:09:39] said i i
[2:09:41] i had a pardon for him right here
[2:09:44] and they went ahead and put him to death
[2:09:46] and according to the prophet of god it
[2:09:48] went to the highest court in the land
[2:09:50] and the supreme court looked the matter
[2:09:52] investigated the matter
[2:09:53] and they said
[2:09:55] the government did nothing wrong
[2:09:57] because
[2:09:58] a pardon is only a pardon if you receive
[2:10:02] it as a pardon amen and he said the
[2:10:04] young man didn't receive the pardon
[2:10:07] now how about you and i today there's
[2:10:09] been a pardon given from sin there's
[2:10:12] been a pardon given from denominational
[2:10:14] slavery
[2:10:15] are you going to accept the pardon
[2:10:17] but you know this pardon came from a
[2:10:20] little old kentuckian who didn't know
[2:10:22] how to speak properly he he misspoke all
[2:10:24] of his words he he was poor he was
[2:10:27] uneducated
[2:10:28] and there's many people that rejected
[2:10:30] the pardon because they said oh no if it
[2:10:33] was god's prophet he would come in a
[2:10:35] mighty way in a jet airplane with the
[2:10:38] best suits and the best clothes the best
[2:10:40] cars and they rejected the pardon
[2:10:43] but there's a group of people on the
[2:10:44] face of the earth who did not reject the
[2:10:46] party i believe i'm looking at one of
[2:10:47] the groups of people today we did not
[2:10:49] reject the pardon we saw it as a pardon
[2:10:51] we saw it as truth we saw it as what god
[2:10:53] has done in this generation and we've
[2:10:55] accepted it
[2:10:57] we've reveled in it
[2:10:58] we've we've taken it it's been part of
[2:11:01] our life
[2:11:02] this pardon is what i live for this
[2:11:05] pardon is what brought me to this place
[2:11:08] today this pardon is gonna take me to
[2:11:11] glory someday
[2:11:13] and this pardon
[2:11:15] if you can accept this party if you can
[2:11:17] receive this party as a pardon
[2:11:20] god has a place for you
[2:11:22] you and i will rule and reign
[2:11:25] in royalty
[2:11:27] we just have to accept the pardon as
[2:11:30] it's been given
[2:11:32] amen
[2:11:33] our abraham lincoln
[2:11:35] told us
[2:11:37] that america
[2:11:38] could be
[2:11:39] going free from sickness and doctors and
[2:11:41] hospitals she would have no more need of
[2:11:43] those things but america as a nation
[2:11:47] rejected her spiritual pardon her
[2:11:49] spiritual proclaiming of freedom she
[2:11:51] rejected that pardon
[2:11:53] and she did not receive it as a pardon
[2:11:56] but the proclaiming of freedom has come
[2:11:58] church
[2:11:59] and the true bride will accept the
[2:12:02] proclaiming of freedom this morning
[2:12:04] the true ride will know who she is and
[2:12:07] she will recognize truth she will
[2:12:09] recognize the truth of the pardon she
[2:12:12] will recognize the truth of the shout
[2:12:14] she will recognize the truth of the
[2:12:16] message we are free we are free
[2:12:20] she will be victorious
[2:12:23] the bride
[2:12:24] has received the acceptable year the
[2:12:27] year of jubilee in 1963 at the opening
[2:12:31] of the seal

[2:13:20] brought the highest and best price
[2:13:23] brother brandon said no
[2:13:25] the man said it was the prettiest
[2:13:27] healthiest young black girl that they
[2:13:30] could find
[2:13:31] they would want to take that prettiest
[2:13:33] young girl
[2:13:34] and breed her to the biggest strongest
[2:13:36] man
[2:13:37] the man told brother random he said i
[2:13:39] think that's terrible he said it's
[2:13:40] horrible

[2:13:43] he told brother and he said i hope those
[2:13:44] slave owners
[2:13:46] souls
[2:13:47] fry in hell
[2:13:51] brother branham said
[2:13:52] i looked at that man
[2:13:54] and i said sir
[2:13:55] that may be true
[2:13:57] but what about your soul this morning
[2:14:02] brother brahm said i told him
[2:14:04] you have been given a pardon for the
[2:14:06] sins
[2:14:07] and the bad things that you have done in
[2:14:09] your life
[2:14:10] but have you
[2:14:11] accepted the pardon
[2:14:14] brother branham said a few days later
[2:14:16] a pastor friend of his
[2:14:18] baptized that man in the name of jesus
[2:14:20] christ
[2:14:22] church tonight

[2:14:29] healthiest
[2:14:30] young spiritual woman that there ever
[2:14:33] was
[2:14:34] that would be the bride of christ
[2:14:37] satan wants to take the bride of christ
[2:14:40] this most beautiful bride
[2:14:42] and put her on the auction block
[2:14:45] and sell her
[2:14:46] to the highest bidder

[2:14:50] and sell her to the man or the preacher
[2:14:54] with the most false doctrine are you
[2:14:56] with me
[2:14:57] he would like to take her and ravage her
[2:15:00] and pervert her from god's original plan
[2:15:03] but we know he can't do it
[2:15:06] we know that the bride cannot be
[2:15:09] deceived
[2:15:10] she will be victorious
[2:15:12] she is an overcomer
[2:15:14] by her testimony and the blood of the
[2:15:17] lamb
[2:15:18] she has overcome
