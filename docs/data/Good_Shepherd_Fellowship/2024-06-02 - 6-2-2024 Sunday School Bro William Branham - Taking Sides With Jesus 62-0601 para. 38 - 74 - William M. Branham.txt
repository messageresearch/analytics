[Music] [Music] well if I thought that there was a denomination or any other group of Believers that had anything better than we have here Brethren I would I want to emerge this little body with it right quick I waited I have longed I have been under anticipations and believe that some great one was coming someday maybe the great prophet that a speak will come of the Elijah I've always believed and thought maybe that maybe I'd live to see the day that when I could change when I'd see that person rise on the scene then I could take my little church and say Brethren this is the man we have looked for this man he is the on I've waited for that and if actually that has passed then I'm looking to say it from up here Brethren this is the one coming from here see and uh I want to see the church kept up like that I must have stepped on something or done something and put a lot of uh more uh life in that thing so um now I would like to say this that now that this is an established church let me just stop again just a moment when I went to Bombay I count that my greatest meeting because of the effects it had on the people and I if in Africa they say 30,000 came to Christ at one time then there was 150 or 200,000 came to Christ at one time out of about half a million there what could I do there wasn't a thing perhaps maybe say there was just say there's 100,000 of them there was no church nothing I could do there's nobody to give to them the message I believe I there wasn't even a Pentecostal denomination would cooperate with me and all those Souls probably drifted right back into seeks Jans Buddhism whatever more they come from no place to put them now that's a shame yeah that's a disgrace see because I had no cooperation because of the stand that I take well in Africa I went in there under that oaces of the uh the AF ofm and African Faith missions and what I did of course I can't agree with them they they baptize people in a trium baptism three times face forward and one of them baptizes three times backwards one for one God the Father other for another God the son the other for another God the Holy Ghost and baptizing three different times for three different gods and all such stuff as that and perhaps the Durban meeting not having it rightly and the people see such a scattered amongst the Pentecostal faiths and so forth the people didn't know what to do they had no place to go perhaps what if we just had a Revival here brotherr let me place it like this what if we just got through with a big Revival and you Brethren had just got converted and there wasn't a church of this type in the country nowhere and I've been the Evangelist and now I'm leaving out you may never see me again what would you do you'd feel like you wouldn't know what to do you can't go back to that Waller again you can't go back down there with uh with your wives to wear shorts and your and uh to your card parties and dances and things like that and ever be satisfied again you've come to life you've raised above that thing you've come to a place instead of saying this is our Creed saying this is God's word and you've come to live by this what this says and not what and you go down there and listen to them and hear them go down play bunk hole and have a dance and this that and the other a little bit of message that had nothing in it about some mayor or something or was going to be reelected or some kind of a political Affair and cut off in 10 or 15 minutes after you've been sitting here day after day in great gastronomical jubilees of the word and things you wouldn't know what to do you'd be so burdened with it that some of you lay members would feel like starting up a church and start preaching it yourself because your heart would burn for the word of God and you'd feel bad for the people that felt the same way you did isn't that right though you know Jesus is coming thought he was coming tomorrow yet you'd want to do something today for those people who are fellow citizens of the kingdom of God to come together you want fellowship with them that's right so if it's this way uh I believe with all my heart that the Lord has helped me and has used me to spearhead a great Revival one of the greatest that's ever struck the world since the early days across the world we know that that's right it's all gone at that time and and he met me down there on the river and told me that the message that I had would forerun the second coming of Christ and I suppose there's nobody here tonight that was down there that day that's been 32 years ago when that light appeared and standing there me looking right at it hundreds of people standing looking at it he come right down and that Bo spoke years later strains at the camera takes the same picture looks the same thing just exactly what I told you down the river now I may be mistaken in a lot of things Brethren but I don't want to be a hypocrite I want to be honest and straight with you and then another thing if I have went away what would would have never build a church here like that it's hard to tell what would had see if I just went on but the god of Heaven put it up on my heart to build this church here and then when he called me out into evangelism we've had Pastor after pastor and so forth but now we got a a precious brother here who's uh of the faith believes a message we've got other brothers out here that's believes a message having fa am I getting too loud brother beer all right let's see um have uh we got we got the material and now you say well brother brandom if they want hear these signs and wonders of the great God Of Heaven how we going to do it well now what if St Paul would have had that same idea see what but they didn't those Bishops stayed just as loyal to the message and they and Paul ever so often after making his round you read the Bible how you visit back with these churches talk with the pastors and with the Bishops and so forth and took uh relief from the people and and had a oh just a great time of Fellowship like a Revival or a big time of Jubilee and the Holy Spirit would fall upon them and messages to come look when he went down there to Philip even his daughters prophesied and said these chains and prison waiting for the for our brother when he gets up there you no more and got out in the yard and here come acus a prophet walking down looked across the street and never seen seen Paul before the general overseer this whole group of churches throughout Asia and he walked there and pulled the string off of his side he had his garment tied with bound his hands and said thus sayeth the Lord chains and prisons wait for the one that wore this up there see prophesying Paul said I know it I know it but don't break my heart now let me finish my course he was tired he was finished and he was going on and leaving this bishoy with Timothy now we got to think of young people we got children most of us people you're a married man has children what about them it's coming on see like I used to kick up down there about him throwing those cast Nets on the river and pulling out them perch and the drinks drunkards and things I've seen them piled high is this ceiling here big Vine perch laying there just stink could be all around the river I went out as a game board and make him stop it I got a letter leave him alone why do you go to do it belongs to Kentucky now Kentucky Warden can't come over here because he's out of his territory Indiana Warden has nothing to say into it because the water belongs to Kentucky there you are there's nothing can be done I said I've got a boy coming on we like the fish why they put his picture in the paper if he caught a chub 20 years now let that go on like that those Nets traps and everything else it's practically getting like that right now see what's the matter you've got to think of these that's coming on so we' got to think of the others that's coming on behind us these young people and so forth and a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world and these things like that we want them girls raised like their mothers and we've got to make arrangements for them and if there is no tomorrow we don't know that if there is no tomorrow we haven't done nothing but been at the Master's business and been found at our post of Duty when he does come see so I would suggest this I did to brother Neville let's carry this on just as we have let's let it just the way it is I'm grateful for these young ministers see actually at the day of judgment for this entire Valley through here there'll be no excuse because we've got little churches setting out everywhere Outpost listening post waiting that's not as in Brothers church and ask if all in there was 45 behind the word in every hand went up now that made me feel good see now what I would think would be this Brethren that like in the church here now I the my Ministry has the best amount of thinking four things that can be done and it might not be either four that's the only Outlook I can think of if that one is spoke to me down there on the river if this is all all that was left for the Gentile Church which we realize in Revelations it says 1 2 three chapters to the church the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return anymore to the 19th Chapter that's after the tribulation period when God calls out the Jews that's right and like Enoch he went up before one drop or rain ever hit the earth it was gone then the tribulation set in no Noah was in the ark before any tribulation set in lot was out of Sodom before any tribulation set in see and the church will be gone before any tribulation period now during the tribulation that will be the sleeping virgin will be hunted down by the dragon that spurts water from his mouth which it means multitudes and people armies that'll search down and take this woman woman uh uh remnant of her seed and will kill her now that will be in the tribulation period but the church will go home now if if that take would take place tomorrow it wouldn't hinder miskeeping on today let's make today count now what I think down there if that angel that said those words to me said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ see your message I to take this message and it would forerun the second coming of Christ well if this has been it and we're real real close Breen because the our and the light of the message just about gone out did you know notice when Pentecost fell and those Brothers was filled at Pentecost with the Holy Ghost it wasn't hardly any time until the message had begin to dim down and they begin to set up churches to hold a fort for Christ expecting him to come that's the same thing is taking place today if the scripture is true I will restore sayeth the Lord all that the Palmer worm and cankerworm has eaten now if that be it if that is the message and God forgive me I I do not know if that's it then the time is close at hand really because the message is over and the other night I was dreaming that I went to have derer it where a great host of my friends together thousands of them in a meeting there's a fellow come got me and Billy usually comes gets me because you don't talk to me this man just talked to Blue Street and four I got over there all the anointing was gone from me for and then I said I'll just go there and preach the message of telling those people don't fool those denominations and so forth and come out like this and when I got to the platform that had left me I don't know what it meant but I going on I just don't know it could be the end of my road it could be the coming of the Lord it could be the change of the day it could be the coming of that mighty one if it's to be another besides what's already come it could be that all those things we'd have to draw from it would be and as I stand here tonight before God and you Brethren I don't know I couldn't tell you if I did i' tell you or I wouldn't mention bring anything up like this if it didn't know which way if I know which way the thing was going i' I'd say it but I don't know I can't tell I'm going right now on meetings without one Speck of leading I'm going because I don't want to set up there I I I like to get out in the woods as well as anybody if I'm wrong in this God forgiv me there's three things could happen to me it's either the end of my road and let this other one come on I've opened up the road for him to take over work calls remember the one that comes to preach will be on the word restoring the faith of the children back to the fathers it could be the end of my road it could be that he's changing my Ministry back into evangelism for overseas or it could be that he's not going to call me anymore for an evangelist and he's taking me into the Wilderness somewhere to anoint me to send me forth like the promised one is to come I think there could be any of those things I cannot go on the way I've been going because I'm the people has believed me I I have to say this I said before man that people many times regard me as being a prophet I do not regard myself that no sir I do not I have I don't say that to be humble I say that to be truthful I do not regard myself to be a prophet of the Lord I I haven't that honor I believe that the Lord has used me and little special things to help maybe lay a foundation for a prophet it will come but a prophet doesn't operate the way I operate now you know that a prophet isn't an evangelist and an evangelist isn't a prophet a pastor isn't a evangelist and a evangelist isn't a pastor but God has set in the church first apostles then prophets then teachers then pastors and so forth God set them in the church and God gave them an office but the morning when I laid that Cornerstone because now if you're spiritual you get it because of the Cry of the people if you could break that out or take the book and read it it said do the work of an evangelist didn't call me to be evangelist but said do the work of an evangelist for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but for Heap themselves together teachers having itch and ear and shall turn from truth to fables see quoted that scripture and told me where to find it said it three times and I got the Bible and turned to where he told me and there it was and now you know about the two buckets of the Pentecostal Oneness and the Pentecostal assemblies I never crossed them I planted their own trees right where they were C I think they're both wrong but out of it I was at the cross at the Harvest God respects anybody who's sincere Peter said that he perceived that God was no respect of person all nations calling when on got the house of Cornelius when they receive the Holy Ghost like they did at the beginning see God is no respected person we see a person deeply and sincere he can be sincerely wrong but if he is sincerely God will lead him to the light somewhere he'll come to it because God's obligated to do that and we' think about the coming of the Lord being such a a great thing and the message no more than it's went remember there's a predestinated group to be here when the Lord returns and it might not be over a dozen we don't know it might be 100 million might be 10,000 but if the predestinated will hear the message and believe it if it's the message s of God which we believe it to be now here we are then right up here to the end of the time when if God did call me now listen this is not to be repeated if he did call me to be his Prophet then I'm certainly not holding the office of one prophets don't evangelize a prophet hides himself in the wilderness alone with God until he gets exactly directly what God wants him to do and he Stomps right out and gives his message and back into the Wilderness he goes again he's not an evangelist holding meetings and getting cooperations all these things like evangelist do he don't teach like evangelist he has thus sayith the Lord and that's it and that's all he gives it throws it out and let the chips fall where it will and then way goes again nobody knows where he's at he's in isolation somewhere now I cannot or if he's called me to be that I cannot be an evangelist and if he's called me to be evangelist I cannot be a prophet how you get what I mean I don't know what to do I've done reverently when he told me first about me holding the people's hand and praying for them then know the secret of their heart and all these different things and Brethren that's infallible you know that's to be the truth every one of you knows that see and how he told me it would blast across the world and it's done it just exactly every nation under the heavens is heard everywhere newspapers tape recordings everywhere I don't know how it's ever done it but throughout all the world letters coming in and people from way down in Pand in the Hot Tops back in there how those missionaries is crowded back in there with those tapes and giving that interpretation of the word and now we hear from all the world around the world now the the church is predestinated universally everywhere be two in the bed two in the field see take one and leave one now as I have done the work of an evangelist and here's my plea if that is pleasing to God and I've done the work all right trusting that I have pleased him asking forgiveness for all my mistakes then he may be calling me from the field of evangelism to be his Prophet then if it is I'll leave evangelism but if he calls me to be a a prophet I cannot be an evangelist if I'm to be evangelist I cannot be a prophet I'm mixing the two offices that's where I've always fussed about standing on the platform it's never been good successful God has used it but I've never thought it was his direct will it's been his permissive will stand on the platform a vision of two will knock you out almost see and then if you tell this person how to straighten hisself up and what to do and then the next person stands there he's expecting the same thing and you can't tell him unless something tells you to tell him and that the other people feel like you're a traitor or backslider or a demon or something because you don't tell them what they want to know see that's not the office the way a prophet operates a prophet stays back here till he Stomps out into the hospital or wherever he's going with thus sayeth the Lord and say and stomp back out again there's no evangelist at all you don't hold meetings and discuss things he's got the word of the Lord for whoever he sent to if he sent to the White House he stomped right up in front of the White House and thus sayeth the Lord if it's to the governor of the state whoever it is it's thus sayeth the Lord you don't fool around with a group of churches trying get them to come in and take the word and preach these things like evangelist he's not an evangelist so you see Brethren that's the reason I don't call myself a prophet I'm not even in the office of one see now you understand what I mean now there' be a lot going on like that for a long time but I hope to not take too much of your time until I get a little bit of this word I want to read tonight now here's what I'm doing I have never felt that I should live in Indiana I'm a I'm a rambler I don't I'll go one place I think I'll go over here and I'll settle down here this is it I can't do it when I go somewhere else I think I'll go over here want to do it my wife calls me what's that song they s about Restless wind you've heard it I guess most all of you hear saying well that's what she calls me Restless winds about time I get here I think boy I just got to get home I got to see the wife and kids I just got to go to church once more and preach I get here and come down reach once kiss my wife and hug all the kids get out the yard to cut the grass and the airplane goes over I stop wipe the sweat off my face and I want to go with him somewhere else I got to go well I think I got to go down there and I I go down there and I preach there a while look around there goes another one over I got to go with him see there's no settling down place for me I just can't do it I'm Restless shifting place to place something I can't help it it's something in me and I know that I'm a Ste it [Music] for
