[0:00] that's Becky's first time to play in
[0:02] church here so a very appropriate song
[0:05] when Jesus came so we are grateful to be
[0:10] here again tonight and so thankful for
[0:13] the your fine attendance this morning
[0:15] and now tonight is I got a little
[0:21] subject I want to talk on in a few
[0:23] moments but just before that I've got
[0:26] some announcements to make and things
[0:27] and I just a teeny bit hoarse think it's
[0:33] just the over speaking preached a long
[0:37] time but when I take these our two tapes
[0:40] and want to come back here it's because
[0:44] it I'm taping that for round the world
[0:48] and so thank you for being so patient
[0:54] with us this morning
[0:55] now there's a few things I would like to
[0:59] make mention of right here that is that
[1:02] I would like to ask the church the first
[1:07] thing something that I have have done
[1:14] and I'm I want to ask if I can change
[1:17] that tonight we're not I don't make New
[1:21] Year's vows and I'm we've got to go home
[1:24] tomorrow so we won't be here for New
[1:26] Year's too but we'll be remembering you
[1:28] not believe there'll be a meeting here
[1:30] New Year's night yes that's right a
[1:32] watch service as you always have on New
[1:34] Year's night we like stay but we just
[1:36] can't get back in time and it to get the
[1:39] kiddies in school and my wife's got to
[1:42] wash up their clothes you on so on I
[1:46] want to thank each one of you for your
[1:49] fine things that you did for us through
[1:51] Christmas and you women who went up
[1:52] there and put food in the house and
[1:54] things for us that when we got there
[1:56] there were stuff was already cooked and
[1:59] ready to eat I certainly thank you for
[2:01] that
[2:02] may God ever bless you and the church
[2:05] further a little ticket that I could go
[2:08] over here and and get some clothes if I
[2:12] wanted them for
[2:13] our suit they gave me a suit each year
[2:15] and some kind friends of mine just got
[2:18] me a suit so I think if so alright I
[2:22] need some other things like shirts and
[2:25] undershirts and things I'd like to take
[2:27] the money up and now if it's alright
[2:29] with the church we need that better no
[2:32] worse than I do the suit right at the
[2:34] time now this young fella that just sang
[2:38] for us brother George Smith from down in
[2:42] Tucson
[2:43] we've been going up to their church up
[2:45] there the New Testament Baptist Church
[2:48] his father is a missionary I think he
[2:51] has about seven churches down in Mexico
[2:54] and there's certainly some fine people
[2:57] there and his father and mother and all
[2:59] them are five people in George is very
[3:00] fine young man
[3:01] I was just sorry that he didn't give us
[3:03] a word of testimony but well before he
[3:05] sat down of the saving grace of Christ
[3:08] in his life and now the the messages I
[3:13] promise you're not long ago that the
[3:15] messages before I went out in the
[3:18] meetings I come here and tape them first
[3:20] and then go out that was because of
[3:23] getting the tapes to the people then I
[3:26] come here tape a message and then go out
[3:28] and preach it that give the people a
[3:30] chance to the tape makers to make the
[3:33] tape and take it with us as we win now
[3:36] I'm fixing to leave on a great strain of
[3:39] evangelistic tour so I won't be able to
[3:43] do that from now on see and the one who
[3:47] takes the tapes they'll just have to get
[3:48] them as we go along and I think after
[3:50] all aren't they having a meeting on
[3:52] tapes this week or something about
[3:53] something about the tapes this week
[3:55] anyhow thank brother sophomore this year
[3:57] and he represents brother my bar I don't
[4:00] know whether he's sure not I think for
[4:01] the fridge or somebody said he was here
[4:03] and he I think they're having a meeting
[4:07] this week maybe tomorrow night or some
[4:08] time about the tapes we just talked
[4:11] about the other night in the room there
[4:12] I think the time is up for something
[4:14] they take and make arrangements about it
[4:17] so from now on I'll probably just speak
[4:21] messages that I haven't touched here at
[4:23] the tabernacle out in the meeting
[4:26] and now I have want to be grateful to
[4:31] God for that testimony a brother Blair
[4:35] happens to be the brother sister Blair
[4:37] sitting right here tonight sitting right
[4:39] here before it's the one that had the
[4:41] little boy I remember when the Lord told
[4:45] me when he was brother Blair altura
[4:48] weeping his little boy got pushed in the
[4:52] face like this of a turned-over car and
[4:55] he was very bad but while I was a pre I
[4:59] saw the little fella alright and brother
[5:03] bear of course asked me said brother
[5:05] branham is this thus saith the Lord I
[5:07] said brother bear Blair it's thus saith
[5:10] the Lord and brother Blair is sure
[5:12] tonight and we're certainly thankful to
[5:15] have brother Blair with us and he's been
[5:17] suffering with a little trouble of
[5:20] nervousness and they can give him a
[5:22] great rap you're not long ago to try to
[5:24] get him to disbelieve me and while sait
[5:27] was doing that the Lord came right
[5:29] around reveal it to him and told him
[5:30] about it just to cut it off before that
[5:32] time come for this and brother Blair is
[5:36] a fine man and I want you to remember
[5:39] him he's kind halt between opinions on
[5:41] what to do he doesn't know just how to
[5:42] turn and I trust brother Blair that God
[5:45] your great servant of Christ and he's
[5:49] got plenty for you to do the lights are
[5:52] getting dim where you here this morning
[5:53] well that's very fine now now I suppose
[5:57] the next time I get to see maybe up in
[6:00] the spring a little bit and but that
[6:02] time maybe we'll know whether we're
[6:03] going to hold thee the meetings are not
[6:05] here at a Jeffersonville during your
[6:08] time that I should been in Norway and in
[6:11] the Scandinavian countries now just
[6:14] before we take it takes calls we got a
[6:16] prayer line coming up and many are
[6:18] standing their rooms and around the
[6:20] walls and so forth and I know you it's
[6:23] very hard on him and I stood him any
[6:26] time itself and I passed by a while ago
[6:28] bringing the wife down I notice the
[6:30] people around the doors and I thought
[6:33] who says the gospel still is the most
[6:36] attractive thing there is in the world
[6:38] sure is if it attracts those who are
[6:41] interested in it those who are not
[6:44] interested of course they don't they it
[6:46] won't be but Jesus if I said if I be
[6:49] lifted up from the earth I will draw all
[6:51] men unto me how true that is
[6:54] and when I get here there's just so much
[6:57] to say and I have to kind of jot down
[7:00] what I'm going to say here for a while
[7:01] or ah there's so much to say you just
[7:03] forget what you're going to say now I
[7:06] understand that brother Omron's father
[7:11] was baptized this morning in the name of
[7:14] Jesus Christ and if sister Omron and
[7:17] them are here I'm sure that's a great
[7:20] thing to them because that's been their
[7:22] constant prayer for many years and
[7:24] brother hunger and wherever you are God
[7:27] richly bless you my brother and if that
[7:30] isn't correct God make me answer for it
[7:33] at the day of the judgment
[7:34] I know it's correct I take the blame for
[7:38] that that's exactly right because it is
[7:41] the truth you say does it make any
[7:43] difference it did to Paul they asked how
[7:46] they've been baptized they said they'd
[7:48] already been baptized but John the man
[7:50] that baptized Jesus Paul said they had
[7:52] to come and be rebaptised again in the
[7:54] name of Jesus Christ and not one person
[7:57] in the Bible was ever baptized in the
[8:01] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[8:03] no people is ever baptized like after
[8:06] the organizing of the Catholic Church at
[8:08] the lai lai lai a seat of counsel at lea
[8:11] Rome that's where the first person was
[8:15] ever baptized using the titles a fellow
[8:18] said to me the other day I said well if
[8:20] the Lord Jesus that's his name he said
[8:24] well I said if a fellow come to you he
[8:26] said I don't think it makes any
[8:27] difference I just caught him in his own
[8:30] doctoring I said if a man come to you
[8:32] and said I am baptized in the name of
[8:34] the Rose of Sharon Lily LaValley in the
[8:37] morning star would you say amen to that
[8:39] he said no sir I said how would you
[8:42] would you rebaptised him said yes sir I
[8:44] said how would you baptize him he said
[8:47] I'll baptize
[8:49] in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost
[8:50] and I said that's the way i baptize you
[8:53] in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost
[8:56] I said now Rose of Sharon Lily Valley
[8:59] Morningstar is no name he said that's
[9:01] right it's a tide like this so his
[9:03] Father Son and Holy Ghost not baptize
[9:06] him in the name of the Father Son and
[9:07] Holy Ghost in the name of the Father Son
[9:09] and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:11] exactly so I say and he saw it if not it
[9:16] was brother Joseph Matson Bo's a of
[9:18] Chicago the hardest fellow I've ever had
[9:20] a breakthrough I suppose I've got around
[9:24] three or four thousand natives to
[9:25] baptize now I want to get over in Africa
[9:27] with Harry baptized over again now so
[9:33] we're grateful for the gospel light and
[9:36] so now Jesus said when he was sure on
[9:41] earth what I hear that I speak and I'm
[9:46] going to say just for a next about 10
[9:48] minutes or 15 just before taking the
[9:51] text in a very short text and then we'll
[9:53] have the prayer line I have come to a
[9:58] place in my ministry to where I've got
[10:04] to to say something and on Jesus said
[10:08] that what he heard that was what he
[10:11] spoke and he said I called you my
[10:14] friends and a friend tells his friends
[10:17] all things Paul said in acts 20:27 I
[10:22] have not shunned to declare to you the
[10:26] whole counsel of God
[10:27] then may I join in tonight and say the
[10:31] same thing with that great saint of old
[10:34] to the best of my knowledge I have not I
[10:38] have not shunned but declared to you the
[10:41] whole counsel of God someone explain him
[10:46] on the tapes of the day just because it
[10:48] made somebody angry they shot at him
[10:50] through the window and a woman wounded
[10:53] so perhaps some day I'll seal my
[10:56] testimony but when that time comes
[11:00] I'm ready to go until nighttime comes
[11:04] there's nothing gonna hurt me until that
[11:05] time now we believe in the same gospel
[11:09] just the way the Bible is written it's
[11:12] zeroed and and if the gun is exactly
[11:16] zeroed in in tune if it strikes the
[11:19] target the first time it will strike it
[11:21] the second time and every time if a tree
[11:24] or limb vine puts out a branch and that
[11:28] branch bears a certain fruit the next
[11:30] time the the vine puts out a branch it
[11:34] will bear the same kind of fruit and if
[11:37] Jesus is the vine and we are the
[11:39] branches and the first branch church
[11:42] that that bind put out they wrote a book
[11:45] of Acts behind it and that first branch
[11:49] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[11:53] they had the Living God among them that
[11:56] did the same things among them that he
[11:59] did when he was on earth therefore the
[12:01] people take a notice to them though
[12:02] ignorant and unlearn that they had been
[12:05] with Jesus because his life was through
[12:08] them as I've said if I had the spirit of
[12:11] a Beethoven in me I would write songs a
[12:13] bait if I if Beethoven lived with me I'd
[12:16] be Beethoven me a Shakespeare lived a me
[12:19] I'd be Shakespeare write poems and plays
[12:24] and so forth if Shakespeare lived in me
[12:26] if Christ lives in me the works of
[12:29] Christ you'll do it's got to be and what
[12:33] is Christ the word he said if ye abide
[12:36] me my wording you then s what you will
[12:40] it'll be done because the words are just
[12:43] needs the life and the light makes it
[12:45] live so now I am going to say something
[12:51] to you now that I haven't said all along
[12:54] that is the thing that we have looked
[12:58] forward to for so long or at least many
[13:02] years four or five years or maybe longer
[13:04] the third pull has now been vindicated
[13:07] and I'm sure you all know what it is now
[13:12] remember
[13:14] there will never be an impersonation of
[13:16] that cause it can't be
[13:17] it cannot be now it's in existent and I
[13:24] have I'm warned of this that soon right
[13:31] at this time now it's just happen so it
[13:34] could identify its presence among you
[13:38] see but it will not be used in a great
[13:42] way until this council begins to tighten
[13:47] up and when it does when that does the
[13:52] Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[13:54] impersonate anything can be done but
[13:57] when that time comes when the squeeze
[14:00] comes down then you'll see what you've
[14:02] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[14:05] fullness of its power now I must
[14:12] continue in evangelism just as I was
[14:16] commissioned first I must continue on
[14:18] therefore you've had the word and you
[14:22] know what to look for how to stand I
[14:25] must continue on in evangelism and
[14:28] friends of mine keep still and just keep
[14:33] moving on for the hour is approaching
[14:36] swiftly thing that when something is
[14:39] going to be done now you might see some
[14:43] little odd things happen from nothing
[14:47] sinful I don't mean that but I mean
[14:48] something odd to what the regular trend
[14:51] because for a reach to now in the
[14:54] ministry I'm dropping back here watching
[14:58] that spot and waiting for the time to
[15:01] use it but it's going to be used and
[15:06] everyone knows that far as certain as
[15:10] the first clause identified so has the
[15:14] second been identified and if you'll
[15:16] think real closely you are spiritual as
[15:20] the Bible say here's the a man has
[15:21] wisdom the third is properly a dinner
[15:24] we know where it is so the third pool is
[15:28] here it is so sacred that I'm mustn't
[15:31] say much about it as he told me in the
[15:33] beginning said this say nothing of it
[15:36] you remember that years ago it speaks
[15:39] for itself
[15:41] but - I've tried to explain the others
[15:43] not I made a mistake this will be the
[15:45] thing that - my opinion I don't say the
[15:48] Lord tells me this this will be the
[15:50] thing that will start the rapture and
[15:52] faith for the going away enter them
[15:55] obviously quite for just a little long
[15:58] now remember and who's listening to this
[16:00] tape you might see such a change in my
[16:02] ministry right away dropping back not
[16:05] going up dropping back we're right at
[16:07] the age now and it can't be can't go any
[16:09] further we have to wait just a minute
[16:11] until this happens over here to catch up
[16:14] then the time comes
[16:15] but it's thoroughly identified there's
[16:18] coming a time upon in this nation now
[16:22] where this nation is going to exercise
[16:24] all the power that the Beast had before
[16:27] it which is pagan Rome when it become
[16:29] papal Rome thing that's this nation will
[16:32] do that revelations 13 plainly explains
[16:36] it the lamb come up out of the earth the
[16:39] other beasts come up out of water
[16:40] thickness and multitudes of people this
[16:42] lamb come up where there was no people a
[16:43] lamb represents a religion the Lamb of
[16:48] God and remember it spoke like a lamb it
[16:52] was a lamb and then after a while it be
[16:55] received power and spoke like a dragon
[16:58] and extra sauce all the dragon power the
[17:03] dragon had before him and the dragon is
[17:05] Rome always so don't you see Roman
[17:10] denomination a mark Protestant
[17:14] denomination a image unto the Beast
[17:18] making a power that will force all
[17:20] Protestants like a union you'll have to
[17:23] be into this Council of Churches or you
[17:27] won't be able to have fellowship or -
[17:30] well it's it's practically that way now
[17:32] you can't go to a church and preach less
[17:35] you have a
[17:36] Oh shift card or some identification and
[17:38] now on persons like ourselves we're
[17:41] going to be cut out of all that all
[17:42] together
[17:43] that's exactly cuz they won't be able to
[17:45] do it it's tightening it and then when
[17:47] that time comes and the press comes to a
[17:50] place where you're pressed out then
[17:52] watch what I'm fixin to tell you a few
[17:54] minutes what's the third pull then and
[17:58] it'll be absolutely to the total lost
[18:00] but it it will be for the bride in the
[18:03] church now we're closer than it seems to
[18:06] me I don't go a win but it's real real
[18:10] close maybe building a platform for
[18:14] somebody else to step on I may be taken
[18:18] before that time I don't know and that
[18:21] time maybe this coming week that the
[18:24] Holy Spirit will come with and bring
[18:26] Christ Jesus
[18:27] he may come this next week he may come
[18:30] yet tonight I don't know when he will
[18:32] come he doesn't tell us that but I do
[18:35] believe that we are so close then I
[18:37] would never die with old age yet at 54
[18:40] years old I'll never die with old age
[18:42] until he's here
[18:44] unless I'm shot killed or something
[18:46] other someway killed this old age
[18:48] wouldn't kill me until he's come and I
[18:50] believe that and I want to say this I've
[18:52] never said it before but according to
[18:56] Scripture according to what he said 30
[18:58] years ago 33 years ago on the river down
[19:01] there in 1933 brother what he said
[19:04] everything has happened just exactly I
[19:07] may not do it but this message will
[19:11] introduce Jesus Christ to the world or a
[19:13] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[19:15] first coming so is the message to
[19:18] forerun the second coming and john said
[19:21] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[19:23] the sin of the world I think so it's a
[19:26] paralleled it and every way and I know
[19:28] it will the message will go on now
[19:32] there's been some great things take
[19:34] place along the road this morning I was
[19:37] having interviews in the room here and a
[19:41] young fellow by the name of Autry he's
[19:44] probably still in here tonight he's some
[19:47] Senate owned Texas he come asked if
[19:49] Columbus going to Dallas coming from
[19:51] California we could drop in one night at
[19:53] their Tabernacle just for one night
[19:57] they're looking it up the next day or
[19:59] two to see if we can do then and he was
[20:01] telling me about I never been to San
[20:03] Antonio since that first meeting now the
[20:05] first meeting when I come to Santa tone
[20:07] I was there I think with brother coot
[20:10] and the the International Bible School
[20:14] and I forget the auditorium we had the
[20:16] service in and it's either my first
[20:18] night our second night I think the first
[20:21] night when I was walking to the platform
[20:23] someone's raised up in the building way
[20:27] back in the back and spoke with tongues
[20:29] like a machine gun firing and you know
[20:33] more and set out just a moment or two to
[20:35] one raised on the platform and give the
[20:38] interpretation and I stopped with what
[20:41] he said and I said to the man do you
[20:44] know this man said no sir and he said I
[20:49] said how'd you come here he said the
[20:51] people I work part was that was here
[20:54] tonight and they brought me he's a the
[20:56] cowboy and I said what do you do he said
[21:00] do you know him he said no sir I never
[21:02] seen him and I said what are you and he
[21:05] was a merchant in the city and what they
[21:08] said in the I was always before I
[21:12] learned better I was a little skeptical
[21:14] speaking in tongues I thought a lot of
[21:16] it was flesh and it might be but when
[21:20] this was said that interpretation was
[21:23] exactly what the angel of Lord said down
[21:26] the river eleven years before that and
[21:29] john the baptist was sent to forerun the
[21:32] first coming of christ you're sent to
[21:35] forerun the second there it wasn't that
[21:38] angel that light has been thoroughly
[21:40] identifiable by the church by the word
[21:42] by science and everything has identified
[21:45] that light for its first time to appear
[21:48] in public standing right over where I
[21:50] was and about two o'clock in the
[21:52] afternoon at the foot of the bridge
[21:53] right down here at the foot of Spring
[21:55] Street in the water now that's been many
[21:58] many years ago and it
[22:00] exactly what it said has come to pass to
[22:03] the doc this brother here was telling me
[22:06] this morning
[22:07] he married a girl out of the church your

[28:28] guess he's in his 50s
[28:29] he said I'm teeny bit hard hearing him
[28:31] one ear because they give me so much
[28:33] antibiotic when I was in their amazing
[28:37] grace of Jesus Christ I haven't got much
[28:41] time now to say something else but I
[28:43] want to make this statement
[28:46] how many remembers about the squirrels
[28:51] all right that was a puzzling scripture
[28:54] in my life I never could understand that
[28:58] and there was another that puzzled me
[29:00] that's when Moses could tell God a
[29:02] better way than God
[29:04] note how to do anything when Moses said
[29:07] they have people to say your God was
[29:09] able to bring you out but not able to
[29:11] keep you and Moses to itself in the
[29:13] breach then later I found out that Moses
[29:16] that was Christ in Moses standing for
[29:19] the people see so then on this scripture
[29:22] and I never would preach on it if you
[29:24] say to this mountain be moved and you
[29:26] know the story so I'll bypass that now
[29:30] little did I know what that was leading
[29:32] to and I think that brother Woods and
[29:36] brother Fred and them are here in the
[29:39] building which was present when that
[29:41] happened or right edge would happen
[29:43] their brother Rodney and brother Charlie
[29:46] from down in Kentucky such Awards this
[29:48] brother name was present when it
[29:51] happened down in Kentucky which was the
[29:53] second time it happened just simply
[29:57] speaking into existence things it wasn't
[30:00] the speaking all time and backing up the
[30:03] scriptures encouraging the third time it
[30:06] happened was
[30:07] Hattie right is Hattie here tonight
[30:10] that's etus how many knows Hattie right
[30:12] brother woods and I were sitting there
[30:14] when it happened and when the Holy
[30:16] Spirit said give her what she wants and
[30:19] I was talking about that how do them
[30:22] squirrels come into existence and I said
[30:24] it's only thing it is he's Jehovah Jireh
[30:26] just when Abraham needed a ram God
[30:30] provided that Ram and he provided the
[30:35] squirrels he can speak a squirrel just
[30:36] into existence because he's creator just
[30:39] same as he could speak the RAM Abraham
[30:41] never asked for it he was just simply
[30:43] going on to do it but he showed that
[30:45] Jehovah Jireh I was there when I said
[30:47] that a humble
[30:48] a woman for the first time this ever
[30:50] happened the third pull upon a human
[30:53] being was a little humble woman that
[30:57] making about $200 a year for a living
[31:00] well she got out of her little farm her
[31:03] husband did two children that had turned
[31:06] kind of wild and come and donated $20 of
[31:11] that to the building of this tabernacle
[31:12] and media give me some money that
[31:15] morning for groceries $20 and oz go to
[31:17] give it back to her that day well it was
[31:19] down there so she wouldn't have to pay
[31:20] it but she wouldn't take him and when
[31:22] she's sitting back in the corner and
[31:24] when in line I said only thing I know is
[31:27] he still Jehovah Jireh and a little head
[31:29] he said the right word she said that's
[31:33] nothing but the truth and when she said
[31:36] that brother banks woods here's one that
[31:38] was present that room felt like it was
[31:40] coming apart and the Holy Spirit said
[31:43] the same boy spoke about the squirrel
[31:45] said give her what she asked for now
[31:49] said sister Hattie as a witness before
[31:52] God this is it now there's any doubt in
[31:56] your mind
[31:57] you asked what you want to in if it
[32:01] ain't laid in your lap then I'm a false
[32:04] prophet she said brother Branham
[32:07] everybody was crying said watch how I
[32:09] asked I said you're poor and you live on
[32:12] the hill over there with no money you
[32:14] might ask for that you've got a little
[32:18] crippled sister setting your Edith that
[32:20] we prayed for for years
[32:21] you might ask for her healing I said
[32:25] your father and mother is old and broke
[32:27] down
[32:27] you might ask for them whatever you ask
[32:31] for sister Hattie see now if it happens
[32:35] or not right now and I said he's just
[32:39] told me the same voice said give her
[32:42] what she asked for and she looked around
[32:47] to watch y'all say brother Bama I said
[32:49] say what's your desire is thank you your
[32:51] greatest desire and said and her boys
[32:54] was even sniggering laughing and she
[32:58] said the greatest is all I have is a
[32:59] Salvation my two sons
[33:01] give them to you in the name of Jesus
[33:03] Christ in there they went and they've
[33:05] been faithful in this church with
[33:07] communion hem little fellas set on a
[33:09] warship feet with the man and things
[33:11] like that
[33:11] we all are witness to that she had a
[33:14] real choice her mother has to die so
[33:18] does she all him but what she asked will
[33:20] be eternal and the salvation of her
[33:23] children that was a third time it

[33:39] standing here going down the mountain

[35:39] and everything but we knew how to get
[35:40] out and they know where we was at and so
[35:43] we felt led to stay and so upon the
[35:47] mountain when that Blizzard started I
[35:49] started going down and I was just about
[35:51] a half a mile from where it started and
[35:52] the voice of God said turn and go back
[35:55] and I went back as he told me after
[35:58] waiting for a while eating that sandwich
[36:00] of Davy gimme and went back up there and
[36:02] sat down and while I was sitting there
[36:05] in that wind twisting and blowing the
[36:07] treetops leading away over to sleet and
[36:09] snow applying like that a boy said I am
[36:13] the God of creation I looked up I
[36:17] thought where was that that was a wind
[36:19] maybe he said I created the heavens and
[36:22] earth I still the mighty winds up on the
[36:24] Seas and when I'm talking I jumped up
[36:27] and took off my head
[36:28] and he said just speak to the storm

[36:35] what will happen
[36:36] I said storm you cease it son you shine
[36:41] normally for four days that we're out of
[36:43] here and I know more and said it until
[36:47] the sleet snow and everything stopped in
[36:49] a moment or two the hot sun is shining
[36:51] on my back I've seen the winds blowing I
[36:53] kiss come back from the north coming
[36:55] down I mean from the east coming from
[36:56] the east it was coming from the West the
[36:58] winds changed and come back hitched when
[36:59] the clouds like a mystic thing lifting
[37:01] up into the air and the Sun was shining
[37:03] in a few minutes then the Lord Jesus
[37:05] spoke to me a little later on about my
[37:08] wife down there as you know about where
