[50:43] we had to drive about uh 6 to 8 hours or

[1:08:29] Seven Seals and I saw the strong angel
[1:08:33] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:08:36] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:08:41] seals
[1:08:42] thereof and no man in heaven none in the
[1:08:47] earth neither under the Earth was able

[1:13:31] years old something happened to him that
[1:13:35] affected him and uh uh and it was it was
[1:13:40] more it was more spiritual uh in a sense
[1:13:45] uh uh he's talking about in a vision he
[1:13:49] saw a scar and then uh he was about to
[1:13:52] say something and it looks like the scar
[1:13:54] went into his mouth and started
[1:13:56] grouching his stomach so all through his
[1:13:59] ministry he suffered from this stomach
[1:14:03] problem all through his ministry he
[1:14:06] suffered from his stomach problem
[1:14:08] believing that God will be able to to
[1:14:10] deliver him he talks he talk about why
[1:14:13] he was he was in pains with his stomach
[1:14:16] he would be standing in the prayer line
[1:14:18] he's going through excruciating pain in
[1:14:20] his stomach but yet he praying for
[1:14:22] people to be healed and people are
[1:14:25] getting their result but yet he's in
[1:14:27] pain praise the Lord that's the thing
[1:14:30] that Alexander Cooper could not
[1:14:32] understand Alexander the coer SMI I mean
[1:14:34] I say Alexander Cooper oh my God
[1:14:37] Alexander the coer Smith could not
[1:14:39] understand about Paul you know why this
[1:14:43] man with this great ministry will be
[1:14:44] complaining about his
[1:14:46] eyes when de forsake Paul that was the
[1:14:49] reason why he forsook Paul because he
[1:14:52] could not understand it and and that is
[1:14:55] and that is the thing that uh uh uh we
[1:14:59] will have to deal
[1:15:00] with you there are places where you will
[1:15:03] never be able to understand why you love
[1:15:07] God but you are still struggling with
[1:15:09] certain
[1:15:10] things praise the Lord am amen instead
[1:15:14] of you struggling to understand that you
[1:15:18] have to learn to praise
[1:15:20] God that he placed that thing in your
[1:15:23] life because without that you will be
[1:15:27] more horrible than you think you are
[1:15:29] that's
[1:15:31] right praise the
[1:15:34] Lord and and uh and you see so he he
[1:15:37] brought that and uh you know and and in
[1:15:40] that vision and after explaining it then
[1:15:43] he make this statement the dove leading
[1:15:45] the eagle he he saw her mother had a
[1:15:48] dream where she saw six do and then uh
[1:15:51] uh uh then uh he went theread Colorado
[1:15:55] in the mountain and then he saw this
[1:15:56] white the Seven door Perfection and then
[1:15:59] when he saw that it it brought the
[1:16:01] vision together and he was speaking
[1:16:03] about his healing because he he came to
[1:16:06] the m Clinic here he went from Hospital
[1:16:09] doctors you know they told him you would
[1:16:11] just have to live with that the rest of
[1:16:13] your life but he was believing that God
[1:16:15] will will visit him God will give him a
[1:16:17] healing praise the Lord
[1:16:20] amen what brother Brandon received a a
[1:16:24] uh uh uh physical healing in his body or
[1:16:28] the Lord uh uh when the Lord took him
[1:16:30] home you know uh uh uh because he's
[1:16:33] preaching this message uh on the wings
[1:16:35] of a snow white door
[1:16:37] 1965 you know so whether he's going home
[1:16:40] you know the do leading the eagle home
[1:16:43] will have free him from their sickness
[1:16:46] praise the Lord I could bring more more
[1:16:49] to you in detail but that's not what I'm
[1:16:50] talking that's not what I want to preach
[1:16:52] about this morning I'm just only taking
[1:16:54] the do leading the ego uh uh uh just
[1:16:58] just to be able to to get a title and
[1:17:01] then be able to bring to you what I want
[1:17:03] to bring to you this morning praise the
[1:17:06] Lord now so what I want to bring to you
[1:17:09] like we were talking on the the the
[1:17:11] return of the dove the dove has always
[1:17:13] been used as a sign just doing some
[1:17:16] review when we spoke on there one of the
[1:17:18] emphasis that we were on when Noah sent
[1:17:21] the dove out and the dove returned back
[1:17:24] the reason why the do return back was
[1:17:27] what found no place for
[1:17:30] rest amen because it found no place for
[1:17:36] rest praise the
[1:17:38] Lord and uh uh
[1:17:42] uh and rest
[1:17:48] rest is is what all of this is all
[1:17:52] about praise the Lord
[1:17:55] when you look in the creation story
[1:17:57] Genesis chapter 1 the Bible says when
[1:17:59] God created the Heaven and Earth uh uh
[1:18:03] and and and God went through he went
[1:18:06] through all the the the creation even he
[1:18:10] went through all the creation even the
[1:18:12] Bible says on the seventh day the Lord
[1:18:17] rested praise the Lord amen amen so rest
[1:18:22] is very important to our chran in
[1:18:27] faith that's what God is
[1:18:30] doing that's what this is all about is
[1:18:32] to bring us to rest that's what the
[1:18:35] Christian faith is about it's not about
[1:18:38] church membership or church going it's
[1:18:42] about you coming to a place of rest in
[1:18:46] your
[1:18:48] life coming to a place of rest in your
[1:18:51] mind in your heart
[1:18:55] because no matter how loud we can play
[1:18:57] the music and how many hours we can sing
[1:19:00] we can run around and rejoice at the end
[1:19:02] of the day if you will have to leave
[1:19:04] church going back home to wor
[1:19:07] it and your spirit is all
[1:19:11] Disturbed praise the Lord I would say we
[1:19:14] need more of God amen amen amen we need
[1:19:19] more of
[1:19:21] God that's what the Christian faith is
[1:19:24] all about
[1:19:25] rest is God bringing you to rest rest in
[1:19:31] him
[1:19:33] yes rest believing
[1:19:37] that he has already done it it's a
[1:19:39] finished work you know one of the thing
[1:19:42] that is bothering us I salute
[1:19:46] you brother Moses how are you amen I saw
[1:19:50] you coming in I wanted you uh you were
[1:19:52] distracting me but I just have to say it
[1:19:55] God bless you good to see you good to
[1:19:57] see you amen good to see you brother and
[1:19:59] uh
[1:20:00] so uh uh uh yeah lost my TR TOS there
[1:20:07] but it's okay glory be to God and so you
[1:20:12] you will realize that one of the thing
[1:20:16] one of the thing that is troubling the
[1:20:19] Christian church is self-righteousness
[1:20:26] self-righteousness is one of our
[1:20:30] problem the reason why it is our problem
[1:20:35] is is
[1:20:39] because as as children of God we have
[1:20:42] not come to appreciate and fully
[1:20:47] understand that this is a finished
[1:20:51] work and all God want where he's
[1:20:54] bringing your faith is for you to
[1:20:58] believe do you remember in the Bible it
[1:21:01] said over and over what is impossible to
[1:21:06] man is possible to
[1:21:10] God praise the Lord amen amen amen until
[1:21:15] we come to really understand what that
[1:21:21] is praise the Lord and come to real
[1:21:24] realiz that we have lot of
[1:21:28] impossibilities around our life if you
[1:21:31] don't have impossibility you don't need
[1:21:33] God right that's right if you don't have
[1:21:37] impossibilities you don't need God right
[1:21:41] and you will never
[1:21:43] appreciate the Christian faith am he
[1:21:47] specialized in things
[1:21:50] impossible
[1:21:52] amen glory be to God am are we
[1:21:56] together so we talk about that D the DF
[1:22:00] returning back because it never found a
[1:22:03] place to rest glory to God God started
[1:22:08] his creation the first day he you know
[1:22:11] he he said let it be light and and then
[1:22:13] he I mean he did all his creation the
[1:22:17] sixth day God made a Man In His
[1:22:22] Image when God was able to achieve to
[1:22:26] have a man in His image then the seventh
[1:22:30] day he
[1:22:33] rested so see the work of God now what
[1:22:37] he's what he wanting to do is to be able
[1:22:41] to get you and myself in His
[1:22:44] image then he will rest amen hallelujah
[1:22:48] and until we come to that place to come
[1:22:51] to the image of God not the one that we
[1:22:54] have buil in our mind not the one our
[1:22:57] self-righteousness has built the one
[1:22:59] that the word of God has has
[1:23:02] described amen when we come to that
[1:23:06] image then God will rest what was the
[1:23:10] rest how did God rested he never put a
[1:23:13] bed down or put a m down to rest he
[1:23:16] rested in Adam yes that's right that's
[1:23:20] why Paul would call the Holy Ghost a
[1:23:22] rest in the book of Hebrew that's right
[1:23:25] when God can get a man that is willing
[1:23:29] to fully submit to his will then God
[1:23:33] steps in that man
[1:23:37] amen then Jesus will say I do nothing
[1:23:42] except what the father has shown me
[1:23:45] that's
[1:23:48] right you are not moving to be seen you
[1:23:52] are not doing to be recognized
[1:23:56] you wish that you are not seen let the
[1:23:58] father be
[1:24:02] seen and Jesus said man we see your good
[1:24:05] works and glorify the father yes sir
[1:24:10] Hallelujah that's right so rest is very
[1:24:13] important let me show you another
[1:24:15] another example in the
[1:24:17] scripture when the Book of Revelation
[1:24:21] talks about about hell
[1:24:26] it describ it as the buttonless
[1:24:31] pit so bottomless
[1:24:34] means you are just sinking and can never
[1:24:36] come to
[1:24:38] rest because when something is
[1:24:41] bottomless it does not have a stop it's
[1:24:44] just going it's just going you can never
[1:24:45] come to
[1:24:47] rest praise the Lord so you see the
[1:24:51] Christian faith brings you to rest
[1:24:54] it want you to rest on Christ bring you
[1:24:58] to uh h h h this Solid Ground amen where
[1:25:03] you can rest your faith on the finished
[1:25:06] work of Jesus Christ praise the Lord and
[1:25:10] the devil want to keep you in a
[1:25:12] frustrated State amen where you don't
[1:25:16] have rest you trying you you you trying
[1:25:19] to grab a straw trying to grab
[1:25:22] everything thinking if I get this it
[1:25:24] will be okay for me if I do
[1:25:27] this and you just and you just can't get
[1:25:31] rest so in
[1:25:34] prising you will see that's
[1:25:37] what uh he
[1:25:41] said hell is on earth when he saw that
[1:25:46] people coming down in JC Penny that
[1:25:48] links back to his
[1:25:50] vision what were they doing they were
[1:25:52] coming down the ES
[1:25:55] L and in his vision when he was 14 years
[1:25:58] old shot in his legs he was he was in a
[1:26:01] descending order crying to God oh God if
[1:26:04] you take me from here I will save you
[1:26:06] because he was going down you were just
[1:26:08] going
[1:26:09] down that's what bothered him and he
[1:26:12] went
[1:26:13] home because he it almost looks like he
[1:26:17] was he was he was able to see it he he
[1:26:20] caught up with his
[1:26:22] Spirit could this be on
[1:26:25] Earth praise the Lord so why God by the
[1:26:29] Holy Ghost is bringing people to rest
[1:26:31] and Trust in
[1:26:34] Christ right on earth right in this
[1:26:40] boarding there are people that just they
[1:26:43] are just in the descending
[1:26:46] order just in the descending order can
[1:26:48] never find
[1:26:51] rest even as much as they try to fake
[1:26:56] it they are not settle they are not
[1:27:01] setting as much as they try to fake
[1:27:09] it they can they can be on the stage and
[1:27:12] say all the wonderful
[1:27:14] things at the end of the day they have
[1:27:18] to
[1:27:18] get a cigarette to
[1:27:21] smoke or an alcohol to drink
[1:27:25] or to look for one other entertainment
[1:27:28] or
[1:27:30] another because they are not setting
[1:27:33] they are not settled they fall back into
[1:27:36] that state and they are just
[1:27:38] wondering where am I when will this be
[1:27:42] over how can I get out of
[1:27:45] this their spirit is in the descending
[1:27:48] order
[1:27:54] everything of life looks like a
[1:27:59] failure are we
[1:28:01] together so the dove
[1:28:04] returned the return of the dove was
[1:28:07] because it never had a place of
[1:28:10] rest so that's that's the emphasis
[1:28:13] that's what I want us to put the
[1:28:15] emphasis on the do only
[1:28:20] come because of
[1:28:22] rest so when I got an olive leaf came
[1:28:26] back gave it to Noah Noah knew that okay
[1:28:29] the water is going down and when the
[1:28:32] dove went out the second time it never
[1:28:35] returned praise the Lord do uh Noah
[1:28:39] believed that uh uh the water was dried
[1:28:42] and the Bible says God opened the ark
[1:28:44] and and went on and then I I link this
[1:28:49] connected to Matthew chapter 3 it's in
[1:28:52] John chapter 1 Jesus on the bank of
[1:28:56] Jordan while John was baptizing when
[1:28:59] Jesus came out to John John testified
[1:29:04] that he saw the spirit of God coming
[1:29:06] down in the form of a
[1:29:09] DF now so if the do will come again is
[1:29:13] because the do has found a resting place
[1:29:16] and John said I Heard a Voice saying
[1:29:19] behold my my my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:29:22] well pleased Amen to D so the door fall
[1:29:27] the resting
[1:29:29] place so my emphasis was the dove that
[1:29:33] left the
[1:29:35] ark kept flying through the Old
[1:29:39] Testament in types and
[1:29:41] shadows because the dove was used in the
[1:29:44] Old Testament for sacrifice amen praise
[1:29:47] the
[1:29:48] Lord but all the sacrifices in the Old
[1:29:51] Testament was pointing to Jesus am so
[1:29:54] the dove could not rest on those
[1:29:58] sacrifices are you getting the picture
[1:30:02] amen but when Jesus the the the the the
[1:30:06] the the antitype the Fulfillment of the
[1:30:09] Old Testament prophecy was here that
[1:30:13] do now is in the type now praise the
[1:30:17] Lord amen don't get too scientific on me
[1:30:20] and say oh the do late 2,000 years 2,000
[1:30:23] year were flying
[1:30:26] around I want you to be able to get the
[1:30:28] picture praise the Lord the do
[1:30:32] return because God is testifying my
[1:30:36] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:30:39] do now so we see there at the door of
[1:30:42] God a resting
[1:30:44] place are we
[1:30:46] together and John identify that resting
[1:30:50] place as the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:30:54] the sin of the
[1:30:56] word amen so the do in its nature will
[1:31:02] only
[1:31:04] rest on a ling
[1:31:08] nature are we together praise the Lord
[1:31:12] the do will only rest on a ling nature
[1:31:16] so I want us to keep the do and lamb in
[1:31:20] mind now Jesus the Lamb of God he worked
[1:31:24] throughout his ministry praise the Lord
[1:31:28] and he kept
[1:31:29] telling the the the Believers the
[1:31:33] disciples uh H H about the coming of the
[1:31:36] Holy
[1:31:38] Ghost are we together he told
[1:31:43] Nicodemus h h
[1:31:46] h uh a stbe that he had to be born
[1:31:52] again so
[1:31:57] Jesus the Lamb of God was gaed by the
[1:32:02] door in his
[1:32:05] ministry are we
[1:32:07] together I want to I want you to for us
[1:32:10] to see the picture he was gathered by
[1:32:12] the do through his
[1:32:15] ministry
[1:32:18] amen he promised the Believers that when
[1:32:22] he Ascend he will return
[1:32:24] I will not leave you
[1:32:26] comfortless praise the Lord now another
[1:32:30] thing I want for us to put into our
[1:32:33] picture from Revelation chapter
[1:32:37] 5
[1:32:40] okay Revelation chapter
[1:32:42] 5 let's go back to Revelation chapter
[1:32:46] 5 like I said I uh all I wanted to do is
[1:32:50] just to appreciate you and uh uh for for
[1:32:55] another year of service
[1:32:58] together so I will take take
[1:33:03] uh my time this morning and just try to
[1:33:06] bring this to you as soon as you you get
[1:33:09] the picture you say Amen then we'll go
[1:33:12] home praise the Lord amen
[1:33:16] hallelujah if I'm not hearing you saying

[1:33:20] yet that's okay for me I keep working
[1:33:24] keep working on it brother
[1:33:29] Andrews praise the
[1:33:35] Lord I saw in the hand of him that sat
[1:33:38] on the throne a book written with in on
[1:33:40] the backside seal with seven seal I saw
[1:33:43] an angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:33:46] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:33:49] lose the seals no man in heaven or in
[1:33:52] Earth neither on under the Earth was
[1:33:56] able to open the book needed to look
[1:33:58] there on no
[1:34:01] man praise the
[1:34:03] Lord no man but the cry that went
[1:34:09] out when the angel proclaimed was who is
[1:34:13] worthy
[1:34:15] whoo is looking for a man it's looking
[1:34:18] for a
[1:34:20] person but no man was found worthy to
[1:34:23] open in the book and to lose the seals
[1:34:27] thereof are we together amen follow me
[1:34:32] carefully
[1:34:33] now John said he wept in verse four in
[1:34:38] verse 5 one of the others now these
[1:34:43] others were the 24 others that was
[1:34:46] around the
[1:34:47] throne are we together amen praise the
[1:34:51] Lord amen amen
[1:34:54] what I'm saying is it making sense I'm
[1:34:57] not just making a lot of stories making
[1:34:59] you more
[1:35:00] confused praise the Lord one of these
[1:35:04] others were the 24 ERS around the throne
[1:35:09] the 24 others is made out of a
[1:35:13] representation of the 12 tribes the
[1:35:17] Patriot and the 12
[1:35:22] apostles they are the one make the 24
[1:35:24] others am praise the Lord one of those
[1:35:29] hethers said to John we not the lion of
[1:35:34] the tribe of Judah amen has
[1:35:39] prevailed
[1:35:41] amen are you seeing the picture he says
[1:35:44] the lion of the Trap of Judah has
[1:35:51] prevailed when John turned turn to see
[1:35:54] the lion that has
[1:35:56] prevailed now think about it now the
[1:36:00] word Prevail means to
[1:36:04] overcome
[1:36:06] amen so John the one the other is seeing
[1:36:10] the lion of the Trap of Judah has
[1:36:15] overcome are we
[1:36:18] together but when John turned to see the
[1:36:22] lion he saw
[1:36:24] a
[1:36:27] lamb praise the Lord so let's understand
[1:36:31] a little
[1:36:32] bit the relationship of The Lion and the
[1:36:35] lamb the ELD says a lion has prevailed
[1:36:40] John turned he saw a lamb what is
[1:36:43] happening now this is what is happening
[1:36:46] because the Book of Revelation is a book
[1:36:48] of
[1:36:49] symbol praise the Lord amen so what is
[1:36:53] Happening Here is
[1:36:56] that Jesus the Lamb of
[1:36:59] God the Lamb of
[1:37:02] God led the church to
[1:37:05] Pentecost amen he ascended on High
[1:37:10] Praise the Lord so we will realize if
[1:37:14] you take the the the the the the
[1:37:18] anointing you take the four
[1:37:22] beasts that is around the
[1:37:25] throne are we
[1:37:28] together there is a lion there is an ox
[1:37:32] there's a man there is an eagle
[1:37:34] Revelation chapter 6 are we
[1:37:38] together amen now so all of these
[1:37:45] anointing they were symbolized in the
[1:37:49] Old Testament as the cherubin that were
[1:37:52] around the throne
[1:37:56] when Adam and Eve were driven from the
[1:37:58] garden the cherubin was put to guard the
[1:38:00] tree of
[1:38:02] life it was those four beasts they were
[1:38:04] there to guide the Tree of Life are we
[1:38:12] together uh uh asaiah saw
[1:38:17] it how his train filled the temple they
[1:38:21] were moving in such a speed
[1:38:25] moving in such a speed just like a train
[1:38:28] the Bible say his train filled the
[1:38:30] temple what it was is that those angels
[1:38:33] wings are lock one to
[1:38:36] another praise the
[1:38:39] Lord
[1:38:41] amen their wings are lock one to another
[1:38:45] I I think we we demonstrated a year
[1:38:48] before praise the Lord
[1:38:50] am brother Johnny come and help me Jon
[1:38:54] come and help
[1:38:55] me praise the
[1:39:00] Lord come and help me brother
[1:39:02] Peterson I think we did that year a long
[1:39:04] time ago so we will we'll do it again
[1:39:07] you stand right
[1:39:11] here stand right here
[1:39:14] please just make yourself flexible I'm
[1:39:16] not going to box I don't want
[1:39:21] to okay so you lock your hands with his
[1:39:24] hands and lock your hands with this guy
[1:39:26] hands
[1:39:27] good and uh so that's how the that's how
[1:39:31] the the cherubin are okay they are
[1:39:36] luck so when they are moving because
[1:39:41] they are in uh H uh Angelic creatures
[1:39:45] they move so
[1:39:47] fast so when Isaiah saw it he saw it
[1:39:50] like a train when Ezekiel Saw saw it it
[1:39:53] was like the wheels in the middle of the
[1:39:57] wheels but it was the it was the
[1:39:59] cherubin that were
[1:40:02] moving are we
[1:40:05] together amen and when they
[1:40:09] move they move
[1:40:13] together if brother Johnny move brother
[1:40:15] Johnny you go they all move like this so
[1:40:20] they they are moving with the face of a
[1:40:25] man so the the the rest of the
[1:40:29] cherubin the the the their support is
[1:40:32] behind it they are not going in in a
[1:40:36] divisive way I'll give you an
[1:40:39] example if God just like uh uh uh uh the
[1:40:45] first three Church Ages were under the
[1:40:49] anointing of the Lion
[1:40:53] the lion has prevailed pay attention now
[1:40:57] praise the Lord amen because I'm saying
[1:41:00] all of this not to just not to give you
[1:41:02] a h h you know perform a drama but to
[1:41:06] make you to understand what I'm trying
[1:41:07] to say where I'm trying to bring you
[1:41:11] John said the lion of the Trap of Judah
[1:41:13] has
[1:41:15] prevailed but when John looked he saw
[1:41:17] the
[1:41:18] lamb praise the Lord so John the
[1:41:24] identify one of the
[1:41:28] creature because they don't move spray
[1:41:31] out they move in the face of one amen
[1:41:35] right praise the Lord amen the ELD who
[1:41:39] have also said the ox has prevailed
[1:41:44] amen praise the Lord amen if it was the
[1:41:47] face of the ox the the Ed would say the
[1:41:49] ox has prevailed if it was the face of
[1:41:52] the man man the ELD could say the man
[1:41:55] has
[1:41:57] prevailed are you getting the
[1:42:00] picture if it was the face of the ego
[1:42:04] the Ed who says the ego has
[1:42:09] prevailed because that's how they
[1:42:13] move praise the Lord amen are we
[1:42:17] together lion will represent
[1:42:21] Faith the four anointings on the healing
[1:42:24] Lon represent our faith amen because
[1:42:28] Faith Like brother Bram says is an
[1:42:30] action where it has hair on his chest
[1:42:33] it's you know you step out by faith
[1:42:39] amen the ox represent
[1:42:44] sacrifice so whenever the church is
[1:42:47] going on a a sacrificial time that that
[1:42:51] is Tye with our trials
[1:42:53] God put an ox anointing on you for you
[1:42:56] to Bear your
[1:43:00] trials that's the reason why no trial
[1:43:02] come upon us that is greater amen thank
[1:43:05] you Lord that before God gave you a
[1:43:08] trial he has already anointed you with
[1:43:11] an ox for you to Bear
[1:43:13] it
[1:43:15] amen are we together
[1:43:19] amen so H uh wisdom knowledge is under
[1:43:23] the man's
[1:43:28] anointing are we together are are you
[1:43:31] seeing the picture Okay so uh uh the a
[1:43:35] saw like I said they are not spread out
[1:43:38] no they are not spread out they are they
[1:43:40] are moved together and their and and
[1:43:43] their wings are all locked together like
[1:43:48] this and uh the church is right in the
[1:43:52] middle amen
[1:43:55] amen praise the Lord Jesus said I be my
[1:43:58] church the gifts of Hell will not
[1:44:02] [Applause]
[1:44:04] previl the devil can't gu to God's
[1:44:08] Church you might think he's getting to
[1:44:10] you because you are in trial no he's
[1:44:13] only hitting the ox anointing and that
[1:44:15] anointing is protecting
[1:44:18] [Applause]
[1:44:21] you that's the reason why Let the church
[1:44:24] get away from her
[1:44:26] self-righteousness stop to think that
[1:44:28] you are the one doing it you're not
[1:44:30] doing
[1:44:40] anything are you getting the picture
[1:44:44] amen the church has already been
[1:44:47] predestinated it can never fail amen
[1:44:51] amen you might feel backslide it does
[1:44:54] not mean that the church has
[1:44:56] failed the church can never fail the
[1:44:58] church is going to arrive that's the
[1:45:00] reason why God can present to himself a
[1:45:04] church without spot or blamage why
[1:45:07] because he has already provided a
[1:45:09] protection for his church the church is
[1:45:12] lacking
[1:45:21] this yes reason why it pays for you to
[1:45:25] understand what God is doing to your
[1:45:28] life what is he doing to your life what
[1:45:32] season are you in where God want to
[1:45:34] bring
[1:45:38] you we love to be in control when we
[1:45:42] can't control
[1:45:51] nothing are we together
[1:45:56] are you seeing the
[1:45:58] picture the lion of the Trap of Judah
[1:46:02] has
[1:46:03] prevailed but when John turned around to
[1:46:05] see a lion he saw a
[1:46:08] lamb praise the Lord now because these
[1:46:12] are the
[1:46:14] anointing that is given to God the
[1:46:17] church
[1:46:18] amen but there is a nature the ano
[1:46:22] anting is different from the nature the
[1:46:26] lamb will only come the dove will only
[1:46:29] come on a l
[1:46:33] nature praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:46:36] why a man can have an anointing preach
[1:46:39] and bring fire down from heaven if he
[1:46:41] don't have a ling nature he will see
[1:46:44] like the
[1:46:50] devil praise the Lord amen
[1:46:53] they either
[1:46:56] identify an
[1:46:58] anointing when Jon look around he saw a
[1:47:04] nature
[1:47:12] amen what did the Ed said the lion has
[1:47:19] prevailed the lion has over
[1:47:28] come was it a lion that went to
[1:47:33] Calvary what went to
[1:47:36] Calvary
[1:47:39] larm praise the Lord amen so it's a ling
[1:47:44] nature in the
[1:47:47] lion that prevail
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:55] amen am the anointing and the nature
[1:48:00] amen you can sing like a sparkle
[1:48:03] bird and put Goose bomb on people if the
[1:48:07] nature is not
[1:48:10] changed you would drink sin like a
[1:48:20] drunker are you getting the pict
[1:48:28] are you are you getting the
[1:48:32] picture who is worthy they were looking
[1:48:36] for a man but yet no man was found
[1:48:41] walking because no man had that Ling
[1:48:47] nature since Adam fell all through we
[1:48:52] all only SE shap in iniquity came to the
[1:48:55] word speaking
[1:49:01] lies are we
[1:49:04] together are you seeing the picture
[1:49:09] amen amen okay so we will I would I
[1:49:12] would work with the brothers here and
[1:49:13] then I let them go and sit okay let's
[1:49:15] let's dramatize a little bit so we take
[1:49:18] brother Johnny as uh as the as the lion
[1:49:21] so when when the lion and anointing move
[1:49:24] the entire chuban goes behind it and
[1:49:26] support it okay no let's let's stay
[1:49:29] right here or else we won't have space
[1:49:30] to move let's let's come back and then I
[1:49:33] I I will I will be the I will be the the
[1:49:37] the the ox
[1:49:39] anointing when I move all the cherubin
[1:49:44] move so so everything you will
[1:49:47] see is just the ox that's the reason why
[1:49:52] on
[1:49:53] the Dark Age that was the anointing that
[1:49:56] was on the church okay the people could
[1:49:59] give their life to be burned they could
[1:50:01] be sacrificed the church was under the
[1:50:04] ano they could they were not
[1:50:07] struggling they were not
[1:50:09] struggling to submit them themselves
[1:50:12] because that's the anointing that was on
[1:50:13] the
[1:50:14] church the ones that were struggling
[1:50:17] were the ones that did not have the Ling
[1:50:19] nature because no matter how much
[1:50:22] anointing is there if the nature is not
[1:50:24] changed you will run
[1:50:29] away are we together amen okay if
[1:50:34] brother if brother Emmanuel moveed that
[1:50:35] that would be the man's anointing so the
[1:50:38] entire church is honor that anointing
[1:50:41] amen that's under that anointing the
[1:50:44] reformer a John Wesley Martin lther and
[1:50:47] all of these Great Men you know they
[1:50:49] were they were looking into God's word
[1:50:51] they were bringing truth out of the word
[1:50:53] of God the church was honor
[1:50:57] that praise the Lord but no matter how
[1:51:00] much truth that was brought out if the
[1:51:03] people did not have the lamb nature the
[1:51:06] anointing is just for a
[1:51:08] season it's just for a season you will
[1:51:12] shout run around and all of that it's
[1:51:14] just for a
[1:51:18] season the Nature has to be changed
[1:51:26] are we together
[1:51:29] Amen brother J Jonathon will be on the
[1:51:32] the eagles's anointing so when he moves
[1:51:35] the church is the entire church because
[1:51:38] the church is right here the church is
[1:51:40] kept in the
[1:51:43] middle so all all the the the the the
[1:51:47] working seed is that it's not split
[1:51:50] anointing no they are not fighting
[1:51:53] against one another there's no
[1:51:58] competition God bless you Brothers thank
[1:52:00] you
[1:52:02] [Applause]

[1:52:23] the seals that's another thing I can
[1:52:26] spend time and and and explain that to
[1:52:28] you Revelation chapter 6 uh six uh uh
[1:52:33] the first horse rider the second horse
[1:52:35] rider they take that to be the seals
[1:52:37] it's not the seals
[1:52:41] right it's the event it's the thing that
[1:52:44] happened around the
[1:52:45] seals the seal is one thing Christ

[1:52:58] worthy to open the book and to do what
[1:53:01] loose the seals release the Life of
[1:53:04] Christ that's what the loosing of the
[1:53:07] seal is all
[1:53:10] about is to release the Life of
[1:53:16] Christ are we
[1:53:21] together that's what is all about that's
[1:53:23] what the seal is all about it's not all
[1:53:25] about this explanation the first horse
[1:53:27] rather the the the dark Ag and and and
[1:53:30] all of this drama those are just
[1:53:33] information on the seals yes
[1:53:35] sir the actual seals is the release of
[1:53:39] the Life of Christ that comes back on
[1:53:41] the believer since the Old Testament
[1:53:44] sacrifice of of Boo and
[1:53:47] gods when the when the when the animal
[1:53:49] was killed the life could not come back
[1:53:52] on the
[1:53:53] believer for the believer to be able to
[1:53:56] experience the Life of Christ it had to
[1:54:00] take the opening of the
[1:54:03] seals yes sir that's what the breaking
[1:54:06] of the seals is all about it's not to
[1:54:08] give us information to be condemning one
[1:54:10] person no no no no it's for the Life of
[1:54:13] Christ to come back on the
[1:54:17] believer once again we can see truth
[1:54:20] earnesty
[1:54:22] it's not about you protecting what do
[1:54:24] you have to protect it by yourself
[1:54:27] right to be Earnest is to be Earnest
[1:54:31] examine your your earnesty with the word
[1:54:33] of
[1:54:34] God not you protecting
[1:54:40] yourself are we

[1:54:57] built and and and we are together are we

[1:55:12] pull that up for me it would just it
[1:55:14] would just help you to get a picture of
[1:55:16] what what I was trying to bring to you
[1:55:18] uh in the drama here uh what's the
[1:55:23] year what is
[1:55:26] it it means that this
[1:55:29] guy this guy was God's Ark which mean
[1:55:35] the four Beast they were God's
[1:55:39] Ark the
[1:55:40] eagle the ox the man and the lion
[1:55:44] Matthew Mark Luke and John if you even
[1:55:47] look in the four gospel you will see it
[1:55:50] Matthew speaks about the king
[1:55:52] that's the
[1:55:54] lion mark his gospel was all about
[1:55:58] service that's the ARs Luke was a doctor
[1:56:02] a physician he was a man he wrote book
[1:56:05] book The Book of Luke and and the book
[1:56:07] of
[1:56:10] Acts if God did not give a man that was
[1:56:14] that were at the level of Luke we will
[1:56:16] not have a report of the book of Acts
[1:56:19] Luke was the one that wrote it John John
[1:56:23] came and said in the beginning was the
[1:56:24] word the word was he went right back to
[1:56:26] the beginning that was the eag's
[1:56:28] anointing
[1:56:32] right so it's the four God is the four
[1:56:36] Beast is the four living creature we can
[1:56:39] say it in in in in different ways just
[1:56:42] to be able to bring the picture
[1:56:45] out
[1:56:47] Hallelujah now watch this also watch
[1:56:50] this
[1:56:53] Adam has
[1:56:54] fell
[1:56:56] amen amen
[1:56:59] amen king killed Abel before God called
[1:57:04] Noah are we together amen so which mean
[1:57:08] death has already come on the earth so
[1:57:11] man was no longer honor the perfect
[1:57:14] condition that Adam and Eve were honor
[1:57:17] praise the Lord but here it said that
[1:57:19] God called Noah and gave him a message
[1:57:24] and when
[1:57:25] Noah sent for his message his message
[1:57:29] was able to get those animals in their
[1:57:32] falling State Amen to come into an
[1:57:37] ark and as they enter the ark there was
[1:57:42] sufficient
[1:57:44] anointing there was sufficient
[1:57:46] atmosphere to affect them that all their
[1:57:50] forces e one another running away from
[1:57:54] one another could not enter the ark as
[1:57:57] they came climbing that step and
[1:58:01] entering into the ark for the fact there
[1:58:04] is that their nature was changed from
[1:58:08] the very fact that they could hear Noah
[1:58:10] message right their nature was not
[1:58:14] changed in the ACT if now they will
[1:58:16] start eating one another on the
[1:58:18] road when they heard the message Faith
[1:58:21] come back by
[1:58:22] hearing praise the lord we need some
[1:58:26] hearing that will change our
[1:58:28] nature if our nature is not Chang we are
[1:58:31] not hearing enough
[1:58:33] right right praise the Lord
[1:58:37] amen when they heard the
[1:58:40] message to be able to turn and look for
[1:58:42] where Noah
[1:58:44] was something struck them their nature
[1:58:47] was changed
[1:58:48] right and those animals would come uh uh
[1:58:52] uh in peirs and and and the other ones
[1:58:54] in
[1:58:55] servant to come right into the ark and
[1:58:58] they will stay in that AR all of those
[1:59:01] days no
[1:59:04] fussing praise the Lord the beautiful
[1:59:07] thing there is that nobody asking for
[1:59:09] special
[1:59:13] diet praise the
[1:59:16] Lord nobody asking for special diet
[1:59:20] there are some people that in church
[1:59:21] they let to be treated
[1:59:25] special they want special
[1:59:29] attention Noah did not have no special
[1:59:31] diet praise the Lord what was good for
[1:59:35] one was good for

[1:59:48] hallelujah
[1:59:50] amen oh oh my amen are we together
[1:59:55] amen glory be to
[2:00:00] God the lion of the Trap of Judah has
[2:00:05] prevailed why because that's what they
[2:00:07] were seeing that's what the Ed
[2:00:10] saw he saw a lion anointing that brought
[2:00:13] the church through the first three
[2:00:16] ages the first three Church Ages were
[2:00:19] under the Lion's anointing
[2:00:22] that's the reason why they could reach
[2:00:24] out and spread the gospel they were
[2:00:29] traveling trying to conquer the
[2:00:32] word under the Lion's
[2:00:36] anointing under the fourth age it was
[2:00:39] under the ox anointing that was when
[2:00:41] great darkness and persecution was on
[2:00:43] the church and men were willing to give
[2:00:46] their
[2:00:48] lives amen
[2:00:52] they were willing to give their
[2:00:56] life praise the lord we have a church
[2:01:00] age that is that wanting to
[2:01:03] get this age that's laoda Spirit we
[2:01:06] can't help it it's the spirit of our age
[2:01:09] it just want to
[2:01:11] get it don't know how to
[2:01:16] give this age don't know how to give we
[2:01:20] in so much competition
[2:01:22] that even if we can get all we get
[2:01:24] nobody can see us we are covered with
[2:01:29] it we still be there s me one more they
[2:01:33] can't even see
[2:01:34] you that's your
[2:01:36] age age of
[2:01:43] getting are we
[2:01:46] together now so it's it's the it's a
[2:01:49] revelation series that I want to bring
[2:01:51] to you is a Revelation 5 picture I want
[2:01:54] to bring to you in this way to show you
[2:01:59] that there is a
[2:02:03] Ministry and there is a
[2:02:07] nature and that's where the church has
[2:02:10] fail people run for the ministry they
[2:02:13] run for the anointing right without the
[2:02:17] nature
[2:02:18] right praise the Lord amen
[2:02:24] the an the the anointing can wear off
[2:02:27] that's true praise the Lord the nature
[2:02:30] comes to change
[2:02:37] you if you just want the anointing oh I
[2:02:40] want the Holy Ghost you can feel the
[2:02:42] sensation you can shout
[2:02:48] jum when you wear out we see you foring
[2:02:52] right
[2:02:56] am it's two different
[2:03:01] things it's two different things when
[2:03:03] you get the nature because when the
[2:03:06] nature comes when the Ling nature comes
[2:03:09] it kills
[2:03:11] you it kills you so much that you get
[2:03:14] afraid of the
[2:03:15] anointing you know you are not sure
[2:03:18] whether you really want it because you
[2:03:20] are dead right amen that's the problem
[2:03:23] with the
[2:03:24] church people run out for
[2:03:27] gifts they want gifts they want
[2:03:31] anointing but the Life of Christ the
[2:03:35] nature of the
[2:03:37] Lamb the dove cannot come on the lion
[2:03:40] the lion will eat
[2:03:44] it the dove cannot lead a lion the lion
[2:03:48] in its nature will eat it for the do to
[2:03:52] lead the lion the lion must have a lamby
[2:03:57] nature that's why Revelation 5 was
[2:04:00] showing to
[2:04:01] us there was an anointing there but the
[2:04:05] nature of Christ was the driving force
[2:04:08] of the
[2:04:09] church John looked to see a lion he saw
[2:04:13] a lamb bleeding lamb that's what the
[2:04:15] Bible says a bleeding
[2:04:18] lamb amen
[2:04:24] amen are we together because the dove
[2:04:28] can only rest on the
[2:04:31] lamb the door will not even come on the
[2:04:34] ox even though the ox is a sacrificial
[2:04:36] animal the dove will not come on the ox
[2:04:40] until the ox has a lamin nature amen the
[2:04:43] dove will not come on a man until that
[2:04:47] man or woman have a ling nature the do
[2:04:50] cannot Le ego until the ego has a lamin
[2:04:55] nature why because the ego in this build
[2:04:59] or can fly more higher than the
[2:05:01] DF why will it submit itself to the
[2:05:05] DF why why will it submit itself to the
[2:05:09] do unless the nature is changed am it
[2:05:13] has a eagle body but the nature in it is
[2:05:16] a it's a lamb praise the Lord it will
[2:05:19] never fly Beyond the do it will always
[2:05:22] stay under the leadership of the
[2:05:25] do even though the wings is big but it
[2:05:29] will say no you are my leader I'm going
[2:05:31] to stay right under you I can't fly more
[2:05:34] than
[2:05:35] you praise the
[2:05:37] Lord but if the ego nature does not
[2:05:40] changed when it y one time the door will
[2:05:49] run are we together amen praise the Lord
[2:05:55] amen has the church seen the picture is
[2:05:58] the picture clear praise the
[2:06:01] Lord you have to be able to
[2:06:07] identify the anointing the anointing has
[2:06:10] a
[2:06:11] nature the five4 ministry they are all
[2:06:14] under the nature of this
[2:06:17] Beast the the the Evangelist he's there
[2:06:20] you know what just like
[2:06:22] lion the pastor he's the he's the
[2:06:25] Belling Bearer he's the sacrificial
[2:06:27] animal of the team yes praise the Lord
[2:06:31] so they are all under this anointing
[2:06:33] that is given to lead the church but
[2:06:36] what is
[2:06:38] important what is
[2:06:41] important is the Ling
[2:06:45] nature if a man don't have a lme in
[2:06:48] nature you make a mess of this anointing
[2:06:53] yes sir you will you will explain
[2:06:56] explain and talk and talk and talk at
[2:06:58] the end of Faith you will not be able to
[2:06:59] submit yourself to the very word that
[2:07:01] you claim to
[2:07:02] believe that has been the problem of the
[2:07:05] Christian Church yes sir anointed one at
[2:07:08] the end
[2:07:11] time why would Jesus say depart from me
[2:07:14] the worker of iniquity amen I never knew
[2:07:17] you why because they never had his
[2:07:19] nature right amen
[2:07:23] he can't deny his
[2:07:27] own are we together are you seeing the
[2:07:31] picture you see so I think what what
[2:07:34] what Good Shepherd needs amen
[2:07:38] am it's not powerful preacher though no
[2:07:42] we don't need powerful preacher no I'm
[2:07:45] not trying to make excuse to say because
[2:07:47] I'm not powerful y please keep me that's
[2:07:49] not what I'm doing
[2:07:52] praise the Lord I I've always told you
[2:07:54] if you find another good one I will
[2:07:56] still right here and support
[2:07:58] him you just let me
[2:08:01] know glory be to Goden amen well I'm I'm
[2:08:05] just teasing you a little bit but to be
[2:08:08] able to to to to help you to understand
[2:08:11] what what uh what a church
[2:08:14] need what a church
[2:08:16] need it's a laming
[2:08:19] nature if we all can submit to the word
[2:08:23] and learn to submit to one
[2:08:28] another your gift can never be a benefit
[2:08:31] to this church or to any
[2:08:35] church if you are not ready to
[2:08:38] submit if you are not ready to submit to
[2:08:42] the word of God your gift can never be a
[2:08:45] benefit not even to
[2:08:47] yourself because out of arrogance and
[2:08:51] ignorance and you will destroy yourself
[2:08:55] am
[2:08:59] amen are we together
[2:09:05] amen I could go on and
[2:09:08] on I believe
[2:09:10] I've I've got I've got the picture

[2:09:24] walting but the Lamb of God was a
[2:09:29] man
[2:09:31] amen the Lamb of God was a
[2:09:34] man but
[2:09:36] yet it said no man was Wy to take the
[2:09:40] book to lose the seals to even look upon
[2:09:42] it so what was God looking
[2:09:46] for what what was he looking for that no
[2:09:49] man in the heavens the Earth beneath the
[2:09:55] Earth praise the Lord
[2:09:58] amen that's how much the fall in the
[2:10:02] beginning how much sin has def defied
[2:10:06] the the the human
[2:10:08] nature sin has defied the human nature
[2:10:12] right whether you are born in holy
[2:10:14] wellock your parents were in the church
[2:10:16] from the day they were born you were
[2:10:18] born in the church born in the message
[2:10:19] whatever whatever Lang you can use for
[2:10:22] yourself we are all polluted defied by
[2:10:25] the sinful nature and no man is
[2:10:29] worthy until that ly nature comes
[2:10:35] in until that L Nature comes in when men
[2:10:39] are ready to submit to the word of God
[2:10:42] above our better
[2:10:44] judgment you calling the word of God
[2:10:46] into question will your character come
[2:10:49] on now will your character born of a
[2:10:52] woman born in sin then you bringing
[2:10:54] God's word into question with your
[2:10:57] character
[2:10:59] amen praise the Lord
[2:11:01] amen that was one of the thing when you
[2:11:04] read the book of job that was one of the
[2:11:06] thing that job never
[2:11:08] did job held his Integrity but he had a
[2:11:12] fine line to know that God was more
[2:11:15] righteous the man that's right that's
[2:11:17] right
[2:11:19] amen that's right he held his Integrity
[2:11:22] he says I know I'm not a sinner I have
[2:11:26] tried to do my best
[2:11:29] but the
[2:11:31] almighty is more righteous than man and
[2:11:35] I can never bring him into
[2:11:42] question praise the
[2:11:44] Lord I can never bring him into question
[2:11:51] oh praise the Lord you love the Lord
[2:11:54] this morning this afternoon glory be to
[2:11:57] God Amen
[2:11:59] Hallelujah who is
[2:12:01] wanting to open the book take the seals
[2:12:04] loose the seals thereof if God don't
[2:12:07] help us we will die in our sin die in
[2:12:11] our
[2:12:14] self-righteousness we need the help of
[2:12:16] God Amen if we can just be like Paul
[2:12:21] that great
[2:12:22] messenger yet he could have the
[2:12:24] knowledge the the the language to say oh
[2:12:27] Wretched Man I am who will deliver me
[2:12:31] from this death Paul never said that
[2:12:33] when he was an unbeliever he was a
[2:12:35] Believer he was a messenger of the age
[2:12:38] right but he still saw himself as a
[2:12:41] Wretched Man that needed God
[2:12:55] love the
[2:12:56] Lord praise the
[2:12:58] Lord oh may God may God help us may he
[2:13:04] come to our
[2:13:06] rescue
[2:13:08] amen may God come to our
[2:13:15] rescue may God
[2:13:19] come to our
[2:13:23] rescue oh praise the
[2:13:26] Lord
[2:13:28] hallelujah
[2:13:33] man oh
[2:13:41] man I read I read to you
[2:13:45] here um couple of weeks ago there from
[2:13:48] from uh question brother man
[2:13:54] says what God struggle with is to get a
[2:14:00] man is to get a
[2:14:04] man that he can take from a
[2:14:07] humble
[2:14:09] beginning and that man will remain
[2:14:11] humble
[2:14:14] right he says as soon as God begin to
[2:14:17] bless a man he starts to step out of
[2:14:20] that place
[2:14:23] right says God want a
[2:14:26] man
[2:14:28] that will remain
[2:14:30] humble look through all the scripture
[2:14:32] you see
[2:14:34] there see it in David see it in
[2:14:44] Moses man that can remain
[2:14:46] humble it's not it's not all about
[2:14:49] carrying ourself wretched and I mean
[2:14:51] you'll just be lying to yourself you
[2:14:53] know I mean you you decide to to I mean
[2:14:57] to dress carelessly just to show you are
[2:15:00] humble you just lying to
[2:15:03] yourself praise the Lord the humbleness
[2:15:06] God is looking for this a man that can
[2:15:08] humble himself to the word yes sir
[2:15:11] that's right praise the Lord that can
[2:15:13] humble himself to the word when the word
[2:15:16] speaks all our argument is done
[2:15:19] amen HJ praise the Lord he says Amen to
[2:15:24] that well the Lord bless you the Lord
[2:15:27] bless you want to go into another
[2:15:30] session of this but we keep it for
[2:15:32] another time what I really wanted to
[2:15:34] bring out was this place in Revelation
[2:15:36] chapter 5 to show the
[2:15:42] nature that is
[2:15:45] needed for the dove to come
[2:15:49] on so
[2:15:53] when the prophet said the do leads the
[2:15:56] eagle many men has buil Ministry around
[2:16:00] it they thought that they were the dove
[2:16:03] to lead the ego that is the
[2:16:07] prophet but if you look in Revelation
[2:16:09] chapter 5 you will see what he
[2:16:12] mean because the dove can only leave the
[2:16:15] lme in nature so how will the dop Le the
[2:16:18] ego until the ego has a ling
[2:16:22] nature
[2:16:24] amen until the ego has a ling
[2:16:28] nature and uh
[2:16:32] uh and he was says I want the dove to
[2:16:35] fly into my
[2:16:37] heart Bring me God's Sweet Love on the
[2:16:40] wings of a snow white dove the Holy
[2:16:43] Spirit bring it to me tonight Lord and
[2:16:47] drop into my heart the faith that I have
[2:16:51] need
[2:16:52] of
[2:16:54] Amen so I mean that's where we are in
[2:16:58] our walk with
[2:17:01] God in our walk with
[2:17:06] God God has already set here the scene
[2:17:09] is
[2:17:11] set you can look at every Old Testament
[2:17:14] character if we want to run through it
[2:17:17] we can be able to tell which anointing
[2:17:20] was on
[2:17:21] whether it was a lion whether it was a
[2:17:23] ox whether it was a
[2:17:25] man why would God call Nebuchadnezzar my
[2:17:30] seven he said nebz my seven brother Del
[2:17:34] just preach here on Wednesday night a
[2:17:36] purpose for
[2:17:38] God purpose of God and a purpose for
[2:17:43] God God raised of
[2:17:46] pharaoh amen he was under the man's
[2:17:49] anointing
[2:17:51] a stubborn one
[2:17:53] too but you see at the end of it God
[2:17:55] destroy him the same thing with
[2:17:59] nebz he was under the man's anointing
[2:18:02] and he start to break all of these
[2:18:03] things I have done about God destroy him
[2:18:05] for that why because they never had the
[2:18:09] nature
[2:18:11] yes to be able to
[2:18:13] realize that it is not
[2:18:17] me it's Christ that live in me
[2:18:25] you can run it all
[2:18:27] through all through the scripture you
[2:18:30] can run
[2:18:34] it and if we would get anywhere with
[2:18:39] God we must begin with the lamb
[2:18:43] nature praise the
[2:18:45] lord we must begin with the lme
[2:18:49] nature it's a beast
[2:18:52] of
[2:18:53] sacrifice is surrounder is is
[2:18:57] Right amen praise the Lord it surrounder
[2:19:01] is well to the word it has to be to the
[2:19:09] word so the dove leading the
[2:19:12] eagle speaks of our age this is the ego
[2:19:16] age it's not speaking of any individual
[2:19:21] that there will be people under this
[2:19:24] great revelation of
[2:19:28] God that's why we have make a mess of
[2:19:31] it we have make a mess of it we like to
[2:19:35] blast
[2:19:36] denomination but the worst worse has
[2:19:38] happened in our range that's right we
[2:19:41] have made a mess of it amen why because
[2:19:44] we lack the
[2:19:46] nature to be able to carry this
[2:19:48] responsibility
[2:19:50] the
[2:19:51] responsibility of the message of the
[2:19:53] hour the responsibility to carry the
[2:19:56] Mistress of God
[2:20:00] yes amen it does not need your high
[2:20:03] school graduation certificate or whether
[2:20:06] you from college or did a master degree
[2:20:08] that's not what it needs it needs a lme
[2:20:10] in nature
[2:20:21] musicians you can
[2:20:22] come I'll leave
[2:20:26] [Applause]
[2:20:33] you oh may God help
[2:20:36] us may God help us amen praise the Lord
