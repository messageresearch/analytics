[31:14] where it showed me that this was the
[31:16] right song it says um

[31:22] man in his nature is a rebellion against
[31:25] god he doesn't he's against god but god

[31:44] looking isn't there somebody still that
[31:47] wants to love the lord with all their
[31:49] heart

[42:03] musician just stay here for a while
[42:07] praise the lord
[42:09] you are all warmly welcome
[42:13] to the house of god once again
[42:17] we know when we are away a lot of things
[42:19] happen
[42:21] so it's always heartwarming
[42:24] to come back
[42:26] and now we're able to see everybody's
[42:27] face
[42:29] and uh that gives us the assurance
[42:33] that we are all pressing on the upward
[42:35] way
[42:36] because guess what
[42:38] the battle
[42:40] continues
[42:42] yes till
[42:45] god decides to wrap it up
[42:48] the battle continues
[42:51] yes
[42:53] just expect a battle
[42:56] don't be a coward
[43:00] when you step out there
[43:02] just
[43:04] know that somehow
[43:06] god is believing in you god is trusting
[43:08] in you to go
[43:11] and when the opportunity comes don't let
[43:13] god down
[43:16] how many people were blessed on
[43:17] wednesday night
[43:19] praise be to god
[43:22] that was just a wonderful
[43:24] atmosphere what a wonderful time with
[43:27] the lord
[43:28] we have been so blessed
[43:30] in this assembly
[43:32] that we have seen the arm of god
[43:36] time and again
[43:38] praise be to god and if christ harris we
[43:41] know that we are going to see more of
[43:42] him
[43:43] there is no doubt whatsoever
[43:47] whatever seed god has planted
[43:50] he is going to water it
[43:53] and that seed
[43:55] in its own season
[43:57] praise be to god
[43:58] would blossom
[44:00] and would bear fruits and nothing will
[44:02] stop the program of god
[44:05] you know a lot of the times when we read
[44:07] the scriptures
[44:08] we we want to identify ourselves with
[44:10] the good characters
[44:12] and we hardly
[44:14] want to identify ourselves with the bad
[44:16] characters
[44:18] but if you follow that last wednesday
[44:20] service closely
[44:22] that even in the bad characters
[44:25] we are reflected
[44:27] when you look at the judases
[44:30] there is a fears
[44:32] the abiram the chorus
[44:35] the detains
[44:39] mention them
[44:41] we are reflected
[44:43] in all these characters
[44:48] judas
[44:49] saw christ
[44:51] and there was no second chance for him
[44:54] as the preacher said on wednesday
[44:58] can you think of the number of times you
[45:00] have sold him
[45:03] and you are associated here
[45:07] a lot of times a lot of us have not been
[45:09] faithful in our tithing
[45:11] can you think of the number of times
[45:13] you've been unfaithful
[45:14] and you are still here
[45:19] some people lifted their voices against
[45:21] the prophet of god and the earth opened
[45:23] its mouth and swallowed them up
[45:25] can you think of the number of times
[45:27] you have lifted your voice against the
[45:29] word of god and you are still seated
[45:31] here
[45:36] some people got themselves defiled with
[45:38] the ornaments
[45:41] that god warned them not to
[45:43] and the second they never got a second
[45:45] chance
[45:46] can you think of the number of times you
[45:48] have defiled yourselves
[45:51] with the ornaments of this thing
[45:53] of this life
[45:55] their sins and their trespasses and you
[45:57] associated here
[46:01] this brings me back
[46:02] to the vision brother branham saw
[46:05] when he saw a world hanging in the air
[46:07] surrounded by a rainbow
[46:10] and god told him that the angel i mean
[46:13] the rainbow is the blood of christ that
[46:16] is just keeping the wrath of god
[46:19] but for that blood
[46:21] that blood on the mercy seat
[46:24] praise be to god
[46:26] this makes you to appreciate the grace
[46:29] of god more
[46:32] it makes you to appreciate the grace of
[46:35] god more
[46:37] there's something people did and never
[46:39] got a second chance you have got a
[46:41] second third four fifth till you can't
[46:43] even count it
[46:47] but for the blood of christ
[46:50] who are we
[46:52] wonderful jesus praise be to god
[46:55] god is so merciful
[46:57] and do not take the grace of god for
[46:59] granted
[47:02] what the grace of god has done for you
[47:06] never take it for granted
[47:08] it was just a wonderful time of
[47:10] fellowship
[47:11] god knows our needs
[47:14] god will supply our needs according to
[47:16] his riches in glory
[47:19] but
[47:20] the most important thing
[47:22] don't ever play that place the card
[47:24] before the horse
[47:26] the most important things of life
[47:29] should never be overlooked
[47:34] where adam
[47:36] fell that relationship he had with god
[47:39] as we heard on wednesday that is where
[47:41] christ is bringing us back to
[47:44] that relationship
[47:46] if you don't have a relationship with
[47:48] god
[47:49] guess
[47:50] what
[47:52] you can have all the blessings of this
[47:54] world
[47:55] you are the most miserable creature that
[47:57] ever lived
[48:01] it is better to have christ
[48:03] and to die
[48:06] to die a proper
[48:09] to die
[48:10] to die with christ
[48:12] in your soul
[48:14] knowing
[48:16] that when this life comes to an end
[48:17] there is a better one that is awaiting
[48:19] you
[48:20] than to die with all the riches on
[48:23] clothes
[48:24] and then you get to the end of the road
[48:27] and you don't know where you're going to
[48:29] spend eternity
[48:33] praise be to god
[48:35] it was a wonderful time
[48:40] this morning
[48:42] brother one is not here

[49:12] him
[49:14] never on any day on any occasion
[49:18] just gather up because it's sunday

[49:23] but have
[49:24] something on your heart
[49:26] always come expecting

[49:35] and do not come looking at a man
[49:38] come
[49:39] trusting and believing in god
[49:42] praise be to god so this morning
[49:45] [Music]
[49:46] bradajaro is going to minister for us
[49:50] he is not a new face and if he was after
[49:54] last sunday i mean
[49:55] last wednesday
[49:57] he was no longer a new face
[49:59] praise be to god
[50:01] before we call him in
[50:04] as a musician softly play
[50:07] we are going to go before the lord in
[50:08] prayer
[50:10] i have two prayer needs here
[50:14] um
[50:16] please pray for sis irene
[50:26] will not be
[50:28] in service this morning because
[50:31] of stomach issues
[50:33] she is doing online service this morning
[50:36] praise be to god this is coming
[50:39] from sis kelly
[50:41] and then our agent prayer request
[50:45] from sis naomi
[50:46] my sister-in-law her name is judy
[50:50] has
[50:52] that covey demon bordering her

[51:06] we are giving god all the serious
[51:07] problems
[51:09] there is nothing impossible in his name
[51:11] [Music]
[51:13] christ not only died for our salvation
[51:15] he also died
[51:17] for our healing
[51:19] because the bible has made it
[51:20] categorically clear
[51:22] that he was wounded for our
[51:24] transgressions and he was bruised for
[51:26] our iniquities and the chastisement of
[51:29] our peace was upon him and by his tribes
[51:32] we were healed so we have a promise
[51:36] and we are just going to remind god of
[51:38] his promise concerning us praise be to
[51:40] god
[51:41] and i also want to take this opportunity
[51:43] to remember my wife sister too

[51:47] she's been complaining of fatigue
[51:49] tightness here and there

[51:54] of god this morning
[51:55] we trust
[51:57] that god by his grace would visit every
[51:59] one of us as we stand
[52:01] praise be to god
[52:06] and if you have any special need
[52:09] any unspoken request

[1:02:05] his mercy
[1:02:07] and uh
[1:02:09] bringing us here safely this morning
[1:02:12] i believe the lord has something for us
[1:02:14] this morning
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:17] i strongly believe that
[1:02:22] may the
[1:02:23] 31st
[1:02:25] borough owner myself and a few of the
[1:02:28] ministers who traveled to alaska
[1:02:31] and every bit of the trip just show
[1:02:34] hindrance
[1:02:36] and uh
[1:02:38] i left brother one on them in anchorage
[1:02:40] and i was flying to shivac uh you know
[1:02:42] shivac is where brother andrew
[1:02:44] and the brethrens they are amen
[1:02:48] i don't call them eskimos because they
[1:02:50] crack a choke on that
[1:02:52] and they say they say the turbo fleet
[1:02:54] and then say you call us eskimos and you
[1:02:57] eat raw meat say eskimo meat eaters of
[1:03:00] raw meat say we don't eat raw meat you
[1:03:02] do so we crack jokes on that
[1:03:04] so i was fine down there i got to the
[1:03:06] airport
[1:03:08] and uh
[1:03:10] they said there was no flight for me
[1:03:12] and then i knew that the lord wanted me
[1:03:15] to be there by all means
[1:03:17] because there was just obstacles after
[1:03:20] obstacles after obstacles at that point
[1:03:23] in time i just rested my mind i called
[1:03:25] brother andra said there is no flight
[1:03:28] and
[1:03:28] and shivac is not like it's not a city
[1:03:31] you're going into the the village and so
[1:03:34] maybe probably maybe one or two flight
[1:03:35] and that's it
[1:03:37] and they have those little uh shuttles
[1:03:40] they just trusted god and then
[1:03:43] finally they got a flight and
[1:03:46] one of them the man that was standing
[1:03:47] there say where you where you going i
[1:03:49] said shiva said what are you going to do
[1:03:50] there
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:55] i said there are people there
[1:03:57] and i'm going to go see those people
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:00] and so we're driving and and
[1:04:02] we're talking about let's get it let's
[1:04:04] get a ticket so that way we don't uh
[1:04:07] we don't get into the rubbles of the
[1:04:09] wedding and all of that and not be able
[1:04:11] to get a ticket so we got a ticket we
[1:04:13] taught
[1:04:15] and i got to the airport and i was about
[1:04:16] to check in my baggage this morning what
[1:04:18] i was already driving away
[1:04:20] and
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] the machine said you can't check in your
[1:04:24] baggage 12 hours ahead of time
[1:04:27] and then i called the lady and said can
[1:04:29] you come help me out please and she said
[1:04:31] uh
[1:04:32] it looked like you got the wrong ticket
[1:04:34] and so i looked at my phone i said maybe
[1:04:36] i'm using the ticket for
[1:04:38] my trip back to virginia so
[1:04:40] i kind of looked back again and said no
[1:04:42] this is the right ticket
[1:04:43] and then we realized that when we're
[1:04:45] booking the flight but i won't got
[1:04:46] actually 7 p.m flight so the devil
[1:04:48] didn't want me to be here
[1:04:50] so
[1:04:51] so when i thought of it 7 p.m i said my
[1:04:55] it just got real and uh we have to do
[1:04:57] something on this one so i went to the
[1:04:59] counter i told ladies is there where we
[1:05:01] can change it let's say you have to pay
[1:05:03] the difference i said it doesn't matter
[1:05:04] because
[1:05:05] i have to be in minnesota this morning
[1:05:08] amen
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:10] god being so kind
[1:05:12] i got to the counter talked to the lady
[1:05:13] and she looked in and checked the flight
[1:05:15] and she said there was a flight for this
[1:05:17] morning and the flight was just our
[1:05:19] schedule i got the flight amen yeah am i
[1:05:22] this morning amen praise god so
[1:05:24] so that means we're gonna have uh
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:33] that means we're gonna have a good
[1:05:35] service this morning amen
[1:05:37] what makes it good is you amen
[1:05:40] you say
[1:05:41] why is it a good service
[1:05:44] because we are trying to really
[1:05:45] understand christianity from the true
[1:05:46] perspective that he came to the
[1:05:48] gentiles see the perspective that
[1:05:50] christianity came to the agenda was lost
[1:05:53] even after god sent a prophet
[1:05:55] to revamp and clear the darkness that
[1:05:58] covered true christianity
[1:06:00] people made creed and dogma courts and
[1:06:03] society out of the light that the
[1:06:05] prophet brought to show you what true
[1:06:07] christianity really is the gentiles
[1:06:10] don't know what true christianity is
[1:06:13] we don't
[1:06:15] even the jews
[1:06:16] when christianity came to them they
[1:06:18] didn't know what it is
[1:06:22] so god have to raise a man who was
[1:06:25] persecuting the christians god had to
[1:06:28] raise him and actually bring the true
[1:06:32] teaching of what christianity really is
[1:06:34] peter didn't know what christianity is
[1:06:37] right after the holy ghost in acceptable
[1:06:39] he didn't really know what it is
[1:06:41] they were still going to they was going
[1:06:43] to the temple they were they didn't know
[1:06:46] what they didn't know what this is
[1:06:50] they were eating and they separated from
[1:06:52] gentiles they didn't understand what
[1:06:54] this is they thought they were still in
[1:06:55] judaism and they just received holy
[1:06:57] ghost
[1:06:58] so they've got the holy ghost but they
[1:06:59] still have some old square teaching they
[1:07:02] didn't really understand what
[1:07:03] christianity is
[1:07:04] and here was paul who really he was
[1:07:06] baptized and soaked into judaism
[1:07:10] it was it he was a
[1:07:13] student of judaism he understands
[1:07:16] judaism like his back like the back of
[1:07:18] his finger he know what judaism was
[1:07:21] and here was paul with all those
[1:07:23] knowledge he felt that these were some
[1:07:25] crazy people
[1:07:27] trying to bring abomination trying to
[1:07:29] desecrate judaism and he was ready to
[1:07:32] wipe them out
[1:07:36] and then god will meet him on the way
[1:07:40] and god will tell him that i am jesus
[1:07:44] now you don't get you don't have a clue
[1:07:46] of that
[1:07:47] this man only know one god you know many
[1:07:49] god
[1:07:50] even you're true this morning i won't be
[1:07:52] one of them
[1:07:56] but this man only know one god that's it
[1:08:01] his shoes his belt is careful everything
[1:08:04] about a jew speak of god everything
[1:08:09] when you are going into your house there
[1:08:11] is something they have on the wall it's
[1:08:13] called the mezuzah they have to kiss it
[1:08:14] there's a scripture on it
[1:08:16] on their head they have to tie a
[1:08:17] scripture on it on their hand they have
[1:08:19] to type scripture they have to attach
[1:08:21] scripture all over their body
[1:08:23] and then they also have to have a big
[1:08:25] scroll to read from so a jew is a man
[1:08:27] that is struck is so struck into one god
[1:08:31] all those scriptures talk about one god
[1:08:34] it's not about how you get a job there's
[1:08:36] nothing about that to the jew
[1:08:38] everything about those scriptures is
[1:08:41] about god god god god god
[1:08:45] and so this man who knows about that one
[1:08:47] god and the rituals and the traditions
[1:08:49] and all those things that that one god
[1:08:51] has set in place some
[1:08:53] group of juveniles came up and they they
[1:08:57] claimed they want to turn israel upside
[1:08:59] down
[1:09:00] they've just nailed their master to the
[1:09:02] cross
[1:09:03] and they told that was the end of the
[1:09:04] story
[1:09:05] and now they saw what they nailed to the
[1:09:07] cross multiplied in 120 people you see
[1:09:09] this is going crazy we thought we just
[1:09:12] nailed this into the cross they nailed
[1:09:14] it to the cross and it exploded on 120
[1:09:17] amen and they tried to nail 120 he
[1:09:20] exploded to 3 000. they tried to nail it
[1:09:23] at the explanation of 5 000. it doesn't
[1:09:25] begin to explode
[1:09:27] and but abraham said they thunder the
[1:09:29] seven thunder is like a rocket it
[1:09:31] explode they bring a five-star that
[1:09:33] five-star bringer and it just become
[1:09:35] infinite there is no end to its
[1:09:37] explosion
[1:09:40] but yeah it has exploded to us
[1:09:42] and now we begin to handle it with
[1:09:44] levity because we don't even know what
[1:09:46] we're holding
[1:09:49] you don't even know what's in your hand
[1:09:50] you're holding the most precious thing
[1:09:53] in your hand and you don't know what it
[1:09:54] is
[1:09:55] it's about you
[1:09:58] so we're going to continue from where we
[1:10:00] stop on wednesday because on wednesday
[1:10:01] was a continuation of on sunday which
[1:10:04] the son of god was talking about the
[1:10:05] quickening power which most people often
[1:10:08] misunder they misinterpret
[1:10:11] amen when they get quickening power
[1:10:13] they're thinking of leaning on somebody
[1:10:14] and god healing that person no that's
[1:10:16] not what we're talking about
[1:10:18] we're talking about god producing
[1:10:19] children on earth that's what quickly is
[1:10:22] all about
[1:10:24] john received quickening power he never
[1:10:26] performed one miracle until his head was
[1:10:28] cut off probably the only miracle we
[1:10:30] could see was when they chopped off his
[1:10:31] head
[1:10:35] but he received quickening power
[1:10:39] so he goes to show you that quickening
[1:10:40] power goes beyond just creeper walking
[1:10:43] blind icing and all of no it goes beyond
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:48] quick neighbor were quicking this man
[1:10:49] until he reflected god that's what we're
[1:10:52] talking about god producing children
[1:10:55] it's not just healing secrets healing is
[1:10:57] everywhere in case you don't know
[1:11:00] there are men giving motivational speech
[1:11:02] this morning and healing is taking place
[1:11:06] because where do you want to be healed
[1:11:08] do you want to be healing your mind or
[1:11:10] you want to be healing your body
[1:11:13] now most of this healing happened in the
[1:11:14] body
[1:11:16] because people science has found out how
[1:11:18] they call it placebo
[1:11:20] they can talk you into drinking water
[1:11:22] and you think you're taking some
[1:11:23] medication and you heal
[1:11:26] when look at my healing this morning
[1:11:28] we're talking about god producing
[1:11:30] himself children
[1:11:32] because what happened in eden what the
[1:11:34] the the breakage in genesis 3 was not
[1:11:37] healing
[1:11:39] god lost children
[1:11:41] god lost a channel
[1:11:43] so from genesis 3 god no longer have a
[1:11:45] child
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:48] adam started having his own children
[1:11:50] and brother abraham kept saying god
[1:11:53] doesn't want to be a grandfather but
[1:11:55] guess what in genesis 4 god became a
[1:11:57] grandfather
[1:11:59] that's your bible but i said god he has
[1:12:02] no grandfather in his program
[1:12:05] but in genesis 4 god became a
[1:12:08] grandfather
[1:12:09] something like something that was not
[1:12:10] part of his program came to
[1:12:12] manifestation
[1:12:15] if you read the book of luke and the
[1:12:16] book of matthew read the chronological
[1:12:18] of jesus christ and when you hit when
[1:12:21] you come to said it says said the son of
[1:12:23] adam i don't know who the son of god
[1:12:26] amen so said cannot if you ask said who
[1:12:29] is your father he can't say god because
[1:12:31] god was not his father his father was
[1:12:33] adam but if you ask adam who is your
[1:12:36] father adam will tell you his father is
[1:12:38] he said god
[1:12:40] so adam have a direct link to god as a
[1:12:43] father but you and i don't have that
[1:12:48] that's bro stealing right there and this
[1:12:50] brush even bro stephen look like we have
[1:12:51] so many steven in this place
[1:12:54] i know i know
[1:12:56] i shook inside i said that's another one
[1:13:00] we have so many stephen in the all over
[1:13:02] the place amen
[1:13:04] look like one goes another concern
[1:13:06] you're only stephen's in this place amen
[1:13:09] it's a beautiful name amen
[1:13:11] so so you find out that god wanted a
[1:13:14] song
[1:13:16] and and and this is serious
[1:13:19] and i pray god help us to see the
[1:13:21] seriousness of it
[1:13:23] that the beauty of the church
[1:13:26] the treasure of the church
[1:13:28] has become a reproach
[1:13:32] the treasure of the church has become
[1:13:35] your approach the treasure of the church
[1:13:36] is not the way you do your hair nobody
[1:13:38] cares about that if somebody care about
[1:13:40] that should be your husband
[1:13:42] another person who cares about how you
[1:13:43] do your hair
[1:13:45] that's the business your business and
[1:13:46] your husband's business it's not my
[1:13:47] business i don't care you do your hair
[1:13:50] that's your business
[1:13:51] and probably the person that helped you
[1:13:52] to do your hair to make money from you
[1:13:54] it's happens in business also
[1:13:57] yeah it's not it's not that's not that's
[1:13:58] not why we're here
[1:14:01] so we're here for a more serious thing
[1:14:03] than that
[1:14:05] and if we hear for something more
[1:14:06] serious than that it means the next
[1:14:08] person doesn't matter when you're having
[1:14:10] that relationship with god
[1:14:12] your wife doesn't if your wife doesn't
[1:14:14] matter when you're having that
[1:14:15] relationship with god you shouldn't be
[1:14:17] ashamed when you're having a
[1:14:18] relationship with god
[1:14:20] there should be no shame and you
[1:14:21] shouldn't even think your brain should
[1:14:23] not even work
[1:14:25] you should just come the way you are
[1:14:28] and just come before god's presence and
[1:14:30] settle your case with god don't worry
[1:14:32] always listening that's not that's not a
[1:14:33] person's business
[1:14:35] it's between you and god
[1:14:36] because god wants to have a son and you
[1:14:38] that is you
[1:14:40] and so that is your business
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:48] i'm going to read the quotes i didn't
[1:14:50] read on wednesday because on wednesday
[1:14:51] we just got the service short
[1:14:54] and i'm just going to read the quotes
[1:14:55] and then we
[1:14:57] will we're going to the message this
[1:14:59] morning and if the musician can uh just
[1:15:02] play that
[1:15:03] the song
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:22] i'm just going to sing a cross of uh
[1:15:25] one of the songs and i'm going to read
[1:15:27] those quotes
[1:15:29] the song says you see god and you see my
[1:15:31] father
[1:15:33] you will always be mine for all of time
[1:15:35] and you are still god
[1:15:48] i pray that song translates into your
[1:15:50] relationship with god
[1:15:54] because god is the god and he see your
[1:15:56] father but you've not known that yet
[1:15:57] you've not really understood it trust me
[1:15:59] you've known that so you've not
[1:16:00] understood christianity yet you're a
[1:16:02] christian you may have got the holy
[1:16:03] ghost you may not go to a point but
[1:16:05] you've not understood you've not
[1:16:07] understood what god has given you
[1:16:09] privilege into you've not
[1:16:12] and that's why you shall change yourself
[1:16:13] so many times
[1:16:15] that's why the devil comes to
[1:16:17] he comes to talk to you so many times
[1:16:18] because he knows you don't really
[1:16:19] understand or you you don't understand
[1:16:22] what you've got you don't understand you
[1:16:23] know you've got something
[1:16:26] but because you don't understand what
[1:16:28] you got
[1:16:30] he knows how to play with your mind
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:34] he
[1:16:35] is a good business man he knows how to
[1:16:37] play with your mind because he knows you
[1:16:40] don't understand what you have
[1:16:43] but the brah didn't understood what he
[1:16:44] had also
[1:16:48] a preacher of heaven and preached of all
[1:16:50] those great evil there were there was a
[1:16:52] reality that was lacking in what he was
[1:16:54] preaching
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:57] but by a preacher of heaven called
[1:16:59] prayer line call all those met the angel
[1:17:01] of god and all of that
[1:17:03] but yet he was afraid of dying
[1:17:07] because he said he thought it was going
[1:17:08] to be a spook
[1:17:10] or like a cloud floating in the air
[1:17:12] without hands to
[1:17:13] shake somebody he said i'm going to say
[1:17:15] all my nervous say oh that's a novel i
[1:17:17] don't have eyes or i don't have hands to
[1:17:19] shake him no more that's what they were
[1:17:20] thinking there was a reality beyond that
[1:17:24] that reality goes beyond just
[1:17:26] intellectual preaching and all of that
[1:17:28] god have to open the great divide take
[1:17:30] him beyond the cutting of time and when
[1:17:32] he came back his side will never be the
[1:17:34] same again
[1:17:37] he said i will never be the same again
[1:17:42] because why he saw a tangible land
[1:17:46] he said to feel the people they hug me
[1:17:50] and when he came back to this dimension
[1:17:52] he said because there is a land beyond
[1:17:55] the river
[1:17:56] he can sing that song without a melody
[1:17:58] but with reality
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:00] that there is a land beyond the river i
[1:18:03] have been there
[1:18:04] and i'm back
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:18] when i was a child

[1:18:58] my love is the same

[1:19:07] oh you still
[1:19:10] know

[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:32] you always be mine
[1:22:35] for all of time
[1:22:40] why do music keep playing
[1:22:43] what abraham said in the message the
[1:22:44] sermon of spirit
[1:22:48] [Music]
[1:22:50] but that's not what the gates of hell is
[1:22:52] against
[1:22:56] the gates of hell is not against your
[1:22:58] job
[1:23:00] that's what motivational gospel has
[1:23:02] brought to us
[1:23:03] the gaze of hell is not against your
[1:23:06] your the house you want to buy it's not
[1:23:08] against your mortgage
[1:23:13] it could use that as distraction it's
[1:23:15] against just one thing
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:18] but that's not what the gains of hell is
[1:23:19] against
[1:23:21] it's against the spiritual revelation
[1:23:24] of christ being here
[1:23:28] the only thing the devil is against is
[1:23:29] not against your job
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:33] it's not against the business you're
[1:23:34] trying to put up
[1:23:36] it's against the spiritual revelation
[1:23:39] that christ is here
[1:23:43] they say yesterday today and forever
[1:23:47] that is the only thing it's a dates
[1:23:55] i'm going to make use of time quickly
[1:23:58] as that song keep playing let's rise up
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:13] you still
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:35] you
[1:24:36] see
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:25:07] you've
[1:25:11] [Music]
[1:25:37] for all
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:47] amen god bless you
[1:25:49] that will be all the singing we have
[1:25:50] this morning
[1:25:52] let's turn to the book of luke
[1:25:59] we're going to be reading luke chapter
[1:26:04] luke chapter 18.
[1:26:10] let's say praise the lord
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:15] if anybody will praise the lord it's
[1:26:17] going to be you and me because we have
[1:26:18] every reason to praise he who show us
[1:26:21] who we really are
[1:26:24] we don't really know ourself and that's
[1:26:25] what we're trying to talk about this
[1:26:26] morning
[1:26:27] because the devil knows that and he's
[1:26:29] trying to play on our mind because he
[1:26:31] knows we don't really know who we are so
[1:26:33] he often plays that's that's a key
[1:26:36] position he wants to stay on he doesn't
[1:26:38] care if you're speaking dog if you cast
[1:26:39] that devil because you know after you're
[1:26:41] done with that jubilee you're going to
[1:26:43] come back to that ignorance of who you
[1:26:45] are he knows that after that wonderful
[1:26:48] special number after you play that drum
[1:26:50] in the spirit after you've played that
[1:26:52] piano in the spirit after you've sanded
[1:26:54] everything he knows that you will come
[1:26:56] out of that presence to your ignorance
[1:26:59] he knows that
[1:27:00] and he's waiting for you
[1:27:02] so when you're done with all those
[1:27:05] jumping around he's waiting and then he
[1:27:07] start to speak to you
[1:27:10] and try to tell you who you are not
[1:27:13] and he knows you are he knows you will
[1:27:14] accept he said he's been in that
[1:27:16] business for years
[1:27:19] it begin to tell you who you are not
[1:27:22] and then your brain starts walking
[1:27:25] and then you begin to keep condemination
[1:27:27] upon yourself
[1:27:29] and then it tells you
[1:27:30] you just did this don't come to church
[1:27:32] and then you listen and you stay home
[1:27:35] you just see the other one it's called
[1:27:37] don't answer the phone and then you
[1:27:38] don't answer the phone oh the dickies
[1:27:39] are coming
[1:27:40] go through this way you saw the dick in
[1:27:42] the walmart hide and you hide and then
[1:27:44] he begin to bring more unfaithfulness in
[1:27:46] your life
[1:27:47] he knows how to play the game
[1:27:49] but you just got to be smarter than the
[1:27:51] devil
[1:27:53] and the only way you can be smarter than
[1:27:54] the devil is to focus on one thing who
[1:27:56] are you
[1:27:57] you may not speak and talk you may not
[1:27:59] perform nothing when you know you are
[1:28:01] you have found the greatest gift
[1:28:06] it's your identity
[1:28:08] everything will be taken away from you
[1:28:10] there's only one thing that nobody can
[1:28:13] take away from you they can take away
[1:28:15] your rights
[1:28:17] which they're already taken away but
[1:28:18] they cannot take away your identity
[1:28:20] let's say praise the lord they can't
[1:28:22] take away your identity they can take
[1:28:24] away your right
[1:28:25] you think you own your house
[1:28:27] you don't
[1:28:29] i was writing a quote to my wife we're
[1:28:31] driving to church i just read that quote
[1:28:32] to her from church eight book i said see
[1:28:34] this house we don't own it we'll be
[1:28:36] driving back from church the government
[1:28:38] could pass a law and won't be able to
[1:28:40] get into that house no more
[1:28:42] but we still have our identity
[1:28:45] no law can take away that
[1:28:47] isn't proceeding you just no during
[1:28:50] covey you see a little bit of it that
[1:28:52] the government can push you to the world
[1:28:54] they can bring more laws
[1:28:56] because they in covet sit that way sit
[1:28:59] away from your wife some husband
[1:29:00] believer would shake their wife so why
[1:29:02] belly wanted their husband to shake
[1:29:03] their head you see that's how man can
[1:29:06] fit into your life and give you laws you
[1:29:08] follow
[1:29:09] and the devil knows how to do that but
[1:29:11] no matter all those laws know who you
[1:29:14] are
[1:29:15] so that when everything is taken away
[1:29:17] you know who you are
[1:29:18] god bless you church
[1:29:20] let's read the book of luke chapter 18
[1:29:22] we're starting him from verse 1 and then
[1:29:25] we'll go to genesis
[1:29:31] before rescue let's bow down our heads
[1:29:33] almighty god
[1:29:34] any man can flip open these pages and
[1:29:36] speak motivational words but lord may
[1:29:39] you find entrance into our heart this
[1:29:41] morning
[1:29:42] this is our desire blessed master
[1:29:44] in jesus gracious then we pray amen
[1:29:48] and and and speak this parable unto
[1:29:52] satan
[1:29:53] whis trusted in what
[1:29:56] that's i'm reading
[1:29:58] luke 18 verse 9 and respect this parable
[1:30:01] unto certain we structured in what
[1:30:06] they trust in themselves
[1:30:08] that they wear what
[1:30:12] and what
[1:30:14] okay so these guys are trusted in
[1:30:16] themselves
[1:30:17] now the trust that they have in
[1:30:18] themselves is that they wear what
[1:30:21] righteousness
[1:30:22] and they despise others
[1:30:25] now you're going to find out
[1:30:26] righteousness is not trusting in
[1:30:28] yourself
[1:30:29] it goes a long way from that
[1:30:31] now but this this parable jesus is
[1:30:33] giving is about those who trusted in
[1:30:36] themselves
[1:30:38] that they were righteous
[1:30:40] and they despise others
[1:30:42] we're going to continue from where we
[1:30:43] stop on wednesday
[1:30:45] with the condition for sunday it's not
[1:30:48] just jumping or shouting i'm not worried
[1:30:50] about you jumping but i'm worried about
[1:30:52] god finding entrance to your heart and
[1:30:53] my heart that's what we're here for it's
[1:30:55] not just the emotional part of it it's
[1:30:57] about us living here with weapons to
[1:30:59] beat the devil
[1:31:00] it's not beating them by singing song
[1:31:02] but beating devout of your own life
[1:31:04] that's what we're talking about so the
[1:31:05] same beating devil is not beating the
[1:31:06] devil in the brother he's beating the
[1:31:08] devil out of your own life that's what
[1:31:10] we're talking about
[1:31:11] so you find out here
[1:31:13] these two men say and the speaker speak
[1:31:16] this parable unto satan which trusted in
[1:31:18] himself that they were righteous
[1:31:21] and despise others
[1:31:23] two men went up into the temple to pray
[1:31:26] the one a pharisee and the other
[1:31:28] republican
[1:31:30] the pharisee stood and prayed to us with
[1:31:33] himself
[1:31:34] god i thank thee that i am not as old
[1:31:38] men are
[1:31:39] extortionary unjust a daughter or even
[1:31:42] as this republican there were two of
[1:31:44] them in the church that day
[1:31:48] this this republican
[1:31:51] i fast twice in the week i keep tight of
[1:31:54] all that i possess
[1:31:56] and the republicans standing afar off it
[1:31:59] was far
[1:32:01] it was starting to far off
[1:32:04] the republicans standing up far off
[1:32:07] would not lift up so much as his eyes
[1:32:11] onto heaven
[1:32:12] but smooth upon his breasts
[1:32:15] saying god
[1:32:17] be merciful to me a sinner
[1:32:21] see the public can recognize the
[1:32:23] presence it was in
[1:32:25] he recognized where it was in
[1:32:27] so he stood that far off and he let us
[1:32:29] say lord be merciful to me a sinner
[1:32:33] when you come into god's presence what
[1:32:35] are you going to be saying will you be
[1:32:37] beating your chest or you'll be asking
[1:32:38] for mercy
[1:32:41] i tell you this man went
[1:32:44] i tell you this man went down to his
[1:32:46] house justified rather than the other
[1:32:50] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[1:32:52] be a base and he that humble at himself
[1:32:56] shall be exalted let's turn to the book
[1:32:58] of genesis
[1:33:00] chapter 15.
[1:33:14] genesis 50 will read from verse 1.
[1:33:17] after these things the word of the lord
[1:33:19] came unto abram in a vision saying fear
[1:33:22] not abraham
[1:33:24] i am thy shield
[1:33:26] under a seating great reward can you
[1:33:28] imagine you just wake up in the morning
[1:33:30] bro stephen
[1:33:31] all these tvs now
[1:33:36] amen you just wake up in the morning and
[1:33:38] you just hear god say
[1:33:40] i am your shield brother aaron i'm your
[1:33:42] exceeding great reward oh man you don't
[1:33:44] need to go to work that day you know
[1:33:45] what i'm saying just like oh yeah we
[1:33:47] could we could call it we could call it
[1:33:48] off today look at the rapture it's going
[1:33:50] to happen right now
[1:33:51] because god telling you that
[1:33:53] not the pastor saying god himself
[1:33:55] communicating that to you i am your
[1:33:57] sealed and i am your exceeding great
[1:33:59] reward
[1:34:02] now when god was done with that what
[1:34:04] would we have expected i said my abraham
[1:34:06] would have had some jubilee
[1:34:08] but that's not what happened here
[1:34:11] and abraham said lord god
[1:34:13] what would that give me god already said
[1:34:15] i am your reward
[1:34:18] but say see you see i told you the devil
[1:34:20] knows you very well he knows how to beat
[1:34:22] your head
[1:34:24] it's his job he said he said and abraham
[1:34:27] said lord god what would that give me
[1:34:30] see i go childless and the steward of my
[1:34:33] house is this eliza of damascus
[1:34:37] and abram said
[1:34:38] beyond to me thou has given no seed
[1:34:42] and lord one born in my house is my hair
[1:34:46] and behold the word of the lord came
[1:34:48] unto him saying
[1:34:50] this shall not be thine hair
[1:34:53] but he that shall comfort out of that
[1:34:56] own bowel shall be done here
[1:34:59] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[1:35:02] look now towards heaven and tell the
[1:35:05] stars if thou be able to number them and
[1:35:08] he said unto him
[1:35:10] so shall thy seed be
[1:35:12] and he believed the lord
[1:35:14] and what
[1:35:20] now think of you shall be seated now you
[1:35:21] may be seated right now
[1:35:24] you see the irony of those two
[1:35:25] scriptures
[1:35:27] some trusted in themselves
[1:35:29] that they were what
[1:35:32] they didn't stop there they trusted in
[1:35:34] themselves that they were righteous and
[1:35:36] they condemn all that they despise
[1:35:38] others
[1:35:41] so there is something that make them to
[1:35:43] trust in themselves they didn't just
[1:35:45] wake up from themselves say oh no
[1:35:46] there's something that made them to do
[1:35:48] that
[1:35:49] something placed them in that platform
[1:35:51] or that pedestal where they feel they
[1:35:54] can trust themselves and they can
[1:35:56] despise others
[1:35:59] now brother brown was saying in the
[1:36:01] church book he said the cycle of revival
[1:36:04] and of death has never ceased
[1:36:07] ecclestic would say there is no new
[1:36:10] thing under the sun
[1:36:11] now what has happened before is what
[1:36:14] will happen again but just new
[1:36:16] characters playing the same old script
[1:36:20] so we find out here in the scripture we
[1:36:22] just read the lord jesus gave us these
[1:36:25] two men who went to the temple to pray
[1:36:28] and one of them he came just as he was
[1:36:31] but the other fellow he didn't come just
[1:36:33] as he he didn't come he didn't sing that
[1:36:34] song anyway he came justifying himself
[1:36:39] because he think he was doing something
[1:36:41] that makes him righteous so because of
[1:36:44] that he despised this other man this i'm
[1:36:46] not just like this man i do this i do
[1:36:48] that and he was counting all he was
[1:36:50] doing i paid my time and all this man
[1:36:52] was saying he was correct
[1:36:56] he was correct in all he was saying amen
[1:37:00] and we follow the story
[1:37:03] we follow the story and we pick out
[1:37:05] these two these two characters in in
[1:37:07] verse 9 to 14 of luke and we have the
[1:37:11] story of the pharisee and we have the
[1:37:13] story of republican so this story is
[1:37:16] going to swim all this way and it's
[1:37:18] going to enter chapter 19 where brother
[1:37:20] brown would take the message uh
[1:37:22] zacchaeus the businessman and all many
[1:37:24] of those messages about circus will be
[1:37:26] from chapter 19. now you're going to see
[1:37:29] something very interesting in chapter in
[1:37:32] chapter
[1:37:33] 18
[1:37:34] in verse
[1:37:35] 18 of chapter 18.
[1:37:38] now let's look at 18 uh
[1:37:41] uh 18 18.
[1:37:43] i'm going to lay the scripture first and
[1:37:45] then we'll go into
[1:37:47] the message
[1:37:49] 18 18 has this to say and a certain word
[1:37:52] ruler asks him saying good master what
[1:37:55] shall i do to what
[1:37:58] do i do on board so he say
[1:38:01] good master what shall i do to inherit
[1:38:03] eternal life
[1:38:07] now this man he he wanted to know what
[1:38:10] he needed to do to inherit eternal life
[1:38:15] that's why he left his house that was a
[1:38:17] quest in his heart what do i what have i
[1:38:19] got to do i want to do something to
[1:38:21] inherit eternal life
[1:38:26] now watch this young man
[1:38:28] and watch the man
[1:38:30] in in uh uh
[1:38:32] chapter
[1:38:34] chapter
[1:38:36] 18 verse 11.
[1:38:38] watch that man in chapter 18 verse 11
[1:38:40] and watch this young man
[1:38:42] like i told you this story is going to
[1:38:44] snake its way all the way into chapter
[1:38:45] 19.
[1:38:48] and jesus said unto him why colors thou
[1:38:51] mean good not as good save one that is
[1:38:54] god
[1:38:55] that knows the commandment do not commit
[1:38:58] adultery what did this man say in
[1:38:59] chapter chapter
[1:39:02] 18 verse 11 what is this what was he
[1:39:04] saying
[1:39:06] did he say it wasn't a daughter did he
[1:39:07] hear him say that
[1:39:10] oh yes
[1:39:11] he said it he said it
[1:39:12] the pharisees stood and prayed to us
[1:39:15] within himself saying god
[1:39:17] i thank thee that i am not
[1:39:20] as
[1:39:22] other men
[1:39:23] are extortionate just what is next you
[1:39:26] see there i'll talk right that's what he
[1:39:28] said
[1:39:29] he said it
[1:39:30] so follow carefully we're going
[1:39:32] somewhere and that we're going inside
[1:39:34] the bible that's where we're going we're
[1:39:35] taking a journey
[1:39:36] now we see this young man
[1:39:38] because jesus just told you a parable
[1:39:40] and that reality is setting into the
[1:39:42] parable
[1:39:44] and he's done telling this parable and
[1:39:46] then we see a really strong man
[1:39:49] and this man wants to have eternal life
[1:39:53] and they say master what do i need to do
[1:39:55] and jesus begin to tell him what he
[1:39:57] needs to what he he should have been
[1:39:59] doing
[1:40:00] thou knowest the commandment do not
[1:40:03] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:40:06] do not bear false witness
[1:40:08] another father and a mother
[1:40:11] and he said what
[1:40:13] all these have i came from my youth up
[1:40:18] this man
[1:40:20] has kept all these commandments from his
[1:40:22] youth up
[1:40:23] and still he knew
[1:40:25] there was a vacuum about the question of
[1:40:27] eternal life
[1:40:30] nobody knew that
[1:40:32] nobody knew that when they see himself
[1:40:34] this brother is very lovely he's very
[1:40:35] obedient he's very kind he respect his
[1:40:38] father he's always in service he pays
[1:40:39] his dad he's offering he doesn't run
[1:40:41] about with the women out there and all
[1:40:43] of that he has a good testimony
[1:40:47] but himself there is something he knows
[1:40:49] that nobody knows
[1:40:51] but today he took the challenge
[1:40:53] to to go for a quest what will i do to
[1:40:56] fill that gap
[1:40:58] what's this question
[1:41:00] what will i do to have eternal life
[1:41:03] now what he was expecting is another
[1:41:05] task
[1:41:07] but what needs to be done to have
[1:41:10] eternal life you're going to find out
[1:41:11] that there is no task that man has to do
[1:41:15] it is what god has done
[1:41:18] what man needs to do will be living on
[1:41:20] god
[1:41:22] just lean on god god has done it you
[1:41:24] just have to lean on him
[1:41:27] that's it but man doesn't want that
[1:41:29] man i want to do something so i can he
[1:41:31] just just say i i
[1:41:33] i prayed that was why my wife was
[1:41:35] pregnant oh yeah you prayed very well
[1:41:38] so those who who didn't get their wife
[1:41:40] pregnant they didn't pray
[1:41:42] their prayer didn't go above the roof
[1:41:44] so ma wanna ma one will tell every
[1:41:47] success
[1:41:48] that i did something this happened
[1:41:50] cause an effect that's what you want to
[1:41:52] do
[1:41:53] so grace begin to evade him but he
[1:41:56] doesn't know that
[1:41:58] he's beginning i i do this when i do
[1:42:00] this this happened there is nothing
[1:42:02] you're going to do to bring down god
[1:42:03] there is nothing
[1:42:06] it is the mercy of god that will always
[1:42:08] visit you
[1:42:11] so as much as you can get yourself out
[1:42:13] of the way when you get yourself out of
[1:42:15] the way you're not doing anything anyway
[1:42:17] but when you are in the way you are
[1:42:18] doing a whole lot so when you can get
[1:42:20] out of the way then god can come in the
[1:42:23] way and do what he needs to do
[1:42:24] [Music]
[1:42:26] so can we get out of the way this
[1:42:28] morning
[1:42:31] so this the lord told him
[1:42:34] and he said all these i have kept from
[1:42:36] my youth up
[1:42:39] now when jesus said these things he said
[1:42:41] unto him
[1:42:42] yet lackett's doubt one thing
[1:42:46] sell all that thou has
[1:42:48] and distribute unto the poor
[1:42:50] and thou shalt have treasures in heaven
[1:42:53] and come
[1:42:54] follow me
[1:42:57] and when he heard this he was very
[1:42:59] sorrowful for he was very rich
[1:43:03] and when jesus saw that he was very
[1:43:05] sorrowful he said how
[1:43:08] hardly shall did have riches enter into
[1:43:12] the kingdom of god some of us think that
[1:43:14] he's talking about dollars no you could
[1:43:15] be reaching pride
[1:43:17] you could be rich in arrogancy
[1:43:19] and you can also be rich in religion
[1:43:23] and prayerlessness
[1:43:25] you could have zillions of of of
[1:43:26] prayerless attributes in your life i say
[1:43:29] let us pray you want to channel the
[1:43:30] cross and run out of your ass like a
[1:43:32] like a candle that is shot out of a
[1:43:33] cannon
[1:43:34] i cannot bust out of canon that's
[1:43:36] assimilates prey that's what i was
[1:43:37] devoting oh god guide me my job got me
[1:43:39] and you're already holding your key
[1:43:40] already open the car hello guide me
[1:43:42] guide me guys
[1:43:43] and you are driving to your office are
[1:43:44] you sure you're going to reach your
[1:43:45] office
[1:43:47] how about you settle down and talk to
[1:43:48] the lord before you get out of that
[1:43:49] house
[1:43:50] so even if you don't come back home you
[1:43:52] know that the last thing you did was to
[1:43:53] talk to your creator
[1:43:56] that should be the last thing you did oh
[1:43:57] lord i bless you lord
[1:43:59] it's give me bless me give me bless me
[1:44:01] that's the prayer that we have reduced
[1:44:03] our creator to
[1:44:05] we have reduced gold to sam's club
[1:44:08] where we go to shop
[1:44:10] give me help me bless me give me open
[1:44:13] this open that close up about i lose
[1:44:15] that's what we've reduced go to no
[1:44:17] relationship
[1:44:24] now when jesus heard these things he
[1:44:26] said unto him yet like as thou
[1:44:28] yeah yeah yeah yeah luck has that one
[1:44:30] thing sell all that house and distribute
[1:44:33] unto the poor and thou shalt have
[1:44:35] treasures in heaven and come follow me
[1:44:37] and when he heard this he was very
[1:44:40] sorrowful for he was very rich and when
[1:44:43] jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he
[1:44:45] said how hardly shall they have riches
[1:44:48] enter into the kingdom of god
[1:44:51] for it is easier for a camel to go
[1:44:53] through the through a needle eye than
[1:44:55] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[1:44:57] of god and then i heard it said who dare
[1:45:00] can be saved look at where many
[1:45:02] responders there that is this is serious
[1:45:05] who they can be saved
[1:45:09] and he said the things which are
[1:45:12] impossible with men are possible with
[1:45:14] god
[1:45:15] then peter said lord now listen to peter
[1:45:17] quickly because he know that he has
[1:45:19] followed the script to this point and
[1:45:21] peter said
[1:45:22] lord we have left all and followed him
[1:45:28] see somebody somebody fit the
[1:45:29] description
[1:45:30] we have left all and we have followed
[1:45:33] thee
[1:45:36] and they said unto them verily i say
[1:45:38] unto you you that have left all and i
[1:45:41] follow there's something for you also
[1:45:43] very last song told you
[1:45:45] there is no man that have left houses
[1:45:49] or parents
[1:45:51] or brethren
[1:45:53] or wife or children
[1:45:56] for the kingdom of god's sake
[1:45:58] who shall not receive manifold more in
[1:46:02] this present time
[1:46:05] so
[1:46:07] when your focus
[1:46:09] shifts from those things and your focus
[1:46:12] come to the things of god god is telling
[1:46:14] you you will receive manifold
[1:46:19] he said we shall not receive manifold
[1:46:21] more in this present time and in the
[1:46:24] world to come life everlasting see
[1:46:26] that's what his mom was looking for
[1:46:30] that's what he was looking for
[1:46:32] and so we we go back to our readings on
[1:46:35] wednesday
[1:46:36] because we're going to blend it all like
[1:46:38] i said it's going to be a continuation
[1:46:40] and we're reading the the gospel of
[1:46:41] matthew chapter 10 in mark chapter 6
[1:46:45] and luke chapter 10 verse
[1:46:47] versus luke chapter 9 verse 1.
[1:46:50] in india we read matthew 10 verse 1 he
[1:46:53] said when he had called on to him his 12
[1:46:55] disciples he gave them power against
[1:46:57] unclean spirits
[1:46:59] to cast them out and to heal all manner
[1:47:02] of sicknesses and all manner of diseases
[1:47:05] now slow down as we read that scripture
[1:47:07] and just hear me carefully just hear me
[1:47:09] carefully i see there were some requests
[1:47:11] that was brought this morning abroad dan
[1:47:14] was reading those requests and and the
[1:47:15] church prayed for those requests
[1:47:20] now he said this is jesus the lord jesus
[1:47:22] speaking and when he had called unto him
[1:47:24] 12 disciples he gave them power against
[1:47:27] unclean spirit the first thing you have
[1:47:29] to deal with before you talk about
[1:47:31] divine healing is some clean spirits
[1:47:34] that's the first thing you're going to
[1:47:35] deal with it's a clean spirit
[1:47:38] it says so is to cast them out and to
[1:47:42] heal all manner of sicknesses and all
[1:47:45] manner of diseases
[1:47:49] you see when you cast out unclean spirit
[1:47:52] from your life
[1:47:53] then you have confidence in god
[1:47:56] remember saying if our act condemned us
[1:47:59] not amen
[1:48:01] then we know that when we ask something
[1:48:02] we will receive and so what the devil
[1:48:05] tries to do many times is to bring
[1:48:07] condemnation to your heart
[1:48:10] because once he can bring condemnation
[1:48:11] to your heart he knows that when you are
[1:48:13] praying you it can tweak you you will
[1:48:15] never believe the prayer
[1:48:18] you will pray under the anointing as
[1:48:20] soon as you get out of that place he
[1:48:22] begins to bring elements of deceit that
[1:48:25] will make you to begin to disbelieve
[1:48:27] what you have just prayed for and the
[1:48:29] bible says without faith it is
[1:48:31] impossible to please god god does not
[1:48:33] answer your prayer based on your face he
[1:48:35] does not answer your prayer based on
[1:48:38] your membership in the church he does
[1:48:40] not answer your prayer because you are a
[1:48:41] preacher he does not answer your prayer
[1:48:43] because you are a prophet you only
[1:48:44] answer your prayer on the basis of faith
[1:48:47] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:48:50] god if you want to please god is you
[1:48:53] must have faith
[1:48:57] if you don't have faith
[1:48:59] is upset with you
[1:49:01] this is a serious talk
[1:49:03] right
[1:49:04] and look at what he talks about he said
[1:49:06] all you fools swords of heart to what
[1:49:08] believe
[1:49:10] you see she was addressing his disciples
[1:49:12] he full sources
[1:49:14] little faith because without faith it is
[1:49:17] impossible to please god
[1:49:20] is that a scripture
[1:49:22] i think so i think it's a scripture
[1:49:25] i think so
[1:49:27] that's that sounds like the book of
[1:49:28] hebrews right amen is without faith it
[1:49:32] is no you see we read some scriptures i
[1:49:34] thought that the amenities about
[1:49:35] yourself you don't even know
[1:49:37] just like the disciples they understood
[1:49:39] christianity as they moved
[1:49:42] because they were deep rooted into
[1:49:44] judaism when the holy ghost came the
[1:49:47] only gods did not just wash them like a
[1:49:49] glorious
[1:49:50] and once away their brain no they still
[1:49:52] have their mental faculty they're
[1:49:54] supposed to grow into an understanding
[1:49:57] they have received an experience with
[1:49:58] god in their heart they're supposed to
[1:50:00] grow with their experience into an
[1:50:02] understanding of how to live their life
[1:50:04] but they were carrying a borrowed
[1:50:06] culture
[1:50:08] they were still doing sabbath they were
[1:50:10] still going to temple they were still
[1:50:11] doing all those things even when the
[1:50:13] lord jesus said the hour comment and now
[1:50:16] is that the true worshiper which will be
[1:50:18] the disciples that will receive the holy
[1:50:20] ghost not caiaphas and anas and the
[1:50:22] pharisees no no the true worshipper you
[1:50:24] see there will not worship the father in
[1:50:26] the temple or in the mountain like
[1:50:28] samaritans you see the body will worship
[1:50:30] the father and world in spirit and in
[1:50:31] truth anywhere
[1:50:33] you don't have to be in a beauty no more
[1:50:35] it's in spirit and in truth so don't let
[1:50:37] your revival always be on sunday and
[1:50:40] wednesday prayer meeting your
[1:50:41] development should be everywhere you go
[1:50:45] and we talk about divine healing
[1:50:48] people oh thought potato thought was not
[1:50:50] some hollywood movie thought poor has
[1:50:52] been before but abram came in case you
[1:50:54] don't know that
[1:50:55] right
[1:50:56] oh but abraham spoke school into
[1:50:58] existence that's not a new thing that
[1:50:59] happened
[1:51:00] you said what are you talking about go
[1:51:02] and listen to the message paradox
[1:51:04] and but the brain was showing us paradox
[1:51:06] right from the old testament into the
[1:51:07] day we living
[1:51:09] palace is a supernatural event that
[1:51:11] breaks the law of nature
[1:51:13] and you cannot really fathom it in your
[1:51:15] mind and one of the paradox what abraham
[1:51:17] gave us is how a man will speak to the
[1:51:20] moon and the sun and god obey his voice
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:27] and so but the blood spoke to existence
[1:51:29] that's not even so great because the
[1:51:31] brown spokes couldn't resistance under
[1:51:33] the blood of jesus christ moses spoke
[1:51:36] fleeing to resistance under the brother
[1:51:37] boost and of course
[1:51:41] so just in common too
[1:51:43] this man is speaking interested under
[1:51:45] the blood of god himself but this man is
[1:51:48] speaking under under the blood of goat
[1:51:52] who has more faith to express
[1:51:55] he's the man that has the blood of god
[1:51:58] because it's not the blood of god but
[1:52:00] abram was under the blood of christ and
[1:52:02] he spoke something into existence
[1:52:04] but the problem is we have all tied into
[1:52:06] abort abraham but we are not tied into
[1:52:09] god's expression
[1:52:13] it's god's
[1:52:14] expression it's not but abraham knows
[1:52:17] god's expression that's why we have
[1:52:19] misunderstood why god sent buddha
[1:52:21] abraham because we are gentiles that's
[1:52:23] how gentiles are we make idol out of
[1:52:26] anything that comes our way even our
[1:52:28] toothpick
[1:52:33] you use one toothpick and you keep
[1:52:34] keeping it keeping it they are still
[1:52:35] burnt small inside the the package three
[1:52:38] they will say no i love it i just i just
[1:52:40] like the way it's clean i just like
[1:52:41] doing just try nothing
[1:52:46] see this is the life we live in
[1:52:48] we make i do out of every little thing
[1:52:51] there's an old saying a friend of mine
[1:52:53] used to say you see when you when you
[1:52:54] say i must i must i must get the
[1:52:57] satisfaction uh
[1:52:58] that i must get the money what out of
[1:53:01] this clothes that i'm wearing he said to
[1:53:03] turn you to the madman because if you
[1:53:05] buy that suit two million dollars he
[1:53:07] said i'm not i've not yet worried two
[1:53:10] million dollar word and you keep wearing
[1:53:11] it they say pasha you stitch it you see
[1:53:14] this coat is very expensive i must the
[1:53:16] money that i bought i must i must i must
[1:53:18] get the feeling out of it and it got
[1:53:20] turned this way you stitch it at the end
[1:53:22] of it or you'll be putting on rag
[1:53:25] because you're trying to get the value
[1:53:27] out of it
[1:53:28] so we find out that as you read the
[1:53:30] scriptures say he gave unto them what
[1:53:33] power
[1:53:34] the power is to take out unclean spirit
[1:53:37] once there is no clean spirit there you
[1:53:40] can relate with god
[1:53:42] because the problem why you are not
[1:53:43] related with god effectively is because
[1:53:45] of unclean spirits
[1:53:47] something you have done they have made
[1:53:48] you to do and and then they bring those
[1:53:50] condemnation upon you now they say don't
[1:53:52] come to us don't do this and don't do
[1:53:53] that don't even don't even show your
[1:53:55] face you are not even worthy don't even
[1:53:57] read the bible don't even pray you are
[1:53:59] condemned you are going to hell and you
[1:54:00] begin to listen to that voice
[1:54:04] and you think it is you that is thinking
[1:54:05] it it's not you thinking somebody's
[1:54:07] talking to you
[1:54:10] amen
[1:54:12] so we say we didn't say on wednesday
[1:54:14] that when you go home there was an
[1:54:15] assignment for everybody and i was
[1:54:17] surprised my mass daughter came to me
[1:54:19] gracie came to me said he said bro
[1:54:21] stephen what is the message church
[1:54:24] the young lady wanted to search on clean
[1:54:26] spirit
[1:54:29] that serious happening somebody is
[1:54:30] listening
[1:54:33] and when she said i was like my goodness
[1:54:36] i said when you go home search not just
[1:54:38] only the message search the scripture
[1:54:40] type the word unclean spirit
[1:54:42] and when you type it look at your life
[1:54:47] don't look at it don't look at your wife
[1:54:48] because most of the time you know us
[1:54:50] brother i want to want to show it that
[1:54:52] you are the minister your wife is the
[1:54:53] unbeliever you know you want to work on
[1:54:55] her
[1:54:56] god has told you to work on her to make
[1:54:58] her a bride
[1:55:00] and you forget that jesus is not
[1:55:01] marrying you you are part of the bride
[1:55:03] also
[1:55:05] yeah this is the reality this is the
[1:55:07] reality and we have a lot of distance to
[1:55:09] creep in and we we brought loose air and
[1:55:11] but the problem said the seventh engine
[1:55:13] message was to tie up the loose end and
[1:55:15] we are creating more loose end again in
[1:55:17] our family in our day-to-day life we're
[1:55:19] creating more loose ends the message and
[1:55:21] the minister of willem brown was to tie
[1:55:23] up the loose end and bring it to us as
[1:55:26] the word of god because luther has a
[1:55:29] loose end to how he saw god he didn't
[1:55:31] really see god in his clarity that's why
[1:55:33] he smoked pipe and drank beer why was
[1:55:35] interpreting the bible
[1:55:37] today if you see one of your dickens
[1:55:38] drinking beer and smoking pipe you you
[1:55:40] know that something has gone wrong with
[1:55:42] the church you better find an exit and
[1:55:43] be running for your life but luther did
[1:55:45] that that was half i saw god in the
[1:55:47] relationship and god was god was okay
[1:55:49] with what relationship was having with
[1:55:51] luta he was not okay with the beer and
[1:55:53] the the pipe he was smoking but god was
[1:55:56] okay with the relationship he was having
[1:55:57] with luta because you know that that was
[1:55:59] a foundation that was leading to
[1:56:00] something else and it led to something
[1:56:02] else uh john wesley came up and said we
[1:56:04] must sanctify our life we can't smoke
[1:56:05] pot you see god led into something else
[1:56:08] and we still begin to preach
[1:56:09] sanctification and all of that and then
[1:56:11] that was not the end of it i said we
[1:56:12] don't just have to live a clean life we
[1:56:14] must also be able to express the
[1:56:16] attribute of god miracles that are
[1:56:18] coming we call it a pentecostal and uh
[1:56:21] but the brain will come saying it's not
[1:56:23] just miracles and all of that god have
[1:56:25] is identified by his characteristic the
[1:56:27] miracle and all those things have to
[1:56:29] vindicate the world
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:33] so you can have miracle
[1:56:35] and that miracle does not vindicate
[1:56:36] nothing
[1:56:38] and you can also have miracle that
[1:56:39] miraculous confirming something now but
[1:56:42] the difference between both abraham and
[1:56:44] many ministries you see today is that
[1:56:46] they have miracles about abraham have
[1:56:48] there's no miracle but abraham have that
[1:56:49] somebody have not have and someone is
[1:56:51] not having today but the difference is
[1:56:53] that god is giving this miracle to show
[1:56:55] you that i'm bringing out the clarity of
[1:56:58] the scripture through this man that's
[1:57:00] what god is bringing down but this man
[1:57:02] somebody just believed god and god
[1:57:03] healing to that person
[1:57:05] so if this man bene or any of this
[1:57:07] pentecostal minister if they ever throw
[1:57:10] a challenge what are you say if what i
[1:57:12] have been preaching all these years if
[1:57:14] it is not true god don't hit the
[1:57:16] nobody will be healed
[1:57:18] because god will never vindicate lie it
[1:57:21] will not be getting error
[1:57:23] will only vindicate truth so while
[1:57:25] people don't understand and that's why i
[1:57:27] feel sorry for people who say oh but
[1:57:29] abraham but
[1:57:31] plagiarized and brother abraham did this
[1:57:32] and now they are going back to pentecost
[1:57:36] when we say pentecost not the bible now
[1:57:38] we're talking about the the pentacles
[1:57:40] that we have all these speaking tongue
[1:57:42] and all this gimmick the handwriting
[1:57:44] that's on the wall that's actually what
[1:57:45] they're going to babylon
[1:57:47] so they think they begin to give you
[1:57:49] male likes meat we go sword and all
[1:57:51] these people these men had miracles but
[1:57:53] not according to the scriptures
[1:57:55] they didn't throw a challenge on god
[1:57:57] saying for i am preaching you can't
[1:57:58] preach trinity i said god if this is not
[1:58:00] true if this is true let this people
[1:58:02] walk the people will not walk because
[1:58:03] god is not free amen
[1:58:06] it will never work
[1:58:07] god will only vindicate his word he will
[1:58:10] not vindicate your creed
[1:58:12] somebody might say well so why are these
[1:58:13] words even healing god is honoring
[1:58:15] somebody's fate but if this man
[1:58:17] challenge god god will not heal this
[1:58:19] person
[1:58:20] because if god healed that person it
[1:58:22] means god is saying this doctrine is the
[1:58:24] truth
[1:58:25] but what's brother brown after but the
[1:58:27] brown finish preaching the message but
[1:58:28] abraham said if what i have said is the
[1:58:30] truth he will come down to vindicate it
[1:58:32] time and time and time and time and time
[1:58:35] and time and time
[1:58:37] so that is why i used to say this i
[1:58:39] don't waste my time to try to prove the
[1:58:41] cloud scientifically right if you are
[1:58:44] science degree that's right for you
[1:58:45] because when you can prove god it's no
[1:58:47] longer safe
[1:58:49] you have to believe god
[1:58:51] so why do i believe it because this man
[1:58:53] truly god is what i have said if it is
[1:58:57] the truth come down and vindicate it and
[1:58:59] god came down okay so simple if you say
[1:59:02] this man is lying that's a tall rocket i
[1:59:05] don't even care what joshua said because
[1:59:06] just was not there when god gave me the
[1:59:08] message amen some of the old judgment
[1:59:10] said this joshua said uh people will be
[1:59:13] surprised one day that it's a tall
[1:59:14] rocket i don't care even what will the
[1:59:16] paul say because billy paul was not the
[1:59:17] one i believe the message
[1:59:19] bill paul did not bring the message to
[1:59:20] me
[1:59:21] just not bringing the message to me
[1:59:23] billy because abram did not bring the
[1:59:25] message to me i blessed god for them
[1:59:26] that they also saw the same message i
[1:59:28] saw
[1:59:29] that's what makes us brothers amen but
[1:59:31] they didn't bring it to me we are
[1:59:32] brothers that's that i'm glad i have
[1:59:34] brothers like that i'm i'm so glad i'm
[1:59:37] so privileged that i have breasts like
[1:59:38] that but it did not bring the message to
[1:59:40] me
[1:59:41] god brought it to
[1:59:42] me god brought it to everyone in here in
[1:59:46] different ways
[1:59:47] amen but you got to see that it is god
[1:59:50] that brought it to you because if you
[1:59:52] don't see that as god that brought it to
[1:59:53] you if the man that through whom god
[1:59:55] used if that might begin to find in some
[1:59:57] way then you will follow that man
[2:00:00] but when you can see that this is god
[2:00:02] that came to talk to me when i was a
[2:00:04] catholic priest it was god that came to
[2:00:06] talk to me you are not seeing that man
[2:00:07] if that man says i'm going back today to
[2:00:09] be a catholic christian father i say
[2:00:11] go and may god prosper your way that's
[2:00:13] why you're going but as for me and my
[2:00:14] husband will serve the lord
[2:00:16] [Music]
[2:00:20] god will not vindicate hidden dogma so
[2:00:23] if brother stephen if somebody saying no
[2:00:25] but abraham said this it's not true and
[2:00:28] said this happens and so they it's not
[2:00:30] true we don't have to argue too much
[2:00:33] all we need to do is you go ahead and
[2:00:35] and
[2:00:36] present it the way you want to present
[2:00:38] it and call god on the scene right it's
[2:00:40] not it's america is full of intellectual
[2:00:42] devils
[2:00:45] intellectual devils you can't go to the
[2:00:47] jungle of africa and meet some old lady
[2:00:48] in liberia or nigeria be saying you know
[2:00:50] the torah case he doesn't even know what
[2:00:52] hurricane is you know about the stubborn
[2:00:53] pot to cook food should i have time for
[2:00:55] that foolishness
[2:00:57] she don't have time for that foolishness
[2:00:59] that you're talking about she only knows
[2:01:00] about the daily life she's living are
[2:01:02] you talking about some tall rockets all
[2:01:04] those scientific grammars because she
[2:01:05] should be looking at you like a fool and
[2:01:06] that's what you are the fool has said in
[2:01:08] this side there is no god amen
[2:01:12] you become so smart until you have
[2:01:13] become a fool
[2:01:16] so go ahead talk about what you want to
[2:01:19] talk about say what abraham is first and
[2:01:20] when you are done don't end it there
[2:01:23] don't don't get some clap
[2:01:26] call god down yes because this man after
[2:01:29] any time he talked about oh he said
[2:01:31] those seven ninjas came down and they
[2:01:32] formed that cloud and said oh lord if i
[2:01:35] have said the truth
[2:01:36] you will come down to vindicate it
[2:01:39] he's here
[2:01:41] god
[2:01:41] you you after you say he lied you come
[2:01:44] tell us that he's here and let's see how
[2:01:47] it flows
[2:01:48] it's as simple as that we don't have to
[2:01:50] waste time you don't have to listen okay
[2:01:52] let me watch this video about atlanta no
[2:01:54] no no no no and don't go into fighting
[2:01:57] with those people
[2:01:58] that want to make you a christian let
[2:02:00] everybody go their way and live their
[2:02:01] own life
[2:02:02] if you see those brothers in the road
[2:02:04] hug them shake their hand they are your
[2:02:05] brothers
[2:02:07] they say god jesus
[2:02:08] you just said no i believe that for
[2:02:09] abraham is the one that god made used to
[2:02:11] make the bible play that's fine
[2:02:13] they see your brothers according to
[2:02:15] matthew 25 there were five virgins that
[2:02:17] were blind so they were sick virgins my
[2:02:20] body were blind
[2:02:24] so you should give god praise that
[2:02:25] you're not blind
[2:02:27] and don't don't worry about that man
[2:02:29] just keep giving god praise what god is
[2:02:31] doing for you
[2:02:32] that way you will not have attitude
[2:02:34] towards people
[2:02:35] you will not have unclear spirit coming
[2:02:37] into your whole life
[2:02:39] because of my unclean spirit we want to
[2:02:41] get rid of them
[2:02:42] because the bible we haven't said it
[2:02:44] this way is he a merry heart he led
[2:02:47] faster than what medicine amen
[2:02:49] that's what the bible said
[2:02:51] when you can get that evil spirit at a
[2:02:53] merry heart he led faster than medicine
[2:02:56] that's the scripture in the book of
[2:02:57] proverbs
[2:03:00] so get all these devils don't worry
[2:03:01] about that man open abraham he said that
[2:03:03] okay that's your revelation we're all
[2:03:05] fine god bless you let's i'm still
[2:03:06] moving on on this road as we see we are
[2:03:09] mashing the zion there are so many zion

[2:03:45] that place
[2:03:46] and that's what's worried about what
[2:03:48] brought you in the relationship with god
[2:03:54] so we find out i think we struck that on
[2:03:56] on wednesday and now i wanted to come

[2:04:09] brother brother max holy people bro bill
[2:04:12] in the catholic church in case you don't
[2:04:13] know that
[2:04:14] don't think that because
[2:04:16] we message don't even use that language
[2:04:17] we mess it because you are making the
[2:04:18] denomination but abraham said whomever
[2:04:21] but i must say whoever that bride is is
[2:04:23] a word an individual
[2:04:26] he said perhaps it's not a group of
[2:04:27] people it's an individual and what
[2:04:29] abraham said the new bed is the
[2:04:31] revelation of jesus christ to an
[2:04:33] individual
[2:04:34] it's not for you
[2:04:35] no to you
[2:04:37] and so that reversal come to abrasive a
[2:04:39] comfortable area a comfortable
[2:04:41] mask any complicated bible
[2:04:43] we express the same thing hence we
[2:04:45] gather
[2:04:46] that's what brings us together because
[2:04:48] we met the same god and he brought us
[2:04:50] together
[2:04:52] is that right he brought us together now
[2:04:54] we find that there are many holy people
[2:04:56] in all the structures
[2:04:58] yes
[2:04:59] don't let the devil deceive that they
[2:05:01] are not holy
[2:05:02] because it's holiness
[2:05:04] holiness is when you separate yourself
[2:05:07] unto god
[2:05:10] but that's not the end of your work with
[2:05:11] god
[2:05:12] so there are many people who has had an
[2:05:14] experience with god in the baptist
[2:05:16] church in the seven day adventists and
[2:05:18] in the catholic church and all those
[2:05:19] structures they have separated
[2:05:20] themselves onto god they don't smoke
[2:05:22] they don't smoke because they don't like
[2:05:23] the cigarette no they don't smoke
[2:05:24] because they have a dealing with god
[2:05:26] that make them to think i shouldn't do
[2:05:28] that that's what make them holy
[2:05:31] but they are not righteous right amen
[2:05:34] righteousness and holiness are two
[2:05:36] different things
[2:05:39] this man on the altar was telling
[2:05:41] himself he was thinking of himself that
[2:05:44] i am what i am righteous
[2:05:47] and he was despising others he's
[2:05:49] thinking he said that i am righteous i
[2:05:51] told you thinking does not make you
[2:05:53] righteous
[2:05:55] i think it can make you holy but it does
[2:05:57] not make you righteous
[2:06:00] but this man was thinking in himself
[2:06:02] that i am righteous and this man is not
[2:06:04] good it's not where it has come to today
[2:06:06] many of us say oh we are messing a
[2:06:08] believer that man is not this and you
[2:06:10] will see some baptist people that live
[2:06:11] more godly like that you are your
[2:06:12] condemning
[2:06:13] them amen
[2:06:16] you see some evil some pentacles are
[2:06:18] people who live more better life than
[2:06:20] you and you are condemning them
[2:06:23] they may have not seen that god said the
[2:06:24] prophet but they have a life you don't
[2:06:25] have amen
[2:06:27] amen amen oh it's abrasiving you you
[2:06:31] you're going to the wrong road now
[2:06:33] no it's the road you're supposed to go
[2:06:34] to
[2:06:35] so righteousness and holiness are two
[2:06:37] different things
[2:06:40] time will fail me to bring some few
[2:06:42] characters in the bible abimelech was it
[2:06:44] was he was serving god in all holiness
[2:06:49] have you asked yourself what is the
[2:06:51] difference between abimelech and abraham
[2:06:54] the worship of the same god
[2:06:57] few years later bruh stephen
[2:06:59] goliath will come out from that that
[2:07:01] country because ghat is one of the
[2:07:03] territories of the philistines
[2:07:05] and the king of the philistines one time
[2:07:07] was a godly man happy birth
[2:07:10] few years later they became idol
[2:07:13] worshiper but at that time of abraham
[2:07:15] abby malek worshiped god god came down
[2:07:18] to talk to him
[2:07:21] but years later god became their gone
[2:07:23] how did this happen
[2:07:26] how did it happen that a people that had
[2:07:28] a relationship with god came down and
[2:07:31] talked to abimelech
[2:07:32] that was he he had a relationship with
[2:07:34] god
[2:07:35] i said god you know the
[2:07:37] integrity of my heart i would depart
[2:07:39] from it i'm holy and god said yes that's
[2:07:41] why i didn't kill you
[2:07:42] because you would have been dead
[2:07:45] so i didn't kill you because you you you
[2:07:47] live a holy life
[2:07:48] you wouldn't take this man's wife if you
[2:07:50] know he's his wife so
[2:07:51] i will i will i permit you i pardon you
[2:07:53] for that
[2:07:55] they say
[2:07:56] you see god brother steve was not
[2:07:58] emphasizing on abraham abraham why did
[2:08:00] you like that's not that's not part of
[2:08:02] the discussion
[2:08:04] god told abimelech he said happy meal go
[2:08:07] and meet that man he's a prophet let him
[2:08:09] pray for you
[2:08:10] if he doesn't pray for you you are
[2:08:11] finished not only you your entire nation
[2:08:14] is gone amen so go meet him now does
[2:08:17] that justify now praise god amen we can
[2:08:20] lie if you lie you it shows who you are
[2:08:23] that does not justify life
[2:08:26] because you see that lie that abraham
[2:08:27] light went on to isaac also isaac also
[2:08:30] take the same life
[2:08:34] but
[2:08:37] it's quite a logical lie
[2:08:39] [Music]
[2:08:41] it's a logical lie yeah
[2:08:43] because when abraham was talking about
[2:08:46] it he said yes he's my sister but from a
[2:08:48] different mother
[2:08:50] to justify what is the question was not
[2:08:53] whether she's your sister from a
[2:08:54] different mother is she your wife
[2:08:56] no she's not my wife that's the question
[2:08:59] the question was plain is she your wife
[2:09:02] no she's not my wife because you cannot
[2:09:04] marry somebody's ex-wife that was why
[2:09:06] they were asking him that question he
[2:09:08] said your wife no she's not my wife okay
[2:09:09] i can't have her now they took her away
[2:09:11] but it's a logical lie and brother brown
[2:09:13] would like that same logical lie
[2:09:16] his lawyer would be calling him i'm
[2:09:17] saying look like oh i have a broken
[2:09:19] loose and that that task case was almost
[2:09:21] running him crazy and brother brown said
[2:09:23] tell him i'm not in here he told his
[2:09:25] wife to to lie say tell him i'm not in
[2:09:27] here. and then i said billy and then he
[2:09:30] jumped out of the house am i there
[2:09:33] it's logical it's logical but they still
[2:09:36] lie because you went out to say you are
[2:09:38] not eating
[2:09:40] and but the brain will say this way
[2:09:43] he said not only did i sin against god i
[2:09:46] made my wife to do it also
[2:09:50] now watch carefully we'll talk about
[2:09:52] clean spirit we want to follow it from
[2:09:53] the prophet
[2:09:54] so maybe that will humble many of us
[2:10:00] did he get on by abraham to lie it's a
[2:10:01] clean spirit
[2:10:04] i know some people they remember abraham
[2:10:05] god said oh wow we're just going to beat
[2:10:07] our blessing when he come out of the
[2:10:08] church he has insulted our god if you go
[2:10:10] to some places they will beat you up for
[2:10:11] saying that
[2:10:13] but we're talking about god's word
[2:10:16] what is about true christianity
[2:10:18] that god sent a prophet to open our eyes
[2:10:20] so see clearly
[2:10:22] and brother abraham
[2:10:23] will go and be praying for somebody
[2:10:25] because take your ass off you hypocrite
[2:10:27] right see you cannot minister you see
[2:10:29] what the scripture said there
[2:10:31] after you have casted on clean spirit
[2:10:32] then you can heal all manner of diseases
[2:10:35] but he was trying to heal all manner of
[2:10:36] diseases without casting that unclean
[2:10:41] are you spirit me at all
[2:10:43] i don't know if you
[2:10:44] follow me carefully because this is you
[2:10:45] are me we are we are amen the angel of
[2:10:49] god said take your hands off you rebuild
[2:10:50] abraham and abraham told the boy's
[2:10:53] father say he said excuse me i have
[2:10:55] something to do what to make right
[2:10:58] i have something to make right how many
[2:11:00] of us have someone to make right this
[2:11:01] morning
[2:11:04] what are you waiting for
[2:11:06] i'm going to do this here i'm going to
[2:11:08] do this you may not have ness yet but i
[2:11:10] say i'm going to have i have a son to
[2:11:12] make right and problem drove to the to
[2:11:14] the lord's place that's what i said when
[2:11:16] i when you called i was actually in the
[2:11:17] house
[2:11:20] oh my gosh do you know the thoughts that
[2:11:23] was running through the brain's mind at
[2:11:24] that point in time the devil said your
[2:11:26] ministry will end yeah
[2:11:28] after you are done
[2:11:30] they will say you are lying when you are
[2:11:31] saying the truth so you are afraid this
[2:11:33] drug don't god if you tell that man they
[2:11:35] will say the prophet of the hour it will
[2:11:37] be new york times it will be in cnn that
[2:11:40] will improve life you see the devil if
[2:11:42] it was just easy that but the blood just
[2:11:43] went to that man the devil was speaking
[2:11:45] to his mind
[2:11:46] the same way the devil speaks to your
[2:11:48] mind not to make your wrong right
[2:11:53] to keep that unclean spirit
[2:11:55] but for you to cast out unclean spirit
[2:11:57] you must have hatred for it amen you
[2:12:01] must hear it
[2:12:03] you must have any
[2:12:05] if you miss about cleanness that have
[2:12:07] slipped into your life
[2:12:09] if you don't hear it it will remain
[2:12:11] there
[2:12:12] and if you don't hear it ask god to give
[2:12:14] you hatred
[2:12:17] there's a quote for that but abraham
[2:12:18] said god create hatred for sin in my
[2:12:21] heart
[2:12:23] oh yes that's what the brahman said
[2:12:25] he said create hatred for sin in my
[2:12:27] heart he said because sin is appealing
[2:12:31] so you need the grace of god to create
[2:12:34] hatred for that appealing to him
[2:12:38] you must be honorable
[2:12:39] since that we must be on board don't
[2:12:40] just carry out
[2:12:41] we are we we are only something by his
[2:12:44] grace
[2:12:49] well something by his grace so you find
[2:12:51] out there that
[2:12:54] people are holding these choices so
[2:12:56] holiness is when you separate something
[2:12:59] when something is separated onto the
[2:13:01] lord that thing becomes holy
[2:13:04] that's what you have in the temple you
[2:13:06] have holy vessel holy veil uh holy
[2:13:09] lantern because they downtime just like
[2:13:11] any other lantern but what make it holy
[2:13:13] was because he separated it unto the
[2:13:15] lord
[2:13:16] the holy vessels in the house of god
[2:13:18] that uh
[2:13:19] better says her we used to drink wine
[2:13:21] and the hand of god would come down and
[2:13:23] write on the world men and men had to
[2:13:24] kill for sin and all of that the reason
[2:13:27] that you call it a holy vessel is
[2:13:29] because that vessel was made by
[2:13:33] was named basilia uh the craftsman who
[2:13:35] was
[2:13:38] very skillful in artificial work of
[2:13:40] brass and all of that god would give
[2:13:42] moses uh this inscription tell him how
[2:13:45] to make it and i would give them vision
[2:13:47] see god we show them why it is in heaven
[2:13:49] and this man will replicate those
[2:13:50] vessels on earth and they will separate
[2:13:53] them to the house of god
[2:13:55] that make that
[2:13:56] cup
[2:13:57] a holy cup
[2:14:01] it's not because they wrote holy on it
[2:14:03] it's because it was separated for god's
[2:14:05] use that's why it's holy but it's not
[2:14:07] righteous
[2:14:08] because writer said it take one thing to
[2:14:11] make something righteous
[2:14:13] and you know what it is believe
[2:14:17] abraham believed god and it was what
[2:14:20] counted to him for righteousness
[2:14:25] paul we pick that same scripture and
[2:14:27] show that we are also
[2:14:29] children of faith abraham so the same
[2:14:32] road abraham passed is the same road you
[2:14:34] are now we are passing we believe god
[2:14:37] that's what make us righteous
[2:14:40] but that's not what makes you holy
[2:14:44] because righteousness is what god does
[2:14:47] for you
[2:14:48] amen holiness is a fight you will fight
[2:14:51] every day
[2:14:53] righteousness is what god does for you
[2:14:56] like what abraham would say salvation is
[2:14:58] a free gift
[2:15:01] but i said character is not a gift
[2:15:04] it's a victory you must win every day
[2:15:07] and to be holy it's not a gift you must
[2:15:09] fight every day with this devil
[2:15:12] but the problem one place he was saying
[2:15:14] is i was telling my wife i find a
[2:15:17] critical spirit coming on me that's what
[2:15:19] the realm said right and he said church
[2:15:21] he not brought it to his church he said
[2:15:23] church pray for me
[2:15:25] i don't want that thing on me oh man
[2:15:28] you see what i'm saying but abraham
[2:15:30] himself death with this unclean spirit
[2:15:34] he said i don't want that thing or me
[2:15:37] how many of us want to know this morning
[2:15:39] okay
[2:15:40] but some of us have it
[2:15:42] if not all of us
[2:15:44] but do you hate it
[2:15:47] you don't
[2:15:48] that's not the end of your story you can
[2:15:50] ask god to give you hatred
[2:15:52] you see god made permission on both
[2:15:54] sides of the fence
[2:15:57] when you pray and you don't feel faith
[2:15:59] you don't feel enough grace to believe
[2:16:01] ask god to give you faith
[2:16:07] don't just let it be like i try and miss
[2:16:09] no ask god to give you faith we serve a
[2:16:12] living god when we've done what we need
[2:16:14] to do when we've cleaned all these
[2:16:16] devils that are bordered our mind when
[2:16:18] our heart does not condemn us the
[2:16:20] opposite there will no god answer
[2:16:22] but when you are condemned the bible
[2:16:24] says god is greater than your heart
[2:16:32] amen we're going to be closing i'm just
[2:16:34] going to read some few quotes we're
[2:16:35] going to be drawing it to the close amen
[2:16:45] i'm going to read a quote from the
[2:16:46] message recognizing your day on this
[2:16:47] message i'll be paragraph 83
[2:16:50] but abram said
[2:16:52] why do we do that
[2:16:54] why do we do that
[2:16:58] they want a great awakening that's what
[2:17:00] everybody's talking about oh there's
[2:17:01] going to be a great revival thought pool
[2:17:03] and all of this all of that thoughtful
[2:17:05] is just the life of god in the believer
[2:17:06] in the third realm that's it
[2:17:08] it's not something falling from the sky
[2:17:10] it's not some new discovery from pluto
[2:17:12] no it's the same christianity that has
[2:17:15] always been and but abraham only used
[2:17:17] different terminology as it relates to
[2:17:19] our generation that's it
[2:17:22] but i'm saying whatever and are working
[2:17:24] to be awakening
[2:17:26] they are good people why is it
[2:17:29] what have they done they have not
[2:17:31] recognized the awakening of the bride
[2:17:36] these are good people this is what i'm
[2:17:38] talking about brother and sister more
[2:17:40] jack moore of shreveport louisiana
[2:17:43] he said by being christians they feed
[2:17:45] the pool of the hour but they haven't
[2:17:47] recognized what ha what what's been done
[2:17:51] see they just really prove but they
[2:17:52] don't know what is going on in reality
[2:17:54] oh there's going to be a great survivor
[2:17:56] there's going to be this they're going
[2:17:57] to be dead that's because they're
[2:17:58] christians
[2:17:59] they're christians that's why they are
[2:18:01] feeling that
[2:18:02] but they're missing something that's
[2:18:04] what's making them feel that way they
[2:18:06] know something is supposed to happen but
[2:18:08] see
[2:18:09] they are looking for it way off in the
[2:18:11] future to come when it is already
[2:18:14] happening right by you
[2:18:17] they're looking way far away
[2:18:19] when it's already happening right by you
[2:18:23] but abram is going to tell us in the
[2:18:24] message feast of the trumpet and he's
[2:18:26] going to tell us that the holy ghost was
[2:18:28] bound
[2:18:29] by what the river of creed and dogma
[2:18:33] from reaching the people
[2:18:35] now what really happened
[2:18:37] what i'm talking about but bruh was
[2:18:39] talking about the book of acts which
[2:18:42] is not the act of the apostles is the
[2:18:44] act of the holy spirit in the apostles
[2:18:47] that brother steve was truncated
[2:18:50] and but the brown would tell us in the
[2:18:51] church book how it happened he said it
[2:18:54] was crooked ministries
[2:18:58] he said the word that was used there is
[2:19:00] nika nico later you see they begin to
[2:19:03] conquer the lady
[2:19:05] they begin to make them feel that it is
[2:19:07] only through the preachers that god can
[2:19:10] be seen that's the love of the devil
[2:19:13] see the reason god called uh uh your
[2:19:15] brother one uh brother uh ariel or any
[2:19:18] of the ministry that you all go to see a
[2:19:21] team protest or any ministry that's ever
[2:19:23] passed away the reason god called him is
[2:19:24] to be a servant i have not seen where
[2:19:26] servants beat their chest before the
[2:19:28] master's children
[2:19:29] but in this generation it's happening
[2:19:31] amen
[2:19:32] the servants want to become the lord
[2:19:35] so we all suffer that's about that's
[2:19:37] about all the story is and someone to
[2:19:39] show you who you really are that is the
[2:19:42] the meant is to show you who you are and
[2:19:45] that's how we cut through thick and
[2:19:46] peace just to show you who you are
[2:19:48] because you don't know who you are some
[2:19:50] of us think that we are we are meant to
[2:19:51] be going to club houses
[2:19:53] some of us think that we are just out
[2:19:55] there to have five jobs and not come to
[2:19:56] church that's what we think but my job
[2:20:00] is to fight trunatic darkness to grab
[2:20:02] you and show you you are beyond dollar
[2:20:05] sign
[2:20:06] that's my job
[2:20:08] when i need that and i pray it is god
[2:20:11] show him who he is
[2:20:14] because when you can know you are then
[2:20:16] there will be no pressure anymore
[2:20:18] it's good the time is going to come
[2:20:21] that's not going to be preaching in the
[2:20:22] millennium because we've known who we
[2:20:24] are
[2:20:25] we are in training we are so all the
[2:20:27] purpose ephesians 5 is that god sent us
[2:20:30] 5-4 ministry for what our identification
[2:20:34] so that you can see who you are in the
[2:20:36] scriptures
[2:20:38] you can be able to see clearly so when
[2:20:40] you open the bible you are not just
[2:20:42] reading stories
[2:20:43] you are actually seeing the manuscript
[2:20:46] of your life
[2:20:47] and so you are you are looking back to
[2:20:49] page and looking at yourself just like
[2:20:51] that was praying in the morning when we
[2:20:53] read the bible we see ourselves in every
[2:20:56] story when your spirit your life
[2:20:59] manifested through somebody that day you
[2:21:01] will see it
[2:21:03] nobody may see it your wife may not see
[2:21:05] it but that will hit you boom
[2:21:09] and if you read that scripture
[2:21:10] intellectually you will not see it
[2:21:12] that's why trust listen don't read the
[2:21:15] bible in haste
[2:21:17] if you don't have time make time right
[2:21:19] but don't ever read the bible in haste
[2:21:23] don't
[2:21:24] if you have two minutes spend that two
[2:21:27] minutes to read if you don't have two
[2:21:28] minutes don't just open to it and then
[2:21:30] you are running no no spend time
[2:21:33] create time because when you treat the
[2:21:36] bible in a sacred way that is the only
[2:21:38] way you can get something sacred from it
[2:21:41] you're wondering why we're not seeing it
[2:21:42] why is this not happening why is that
[2:21:44] not happening why this is not happening
[2:21:45] look josh
[2:21:47] healing can happen anytime in your life
[2:21:50] this is why i told the church back home
[2:21:53] i say any time bro jordan any time you
[2:21:56] feel the presence of the pillar of fire
[2:21:58] ask god for the impossible
[2:22:00] you could be in your bathroom singing
[2:22:02] when it comes down you don't have to be
[2:22:04] in the church you could be your car
[2:22:05] singing when it comes down you cover me
[2:22:07] in your office doing your job
[2:22:09] and then it comes down when it comes
[2:22:11] down ask god for the impossible
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:16] that is how it has always been you want
[2:22:17] to go ask god that thing you feel that
[2:22:19] is so impossible to overcome ask god for
[2:22:22] it it could be in the service it could
[2:22:24] even be walmart oh yes
[2:22:27] yes
[2:22:28] and you never say glory to god
[2:22:29] hallelujah
[2:22:31] and they say she's crazy that's what
[2:22:33] they said
[2:22:35] but they don't know that any man that's
[2:22:37] not crazy is not a living being

[2:24:16] god has a ministry
[2:24:18] you see the devil has deceived people
[2:24:20] that i am the one that can talk it
[2:24:21] better you are just being foolish
[2:24:24] because you are not the one that wants
[2:24:25] you to begin with
[2:24:27] it is you talking when you are giving
[2:24:28] motivational speeches
[2:24:30] 17 steps to become a rich man 14 step or
[2:24:33] not to control your home if you want to
[2:24:34] know all those steps read your bible
[2:24:36] amen

[2:24:39] earned dollars on silly books
[2:24:43] 14 steps on how to become a remodel all
[2:24:46] those steps are in here
[2:24:48] and if you don't understand that listen
[2:24:49] to the tape right it will explain what
[2:24:51] those steps are
[2:24:52] and we cannot spend money on books and
[2:24:54] then before you know it we are spending
[2:24:55] money on books you buy those books we
[2:24:57] never have time to read it right
[2:25:00] let me touch one of those from clean
[2:25:01] spirit this word is a very wicked one
[2:25:03] amen
[2:25:05] many of us know it has come on us many
[2:25:07] times
[2:25:09] the preacher will be preaching bro steve
[2:25:11] i said you always go bro steve
[2:25:14] because we have so many stephens here
[2:25:15] amen
[2:25:17] and brother bill we'll try that we could
[2:25:18] try that we could try josh also
[2:25:21] and we could try emmanuel and god's will
[2:25:24] amen
[2:25:25] there's this devil brother steve
[2:25:27] that if you're not careful with it it's
[2:25:29] a religious one because the most wicked
[2:25:32] of all devils is a religious spirit
[2:25:35] now watch this brought jordan height
[2:25:36] operate the ministry come to preach as
[2:25:39] soon as the minister is on the puppet
[2:25:41] bringing the word of god this unclean
[2:25:42] spirit comes on you
[2:25:44] it diverts your hearing from hearing
[2:25:47] what the minister is saying you are
[2:25:48] writing what the minister said on a
[2:25:50] piece of paper instead of what the
[2:25:53] minister said going into you and showing
[2:25:55] you who you are
[2:25:56] you are actually putting all those
[2:25:58] information in a paper
[2:26:00] and when the service is over you go home
[2:26:03] and you throw that paper in one corner
[2:26:05] you may never see it again until you die
[2:26:09] now the word of god was not made for the
[2:26:11] paper
[2:26:12] the quickening power was meant to go
[2:26:14] into you and bring fruit
[2:26:16] but now you put the quickening power on
[2:26:18] the piece of paper and you're talking
[2:26:20] that paper somewhere
[2:26:21] and that's all about the paper
[2:26:23] and you do it service after service
[2:26:26] after service and when you look at
[2:26:27] yourself it was a glorious meeting what
[2:26:29] was preached you can't even remember the
[2:26:31] title
[2:26:36] everything's just some clean spirit
[2:26:38] it comes from people all the time as
[2:26:40] soon as the minister start talking some
[2:26:42] people that's when they are reading
[2:26:42] their bible they cross their leg
[2:26:46] amen
[2:26:47] and when they leave here they go home
[2:26:48] they never see their bible you see you
[2:26:50] see this we're nothing about prostitute
[2:26:52] no no
[2:26:53] these are the wicked devils
[2:26:56] that when the word of god is coming to
[2:26:58] show you who you are you already know
[2:27:00] these stories that
[2:27:02] you're not paying attention to those
[2:27:03] stories but you're just reading them how
[2:27:05] many of us have felt that before amen
[2:27:07] all right sure we have christians in
[2:27:09] here
[2:27:12] that's what make us christians if you
[2:27:14] guess you don't know
[2:27:15] because the value of the church has been
[2:27:17] watered down their treasure has become
[2:27:19] their reproach it used to be that men
[2:27:22] women will honestly come to the altar
[2:27:24] and confess before god people will
[2:27:26] actually come just as they are and god
[2:27:28] will touch there but what do we have now
[2:27:29] actors pharisees that's what the brother
[2:27:31] said he said pharisees
[2:27:34] write that quote on the puppy the other
[2:27:36] day
[2:27:37] one was translating for him he said
[2:27:40] i wonder i will only get the people to
[2:27:42] god i will get them to the church
[2:27:49] now after this the beginning of brother
[2:27:51] brown ministry one of the key thing god
[2:27:53] gave him was a condition
[2:27:55] and that condition is a condition that
[2:27:57] helps him regulate these devils
[2:28:00] amen what was the condition if only thou
[2:28:04] would be sincere
[2:28:08] it's only sincerity that will make you
[2:28:10] come just the way you are
[2:28:14] if only that will be sincere nothing
[2:28:17] will be able to stand before your prayer
[2:28:20] not even cancer
[2:28:22] church listen to this
[2:28:24] why is it that when you pray things
[2:28:25] stand before your prayer
[2:28:27] i'm not saying maybe you are not sincere
[2:28:31] you are not sincere
[2:28:33] if you are sincere it gives you boldness
[2:28:37] to approach god you are not particular
[2:28:38] say i do that no no you are approaching
[2:28:40] god say father i am here this is my need
[2:28:45] but when you are not sincere before you
[2:28:47] go to god something is coming you did
[2:28:49] this you did that you did this and he
[2:28:50] said well lord we thank you heal heart
[2:28:53] you know your heart that you have not
[2:28:54] even prayed
[2:28:57] that uncleanness in there it will damage
[2:28:59] so many things in your work with god
[2:29:02] the fascinating damage is the fear of
[2:29:06] god it was very dangerous it would
[2:29:09] damage the fear of god
[2:29:12] and look at the church today everyone is
[2:29:13] so happy and all of a sudden what
[2:29:15] abraham said in christmas of god review
[2:29:17] he said the devil we shoot somebody in
[2:29:18] the church with a toxin
[2:29:21] and then before you know it opera comes
[2:29:23] in the church
[2:29:25] if they don't let me
[2:29:27] speak in this church the stress will
[2:29:28] scatter
[2:29:31] ask yourself can you be saved and you
[2:29:33] desire god's word to go in robots
[2:29:38] you want the house of god to go it's red
[2:29:41] if you don't now now let's go down now
[2:29:43] let's come back to the scripture what
[2:29:45] possibly could do that a sinker told us
[2:29:48] i the eye disease
[2:29:50] i will do this i will if i will do that
[2:29:53] i will do this i will sit in the house
[2:29:55] of god i will preach the great message i
[2:29:57] will when i preach it when they let me i
[2:29:59] i i i the eye disease
[2:30:01] brought the devil down
[2:30:07] the eye disease
[2:30:08] took away the fear of god and he was not
[2:30:11] concerned about the kingdom no more he
[2:30:12] wasn't to wreck anything that stands on
[2:30:14] his way
[2:30:16] brother if the eye disease come on you
[2:30:18] you are not finished you can come just
[2:30:20] the way you are i say lord i have
[2:30:22] contacted the eye disease
[2:30:25] something is telling me if i don't
[2:30:26] preach this church should scatter
[2:30:30] how devils can it get you see we're
[2:30:32] talking about religious devils now
[2:30:34] he did not let me preach in this church
[2:30:35] he did not let me on the platform look
[2:30:38] wow
[2:30:40] so let's ask a question what are you
[2:30:42] preaching to us with this kind of spirit
[2:30:47] who are
[2:30:48] who are you trying to preach to
[2:30:50] is he church that's why each and every
[2:30:52] one of us is our obligation to be
[2:30:54] spiritual
[2:30:56] because when you are spiritual
[2:30:58] intellectual message will not feed you
[2:30:59] nothing
[2:31:01] but everybody say you cannot get warmed
[2:31:02] by a painted fire
[2:31:04] attacks most of the some people think
[2:31:06] it's emotional song it's all in the
[2:31:08] flesh it's to play the piano playing and
[2:31:10] you you jump in and after all of that is
[2:31:12] over what kind of life will you leave
[2:31:13] that's right
[2:31:15] that's right
[2:31:18] amen
[2:31:20] i don't talk to my message yet
[2:31:25] yeah i'm going to talk to the message
[2:31:26] down isaiah chapter 1 verse 18
[2:31:38] come now and let us reason together say
[2:31:41] the lord
[2:31:42] though your sin be as scarlet they shall
[2:31:45] be as white as snow though they be red
[2:31:48] as like crimson they shall be as wool if
[2:31:52] you will be willing and what obedience
[2:31:57] now look at that word willing obedient
[2:32:00] it's a willful obedience nobody's
[2:32:02] forcing you to obey
[2:32:04] you just doing it willingly if you are
[2:32:08] willing and obedient
[2:32:11] what will happen
[2:32:13] okay that's what i told that so
[2:32:16] if you are willing and obedient you
[2:32:17] shall eat the fruit of the land but
[2:32:19] whatever is trying to say but if you
[2:32:21] refuse and rebel
[2:32:23] you shall be devoured with the sword for
[2:32:26] the mouth of the lord has spoken it i'm
[2:32:29] going to be speaking on this morning
[2:32:30] come let us reason together an
[2:32:33] invitation to reason
[2:32:36] god is calling you and me to reason but
[2:32:39] the brahman said we are not to reason
[2:32:40] but this is the first time you're going
[2:32:42] to see god is inviting you
[2:32:44] to come and reason
[2:32:48] because you don't know who you are
[2:32:51] and that's our parents that reason with
[2:32:52] their children they are able to transfer
[2:32:56] quality attributes into those children
[2:32:58] if you don't listen with your children
[2:32:59] you'll be a detector that's right
[2:33:03] you'll be you'll be like a bully you
[2:33:04] tell them what to do they don't know why
[2:33:06] they are doing it but when you sit with
[2:33:08] them and you listen with them you find
[2:33:09] how effective it is that when you are
[2:33:12] not there they know why they shouldn't
[2:33:13] do it
[2:33:15] but when you bully them they are only
[2:33:16] seeing your bullying they don't know why
[2:33:18] they shouldn't do it and the nature of
[2:33:20] man is always towards venture
[2:33:23] the moment you say don't do it they want
[2:33:25] to go and do it right away but when you
[2:33:28] can sit down and reason with them
[2:33:32] when god can sit down and reason with
[2:33:34] you to show you why divine healing is
[2:33:38] laying in front of you
[2:33:40] but in your mind like oh if i was in
[2:33:42] brother brahm's time i would have just
[2:33:44] gone say abraham have this cancer i will
[2:33:46] just pass through the prayer line you
[2:33:47] see we are some of us were living in
[2:33:49] that that time
[2:33:51] i thought i was going to speak on today
[2:33:52] but the lord was dragging me to this
[2:33:54] scripture here
[2:33:57] jesus was saying in the book of luke 17
[2:33:59] 22 he said a time will come you will
[2:34:02] desire the days of the son of man you
[2:34:05] will not see it and the bible says he
[2:34:07] was talking to his disciples
[2:34:11] he said you will desire one of the days
[2:34:14] of the son of man but you will not see
[2:34:16] it
[2:34:17] and that's the time we are living in
[2:34:18] today whenever the brown was here i
[2:34:20] would have just gone to his house cancer
[2:34:21] and my chin and will just pray for me i
[2:34:23] would have just gone if i have cancer
[2:34:24] here without your spirit or the pill of
[2:34:25] her that pill of eyes here
[2:34:28] but please unclean spirit has very
[2:34:31] little way
[2:34:32] but it's still here
[2:34:36] he took
[2:34:37] battle of his life to cut off all those
[2:34:40] veils of darkness and we could see
[2:34:42] through a mass ministry to say it's here
[2:34:45] and he said well anybody could say that
[2:34:47] anybody could say it's here bro anybody
[2:34:49] could say here it's here bro bill
[2:34:50] anybody people say that bro josh oh yes
[2:34:53] yeah and then all we see is just grammar
[2:34:55] and logics that's how we see but you
[2:34:58] ever say he's here he said
[2:35:00] your name is josh ali your name is dan
[2:35:02] ali
[2:35:04] no man can say that right oh you are
[2:35:06] depressive and you are praying about
[2:35:08] your uncle insurance please he's putting
[2:35:10] on a blue tie who could say that
[2:35:14] he wasn't bothered
[2:35:16] christ was there
[2:35:18] but he was using his instrument to show
[2:35:20] you beyond every shadow of doubt the air
[2:35:23] can demand not something
[2:35:25] somebody's praying right there sister
[2:35:26] you're praying for swine swanson
[2:35:28] so
[2:35:29] but
[2:35:30] that does not heal you you see that only
[2:35:33] beauty your faith that if this man can
[2:35:36] know that
[2:35:37] oh god help us
[2:35:40] if he can do this
[2:35:42] then he's really yes amen
[2:35:46] the wreck on december 24 1965 did not
[2:35:50] carry him away
[2:35:51] it only carried with the tool that was
[2:35:54] beyond measure showing us that is yes
[2:35:57] yes yes yes yes he said he's here and
[2:36:00] when god together to what i was saying i
[2:36:03] wish he was here i wish he was here i
[2:36:05] wish he was here you see what i'm saying
[2:36:08] you see where we are we're back again
[2:36:10] god won a victory and then we went back
[2:36:12] into the defeat
[2:36:14] god sent barabra to show you beyond
[2:36:16] every side of them that christ is here
[2:36:22] it's not emotion
[2:36:23] it's not a sensation it's a person just
[2:36:26] as you are it's god
[2:36:29] hallelujah amen
[2:36:35] oh amen god help us
[2:36:38] it's not a man
[2:36:40] may god help us to see it amen
[2:36:44] where you can be right there say let us
[2:36:45] pray and you can believe god right from
[2:36:47] there
[2:36:49] i said i don't want to be laying hands
[2:36:51] on the people he said because when god
[2:36:53] hit they'd be thinking like this man
[2:36:54] that is doing it he said when the world
[2:36:56] is coming forward they can believe right
[2:36:59] then it happened in their life
[2:37:00] and they know that it is their faith
[2:37:02] that created it in their life it's not a
[2:37:04] man
[2:37:05] so if the minister does not show up or
[2:37:07] your husband does not show up you know
[2:37:09] god is always there
[2:37:11] they say i will never leave you not
[2:37:13] forsake you that is unfairly what i
[2:37:15] promise
[2:37:17] that trafficking saint paul can hold
[2:37:19] your husband amen

[2:37:57] your mind
[2:37:59] he will never give you time to think on
[2:38:00] anything on clean spirit they are always
[2:38:02] ahead of the game

[2:38:06] everybody won't preach one message you
[2:38:08] don't like it you don't you don't come
[2:38:09] to church no more this is unclear they
[2:38:10] are faithful
[2:38:12] you can bless them for money to evening
[2:38:14] they will be in church very early next
[2:38:15] service day
[2:38:17] very faithful
[2:38:20] they don't say amen to anything you
[2:38:21] preach but they are always in church
[2:38:26] and the message comes and blast them
[2:38:27] blast them brah jordan is praying
[2:38:30] against them all up there suffering is
[2:38:31] praying against them tsunami is praying
[2:38:33] against the unclean spirit that's the
[2:38:35] lord cast them out of my life and the
[2:38:36] next service they are back again
[2:38:38] before you open the door they are
[2:38:39] already here sitting waiting for
[2:38:41] somebody to anoint
[2:38:42] now if they are so desperate how much
[2:38:44] more you
[2:38:48] these are devils
[2:38:49] they have an end so they are fighting by
[2:38:51] all means to wreck to wreck your
[2:38:53] identity
[2:38:55] to make sure you don't know you and that
[2:38:56] is the greatest fight to fight it right
[2:38:59] it's identity war right and it's
[2:39:01] manifested in the natural and that's why
[2:39:03] you see what we call identity crisis
[2:39:07] that's what's going on spiritually when
[2:39:09] the lord jesus came when god came down
[2:39:11] as a man
[2:39:13] what did the devil tell him
[2:39:15] the question of the lord jesus christ
[2:39:18] was
[2:39:18] if you be what
[2:39:20] you see that
[2:39:22] as if being the son of god the evidence
[2:39:24] is turning stone to bread it's not
[2:39:26] that's why people have made it today and
[2:39:28] because you're a song you cast out devil
[2:39:30] say i pray and they were healed god is
[2:39:32] with me that's not an evidence that god
[2:39:33] is with you it could be an evidence that
[2:39:35] you are being cursed amen
[2:39:42] but the devil kept telling the lord
[2:39:44] jesus if thou be the son of god turn
[2:39:46] stone into a bread don't stone the bread
[2:39:49] it's not an evidence of being the son of
[2:39:50] god
[2:39:53] you see but the devil was keeping what
[2:39:55] was they were doing he was giving
[2:39:56] another criteria for you to attain
[2:39:59] sonship
[2:40:02] and that criteria is the one many people
[2:40:04] are taking today i'm the
[2:40:07] i'm the best singer once i sing
[2:40:09] everybody following the anointing you
[2:40:11] see the devil just deceiving you
[2:40:13] [Music]
[2:40:15] i'm the best preacher if i don't preach
[2:40:17] that convention the convention have not
[2:40:18] started you have been deceived by the
[2:40:20] devil right now
[2:40:21] right
[2:40:24] if you be the son of god turn stone to
[2:40:26] bread jesus will tell him the the
[2:40:28] principle he said must have not lived by
[2:40:31] bread alone because abraham said the
[2:40:33] holy ghost
[2:40:34] feed only on the word of god and if you
[2:40:37] are the son of god you only feed on the
[2:40:38] word of god it's not johnny stone to
[2:40:40] bread
[2:40:43] you see what people have gone into
[2:40:45] say miracles happening there
[2:40:47] they get the greatest miracle that can
[2:40:48] happen to the man is when god changed
[2:40:51] your soul and gave you a desire for his
[2:40:53] word
[2:40:54] [Music]
[2:40:57] just imagine just imagine the society we
[2:40:59] are living in today things are getting
[2:41:00] more confusing the government is
[2:41:02] confused everybody is confused ministers
[2:41:04] are confused how will you feel bro steve
[2:41:07] if you open your bible and peace come to
[2:41:09] your heart how will you feel
[2:41:11] they can't that's that's not measurable
[2:41:14] how if this is if you open your bible
[2:41:16] and peace come to your heart
[2:41:19] that's my prayer i always say god
[2:41:21] whenever i open this book let it speak
[2:41:23] to my heart
[2:41:25] because we are getting into tougher time
[2:41:27] right what gives you peace
[2:41:30] is it the new car you have no
[2:41:32] no
[2:41:34] you can imagine why we have road rage
[2:41:36] today what gives some people peace is
[2:41:38] the new car somebody just drive by and
[2:41:39] scratch the bumper they bring out their
[2:41:41] their gun and they shoot that person
[2:41:46] what give you peace is he a wife you can
[2:41:48] kill because of your wife
[2:41:49] if what give you peace is tied to fellow
[2:41:51] love you will keep for it right
[2:41:54] kabab say feel the love is human love
[2:41:58] it's jealous
[2:42:00] but if what gives you peace is the word
[2:42:02] of god after you've had a quarter with
[2:42:04] your husband and you open that world
[2:42:07] and that peace come and then you go back
[2:42:09] to your husband you sit and say honey
[2:42:11] devil can't rule this home
[2:42:13] amen the devil cannot rule this home i
[2:42:16] am sorry for creating that atmosphere
[2:42:19] and your husband says say honey i'm i'm
[2:42:21] sorry also and you hold hands together
[2:42:23] and caster the evil spirit
[2:42:26] you must hate it to cast it out
[2:42:29] well i i i can't apologize to her but
[2:42:32] when i say the man is the head of the
[2:42:33] house if i apologize now she'll become
[2:42:34] the head slowly i can't do that
[2:42:36] i can't i can't do that
[2:42:38] i can't do that no no no no no no no no
[2:42:41] no but the man said the husband is the
[2:42:43] head of the house that when the husband
[2:42:44] comes and it's all beat up the wife
[2:42:46] should come and sit on his lap and and
[2:42:48] cook him good food that's what brown
[2:42:50] said that's a quote
[2:42:55] see sincerity will make you face your
[2:42:57] reality
[2:42:59] many times we are arguing about who is
[2:43:01] right and who is wrong
[2:43:03] see let me say this to you church this
[2:43:05] this morning take this to heart no
[2:43:08] matter what what goes on in your home as
[2:43:10] married couples
[2:43:12] or unmarried or whatever
[2:43:16] take this to your heart don't always
[2:43:18] deal with who is right and who is wrong
[2:43:21] right
[2:43:22] always focus on the middle
[2:43:24] what went wrong
[2:43:27] something just went wrong
[2:43:29] your wife that you feel like she's the
[2:43:31] sweetest in the planet now you're almost
[2:43:33] chopping off her head
[2:43:35] has gone wrong
[2:43:37] and if
[2:43:38] the dickies come to your house and
[2:43:40] finally find out where it came true and
[2:43:42] say you are right your wife is wrong
[2:43:44] that does not fix what went wrong right
[2:43:47] but if they can find out what went wrong
[2:43:50] i said bro sister the devil just came
[2:43:53] into this home
[2:43:55] it doesn't matter what he did to you or
[2:43:56] what he did to your husband let's cast
[2:43:58] him out
[2:44:00] because he can't rule he can't rule me
[2:44:02] on you if i keep my pride and you keep
[2:44:05] your pride we have a new king
[2:44:08] king devil
[2:44:11] see our pride we install a new king and
[2:44:14] we don't want that
[2:44:17] so i'm speaking this morning now there
[2:44:18] are many homes this morning
[2:44:20] they just had a new they just had
[2:44:21] election election was over in their home
[2:44:24] they just reinstalled the devil
[2:44:30] and are you sleeping you're facing this
[2:44:31] way your wife is facing that way because
[2:44:33] you got a new scenario in the house
[2:44:36] it's dictating the policies that rule
[2:44:38] your family this is serious talk church
[2:44:40] this is what about unclean spirits
[2:44:43] and god is telling you see like i told
[2:44:45] you when you reason with your children
[2:44:47] it may look so simple but you make them
[2:44:49] to depart from those things you're
[2:44:50] telling them but when you bully them
[2:44:52] they don't know why you are saying they
[2:44:53] shouldn't do it keep telling your
[2:44:55] daughter i don't want to go with that
[2:44:56] boy she will still keep going with that
[2:44:58] boy but if you can sit her down and tell
[2:45:01] her you know married
[2:45:03] look at that boy with all those crazy
[2:45:04] hair look
[2:45:05] it's going to defy you and you you
[2:45:07] actually don't argue with how you you
[2:45:08] reason with her
[2:45:10] and then
[2:45:11] you're communicating with her and she
[2:45:14] see why she shouldn't do it and most of
[2:45:16] the time we communicate the wrong way we
[2:45:18] just bullied our children and we become
[2:45:20] bullied when you're coming everybody's
[2:45:22] like crosses they're hiding
[2:45:24] you create hypocrisy in your own home
[2:45:26] you create actors
[2:45:28] but when you reach it with them let them
[2:45:30] do what they want to do because they're
[2:45:31] going to do it anyway
[2:45:32] nobody give birth to a christian how
[2:45:34] many of us give back to your believer
[2:45:35] raise up your head okay that's what i
[2:45:36] thought you all give birth to a sinner
[2:45:38] that's what you give back to
[2:45:40] how many of us are trying to change that
[2:45:41] oh pastor daughter is like this are you
[2:45:43] silly the person will be like that until
[2:45:45] she meet the god that the pastor met
[2:45:49] oh the dickens daughter does not serve
[2:45:51] god
[2:45:52] and so what about it
[2:45:54] did why did
[2:46:00] he met god that's why he's that's why
[2:46:01] he's doing what he's doing and if his
[2:46:03] daughter is going to behave now she has
[2:46:04] to meet the same god our father mate
[2:46:07] see how your clean spirit walk they walk
[2:46:09] on both ends
[2:46:11] now because the point figure out what
[2:46:12] this dick in the white eyes like this
[2:46:13] the wife is like that even in the past
[2:46:15] pastor why do this person do the devil
[2:46:17] want to wreck the house of god

[2:46:21] comes to trust will we come to church
[2:46:24] we'll serve god we will put we'll put
[2:46:26] our hands on the wheel
[2:46:30] god sent us come let us listen together
[2:46:33] and joshua killed the reason with god
[2:46:35] and was the story that the light is
[2:46:38] flowing with making honey and when they
[2:46:40] went there they were not looking for
[2:46:41] nothing but milk and honey that's what
[2:46:44] they were looking for
[2:46:45] through a child in the land they were
[2:46:46] not seeing the giant they were looking
[2:46:48] at the promise right right but all these
[2:46:50] sort little telescopes they were looking
[2:46:52] at something else
[2:46:54] they were seen as in the misery they
[2:46:56] were sent to to spy the city to see with
[2:46:59] their eyes those ten men were like
[2:47:02] ministers and and fathers and mothers
[2:47:05] they were transpiring to the things of
[2:47:07] god and bring a good report to their
[2:47:08] children to their church to their wife
[2:47:11] to their family and these guys went into
[2:47:13] the land only joshua and caleb
[2:47:16] let me put out a sister this morning
[2:47:18] only joshua and caleb and sisters could
[2:47:21] come back and say i can live as a sister
[2:47:23] with my husband i can be humble and
[2:47:25] sweet
[2:47:27] and i said no no you can't control me
[2:47:28] this america can't go through you can't
[2:47:30] no no no no no
[2:47:32] bringing bad reports
[2:47:34] they're looking at the chat in the light
[2:47:36] he did this
[2:47:37] he's not going to control me he's not
[2:47:38] going to control me
[2:47:39] let's put on the brothers this morning
[2:47:42] they went to the land they spied a lot
[2:47:46] and this
[2:47:47] to to spy joshua and kill him kim said
[2:47:50] we are able to live holy
[2:47:53] we are able to be humble
[2:47:55] we can apologize to our wife
[2:47:57] we can apologize to the church we can
[2:48:00] apologize to the dickens you will make
[2:48:02] mistake
[2:48:03] but we we can't apologize
[2:48:06] but abraham said the zeal of this hour
[2:48:09] is what
[2:48:10] it's repentance you see he said the
[2:48:12] devil twisted he's gonna give us
[2:48:13] something oh let's pray let's let's do
[2:48:16] brother's prayer meeting and we are
[2:48:17] saying you know god we are praying oh
[2:48:19] dude we are spiritual no no no but it is
[2:48:22] repentance right in all those prayer
[2:48:24] meetings these people are doing you see
[2:48:25] arrogance begin to creep in right
[2:48:28] and people make mistake they can never
[2:48:29] apologize to his sister they can never
[2:48:32] apologize to their brother but they can
[2:48:34] pray heaven hell you are praying
[2:48:35] hollywood heaven you can't pray the
[2:48:36] rehab down with that character
[2:48:39] what your prayer is atmosphere you are
[2:48:41] just feeling sensation you're not really
[2:48:42] bringing god down
[2:48:44] you're not bringing god you just oh lord
[2:48:46] maybe brian i play the piano very well
[2:48:49] and you feel some sense you think holy
[2:48:50] ghost is there you are just actually in
[2:48:52] an emotion
[2:48:55] but this man went there bro steve they
[2:48:57] said we can live their life
[2:49:00] because abraham lived it amen
[2:49:03] he apologized to his wife
[2:49:06] he apologized to his children he
[2:49:08] apologized to his lawyer he
[2:49:10] he he was not so proud that he couldn't
[2:49:13] do it
[2:49:14] i was watching brad shadlam the other
[2:49:16] day and he was apologizing to his church
[2:49:18] yes
[2:49:19] it doesn't make you little it makes you
[2:49:21] a christian
[2:49:23] that's the that's the treasure of the
[2:49:25] christianity when you can prophecy the
[2:49:27] zeal of the hour is what the zeal of
[2:49:29] what repentance
[2:49:32] to be able to say i am sorry and only a
[2:49:35] believer we have that
[2:49:38] right
[2:49:39] and you can be a believer the devil is
[2:49:40] telling you something else
[2:49:43] but look at that word carefully you see
[2:49:45] people in the scripture who also the
[2:49:47] devil taught the same story he's telling
[2:49:49] you you just have to hold to god's word
[2:49:52] like abraham he believed god
[2:49:54] and god said you are righteous
[2:49:57] before then joshua would tell us that
[2:49:58] abraham worship idols that's what joshua
[2:50:01] told the book of joshua
[2:50:03] so probably many of us in here we're
[2:50:04] watching some idols of pride my way or
[2:50:08] no way and fashion and all of that
[2:50:10] before you come out of your house you
[2:50:12] can spend two hours on the mirror until
[2:50:14] you come late to the church say sunday
[2:50:16] school doesn't really even matter i mean
[2:50:17] this helps what might they got to look
[2:50:19] beautiful
[2:50:22] this is a sister it's not a sister thing
[2:50:24] it's lack of commitment
[2:50:26] because if god means so much to you you
[2:50:28] should look beautiful that because
[2:50:30] that's the nature of you might want to
[2:50:31] look beautiful but it should not be at
[2:50:32] the expense of your spiritual life
[2:50:35] if safara has not spent time looking at
[2:50:38] that mirror she would have seen that her
[2:50:39] husband died in the church she may have
[2:50:40] told the truth
[2:50:44] because
[2:50:45] how how did the husband come to church
[2:50:47] and she was not there when the husband
[2:50:48] died how did this happen
[2:50:52] they loved each other when they saw the
[2:50:54] lord they were together is that right
[2:50:55] that's what she said they conspired to
[2:50:57] give the first report but when it was
[2:50:59] such service you see how the devil walks
[2:51:01] when it's conspiracy to lie they were
[2:51:03] together but coming to church husband
[2:51:05] was ahead she was behind
[2:51:08] that would have spared her life
[2:51:10] it sounds funny this morning i'm not
[2:51:12] trying to make you joke
[2:51:13] this is serious business somebody just
[2:51:15] died sapphira was somebody's mother if
[2:51:17] you don't know she was somebody's sister
[2:51:20] yeah and then and i also was somebody's
[2:51:22] brother
[2:51:23] see when we read the scripture
[2:51:26] i was telling my mom my wife one day i
[2:51:27] said when we read the scripture let's
[2:51:29] slow down and really let it seriously
[2:51:31] with our life when you read an israelite
[2:51:33] slave two to twenty three thousand
[2:51:35] people those people were people's family
[2:51:38] see
[2:51:39] it's not hollywood movie
[2:51:41] it's not sparta this is spatter it's not
[2:51:43] a war movie this is reality somebody
[2:51:45] just lost their life because they were
[2:51:47] not serving god
[2:51:49] and when you look at what those people
[2:51:51] did that 25 000 people died you are
[2:51:53] doing it most every time of the week
[2:51:57] you're doing them
[2:51:59] the fact that you are doing them doesn't
[2:52:01] make them right
[2:52:03] you cannot nobody in here can
[2:52:05] christianize sin you cannot
[2:52:08] see the sin in joshua's life he's seen
[2:52:10] him receiving his life he's saying
[2:52:13] not sin in your life and then it's
[2:52:15] holding it's not
[2:52:17] and that's how god is calling us in a
[2:52:20] solemn hour come let us reason together
[2:52:25] and when you take that invitation and
[2:52:27] you come to god you will realize that
[2:52:29] this message is not an intellectual
[2:52:31] message
[2:52:32] it's not a school it's just something
[2:52:35] that god has sent to show you who you
[2:52:39] are in this world that's it god not
[2:52:42] assembled abram so that you can open the
[2:52:44] brahmas no he sent him to show you who
[2:52:46] you are
[2:52:47] that's it amen
[2:52:50] no other person could show us who we are
[2:52:52] some are telling us on how to get a car
[2:52:54] and how to be reached and that will be
[2:52:56] that but here comes a message showing
[2:52:58] you who you are in the word of god
[2:53:02] the musicians can come up i told you i'm
[2:53:04] just going to lay foundation to this
[2:53:06] we're talking about unclean spirits
[2:53:09] and god is calling you to receive with
[2:53:11] him because this is deep
[2:53:13] not deep means this is deep this is what
[2:53:15] we relate with every day of our life
[2:53:18] unclean spirit
[2:53:20] it's why you look at the message and you
[2:53:23] listen to a tape you can't even follow
[2:53:24] the tape
[2:53:26] you're looking to the table they say
[2:53:27] something and then you you live there
[2:53:29] and you go there and you can't even you
[2:53:30] don't know the end of that tip anymore
[2:53:33] this is why people have been in the
[2:53:34] message for 40 years received 30 years
[2:53:37] they have not been able to listen to
[2:53:39] the seven seal
[2:53:42] the only knowledge they have of the
[2:53:43] servants is what they attract to them
[2:53:46] and now we are living in an age where we
[2:53:48] have cds see this is even obsolete now
[2:53:50] we have chips
[2:53:52] chips is almost obsolete you have it in
[2:53:54] your phone
[2:53:55] you can listen to any message you want
[2:53:57] to listen to
[2:53:58] you can open the bible on your phone if
[2:54:00] you have a smartphone you don't have to
[2:54:01] be smart the phone just have to be smart
[2:54:04] [Music]
[2:54:07] and god has used the devil's own tool to
[2:54:10] bless us
[2:54:14] at one time to open the bible and read
[2:54:17] it you'll be bumped on a stick in
[2:54:19] england
[2:54:21] the person that translated the bible the
[2:54:24] new testament to english will enter in
[2:54:26] there they break his neck and bond him
[2:54:28] on the stake for doing what for
[2:54:30] translating the bible to english for
[2:54:33] people to read

[2:54:56] he can have impact in your life
[2:54:59] because till they are seeing something
[2:55:01] in this scripture
[2:55:03] he has seen something in this world
[2:55:05] something has opened up to him and said
[2:55:08] if i can get these people to see it
[2:55:11] he was not trying to show that who the
[2:55:13] king was
[2:55:16] the king was living a dirty life
[2:55:19] he didn't have a male son and then he
[2:55:21] married his brother's wife this they
[2:55:23] could not have a man's soul
[2:55:26] so thin there was not trying to show
[2:55:28] them who t there is he read the bible
[2:55:31] and he blessed his life
[2:55:34] and he took an oath i will make sure

[2:55:40] streets and look at us
[2:55:44] where last did you open your bible
[2:55:47] so of course as we call it the church
[2:55:49] this morning that's why we remember to
[2:55:50] dust it
[2:55:52] that's how we brought it out of where we
[2:55:54] kept it
[2:55:55] but somebody gave his life just for you
[2:55:58] to read it in english
[2:56:03] somebody had to live a regardless life
[2:56:06] the angel of god talked about abraham he
[2:56:08] said you have chosen the harder way
[2:56:11] it is of your own choosing
[2:56:14] somebody choose the other way so you can
[2:56:16] see yourself in what thing they
[2:56:18] translated
[2:56:24] here we are
[2:56:26] we begin to chase things
[2:56:28] that the devil has put in place to make
[2:56:30] us not to know who we are
[2:56:34] how many of us think that is the effort
[2:56:37] that we put into our job that put base

[2:59:18] wilderness
[2:59:19] if something in your heart is doubting
[2:59:21] your prayer
[2:59:22] then that's your prayer request

[2:59:37] with divine healing what do i need to
[2:59:39] pray for god help my unbelief
[2:59:44] you are not believing you are saying no
[2:59:45] you are you are following the procedure
[2:59:48] in mark 9 jesus 2 before that man
[2:59:51] he just sent his disciples
[2:59:53] and the bible said 2 until they went and
[2:59:55] they came back said we cast our devil we
[2:59:57] hate the sick we did this
[3:00:00] and then one man brought his son when
[3:00:02] whenever i heard about the revival he
[3:00:04] brought his son you see
[3:00:06] this this boy the devil is trying to
[3:00:08] kill him
[3:00:09] and all the disciples were praying oh
[3:00:10] lord oh lord the lord
[3:00:12] the man told the lord jesus he said your
[3:00:15] disciples could not cast out the devil
[3:00:19] and you know what he told jesus this man
[3:00:22] guarded mach 9 they just came from a
[3:00:24] revival
[3:00:26] in chapter 8 they cast a devil and they
[3:00:28] did all those great things in chapter 9.
[3:00:32] they brought their sick before them they
[3:00:33] could not cast out the devil
[3:00:35] now they were confused
[3:00:37] they said lord why why couldn't we
[3:00:40] why couldn't we cast it out
[3:00:43] then he gave them another level he said
[3:00:45] ye
[3:00:46] he said oh ye of little faith
[3:00:50] he said sauce does not come out without
[3:00:53] prayer and fasting
[3:00:55] now listen to this
[3:00:56] we come to about abraham now
[3:00:58] he says trust god not come out with that
[3:01:01] word without prayer and what fasting now
[3:01:04] you know what abraham
[3:01:05] prayer and fasting but i'm calling
[3:01:06] puggatory
[3:01:08] now why did whatever call it purgatory
[3:01:11] in the beginning about the bran's
[3:01:12] ministry the angel of god talked about
[3:01:14] abraham if only you will be sincere
[3:01:17] nothing can stand for your prayer not
[3:01:19] even cancer
[3:01:22] but later on the entire temple abraham
[3:01:24] in a vision
[3:01:25] when he was pounding that mount that
[3:01:27] snake
[3:01:28] the ancient top of the bread
[3:01:30] he said you must be more sincere
[3:01:35] follow me
[3:01:37] 1947 when he met angela they said you
[3:01:41] if you are sincere if you are
[3:01:44] nothing can stand for your prayer
[3:01:47] but this time
[3:01:48] but abraham said god told me
[3:01:51] i am not sincere enough
[3:01:54] yeah that sister
[3:01:56] god talk about abraham you are not
[3:01:57] sincere enough
[3:02:00] god says enough
[3:02:06] you know what the brother said
[3:02:07] he said i am going to forget me
[3:02:10] i am going to fast and pray
[3:02:13] because god said i am not sincere enough
[3:02:19] the disciple could not cast it out
[3:02:22] because yes about cleanness in there
[3:02:24] who will be the greatest who will be
[3:02:25] this who's going to be the next leader
[3:02:27] who will be jesus said don't worry about
[3:02:29] that nonsense
[3:02:32] this is all about with goodness god is
[3:02:34] the greatest hallelujah
[3:02:40] now we can we can relax and
[3:02:43] we can begin not
[3:02:45] successful where they belong and begin
[3:02:47] to allow god to take control when we
[3:02:50] cannot pray
[3:02:52] god didn't tell you to send your
[3:02:53] children
[3:02:54] didn't tell you to save your husband
