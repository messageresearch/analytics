[Music] one world government that we are now setting up as we think of that city being the location of a great church council we see foreshadowed the ecumenical move taking place today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called christians come together indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the tares are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the garner it was a city of earthquakes such earthquakes has finally destroyed it this age will end in god shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old harlot not only will world systems crumble but the very earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of christ the city was rich endowed by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead culture and education have taken the place of the spirit given word and faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism in every attribute ancient laodicea is found reborn in the 20th century laodicean age in the mercy of god may those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they be not partakers of her sins and the consequent judgment the laodicean age the laodicean age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps 1906 how long will it last as a servant of god who has had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977. if you will pardon a personal note here i based this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one sunday morning in june 1933 the lord jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the lord was drawing nigh but that before he came seven major events would transpire i wrote them all down and that morning i gave forth the revelation of the lord the first vision was that mussolini would invade ethiopia and that nation would fall at his steps that vision surely did cause some repercussions and some were very angry when i said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his modern arms and took over the natives didn't have a chance but the vision also said that mussolini would come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as it was said the next vision foretold that an austrian by the name of adolf hitler would rise up as dictator over germany and that he would draw the world into war it showed the siegfried line and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then it showed that hitler would come to a mysterious end the third vision was in the realm of world politics for it showed me that there would be three great isms fascism nazism communism but that the first two would be swallowed up into the third the voice admonished watch russia watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north the fourth vision showed the great advances in science that would come after the second world war it was headed up in the vision of a plastic bubble-topped car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so that people appeared seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves the fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women god showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world then in the sixth vision there arose up in america a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by women the last and seventh vision was wherein i heard a most terrible explosion as i turned to look i saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of america based on these seven visions along with the rapid changes which have swept the world in the last fifty years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to pass by nineteen seventy seven and though many may feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man knoweth the day nor the hour i still maintain this prediction after thirty years because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium now let me say this can anyone prove any of those visions wrong were they not all fulfilled yes each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now mussolini invaded ethiopia successfully then fell and lost it all hitler started a war he could not finish and died mysteriously communism took over both the other two isms the plastic bubble car has been built and is awaiting only a better network of roads women are all but naked and are even now wearing topless bathing suits and just the other day i saw in a magazine the very dress that i saw in my vision if you can call it a dress it was a plastic transparent type of cloth with three darkened spots that covered both breasts in a small area and then there was a dark place like a small apron below the catholic church is on the rise we have had one catholic president and will no doubt have another what is left nothing except hebrews 12 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven once more god will shake the earth and with it shake everything loose that can be shaken then he will renovate it just last march 1964 that good friday earthquake of alaska shook the whole world though it did not unbalance it but god was warning by a world tremor what he will soon do on a greater scale he is going to blast and rock this sin cursed world my brother my sister and there is only one place that can stand that shock and that is in the fold of the lord jesus and i would beseech you while god's mercy is still available to you that you give your whole life unreservedly to jesus christ who as the faithful shepherd will save you and care for you and present you faultless in glory with exceeding great joy the messenger i doubt very much if any age truly knew the messenger that god had sent unto it except in the first stage where paul was the messenger and even in that age many did not recognize him for what he was now the age in which we are living is going to be a very short one events are going to transpire very rapidly so the messenger to this laodicean age has to be here now though perhaps we don't know him as yet but there will surely have to be a time that he becomes known now i can prove that because we have scripture that describes his ministry first of all that messenger is going to be a prophet he will have the office of a prophet he will have the prophetic ministry it will be based solidly on the word because when he prophesies or has a vision it will always be word oriented and it will always come to pass he will be vindicated as a prophet because of his accuracy the proof that he is a prophet is found in revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets now this person who in this verse is called an angel in the king james version is not an heavenly being the sixth trumpeting angel who is in heavenly being is in revelation 9 13 and the seventh of like order is in revelation 11 15. this one here in revelation 10 7 is the seventh age messenger and it is a man and he is to bring a message from god and his message and ministry is going to finish the mystery of god as declared to his servants the prophets god is going to treat this last messenger as a prophet because he is a prophet that is what paul was in the first stage and the last age has one too amos 3 6-7 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the lord hath not done it surely the lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of jesus came forth revelation 10 3-4 and cried with a loud voices when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not what was in those thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take a profit to get the revelation because god has no other way of bringing out his scriptural revelations except by a prophet the word always came by a prophet and always will that this is the law of god is evident by even a casual search of scripture the unchanging god with unchanging ways invariably sent his prophet in every age where the people had strayed from divine order with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word god always sent his servant to these people but apart from the theologians in order to correct false teaching and lead the people back to god so we see a seventh age messenger coming and he is a prophet not only do we see this messenger coming here in revelation 10 7 but we find that the word speaks of elijah coming before jesus returns in matthew 17 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus said elias truly shall first come and restore all things before the coming of our lord elijah must come back for a work of restoration in the church this is what malachi 4 5 says behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse there is absolutely no doubt that elijah must return before the coming of jesus he has a specific work to accomplish that work is the part of malachi 4 6 that says he will turn the hearts of the children to their fathers the reason that we know this is his specific work to do at that time is because he has already accomplished the part that says he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children when the elijah ministry was here in john the baptist luke 1 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord in the ministry of john the hearts of the fathers were turned to the children we know that because jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the fathers that is yet to take place the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the pentecostal fathers john got the fathers ready for jesus to welcome the children into the fold now this prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah falls will prepare the children to welcome back jesus jesus called john the baptist elijah matthew 17 12 but i say unto you that elijah has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him what they listed the reason that he called john elijah was because the same spirit that was upon elijah had come back upon john even as that spirit had come back upon elisha after the reign of king ahab now once again that spirit will come back upon another man just before jesus comes he will be a prophet he will be vindicated as such by god since jesus himself in the flesh won't be here to vindicate him as he did john it will be done by the holy spirit so that this prophet's ministry will be attended by great and wonderful manifestation as a prophet every revelation will be vindicated for every revelation will come to pass wonderful acts of power will be performed at his commands in faith then will be brought forth the message that god has given him in the word to turn the people back to truth and the true power of god some will listen but the majority will run true to form and reject him since this prophet messenger of revelation 10 7 will be the same as malachi 4 5-6 he will be naturally like elijah and john both were men set apart from the accepted religious schools of their day both were men of the wilderness both acted only when they had thus saith the lord straight from god by revelation both lashed out against the religious orders and leaders of their day but not only was that so they lashed out against all who were corrupt or would corrupt others and notice both prophesied much against immoral women and their ways elijah cried out against jezebel and john rebuked herodius philip's wife though he will not be popular he will be vindicated by god as jesus authenticated john and the holy ghost authenticated jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else and jesus himself in returning will authenticate him even as he authenticated john john witnessed that jesus was coming and so will this man like john witness that jesus is coming and the very return of christ will prove that this man indeed was the forerunner of his second coming this is the final evidence that this indeed is the prophet of malachi 4 for the end of the gentile period will be jesus himself appearing then it will be too late for those who have rejected him in order to further clarify our presentation of this last day profit let us particularly note that the prophet of matthew 11 12 was john the baptist who was the one foretold in malachi 3 1. behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom he delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts matthew 11 1-12 and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which ye do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the death hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed jesus began to say under the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in king's houses but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he this has already taken place this has happened it is over but note now in malachi 4 1-6 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with statutes and judgments behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse see immediately after the coming of this elijah the earth will be cleansed by fire and the wicked burn to ashes of course this did not happen at the time of john the elijah for his day the spirit of god that prophesied the coming of the messenger in malachi 3 1 john was but reiterating his previous prophetic statement of isaiah 43 made at least three centuries previously the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god now john by the holy ghost voiced both isaiah and malachi in matthew 3 3. for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight so we can well see from these scriptures that the prophet in malachi 3 who was john was not the prophet of malachi 4 though indeed both john and this last day prophet have upon them the same spirit which was upon elijah now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so but consider this also this prophet messenger will be in his nature and manners as were elijah and john the people of this prophet messenger's day will be as they were in ahab's day and in john's and since it is only the children whose hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen in the days of ahab only 7 000 true seed israelites were found in the days of john there were also very few the masses in both ages were in the fornication of idolatry i want to make one more comparison between the laodicean prophet messenger and john the prophet messenger who preceded jesus first coming the people in john's day mistook him for the messiah john 1 19-20 and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ now this last day prophet messenger will have such power before the lord that there will be those who mistake him for the lord jesus there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this matthew 24 23-26 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not but don't you believe it he is not jesus christ he is not the son of god he is one of the brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of god he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which john received when he was the voice that cried i am not he but he is coming after me before we close this section on the messenger of the laodicean age we must seriously consider these two thoughts first this age will have one prophet messenger revelation 10 7 says when he singular shall begin to sound there has never been an age where god gave his people two major prophets at one time he gave enoch alone he gave noah alone he gave moses he alone had the word though others prophesied john the baptist came alone now in this last day there is to be a prophet not a prophetess though in this age there are more women purporting to give god's revelation than men and the infallible word says that he the prophet will reveal the mysteries to the end time people and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers there are those who say that god's people are going to come together through a collective revelation i challenge that statement it is a bald invalid assumption in the face of revelation 10 7. now i do not deny that people will prophesy in this last age and their ministries can and will be correct i do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of paul when there was one agabus a prophet who prophesied of a famine i agree that is so but i deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus saith the lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be vindicated there is one profit messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major doctrine which they all hold together who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last stage is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of paul i will tell you who will have it it will be a profit as thoroughly vindicated or even more thoroughly vindicated than was any profit in all the ages from enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry and god will shew him forth he won't need to speak for himself god will speak for him by the voice of the sign amen the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is that the seven church ages started out with the antichrist spirit as well as the holy spirit who is to be blessed forever first john 4 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world did you notice it the antichrist spirit is identified with false prophets the ages came in with false prophets and they will go out with false prophets now of course there is going to be a real false prophet in the grand sense of that man mentioned in the revelation but as of now before his revelation there are to appear many false prophets matthew 24 23-26 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not these false prophets are earmarked for us in various other scriptures such as the following second peter 2 1-2 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of second timothy 4 3-4 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables first timothy 4 1 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now in every case you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the word just as we showed you that antichrist means anti-word so these false prophets come perverting the word giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish ends have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to jesus christ and he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says but to fear what the word says notice how these people like judas are out for money they get you to sell all you have and give it to them and their schemes they spend more time on offerings than the word those who attempt to operate gifts will make use of a gift which has a margin of error in it and then ask for money and neglect the word and call it of god and people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death yes the land is full of carnal impersonators in that last day they will try to imitate that prophet messenger the seven sons of siva tried to imitate paul simon the sorcerer tried to imitate peter their impersonations will be carnal they won't be able to produce what the true prophet produces when he says the revival is over they will go around claiming a great revelation that what the people have is exactly right and god is going to do bigger and more wonderful things amongst the people and the people will fall for it these same false prophets will claim that the messenger of the last day is not a theologian so he ought not to be heard they won't be able to produce what the messenger can they won't be vindicated by god as that last day prophet is but with their great swelling words and with the weight of their worldwide notoriety they will warn the people not to hear that man messenger and they will say he teaches wrong they are running exactly true to their fathers the pharisees who were of the devil for they claimed that both john and jesus taught error now why do these false prophets come against the true prophet and discredit his teaching because they are running true to form as did their forefathers when in the days of ahab they withstood micaiah there were 400 of them and all of them were in agreement and by them all saying the same thing they fooled the people but one prophet just one was right and all the rest wrong because god had committed the revelation to only one [Music] you
