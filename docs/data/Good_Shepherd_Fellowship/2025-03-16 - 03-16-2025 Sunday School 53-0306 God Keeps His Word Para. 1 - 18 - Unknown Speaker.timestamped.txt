[2:27] happy to be here tonight in the service
[2:30] of the king we used to sing an old song
[2:33] years ago I am happy in the service of
[2:37] the king you remember that song wasn't
[2:39] that just a Dandy happy in the service
[2:43] of the
[2:44] king uh anybody serving in the service
[2:47] of this King that we're talking about
[2:49] got to be happy having it amen now
[2:52] tonight it's a pleasure to be in the
[2:55] little Tabernacle here the people's
[2:57] Tabernacle I like that name that title
[2:59] it's to the people all
[3:01] people everybody's welcome I think them
[3:04] titles like people's Tabernacle Church
[3:07] with the Open Door House of
[3:10] Prayer I kind of like that kind of
[3:12] something about it instead of saying
[3:14] it's the petarian or the Baptist or the
[3:17] Catholic or some church like that well I
[3:20] don't mean them churches not all right
[3:22] understand their titles are all right
[3:24] but I'm just talking about my own
[3:26] feeling I think it's uh he has it's the
[3:29] people
[3:30] Tabernacle the church with the open door
[3:32] or the House of Prayer the Bible said it
[3:36] is written my father's house will be
[3:38] called a house of
[3:40] prayer and um so they take that of
[3:43] course that don't make it any any better
[3:45] any words it's just the names they give
[3:47] it
[3:49] and someone has telling me
[3:52] said what do you think about different
[3:55] denominations do you think if these
[3:57] people has and this people has so forth
[4:01] I tell you it was a a dean of the
[4:03] Lutheran
[4:04] College he' wrote me a letter and you
[4:08] talk about giving me a good R and over
[4:10] he gave me one I was at Minneapolis and
[4:13] he said I drove 15 miles last night in a
[4:16] blinding snowstorm thinking I was going
[4:18] to hear a servant of the Lord and what
[4:20] did I find but a polished up souser and
[4:24] he said and your theology is oh my uh 22
[4:30] pages in the letter and he really gave
[4:33] me a good one and he said the very idea
[4:36] of a man that stands before the people
[4:38] of Jud do and make statements like you
[4:41] made last night I kept on reading I
[4:43] thought wonder what I say I thought I
[4:45] was go call some of get the tape and
[4:47] check up so he said here's what he's
[4:50] getting at me for he said and I said the
[4:53] Devil Couldn't heal and he said I want
[4:56] you to understand that all your brag of
[4:58] 25 years in Ministry he said son I was
[5:01] preaching the gospel before you was
[5:03] born well I I thought well now all right
[5:08] I okay and he said and let me tell you
[5:12] why that I know that the devil can
[5:15] heal he said I live in a city where
[5:18] there's a woman that has a familiar
[5:20] Spirit you know one of the devil spirits
[5:22] and said people come to her for healing
[5:25] and what did she do but pull some hair
[5:27] out of their head pluck some of no she
[5:29] hair out her head believe and plucks the
[5:31] veins and bleeds it on the hair from her
[5:33] arm from their arm goes down to the
[5:36] river behind her house and pitches it
[5:37] over her shoulder and she walks up and
[5:40] if she is constrained till she has to
[5:43] turn around and look at it then the
[5:45] disease remains on the person and comes
[5:47] back if she doesn't said she tells the
[5:49] people they're going to get well and
[5:51] said we kept count of it and said about
[5:53] 20% of those are healing he said man you
[5:56] mean to tell me if you'd stand up there
[5:58] and have the adoped to say that the
[6:00] devil can't
[6:02] heal Oh I thought well now that's all
[6:05] right see everybody's got a right to
[6:06] their own opinion and I said I just had
[6:09] to answer this little letter little
[6:12] one I got
[6:15] me the one that I was answering was
[6:17] going to be the little
[6:19] one I couldn't think of all that so I
[6:23] sat down and I addressed him he first
[6:26] told me he thought I was a devil a su
[6:29] which would be a devil of course so he
[6:31] said uh you uh I I said dear beloved
[6:37] Brothers I was glad to get your letter
[6:41] I'm always glad for friendly criticism
[6:44] it helps me helps you if you just take
[6:46] it that way Mis let somebody criticize
[6:48] you might have some spots that ought be
[6:50] cleared up I said I'm very happy to get
[6:54] your letter and you must think something
[6:58] of me or you wouldn't wrote to
[7:00] man I said and then another thing that I
[7:03] admire you for is your 50 years of
[7:06] service for my Lord see and I said I I
[7:11] am certainly respect that with high
[7:14] respect I said then another thing I said
[7:17] you must love him or seeing that the
[7:19] crowds that I stood before and my
[7:22] theology I said you must have thought
[7:24] something of the Lord and love him
[7:27] because you wouldn't have tried to
[7:28] correct me see because you love him you
[7:30] don't want his Works going on wrong so I
[7:32] said you must love me and uh I said now
[7:35] the first thing I'm going to say to you
[7:38] I forgive you for calling me a susv I
[7:41] said because and a devil because you
[7:44] remember Jesus when he was doing that
[7:47] very same thing saying that I can do
[7:49] nothing except uh do what the father
[7:52] tells me and was seeing the visions and
[7:54] telling the people what who they were
[7:56] and what they were and what happened and
[7:58] so forth
[7:59] the Pharisees said that was the works of
[8:02] the devil it was a suser a be elub and
[8:06] you know what Jesus said to them he said
[8:09] that you speak that against me the son
[8:11] of man I'll forgive you but when the
[8:12] Holy Ghost has come you speak against
[8:15] him it'll never be forgiven him I said
[8:18] what if I was right just say what if I
[8:21] was and what have you done there would
[8:25] never be forgiveness in this world the
[8:26] world to come according to the
[8:28] scriptures which cannot lie
[8:30] see now that's the blase of the Holy
[8:32] Ghost is called The Works of God an unan
[8:34] by an unclean spirit and so now I said
[8:38] just to straighten you out
[8:40] better I said I just like to ask you
[8:43] something I'm surprised at a Lutheran
[8:46] Dean would base his theology up on some
[8:50] sort of an
[8:51] experience why I said in the Baptist
[8:55] Church in the and the first year of
[8:57] school we learned the basic everything
[9:00] upon the
[9:02] Bible I all our theology must come off
[9:05] the Bible and here you're trying to base
[9:07] your theology on an
[9:11] experience or I said to settle it Jesus
[9:15] said that the Satan cannot cast out
[9:19] Satan that's settled it then if Jesus
[9:22] said Satan can't heal I don't care what
[9:24] anyone else would say that settles he
[9:26] can't heal that's all and if you look at
[9:28] it he can because the only thing can
[9:31] heal is when it's being made new cells
[9:35] develop come back like you cut your hand
[9:38] the doctor can't heal it certainly not
[9:40] medicine can't heal it takes God to heal
[9:43] it you break your arm doctor can't heal
[9:46] it he just sets it God heals it see
[9:49] because there's only one Creator and if
[9:51] you say that Satan can create oh my
[9:55] where you got yourself and you got him
[9:57] equal with God see and uh he's a God
[10:00] then if he can create he can make
[10:01] himself see but he can't he can create
[10:05] himself if he if he could but he can't
[10:07] create he can just pervert what God has
[10:09] created and um so then uh he can't heal
[10:13] and uh I said but now to answer your
[10:17] give you to my
[10:18] opinion of your answer to your question
[10:21] that you was condemning me on I said
[10:25] that reminds me a whole lot of of things
[10:29] to what going in the world today
[10:30] Pentecostal
[10:32] Fantastics I said certainly I believe
[10:34] that people were healed I believe
[10:36] everyone that comes approaching will be
[10:38] healed I said but it isn't the witch
[10:41] that's doing the healing no more than it
[10:43] is these fellow say I got healing in my
[10:45] hand feel it feel it feel it no you
[10:46] don't you might feel her hand but you
[10:48] don't feel any healing it's a finished
[10:50] work it's already done see so and uh all
[10:54] these different things that they do I
[10:56] said I don't believe those Fells ever
[10:58] heal anybody and I don't believe the
[11:00] witch ever healed anybody but what
[11:01] brings the healing is the individual's
[11:04] Faith thinking they're approaching God
[11:06] through that witch and God's got to
[11:07] honor faith I don't care where it's at
[11:10] see so it's their faith thinking their
[11:13] approach I've seen heathens kneel at
[11:16] idols and get healing see sure Divine
[11:18] Healing from God through the idol but
[11:20] it's their faith they believe that God
[11:23] is in the idol and they got faith and
[11:26] they believe it and God's got to
[11:28] recognize that Faith because them things
[11:30] are based upon Faith healing is not
[11:33] based upon your works or your good deeds
[11:36] or your experience of Christianity and
[11:39] upon your salvation of your soul healing
[11:42] I've seen people come through the line
[11:44] with renowned Saints go right off the
[11:46] platform six yet I've seen illed people
[11:49] walk through and be healed with blinded
[11:51] eyes and everything it's based upon your
[11:54] your faith not upon your religion not
[11:57] upon your experience
[11:59] it's on faith so last time over
[12:03] there he wrote me a letter back and said
[12:06] Mr brandom I hear you're coming back for
[12:07] the Christian businessman's
[12:09] International Convention to speak said
[12:10] could I have a few words with you I
[12:13] refer him to the manager the manager
[12:14] told him all right so when he got there
[12:16] that morning here he was so I went back
[12:19] out to the college beautiful place way
[12:21] out
[12:22] there and when we went in he had dinner
[12:24] set far or you all call it lunch here
[12:29] down south if I call it lunch I I miss a
[12:32] meal breakfast dinner and stuff me I I
[12:35] just so we this was this was dinner time
[12:38] for us and so we went out there and he
[12:41] had a great oh beautiful place hundreds
[12:43] of Acres where the students could work
[12:44] their way through and so forth pay
[12:46] tuition and he had 70 something students
[12:50] sitting there and after we had her
[12:52] dinner he said I want to ask you a
[12:54] question Mr BR I said yes sir I said
[12:57] here it comes Lutheran Dean
[12:59] [Applause]
[13:00] he said I've been down to the
[13:01] Pentecostal since you kick the francher
[13:03] around and everything like that but I
[13:04] won't ask you there anything to it I
[13:07] said yes sir there is I said it's like a
[13:09] little kid when he gets a to he just
[13:12] Falls and I said like Ezekiel said is a
[13:14] valley full of dry bones he said Can
[13:16] these live he said thou knowest so he
[13:19] said prophesy to the dry bones and when
[13:22] the bones come together there's a
[13:24] rattling and a shaking a lot of
[13:26] noise but then when the skin come on
[13:29] want to meat come on him there wasn't
[13:30] much know he said prophesy to the spirit
[13:33] now see I think that's what's going on
[13:36] see so I said they I see him make a lot
[13:39] of noise I said I think the bones are
[13:41] coming together and so he said um we're
[13:45] hungering and thirsting for God I said
[13:48] that's fine said and we want you to tell
[13:50] us how to receive the baptism of the
[13:52] Holy Ghost he said now said we believe
[13:56] that that if we receive the holy go when
[13:59] we
[14:00] believe
[14:02] I did you read Acts
[14:04] 19 and he said yes I said but it's
[14:08] mighty find Baptist up there had a good
[14:10] pastor good preacher his name is apoll
[14:12] his converted lawyer he's proven Jesus
[14:14] the Christ for the Bible I said Paul
[14:16] pass there in Upper close to eus he
[14:18] finds certain disciples and he said them
[14:20] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[14:22] you
[14:23] believe they said we know have where be
[14:25] any Holy Ghost see so after that was
[14:29] done and there baptized in the name of
[14:30] the Lord Jesus and Paul laid his hands
[14:32] up on them and then they receive the
[14:33] Holy Ghost he said but Abraham believed
[14:35] god brother Bram and it was imputed to
[14:38] him for righteous because he believed
[14:40] what more can a man do but believe I
[14:41] said all a man can do I said you believe
[14:45] and accept Christ as personal savior
[14:47] that's your faith but remember God gave
[14:50] Abraham a seal of circumcision as a
[14:52] confirmation of his faith amen that's
[14:55] right and I said then and that was the
[14:57] Old Testament in the New Testament we we
[14:59] say we believe God gives us the baptism
[15:01] of the Holy Ghost which is a seal of
[15:02] confirmation amen see Ephesians 4:30
[15:05] says grieve not the holy spirit of God
[15:07] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[15:09] your Redemption amen it's a seal that
[15:11] God has recognized your faith but if he
[15:13] hasn't give you the Holy Ghost yet he's
[15:15] never recognized your faith see so he
[15:18] said we want the Holy
[15:23] Ghost yeah Lutheran colle I said what's
[15:26] the Lutheran people going to say said we
[15:28] don't care what the Lu people say we
[15:30] want god
[15:31] huise well I said
[15:34] wonderful uh I said when do you want he
[15:37] said right now I said well scoot back
[15:41] your place and I will pray and I had
[15:43] them all go around to the wall like that
[15:45] laid hands on the 72 Lutheran students
[15:48] reive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[15:50] got signs and wonders and healings going
[15:52] on in the Lutheran College in
[15:54] Minneapolis
[15:55] Minnesota Lord oh he's wonderful it's
[15:59] not just for you Pentecostal people it's
[16:01] for the Lutheran the Baptist the
[16:04] Presbyterian whosoever will it's for all
[16:07] the only thing we just the thing of it
[16:09] is I think what we need is to get oursel
[16:12] in control and just quit scattering and
[16:14] jumping and respect the gifts of God and
[16:16] things and put them in their places like
[16:18] that and let the Holy Spirit operate the
[16:20] church and then them other people go to
[16:22] hunger and thirsting part but as long as
[16:24] you let it just run loose and this one
[16:26] this way and that one that way and no
[16:27] control they just think it's a bab and
[16:29] they taught better than that in the
[16:30] Bible it's not the gift that they've got
[16:33] against it's the way you Loosely use it
[16:35] that's part what it's against Jesus said
[16:38] you're the salt of the earth but the
[16:40] salt can only be a savior as it contacts
[16:44] so you got to make a contact and your
[16:47] life is the best thing to make a contact
[16:49] with anybody I rather you live me sermon
[16:51] than preach me one anytime the rest of
[16:53] the world will the same thing well now
[16:56] for just a few minutes
[16:59] my wife's in the building and she looks
[17:01] straight at me and she knows that I
[17:02] preach too long and Calla people to
[17:04] stand up and I just somehow know I don't
[17:08] know brother Jackson I just don't know
[17:10] when to quit I'm just a glutton on the
[17:12] spirit I guess so I never did like to
[17:15] try to go to work of a morning when I
[17:17] worked hard and somebody set me out a
[17:19] little dish of corn flakes about like
[17:22] that I can just couldn't Thrive I worked
[17:25] hard and I had to have something some
[17:27] biscuits and sarum molasses and chunk of
[17:31] ham meat and i
[17:34] s i i that's way I I like to eat praise
[17:37] the Lord and if I'm go to work if I'm
[17:40] going to live for God all like to have a
[17:42] good Square 4our meal once in a while
[17:44] you know what I mean just come right out
[17:46] and get the Bible and lay right with it
[17:49] but we Southerners down there are kind
[17:51] of used to that but we know that you
[17:54] Yankees up here are more of a cultured
[17:57] type
[18:02] and um so we uh we know this I tell you
[18:07] I'd sure like to live up here though
[18:09] that's right I sure love this country
[18:13] beautiful in the snow reg dry and and
[18:16] you just hear crunching under the wheels
[18:18] when your car going I just think back
[18:20] when I was a little boy when we used to
[18:22] have snows down Southern Indiana like
[18:24] that but the world must be a little out
[18:26] of its orbit now somewhere she isn't
[18:28] working just right we I believe it's so
[18:30] close to coming of the Lord Jesus
[18:32] everything's talk
[18:34] JY one thing it ought to be straight and
[18:37] running straight is the Church of the
[18:38] Living God
[18:39] am so let us bow our heads a moment just
[18:42] before approach the word now when we lay
[18:44] aside of our little things of a little
[18:46] get together little as it was a
[18:48] handshake or something now we're going
[18:50] to approach God now our heavenly father
[18:55] in the name of thy beloved Son we come
[18:57] asking this petition who said when he
[18:59] was your own Earth if you ask the father
[19:02] anything in my name I'll do
[19:05] it now we're so happy for that and he
[19:08] said when thou prayest believe that you
[19:10] receive what you asked for and you shall
[19:13] receive
[19:14] it and I thank thee for this for it's a
[19:19] promise of God and every promise in the
[19:22] book belongs to every believer so I
[19:24] thank thee for it and I pray tonight as
[19:27] I have laid back the these pages of this
[19:29] sacred book called The
[19:32] Bible I'm only able to physically to
[19:36] open it up but only the Holy Spirit can
[19:38] interpret it to us so we pray that he
[19:41] will come tonight and interpret the word
[19:44] and the meaning that would create faith
[19:46] for the Salvation of souls first and for
[19:50] the healing of bodies next and for the
[19:52] bringing of Joy to the Saints and
[19:54] establishing them that they might
[19:56] continue on Grant these blessings father
[19:59] and the Forgiveness of our sins as we
[20:01] ask in Jesus name
[20:07] amen the word is just such a wonderful
[20:10] thing I love
[20:11] it and
[20:13] now to announce what would call for a
[20:16] text for just a little while and U uh
[20:21] and then read some of the scripture here
[20:23] for to get a context I'm going to my
[20:27] text tonight is God
[20:29] keeps his word and I wish to read from
[20:33] St John the 12th chapter and the 35th
[20:36] verse
[20:38] beginning I like to hear you all turning
[20:40] those pages and things I I like to see
[20:43] people bring their Bibles to church and
[20:46] um it means that just if I read his word
[20:51] now my word will fail because I'm a man
[20:54] but if I we get no more out of the
[20:56] service tonight just reading this word
[20:58] together
[20:59] will be blessed because we'll feed that
[21:02] much on the word of God his words will
[21:05] never fail it can't fail God
[21:09] himself at the 35th verse then Jesus
[21:12] said unto them yet a little while is the
[21:16] light with you walk while you have the
[21:20] light lest Darkness come upon you for he
[21:24] that walketh in darkness knoweth not
[21:27] where he goeth
[21:29] while you have the light Believe In The
[21:34] Light May I stop here just a moment and
[21:38] quote that over again while ye have
[21:43] light believe the
[21:47] light that ye may be the children of
[21:52] light these things spake Jesus and
[21:55] departed and hid himself from them but
[21:59] though he had done so many miracles
[22:02] before them yet they believed not on him
[22:06] now while I go into the context of this
[22:08] in a few moments uh Jesus had done many
[22:12] miracles as he seen the father show him
[22:15] what to do we got that last night did we
[22:17] nothing but what the father told him to
[22:19] do now 38th
[22:21] verse that the saying of the Prophet at
[22:25] the saying of Isaiah the prophet might
[22:28] be fulfilled which the
[22:31] spoke the Lord who has believed our
[22:34] report and to whom has the arm of the
[22:37] Lord been revealed therefore
[22:40] they therefore they could not believe
[22:44] because that Isaiah said
[22:46] again notice that they could not believe
[22:51] because Isaiah said but he heard years
