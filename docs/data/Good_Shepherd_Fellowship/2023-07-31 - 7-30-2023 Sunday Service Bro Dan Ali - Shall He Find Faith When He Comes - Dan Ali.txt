never be the same again going forward Grant it unto us father we pray in the name of Jesus our lord and savior amen while we are still standing shall we just take our Bibles and open to the Book of Luke Luke 18. and we are reading from verse 8. Luke 18 verse 8. and I read I tell you that he will avenge them speedily let me start from verse 7. and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he belong with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth praise be to God shall we be seated nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on Earth praise be to God I had to do some old school I did a lot of writing not a lot and I don't have the best of handwritings if I go to a place and I can't read I will see how that goes praise be to God I am here this morning to encourage us praise be to God there is nothing new I am bringing our way this morning but just to re Echo the things we've been hearing praise be to God and I am here to remind us to keep pressing on praise be to God keep holding on keep holding on never let go if there is anything you ought to be doing in this day and age and in the time we are living in is to keep holding on till when till when Christ takes over you holding on it's what you can do and there is nothing much you can do when you give your life to Christ and you are baptized and you you you are living the life and you are going through that sanctification process it is not an easy thing until the Holy Ghost comes in and takes over it is you struggling or trying to it's a good thing to keep till he takes over until he takes over you have not reached yet praise be to God there is an animal I don't know this is English equivalent but it's it's a small animal in Africa it looks like um like like a squirrel when that animal takes a hold of a hold of a branch you can kill that animal it will still be holding onto the branch it will never let go and when Christ has taken a hold of your life I don't care what you go through in this life you would keep holding on and it is not you but it is Christ and you doing the works by your strength there is nothing you can do he is our strength praise be to God until he has taken over there is nothing much you can do but keep holding on tell Christ has completely taken over then you can say with Paul that it is no longer either but Christ that lives in me that when you get to the Lions then you don't care about the Lions they Wonder put you in the boiling oil you don't care about it now when they bring you before the furry furnace all you see Christ why because he has taken a hold of your life so much so that nothing else matters but Christ and him crucified brother brother said that if he had two drops of blood of the Lord Jesus Christ in a glass or a charger he has been wondering how he is going to take care of it and he talks about how how tears will be running down his face and he'll be so careful with it not to waste it and then he says the best seated before me talking about the bride of Christ is more precious than the two drops of blood his literal blood in a glass or charger because we are the pitchers of his blood we are the purchase of his blood now think about it if the prophet of God says that if he had two drops of his literal blood and he'll be so so careful the way he works not to waste it can you imagine how how careful you and I are to be we are not talking of his literal blood here now we are talking of the life in the blood and when that life is in you when the Life of Christ is in you how careful do you ought to be in your work how careful do you ought to be how careful do you ought to be the Bible says the day that name of the name of the Lord should depart from iniquity be careful the way you walk be careful the things you do be careful what steps you take because you are bearing the name of Christ one word wrong move and you draw his name into reproach the biggest hindrance today is not the unbelievers day the biggest hindrance is those that call Christ I mean name the name of the Lord and who profess Christianity that have become stumbling blocks to the world in which we are living it's a shame it's a shame thank you that the world are looking up to us because they know who we are and we do not care what we do and the places we go but if you know who you are you know how far you have come with Christ you know why you stand as a child of God it doesn't matter what happens if it will cause you to lose your life For the Love of Christ you are going to do it and you'll do it Faithfully praise be to God message God Came Upon him brother says something I'll be going left and right back and forth I have just written small things here and there I don't even know so in that message the prayer of God says that the most miserable person I know of in all America is the man who says I do the best I can I go to church I hope I'm all right the salvation of Jesus Christ is not a hope so it's a no so praise be to God you know when you are Christ the Holy Ghost best record which with your spirit that you are a son or daughter of God all things all things have passed out all things have passed away and all things have become new oh I hope we get it tonight not a borderline Minister nor not a borderline Christian stand in the Liberty where Christ has made you free be not again entangled in the Yoke of bondage or halfway I would you would you you would you would be hot or cold for being lukewarm I speedy from my mouth turned in the Liberty where Christ has made you free be not again entangled in the Yoke of bondage praise be together now we can look at the children of Israel the way God deals with them and we can apply that to our lives now when you look at the children of Israel in captivity in Egypt and you look at you as an individual and as the Bible says that is sin was I shaping iniquity was I in in sin was I conceived and in iniquity was hardshiping come to the world speaking lies every one of us was born straight into captivity every one of us was born straight into bondage you didn't have to do anything to become a sinner you were one right at Birth because we were Sinners by representation because one person saying all of us sinned and also we are righteous by representation by faith in Christ Jesus not because you have done anything right because how good works are as filthy as filthy rights in the sight of the father so we're born into captivity that we came into this life and then we lived all sort of lives we were in bondage the forces of Darkness the evil spirits name them they were just on our case and they were directing whatever we do whichever way we go whatever everything we're doing we were in bondage like the children of Israel were under their Taskmaster Masters so were we you had no choice but to do what the evil spirits wanted you to do but unto every child of God there is a time of visitation when that time has not come there is nothing you can do but when that time has come and you have seen the glory of God and God has delivered you as the prophet of God is saying here stand in the Liberty where Christ has made you free do not again do not again go back into that yoke of bondage there is Liberty in Christ then in that Liberty now we saw how that God delivered the children of Israel with all those signs and wonders following and then they got to the Red Sea God parted the Red Sea they went through it and in the wilderness God was with them and when God Called Moses to give the Ten Commandments what did the children of Israel do they prevailed on Iran to build them a god how forgetful can men ever be how forgetful can we ever be that with all those signs and wonders that they saw God they knew God was with them because no man could do the things that they saw unfolded and yet they could build a calf a golden calf and then they just started worshiping it oh this is the god that delivered us from bondage the god that kept my goodness Lord have mercy we may sit here and say oh we don't worship idols of course there are places in the world I know of that when you go there and they even give you a cup of water you'll not be bold enough to drink it why because in front of every single house they have gone down the river and they have just brought some clay and they have built themselves gods and they have slaughtered animals on it and it looks so so filthy and they save that and you will say oh we are in America oh come on we don't sell Idols why because there is no image before you because you didn't go to the forest to go and cut at the branch of a tree to come and worship it anything that comes between your God has become your Idol it can be your wife it can be your husband it can be your child it can be your work it can be your your promotion it can be anything anything that comes between you and God has become your Idol you have to make sure that when it comes with your work with Christ that there is nothing in between if anything stands in your way if anything stands in your way it's time to get on your knees praise be to God and God was not happy with them and that is how forgetful we can be some of the times that we see the glory of God that will see the hand of God in our midst that we see God changing lives that we see God moving in our midst but then we get to a place and something happens and then we forget of all the good God has done for us and we are ready to throw away all that we have believed for all those years Lord have mercy oh praise the Lord and don't think that Christianity is an easy walk no it is not like the sister just sang the special this morning and uh the song leader asked by the Ariel to interpret it it is not an easy Road it is not an easy walk when God has delivered you you are delivered but you are have been delivered from something that something is cast away is cast out but Christ gave a parable that when an evil spirit is cast out of a man it goes it goes it doesn't stay it goes but after a while when it has gone Roman and roaming and roaming it comes back to where it was before and it comes to spy into sea and if it is clean and there is nothing in there nobody occupying it it goes back and then it brings an enforcement seven more wicked spirits and then they come and inhabit them and the end of that man is worse than before so when you are delivered you are delivered but that evil spirit is going to come back somehow and we saw that when the children of isawa delivered from Egypt the Pharaoh and his men sat down and they said no we need to go get them back here we will not allow them to go kind of follow them and we all know the story how that they all got consumed in the Red Sea praise be to God so when God has delivered you and you are faithful there is a song I was listening to listening to the other day that says that um God loves every broken piece of an honest sacrifice every broken piece of it it doesn't matter how small it is God is interested in it when God has saved your life and you are working with God with all honesty the best you know not with any second motif but you have given yourself to God wholeheartedly and you are living the life whatever comes your way just be sure that God is there to take you out of it when you get to that point the battle is not no longer yours it is no longer your battle it's God's battle by dead a pillar of fire you have the pillar of cloud was leading there and by Night the pillar of fire the angel of the Covenant was with them and they knew God was there and when the enemy came against them it was not they are doing God drowned every one of them together with their chariots when the enemy comes after you just know that the God who delivered you that that God is with you and he has promised us that he will never leave us no forsake us but he would be with us always because he knows that the devil is going to come around somehow and when the Devil comes back God is there praise be to God when you are sleeping God is awake when you are on the job and you are so busy and you don't know what you are doing God is there oh my goodness God is so so loving that sometimes even at our workplaces he shows himself there brother Johnny knows about this but he never heard of this testimony I believe I think some time ago I shared it here we have super sex and that super stock takes up to 2 000 pounds of flour and then there is a hoist that you that that that you wasted on just send it up and then you carry it to that is a place it has to go now I lifted this hoist I lifted these two thousand pounds of flour that was when I was in the on the cereal wing and there is there are rocks that hold it from the bottom so normally you would guide it to the hopper and then you take the Rope off and then when you take the Rope off and then it will just shoot they are there are two ropes you can take the first one out and then wait till the second one gets there I mean wait till you get there and then you take the second one off unknown to me the first one had already been taken off when I lifted it so I reached out and I took the last one I didn't realize it so I guided this 2 000 pounds of flour in the super sack to the hopper and as soon as it got there then it opened I said oh what just happened I mean God just shows himself around us that why he did not just drop they rub us off he still did not drop until it got where it was supposed to be praise God is just all around us all around us when you're on the highway it is there at work he is there at home he is there it's not only when you come to church he is with you every single moment of your life and wherever you are know that the angels of the Lord have been given church over you to keep you to Bear you up and to see you through praise be to God the title of my message this morning is shall he find faith when he comes shall he find faith when he comes that is the title of my message praise be to God so God would prove every child of his praise be to God the children of God saw God in Israel and in the wilderness as the Church of the Living God they saw God how God was performing now in the wilderness that was why the most trying moments came and it is our Wilderness Journey our Wilderness Journey with Christ that has the most problem that when you are going through that process of sanctification and God is cutting you to shape cutting you here and there cutting you here and there like you go to the Riverside and you dig yourself a piece of clay and you come and you mold it and sometimes you don't like how it looks you break it and you remold it you break it and you remold it that is what God does he will remold you a remote here and there cut you here left right and center and beg you and make sure that you are good praise be to God and can you imagine the way sometimes the people do to the clay and they break it if the clay had a voice can you imagine how many times the clay would complain And We complain about everything We complain about everything we fail to see that there is a God behind the scene that is pulling the strings We complain so much instead of devoting time to prayer because the created ourselves and seeking the face of God We complain about everything and the children of Israel the church the church in in the wilderness just complain a mermaid about anything everything till they did it for the last time for the last time that they had the word the word of God in their midst and they saw the word of God unfold in signs and wonders in their midst and yet they didn't believe they didn't believe God said I've given you the land but when there was Albania and Moses sent the 12 generals to go and spider land they came back with an evil report except Joshua and Caleb they said no we can't take the land we are as grasshoppers before them and they started memory God said I have given you the land now you are telling God that God is a liar shall he find faith shall he find faith when he comes they disbelieved the word they did not mix the word with faith shall he find faith when he comes in the death of Noah the Bible says there was sin everywhere on the land and God is repented God that he created man and God said he was going to destroy the Earth but Noah found favor with God the Bible says he found Grace and God extended that Grace to all the people because for the 120 years was building the ark he was preaching warning the people of an incoming danger the Judgment of God was coming they made fun of him and that they could just sit down and imagine how on Earth would water come from the skies it's not going to be this man may have lost his mind maybe they may have signed their instruments in the air and the instrument will go and come back and tell them oh there is not even a deal in the atmosphere don't mind what this man is saying he's lost his mind until finally Noah and his family entered the Ark and one morning they just woke up and they saw that the clouds had changed and the wind started to blow and they saw dripless coming they say oh it looks like oh this one has been saying all these years is true I wonder how many of them run today I can started pounding at the door but it was lit it was late when the grace of God has come down take advantage of it don't keep kicking the grace of God away like you are kicking account of an empty can of soda down the road when the grace of God when you have found favor with God take advantage of it it may not always be there would come a time that you are going to seek after it with tears and not find it when you can see God moving in your life when you can see God at work in your life take advantage of it don't let go of it take advantage when a dawn on them that all the things that I was saying was true it was too late we saw that in in in in Sodom and Gomorrah that they lived so much in sin so much evil on the land so much so that a man didn't even want women in their lives anymore neither did a woman man riding after man woman running after men so much so then when the investigating angels went to Sodom and Gomorrah because their sin had come up before God here they came in front of lost door we hear some Two Gentlemen came here and so what you need to release them to us let's say no I have two daughters who have never known men they are virgin no no we want a man they'll pull lot in and struggling with blindness and look God brought lot and his family we know the story how his wife turned into a pillar of salt because she turned back when the angel of the Lord told do not turn back do not turn back just focus just keep going and God reigned fire with Brimstone or Sodom and Gomorrah and deserve it that is the same God we are talking about he is the same yesterday today and forever that God has not changed praise be to God for the blood praise be to God that God has not changed what he did yesterday he will do it today the Judgment of God fell upon these two cities and God consumed them the Bible says he that puts his son to the plow and turns back is not worthy of me keep your focus on Christ keep your focus if there is a little bit of God in you when you even sleep and you fall your focus is on him you will gather your life back together and you also keep your focus there is no way a sheep would find itself in a suspect and we just lie there and enjoy it because it wasn't meant for it a big one lady and enjoy it for years not a sheep the Sheep will cry and cry and cry till the shepherd comes for it if there is anything wrong with your life and you know it is not right you are hearing the word of God it is the grace of God to you repent put your life back to John track put your life back on track the devil will tell you or you can do it tomorrow you can do it tomorrow and before you are aware it's one year down the line and you have not done it there are people that have said to themselves tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow and then they live for 10 20 30 years and they died living in sin it is your life with Christ we are talking about there is a God we are serving and God is interested in every aspect of your life he is interested on in your Uprising and in your down sitting in good health in sickness in terms of Plenty in terms of nothing that God is there a friend when all other friends are around and he said he makes a friend on all those friends have gone away a friend that is with you in this life and the only friend that will be on the other side waiting to say welcome son praise be to God how on Earth can you sacrifice this how on Earth can anybody in their right mind look at a god of love the god that gave his all for you and me his very own life he gave it for you and me how can anybody look at this and then turn it down and rather want to still have fellowship with the Devil if the devil could repent he wouldn't be a devil he would have repented and you that have the opportunity to repent and seek the face of God you want to keep company with the Devil I don't know why this is going praise be together when he comes shall he find faith on earth when he comes shall he find faith when you have gone through your Wilderness Journey that determines what you have truly believed it is not an entirely bad thing when you think you are standing and then something happens and you realize that oh after all I wasn't standing it is not an entirely a bad thing it only becomes bad that when you have realized that you are not even standing after all and then you realize oh it's even okay that is when it gets bad but then when you can just get off with all those broken pieces and then you come with an honest heart it looks like I'm going ahead of him but I think I put something down very very close to this let me see if I can get it praise be to God we'll probably get there as I told you I wrote in ink and everything looks like one sentence praise God so are you going to keep the faith are you going to keep the faith God will not just take you from the street and then just give you his Spirit like that no it doesn't just happen it's like picking a glass from there from the trash can and then just coming home filling it with water and then you start drinking who does that and God wouldn't do that God is going to wash you he's going to patch you it's going to cleanse you it's going to make sure that you are in tune you are in tune with this word then he gives you his holy spirit but that process is where a lot of us get stuck that we don't endure that sound chastening of the Lord that when we begin to go through things we are quick to find a way out immediately we are looking for the exit door when situations are coming into our lives we are ready to turn our backs on Christ and we fail to see the hand of God that is working in our lives God working in our lives to bring us onto an expected end for his namesake we have seen we have seen all of us here in one way or the other have pasted of the Deliverance of God else you will not be here the reason we we come here every Sunday every Wednesday whether it's raining whether it is snowing it doesn't matter the distance when the child doors are open we want to be in church it is because we have tested of God we are not just here as a number no there is something in you that is driving you here so in one way or the other we have all seen the arm of God revealed in our lives Earth will not be coming and going but if for any reason there is anybody here that is just coming and going then you need to seek the face of God more earnestly because there is more to just come in and going there is something beyond that praise be to God now when you look at in the days when God delivered Israel that out of the two million people that were delivered only two crossed over and then you look at the deaths of Noah out of all the people that lived only Noah his wife his three sons and their daughters I mean wise eight people eight eight people made it over and then he looked at Sodom and Gomorrah only three people Lord and his two daughters sometimes you can't force you can't help but begin to do some calculation if out of 2 million only two were saved and then only it in Noah's time and the only three in Sodom and Gomorrah where do I stand it is not for you to start making any calculation the devil knows that math more than you do and if you ever want to go that route you are going to be in trouble instead of you sitting down and making the calculation I would advise you to take an inventory of your life and see where you stand with God see where you are Christ instead of doing that calculation don't look at you the sacrifice that was slain on our behalf was a worthy sacrifice and our lives are saved is that what we are looking at we are not looking at what we can do praise be to God when God sent Jonah to ninevee God does not take the Delight in destroying his own he is a god of love yes without a doubt when Jonah went to ninevee and then he cried against that City and told them of the Judgment of God coming down from the King to his servant from man and beasts young and old they procla came the fast and the bread and they saw the face of God and the wrath of God was staying away the wrath of God was stand away this is the God we are talking about he doesn't take the Delights the Bible says um can we open to some 51 I think it should be Psalm 51 yes 51 17. 51 17. the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit and a broken and a contrite heart oh God that will not despise now I tried to find out what's this word contrite what it means and a contrite heart means to be humbled by your own sins and failures seeking after God and the Bible says a broken and a contrite spirit God would not despise to be humbled by your own sins not by somebody else's sins oh this brother or this sister this is what we are going through this is God what you have done how about you how about you sometimes we have the beam in our eyes we don't see that but we rather see this pack in somebody else's eyes first take the beam out of your eyes so you can see clearly to take the spec from somebody else's eyes not being humbled by somebody else's sins of failures but being humbled by your own sins and failures a broken and contrite heart God would not despise that you don't blame people for your failures you don't blame people for living in sin because they did this because they said this I am going to do it anyhow taking responsibility for your errors take a responsibility for your mistakes take a responsibility for your failures taking responsibility for your sins and not put into anybody and then you can come before God with humility not with arrogance come giving excuses why you did it you can never justify sin what is evil is evil what is Sin is Sin sin can never be justified never come before God giving an excuse or excuses or reasons why you did what you did if it is wrong it is wrong if it is wrong it's wrong come with humility with a broken and a contrite heart God would never turn you away God would never turn your way and God saw that demonstrated in any way when Jonah cried against their sins God sought through humility and that's right out to God and God had them thank God God is not a man Jonah was not happy when Jonah cried against the city and wanted to sat down under that tree he wanted to see fire come down God is such a man if God was like you and me oh my goodness there is no flesh that was going to be saved but God is long-suffering towards us he is patience patient with you we ought to be patient with one another praise be to God we are serving a mighty God kiss do you care we don't have to be Reckless with our lives and no always remember never let that lose your mind always remember who you are that is very very important and this work with Christ be to God shall he find faith shall he find faith on earth when he comes as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man praise be to God some people think they can outsmart God you can never outsmart God I remember in the year 2000 I was still a prison officer I stationed in tarkwa western region western part of uh Ghana um and then the um the New Year Eve the New Year Eve normally we have a watch night and it is just it is just the norm in Ghana New Year Eve that is there is there is uh a watch night you just go and you pray your way through the night into the following morning and I remember very well in the year 2000 December 31st I was on duty and I was working so I was I was in there um based on open prison um you are there it's just four corners no let me see I I don't remember again but I believe it was now praise the Lord so that night my goodness the atmosphere was charged you could hear all the churches in the city literally praying praying and singing the atmosphere was charged now they were saying that from from from the beginning of the creation to uh the time of the flood is two thousand years from that time to Christ two thousand years so now it's another 2000 years something is going to happen and they were on fire because what is 2000 years and something is going to happen they were on fire and nothing happened it's 2023. nothing has happened there is a cool enough they had that they waited on the Lord that Zeal has left them the way they were keeping themselves because something is going to happen because they're creating themselves and nothing happened they just went back to their old ways like a dog going back to his vomit but there is a looming Danger there is a looming Danger if man can only see the grace of God there is a little bit Danger they have cooled off it was just the same way with the children of Israel in the wilderness when Moses went up the mountain and they waited and waited and waited we don't even know what has become of this Moses whether he's even alive or not and it's just always the nature of man and they prevailed on Aaron to get them an idol and they started worshiping the idol instead of the Living God and today people have waited for so long according to them and they have not seen anything and they are going back into the world even people in this message people that oh my goodness praise the Lord people that have preached this message people that once upon a time we were looking after drawing encouragement from they have abandoned their faith why because something happened in some cases because they have waited for too long they have gone back to the world but the Bible says in Matthew 24 if we can turn there for a minute foreign Matthew 24 43 Matthew 24 43. and I read but know this the Lord Jesus has spoken that if the good man of the house had known in what hour the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up 44 therefore be ye also ready for is such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh praise be to God so you come up a strategy for God it was like this purple knew one day when when the teeth was coming they say oh the thief there's a thief coming and the chief is going to come in amen there is a chief coming and the thief is going to come in at 12 30. so and he's coming through this main door so let me sit here and wait for him the teeth is smarter than that maybe those those thieves does Taylor cassava Casa cassava and goats but thieves are very smart if you want very very smart people they are very smart but in the wrong way and and and and as a matter of fact the criminals are always ahead of us you look at the FBI and the and the CIA and other police before they get to realize this is what they are doing they have done it for so long they are very smart in the wrong things not even come when you're awake they will come when you are snoring and then you somebody would tap your hand on the back and then you think it's your your baby oh that disturb me I want to sleep and then you wake up and there is a gun to your head that is how they're in there and the Bible is saying that he is going to come in as a thief when you least expect when you are in bed snoring spiritually not physically it's a good thing to have good sleep if you snore like me you don't have a problem I don't know it's like everybody in America I don't know it's not everybody though let me know everybody but I wasn't snoring when I was in God yeah I don't know what is the air water is the cold I don't know I can snow in the world has to be shaking praise the Lord yes so spiritually if you go to bed and you are at peace and when you are supposed to be praying and consecrating your life and meaning business with God and you think all is all right you have become so complacent and you decide to relax you are going to be taking on our voice it is not the unbeliever that is going to be taken by surprise he doesn't care about anything I have seen people that say there is no God and there are people that will tell you that don't believe in anything I am a free thinker but you and me no better than that we know there is a God we know that we are not just here to stay we know we have a place to go we know that the life we are living is no longer ours we've been bought and paid for by the blood we belong to Christ there is a life God expects of you and me if you deceive yourself or if you want to deceive people you are going to be found out make sure that you are working at your salvation with fear do not take the grace of God for granted praise the Lord now when the son of man comes shall he find faith shall he find faith of when the son of man comes shall he find faith praise the Lord that is what we are talking about this morning thank God that he has sent us a prophet because the mystery of America 4 5 and 6. is to turn our hearts to the faith of apostolic fathers behold I will send you later before the coming of the Great and the Deathly of the Lord and He Shall attend Earth of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a case is Ministry the message God has sent us is to direct our hearts back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to the Faith of Our Apostolic fathers it's a proven Ministry God has Vindicated it with signs and wonders following and wherever this message went the pillar of fire was there to vindicate his word the angel of the Covenant was there praise be to God all to turn our hearts back to the faith of our fathers shall he find faith when he comes remember you are supposed to be flesh of his flesh both of his bones and spirits of his Spirit praise be to God and this message has come to deliver us to deliver us from our sins our iniquities our superstition traditions customs failure to the kingdom of God and it is the spirit of the age that overcomes it is not you we have to submit ourselves to the will of God if we want to see the glory of God it is this message that overcomes the spirit of the age outside of it I don't know how you are going to do it if you find something outside of this message let me know about it in the message oh Lord once more the prophet of God says do you know that the Roman Catholic Church was the first original Pentecostal Church it taken them two thousand years to get in the condition is God's today and then he goes on to say and if they Pentecostal organization keeps on another 50 years it will be worse than the Catholic Church that's right sin heaping on every side now when you read something like this it makes your hair to spin for a while that the Roman Catholic Church will see today Once Upon a Time Once Upon a Time was not in this condition that once upon a time that stood for what was right stood for the word believe in Miracle science and wonders and the prophet of God is saying it has taken them two thousand years to get where they are now and he's saying that this Pentecostal organization give it another 50 years and it will be worse than the Catholic Church what does that tell you now when you look at the way God deals that in in all the seven Church ages now God sends a prophet to the people and then he can't say he puts that right back in track and then gives them the word of God and then when God takes the man out of the sin oh they are happy for a while they are living by the word for a while and then after a while they start drifting away from the right track till you look at them and you don't even know why they stand and God has to send another prophet to come and bring them back now when you look at it this will begin to come together we are in the last Church age the seventh Church age we are not looking forward to any more Church ages the prophet of God for this age has come and gone he has given us the message of God and now it will surprise you how people in this message churches have already started denominating now another 50 years I don't know how it's going to be if Christ carries another 100 years I don't know how it's going to be and the Bible says in Matthew 24 22 that accept the days be shortened they shall no flesh saved there is more to it than this can we just open to it Matthew 22 24 Matthew 24 22 and accept those days except those days should be shortened there shall no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened praise be to God for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened but if those days are not shortened it is not it's going to be dangerous it is not an easy thing when the son of man comes shall he find faith there is so much sin on Earth today since that we didn't have name for 20 30 40 years ago they have names for it now things you couldn't just imagine are happening right now in the day and age we are living in there is so much sin that people's faith in God is waxing cold sin on every side sin on every side when you look at what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah and then you look at the country in which you are living today it tells you that we are very very close to the end there is a looming Danger there is Judgment that is waiting to fall very things that is we are doing it today we are doing it today here in America and not only are we doing here in America but America has become the how do I call it the ambassadors they have become the ambassadors to this evil because a whole sitting president flies a whole jet Air Force One somewhere in Africa and then he goes Africa has a lot of problems the disease the poverty the economic climate and all that you can mention and they go and they don't talk about any of those things but they go and they are telling the president and his people to to to legalize gay and lesbian marriage is it not a shame and years later a vice president a city Vice President also gets up and flies a plane against Africa to go and propagate the same message to go and propagate the same message it's okay for a man to marry man woman to marry a woman the Judgment of God has come down the world has become so so sinful that is why President says that God if God does not destroyed this Earth that does not destroy America he would have to go and resurrect the people in Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to them because the very thing they did that God destroyed them that is what this country is doing today that is what they are doing today is so stinky my goodness at work in the neighborhood in the store they don't hide it what a shame Lord have mercy if you put hundred dogs together dogs you can never get a male dog running after a male dog and human beings with conscience your conscience must be dead your conscience must be dead live abominable lives and they call it human rights Lord have mercy and and even what I find strange what I find strange that when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed the Earth with flood he gave a sign the Rambo that he will no longer destroy the Earth by water and what amazes me is that of all the colors they're right in the world these people in the alphabet community have chosen to go for the rainbow colors they have chosen to go for the rainbow colors because when you see the rainbow it reminds you of the Judgment that fell on on the people in the Solomon I mean in the deaths of Noah that's what it is it reminds you of that God destroyed the Earth with a flood and has given us a sign that he will no longer do it by War that is what it brings to you and then you have a people that will go and take the same rainbow he said you know what we know you destroy the Earth with water because the people were living in sin but you know what we are going to do it and we are going to use it as our colors that is what it means to me what else it's like they are daring God it's like they are daring God last week not last week last two weeks Wednesday I have never seen that side before we were coming to church and get it to 94 East there was a rainbow it's rendered I came in a little late because the storm was so bad in Saint Michael and I came and met some branches here I knew it was also the same way here there was a rainbow and another rainbow inside of rainbow I have never seen that in my life two rainbows it was so beautiful and as I was driving with my wife and a model and gospel I said this is just a confirmation that God said he will not destroy the Earth with the flood anymore but it is also a confirmation that God is going to destroy this Earth by this time it is not with flood I have never seen it praise be to God I don't know what it means but that was what I was telling them in the car there is so much evil so much evil oh my goodness people don't have conscience anymore oh my Lord have mercy Lord have mercy that this people can choose to do anything they want to do and it's fine but if you a Christian should attack them it becomes a problem they were matching they were matching one day any Christian woman that was preaching they went and harassed the woman and that case didn't go anywhere and I was wondering if it was the other way around oh the news Atlas we're going to talk about it that is how low we have sunk as a nation we have sang so low that we can't sing anymore because we have hit rock bottom we are living in the most difficult times without a doubt in the most challenging times in the most challenging times when I was growing you would have to get up and then walk several miles or take a car to go somewhere to go and watch a television or to go and watch a movie but we are living in an age where you can just be in the comfort of your room and misbehave if you want to that is how dangerous the world has become there is so much Darkness on the land today so my spiritual Darkness on the land today but you know also you know also my goodness you know light does not shine in the light praise the Lord and light shines brightest in darkness in a time and age we are living in why there is so much Darkness on the land look you don't even need too much light shine the little light in you would shine tell us who you are what the grace of God can do in the life of a man praise be to God I'll be wrapping up very soon it's 1 12. praise God now when the son of man comes shall he find faith faith come here by hearing and hearing by the word of God there are a lot of side attractions on this path we've been called to walk on and those side attractions are not meant to help you in your work with God they are meant to distract you that if care is not taken and then you get to a place and you say let me just stand and turn for a moment you can never guarantee what will happen next there are a lot of side attractions don't look left don't look right keep your focus Freight keep feeding on the word of God Faith come over hearing and hearing by the word of God keep feeding on the word if the word that created the Heaven and Earth abides in you that word will transform your life that word in you will take you to places you never dreamed of only if you give room to the word to work on you cannot find place in your heart if you cannot entertain the word the word will not have any effect in your life it is not time to seek recognition don't expect people to come and party on the back don't expect people to come pleading with you no you should know by now Who You Are you should know by now why you stand straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to life and few Debbie my blood is the way that leads to destruction the way of Christ is not a popular way to go but that is the way of life that is the path God has chosen and ordained for you and me Once Upon a Time the horse and the Tortoise were put together in a race and you guys know by now that I love stories because this story was told to me by uh gospel he came from school one day he said hey do you want to hear a story I said yes he said there was there was a race between a tortoise and a horse and um when they started the race the horse just went and left the tortoise by the the whole the horse got replaced and then started to rest and then he slept and the Tortoise came and overtook it and went and won the race praise be to God so we are going to fill in the gaps that there was a race between a tortoise and a horse and when you look at it a tortoise a tortoise and a horse it's not fair right but they were put together in a race and all the people that came everybody threw their weights behind the horse they look at the Majestic nature of the horse so beautiful that they can sit on it and ride it patting it on the back and playing with it they found favor with them and then look at this poor creature put this down there that nobody can play with I don't know if anybody keeps a tortoise for a pet I will not be surprised if they do it because I know of somebody that has snake for a pet and if I have to keep a snake for a pet I'd rather go in for a tourist s and then you look at this mean fellow down there that you can't even pet because if you make a mistake your hand goes in between the shells it's going to clip it and then they put them together in a race get ready go and the horse was gone completely gone and then here comes the tortoise and people were making fun of it making fun of it just one step at a time one step at a time one step at a time and then the horse gets to the muddy area and then he decides to stop to rest and days later here comes the tortoise and then the toilet comes to meet it and they have to cross this Mighty area the horse said no I am not going this way I am too clear for this this mess I'm not going to work in it by the tortoise one step at a time it goes in the one step at a time just swimming in the mud crosses there and the horse says I know a better route and they took a route over speeding and it crashed and died it never made it so there is a way that has been ordained for you and me and me you may not like it you don't have to like it but it is a word has been chosen a word has been ordained for you and me that sometimes in your work with God you get to that place and you look at the situation tell yourself no I don't think I want to go through this but if there is a little bit of God in you you would go through it for the glory of God praise be to God that people don't have to party on the back you don't have to achieve those I mean get those accolades you know they don't have to they don't have to pamper you it has nothing to do with your image physically it's what God is doing in your life that you are ready just for the love of God you are ready to do anything for the love of God people will laugh at you oh we know you better you used to be like this oh I am that normal I don't do that anymore but we used to drink with you by the grace of God I don't drink anymore one step at a time we used to go to the club with you by the grace of God I don't go there anymore one step at a time and then they would laugh at you they make fun of you they call you names oh you are wearing this you are doing this you look like Grandpa you look like Grandma praise be to God one day at a time one day at a time and they look at you and they Wonder what is driving you what is it that is keep pushing you he is the author and the finisher of our faith we are in his hands we are Overcomers we are we are bound to overcome the spirit of this age can never hold us back there is nothing in this life there is nothing by the grace of God that can hold us back we are Overcomers God forbid that you don't make it God forbid but if you don't your problem is not with God that problem is you everything we need to overcome God has given it to us it is not an easy Road it is not don't let anybody deceive you it's not an easy Road but we have enough Grace to be able to walk in this path and do that which God wants us to do it is not our strength we don't even have to begin with it is not our righteousness because we don't even have it to begin with it is not what you can do because there is nothing you can do just come by God's ordained way there is a way God has ordained unto life whatever condition you find yourself in if you can only remember who you are and what God has already done for you and what you are banking your hopes on praise be to God the rest will be history there is no failure in the kingdom of God I don't care how sick you can be I don't care how poor you can be I don't care how hungry you can be I don't care what it is that you go through if you are in the will of God praise be to God there is nothing that compares to it when he comes shall he find faith shall he find faith will he see flesh of his flesh born of his bone Spirit of his Spirit In You when God took aif Daddy from the side of Adam and produce if when Eve woke up from that sleep when Adam woke up from that sleep and looked at Eve he said this is woman because she was taken from me both of my boys are Flesh of My Flesh can Christ look at you and say the same you are the bride of Christ you are his wife like Eve was to Adam can he look at you and say you are Flesh of My Flesh born of my born Spirit of my spirit can he say that about you if he can't say that about you now it's not too late it is not too late you still have room to change whatever it is that needs to be changed it's not too late surely Find Faith the musicians can come over praise be to God shall he find faith when he comes shall he find faith when he comes pay with the word stay with the word of God the Bible says by the spirit give of life there is life in the word of God in the beginning it was the way the word was it God and the Word was God the word is nothing short of God okay with the word [Music] stay with the word like that animal I was talking of that when that animal gets a hold of a branch it has a very ugly name in my darling I don't want to call the name I don't call the name but I don't want anybody to try it let me lock your job it has a very ugly name they call it it's small it's not big [Music] and when he takes a hold of a branch you will kill it it will never let go of the branch stay with the word of God and there is nothing that pleases God to see a son or a daughter staying with a word to obey is better than sacrifice obedience full obedience to the word of God is what brings God down but if you are half and half half and half what happens is that you have a form of godliness and you deny the power thereof and that is the spirit of the age that Luke was spirit that local spirits a little called you a little hot there mix it together you are not standing for God and you are not standing for the devil either you are just in between you have become an entity of the enemy you better be hot or you better be cold praise be together are I want us to live here this morning this afternoon one thing on our hearts that we are going to live by the faith that has been delivered unto us the Faith of Our Fathers the afraid that overcomes this world and the spirit of the age we are going to live by the faith that when he comes he would find faith on Earth remember he is coming for his own and I want us to go in prayer I want us to just pray [Music] just come here and search it to his hands ask for more of his grace because there is nothing we can do without him and when our lives are not Measuring Up that the grace of God will be able to see us through Beyond coming to church and going home there is something if you are not seeing it by the grace of God it's not too late by the grace of God it's not too late there is hope for the living if you are not dead God can do anything there is hope for the living just look
