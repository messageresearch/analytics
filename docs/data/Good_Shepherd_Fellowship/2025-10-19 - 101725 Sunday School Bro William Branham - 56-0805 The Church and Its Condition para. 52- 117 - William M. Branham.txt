========================================

[Music] [Music] three years old. You know that's a lie. But you let your kids get their head stuck full of that. And there isn't one% out of 100 that ever know anything about Jesus Christ is because this world has become so polluted. this nation so ridiculous and so far from God has rejected the Holy Ghost. Oh, you say, "I go to church and shout, you might do that, &gt;&gt; but until that gentle lamb of God settles in your heart and makes you clean up your life and act like a different person, it won't do you any good to impersonate Christianity, you've got to have it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My god. &gt;&gt; I went into a house sure not long ago to visit a sick man and a lady was lay sitting there and a little old Oswald come in hat sitting on the side of his head is dinner ready. She said honey that we haven't had time said this morning to get any dinner. Said I'm fixing a sandwich. Said there's some oranges. He walked over and got a hold of an orange looked at dipped into it. pulled it up against the wall as hard as he could. The juice shone down to the he got around this place and I now go be mine for about five minutes. Boy, I jerked the hide off of him like he'd never jerked off. &gt;&gt; But family there pitying baby. What he needs is a good oldfashioned limb skinning. That's why we need some oldfashioned homes again and some preachers that will stand behind the pull pit and preach the truth and lay it down where it belongs to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Oh my little Mary stomp her little feet and stick that little nose up and turn them little bitty rosecoled lips by Max Factor stuff up in the air and stick her little head up and walk out of the house. What a disgrace. how disobedient children are being. The Bible said they would be. &gt;&gt; The scripture said they would be, how they would act, how they would do, and the things that's going on in the world today is because they have grieved away the Holy Spirit. A few years ago, I'm going down a few days to celebrate the first falling of the Holy Ghost in America 50 years ago. this year at the old ISUsa street meeting, Pentecostal meeting in Los Angeles where they had their first falling of the Holy Spirit when the people got together. When Christ come down among those people, they were just as gentle, just as peaceful. They live godly lives. They live sacrificial lives. They were willing to give in. They were willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. They didn't care what the people said. They were oldfashioned or they said they were crazy or what about it. They were willing to be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But today, oh my, with a powder pup and a bakeup box and a pair of shorts on and out on the street, why it's a disgrace and calling themselves with the Holy Ghost. Oh, you say, "But I spoke a tongues." Yes, and the devil does, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, I shouted, "And the devil does, too." The devil can impersonate everything God's got except love. And he can't impersonate love. Amen. Thank God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the first thing you know when you started doing those things, you let down the bars, you begin compromising and the church begin to get little clux clicks in among them. And this said, you know, the pastor is this so and so or the deacon so and so. And the first thing you know, you listen to that. And that's the reason we've had so much trouble is because you begin to listen to the devil and get a snarl instead of listening to the gentle dove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the dove of God that would lead you and guide you and love you and bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First time you get one of those little temper spasms, the dove flies right away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. She can't stand it. Her nature is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, she can't stand that at all. And you go to talking about your neighbor, she can't stand that. &gt;&gt; She just won't put up with it. He just takes his flight and goes on away. He just can't stand it any longer. The dove is gentle. The dove is neat. And the dove and the and it can't stand on nothing unless it's the same kind of nature. Now, God can make you a different nature, man or woman. He can give you a different nature. And you say, "Well, Brother Brandham, what can we do about it?" just become a lamb again. It's only two animals will ever associate together. That's the dove and the lamb. The dove won't come to anything else but a lamb. And if you become a goat, then get that old goaty spirit off of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you become something else, get it away from you. If you begin to become a tadler, here one time I preached just as hard as I could preach in a certain city and there was thousands of people there. I made an altar call and I thought I covered a whole realm of sin. I covered everything that I could think of. That night after the service over, a very pissy little woman walked by. She said, "But Brother Ram, I'm sure glad that you didn't touch me tonight." I thought that must be a real Christian. Said, "You didn't touch me tonight." I said, "Well, I'm certainly glad you hear that lady. You must be close to the kingdom of God." And she tipped away some elderly ladies standing there. I said, "Say, do you know that woman?" Yes. And I said, "She must be a real Christian." Said, "One thing you failed to hit tonight, Brother Brandon, that was gossip. She's the chief gossiper in the country." There you are. That's it. See, but when you come to one of those things, no matter whether a preacher hits in the pull pit or not, when you see those carnal things of the world, as long as you intolerate with them, you're away from God and the Holy Spirit will stay away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the meetings are not like they used to be. That's the reason the sawdust trail isn't born this morning in the tabernacle. That's the reason the great tit meetings are not around the country is because we have breathed away the gentle dove of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's &gt;&gt; right. He won't stay with us as long as we're so indifferent. As long as we're backbiting, we want our ways. Now, I want you to notice the lamb was a silent lamb. The Bible said he opened not his mouth. Like the sheep before the shears, he was dumb. He didn't open his mouth. He wasn't a fellow that wants his rights. No, sir. He was willing to forfear for his right. He was a silent man. But today, oh my how, we want our differences. Oh my. I tell you, you just let somebody say something to me. I'll go over and get him, boy. I'll take him apart. I'll tell that old hypocrite when I see her. Just wait till I see her. Bless God. Hallelujah. Mhm. &gt;&gt; The dove just takes his flight and goes on away. That's right. The Holy Spirit's not with you anymore. As long as you feel that way, just mark that down in your book. It'll never do it. A Holy Spirit just won't stay around where that kind of a spirit is. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a lamb spirit, a gentle spirit or just won't stay with it. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; If it ain't a gentle meat led by the Holy Spirit, and if anything comes up, it just don't even notice it. Just goes on. See, and the very minute that it turns a sign, you know that's the very the when you turn aside, do you know the first sin started of a person turning aside just for a minute? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you know that the Bible said so? Eve turned aside just a moment. &gt;&gt; Do you hear what Satan had to say? And he painted a picture so pretty to her till she actually thought it was the truth and she listened to him. And the only thing the devil wants you to do is just turn aside just for a few minutes. He can paint the picture and say, "Now look here. You know, brother, you know, sister, if they were the right kind of people, they wouldn't do this. If they just did this right here, you know, he can make it so real to you until it becomes a real truth." &gt;&gt; Right. But remember, it's the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how low down they are, how far they've stooped in sin. It's your business to put an arm around them and lift them up by the love of God. Where was you when the devil of God lifted you out of Mari Clay? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's your business, my friend. &gt;&gt; This world of dying for a little bit of love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The I want you to notice this animal, too. This little animal, it was a solid lamb because it didn't when he was reviled, he reviled not again. He didn't rail and carry on and fuss and stew and go on. He didn't do it. When somebody's when he was reviled, he reviled not again. He opened not his mouth. But you let somebody do something to you &gt;&gt; or me. Oh my. We blow up like a toad frog eating bugshot. &gt;&gt; Puff out like a like an old goose. I tell you right now, you step on my toes like that again. I'll never go back to that old church again. Oh, sure. Bless God. Hallelujah. The Nazarines will receive me. The pilgrim holiness, they'll take me. Hallelujah. I don't have to do it no more. All right. The dove takes its flight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what? If that old hypocrite goes to that church, I'll never go again. Bless God, I'll never do it. When that thing strikes you, that old snarling wolf, the dove takes her flight, &gt;&gt; right? Then the Holy Ghost is gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you wonder what's the matter with you. You wonder what's the matter with the church. You wonder what's the matter with you. Why ain't you got victory like you used to have? You change your nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You become a goat instead of a lamb. &gt;&gt; You become something else besides a lamb. You've got to get that real meat spirit. Let the Holy Ghost lead me wherever. God, I love every sinner no matter where they are. &gt;&gt; That kind of a place get into my heart. Then you're going to see something happen. Your soul say, "Well, brother Brandham, is there any solution for it?" Yes. Just become a lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all you say. Say, "Well, brother Brandon, I met a young lady the other night down street. Billy and I went out to a place to get a sandwich at the service store. A beautiful young woman come in there, probably a young girl or maybe a 20 or something like that. Nice dress. She sat down. I noticed she kept looking across that way. I just kept on eating. Few minutes the lady come in. She said, "How did you spoke to her?" And I know the lady was Sister Davis down there. and um her and another lady from Life of Tabernacle. I knew them well. She come over, spoke to me, went on. Then the young lady sitting across, she said, "Brother Bram, that was a nice message tonight." I said, "How do you do, sister?" I said, "Thank you very much." And I said, "Um, are you a member of the live tabernacle?" She said, "I am." She said, "You know, Brother Bram, I could have sung in the choir, but they make a restriction down there." She said, "I had oh so many years of vocal training and everything." said, "I sang solos and I sang certain things." Said, "But I I couldn't sing because they have a they have a restriction that no woman wearing paint can slang in the choir." I said, "Well, praise God for life tabernacle." &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, I tell you, Brother Brandham," she said, "Uh, I'm a Christian." I said, "Then sister, go home and wash your face or whatever you do." I said, "Do you mean to tell me that you let such a little thing is wearing a little that old stuff on your face?" Now, I can prove to you that that come from the devil. I can prove to you that nothing in the that originally was heathens. And as long as you wear it, it's a mark of a heathen. Now, I just come back from Africa and I've been in the hot and hot jungles and found out just exactly where earrings where all that stuff comes and all this lot of jewelry and wrap around your neck and ears and everything where that comes from. It's the heathens. And the Bible don't want a Christian to be a heathen. And you don't want I don't say that you are a heathen because you do it, but you're making yourself look like one. It's because your pastor didn't tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. And now you say, "Brother Brandon, I think if I got short hair, it makes me cool and everything like that's right. But if you got long hair, you'd be cooler. It'll take it all off your neck and wrap it up and make it right." Well, you know what the Bible said? that a man has a right to put away his wife, get a divorce from her if she cuts her hair. If she cuts her hair, it shows she's living untrue to him. The Bible said so. 1 Corinthians 12, find out if it's not right. She that a woman that cuts her hair dishonors her head, which is her husband. And if she's dishonorable, she should be divorced and got away from. That's right. But see, the pastor never tells you those things. And that's the reason that you do the way you do. and and the man the Bible said here not long ago there was somebody wrote in and said brother Brandham the these blouses that women get said well it's such a you just can't hardly find blouses anymore and it would be all right for us Christian women to wear these dayrons nylons or what it is like that I said look sister there's one thing about it here's one thing true you can do this if you can't buy one they sell sewing machines you can make one I said that's right to make it look this I believe you know what's in your heart is what expresses itself. The way you do and the way you act that shows what's in you. That's the reason that all this you're snarling and fussing and backbiting and and biting back and carrying on around the church. That's what breaks up the church. That shows that the devil got into you and that shows the Holy Ghost left you. &gt;&gt; God. Now &gt;&gt; I know that's just burning the tar out of some of you, but it ought to do it. It ought to. That's what it's said for, not to be smart, not to act cute, but to tell you where the trouble is. For someday, I'm going to have to stand and give it an answer for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the very reason you do and the way you act, that shows what you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you just got an old temper that will fly off the handle just a little bit and get out here and carry on or criticize or vulgarity and stuff like that, that shows where it's coming from. &gt;&gt; Now, there's only one thing to do. Get that thing out of there &gt;&gt; and the dove will come back to your heart. When the dove went out of the ark, she was turned out. But she come back and knocked at the dark door and told Noah let her in. The Holy Ghost is here. The Holy Ghost wants to come in. That's the reason that the day that the Holy Spirit, it hasn't gone from you forever. It's just sitting out there on the limbs of the tree somewhere ready to fly itself back and to come into you and give you love and peace and joy like you used to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure it is. It's ready to do it. He wants to do it. He's longing to do it. But you won't let him do it. Now, I'm not talking to you, stranger. I don't know what your pastor. I'm talking to the Brandon Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't talking to you people in other churches. I'm talking to the brand tabernacle. That's what's the matter around here. That's what makes the dove take his flight. Just let somebody just start a little something around the church and the first thing, oh, is that so? Oh, did you don't mean so. Right? Then the Holy Ghost goes fly away. Amen. &gt;&gt; They just can't stand that kind of spirit. &gt;&gt; As long as that lamb nature leaves you and the Holy Ghost is gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's what's the matter today. &gt;&gt; That's the reason the people's in the condition they are is because they let the wrong spirit come into their heart into their life. Now, that's the reason we got the Bible said that's the reason so many sick and afflicted among us &gt;&gt; is because of such thing. We must be gentle. We must be peaceful. We must be a lamb so that the dove can abide with us. Now remember the dove will come. You said, "Oh, brother Brandham, don't tell me I never received the Holy Ghost." Hallelujah. Down at the night there one night. Oh, when he come in, I could just walk sure that was him. Oh, I felt so good. I felt like I could get every little bird out of the tree and hug it. Love it. My wickedest person ever done anything to me. I felt like I could put my arm around him and hug him. Oh, brother Bam, how I felt. Sure, that was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see the reason he couldn't abide, you was a lamb, man. But when you become a wolf, &gt;&gt; he had to make his flight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the with the with the dove. It's you. &gt;&gt; And though you let that spirit come to you. Did I let it, brother Ram? Yes. When he went to listen to that gossip, when he listened to that lie, &gt;&gt; when he went to say, "Well, I've got a right to." You You haven't got no right. You're bought with a price. &gt;&gt; That was a price of the precious blood of the son of God. &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The only right you have is come to the fountain filled with blood. Go in front of Emanuel's name. When sinners punch beneath the blood, lose all their guilty stain. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's the only right you have is a surrendered self-will to God. And then God does the leading from then on. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what causes the meetings. That's what causes so many strange things. The Holy Spirit will go to a place the Holy Spirit said, "This is not right. Stop the meeting. Move you on." I'll stop it too, brother. Move right on. That's right. Because you've got to be led by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only way to be led by the spirit of God is keep gentle. Not to know a whole lot. Oh, you think I know a whole lot? Yeah. You get your brain all worked up and it can't even work itself. You know all the books and all the answers, all the Greek and all the Hebrew. Now, ain't got no place for the dove to roost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But you know it all. Then the dove can't lead because you know too much. The lamb don't claim to know nothing. &gt;&gt; It's got to have somebody else to lead it. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; Don't know nothing. Amen. The only thing I know is Christ Jesus died to save me. &gt;&gt; Amen. down through California is a guy coming had a sign on the front of him said I'm a fool for Christ and on the back said whose fool are you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Become a fool to the world that you might be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cause the sons and daughters of God are led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1 said, "There's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not to the flesh, &gt;&gt; but the spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. Walk not after the wolf but the dove. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doc used to sing a song, fill my way every day with love. As I walk with the heavenly dove, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a peaceful day it'll be for the Brandon Tabernacle or any other church or any individual when they'll far their rights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To become a lamb. &gt;&gt; What's the question, brother Brandham? Come back to a land. Come back to be gentle. Come back to know nothing. Come back to just submit yourself to Christ. Don't try. Don't try to know nothing. Just walk me, quietly, humbly, gently, and the dove will lead you. But whenever you go to listen to that gossip, whenever you go to get that temper up, whenever you go to thinking you got a right to do this and do that, the dove just takes your flight and goes on away. &gt;&gt; Then you don't have it anymore. Now, she's not very far from you this morning, church. She's sitting right out there on a limb of peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting for your nature to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you need today is to submit all your rights. Is to let God lay you down and shave all your rights off of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine how a little old lamb all hangs his rights? Yeah. Burn it up and then just lay up on the sharing table. They know what's best for him. Take all his rights away from him. Sure, all how cool and light he runs. He's happy and jumps around and has a big time. Yes, sir. If you forfeit your rights, that's what you get. &gt;&gt; But you got to forfeit your right and let the word of God shave all the world off of you. Take all the habits of the world away and you become a new creature in Christ. Here some time ago over in Africa, I was talking to a to an old saint. He said, "Brother Brandon, I know you believe in the supernatural." I said, "Certainly, my brother." He said, "Years ago, I used to think I was somebody." Said, "I thought I was really a Christian." And he said, "Then up in our church, I had to climb a hill where I stopped my little car and said I had to climb a hill about oh three or 4 hundred yards to get around bushes and things getting up and said we'd had prayer meeting up there and said I thought I was really a Christian." He said, "I know all the Bible. I studied all the Hebrew. I studied all the right pronunciations of the words and said anybody walk up to me, I could talk to them like that about the Bible. I know what I was talking about. He said one night I was going up to church. There been a lot of conflict in our church said this little parties against one another. You know how it raised? I said yes sir. He said on my road up the hill I was walking and all at once I become conscious that somebody was following me and said I thought I'd wait just a little bit forever to catch up and I talked to him a little while as we went up the road. You know that's kind of a good thing. you just wait a little while and says as I walked up the hill said I come up a man come up the hill and said he had a bundle on his back that was way bigger than a man and said he was just a painting and a blowing and making his little short steps trying to get up and I said fella can I help you pack this load up a hill said no I got to pack it I looked at his hand that I knew then it was a vision He had scars in his hand. &gt;&gt; So I fell down and I said, "Lord, are you packing the sins of the world in that sack?" He said, "No, I'm just packing yours. Just getting you up the hill just so you can get up." That's the way it is. &gt;&gt; If we just look around, we find out he's packing ours. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it make you feel little? &gt;&gt; Our wicked, cruel heart just because we can do it. there some time ago I was hunting as you know I love to hunt and there was a wicked guy in that country he was a wicked fell and he used to make fun of me because I wouldn't shoot dos and swans I said it's brutal I said won't you be a real clean hunter and shoot the old bucks and things that's old and ready to die that God gave them to us them young mothers and saying he said oh you're chickenhearted preacher kept telling me like that. I said, "Now look, if I was hungry and I wanted one of those fans, I believe God let me have it. But just to shoot it, just to act smart, wait, fill a wagon up." And he went and made him a call or some kind of a whistle and he could blow that whistle and it sound just exactly like a little fawn calling. One day we was in the bushes together. I shamed him. I said, "I've been ashamed of myself. kill eight or 10 fawns one time if you could, doors and everything just to act smart. Maybe cut the hind quarters off and leave the rest of it lay there. I said, "You said, "You preachers are too chicken hearted." One day he stood back in the bushes and he took hold this whistle and he screamed and sound like a little fawn crying. Just as he did that, a beautiful dough stuck her head out, come stomping out. You could see her big brown eyes looking. She was startled. She was looking around. The hunter raised down, pulled up his rifle to shoot the dough. And the dough seen the hunter. But you know what? That scream of that farm. She didn't notice that gun. She was looking for that baby. It was in trouble. You know that display of real motherhood and mother love that she faced that gun in the face for death. Looking at that in the muzzle of that gun, you know what? That display was so great it got next to him. He threw down his gun. He run back and grab me around the arm. He said, "Billy, pray for me. I've had enough of this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he seen that display of mother heroism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, when the world sees the display of the love of God in the gallop in our human heart. What a difference it'll be when we let the dove of God come to our heart and gentleness make us meet. there in that brush harbor back there. Me standing there praying for that old boy. I led him to the Lord Jesus. From then on, he was a good clean hunter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. He thought he had a right. He'd do what he wanted to. That was on my place. They eat my coffee down there if they want to. I said, "That's right. But it's unhuman to do that. &gt;&gt; You've got to forfeit your rights." &gt;&gt; Oh, God have mercy that we will. Here some time ago in oh about a hundred years ago, there was a great Christian live in the southwest United States. His name is Daniel Curry. A wonderful man, a godly man, a sainted man, a real Christian, a man that everybody thought so much of. Such a wonderful person. And the story goes that he died or went into a trance. And he said, "Have you went up to heaven?" Of course, when he died and when he got to the pearly gates, the caretaker come to the door said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the evangelist Daniel Curry. I've won thousands of souls to Christ, and I'm I want to come in this morning. My life's journey is ended on earth. I have no place to go now. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
