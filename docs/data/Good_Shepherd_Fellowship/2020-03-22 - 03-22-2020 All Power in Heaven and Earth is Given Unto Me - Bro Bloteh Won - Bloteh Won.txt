the Lord [Music] [Music] amen Raisa Lord Allah bless you you can help you see amen amen amen we have a little information for you brother Jordan will bring that to you before we bring a word of agitation [Music] good morning Saints god bless you you know with trying times we're have a lot of changes coming up when you're trying to stay ahead of the changes here we're already of course streaming online but as a group we know if as this thing goes on we're probably gonna get to get to the point very quickly where we're not even gathering in the small number where we are this morning probably the next move will be to the point where we'll have brother one maybe a musician a song leader at best and then the technicians to help run it and then we'll be streaming we still want to maintain some sense of community so we've already started looking at what we can do to do that we I don't know how many of you have used it but there's a conferencing program online it's called zoom I don't know how many of you heard of it or have used it it's fairly simple to use and what we're gonna be doing is both using that for meeting and for we're looking towards even using that as response and involvement even in the service that can be both used by Internet service or there's actually the ability we've actually purchased the ability to use it as teleconference so if you do not have internet service or a phone that will use that we will be able get you a number we still are testing that out we're gonna get that tested out here the next day or two here fairly quickly and we will be able to probably avoid you a number or you can actually call into the service so if you don't have internet service or you don't have a smart phone that you can access the YouTube to follow the service we will be able to get you a number or you can you at least tell a conference in to the service and listen and participate we want to use that possibly going forward not only for being a part other services listen to the service but also as we're listening to the service you can then respond to the service hopefully we'll see how it works out there's a very slight few seconds of delay in response but we may even be able to use that for some form of song service we can use that like we do involving people in in praying for the service for prayer meeting or even if family at their location want to have some type of song special they would let you be able to do that they we have tested it from an Internet perspective on video conference we tested yesterday and we can actually bring you in over these speakers so anybody can be heard to anybody that's here and we can actually if you have a song special or we have you pray for the service or something like that it we can actually blend you into the audio going out into the live stream so that way we can still maintain some form of community and connection so we will be sending out additional information one two things that we're gonna be asking for we had originally you know just for informational updates handed out those pieces of paper for everyone to turn in to us we got about nine of them so what we're gonna ask is the email for the church is on the church website if you can't access that then use the if you've getting the group text that everyone's been getting I'll send the church email out on there and we would like to get an email back with your name an active email address and an active telephone number um if you have a cell number that can receive text and what we're gonna do and if you have a number that you would be teleconferencing and if you need to teleconference if you can involve that one and just in the email differentiate which one is the cell number and which one is Allah if it's a landline so we don't send Texas to that landline that way we can actually plug you into the address book that we have on the zoom application and it'll actually bring once whether you're coming up on the application you're coming up on your phone it'll actually show us who it is that's all logged into the service so we'll know who you are we'll have a name identifying you and that will way we can also let whoever's here know if you have a if you have a song special or you have a testimony or you have something that we can know how to involve you and you'll know if you're actually available for that to be called upon so once again to the email an active email address and then an active cell number if you have one that were for text and then an act if you're not going to be using that number for actually teleconferencing if you can send us whatever number you might be teleconferencing in with that way we can identify it in the program let me see if I'm forgetting anything off the bat here we are planning on having just a not a service but just a meeting um meeting here about 7 o'clock tonight just to bring everyone together and kind of conference with even the people who weren't here today so we'll be sending that out by the text of the mass text but the ones been sending out will send out that information and about 7 o'clock this evening wall conference in and just for a discussion if you have any additional questions feel free to text me or give me a call my number is five to zero eight seven zero two four one one and I'll send that out on the text as well that mass text but the ones been sending out for any additional information as we go along thank you praise Allah we want to want to thank thank the Lord in and tank these brothers have been working now doing all they can to to keep us together in such a time like this praise the Lord and just like poor Jordan said that message will go out and if you can download the app on your phone they will give you all the instruction and we try to make a connection this evening and what we want to use there for is to be able to bring you any public information you know and and I mean we want to keep ourself away from all the all the theories that are out there you know and all the different things we have to keep keep I mean the greatest battle in this thing is the thing that goes through the people mind you know I mean the way that this thing has affected the entire world the disease is there is killing people but the fear the more daily thing you know like I told somebody yesterday brought Brooks and myself was talking I said but bros even if the angel of the Lord goes over the earth and sees that disease people would still die because they're afraid the fear is the greatest plague that is on it on the human mind so we just you know with the brothers just decided we'll keep their community so we can talk things we have help workers among us you know I mean brother but a Jordan he said he's a lab technician the other one are looking at those viruses on a microscope you know they can be able to bring us some some firsthand report so that's what we want to use their for and just have prayer meetings and you've meetings and different things so the Lord bless you let's stand on our feet this morning let's bow our heads together have any father it's so good Lord care to be in your house Lord and to have us coming together like this most especially father to have these many brothers and sisters home that are supporting the service this way Lord God is a choice that it may and father it is because of you the Lord we are taking this extreme measure because of your namesake father we we love you and we appreciate you we want to ask that you just bless us now may the holy spirit just move in our maze move in every home of God that is that is turning to the service this morning father precious Lord and now we just ask that you will you do something special for us father we've been taught to God father by your prophet the Moses after 80 years of his life he just lead a fire meanings in your presence to make the difference so we asked this morning father made it be the same for us Lord we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you and once again thank you for everything that each and every one of us are doing to be able to continuum to support the killing of God from this end that we praise the Lord we appreciate your prayers we appreciate your love Matthew chapter 28 Matthew chapter 28 I will take one verse this morning Matthew chapter 28 Matthew chapter 28 verse 18 Matthew chapter 28 verse 18 the scripture says and Jesus came and speak unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world Amen father bless the portion of your word that we have read we love you and we appreciate you Father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you can have your seat I want to correct or go over not correct but I want to go over something I know the past services lasts on the Wednesday I kind of made the same statement again and it's almost like when I made and when I made those statements it's I mean it's you know with with my spirit connection to your spirit it looks like it's not being digested well amen so I said I will go over it this morning a little bit you know I talking about co-equal and talking about creation and in God you know breaking the man and bringing a woman out whole I used the statement that a woman is stronger than the man and and that it is that statement that I see that I see that I see both the both the sisters and the brothers struggle with that in your mind the sister saying how am i stronger than my husband the brother is saying don't tell me my wife is stronger than me [Laughter] praise the Lord amen but you think about it think about it here this morning Jesus do you do you do you think that Jesus didn't know this statement that he made all power in heaven and earth is given unto me do you think that he just found out that morning or he just realized that whoa now I know all power in heaven and earth is given to me I believe with all of my heart he knew right from the beginning but why did he make that statement this was one of his last few words before he left the earth he never made that statement because of himself he made that statement because of the church are we together amen because if all power in heaven is given unto him and he's going to go away what is the use of the all power what is the use of the all power making that declaration and he will not be here what is the need but he's the same one that says I would be with you even in you so he's telling the church this our power I've been a medium when I was here you need it not only that you needed you have it now so you believe that the woman is stronger than the man it's in an amen oh what a way to bring the people to a surrounding I knew I was trapping you into something I was saying it so I was not looking at your physics every time I say there are locust of people what is he going with this it came just tell us what the tape says and forget about all of those things praise the Lord but we want to go through few things this morning quickly because we don't have time just laying their foundation will get to the place he is Becky I sent you two different set of codes so I might be going back and forth and and if you don't have it that's okay we will have all of these things and we can post them on the website praise the Lord Amen now I will start from this one a little bit here endtime evangelism bar Branham says he says there will be plenty of time distress between nation the sea rolling mains filling of heart trouble constantly not among the women now is among the man jesus never said the women he said men look at the plague and in that day that who come to pass there will be the endtime science had feeling fear the flesh are we together sign of the time man had fell in more heart diseases what the that's not women men he never said women had he says he says mmm women had men had all signs and insurance company says is ninety percent men we say in signs an insurance company amen so he's telling us look into the data of medical science don't despise it are we together and something I pick up something I pick up on the health report it says here women tend to have more youthful brain than their male counterpart at least when it comes to I don't know I thought of mine out of my nose never came true well you have it and I don't have it now I was just trying to put these things together quickly and I'm kind of a trilling on the ground years to bring a balance to what what we we trying to to bring to you year but it's for the fact that brother branham make us to say that they're all science and insurance companies is you know and pointing us to be able to look at the reports that are out there it will tell you praise the Lord now you just looking you know when and with with the with the life bearing process that God gave the woman you know that's right on a heart you know and in all the things that she goes through the change of life in everything and he's still placing it to the place on Jesus prophecy that the worse is man hat with fearful fear so the the woman strain is an inner strength now you take that and and post on it a little bit you will see what I'm coming to house-train is a strain that is lying Domon the word shows the Word of God shows that she's a weaker vessel praise the Lord but a chain is only strong it is weakling praise the Lord now this strength is the ability to submit to the word not only the woman as a female but even the church as a woman the strength is to submit to the word let me read another one year that that you appreciate he was to pass this way he says so a good brain wife or mother can do more for the kingdom of God on her knees at home then sometimes the preacher can do on the platform a good praying woman wife at him can do more for the kingdom of God when there when when when a woman find her place when the church find her place the rapture we go that's what he said praise the Lord so when I'm making this tibia I'm not running after the woman as a person I'm after the church but I have to bring it this way just to be able to grab your curiosity now see some of the things that we want to look at here revelation the book of symbol and God in the last date is going to draw true hearts from every way no matter how much counterfeit and chop the devil has God will raise his church right out of it it would be a sealing for sure as I'm standing in this platform and the hour is at him they call and former winning a wedding but in Vangelis recall and all the shoosh work gospel and all of these things are gone and the fantastic side is growing in such a radical fanatism tell anybody blind can see it that's what is happening there in the world but God is pulling his church out amen he says just like the lady the flower little tiny seeds borne away there in the mud and the dirt and all of those things and it's Wayne is way up through the mud through all the mud and and all the scum and become the finest thing that ever that that you ever look into the face of he says so is the Church of the Living God that's being born down through the mud of fanaticism and chaos you think about the fanatism that has run around this message we have had two souls we have had seven thunders we have had I mean different forms of finality that has run I mean II have wrong people millennial doctrine and different things have come up and gone but the Church of Jesus Christ that woman is still standing strong praise the Lord why because her strength is not in weightlifting is not a physical is not a muscle strain her strain is an inner strength and Barbera me talks over and over about the power that is lying dormant in the church and you know what he says he says it would take this hour this kind of things that are happening around the world to bring up that power that's been lying in the church out of this wine praise the Lord Oh when all the doors are closed and we can't come to church praise the Lord or it's not going to make our Bible to be more dusty that's when we're going to start digging into the word we're going to start reading the word we're going to have all the time to pray and pray and pray for hours and hours praise the Lord I mean if we have to stay home and you can find a strength to reading it's not day praise the Lord but you see in every age and time God have to allow the church to come on as such at time of pressure to be able to bring out that power when Jesus make that declaration all power in heaven and earth is given unto me I believe the disciple Yin just stood there and was looking at him but he just told him few days ago I have to go for the comforter to come I will be with you even in you to the end of the age but here is these people just before the date of Pentecost they were having their owner a Roman plague of fear and what their galley in the upper room deciding whether they will have service online or and Peter one next are we going to do are we going is there going to be service online or how are we going to meet all of these disciples they were hiding right in the upper room praise the Lord what did the Holy Ghost came down for the Holy Ghost came down to activate their healing power that was already invested in them praise the Lord the Holy Ghost came down to be able to quicken the power that was already placing them Jesus never said that at the beginning of his ministry he said that at the end of his ministry and I don't know how much importance is 1/2 if the power was his power and not the power of the church but when I looked through the scripture I see that statement more tied to the church then the physical Ministry of Jesus Christ are we together he says soul is the Church of the Living God that's born again but she warned her way through the granny onto the top of things just waiting for her wings amen for the flight many shall run to and for them people and the people that know their God sure do exploit in that day amen where is that exploit of faith is going to come from it's the word that you've been feeding on that word you've been feeding on it just been hiding down there amen praise the Lord God will have to bring us to a time like this don't look for it in the future it's right here before all this is our day praise the Lord and that is the reason why we have to treat what is happening not carelessly we don't have to get ourselves in all all the theories that are out there in the media and follow all the things that is happening out there we have to see this there's a purpose never in a time that a plague the word has half plagues and plagues in plague I was reading something last night okay I'm left with a few minutes yeah really something last night and it's I mean it's just kind of all you know inspired my mind this report year came out in the early church was no strangers to place epidemic and my sicknesses in fact according to both Christians and also non-christians account one of the main plague or trouble for the church as positive growth in its early years was how Christian navigate diseases suffering and death the church posture made such a strong impression on the Roma society that even pagan Rome Emperor complain to pick and pick a pig and priests about the a declining number telling them to step up the again so what did the Christian do different that shocked the Roman Empire and what can a working the early church teach us in the light of dealing with plague amen according to this report I mean that the the believers I mean I mean the uniting self in prayer to build a faith to be able to deal with the diseases that were India miss and they were getting result in so much that the Roman Empire acts the the pagan priests to go and learn from them what are they doing that it getting result that we are not doing and one of one of the thing that they were able to step up was faith against fear I mean they were able to step up fake an attitude of faith praise the Lord and these people already believe a promise that Jesus said they will lay their hands on the sick and thus it will recover so I mean they were taking care of their loved ones that was sick why the Roman Empire in and their priests was casting their honor loved ones into the street these Christians were taking their loved ones in and they were taking care of them they were praying for them they were giving them the right treatment and the loved ones were recovering do you think about it that sometimes God wait for us to get into our West moment for our best to come out praise the Lord because God do not rely on him on ability he relied in his own hidden strength that he had placed in the believer that if the believer can feel on the Word of God and pray to God and just keep himself another atmosphere of trusting God sometimes in our West moment that's when our best comes out and I believe that's the hour that we are living in praise the Lord it made Oh since let's I mean let's just buckle I was said like Paul tells us in the book of efficient let's put on the armor of God because I'm telling you this is the time you will see the supernatural that you've been waiting for because it's a promise amen it's a promise for Brenham see so many will be running to and for in people the people that know that God would do exploit he says God's revelation to his church says tell little flock positionally stay where you are amen since Janet sister Angie used to sing a song keep holding on and let's just keep singing a song keep holding on him and hold God's unchanging hands praise the Lord Amen he says don't worry God is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to his church amen God is waiting he's trying he's pressing hi is he pressing he's bringing us true base to get to the mystery where is that mr. Christ in you is the hope of glory praise the Lord you think God has kept us out of these years for nothing amen with all the attack against the message and where all the that is happening I mean attack against Christianity and all I mean God has kept this little bribe for the manifestation a demonstration he's trying he's pressing to get at the mystery of God revealed to his church debts that's what hold him back the coming of Christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power there are ready laid dormant in the church this great supernatural strength praise the Lord Amen this great supernatural strength that is laying dormant in the church you know Peter Jesus told Peter something and it was it was powerful very powerful and I think that's what we need we need to apply it especially in this hour you know Peter said Lord you're not only washing my feet you gotta give me a bath amen Jesus said he that has his feet watch don't need his whole body clean amen he's only a tour of watch so I think what the church need is a fourth watch I hate to say it in the hand watch but you know it takes the hand to wash the feet so if you wash the feet you get in the hand wash also praise the Lord amen is that not true it takes the hand to wash the feet you can use feet to wash feet for you to be clean you gotta take hands to wash feet but you know what that is back to the Old Testament Tabernacle it was a type of daily cleansing honor the world I mean so you just think about it if we just take time every day to get a good feed structure of feet watch praise the Lord where we take Eva tot and we take anger and we take and different things we struggle with you know into prayer for God to wash us wash our minds from the filth of this world in all the lives and in all the factories that are out there all those conspiracy theory it's not helping you it's not helping you it's warring against your faith amen you think is helping you if you believe that well there is nothing to this coronavirus it's just a hoax and this it's not helping you it's warring against your faith praise the Lord but if you believe that yeah this is a plague that is taking the word and as a Christian I have a promise that's the only way you will see God's Word fulfilling in your life because if you don't believe that it's real you think that you are living because you are helping you eating the right food and you're washing your hands and all of these things praise the Lord or we have a promise just like we read the sound this morning amen we have a promise that it will not come nigh to us but you know what also my happy do you know the Bible speaks in the book of Revelation that they will not be able to buy or sell and when every word is shut down that we can buy or sell praise the Lord you know the next thing we've been looking for the Raven to bring those bread amen so if everything is shut down and we can't get out and and and I mean and by the cell I mean you know my you know my mule run that I run to brother Scott house man they better Scout me run out we have to find another place to run to praise the Lord so I mean the farming in the days when Elijah came and said no rain no deal it also affected him because the Brooks went dry praise the Lord so just like the brother said we will we will send out information and instruction how to download that app on your phone seven o'clock tonight those that are able to to to to be able to getting we're getting will have a prayer meeting and we have some of our people to talk to us and it's just for us to be able to keep a healthy community around ourselves amen and it's just it just only four we just want to have there for fellowship so we promised that we'd do our best I know you are pulling this morning I can feel it coming from all over this building praise the Lord but we promise that we'll be able to keep you here for the short time and let you go amen praise the Lord brother Branham says question and answer let me read this you read this one I mean so I will not be very unjust to your pool this morning I see you pull him in praise the Lord he says all power in heaven and earth is giving into my hands go and I will go with you whatever you bound on earth I will bind in heaven so actually the power was not for him it was because of you that he made a declaration praise the Lord is because of you he never needed to say that this was a man that said please be still in the wind in the will obey Him this was the man that said no man either beat again and that tree got dragged from the roots are we together so why now he's about to ascend to heaven and he's making that declaration why you never taught this things all along we only have been working I mean we will just ask you you have all power you should have salad from the beginning of your industry we quit our jobs and you just create food we eat you create money we pay our rent but he's saying these things in an hour were the note that he's about to leave him he's seen these things at the end of his ministry what important does it have if it does not belong to the church if this all power does not belong to the church praise the Lord do you see that is the reason why Jesus is bothered on earth which is the church is more powerful than the one sitting at the throne oh and I can be able to affirm the Prophet this morning when he says that I bother sitting on the throne is just mmura it does not have a power or power in heaven and earth I would go with you whatever you bind on earth I will burn in heaven whatever you loose on earth I will loose in heaven oh if the great Holy Church only realize its power to do these things praise the Lord but there is so much doubt and fear and that's all these conspiracy theory we give you doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it will come in happen as long as that as this the church can never stand upright amen and when every talk of feared is vanished and the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power see why they have everything that heaven owns behind it everything that heaven owns that's why he has planed to us that's what I'm an ambassador is analysis since behind its ambassador all his power is behind it they are ambassadors of the trone absolutely an ambassador of Christ has the authority and what is the authority of the church where I was trained in our submission to the world I was submission to the world if we can submit our habits if we can submit our thoughts and we can submit our desire to the world you have to remember better Branham says it's only the bride that we give Christ the preeminence he said gentlemen he will not force himself on you praise the Lord if you get to that place that is what it is the woman has the she has the power but when she submit her power she saw made all her learning in all her strength oh when the man comes out with his suggestion you know let's do this and I as soon as he says him because the way she's made she's finishing what you're talking about she already see you how to get there she knows what would come after me I mean right away she finna getting all the planes in I mean I pretty much be able to take that thing and start running but when the men say no not now let's do it now the ability of the church submitting their ambition the a curiosity to the world not my will but thine he was the same one that just said I'm having 10,000 legions of angels Ikuko but he submitted all of that authority and that was what Jesus saw in that Roman centurion he said I have not seen such a faith for a man was such a power and half men honor his control to submit himself to submit himself for a matter of fact Jesus was not a Roman he was a Roman the Roman government was in control do you know what it would cause him a Pontius Pilate who have heard or Caesar who I heard that he gone down there to meet them as iron and and submitting himself to him you know what I will cause him but when Jesus saw the attitude he said water faith what a faith it's not how we shout it's not how we stream is how much we can come to self-control and submit ourselves to what God's Word says we can break and we can say all we can but when the Word of God requires something and we are still struggling to submit way that's where the problem is with the church that's where the problem is an ambassador for Christ has the authority and everything that Christ own belongs to that ambassador and he said go yet into the word yeah I'm eyewitnesses after the Holy Ghost is come on you and what is the witness it's an ambassador is to come and witness something you have seen it you have seen the reality of Jesus Christ you have seen it you have experienced that you have an evidence that's a witness witness something the whole power of heaven is right in your hands I don't mean then I mean right now their power is lying dormant in you you have the power to overcome your weakness it's lying right in you you just have to identify it and continue submitting it to God for continue submitting it find a promise in God's Word and say Lord your word says I will bring this desire of mine to you the whole power of heaven is right in your hand all what do we say and the church is barren and we sit Domon is because there we don't recognize these things we don't recognize how much power praise the Lord we don't recognize jesus said if two or three I gather together I will be with him praise the Lord amen if we can just bring that with all reference and respect right in our home right in our bedroom and submit to the promise of God's Word he would do what he says this is what is the church bearing but I'm telling you since of God if you have if you have ever been there before if you have ever been you know I mean seven go through difficult times I mean it's when the the Word of God is written all over the place I mean you see God moving in Supernatural way just that consciousness of taking your glass of water in the morning and said dear Lord I blessed this water I drink it to my body as I go out just that consciousness of his presence the church does not recognize it because we wait to come in a building like this before we are conscious of his presence but he said I would be with you even in you so even if we are conscious of his presence will not see some of the things we do say if we are conscious of his presence even when some of those thoughts comes through our mind we were submitted to him by rebuking the devil musicians you can come this morning let's bow our head [Music] all power in heaven and there all power all thank you Jesus [Music] thank you Father thank you lord thank
