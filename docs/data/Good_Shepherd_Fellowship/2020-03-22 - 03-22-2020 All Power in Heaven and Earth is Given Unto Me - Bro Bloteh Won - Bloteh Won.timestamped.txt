[10:10] with my
[10:13] [Music]
[10:36] first cut
[10:43] [Music]
[10:58] well the way things are going so Naomi
[11:04] put together a special assignment for
[11:07] all these Sunday school children and so
[11:10] got a couple of prayer burdens here
[11:12] there's I think I mentioned this before
[11:14] there's a little fellow named Judah down
[11:17] in Texas he's a 7 year old boy his
[11:20] family a Christian family and he's got
[11:24] leukemia and they thought they were
[11:26] gonna be able to do a bone marrow
[11:28] transplant but they're not able to do
[11:30] that
[11:30] and the doctors have basically said
[11:32] tittle told his folks to take him home
[11:34] says there's nothing they can do so but
[11:38] we know that there's one more there's a
[11:41] second opinion that we can get and
[11:43] there's the great physician and we're
[11:46] asking him amen to give his opinion and
[11:50] I think I already read what it was it
[11:52] said Psalm 103 said did not forget his
[11:54] benefits to God that he leads all our
[11:57] diseases but anyway Naomi's got a
[12:00] special mission for the children and the
[12:04] Sunday School she put together a little
[12:06] picture
[12:07] she'll be handing those out for those to
[12:10] the parents of those that are in the
[12:12] sunday-school says urgent prayer needed
[12:15] a little boy named Judah needs some new
[12:17] friends to pray for him he's very sick
[12:20] and it's because he has leukemia the
[12:22] doctors don't know how to help him but
[12:24] doctor Jesus does wouldn't it be
[12:26] wonderful to have him grow up to be a
[12:28] strong man to tell others how jesus
[12:31] healed them we can pray
[12:32] thank you Jesus you can do anything you
[12:35] said that by your stripes we are healed
[12:37] please touch Judy's body so he can be
[12:39] well and run and play like me he's only
[12:42] seven Jesus I know you love him in Jesus
[12:45] name Amen
[12:46] so anyway and then there's a lesson here
[12:48] and I guess this the assignment is to be
[12:53] praying for him and then says can you
[12:56] draw a picture for Judah we will mail it
[12:59] to him to cheer him up make sure you put
[13:02] your name on your picture that won't
[13:03] make him smile so for the families well
[13:07] you can all pray for him you don't have
[13:08] to have little children for that but a
[13:10] few their family can remember him and I
[13:13] think I am the or manager at Unity
[13:17] Hospital where I work been his family
[13:20] knows his family down there in Texas and
[13:24] I told him about the special assignment
[13:26] he said that would really be a blessing
[13:29] Amen so and then also had a chance to
[13:32] meet with an old colleague of mine
[13:34] Victor Martinez he's 60 years old he's
[13:37] got heart problems yeah and he's got
[13:39] this coughing 50s off and on all the
[13:43] time and has a hard time going up the
[13:45] stairs and things and so anyway I got
[13:49] together with him yeah on Friday and so
[13:53] I had a chance to testify to him about
[13:56] the Lord and about dr. Jesus same thing
[13:59] he's good for children he's good for
[14:02] older children too
[14:03] so let's just bow our heads for a
[14:06] special prayer Heavenly Father just want
[14:08] to pray for Judah Lord Jesus she's a
[14:10] seven year old boy
[14:12] Lord you said don't forbid them to come
[14:15] to me but let them come to me and cuz
[14:18] Lord
[14:18] Oh Lord you love children and father we
[14:24] just want to lift up Judah Lord I know
[14:26] his family is a Christian family they're
[14:28] believing Lord Jesus that you're the
[14:30] same yesterday today and forever well
[14:32] then you're a healer today just like you
[14:34] always was we're Lord so father we just
[14:37] want to lift up our Judah
[14:39] shoulder-to-shoulder into your presence
[14:41] Lord asking Lord that
[14:44] that you administer to him Lord and only
[14:47] you the only way you can Lord so father
[14:50] we bless you we praise you we pray for
[14:52] Victor Martinez pray that the words of
[14:54] life that we shared with him would sink
[14:56] down deep Lord and that your Holy Spirit
[14:58] would go to him in his home and speak to
[15:01] him about about you Lord Jesus that he
[15:05] could have salvation that he could have
[15:10] healing in his body to Lord Jesus
[15:13] because you've got a benefit program
[15:15] Lord for your children and so Lord we
[15:18] just commit those two into your hands
[15:21] and an unspoken requests are beyond the
[15:23] Saints hearts today we ask it now and
[15:26] the precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[15:29] and amen
[15:31] you know the musicians were praying back
[15:36] there and I looked at brother Lawrence
[15:39] and said of the Lawrence I says I know
[15:42] why you want to be silly songs today
[15:44] says you want to sing Jesus holds my
[15:48] hand while you have the chance amen
[15:52] Naomi says well you know we're in this
[15:54] period we're not supposed to be shaking
[15:56] hands and we're supposed to you know be
[15:58] six feet apart and stuff like that and
[16:00] she said well that's one hand that we
[16:02] can take a hold of is a man Jesus we
[16:04] don't have to worry about his germs in
[16:06] fact I'd like to get a few more feels so
[16:08] a man so but the Lord's I think we ought
[16:11] to do that I think we ought to sing that

[16:18] [Music]
[16:25] yes before we go to the song can we

[18:02] thou dash thy foot against a stone
[18:05] thou shall tread upon the lion and
[18:07] ardour and the long lion and the dragon
[18:10] shall trample on the feet because he has

[33:44] [Music]
[33:57] amen Raisa Lord Allah bless you you can
[34:05] help you see amen amen amen
[34:10] we have a little information for you
[34:13] brother Jordan will bring that to you
[34:15] before we bring a word of agitation
[34:18] [Music]
[34:28] good morning Saints god bless you you
[34:31] know with trying times we're have a lot
[34:34] of changes coming up when you're trying
[34:35] to stay ahead of the changes here we're
[34:38] already of course streaming online but
[34:41] as a group we know if as this thing goes
[34:43] on we're probably gonna get to get to
[34:45] the point very quickly where we're not
[34:47] even gathering in the small number where
[34:48] we are this morning probably the next
[34:51] move will be to the point where we'll
[34:52] have brother one maybe a musician a song
[34:56] leader at best and then the technicians
[34:58] to help run it and then we'll be
[34:59] streaming we still want to maintain some
[35:03] sense of community so we've already
[35:05] started looking at what we can do to do
[35:06] that we I don't know how many of you
[35:08] have used it but there's a conferencing
[35:12] program online it's called zoom I don't
[35:16] know how many of you heard of it or have
[35:18] used it it's fairly simple to use and
[35:20] what we're gonna be doing is both using
[35:23] that for meeting and for we're looking
[35:26] towards even using that as response and
[35:29] involvement even in the service that can
[35:32] be both used by Internet service or
[35:35] there's actually the ability we've
[35:37] actually purchased the ability to use it
[35:39] as teleconference so if you do not have
[35:42] internet service or a phone that will
[35:43] use that we will be able get you a
[35:44] number we still are testing that out
[35:47] we're gonna get that tested out here the
[35:48] next day or two here fairly quickly and
[35:51] we will be able to probably avoid you a
[35:53] number or you can actually call into the
[35:55] service so if you don't have internet
[35:56] service or you don't have a smart phone
[35:58] that you can access the YouTube to
[36:01] follow the service we will be able to
[36:03] get you a number or you can you at least
[36:04] tell a conference in to the service and
[36:05] listen and participate we want to use
[36:08] that possibly going forward not only for
[36:11] being a part other services listen to
[36:13] the service but also as we're listening
[36:17] to the service you can then respond to
[36:18] the service hopefully we'll see how it
[36:20] works out there's a very slight few
[36:22] seconds of delay in response but we may
[36:24] even be able to use that for some form
[36:26] of song service we can use that like we
[36:29] do involving people in in praying for
[36:32] the service for prayer meeting or even
[36:34] if family
[36:35] at their location want to have some type
[36:37] of song special they would let you be
[36:39] able to do that they we have tested it
[36:41] from an Internet perspective on video
[36:44] conference we tested yesterday and we
[36:46] can actually bring you in over these
[36:47] speakers so anybody can be heard to
[36:50] anybody that's here and we can actually
[36:52] if you have a song special or we have
[36:54] you pray for the service or something
[36:56] like that it we can actually blend you
[36:58] into the audio going out into the live
[36:59] stream so that way we can still maintain
[37:03] some form of community and connection so
[37:06] we will be sending out additional
[37:08] information one two things that we're
[37:11] gonna be asking for we had originally
[37:13] you know just for informational updates
[37:15] handed out those pieces of paper for
[37:17] everyone to turn in to us we got about
[37:19] nine of them so what we're gonna ask is
[37:22] the email for the church is on the
[37:24] church website if you can't access that
[37:27] then use the if you've getting the group
[37:30] text that everyone's been getting I'll
[37:32] send the church email out on there and
[37:34] we would like to get an email back with
[37:37] your name an active email address and an
[37:41] active telephone number um if you have a
[37:44] cell number that can receive text and
[37:46] what we're gonna do
[37:48] and if you have a number that you would
[37:50] be teleconferencing and if you need to
[37:52] teleconference if you can involve that
[37:54] one and just in the email differentiate
[37:57] which one is the cell number and which
[37:58] one is Allah if it's a landline so we
[38:01] don't send Texas to that landline that
[38:04] way we can actually plug you into the
[38:06] address book that we have on the zoom

[40:39] from all the all the theories that are
[40:43] out there you know and all the different
[40:45] things we have to keep keep I mean the
[40:47] greatest battle in this thing is the
[40:50] thing that goes through the people mind
[40:52] you know I mean the way that this thing
[40:55] has affected the entire world the
[40:58] disease is there is killing people but
[41:01] the fear
[41:02] the more daily thing you know like I
[41:05] told somebody yesterday brought Brooks
[41:07] and myself was talking I said but bros
[41:09] even if the angel of the Lord goes over
[41:11] the earth and sees that disease people
[41:14] would still die because they're afraid
[41:17] the fear is the greatest plague that is
[41:20] on it on the human mind so we just you

[43:58] 28 Matthew chapter 28 I will take one
[44:04] verse this morning Matthew chapter 28
[44:18] Matthew chapter 28 verse 18 Matthew
[44:24] chapter 28 verse 18 the scripture says
[44:29] and Jesus came and speak unto them
[44:32] saying all power is given unto me in
[44:36] heaven and in earth
[44:41] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[44:43] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[44:46] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
[44:48] teaching them to observe all things
[44:50] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[44:53] am with you always even unto the end of
[44:59] the world
[45:00] Amen father bless the portion of your
[45:03] word that we have read we love you and
[45:05] we appreciate you Father in Jesus name
[45:08] we pray amen
[45:10] the Lord bless you you can have your
[45:12] seat I want to correct or go over not
[45:17] correct but I want to go over something
[45:19] I know the past services lasts on the
[45:26] Wednesday I kind of made the same
[45:28] statement again and it's almost like
[45:32] when I made and when I made those
[45:34] statements it's I mean it's you know
[45:38] with with my spirit connection to your
[45:41] spirit it looks like it's not being
[45:45] digested well amen so I said I will go
[45:49] over it this morning a little bit you
[45:51] know I talking about co-equal and
[45:53] talking about creation and in God you
[45:58] know breaking the man and bringing a
[46:00] woman out whole I used the statement
[46:02] that a woman is stronger than the man
[46:04] and and that it is that statement that I
[46:08] see that I see that I see both the both
[46:11] the sisters and the brothers struggle
[46:13] with that in your mind the sister saying
[46:15] how am i stronger than my husband the
[46:17] brother is saying don't tell me my wife
[46:19] is stronger than me
[46:20] [Laughter]
[46:22] praise the Lord amen but you think about
[46:26] it
[46:27] think about it here this morning Jesus
[46:30] do you do you do you think that Jesus
[46:33] didn't know this statement that he made
[46:36] all power in heaven and earth is given
[46:38] unto me do you think that he just found
[46:42] out that morning or he just realized
[46:48] that whoa now I know all power in heaven
[46:51] and earth is given to me I believe with
[46:56] all of my heart he knew right from the
[46:58] beginning but why did he make that
[47:02] statement this was one of his last few
[47:07] words before he left the earth he never
[47:12] made that statement because of himself
[47:14] he made that statement because of the
[47:17] church are we together amen because if
[47:26] all power in heaven is given unto him
[47:29] and he's going to go away what is the
[47:32] use of the all power
[47:35] what is the use of the all power making
[47:39] that declaration and he will not be here
[47:41] what is the need but he's the same one
[47:43] that says I would be with you even in
[47:46] you so he's telling the church this our
[47:48] power I've been a medium when I was here
[47:51] you need it not only that you needed you
[47:56] have it now so you believe that the
[48:03] woman is stronger than the man it's in
[48:09] an amen
[48:11] oh what a way to bring the people to a
[48:15] surrounding I knew I was trapping you
[48:22] into something I was saying it so I was
[48:23] not looking at your physics every time I
[48:26] say there are locust of people what is
[48:29] he going with this it came just tell us
[48:33] what the tape says and forget about all
[48:35] of those things
[48:37] praise the Lord but we want to go
[48:41] through few things this morning quickly
[48:43] because we don't have time just laying
[48:46] their foundation will get to the place
[48:48] he is Becky I sent you two different set
[48:51] of codes so I might be going back and
[48:53] forth and and if you don't have it
[48:55] that's okay we will have all of these
[48:57] things and we can post them on the
[48:58] website
[48:59] praise the Lord Amen now I will start
[49:04] from this one a little bit here endtime
[49:13] evangelism bar Branham says he says
[49:15] there will be plenty of time distress
[49:19] between nation the sea rolling mains
[49:23] filling of heart trouble constantly not
[49:29] among the women now is among the man
[49:33] jesus never said the women he said men
[49:39] look at the plague and in that day that
[49:46] who come to pass there will be the
[49:51] endtime science had feeling fear the
[49:55] flesh are we together sign of the time
[50:00] man had fell in more heart diseases what
[50:04] the that's not women men
[50:07] he never said women had he says he says
[50:12] mmm women had men had all signs and
[50:17] insurance company says is ninety percent
[50:21] men we say in signs
[50:24] an insurance company amen so he's
[50:29] telling us look into the data of medical
[50:32] science don't despise it
[50:35] are we together and something I pick up
[50:43] something I pick up on the health report
[50:47] it says here women tend to have more
[50:55] youthful brain than their male
[50:59] counterpart at least when it comes to I
[51:07] don't know I thought of mine out of my
[51:10] nose never came true well you have it
[51:20] and I don't have it
[51:26] now I was just trying to put these
[51:28] things together quickly and I'm kind of
[51:33] a trilling on the ground years to bring
[51:36] a balance to what what we we trying to
[51:39] to bring to you year but it's for the
[51:42] fact that brother branham make us to say
[51:45] that they're all science and insurance
[51:47] companies is you know and pointing us to
[51:50] be able to look at the reports that are
[51:52] out there it will tell you praise the
[51:55] Lord
[51:55] now you just looking you know when and
[51:59] with with the with the life bearing
[52:02] process that God gave the woman you know
[52:05] that's right on a heart you know and in
[52:10] all the things that she goes through the
[52:12] change of life in everything and he's
[52:15] still placing it to the place on Jesus
[52:18] prophecy that the worse is man hat with
[52:21] fearful fear so the the woman strain is
[52:24] an inner strength now you take that and
[52:28] and post on it a little bit you will see
[52:31] what I'm coming to house-train is a
[52:33] strain that is lying
[52:35] Domon
[52:37] the word shows the Word of God shows
[52:42] that she's a weaker vessel praise the
[52:45] Lord
[52:46] but a chain is only strong it is
[52:51] weakling
[52:52] praise the Lord now this strength is the
[52:58] ability to submit to the word not only
[53:02] the woman as a female but even the
[53:05] church as a woman the strength is to
[53:11] submit to the word
[53:15] let me read another one year that that
[53:18] you appreciate he was to pass this way
[53:21] he says so a good brain wife or mother
[53:26] can do more for the kingdom of God on
[53:30] her knees at home then sometimes the
[53:36] preacher can do on the platform a good
[53:43] praying woman wife at him can do more
[53:48] for the kingdom of God when there when
[53:54] when when a woman find her place when
[54:00] the church find her place the rapture we
[54:04] go that's what he said
[54:10] praise the Lord
[54:12] so when I'm making this tibia I'm not
[54:14] running after the woman as a person I'm
[54:16] after the church but I have to bring it
[54:19] this way just to be able to grab your
[54:22] curiosity now see some of the things
[54:25] that we want to look at here revelation
[54:27] the book of symbol and God in the last
[54:31] date is going to draw true hearts from
[54:35] every way no matter how much counterfeit
[54:38] and chop the devil has God will raise
[54:41] his church right out of it it would be a
[54:46] sealing for sure as I'm standing in this
[54:51] platform and the hour is at him they
[54:55] call and former winning a wedding but in
[55:00] Vangelis recall and all the shoosh work
[55:02] gospel and all of these things are gone
[55:04] and the fantastic side is growing in
[55:11] such a radical fanatism tell anybody
[55:17] blind can see it that's what is
[55:19] happening there in the world but God is
[55:22] pulling his church out amen he says just
[55:28] like the lady the flower little tiny
[55:33] seeds borne away there in the mud and
[55:37] the dirt and all of those things and
[55:39] it's Wayne is way up through the mud
[55:41] through all the mud and and all the scum
[55:46] and become the finest thing that ever
[55:49] that that you ever look into the face of
[55:55] he says so is the Church of the Living
[55:57] God that's being born down through the
[56:01] mud of fanaticism and chaos you think
[56:06] about the fanatism that has run around
[56:09] this message we have had two souls we
[56:13] have had seven thunders we have had I
[56:16] mean different forms of finality that
[56:19] has run I mean II have wrong people
[56:21] millennial doctrine and different things
[56:24] have come up and gone but the Church of
[56:27] Jesus Christ that woman is still
[56:31] standing strong praise the Lord why
[56:39] because her strength is not in
[56:42] weightlifting is not a physical is not a
[56:45] muscle strain her strain is an inner
[56:47] strength and Barbera me talks over and
[56:50] over about the power that is lying
[56:53] dormant in the church and you know what
[56:57] he says he says it would take this hour
[57:01] this kind of things that are happening
[57:03] around the world
[57:04] to bring up that power that's been lying
[57:08] in the church out of this wine praise
[57:12] the Lord
[57:13] Oh when all the doors are closed and we
[57:15] can't come to church praise the Lord or
[57:18] it's not going to make our Bible to be
[57:21] more dusty that's when we're going to
[57:23] start digging into the word we're going
[57:25] to start reading the word we're going to
[57:27] have all the time to pray and pray and
[57:30] pray for hours and hours
[57:34] praise the Lord I mean if we have to
[57:39] stay home and you can find a strength to
[57:42] reading it's not day praise the Lord
[57:48] but you see in every age and time God
[57:51] have to allow the church to come on as
[57:54] such at time of pressure to be able to
[57:58] bring out that power when Jesus make
[58:02] that declaration all power in heaven and
[58:05] earth is given unto me I believe the
[58:07] disciple Yin just stood there and was
[58:10] looking at him but he just told him few
[58:13] days ago I have to go for the comforter
[58:15] to come I will be with you even in you
[58:22] to the end of the age but here is these
[58:27] people just before the date of Pentecost
[58:30] they were having their owner a Roman
[58:34] plague of fear and what their galley in
[58:37] the upper room deciding whether they
[58:39] will have service online or and Peter
[58:42] one next are we going to do are we going
[58:44] is there going to be service online or
[58:46] how are we going to meet all of these
[58:48] disciples they were hiding right in the
[58:51] upper room praise the Lord
[58:57] what did the Holy Ghost came down for
[58:59] the Holy Ghost came down to activate
[59:02] their healing power
[59:05] that was already invested in them praise
[59:11] the Lord
[59:12] the Holy Ghost came down to be able to
[59:15] quicken the power that was already
[59:19] placing them Jesus never said that at
[59:23] the beginning of his ministry he said
[59:25] that at the end of his ministry and I
[59:28] don't know how much importance is 1/2 if
[59:31] the power was his power and not the
[59:33] power of the church but when I looked
[59:35] through the scripture I see that
[59:37] statement more tied to the church then
[59:39] the physical Ministry of Jesus Christ
[59:44] are we together
[59:48] he says soul is the Church of the Living
[59:51] God that's born again but she warned her
[1:00:00] way through the granny onto the top of
[1:00:02] things just waiting for her wings amen
[1:00:08] for the flight many shall run to and for
[1:00:13] them people and the people that know
[1:00:15] their God sure do exploit in that day
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:24] where is that exploit of faith is going
[1:00:27] to come from it's the word that you've
[1:00:30] been feeding on that word you've been
[1:00:34] feeding on it just been hiding down
[1:00:36] there amen praise the Lord God will have
[1:00:40] to bring us to a time like this don't
[1:00:42] look for it in the future it's right
[1:00:44] here before all this is our day praise
[1:00:52] the Lord and that is the reason why we
[1:00:59] have to treat what is happening not
[1:01:05] carelessly we don't have to get
[1:01:08] ourselves in all all the theories that
[1:01:11] are out there in the media and follow
[1:01:15] all the things that is happening out
[1:01:18] there
[1:01:19] we have to see this there's a purpose
[1:01:22] never in a time that a plague the word
[1:01:26] has half plagues and plagues in plague I
[1:01:29] was reading something last night
[1:01:34] okay I'm left with a few minutes yeah
[1:01:36] really something last night and it's I
[1:01:39] mean it's just kind of all you know
[1:01:47] inspired my mind this report year came
[1:01:58] out in the early church was no strangers
[1:02:04] to place epidemic and my sicknesses in
[1:02:12] fact according to both Christians and
[1:02:15] also non-christians account
[1:02:18] one of the main plague or trouble for
[1:02:24] the church as positive growth in its
[1:02:27] early years was how Christian navigate
[1:02:32] diseases suffering and death the church
[1:02:37] posture made such a strong impression on
[1:02:41] the Roma society that even pagan Rome
[1:02:45] Emperor complain to pick and pick a pig
[1:02:50] and priests about the a declining number
[1:02:54] telling them to step up the again so
[1:02:59] what did the Christian do different that
[1:03:01] shocked the Roman Empire and what can a
[1:03:06] working the early church teach us in the
[1:03:11] light of dealing with plague amen
[1:03:17] according to this report I mean that the
[1:03:20] the believers I mean I mean the uniting
[1:03:25] self in prayer to build a faith to be
[1:03:30] able to deal with
[1:03:32] the diseases that were India miss and
[1:03:35] they were getting result in so much that
[1:03:38] the Roman Empire acts the the pagan
[1:03:43] priests to go and learn from them what
[1:03:45] are they doing that it getting result
[1:03:47] that we are not doing and one of one of
[1:03:54] the thing that they were able to step up
[1:03:57] was faith against fear I mean they were
[1:04:04] able to step up fake an attitude of
[1:04:07] faith praise the Lord
[1:04:15] and these people already believe a
[1:04:18] promise that Jesus said they will lay
[1:04:20] their hands on the sick and thus it will
[1:04:22] recover so I mean they were taking care
[1:04:24] of their loved ones that was sick why
[1:04:27] the Roman Empire in and their priests
[1:04:30] was casting their honor loved ones into
[1:04:32] the street
[1:04:33] these Christians were taking their loved
[1:04:35] ones in and they were taking care of
[1:04:37] them they were praying for them they
[1:04:39] were giving them the right treatment and
[1:04:41] the loved ones were recovering
[1:04:52] do you think about it that sometimes God
[1:04:56] wait for us to get into our West moment
[1:05:00] for our best to come out praise the Lord
[1:05:04] because God do not rely on him on
[1:05:07] ability he relied in his own hidden
[1:05:12] strength that he had placed in the
[1:05:15] believer that if the believer can feel
[1:05:18] on the Word of God and pray to God and
[1:05:20] just keep himself another atmosphere of
[1:05:23] trusting God
[1:05:25] sometimes in our West moment that's when
[1:05:28] our best comes out and I believe that's
[1:05:31] the hour that we are living in praise
[1:05:34] the Lord
[1:05:35] it made Oh since let's I mean let's just
[1:05:39] buckle I was said like Paul tells us in
[1:05:41] the book of efficient let's put on the
[1:05:44] armor of God because I'm telling you
[1:05:46] this is the time you will see the
[1:05:47] supernatural that you've been waiting
[1:05:50] for because it's a promise
[1:05:52] amen it's a promise for Brenham see so
[1:05:56] many will be running to and for in
[1:05:58] people the people that know that God
[1:06:00] would do exploit he says God's
[1:06:02] revelation to his church says tell
[1:06:05] little flock positionally stay where you
[1:06:10] are
[1:06:11] amen since Janet sister Angie
[1:06:15] used to sing a song keep holding on and
[1:06:17] let's just keep singing a song keep
[1:06:19] holding on him and hold God's unchanging
[1:06:22] hands praise the Lord Amen he says don't
[1:06:25] worry God is waiting and trying and
[1:06:29] pressing to get at the mystery of God
[1:06:35] revealed to his church amen
[1:06:38] God is waiting he's trying he's pressing
[1:06:42] hi is he pressing he's bringing us true
[1:06:44] base to get to the mystery where is that
[1:06:47] mr. Christ in you is the hope of glory
[1:06:55] praise the Lord you think God has kept
[1:06:58] us out of these years for nothing
[1:07:01] amen with all the attack against the
[1:07:05] message and where all the
[1:07:06] that is happening I mean attack against
[1:07:09] Christianity and all I mean God has kept
[1:07:12] this little bribe for the manifestation
[1:07:15] a demonstration he's trying he's
[1:07:19] pressing to get at the mystery of God
[1:07:22] revealed to his church debts that's what
[1:07:26] hold him back
[1:07:27] the coming of Christ now and the great
[1:07:31] millennium is this great supernatural
[1:07:35] power there are ready laid dormant in
[1:07:40] the church this great supernatural
[1:07:44] strength praise the Lord Amen this great
[1:07:50] supernatural strength that is laying
[1:07:53] dormant in the church you know Peter
[1:07:56] Jesus told Peter something and it was it
[1:08:00] was powerful very powerful and I think
[1:08:03] that's what we need we need to apply it
[1:08:06] especially in this hour you know Peter
[1:08:10] said Lord you're not only washing my
[1:08:12] feet you gotta give me a bath amen
[1:08:21] Jesus said he that has his feet watch
[1:08:25] don't need his whole body clean amen
[1:08:29] he's only a tour of watch so I think
[1:08:34] what the church need is a fourth watch I
[1:08:37] hate to say it in the hand watch but you
[1:08:40] know it takes the hand to wash the feet
[1:08:42] so if you wash the feet you get in the
[1:08:44] hand wash also praise the Lord amen
[1:08:50] is that not true it takes the hand to
[1:08:52] wash the feet you can use feet to wash
[1:08:54] feet for you to be clean you gotta take
[1:08:57] hands to wash feet but you know what
[1:08:59] that is back to the Old Testament
[1:09:00] Tabernacle it was a type of daily
[1:09:05] cleansing honor the world
[1:09:07] I mean so you just think about it if we
[1:09:12] just take time every day to get a good
[1:09:15] feed structure of feet watch praise the
[1:09:20] Lord
[1:09:21] where we take Eva tot and we take anger
[1:09:25] and we take and different things we
[1:09:28] struggle with you know into prayer for
[1:09:33] God to wash us wash our minds from the
[1:09:40] filth of this world in all the lives and
[1:09:43] in all the factories that are out there
[1:09:46] all those conspiracy theory it's not
[1:09:49] helping you it's not helping you it's
[1:09:52] warring against your faith amen
[1:09:56] you think is helping you if you believe
[1:09:58] that well there is nothing to this
[1:10:00] coronavirus it's just a hoax and this
[1:10:02] it's not helping you
[1:10:04] it's warring against your faith praise
[1:10:08] the Lord
[1:10:09] but if you believe that yeah this is a
[1:10:11] plague that is taking the word and as a
[1:10:13] Christian I have a promise that's the
[1:10:16] only way you will see God's Word
[1:10:18] fulfilling in your life because if you
[1:10:22] don't believe that it's real you think
[1:10:24] that you are living because you are
[1:10:25] helping you eating the right food and
[1:10:27] you're washing your hands and all of
[1:10:29] these things praise the Lord
[1:10:37] or we have a promise just like we read
[1:10:40] the sound this morning
[1:10:42] amen we have a promise that it will not
[1:10:46] come nigh to us but you know what also
[1:10:50] my happy do you know the Bible speaks in
[1:10:54] the book of Revelation that they will
[1:10:56] not be able to buy or sell and when
[1:11:02] every word is shut down that we can buy
[1:11:04] or sell praise the Lord you know the
[1:11:08] next thing we've been looking for the
[1:11:09] Raven to bring those bread
[1:11:14] amen so if everything is shut down and
[1:11:20] we can't get out and and and I mean and
[1:11:23] by the cell I mean you know my you know
[1:11:27] my mule run that I run to brother Scott
[1:11:29] house man they better Scout me run out
[1:11:31] we have to find another place to run to
[1:11:35] praise the Lord
[1:11:39] so I mean the farming in the days when
[1:11:43] Elijah came and said no rain no deal
[1:11:46] it also affected him because the Brooks
[1:11:49] went dry
[1:12:00] praise the Lord so just like the brother
[1:12:05] said we will we will send out
[1:12:07] information and instruction how to
[1:12:10] download that app on your phone seven
[1:12:14] o'clock tonight those that are able to
[1:12:16] to to to be able to getting we're
[1:12:20] getting will have a prayer meeting and
[1:12:22] we have some of our people to talk to us
[1:12:27] and it's just for us to be able to keep
[1:12:29] a healthy community around ourselves
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:32] and it's just it just only four we just
[1:12:37] want to have there for fellowship so we
[1:12:41] promised that we'd do our best
[1:12:42] I know you are pulling this morning I
[1:12:45] can feel it coming from all over this
[1:12:47] building
[1:12:49] praise the Lord but we promise that
[1:12:52] we'll be able to keep you here for the
[1:12:53] short time and let you go amen praise
[1:12:56] the Lord brother Branham says question
[1:12:57] and answer let me read this you read
[1:12:59] this one I mean so I will not be very
[1:13:03] unjust to your pool this morning I see
[1:13:05] you pull him in praise the Lord he says
[1:13:08] all power in heaven and earth is giving
[1:13:11] into my hands go and I will go with you
[1:13:17] whatever you bound on earth I will bind
[1:13:22] in heaven so actually the power was not
[1:13:24] for him it was because of you that he
[1:13:27] made a declaration praise the Lord
[1:13:31] is because of you he never needed to say
[1:13:38] that this was a man that said please be
[1:13:41] still in the wind in the will obey Him
[1:13:43] this was the man that said no man either
[1:13:46] beat again and that tree got dragged
[1:13:49] from the roots are we together so why
[1:13:56] now he's about to ascend to heaven and
[1:13:59] he's making that declaration why you
[1:14:02] never taught this things all along we
[1:14:05] only have been working I mean we will
[1:14:08] just ask you you have all power
[1:14:12] you should have salad from the beginning
[1:14:14] of your
[1:14:14] industry we quit our jobs and you just
[1:14:19] create food we eat you create money we
[1:14:22] pay our rent but he's saying these
[1:14:25] things in an hour were the note that
[1:14:29] he's about to leave him he's seen these
[1:14:34] things at the end of his ministry what
[1:14:37] important does it have if it does not
[1:14:39] belong to the church if this all power
[1:14:44] does not belong to the church praise the
[1:14:51] Lord
[1:14:51] do you see that is the reason why Jesus
[1:14:54] is bothered on earth which is the church
[1:14:58] is more powerful than the one sitting at
[1:15:01] the throne oh and I can be able to
[1:15:08] affirm the Prophet this morning when he
[1:15:10] says that I bother sitting on the throne
[1:15:12] is just mmura it does not have a power
[1:15:15] or power in heaven and earth
[1:15:28] I would go with you whatever you bind on
[1:15:30] earth I will burn in heaven whatever you
[1:15:32] loose on earth I will loose in heaven
[1:15:35] oh if the great Holy Church only realize
[1:15:39] its power to do these things
[1:15:44] praise the Lord but there is so much
[1:15:50] doubt and fear and that's all these
[1:15:53] conspiracy theory we give you doubt and
[1:15:55] fear and trembling wondering if it will
[1:16:04] come in happen as long as that as this
[1:16:09] the church can never stand upright amen
[1:16:19] and when every talk of feared is
[1:16:24] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:16:27] completely in control of the church then
[1:16:31] all fears are gone and that church has
[1:16:36] the power see why they have everything
[1:16:41] that heaven owns behind it
[1:16:45] everything that heaven owns that's why
[1:16:48] he has planed to us that's what I'm an
[1:16:50] ambassador is analysis since behind its
[1:16:56] ambassador all his power is behind it
[1:16:59] they are ambassadors of the trone
[1:17:01] absolutely an ambassador of Christ has
[1:17:04] the authority and what is the authority
[1:17:09] of the church where I was trained in our
[1:17:11] submission to the world
[1:17:12] I was submission to the world if we can
[1:17:17] submit our habits if we can submit our
[1:17:19] thoughts and we can submit our desire to
[1:17:22] the world you have to remember better
[1:17:24] Branham says it's only the bride that we
[1:17:28] give Christ the preeminence he said
[1:17:31] gentlemen he will not force himself on
[1:17:33] you praise the Lord
[1:17:35] if you get to that place that is what it
[1:17:38] is
[1:17:39] the woman has the
[1:17:41] she has the power but when she submit
[1:17:46] her power she saw made all her learning
[1:17:49] in all her strength oh when the man
[1:17:53] comes out with his suggestion you know
[1:17:55] let's do this and I as soon as he says
[1:18:01] him because the way she's made she's
[1:18:05] finishing what you're talking about she
[1:18:06] already see you how to get there
[1:18:08] she knows what would come after me I
[1:18:10] mean right away she finna getting all
[1:18:12] the planes in I mean I pretty much be
[1:18:14] able to take that thing and start
[1:18:15] running but when the men say no not now
[1:18:17] let's do it now the ability of the
[1:18:21] church submitting their ambition the a
[1:18:25] curiosity to the world not my will but
[1:18:34] thine he was the same one that just said
[1:18:40] I'm having 10,000 legions of angels
[1:18:43] Ikuko but he submitted all of that
[1:18:49] authority and that was what Jesus saw in
[1:18:53] that Roman centurion he said I have not
[1:18:57] seen such a faith for a man was such a
[1:19:01] power and half men honor his control to
[1:19:06] submit himself to submit himself for a
[1:19:12] matter of fact Jesus was not a Roman he
[1:19:14] was a Roman the Roman government was in
[1:19:16] control do you know what it would cause
[1:19:19] him a Pontius Pilate who have heard or
[1:19:22] Caesar who I heard that he gone down
[1:19:24] there to meet them as iron and and
[1:19:27] submitting himself to him you know what
[1:19:30] I will cause him but when Jesus saw the
[1:19:36] attitude he said water faith what a
[1:19:41] faith it's not how we shout it's not how
[1:19:45] we stream is how much we can come to
[1:19:48] self-control and submit ourselves to
[1:19:52] what God's Word says
[1:19:56] we can break and we can say all we can
[1:19:59] but when the Word of God requires
[1:20:02] something and we are still struggling to
[1:20:04] submit way that's where the problem is
[1:20:10] with the church that's where the problem
[1:20:13] is an ambassador for Christ has the
[1:20:16] authority and everything that Christ own
[1:20:19] belongs to that ambassador and he said
[1:20:22] go yet into the word
[1:20:24] yeah I'm eyewitnesses after the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost is come on you and what is the
[1:20:30] witness
[1:20:31] it's an ambassador is to come and
[1:20:34] witness something you have seen it you
[1:20:37] have seen the reality of Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] you have seen it you have experienced
[1:20:43] that you have an evidence that's a
[1:20:45] witness witness something the whole
[1:20:48] power of heaven is right in your hands I
[1:20:53] don't mean then I mean right now their
[1:20:57] power is lying dormant in you you have
[1:21:00] the power to overcome your weakness it's
[1:21:03] lying right in you you just have to
[1:21:10] identify it and continue submitting it
[1:21:15] to God for continue submitting it find a
[1:21:19] promise in God's Word and say Lord your
[1:21:21] word says I will bring this desire of
[1:21:24] mine to you the whole power of heaven is
[1:21:29] right in your hand all what do we say
[1:21:32] and the church is barren and we sit
[1:21:37] Domon is because there we don't
[1:21:40] recognize these things we don't
[1:21:43] recognize how much power praise the Lord
[1:21:50] we don't recognize jesus said if two or
[1:21:57] three I gather together I will be with
[1:22:00] him praise the Lord
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:06] if we can just bring that with all
[1:22:09] reference and respect
[1:22:11] right in our home right in our bedroom
[1:22:14] and submit to the promise of God's Word
[1:22:20] he would do what he says
[1:22:33] this is what is the church bearing but
[1:22:37] I'm telling you since of God if you have
[1:22:41] if you have ever been there before if
[1:22:42] you have ever been you know I mean seven
[1:22:46] go through difficult times
[1:22:48] I mean it's when the the Word of God is
[1:22:52] written all over the place I mean you
[1:22:54] see God moving in Supernatural way just
[1:23:01] that consciousness of taking your glass
[1:23:03] of water in the morning and said dear
[1:23:06] Lord I blessed this water I drink it to
[1:23:08] my body as I go out just that
[1:23:11] consciousness of his presence the church
[1:23:14] does not recognize it because we wait to
[1:23:20] come in a building like this before we
[1:23:21] are conscious of his presence but he
[1:23:24] said I would be with you even in you so
[1:23:31] even if we are conscious of his presence
[1:23:33] will not see some of the things we do
[1:23:35] say if we are conscious of his presence
[1:23:39] even when some of those thoughts comes
[1:23:41] through our mind we were submitted to
[1:23:43] him by rebuking the devil musicians you
