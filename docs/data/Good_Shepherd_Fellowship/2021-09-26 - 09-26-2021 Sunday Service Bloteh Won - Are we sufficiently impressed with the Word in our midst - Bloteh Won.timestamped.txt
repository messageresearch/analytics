[1:01:32] least at any time
[1:01:35] we should let them sleep

[1:02:07] most endless heed to the things which we
[1:02:10] have heard least at any time we should

[1:02:39] which are the beginning was spoken by
[1:02:42] the lord

[1:02:52] god also bearing them witness both with
[1:02:54] signs and wonders

[1:04:08] lord jesus and for your glory father god
[1:04:11] my spirit and the entire spirit of the
[1:04:13] congregation even those laws that are

[1:04:18] into your hands and asked that you deal
[1:04:20] with us this morning god the words of
[1:04:23] internal value being spoken oh god lord
[1:04:26] we love you we appreciate you this
[1:04:28] morning
[1:04:29] what a father you are
[1:04:31] in jesus name we pray
[1:04:34] amen amen
[1:04:36] amen the lord bless you you may have
[1:04:37] your seed
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:41] and wednesday night we were talking on
[1:04:43] appreciating the love of god
[1:04:45] and uh uh
[1:04:48] and then we we
[1:04:50] you know the holy spirit helped us to be
[1:04:52] able to pick up uh one spirit of the age
[1:04:55] you know that
[1:04:57] makes people to disappreciate the word
[1:04:59] of god which is the spirit of people
[1:05:01] seeking pity from the lord
[1:05:04] amen
[1:05:05] and what i was uh uh looking at that
[1:05:08] taught
[1:05:09] i realized that there was something i
[1:05:12] was i was also studying
[1:05:14] months back you know when uh
[1:05:17] brother johnny a couple of months ago he
[1:05:20] he gave a testimony you know then out of
[1:05:23] how the lord helped him with different
[1:05:25] things he was dealing with and then he
[1:05:27] make an expression and talking about
[1:05:29] mental health so mental health is a
[1:05:31] problem and i thought that i would speak
[1:05:34] a little bit
[1:05:35] on because that was one of the diagnosis
[1:05:38] of the laodicean age
[1:05:40] is no wonder that we have in the mental
[1:05:42] health issue because this age itself has
[1:05:44] a mental problem
[1:05:46] that is the spirit of the age
[1:05:49] and i'm telling you this morning until
[1:05:51] we have the mind of christ we all will
[1:05:54] run crazy
[1:05:55] you have some decent crazy people that
[1:05:58] were necktie now all crazy men strip
[1:06:01] themselves naked
[1:06:04] praise the lord now every crazy man
[1:06:06] stripped himself naked
[1:06:08] you have some decent crazy people
[1:06:12] very eloquent
[1:06:14] but they have lost it up here
[1:06:19] until we get a man of christ you will
[1:06:21] run crazy
[1:06:23] the demons the devil in this age will
[1:06:26] run you crazy
[1:06:34] we were right all our fancy cars being
[1:06:37] crazy
[1:06:39] that's why we have all the raw rages
[1:06:42] on the street and people shooting and
[1:06:44] all of that do you think those are
[1:06:46] normal people
[1:06:49] that a man will shoot a shoot a card and
[1:06:52] and and and take a little bit a little
[1:06:54] innocent baby life you think those are
[1:06:56] the people that are in their right mind
[1:06:59] come on brother preach it and until we
[1:07:01] have the mind of christ i said we will
[1:07:03] all run crazy
[1:07:07] the only thing that will save you from
[1:07:09] losing your mind in this age is to have
[1:07:11] the man of
[1:07:12] christ which cursed by the baptising of
[1:07:16] the holy ghost
[1:07:19] praise the lord
[1:07:21] why would a child want to blame their
[1:07:23] parents
[1:07:24] your parents gave birth to you they
[1:07:26] train you they support you and
[1:07:28] everything and you turn around and you
[1:07:30] blame them for all your problems why
[1:07:32] would a child do that it's because that
[1:07:34] child has wronged mind that's right
[1:07:39] what a man will want to leave his wife
[1:07:42] or beat his wife or or treat his wife
[1:07:46] all the woman in another term would want
[1:07:48] to do that
[1:07:49] be ungrateful to her husband why because
[1:07:52] she had lost her mind
[1:07:56] why people will never settle down and
[1:07:59] find a place that they can call home a
[1:08:01] place that they can call the church and
[1:08:04] support
[1:08:05] why because they have a religious spirit
[1:08:08] that have made them to lose their mind
[1:08:10] that no preacher can ever preach them
[1:08:13] satisfied i'm not here to preach you
[1:08:15] satisfied
[1:08:16] i have one person to please is almighty
[1:08:19] god
[1:08:30] and until we have the mind of christ you
[1:08:33] will run
[1:08:36] crazy it's the spirit of this age
[1:08:40] yes
[1:08:47] praise the lord
[1:08:52] it's a mental problem
[1:08:53] people that have mental problems
[1:08:56] they blame the government
[1:09:00] that blaming spirit
[1:09:02] comes when people start losing their
[1:09:04] mind when adam lose his mind
[1:09:07] from the mind
[1:09:09] of god
[1:09:11] he said it's the woman you gave me
[1:09:14] when eve lost her mind she said it's the
[1:09:16] second
[1:09:18] yep
[1:09:24] and until you have the mind of christ
[1:09:27] that comes by the holy ghost
[1:09:30] i will not be surprised when you blame
[1:09:32] me one of these days and say it's the
[1:09:34] preacher
[1:09:35] is brother warren
[1:09:37] i will not be surprised
[1:09:38] [Laughter]
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:44] when you stop blaming people grab
[1:09:45] yourself quickly am i losing it
[1:09:50] because if you have one person to blame
[1:09:52] it's yourself
[1:09:54] you must hold yourself accountable
[1:09:58] you must hold yourself accountable
[1:10:02] because the problem there is that nobody
[1:10:04] woke you up this morning
[1:10:06] the person that was responsible for you
[1:10:09] being up is almighty god
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:13] and if almighty god woke you up he is
[1:10:16] responsible for your joy he is
[1:10:19] responsible for your help he is
[1:10:21] responsible for everything that is
[1:10:23] happening to you
[1:10:26] [Applause]
[1:10:29] amen the psalmist said this is the day
[1:10:31] that the lord has made
[1:10:33] rejoice and be glad in it
[1:10:37] if god wakes you up
[1:10:39] he whips you out for you to be glad
[1:10:44] that's right what makes you sad
[1:10:46] is because as soon as you walk up you
[1:10:49] pick up your problem and put it on your
[1:10:50] head
[1:10:53] amen that's right
[1:10:55] that's right praise the lord amen
[1:11:01] when god wants you to be happy
[1:11:04] why should you allowed
[1:11:08] other people attitude
[1:11:11] to become a remote control
[1:11:14] that controls your life
[1:11:22] people attitude
[1:11:24] has become a remote control
[1:11:28] that put your volume up
[1:11:33] put your volume
[1:11:41] praise the lord
[1:11:42] i don't know what i'm preaching this
[1:11:44] morning
[1:11:45] just bear with me
[1:11:49] oh thank you jesus
[1:11:52] i told you i'm holding my save your hand
[1:11:55] i'm fearing the promised word
[1:11:58] nothing can stop me
[1:12:00] nothing can stop me
[1:12:02] from holding god's hands
[1:12:04] my goodness
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:14] that's what make this age a very
[1:12:15] ungrateful age
[1:12:20] praise the lord amen oh my what are we
[1:12:23] talking about this morning
[1:12:25] we will soon find out
[1:12:28] praise the lord
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:39] we read from the book of hebrew
[1:12:43] we read from the book of hebrew this
[1:12:44] morning
[1:12:45] and uh last week we were talking there
[1:12:48] from luke chapter one
[1:12:50] and uh talking about the bride
[1:12:52] consolation
[1:12:54] i thought i would have gone in that
[1:12:55] direction this morning to show you some
[1:12:58] of the the way that god
[1:13:00] is is comforting us in these difficult
[1:13:02] times because the way people think about
[1:13:06] comfort
[1:13:07] is completely different from the way
[1:13:08] that god comfort his people
[1:13:11] as i have prophesied comfort ye comfort
[1:13:13] you my people say the lord
[1:13:15] praise the lord
[1:13:17] and john the baptist was going to come
[1:13:20] honor that on that promise as a
[1:13:22] comforter his message was going to be a
[1:13:26] comfort to the people but you see when
[1:13:28] john came preaching jesus said why you
[1:13:30] what what you went out to see that's
[1:13:32] right
[1:13:34] he was not a weed that was being shifted
[1:13:36] by every wing
[1:13:38] he says well you went out to sea yes
[1:13:40] i'll tell you he was more than the
[1:13:42] prophet
[1:13:44] for every man that was born of a woman
[1:13:47] there was none greater
[1:13:49] than john
[1:13:52] praise the lord
[1:13:53] there was none greater than john
[1:13:56] and the prophet of god came on the scene
[1:13:58] to let us know what make john the
[1:14:00] greatest man born of a woman because
[1:14:04] this was the only man the first man
[1:14:06] that the world came to in flesh
[1:14:12] the first man that the world came to
[1:14:15] in flesh
[1:14:19] yes praise the lord
[1:14:21] but then jesus said he that is least in
[1:14:24] the kingdom
[1:14:25] which of course the kingdom is the
[1:14:27] baptism of the holy ghost a promise to
[1:14:30] the new testament church
[1:14:32] so at least in the kingdom
[1:14:37] at least with the holy ghost
[1:14:39] is greater than john
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:44] that's the reason why don't compromise
[1:14:46] the baptism of the holy ghost for
[1:14:48] nothing
[1:14:49] don't take it for church membership
[1:14:52] don't take it for any kind of
[1:14:54] experience because
[1:14:57] it's a person
[1:14:59] we talked a little bit about that this
[1:15:00] morning so uh
[1:15:06] yeah so we read from the book of hebrew
[1:15:09] yeah
[1:15:12] and
[1:15:14] hebrew chapter 2
[1:15:17] but you realize that over in the book of
[1:15:20] genesis
[1:15:23] the bible says that uh uh
[1:15:29] let me find my play a little bit
[1:15:33] amen
[1:15:46] in genesis chapter 14
[1:16:00] genesis chapter 14
[1:16:02] that will be the first time the word
[1:16:04] hebrew will be used
[1:16:06] okay
[1:16:08] so let's look at that a little bit here
[1:16:11] something caught my attention i will
[1:16:12] talk about it
[1:16:17] hebrew chapter 14 verse 13.
[1:16:25] i said genesis chapter 14 verse 13
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:32] be not deceived amen
[1:16:36] i see that you're grabbing me right
[1:16:38] there be not deceived
[1:16:40] don't follow the preacher stay with the
[1:16:41] word
[1:16:42] that's what the prophet said don't
[1:16:44] follow the preacher stay with the word
[1:16:49] genesis 14 13 and there came one
[1:16:53] that had escaped
[1:16:55] and told abram
[1:16:57] the hebrew
[1:17:00] before there were a people called the
[1:17:02] hebrews
[1:17:06] there was one man
[1:17:08] that was referred to as the hebrew
[1:17:13] and that word means a one from beyond
[1:17:19] a one from be young
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:28] i believe that abraham was
[1:17:30] referred to as the hebrew
[1:17:34] because the people could not understand
[1:17:36] his life
[1:17:40] it almost looked like they cannot tell
[1:17:43] where he's coming from
[1:17:47] because yes a man here traveling
[1:17:51] with baby blanket
[1:17:53] baby bathtub
[1:17:56] praise the lord
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] and going all over the place and telling
[1:18:03] people that he will have a child
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:09] this man
[1:18:10] is from the beyond
[1:18:13] what are the many in a good way or the
[1:18:16] bad way that he had lost his mind
[1:18:17] [Laughter]
[1:18:21] but he could not understand his life
[1:18:25] this man is not from here because every
[1:18:28] medical design proof
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:37] abram
[1:18:38] the hebrew
[1:18:41] well we're now talking on abraham the
[1:18:42] hebrew this morning
[1:18:44] it just caught my mind so i thought that
[1:18:46] i'll share that with you
[1:18:48] you can go
[1:18:50] and chew it
[1:18:51] one thing about the word you can never
[1:18:53] chew it finish
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:56] you can never chew this word and swallow
[1:18:58] it down
[1:19:01] you keep chewing it you keep chewing it
[1:19:03] when you think you have got it and you
[1:19:05] swallow it that it comes back up again
[1:19:07] and you keep chewing and you keep
[1:19:09] chewing
[1:19:14] it keeps coming back
[1:19:16] and every time it comes back up it's
[1:19:18] sweet
[1:19:23] praise the lord
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] i'm not making you gross
[1:19:31] you should not be gross
[1:19:32] because you are sheeps
[1:19:40] you should not be gross because you are
[1:19:42] sheeps that's what sheep does
[1:19:43] [Laughter]
[1:19:47] ah praise the lord
[1:19:50] now something caught my mind
[1:19:52] like he always does
[1:19:54] and i want to share with you this
[1:19:55] morning
[1:19:57] i have a note here that i will read from
[1:19:59] from the gamble church age
[1:20:01] we might not get through it because i
[1:20:03] have a portion also there that was going
[1:20:05] to be
[1:20:06] what i was going to speak on this
[1:20:07] morning
[1:20:08] but uh
[1:20:10] we would just trust the lord just like i
[1:20:12] said you will be the one that will kind
[1:20:14] of drive the service this morning
[1:20:16] i want to read a portion there that uh
[1:20:20] if our sisters back there will help us i
[1:20:22] have a portion there that i underline
[1:20:25] that's what i want to start from i will
[1:20:26] go back to the beginning though but i
[1:20:28] want to i want to start from this
[1:20:29] because that's where i titled my message
[1:20:32] for today
[1:20:35] where where you know it is raining i
[1:20:36] wonder if
[1:20:38] we are sufficiently impressed with the
[1:20:41] word in our midst that would be the
[1:20:42] third paragraph down from the first one
[1:20:47] praise the lord
[1:20:50] let's just read this together and then
[1:20:51] we will get a start here
[1:21:05] if i did not broke it in session for you
[1:21:07] back then i'm sorry
[1:21:08] i did it for myself
[1:21:13] now brother i'm saying here in the pagas
[1:21:15] church age he says
[1:21:17] i wonder
[1:21:20] if we are sufficiently
[1:21:23] impressed
[1:21:25] with the word
[1:21:27] in our midst
[1:21:30] praise the lord
[1:21:34] i want to hold us right there
[1:21:37] i wonder
[1:21:39] if we are
[1:21:41] sufficiently impressed
[1:21:44] with the word
[1:21:46] in our midst
[1:21:51] there's a statement
[1:21:54] at court
[1:21:59] that stands
[1:22:02] for us to stop and think
[1:22:06] praise the lord
[1:22:08] for us to stop and think for the why
[1:22:12] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:22:17] with the word
[1:22:19] that is in our midst
[1:22:21] now you cannot be impressed with the
[1:22:23] word that is in our midst if you have
[1:22:26] not seen the word
[1:22:28] that is in our minds
[1:22:30] praise the lord
[1:22:32] amen
[1:22:33] i will tell you that
[1:22:34] we have been greatly impressed
[1:22:37] with the ministry of malachi 4
[1:22:41] a prophet to this age
[1:22:44] it's it's been it's been i mean you
[1:22:47] checked the records
[1:22:48] there have now been a ministry that has
[1:22:52] risen like the ministry
[1:22:54] god gave to brother branham
[1:22:57] we are greatly impressed
[1:23:00] praise the lord
[1:23:02] but are we
[1:23:04] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:23:09] not the man brother branham
[1:23:11] but with the word yes
[1:23:15] that is in our minds
[1:23:17] many people mishonest to brother brandon
[1:23:19] in
[1:23:20] in the seal message when brother branham
[1:23:23] talks about maybe there is another one
[1:23:26] there are many men that have rosa on the
[1:23:28] scene thinking that they are that one
[1:23:30] but i will tell you this morning as the
[1:23:33] pastor of this church i believe that one
[1:23:36] is the word
[1:23:37] in our midst
[1:23:42] the one to lead the bride in the rapture
[1:23:45] is the word in our mess
[1:23:52] praise the lord
[1:23:55] and then my question will be
[1:24:00] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:24:07] have this word impress you
[1:24:12] praise the lord
[1:24:14] has this word
[1:24:17] impress you
[1:24:18] for you to say this is god dealing with
[1:24:21] my life yes
[1:24:23] praise the lord
[1:24:25] sometimes many times when we say the
[1:24:27] message is true
[1:24:30] right our mind goes to evens
[1:24:33] that we see
[1:24:36] sometimes when we listen to the tips
[1:24:39] and listen to the discernments
[1:24:42] sometimes when we see you know uh uh uh
[1:24:45] uh you know the the the the decency
[1:24:49] around you know uh uh uh the message
[1:24:52] environment and we see different things
[1:24:56] but
[1:24:58] when we talk about the word being true
[1:25:01] for the message being true
[1:25:03] is it because we are pointing to their
[1:25:06] truth
[1:25:10] are we talking about
[1:25:13] the truth of the word
[1:25:15] that we have seen
[1:25:21] are we together
[1:25:25] praise the lord amen
[1:25:27] are we sufficiently
[1:25:29] impressed
[1:25:31] with the word that is in our midst i
[1:25:34] said this couple of weeks ago and i say
[1:25:36] it again
[1:25:37] amen
[1:25:42] many of the people
[1:25:44] that are posting things
[1:25:46] that they think they know
[1:25:49] about the message
[1:25:51] the jewel said in the book of jews those
[1:25:54] are those are people forming clouds
[1:25:58] with no rain
[1:26:00] they are just forming clouds
[1:26:03] praise the lord
[1:26:05] with no rain
[1:26:06] elijah the prophet did not form a cloud
[1:26:10] he says i see the cloud
[1:26:12] like a man's hand
[1:26:15] praise the lord
[1:26:17] they are just forming clouds
[1:26:19] with no ring
[1:26:21] and it's because many of those people at
[1:26:23] a certain time in their life
[1:26:26] they thought they were impressed
[1:26:31] people that preached this message for 40
[1:26:33] years and plus they taught that they
[1:26:35] were impressed
[1:26:38] by the word that were in our midst but
[1:26:40] you see you have to remember
[1:26:43] brother branham says the people are not
[1:26:44] getting to christ
[1:26:46] because there is another hand that is
[1:26:49] pointing them
[1:26:51] to something else
[1:26:53] than to christ
[1:26:55] which is the word
[1:26:56] that's right
[1:26:58] praise the lord amen
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:06] so pretty soon they realize that no the
[1:27:09] word does not
[1:27:10] impress them anymore
[1:27:13] why what they thought was the message
[1:27:15] and they thought it was their life they
[1:27:18] realized that it do not impress them
[1:27:20] anymore
[1:27:23] so now they have to turn
[1:27:25] to facebook
[1:27:29] to be able to
[1:27:32] you know
[1:27:34] talk and talk and talk
[1:27:37] i won't do it i won't spend my time on
[1:27:38] those people
[1:27:40] i'd rather spend my time on people that
[1:27:43] want to get closer to
[1:27:44] christ spend my time and encourage us
[1:27:48] and say brother the lord god that had
[1:27:50] brought us out of this year
[1:27:52] is more than able to take us in
[1:27:55] i can promise you that we are more
[1:27:56] closer
[1:27:57] than the days gone by praise the lord
[1:28:01] and every time we get more closer it
[1:28:03] gets more beautiful
[1:28:11] praise the lord
[1:28:12] so we want to talk about that this
[1:28:14] morning being impressed
[1:28:17] with the word that is in our midst let's
[1:28:20] go back to the first uh paragraph there
[1:28:22] let me start here
[1:28:24] and and kind of build
[1:28:26] a foundation and now we will get to that
[1:28:28] he says and there it is
[1:28:31] you can claim
[1:28:34] that manifestation is the evidence of
[1:28:37] being
[1:28:38] spirit born spiritual no sir
[1:28:42] i will admit that true manifestation is
[1:28:46] the evidence of the holy ghost doing
[1:28:49] mighty act
[1:28:50] but it is not the evidence of the of the
[1:28:54] indwelling being
[1:28:56] spiritual
[1:28:58] even though
[1:28:59] that individual
[1:29:02] has an audience
[1:29:04] has has an abundance sorry an abundance
[1:29:08] of those manifestations what is what is
[1:29:10] happening here is that that's where the
[1:29:13] the the pentecostal movement came shot
[1:29:16] with the move of god they came short
[1:29:18] because they took they took
[1:29:20] manifestation
[1:29:22] a manifestation of the holy ghost for
[1:29:24] the entirety of the holy ghost
[1:29:28] praise the lord amen the truth is that
[1:29:32] if you are born of god god will deal
[1:29:34] with you
[1:29:36] every child of god will have a dealing
[1:29:39] of god in their life
[1:29:40] every child of god will have a
[1:29:42] manifestation
[1:29:44] god will deal with us one way or the
[1:29:46] other
[1:29:47] but you cannot take that manifestation
[1:29:49] for the entirety of god
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:53] because
[1:29:54] pentecost took the manifestation of
[1:29:57] speaking in tongues
[1:29:59] as the entirety of god that's the reason
[1:30:02] why they were requiring everybody to
[1:30:05] speak in tongues
[1:30:07] and say speaking in tongues is the
[1:30:09] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:30:12] praise the lord
[1:30:13] if you have an experience with god a
[1:30:15] manifestation with god a young man or a
[1:30:18] young girl or who you know in in your
[1:30:21] life there are different things you can
[1:30:23] point to in and nobody can write you out
[1:30:27] you know that that was god
[1:30:29] you know you know you know you know you
[1:30:33] don't care what people say you know you
[1:30:36] know that that was god
[1:30:39] there is no preacher that can preach you
[1:30:41] out of it
[1:30:42] [Applause]
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:44] praise the lord
[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:47] because i was there
[1:30:50] and if i was there
[1:30:52] i guess i ought to know
[1:30:55] that's right
[1:30:57] that's an old song too
[1:30:59] praise the lord
[1:31:01] that's an old song too
[1:31:05] so you have those experiences
[1:31:07] nobody can preach you out of it
[1:31:11] but the thing here is that
[1:31:13] when you take that experience that you
[1:31:16] have had
[1:31:17] you take that manifestation that you
[1:31:20] have had
[1:31:21] and says
[1:31:22] that's god
[1:31:25] praise the lord
[1:31:28] that's the holy ghost
[1:31:30] and you are not able to walk with god
[1:31:34] into another manifestation because every
[1:31:36] move of god is a manifestation
[1:31:39] that's the reason why the bible says
[1:31:41] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:31:44] because every time we take a step with
[1:31:46] god it's a manifestation
[1:31:50] that's why we thank god for the
[1:31:52] manifestation of the past and we keep
[1:31:54] looking to more manifestation
[1:32:00] we want to see god in the simple things
[1:32:03] in everyday things
[1:32:06] we want to see god in the reading of the
[1:32:08] bible
[1:32:09] we want to see god on our knees
[1:32:12] we want to see god when we are faced
[1:32:14] with difficult situations whether i work
[1:32:17] or wherever we are
[1:32:19] we want to see god
[1:32:21] why because he promised
[1:32:23] he will not leave you
[1:32:25] he will not forsake you so he's always
[1:32:28] there
[1:32:32] glory be to god
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:38] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[1:32:41] is just the same as it was
[1:32:45] the same as it it was back in the days
[1:32:49] of our lord
[1:32:52] it is receiving the word of truth
[1:32:56] for
[1:32:57] the day in which you live
[1:33:00] it is receiving the word of truth
[1:33:04] praise the lord
[1:33:06] it is receiving the word of truth
[1:33:09] it is not believing that the message
[1:33:12] is the truth
[1:33:14] it's two different things you can
[1:33:16] believe that the message is the truth
[1:33:18] and don't receive it
[1:33:34] the evidence of the holy ghost today is
[1:33:37] just the same
[1:33:39] as it was back in the days of our lord
[1:33:42] it is receiving the word of truth
[1:33:46] for the day in which you live
[1:33:52] it's receiving the word of truth
[1:33:55] for the day in which
[1:33:57] you
[1:34:02] live are we together
[1:34:06] amen
[1:34:12] there was something we were reading in
[1:34:14] our devotion uh uh you know reading the
[1:34:16] scripture like we normally do and like
[1:34:18] you know all of you do as well
[1:34:21] and uh uh
[1:34:23] and that morning uh you know we're
[1:34:25] reading that and you know it's almost
[1:34:27] like it jumped out of the page pages to
[1:34:29] me
[1:34:30] uh
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:32] wow this this is beautiful
[1:34:34] this is beautiful
[1:34:36] and uh
[1:34:39] and let's let's look at luke chapter 16.
[1:34:42] it's something that is that is very
[1:34:45] famous i mean a very
[1:34:47] uh you know everybody every one of us
[1:34:49] are used to that
[1:34:50] you know we we have read that
[1:34:53] in the bible before
[1:34:55] are we together
[1:34:59] and in luke chapter 16 jesus here from
[1:35:02] verse 19 is talking about this rich man
[1:35:05] and lazarus we all know about it
[1:35:08] now if you read this
[1:35:10] uh uh uh
[1:35:12] you know even even scholars
[1:35:15] even scholars if you study it you
[1:35:17] realize that scholars say brother
[1:35:19] branham said it also that this was this
[1:35:22] uh uh that jesus spoke yet about the
[1:35:24] rich man and lazarus he said it was not
[1:35:27] a parable he said because in parables
[1:35:30] you don't use names
[1:35:33] in parable you use you use
[1:35:36] figures to represent certain things
[1:35:39] praise the lord so jesus saying this
[1:35:43] he might have been on a vision
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:48] so he talks about a rich man here and he
[1:35:51] also talks about lazarus
[1:35:53] and then he went on in his in his
[1:35:55] conversation and he and he mentioned
[1:35:58] other names about abraham he mentioned
[1:36:02] moses
[1:36:03] and he talks about the prophets
[1:36:06] praise the lord
[1:36:08] amen now
[1:36:10] as as as most of us know
[1:36:13] you talked about the last book in the
[1:36:15] old testament is the book of malachi yes
[1:36:18] praise the lord
[1:36:19] but march is not the last prophet of the
[1:36:22] old testament
[1:36:25] no he's not the last prophet
[1:36:28] malachite is the last book
[1:36:31] of the old testament
[1:36:32] but he's not the last prophet
[1:36:35] because the scripture says the laws and
[1:36:38] the prophets were until john
[1:36:42] that's right
[1:36:43] amen
[1:36:44] that's right there is in luke chapter 16
[1:36:47] also
[1:36:48] the lord and the prophets
[1:36:50] were until john so john was the bridge
[1:36:55] between the old covenant
[1:36:57] and the new covenant
[1:36:59] praise the lord
[1:37:01] he was the bridge
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:04] praise the lord you send it the message
[1:37:06] the british brother you'll see brother
[1:37:08] branham spoke a little bit on that john
[1:37:10] was the breach between the old testament
[1:37:12] and the new covenant they're all covered
[1:37:14] in the new covenant so john actually was
[1:37:18] the last prophet of the old testament
[1:37:21] amen
[1:37:22] praise the lord so yeah now jesus giving
[1:37:26] this and he said
[1:37:29] after you talk about all of this he
[1:37:30] talks about this rich man saying oh lord
[1:37:33] send lazarus you know death does not
[1:37:36] change your nature because he was a rich
[1:37:38] man he always gave command even in hell
[1:37:40] he's giving command
[1:37:44] because he always give come in
[1:37:48] send lazarus to go and tell my brothers
[1:37:52] that's simple truth that death does not
[1:37:54] change your nature
[1:37:58] praise the lord
[1:37:59] so uh but yeah we realized that jesus
[1:38:03] said in verse 29 abraham said unto him
[1:38:07] said unto him they have moses
[1:38:11] and the prophets
[1:38:12] now the reason why they stick out to me
[1:38:15] is because many has made this
[1:38:18] a parable because jesus is talking in a
[1:38:21] time where moses has already been gone
[1:38:28] are we together amen
[1:38:31] well moses has already been gone and and
[1:38:33] here jesus now on a vision he's seeing
[1:38:37] abraham telling
[1:38:40] the rich man that they have they have
[1:38:43] moses and the prophets
[1:38:45] if they were not listening to that
[1:38:47] not somebody coming from the grave that
[1:38:49] they were listening to
[1:38:53] praise the lord
[1:38:54] are we together
[1:38:58] oh my
[1:39:00] you love the lord
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:05] you love the lord
[1:39:08] now so you realize that
[1:39:12] when abraham here in this vision said
[1:39:15] they have moses and the prophets he was
[1:39:18] not talking about the old testament
[1:39:22] moses physically that they have moses
[1:39:26] because when the scripture says the law
[1:39:28] and the prophets
[1:39:31] the message of moses was called the law
[1:39:36] are you grabbing the concept now you're
[1:39:38] grabbing the connection so jesus
[1:39:41] on a vision
[1:39:43] abraham was not saying they have moses
[1:39:45] physical moses that took them through
[1:39:47] the red sea
[1:39:48] but they still have moses because they
[1:39:50] had the message of moses
[1:40:00] that they have moses and the prophets
[1:40:03] because the torah was made out of the
[1:40:06] five book of moses
[1:40:08] and all the prophecies of the prophets
[1:40:14] so jesus on a vision abraham was now
[1:40:18] saying
[1:40:19] they're having the lord of moses
[1:40:22] they have the words of the prophets
[1:40:25] if they were not listening to it even if
[1:40:27] the man come physically from the dead
[1:40:30] they were not listening to him
[1:40:32] all of these people that are waiting for
[1:40:34] return ministry
[1:40:35] if they cannot obey brother brown a
[1:40:37] message now if he come back from the
[1:40:39] dead they will still now obey him
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:47] because what is important the man or the
[1:40:49] word
[1:40:51] the word is important
[1:40:53] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:40:56] of the word
[1:40:58] is the word impressing you every day
[1:41:04] oh
[1:41:06] you are waiting the word by the vessel
[1:41:08] that is being used
[1:41:13] praise the lord
[1:41:15] you are waiting the word by the vessel
[1:41:18] that's being used
[1:41:20] that's the reason why you were even
[1:41:21] struggle
[1:41:25] when your wife gave you a correction
[1:41:26] that comes from the word
[1:41:29] you will struggle
[1:41:33] well you're not supposed to be preaching
[1:41:34] to me she's not preaching to you
[1:41:37] she's just telling you what the word
[1:41:38] says
[1:41:39] hallelujah
[1:41:41] that's right
[1:41:42] amen
[1:41:45] amen that's right
[1:41:47] that's right amen
[1:41:49] are we impressed with the word
[1:41:52] or do we get impressed when we see the
[1:41:54] kind of a vessel
[1:41:57] when we see the person that is bringing
[1:41:59] the word and say what impress you all
[1:42:00] and say the word
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:10] praise the lord amen
[1:42:13] we together
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:23] all of these all of these things that
[1:42:25] run around the places
[1:42:27] find them around the church a man will
[1:42:29] correct his wife she will not take it
[1:42:31] she will only take it when the pastor
[1:42:33] says that what kind of spirit is that
[1:42:40] praise the lord what kind of spirit is
[1:42:42] that
[1:42:49] are we together amen
[1:42:52] praise the lord
[1:42:55] oh my
[1:43:00] glory be to god just bear with me yet a
[1:43:02] little bit
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:07] let's do it on this a little bit just
[1:43:09] just bear with me bear with me
[1:43:13] as you have always done
[1:43:16] i mean you have bear with me that's what
[1:43:17] i'm keep standing in this puppet
[1:43:24] as chapter 15
[1:43:28] i'm right there too
[1:43:30] as chapter 15.
[1:43:38] as chapter 15.
[1:43:53] as chapter 15.
[1:43:57] now this is this is the the the
[1:44:00] the apostles here now that are kind of
[1:44:02] for dealing with a situation in the
[1:44:04] first church
[1:44:05] and it says
[1:44:06] the rights here the
[1:44:08] uh
[1:44:09] uh
[1:44:13] let's read from verse 19. you know
[1:44:15] there's all of these things were
[1:44:16] happening you know where some of the
[1:44:18] jews were forcing the gentiles to come
[1:44:21] on a jewish lord you know before they
[1:44:23] would accept them in the church and all
[1:44:25] of that praise the lord you see some of
[1:44:27] those things people make their culture
[1:44:29] the message no no the word is the word
[1:44:32] amen we must be able to accept that we
[1:44:35] all have different culture
[1:44:37] praise the lord
[1:44:39] we will not take our culture above the
[1:44:41] word of god
[1:44:42] praise the lord and we will not make our
[1:44:45] culture the word of god
[1:44:49] now so james and some of the brothers
[1:44:51] were senior to deal with this problem
[1:44:53] and it says wherefore verse 19.
[1:44:55] wherefore my sentence is i love this
[1:44:57] brother this is james talking he says my
[1:44:59] sentence is that we trouble trouble
[1:45:02] not them which
[1:45:04] from among the gentiles are turned to
[1:45:06] god
[1:45:08] but there we write unto them
[1:45:11] that they are seen from from pollutions
[1:45:14] of idols and from fornication and from
[1:45:17] things strangled and from blood
[1:45:21] verse 21 now
[1:45:23] for moses of all time
[1:45:26] in every city
[1:45:30] for moses of all time
[1:45:32] have in every city damn that read him
[1:45:36] how were they reading moses
[1:45:43] moses
[1:45:45] of all time high in every city them that
[1:45:48] read him
[1:45:50] this is the apostle james
[1:45:53] addressing the situation in the first
[1:45:56] church
[1:45:57] and said the people were reading moses
[1:45:59] how were they reading moses
[1:46:01] they were reading the lord of moses
[1:46:07] praise the lord
[1:46:10] people that struggle with reading
[1:46:11] brother branham
[1:46:13] moses was read in every church
[1:46:16] in every city
[1:46:19] they read moses
[1:46:26] you got to tear that out of your bible
[1:46:28] if you struggle with that you got to
[1:46:29] take it out of your bible
[1:46:37] they read the lord of moses
[1:46:42] because he was an old testament
[1:46:44] vindicator prophet
[1:46:46] they read the lord of moses in every
[1:46:49] synagogue every time they gather
[1:46:52] so james was instructing the brothers
[1:46:55] here let us not bother these people let
[1:46:57] not put too much on them we
[1:47:01] we have to realize
[1:47:03] that the word is more stronger than our
[1:47:07] opinion we have to realize that the
[1:47:10] world has the power to transform the
[1:47:13] world has the power to change a man's
[1:47:16] life
[1:47:20] instead our imposing things on people
[1:47:23] let us read the word we are saying what
[1:47:26] the word says
[1:47:27] because the word has the power to change
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:38] they have moses
[1:47:39] and the prophets
[1:47:43] it was not physical moses
[1:47:46] they had the word
[1:47:48] they had the word of god that was given
[1:47:50] to them
[1:47:53] see because the people was not
[1:47:55] sufficiently impressed by the word
[1:48:01] praise the lord
[1:48:05] are we together amen
[1:48:12] amen
[1:48:15] jim says for moses of all time have in
[1:48:18] every city
[1:48:20] them that read him
[1:48:23] being read in the synagogues
[1:48:25] every sabbath day
[1:48:29] if the word
[1:48:31] is being read
[1:48:33] the bible says this word
[1:48:36] is the spoken word seed of god
[1:48:40] praise the lord
[1:48:42] this word is the original seed of god
[1:48:51] and every seed of god
[1:48:53] will bring forth
[1:48:56] of its kind
[1:48:58] praise the lord instead of making rules
[1:49:02] and church ritual
[1:49:04] let's give the people the word
[1:49:08] let's give the people the word
[1:49:11] because the word
[1:49:12] has the ability
[1:49:14] to face the devil in every age
[1:49:19] the world predestinated for this age
[1:49:23] can faith can meet the challenge of this
[1:49:25] age
[1:49:39] so when jesus says
[1:49:43] moses they have moses and the prophet
[1:49:47] how many times people read that and
[1:49:49] their mind goes back to the old
[1:49:50] testament moses
[1:49:53] never considering that jesus was talking
[1:49:55] about the message of moses
[1:49:59] they have the message of moses
[1:50:03] praise the lord
[1:50:13] are we sufficiently impressed
[1:50:20] praise the lord
[1:50:24] when we hear this hear the word
[1:50:28] does something leap with us
[1:50:30] leap up in us
[1:50:32] like just like a lesbian
[1:50:36] is there something that leaps up in you
[1:50:39] for joy
[1:50:42] something that stream out yes this is
[1:50:44] the word
[1:50:45] i love it speak to me lord
[1:50:52] or do we just sit there
[1:50:54] when the preacher says i know where he's
[1:50:56] going
[1:50:58] when he says this yeah the world also
[1:50:59] says this yes
[1:51:04] i want the mistrain the mystery
[1:51:12] a lot of mystery without christ has to
[1:51:13] make people miserable
[1:51:20] are we together
[1:51:24] kind of a slip out a little bit here so
[1:51:26] you see burban talking about the
[1:51:28] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:51:30] the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:51:34] is keeping that word
[1:51:37] keeping the word christ jesus in your
[1:51:41] midst
[1:51:44] the living word
[1:51:52] we get back here he says the evidence of
[1:51:53] the holy receiving the holy ghost today
[1:51:56] is just the same as it was back in the
[1:51:59] days of of our lord it is receiving the
[1:52:02] word of truth
[1:52:04] not believing that the message is the
[1:52:06] truth it's receiving
[1:52:12] it's receiving
[1:52:14] being impregnated
[1:52:16] amen
[1:52:18] being pregnated with the word
[1:52:22] is receiving
[1:52:28] the word of truth
[1:52:34] not just saying i believe the message
[1:52:38] all we are in the message no
[1:52:41] it's receiving the word of truth
[1:52:47] is be impregnated
[1:52:49] with the word of truth
[1:52:54] are we together
[1:53:00] this is receiving the word of truth
[1:53:02] for the day in which you live jesus
[1:53:05] never distressed the importance
[1:53:08] of the works
[1:53:10] as he did the word
[1:53:15] he did not
[1:53:17] make emphasis jesus says says the
[1:53:20] scripture
[1:53:21] for in them you have internal life
[1:53:26] praise the lord he says you don't
[1:53:28] believe what i'm doing sess the
[1:53:29] scripture
[1:53:32] he didn't say come and follow me on the
[1:53:33] other side that would be miracle no
[1:53:36] he never put emphasis on the works
[1:53:40] he put emphasis on the word
[1:53:42] that's the reason why young people no
[1:53:44] matter what the devil is doing around
[1:53:46] your life look at the thing that is
[1:53:48] important in your life
[1:53:49] are you embracing the word of god
[1:53:57] the emphasis is on that word
[1:53:59] because if he can destroy your
[1:54:01] confidence in the world nothing is left
[1:54:04] for you again
[1:54:09] praise the lord amen
[1:54:11] that's why we have ended up with a
[1:54:13] generation that has just become a
[1:54:15] science-seeking generation
[1:54:18] praise the lord
[1:54:20] sound seeking they they just want to go
[1:54:22] to a theater
[1:54:25] sit back and see pete and see
[1:54:27] manifestation
[1:54:31] they don't have one interest for the
[1:54:33] world
[1:54:35] there is not one desire for the word
[1:54:44] jesus never stressed
[1:54:47] the importance of the work as he did the
[1:54:49] word
[1:54:50] he knew that if the people got the word
[1:54:55] the works
[1:54:56] will follow
[1:54:59] because the seed will produce of itself
[1:55:03] it will now you be working out you will
[1:55:05] not be working our holiness you will not
[1:55:07] be working our righteousness but that
[1:55:09] seed of god that has been planted down
[1:55:12] in your heart will start to produce that
[1:55:14] seed will be bringing your body on a
[1:55:16] subjection
[1:55:21] that's the reason why people cannot
[1:55:23] overcome their habits
[1:55:26] praise the lord they cannot overcome
[1:55:28] their habit because they don't want to
[1:55:30] take the remedy of the word
[1:55:36] praise the lord amen
[1:55:40] if you follow the word the works
[1:55:43] will follow
[1:55:48] are we together
[1:55:50] are we impressed
[1:55:51] with the word of god
[1:55:53] in the beginning was the word
[1:55:55] the word was with god
[1:55:58] the word was god
[1:56:00] and that word
[1:56:02] is made flesh
[1:56:04] praise the lord are we impressed
[1:56:07] when you take your bible and you read do
[1:56:10] you feel like oh god i'm holding your
[1:56:13] sacred word in my hands
[1:56:16] i'm holding your sacred word in my hands
[1:56:28] praise the lord
[1:56:30] amen amen
[1:56:35] now putting your
[1:56:37] your donut sugar grease on the bible
[1:56:43] praise the lord
[1:56:46] don't misunderstand me now
[1:56:48] i don't mean you can't have your
[1:56:49] breakfast reading your bible
[1:56:53] but yet you don't make the word of god
[1:56:55] sloppy
[1:57:04] praise the lord
[1:57:10] you'll find some old saints that read
[1:57:11] their bible disciple every a and every
[1:57:15] bee
[1:57:17] praise the lord
[1:57:19] amen
[1:57:21] and the right arrows and stars
[1:57:25] because there was just something the
[1:57:27] holy spirit is struck in there that is
[1:57:29] not being sloppy
[1:57:33] that is chewing the word to the bone
[1:57:39] that is chewing the word told they're
[1:57:41] born
[1:57:46] because i know where your mind was going
[1:57:53] now jesus knew that there was going to
[1:57:56] be
[1:57:56] a terrible drift away from the world
[1:58:01] in the pagano's age which was as yet
[1:58:04] 200
[1:58:06] years off
[1:58:08] from palmer vision
[1:58:10] he knew that drift who
[1:58:13] will cause them to go into a dark age
[1:58:17] the reason why we have
[1:58:20] the age that we are living living in
[1:58:23] because the people has drifted from the
[1:58:25] world
[1:58:28] praise the lord
[1:58:31] according to history there were two
[1:58:34] civilizations
[1:58:36] that almighty god attached himself to
[1:58:41] because of the people on the earth
[1:58:45] once it was the civilization of the
[1:58:47] jewish people
[1:58:48] the next civilization was the
[1:58:50] civilization of this country
[1:58:58] according to history two civilizations
[1:59:01] that god attached himself to
[1:59:05] to be able to work through and bless his
[1:59:07] people this book that we are reading is
[1:59:10] is a book that is that is filled with
[1:59:13] jewish history when god was dealing with
[1:59:16] people for it to be to our benefit
[1:59:23] and that's how god
[1:59:25] put on the hearts of the founding
[1:59:27] fathers the men that flee and came to
[1:59:29] this country fought the indians from
[1:59:32] their own land
[1:59:34] to be able to establish a place for
[1:59:36] religious freedom
[1:59:46] but america is what it is today
[1:59:49] because it has drifted from the
[1:59:50] principle of god's word
[1:59:54] praise the lord
[1:59:56] and it can never get better
[2:00:00] it has drifted from the principle of
[2:00:02] god's word
[2:00:08] america is looking for friendship with
[2:00:10] the arabs
[2:00:13] they are betraying
[2:00:16] the principle
[2:00:18] that man's fought for
[2:00:28] praise the lord
[2:00:31] i'm not becoming
[2:00:32] political i'm preaching what i know is
[2:00:34] the truth in god's word
[2:00:38] since 1963
[2:00:40] 64 when the bible was kicked out of the
[2:00:42] constitution and kicked away from school
[2:00:45] down the hill
[2:00:48] this country has gone
[2:00:55] praise the lord down the hills
[2:01:06] glory be to god
[2:01:08] amen
[2:01:12] we can sense uh
[2:01:15] military flights
[2:01:18] to help the people uh there in
[2:01:20] afghanistan
[2:01:22] may god help help them and help all the
[2:01:24] situation there
[2:01:26] have no ill feelings
[2:01:29] but yet we have a lot of problems
[2:01:31] with the people right across our border
[2:01:37] why because we are looking for our own
[2:01:39] interests
[2:01:45] looking for our what is our political
[2:01:48] interest in political achievement
[2:01:52] and we will not be
[2:01:55] a good samaritan
[2:01:57] back to the word let's get back to the
[2:01:59] word
[2:02:00] praise the lord
[2:02:02] amen
[2:02:05] but that's the place we find ourselves
[2:02:10] and these things are not surprising to
[2:02:12] us because the word said it
[2:02:16] praise the lord
[2:02:19] peter brown says that send hundreds of
[2:02:22] millions of dollars on nations and
[2:02:23] overseas when we have homelessness
[2:02:32] brother
[2:02:36] are we sufficiently impressed
[2:02:38] of the world that is in our midst there
[2:02:40] is somewhere i'm bringing you
[2:02:42] i'm just getting you on the bait i want
[2:02:43] you to get a good bite
[2:02:47] i want you to get a good batch because
[2:02:49] when i'm pulling you in it's going to be
[2:02:51] applaud
[2:02:54] glory be to god
[2:02:58] what a day what an age we are living in
[2:03:02] they are called to do their work we are
[2:03:03] called to do ours
[2:03:05] ours is to stand for christ in this day
[2:03:08] praise the lord is to live for god
[2:03:11] amen
[2:03:12] praise the lord and we must love all of
[2:03:15] god's people
[2:03:17] everyone that was created in the image
[2:03:19] of god we must love
[2:03:21] but yet truth is truth
[2:03:29] we don't make truth
[2:03:31] truth makes yourself
[2:03:35] praise the lord amen so we see all of
[2:03:37] these things because they're drifted
[2:03:39] from the word that's what took the
[2:03:41] church ages in the dark age and because
[2:03:44] the uh uh
[2:03:46] the churches has drifted from the word
[2:03:48] that's why we're having the problem that
[2:03:50] we are having even around the message
[2:03:52] cycle
[2:03:56] we have drifted from work the prophet of
[2:03:59] god instructed us
[2:04:01] if we if we we will have taken this
[2:04:03] message just like he gave it to us
[2:04:07] we will have breaking melania on the
[2:04:09] earth
[2:04:15] but every man takes it
[2:04:17] to build his kingdom
[2:04:22] praise the lord
[2:04:31] he knew the way
[2:04:33] that men originally get away from god
[2:04:35] was by first leaving the word
[2:04:39] by first leaving the word
[2:04:42] when you leave the world there is
[2:04:44] nothing that will hold you
[2:04:47] there is nothing on earth that you will
[2:04:49] not do
[2:04:50] when you leave the word of god
[2:04:58] praise the lord
[2:05:00] when you see preachers men that are
[2:05:02] standing behind a sacred eye preaching
[2:05:04] this bible looking for sinners now
[2:05:06] turning into homosexuals because they
[2:05:08] left the word of god that they don't
[2:05:10] even know their own identification
[2:05:16] and you want us to embrace that in the
[2:05:18] name of love
[2:05:21] i know a corrected love
[2:05:23] because love has correction in it
[2:05:31] that's
[2:05:32] right true
[2:05:40] get away from the word
[2:05:42] if you leave the word
[2:05:44] you have left god
[2:05:50] thus he's presenting himself to the
[2:05:52] church
[2:05:53] and indeed to all the church of all ages
[2:05:56] i am the word
[2:05:59] if you want deity to be in your midst
[2:06:04] i say it to this church if you want
[2:06:06] deity to be in this assembly
[2:06:09] praise the lord
[2:06:10] amen
[2:06:12] if you want deity to be in your midst
[2:06:15] as much as we love brother branham as
[2:06:18] much as we believe that the pillar of
[2:06:20] fire came over him the presence of the
[2:06:23] picture of the pill of fire don't bring
[2:06:24] deity
[2:06:30] if you want deity in your midst that's
[2:06:32] the prophet of god said it
[2:06:34] i'm reading his word
[2:06:44] if you want deity in your mess
[2:06:47] then welcome and receive the word
[2:06:51] welcome and receive the word
[2:06:55] be like maryland say beard unto me and
[2:06:58] calling to your word
[2:07:00] amen
[2:07:04] praise the lord
[2:07:08] just last week or i don't know when yeah
[2:07:11] last week
[2:07:12] talking about that pillow of fire i
[2:07:14] believe it with all my heart
[2:07:16] it's more real than this picture up here
[2:07:19] i keep saying it over and over because
[2:07:21] it's my conviction
[2:07:23] this is just a painted painter picture
[2:07:26] and the only reason why we use it
[2:07:29] and many message churches that are that
[2:07:31] you know that are disregarding brother
[2:07:32] brandon picture and disregarding the
[2:07:34] pillow of fire the only reason why we
[2:07:37] use this is because of brother branham
[2:07:39] vision in the field
[2:07:44] he says when i went in the field to pray
[2:07:46] and cry for my father jesus appeared to
[2:07:48] me when i turned about turn around and
[2:07:50] look at the picture it was just like
[2:07:54] huffman head or tattoo
[2:07:56] that's why we use it
[2:08:02] but that picture with a pillow fired on
[2:08:04] his head it was not a vision
[2:08:07] it was not a vision
[2:08:09] it was a reality
[2:08:11] where god came down and identified
[2:08:13] himself with a man that was standing for
[2:08:18] true amen
[2:08:22] thank you jesus but if you want deity in
[2:08:24] your mess
[2:08:25] that's right if you want deity in your
[2:08:27] mess yes
[2:08:30] you can sow a suit
[2:08:32] and pull pillow fire all over you
[2:08:35] it does not bring deity
[2:08:38] you gotta receive the word
[2:08:40] you gotta surrender to the word you
[2:08:42] gotta obey the word
[2:08:44] [Applause]
[2:08:47] that's the thing that brings deity
[2:08:59] if this church
[2:09:01] want to experience a
[2:09:02] pentecost you better start obeying the
[2:09:05] word in your home
[2:09:08] you better start obeying the word in
[2:09:10] your life
[2:09:13] if we want to experience pentecost if we
[2:09:15] want our young people to experience the
[2:09:17] holy ghost
[2:09:22] we better put importance to the world
[2:09:25] that nothing will be above the word of
[2:09:27] god in your life
[2:09:40] praise the lord
[2:09:41] because just like i told you
[2:09:44] it's just the matter of time
[2:09:46] just a matter of time
[2:09:48] you might put your own post on facebook
[2:09:54] just a matter of time
[2:09:56] you might put your own update on
[2:09:57] instagram i was in the message and in a
[2:10:00] message the day they said in the message

[2:10:22] billboard

[2:10:33] that is so seasoned with grace

[2:13:18] 21
[2:13:20] ii chronicle chapter 21.
[2:13:29] ii chronicle chapter 21
[2:13:36] let's read verse 12.
[2:13:42] and there came a writing
[2:13:46] to him
[2:13:47] from elijah the prophet
[2:13:52] so elijah the prophet here is sending
[2:13:55] a letter
[2:13:56] to jehoram
[2:13:58] a letter from elijah the prophet
[2:14:01] to jehoram
[2:14:04] saying thus said the lord god
[2:14:07] of david the father
[2:14:10] because thou has now walked
[2:14:13] in the ways of jerusalem the father not
[2:14:16] in the ways of assad
[2:14:18] king of judah
[2:14:21] but has walked in that
[2:14:23] in the way of the kings of israel
[2:14:27] which means he went out and bring
[2:14:29] aha bill worship down into judah
[2:14:33] and has made judah and inhabitants of
[2:14:35] jerusalem to go a warring
[2:14:38] like to the warden of the house of ahab
[2:14:41] and also has slain that brother
[2:14:45] the brethrens of the father house
[2:14:48] which were better
[2:14:50] than thyself
[2:14:52] behold a great plague
[2:14:56] behold with a great pledge will the lord
[2:14:59] smile thy people
[2:15:01] and our children and our wives
[2:15:04] and all thy ghouls
[2:15:08] and thou shall have great sickness
[2:15:11] by disease of the boys
[2:15:14] or until the boss shall fall the bowels
[2:15:17] shall fall out by reason of the sickness
[2:15:22] day by day you're going to have a slowly
[2:15:24] death
[2:15:26] you're going to wash your own stomach
[2:15:28] sweat and burst
[2:15:32] because of the weakness that you have
[2:15:34] done but let's put this writing in
[2:15:37] context you can read the rest of it
[2:15:40] this is a letter
[2:15:43] that elijah the prophet
[2:15:46] wrote
[2:15:51] so jehoram the king
[2:15:54] but if you put it in context of the king
[2:15:56] of israel elijah has come many years
[2:16:00] before this man
[2:16:02] elijah came and he was raptured and gone
[2:16:07] this is the grandson of jehoshapha
[2:16:11] that went with ahab to battle
[2:16:14] and after joshua for his his father was
[2:16:17] asap
[2:16:20] elijah has come and gone
[2:16:24] but here is a letter that elijah wrote
[2:16:27] years before that child was born
[2:16:43] yes
[2:16:45] between uh
[2:16:46] uh uh uh the king and joshua for
[2:16:49] the house 66 years
[2:16:52] where righteousness ruled on the throne
[2:16:56] of judah
[2:17:00] joshua was the one that said is there
[2:17:02] not one
[2:17:04] that we can consult for the word of the
[2:17:06] lord
[2:17:08] and yet he was a grandfather to jehoram
[2:17:15] but elijah the prophet
[2:17:20] wrote him a letter
[2:17:25] i believe the prophet in his chamber
[2:17:28] brought into a vision
[2:17:32] he started to write
[2:17:34] dear jehoram
[2:17:40] write this and right there
[2:17:42] you write this right there
[2:17:48] before
[2:17:49] that child was ever born
[2:18:07] are we together
[2:18:19] let's go to the book of isaiah
[2:18:26] i'm coming back to that thought i'm just
[2:18:28] just want us to look at some few things
[2:18:30] here
[2:18:32] oh praise the lord
[2:18:35] praise the lord
[2:18:38] what a god we serve people
[2:18:41] what almighty god we serve
[2:18:44] praise the lord
[2:18:48] what almighty god we serve
[2:18:50] all of these things become so they
[2:18:53] become so common to us
[2:18:55] you hear he knows the end from the
[2:18:57] beginning he's just become a slogan to
[2:18:59] the believer
[2:19:00] praise the lord
[2:19:01] amen
[2:19:03] you knew me from our mother woman we
[2:19:04] preached we call jeremiah and don't even
[2:19:07] process what we are saying
[2:19:23] we don't even process what we are saying
[2:19:29] we will not cut those things
[2:19:31] because we try to make ourselves special
[2:19:36] glory be to god
[2:19:39] over here in the book of isaiah
[2:19:42] the prophet isaiah is going to prophesy
[2:19:48] and first
[2:19:49] he gets in the channel of the first
[2:19:51] person and he's speaking in the name of
[2:19:53] god
[2:19:55] and he says i'm the creator of heaven
[2:19:57] and earth
[2:19:58] i mean all things
[2:20:01] praise the lord
[2:20:03] and as isaiah talks
[2:20:06] then he broke into a ring
[2:20:09] and says thou say the lord
[2:20:12] my seven
[2:20:14] cyrus
[2:20:19] and
[2:20:20] he's giving a word
[2:20:22] about a child that is not even born yet
[2:20:29] he's writing he's giving a word and the
[2:20:32] stripes they are sitting there and
[2:20:34] writing every word from from from from
[2:20:36] isaiah mouth
[2:20:40] how the lord has ordained thee
[2:20:43] deliver my people
[2:20:46] and god even called him
[2:20:48] the servant of god
[2:20:49] and i believe as the people sat there
[2:20:52] and they are listening to isaiah
[2:20:55] that says even the name he's calling
[2:20:57] there is no jewish child that is called
[2:20:59] that name
[2:21:01] how can he be talking what is he talking
[2:21:03] about
[2:21:06] praise the lord
[2:21:09] amen
[2:21:15] and if you realize you will see that it
[2:21:17] took almost about 150 years
[2:21:22] for cyrus
[2:21:24] to be born and for him to come
[2:21:27] to road
[2:21:30] praise the lord
[2:21:33] amen
[2:21:35] he was born
[2:21:37] and his parents give him that name not
[2:21:40] knowing the prophet uh isaiah
[2:21:45] he went to school all his friends call
[2:21:47] him by that name
[2:21:52] praise the lord
[2:21:54] amen
[2:21:56] they call him by the name
[2:21:58] he grew up
[2:22:00] he got into uh
[2:22:02] uh uh by which means what about uh uh
[2:22:05] inherit things all by military power
[2:22:07] whatever means he became now the king
[2:22:13] are we together
[2:22:16] and after he started ruling that was
[2:22:18] when
[2:22:19] the the the straws realize
[2:22:22] that this king
[2:22:27] this king this man that is now on the
[2:22:29] throne
[2:22:30] there is something in the wreckers
[2:22:33] concerning him
[2:22:36] something has been said
[2:22:39] by the prophet isaiah concerning this
[2:22:40] man
[2:22:42] let's check the record
[2:22:46] and go when it starts flipping the
[2:22:48] records isaiah chapter 44
[2:22:54] they started flipping the wrecker
[2:23:07] praise the lord amen
[2:23:09] you realize chapter 44 you have time
[2:23:11] read everything
[2:23:12] let's get down to the last verse
[2:23:19] they are sarah cyrus
[2:23:21] he is my shepherd
[2:23:24] and shall perform all my pleasures
[2:23:29] even saying to jerusalem this is a man
[2:23:33] that is not even a jew
[2:23:37] he's not a jew
[2:23:39] but almighty god that is sovereign in
[2:23:41] his ways
[2:23:49] he condemned israel to go down into
[2:23:52] babylon punish them because of their own
[2:23:54] belief
[2:23:56] he knew the kind of a treatment that
[2:23:58] they would go through yeah he
[2:24:00] predestinated a king that would rise to
[2:24:02] power
[2:24:03] and we give them favor
[2:24:06] and he never kept it to himself
[2:24:10] he told a prophet isaiah
[2:24:12] and as i have prophesied about it and
[2:24:15] the stripes running they had a wrecker
[2:24:23] you know what happened
[2:24:25] when he came to power they brought this
[2:24:28] very wrecker
[2:24:30] with the death that it was said
[2:24:35] and he gave it to cyrus the king
[2:24:40] when he read the word of the prophet
[2:24:42] isaiah
[2:24:44] he came on a conviction
[2:24:50] he came on a conviction
[2:24:53] and he instructed them to go back and
[2:24:55] rebuild their walls
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:25:02] that's the mind of god
[2:25:05] he did not ask you
[2:25:08] praise the lord
[2:25:09] he didn't ask you which day you want to
[2:25:11] be born
[2:25:12] he didn't ask you for your birthday
[2:25:16] praise the lord
[2:25:18] amen
[2:25:19] he didn't ask you for the number of hair
[2:25:21] on your hair yet he numbered them
[2:25:24] yeah he numbered them
[2:25:26] the bible said he numbered them
[2:25:29] which mean he said this one is one this
[2:25:32] one is two this one is three that's how
[2:25:35] norman is
[2:25:37] it's not getting the psalm
[2:25:48] i shall perform on my pleasure even
[2:25:51] saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built
[2:25:55] into the temple their foundation
[2:25:58] their foundation will be laid
[2:26:02] god is instructing
[2:26:09] a few years ago i was down there in uh
[2:26:11] in
[2:26:14] south africa
[2:26:15] dedicating the
[2:26:18] church and this brother and his wife
[2:26:21] young very young brother
[2:26:23] and his wife i was supposed to do a
[2:26:25] dedication for them last year again in
[2:26:27] another city before the whole epidemic
[2:26:29] came this young brother and his wife
[2:26:30] just fed a burden they have lived in
[2:26:32] that city they had a little church there
[2:26:35] they went on a burden and you know to
[2:26:37] build a church
[2:26:39] and uh
[2:26:40] uh you know and the support of the work
[2:26:43] and while they were doing that
[2:26:47] he had a friend
[2:26:49] and this friend is a muslim boy
[2:26:52] but he so
[2:26:54] respect this guy
[2:26:55] this brother young brother
[2:26:58] i mean he's uh he just about maybe about
[2:27:00] 35 36 years old
[2:27:03] and
[2:27:04] so respected god because of how he
[2:27:07] stands for what he believes is the truth
[2:27:12] they are business partners and
[2:27:14] everything and you know he kept telling
[2:27:16] this god about you know why you know i'm

[2:27:20] want to have a church here so we're
[2:27:21] going to support the work and all of
[2:27:23] that
[2:27:24] and then because of
[2:27:28] the conviction that this young muslim
[2:27:30] boy saw that a friend of mine
[2:27:34] is so convinced to build a tabernacle he
[2:27:37] never told his friend
[2:27:39] but after the building was already built
[2:27:42] he casted the entire parking lot
[2:27:48] and he says i'm doing it in honor of you
[2:27:52] because i've never seen a young man
[2:27:55] that's thought that love what he stands
[2:27:57] for
[2:28:01] praise the lord amen
[2:28:03] he had a burden and god raised up
[2:28:06] somebody to stand with his burden
[2:28:13] 150 years god is ordaining a man
[2:28:18] that will raise up the walls of the
[2:28:20] foundation
[2:28:26] he will raise up
[2:28:28] the temple foundation was
[2:28:32] and it's written in the book
[2:28:34] 150 years before he was born

[2:28:47] before jehoram was born
[2:28:51] elijah the prophet wrote him a letter
[2:28:55] wrote the letter put it in an envelope
[2:28:58] and seal it
[2:29:00] to the king jehoram

[2:29:09] remains they said well you get a letter

[2:29:13] jehoram
[2:29:17] assange's father came and ruled in
[2:29:19] righteousness
[2:29:25] and then when he was born
[2:29:27] and started ruling in wickedness
[2:29:30] the holy ghost reminded someone
[2:29:33] that there is a letter that is written
[2:29:35] take that letter
[2:29:37] and go and give it to jehoram
[2:29:51] are we together
[2:29:56] i'm going to skip down a little bit
[2:30:00] it looks like i got my
[2:30:02] got my team back there off track this
[2:30:04] morning but that's fine
[2:30:06] that's fine you've been gracious to me

[2:30:17] i'm going to skip down a little bit yeah
[2:30:20] oh praise the lord
[2:30:24] amen
[2:30:32] you love the lord
[2:30:33] amen
[2:30:34] he's been so good to us
[2:30:37] amen
[2:30:38] and we serving the god that is the same
[2:30:40] yesterday
[2:30:42] today and forever
[2:30:45] praise the lord
[2:30:46] you have to realize that it's in this
[2:30:48] began at church age where brother
[2:30:50] branham says one morning when i was
[2:30:51] praying the holy spirit woke me up and
[2:30:54] said pick up your pen
[2:30:56] and write
[2:31:00] a message
[2:31:01] to the bride
[2:31:03] before you were even born
[2:31:06] [Music]
[2:31:07] before the manifestation of the bride
[2:31:10] ever came on the scene
[2:31:13] the holy ghost said pick up your pain
[2:31:16] and write
[2:31:17] i just love you jesus
[2:31:20] praise the lord
[2:31:26] oh my goodness
[2:31:31] oh father what a god we serve
[2:31:35] what almighty god we self
[2:31:39] praise the lord
[2:31:42] what a mighty god we serve
[2:31:51] amen
[2:31:54] i'm trying to cut this thing down i will
[2:31:56] come back to it though but i'm trying to
[2:31:57] cut it down a little bit here
[2:32:00] so i mean i've i've bored you already
[2:32:02] i've kept you too long
[2:32:06] amen
[2:32:16] you love the lord
[2:32:26] oh praise the lord jesus
[2:32:29] what a wonderful father you are
[2:32:31] you are so god
[2:32:34] i just want to read this promise what
[2:32:37] the holy spirit wrote concerning you
[2:32:40] concerning this bride
[2:32:43] praise the lord
[2:32:45] because we have to realize that the
[2:32:47] fullness of the bride came under the
[2:32:48] teleport
[2:32:50] the opening of the word
[2:32:53] under the first pull there was just
[2:32:55] signs and wonders
[2:32:57] amen
[2:32:58] praying laying hands on the sick and
[2:33:00] people being healed
[2:33:02] under the second pulled it was
[2:33:04] discernment and the rebuking of spirits
[2:33:08] opening of the word
[2:33:11] the releasing of christ
[2:33:13] the breaking of the seals
[2:33:19] introduce us to our bridegroom
[2:33:23] introduce us
[2:33:25] to the lover of our soul
[2:33:28] that's the reason why there is nothing
[2:33:30] that is important in this church
[2:33:33] than the word of god
[2:33:35] there is nothing that is above the word
[2:33:38] not anybody
[2:33:40] that is above the word
[2:33:44] and we want the world to have its
[2:33:46] preeminence
[2:33:48] praise the lord
[2:33:50] has his preeminence have his first place
[2:33:55] ruling our life
[2:34:05] glory be to god
[2:34:06] are we together
[2:34:09] amen
[2:34:13] oh
[2:34:14] my mine
[2:34:17] just bear with me how did i have this
[2:34:19] thing all scattered all over the place
[2:34:22] and uh
[2:34:25] that's what kind of caught me into two
[2:34:26] things this morning because i had a
[2:34:28] message that i was studying to preach on
[2:34:31] and then
[2:34:32] i already had a subject of my mind and
[2:34:35] you know
[2:34:36] the holy spirit started dealing with me
[2:34:37] last night about the importance of the
[2:34:40] word that has been given to us
[2:34:44] praise the lord
[2:34:45] so now that i'm caught i mean you know
[2:34:47] i'm caught between these things and so i
[2:34:50] just have my thoughts all scattered over
[2:34:52] the places
[2:34:53] praise the lord
[2:34:55] let me get back here to my original
[2:34:56] source maybe it might help me have it
[2:34:58] right there in my noting it's uh
[2:35:02] praise the lord
[2:35:03] what a wonderful jesus
[2:35:06] we serve
[2:35:08] amen
[2:35:11] what a wonderful jesus we serve
[2:35:15] praise the lord
[2:35:17] a god
[2:35:19] a god
[2:35:21] that knows you
[2:35:23] amen
[2:35:26] he knows our uprising
[2:35:29] he knows our down setting
[2:35:33] there is nothing
[2:35:36] that can be heard from him
[2:35:39] praise the lord
[2:35:41] that's the lord god that we serve
[2:35:43] nothing can be heard from him
[2:35:52] praise the lord
[2:35:55] water jesus we self
[2:35:58] amen
[2:36:24] that's what happened to me all the time
[2:36:27] the thing staring right before my eyes
[2:36:29] and i can see it
[2:36:33] he speaks
[2:36:34] here
[2:36:36] about what will be the harmony
[2:36:38] between the son
[2:36:40] and the father
[2:36:42] praise the lord
[2:36:44] the harmony that is going to exist
[2:36:46] between christ and his bride
[2:36:55] i will take it from right here
[2:36:57] i pray the holy spirit will just help me
[2:36:59] now
[2:37:01] honor this statement i wonder if
[2:37:04] we sufficiently impress with the word in
[2:37:07] our midst
[2:37:08] let me give you a taught year
[2:37:12] how
[2:37:13] do we pray do we pray in jesus name
[2:37:17] i mean we prayed in jesus name don't we
[2:37:20] every prayer is in the name in his name
[2:37:22] or there is no answer
[2:37:27] this is the confidence that we have
[2:37:30] that's what john said that when we ask
[2:37:33] anything i call into his will
[2:37:35] he hearing us
[2:37:37] and if we and and and if
[2:37:41] we know that he hear us whatsoever
[2:37:45] we know
[2:37:47] that we have
[2:37:49] the petition that we desire
[2:37:51] now we ask what is the word of god
[2:37:55] there is only one way to know his will
[2:37:59] and that is by the word of god
[2:38:02] praise the lord
[2:38:04] amen
[2:38:05] there is one way to know god's will
[2:38:10] it's not how you feel
[2:38:11] it's not what you think
[2:38:13] you got to bring it back to the word of
[2:38:15] god
[2:38:16] because lamentation 3
[2:38:18] verse 37 says
[2:38:20] who is he that seareth and it cometh to
[2:38:24] pass
[2:38:26] when the lord commanded it not right
[2:38:32] praise the lord
[2:38:33] who is he that said or hope
[2:38:35] or think or desire and it cometh to pass
[2:38:39] when god do not
[2:38:41] command it
[2:38:43] there it is
[2:38:45] if it is is in the word
[2:38:47] you can have it
[2:38:50] so
[2:38:52] we can ask unless it is the word
[2:38:57] praise the lord
[2:39:00] praise the lord
[2:39:03] amen
[2:39:07] we've got to get away from day so as i
[2:39:09] would not i would not
[2:39:12] finish water i would not be able to do
[2:39:15] what i'm supposed to do here
[2:39:21] oh what a mighty god we serve
[2:39:25] yes
[2:39:31] yeah it is i'm trying to say the lord of
[2:39:34] reproduction is that every
[2:39:38] species bring forth after a kind
[2:39:40] according to genesis 1 11
[2:39:42] god said let the earth bring full gries
[2:39:45] and the herb yelling seeds
[2:39:47] and the fruit trees yelling fruit after
[2:39:50] he comes who sees his inner self upon
[2:39:52] the earth
[2:39:54] whatever life was in the seed comes
[2:39:57] forth
[2:39:59] into the plain
[2:40:02] and hence
[2:40:04] the fruit the very same apply
[2:40:08] told the church today whatever sea
[2:40:10] started the church
[2:40:12] will come forth
[2:40:14] and be like the original sea because
[2:40:19] it is the same seed
[2:40:22] praise the lord
[2:40:24] that's that's the reason why we don't
[2:40:25] start a church on confusion
[2:40:28] you don't start a church on division
[2:40:30] either
[2:40:31] you got to be
[2:40:33] pure in your motives
[2:40:36] praise the lord
[2:40:37] you don't build your family
[2:40:40] on anger and vestation and hatred and
[2:40:42] all of that no
[2:40:44] because you are planting a seed
[2:40:48] you always in everything you do
[2:40:51] keep the seed principle in your mind
[2:40:55] because your beginning in everything is
[2:40:58] the seed that you are planting
[2:41:01] and the seed that you plant that's what
[2:41:03] we grow
[2:41:10] god works with c principle
[2:41:17] if we will begin with god we must begin
[2:41:19] on the word
[2:41:21] we must come back to the word
[2:41:25] most people
[2:41:27] miscall this scripture
[2:41:30] romans chapter 12 be not transformed
[2:41:34] or be not conformed to this word
[2:41:37] but be transformed
[2:41:39] by the renewing of your mind you can
[2:41:41] renew your own mind
[2:41:44] no that's not what the scripture is
[2:41:46] saying the scripture is not giving you
[2:41:48] the power for you to transform your life
[2:41:49] no
[2:41:52] because you can't transform your life
[2:41:57] the transforming power is in the seed
[2:42:02] praise the lord
[2:42:04] so don't be conformed to this word be
[2:42:06] transformed by what putting your mind on
[2:42:10] the
[2:42:10] word
[2:42:12] looking for the promises
[2:42:15] god you said i will be healed
[2:42:17] lord is written in your word i will be
[2:42:19] delivered father is in your word no
[2:42:22] principalities
[2:42:23] or
[2:42:24] power
[2:42:26] why you are being transformed by that
[2:42:28] word you are embracing what the promised
[2:42:31] world have said
[2:42:33] it's not you trying to shake your mouth
[2:42:35] oh no i don't want to lost your lasting
[2:42:36] demon leave my head
[2:42:38] you're giving yourself headache
[2:42:45] but it's taking what god says in his
[2:42:47] word
[2:42:48] you are renewing your mind by accepting
[2:42:50] the promise of
[2:42:52] god and saying amen to the word of god
[2:43:00] because the transforming power
[2:43:02] is in the seed
[2:43:04] the seed has the power
[2:43:08] praise the lord
[2:43:09] it can be a very simple seed of truth
[2:43:13] it can be a simple seed
[2:43:16] of earnesty
[2:43:19] that was what joseph planted
[2:43:21] in egypt
[2:43:24] he planted a seed
[2:43:26] of earnesty
[2:43:28] in the house of podecop
[2:43:30] amen
[2:43:35] he planted that seed and i mean to wash
[2:43:37] his life
[2:43:40] and when that seed grew
[2:43:42] even though he had to go to prison he
[2:43:44] had to dig in the dirt
[2:43:47] planet has ruled down
[2:43:49] but when they grew it became the second
[2:43:51] man in egypt
[2:43:57] when you put the seed in the earth
[2:44:00] the earth possessed the seed
[2:44:03] the earth try to
[2:44:05] treat the sea whatever way it can
[2:44:09] but when that sea comes up
[2:44:12] and start to spread its root
[2:44:15] then it possesses the earth
[2:44:18] praise the lord
[2:44:20] god put his seat down here
[2:44:23] we were born in sin
[2:44:24] we went to the bar we went in
[2:44:26] fornication we went in lying carrying
[2:44:28] the seed of god everywhere
[2:44:30] when the light of god of this earth
[2:44:32] flash on that sea
[2:44:34] and that sea starts to come up
[2:44:37] now that sea is possessing this earth
[2:44:40] the earth wants to carry he said no
[2:44:42] you're not going in a word because now
[2:44:44] i'm in possession of this earth
[2:44:46] [Applause]
[2:44:52] the seed is now possessing this earth
[2:44:55] this earth don't have no control
[2:44:57] praise the lord
[2:45:00] amen
[2:45:02] they can strip themselves naked the sea
[2:45:04] said turn this way
[2:45:05] look this way you look to cavalry
[2:45:09] [Applause]
[2:45:14] the seed take the desire of this word
[2:45:16] it take the desire of lusting the desire
[2:45:19] of drinking the desire of smoking and
[2:45:22] every desire of sin
[2:45:25] praise the lord
[2:45:26] and why are we keeping this body the sea
[2:45:28] is working
[2:45:29] working to bring every member of our
[2:45:32] body in obedience to god's word because
[2:45:35] the sea has possessed this earth
[2:45:37] [Applause]
[2:45:40] praise the lord
[2:45:41] and one day
[2:45:43] you might be dead buried in the grave
[2:45:46] to arches
[2:45:48] the seed will come back
[2:45:50] and say come on buddy
[2:45:51] come on let's go to the resurrection
[2:45:54] the sea will call you from the grave
[2:45:57] i said come on let's go to the
[2:45:58] resurrection
[2:45:59] [Laughter]
[2:46:01] and your body is bound to obey the word
[2:46:05] of god
[2:46:09] [Music]
[2:46:14] the bible says we are born of the
[2:46:16] incorruptable seed
[2:46:18] which is the word of god that's the new
[2:46:20] birth it's not church membership
[2:46:23] it's a birth that comes by the word of
[2:46:25] god
[2:46:26] and
[2:46:27] and until you have it never be satisfied
[2:46:31] until you have a birth that comes by the
[2:46:34] word of god

[2:46:40] praise the lord
[2:46:42] amen don't ever be satisfied
[2:46:45] don't take a church membership
[2:46:49] praise the lord
[2:46:54] are we impressed
[2:46:58] with the word
[2:47:00] that is in our midst

[2:48:16] and write
[2:48:19] and he started to write
[2:48:21] out of inspiration
[2:48:24] he says just like there was a harmony
[2:48:26] between the father and the son
[2:48:28] there will be a harmony
[2:48:30] between christ
[2:48:32] and his bride
[2:48:34] praise the lord
[2:48:36] just like mary said
[2:48:38] be it unto me
[2:48:40] i call into your word
[2:48:42] he says this end time bride
[2:48:45] will not submit herself
[2:48:48] to man's doctrine
