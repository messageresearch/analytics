[35:48] musicians play
[35:57] yes
[36:02] [Music]
[36:24] um
[36:34] you know i was talking to naomi and
[36:37] rochelle last
[36:38] night and they're talking this morning
[36:41] too that
[36:42] you know brother branham's life story
[36:44] remember how he got so
[36:45] desperate you know billy paul of course
[36:49] his wife was gone and his
[36:50] little daughter sharon rose the lord had
[36:53] taken them home and
[36:55] brother branham was really just about
[36:57] beside himself and
[36:59] and of course billy paul is just a
[37:01] little boy and he'd say i wanted my mama
[37:04] and my brother brad who could bring her
[37:06] back
[37:07] and then one day he said i s look at
[37:10] i saw him i see mama she's up on that
[37:12] cloud
[37:15] that the lord allowed billy paul to see
[37:17] his mother up on a cloud
[37:19] and of course brother branham you know
[37:22] you know the little
[37:23] money that was for the christmas fund
[37:25] for sharon rose
[37:27] came from the bank and he was just so
[37:29] tore up to the point where he got
[37:31] the place where he took his gun and
[37:34] kneeled by
[37:35] his bunk and was going to take his own
[37:37] life
[37:39] and of course you know the story how
[37:41] that all of a sudden the lord just
[37:45] he talked about it as a dream but i
[37:47] believe that the lord allowed him to
[37:48] step into that other dimension
[37:51] and there was a young woman standing
[37:52] there at the covered wagon
[37:54] and the wheel was broken saints
[37:56] [Music]
[37:59] and of course he was saw the beautiful
[38:01] young woman said how do you do
[38:03] he says how how do you do dad hi dad
[38:07] dad you're almost as old as i am
[38:11] he says i'm not
[38:14] little girls are not little girls over
[38:16] here
[38:18] and how that mama's waiting for you up
[38:22] at your mansion
[38:23] and of course she went running up the
[38:25] steps to the mansion
[38:27] she met him at the door and of course
[38:30] she brought him in and
[38:33] a little easy chair that he had a nice
[38:36] little
[38:36] comfortable chair he says you remember
[38:39] that chair that you had
[38:41] i said remember they had to pay payments
[38:43] on it
[38:44] couldn't make the payment one day the
[38:46] chair was gone
[38:48] but she told him says it's paid for over
[38:52] here
[38:54] think about that saying god
[38:58] even the littlest thing like a chair
[39:02] that's how much he cares he knows
[39:05] exactly each and every one of you this
[39:07] morning
[39:07] listen to my voice now he knows the
[39:11] littlest thing in your life
[39:14] he can speak a word to you this morning
[39:17] every day whether you're here in the
[39:19] church building or whether you're at
[39:21] home
[39:22] he can drop something in that will be so
[39:24] personal
[39:26] just to you nobody else would even know
[39:28] what
[39:29] what he's talking about it's personal to
[39:31] you
[39:33] oh my saints he's so personal
[39:37] [Music]
[39:38] so as we approach his throne of
[39:41] mercy this morning let's look for him
[39:46] to speak to us individually

[56:25] here one time
[56:26] she's up in the fargo area somewhere
[56:28] there
[56:30] and
[56:34] i got a call during the weekend he
[56:35] wanted to see me
[56:37] and he came over to see me at the church
[56:39] we had a good talk
[56:42] and he just had this desire
[56:45] to get back to god amen
[56:53] well i told him i said i says well
[56:56] i mean it's it's a good thing i don't
[56:58] think
[57:00] i didn't send you an invitation praise
[57:03] the lord
[57:04] it's good when god is dealing with a
[57:05] man's heart amen
[57:07] then you are putting church pressure i
[57:10] think we have passed uh
[57:12] that place in our walk where we don't
[57:15] put church pressure on people
[57:17] you know it's the most horrible pressure
[57:21] to put on any man church pressure
[57:25] praise the lord if you're putting church
[57:27] pressure on your children's topic
[57:29] because it's the most horrible pressure
[57:32] to put on anybody
[57:34] amen and so we had a good talk and
[57:38] and i knew he was around i heard he was
[57:41] around
[57:42] and i spoke with him once because there
[57:46] was another
[57:47] friend of his that came from australia a
[57:48] couple of years ago to visit with me
[57:51] and they were all together many of them
[57:54] and so we spoke and then he came in
[57:59] we had a good talk and we had time to
[58:02] pray then
[58:03] and to encourage him and uh
[58:08] tell him that he's welcome back praise
[58:10] the lord
[58:11] so he will need all your prayers and and
[58:14] support and encouragement that we can
[58:16] give him
[58:17] praise the lord jesus we just thank the
[58:20] lord for
[58:20] that amen
[58:24] and uh
[58:30] there was something on my mind again i
[58:31] wanted to talk about
[58:33] well brothers where our meeting after
[58:36] service
[58:37] let's put it to the next sunday that
[58:40] would be
[58:41] be fitting there are few things that i
[58:43] want for us to cover will not be able to

[58:47] in the meeting today so let's just put
[58:50] it over
[58:51] to next sunday praise the lord so next
[58:54] sunday after service
[58:56] we will meet with the brothers amen
[59:02] and so let's let's stand on our feet
[59:07] uh i want to i want to temper it into
[59:11] something
[59:12] that's a little bit historical and
[59:16] history but it's it's all it's all
[59:20] good i'm praying that the lord will put
[59:21] his blessing upon it
[59:23] uh i was reading something in uh
[59:26] in isaiah chapter 50
[59:30] and it kind of cut my mind it drew me to
[59:32] this subject
[59:34] thank you musicians thank you sorry
[59:38] uh that's what happened you put us in
[59:41] the spirit and then we forget about you
[59:47] amen praise the lord
[59:50] we want to thank the lord for the
[59:52] musicians thank you very scared for
[59:53] stepping in this morning
[59:55] and and and just bringing us to the
[59:59] throne of grace
[1:00:00] that was beautiful amen that was
[1:00:03] beautiful
[1:00:06] jeremiah chapter 6 jeremiah chapter 6.
[1:00:10] i had a few scriptures to
[1:00:14] to cover uh this morning
[1:00:18] but i want you to pay very very keen
[1:00:21] attention
[1:00:22] uh i believe we are living in the day
[1:00:25] where even san may clear by prophecy
[1:00:28] i believe we are living in the days
[1:00:30] where prophecy
[1:00:32] is growing so fast that we we we may not
[1:00:35] be able to catch up with it amen
[1:00:37] don't run after it because you will not
[1:00:39] catch up you have to believe that god is
[1:00:41] doing it
[1:00:42] amen praise the lord it's the time that
[1:00:45] we are living in
[1:00:46] it's the time and the season that we are
[1:00:48] living in and i believe
[1:00:50] you know like uh but branham said in
[1:00:53] in the message invisible union he says
[1:00:56] there will be a message that would come
[1:00:57] and sweep the bride
[1:00:59] into the rapture now it's not coming
[1:01:02] it's not a message
[1:01:03] that there will be a new messenger that
[1:01:05] will rise on the scene
[1:01:07] but it will be the time word the bride
[1:01:09] will be making
[1:01:11] i mean we will be putting emphasis on
[1:01:13] the time that we are living in
[1:01:15] i believe we have gone past the time of
[1:01:17] the pentecostal
[1:01:18] season if you are expecting me to come
[1:01:21] here and expect me to start preaching
[1:01:23] and don't wear makeup and don't
[1:01:24] have fornication god forbid forget about
[1:01:27] it amen
[1:01:28] praise the lord if you count me out not
[1:01:30] to be a preacher because i'm not
[1:01:32] preaching that forget about it we have a
[1:01:34] message
[1:01:35] to get ourselves ready for a rapture
[1:01:37] praise the lord
[1:01:38] if you don't know that those things are
[1:01:40] not right then you have to come to the
[1:01:43] altar
[1:01:43] have an experience with god praise the
[1:01:45] lord amen
[1:01:52] jeremiah chapter 6.
[1:01:55] let's read from verse 16. thus said the
[1:01:59] lord
[1:02:00] stand ye in the way and see
[1:02:04] and ask for the old path
[1:02:08] amen we need the old path praise the
[1:02:12] lord
[1:02:12] and that's the reason why i thank god
[1:02:15] for giving us the prayer meetings that
[1:02:17] we've been having wednesday night
[1:02:19] i mean it's been beautiful amen the
[1:02:21] first night we went 30 minutes last
[1:02:23] wednesday we went almost an
[1:02:25] hour we can break the sound barrier amen
[1:02:28] i believe we can break the sound barrier
[1:02:30] i believe that we can pray and get lost
[1:02:33] in the spirit and have people running
[1:02:36] all over the place
[1:02:37] shouting over their head i'm looking for
[1:02:39] that amen
[1:02:40] i'm looking for where people will turn
[1:02:42] looks and
[1:02:43] cry out to god amen
[1:02:46] now we are asking for the old path where
[1:02:50] is the good way and walk there in
[1:02:54] ask for the old path where is the good
[1:02:57] way
[1:02:57] and walk there in and ye shall find
[1:03:00] rest for your soul praise the lord
[1:03:03] but they say we will not walk there in
[1:03:07] you know people don't want that
[1:03:09] old-fashioned experience
[1:03:11] they want to hear prosperity gospel they
[1:03:13] want to hear
[1:03:14] you know things that would tickle their
[1:03:16] ear conspiracy theory
[1:03:18] praise the lord god delivered me from
[1:03:20] there amen i said deliver me from there
[1:03:23] if i don't have nothing to preach i will
[1:03:25] play a tape for you amen
[1:03:27] i'm not going to gather a bunch of
[1:03:28] garbage from the internet and come and
[1:03:30] tell you this is this and this is
[1:03:31] all of those things amen
[1:03:35] are we together praise the lord
[1:03:39] but they said we will now walk there in
[1:03:42] also a set watchman over you
[1:03:46] prophet ministry fightful ministry

[1:03:53] of the trumpet but they said
[1:03:57] we were not yet king therefore

[1:04:04] sequence

[1:04:09] therefore years ye nations

[1:06:16] i want i want to read this to you and
[1:06:19] and i will take my mind now
[1:06:24] i will take my thoughts from there this
[1:06:27] morning
[1:06:29] making a way making the way
[1:06:33] this code here for the message making
[1:06:36] the way
[1:06:39] i use that in kind of for later
[1:06:42] background
[1:06:43] for what i want to share with you and i
[1:06:46] predicted
[1:06:49] i don't say this is the law saying
[1:06:53] this now i'm predicting that this year
[1:06:58] america will receive
[1:07:02] christ or rejected
[1:07:06] praise the lord amen
[1:07:18] america will receive christ or rejected
[1:07:22] i'm getting the little echo i'm thinking
[1:07:27] if somebody's talking behind me
[1:07:31] okay i think i'm the one talking so
[1:07:37] let me read that again i'm predicting
[1:07:38] that this year this is 1956.
[1:07:42] this is 1956. i'm predicting that this
[1:07:46] year america will receive christ
[1:07:49] or rejected see i believe
[1:07:52] this will be the turning point now i
[1:07:55] want to talk on the turning point
[1:07:58] uh uh that's that's the way i uh uh
[1:08:01] titled my message 1956 the turning point
[1:08:03] of america
[1:08:06] praise the lord now you got to listen to
[1:08:09] me very carefully many of us even myself
[1:08:12] were not born in 1956 and
[1:08:15] uh but what is important here is that
[1:08:20] uh this
[1:08:23] generation and the children that are
[1:08:27] born in this generation
[1:08:28] almost like the kids that are born now
[1:08:32] uh uh born in 2000 and and i mean 2020
[1:08:36] and uh you know the ones that will be
[1:08:39] turning one year
[1:08:40] they will all be born i mean i mean
[1:08:43] they're all born and as they grow
[1:08:45] they will now realize that
[1:08:50] we are very matched
[1:08:54] now so those kids will think that
[1:08:58] from the day that man was created they
[1:09:00] would wear rematch
[1:09:06] praise the lord amen because they are
[1:09:09] born into the word
[1:09:10] and and when they start to recognize
[1:09:13] their parent they just see these funny
[1:09:14] things around their face
[1:09:17] and if max wearing stay little longer
[1:09:23] that little generation or little kids
[1:09:26] would just think
[1:09:27] that's the way it has been
[1:09:30] praise the lord amen
[1:09:34] and pretty soon when they start reading
[1:09:36] their bible they might actually did adam
[1:09:38] war max
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:41] now it's it's sounding funny but
[1:09:45] i'm saying that to grab your attention
[1:09:48] here
[1:09:49] because this word has not always been
[1:09:53] like this
[1:09:53] right all the riot that we have seen the
[1:09:57] violence
[1:09:58] that we are exposed to that i mean
[1:10:01] and the declining of the church it had
[1:10:04] it was not always that way
[1:10:06] but you see coming into an age where
[1:10:10] you see things the way it is you think
[1:10:13] that is the normal way that it's
[1:10:15] supposed to be
[1:10:19] praise the lord
[1:10:23] we think that is the normal way that
[1:10:25] it's supposed to be
[1:10:28] but things has not always been like that
[1:10:32] amen are we together
[1:10:48] so that's that's the reason why there
[1:10:51] there is there
[1:10:52] there have always been a time where
[1:10:56] dispensation has come to its junction
[1:11:00] praise the lord nations have come to his
[1:11:03] junction it would be strange to you
[1:11:05] if you look on the on the on the index
[1:11:08] you'll find
[1:11:09] that 1956 was when brother brandon
[1:11:12] preached the junction of time
[1:11:16] because it also have to do with the
[1:11:18] turning point
[1:11:20] sure it was where he says we are
[1:11:23] standing
[1:11:24] on the threshing flow of the greatness
[1:11:30] of of unimportance right
[1:11:34] praise the lord amen there are few
[1:11:36] things that
[1:11:37] i'll bring to you but i want to i want
[1:11:39] to grab your
[1:11:40] wrap your attention on this because uh
[1:11:44] uh
[1:11:47] you know it might it might sound
[1:11:51] to you like uh history what are we
[1:11:53] talking about 1956 in 2021
[1:11:57] praise the lord
[1:12:01] but if you follow me a little bit you'll
[1:12:02] be able to understand
[1:12:04] some of the things that we will be
[1:12:07] pointing to you
[1:12:08] so i predict that this year america will
[1:12:10] receive christ or reject it
[1:12:13] see i believe this will be the
[1:12:16] turning point that america will go in
[1:12:20] we will have a revival
[1:12:23] this year or we won't have a revival
[1:12:29] now think about it think about it in the
[1:12:32] context
[1:12:33] of the acceptable year because we're
[1:12:35] coming right into the jubilee
[1:12:36] that's what we're coming into so think
[1:12:38] about it
[1:12:40] when when jesus said this is your day of
[1:12:42] visitation
[1:12:44] amen praise the lord if you
[1:12:47] accept it
[1:12:50] you can get the blessing of it that's
[1:12:53] right
[1:12:54] the danger there is to put it aside
[1:12:57] now that i'm standing here uh
[1:13:02] okay and then uh uh
[1:13:08] genesis chapter 27 i want to take my
[1:13:11] time i have a lot of scriptures
[1:13:12] because i want to build this in a way
[1:13:15] that you'll be able to understand it
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:18] not just to to bring you know all of the
[1:13:21] cults and
[1:13:22] and all of the lecture to you but i want
[1:13:25] to make this very personal to you
[1:13:28] praise the lord genesis 27 34
[1:13:31] the bible says here
[1:13:34] [Music]
[1:13:43] now the story here is that jacob has
[1:13:46] already got the blessing
[1:13:48] and then ether has returned from the
[1:13:50] field
[1:13:51] he prepared the meal and now he's going
[1:13:53] to his father
[1:13:55] to give his father the meal teddy 3 and
[1:13:58] isaac trembled very exceedingly and said
[1:14:01] whoa
[1:14:02] where is he that have taken venison
[1:14:05] and brought it to me and i have eaten
[1:14:10] of all before thou came it and have
[1:14:13] blessed him
[1:14:14] ye and he shall be
[1:14:18] blessed and when easter heard the words
[1:14:21] of his father
[1:14:23] he cried with a great and exciting
[1:14:26] bitter crying and said unto his father
[1:14:30] bless me
[1:14:32] even me also oh my father
[1:14:36] and he said my brother came in socialite
[1:14:40] and have taken away that blessing hebrew
[1:14:44] chapter 12. hebrew chapter 12.
[1:14:49] now if you look at that jacob
[1:14:53] i mean he's a play down the breath right
[1:14:57] you have to realize the breath right is
[1:14:59] tied to the blessing
[1:15:02] amen the breath right is tied to the
[1:15:04] blessing
[1:15:06] praise the lord amen
[1:15:09] repent is tied to the holy ghost
[1:15:14] you can't get the holy ghost if you
[1:15:16] don't want to repent
[1:15:20] are we together hebrew chapter 12.
[1:15:26] just want to grab your attention here
[1:15:30] so we can be able to
[1:15:33] find a place here
[1:15:39] hebrew chapter 2 verse 16
[1:15:43] the bible says least there be any
[1:15:46] fornicator or preferring person as
[1:15:49] easter who for a muscle of meat
[1:15:52] saw his breath right
[1:15:55] for you know how that afterwards
[1:15:58] when he would have inherited the
[1:16:01] blessing
[1:16:01] he was rejected so you see because he
[1:16:05] played down the birthright
[1:16:08] he was rejected from the blessing
[1:16:12] amen now if you go back to the story
[1:16:15] it looks like he's i mean jacob
[1:16:17] deceiving
[1:16:18] and rebecca they all play this out but
[1:16:21] paul
[1:16:22] by inspiration is telling us
[1:16:25] because he played down the breath right
[1:16:29] he was rejected from the blessing
[1:16:35] are we together amen
[1:16:40] and
[1:16:44] when he will inherit the blessing he was
[1:16:47] rejected
[1:16:49] for he found no place of repentance
[1:16:52] he found no place of repentance
[1:16:56] it was not in him
[1:17:02] amen it was not in him
[1:17:07] though he sucked it carefully with tears
[1:17:12] he cried and he cried and he cried and
[1:17:16] he cried
[1:17:17] and there was just no place it was not
[1:17:19] in him
[1:17:21] are we together do you realize
[1:17:24] that's what weeping has gone from the
[1:17:28] church
[1:17:31] it has gone from the church
[1:17:35] people don't come on a conviction to
[1:17:37] weep
[1:17:42] praise the lord amen we can argue our
[1:17:44] way through our wrong
[1:17:47] we can get scriptures and call to back
[1:17:49] ourselves what this is right just to
[1:17:51] justify ourselves
[1:17:59] praise the lord
[1:18:07] amen so uh
[1:18:10] it's it's it's almost like in jesus word
[1:18:13] he says recognize the day of your
[1:18:15] visitation
[1:18:17] praise the lord and like i've always
[1:18:20] said
[1:18:21] from here if god is dealing with your
[1:18:23] heart
[1:18:24] you must count it a treasure
[1:18:27] and you must make use of that
[1:18:31] you must make use of that
[1:18:37] you don't know how many words church
[1:18:40] life has just become a fun memory today
[1:18:46] praise the lord amen it becomes a
[1:18:49] foreign memory and even some
[1:18:51] struggle to even they don't even want to
[1:18:53] remember those days
[1:18:56] it's not because it was not real because
[1:18:58] they realized
[1:18:59] they had gone too far for me
[1:19:03] and there is no way to trace their way
[1:19:06] back
[1:19:10] there is no way to trace their way back
[1:19:18] sleeping and having a dream in a revival
[1:19:21] at the altar they will stream from their
[1:19:23] sleep
[1:19:26] because of the conviction that it brings
[1:19:28] to them
[1:19:30] sisters that treasure long hair cutting
[1:19:33] their heads shut
[1:19:35] even boiling it on the side and doing
[1:19:37] all sorts of things
[1:19:40] getting away from decency just to just
[1:19:43] to fit into the supe
[1:19:45] to the present uh uh the tolerating
[1:19:48] society
[1:19:56] praise the lord
[1:20:00] so let's let's go with this let's go
[1:20:02] with this
[1:20:05] now just to give you a little background
[1:20:09] which of course we will get we we will
[1:20:12] grab
[1:20:12] it but uh
[1:20:16] 1956 was 50 years
[1:20:19] from 1906. so 1956
[1:20:24] was a jubilee from the pentecostal
[1:20:26] revival
[1:20:31] amen 1956 was a jubilee
[1:20:35] from the pentecostal revival and that
[1:20:37] pentecostal revival
[1:20:39] that's the reason why a church life is
[1:20:41] the way
[1:20:42] it is you know they are there i mean
[1:20:44] there are many that are in church and
[1:20:46] different churches and different
[1:20:48] you know denomination they don't even
[1:20:50] know the history
[1:20:51] of their church you know i mean they
[1:20:54] they've been married all of their life
[1:20:56] for catholic or you know
[1:20:58] uh you know or even lutheran and you
[1:21:01] don't even know the history
[1:21:03] how did that church how did that
[1:21:05] organization was called lutron
[1:21:07] i mean where did it started from
[1:21:10] praise the law but what happened is
[1:21:14] there 1906 god
[1:21:17] visited his people
[1:21:21] with the gift of the spirit
[1:21:26] in azusa in california
[1:21:30] there was the moving of the spirit we
[1:21:32] know that god
[1:21:33] dared with the church he dealt with his
[1:21:35] people true looter
[1:21:40] amen
[1:21:42] bringing them out of the dark teachings
[1:21:45] of catholicism
[1:21:48] praise the lord
[1:21:53] and then after that in germany
[1:21:56] the holy spirit moved over to england
[1:21:59] john wesley
[1:22:00] he brought the the the revival of
[1:22:04] sanctification
[1:22:09] i was named after him and uh uh
[1:22:12] called the meredith group which of
[1:22:15] course
[1:22:16] they have gone far from the end praise
[1:22:19] the lord
[1:22:21] we have gone far from there because i'm
[1:22:24] a methodist
[1:22:27] praise the lord amen
[1:22:35] but god was bringing the gift of the
[1:22:37] spirit
[1:22:39] to to his church to his people
[1:22:44] and
[1:22:48] and he visited them on azusa when
[1:22:51] when once again the church had
[1:22:54] the same experience like how it was
[1:22:59] in the book of acts praise the lord
[1:23:02] the gift of the spirit broke among the
[1:23:04] people they spoke in tongues the
[1:23:06] prophesied
[1:23:07] they received interpretation and it was
[1:23:09] just told the god
[1:23:14] praise the lord amen amen that song
[1:23:18] that comfort is here it has a big
[1:23:21] history in that movement
[1:23:28] the holy ghost from heaven the comforter
[1:23:31] is here
[1:23:33] now so that was 50 years from there
[1:23:36] and uh so
[1:23:40] that is the reason why it is set up
[1:23:43] a junction of time
[1:23:48] are we together it's set up a junction
[1:23:50] of time there's a lot of information
[1:23:52] here
[1:23:53] i'm trying to to to share there for for
[1:23:56] the young people
[1:23:57] and uh
[1:24:03] because i call into uh leviticus chapter
[1:24:07] 25
[1:24:09] i call into leviticus chapter 25 we get
[1:24:12] there to read that a little bit
[1:24:14] we realize that israel had
[1:24:18] a mono jubilee of every seven years
[1:24:23] amen every seven years they were
[1:24:26] supposed to give the land
[1:24:28] a time to rest
[1:24:31] amen they were supposed to give the land
[1:24:33] a time to rest i would come back to that
[1:24:36] there was a mono jubilee and they had a
[1:24:39] major jubilee
[1:24:40] that came every 50 years so after
[1:24:44] after seven seven then comes
[1:24:47] their jubilee which was the major
[1:24:49] jubilee
[1:24:50] uh of of of a restoration of everything
[1:24:54] that they have lost
[1:24:55] right the lord
[1:24:58] amen now you think about this god
[1:25:02] give them a uh a
[1:25:05] a a tiny jubilee a tiny little let me
[1:25:09] call it like that we have a minor and a
[1:25:12] major but a very tiny
[1:25:14] that after every sixth day the seventh
[1:25:17] day
[1:25:18] they must rest
[1:25:21] amen and that was like a sabbath to them
[1:25:26] praise the lord amen
[1:25:30] i'm coming to death also it's all part
[1:25:32] of
[1:25:33] the sequence that we're going to deal
[1:25:34] with here because it's
[1:25:36] it's it's very important you know the
[1:25:39] church
[1:25:40] the church taking on you know uh
[1:25:43] uh uh the the teachings the
[1:25:46] understanding
[1:25:47] of what the sabbath is the true sabbath
[1:25:50] that is not in the literal day is in
[1:25:55] the holy ghost bring that true rest to
[1:25:57] us has
[1:25:58] also misplaced the church
[1:26:02] because people think that it is it is
[1:26:05] the holy ghost
[1:26:06] you know the rest is the holy ghost so
[1:26:08] because of that
[1:26:10] you know they don't even get rest
[1:26:15] you don't even set a time aside
[1:26:20] praise the lord
[1:26:24] a true sign that you have the holy ghost
[1:26:27] you will give you will give that rest
[1:26:31] amen your your your sabbath will not be
[1:26:34] in the observation of a day
[1:26:38] or ceremony like it was in the jewish
[1:26:40] custom
[1:26:42] for your true sabbath you have a time
[1:26:46] rest where you can spend with the lord
[1:26:48] you can spend with your family
[1:26:50] you can cease from work
[1:26:59] and we together so god gave them there
[1:27:03] it was the seventh thing and he gave
[1:27:06] them
[1:27:07] the seventh year that when it comes to
[1:27:10] the seventh year
[1:27:12] every six years you can talk the sword
[1:27:14] you can plan
[1:27:15] dig the ground plan i will bless it by
[1:27:18] the seventh year
[1:27:19] leave the land don't don't don't tell
[1:27:22] the ground don't touch it
[1:27:26] as we look at this you will see the
[1:27:28] importance of it as we go along
[1:27:30] but you will realize because israel
[1:27:32] strayed away from god
[1:27:34] they went into the days of the headings
[1:27:38] they broke god's sabbath his seventh day
[1:27:41] they did not respect
[1:27:42] it they broke his law they did not
[1:27:44] respect it the seventh year to give the
[1:27:47] land is rest
[1:27:49] god said i will get it you're going to
[1:27:52] go
[1:27:52] 70 years
[1:27:56] i would rather keep the land in
[1:27:58] desolation
[1:27:59] so it can rest than to have you there
[1:28:02] abusing my lord
[1:28:11] and that's what happened when you don't
[1:28:12] get this land rest
[1:28:16] praise the lord if you don't give rest
[1:28:21] please praise the lord
[1:28:26] i can go into a lot of things here but
[1:28:28] he that have ears let him hear what the
[1:28:30] spirit says to the church
[1:28:32] amen and they had
[1:28:39] 49 years because
[1:28:42] the true sense of the jubilee was israel
[1:28:46] possession
[1:28:46] everything they had was given to them by
[1:28:50] god
[1:28:51] and i will say to you this morning that
[1:28:54] is god's principle everything you have
[1:28:58] is given to you by god
[1:29:01] as a child of god you better recognize
[1:29:04] that
[1:29:07] that everything you have is given to you
[1:29:10] by god
[1:29:14] and if it is given to you by god it
[1:29:16] belongs to god
[1:29:17] amen amen
[1:29:23] praise the lord the house you have is
[1:29:26] belongs to god so you better be calling
[1:29:28] his name
[1:29:28] in the house he better be respecting his
[1:29:31] principle in their house
[1:29:39] israel possession was given to them
[1:29:42] by god it was divided by
[1:29:46] divine leadership joshua divided the
[1:29:50] land and gave them their inheritance
[1:29:54] praise the lord it was a
[1:29:57] perpetual inheritance
[1:30:01] an inheritance forever
[1:30:05] got it in that they did not work for me
[1:30:09] you hear the language that's my money
[1:30:10] that's my money i work for
[1:30:12] it praise the lord
[1:30:22] it was a perpetual inheritance
[1:30:25] so in the way that the jubilee works
[1:30:30] the way that the jubilee works is that
[1:30:32] if a land was
[1:30:34] sold they did not buy land in houses
[1:30:38] like we do today amen
[1:30:44] when a land was sold it was only sold
[1:30:47] for the value
[1:30:49] from the time it was sold to the jubilee
[1:30:53] right it was so for that value
[1:30:57] from the time the land was sold it was
[1:31:00] so from that time
[1:31:02] told the jubilee because when the
[1:31:04] jubilee comes
[1:31:05] you have to turn it over so you set it
[1:31:07] only for that value
[1:31:09] if it was just two years to the jubilee
[1:31:11] you only set it for that value
[1:31:16] if it was 30 years to the jubilee you
[1:31:18] you can
[1:31:19] you you can put a price of 30 years so
[1:31:21] the price of 30 years will not be the
[1:31:23] same as the price of five years
[1:31:29] because when the jubilee comes they must
[1:31:31] return back
[1:31:32] to the original owner
[1:31:39] praise the lord now so you will see
[1:31:41] that's the reason why
[1:31:42] when zaraphat's daughter were claiming
[1:31:46] their father
[1:31:46] inheritance it became
[1:31:50] it became a uh it became a question it
[1:31:54] became a struggle
[1:31:56] the ender says no you know a woman have
[1:31:58] have never been given inheritance in the
[1:32:00] land because
[1:32:01] when she gets married this tribe
[1:32:04] inheritance
[1:32:05] will go over to the next tribe and one
[1:32:07] tribe is not supposed to have
[1:32:09] inheritance across their border
[1:32:15] so when moses went to meet the law the
[1:32:17] law says you gives our five daughters
[1:32:20] their father inherited but this is how
[1:32:22] it works
[1:32:24] they cannot marry out of their tribe
[1:32:27] that the inheritance will not go to
[1:32:30] across the border
[1:32:40] are we together
[1:32:50] now so
[1:32:59] that this is how the jubilee
[1:33:02] or this is how the the dividing the
[1:33:06] selling of
[1:33:08] inheritance works
[1:33:11] praise the lord amen amen
[1:33:15] so six days you can work seven day rest
[1:33:20] six years you can told the the the field
[1:33:24] seven years rest uh uh
[1:33:27] seventh sabbath you can you can take
[1:33:31] a man possession or the man can be sold
[1:33:34] and then after
[1:33:35] that the fifth year they must come back
[1:33:39] praise the lord amen
[1:33:42] that's the reason why uh uh
[1:33:46] it's called pentecost because it was on
[1:33:49] on
[1:33:49] on the 50th day the holy ghost came uh
[1:33:52] uh on the days of pentecost amen
[1:33:55] praise the lord the bible says 40 days
[1:33:58] you know after jesus resurrection you
[1:34:01] know those old testament scenes were
[1:34:03] appearing and disappearing in the holy
[1:34:05] city you know and then 10 days
[1:34:08] the disciples were gathered in the upper
[1:34:09] room i mean
[1:34:11] so after that 40 days you put the 10 to
[1:34:13] 8 it's 50
[1:34:14] that is your pentecost i are we together
[1:34:21] praise the lord amen
[1:34:26] too much information here wonderful
[1:34:28] brother
[1:34:30] but i'm praying that the lord will just
[1:34:32] be able to help us let's get back to
[1:34:33] that quote making the way
[1:34:35] he says here i believe this will be
[1:34:39] the tiny point that america
[1:34:43] will go in we will have a revival
[1:34:47] this day or we won't have a revival
[1:34:52] praise the lord i read something else to
[1:34:54] you let's read this down
[1:34:56] i believe that this is the year that
[1:34:59] america
[1:35:00] will make his decision
[1:35:04] that was the same year he preached the
[1:35:05] message to church and his condition
[1:35:08] look on the charts you will see it
[1:35:12] he preached the junction of time that
[1:35:14] same year
[1:35:15] in in los angeles he preached on the
[1:35:19] on the azusa street jubilee
[1:35:25] praise the lord amen
[1:35:35] church we are not following couldn't
[1:35:37] devise people
[1:35:39] these things are not just a makeup
[1:35:42] theory
[1:35:43] these are realities
[1:35:47] praise the lord these are realities
[1:35:58] let's uh let's let's just go on a little
[1:36:00] bit here
[1:36:01] i believe this this will be the year
[1:36:03] that america
[1:36:04] will make its decision and i and i trust
[1:36:07] that they will
[1:36:08] make it and we will have a great revival
[1:36:12] that will just sweep we are having
[1:36:15] much preaching and much in
[1:36:18] evangelizing but we need a revival
[1:36:23] a real revival praise the lord
[1:36:27] amen amen and and and i and i
[1:36:30] feel the same praise the lord i mean you
[1:36:33] can get you can get a preacher
[1:36:35] into the pulpit we can preach you know
[1:36:38] we can we can preach
[1:36:39] yeah i mean there are just a lot of
[1:36:40] things there there are things that have
[1:36:42] not been touched
[1:36:44] we can pick up a subject and preach
[1:36:49] but what the church needs is to get back
[1:36:52] on speaking terms with god
[1:36:58] praise the lord it's for the people to
[1:37:00] give back
[1:37:02] to the reality not church membership
[1:37:06] right now i believe the message your
[1:37:08] individual
[1:37:10] personality you're behind the curtains
[1:37:14] life with god amen
[1:37:17] amen behind the curtains
[1:37:20] when nobody is seeing you you're behind
[1:37:23] the curtain
[1:37:24] life with god
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:29] because we can all come up and we can
[1:37:31] show up to our duty
[1:37:35] and if it is to play it we can play it
[1:37:37] right so help me god
[1:37:40] or behind the curtains
[1:37:51] and we together that's what we need
[1:37:55] the lord bless you now let me pick up
[1:37:58] another thing here
[1:38:00] so you will
[1:38:03] you will see a little bit here
[1:38:06] combination by representation

[1:39:18] god allowed them to cancel their
[1:39:20] overseas meeting
[1:39:22] to stay warm and give the church her
[1:39:26] last
[1:39:26] invitation
[1:39:30] [Music]

[1:39:41] meetings
[1:39:42] i said america will either receive
[1:39:46] or reject christ this year
[1:39:50] amen in 1956 then i said
[1:39:54] when when they elected an indiana
[1:39:59] uh 22 year old boy
[1:40:03] aboard to george
[1:40:06] the spirit of the lord came with me and
[1:40:09] i said they finally
[1:40:11] have a president that will be
[1:40:14] one of uh one of these
[1:40:18] crew cut playboy and uh
[1:40:21] and and and right under this right under
[1:40:24] the context of this the reason why
[1:40:25] i touched this uh uh um
[1:40:29] the reason why i i added this
[1:40:32] into my note here uh well i was just
[1:40:35] focusing on running around
[1:40:37] but right under this context this
[1:40:40] was the bringing in of johnny john f
[1:40:43] kennedy the first
[1:40:44] catholic president and brother brown
[1:40:46] would see the country haha one they
[1:40:48] would have the second
[1:40:50] amen and every one of them are coming on
[1:40:52] at the same time playboy
[1:40:54] they are all playboy and they are ladies
[1:40:57] men
[1:41:02] praise the lord
[1:41:10] now so you see uh uh uh
[1:41:13] the the same voice of
[1:41:17] god that taught us there was one pres
[1:41:19] catholic precedent
[1:41:20] and there will be a second you know uh
[1:41:23] uh and it is for
[1:41:25] is fulfilling right in our days
[1:41:29] it's the same voice that says that that
[1:41:33] 1956 will have been
[1:41:38] at any point
[1:41:41] praise the lord it would have been a
[1:41:43] turning point
[1:41:44] for for america
[1:41:48] it would have been a turning point for
[1:41:50] the church
[1:41:51] right now watch in jeremiah prophecies
[1:41:55] like i told you the prophecy was to the
[1:41:57] nation he called the nation first
[1:42:00] and then the next was the congregation
[1:42:06] amen when god sent a prophet he sent a
[1:42:10] prophet to the people to the nation
[1:42:12] when he refuses war then he call and
[1:42:15] heal it out
[1:42:16] that becomes a congregation that will
[1:42:19] hear the voice of god
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:26] are we together amen
[1:42:37] i've always said when you know god
[1:42:39] that's the way you will self him
[1:42:44] the way you know him that's the way you
[1:42:45] would serve him praise the lord
[1:42:48] if you know him through a trinitarian
[1:42:51] channel that's the way you will selfie
[1:42:54] right
[1:42:57] young man i've been talking to and uh uh
[1:43:00] uh been
[1:43:03] kind of encouraging him witnessing to
[1:43:05] him and he sent me the text
[1:43:07] those couple of days he says this is uh
[1:43:10] uh
[1:43:10] i you know i gave him the bible and told
[1:43:13] him uh you know read one
[1:43:14] if you have a problem just just you know
[1:43:17] sent for me we'll talk about it
[1:43:19] text me and says uh yeah we need to talk
[1:43:21] about this
[1:43:23] you know this god versus jesus
[1:43:29] you know it looks like we pray too much
[1:43:31] to jesus and and
[1:43:33] and
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:36] and i'm seeing the bible talking about
[1:43:38] god you know this god versus jesus we
[1:43:40] need to talk about i said okay that's
[1:43:42] that's a good place to start
[1:43:44] amen by the way you know god right
[1:43:48] that's the way you would sell him sure
[1:43:51] that's the way you were selling that i
[1:43:53] mean there's just there's just no other
[1:43:55] there's no
[1:43:55] no other way there you know sometimes we
[1:43:58] think that
[1:43:59] you know we have to pump things in no
[1:44:00] all a man needs is revelation
[1:44:06] praise the lord it needs for god to be
[1:44:08] real some people think
[1:44:10] god is in heaven they are on earth they
[1:44:11] are free to do whatever they want to do
[1:44:14] praise the lord while some people think
[1:44:16] that he's so near me
[1:44:20] that i can take one step without him
[1:44:23] he know my uprising you know my down
[1:44:26] sitting
[1:44:27] even if i go beneath the seat he is
[1:44:29] there
[1:44:32] and because of that understanding it
[1:44:34] make them so calm
[1:44:44] are we together praise the lord so
[1:44:48] as we look at this together
[1:44:52] as we look at this together
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:04] as we look at this together
[1:45:10] there is something crossing my mind
[1:45:15] so we we realized here that
[1:45:20] the church had this on their hands
[1:45:24] the church had this on their hands and
[1:45:26] and exactly
[1:45:27] 1956 the church never recognized that
[1:45:30] they never came to that revival
[1:45:32] you know they did not recognize that
[1:45:35] they never came to the revival
[1:45:37] and that was the turning point of
[1:45:39] america now why america
[1:45:41] it will bring us to revelation chapter
[1:45:43] 13. because
[1:45:45] this is this is a place now you think
[1:45:49] about it
[1:45:50] god brought the the the pentecostal
[1:45:52] revival
[1:45:53] to to to azusa there in california
[1:45:57] and that was in his mind right from the
[1:45:58] foundation of the world
[1:46:00] but this is a country that god raised up
[1:46:04] praise the lord for the freedom of
[1:46:05] religion
[1:46:07] bringing the people from europe and
[1:46:09] skipping the torture of catholicism
[1:46:12] that suppress the church
[1:46:17] amen
[1:46:20] and just like i mean the departing is
[1:46:23] just like
[1:46:24] israel god set this nation
[1:46:27] in its foundation that's what gave her
[1:46:30] the influence
[1:46:31] that she had around the world
[1:46:36] that's what gave her the name that she
[1:46:38] had right
[1:46:42] praise the lord
[1:46:50] it's so sad for many of us
[1:46:54] even that that migrated to america we
[1:46:56] came
[1:46:57] at a time where the country has lost its
[1:47:00] is uh reverence for god right
[1:47:04] and that's the reason why you find
[1:47:06] people they were
[1:47:08] fearing for god overseas when they come
[1:47:10] here they backslide because
[1:47:11] they take this as a way of
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:21] you life into the right race yes
[1:47:27] instead of having a dream for heaven to
[1:47:29] go all going after the american dream
[1:47:31] right
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] and pretty soon their experience with
[1:47:36] god is lost
[1:47:39] they can't even pray they can't even
[1:47:40] read their bible they don't even know
[1:47:42] where the church door is
[1:47:43] right
[1:47:46] praise the lord oh yeah because there
[1:47:49] was a time where
[1:47:50] on sunday all working places were closed
[1:47:56] you never came you never knew that
[1:47:58] because you came to america and there is
[1:48:00] work all over
[1:48:20] praise the lord
[1:48:28] amen amen
[1:48:35] praise the lord now so we see this
[1:48:38] it was it was it was it was amazing
[1:48:40] yesterday when i was looking at this
[1:48:42] last night it was i mean it was it was
[1:48:44] just amazing
[1:48:46] a few things were were
[1:48:49] so beautiful came so in line
[1:48:52] and i hope i can be able to
[1:48:56] to be able to share that with you as we
[1:48:58] go along but we're looking at this tiny
[1:49:01] point
[1:49:02] you know we are looking at the standing
[1:49:03] point because
[1:49:05] it has affected the church life
[1:49:09] the family life and we see
[1:49:12] where the nation is right
[1:49:15] praise the lord we see where the nation
[1:49:18] is
[1:49:19] and even the the the internet is not
[1:49:23] even helping because it's just feeling
[1:49:25] all of those conspiracy theories and we
[1:49:27] are filling our mind into those things
[1:49:29] praise the lord that we are not even
[1:49:32] looking that prophecy is fulfilling
[1:49:34] before our eyes
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:36] we're not even asking ourself what day
[1:49:39] are we living in
[1:49:40] what is happening
[1:49:49] glory be to god amen
[1:49:55] so that there was that was
[1:49:58] the turning point with uh with the
[1:50:01] church and like i said the church
[1:50:03] did not it didn't that it did not got
[1:50:06] its liberty then this now would bring us
[1:50:10] over to uh uh leviticus chapter 25
[1:50:15] praise the lord
[1:50:20] it's so beautiful amen
[1:50:24] it's so beautiful because when you look
[1:50:26] at the rejection
[1:50:28] of the jubilee you look at the rejection
[1:50:31] of the jubilee
[1:50:33] and and and and you look at you know
[1:50:35] what what the scripture described now
[1:50:37] you
[1:50:38] have to you have to you have to realize
[1:50:41] that this was not man's doing this was
[1:50:45] god's
[1:50:45] ordinance god says if a man if a man now
[1:50:48] this is the way it is
[1:50:50] if a man was giving into slavery because
[1:50:53] he could not pay his debt
[1:50:55] or uh you know and and and he owned and
[1:50:58] whatever
[1:50:59] and at the 15-year time you know uh
[1:51:02] when that time comes uh like brother
[1:51:05] bran said
[1:51:06] he can have he can have an axe in his
[1:51:08] hands and
[1:51:09] and and all his slave master can be
[1:51:12] behind him with a wick
[1:51:14] as soon as that jubilee trumpet sound
[1:51:17] if he's bringing his hand down he must
[1:51:19] not touch him he must dare not touch him
[1:51:22] after that trumpet has signed amen
[1:51:25] praise the lord if he's bringing his
[1:51:27] hand that
[1:51:28] the best thing he should do just leave
[1:51:29] it let him fall down
[1:51:33] he must not touch him
[1:51:38] if this man is using an axe when that
[1:51:40] jubilee trumpet sound
[1:51:41] he can just throw it down and say i see
[1:51:43] you
[1:51:46] and just
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:51] praise the lord oh god amen
[1:51:55] praise the lord amen amen
[1:51:59] god gave that a as a natural lord
[1:52:03] because it was already a spiritual lord
[1:52:06] a law of redemption amen that everything
[1:52:09] that adam lost will come back
[1:52:12] amen it was a lot of redemption
[1:52:16] but he gave it to israel as a natural
[1:52:18] lord
[1:52:19] it was god's own law
[1:52:23] praise the lord it was god's own lord
[1:52:27] now if a man was giving in
[1:52:30] into slavery and and love of his master
[1:52:34] and his master gave him some benefits
[1:52:38] maybe a house maybe a wife
[1:52:42] now you have to realize that everything
[1:52:45] that his master gave him belongs to his
[1:52:47] master
[1:52:47] right that's right now when a jubilee
[1:52:50] comes
[1:52:51] he can go but he cannot go with those
[1:52:53] things
[1:52:54] because it was given to him by his
[1:52:57] master
[1:52:59] praise the lord now so that is where
[1:53:04] the trump comes in
[1:53:09] he was given a home he was giving wife
[1:53:11] and now he has
[1:53:12] children yeah is he going to walk away
[1:53:14] from them that's right
[1:53:15] there you go and his master has been
[1:53:17] nice to him
[1:53:19] praise the lord that sometimes the devil
[1:53:24] tried to be nice to people right
[1:53:27] well he's never nice
[1:53:31] amen he never nice that's right
[1:53:35] but what happened with that law is dead
[1:53:39] if he's trapped into this thing
[1:53:42] maybe the law for his family and i mean
[1:53:45] i mean he's i mean he's he's here even
[1:53:48] though he's asleep but he's
[1:53:50] he's not being treated as a slave praise
[1:53:53] the lord
[1:53:54] then the scripture says now he must be
[1:53:57] taken to the temple
[1:53:59] not idle temple to god's own temple
[1:54:04] and there must be a witness of the
[1:54:06] priests
[1:54:09] the priests witnessed him being pierced
[1:54:12] now that was the thing that triggered
[1:54:14] this whole thing for me
[1:54:16] it was the thing that triggered this
[1:54:18] whole thing for me i'm saying to myself
[1:54:20] this is this is this is not an idle
[1:54:23] temple
[1:54:24] this is god's own lord
[1:54:29] amen this is his own lord
[1:54:32] hey glory to god what is
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:47] because you see we have look at this on
[1:54:49] one side right
[1:54:50] i'm going to bring you on the other side
[1:54:55] praise the lord amen
[1:54:59] glory be to god
[1:55:04] are we ready oh my
[1:55:08] now so that's that's the law of
[1:55:10] redemption
[1:55:11] so he's sticking to the to the to the
[1:55:15] to the to the temple and the priests
[1:55:18] witness it
[1:55:19] and and and the bible says his ear is
[1:55:22] put to the doorpost
[1:55:25] amen
[1:55:29] that's very powerful that's right right
[1:55:33] that many people die right in the pill
[1:55:38] people get reprobate just by sitting on
[1:55:42] a preacher
[1:55:44] and misunderstanding what he's saying
[1:55:46] and they take
[1:55:47] a wrong attitude and that attitude
[1:55:50] lead him away from god it's just like
[1:55:54] god
[1:55:54] saying king what have you done and he
[1:55:57] took
[1:55:58] an attitude before god he never took an
[1:56:01] attitude when god was not there
[1:56:02] right before god yes am i my brother's
[1:56:05] keeper
[1:56:06] in his heart
[1:56:10] right in the eye in the house of god he
[1:56:13] got his seal
[1:56:20] people become reprobate right in church
[1:56:24] they sit right in church and they become
[1:56:27] reprobate
[1:56:28] man
[1:56:33] instead of being there and say oh god
[1:56:35] have mercy help me lord
[1:56:36] lord jesus help me speak to me lord
[1:56:40] father speak to me be with me
[1:56:44] they sit back they look over their
[1:56:46] shoulder here they look over every
[1:56:47] service they get something to criticize
[1:56:51] every service they look for some kind of
[1:56:54] something that will amuse them
[1:56:55] funny
[1:57:01] it's right in church that people
[1:57:04] get reprobate
[1:57:07] and they think nothing about it they
[1:57:09] come back again and get more reprobate
[1:57:11] they come back again and get more reaper
[1:57:13] by resenting the word of god
[1:57:18] nothing you say apply to them
[1:57:23] they know who they're talking about when
[1:57:24] they talk this one they know what
[1:57:25] they're talking about when they say this
[1:57:27] other one
[1:57:33] praise the lord the bible says why peter
[1:57:36] speak these words
[1:57:38] the holy ghost telling them that was
[1:57:40] colena's house

[1:57:59] to give them the holy ghost even before
[1:58:02] they got baptized
[1:58:10] [Music]

[2:11:19] ground
[2:11:20] god was calling his church by the
[2:11:23] opening of the seals
[2:11:25] showing us what was in god's mind
[2:11:28] is not by power it's not by might it's
[2:11:31] by the spirit save the lord
[2:11:39] seven years after 1963

[2:12:09] and did they accept it they rejected
[2:12:13] praise the lord
[2:12:17] 1963 seven more years would be 1970.
[2:12:22] that was when pentecost
[2:12:26] embraced catholicism i was talking that
[2:12:29] about that the last time
[2:12:30] tsunami was not demonstrating it was
[2:12:33] david diplusi
[2:12:35] he was the one called mr mr pentecost
[2:12:42] he was the one called mr pentecost
[2:12:50] it was a man that brother brown met dead
[2:12:52] in south africa
[2:12:53] he was an evangelical preacher
[2:12:57] a pentecostal man
[2:13:00] and he thought that he would turn the
[2:13:01] catholic church to a pentecostal church
[2:13:06] and finally he emerged catholicism
[2:13:10] and penicaster in 1977
[2:13:13] the pope called him mr pentecost
[2:13:20] praise the lord
[2:13:30] to pentecost uh this this is something
[2:13:32] that gathered a little bit from
[2:13:33] from his autobiography at the end of
[2:13:36] david duplicit
[2:13:38] uh 1977 autobiographic a man
[2:13:43] called mr pentecost he related
[2:13:46] what he considered
[2:13:50] a key validation

[2:13:57] in room in 1976
[2:14:01] with all the key members of the roman
[2:14:03] catholic
[2:14:05] pentecostal dialogue he came
[2:14:08] face to face with the pontiff paul
[2:14:12] vi
[2:14:16] we have introduced him one by one
[2:14:20] to paul
[2:14:23] as he as as i reached him
[2:14:27] my name was red and loud
[2:14:31] he looked into my face and said
[2:14:35] so you are mr pentecost
[2:14:45] that's what they call me i reply
[2:14:49] amen i'm gonna read it i love that to
[2:14:52] you
[2:14:53] let me go back to what i'm saying here
[2:14:57] i was also looking into this as i was
[2:15:00] studying
[2:15:06] i sought for the greatness
[2:15:09] and and genius of america
[2:15:13] in in her comedian hubbard
[2:15:18] and her emperor rivers and it was not
[2:15:22] there
[2:15:23] in her felt of fields and boundary
[2:15:26] forests
[2:15:27] and it was not there i sought for the
[2:15:30] greatness
[2:15:30] and genius of america in her rich mind
[2:15:34] in her world commerce and it was not
[2:15:37] there
[2:15:39] in house in hall democratic congress
[2:15:43] and her marchless constitution
[2:15:47] and it was not there not until
[2:15:50] i went into the churches of america
[2:15:54] and heard her puppets a flame with
[2:15:57] righteousness
[2:15:59] that i understand the secret
[2:16:02] of her genius and power
[2:16:06] america is great because
[2:16:09] she is good and if america ever
[2:16:13] cease to be good she will cease to be
[2:16:16] great
[2:16:22] a critical moment in american history
[2:16:25] the revolutionary war and civil war
[2:16:30] president george washington and abraham
[2:16:32] lincoln sought god
[2:16:35] miraculous intervention
[2:16:39] helping turning the tides in those walls
[2:16:43] and save america at the height of the
[2:16:46] civil war
[2:16:47] in 1863 lincoln called for several days
[2:16:52] of fasting and praying
[2:16:58] praise the lord
[2:17:03] we have gone to believe the signs
[2:17:07] listening to the signs that's all our
[2:17:09] leaders telling us
[2:17:13] no national day of fasting no national
[2:17:16] day or praying
[2:17:19] believe to the science
[2:17:23] and that's what happened in 1963. 1963
[2:17:27] was the very
[2:17:28] same year where the bible was rejected
[2:17:31] in schools
[2:17:34] the 10th commandment was taken from the
[2:17:35] ward of the supreme court
[2:17:46] praise the lord
[2:17:53] you think about it all of those children
[2:17:55] that were born in the wilderness 40
[2:17:56] years
[2:17:57] they went about in the wilderness and
[2:18:00] all of those children that were born in
[2:18:01] the wilderness they were not in egypt
[2:18:05] everything they heard about egypt was
[2:18:06] what their parents told them
[2:18:10] amen praise the lord so
[2:18:13] the the parents the parents that were
[2:18:15] bragging on their good time in
[2:18:17] egypt created a desire in their children
[2:18:20] to want to go back to egypt
[2:18:24] the parents that were that were telling
[2:18:26] their children of how they suffer
[2:18:28] i mean they just make egypt a bunch
[2:18:31] thank god we are going to our promised
[2:18:33] land they create a desire in their
[2:18:35] children
[2:18:36] to long for the promised land
[2:18:43] the society is tied into modern america
[2:18:46] because that's all that that's all the
[2:18:48] parents are talking about
[2:18:50] freedom of liberty and and this right
[2:18:53] and this other right
[2:18:55] fight for your right nobody should tell
[2:18:57] you anything
[2:19:03] so they are polluting the minds of the
[2:19:04] children in violence
[2:19:10] violence everything is just
[2:19:18] misinterpreted
[2:19:28] in the height of the civil war 1963
[2:19:31] lincoln called for several days of
[2:19:33] fasting and praying
[2:19:40] in churches across the nation americans
[2:19:42] sought to return
[2:19:44] and be reconciled with with god
[2:19:47] in prayers and re and and repenting for
[2:19:50] personal
[2:19:51] and national sin two days later

[2:19:59] was fatally wounded in the fight
[2:20:02] accident
[2:20:04] by his own guys two months later
[2:20:09] the south lost the battle
[2:20:12] in god's mercy the war
[2:20:15] soon ended having seen
[2:20:18] how many prayers and fasting and
[2:20:20] repenting
[2:20:22] god restored america
[2:20:25] lincoln after name and poured as one of
[2:20:30] america's best president went to free
[2:20:33] the african-american slaves
[2:20:36] and in this culture of slavery
[2:20:40] by the way men
[2:20:44] they were men that knew
[2:20:48] what what the benefit it is into things
[2:20:51] seeking the face of god
[2:20:54] that how they solve their problem
[2:20:57] by seeking the face of god by asking for
[2:21:01] prayers
[2:21:07] i know i'm all over the place here but
[2:21:10] it's fine
[2:21:15] amen
[2:21:24] 1956 america rejects
[2:21:27] her jubilee she choose signs
[2:21:30] and education
[2:21:36] and then seven years after
[2:21:41] when she had mercy
[2:21:45] she pulled out of the education
[2:21:49] and judicial system of america she put

[2:22:28] that seal in god we trust
[2:22:31] that just show how
[2:22:35] the people have been tolerated
[2:22:38] far away from god
[2:22:45] the god that they sing about is themself
[2:22:52] amen the god that they talk about
[2:22:58] is the enterprise

[2:30:38] is that i mean just bertrand was was
[2:30:41] dealing with a case he was talking about
[2:30:42] somebody he just dropped that that was a
[2:30:44] passing thought
[2:30:45] he was not actually teaching on that but
[2:30:47] what happened here
[2:30:48] is that there are there are there are
[2:30:50] things that happen
[2:30:53] and sometimes we don't understand it
[2:30:54] sometimes we attribute it
[2:30:56] to to to devil sometimes we attribute it
[2:30:59] to uh
[2:31:00] you know some people would say it's
[2:31:01] witchcraft some people will say
[2:31:03] you know it's it's out of there looking
[2:31:05] at some of that the other time but the
[2:31:06] brand was talking about
[2:31:07] the same thing and and talking to a
[2:31:09] woman and says well you think
[2:31:11] you know uh uh is is it's not it's a
[2:31:15] demonic oppression he said no it's just
[2:31:17] a change of life
[2:31:22] just like we were saying on wednesday
[2:31:24] night talking about god bringing us
