[1:17] so
[1:31] [Music]
[1:33] remember this is the false vine
[1:36] let it name the name of the lord it does
[1:38] so only in a lie its headship is not of
[1:41] the lord but of satan it finally ends up
[1:44] completely identified with the beast
[1:46] the riding on the scarlet beast
[1:48] distinctly shows her power is the god of
[1:50] force satan and not our god the lord
[1:54] jesus christ
[1:56] in verse 17 it emphatically shows that
[1:58] she will gain absolute control of the
[2:00] commerce of the earth for no man can buy
[2:03] or sell apart from her
[2:05] this is borne out in revelation 18 9-17
[2:09] which shows her involvement with kings
[2:11] princes merchants all of whom have to do
[2:14] with rome and commerce
[2:16] in revelation 13 14 we learned that the
[2:20] beast spreads his influence through the
[2:21] image which was built for him
[2:23] the image that is made is a worldwide
[2:25] ecumenical council
[2:27] wherein all the organized churches will
[2:29] get together with the roman catholics
[2:31] they are doing it even now
[2:33] it is quite possible this union will
[2:35] come in order to stop the power of
[2:37] communism but since communism like
[2:39] nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to
[2:41] burn the flesh of the harlot rome will
[2:43] be overcome and destroyed
[2:46] take note that everywhere the romish
[2:48] church went communism followed it has to
[2:50] be that way
[2:52] and let me warn you now don't get
[2:54] thinking communism is your only enemy no
[2:56] sir it is the catholic church also and
[2:59] even more so
[3:01] now let us read revelation 13 1-4
[3:04] and compare this with revelation 12 1-5
[3:08] revelation 13 1-4
[3:11] and i stood upon the sand of the sea
[3:14] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[3:16] having seven heads and ten horns and
[3:19] upon his horns ten crowns
[3:21] and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
[3:24] and the beast which i saw was like unto
[3:26] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[3:28] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[3:31] a lion and the dragon gave him his power
[3:34] and his seat and great authority
[3:36] and i saw one of his heads as it were
[3:38] wounded to death
[3:39] and his deadly wound was healed
[3:42] and all the world wandered after the
[3:43] beast and they worshiped the dragon
[3:46] which gave power unto the beast
[3:48] and they worshipped the beast saying who
[3:50] is like unto the beast who is able to
[3:52] make war with him
[3:54] revelation 12 1-5
[3:57] and there appeared a great wonder in
[3:59] heaven a woman clothed with the sun and
[4:01] the moon under her feet and upon her
[4:03] head a crown of twelve stars
[4:06] and she being with child cried
[4:07] travailing in birth and pain to be
[4:09] delivered and there appeared another
[4:11] wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[4:14] dragon having seven heads and ten horns
[4:17] and seven crowns upon his heads
[4:19] and his tail drew the third part of the
[4:21] stars of heaven and it cast them to the
[4:24] earth
[4:24] and the dragon stood before the woman
[4:26] which was ready to be delivered
[4:28] for to devour her child as soon as it
[4:30] was born
[4:31] and she brought forth a man-child who
[4:33] was to rule all nations with a rod of
[4:35] iron
[4:36] and her child was caught up unto god and
[4:38] to his throne
[4:40] satan and his satanic religion are in
[4:42] both of these beasts
[4:44] in revelation 14 the beast that was
[4:47] wounded unto death but lived again is
[4:49] imperial pagan rome that fell to the
[4:51] onslaught of the barbarians and thereby
[4:53] lost her temporal power
[4:55] but she regained it in papal rome
[4:57] do you see it
[4:59] the nation that ruled by crushing all in
[5:01] which became the strongest empire ever
[5:03] known was finally wounded to death
[5:06] her power was gone physically as to
[5:08] control by armies etc
[5:10] but under constantine she came back to
[5:12] life
[5:13] for papal rome has infiltrated the whole
[5:15] world and her power is absolute
[5:17] she uses kings and merchants and in her
[5:20] deadly religious and financial strength
[5:22] she is governing as the goddess of this
[5:24] present age
[5:25] she is also the dragon that stood
[5:27] waiting to devour the man-child
[5:29] herod tried to kill the lord jesus and
[5:31] failed
[5:32] later jesus was crucified by roman
[5:34] soldiers but now is caught up to the
[5:36] throne
[5:38] now along with what i have just said
[5:40] recall the vision of daniel
[5:42] the last part of the image the last
[5:44] world power was in the feet
[5:47] that was iron and clay
[5:48] see the iron is the roman empire
[5:51] but now it is no longer solid iron play
[5:54] is mixed in it
[5:55] yet it is there in running world affairs
[5:57] in both the democratic nations and the
[5:59] more despotic ones
[6:00] the romish church is in every nation it
[6:03] is mixed up in it all let me give you a
[6:06] little something on the iron and clay
[6:09] remember when khrushchev beat his shoe
[6:11] on the desk at the u.n
[6:13] well there were five eastern nations
[6:14] there and five western khrushchev spoke
[6:17] for the east and president eisenhower
[6:19] for the west
[6:21] in russian khrushchev is clay and
[6:23] eisenhower means iron
[6:25] the two main leaders of the world the
[6:26] two big toes of the feet of iron and
[6:28] clay were side by side
[6:31] we are in the end of it
[6:32] all in verse 4 it asks
[6:35] who is able to make war with the beast
[6:39] now there are at present some great
[6:40] names in the world there are some mighty
[6:42] nations
[6:43] but right now rome is calling the tune
[6:46] the pope is in the driver's seat
[6:48] and his power is going to increase no
[6:51] one can war against him
[6:53] verse 6
[6:55] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[6:57] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[6:59] of men heady high-minded lovers of
[7:01] pleasure having a form of godliness and
[7:03] denying the power thereof
[7:05] he blasphemed the name of god changing
[7:08] that name to titles and refusing to do
[7:10] otherwise
[7:12] verse 7
[7:13] and it was given unto him to make war
[7:15] with the saints persecution death to the
[7:18] true believer and all in the name of the
[7:20] lord in order that the name of god be
[7:22] blasphemed even as it is in russia
[7:24] because of what the catholic religion
[7:26] did there
[7:28] verse 8
[7:29] and all that dwell upon the earth all
[7:31] whose names are not written in the book
[7:33] of life of the lamb slain from the
[7:34] foundation of the world shall worship
[7:37] him
[7:38] thank god the sheep will not worship him
[7:41] everyone but the very elect will be
[7:42] deceived but they will not be deceived
[7:46] for they hear the shepherd's voice and
[7:47] they follow him
[7:49] now then see this what we have been
[7:51] trying to show you
[7:52] this seed of death that started in the
[7:54] first age this seed of organization has
[7:58] finally grown into the tree in which
[8:00] every foul bird is lodged
[8:02] in spite of her claims that she is the
[8:04] giver of life she is the giver of death
[8:07] her fruit is death
[8:09] they that partake of her are dead this
[8:12] mighty world church system that fools
[8:13] the world that in her is physical and
[8:15] spiritual salvation deceives and
[8:18] destroys the multitudes
[8:20] but not only is she death personified
[8:23] but this dead carrion creature will be
[8:25] itself put to death with death which is
[8:27] the lake of fire
[8:28] oh that men would perceive what their
[8:30] end will be by remaining in her
[8:33] come out of her for why will ye die
[8:37] a final
[8:38] warning revelation 2 23
[8:42] and i will kill her children with death
[8:45] and all the churches shall know that i
[8:47] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[8:49] hearts and i will give unto every one of
[8:51] you according to your works
[8:54] god looketh on the heart
[8:56] that has never changed
[8:57] neither will it ever change
[9:00] here as through all the ages there are
[9:01] two groups both proclaiming their
[9:03] revelation from god and their
[9:04] relationship to god
[9:07] nevertheless the foundation of god
[9:08] standeth sure having this seal the lord
[9:12] knoweth them which are his
[9:14] second timothy 2 19
[9:17] the lord searcheth the reigns
[9:19] the word search means to track or follow
[9:22] up
[9:23] god tracks down our thoughts reigns he
[9:26] knows what is in our hearts
[9:28] he sees our works which are a definite
[9:30] manifestation of what lies within us
[9:32] it is out of the heart that precedes
[9:34] either righteousness or wickedness
[9:36] our motives our purposes
[9:38] all are known unto him as he watches
[9:40] every action
[9:42] and every action every word shall be
[9:44] brought into judgment when the
[9:45] accounting for our lives is given
[9:47] there was no fear of god before the
[9:49] false fine and dearly shall they pay
[9:51] let all who name his name
[9:53] so live as becometh saints
[9:56] we might fool the people but we will
[9:57] never fool the lord
[10:00] the promise in those dark
[10:02] days revelation 2
[10:05] 24-25
[10:07] but unto you i say and unto the rest in
[10:09] thyatira as many as have not this
[10:11] doctrine and which have not known the
[10:13] depth of satan as they speak
[10:16] i will put upon you none other burden
[10:18] but that which ye have already hold fast
[10:20] till i come
[10:22] now before we go into the promise let me
[10:24] show again that the church as spoken of
[10:26] by the spirit in this book has two vines
[10:28] whose interwinding branches compose it
[10:31] but i say unto you and unto the rest in
[10:33] thyatira as many as have not this
[10:36] doctrine
[10:37] there it is
[10:38] he is speaking to the two groups
[10:40] one has the doctrine another has not
[10:43] there they are scattered abroad across
[10:45] the nations with each one's doctrine
[10:47] opposing the other
[10:48] one is of god knowing his depths the
[10:51] other of satan knowing the depths of
[10:53] satan
[10:54] i will put upon you none other burden
[10:58] the word for burden is weight or
[10:59] pressure
[11:00] the pressure of the dark ages was either
[11:02] bend or be broken
[11:04] bow or die
[11:06] it was the inquisition the power of the
[11:08] empire backing up satanic worship
[11:10] be organized or pay with your life
[11:13] each age had its pressures
[11:15] for example a great burden of the last
[11:17] stage is the pressure of riches soft
[11:19] living and nervous tensions in a complex
[11:21] age that we seem unfitted to live in
[11:24] this fourth age seems to have had a
[11:26] clear-cut burden
[11:28] it was to defy rome stand up for the
[11:30] word even unto death
[11:33] they have not known the depths of satan
[11:36] it seems that this verse has been left
[11:38] out by the commentators for they were
[11:40] not able to figure out what doctrine or
[11:42] what experiences are meant by this
[11:43] phrase
[11:45] actually it is simple to know what is
[11:47] meant
[11:48] let us first know what the depth of god
[11:50] is and the opposite will be true for the
[11:52] depth of satan
[11:53] in ephesians 3 16
[11:56] that he would grant you according to the
[11:58] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[12:00] with might by his spirit in the inner
[12:02] man that christ may dwell in your hearts
[12:05] by faith
[12:06] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[12:08] love may be able to comprehend with all
[12:10] saints what is the breadth and length
[12:13] and depth and height and to know the
[12:15] love of christ which passeth knowledge
[12:18] that ye might be filled with all the
[12:19] fullness of god
[12:21] now according to these verses when a man
[12:23] experiences the depth of god in his life
[12:26] it is an actual personal experience of
[12:28] the spirit of god indwelling him and his
[12:31] mind is illuminated by the wisdom and
[12:32] knowledge of god through the word
[12:35] but the depth of satan will be and that
[12:37] he will attempt to destroy this
[12:39] he will as always attempt to make a
[12:41] substitute for this reality of god
[12:43] how will he do it
[12:45] he will take away the knowledge of the
[12:47] truth of god destroy the word by putting
[12:49] forth his own
[12:51] yea hath god said
[12:53] he will then substitute the personal
[12:55] christ in our spirits
[12:56] he will do it as he caused israel to do
[12:58] the same
[13:00] by a human being reigning as king
[13:02] instead of god
[13:03] the born-again experience will be
[13:05] rejected in favor of church joining the
[13:07] depths of satan had been entered into in
[13:09] that age
[13:11] and the fruit of that depth of satan
[13:12] which are lies murders and horrible
[13:14] crimes came forth from it
[13:18] the rewards
[13:20] revelation 2 26-29
[13:24] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[13:26] works unto the end to him will i give
[13:28] power over the nations and he shall rule
[13:31] them with a rod of iron as the vessels
[13:33] of a potter shall they be broken to
[13:35] shivers even as i received of my father
[13:38] and i will give him the morning star
[13:41] he that have an ear let him hear what
[13:43] the spirit saith unto the churches
[13:46] he that overcometh and keepeth my works
[13:48] to the end
[13:50] it is very evident from the remarks of
[13:52] the spirit on works that the lord is
[13:54] trying to get his own to see his opinion
[13:56] of righteous works
[13:58] four times he mentions works
[14:00] and now he says that he who keeps doing
[14:03] his works faithfully until the end will
[14:05] be given power over nations and will be
[14:07] a strong capable unbending ruler who can
[14:10] cope so powerfully with any situation
[14:12] that even the most desperate enemy will
[14:14] be broken if need be
[14:16] his demonstration of rule by power will
[14:19] be like unto the very sons
[14:21] this is very amazing
[14:23] but let us look at this promise in the
[14:25] light of the age
[14:26] powerful rome with state backing
[14:28] employing kings and armies and
[14:30] legislators breaks and grinds all before
[14:33] it she has killed millions and hungers
[14:35] to kill millions more who will not bow
[14:37] to her
[14:38] she intolerantly sets up kings or brings
[14:40] them low whenever she can
[14:42] yea her interference has actually caused
[14:44] nations to fall because she has
[14:46] determined to destroy the elect of god
[14:49] her works are the works of the devil for
[14:51] she murders and lies as did he
[14:54] but there is coming a day wherein the
[14:56] lord is going to say bring these mine
[14:58] enemies before me and slay them
[15:01] then shall the righteous be with their
[15:02] lord when his righteous indignation will
[15:04] fall upon the blasphemers
[15:06] the righteous coming with him in glory
[15:08] shall destroy those who destroyed the
[15:10] earth and made havoc of the saints of
[15:12] god
[15:13] this was the age of turning the cheek of
[15:16] terrible distress
[15:17] but a day is coming when truth shall
[15:19] prevail and who shall stand in its fire
[15:21] and be safe
[15:22] only the redeemed of the lord
[15:26] and i will give him the morning star
[15:29] according to revelation 22 16 and 2nd
[15:32] peter 1 19
[15:34] jesus is the morning star
[15:37] i am the root and offspring of david the
[15:39] bright and morning star
[15:41] until the day dawn and the day star
[15:43] arise in your hearts
[15:45] the spirit is therefore making a promise
[15:47] to the elect of the dark ages relative
[15:49] to himself and then in the ages to come
[15:53] as we have already stated jesus
[15:55] identifies himself with the messengers
[15:57] of each age
[15:58] they receive from him the revelation on
[16:00] the word for each period
[16:02] this word revelation brings the elect of
[16:04] god out of the world and into full union
[16:06] with jesus christ
[16:08] these messengers are called stars
[16:10] because they shine with a borrowed or
[16:12] reflected light of the sun even jesus
[16:15] they are also called stars because they
[16:17] are holders of light at night
[16:20] thus in the darkness of sin they bring
[16:22] the light of god to his people
[16:25] this is the dark ages
[16:27] it is especially dark for the word of
[16:29] the lord is almost entirely hidden from
[16:31] the people
[16:32] knowledge of the most high has almost
[16:34] ceased death has overcome vast numbers
[16:37] of the believers until their ranks are
[16:39] decimated
[16:40] the things of god are at the lowest ebb
[16:42] to this date and it seemed that satan
[16:44] would surely conquer god's people
[16:47] if ever a people needed a promise
[16:49] embracing the land where there is no
[16:51] light it was the people of the dark ages
[16:54] and that is why the spirit is promising
[16:56] them the morning star
[16:58] he is telling them that the chief star
[17:00] even jesus who dwelleth in light unto
[17:02] which no man can approach will in the
[17:04] future kingdom illuminate them by his
[17:06] own personal presence
[17:08] he will not be using the stars
[17:10] messengers to give light in darkness any
[17:13] longer
[17:14] it will be jesus himself speaking to
[17:16] them face to face as he shares his
[17:18] kingdom with them
[17:20] it is the morning star that is visible
[17:22] when the light of the sun commences to
[17:24] shine
[17:25] when our son
[17:26] jesus comes there will be no further
[17:28] need of messengers
[17:30] he will bring us his message of cheer
[17:31] himself
[17:33] and as he rules his kingdom and we live
[17:35] in his presence the light of the word
[17:37] will become brighter and brighter in our
[17:39] perfect day
[17:41] what else could we desire above jesus
[17:43] himself
[17:44] is he not everything even perfect
[17:46] everything
[17:48] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[17:50] the spirit saith to the churches
[17:52] amen
[17:53] even so lord god by thy spirit let us
[17:56] hear thy truth
[17:59] chapter 7
[18:00] the sardisian church age
[18:03] revelation 3 1-6
[18:07] and unto the angel of the church in
[18:08] sardis write
[18:10] these things saith he that hath the
[18:12] seven spirits of god and the seven stars
[18:15] i know thy works that thou hast to name
[18:17] that thou livest and art dead
[18:20] be watchful and strengthen the things
[18:22] which remain that are ready to die
[18:24] for i have not found thy works perfect
[18:26] before god
[18:28] remember therefore how thou hast
[18:30] received and heard and hold fast and
[18:32] repent
[18:33] if therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[18:35] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[18:38] not know what hour i will come upon thee
[18:41] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[18:43] which have not defiled their garments
[18:45] and they shall walk with me in white for
[18:47] they are worthy
[18:49] he that overcometh the same shall be
[18:51] clothed in white raymond
[18:53] and i will not blot out his name out of
[18:55] the book of life but i will confess his
[18:57] name before my father and before his
[18:59] angels
[19:00] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[19:02] the spirit saith unto the churches
[19:06] sardis
[19:08] sardis was the capital of ancient lydia
[19:11] it passed from the hands of lydian
[19:12] monarchs to the persians and thence to
[19:14] alexander the great
[19:16] it was sacked by antiochus the great
[19:18] the kings of pergamus then succeeded to
[19:20] the dominion until the romans took over
[19:23] in the time of tiberius it was desolated
[19:25] by earthquakes and plagues
[19:27] today it is a heap of ruins and
[19:29] uninhabited
[19:31] this city was at one time very important
[19:33] commercially
[19:34] pliny said that the art of dying wool
[19:36] was invented here it was the center of
[19:38] wall dying and carpet weaving
[19:41] it had a goodly amount of silver and
[19:42] gold in the area and it is said that
[19:44] gold coins were first minted there it
[19:47] also had a slave market
[19:50] the religion of this city was the impure
[19:52] worship of the goddess civilly
[19:54] the massive ruins of the temple may
[19:55] still be seen
[19:57] you will recall that in the pergamian
[19:59] age i mentioned that the babylonish
[20:01] concept of mother and son known as
[20:03] samiramus and ninus became the sibley
[20:06] endious of asia the attributes attached
[20:09] to these two are most enlightening as we
[20:10] view them side by side
[20:12] he was the sun god she the moon goddess
[20:16] he was the lord of heaven she the queen
[20:18] of heaven
[20:19] he the revealer of goodness and truth
[20:22] she of gentleness and mercy
[20:24] he the mediator she the mediatrix
[20:27] he with the key that opens and shuts the
[20:29] gates of the invisible world and she
[20:31] with an identical key doing likewise
[20:34] he as the judge of the dead
[20:36] she as standing at his side
[20:39] he being killed raised and ascended into
[20:41] heaven
[20:42] she carried their bodily by the sun
[20:45] now in rome this same god is given the
[20:47] title of our lord
[20:49] he is called the son of god while she is
[20:51] called the mother of god
[20:53] now that is what we found back there in
[20:55] the other two ages where the mother and
[20:58] son concept took on such tremendous
[21:00] proportions
[21:01] but now notice that even as it was back
[21:03] in babylon that the worship of the sun
[21:05] began to lose out in favor of the
[21:07] worship of the mother
[21:09] so she literally began to take the place
[21:11] of the sun
[21:13] we see in this age that the pagan
[21:14] worship of sardis was the worship of the
[21:16] woman
[21:18] it is civilly alone not civilly and eoes
[21:21] the mother has literally taken the place
[21:23] of the sun endowed with the merits of
[21:25] godhead
[21:26] all one needs to do is go over her
[21:28] various titles and recall the lovely
[21:30] attributes accorded mary by the roman
[21:32] church to understand where the religion
[21:34] of this age came from
[21:37] two things really struck me with force
[21:38] as i looked into this worship of civilly
[21:41] one was the fact that she wore a key
[21:43] like janus which gave her the same
[21:45] authority as janus
[21:46] key to heaven and earth and the
[21:48] mysteries
[21:49] and the fact that the worshipers whip
[21:51] themselves until blood spurts from their
[21:53] bodies which thing is done right today
[21:55] by the catholics who feel they are
[21:56] suffering like the lord
[21:59] the fact that this is the age of the
[22:01] first real break with papal rome that
[22:03] actually flourished no doubt caused the
[22:05] jezebel prophetess to consolidate and
[22:07] emphasize her doctrine of meriolatry in
[22:10] decided opposition to the protestants
[22:12] who denied her any part whatsoever in
[22:14] the plan of salvation apart from her
[22:16] favor with god as the virgin chosen to
[22:18] bear the babe
[22:19] as luther crystallized the doctrine of
[22:21] justification by faith they held to
[22:23] works penance prayers and other
[22:26] unscriptural means
[22:28] and as the freed christians glorified
[22:30] the sun the roman catholics increased
[22:32] their deification of mary until the 20th
[22:34] century saw in opposition to most
[22:36] high-ranking roman theologians
[22:38] pope pius literally exalt mary to
[22:40] glorification in a resurrected body
[22:43] that doctrine is absolutely the
[22:45] babylonish one of the sun carrying the
[22:47] mother bodily into heaven
[22:50] no wonder this fifth age goes right
[22:52] along with the other ages and will do so
[22:54] until it ends in the lake of fire where
[22:56] the and her children are killed in
[22:58] the second death
[22:59] there it is mariola tree the worship of
[23:01] civilly
[23:03] by the way did you know that sibylli was
[23:04] the astarte that jezebel was priestess
[23:06] too and caused israel to stumble by the
[23:09] licentious rights that she conducted
[23:12] yes that is who she was in the bible
[23:15] the age
[23:18] the sardisian or fifth church age lasted
[23:20] from 1520 to 1750
[23:23] it is usually called the age of the
[23:25] reformation
[23:27] the messenger
[23:29] the messenger to this age is the best
[23:31] known messenger of all the ages he was
[23:34] martin luther martin luther was a
[23:36] brilliant scholar of gentle disposition
[23:39] he was studying to be a lawyer when the
[23:41] lingering illness and death of a near
[23:43] friend caused him to become serious
[23:45] concerning the spiritual condition of
[23:46] his life
[23:48] he entered the augustinian convent at
[23:50] effort in 1505.
[23:52] there he studied philosophy and also the
[23:54] word of god
[23:56] he lived the life of severest penance
[23:58] but all the outward acts could not
[24:00] banish his sense of sin
[24:02] he said
[24:03] i tormented myself to death to make
[24:05] peace with god but i was in darkness and
[24:07] found it not
[24:09] the vicar general of his order staupitz
[24:12] helped him to gain the insight that his
[24:14] salvation would have to be the
[24:15] experience of an inner work rather than
[24:17] a ritual
[24:19] with this encouragement he further
[24:21] sought god
[24:22] later he became a priest
[24:24] as yet he was not saved
[24:26] he became an avid and deep student of
[24:28] the word and of the great theological
[24:30] works extent
[24:31] he was sought out as a teacher and
[24:33] preacher for his depth of knowledge and
[24:35] great sincerity
[24:36] to fulfill a vow he had made to himself
[24:38] he went to rome
[24:40] there he saw the futility of the
[24:42] church's imposed works that were to
[24:44] bring salvation and the word of god
[24:46] struck home to his heart
[24:48] the just shall live by faith
[24:50] on his return home the evangelical truth
[24:53] of this scripture flooded his mind and
[24:55] he was set free from sin and born into
[24:57] the kingdom of god
[24:59] soon after this he was elevated to
[25:00] doctor of divinity and commissioned
[25:03] to devote his whole life to study and
[25:05] faithfully expound and defend the holy
[25:07] scripture
[25:08] this he did and with such effect that
[25:11] his heart and the hearts of those around
[25:12] him were deeply fixed upon the truth of
[25:14] the word
[25:16] the word soon came into open conflict
[25:17] with the abuses of church creeds and
[25:19] doctrines
[25:21] thus when leo the tenth became pope and
[25:24] john tetzel came to sell indulgences for
[25:26] sin
[25:27] luther had no choice but to rise up
[25:29] against this anti-scriptural teaching
[25:31] first he thundered from the pulpit
[25:33] against it and then wrote his famous 95
[25:35] theses which on october 31 1517 he
[25:39] nailed to the door of castle church
[25:43] in a short time germany was ablaze and
[25:45] the reformation was on
[25:47] now let it be remembered that martin
[25:48] luther was not the only one who had
[25:50] protested the roman catholic church he
[25:53] was but one of many
[25:54] others had denied the popes their
[25:56] self-granted temporal and spiritual
[25:58] power and even amongst the popes there
[26:00] were minor temporary reforms
[26:03] yes there were many others who raised
[26:04] issues but in the case of luther
[26:07] god's time was ripe for a definite move
[26:09] that would be the beginning of the
[26:10] restoration of the church to an
[26:12] outpouring of the holy ghost at a much
[26:14] later date
[26:16] now martin luther himself was a
[26:18] sensitive spirit-filled christian
[26:20] he was definitely a man of the word for
[26:23] he not only had a profound passion to
[26:25] study it but to make it available to all
[26:27] in order that all might live by it
[26:30] he translated the new testament and gave
[26:32] it to the people
[26:33] this laborious work he did himself
[26:36] correcting a passage as much as 20 times
[26:39] he gathered around him a group of hebrew
[26:40] scholars amongst whom were jews and
[26:42] translated the old testament
[26:45] this monumental work of luther is still
[26:48] the work upon which all successive works
[26:50] of the scripture in germany have rested
[26:53] he was a mighty preacher
