[41:48] there SE expression in the early part of
[41:51] uh The Book of Revelation but let's go
[41:53] ahead and when those beasts had given
[41:55] glory and honor and and thanks to him
[41:58] that sat on the throne who who liveth
[42:01] forever and ever the four and 20 others
[42:07] fell down before him that sat on the
[42:09] throne and worshiped him that liveth
[42:11] forever and ever and cast their Throne
[42:14] before him before and cast their crowns
[42:19] Before the Throne saying thou are worthy
[42:23] oh Lord to receive glory and honor and
[42:27] power for thou have created all things
[42:31] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[42:38] created amen let's pray together father
[42:41] we just want to thank you tonight and
[42:43] Lord we just want to recap on few things
[42:46] oh god father and we pray that Lord you
[42:49] will come and help us tonight we just
[42:52] placing ourself before you now father
[42:54] and asking that you would bless us in a
[42:57] special way tonight in Jesus name amen
[43:01] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[43:02] your
[43:03] seat this evening I was a bit CAU
[43:06] between two thoughts two line of
[43:09] thoughts for the service tonight and uh
[43:13] uh if you remember back we spoke on uh
[43:17] uh the cup Bearer we spoke on the cup
[43:20] Bearer and so I was caught in a thought
[43:24] to to to speak on uh Contin Contin to
[43:27] speak on the cup Bearer because as we
[43:30] ended that service if you will
[43:32] remember uh uh we spoke of another cup
[43:36] Revelation chapter 17 there was a there
[43:39] was a woman that had a cup in her hand
[43:42] and that cup was filled with the blood
[43:45] of the Saints that's another cup thereof
[43:48] A system that is bearing a cup there has
[43:52] uh
[43:54] uh there has had the whole world the
[43:57] Bible says all the kings of the earth is
[44:00] drunk with uh with that wine that she
[44:04] has given so I wanted to go into that uh
[44:07] uh today but last night as I was uh I
[44:12] was I was studying actually uh
[44:17] uh
[44:19] yesterday and uh something caught my
[44:21] attention and it has to do with a little
[44:24] bit of uh uh history that uh you know
[44:28] and and as I was looking into it and I
[44:30] thought okay this uh this is going to is
[44:35] going to take us more than the time we
[44:37] want to spend on the Wednesday night and
[44:40] uh uh uh really need to give you a
[44:43] background for you to be able to grab
[44:45] there but let me just tetir your
[44:47] conscious on on on what what the thought
[44:51] is what is happening yet is there uh uh
[44:55] like we said Jesus
[44:57] one of his last word to the church was
[45:00] take this cup this is my blood drink it
[45:03] and uh uh uh uh my blood of the New
[45:07] Testament he says this bread eat it and
[45:11] this is my
[45:12] body now uh uh we will realize that uh
[45:19] uh as much as that was symbolic to the
[45:22] church we know that uh uh it will be
[45:27] very very important for us to understand
[45:31] that with the prophecy over in
[45:33] Revelation chapter 17 that runs over to
[45:36] Revelation chapter 18 mystery
[45:39] Babylon uh we will see
[45:43] that the Bible says all the kings of the
[45:47] Earth was drunk with the wine of her
[45:51] forication
[45:55] so I was actually going to bring it in
[45:58] the way for us to be able to realize
[46:01] that if you are not drinking from the
[46:04] Lost
[46:06] cup you are
[46:08] drinking
[46:10] from the cup of mysteries
[46:13] Babylon because it's a cup that the
[46:17] Bible says all the kings all the
[46:21] leaders all the president every
[46:24] country praise the Lord is drunk with
[46:28] the wine and I don't need to tell you if
[46:30] you look at what is happening out there
[46:32] in the word you will know only drunk men
[46:35] can behave like that praise the Lord
[46:38] amen you see what is happening in
[46:40] politics it's only drunk men that can
[46:43] behave like that man with all their I
[46:46] mean all their study all their uh uh
[46:48] learning you know uh uh uh uh and and
[46:52] and yet uh uh the economy of the word
[46:56] keep going back that uh you know uh uh
[47:00] with all the invention that they making
[47:02] we having more sicknesses that is
[47:04] breaking out the doctors can't find
[47:07] their their you know uh uh uh the name
[47:10] for it or what what is the cause of it
[47:13] and uh so we are living in a drunken
[47:17] word we are living in a drunken word and
[47:20] and when we get into and start to look
[47:23] into the scripture you will realize that
[47:26] uh uh uh spiritual drunkenness is more
[47:31] dangerous praise the Lord the man that
[47:34] is that is uh that is an alcoholic can
[47:36] be delivered we know Rosetta was
[47:39] delivered in the meetings of brother
[47:41] Brandon you know the man that is
[47:43] suffering from some kind of alcoholic
[47:45] Spirit can be delivered by God's grace
[47:48] if uh if the Lord comes down he can
[47:50] deliver but this drunkenness that is
[47:52] that is happening in the word I mean is
[47:55] is so is so terrible and it's on a
[47:58] prophecy so uh that's what I thought we
[48:01] will We I was going to go into tonight
[48:03] but I thought that maybe we would do
[48:04] that another time so I just I just felt
[48:08] like okay this is a Wednesday night and
[48:11] uh we were going to take up uh the
[48:13] prayer request that we
[48:14] did and uh uh I even thought there were
[48:18] going to be more prayer requests so we
[48:20] can just uh make a little prayer meeting
[48:22] tonight but that's only one we had so I
[48:26] thought I would use this not and then
[48:28] just go back and recap on what I was
[48:30] trying to we were we were fellowshipping
[48:33] around on Sunday praise the Lord amen so
[48:37] we can just go back and fellowship a
[48:40] little bit on uh
[48:43] uh uh the word of the Lord praise the
[48:47] Lord amen sometimes you you get under
[48:50] the inspiration and then uh you just
[48:53] keep going you don't I mean pay
[48:55] attention what the people grapping on
[48:57] that you just hope that the holy spirit
[48:59] will be able to bring it to them praise
[49:01] the Lord but we were over in Revelation
[49:02] chapter 5 now I read in Revelation
[49:05] chapter 4 just so we can be able
[49:10] to uh uh go back and cap on the the the
[49:14] four beasts or the four living creatures
[49:18] uh
[49:20] uh four Beast four living creatures
[49:23] that's that's how the Bible called them
[49:26] now so
[49:30] uh and what I want wanted us to to be
[49:34] able to grab and pay attention to you is
[49:37] that uh the Bible says uh uh in verse
[49:41] six that the four
[49:44] beasts uh um where four Beast four of
[49:49] eyes before and
[49:52] behind praise the Lord amen
[49:56] they were full of eyes before and behind
[50:00] now if you follow the little drama that
[50:04] we Tred to dramatize just keep that
[50:06] picture in your mind if you follow that
[50:09] you will realize that uh uh
[50:13] uh before then it looks like they having
[50:17] two eyes here and two eyes behind them
[50:20] but no because they don't move in
[50:23] separate
[50:24] Direction praise the Lord
[50:27] amen so if the lion is here and the ox
[50:31] is here when they are all under the
[50:34] Lion's anointing they only look that
[50:40] way so you see here they are not having
[50:43] a discussion and say me I see it this
[50:45] way this is the way I see it
[50:48] no so they are having eyes before and
[50:52] eyes
[50:54] behind now the beautiful thing that is
[50:58] also about that is that uh there is no
[51:02] way you can bypass the Beast because
[51:04] they're going to see
[51:06] you amen there is no way that you can
[51:10] bypass because they having eyes so that
[51:13] this one facing this way is the eyes
[51:15] before this one is an eyes behind this
[51:17] one facing this way could be an eyes
[51:19] before and this one facing this way is
[51:21] going to be a eyes eyes behind so it's
[51:24] not it's not more in a place they all uh
[51:27] you know each Beast have four eyes no
[51:30] they are all under one eye you remember
[51:33] the Bible talks about the eye of God
[51:36] moving to and for through the Earth it's
[51:39] just one
[51:40] eye okay it just it just I'm I'm not
[51:44] just meaning just one eye like one eye
[51:46] like this no but just it just you know
[51:49] One Direction looking in One Direction
[51:52] let me let me say it that way so you'll
[51:54] be able to grab the picture here praise
[51:56] the Lord
[51:57] amen so that is what I want I want you I
[52:00] want us to to be able to pay attention
[52:03] to yet that the four beasts uh uh there
[52:06] were four of ice before and behind that
[52:10] is just how much God is in control of
[52:13] what he's
[52:15] doing praise the Lord that is how much
[52:20] God is watching over his people and God
[52:24] is watching over his word the Lord do
[52:27] not sleep he do not
[52:30] Slumber are we together amen yes I want
[52:34] us to I want us to pay attention to that
[52:37] that the Lord do not sleep and he do not
[52:40] Slumber now there was uh that was uh
[52:45] uh you know that was uh one part of
[52:50] it that was one part of faith
[52:57] if you get down to verse 8 you'll see
[52:59] another picture there also the Bible
[53:01] says uh and they were full of eyes
[53:06] within they were four of eyes before and
[53:09] behind and they were four of eyes
[53:13] within praise the Lord are we
[53:17] together
[53:20] now this in the Bible represent
[53:25] power it represent
[53:27] power that's where uh uh uh uh science
[53:33] takes the word horsepower when it says
[53:36] your vehicle have this horsepower or
[53:38] this machine has this horsepower is is
[53:41] is all coming from there this in the
[53:44] Bible yeah represent power and what I
[53:47] want us to pay attention to also is that
[53:50] the Book of Revelation is a book of
[53:54] symbols are we together it's a sybol The
[53:58] Book of Revelation from Revelation
[54:01] chapter 1 the Bible says the revelation
[54:05] of Jesus
[54:08] Christ the revelation of Jesus
[54:13] Christ it will come in very handy I want
[54:16] you to remember that that book is is is
[54:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ and and
[54:23] and what also is important in there twoo
[54:26] that I want for us to pay attention to
[54:28] that was the only book that Jesus
[54:31] wrote John was just the
[54:34] Scribe he was doing the writing but he
[54:37] was instructed by our Lord Jesus Christ
[54:40] to write the things that he
[54:43] sees are we together
[54:48] amen now
[54:50] so
[54:54] uh revelation chapter 5 that we read
[54:58] from have a very unique position and
[55:02] that's what I want to I want to bring to
[55:04] you in in in a little way tonight if we
[55:06] don't get through it we we will we'll
[55:08] still have time so Revelation chapter
[55:12] 4 it shows
[55:15] us the full power the full
[55:19] anointing that God will use throughout
[55:24] the church ages
[55:26] the full anointing that God will use all
[55:31] through that God has been using all
[55:33] through ages to deal with his
[55:36] people let me bring it to you this way
[55:39] that you understand a little bit brother
[55:41] B preached a message influence and when
[55:44] he preached the message influence he
[55:46] read from Isaiah chapter
[55:48] 6 and then he he read that scripture
[55:53] where the Bible shows our
[55:57] coming to the temple breaking into
[56:00] vision and he's saying the angels with
[56:03] two Wings the fly and right your
[56:05] Revelation say they have six wings two
[56:07] Wings they fly two wings uh the they
[56:10] cover their feet and you know and and
[56:12] all of that now brother Brandon brought
[56:15] that message to us and he was talking
[56:18] about influence but what I want us to be
[56:21] able to to to grab the emphasis of the
[56:24] Holy Ghost brother random talks about
[56:27] one man influence upon another he used
[56:30] the example of word Isaiah was
[56:34] influenced by user but what I want us to
[56:38] pay attention to is that God took Isaiah
[56:42] in the temple to put him under a new
[56:46] influence praise the Lord if Isaiah will
[56:50] be a prophet to be able to bring the
[56:53] word of the Lord to the people he must
[56:56] get from under the influence of a man
[56:59] and get under the influence of the
[57:03] Angel are you seeing the picture he must
[57:06] get from under the influence of the
[57:08] church and get under the influence of
[57:11] the
[57:12] word praise the Lord he must get from
[57:16] under the influence of a man and get on
[57:19] God's influence so that that is that is
[57:22] that is what that is what the prophet of
[57:25] God was trying to bring to us that in
[57:28] this age God is putting the bride under
[57:32] Angelic
[57:33] influence praise the lord we are not
[57:36] influenced by by the World Council of
[57:38] churches we are not influenced by the
[57:41] national Affair neither by the politics
[57:44] our influence is coming from the
[57:47] Angels amen those seven angels that
[57:50] brought the that brought the the the the
[57:53] message of the opening of the seals
[57:55] that's where he was trying to get our
[57:57] attention
[57:59] to unveiling of God brother brandom said
[58:02] uh it is this place where uh uh uh you
[58:05] are saying things and not saying it and
[58:08] hoping that the people will grab
[58:11] it that's what the messenger was doing
[58:14] he was saying things hoping that we
[58:16] would be able to grab
[58:20] it are we together because you see the
[58:24] the the uh uh uh uh uh the message of
[58:28] the hour is a message of Revelation it's
[58:30] a message uh uh is God's secret to his
[58:33] people for the hour so you see God will
[58:36] allow the the prophets to be able to say
[58:39] some things that even the devil in all
[58:41] of his wisdom will not be able to grab
[58:43] it but the babies will be able to pick
[58:46] it up by Revelation
[58:49] amen so that's where I want for us to
[58:53] pay attention
[58:58] are we
[58:59] together Jesus at the beginning of the
[59:04] church at the beginning of the church
[59:07] when the disciples went out they healed
[59:09] the sick they came back they were
[59:11] rejoicing he says don't
[59:14] Rejoice because demons are subject to
[59:17] you he said rejoice in the opening of
[59:21] the
[59:22] seals Rejoice because your name is
[59:25] written on the book that's
[59:28] right praise the Lord he said because I
[59:31] see Satan falling like a
[59:33] lightning so just imagine a little
[59:37] Revelation that the that the that the
[59:39] disciples had had Satan falling how much
[59:43] more when the church come to full
[59:45] revelation of who she is she will be an
[59:49] invisible Army and the devil will be
[59:51] under her
[59:53] feet praise the Lord so you see the word
[59:57] the message just come to empower you the
[1:00:00] message come to show you who you
[1:00:05] are are we
[1:00:08] together
[1:00:12] Amen brother bam says Revelation chapter
[1:00:14] 5 is one of the sublime scripture in the
[1:00:17] Bible Revelation chapter 5 is a
[1:00:21] parenthesis it's a parenthesis it's
[1:00:24] between chapter 4 and chapter
[1:00:27] 6 and I will show you a little bit what
[1:00:30] is happening between chapter 4 and
[1:00:32] chapter
[1:00:34] 6
[1:00:36] amen so in chapter 4 we have seen the
[1:00:42] power from the throne that is going to
[1:00:44] influence the
[1:00:45] church let's read chapter

[1:02:11] friends
[1:02:14] come bring your bring your
[1:02:17] Bible it's a book of symbol so it's good

[1:02:26] here open your Bible just open your
[1:02:30] Bible praise the Lord amen we'll come
[1:02:33] back to Revelation chapter 5 but pay
[1:02:35] attention now re realize that it's in
[1:02:38] Revelation chapter 5 that the lamb took
[1:02:41] the book and lose the
[1:02:43] seals
[1:02:45] amen now so in Revelation chapter
[1:02:49] 6 Revelation chapter 5 the lamb open one
[1:02:54] of the seal
[1:02:57] and I heard it John said I heard
[1:03:00] it and it
[1:03:02] was a noise of thunder and one of the
[1:03:06] four Beast said come come and see praise
[1:03:09] the Lord are we
[1:03:13] together this is the Lamb that has
[1:03:15] opened the book are we together the book
[1:03:19] is
[1:03:20] open this is
[1:03:23] John this is the Beast
[1:03:27] right when the lamb open the
[1:03:31] book and loose a
[1:03:33] seal this Beast said to John come and
[1:03:39] see the Beast is showing John what is
[1:03:44] what the lamb has
[1:03:47] opened are we
[1:03:49] together okay just stay right there
[1:04:01] the Beast said come and
[1:04:03] see then John in verse two says and I
[1:04:09] saw so when the Beast show John say come
[1:04:13] and see come come come John come and see
[1:04:17] John is
[1:04:18] saying this is what I saw this is what
[1:04:22] was pointed to me
[1:04:28] are you
[1:04:29] seeing
[1:04:31] okay the lamb open the
[1:04:36] book and there is a beast here re
[1:04:39] remember now the Beast is a power the
[1:04:42] Beast is an
[1:04:47] anointing are we
[1:04:49] together now so this anointing is going
[1:04:52] to open John eyes to
[1:04:57] see what is in the
[1:05:01] book and when John look in the book he
[1:05:04] says this is what I
[1:05:06] saw praise the
[1:05:10] Lord let me open the book to the right
[1:05:14] place let me help the lamb to open the
[1:05:17] book to the right
[1:05:22] place praise the Lord
[1:05:28] are we
[1:05:31] together okay
[1:05:33] so the John is now saying verse two I
[1:05:37] saw and
[1:05:41] behold a white horse and he that sat on
[1:05:45] him had a bow and a crown was given to
[1:05:49] him and he went forth to
[1:05:53] conquer amen
[1:05:56] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:05:59] now so the lamb opened the
[1:06:02] book The Beast which is the
[1:06:06] anointing is now opening John eyes to
[1:06:09] see what the lamb has open are we
[1:06:13] together now so John is now seeing a
[1:06:20] vision the Beast remember now it's a
[1:06:23] symbol it's just a symbol right the
[1:06:26] Beast is representing an anointing the
[1:06:29] anointing that open your eyes to see
[1:06:32] water
[1:06:33] baptism that is not father Son and the
[1:06:35] Holy Ghost is the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ it's not your intelligence is an
[1:06:42] anointing that open your
[1:06:45] eyes if God don't open your eyes you
[1:06:48] will not see it it's an anointing that
[1:06:50] open your eyes for you to see
[1:06:53] de Hallelujah
[1:06:56] are you seeing it so John is
[1:06:59] representing the church that's right
[1:07:02] he's representing the entire
[1:07:06] church he's directed by the anointing
[1:07:10] the anointing is giving him an
[1:07:12] instruction the anointing is opening his
[1:07:16] eyes Isaiah said is the anointing that
[1:07:19] breaks the
[1:07:22] Yoke are we together so the Beast the
[1:07:26] the anointing is saying John come and
[1:07:28] see I will show you I will open your
[1:07:34] eyes are we together praise the Lord
[1:07:39] amen what I want you to also understand
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:43] that in Revelation chapter 5 that is the
[1:07:49] parenthesis are we together John was
[1:07:53] told the lion of the Trap of
[1:07:57] Judah has
[1:08:00] prevailed are we together who is the
[1:08:03] lion of the Trap of
[1:08:05] Judah who is the lion of the Trap of
[1:08:10] Judah what's
[1:08:15] happening what's happening to message
[1:08:20] people your problem is that you are
[1:08:22] afraid to be wrong
[1:08:26] that's your
[1:08:27] problem I mean you must respond to the
[1:08:29] word and realize that you can never be
[1:08:32] wrong you can never be
[1:08:37] wrong are we
[1:08:40] together who is the lion of the Trap of
[1:08:43] Judah
[1:08:46] Jesus Jesus is the lion of the Trap of
[1:08:49] Judah who is the Lamb of
[1:08:52] God
[1:08:53] Jesus what's wrong with her
[1:08:58] praise the
[1:09:00] Lord the the hether
[1:09:03] said the lion of the tribe of
[1:09:07] Judah has
[1:09:09] prevailed praise the
[1:09:12] Lord and when John looked he saw a
[1:09:18] lamb the the Ed was not
[1:09:22] wrong the Ed never made a mistake
[1:09:27] the he was
[1:09:29] right because the hether was seeing the
[1:09:33] anointing that
[1:09:37] prevailed the anointing that prevailed
[1:09:40] was the Lion's
[1:09:42] anointing that's what the Ed was seeing
[1:09:45] praise the Lord you have to realize that
[1:09:48] John also was under the Lion's anointing
[1:09:52] because the lion anointing begin with
[1:09:54] the first church
[1:09:57] age are we
[1:10:00] together but when John turned around he
[1:10:03] saw a
[1:10:05] lamb it was it was our lord Jesus you
[1:10:08] see that's the reason why you got to
[1:10:10] keep symbols in your mind is our lord
[1:10:14] Jesus playing two
[1:10:18] roles one Ro as an overcomer and one Ro
[1:10:23] as a sacrifice
[1:10:28] are we together
[1:10:33] amen now so that is that is that's
[1:10:38] that's that's what that's what the Beast
[1:10:40] showed
[1:10:41] John when the first SE was
[1:10:44] open now realize now pay
[1:10:50] attention and that Beast that show John
[1:10:56] what was in the first
[1:11:00] seal the
[1:11:02] Bible
[1:11:07] said one of one of the beasts the Bible
[1:11:10] said I heard there was a noise and and
[1:11:13] said come and see it now so the Bible
[1:11:15] said one of the beast but if you pay
[1:11:17] attention as we go along you will
[1:11:19] realize that that Beast was the lion yes
[1:11:24] amen it was the The Lion anointing that
[1:11:28] showed John what was in the first seat
[1:11:30] and what the lion anointing was showing
[1:11:33] John is that pay attention
[1:11:36] now the Bible said verse two and I saw
[1:11:40] and behold a white horse now horse is
[1:11:45] also a
[1:11:46] beast just like Lion is a beast HSE is a
[1:11:53] beast so the the the lion anointing was
[1:11:58] showing
[1:12:01] John the anointing that will be fighting
[1:12:04] against him
[1:12:07] right the anointing that will be trying
[1:12:09] to conquer the
[1:12:14] church praise the
[1:12:16] Lord if if the Beast did not open John
[1:12:20] eyes John will think that is this
[1:12:23] brother that don't love me or this
[1:12:24] sister I don't love me oh is this person
[1:12:27] but as the anointing open John eyes John
[1:12:31] begins to see that there is a
[1:12:34] power that is trying to conquer the
[1:12:38] church a power that is trying to bring
[1:12:41] division among the people a PR a power
[1:12:44] that is trying to kill the people prayer
[1:12:46] life right a power that is trying to
[1:12:49] make the people
[1:12:52] backslide what was that H doing
[1:12:55] conquering it was conquering it was
[1:12:59] weakening the
[1:13:01] people are we together so the Beast is
[1:13:05] showing John pay attention
[1:13:09] here when the first seal open look the
[1:13:13] Beast is opening John eyes just like
[1:13:16] Elijah they to Gesa on the mountain when
[1:13:19] he open his eyes he saw the the the the
[1:13:21] the mountain filled with angels and then
[1:13:24] he could say there are more with us than
[1:13:28] them that are against us so if God do
[1:13:30] not open your eyes you will not even see
[1:13:33] what is happening in the service that's
[1:13:34] right it will just be a place you come
[1:13:37] through the door and you go out that's
[1:13:43] right are we
[1:13:46] together
[1:13:48] amen then we read again buy y bear with
[1:13:52] me
[1:13:53] okay you help to
[1:13:57] preach verse three and when he had
[1:14:01] opened the second seal I heard the
[1:14:06] second beast what was the second beast
[1:14:09] according to Revelation chapter 4 why
[1:14:12] was the second
[1:14:16] beast talk if you know it the O A
[1:14:22] Cal that was the second beast so when
[1:14:25] when he when when when he open when the
[1:14:28] lamb open the second
[1:14:31] seal remember now the lamb is Christ
[1:14:35] when he open the second
[1:14:38] seal the anointing is also the anointing
[1:14:42] of
[1:14:45] Christ
[1:14:49] amen
[1:14:52] so and it's the anointing that is is
[1:14:55] opening so what I'm trying to show you
[1:14:57] here is that it's the lamb that is
[1:14:59] opening the seal the lamb is the
[1:15:01] anointing and is the Lamb that is
[1:15:03] opening John eyes so it's the lamb that
[1:15:07] is doing everything it's the lamb that
[1:15:09] is convicting people it's the lamb that
[1:15:11] is changing lives is the Lamb that is
[1:15:14] healing sick is the Lamb that is it's
[1:15:16] the lamb that is doing
[1:15:22] everything if you don't see the lamb you
[1:15:24] will think you are the one doing
[1:15:28] it that's why when John looked to see a
[1:15:31] lion he saw the
[1:15:33] lamb we must see the lamb all the time
[1:15:36] and when you see the bleeding lamb it
[1:15:38] will humble you all the
[1:15:43] time are we
[1:15:50] together so the lamb
[1:15:55] has brought another anointing to show
[1:15:59] John something
[1:16:01] different praise the Lord amen the lamb
[1:16:06] has
[1:16:07] introduced the church to another an
[1:16:10] anointing because the first anointing
[1:16:13] which was the lion anointing led the
[1:16:16] first three Church
[1:16:18] ages praise the Lord amen that's where
[1:16:23] great missionary work the disciples were
[1:16:26] Brave to go to any part of the world why
[1:16:28] because they were under the
[1:16:30] anointing but when catholism to started
[1:16:33] strangling the
[1:16:35] church when catholism started you know
[1:16:39] trying to organize the church praise the
[1:16:42] Lord amen God had to bring another
[1:16:47] anointing to bypass the Beast
[1:16:52] system praise the Lord
[1:16:56] because as Catholic as catholism was
[1:16:59] attacking the church the church was
[1:17:02] under persecution if God did not give
[1:17:05] the people an O anointing they would be
[1:17:08] afraid right take for
[1:17:11] example when Jesus was arrested all
[1:17:14] those disciple deny
[1:17:17] him those very same men that were
[1:17:19] celebrating demons are subject to us the
[1:17:22] night that Jesus was arrested every one
[1:17:25] of them the Bible say every one of
[1:17:28] them Peter deny him there was one the
[1:17:31] Bible says in the gate the ask another
[1:17:33] one he said no I don't know them every
[1:17:34] one of them deny him every one of them
[1:17:36] so you see God had to give the church an
[1:17:39] anointing for the season that's right
[1:17:42] that they were
[1:17:46] in and that is the same thing that he do
[1:17:48] to us he gave us an anointing for the
[1:17:51] season that we are in
[1:17:56] praise the
[1:17:57] Lord that's the reason why there is
[1:18:00] nothing that come against the church
[1:18:02] that we came be
[1:18:09] right so as the church was
[1:18:12] organizing and the Roman system was
[1:18:15] attacking the church God
[1:18:17] now the lamb had to come in the form of
[1:18:21] an
[1:18:22] ox the the lamb has to anoint the church
[1:18:26] with an ox
[1:18:28] anointing are we
[1:18:31] together
[1:18:33] so the second beast the Bible says said
[1:18:37] to John come and see it so the second
[1:18:41] beast now is now going to
[1:18:45] expose by Revelation which is Vision to
[1:18:49] join the Antichrist power so you have to
[1:18:52] see it's two powers
[1:18:55] Christ power is in four beasts the lion
[1:18:59] the ox the man The Eagle right amen
[1:19:03] that's Christ power for the church
[1:19:06] that's the power that Christ locked the
[1:19:08] church in eyes within Eyes Without Eyes
[1:19:12] before eyes
[1:19:15] behind are we together but now the power
[1:19:19] of Christ the anointing of Christ must
[1:19:23] also expose the Antichrist
[1:19:26] anointing so the Holy Ghost now is
[1:19:29] calling John come and see it you come
[1:19:31] and see it when the second seals were
[1:19:34] open come let me show you how the devil
[1:19:37] will hide himself among the people the
[1:19:40] first time he came he came like a like a
[1:19:43] warrior he had a board but he did not
[1:19:46] have no Arrow a deceiver you cannot go
[1:19:50] to war with b and you don't have an
[1:19:52] arrow to
[1:19:53] strike but you see All Through the
[1:19:57] Ages the people has believed that that
[1:20:01] that beast on on a white it was on the
[1:20:03] white hearse you know ring and
[1:20:05] conquering they call it the Holy Ghost
[1:20:08] All Through the Ages they believe that
[1:20:10] that was the Holy Ghost but when the
[1:20:12] seals were open brother Brandon said no
[1:20:14] it's an antichrist because he had a bow
[1:20:17] he never had no
[1:20:21] Arrow are we together are you seeing the
[1:20:24] picture
[1:20:25] now so when the second seal was
[1:20:31] open praise the
[1:20:35] Lord the second beast said come and see
[1:20:38] come John come and see it and there went
[1:20:42] out
[1:20:43] another house that was red the first one
[1:20:47] was white the second one is red is also
[1:20:53] a power
[1:20:55] praise the Lord amen the first one was
[1:21:00] white innocent it was an innocent power
[1:21:03] that creep among the church innocent
[1:21:07] spirit the Deeds of the
[1:21:09] nian or all we trying to do we just
[1:21:12] trying to put people in their place you
[1:21:14] know uh I mean y y sure you know the the
[1:21:17] pastor must have this seat you know uh
[1:21:19] uh this this is for the clergy this is
[1:21:21] for the in just innocent
[1:21:25] innocent uh infiltrating of the enemy
[1:21:27] that separated the
[1:21:30] people make the leot a lower class and
[1:21:34] the clergy a higher
[1:21:39] class it was
[1:21:42] white now when the second beast came
[1:21:45] this this one now it has a
[1:21:47] color it's
[1:21:50] red and see what the Bible says and
[1:21:53] power was given giv to
[1:21:55] him that sat there
[1:21:58] on to take peace from the earth so it
[1:22:03] was it was it was a spirit it was an
[1:22:05] anointing if it's taking peace what is
[1:22:08] it
[1:22:10] bringing if it taking peace what is it
[1:22:13] bringing
[1:22:15] War if it's taking peace what is it
[1:22:18] bringing if he taking peace what is it
[1:22:20] bringing War
[1:22:29] Christ is the Prince of Peace so he will
[1:22:32] not take
[1:22:34] Peace So this cannot be a spirit of
[1:22:39] God that will be taking peace off the
[1:22:42] Earth and if it's bringing War
[1:22:45] definitely is
[1:22:48] identifying a time of
[1:22:51] Bloodshed where the Christians will be
[1:22:53] killed
[1:22:57] are we
[1:22:59] together are you getting the
[1:23:13] picture he took peace from the earth and
[1:23:17] that they should kill one another and
[1:23:20] there was given unto him a great sword
[1:23:24] it's a swore of death are we together I
[1:23:28] just want to to to be able to just grab
[1:23:31] something and then and then have
[1:23:34] uh these boys to sit down now verse five
[1:23:38] and when he had open the te
[1:23:41] seal I heard the te beast and what was
[1:23:46] the te
[1:23:47] Beast Revelation chapter 4 what was the
[1:23:50] T
[1:23:51] be
[1:23:53] man praise the
[1:23:55] Lord man was the te Beast the anointing
[1:23:58] of a man
[1:24:01] wisdom
[1:24:03] intellect
[1:24:05] okay and uh so the T Beast said to John
[1:24:09] come and SE and then when John look I
[1:24:12] beheld and L a black
[1:24:15] horse it's getting darker it was first
[1:24:19] White it went red and now it's black
[1:24:25] so you see the enemy power is
[1:24:29] increasing the Demon's power is
[1:24:31] increasing is intense in it first came
[1:24:35] in innocently that's how the enemy will
[1:24:38] always
[1:24:39] come it's just an innocent joke it's
[1:24:43] just an innocent game it's just an
[1:24:46] innocent
[1:24:51] saying that's how he will enter then now
[1:24:55] he start taking
[1:24:58] form when he start taking
[1:25:00] form then it start getting
[1:25:03] serious what was an innocent joke start
[1:25:06] becoming serious what was an innocent
[1:25:09] game start becoming
[1:25:18] serious that's a reason why there's no
[1:25:20] innocent lie right because brother brand
[1:25:24] says every lie is an entrance of a
[1:25:28] devil there is no innocent lie there is
[1:25:31] no joking
[1:25:34] line are we
[1:25:36] together it went from white red
[1:25:46] black you see
[1:25:49] God God the
[1:25:51] lamb so care for his church
[1:25:54] church not to leave us blindly just go
[1:25:59] to church and come home just go to
[1:26:00] church and come home he so care for the
[1:26:02] church that he's calling the church to
[1:26:05] come and see
[1:26:06] it giving the church ministry that will
[1:26:09] open their eyes giving the church word
[1:26:12] that will expose them to the time that
[1:26:15] they are living in and the things that
[1:26:17] is happening around them
[1:26:24] that's the reason why you have yourself
[1:26:25] to
[1:26:27] blame you have yourself to
[1:26:33] blame if you allow the enemy to torment
[1:26:36] you you allow the enemy to you know rule
[1:26:39] You by some kind of a habit you have
[1:26:42] yourself to
[1:26:44] blame because God has given us enough
[1:26:49] word to expose the
[1:26:51] devil enough word to bring you above
[1:26:56] your
[1:26:58] struggle that how much God care for his
[1:27:05] church are we together let's go
[1:27:08] quickly you read that when you go home
[1:27:11] verse 7even and when he have opened the
[1:27:14] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:27:17] fourth Beast what is the fourth Beast
[1:27:20] ego beautiful beautiful I heard the
[1:27:24] voice of the fourth Beast saying come
[1:27:26] and see and I look and
[1:27:31] behold this one is pure which mean the
[1:27:34] mix of color white red black have
[1:27:39] mixed
[1:27:41] death hell itself yes
[1:27:45] sir which mean that the that the enemy
[1:27:48] power from the first three Church ages
[1:27:50] the the the enemy power from the Dark
[1:27:52] Age and the enemy power from the
[1:27:54] reformer Everything Has Come
[1:27:57] Together that's the reason why it's so
[1:27:59] hard to live Christian Life unless God
[1:28:03] give you a birth unless God give you a
[1:28:12] revelation because all the spirits from
[1:28:16] from from that crucify Jesus Christ that
[1:28:18] ran behind the Apostle they are all in
[1:28:20] this day fighting against you
[1:28:26] Bel belonging to the message is not all
[1:28:28] about
[1:28:29] it I believe the message I baptized in
[1:28:31] Jesus name it's not all about it we are
[1:28:33] not we are not into a picnic we are into
[1:28:36] a battle
[1:28:37] yes it's a battle that is already w we
[1:28:40] have to stay under the cross we have to
[1:28:42] listen to the instruction of the Lamb
[1:28:44] when he said come and see open your eyes
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:48] see don't sleep in church
[1:29:00] so in as much as there there are four
[1:29:03] anointing that should gather
[1:29:06] Church the lamb has also revealed four
[1:29:09] anointing that is fighting against the
[1:29:14] church God bless you boys say that thank
[1:29:17] you
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:27] are you seeing the
[1:29:33] picture and these four
[1:29:35] anointing they don't have no Christmas
[1:29:38] plan for
[1:29:39] you praise the Lord amen no they don't
[1:29:43] have no Christmas plan if if if if they
[1:29:46] were not important if they were not
[1:29:49] destructive the line would not reveal
[1:29:51] them the line would not expose them if
[1:29:54] they were things that we must just
[1:29:58] Overlook they are the powers that is
[1:30:00] Waring against our children the power
[1:30:02] that is Waring against our marriage the
[1:30:04] power that is Waring against our
[1:30:17] church are we together
[1:30:26] now you see that's that's the reason
[1:30:31] why Revelation chapter
[1:30:34] 5 was or is the most
[1:30:38] Sublime scripture in the
[1:30:44] Bible glory be to
[1:30:47] God because
[1:30:54] like I said and brother brah said Christ
[1:30:58] is revealed in his own word he said what
[1:31:00] is the seal the seal is
[1:31:03] Christ you have to understand it that
[1:31:06] way the seal is the releasing of
[1:31:11] Christ because what Adam fell from Adam
[1:31:15] fell from the very life of
[1:31:20] God he was a Son of God made in the
[1:31:23] image of God and God birth into his
[1:31:26] nostril and he became a living
[1:31:28] Soul so when the enemy came and
[1:31:32] introduced a perverted life to him he
[1:31:35] fell from the life of God the very life
[1:31:37] of
[1:31:40] God and that's what this message have
[1:31:43] come to restore not just to make you a
[1:31:46] church member this message has come to
[1:31:49] strike your soul with the very life of
[1:31:51] God
[1:31:55] so we must not take proud and worship
[1:31:57] our nature well that's my nature that's
[1:31:59] the way I can behave it's not good it
[1:32:01] will ruin you to hell yes the devil have
[1:32:04] access to that nature
[1:32:10] right you just praying your nature whole
[1:32:12] day it's not even helping
[1:32:17] you praise the
[1:32:22] Lord whenever when whenever we fall and
[1:32:25] whenever we get into a weak position
[1:32:27] well that's my nature that's my
[1:32:34] weakness I can read something to you
[1:32:36] from from uh souls in praising brother
[1:32:39] BR says all the church ages from Ephesus
[1:32:42] to laaa he said they were all under the
[1:32:47] blood this
[1:32:49] age has been given the life that was in
[1:32:52] the blood
[1:32:54] that's what the token
[1:33:06] is that's the reason why uh H uh uh uh
[1:33:10] uh uh we we have a word of such a high
[1:33:16] standard people come around they don't
[1:33:19] understand
[1:33:20] it why because it's the releasing of
