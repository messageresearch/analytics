[40:21] [Music]
[40:40] to be in the presence of God
[40:45] um if you want to care about the cases
[40:47] of this life
[40:49] you wouldn't even want to go to church
[40:52] because
[40:54] life outside is just so so so busy
[40:58] and everybody's in the fast lane
[41:01] and if you want to consider that
[41:03] you'll find a very good reason not to be
[41:07] here this morning
[41:08] but if in the midst of it all
[41:12] you have made way to be here
[41:14] then just be rest assured
[41:17] that God is going to meet you without a
[41:21] doubt
[41:21] praise be to God we are here to serve
[41:25] God
[41:25] we are here for his course
[41:28] we are not here to be seen
[41:31] we are here to lift him up
[41:33] the days are getting too ahead
[41:36] time is no more
[41:39] praise be to God and the devil knows it
[41:43] but it is sad
[41:45] that we that name the name of the Lord
[41:49] we that call ourselves children of God
[41:53] we lose sight of it
[41:55] we think we have more time when the
[41:58] devil our adversary knows he's running
[42:00] out of time and then we lay down our
[42:03] guards
[42:04] Lord have mercy
[42:06] Mercy just be rest assured
[42:08] that God is going to meet you why you
[42:11] need him the most
[42:15] when it's time to wake go to work
[42:17] when it's time to make the money make
[42:20] the money
[42:21] yesterday
[42:22] we met the preacher brothers and Bibi
[42:25] and myself
[42:26] and I just shared a little story
[42:29] depending on what the atmosphere was
[42:31] about a Sierra Leone
[42:34] man
[42:36] who actually was a truck driver
[42:39] and he had no house
[42:42] he has no I mean room he was a semi
[42:47] driver and he had this double cabin
[42:49] truck
[42:50] so
[42:52] inside there was his bedroom
[42:54] he would drive anywhere he reaches he
[42:57] sleeps in
[42:58] he did that for two years
[43:02] finished building his house in Sierra
[43:04] Leone walled rounded
[43:06] and then one morning he called a friend
[43:09] he had a friend called him or he called
[43:11] and they spoke
[43:13] and two days later nobody knew where he
[43:15] was
[43:17] so they said no the last time I spoke
[43:19] with him it was I think in Tennessee
[43:22] and the sister somewhere in New York
[43:24] called the police
[43:25] and they went to that stop lo and behold
[43:28] the car was parked there when they
[43:29] opened he was dead
[43:34] what account are you going to give
[43:38] we can only talk of today not even today
[43:41] we can talk of this moment
[43:44] and what is behind we don't know what
[43:47] the future goes
[43:48] so for every opportunity you have make
[43:52] sure
[43:53] that you are do make make getting the
[43:56] best out of it
[43:58] so
[44:00] we are in the presence of God
[44:03] just trust and belief that God is going
[44:06] to meet you somehow
[44:08] praise the Lord today

[44:13] to us
[44:15] and uh he comes from Ghana
[44:17] I have spoken with him before
[44:19] but it's good to always have a name
[44:21] behind the face or rather a face behind
[44:25] in there praise the Lord so he happened
[44:28] to come around this time
[44:30] uh yesterday was the first time I met
[44:33] him brothers and Bibi has known him for

[44:45] pastor of one of the message churches in
[44:48] Cape Coast the central regional capital
[44:51] of Ghana

[44:55] he'll be taking the service this morning
[44:57] so just pray for him I hope you are
[45:01] prayed up
[45:03] I hope you are afraid of praise be to
[45:06] God so he is going to take the service
[45:09] this morning
[45:10] and we are trusting and believing
[45:12] that God would use him to minister unto

[50:42] moment
[50:48] grateful for the Lord making a way for
[50:51] me to be here with you today
[50:57] it's been
[50:59] 23 years
[51:02] something
[51:04] since I came here

[51:28] spoke with brother one and
[51:31] he
[51:33] welcomed me coming here even though he
[51:36] would not be here today
[51:39] but the one I've spoken with quite
[51:43] some time or several times but then
[51:47] I have not had the opportunity to
[51:49] actually be here

[51:53] Stephen
[51:57] oh yeah but Steven I've known him and
[52:00] the family

[52:57] we are the most privileged people on
[53:00] this planet as
[53:03] no because
[53:06] of where we are
[53:10] not because of anything that we have
[53:12] done
[53:14] because of what you have done for us
[53:18] being that you have given us a name
[53:20] which this world cannot give
[53:23] as Sons and Daughters of God
[53:28] father you have placed us where this
[53:31] worker never Place anyone

[53:46] unto me let us go to the house of the
[53:48] Lord
[53:49] many are spending their time at this
[53:51] time oh God doing things that do not
[53:55] benefit
[53:57] but Lord he brought us safe here into
[54:00] your courses
[54:02] that is the most peaceful the most
[54:04] assuring place for everyone to find
[54:07] himself

[54:11] day which is the beginning of another
[54:12] week

[54:23] unrighteousness
[54:25] help us Lord to walk in your way
[54:29] to live your word
[54:31] to the word of God becomes fleshy enough
[54:36] we are grateful for that time
[54:39] let your welcome fall to us
[54:42] pray the Lord into Minister unto every
[54:45] heart your word will not come to us and
[54:48] return to your Void may it accomplish
[54:51] the purpose for today
[54:53] we also remember our father and Pastor
[54:56] one God
[54:57] father make him a Channel of blessing
[55:00] over there with much of your anointing
[55:03] upon him
[55:04] father we will not live here to our
[55:07] various homes empty like we came but
[55:11] better
[55:12] than we came we commit it all into your
[55:15] hands I take every Spirit under my
[55:18] control in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:20] Christ
[55:21] father even those who could not make it
[55:23] today Lord wherever they are may they
[55:26] have their portion of the children's
[55:28] bread
[55:29] in Jesus Christ's name we pray with
[55:32] Thanksgiving amen
[55:36] so please open our Bibles to Acts
[55:38] chapter 24
[55:41] and then we read verse 14 Acts chapter
[55:44] 24 and verse 14.
[55:49] acts 24 Miss 14.
[55:54] let's hear the word of the Lord
[55:58] by this I confess unto thee
[56:02] that after the way which they call
[56:05] heresy
[56:06] so worship I the god of my fathers
[56:10] believe in all things which are written
[56:13] in the law and in the prophets
[56:17] amen
[56:25] and this morning he permits me I want to
[56:28] talk about the Faith of Our Fathers
[56:31] the Faith of Our Fathers
[56:34] and Paul is saying that
[56:37] this is his confession
[56:41] now the way that the people call heresy
[56:45] that is the way he worships
[56:48] the god of his fathers believing all
[56:51] things
[56:53] that are written and in the law and in
[56:56] the prophets
[56:57] the weather is called heresy
[57:00] now just looking at the meaning of
[57:03] heresy in the dictionary
[57:06] it says any opinions
[57:09] or doctrines at variance with the
[57:12] official or Orthodox position
[57:17] the second definition says I believe
[57:20] that rejects the Orthodox tenants of a
[57:23] religion a belief that rejects the
[57:26] autonomous Orthodox tenants
[57:29] of every religion then I want ahead to
[57:31] look for the meaning of tenets
[57:34] it is it's a religious doctrine that is
[57:37] proclaimed as true without proof
[57:42] a religious doctrine that is proclaimed
[57:44] as
[57:45] the truth without proof so
[57:49] now what
[57:52] the out of those
[57:54] religion proclaims to be truth
[57:58] cannot be put
[58:00] they have without proof
[58:06] you know there's always the truth and
[58:09] the false food that's right
[58:11] all cannot be true and all cannot be
[58:14] false
[58:19] cannot receive the truth
[58:22] the prophet said every Revival brings
[58:25] forth or produces twins
[58:28] every Revival produces twins
[58:32] Hallelujah so there is always the wheat
[58:36] and then the taste
[58:39] and we cannot talk about the wheat
[58:41] without talking about the test
[58:45] because
[58:46] they go together
[58:49] Hallelujah
[58:51] in a message the seed of the nicotines
[58:54] or nicotanism
[58:57] the prophet said now
[59:00] to get a real meaning of what we are
[59:03] about to go into
[59:05] I must question you to ever keep in mind
[59:08] that religion
[59:11] spiritual matters if you like is
[59:13] composed of two parts that intertwine
[59:17] but as opposite as black and white
[59:22] religion and the spiritual world are
[59:25] made of two trees which have their roots
[59:29] in eating
[59:31] more of the tree of life and the tree of
[59:33] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[59:36] midst of the garden
[59:38] and no doubt they are very branches
[59:40] intertwined each other
[59:44] thus in the official Church
[59:47] is that same paradox
[59:50] the church is made up of good and bad
[59:53] amen
[59:55] two Vines make the church so there are
[59:59] two vines that make the church the good
[1:00:01] and the bad
[1:00:02] the Allah the wheat and the test growing
[1:00:05] up side by side
[1:00:07] but one is the truth
[1:00:09] the other is false
[1:00:11] amen now God will speak to each one and
[1:00:16] he will talk about each one
[1:00:19] he will call them the church
[1:00:22] both of them the truth and the fourth
[1:00:26] the true church and the false church God
[1:00:28] called them all the church
[1:00:32] they said and only the elect will really
[1:00:35] know what is the true spirit
[1:00:38] only the elect will not be deceived
[1:00:43] Hallelujah
[1:00:47] I'm glad when brother Asante was Stephen
[1:00:50] was playing praying this morning he made
[1:00:53] mention of how we have to walk the way
[1:00:55] the apostles walked and that is exactly
[1:00:58] what I want to talk about
[1:01:00] it so it was just a Prelude of my
[1:01:02] message
[1:01:03] Hallelujah you know Paul was converted
[1:01:07] from Judaism and to Christianity
[1:01:11] he fiercely
[1:01:13] ah kind of persecuted
[1:01:19] the Christian religion of the Christians
[1:01:22] in those days
[1:01:24] and when he was doing that
[1:01:27] he thought that he was preserving the
[1:01:31] faith of his fathers
[1:01:34] and little did he know that he was
[1:01:36] rather fighting against the faith of
[1:01:38] their fathers
[1:01:40] and to his conversion
[1:01:42] he thought he was right he was so
[1:01:45] zealous for God he wanted to preserve
[1:01:48] the Traditions all the the better words
[1:01:52] the faith of his fathers
[1:01:58] now what's happening is that not only in
[1:02:01] our age but in all ages
[1:02:05] when anything new comes so-called new
[1:02:09] comes all the other people will say oh
[1:02:13] there's a new church
[1:02:15] this is a new doctrine
[1:02:17] uh
[1:02:20] I was born in maybe the correct church I
[1:02:24] was born in this and I'll die in it that
[1:02:26] the faith of my fathers this is that and
[1:02:29] that they will say so many things oh
[1:02:31] your church is so new how old is your
[1:02:35] church they made a whole lot of
[1:02:38] negative comments
[1:02:42] our fathers believe this and they have
[1:02:44] lived with it
[1:02:45] even today they have stickers
[1:02:48] I am proud to be a presbyterian
[1:02:51] I was born in the previous Presbyterian
[1:02:54] I would die Presbyterian fine they're
[1:02:56] all nice
[1:02:57] Hallelujah
[1:02:59] but you see they don't know that along
[1:03:02] the line
[1:03:07] the faith that was given to our fathers
[1:03:10] the apostolic father
[1:03:13] didn't run through along the line there
[1:03:17] were human interventions
[1:03:20] they added here they took away this way
[1:03:24] and that way
[1:03:26] so
[1:03:28] after some time it became adulterated
[1:03:33] no they were not having the true word
[1:03:38] it was known
[1:03:40] polluted right
[1:03:42] right if I I can say that it does not
[1:03:45] pollute it wasn't the true word that was
[1:03:48] originally given to our Apostolic
[1:03:51] fathers
[1:03:53] now a counterfeit had been presented to
[1:03:56] them and they continue to
[1:03:58] dwell or not and believe in that and all
[1:04:03] that
[1:04:04] is it they say that they say there's a
[1:04:06] saying that
[1:04:07] if a lie is told
[1:04:11] and continue to tell the LIE over a
[1:04:14] period
[1:04:16] then that lie tells to be or to seem
[1:04:20] like that's the truth
[1:04:22] so after many years
[1:04:25] when the truth is being told the truth
[1:04:28] rather sounds to be lies because they
[1:04:31] have been made to believe a life for so
[1:04:34] long
[1:04:38] they don't know that along the line
[1:04:42] there were some injections
[1:04:44] they injected their own words their own
[1:04:47] interpretations and many other things
[1:05:00] it's your summer
[1:05:06] so bear with me
[1:05:07] Hallelujah
[1:05:12] when lies are told over period the
[1:05:16] people believe that to be truth so one
[1:05:19] electron the truth is being told them no
[1:05:22] that one the truth rather becomes a lie
[1:05:25] and that is the problem that religion
[1:05:28] for that matter Christianity has had
[1:05:31] over the years
[1:05:34] praise the Lord
[1:05:38] now Paul was believing all things
[1:05:44] that were written in the law and in the
[1:05:46] prophets
[1:05:48] that was after his convention he was
[1:05:50] believing
[1:05:51] even before his Converse he was
[1:05:54] believing that's why he was behaving
[1:05:55] that way towards the Christians but he
[1:05:57] thought they were rather destroying the
[1:05:59] truth
[1:06:01] by enjoying chapter one
[1:06:04] we know Philip met Nathaniel
[1:06:08] they probably said Philippine Nathaniel
[1:06:11] were prayer partners
[1:06:13] they pray together they had the same
[1:06:15] ambition they had the spirit the same
[1:06:18] aspiration they were looking forward to
[1:06:21] fulfillment of scriptures
[1:06:23] and so one Philip met the Lord Jesus
[1:06:27] Christ he couldn't keep it to himself
[1:06:30] we have found him who
[1:06:33] of whom the prophets have written
[1:06:38] so it means that they were looking
[1:06:39] forward
[1:06:40] they were always in anticipation of
[1:06:44] these prophecies being fulfilled
[1:06:46] and so when
[1:06:48] this
[1:06:49] one prophecy was fulfilled before his
[1:06:53] own eyes so we have found him who him
[1:06:57] the prophet had told about him the
[1:07:01] scriptures that are told about him so we
[1:07:04] have found him
[1:07:05] that was
[1:07:07] the attitude towards those who were
[1:07:10] looking forward to the Fulfillment of
[1:07:13] scriptures
[1:07:15] always looking forward to that
[1:07:18] they said we have found him
[1:07:21] of whom just waiting
[1:07:27] before the Lord Jesus Christ Christ came
[1:07:29] long before in the days of Moses
[1:07:33] God made Moses right
[1:07:37] that the Lord your God will
[1:07:41] let me just open and then we'll read
[1:07:44] Deuteronomy chapter 18. verses 18 and
[1:07:49] 19.
[1:07:54] verse 15 says the Lord by God will raise
[1:07:56] up unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[1:08:00] thee of thy bredman like unto me unto
[1:08:04] him ye shall hack him in 18 19 God said
[1:08:08] I will raise them up a prophet from
[1:08:11] among their brethrenal like unto thee
[1:08:13] Moses
[1:08:15] I'm putting the music
[1:08:16] and we'll put my words in his mouth and
[1:08:20] he shall speak unto them all that I
[1:08:23] shall command them
[1:08:25] 19 and it shall come to pass the
[1:08:28] whosoever will not hacken unto my words
[1:08:32] what he shall speak in my name I will
[1:08:36] require it of him
[1:08:38] so God promised to send a prophet like
[1:08:42] unto Moses and when this Prophet like
[1:08:45] Auntie Moses came
[1:08:48] they rejected him
[1:08:50] because they were not watching they were
[1:08:53] not looking they were not ready for him
[1:08:55] so they rejected him
[1:09:00] so they said let his blood be upon us
[1:09:03] and upon our children
[1:09:06] Hallelujah and practically the whole
[1:09:08] nation of Israel rejected the coming
[1:09:12] Messiah
[1:09:14] and God scattered them
[1:09:17] around the world
[1:09:18] now say that practically
[1:09:21] the world
[1:09:23] of our day has also rejected the promise
[1:09:26] of God for this age
[1:09:30] they have rejected the promise of God of
[1:09:33] sending us a prophet
[1:09:41] in Acts chapter 41 13 41 it says I work
[1:09:46] and work in your day
[1:09:48] work what you will not believe though a
[1:09:51] man
[1:09:55] be classes unto you but Acts chapter 13
[1:09:58] verse 41 say behold he despises
[1:10:03] and wonder
[1:10:04] and perish
[1:10:06] for I work at work in your days
[1:10:09] now what which is in no wise belief
[1:10:13] though a man declares unto you
[1:10:16] that is God speaking that he will work
[1:10:18] and work in our day and what we will not
[1:10:22] believe all the people will not believe
[1:10:24] though it will be declared unto them
[1:10:27] God is working and working all day
[1:10:30] and the people who have rejected it just
[1:10:34] like they related to the Lord Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ and just like they reject all the
[1:10:38] prophets in the bible
[1:10:42] they rejected each Prophet that God sent
[1:10:46] a rather followed
[1:10:49] the anointing oil prophet
[1:10:52] of our day
[1:10:55] in Ghana they sell Gary Gary is a Syria
[1:10:59] it's so for them to to receive their
[1:11:01] healings
[1:11:02] the the sugarcane
[1:11:05] they are making so much profit out of
[1:11:07] them all because of ignorance and all
[1:11:09] because they have rejected the true one
[1:11:13] worker work in your day a day I mean
[1:11:16] what would you not believe though a man
[1:11:18] declares unto you
[1:11:21] you know Paul was Towing the line or the
[1:11:24] path of the fathers of faith
[1:11:27] and no one that he was the first
[1:11:30] the messenger to the first 28th
[1:11:35] he told the path of the prophets or the
[1:11:39] fathers and so God also made him
[1:11:43] the messenger for the first church age
[1:11:46] at the gentle Church age
[1:11:49] God commissioned him to be the first a
[1:11:53] messenger or the messenger to the first
[1:11:55] church age now let's read something from
[1:11:59] the Ephesian Church age
[1:12:04] talking about Paul
[1:12:09] say his manner of ministering
[1:12:12] Ministry said the pattern that all
[1:12:15] future Messengers were to Aspire to the
[1:12:19] pattern of Paul's ministering sets the
[1:12:22] pattern
[1:12:23] that all future Messengers were to
[1:12:25] aspartum and actually said the pattern
[1:12:29] for every true minister of God
[1:12:33] though he will not attain to such height
[1:12:36] in a prophetic realm as did Paul
[1:12:41] first of all Paul Paul was he said no
[1:12:43] Paul's Ministry had a three-fold quality
[1:12:47] and was as follows
[1:12:50] first of all
[1:12:52] Paul was absolutely true to the way amen
[1:12:56] he never deviated from it no matter the
[1:13:00] cost
[1:13:03] Paul did not deviate from
[1:13:08] the past or the truth
[1:13:10] the Faith of Our Fathers no matter the
[1:13:13] cost
[1:13:17] if it meant him not having anything to
[1:13:20] eat so be it
[1:13:22] he's true with the faith he's through
[1:13:24] the truth
[1:13:26] this is a scripture
[1:13:29] he stood with the truth
[1:13:31] no matter how much it was going to cost
[1:13:34] him
[1:13:38] he wasn't going to lower down the bars
[1:13:45] he wasn't going to compromise
[1:13:48] amen in Galatians chapter 1 verse 8 and
[1:13:52] 9 as we may know
[1:13:54] Paul said but Bo we are an angel from
[1:13:58] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:14:01] than that what we have preached unto you
[1:14:03] let him be a curse
[1:14:06] let that someone come and say I'm an
[1:14:08] angel from heaven this and that and if
[1:14:11] he brings anything contrary to what has
[1:14:15] been proved to you what Paul has been
[1:14:17] preached has pre to you say let that
[1:14:19] angel be kept
[1:14:22] as we said before so say I now again if
[1:14:27] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[1:14:30] then that ye have received let him be
[1:14:33] okay
[1:14:36] Paul was straightforward
[1:14:38] he was trying to set the records right
[1:14:44] that don't believe or accept or receive
[1:14:49] anything
[1:14:51] contrary to what have been given you
[1:14:57] Hallelujah that's why I say he was
[1:15:00] setting a pattern for future ministers
[1:15:03] for future Christians for us all to
[1:15:06] follow
[1:15:08] so don't take from here don't take from
[1:15:10] there no let your mind be set on the
[1:15:13] word of God
[1:15:19] well I'm reading something from
[1:15:20] Galatians Chapter 2 verses 11 and then
[1:15:23] 14.
[1:15:26] between Peter and Paul
[1:15:30] is that when Peter was come to Antioch I
[1:15:33] withstood him to the faith because he
[1:15:36] wants to be blamed
[1:15:39] when I saw that they walked not
[1:15:43] uprightly according to the truth of the
[1:15:45] Gospel
[1:15:46] I said unto Peter before them all
[1:15:49] you think
[1:15:51] take Peter to the corner and then say do
[1:15:54] you think this is good Lord before them
[1:15:57] all he reprimanded Peter
[1:16:01] and who
[1:16:03] was poor
[1:16:05] to reprimand the Peter
[1:16:07] when they were walking with Jesus where
[1:16:09] was Paul
[1:16:11] Paul is kind of acknowledge to be the
[1:16:14] head of the Apostles
[1:16:16] are you I'm sorry I mean Peter sorry
[1:16:18] yeah Paul who what were you
[1:16:22] nonetheless
[1:16:23] when he saw that Peter was wrong
[1:16:27] he straightened him up
[1:16:29] he didn't care how many years he had
[1:16:32] walked with Jesus right
[1:16:35] he corrected him
[1:16:41] when I saw that he walked not apparently
[1:16:43] according to the truth of the Gospel I
[1:16:45] said unto him before them all if thou be
[1:16:48] a Jew limit after the man of Gentiles
[1:16:51] and not as do the Jews why compelling
[1:16:54] down the Gentiles to live us do the Jews
[1:16:59] so here was Paul
[1:17:02] who had laid a foundation
[1:17:05] who has said a pattern
[1:17:08] so regardless of who you were
[1:17:10] he was ready to correct it
[1:17:14] First Corinthians chapter 14 verses 36
[1:17:17] and 37 he said what
[1:17:19] came the word of God out from you all
[1:17:24] came it unto you only
[1:17:27] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:17:30] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[1:17:34] the thing that I write unto you are the
[1:17:37] Commandments of God Amen
[1:17:40] Paul is saying the thing that I'm
[1:17:42] writing to you
[1:17:44] is not coming from me but they are the
[1:17:47] Commandments of God
[1:17:50] so if you refuse or we reject them if
[1:17:52] you play God then play them you are done
[1:17:54] playing the word of God the Commandment
[1:17:56] of God Amen
[1:18:03] Hallelujah
[1:18:07] Galatians chapter 1 and verse one he
[1:18:09] said Paul an apostle not of men neither
[1:18:13] by man but by Jesus Christ and God the
[1:18:16] Father who raised him from the dead
[1:18:20] so he was not taking instructions from
[1:18:23] any Bishop
[1:18:24] ask bishop genovacia or anybody
[1:18:28] his calling was of God an apostle not of
[1:18:32] men neither by man but by Jesus Christ
[1:18:38] this was Paul
[1:18:40] he had laid a foundation Hallelujah
[1:18:46] he a little Foundation
[1:18:50] Paul said other
[1:18:52] Foundation can normally than that which
[1:18:56] is late which is Christ Jesus
[1:19:00] so he was certain of the foundation that
[1:19:03] he was
[1:19:04] placing there for all
[1:19:07] True Believers
[1:19:09] two servants of God two worshipers to
[1:19:12] follow
[1:19:13] and to build on
[1:19:16] praise the Lord
[1:19:21] see secondly his ministry was in the
[1:19:24] power of the spirit thereby
[1:19:27] demonstrating the spoken and written
[1:19:28] word
[1:19:29] his ministry was
[1:19:32] in the power of the spirit thereby
[1:19:34] demonstrating the spoken and written
[1:19:37] word
[1:19:38] so it says in First Corinthians 2 1 to 5
[1:19:42] get bear with me for all the scriptures
[1:19:46] that's what we feed on anyway
[1:19:49] and all right Brethren when I came to
[1:19:51] you who came not with Excellency of
[1:19:54] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:19:56] the testimony of God for I determined
[1:20:00] not to know anything among you save
[1:20:02] Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:20:04] and I was with you in weakness and in
[1:20:07] fear and in my trampling
[1:20:09] and my speech and my preaching was not
[1:20:12] with enticing words of man's Wisdom
[1:20:16] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:20:19] Power
[1:20:20] so Paul will not come and stand
[1:20:23] and then preach something just to to
[1:20:28] please you
[1:20:31] he didn't come with enticing words of
[1:20:34] men's wisdom
[1:20:36] but he will come with the with the word
[1:20:38] of God no matter how hard it is
[1:20:42] he will not burn it
[1:20:45] he will not twist it
[1:20:48] because
[1:20:49] he believed the faith of the father
[1:20:55] he was believing and serving the lord
[1:20:59] the way his fathers
[1:21:03] not biological fact I believe you
[1:21:05] understand the apostolified the way they
[1:21:08] serve God that was the way Paul was
[1:21:10] determined to save the Lord
[1:21:25] II Corinthians 11 and verse two he said
[1:21:29] for I am jealous over you with Godly
[1:21:32] jealousy
[1:21:33] for I have exposed you to one husband
[1:21:37] that I may present you as a chaste
[1:21:40] virgin to Christ
[1:21:45] that I may present you as a treat virgin
[1:21:48] to Christ
[1:21:50] that was all that Paul was
[1:21:54] working for
[1:21:56] to present a people to God
[1:21:59] a bride to God
[1:22:02] a brother is chased
[1:22:07] and the bread can be chased
[1:22:09] I mean Chase only when she is like the
[1:22:14] groom
[1:22:17] because of the Bride
[1:22:20] like a woman
[1:22:22] is supposed to be born of
[1:22:25] the husband's born and flesh of the
[1:22:28] husband's flesh
[1:22:30] as it happened Ina and Adam said this is
[1:22:33] born of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh so
[1:22:37] if Paul is preparing the people
[1:22:41] as straight virgin for Christ then the
[1:22:45] Virgin or the the bride must be like
[1:22:48] Christ and who is Christ he is the
[1:22:51] weight
[1:22:52] then the bride must be the way
[1:22:57] otherwise you don't qualify to be a
[1:22:59] bride of Christ
[1:23:01] you might be like him
[1:23:03] to say I I I am
[1:23:07] I am jealous with over you with Godly
[1:23:09] jealousy I've expound you to one husband
[1:23:11] then I may present you as a change
[1:23:14] virgin
[1:23:15] to Christ
[1:23:22] the prophet
[1:23:23] had a vision or dream where he saw it's
[1:23:28] about it's about the preview of the
[1:23:30] Bride
[1:23:33] he saw three sins
[1:23:36] and the first one he saw a nice
[1:23:38] beautiful
[1:23:41] woman
[1:23:43] very beautiful
[1:23:45] in all things
[1:23:52] it was matching
[1:23:55] say what a beauty what a woman what a
[1:23:57] bride
[1:23:59] he was so happy to see such a woman such
[1:24:02] a bride
[1:24:05] and then
[1:24:07] that sin went off
[1:24:09] and then the second thing that came was
[1:24:12] a woman
[1:24:14] that a woman was vulgar
[1:24:17] very filthy
[1:24:20] nothing good could be said about her
[1:24:25] that was another bright in the scene a
[1:24:28] second scene
[1:24:29] and of course he wept so
[1:24:33] after all the preaching after all the
[1:24:37] fasting after all the struggles is that
[1:24:40] a kind of bride I'm going to present to
[1:24:42] my Lord
[1:24:44] he was so sad and broken down
[1:24:48] no
[1:24:49] after all the work
[1:24:53] is that a bride that I'm going to
[1:24:54] present to God but to the Lord
[1:25:00] then that sin also left
[1:25:03] and the first thing that came
[1:25:06] was like the first scene
[1:25:09] a beautiful bride a wet bride
[1:25:14] a bride that was to be presented unto
[1:25:17] the Lord
[1:25:21] so what happened along the line
[1:25:24] that he had a filthy vulgar woman or
[1:25:28] bride
[1:25:29] Church in that respect
[1:25:31] because the woman represents the church
[1:25:35] you know Paul presented a word
[1:25:39] to the people he's told by the word
[1:25:46] he gave him the word the unadulterated
[1:25:49] word
[1:25:51] and the people who lived by it they
[1:25:54] accepted they embrace it so they live by
[1:25:57] it so that is how come the bride that's
[1:26:00] the Lord the prophet saw the first one
[1:26:03] was so beautiful
[1:26:05] was so upright
[1:26:08] was so there was nothing wrong around
[1:26:12] here
[1:26:14] but I know what happened the second
[1:26:16] bride or the reason for the second by
[1:26:19] the condition the second brother was
[1:26:21] that now from Paul's time
[1:26:24] along the line as I said earlier
[1:26:27] the word of God was adulterated right
[1:26:34] they don't play the will of God
[1:26:38] they compromise on the word of God
[1:26:44] along the line even uh they were selling
[1:26:47] the word of God
[1:26:50] if you read even history
[1:26:54] when we're in the in the primary schools
[1:26:57] we read a book makers of civilization
[1:27:00] they had some of these things in it
[1:27:02] where people were made to pay
[1:27:05] Monies
[1:27:07] for forgiveness of their sins
[1:27:10] the sale of indulgence I don't know
[1:27:12] whether you have heard that before yes
[1:27:16] so if
[1:27:18] you will send this week maybe you pay
[1:27:20] some ten dollars and it covers yourself
[1:27:23] for this week
[1:27:26] you can pay maybe 50 or 100 to cover
[1:27:29] your son for the rest of the for the
[1:27:31] year
[1:27:32] you pay maybe a thousand or maybe 50 000
[1:27:36] whatever it will cover your sins for the
[1:27:38] rest of your life
[1:27:41] this science history books
[1:27:44] Hallelujah and so so many things went
[1:27:49] out astray so many they changed so many
[1:27:52] things we know about the the nursing
[1:27:54] Council where they change so many things
[1:27:56] and so now the word of God was no longer
[1:27:59] pure
[1:28:00] it was no longer
[1:28:03] in this right state
[1:28:05] and that is how can they produce
[1:28:09] that vulgar woman
[1:28:12] call that bride but then in these last
[1:28:16] days
[1:28:17] hallelujah what go what Paul preached is
[1:28:21] being preached back to us
[1:28:24] me
[1:28:25] Hallelujah
[1:28:28] and so if one ball preach produced that
[1:28:31] virtuous bride the word is being put to
[1:28:35] us which is a repetition of what
[1:28:37] published will have to produce a similar
[1:28:40] thing
[1:28:46] Hallelujah
[1:28:48] so when the prophet used to say I I
[1:28:51] preach what Paul free
[1:28:54] it means that I believe what Paul
[1:28:56] believed and I stand by what Paul stood
[1:28:59] by
[1:29:01] and if we will follow that
[1:29:03] then definitely we're going to have that
[1:29:06] bride
[1:29:07] like the first bride
[1:29:11] I believe that's what we are we are all
[1:29:13] aspiring to be to be part of the bride
[1:29:16] of Christ
[1:29:17] not just to be part of a church
[1:29:20] or a group
[1:29:21] but to be part of the mystical body of
[1:29:24] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:26] and that is possible only and only when
[1:29:30] we will believe
[1:29:34] and hold to the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:29:39] if we swerve or strain from that there's
[1:29:43] no way we can
[1:29:45] be that
[1:29:47] Hallelujah
[1:29:49] there's no way we can be that if we
[1:29:51] stray
[1:29:52] so Paul I mean Prophet said I preach
[1:29:55] what Paul preached
[1:29:56] means I believe and I stand by what Paul
[1:29:59] stood for
[1:30:02] God is not accepting just any faith
[1:30:04] otherwise he could have accepted Paul's
[1:30:06] faith when he was a
[1:30:09] Pharisee because they were strict
[1:30:12] concerned the law
[1:30:14] but that wasn't thing that wasn't it
[1:30:17] certain Faith they are all sincere
[1:30:20] but the prophet said you can be sincere
[1:30:23] and what sincerely wrong
[1:30:26] you can be very sincere fine by can be
[1:30:29] sincerely wrong because if it's not
[1:30:31] according to the weather but if it's not
[1:30:33] according to the precept of God
[1:30:35] no matter how your sincere necessary
[1:30:37] doesn't count
[1:30:39] you'll be sincerely wrong
[1:30:44] because in the days of June
[1:30:47] there were other denominations
[1:30:50] they were not as many as today
[1:30:53] but at least we had the Pharisees
[1:30:55] we had the Sadducees we had the
[1:30:58] heronians they were all denominations
[1:31:01] but
[1:31:03] none of their preachings none of the
[1:31:05] adopteries none of their beliefs could
[1:31:08] have prepared a people for the coming of
[1:31:11] the Lord
[1:31:13] that is why he sent John
[1:31:16] to prepare a people to make a way to
[1:31:19] prepare people for him for his coming
[1:31:22] because those that were preached they
[1:31:24] were preaching around could not prepare
[1:31:26] people
[1:31:30] in the same way God
[1:31:32] in the midst of all that nominations all
[1:31:34] the beliefs
[1:31:37] has sent Prophet amen
[1:31:39] what is pure word
[1:31:42] to prepare a people for his coming
[1:31:46] actually said in Malachi 4.
[1:31:49] we'll get to that
[1:31:51] Hallelujah
[1:31:57] Jesus was the Fulfillment of the law and
[1:31:59] the prophets but they didn't see him
[1:32:01] that way
[1:32:03] you see one thing that made Paul and
[1:32:05] heretic is that he believed all the
[1:32:08] things that
[1:32:10] please those
[1:32:14] in here
[1:32:15] one thing that made Paul a heretic
[1:32:20] is that he believed all that were
[1:32:24] written in the law and in the prophets
[1:32:28] he believed them all
[1:32:36] and so that made him special that made
[1:32:38] him I mean oh let me put it that way he
[1:32:41] it made Paul all because the rest were
[1:32:44] not believing the prophet
[1:32:48] Jesus reprimanded them he said which of
[1:32:51] the prophets was not killed by your your
[1:32:54] fathers
[1:32:56] they didn't believe the prophet that God
[1:32:59] sent to them
[1:33:00] you know Jesus said that because the
[1:33:02] people were saying oh if we were in the
[1:33:04] days of our fathers we wouldn't have
[1:33:06] killed the prophet say no that is not
[1:33:08] true
[1:33:11] all of them were killed by your prophets
[1:33:13] and you are just a continuation reason
[1:33:15] of what your father did because you are
[1:33:17] garnishing the supporters of your
[1:33:19] fathers
[1:33:26] so so Jesus reprimanded them
[1:33:29] but Paul worshiped the god of your of
[1:33:33] his fathers the way that was so contrary
[1:33:37] to the way the others were worshiping
[1:33:41] and I thank God we are watching God
[1:33:44] the weather is contrary to what the
[1:33:47] others think
[1:33:54] you could tell you oh Peter was the
[1:33:57] first pope they cannot they have no
[1:33:58] proof
[1:34:01] they can tell you so many things without
[1:34:03] proof
[1:34:07] they are failing to see come back to the
[1:34:10] word that's what the prophet was saying
[1:34:12] back to the word he didn't come to
[1:34:15] project himself if anyone tells you the
[1:34:18] prophet came to pray it is wrong it is a
[1:34:21] lie
[1:34:22] all he says back to the word
[1:34:26] back to the original
[1:34:29] that's all my Prophet came to tell me
[1:34:32] that's all your Prophet is telling you
[1:34:34] back to the word
[1:34:37] Heaven and Earth will pass away by this
[1:34:39] word
[1:34:46] we are just to live by this
[1:34:48] and nothing else
[1:34:53] I saw one time
[1:34:56] all the people left the disciple the
[1:34:59] apostles or the followers of Jesus left
[1:35:03] when he gave them a hard preaching
[1:35:08] say I tell you truly verily verily
[1:35:11] except you eat of this My Flesh and
[1:35:14] drink of my blood you can never make it
[1:35:16] there's no life
[1:35:19] as for this one
[1:35:22] we are not witches we are not vampires
[1:35:25] you were asked not to suck up your blood
[1:35:27] before we can have life
[1:35:29] is it it's it's a hard saying so they
[1:35:32] started Living one after the other they
[1:35:36] left
[1:35:37] and to the weather to the 12th
[1:35:42] he says 10 so they said will he also go
[1:35:47] and Peter said to whom
[1:35:50] shall we go
[1:35:52] Lord to whom shall we go
[1:35:55] you alone have the words of eternal life
[1:36:00] these words that you've spoken
[1:36:03] you spoke to us and Them All We don't
[1:36:06] understand it but we know that it's life
[1:36:10] we are not being called to understand we
[1:36:12] are called to believe
[1:36:15] we have nowhere to us to go
[1:36:17] whether they believe it or not whether
[1:36:19] they understand it or not whether they
[1:36:21] agree with us or not we have nowhere to
[1:36:23] go these are the words of eternal life
[1:36:26] that have been spoken to us
[1:36:28] [Applause]
[1:36:30] we have nowhere to go
[1:36:34] Hallelujah
[1:36:35] [Music]
[1:36:41] in the church age book Prophet said the
[1:36:45] word always came by a prophet and always
[1:36:49] will
[1:36:50] I hope you don't mind me quoting a
[1:36:52] prophet I hope you don't mind me quoting
[1:36:55] the prophet can I go ahead
[1:36:59] the word always came by a prophet and
[1:37:02] always will
[1:37:05] that this is the law of God is evidenced
[1:37:07] by even a casual search of scripture
[1:37:10] the unchanging God with unchanging ways
[1:37:14] invariably sent his prophet in every age
[1:37:18] where the people has strayed from divine
[1:37:21] order
[1:37:23] so prophets come God sends Prophet I
[1:37:26] don't mean these quack ones but
[1:37:29] word-based major prophet when the people
[1:37:33] have strayed deviated from divine order
[1:37:37] so the prophets
[1:37:40] commission or Ministry it will come
[1:37:43] bring the people back
[1:37:48] Hallelujah
[1:37:49] you know what I was talking about the
[1:37:51] the the preview of the Bride
[1:37:54] when the third bride came that was so
[1:37:57] beautiful and was much in the procession
[1:38:00] the prophet said he saw some people
[1:38:03] trying to get out of the procession
[1:38:06] Out Of Tune so he says scream
[1:38:09] be light stay in line
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] today we need that scream so much
[1:38:18] we need ice cream
[1:38:20] we should stay in line
[1:38:25] when the time is so short
[1:38:28] the hour is late
[1:38:30] anytime from now the Lord May Come
[1:38:35] we need to stay in line
[1:38:45] the people held
[1:38:48] the people who are straight from divine
[1:38:50] order that is a a prophet comes in every
[1:38:53] age where the people has trained from
[1:38:54] divine order
[1:38:56] with both the theologians and the people
[1:38:59] having departed from the word
[1:39:01] God always sends his Prophet or his
[1:39:04] servant to these people
[1:39:07] I've just submitted something in order
[1:39:09] to correct false teachings and lead the
[1:39:13] people back to God
[1:39:15] amen so if God has sent a prophet in our
[1:39:19] day all that is coming to do is to bring
[1:39:24] us back to God
[1:39:26] bring us from four teachings four
[1:39:28] doctrines and all that
[1:39:30] back to God
[1:39:34] Hallelujah
[1:39:36] preaching or presenting to us the faith
[1:39:40] of our fathers
[1:39:42] what Paul preached is what he is
[1:39:45] preaching in order to produce a bright
[1:39:48] light the one that was produced in the
[1:39:50] days of Paul
[1:39:56] amen you see that is okay
[1:40:01] so we see a seven
[1:40:03] eight messenger coming and he is a
[1:40:06] prophet
[1:40:08] so what are the what does he come to do
[1:40:11] say no this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:40:14] Revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:40:16] things
[1:40:17] one according to Malacca for he will
[1:40:20] turn the heart of the children to the
[1:40:23] fathers
[1:40:24] to the faith of the fathers
[1:40:27] Hallelujah so marker 4
[1:40:31] a messenger or Prophet will turn our
[1:40:34] heart to the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:40:38] and the two is just like the first one
[1:40:41] we believe 10 7 then he will reveal the
[1:40:45] missiles contain the attendance which
[1:40:47] are
[1:40:50] the uh you reveal the Mysteries and the
[1:40:55] things that are contained in the seals
[1:40:58] which are containing suits he said these
[1:41:01] are the one that literally
[1:41:04] depends our heart to the father
[1:41:08] what do we need again
[1:41:13] if this is to 10 what to ten or what is
[1:41:16] it to turn our hearts back to the Faith
[1:41:19] of Our Fathers and we have had it what
[1:41:22] are we waiting for again
[1:41:30] you know they drifted from the face
[1:41:32] because they didn't believe the prophets
[1:41:35] of God
[1:41:38] and All Through the Ages
[1:41:40] you know the bride of Christ the Gentile
[1:41:42] bride
[1:41:43] so it doesn't concern the Jews All
[1:41:47] Through the Ages the sermon Church ages
[1:41:49] called
[1:41:51] sins
[1:41:52] prophet and they are the seven stars
[1:41:55] that were in his sense in the Book of
[1:41:57] Revelations
[1:41:58] Hallelujah
[1:42:00] he released them as and when it was due
[1:42:05] and then they all come with a word of
[1:42:07] God
[1:42:10] praise the Lord
[1:42:13] to bring the word of God to us
[1:42:17] that this is the way as the scripture
[1:42:20] says
[1:42:21] this is the way walk ye therein
[1:42:27] this is the way walking they win
[1:42:31] but the people will say we will not walk
[1:42:34] in it
[1:42:37] that's what they said
[1:42:53] just bear with me
[1:42:56] very much
[1:43:06] Jeremiah chapter 6 verse 16 and 17. that
[1:43:10] say the Lord stand ye in the ways and
[1:43:15] see
[1:43:15] and ask for the old part
[1:43:18] the old part
[1:43:20] what is a good way
[1:43:22] and walk there in and he shall find rest
[1:43:25] for your soul
[1:43:27] but they said we will not walk there in
[1:43:30] get blunt
[1:43:33] gold is saying look for the all of the
[1:43:36] new the old path Walk The Wind that you
[1:43:39] have rest for yourself no no no we're
[1:43:41] not walking it
[1:43:46] and then in Isaiah chapter 30
[1:43:51] because the world always want to hear
[1:43:53] smooth things
[1:43:56] exactly 30 verse 9
[1:43:59] to 11 say that necessary rebellious
[1:44:03] people lying children children that will
[1:44:07] not hear the law of the Lord
[1:44:09] or say to the Cs
[1:44:11] see not enter a prophet prophesy not
[1:44:15] unto us right things
[1:44:17] don't prophesy writings so you see all
[1:44:20] the prophets around
[1:44:22] false prophet that's what the people
[1:44:23] want to hear that's what they want
[1:44:26] prophesy on to
[1:44:28] prophesy not unto us right things
[1:44:32] pick unto us smooth things
[1:44:37] prophesy deceit
[1:44:39] I'm reading from Isaiah chapter 30 verse
[1:44:42] 9 to 11.
[1:44:44] Professor deceit
[1:44:47] get you out of the way
[1:44:50] turn aside out of the path call the Holy
[1:44:53] One of Israel to cease from before us so
[1:44:57] they want the the good Prophet to stand
[1:44:59] before them and prophesy
[1:45:01] good things them they want the seed they
[1:45:05] want to be prophesied to smooth things
[1:45:08] oh like maybe you are in Africa oh this
[1:45:12] year is your year
[1:45:13] you will get Visa to your U.S you get
[1:45:17] yourself to Germany that's what they
[1:45:18] want to hear oh your business will
[1:45:21] prosper that is what they want to hear
[1:45:23] prophesy they see to us don't tell her
[1:45:26] that they're good things we want Small
[1:45:28] Things think that that we want to hear
[1:45:31] and so they failed to hear from the
[1:45:35] prophets of God
[1:45:38] let someone stand here or may start the
[1:45:42] church with all these kind of smooth
[1:45:44] things
[1:45:46] people will flocking
[1:45:49] but don't worry that we are small in
[1:45:51] numbers
[1:45:52] God says fear not little flock
[1:45:56] it is our father's good pleasure to do
[1:45:58] what
[1:45:59] Hallelujah
[1:46:01] so he is with us God does not dealing
[1:46:04] numbers we are not saying that if we we
[1:46:07] have a good number is wrong no but God
[1:46:10] does not look to the numbers the word
[1:46:12] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:46:15] there I am in the midst of them
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:21] want to go the Faith of Our Fathers or
[1:46:24] believe the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:46:29] we are praying that the Lord will help
[1:46:31] us not to drift especially in times like
[1:46:34] this and especially in your side of the
[1:46:37] world
[1:46:38] there is so much pollution there's so
[1:46:41] much filth
[1:46:43] there's so much deception
[1:46:48] that God is able to keep his own
[1:46:50] so the elect will not be deceived
[1:46:54] if it were possible
[1:46:56] but it's not possible so he his eyes are
[1:47:00] over his shoulder he is keeping us
[1:47:04] well then the prophet said soon they
[1:47:06] will come after us
[1:47:08] so you cannot meet like we have met
[1:47:12] they will close the doors no bad
[1:47:14] barricade or buy them
[1:47:16] I will not be able to meet
[1:47:18] so it is good that the word of God
[1:47:22] dwells in your ritually
[1:47:25] so if the word of God if he knew you
[1:47:27] will be able to face any challenge
[1:47:30] you don't have to come here for a
[1:47:32] preacher to preach to you before you are
[1:47:34] inspired no let the world of God dwell
[1:47:37] in you richly because there's coming a
[1:47:40] Time who will be persecuted
[1:47:42] and not I I I think a bit worse
[1:47:46] will be persecuted as individuals
[1:47:51] the time is coming
[1:47:54] that's right
[1:47:57] enemies
[1:48:00] after rest
[1:48:03] today who is it the world is now so
[1:48:07] I I you can't you can't understand you
[1:48:10] can't imagine them
[1:48:13] if
[1:48:14] whilst we are here
[1:48:17] and the Holy Spirit song on Earth
[1:48:20] and they are doing all these things
[1:48:23] just imagine
[1:48:24] the prophet said when we leave God takes
[1:48:27] us from here he takes his holy spirit
[1:48:30] and if we are gone
[1:48:33] by God's grace the Rapture and the Holy
[1:48:36] Spirit has been taken away
[1:48:38] just
[1:48:39] imagine how the world will be like
[1:48:44] if today they can have same-sex marriage
[1:48:47] they can have
[1:48:49] animals can
[1:48:51] lie with human beings if a brother can
[1:48:55] warning his sister mother can marry his
[1:48:59] son and all those foolish things
[1:49:02] if they are happening even now
[1:49:05] imagine what will happen
[1:49:08] when we are going when the Holy Spirit
[1:49:11] is no longer there now the idea trying
[1:49:14] to come out with
[1:49:15] all kinds of decrees and laws so even if
[1:49:19] one is going to check and it feels like
[1:49:21] having sex oh yes at the corner there
[1:49:24] just go ahead this is what is happening
[1:49:26] now
[1:49:27] many laws and things are coming out and
[1:49:30] they want to enforce these things
[1:49:34] they want to catch our little ones Young
[1:49:38] but God will keep them
[1:49:41] Moses said
[1:49:43] we will not leave our little ones behind
[1:49:46] not leaving the who's of our animals we
[1:49:49] are going with them we are claiming them
[1:49:51] all for the kingdom of God
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:57] will not leave any one of them
[1:50:05] one of these things were happening Paul
[1:50:07] said but I am not ashamed of the Gospel
[1:50:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ wow
[1:50:15] so Brandon let us not also be ashamed
[1:50:19] any people can dress you know in in
[1:50:22] Africa I don't know what what they say
[1:50:25] but if you saw someone with a dress torn
[1:50:30] here and there
[1:50:32] it means there's something wrong here
[1:50:36] I mean there's something wrong here it's
[1:50:39] a past the person is a crazy man
[1:50:43] in Ghana if not the whole Africa or even
[1:50:45] at least I'm talking of
[1:50:47] um what I know
[1:50:48] if someone wears dresses that are torn
[1:50:51] here and there hmm oh immediately
[1:50:55] sometimes maybe they will just arrest
[1:50:57] you take you to the psychiatric home
[1:51:00] but today the devil said that is the
[1:51:02] fashion when more than modern world
[1:51:06] you see we cannot modernize Christ we
[1:51:09] cannotize Christianity we cannot change
[1:51:11] it
[1:51:17] that's why we have to hold on to the
[1:51:18] Faith of Our Father
[1:51:22] and I want to say this
[1:51:25] even in
[1:51:27] the mess we have lowered the bars
[1:51:30] seven days have crept into the message
[1:51:33] what should not be so
[1:51:38] when we came to believe a message
[1:51:43] how it was and how it is today
[1:51:47] we have added
[1:51:49] we have let loose so many things
[1:51:56] I don't want to take much of your time
[1:51:59] you see
[1:52:02] I preached last week elsewhere it was
[1:52:06] this Memorial
[1:52:09] day or whatever
[1:52:11] and then the pastor I was asking what's
[1:52:15] the whole thing is about and it was
[1:52:16] telling me the Memorial Day is the day
[1:52:20] or holiday where they set aside to
[1:52:22] honor
[1:52:24] the gallon soldiers
[1:52:28] um who fought who led younger lies for
[1:52:31] America to be
[1:52:33] what it is now
[1:52:37] so that is a celebration a yearly
[1:52:39] celebration for those people
[1:52:42] and then a pot came to my mind
[1:52:45] I was looking at Hebrews chapter 11.
[1:52:50] Faith of Our Fathers
[1:52:53] this truth
[1:52:57] for the faith
[1:52:59] if people had to lay down their lives
[1:53:01] for America to be what it is now for
[1:53:03] people to enjoy
[1:53:05] now I was looking at the faith of our
[1:53:08] our forefathers fathers in the faith
[1:53:12] in Hebrews chapter 11 how that some were
[1:53:15] Sun asunder
[1:53:17] somewhere burn to the stick some were
[1:53:21] buried alive somewhere fell to the Lions
[1:53:24] but before they did that they will give
[1:53:26] you a last chance
[1:53:27] whether you denounce your faith or not
[1:53:30] if you denounce yourself free if you
[1:53:33] stood by your faith then
[1:53:36] you went through the agony or that
[1:53:38] ordeal
[1:53:40] they are worth to be celebrated
[1:53:49] these people we need to honor them
[1:53:53] and how do we honor them by living or
[1:53:56] believing what they believe
[1:54:00] hold to the faith
[1:54:03] we wouldn't be having it today
[1:54:07] we will not be having it today brethren
[1:54:13] and in Hebrew chapter 12 says that we
[1:54:15] are Compass about with so great a crowd
[1:54:19] of witnesses
[1:54:22] those who have gone before us
[1:54:24] believers they are all watching us
[1:54:30] are the last but
[1:54:34] who have been handed
[1:54:36] with a baton
[1:54:39] they have run the race
[1:54:44] semi-release
[1:54:47] the first
[1:54:49] age they run the second took the Baton
[1:54:52] the third the fourth fifth sixth and now
[1:54:54] the button has been handed to you and I
[1:54:57] how are we running it
[1:55:01] we're running according to
[1:55:05] the firms and conferences of our day we
[1:55:08] cannot make it
[1:55:10] they run good Races they fought good
[1:55:13] fights
[1:55:15] and they are all looking up to us how
[1:55:18] are we ending it remember the scripture
[1:55:20] says they without us are not made
[1:55:23] perfect
[1:55:24] we are the funnel
[1:55:29] let us go back to the Faith of Our
[1:55:31] Fathers
[1:55:32] whole person to it
[1:55:40] we have not yet fought unto blood as the
[1:55:43] Bible says
[1:55:44] but some thought to blood
[1:55:48] you have to lose their lives they're
[1:55:50] because they believed the faith of their
[1:55:52] fathers just because they believe what
[1:55:54] God told them
[1:56:02] Acts chapter 20 you know before Paul
[1:56:06] left
[1:56:08] he said I have no son to declare unto
[1:56:11] you
[1:56:12] all the counsel of God
[1:56:20] verse 27
[1:56:25] and 28.
[1:56:27] 20 27 to 20 29 for I have not done to
[1:56:31] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[1:56:34] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:56:37] to all the flock over the which the Holy
[1:56:39] Ghost had made you overseas
[1:56:42] to feed the Church of God
[1:56:45] what he has purchased with his own blood
[1:56:48] so he is he was
[1:56:50] cautioning the pastors or the minister
[1:56:54] the Shepherds and they see themselves
[1:56:57] for I know that that after my departing
[1:57:00] shall Grievous wolves enter in among you
[1:57:04] not sparing the flock Grievous rules
[1:57:08] will enter in and they will not spare
[1:57:10] the flock
[1:57:12] but Paul said I have no chance to
[1:57:14] declare to you all that you need to know
[1:57:16] all that will make you ready for his
[1:57:18] coming I have told you
[1:57:20] our Prophet has told us all that we need
[1:57:23] he has feathers with all that we need to
[1:57:27] know to make us ready for the rapture
[1:57:33] Hallelujah
[1:57:36] and so we should take Heat
[1:57:38] said Grievous wounds will enter in who
[1:57:41] will not spare us
[1:57:50] Braden we need to
[1:57:53] be cautious
[1:57:56] of the time that we are living in
[1:58:01] just to make sure that we are keeping
[1:58:04] Pace with the word of God what shall be
[1:58:07] revealed to us now a day
[1:58:12] Jesus himself
[1:58:14] was considered a heretic
[1:58:17] and that is why
[1:58:20] he was crucified
[1:58:22] because the teaching that he was
[1:58:24] bringing looked to be a variance with
[1:58:27] the law of Moses
[1:58:30] a lot of Moses will say
[1:58:32] an eye for an eye a two for a tooth but
[1:58:36] he comes to say hey if somebody blocks
[1:58:39] one eye
[1:58:42] if he slaps one chin giving the other
[1:58:44] one
[1:58:45] if he does this
[1:58:50] man he's a law breaker
[1:58:53] you are he's not teaching the law of
[1:58:56] Moses but Jesus said I didn't come to
[1:58:59] destroy the law but I came to fulfill it
[1:59:02] but they were saying the Fulfillment to
[1:59:04] be a destruction
[1:59:06] that is why he became a heretic because
[1:59:08] what he was teaching look like different
[1:59:10] contrary to what they what existed for
[1:59:13] them
[1:59:16] and when a prophet came he hasn't said
[1:59:19] anything contrary to the word his only
[1:59:22] redirecting us back to the word
[1:59:25] by the way he presented like it is in
[1:59:28] the Bible they don't see that way
[1:59:30] because a liar has been told them over
[1:59:33] the years
[1:59:34] amen and they believe their life to be
[1:59:36] true and they believe the truth be lie
[1:59:44] Hallelujah
[1:59:48] we are looking forward to the coming of
[1:59:50] the Lord
[1:59:53] and the people who held onto the word of
[1:59:56] God
[1:59:57] but they look for a better Resurrection
[2:00:01] and we are also looking forward to a
[2:00:04] better Resurrection
[2:00:05] let us hold
[2:00:08] fast the confession of our face
[2:00:12] let that hold fast onto the word of God
[2:00:15] let us leave the word of God let's allow
[2:00:19] the word of God to to have preeminence
[2:00:22] in our lives
[2:00:24] let God have control in US
[2:00:28] Hallelujah
[2:00:33] I said many things have sneaked in into
[2:00:35] the message now
[2:00:38] but we should be careful
[2:00:40] we should be careful let's maintain you
[2:00:43] know that
[2:00:44] Proverbs chapter 28 or so and 20 verse
[2:00:48] 22 said we should not remove
[2:00:51] the landmarks
[2:00:53] the ancient landmarks that was said
[2:00:56] before I will tell yourself
[2:00:58] to get it that's the last question I'm
[2:01:00] quoting
[2:01:01] say remove not the ancient landmarks
[2:01:03] Proverbs chapter 28.
[2:01:35] all right
[2:01:36] I've changed
[2:01:38] I love you right it's rather Proverbs 22
[2:01:41] and 28 not 28 and 22. I'm sorry
[2:01:44] Proverbs 22 and 20. removing all the
[2:01:47] ancient Landmark which thy fathers have
[2:01:50] said
[2:01:52] don't remove the ancient Landmark the
[2:01:55] boiler uh lines that have been created
[2:02:01] as a Christian as a Believer know your
[2:02:04] limit how far you can go
[2:02:06] the limits are there the boundaries are
[2:02:09] set for us
[2:02:10] within which we are to operate we don't
[2:02:14] have to go overboard we don't have to go
[2:02:15] beyond these boundaries
[2:02:17] but today Christianity said that
[2:02:19] Anything Goes
[2:02:22] you can address anyhow
[2:02:25] you can live anyhow
[2:02:27] as long as you go to church
[2:02:29] as long as you're a chorister even as
[2:02:31] long as you preach
[2:02:35] but those
[2:02:38] [Music]
[2:02:39] talking about the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:02:42] why they believe what they held onto
[2:02:45] we must not deviate from them
[2:02:49] keep yourself within the confines
[2:02:55] not to the Christians
[2:02:57] sometimes somebody dresses and Andrew he
[2:03:00] tells you she's a Christian
[2:03:03] I don't know oh
[2:03:07] we worship God from our hearts
[2:03:10] what is in your heart I want to see what
[2:03:12] is your heart
[2:03:14] when you go to the boutique
[2:03:16] different style different things are
[2:03:18] there
[2:03:19] who decides for you it is your heart
[2:03:21] that desires decide and then takes
[2:03:23] something

[2:09:58] we have heard this several times
[2:10:02] but Lord your name is fit at this time
[2:10:05] even to
[2:10:07] rehearse these things into our years
[2:10:11] as a reminder as a question
[2:10:15] especially in the time that we are
[2:10:18] living
[2:10:19] how the law now there is no regard for
[2:10:23] your word
[2:10:25] everything under the sun has a right
[2:10:29] animals of right children have right
[2:10:32] women have right men have right oh God
[2:10:35] everything has a right but you the
[2:10:38] Creator you have been oh god father
[2:10:43] every right of yours have been taken
[2:10:45] away from you
[2:10:47] the Lord Jesus
[2:10:55] you are reminding us today
[2:10:58] to come back unto you
[2:11:01] not to stray
[2:11:03] the part of the world
[2:11:06] not to go out of the confines of what is
[2:11:10] expected of us as children of God Saints
[2:11:13] of the Living God
[2:11:16] father help us
[2:11:19] yeah there are challenges
[2:11:22] but how can we have smoothness when
[2:11:25] there are no challenges
[2:11:27] when oh God you test every child that
[2:11:29] comes to you
[2:11:32] Lord Jesus
[2:11:35] give us years I can hear your word
[2:11:38] because today there are many voices all
[2:11:41] over
[2:11:42] calling for attention
[2:11:44] I don't want to remain in you
[2:11:47] want to pledge allegiance to you this
[2:11:49] day Lord with all our heart with all our
[2:11:53] strength with all that is in us the Lord
[2:11:56] Jesus over serve you to the end
[2:11:59] bless us Lord
[2:12:02] forgive our trespasses
[2:12:05] forgive our waywardness
[2:12:08] forgive our immaturity
[2:12:11] in all that we have done wrong
[2:12:15] lead us in a path of righteousness
[2:12:19] the hands forth oh God
[2:12:22] will live to express you
[2:12:26] the way that they call heresy
[2:12:29] may we worship you the god of our
[2:12:31] fathers
[2:12:35] May every heart over here be turned onto
[2:12:39] the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:12:42] we thank you dear Lord we bless your
[2:12:45] name for your word
[2:12:49] with Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior
[2:12:51] amen
[2:12:54] thank you
[2:13:05] [Music]
[2:13:29] God will bless you
[2:13:33] God bless you brother Taylor
[2:13:36] for coming our way this morning
[2:13:40] it was so rich
[2:13:43] what a wonderful way to
[2:13:47] touch the lives
[2:13:49] of his people
[2:13:53] praise the Lord
[2:13:57] the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:14:00] and as he was preaching the Bible says
[2:14:04] the word of God will not go out and
[2:14:05] return unto him void
[2:14:08] if you came prepared if you came prayed
[2:14:11] up God has spoken
[2:14:14] because all scripture is profitable for
[2:14:16] Doctrine for reproof for correction
[2:14:18] instruction and all righteousness
[2:14:22] God has spoken what do you do with the
[2:14:25] word of God he says something
[2:14:30] for the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:14:34] some people had to die even even though
[2:14:38] they had the option
[2:14:40] to live they chose death
[2:14:44] and as he was preaching he said
[2:14:46] that the Baton has been handed over to
[2:14:49] you and me
[2:14:50] just imagine
[2:14:53] you are holding a baton that is stained
[2:14:57] with blood
[2:14:59] the blood of those that have gone ahead
[2:15:01] of us
[2:15:03] they stood and they refused to live
[2:15:07] they chose the path of death
[2:15:09] For the Love of Christ
[2:15:11] they gave their all Not Looking Back
[2:15:14] and as you hold this button and you are
[2:15:18] running down life's ordained path there
[2:15:22] are a lot of obstructions
[2:15:24] a lot of attractions a lot of billboards
[2:15:28] on the side that the devil has planted
[2:15:30] just to catch your attention
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:33] and there is no stopping place
[2:15:36] do not ever stop
[2:15:39] just keep running
[2:15:42] if you run till you are tied and you
[2:15:44] have to crawl keep crawling
[2:15:46] if you have to roll keep rolling but
[2:15:49] never you stop for a moment
[2:15:53] because that can turn the story around
[2:15:57] you are holding up a tone staying with
[2:15:59] blood
[2:16:01] stain with blood
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:05] I don't know how God spoke to you this
[2:16:07] morning
[2:16:08] but I can tell how God spoke to me
[2:16:11] praise be to God God bless you brother
[2:16:14] Taylor
[2:16:15] and God bless you Saints it was
[2:16:18] wonderful coming together once again
[2:16:21] to hear the word of God
[2:16:24] praise be to God
[2:16:26] when the service ends that is not when
[2:16:29] the spirit of God stops ministering
[2:16:32] we have come to receive instructions
[2:16:35] we have come to receive Corrections
[2:16:37] we have come to receive reproof reviews
[2:16:41] we have come we have heard the word when
[2:16:44] you go find time to set and meditate
[2:16:47] upon distance so the enemy does not take
[2:16:50] it away from you praise Beauty God
[2:16:54] shall we stand for a word of prayer as a
[2:16:57] song leader gets ready to come over
[2:17:02] our Lord and our Master Jesus we thank
[2:17:04] you so much oh God for your word that
[2:17:07] has come to us once again
[2:17:09] you know the desires of our house Lord
[2:17:12] you know our hard eggs and our headaches
[2:17:16] of course
[2:17:17] and you have always tailored your
[2:17:19] message Father to meet our needs
[2:17:22] we thank you Lord Jesus for speaking to
[2:17:24] us

[2:17:34] living by the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:17:38] father that when you yourself came in
[2:17:40] human life Lord you came into this body
[2:17:44] you could have lived any life because
[2:17:46] you are God
[2:17:47] but you chose
[2:17:49] to live by the Faith of Our Fathers and
[2:17:52] today there is an empty empty tomb as
[2:17:56] proof of what the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:17:59] can do in the lives of your children
[2:18:03] father we prayed this morning we pray
[2:18:05] that this afternoon oh God

[2:18:11] do not let us pray ever Stray From the
[2:18:14] Path of Righteousness Lord
[2:18:17] let us walk according to your word Lord
[2:18:21] do not let us ever tell to the left or
[2:18:23] to the right
[2:18:25] let our lives be so grafted to your word
[2:18:30] that father nothing else Under the Sun
[2:18:33] would actually matter to us but your
[2:18:34] word
