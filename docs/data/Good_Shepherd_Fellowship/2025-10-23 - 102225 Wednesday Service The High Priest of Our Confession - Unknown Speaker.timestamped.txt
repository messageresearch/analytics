[32:15] Lord
[32:19] and father
[32:21] there is no one
[32:23] like you. Let's sing that to the Lord.
[32:30] carries
[32:33] like you.
[32:38] Lord, no one else can touch my heart
[32:44] like you do.
[32:49] I could search throughout
[32:53] eternality,
[32:54] Lord,
[32:56] and find
[32:59] there is no
[33:01] like. Let's sing that one more time.
[33:03] There's none like you.
[33:08] There is none like you,
[33:14] oh Jesus.
[33:17] No one else can touch my heart like you
[33:22] do.
[33:26] I could search for all in time
[33:34] and find
[33:36] there is no like you.
[33:41] Just before we pray, I just want to read
[33:44] this and uh uh get it get it off my
[33:47] note. That would be the first code there
[33:50] and uh second coming. Brother Brandon
[33:52] share this. Now when we used to have our
[33:54] meetings, this was uh this was the team
[33:58] of our meeting. That's why we were using
[34:00] you can put it up. That's we were using
[34:02] that code for the team of our meeting.
[34:05] But Ram says
[34:07] when that time comes when the church
[34:09] find it brotherly love when the church
[34:13] find is holy decency when the church
[34:17] find it place in Christ it will call to
[34:20] the other members of the body come and
[34:23] rejoice with us. God want his church to
[34:28] love him. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh,
[34:32] this gone Sunday, we were talking a
[34:33] little bit on, uh, uh, church church
[34:36] discipline and, uh, we we will continue
[34:39] if as the Lord will continue to inspired
[34:41] us. But just like we were trying to say
[34:44] that you know uh we we brought that
[34:46] thought just to be able to remind us
[34:50] living in such a time where there is
[34:52] just a great pressure uh uh on on God's
[34:56] people and uh uh not not only only us as
[35:00] an assembly is is with the the bride of
[35:03] Jesus Christ around the world God's
[35:05] people everywhere dealing with one thing
[35:07] or another is either family thing or the
[35:10] financial thing or a health thing. I
[35:13] mean, the devil knowing that his time is
[35:15] out. He's throwing everything that he
[35:17] can at God's people. Praise the Lord.
[35:20] But you see, we have a commission uh uh
[35:22] from the Lord uh that we we have to
[35:25] brother Brandon in talking here. He was
[35:27] talking about that woman that lost her
[35:29] queen. She was sweeping all over the
[35:31] place. We tried to find it. And that is
[35:33] the place you have to realize that
[35:35] brotherly kindness, it is it is the call
[35:38] for our age. That is our place in the
[35:40] capstone. Amen. That brotherly kindness,
[35:43] we know that we going into the a we can
[35:45] talk about all of that. But uh uh we
[35:48] also see that uh we we we we have to
[35:52] find our holy decency. We have to get
[35:56] back to that place where the house of
[35:57] God is a decent place where our thoughts
[36:00] and our our motives and uh and and our
[36:03] objectives of coming to church is just
[36:05] purely on the word and also the church
[36:09] finding its place in Christ. And brother
[36:12] Bam says and then the rapture we go when
[36:15] the bride know who she is when she find
[36:17] her place in Christ. So we just want to
[36:20] also use that as a prayer need tonight.
[36:23] We want to use that as a token as we go
[36:25] to the Lord in prayer bringing all of
[36:27] these sick needs. Let's also pray and
[36:30] then just commit oursel in the hands of
[36:32] God as a as an assembling. The year is

[36:37] gone November the end of the year. We'll
[36:39] soon be ringing the bell of uh uh 2026.
[36:43] But before that time, we just want to
[36:45] once again just commit ourself in the
[36:47] hands of the Lord. We want this place to
[36:50] be a place where God will meet us every
[36:52] time we come. A place where oh uh the
[36:56] the burdens will be lifted from people.
[36:58] Hearts will be mended and and healing
[37:01] will come to people when we bring knees
[37:03] when we bring people's sick need. We
[37:06] will not just mumble with our our lips
[37:08] but we will be able to put our hearts
[37:11] and put ourself in people's shoes. see

[48:47] from verse 14. And then we will go just
[48:51] roll down into chapter 5.
[48:53] Chapter 14. Seeing then that we have a
[48:56] great high priest that is passed into
[49:00] the heaven, Jesus the son of God. Let us
[49:05] hold fast our profession. Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben said is the same word
[49:10] confession. Yeah. Hold fast our
[49:12] confession. Hold fast our profession.
[49:15] For we have not an high priest which
[49:18] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[49:21] our infirmities. Amen. But was in all
[49:25] point tempted like as we are yet without
[49:30] sin. Amen.
[49:31] He can be touched by the feelings of our
[49:34] infirmities
[49:35] and also he was tempted in every way.
[49:40] Whatever we are going through, he was in
[49:42] a body system elements,
[49:46] he could feel it. Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; He could feel it. He felt hungry.
[49:54] He felt sick. He felt lonely. He felt uh
[49:58] forsaking.
[49:59] Verse
[50:02] 16. Let us therefore come boldly
[50:05] &gt;&gt; unto the throne of grace that we may
[50:08] obtain mercy and find grace in help.
[50:12] Grace to help in time of need.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight. Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; This is a time of need and we need that
[50:22] grace to help us. Chapter 5 verse one.
[50:25] For every high priest taken from among
[50:29] men is ordained for men in things
[50:33] pertaining to God, that he may offer
[50:36] both gifts and sacrifices for sin. Who
[50:40] who can have compassion on the ignorant,
[50:43] the high priest can, and on them that
[50:46] are out of the way, for that he himself
[50:49] also is compassed with infirmities.
[50:54] Praise the Lord.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And by reason of he ought as for the
[51:00] people, so also for himself to offer
[51:06] for sin.
[51:08] Praise the Lord.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And no man taketh this honor unto
[51:13] himself,
[51:15] but he that is called of God
[51:19] as also Aaron. Father, bless your word.
[51:23] is your internal word. May you just drop
[51:26] thoughts in our hearts tonight.
[51:28] Something that will comfort us, that
[51:29] will strengthen us, thoughts that will
[51:32] draw us closer to you. In Jesus name we
[51:35] pray. Amen. The Lord bless you. You may
[51:38] have your seat. You know when uh like we
[51:41] have said before, when Jesus said to the
[51:43] woman, you know, uh uh uh go and sin no
[51:47] more. When he says, "Neither do I
[51:49] condemn thee. go and sin no more. Jesus
[51:53] was not just telling the woman uh uh uh
[51:56] don't what you did don't do it again.
[51:58] No, that's not what he was telling her.
[52:00] But he was giving uh divine command in
[52:03] her life that uh you had just been
[52:06] released from guilt.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; You have also been released from the
[52:10] thing that was holding you that was
[52:12] bounding you. Praise the Lord. So I
[52:14] believe that this word have enough power
[52:17] that it can be preached to us and it can
[52:20] free us from whatever that is bothering
[52:22] us. Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; It has enough power you know to uh to
[52:26] come right to that dividing that sunder
[52:29] of our soul and spirit our mind and and
[52:32] and and our entire inner being and and
[52:35] and be able to help us. That's that's
[52:37] how much power I believe that is in the
[52:40] word. Praise the Lord. Tonight we want
[52:42] to look at uh a little thought that we
[52:44] want to we want to call the high priest
[52:47] of our confession.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; We want to look at the high priest of
[52:50] our confession. But uh what I want to do
[52:54] uh because I don't want to I don't want
[52:56] to be too far away from what we were
[52:58] talking about. Uh, I want to I want to I
[53:01] want to bring uh us back to to uh uh
[53:05] just just keep us in the cycles of what
[53:08] we we we've been speaking about uh of
[53:11] the anointing and the riders and the
[53:14] seven spirits and the seven eyes. I I
[53:17] want to just keep us right in there. But
[53:19] there is something that I want to share
[53:20] with you tonight. And and the reason why
[53:23] I want to I'm speaking on this trying to
[53:26] bring it, you know, from uh uh a Sunday
[53:29] service talking about church discipline
[53:33] and uh uh we just found that way to be
[53:36] able to to uh uh uh you know give
[53:40] ourself a title and just to be able to
[53:42] talk to ourself a little bit. You know
[53:44] when we had that church meeting where we
[53:46] shut down from service, there was just a
[53:49] whole lot that was on my mind. And I was
[53:50] I was really burning and there were
[53:53] things that I want to talk about. But uh
[53:56] again I I I was I was just I was just
[53:59] saying Lord uh uh uh you know help me
[54:02] and I want to bring these things so the
[54:04] people can get under it. They can they
[54:06] can be able to get under the burden of
[54:08] what is on my heart to see to be able to
[54:11] understand that the I mean uh this is
[54:14] not just a social gathering. Amen. We
[54:16] have a responsibility. We have a divine
[54:20] commission from God. Amen. Praise the
[54:22] Lord. We have a divine commission from
[54:25] God. I don't know what about other
[54:26] assembly in Minneapolis, but I believe
[54:30] this little assembly on this corner of
[54:33] the street 6900
[54:35] uh Humble Avenue have a divine
[54:38] commission. Amen. And and and our
[54:41] responsibility here is to quiet the
[54:43] spirit in Minneapolis. Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; It's our responsibility. Praise the
[54:47] Lord. Like I said, I'm not responsible
[54:49] for other groups and you know and what
[54:51] they are doing and what they are
[54:52] preaching, but I believe that we have a
[54:56] divine responsibility to stand in the
[54:58] gap to pray for our city, pray for our
[55:00] people, pray for the the believers that
[55:03] are everywhere around the city,
[55:04] everywhere around the the country, you
[55:07] know, and uh uh you know uh that's
[55:10] that's our commission. Praise the Lord.
[55:12] And for us to do that, we have to equip
[55:16] ourself. Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; We have to fortify ourself.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Because if we take on that
[55:22] responsibility, if we as a church say we
[55:25] are responsible for this city, praise
[55:28] the Lord, to be able to lift up the name
[55:30] of Jesus Christ just from this little
[55:32] corner. If we take on that
[55:34] responsibility, I'm telling you, every
[55:37] devil in this city is going to turn
[55:39] against us. Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. They say they have a
[55:43] Buddhist temple. It has a haricrishna
[55:46] temple. You if you if you you really
[55:48] don't know about Minneapolis. Amen. You
[55:51] really don't know about Minneapolis. I
[55:53] mean you having bunch of adult places
[55:56] all around this place. All around this
[55:58] city. Praise the Lord. And uh uh you
[56:02] know uh uh uh and and just just a whole
[56:04] lot. Praise the Lord. Just a whole lot.
[56:06] I mean you go you drive downtown in some
[56:08] of these places you just see you see you
[56:11] just see the spirits in all of his
[56:12] colors.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; So if we are taking on that
[56:16] responsibility which of course we are
[56:18] taking on it.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't want to be part of it
[56:22] then you you can draw your lines but we
[56:24] are taking on. Amen. And uh uh uh
[56:27] because because you see you just you
[56:30] just cannot play a fair neighbor with
[56:32] the devil.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; If if Satan is your neighbor, you cannot
[56:39] play fair neighbor with him.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because every morning
[56:43] when you get up, he move he move his f
[56:46] closer to your house.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "No, you know, I'm just
[56:53] planting some flowers." It's just the
[56:55] flowers that is crossing over. You You
[56:57] cannot play a fair neighbor with him.
[56:59] You got to cut those flowers down. Amen.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You got to cut it down. Cut it down from
[57:03] the root.
[57:05] and push him back to his boundaries.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So you I mean you we cannot play
[57:14] niceness in this age.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; And I think that is the thing that we've
[57:17] been trying to do.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean we've been know you
[57:21] know uh you know just just a kind of a
[57:24] church of uh uh uh you know uh an
[57:27] inclusive group and uh and we start
[57:29] allowing all our young people to start
[57:31] misbehaving.
[57:33] Watch boys here coming with their hairs
[57:35] all flying in the air
[57:37] &gt;&gt; and we see them and they are sitting
[57:39] there and it's not even helping them.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; It's not like they are doing those
[57:43] things asking for help. They are doing
[57:45] it and gradually going away from God,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:49] &gt;&gt; They grow their hair wide. They pierce
[57:51] their ears and and and all and they are
[57:53] gradually going away from the Lord.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And I mean we just want to be nice to
[57:58] them and and and it is not it is not
[58:01] helping us,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:03] It's not helping them either.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; It's not helping them.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We must tell them that it's not right.
[58:12] We love them, but it's not right.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh let's let's talk about the
[58:24] high priest tonight. Our high priest.
[58:27] and and and I my my I'm actually taking
[58:30] this from Zach uh uh Zecharias chapter
[58:32] 3. Let's go to Zechariah chapter 3.
[58:35] That's where we want to read from
[58:36] tonight. We just read uh uh uh Hebrew as
[58:41] our scripture reading. But actually in
[58:43] Zechariah chapter 3, the the Lord used
[58:48] Zachchariah to be able to to show
[58:51] something to the house of Israel.
[58:55] the uh uh uh and and and because if you
[58:57] study the book of Zachcharias,
[59:00] Zachcharias had eight vision, eight
[59:04] successive vision in one night. The
[59:07] whole book of of Zachchariah, he's
[59:09] telling us those visions he had. It was
[59:12] eight successive vision he had in one
[59:15] night.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says one vision
[59:17] will kill you.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you think about a man having
[59:21] eight visions
[59:23] &gt;&gt; in one night. Now, but uh uh uh uh now
[59:28] so so watch this now as as we go along
[59:31] here. If you remember from our our study
[59:34] last week, we were talking on the seven
[59:36] spirits. Uh we read in Revelation
[59:38] chapter 5, Revelation chapter 4,
[59:40] Revelation chapter 3. We you know we we
[59:42] kind of twist there. But something we
[59:45] read from the church ages a single copy
[59:47] book brand says now the seven spirits
[59:50] that are before God these seven spirit
[59:53] was represented
[59:55] as the seven spirit that when that will
[59:59] be sent forth for the church ages seven
[1:00:04] spirit before God. We could pick up we
[1:00:08] could we could pick up from the Old
[1:00:11] Testament and pick it out there if we
[1:00:15] just had time. Praise the Lord. So he's
[1:00:18] telling us there is a representation of
[1:00:21] the seven spirit over in the in the new
[1:00:24] in the Old Testament if we have time.
[1:00:26] Last Wednesday, we went back. We read
[1:00:29] from Chronicles where the Bible talks
[1:00:31] about the eyes of God moving to and
[1:00:33] forth. You know, uh uh uh uh the prophet
[1:00:36] was warning that king. You are relying
[1:00:38] on the arm of flesh. You are taking you
[1:00:40] know uh uh uh your eyes from on the
[1:00:43] Lord. So uh uh uh that's what we want to
[1:00:46] stay in that thought. Oh, I just I pray
[1:00:49] that the Lord will be able to help me
[1:00:51] tonight to be able to bring this to you.
[1:00:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so let's go to to to uh
[1:00:57] Zachcharias chapter 3 and we read from
[1:01:00] there. And he's showing Joshua. Now,
[1:01:03] Zachcharias is having a vision and he's
[1:01:07] in this vision, he's seeing Joshua the
[1:01:10] high priest. This is not Joshua the son
[1:01:12] of Noah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; No, not the Joshua that was with Moses.
[1:01:16] This is a different Joshua. Now, this
[1:01:18] time in Israel history, they they have
[1:01:21] come from Babylon.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. they have come from Babylon. Uh uh
[1:01:26] uh at this time the Joshua with Moses
[1:01:28] was from Egypt. This Joshua is from
[1:01:30] Babylon. So he showed me Joshua the high
[1:01:33] priest standing before the angel of the
[1:01:36] Lord and Satan standing at his right
[1:01:41] hand to resist him. Joshua it I mean
[1:01:45] Zachcharias is having this vision. He's
[1:01:47] seeing uh Joshua the high priest
[1:01:50] standing before the Lord as a high
[1:01:52] priest. That is his position. He had to
[1:01:55] stand before the Lord, pray for the
[1:01:57] people, stand before the Lord, h confess
[1:02:00] the people's sin in order of that. Now
[1:02:03] look at this picture carefully. Joshua
[1:02:06] means Jehovah Savior.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; So in another sense, Jesus
[1:02:14] means Joshua.
[1:02:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's the reason why we we
[1:02:23] rar account to talk about our high
[1:02:25] priest Jesus, the son of God. Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because that is what is
[1:02:30] being represented here. But uh uh as we
[1:02:34] go along, you will be able to see it
[1:02:36] because it shows our high priest Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ. It also show sometimes
[1:02:44] what the ministry goes through.
[1:02:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Because the fight for ministry, the
[1:02:53] pastor of the local church
[1:02:56] works closely in the office of the high
[1:02:58] priest.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He works closely in the office of the
[1:03:06] Old Testament high priest.
[1:03:09] He's supposed to be he's supposed to be
[1:03:11] uh uh at the altar, you know, standing
[1:03:13] and and and uh uh uh for the people, you
[1:03:16] know, uh praying and and consecrating
[1:03:18] himself. You see, uh uh uh the the the
[1:03:22] New Testament church is uh is uh is
[1:03:27] structure a little bit different and you
[1:03:29] know, and God deals with with people in
[1:03:32] their calling very different ways. But
[1:03:36] you know uh uh when when it comes over
[1:03:39] to the things of God, let me tell you
[1:03:43] there is no there is no h a a part-time
[1:03:46] service in God. It has to be a full-time
[1:03:50] service.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; It has to be a full-time service. I
[1:03:55] believe that every man of God supposed
[1:03:57] to be fulltime dedicated to the word of
[1:04:01] God, dedicated to the service of God,
[1:04:03] not only the word, giving himself to the
[1:04:05] word, giving himself to prayers, and
[1:04:08] also standing in the gap of the people.
[1:04:10] I will show you a picture here as as we
[1:04:12] go along. Now, here is Joshua the high
[1:04:15] priest standing before the angel of the
[1:04:17] Lord
[1:04:19] and Satan standing at his right hand to
[1:04:22] resist him. And the Lord said unto
[1:04:24] Satan, And the Lord said unto Satan, The
[1:04:28] Lord rebuked thee, oh Satan.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Even the Lord that have chosen
[1:04:35] Jerusalem. Now Jerusalem, choosing
[1:04:38] Jerusalem, a city that is choosing is a
[1:04:41] is a type of a choosing woman. Is a type
[1:04:44] of a choosing bride.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; So Jerusalem here is typing the bride.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; So, uh, uh, Joshua, I mean, uh,
[1:04:57] Zachchariah is in this vision. And in
[1:05:00] his vision, he's seeing the high priest
[1:05:02] standing before the Lord. He's in his
[1:05:05] position of service,
[1:05:08] but also in the vision, he's also seeing
[1:05:12] the enemy trying to resist him,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; trying to attack him.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Now, it is not Joshua that is saying the
[1:05:26] Lord rebuke thee.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; No, he's not the one saying it, but it
[1:05:32] is the Lord that is rebuking the devil.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Now, this man, he's in his post of duty.
[1:05:40] He's doing his work.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And the enemy, it's not like he's seeing
[1:05:45] the enemy. Zachariah in his vision is
[1:05:48] seeing this but Joshua is not seeing
[1:05:50] what is happening.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can only identify the devil by
[1:05:58] the by his characteristics.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord said unto Satan, the Lord
[1:06:07] rebuked thee. Oh Satan, even even the
[1:06:10] Lord that that have chosen Jerusalem
[1:06:12] rebuked thee.
[1:06:14] Is not this
[1:06:17] the the band plug out of the fire?
[1:06:21] Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garment
[1:06:27] and stood
[1:06:29] before the angel.
[1:06:32] Praise the Lord. You have to bear with
[1:06:34] me a little bit here. Amen. Now, if you
[1:06:38] read uh uh uh what we read from uh uh
[1:06:42] Hebrew uh chapter 4, uh if you did not
[1:06:46] pay attention to that, let's go back to
[1:06:48] that a little bit.
[1:06:51] Let's just let's just skip back to
[1:06:53] Hebrew chapter 4 a little bit quickly
[1:06:55] and then we will come back here.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when we read in Hebrew chapter
[1:07:03] 4,
[1:07:05] Paul is saying here Jesus Christ is our
[1:07:08] high priest. What is he saying? That our
[1:07:12] high priest, he is touched by the
[1:07:16] feelings of our infirmities.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; In another sense,
[1:07:24] we our weaknesses,
[1:07:27] our our our sin
[1:07:32] uh uh becomes the garment that our high
[1:07:35] priest wear.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; So, if Joshua is wearing a filthy
[1:07:44] garment,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; let let me let me not go ahead of
[1:07:48] myself. Let's let's let's let's let's
[1:07:50] continue to look there in Hebrew.
[1:07:53] Throw the page away.
[1:07:55] Let me not go ahead of myself. Let me
[1:07:57] let me just establish what I want to say
[1:07:58] here. He said he's touched by the
[1:08:00] feelings of our infirmities. And then
[1:08:02] when you come down
[1:08:05] to chapter 5
[1:08:13] verse three, it says, "And by reason of
[1:08:16] he ought as for the people,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; so also for himself.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; To offer sin. So the high priest is
[1:08:30] wearing his own burden.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And he's wearing the people own burden.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me tell you when you are
[1:08:41] dealing with something, okay? And I I
[1:08:44] don't care what it is, even if it is
[1:08:45] sickness.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh and and uh and
[1:08:50] and and and you you you tell your pastor
[1:08:53] about it, he talks about it and uh and
[1:08:56] and and he's standing in that place to
[1:08:58] anoint you with oil, to pray for you,
[1:09:01] and all of that. You know, brother
[1:09:02] Brandon will explain that, you know, how
[1:09:04] all of those spirits that are cast out
[1:09:06] of the meeting come back to attack him.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Now, you see that is the reason why the
[1:09:17] Old Testament uh uh priest had to be
[1:09:21] completely separated from the people. He
[1:09:23] he just still in the in in the
[1:09:25] tabernacle.
[1:09:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he needs to avail himself
[1:09:35] whenever the people comes with their
[1:09:37] need. He needs to be light enough.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; He don't need to be heavy and
[1:09:47] overburdened with his own thing
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; and then to charge the people think on
[1:09:51] himself then he's going to die.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; So he needs to be light enough.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; What about prayer? what about fasting
[1:10:01] and he just he need to be light enough
[1:10:03] so when the people bring their knees he
[1:10:06] can be able to jump into the fight. He
[1:10:08] can stay on his face and pray for them.
[1:10:11] He can be there to counsel them. Cry to
[1:10:13] God and say just like David knowh this
[1:10:17] bear or this lion is not going to take
[1:10:19] the sheep of God.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when we get so busy where we
[1:10:27] we we you know we have to be running
[1:10:29] after this and we running after that and
[1:10:31] there's no time to pray and and you know
[1:10:34] and we just pass the sheath and look for
[1:10:36] one quote you know brother Brandham says
[1:10:38] in in in this message brother Baron says
[1:10:40] this is the way to handle this that does
[1:10:42] not solve problem.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is it in this vision.
[1:10:53] Zachariah is seeing Joshua the high
[1:10:56] priest.
[1:10:58] Satan trying to resist him. But then
[1:11:01] moreover he's close with filthy garment
[1:11:06] as he stood before the angel.
[1:11:09] This word filthy garment really don't
[1:11:12] explain what is happening here.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] It does not explain what is happening
[1:11:20] but you will grab the concept just now.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; This word filter garment
[1:11:30] from the Greek is is is very foul. is is
[1:11:34] ugly
[1:11:36] because what what uh h uh uh what Joshua
[1:11:43] is covering your way if I was looking at
[1:11:44] that today
[1:11:47] or or the other day.
[1:11:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:14] When you look in here, you will see that
[1:12:16] the word
[1:12:19] the word filter G in here is is uh is is
[1:12:22] very gross because
[1:12:25] just just using the word filter, it does
[1:12:28] not really explain what it is. But uh
[1:12:32] let me let me just let me just help you
[1:12:35] yield.
[1:12:41] It says that it's from a it's it's from
[1:12:43] a root word that means
[1:12:45] a soul and uh
[1:12:51] uh as if
[1:12:54] a streetman which mean he's covered in
[1:12:57] his own mess.
[1:13:00] Okay. So then if you look here, it does
[1:13:02] not say filthy. It says stinky.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; It say stinking garment
[1:13:13] in in the Hebrew that does not say
[1:13:15] filthy. It say stinking garment because
[1:13:18] filthy really do not describe what is
[1:13:21] happening here.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like when Isaiah says,
[1:13:30] praise the Lord, when Isaiah says in
[1:13:33] Isaiah 64:6,
[1:13:36] "But we all, we are all as unclean
[1:13:40] things and all our unrighteousness
[1:13:44] is as filthy rag."
[1:13:48] It's the same word. Now, this is where I
[1:13:51] want to go tonight. I want to I I want
[1:13:54] to dive in the place of why our high
[1:13:58] priests have to stand before God because
[1:14:01] it's so easy for us to take on a
[1:14:05] selfrighteous spirit.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And a self-righteous spirit is stinking
[1:14:13] before God.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; A self-righteous spirit smells.
[1:14:22] Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Except righteous spirit do not help us
[1:14:27] to appreciate the grace of God every day
[1:14:30] of our life
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; because it give us the sense that we
[1:14:35] have achieved something and it looks
[1:14:37] like we are better than them.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; When we don't realize that the only
[1:14:44] thing that hangs over you is the grace
[1:14:47] of God.
[1:14:49] That's the only thing that hangs over
[1:14:50] you because evil thought goes through
[1:14:53] your mind. Evil desire goes through your
[1:14:55] your your mind.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; But there is the grace of God that hangs
[1:14:59] over you
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; that keeps you away from it.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; now? So we see this man, this priest
[1:15:11] here standing before the Lord. You think
[1:15:14] about it. Standing before the Lord.
[1:15:16] Brother Brandham, brother uh uh uh Don
[1:15:20] uh he used to help brother Brandham in
[1:15:21] the prayer line and one time he quit. He
[1:15:24] told brother Brandon I can't do this
[1:15:25] anymore. Brother Brandon says why do he
[1:15:28] says uh he said brother but he says he
[1:15:30] said I can't believe I'm standing right
[1:15:33] there where the angel of the Lord comes
[1:15:36] down and heal these people yet I have
[1:15:38] evil thought going through my mind.
[1:15:46] The angel of the Lord, the pillar of
[1:15:48] fire is there descending the people
[1:15:52] and he's having brother Brandon told him
[1:15:57] whatever you are going through time by
[1:15:59] 100.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I go through.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever you are going through,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; if you think it's so bad for you, times
[1:16:12] it by 100. That's why I call true.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Because he's not only taking it.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; He's looking right in the people life
[1:16:23] and see them committing adultery and see
[1:16:25] them commit. He's seeing it on a vision.
[1:16:28] Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Now, so
[1:16:46] this this high priest standing in the
[1:16:49] presence of God, Satan trying to resist
[1:16:52] him.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Another word is Satan is trying to
[1:16:56] accuse him. Right?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; As he's standing in the presence of God,
[1:17:00] Satan is trying to accuse him. See how
[1:17:03] filthy he is. See the thoughts that is
[1:17:05] going through his mind.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; But he's standing in the presence of
[1:17:10] God, standing on behalf of the people,
[1:17:13] confessing his sins and confessing the
[1:17:16] sins of the people. And yet Satan is
[1:17:19] trying to accuse him before God.
[1:17:28] And Joshua was clothed in filthy garment
[1:17:32] and stood before the angel.
[1:17:38] That's the reason why the Bible says uh
[1:17:40] God says come and let us reason
[1:17:42] together. Your sin may be as scal.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; There is no foul saint.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:52] of our unbelief and misbehavior that is
[1:17:55] so stink that God cannot come closer.
[1:17:59] There is no mess that we find oursself
[1:18:01] in that he cannot come closer.
[1:18:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] If God was just like like man with our
[1:18:20] self-righteousness,
[1:18:22] he would not take filthiness in his
[1:18:24] presence.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; He would tell the angel, "Pack this man
[1:18:28] away. He smells so stink."
[1:18:38] And he answered and spake unto those
[1:18:40] that stood before him, saying, "Take
[1:18:43] away the filthy garment from him."
[1:18:46] All of this is happening in vision.
[1:18:50] The priest comes and he's he's laboring
[1:18:53] for the people. He's offering the people
[1:18:55] needs before God. Oh God, help this
[1:18:57] family. Lord, help this young man. Yeah.
[1:19:00] Lord, help this young woman. Let her
[1:19:02] come to conviction. let her understand
[1:19:04] that uh you know let let this word be so
[1:19:07] real to her. He's doing all of that and
[1:19:09] yet the devil standing right there and
[1:19:10] accusing him.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's just not he's not like
[1:19:17] a Catholic priest that stay be behind
[1:19:19] the box. No, he's identified with the
[1:19:22] weaknesses of the people. He's
[1:19:24] identified with the failures of the
[1:19:26] people.
[1:19:33] That's the work of a prince.
[1:19:37] That's the reason why Paul says, "No man
[1:19:39] take this to himself." God has to call a
[1:19:43] man into it.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Just like Aaron was called into the
[1:19:48] priesthood.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Because if you are not called to it,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; you will spend your whole day on the
[1:19:55] phone talking people problem from one
[1:19:58] person to another. You know what is
[1:19:59] happening? I can't I can't imagine this
[1:20:01] other person is going through. Oh my
[1:20:02] god. Oh, I can't that that just all you
[1:20:05] do
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and that is the thing that people have
[1:20:18] seen and have experienced.
[1:20:20] It have destroyed the confidence
[1:20:24] between the the service the confidence
[1:20:26] in the service.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:29] We having the confidence in the man
[1:20:30] because we have a pastor. But the
[1:20:32] confidence in the service,
[1:20:37] the way the preacher should labor with
[1:20:39] the people, they have destroyed that.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Because of some of the things we have
[1:20:44] experienced
[1:20:46] and some of the things that people have
[1:20:48] experienced.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:54] And he said, the Lord said, and speak
[1:20:56] unto those that stood before him, those
[1:20:58] angels, saying, take away the filthy
[1:21:01] garment from him, and and onto him he
[1:21:05] said, behold, I have caused iniquity. So
[1:21:09] in the vision, the Lord is speaking to
[1:21:11] the angels to take the filthy garment
[1:21:14] off of of Joshua. And he's speaking to
[1:21:17] Joshua, and he say, "Behold, I have
[1:21:19] taken away your iniquity."
[1:21:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; This is all happening in a vision.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Visions should be wonderful things.
[1:21:33] Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And also terrifying things.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Terrifying experience.
[1:21:40] Behold, I have caused thy iniquity to
[1:21:43] pass from thee, and I will clothe thee
[1:21:47] with change of rim.
[1:21:51] Praise the Lord. I will close thee with
[1:21:53] change of rim. Let's let's go quickly as
[1:21:56] time is getting off our hand. And and
[1:21:58] and I said, let them set the feral merch
[1:22:04] upon his head. So they set a ferret mer
[1:22:07] upon his head and clothed him with
[1:22:09] garments,
[1:22:11] and the angel of the Lord stood by, and
[1:22:15] the angel of the Lord protested unto
[1:22:19] Joshua, saying, Thus say the Lord of
[1:22:23] hosts, if thou will walk in my ways, and
[1:22:28] if thou will keep my charge, then thou
[1:22:32] shall also judge my house, and shall
[1:22:36] also keep my courts, and I will give
[1:22:39] thee places to walk among these that
[1:22:42] stand by.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And who was standing by? Those angels.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will give you a place among
[1:22:48] them. Are we together?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] Here now, oh Joshua the high priest,
[1:22:56] thou and thy fellows that sit before
[1:22:59] thee, for they are men
[1:23:02] uh h wonder for behold I will bring
[1:23:07] forth my servant the branch.
[1:23:10] Now we know that in the old testament
[1:23:12] this branch represent Jesus Christ.
[1:23:15] Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; In the old testament he was called the
[1:23:18] branch. But when he came, he said, "I am
[1:23:20] the vine, you are the branch."
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I am the vine, you are
[1:23:27] the branch." In the Old Testament,
[1:23:29] Isaiah call him the branch. And uh and
[1:23:31] yet Zechariah is calling him the branch.
[1:23:34] So uh uh uh the angel says, "Behold, I
[1:23:37] will bring for myself the branch." Now
[1:23:39] watch carefully now. This is where I
[1:23:41] want to get to. For behold, the stone
[1:23:45] that I have laid before Joshua the high
[1:23:48] priest,
[1:23:50] upon one stone
[1:23:53] shall be seven eyes.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Now, we go back
[1:24:01] to what we were looking at uh uh last
[1:24:05] week from Revelation. the seven eyes,
[1:24:08] the seven spirit which are the seven
[1:24:10] horns and the seven eyes that are before
[1:24:14] the Lord. Now here we seeing also here
[1:24:17] in this time God now is showing Joshua
[1:24:21] that after he has gone through all of
[1:24:24] this experience in a vision he has gone
[1:24:26] through all of this experience God is
[1:24:28] also now introducing him to something
[1:24:31] that's where I want to bring bring us
[1:24:32] tonight and behold the stone that I lay
[1:24:36] before Joshua upon one stone shall be
[1:24:38] seven eyes behold I will in engrave the
[1:24:42] engraving thereof
[1:24:44] the Lord of hosts and I will remove the
[1:24:48] iniquity of the land in one day. Praise
[1:24:52] the Lord.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And in that day shall the Lord of hosts
[1:24:59] shall ye call every man his neighbor on
[1:25:03] the vine and on the fig tree. Praise the
[1:25:06] Lord.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, so we see just like
[1:25:14] Joshua, so our high priest is and also
[1:25:18] we bring in it as a little type of what
[1:25:20] our ministry is supposed to be, what
[1:25:22] what the pastoral ministry is supposed
[1:25:24] to be, the man that stands between the
[1:25:27] people and uh uh uh uh uh and the mercy
[1:25:31] seat. Now, so we see here that uh uh
[1:25:36] Joshua is now being introduced to
[1:25:39] something different here after this
[1:25:43] accusation of the devil trying to resist
[1:25:46] him. Now we also see here the Bible says
[1:25:49] and the angel of the Lord protested
[1:25:52] for Joshua. Amen.
[1:25:55] That word means that the angel of the
[1:25:58] Lord witnessed to him. Amen.
[1:26:01] The angel witness in his defense.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, oh Joshua the high priest,
[1:26:11] thou and thy fellows that sit before
[1:26:13] thee. Behold, behold, I will bring forth
[1:26:18] myself the branch. Now, the whole thing
[1:26:20] now, our Lord Jesus is introduced into
[1:26:23] it in another way. For for
[1:26:26] behold the stone that I I I I lay before
[1:26:31] Joshua upon one stone shall have seven
[1:26:33] eyes. Now so we see here we see and and
[1:26:37] that and and those seven eyes the
[1:26:39] scripture says I will engrave the
[1:26:41] engraving therefore say the Lord of
[1:26:43] hosts and I will remove the iniquity of
[1:26:47] the land in one day. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon will use this here
[1:26:55] in in in the bridge 1963. He says here,
[1:26:59] now I want to read Zechariah chapter 3.
[1:27:02] We we we are just going to get this
[1:27:06] symbol here. Now, he's teaching on the
[1:27:08] seven spirit. Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And then he's going to link it to to
[1:27:13] Zechariah chapter 3. The seven spirit we
[1:27:16] talk about that is the seven horns and
[1:27:18] the seven eyes. He's he's now going to
[1:27:21] link it now. And what did we say? Those
[1:27:24] four beasts have seven eyes. This is
[1:27:28] this is the eye of the Lord that run two
[1:27:30] and four. You will see it also here in
[1:27:32] Zechariah chapter 4. But what what
[1:27:34] actually it is is that that's that is
[1:27:37] the place where I want to bring you like
[1:27:39] I said on Sunday you know we we must
[1:27:42] realize that uh when God call us into
[1:27:46] his covenant when he call us as his
[1:27:49] children he's not looking at at uh at
[1:27:52] your ability. Amen. He's looking at his
[1:27:55] ability.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; He's the one that is making provision
[1:27:59] here giving you seven eyes to watch over
[1:28:02] you. Amen. Praise the Lord. So you see
[1:28:05] Joshua is coming through this vision
[1:28:08] where the enemy is is accusing him.
[1:28:10] Praise the Lord. And and and and and the
[1:28:13] enemy is accusing him of the filthiness
[1:28:15] that he have, the filthiness of the
[1:28:17] people just like Bam Balak tried to to
[1:28:21] bring Bam into to accuse the people
[1:28:23] before God. Now the enemy tried to
[1:28:25] accuse him. But then we see on the other
[1:28:28] side there is a stone that has seven
[1:28:31] eyes. Amen. that's been watching the
[1:28:33] whole scene. Joshua has to come through
[1:28:36] all of that trial of filthiness. He has
[1:28:39] to come to the place where the the angel
[1:28:42] was commanded, take the filthy garment
[1:28:44] from on him. You change his garment, put
[1:28:47] a clean gun. Why? Because there is an
[1:28:49] eye that was watching.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; The very eye that gave Zachariah the
[1:28:54] vision.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because what hashu
[1:29:00] the high priest was representing the
[1:29:03] people of Israel.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; So no matter what the people has gone
[1:29:10] through, no matter their backsliding and
[1:29:12] how they have filled God, but God got a
[1:29:16] man in his presence.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's going to use that man
[1:29:22] life on a vision
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; to tell them that I've been watching you
[1:29:27] out of this. Why? There is nothing of
[1:29:28] your life that is hid from me.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; But if you will walk in my ways,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; If thou will walk in my ways and keep my
[1:29:41] charge,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; praise, then I will give you a place
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; among
[1:29:47] these angels. Are we together? Oh, it is
[1:29:51] getting beautiful here. Chapter four.
[1:29:52] Let's go. Let's go ahead here.
[1:29:56] Chapter 4. And the angel that talked
[1:29:58] with me came and wake me as a man that
[1:30:02] is waking out of his sleep. And he said
[1:30:05] unto me, "What that?" Another vision
[1:30:07] broke out. Now Joshua came from one
[1:30:09] vision. Another vision broke out. The
[1:30:11] angel wake him up.
[1:30:13] Now remember, he's not dreaming. Daniel
[1:30:16] was the one that had dream that trouble
[1:30:18] him. This man is having vision. The
[1:30:20] angel woke him up as a man waking out of
[1:30:23] his sleep and said, "What see there?" He
[1:30:25] said, "I look and behold a candlestick
[1:30:30] or of gold with a bowl upon the top of
[1:30:34] it, and his seven lamps thereof, and
[1:30:38] seven pipes to the seven lambs,
[1:30:42] which are upon the top thereof." Praise
[1:30:46] the Lord.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] Now last week when we were talking about
[1:30:51] the seven eyes that represent the seven
[1:30:54] horns the I mean the seven spirit that
[1:30:56] represent the seven horns and and the
[1:30:58] seven eyes we trace it back to the
[1:31:00] church ages and it was also representing
[1:31:04] the seven golden candlestick.
[1:31:08] Now remember now brother Brandham told
[1:31:10] us we can pick these things up in the
[1:31:12] Old Testament.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It's not only unique to the New
[1:31:16] Testament. is not only unique to the
[1:31:19] church ages.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; All through the ages, God's people has
[1:31:25] been candlestick in his hands.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; God has raised up prophets and messenger
[1:31:33] as a lightbearer to lead his people from
[1:31:36] darkness to light.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; When do we use candle? In the night.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't need to use
[1:31:45] candle when the daylight is off. You use
[1:31:47] candle in the in the night. That's the
[1:31:49] reason why brother Brandham said all the
[1:31:51] messenger came in the evening time,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; To be able to lead the people through
[1:31:56] the darkness to the break of the
[1:31:57] morning,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; So you see even from the Old Testament,
[1:32:05] God eyes has been watching his people.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the reason why in Jeremiah
[1:32:12] he told Israel, I took you like a young
[1:32:14] lady. I saw you when you committed harot
[1:32:17] on all the tree. My eyes were upon you,
[1:32:19] but yet I pick you up out of your mess.
[1:32:22] I wash you. I dress you and I brought
[1:32:24] you to myself and call you my wife.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] right from the beginning.
[1:32:43] That is the reason why what took place
[1:32:44] in Eden never took God by surprise. His
[1:32:48] eyes were open.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; His eyes was looking down.
[1:32:57] When the Hebrew babies were slaughtered,
[1:32:59] God was not sleeping. His eyes were
[1:33:02] open.
[1:33:05] Are we together?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:09] He's touched by the feelings of your
[1:33:12] infirmities.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; He knows what you are going through. He
[1:33:15] feel it.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham says our God is not an a a
[1:33:22] h an imperson God. A one that is not
[1:33:26] that is not real. He say he's a god that
[1:33:28] is identified.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. He says uh uh uh uh God
[1:33:34] rich in mercy. Every little thing that
[1:33:36] concern you matters to God.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; The problem there is that is it real to
[1:33:46] us?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Is it real to us? Is is that is it the
[1:33:51] way we see it?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Do we see that? Just like his eyes are
[1:33:57] on the spirals, his eyes is on us. Are
[1:34:01] we seeing it like that? Is it real to
[1:34:03] you?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Is it real to us or it's just a lecture?
[1:34:17] Are we able to trust God
[1:34:20] to know that he knows our emotion? He
[1:34:24] knows our disappointment. He knows our
[1:34:27] hurts.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; He knows. Are we able to trust God like
[1:34:31] that? Do we really see him like that?
[1:34:37] Or is something we are considering in
[1:34:39] our mind? It could be truth. It could
[1:34:41] not be truth. No, no, no, no, no. It's
[1:34:44] truth.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Because he's he's showing right here
[1:34:50] that all through the ages.
[1:34:54] Now, we read this. There's no time for
[1:34:56] us to read the entire thing. Let's drop
[1:34:58] down. Let's drop down a little bit here.
[1:35:01] Woo.
[1:35:04] Let's Let's drop down a little bit
[1:35:05] there. Let's Let's go over to to verse 8
[1:35:08] of chapter 4. Moreover, the word of the
[1:35:11] Lord came unto me, saying, "The hand of
[1:35:13] Zarab has laid the foundation of this
[1:35:16] house. His hand shall finish it." Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; The alpha and omega principle. God is
[1:35:23] showing in a vision. I started this. I
[1:35:25] will finish it. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Everything that concern your salvation,
[1:35:30] your redemption, I started it and I will
[1:35:33] finish it.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; If I have to drag you into heaven, I
[1:35:37] will drag you.
[1:35:47] Lord of hosts have sent me unto you.
[1:35:51] Verse 10, for who have despised
[1:35:56] the days of small things,
[1:35:59] for they shall rejoice
[1:36:02] and see the plummet in the hands of
[1:36:05] Zarabel
[1:36:07] with those seven. Which seven? Now he's
[1:36:11] pointing back to the seven in verse two.
[1:36:15] with those seven.
[1:36:18] Amen.
[1:36:23] They shall rejoice and see the plummet
[1:36:25] in the hands of Zarubbabel with those
[1:36:27] seven. They are the eyes of the Lord
[1:36:30] which run to and forth through the whole
[1:36:34] earth. In Revelation chapter 5, that was
[1:36:37] the scene where it was identified the
[1:36:39] seven out of the Lord which cover the
[1:36:41] whole earth. So it's not only concerning
[1:36:43] the seven church ages.
[1:36:47] It's been there right from time
[1:36:50] when it looks like the people of God
[1:36:52] were abandoned in in in Babylon and and
[1:36:55] it looks like Nebuchinnezar just had
[1:36:58] charge of these people and and uh you
[1:37:00] know and and and and I mean the
[1:37:02] slaughter and the the the rape and all
[1:37:04] the evil that was going on. His eyes was
[1:37:07] there.
[1:37:09] He kept his eyes on Shedra, Misha, and
[1:37:11] Abednego.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; He kept his eyes on the Daniel.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; He kept his eyes on a little group of
[1:37:17] people that was standing for his word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And he will bring he will bring Joshua
[1:37:28] against Babylon for what Nebuchadnezzar
[1:37:32] did to his people. He said, "I gave them
[1:37:34] to you and then after I will judge you,
[1:37:37] I will punish you."
[1:37:43] Are we together?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; He took and and and that is what our
[1:37:53] high priest does. That is what our high
[1:37:56] priest does. Okay, we're right here on
[1:37:58] time.
[1:38:00] Glory be to God.
[1:38:03] Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Ban says something here. It was it was
[1:38:07] wonderful when I read it. He says uh he
[1:38:10] said this. He said uh oh Joshua the high
[1:38:13] priest and his fellow he says uh
[1:38:20] okay he read the very same scripture. I
[1:38:22] would bring for myself the branch which
[1:38:24] is Christ. For behold the stone that lay
[1:38:28] before Joshua. Seven eyes. He gets he
[1:38:30] gets here.
[1:38:33] Okay. Up there. He says
[1:38:36] uh we're just going to see the symbol of
[1:38:39] this. He says if I got my scripture
[1:38:41] wrote in there, I just he says I was I I
[1:38:44] was just shouting all over the place
[1:38:46] this afternoon when I hit this. Amen. He
[1:38:49] says when I when I came to realize that
[1:38:52] what is in revelation is also here.
[1:38:55] Amen. It just broke a revival in my
[1:38:56] heart. Amen. I was just shouting all
[1:38:58] over the place and yeah that's exactly
[1:39:01] what happened when the word opened to
[1:39:03] you. Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Now so here brother Brandon was says
[1:39:08] what do thou hear Elijah he's uhh what
[1:39:11] dust thou hear? He says that's what the
[1:39:14] church need is a revival to shake shake
[1:39:17] from all of its worldiness and the
[1:39:20] things of the word. You see because
[1:39:22] because uh we are losing our grip on the
[1:39:26] confidence of the word.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When people start
[1:39:32] backsliding is because they are losing
[1:39:35] their grip. It looks like the word is
[1:39:38] not doing it for me. It looks like these
[1:39:41] promises that that is said is truth is
[1:39:44] not coming to pass.
[1:39:47] and we start losing our grip
[1:39:50] and all that is left with us is just a
[1:39:52] form. We just have a form but we don't
[1:39:55] trust the word.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; We don't believe the word.
[1:40:00] If we believe the word it will affect
[1:40:02] our attitude.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; We will have the attitude that says even
[1:40:08] though he's flaming, I will trust him.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; People start losing their their
[1:40:16] concentration. They start losing their
[1:40:18] consciousness of right and wrong.
[1:40:24] And when we start indulging ourself in
[1:40:26] things,
[1:40:28] no time to pray, no time to read the
[1:40:31] word, no time for meditation, no time,
[1:40:33] no quiet time, no time to listen to the
[1:40:36] still small voice.
[1:40:40] It's just lost.
[1:40:48] shake off the worldliness and the things
[1:40:50] of the word and bring back purity and
[1:40:52] the holiness of God in the hearts of the
[1:40:55] believer. That's what we need. A feeling
[1:40:58] where we we hate what is wrong.
[1:41:04] You'll realize that when people talk
[1:41:06] about hatred today, it's not against
[1:41:09] things. It's against people. I hate
[1:41:11] them. I hate them.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; They are not hating what is supposed to
[1:41:15] hate.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Bring back the purity and holiness of
[1:41:26] God in the hearts of the believer.
[1:41:30] They don't get revival once in a while
[1:41:32] in the spirit. They become so conned and
[1:41:35] so indifferent till till they get self
[1:41:40] tied and starchy self-righteous.
[1:41:44] That's that's that it was God is God way
[1:41:47] of describing self-righteousness
[1:41:51] because just like us that's how the the
[1:41:54] the the the Jewish people were. That's
[1:41:56] how the the the the the the Israelites
[1:42:00] were right here. They fear that they
[1:42:02] were the people of God. They just took
[1:42:04] the name of the people of God. We are
[1:42:06] the children of Abraham. But they were
[1:42:08] indulging in all the things. So when God
[1:42:12] want to show our self-righteousness, he
[1:42:14] says, "What is in you? What is in your
[1:42:18] stomach?"
[1:42:22] Praise the Lord. Our self-righteousness
[1:42:25] is like you taking the dirt from your
[1:42:28] stomach and covering your entire body
[1:42:30] with it.
[1:42:31] That's how God sees self-righteousness.
[1:42:34] It stink in his nose.
[1:42:40] That is the beginning of the backsliding
[1:42:42] of the church. When a person starts to
[1:42:44] backslide,
[1:42:46] they start to become self-righteous.
[1:42:54] It just put them to that place where
[1:42:55] they they know how to condemn all of
[1:42:57] you. See the other one. See the other
[1:42:58] one. See the other one.
[1:43:02] No, it's supposed to be at a place where
[1:43:05] your heart becomes the mercy seat of
[1:43:07] God. You say, "Oh God, have mercy. Help
[1:43:10] these children. Help this my neighbor.
[1:43:11] Help these people." If they just
[1:43:13] wouldn't knew the grace of God that has
[1:43:15] come to us. If they knew the judgment
[1:43:17] that is coming upon this world,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; we only know that we are doing well.
[1:43:29] Me and my family, we serving the Lord.
[1:43:31] Me and my children
[1:43:34] start self-righteous
[1:43:36] rethe. That's good. But that's the thing
[1:43:40] we are talking about.
[1:43:42] You know more about the word. It's good
[1:43:45] to know the word, but it is better to
[1:43:48] know the altar of the word. Yeah.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; See that little something that you leave
[1:43:54] out, that little thing that you leave
[1:43:56] out.
[1:43:59] We get on our knees to pray that just it
[1:44:01] just Oh, God help me. God help. It's
[1:44:03] just you and you and you.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Who's the next person you are burdening
[1:44:07] for?
[1:44:18] That little something you leave out that
[1:44:21] that's something in your heart that
[1:44:23] makes you what you are. That is the
[1:44:26] think.
[1:44:28] Praise the Lord. That is the think. See
[1:44:31] what he says of you
[1:44:34] in message one.
[1:44:37] He says, "If ye abide in me, my word
[1:44:39] abide in you. Ask what you will and it
[1:44:41] shall be done unto you. If ye abide in
[1:44:44] me and my word abide in you," what is
[1:44:46] it?
[1:44:48] You have got to get the word.
[1:44:51] Get yourself killed out. Die to
[1:44:53] yourself.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Die to yourself. Let Christ live in us.
[1:45:07] I'm persuaded that many of us friends
[1:45:10] have received the Holy Ghost but just we
[1:45:13] just received enough Holy Ghost to make
[1:45:16] to make us to be to make us to the place
[1:45:19] where we don't want to lie. We don't
[1:45:22] want to steal. We don't want to do so. I
[1:45:25] mean, we don't dress because we don't
[1:45:26] smoke. We don't drink. We just think
[1:45:28] that we have we have made it. We think
[1:45:31] that we have achieved
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Christ in us.
[1:45:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:45:40] We think we have achieved it.
[1:45:50] We have enough just not to make us lie
[1:45:52] and still we don't want to do anything.
[1:45:55] But God want to fill every fiber of his
[1:45:57] church.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He want to fill our thinking. He want to
[1:46:03] fill our mind and and fill every bit of
[1:46:06] you.
[1:46:08] Just make you completely totally dear to
[1:46:11] yourself
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; or to your thinking. just so surrender
[1:46:15] to God till the word of God just living
[1:46:18] right through you
[1:46:22] having the burden in your heart.
[1:46:26] What next? Lord,
[1:46:29] how can I how can I share this this hope
[1:46:32] that I have in me
[1:46:35] with this young lady?
[1:46:38] How can I have shared this hope that I
[1:46:41] have in me?
[1:46:43] Self-righteousness has just it make us
[1:46:46] so proud that we can't even talk about
[1:46:48] the Jesus we love.
[1:46:50] We so we so proud that it is it is only
[1:46:53] our Jesus.
[1:46:58] There's one thing that is killing the
[1:47:00] church especially around the message
[1:47:02] bunch of self-righteous people.
[1:47:05] We spend all our time blasting
[1:47:07] denomination and blasting and blasting
[1:47:08] and blasting when it's just hitting the
[1:47:11] word and coming right back to us.
[1:47:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; God was was was through a vision here to
[1:47:21] Zachchariah. He was trying to show the
[1:47:23] condition of the people
[1:47:26] how their self-righteousness is so
[1:47:29] burdened by this by this by this priest
[1:47:32] and the devil is there. They are trying
[1:47:34] to accuse him and and and and seeing
[1:47:36] condemn the people. Oh, see what has
[1:47:38] happened again. See what is going on in
[1:47:40] this other person life. See what is
[1:47:41] going on in this other person life.
[1:47:46] But he stay right there before God
[1:47:54] confessing his sin and confessing the
[1:47:55] sins of the people and saying, "Oh God,
[1:47:58] have mercy upon us.
[1:48:04] bring us a decent church once again
[1:48:06] where the people have decent spirit. It
[1:48:09] it does not become difficult to
[1:48:11] apologize. Oh brother, I'm sorry,
[1:48:13] sister. I'm very sorry.
[1:48:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:22] Are we together?
[1:48:29] Second hand of Galvin musicians, you can
[1:48:31] come. I want to wrap myself in his
[1:48:34] righteousness.
[1:48:35] I know there's a great shadow sitting
[1:48:38] before us. Every one of us is coming to
[1:48:40] death tonight. Friends, every every time
[1:48:44] your heartbeat, you are one step closer
[1:48:48] to that big door called death.
[1:48:52] One day you are going to make your last
[1:48:54] beat and you are going in
[1:48:58] and I realize as
[1:49:01] as your evangelist in seven I too I have
[1:49:04] to I have to go there go to there I have
[1:49:08] got to come down no matter how much I
[1:49:11] have preached about it I've got to come
[1:49:13] down to it but what I do
[1:49:17] I don't want to come in my own
[1:49:20] self-righteous rag
[1:49:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; When I see that my last beat coming up
[1:49:29] and I'm entering the door, I want to
[1:49:31] wrap myself in the robe of his
[1:49:34] righteousness.
[1:49:36] Knowing this that I know him in the
[1:49:39] power of his resurrection. You cannot
[1:49:42] know him in the power of the
[1:49:44] resurrection until you first know him in
[1:49:46] the forgiveness of your sin.
[1:49:50] You first know him as the God
[1:49:56] that stands between you and all of your
[1:49:58] wrong.
[1:50:06] You see, when you when when you come to
[1:50:08] that place
[1:50:10] and you get off that you get that
[1:50:12] self-righteous garment from on you,
[1:50:16] the things that you are struggling with,
[1:50:18] it does not condemn you because you know
[1:50:20] there is a there is one there that has a
[1:50:23] garment in his hands and is ready to
[1:50:25] take your filter garment off and put his
[1:50:28] robe upon you.
[1:50:32] That's what he did to our our father
[1:50:34] Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden when
[1:50:37] they took a fake a a a a fake leave and
[1:50:40] cover their shame. He what what did he
[1:50:43] do? He came down and took a bloody sheep
[1:50:45] skin representing his word. Wrapped them
[1:50:48] in a bleeding skin. And that's what God
[1:50:51] want to do to us. Wrap us in his word.
[1:50:57] Wrap us in his word.
[1:51:01] That is the thing that make us to
[1:51:02] appreciate the grace that we have.
[1:51:05] We don't walk like we have everything
[1:51:07] under control.
[1:51:10] Oh, I know my life. I know my life. You
[1:51:12] don't know your life. You don't know
[1:51:14] your life. You don't know what is
[1:51:15] against you.
[1:51:20] But you walk under the grace of God.
[1:51:22] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, thank you for
[1:51:24] your grace.
[1:51:27] If it was not because of your grace, I
[1:51:29] would have been like that man. I will
[1:51:30] have been like that woman. Thank you for
[1:51:32] your grace. Lord, I pray if there is
[1:51:35] just grace that can be able to meet them
[1:51:37] in their condition.
[1:51:46] As soon as the Lord can get
[1:51:48] self-righteousness from in our mind and
[1:51:50] and take us out of that filthy garment
[1:51:52] of self-righteousness, you will see how
[1:51:55] your heart will warm towards people.
[1:51:57] Even when you greeting the brother, you
[1:51:59] will see you will be so glad to be able
[1:52:01] to greet appreciating that the same
[1:52:03] grace that saved you is the same grace
[1:52:05] that saved this person.
[1:52:11] Let's
[1:52:20] bow our heads tonight.
[1:52:32] And I be wor
[1:52:34] Oh.
[1:52:37] Oh yes, Lord.
[1:52:39] and never fail.
[1:52:42] Teach me Lord. Oh, teach me Jesus
[1:52:49] how to live.
[1:52:54] Oh yes, they that wait
[1:53:00] upon the Lord
[1:53:03] shall renew
[1:53:07] their strength.
[1:53:10] They shall mount up
[1:53:14] with way
[1:53:17] as a eagle.
[1:53:22] Oh,
[1:53:23] they shall run
[1:53:26] and I be wary. Oh, they Yes, Lord. Yes,
[1:53:32] Jesus.
[1:53:35] Oh, teach me Lord.
[1:53:39] Oh, teach me Jesus
[1:53:44] how to wait. Let's just speak to the
[1:53:46] Lord while the musician play softly
[1:53:48] down. Let's just pray together tonight.
[1:53:51] Speak to the Lord yourself tonight and
[1:53:53] let just thank him. Let's just thank him
[1:53:56] that he is our high priest. He's touched
[1:53:58] by the feelings of our infrequities. He
[1:54:01] became sin for us that we might become
[1:54:03] his very righteousness. He was
[1:54:06] identified with all of our mess and he
[1:54:09] still identified with all of our
[1:54:11] failures, all of our weaknesses. But he
[1:54:14] has come with a with a clean garment in
[1:54:17] his hands. He has come with his own
[1:54:19] righteousness. Oh, sin is is an
[1:54:22] experience. When you experience that,
[1:54:25] you thank God every day. You lift up
[1:54:27] your hands in thanksgiving. You say,
[1:54:30] "Lord, it is your grace. Lord, I thank
[1:54:33] you for the grace that is still dealing
[1:54:35] with my heart. I thank you for the grace
[1:54:37] that is giving me strength every day.
[1:54:40] Lord, I know it's not by power. It's not
[1:54:42] about might,
[1:54:45] but it's by the spirit of the Lord.
