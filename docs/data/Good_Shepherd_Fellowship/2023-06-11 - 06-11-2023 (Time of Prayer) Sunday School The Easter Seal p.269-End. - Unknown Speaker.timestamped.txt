[1:31] brought up to the ground is somewhere
[1:32] there's an eternal flower blooming it'll
[1:34] take its place someday
[1:36] that's right no wonder Joy of Tears can
[1:39] run down our cheeks no wonder our hearts
[1:40] quiver and shake when we can feel that
[1:43] same transforming power coming into our
[1:45] lives
[1:46] filling us
[1:47] even for letting us speak in a language
[1:50] that comes from heaven
[1:52] we're so quick enough into his presence
[1:55] there
[1:56] prophesy
[1:57] 4C foretell and everything hitting
[2:00] perfectly with the word
[2:03] if it's prophesying contrary to that
[2:05] don't believe it
[2:06] but if it's with the word it's already
[2:08] said thus saith of the Lord
[2:11] fear not I am he that was dead and Alive
[2:14] forevermore

[3:37] that everything's all right don't you be
[3:39] deceived
[3:41] the coming of the Lord is at hand

[3:51] other down here and how that long before
[3:55] that earthquake shook over in Greece all
[3:57] the fish that usually feeds about that
[3:59] time of morning
[4:01] they didn't feed
[4:03] what was it there wasn't on the surface
[4:06] the second time it happened the same
[4:08] thing took place he knew right then
[4:10] something's going to happen that fish
[4:11] wasn't feeding at that time and all the
[4:13] gulls and things that feed on the fish
[4:15] they quit feeding
[4:17] that early in the morning that's when
[4:18] they feed they set up on the bank
[4:22] got away from the cliffs and hangs
[4:24] for just in a few minutes the sea moss
[4:27] begin to boil up out of the Earth
[4:29] off the seabed

[4:38] the earthquake must be over for days the
[4:41] little birds wouldn't come back to their
[4:42] nest in their rocks the cattle wouldn't
[4:45] stand around the shelters under the
[4:48] the shade and the Heat of the day the
[4:50] Sheep stood around the middle field
[4:51] leaned against one another
[4:53] they wouldn't go up around that rocks
[4:55] two or three days before the earthquake
[4:57] happened wow them sheep knew it

[19:30] feeling it's a strange feeling when I
[19:32] come among the people where you step
[19:34] together like this I know somewhere
[19:36] invisible here just like radio
[19:38] television whatever it is passing
[19:40] through this room Christ is in this room

[19:45] thank you
[19:47] holy he's here
[19:52] and
[19:53] who could be any happier than people who
[19:56] possessed with Bible evidence
[19:59] of every word of God being made manifest
[20:01] to see even to angels and his being as
[20:05] they have through the the ages and hear
[20:07] the words of the seers predicted it had
[20:10] happened just exactly and here we are at
[20:13] the eve of his comments
[20:15] a whole
[20:18] what a wonderful time
[20:21] we'll see one of these days you'll be
[20:24] here until he does come
[20:27] but you pray for me yeah
[20:30] I've got dangerous perils in front of me
[20:32] I mean I know it seems
[20:34] and I meet with heathens who would shoot
[20:36] you the same as taking a drink of water
[20:38] and you're just paid for it you come on
[20:39] their ground
[20:41] Devil's gotta challenge you in the Bible
[20:43] just as easy but I've never seen a time
[20:45] about our God won the victory
[20:48] uh go in his name yes in the name of the
[20:52] Lord Jesus Christ the hope of eternal
[20:55] life the resurrection and the life
[20:58] he that liveth and believeth to me
[21:00] though he were dead yet shall he live
[21:02] and whosoever liveth and believeth me
[21:04] shall never die I believe that to be

[25:29] precious Mosley boys and all of them
[25:32] we've been together and so many my dear
[25:34] friends here in Phoenix that I love with
[25:36] all my heart
[25:37] and I think that morning in that Vision
[25:39] he said all that you ever loved
[25:43] and all that loves you God has given you
[25:48] at least someone you're repenting others
[25:50] seen
[25:52] down on the floor young lady crying
[25:55] thank you Lord
[25:56] let's just bow our heads a moment apart
[26:00] dear God thank you Jesus is that that
[26:04] little sheep that was left in Phoenix
[26:07] I don't know God you know
[26:10] but someday it will be
[26:13] the father there's no doubt is one thank
[26:16] you so I pray that you'll help her just
[26:18] now
[26:19] sweetly open up the gate
[26:22] say come child of mine
[26:25] Jesus come in from the tired weary Road

[26:36] it's my spirit that's speaking to you
[26:38] and bringing you into the fall now
[26:42] granted God

[26:46] crossroads of life

[26:54] on him that sent me has thy everlasting
[26:57] life granted your God to this young
[27:00] Christian
[27:01] see that will come to me I will in no
[27:04] wise cast out while Saints are standing
[27:07] over the young woman praying we remember
[27:09] even Paul who was stoned so bad that he
[27:12] was down
[27:13] his die and when the saints stood over
[27:15] and prayed life comes
[27:17] because in the bodies of those Saints
[27:20] was that quickening power
[27:23] Spirit of life back to San
[27:25] God it could certainly pray the prayer
[27:29] of death out all the or the filth out of
[27:32] the person by the prayer of faith to lie
[27:34] granted you're gone bless us now as we
[27:38] await wait upon the
