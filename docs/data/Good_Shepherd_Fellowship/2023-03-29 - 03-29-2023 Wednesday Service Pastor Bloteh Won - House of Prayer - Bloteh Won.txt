for helping me not to ruin it praise the Lord it's always a blessing when we can lean on you and then not make something ugly I want to read I want to read a Psalm let's let's read Psalm 118. let's read Psalm 118. I want to go in there in the direction tonight but I want to read Psalm 118. and what we are reading standing to read I will I will remind us again just before entering we have a sign there that we must join our cell phone off and I know uh you know the simplest way to justify it is that I use my my Bible on my cell phone but I will tell you that uh the technicians love us so much that they have the Bible on the computer so you don't need to turn your cell phone on just wait they will put the scripture up and then you will read because I've seen it in few different times you know it's it's like somebody's reading on their phone and they are doing something completely different you know they are doing something completely different I mean you are in service the preacher is preaching and then you're on Facebook you know doing something completely different and we will we will also encourage the deacons if a stranger comes in and they are using their phone we give them a Bible we have many feedback there not many we have few back there so we will we will try to to uh we try to take that as a practice I know some some people like to copy the the messages you know that is used anything that is projecting you is already back there you have a right to give your email address to any of the Saints back there and say send me the notes you have a right to it it's not the moment is least from my iPad back there or any preacher is in public domain you have a right away if you want if you want the notes from every service just give them your email you have a right to it praise the Lord so if you didn't know that is good news so let's just read Psalm chapter 118 let's read from verse 24 Psalm 118 verse 24 something caught my mind now remember this coming Sunday uh will be Palm Sunday it will be the you know uh the the religious world will be celebrating Palm Sunday the the triumphant entry of Jesus into Jerusalem so I want to get around few prophecy of that I want to start from tonight in in the on Sunday we will get through there but for us at Church Sunday will be a convenience Sunday praise the Lord so don't forget that we will we will place that also in the hands of the Lord that will come together and have the and have the Lord's Supper in in a second service so uh pray for me and as I pray for you praise the Lord so but why studying there there was something that caught my attention and it came it came very strong to my attention tonight so I decided to get away from what I wanted to talk about and then and then just just Dash in him so uh uh that's what is going to happen Psalm chapter 118 let's read verse 24. Psalm chapter 118 let's read from verse 24 we could go back we could go back and you read but that you would grab the picture because there is a lot there is a lot of Prophecy in here about the Lord Jesus and there's a prophecy here that that pertain to exactly what was happening so uh verse 24 we will read praise the Lord Hallelujah praise the Lord amen I'm sure I'm not I'm not preaching uh online to an empty church so I can get some response amen amen praise the Lord so verse 24 this is the dead which the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it safe now I'll be searched thee O Lord O Lord I'll be searched send now Prosperity now remember thou for that verse we have just read remember it in the in the in the entrance of Jesus when they say hosanna Hosanna this was the verse they were cutting because that's what Hosanna means save us praise the Lord that's what Hosanna means save us oh Lord save us Hosanna Blessed Be The Rock we are saying save us all rock all blessed Rock or thou are the rock that has saved us praise the Lord amen now you will see how it will come out beautiful save us now I'll be searched oh Lord oh Lord I be searched the same now Prosperity bless it be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord God is the Lord which have show us light bound the sacrifice we've called even unto the homes of the altar thou are my God I will praise thee thou are my God I will exalt thee the Lord bless you you may have your seat so we will we will use that and uh and and let's go to to uh uh let's go to Luke let's go to see Luke chapter 19. let's go to sin Luke Chapter 19. I will I will get back on these scriptures on Sunday but I just I just want you to be able to get the picture here for tonight and then I will go in the direction where I want to go tonight praise the Lord see Luke chapter 19. Hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen okay it's in Luke Chapter 19. Let's uh let's read from let's read from verse 37. I just want to show you a senior that you will be able to grab the picture so when we get back to you on Sunday you will know exactly where we are and when he was come night even now at The Descent of Mount Olive the whole multitude of the disciples begin to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they have seen same blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him Master rebuke thy disciples now that's that's word the that's word the catch is praise the Lord why did they say rebuke that disciple because by them referring to disarm by them repeating this Psalm blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the Lord you remember when Jesus asked him and says what did David said my lord said unto my Lord they could not answer that question because it points directly to the Messiah praise the Lord so we will get into more of the history but where the cash is there is the other by the people shouting blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord and have the the Pharisees on a conviction that they are proclaiming him to be the Messiah and then also it was putting them in challenge with the Romans they are they are declaring that he is a king praise the Lord so they are they started saying uh Master tell your disciples to stop that because they never wanted to get now you have to grab the picture in your mind these people were on the on the on the room at the time pilate was the governor there he was just a young man that came and took over Jerusalem to stop all the rioting and so whenever the Jews got together like this Whenever there was a shouting the Romans always came around because they wanted to make sure there was no riot there was nothing that would disturb the peace so definitely with the people having palm branches in their hands and and you know shouting and you know and celebrating the Romans will be around to find out what is happening and yes the people singing in multitude Blessed Be Our King blessed is the one that cometh in the name of the Lord praise the Lord right there uh the Pharisees are in trouble because they know exactly that the the the the governor is going to call them what is this am I hearing praise the Lord amen so this is can you can you quiet the people can you quiet the people Masters rebuked their disciples and he answered and said unto them I tell you that if these should hold their peace the stone who immediately cry out amen so in another sense Jesus is identifying himself with that scripture he's identifying himself with that entry this is one of the places where publicly he's Desiring that yes I'm I mean I I am the one that cometh in the name of the Lord praise the Lord but we will go more into death on Sunday now what caught my attention here is that I wanted to like I said I wanted to give some uh Sila moment you know like David said Sila in the psalm I wanted to give some sillac movement in uh in the message we were playing and and this caught my attention so let's let's take this one from uh who is this make you see the brother brand name says this year he said God came down and be and become flesh and die their death in Christ so that he will clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship so God came down he took on flesh and die the death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship God law of Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time fall was for Fellowship God God the word alone with cherubins and and notice now he made man and man fell so he came down and redeemed them because God loved to be worshiped the very word god means object of worship now so brother Branham is saying here that one of the reason why uh uh uh uh all the shadows in in Leviticus speaks about the sacrifice you know who are there in in Leviticus you know if a man was to touch a dead he must say he must he must he must stay himself away it was either it was either seven days or he can only come up in the evening time you know and all of those things so all of those things was pointing to this very warmthank praise the Lord which is the the sacrifice of our Lord God taking on flesh and uh taking the death on our behalf but brother Branham is saying here is there the reason why he did that is for him to clean the church now what caught my attention is that if you go in the scripture at the beginning of Jesus ministry I never saw this until I started studying this it was it caught my attention I've preached on this before I never thought the reason why I didn't see it because I took it all to be the sin in Saint John Chapter 2 Jesus clean the temple he whipped the people off praise the Lord and he says my father house is the House of Prayer but you will realize that after this triumphing he went straight to the temple and he did it a second time praise the Lord and he did it the second time let's look at the first one Saint John chapter 2. praise the Lord but Branham says God came down and become flesh and died to death in Christ so that he could clean the church in order to get into it for Fellowship so just just see they are just at the beginning of his ministry see John Chapter 2 will start from the third day there was a marriage in Canada so so so there he went to their wedding and after that verse 11 which says this this beginning the miracle the Miracles Jesus did so so that was at the beginning of his ministry but then you will see here verse 12 you read that this is after a couple days Jesus has gone with his Brethren and this and and verse 13 will now bring us to the scene the Bible says and the Jewish Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold houses and ships and Dove and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scotch of small Court he drove them out of the Temple and uh and the Chiefs and the oxen and and and pour out the the changes money and overthrew the temple and said unto them that yeah overthrew the table sorry and said unto them that Soul doves take these things hints now I'll grab your attention there before we go further and dogs were were for the poor people those that could not afford to get a lamb praise the Lord you have to remember that in Luke Jesus at at his uh his dedication it was those that they brought amen amen so so reading this what caught my attention down there here you see he's he's whipping the people out the sheeps and The Oxen or running out of the place he's turning the table off and he comes here to meet these doors realizing that this was the same thing that was given for me this this this is for the least fault in it so then he spoke to them praise the Lord take these hands make now at my father house and House of merchandise then the Bible said this is the part that I love that I've preached on many times I love it the disciples remember just by seeing him doing that the law brought to their mind a scripture what David said in the psalm the Zeal of the house has eaten me up God quickened it to their heart the Bible says that disciple remember praise the Lord there it is written the Zeal of that house has eaten up praise the Lord now this is at the beginning of his ministry when you go at the end of his ministry he he never told them says my father house he's my house praise the Lord no so yeah brother Branham is making us to see here in in in in this message that's the reason why God took on flesh was to clean the temple clean his house clean the church clean the provided place of worship because he wanted to have fellowship with us what is the purpose of the preaching of the word it's a watching for what to please us to one purpose the word has only one purpose is to clean us are we together that's the reason why we cannot stay under the Fellowship of the word and still get a grip to our habits praise the Lord the word has the the the uh is it's a very powerful detergent to break any habits just like Isaiah says Lord your sin may be read as Khalid but the word can make it what I snow are we together now see your brother bran will take this awesome in a message what it takes to overcome all unbelief he will go this way and says I was looking at many of these tonight but I just choose this tool just uh for this Wednesday night he says first is Apostle Prophet teacher evangelist Pastor those five god-giving gifts in the church so each of you people who has a Godly pastor has a gift from God in your church as Shepherd pastor means as Shepherd to watch over the floor to teach them the word of God then these other nine different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean praise the Lord Amen to keep the church clean now so that's what the gifts are giving for that's what again I'm talking here now he's talking about the the noun spiritual gift is missing that also with the fight for Ministry the five for Ministry cleans the church by the preaching of the word whether it's a teacher that comes in and and positionally placed Us in the word in the message when we find our position we knows how to overcome the devil amen the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee comes around and then he preached and then he he revealed he calls sins and he you know he speaks about things the only reason why God is giving us that gift is to keep his church clean now so brother Branham yet as he talks there let's let's read this let's read this uh or together finish he talks about that then these are the nine different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean like the ananias and and Safari and so forth the spirit of God raised up and call somebody out to tell them they are living wrong and rebuke their sin openly and and that's what the holy spirit is in the church form to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord praise the Lord amen now uh David was there no uh uh and saw because of his Disobedience he has caught a wrong Spirit an evil spirit has got on him because of his disobedience Barbarian said in rejected King he says because we are we we we are I gave in love nature when we are born again when we are born again we give our hearts to the Lord God placed Allah nature on us for us to be led he says if we refuse to be led by the spirit and not a spirit would lead us he says that is exactly what happened to Saul because he refused to follow the leadership of of Samia he got a wrong spirit and when that wrong Spirit was tormenting him what was cleansing him David music they will come and play the music now you see why brother Branham who says come to church 10 minutes before time sit under the music come to church tell the man he said under the music later just set your mind ready for worship they just calm you down ready for Fellowship because that is what that gift is therefore every gift is to cleanse the church are we together amen now so brother Branham talks about the five foot Ministry we know the position of the fight for Ministry at the end of the word but then he also talks about the nice spiritual gift praise the Lord amen those gifts are for the body but you see that the danger that happened over the years with the church is the other we care so anxious for the manifestation of the supernatural that we try to manufacture it praise the Lord the gifts are there all we need to do is just create the right atmosphere praise the Lord the gifts are there you see the uh we start to pray then and then as soon as an atmosphere come on the people you see you see uh you hear other people being very loud you know and and they are saying things out that can burst into a prophecy but you don't have to manufacture it or else you could get a wrong spirit you don't have to manufacture it because the thing there is there that it is God that is working through every gift of the body praise the Lord it is God that is working through every gift of the body so I mean I was just telling on this thing trying to look into this triumphant entry and then uh uh this thing just break to my mind to see that Jesus at the beginning of his ministry he went cleaning the temple praise the Lord and before he will pay the ultimate price before he would give the sacrifice that will really bring their cleansing to bring man into fellowship with God he went back to the temple again praise the Lord and he had to clean it are we together we cannot get into Fellowship I mean right from the beginning right there in Eden when Adam felt he talked to himself a fake leaf the effect Leaf is is the it's a kind of is the best religion that we can produce a faith live is man's man's religion our best ideas when we bring our ideas uh uh in in approaching God praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen are we together I mean uh uh there is there is uh we we can we can bring our calculation we can reason you know what let's do it this way let's do it that way you can never have a better idea brother Branham shared in the church age book he said in every age he says both the clergy and the elitists go astray from God and that's the reason why God has to send a messenger in every age to bring the people back to the word our best ideas will just take us away from God except we are doing a bad the word it has to be by the word God's desire for Fellowship his Desiring Fellowship more than we desire Fellowship amen and the way that he can the way that he will be able to achieve it for us to have fellowship with God young people it's not just the service on Wednesday that are coming to church on Sunday no it's just that intimate relationship it is is that joy of the Lord in your heart the way that God speaks to you the way he leads you the way you trust him the way you you stand upon his word and God can only achieve that when he cleans us we will not come toward the fullness of Fellowship when we are stay still filled in in our own mess whatever mess we have whatever mess we are creating for ourselves whatever mess we have in comfort in you will never attain fellowship with God if Jesus did that in his effluent Ministry from the beginning of his ministry and at the end showing the Alpha and Omega principle he went right into the temple and just like how he did it you know I was I was reading uh some cold blood Brown was talking about how you know uh uh uh the Bible talks about Jesus and and the tenderness of the Lord you know the kindness the the Lord that is full of compassion but bear band was described describing how when he came down there to the temple the one that was at uh the wedding that was so quiet nobody even knew he was there he turned the water to wine was not looking for no recognition praise the Lord but when it got down to cleaning the temple when it got down to cleaning the temple it was it was a kind of a different action or different character that the disciples were seeing praise the Lord something that was never done praise the Lord he went right in there took a calling and I mean he was just he was just whipping away whatever he sees turning the tables upside down having the sheeps and the ox in everything to get out of out of the temple area praise the Lord and that is the very same things that he he do to you and myself amen he will use the preaching of the word to get us clean amen amen sometimes he will use triers to get us claims especially when he's trying to to get your attention with the word and you are still playing stubborn praise the Lord it was God that was going Adam Adam where are you it was God that made the provision of the Sheep's King because he wanted to get his son back into Fellowship and God can only enjoy Fellowship when the temple is clean amen we will only be able to enjoy fellowship with the Revere word when our Temple is clinched then the word becomes sweeter on I mean you would just read the word you will have the hair knowledge of the word but you will not enjoy the fellowship that I mean the joy the fellowship that you should be able to have when you when you find that word empowering you praise the Lord you just think about it let me in there get back to brother team say when he preach on Sunday you think about it that God rest up something for the purpose amen and he I mean he was born a Nazareth to destroy the Philistine and here is he there uh uh uh uh taking a joy Bond of an ox and he's killing about 300 men praise the Lord and after throwing his hands in in all of this he's tired that God would dig a well in a dry bone to be able to quench his tests he said Lord after you have given me the strength to kill this man where I die of tests and the Bible says the spirit of the Lord created a hollow now only a in the Boom praise the Lord that's when the joy of the Lord is your strength when you can see God coming in a supernatural way praise the Lord putting water in the hollow of your bones to be able to quench your text something killed a lion and he gonna win over there to the Philistines in order they had forgot about it I think that was when he took the Gate of the city on his shoulder when he brought it up the hill then throw it down he was so tired and hungry but the very lion that he killed he was able to eat honey praise the Lord Brother Brad I'm locking down to uh uh uh uh our our tough trious and and stubborn areas in our lives the prayer of God says if you can kill that you will eat honey out of it [Music] praise the Lord because after you realize that God has delivered you from this habit or God has delivered you from a certain behavior when it comes around you will just pray so Lord because you know that it was God and Only God Alone so you see we can we we we only be able to enjoy The Fellowship of the world I mean a preacher would not have to beg you for amen he will be so fired up you will just be pulling the word out of the preacher before it comes from out of his mouth he's already in your mind I knew exactly that's why you were going to say good brother but I'm telling you I I mean I'm just being honest to you I really never saw this it just popped out of the scripture I said wow let me let me read this again because the setting is not the same join account is the beginning of his ministry and look at count years is the end of his ministry it's not the same one he says my father house is a house of prayer at the end of the his ministry he says my house will be called the House of Prayer praise the Lord amen so just that yes that yes to give us a picture of how much he want his church to be claimed how much he want our lives to be clean how much he want our homes to be clean that's what brings the Angels around praise the Lord that's what bring the gifts in the church we can have the gifts when we all mess up in our mind when we are doing things that we're not supposed to do then we said there is no gift where will the gift come from do we want people just anointed on their flesh well brother I'm seeing them one speaking in tongues one interpret interpreting an honor Vision he could see that one is living wrong the gifts are here the gifts are here okay the body brother Branham shared the scripture make us to know God placed those gifts in his body if this is the body of the Lord the gifts are here the people just have to be right we don't have to make it up praise the lord we don't have to fabricate prophecies and we flawed it will come right it would come by the words it won't be a premeditated gossip praise the Lord it will not be a premeditated gossip it would come flowing from the word the gifts will always be in part they will never be in fold until the church is clean until the people get away from Gossip from forces from all of those things it will just be in part dreams will be in part prophecy will be in part understanding will be in part for us to enjoy The Fellowship of the word feel the presence of the Angels we have to allow the world to cleanse us we have to take the word amen and all preacher used to say first John chapter one let's go there he says this is the Christian bar of soap he called it a Christian bottle soap thank you are we together okay first John chapter 1 verse 3 verse 6. and we find a place to close here and just go to the Lord this kind of caught my attention like I said I mean when the world pops out like that and I mean nothing else everything goes away from my head if I don't preach it I would just I would just I would just come and stand like a fool before you because I'm saying wow oh my God oh man I'm seeing this thing you mean he's big at the beginning of his ministry and also at the end of his ministry he went right out in there and says this house is the House of Prayer this house should be called The House of Prayer whether we are in a crime room whether we are in the bathroom whether we are in the office we must know that this house is the House of Prayer are we together if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lied and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin praise the Lord amen that's how we get our cleansing when we walk in the light how do we walk in the light by applying the word to our everydays but Brandon said is just like the old man going there up the hill uh the the fellow asks him how will you get there he says I have this lamb before me your word is alarm before me he says I have this lamb before me it will clear the path as I take one step to go that's how we apply the word what did the word says what did the scripture says about this what did the message what is the messenger said about this their desire that habit of going back to the word you are in Fellowship you are walking in the light as he is in the light you are having that confidence that you are not just guessing your choices you are not guessing your choices but you are bringing it back to the word you are not doing things because you want you are yeah and make me feel good praise the Lord are you conscious what a God is feeling good about it we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another the blood cleans us but Branham says is uh is constant atuming he says his constant atonement is almost like when God Rob Adam and Eve in the sh in in the bloody skin as they were walking he says the blood was dropping so as we walk in the light as you apply the word you're having access to the blood amen as we walk in the light it's not uh it's not this uh uh uh uh you know uh how what we would say is a Pentecostal gibberish the blood of Jesus I wash myself in the blood of Jesus one by your very action you are defying the word we just have the blood of Jesus on our left the blood of Jesus I wash my house in the blood of Jesus Christ when you have all sorts of filthy things all over your house you're using another Blood not this word not this Blood not this bleeding word it is not just a saying it's not a slogan you we can only have access to the blood when we walk in the light if the if the chemical blood of Jesus Christ was here for you in a bottle for you to drink it you get sick why because the life left that blood praise the Lord the life left that blood it came back on the days of Pentecost so the life is in the word applying the word to our sickness you are applying the blood applying the word to our mistakes you are applying the blood applying the word to our sin you are applying the blood so we have a constant atuming praise the Lord when the devil brings a thought to your mind and you know that it's not a good thought you can get access to that blood immediately Why by casting it out of your mind Satan I rebuke you in Jesus name Lord cleansed my mind from that filter you have an access to the blood are we together now he goes on he says if we say verse 8 that we have no sin we deceive ourself the truth is not in us but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sin and to do what cleanse cleanse they'll find in the least opportunity to make use of the blood of Jesus Christ finding the least opportunity that you have when you are wrong right there I'm sorry I'm wrong forgive me but what we try to do is that we try to find a way to justify it we Justified and and then and what we're doing is that we're cooking condemnation in our heart finding a way to make ourselves stubborn to go back and do it again when we can find a quick asset right there and then I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not supposed to do that I'm very sorry please forgive me right out of her Earnest heart when you do an earnestly and write you give yourself access to the blood and I will tell you you know what it is you get a good feeling praise the Lord when you don't do it right also you don't get a good feeling because you cannot say you are sorry then you come back again and start defending yourself [Music] and arguing about it praise the Lord someone says I'm sorry he said no you are not sorry I know you are not sorry I say I'm very sorry no no you are not sorry you are not sorry praise the Lord you know what is happening there is that you are you are you are having access to the blood and the next person is refusing the blood praise the Lord because they want to take up their issue they want to make it an issue it's a constant atomic we are rap in the same bleeding skin that Adam and Eve when God called every son he wrapped Us in that bleeding skin and as we are walking the blood is dropping and every time it drops it's making a tumoring for us praise the Lord amen every time you drop it making a stomach for us and it's speaking better things before the father is speaking better things that's the reason why when we come approaching God on the business of his word go hear that language of his word more than our vocabulary and verb and our verb and all of that praise the Lord but that's where my my thought was tonight the House of Prayer amen he says this house will be called The House of Prayer and that should be your house in my house and this house this body we can only have enjoyed the fellowship one with another when we are cleanse praise the Lord when we are allowing the word to cleanse us when we are allowing the gifts to cleanse us meditation on on on on on good music meditating on the words getting into Fellowship fellowshipping with the words that you are singing you are fellowshipping with the words that you are singing you are not just singing it but you are fellowshipping with the words that you are singing Lord I bless your name I bless your name I mean I bless your name praise the Lord there you are in fellowship with the Lord amen we were here we would get we would get more into that on on Sunday but I just wanted to pick up these this this uh this place tonight and just and just show you you know uh uh this beautiful thing especially when the prophet is saying here you know that God came down and became flesh and died the death in Christ so that he can he could clean the church in order to get into it praise the Lord for Fellowship praise the Lord amen let me tell you something also that I look at uh Jesus said I'll be in my church and the gifts of hell shall not Prevail against it praise the Lord is the church on the offense or on the defense praise the Lord where is the church the church is on the offense praise the Lord the church is on the offense when God told Joshua he says I have given you the land praise the Lord all they needed to go on their offense and take it but we live our life on the defense all this the devil is attacking me it's because you're supposed to be on the offense right oh the devil all the the devil is that he's supposed to be on the offense when there are more grounds for us to capture there are a lot of things in the in the word of God in in in in the provision of God to bring us joy and gladness we're trying to protect this little ground that we have which is supposed to be going out there and claiming more territory praise the Lord and helping your brothers and your sister to get their territory encouraging one another and praying for one another musicians come tonight let's just take this little time in and speak to the Lord this is your
