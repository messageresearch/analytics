[2:52] tonight they were just gonna take a few
[2:53] minutes here just relax enjoy the Lord
[2:56] how many I hope you're not in a hurry
[2:58] tonight amen hallelujah you know I just
[3:04] probably maybe two months ago I'd
[3:08] mentioned our vice president of finance
[3:11] his name is Jerry Pete's he's had a
[3:15] backache and thought maybe it was
[3:17] because he had been carrying his
[3:18] grandchild and and and then in August
[3:22] 29th he they did went in and had some
[3:27] very thorough testing and found out he
[3:29] had pancreatic cancer forth States and
[3:32] was already finding not only cancerous
[3:34] pancreas but they found it and his liver
[3:38] and in his lungs and so anyway he
[3:42] started going through the chemo and and
[3:45] then at the end of September I ended up
[3:47] having a stroke and he actually passed
[3:49] away here last Thursday so eight weeks
[3:55] to the day that he found out about it
[3:57] and he was gone and of course you know
[4:01] what I found out you know what the
[4:03] situation was I sent him a little letter
[4:05] because I could got his home email
[4:07] address there's home address and just
[4:10] had a real burden on my heart just to
[4:13] know where he was spiritually and to be
[4:14] able to and talk to him a little bit
[4:16] about salvation don't even know if he
[4:19] ever got the letter ever read the letter
[4:21] or anything never got a response back
[4:22] and I think by the time I got the letter
[4:25] there might have been just before he had
[4:26] a stroke and so we had the memorial day
[4:31] so the memorial service yesterday
[4:35] morning and so I had a chance to go over
[4:40] and and heard a little sermon from his
[4:43] pastor and it was wonderful it was just
[4:48] his pastors got both feet standing on
[4:53] the solid rock and I really appreciated
[4:55] that so I had a chance to talk to his
[4:57] pastor afterwards and I read this on the
[5:01] CaringBridge online you know where the
[5:04] daughter was kind of keeping everybody
[5:06] up to date as things were progressing
[5:08] along and I hadn't really gone through
[5:11] that until actually the evening before
[5:14] them a memorial service saw I was kind
[5:18] of getting caught up on things and so
[5:20] one of the things that was very
[5:22] outstanding is I went over and talked
[5:25] him at the little luncheon after the
[5:27] service and told them you know now that
[5:30] I had said Jerry a letter and I was good
[5:34] insert for a salvation and and so he had
[5:39] said that several people had had felt
[5:42] the same way and actually had talked to
[5:43] Jerry him and he said Jerry's kind of a
[5:47] quiet guy but
[5:49] but Jerry had received Christ as his
[5:53] personal Savior
[5:54] and they said that right towards the end
[5:59] that actually the very day that Jerry
[6:01] passed away
[6:02] pastor they asked him to come over and
[6:05] he was he was in the room and actually
[6:08] Jerry by that time he was in a coma and
[6:12] so when the pastor came in Jerry's wife
[6:18] Dawn just kind of said out loud Jerry
[6:21] says your pastors here to see you now
[6:24] here's a man who had been in a coma all
[6:26] sudden he opened up his eyes he and he
[6:29] said one thing he just smiled he said I
[6:32] made it and he said that was his last
[6:38] words I made it
[6:41] oh I just let that sink in saints of God
[6:45] oh I just love Jesus oh my I made it how
[6:52] did he yeah I was telling some of my
[6:54] staff about that a little I we have
[6:56] usually in afternoons and telling a
[6:59] story about how and how Jerry made it
[7:03] and
[7:04] oh my he's just so good Laura
[7:08] Oh father we're just so grateful to you

[7:28] his little sermon at he said so many
[7:30] times we like to we like to help God in

[25:27] bed beside it and so this woman her dad

[42:56] trust I want to I want to just go back
[43:01] to there tonight amen
[43:03] and let's let's look at let's look at I
[43:10] was looking at this Hebrew in Hebrew as
[43:15] as I was telling on base so I was just
[43:18] afraid of you if you can help us tonight
[43:21] in their support their their Hebrew
[43:25] definition that
[43:28] the word there sounds like I mean let's
[43:31] look at their together it's a word
[43:34] they're also there means trust any means
[43:38] to support confirmed be faithful to
[43:42] support and to uphold to nourish and as
[43:47] I was looking at the word this came
[43:51] interested interesting to me they also
[43:55] have a meaning of foster father or
[44:00] foster mother or nurse a pillow
[44:07] supporter of the door to be established
[44:11] be faithful to carry make friend to be
[44:15] caring by a nurse not as I was thinking
[44:19] about that I was in my mind I was I was
[44:23] saying most especially when I look at
[44:28] the word foster father foster mother
[44:34] what came to my mind and thinking about
[44:37] trust
[44:38] is you know taking a child or taking a
[44:46] parent at his net yaws directly to be
[44:51] able to trust him and and and then
[44:55] looking at this also to be care about a
[44:58] nurse you know those people in the
[45:02] hospital they are nice people many of
[45:04] them you know our visit to the hospital
[45:07] would be the first time we will ever
[45:09] meet them and to just see how you know
[45:15] when when we are in their situation we
[45:19] trust him with our life praise the Lord
[45:22] Amen the care that he gave to us and you
[45:27] know in all of that so I was just I was
[45:30] just thinking about their that's what i
[45:32] canta for projected this tonight but as
[45:37] we look at you know what we want to go
[45:39] into too
[45:40] that were trust like we we located you
[45:46] know it means to have confidence and
[45:48] that of confiding you know I wish of
[45:52] course I think that is one of the area
[45:55] word our agent I'm is you know is
[45:59] struggling with we are living in in a
[46:02] society where there is a lot of distrust
[46:04] and some of the distrust has come
[46:07] because we have we have wrong people you
[46:11] know I mean we have we have people doing
[46:14] the wrong things
[46:15] you know so it have created a level of
[46:19] distrust praise the Lord Amen and but as
[46:25] as we look at the subject tonight and
[46:30] looking at you know what we've been
[46:34] talking about Trust is it's mostly in a
[46:37] place word we want him to trust the Lord
[46:41] I was also looking at that word and it
[46:47] also means to be hopeful and and when I
[46:51] taught about it I said how many times
[46:53] you know I know there are places where
[46:57] Bob Arum talks about hope and and and
[47:00] sometimes we pick on those things and we
[47:03] kind of for capitalized it as any sense
[47:05] as if hope is a bad word hope is not a
[47:09] bad word praise the Lord amen
[47:14] hope is not about we're actually in in a
[47:17] way I would think about it and say it
[47:19] hope is the strength of faith amen so as
[47:26] I was telling this in and and I saw that
[47:28] the word trust also means to be hopeful
[47:33] and I went back and I started looking at
[47:36] some few things and and I realized that
[47:39] I says well Lord you you just have to
[47:41] help us praise the Lord
[47:44] well we want to look at this tonight and
[47:46] where I want to go with this trust
[47:48] tonight
[47:49] Trust is also a word that could mean
[47:53] to rest amen
[47:59] I want to look I trust tonight in the
[48:02] direction of resting
[48:08] praise the Lord amen
[48:14] let's let's look at this Solomon said
[48:16] and I was also going to like most of you
[48:20] most of us received through the text
[48:22] since the terrorists have a baby girl
[48:25] carrying faith that's her name so we
[48:28] have another faith amen and praise the
[48:32] Lord praise the Lord she's scaring faith
[48:36] a little bit of faith it means she's a
[48:40] little bit of faith amen praise the Lord
[48:45] let's look at Ecclesiastes chapter 11 we
[48:51] were there at the hospital in in you
[48:53] know from since Sunday I've been
[48:55] thinking about Solomon and I've been
[48:58] thinking about this you know having
[49:03] wisdom that we were talking about so I
[49:12] thought about this on my way to the
[49:15] hospital let's look at this together and
[49:19] there's verse clicks as a chapter five
[49:22] and there will be verse 11
[49:32] no no 11 chapter 11 verse 5
[49:46] I was looking at something in Chapter
[49:49] five also so Solomon says day she says
[49:56] as doubt knoweth net what is the weight
[50:02] of the spirit praise the Lord
[50:05] remember Jesus said the same thing to
[50:07] Nicodemus you cannot know the weight of
[50:10] the Spirit amen
[50:12] for Jesus he types it with the wane but
[50:16] now Solomon is going to bring it in
[50:18] another way he says as there are nowhere
[50:21] near the way of the spirit known how the
[50:25] bones do grow in the warm of her that is
[50:30] with child
[50:32] even so Dino with net the works of God
[50:37] who maketh all praise the Lord it just
[50:44] makes you to pause and think about it
[50:51] praise the Lord I mean to realize that
[50:58] everything our body this body would need
[51:02] to grow up from a child to the years in
[51:07] the age that the Lord will allot us God
[51:11] supply everything praise the Lord Amen
[51:20] that's a mighty God
[51:24] that's a God that we can trust praise
[51:30] the Lord he says that as we don't know
[51:34] the weight of the Spirit you can apply
[51:38] that to your spiritual life as much as
[51:41] thinking about your natural life
[51:45] everything that a little bit of faith
[51:51] will needs sharing faith who needs to be
[51:56] a girl and be a mother
[51:58] if Jesus story
[52:00] the Lord supplies everything praise the
[52:04] Lord
[52:04] as long as the parents keep her in a
[52:07] good environment and give her the
[52:09] rightful she will grow and all of those
[52:11] things will develop praise the Lord
[52:16] so as we want to look at this word
[52:18] tonight or a look at where we want to go
[52:21] tonight I came across this and then it
[52:27] makes me to start to think about Abraham
[52:32] and that's why we read Genesis chapter
[52:35] 17
[52:37] remember God there with Abraham in
[52:40] different ways brother Samuel brought it
[52:43] out beautiful the other night our
[52:45] brother from Uganda and it was it was in
[52:48] different ways that God did with him he
[52:51] meant go there with our father Abraham
[52:53] true visions and I mean in in different
[52:55] manifestation and year was one of
[53:00] another manifestation where God appeared
[53:04] to Abraham and and this time like like
[53:09] the scripture says and you know there
[53:11] are balances and God appeared to him as
[53:14] the breast of one praise the Lord
[53:19] God now you have to realize that Abraham
[53:24] God called him and God gave him a
[53:26] promise to be the father of nation and
[53:29] he been trust in the Lord praise the
[53:32] Lord he heard the voice of God he
[53:35] stepped out separated himself from his
[53:38] father house from his kindred from the
[53:40] land and he took him to a lan was seated
[53:43] and maker was God who better and maker
[53:47] was God and I see I see as he got into
[53:50] the journey we know there was different
[53:52] thing that happened he had he is cursing
[53:54] lot there and and and and down the road
[53:57] just like we saw it a little bit on
[54:00] Sunday taking you know those different
[54:03] man of the scripture Abraham you know
[54:07] brought Ishmael but yet that was not the
[54:11] promise that God gave him praise the
[54:13] Lord and he got back again he he kept
[54:16] trust in the Lord for the promise that
[54:18] God gave him in Genesis chapter 15
[54:22] Abraham got to God and he got down and
[54:25] said Lord God you know you have been so
[54:28] good to me
[54:29] you have blessed me you have I mean you
[54:32] have been showing yourself to me and he
[54:34] and he's going to give God a suggestion
[54:37] now he says this board Ellie is I was
[54:40] born right in my house
[54:42] I had him amen when you asked me law I
[54:48] mean he grew in my house and and he's
[54:51] he's just like a child to me Lord I can
[54:56] take him to be the promised son that you
[54:59] have promised me
[55:00] God said no praise the Lord you have to
[55:05] remember that no is also an arm's answer
[55:07] I mean we don't like no but no it's also
[55:11] an answer God said no the promise will
[55:18] come from you praise the Lord
[55:22] amen and then because of that go how to
[55:28] take Abraham to another experience that
[55:31] was worth he had a sacrifice and and you
[55:34] know and and a deep sleep came upon him
[55:37] and all of those things happen God was
[55:39] to proving to Abraham that I'm going to
[55:42] keep my word and another way to say
[55:46] trust me I mean what I say and I'm going
[55:52] to do it now we travel from Genesis
[55:56] chapter 15 and in onward and after that
[56:00] Abraham grew courage you know and God
[56:03] visited him again in the form of
[56:05] maturity and then you know when and he
[56:08] had a communion with God I mean he
[56:10] stepped into another relationship with
[56:14] the Lord praise the Lord
[56:17] well now
[56:19] right over here in in chapter 17
[56:23] Abraham is 19 and 9 years old
[56:27] praise the Lord God up here on to him
[56:32] and God is going to bring him into into
[56:38] a a more deeper relationship of trust I
[56:43] mean where trust will get to the level
[56:46] to become rest amen
[56:52] sometimes sometimes we trust and yet we
[56:59] keep looking over our shoulder praise
[57:05] the Lord Amen now you think about it
[57:08] think about it how trust here in the
[57:12] Hebrew takes the word of a foster father
[57:16] or a foster mother you think about it
[57:20] it's a level of relationship and a very
[57:26] beginning of the level of relationship
[57:29] even if the the the the the the child is
[57:33] a baby that child is very innocent so
[57:38] you will realize that the left the the
[57:41] the the place of trust will not be from
[57:45] the child
[57:46] it will now be from the from the mother
[57:48] or the father how would it be there will
[57:54] be a you know himalay they will be
[57:57] thinking in a mire okay yeah us but I
[57:59] wonder when he grew grow up and know
[58:02] that I'm not the father come on he's
[58:05] going to change
[58:06] I wanna she's going to change now
[58:11] because the the child is a little baby a
[58:16] child has not come to consciousness yet
[58:18] so you will realize that morals of the
[58:23] the error of trust will be on the
[58:25] pairing praise the Lord
[58:31] oh and our parent would be I mean they
[58:34] would be selling their trust in every
[58:36] way I mean they take them to the packing
[58:40] and I mean be doing everything that the
[58:45] little baby who Bobby a trust praise the
[58:50] Lord
[58:51] amen we're living in a society just like
[58:55] I said you know a society that has there
[59:00] has no no value for trust I mean the
[59:06] society will teach that little child I
[59:09] soon I did get to talking and we get to
[59:13] understanding the society would teach
[59:15] them that that's your foster father then
[59:19] the role turns around praise the Lord
[59:25] Amen as as soon as their child comes to
[59:31] consciousness that this is your foster
[59:34] father or your foster mother then the
[59:36] road change around then they start
[59:40] interpreting everything that the
[59:44] happines glory be to God amen but abarim
[59:52] taught us cry I mean who is this machee
[59:56] see that we bypass our - you're funny
[59:58] amen
[1:00:01] so we have to be born again so what
[1:00:07] happened is that God that predestinated
[1:00:11] us the new us from the beginning as his
[1:00:15] son and his daughter
[1:00:16] God is arrest tracer Lord he's at rest
[1:00:23] he has already there with his level of
[1:00:25] trust so he's at rest
[1:00:29] now we come true the word and assisting
[1:00:33] we come true our parents we come true
[1:00:36] the church and all of that and we give
[1:00:40] our life to God and we are born again
[1:00:42] now we come to
[1:00:44] cautiousness amen now so it's we now
[1:00:52] that's learning to trust God and now we
[1:00:57] are interpreting everything that
[1:00:59] happened can we ask for this and it does
[1:01:04] not happen can i really trust him is God
[1:01:08] really my father praise the Lord
[1:01:15] are we together amen so you see that is
[1:01:22] the reason why he gives us the Holy
[1:01:25] Ghost to bring our trust to a resting
[1:01:31] place
[1:01:34] praise the Lord amen to bring our trust
[1:01:39] you think about father Abraham right
[1:01:42] from the beginning I mean that he was he
[1:01:44] was right there he was sure that he
[1:01:46] heard a voice I say son
[1:01:48] you know make me the father of nation he
[1:01:50] was very sure convinced in his heart but
[1:01:53] as thing starts happening and he guy
[1:01:56] comes in the picture and Ishmael comes
[1:01:58] in the picture and different things
[1:02:02] start happening he's looking over his
[1:02:06] shoulder all the time praise the Lord
[1:02:11] it's not real that he don't he don't
[1:02:13] trust God when you see trust is just
[1:02:19] just like I said here and that was the
[1:02:22] thing that kind of blessed me with this
[1:02:25] our level of trust it's just not a blind
[1:02:30] thing it's a relationship it grows as we
[1:02:37] fellowship amen
[1:02:40] as we read God's Word as we stand in his
[1:02:43] presence and he takes us through trials
[1:02:46] and we come out of faith and realizing
[1:02:49] that he stayed there we grow in our
[1:02:52] trust
[1:02:59] praise the Lord
[1:03:01] just like how the relationship of a
[1:03:06] foster parent and a foster child grows
[1:03:09] and become strong just like how the
[1:03:13] relationship of a nurse in a patient
[1:03:16] because that's one of that's one of the
[1:03:19] the the the definition you a nurse
[1:03:21] I mean so we care about a nurse you are
[1:03:27] away from home you are in the hospital
[1:03:31] you have that gown on you you don't know
[1:03:35] this nurse from Norway
[1:03:37] she's now your auntie she's not your
[1:03:41] sister she don't go to your church want
[1:03:46] to be nice for us to acts the ones we
[1:03:49] know to be our nurse I mean gets to the
[1:03:56] hospital in a register can I have sister
[1:03:58] Alice to be my nurse wouldn't that
[1:04:03] wouldn't it be a nice thing praise the
[1:04:06] Lord
[1:04:07] but yeah yeah you're right in there than
[1:04:10] denies that the nurse comes in and says
[1:04:12] good morning can you tell me your name
[1:04:15] never meet her from anywhere she asking
[1:04:17] me for my name your date of birth you
[1:04:21] got to trust her with all of those
[1:04:23] information praise the Lord and in but
[1:04:31] right from there she first tell you her
[1:04:35] name she calls her name I would be your
[1:04:40] nurse and she actually what is starting
[1:04:43] right being relationship relationship
[1:04:49] starts right there
[1:04:51] even if she's the meanest woman at that
[1:04:55] time she try to bring all the smile that
[1:04:59] is in her praise the Lord because she
[1:05:04] want you to trust her
[1:05:10] or maybe it's a man he want you to trust
[1:05:14] him amen so he's gonna be nice is there
[1:05:18] anything I can bring for you do you want
[1:05:21] water are you okay
[1:05:26] relationship praise the Lord it starts
[1:05:33] to be huh
[1:05:34] and that's how Trust is birth I mean
[1:05:42] trust don't have an ID card I mean a
[1:05:45] tyke
[1:05:45] as soon as sure obvious is trust no
[1:05:51] trust is birth from relationship are we
[1:06:00] together its birth from relationship and
[1:06:06] sometimes in strange it's sometimes it
[1:06:11] takes strange situation
[1:06:15] praise the Lord
[1:06:18] it takes in most cases it takes
[1:06:22] unexpected situation well the nurse
[1:06:27] comes in and he he tells you his name or
[1:06:30] her name and asks for your name you give
[1:06:33] all your information you do everything
[1:06:35] and and and and and you think about it 3
[1:06:38] a.m. in the morning you are sleeping and
[1:06:40] a nurse comes in the room you don't know
[1:06:44] him so now you get a sense of that
[1:06:48] shadow you wake up your eyes why are you
[1:06:52] looking around because Trust has not
[1:06:55] built yet Trust is not enough for you to
[1:06:58] just sleep and snow praise the Lord
[1:07:06] oh no I'm I'm your nurse' I just I'm
[1:07:10] just checking on you I'm supposed to
[1:07:11] take your temperature and everything you
[1:07:14] know even though you're not happy that
[1:07:16] your sleep was disturbed but yet you
[1:07:20] know that the nurse is there
[1:07:22] for your well-being you can be able to
[1:07:24] compromise a little bit you don't get
[1:07:26] angry you know he says why do you woke
[1:07:29] me up for praise the Lord and you were
[1:07:33] scared a nurse and you know the
[1:07:35] relationship would not go well so what
[1:07:41] it is it's building its building
[1:07:53] look at this together we were locating
[1:07:58] the message laying out on to your own
[1:08:00] understanding brother branham said here
[1:08:08] just like a baby now this was the reason
[1:08:12] why I turned to that El Shaddai
[1:08:15] Scripture
[1:08:16] just like a baby you take a little baby
[1:08:20] and let him be born
[1:08:23] let him be born and let him once lean
[1:08:29] upon his mother bosom now you have to
[1:08:35] know a lane is also another definition
[1:08:39] of trust I mean that's the reason why I
[1:08:47] mean you sit in on the planing and and
[1:08:50] someone starts sleeping and start
[1:08:52] getting close to you you know it's some
[1:08:59] uncomfortable thing you are checking
[1:09:02] yourself away but if it's if they relate
[1:09:06] if his relatives
[1:09:08] just pull your hair down sleep what are
[1:09:12] you afraid of you won't do that to
[1:09:14] stranger praise the Lord
[1:09:24] praise the Lord you know like I said
[1:09:28] before when when you start having the
[1:09:31] services going live he makes you not to
[1:09:33] be yourself I would have said something
[1:09:34] but let me continue tonight love the
[1:09:44] Lord tonight amen
[1:09:49] just like a little baby
[1:09:51] let him be born and let him once lean

[1:14:15] nature has provided a way for a baby to
[1:14:19] know his mother from where it is born
[1:14:24] from how much more has he a son of God

[1:14:37] to know his mama he knows because he was
[1:14:42] born of the word praise the Lord is it
[1:14:51] is done that strange there's some times
[1:14:55] when we go true I mean difficult things
[1:14:59] what is sickness and disappointment and
[1:15:02] and in different things the very thing
[1:15:06] that bring us back into contact with God
[1:15:09] is his word
[1:15:12] praise the Lord just pick up the Bible
[1:15:15] and start reading and I just like the
[1:15:21] way God would do it in some of the more
[1:15:25] awkward situation I mean disappointed in
[1:15:29] and feeling so bad like rejected by
[1:15:32] everyone
[1:15:33] you pick up the Bible and go we'll just
[1:15:36] make a verse come to light I mean in the
[1:15:41] worst bachelor distinct God will make a
[1:15:45] word come to light that's truth then
[1:15:59] pretty soon you start feeling a shame of
[1:16:01] yourself then you start repenting praise
[1:16:09] the Lord Amen in many times he Mele it
[1:16:16] looks like and and sometimes we say like
[1:16:18] that but it's wrong it looks like well
[1:16:22] you got to go and start from zero to
[1:16:23] gain know if you realize your trust just
[1:16:29] pick up from just where you stopped and
[1:16:31] you move on praise the Lord it's not
[1:16:37] Nicodemo teaching where you got to go
[1:16:39] back to the womb and be born again and
[1:16:42] sometimes people says well you got to
[1:16:45] start all over again you got no praise
[1:16:54] the Lord
[1:16:58] well actually happiness dead you have I
[1:17:03] mean you have got right in in a way you
[1:17:07] have got in God's Way and now you have
[1:17:11] to back up when you surrounded and he
[1:17:12] comes and continue from where he stopped
[1:17:14] and take you on he knows because he was
[1:17:19] born of the word and he understand the
[1:17:22] word put him in a strange place
[1:17:25] he's certainly out of place he would get
[1:17:30] out as quick as he is a strange place is
[1:17:34] now only a denomination Church strange
[1:17:36] places in Our Lives strange places in
[1:17:40] things that we do things that we allow
[1:17:46] because it is not of the word you
[1:17:53] remember like we read on on Sunday
[1:17:56] Jesus toes right there in us in John
[1:18:01] chapter eight he says there is no place
[1:18:05] you know sitting don't have no place and
[1:18:09] like I've always said that's the reason
[1:18:13] why God trusts us because he gave each
[1:18:18] of his sons and his daughter a portion
[1:18:20] of himself amen and it's that little C
[1:18:25] word brother Branham says just like a
[1:18:27] bottom it's that little C word well you
[1:18:35] see you didn't you didn't pay for it you
[1:18:39] didn't put it there you can take it from
[1:18:41] there
[1:18:42] amen it was now your choice it was God's
[1:18:46] choice are we together and that and that
[1:18:55] little thing in this in this falling
[1:18:59] body starts to grow in relationship
[1:19:05] praise the Lord
[1:19:07] in relationship
[1:19:13] God brought Abraham right down there and
[1:19:17] said I'm the Almighty God walk before me
[1:19:23] and be perfect
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:35] walk before me and be strengthened and
[1:19:38] big strong but Brenham on unconditional
[1:19:49] covenant he says I'm El Shaddai the
[1:19:51] Almighty God now yet you are old your
[1:19:56] strenght is all gone CIRA womb is dead
[1:19:59] you she's ninety little grandma like now
[1:20:04] a great ingredient grid grandma a ninety
[1:20:07] years old she's all for all the people
[1:20:11] laughing at you and making fun of you
[1:20:13] but I'm the breast at one like I'm like
[1:20:20] a mother to her sickly Fred baby
[1:20:23] now when the little baby all week and
[1:20:26] run down his train is gone praise the
[1:20:30] Lord
[1:20:32] physically think about it
[1:20:37] when even mental strain is gone you can
[1:20:45] make sense of faith
[1:20:51] sometimes God will bring us to that
[1:20:54] place I mean you think about some of our
[1:21:05] other lessons that is just up there in
[1:21:10] the age and sometimes when we come to we
[1:21:15] get to that place of just about crossing
[1:21:18] the river there is nothing to hold on to
[1:21:24] praise the Lord
[1:21:31] there is no physical strength sometimes
[1:21:35] there is no mental strength but it's
[1:21:41] that relationship that has been built
[1:21:43] all of those years they can close their
[1:21:50] eyes and trust that right across the
[1:21:53] river the father will be there to work
[1:21:59] on their home amen
[1:22:05] it's not a guesswork it's not a
[1:22:12] guesswork it just like when you when you
[1:22:14] when you travel in and you know what I
[1:22:16] mean you coming back homey you know
[1:22:18] based on a relationship you expect to
[1:22:21] meet your loved ones to pick you up
[1:22:34] so is that is that level of trust were
[1:22:40] weekend we can rest assure praise the
[1:22:46] Lord
[1:22:46] amen and in the hour that that that we
[1:22:52] are earning in all the things that is
[1:22:54] happening around us I mean the Word of
[1:22:57] God has been brought to question the
[1:22:59] message has been brought to question
[1:23:01] preachers have been brought to questions
[1:23:15] praise the Lord
[1:23:21] our fundamental beliefs and doctrines
[1:23:23] has been brought to questions in every
[1:23:26] way well you see this this this whole
[1:23:30] thing it was not about doctrine no those
[1:23:38] are just don't suggest principles from
[1:23:40] the Word of God that he has given to us
[1:23:42] and like brother Branham who says it was
[1:23:45] all of it they were just all to give us
[1:23:47] an idea of this great one and he's the
[1:23:54] one that we have to trust praise the
[1:24:01] Lord
[1:24:01] amen hey Ava
[1:24:08] you know the repetition of your favorite
[1:24:10] preacher gets on the line trust God of
[1:24:14] the one that you love your loved one
[1:24:28] we have to trust God praise the Lord we
[1:24:35] have to trust him because God trusts us
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:43] he put us in this age because he trusts
[1:24:46] us like Burt Branham says in God of this
[1:24:51] evil age he says this bride is not going
[1:24:54] to be like Eve Amen now you have to
[1:24:59] realize that God wanted to manifest his
[1:25:03] attribute that is the reason why he
[1:25:08] brought Eve out in a design that she was
[1:25:11] brought out and now he has manifested
[1:25:17] his attribute through all the ages
[1:25:21] praise the Lord it's time to go back
[1:25:24] home
[1:25:25] amen so this Eve he has fortified her
[1:25:29] with the word he revealed the seals that
[1:25:34] the loose ends I mean in everything and
[1:25:37] he even put us in in in a dating image
[1:25:40] that Daniel saw where knowledge is
[1:25:42] increased we have technology we have
[1:25:45] everything a normal looks like it's not
[1:25:47] enough and he's even exposing us to
[1:25:50] pressing or trials and everything just
[1:25:53] to be able to build us because this
[1:25:56] bride will not feel I mean this bride
[1:26:04] will not feel your trials are not
[1:26:10] failures to God your trials is just to
[1:26:14] make put you to the place that you will
[1:26:15] not fail
[1:26:24] he says wash I'm the breast of one just
[1:26:27] draw night onto me draw night what is
[1:26:33] that
[1:26:33] James talks about that draw night on to
[1:26:36] God and he would draw that on to you
[1:26:38] draw nigh what is there what is that
[1:26:39] what makes you to draw nine is it steps
[1:26:43] of building relationship draw night on
[1:26:48] to me and I will draw nigh God sometimes
[1:26:51] how to use our language it's not like
[1:26:53] come closer and I will come closer the
[1:26:58] more you come closer the rear I will
[1:27:01] become to you
[1:27:04] amen sometimes you have to use our
[1:27:08] language it's now like push close to
[1:27:11] mean and then I would take one step to
[1:27:13] you the more you come closer the more
[1:27:23] you get to know who I am the rear I will
[1:27:27] become to you draw matter to me now I
[1:27:30] want to give you some consolation right
[1:27:33] quick if I can in this and show you now
[1:27:37] how God he didn't do no good as long as
[1:27:41] Lord hang around that's right he had to
[1:27:45] get rid of he called him to a separate
[1:27:49] alright I actually put this for this cup
[1:27:52] there because I had a personal not honor
[1:27:56] it and what I wanted to deal with was to
[1:27:58] draw nigh amen
[1:28:00] was the draw nigh a level of trust I
[1:28:05] mean a level of trust you come from work
[1:28:13] you're tired had a busy day and yet have
[1:28:23] your mind prepared you just join me in
[1:28:25] your car and drive to church what is
[1:28:29] that you are trusting that God will do
[1:28:34] something special you are trusting
[1:28:37] that he will speak to you I mean and
[1:28:47] sometimes we pub the service all the
[1:28:52] activities that happen in church and
[1:28:57] forget about the person that we came to
[1:29:01] meet amen
[1:29:07] now you think about that you think about
[1:29:10] that God promised in his word and said
[1:29:12] draw nigh onto me I would draw nigh on
[1:29:14] to you and do you think that you you you
[1:29:19] put the time into coming to seek God and

[1:30:53] he sat rest
[1:30:56] amen just a thing about it he's at rest
[1:31:14] you have to think about it
[1:31:16] like Paul says over in English emphasis
[1:31:20] is we that were one-time strangers
[1:31:23] we were wondering aliens it is net it is
[1:31:30] net our sole alien is this body that was
[1:31:33] killing amen

[1:31:43] like first two children now becoming a
[1:31:47] son a new birth brings us in today we
[1:31:52] are no longer strangers we can trust God
[1:31:55] we can say like our Lord I came from God
[1:31:59] I would go back to God
[1:32:05] praise the Lord and even when you say
[1:32:08] that you gotta trust the law because the
[1:32:10] devil will prove you on every ground
[1:32:12] whether you really mean what you say or
[1:32:14] whether you really know what you're
[1:32:15] saying praise the Lord

[1:32:31] can we trust the Lord I mean even if the
[1:32:38] dose of the of the church is close can
[1:32:41] we trust the Lord check for example you
[1:32:50] came to service and and then you never
[1:32:52] knew that the service was cancer and you
