[3:52] of the end time was sealed up
[3:55] until this time that's what he come to
[3:58] do it's hidden from the scholars no
[4:01] wonder they want to apply
[4:02] sealing it up back under the north
[4:04] prophets and everything way back

[4:36] saw it in a vision
[4:37] and the angel come down to seal the
[4:40] vision

[13:00] we are the greatest lying wonders and
[13:02] with all
[13:03] uh are one righteousness in them that
[13:08] perish because they receive not all the
[13:11] love of the truth
[13:12] that they might be saved and for this
[13:15] cause god has sent them
[13:17] strong delusions that they should
[13:19] believe a lie
[13:22] should believe a lie and that they might
[13:24] be damned
[13:25] who believe not the truth but has
[13:28] pleasure
[13:28] in unrighteousness do you get it
[13:34] oh my
[13:38] now paul's speaking the time when the
[13:42] seal
[13:43] of god is being made
[13:46] known his spirit his name
[13:50] his grace all these other great
[13:52] mysteries is going forth now
[13:54] plans for his church to go in the
[13:57] rapture
[13:58] the outpouring of the holy ghost
[14:01] has done this that's what he's done in
[14:05] the last days
[14:06] now let's see have we got time for this
[14:09] last one
[14:10] amen the sixth
[14:14] anoint the most high oh
[14:17] my here's the one
[14:20] the last thing he used to do is to walk
[14:23] now let's just go back over and daniel
[14:25] find out what all he's to do right here
[14:29] seventeen weeks what should be
[14:30] accomplished in this time
[14:33] all right are determined upon my people
[14:35] and thy holy city
[14:37] to finish transgressions transgressions
[14:40] of the people
[14:41] to make an end of sin for the people
[14:45] and to make reconciliations for their
[14:47] iniquity
[14:48] and to bring in everlasting
[14:50] righteousness for the jews
[14:52] and to seal up the vision and prophecy
[14:54] to the time of the end
[14:56] and to anoint the most holy
[14:59] that's the sixth full reason obvious
[15:02] coming now to anoint
[15:04] the most holy
[15:07] now this may be a little bit strange for
[15:09] just a minute
[15:10] are many of you teachers but i just hold
[15:13] it just for a minute
[15:14] and see how it comes out
[15:18] this is the anointing not of a man
[15:22] jesus is already anointed that right
[15:26] man uh the balcony act said that god
[15:30] anointed jesus the holy ghost he went
[15:31] around doing
[15:32] good and healing the sick and so forth
[15:35] jesus is already he is messiah and
[15:37] messiah means the anointed one is that
[15:39] right
[15:40] but here at the end time he's to anoint
[15:43] the most holy
[15:46] what is the most holy so my way of
[15:49] seeing it
[15:50] which i believe i can prove it by the
[15:52] scripture is to anoint
[15:54] the most holy which will be the
[15:56] tabernacle that will be used during the
[15:58] millennium
[16:00] now listen see why i get it described in
[16:03] ezekiel
[16:05] the the fourth chapter then i mean the
[16:08] 43rd chapter
[16:10] first and sixth verse let's go back to
[16:11] ezekiel and find out
[16:14] how these pictures in the millennium how
[16:16] they will anoint
[16:18] the ezekiel 43 and let's just read
[16:22] a little bit here now and see what he's
[16:24] going to do
[16:25] in this millennium anointing
[16:28] ezekiel 43
[16:33] all right and now let's begin with the
[16:35] first to the sixth verse you read the
[16:37] whole thing you have to get home of
[16:38] course
[16:39] just putting down ezekiel 43. afterwards
[16:41] i watch
[16:42] description of the temple that
[16:45] is to be built in the millennium uh
[16:48] anyone
[16:49] any reader that knows that from ezekiel
[16:52] the 40th chapter
[16:53] until about the 44th chapter is nothing
[16:56] in the world but the millennium temple
[16:58] being erected on earth anyone knows that
[17:00] see when the glory of the lord fills it
[17:02] and so forth like that now
[17:04] we're going to just describe the temple
[17:05] in the 43rd chapter
[17:07] and the first to the sixth verse after
[17:09] he brought me to the gate even the gate
[17:12] that looked towards the east
[17:16] and behold the glory of god of israel
[17:18] came from the way of the east
[17:21] and the voice was like the voice of many
[17:24] waters
[17:25] and the earth a shine with the glory
[17:28] and it was according to the appearance
[17:31] of the vision which i
[17:32] saw even according to the visions that i
[17:35] saw
[17:35] when i came to destroy the city
[17:40] and the vision was like unto the vision
[17:43] that i saw by the river
[17:48] chidbar and i fell upon my faith
[17:52] and the glory of the lord the glory
[17:56] of the lord came into the house by the
[17:59] way
[18:00] of the gate whose
[18:03] prospect is towards the east so the
[18:06] spirit tucked me up and brought me into
[18:09] the inner court
[18:10] and behold the glory of the lord filled
[18:13] the house and i heard him speak
[18:15] unto me out of the house and the man
[18:17] stood
[18:18] by me anointing
[18:22] anointing that temple for the millennial
[18:25] reign
[18:25] now note in leviticus
[18:28] how it was dedicated in leviticus
[18:32] now if we go back to leviticus we find
[18:34] out that moses
[18:35] anointed the temple let's just go back
[18:37] while we're at it we got that much time
[18:40] and let's go back to leviticus and find
[18:42] out when no uh
[18:43] moses anointed the temple leviticus the
[18:46] eighth chapter
[18:50] oh i just love to compare these
[18:52] scriptures to scriptures
[18:54] don't you love it amen and then you you
[18:58] just got a
[18:59] uh an idea of what the of what we're
[19:02] looking for and what we're doing
[19:04] now any of you realizes that we're just
[19:07] using the scripture now and then
[19:08] on it now the eighth chapter of
[19:10] leviticus
[19:12] now i've got mark down here the tenth
[19:15] first
[19:17] note leviticus eight and ten
[19:22] let's see and moses took the anointing
[19:25] oil
[19:26] and poured anointing oil and anointed
[19:30] the tabernacle
[19:31] and all that was therein and
[19:35] sanctified them sprinkle thereof
[19:38] upon the altar seven times nor the altar
[19:41] and
[19:42] all the vessels both the laver
[19:45] and is put to this
[19:49] to sanctify them and he poured anointing
[19:52] all
[19:54] upon aaron's head and anointed him
[19:57] to sanctify him moses
[20:01] in the wilderness sanctifying our
[20:04] anointing the tabernacle of worship
[20:08] for the children of israel when they
[20:10] were in their
[20:11] journey it was anointed now in second
[20:14] chronicles
[20:15] turn over and we'll see the dedication
[20:18] that when the holy spirit took his seat
[20:20] at the tabernacle and watch what's
[20:22] taking place now
[20:24] in second chronicles the fifth chapter
[20:29] and let's begin at the 13th verse
[20:33] second chronicles the fifth chapter
[20:36] and begin at the 13th verse
[20:41] and it came to pass as it trumpets and
[20:44] the singers
[20:46] were to make one sound to be heard
[20:49] the praising and thanksgiving of the
[20:51] lord and when they lifted up their
[20:53] voices with the trumpet
[20:57] and the symbols and the instruments of
[21:00] music and praising the lord
[21:02] and singing for he is good and his
[21:05] mercies and doeth forever
[21:07] that then the house was filled with a
[21:09] cloud
[21:10] even the house of the lord so that the
[21:13] priest stood
[21:15] the priest could not stand to minister
[21:18] by reasons of the cloud for the glory of
[21:21] the lord had
[21:22] filled the house of god
[21:25] god came into
[21:29] the sanctuary that was to be
[21:32] anointed and was given over to him
[21:36] for the people to come to worship so to
[21:38] anoint
[21:39] not thy holy place but to anoint the
[21:43] most
[21:44] holy place and we notice that new
[21:47] jerusalem
[21:47] is the most holy place and the anointing
[21:51] will be
[21:51] upon the new jerusalem amen that
[21:54] descends from god out of heaven prepared
[21:57] as a bride adored for her husband
[21:59] the anointing will be upon them now
[22:03] when zerbella dedicated his temple
[22:06] after it was rebuilt it was not anointed
[22:10] again because it was
[22:11] already been anointed and been tore down
[22:14] it was just
[22:15] instructed again the destruction had to
[22:18] come to it it had been instructed again
[22:20] and put up so there was no anointing of
[22:22] it anymore
[22:23] when it was one time anointed that
[22:25] carried on through and it goes on until
[22:26] this very time
[22:28] but when god sets up the millennium
[22:30] tabernacle
[22:31] he will anoint the most holy not thy
[22:34] holy but the
[22:35] most holy but when the king
[22:40] takes his stone for 1 000 years
[22:43] glory she's over now
[22:47] anointing of the most holy will be the
[22:49] last thing take place
[22:51] when the tabernacle is erected the
[22:54] resurrection has come
[22:56] the jews has returned christ and his
[22:59] bride has come
[23:01] the jews 144 000 are sealed
[23:04] the millennium has taken place there
[23:06] will be an anointing
[23:08] when the most holy place will be
[23:10] anointed the holy
[23:12] holies of holiness and the most holy one
[23:15] of the most holy places the sanctuary
[23:18] where god lived between the turbans and
[23:20] this time
