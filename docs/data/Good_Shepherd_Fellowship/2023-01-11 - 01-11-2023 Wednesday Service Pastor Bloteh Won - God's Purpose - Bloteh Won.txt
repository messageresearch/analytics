it's good to see visitors on Wednesdays praise the Lord because there is uh Saint John chapter 9. thank you for taking the time to come in spend this cold winter evening with us praise the Lord hope that will keep you long tonight religious reason John chapter 9. and uh very familiar story very familiar stories in John chapter 9 and as Jesus passed back he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither have this man seen known his parents but that the works of God to be May manifest in him praise the Lord that the work of God should be made manifest in him I must work the work of him that sent me why it is they the night cometh when no man can work let's pray together Heavenly Father we have read a portion of your internal word that holds your great internal thoughts I will pray father that Lord you will come O God in and take something from out of it tonight that will be able to minister to our hearts Lord that will make a meaning of why we are here tonight that we make father the few minutes Lord or our hour that we have spent here the Lord will it will be meaningful and only you can do it so we ask that take your word tonight break it to our hearts Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you may have you'll see praise the Lord [Music] and uh once again we say the uh express our sympathy for from the church to brother Chastity and sister Cassidy sorry for your loss we pray that the Lord will continue to comfort and strengthen you praise the Lord amen there is there was something that caught my mind you know a few things that uh I place you I don't know if I did send him back there I don't think so but uh I can stay share it with them so they can be able to project it [Music] we had a uh we had a wonderful wonderful world service on the 30th of December turned out to be a wonderful prayer meeting and from the result of that and and to see how many of you testified of how much it was a blessing to you we thought that sometime during the Spring we would like to have something like that we will work out the day and let you know and so you can be able to plan your schedule or time towards that we'll see how how the rest of the the year we go until we get to that place tonight I want to speak on something a little taught away from what we've been talking about uh exceeding righteousness I want to speak just a little talk tonight on for this prayer meeting on God's purpose God has a purpose for our lives amen he has a purpose for for each and every one of us and that's the reason why he expressed us in a time that we are expressed the age the year we were born the family we were born in in uh God have a purpose for all of them praise the Lord amen and and just in this story tonight IFA the if the team back there has has been able to pull that up I just wanted to read these few things uh for the prayer meeting tonight you know the real Christian way is so hard things you can from a brother and we see also from his sister don't tell his bad things just tell his good things just tell what you know about him there's good if any if anything bad let alone the poor fellow got enough against him anyhow don't try to take the pull and shove the man father into the Dage the Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch amen see don't never try to shove him down he's down already try to help him out or help him out now for instance if one of you brethrens will make a mistake or do something wrong which you are subject to I'm subject to every one of us but as we go along let's remember we are brothers amen we are brothers now now so uh uh I was reading here from taking science with Jesus if you want to look into that and and what I'm what I'm going to look at tonight is also from there I thought I was just thinking about base uh the thought kind of across my mind and this uh uh subject here where Jesus is faced with his disciples now you will realize that uh even from the very approach of their question it will be the way that the church taught them the way they were taught the way they want us to uh that kind of a situation A man born blind uh the way they were taught was that it was it was because of sin and definitely it is truth it is because of sin that we have sickness we have you know uh uh problems and we have everything seen start the board of evil rolling upon the face of the Earth but you have to realize that before there was sin and there was uh uh God had a purpose God had a plan he had a thought in his mind now so we're going to see how our lord Jesus approached this subject when he was asked on the the health condition of this man praise the Lord you will see that even under the Lord uh uh any form of deformative that was was uh there was there was a kind of a ill feeling you know a sense of hatred that the people have towards it you know if a person will have their own child born that way you know they will they will they would just feel so bad you know and and and for some reason it was almost like a child that was born that way was exposing some kind of evil around the family or evil around the home and uh we we we thank God for for medical science uh that I would believe that God has used to to to kind of change some of those ways that people will think about but uh in in some part of the word and even in some other religion when when when children are born there way or people you know will turn out to be handicapped or disabled is is a big form of curse but we will see that our lord Jesus had a completely different way that he looked at it a complete different way when the question was asked he said neither have this man seen non-hispering but that the works of God should be May manifest in him praise the Lord now so you take that man out of the picture we don't know him by name we have never seen his picture we don't know him we just only read him but take him from the picture and put yourself in the picture tonight praise the Lord that's what I want for us to do take him from the picture and put yourself in a picture whatever might be your struggle whatever might be your weakness whatever my looks like uh uh uh you know deformative in your life or a sense of handicap things that you can do whatever it is I want for us to be able to realize tonight that God in God's Great design he uh he allowed that so his work could be made manifest in your situation praise the Lord and uh this half of it it has a very big picture here let's let's look at a little thing that uh you know bird brand will say it around this [Music] now when you when you when you read the entire story or you read the chapter before you get there you will realize that because he's going to bring out something here you'll realize that uh uh you know just like I said I don't know whether it was it's gone Sunday or another time every religion every religion has been able to uh you know they they have written down laws and rules and things you know they are conformed to their religion of how a man can please God what a man needs to do to please God what he need to do for God to be pleasing with him of God to accept him Christianity is the only religion that says You must Come Just As You Are praise the Lord amen we are the ones in the different form of denominations and different form of teaching that have tried to be able to create things for ourselves and our our doctrines to think that these are the things that we need to do for us to be accepted no praise the Lord amen Jesus says he there are living in heaven letting letting come and I will give him rest praise the Lord and uh that's that is a great great thing there the Lord has offered us that we can come just as we are amen and the reason why he wants us to come just as we are is for this very same purpose amen there are four hits for this very same purpose that the work of God will be May manifest in our life in our situation that the work of God will be May manifest just in the way that we will come to him praise the Lord amen a beautiful story that we can see even in creation we took that uh when we were talking about uh richer situation and the Patriots wife why God had to allow baroness in their state but even in you know God writing his holy spirit from the very beginning he make us to see that uh uh he he approached the Earth in a way that uh it was in darkness and you know just just like it just like a disorder you know just like chaos was it was upon the Earth and he took there from their state and where he was able to make a creation and out of that creation he brought a Garden of Eden praise the Lord amen he uh make us to see the Earth you know the beginning the beginning of the creation of the word that the scripture gave us an account of he make us to see it you know there's a whole lot of things that is hidden right in that first verse in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth there's a whole lot of things that God hid right in there but then he went out again and expressed you know there was no uh light there were water all over the Earth and all of that and then he came forth and made his work to be manifest he started working right from him meeting the Earth in that condition to be able to bring the Earth to a place where their life was coming upon the Earth and he created the trees he created and at the end he created a man in His image that the work of God will be May manifest in the Earth he allowed the Earth give us a record of the beginning of the Earth being in chaos that is a big picture big very big picture in our in in that we are looking at tonight but let's read this together praise the Lord now you see before before we get to this uh because that is pretty much the only thing we read tonight you will see the other when Jesus came the way he was carrying out his ministry and living his life and associating with the people was completely contrary to the the uh the religious group of that day amen but what was was uh uh conflicting here for them is that they could see his work remain there are even naked demons a teacher of the Lord who says we know he's saying we we in the sahindrance council know that no man can do these things except they came from God praise the Lord amen so they could see his work but also his his manner of life the way he was carrying our things and associating himself with the Publican Sinners and all of that it was difficult for them to bring it together why because the religious group of that they have already set up a standard okay they have set up a standard how you know uh they believe that uh uh uh that that that was that was the way that God would accept the way they should dress the way that you work and all of that so Jesus coming and then and they're seeing the things that he have done for how many years they have never had a prophet on the scene but here is a man yeah who's very work you know he's uh he's healing the the sake he's raising the dead and in all of the things that he's doing but yet uh his his uh his manner of life you know was he was not just following you know uh the the Traditions that they have they have set up so what they were doing now is that these Pharisees they were finding a way to be able to put dent on his ministry amen I said why why why why why will your disciples pluck on on the Sabbath day praise the Lord if you are really a man of God you I mean you were you were going to tell these disciples to respect the Sabbath and when they talk like that they talk very loud just to be able to grab the attention of the people because the religious group of that there is not approving its Ministry you're not saying that this is the messiah praise the Lord so every time Jesus will remove and he would do something uh uh uh uh I mean there was a man you know banned uh to his bed for 38 years and and they were all there at the pool of Solomon Jesus come and say pack your bag and go home praise the Lord they never rejoice in the fact that this man that was that was you know the Bound by this sickness for all of these years now he's on his feet they never rejoice in that fat they complained there why you have to do it on the Sabbath day praise the Lord there should be something that should make uh any mortar whether the man is religious or now what are he no God on that to see a poor suffering man back to good health it should make anybody happy but you see that's the danger of religion that's the danger of religion that's the curse of religion praise the Lord so I sit there so you can be able to get a picture of what I will read here now those who believe the word those who believe the word and know that the the very thing that Jesus was doing and the thing was of his life they knew who he was so they couldn't put nothing blamed on him because they couldn't see it they know it amen love is blind and Hound to them things law of cover the multitude of sin you know perfect love casts our fear and sin all discussed love does there now this blind man was sitting there in Jesus and his disciple come by and I Think Jesus give them a little lesson here that's what I want us to to pay attention to that little lesson when Jesus I mean when when they seen this poor blind man they taught well now surely there's a sin behind that somewhere praise the Lord amen just seeing his condition all in your mind there should be a sin problem here there should be a reason why when we see something happen to a man we always say well he seen he got out of the way of the Lord somewhere that's not exactly right no sir it is seen God permit those things Jesus turned around and taught them a lesson praise the Lord and what was the lesson is that uh our life on Earth have a designer praise the Lord amen I'm sure that uh the clothes you are wearing you know they all would put the attack behind it to let you know who is the faction designer that make this shirt that you are wearing praise the Lord our life the situation we find ourselves in and the things that happen around us it's not by accident praise the Lord amen it's now by accident and we will and we will only appreciate it we only appreciate those things when we come to understand that our maker is our designer praise the Lord that our maker is our designer God permit those things Jesus turned around and taught them a lesson they said his father must have seen or his mother Jesus said neither of them sin but that the works of God might be May manifest see God let things happen just so for the works of God to be made manifest God allow things praise the Lord and and and and that is the thing word our human Minds struggle with why because we are finished we are limited we want to know what is happening right now you might have plans for tomorrow you might have plans or whatever you want to do after the service but what you know and you are conscious of is what is taking place right now praise the Lord that's how much we are limited but the god that we serve is the great Fountain of all wisdom he knows the end from the beginning and he designed Our Lives praise the Lord he designed the things that we will go through praise the Lord we can join the Apostle Paul tonight to say all things work together for the good today the law of the Lord their statement will make no more sense to you unless you realize that he's the designer of Our Lives and the reason why he did it so his work will be made manifest praise the Lord but here is the fake who's I'll soon let you go tonight here is the thing here is that uh almighty God in the in this in this uh ancient time and and his uh plan and purpose of Salvation uh where he called and choose us and and deal with us to bring us to the knowledge of him you know has has all has called us to this great calling realizing that their you know uh uh he he had this purpose and plan he has brought us to the place where we are brought like I've always said into partnership okay we are brought into partnership all that the saving grace of God has done is just it has just given you a job God Saving Grace when God save you he implore you when he saved you he hire you and he can fire you praise the Lord and then when he hired you he make you a manager hmm praise the Lord you start directly from being a manager and what he's going to do is that uh uh the purpose of your life the purpose of your life is going to place it in your hands they have called you to this great calling the things that have happened even before you came to know him things that happen right down through your life call you to this great calling and uh and now you have make you like Paul says uh uh estiva that's what a Stevo is you see what is a manager he have make you a steward of the mystery of God and what is this mystery Christ in you the hope of glory praise the Lord so now God wants he's taking us on a journey he's taking us on a journey for us to be able to see the purpose for us to be able to see and appreciate why he took us through all of this journey all of these things that have taken place in our life with God principle of a wave shave the first fruit will be wave before the Harvest to prove that there are many more Seas who come with that principle God will use uh uh the life of men through down through the time and for our age use broad Branham and that was what the Angels said to him I'm sent from the presence of God to tell you about your mysterious life praise the Lord to tell you why you were born in the house of a drunker to tell you why you were born in a poor family praise the Lord glory be to God Jesus said it was not his mother it was not his father but that the work of God will be manifest in his life can you imagine a baby being born blind can you imagine everything that he missed being the child can you imagine that everything that he missed being a child he couldn't enjoy his friends because he's born blind praise the Lord he couldn't play you know they always treat him different they always thought about him different and here is this little child struggling in his mind even hating the day that he was born praise the Lord what what is what is the need of me being born I can't even see the sun I can't see color I'm hearing voices of people all around I can't even identify who are those people right praise the Lord you know it is good to talk about stories and read books about other people sometimes we feel sorry for them sometimes we enjoy their lives but then when it comes to us when we bring that home praise the Lord Jesus teaching them a lesson and when you look through the Bible you see that over and over and over again praise the Lord you see that over and over he's talking to a brother and then we were just talking fellowshipping a little bit and and uh I said so you think about Jesus you know telling his disciples and he's he made a story he had a parable whatever way we can call it yet and he says you know this man was in so much debt you know uh and then the king the lord of the land was going to to imprison him and he was backing he says you know you know I think about my children you know think about my wife and and the lord of the Lamb forgive him praise the Lord amen and then when he stepped out of the courtyard he went by then uh you know I I would not want to believe that that was just uh immediately sometimes we make it to seems like it was immediate so now he get out he sought another man and said come and pay me praise the Lord and I believe humanly that God going out of that side of the King was just was just in some sense uh you know being grateful that his life was spared but Jesus in that picture was trying to show how finite we are how limited we are how quick we can forget praise the Lord how limited we are and that we need the grace of God we need the grace of God praise the Lord amen that we need the grace of God and that's why I was thinking about this tonight I've you know I've got away from what I wanted to preach talk that we'll have a prayer meeting tonight so I was I just I just took this thought on my mind thinking about God's purpose for our life and you see it as we journey on this Earth that's all you know we will get to to know that's all we will get to discover As We join in on this Earth as the years go by and the different experiences we have in our life be looking to see God's purpose and you see the thing there you know like brother Branham says here he says that uh uh the elite that's what he meant when he says Love is Blind in a way he means that uh uh there were there were these people that that identified Jesus ministry by the scripture praise the Lord the new by the scripture this is what the the prophet said they were able to put his life and his ministry in the scripture so no matter what the Pharisees were saying about him it did not bother them praise the Lord no matter what the Pharisees were saying you know uh uh and when you read the rest of the story there you know they came and intimidated the the young man mother and parents he says you come here you know this is your child you tell us how did this happen you know in all of them just just you know to be able to save your life and their reputation this is why he's of age you asking you know they go to the man you know there are you know what uh this this thing must must be of the devil you know he says uh you know I was not seen before you were seen you were the one that was seeing I was not seeing have you ever seen a man bomb blind yeah ice comes open this is my first time in seeing you but you that was seen right you're the eyes to see praise the Lord so you see the same thing also that's part of the things that we go through and the struggle that we go through for the fact that God has already grabbed our attention amen grab our attention for us to be able to see his purpose for our life that that discouraging things that we go through do not change our mind about what God is doing in our lives the trials that we go through do not change our mind we know that he love us we know that he care for us we know that he's going to provide for us why because we have grabbed the key all of these things are happening because there is a purpose there is a design the designer has already designed it and he says that is to bring you to unexpected ends and that's the reason why we don't accept God because we are afraid of hell is just a life of appreciation we are thanking him every day in the good times in the by time we are still thanking him praise the Lord we not only appreciating the desire we know the designer that the works of God will be made manifest in our life okay that God will be glorified in our lives that God will bring us to the place of where we are his sons and his daughter God's purpose praise the Lord amen for us to be able to look at the heavens and appreciate the Stars sometimes you just look at the cloud and you just appreciate it praise the Lord I used to have a neighbor there in Eagan he lived close to us he was a mountain Back Robin you know he'll go to Colorado his son and he comes back sometime when we are talking and uh I really never saw him going to church but every time he goes on his his back ride and he comes back he will always says that I love to go to Colorado and he says when I go on to on those mountains I enjoy worshiping God well I've never seen him going to church praise the Lord and uh you see there can never be a design without an intelligence behind it without intelligence all you can have is chaos praise the Lord all you can have is chaos to have this road that she has separated to have this road and have this role here and put this piano here there was a thought behind it praise the Lord amen there was a talk behind it right our complexion might be different but look at our design in most cases we have two eyes two ears two hands that's not something that just came by itself that's not something that just came from an explosion foreign intelligence behind it praise the Lord there is an intelligence behind it and then when you look in the mirror you appreciate it glory be to God there is an intelligence that is behind the things that we go through praise the Lord there is an intelligence that is behind the things that we go through we might Now understand it sometimes it seems that that would be the thing that would cost our life but somehow we came out of faith sometimes sometimes we talk that you know we we're never going to make it but we came out of it and that's what I want for us to appreciate tonight while we say to you amen that even our Gathering here as a body it's not just to be able to you know have our you know religious cycle going there is a design there is an intelligence behind the design that keeps us here as a church amen there is a purpose he said he wants us to be like a city on the hill amen I said it on the hill always cast influence he want us to be like salt for our life to make others to be testy but that's what I want for us to catch because it will help us in a great deal as a church to know that there's a designer that have placed us here that have been able to pull us from our different background our different years different age different uh ethnicity and whatever is that and he brought us here praise the Lord that the work of God might be manifest this is not about the work of a man amen because if he was about a work of a man long time he fell if we realize and believe there is there is an intelligence they are there they have drawn us here and that is dealing with us every time we come to church and and we go home what about our life our our different lives work and school and whatever it is and then we come back again to church if we just realize that there is a great intelligence great designer and his purpose is to manifest his work in our lives he's using us to to work on one another like Solomon was chasing like I am shopping iron like Paul will say is provoking one another to Godly works that God's Great intelligence it's not just all about it you know we come and open the scripture then can we talk about the Mysteries and talk about things to make you excited you know talk about things in uh uh to make you hopeful no so you can make it back to the next service I want to make you to realize that there is a designer that has already cut out your Life Path praise the Lord amen even now I will visitors that came in tonight right from the foundation of the word it was in their life part that it would be here tonight nothing they could have done to escape it if they could have done anything they would not be sitting here since that's that's that's that's the great intelligence of God that's the great intelligence of God the way he deals with our lives the things he allow us to go through you see that's the thing that makes us when we wake up in the morning we can help but live for our eyes open to the Hills we're coming our help praise the Lord I want us to keep that on our minds tonight musicians you can come let's sing their song how great they are oh Lord my God this was

intelligence think about [Music] God's purpose we don't know he's unfolding he's helping us to discover it as he's dealing with us the different things we go through but if you just think about [Music] a designer in his intelligence foreign ER what makes you appreciate the clothes we wear the washes now we are in the technology age and you see the the iPhones and the intelligence you locate [Music] you appreciate the speed you appreciate the performance it never just came to be there's an intelligence behind it and we are in that age of intelligence the great intelligence of God being

has been programmed every moving of the cells in your body [Music] if God can be so mindful about our physical life he watch over us just from the womb till the very time we are then how much more about our soul how much more about our relationship with him that the work of God will be manifest in our life that God were God purpose will be manifest and I'm telling you we will never come to that place of rest we will always be trouble always be wandering we will always never be satisfied why give you that longing what gave you that longing foreign because there is more of God to discover in
