to switch to a different microphone are we gonna be okay all right God amen how do you you know all that song got written anybody know how that song got written you do sister Carol amen it was as a man named Spafford and he was a wealthy man living in Chicago and Dwight Moody of course we heard about Dwight Moody and the sermon this morning but Dwight Moody was his pastor and that was when they had the great fire in Chicago there and Spafford actually owned quite a bit of lakefront property at that time and he had a lot of his buildings actually burned down and so he had a lot of struggle in his life even though he was well-to-do the fire had wiped out a lot of it and he actually his son actually even before that happened his son actually died of sickness and then when they were going to he was actually going to be taking a trip over to to Europe with his family he has daughters and his wife and at the last moment he had to stay back because the City of Chicago the local government there said he had to be there too as a looked at what was going on with the destruction of the buildings that had burned down he had to be there so he had to stay behind so he told his wife and daughters to go ahead and he was going to meet them over in Europe and so as they were traveling by ship over there that ship actually struck another ship in the fog and and when he got the news his wife actually to find out whether his family had gotten rescued or not and his wife said that they were then able to send a telegram wife only he had lost all of his daughters at sea and so he took the next ship and he asked if the captain the ship that could you just let me know when we get to the place where my daughter's know where they were the accident at my daughter's drowned and so right when he got to that place they stopped and he just was able to just consider that and all of a sudden these words came flooding that's why you see the song and the part the very first verse went peace

that there was a there's about two thousand demons over in Gandhara and they were looking for reinforcements because they knew Jesus was on his way and they are gonna so they tried to get a hold of their their demon friends and say hey you got a sink this bone up otherwise we're gonna be out of here why didn't get it when he hits the shore so he man you know brother bran talked about that he said that they'd start having prayer lines he said those demons would call to each other right in the service trying to help trying to get another one to help them and realize they would I don't care how many demons you have it once Jesus is on the scene amen every hell every demon in hell couldn't stop them and you know what that's the same Jesus Christ that's here today no matter what that demon

birthday you mean I mean just they just love that young man so much and we love him - oh praise the Lord it just could be in the house of the Lord amen amen I give you a good news first the good news is there the Lord Jesus this year and we are glad to be amen you know I have a little story that I tell about two missionary and I went overseas to travel I mean omniscient rate and then after the trip I mean they just had good meetings and it was so tight the other the other missionary he had some knees back home so he bought the training you know try to find a cheap ticket on the training he tried to get back home it took him many days he was so tired but he just had a sacrifice his body to get back home and the other preacher he was so tired as well but he just wanted to be home so he bought a ticket it was expensive and then he got back home so after the rest yet before the end email and they were testifying about a meeting and the other guy says I was so tired but it I was so so tired and I just had to fly back home I can say yeah I myself - I was tired but you know I wanted to save God's money so I bought a cheap ticket on the train and I came home another preacher say yeah you want to receive God's money I wanted to save God's man praise the Lord so there are time you save God's money and there are time also you save God's man you mean and I think it's one of the time here this morning praise the Lord amen [Music] we will save Gausman today amen praise the Lord blood arrows supposed to preach tonight but just like he said he never said a lot about it June we were over in Alaska doing the meeting there and and I mean he came to the service when he were here or tip-up you know because he had just had a you know soldered on his ears they just caught a cancer I mean it was a hole in his ear he came to the service bleeding and I was saying to myself how can he do this praise the Lord and and not too long the Lord kanafeh healed him out of a serious back pain where he couldn't walk amen and and brother it is not a young man he's a little bit in age praise the Lord even though when the Holy Ghost comes down he run around just like a 16 year old but then after the service he paid for it if you don't get some rest praise the Lord so right after the service I told him to put all he can into the service this morning because he had to drive back to West counseling three hours and he has an alimony flight so there won't be service this evening amen just just bear with me praise the Lord bear with us and so let's just put all we came into the services well praise the Lord Amen and you can have him to preach for four hours if you're able to port praise the Lord anything about it I was thinking about it this morning you know it's not it's not how many service we have praise the Lord it used to be in the days of the revival when every point an evangelist was coming to town just for one meeting praise the Lord all the neighbors knew about it he mean you go to the grocery store they are talking about it and evangelists coming to town I mean all down the street and people go from the meeting and it go to testify of what God you know dead doing the meeting how he healed a second in the things that he was doing you know like I like the prophet of God said he says every mortar must have the opportunity to hear this gospel once because you take one truth experience of Jesus Christ to change our lives praise the Lord so let's pour our best into the service this morning praise the Lord and and just like we said we were setting this time aside to be thankful to the Lord as a church for many things that he brought us true amen and he stayed bringing us true praise the Lord me so we we try thinking young wrote the last time let's let's try that again and I just want to thank you lord let's sing their to the Lord this morning a little bit and then we will call the preacher up and I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your

special [Music] a face-to-face with eternal life for die [Music] praise the Lord aren't you grateful the Lord's mindful of us you can be seated just for a moment and I shared a little something with you last night and you seem to enjoy this so I thought it maybe just shared another something with you this morning or how mindful God is of us and how much he's actually in control of our lives even though sometimes maybe we feel like nothing's in control of our lives yet God is in control he he knows all things since several year ago I was down in the southern part of Mexico preaching and the Maya Indians down Aaron as the preacher brother there and he was just got on my heart and I said I'd like to help you is there anything we can do to help you he said we need Bibles he said we've got people in our church has never owned the Bible in their life and when he told me that I thought my goodness how how many do I have at home and yet these people some of them never owned the Bible in their life and he said if we could get a thousand Bibles he said we could give everybody in our church a Bible and then we could use them to witness on the streets and pass them out say they don't have to be anything fancy just a simple Spanish Bible and so I said well brother I you know I won't promise you anything but when I get home we'll just see what we can do so I got home and mentioned it to my brother-in-law was Sunday school superintendent and so the little kids started bringing their nickels and their dimes and their quarters and their dollars and it wasn't long that we had enough money to buy the Bibles to send them down into Mexico and so brother binaya Spinola was my interpreter and I was talking to brother banana I said you know I was thinking instead of buying the Bibles in America and shipping them across the border and having to pay customs because you getting some of them country's everybody wants a little bit of money before they pass it on you know and sometimes it costs more to get it in than it costs to have it to made to Gideon you know and so I said maybe we could just bomb it in Mexico and he said I'll look into it so he called me back said I found a printer that said they'd make just a simple paperback Bible and and they would make a thousand Bibles for the amount of money we had I sell for the Lord let's just do that and so then he called me the next day he said the printer called and said he would do one or two things either he would reduce the cost of the Bibles and and we could get a thousand Bibles for for less money or he would print for the same amount of money he would print a thousand and six Bibles he said so do you want for less for each Bible or just print a thousand and six I said tell him just to print a thousand and six Bibles you know you can never have too many Bibles anyway so I said just time to print a thousand and six so the Bibles were ready and they got the book and the brother benignly put them on I know it's a long story but I am coming to a point and they put the Bibles underneath this bus and so they were busing them down to the southern part of Mexico which was about a 15 hour bus ride and I flew down there to be there and when they gave the Bibles out and friends I take if you just saw them people grab their Bibles and hold them up to their heart and just weep because it's the first Bible they ever owned in their life and but on the way down to the southern part of Mexico brother B'nai and those on the bus got stopped by Mexican soldiers and made everybody get off the bus and they raised up the bottom of the bus and here's all these boxes so they said what's in those boxes and brother man I said their Bibles I said Bibles they said you're selling Bibles no no no we're not selling them we're giving them away so this Mexican soldier said you're giving these Bibles wasted yes we're taking them down here to the southern part of Mexico Katsina in that area and we're going to give them away and so the Mexican soldier said well if you're given Bibles away said we don't have a Bible said would you give us a Bible if there was he said why sure would be glad to give you a Bible say how many of they are you he said there's six of us [Applause] that's a maid isn't he wonderful amen Stan this morning we greet you in the name of the Lord and we found it such an honor to be here and to take part of the meetings this weekend and we always enjoy coming this way and may the Lord bless you richly may our prayers and the the song services morning I was telling brother Wanda they just certainly went right down the line of our message and the sisters that sang this morning it was right in line with what we're going to look at today for a Thanksgiving message so if you have your Bibles turn with it the psalms 150 and we want to read this morning at verse 6 and we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and if god knows that they need six more bibles he knows everything you have need of this morning so we just cast all of our cares upon him because we know he cares for us today amen praise the Lord hallelujah Psalms 150 verse six very familiar Scripture praise the Lord amen Bible says this let everything that hath breath praise the Lord praise ye the Lord let's bow our heads you say brother Daryl that's not much Scripture but I believe it's enough every day father we are so glad to call you father the Lord how thankful we are in our hearts Lord that on a cold wet November Sunday morning you're provided for us a place to come and worship you and all we are grateful for that today the Lord we didn't come to be seen Lord or we didn't even come to be heard Lord but we came for one purpose this morning that's the worship you without our worthy dirt God of all worship Father we pray today may we realize Lord as we look into these things these few thoughts that you gave us that we've charted down may we realize Lord just how wonderful praise is and what a great thing that you've given us Lord the ability to praise you the Lord as the sister saying this morning Lord we can praise our heard away and our pain away Lord woman's don't look at those things but we just look to you Lord so today God we're going to last that every problem ever fear Lord ever doctor's appointment every doctor's diagnosis we're gonna lie all that aside this morning Lord and just worship you may you come and receive honor and glory unto thyself Lord but we actually stakes in Jesus name and the bride says it may God bless you may be seated this morning probably God said have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of the things that are in the world they go to their ballgames and their sporting events is in their dances and they enter right into the spirit of it and we know this the truth then in the hotel room there this morning when we went down the lobby D breakfast there were people down there with the Viking hats own and their back and jackets all because they were Viking fans and they were getting ready to go to a Viking game a bed and they wanted everybody to know that's my team that's there's a little boy there and he said back in says my team and that's who I'm for and we're going to see the game and I thought my my my they're so excited about going to a ball game and I was thinking hot just a little bit more we'll be able to go to church hallelujah I'm so glad amen that my excitement into something that stirs me is not a ball game but it's the Word of God but the world gets into the spirit of it I remember one time I worked with a man and he was a volunteer for fan of the UT football team that in Knoxville Tennessee and big donor everybody says their blood runs orange because they're all fans of UT and and I remember I worked with this man and him and his uncle were going down to the ball game and on the way to the ball game his uncle had a massive heart attack and this man took him by the emergency room let him out and went to the ball game I said Roland you didn't do your uncle that way he said when I checked on him on halftime do you know why he did it he did that because he was a fan he was aut fan and I thought my if a man could do that for a ball game how dedicated and commitment ought we to be to the Lord Jesus Christ amen they go to their ball games they're scream until o muddy their horse they'll grab horns and they'll shake rattles and they'll jump up and down why because they're getting into the spirit of the game amen or he said have you ever noticed they get into their dances and they enter right into the spirit of it they don't sit there like a Wallflower or an old dried up stick they enter right into the fill of things and become a part of the things ain't man they don't just sit there and watch the game they become a part of the game and I thought oh my if they could do that to a sporting event what about we to do this more than for his not just kind of sound like an old proud of stick just some Wallflower sitting on a wall but god help us this border to get into it and to become a part of what's happening a path I didn't come this morning to see what's happened I've come this morning because I am what's happening hey babe hey man I don't want to be just a spectator but God help me to be a participator then I'll give the best a man then I'll go hallelujah then I'll give the best sweat the best hallelujah that I have this morning a man that in Knoxville Tennessee at the UT Stadium where the ballplayers meet it to the locker room they've got a sign that they tap every time they run out to the field they'll tap this sign and above the door when they run out onto the field above the doors this sign it says this day I give my all for Tennessee and they'll run out and they'll smack that side and run right out onto the football field in front of thousands of fans and the roar of the crowd and they'll go out there and they'll sweat and they'll get dirty and they'll get bruised up some of them break bones some of those been paralyzed some herbs even died but they done it because they gave all for Tennessee you know what I did I made me a son you don't say I give my all for Tennessee it says to say I give my all to Jesus Christ I could say I gave the best that I knew how to give whether I felt like it or not come on somebody if the world connect like that over a ballgame how are we to act this morning Oh something that's really worth getting involved in amen but all my they don't have a problem at all screaming and shouting and carrying on but how they hate Christians for getting into the spirit of God's Word but father said that call us fanatics holy rollers there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and their disapproval they don't care to scream them they'll the person front they don't whoever they are but they'll beat them on the head when their team scores but yet you go to worship God if people want to look at you like you're like you're some fanatic or something's wrong with you you hung around an amen and the people turn around and see who it is you know we want to be whenever the time everybody wants to be politically correct so you know if the world hates for us to get emotional and hates for us to get excited and hates for us to pray then maybe we should just calm down you know to be politically correct and get along in America maybe we should go along with their desire and just come to church and set like on a wildfire but here's what the Prophet said to do about it is that how they call us fanatics and holy rollers and there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and their disapproval but here's what the Prophet said he said men ignore it you can expect it no words coming from just go to get into the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and it's serious but nonetheless it's full of the joy of the Lord a man will have to come to church with half joy of faith of joy where my joy takes almost empty no the Bible says that our joy can be full amen amen the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of this pleasure in the Lord as the world when it savers and delights in its pleasure what's the Prophet say is simply this if they could get excited over a piece of pig skin we could get excited over the Word of God [Applause] both Christians and the world are human both have emotions you know some people say sometime well your brother I'm just not emotional I'm sorry that's just simply not true now that's true some of us may be quieter than others that's true but we all are emotional amen if you go to bed denied and you turn out the light and and you want to smooth the furniture that you didn't know she moved and you hid your big toe against the edge of the dresser you will be become emotional that's true you ain't going to tell me that you ripped the hole into your toenail off and you say my goodness look at that yeah I believe it's completely gone look at the blood no if you if you rip the end of your toenail off going to bed tonight you'll kiss that big toe if you can get it in your mouth you know I'm telling you the truth humans are emotional and I believe the church a man ought to be a Church of life and a church of praise and a church of worshipping man because any religion that's dead should be buried but I'm here to tell you this morning we don't have a dead religion Muhammad has a dead religion Buddha has a dead religion [Applause] [Music] and he said because I'm a man both Christians in the world are human both have emotions but the difference is the Christians heart and emotions are purely whom the Lord of glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh listen to me I'm not talking about something that'll glorify the flesh I'm not talking about something that works on your emotions this morning I'm not talking about what I'm talking about he's just loving to love God just to thank him as we sang this morning I just want to thank you Lord just thank you and love him and rejoice because there is no God like our God you know sure if y'all ever been to India you know the Indians are in India they'll make yourself a god and they'll pack this gone around out of wood or metal or and they'll pack this car around and every once while they'll set it down and they'll worship the God that they made with their hands but I'm so glad this morning that I'm not here gathered here that we're not here gathered worshiping some God that we made with our hands I'm glad we're not worshiping this morning a God of our imagination or a God of a denomination come on somebody but I'm so glad this morning that the god I worship I didn't fashion with my hands but god I worship this morning he fashioned me he made me with his hair oh boy to God every man do you hey man you see the devil's go trying to tell you now you better be careful that preachers gonna make you get in the flesh no no the devil is telling you a lie I'm not interested getting in the flesh I want to get out of it I see the bright light side it's just about home time its body changing table or it may not mean much to you when you're 18 it may not mean much to you when you're 12 when you think about a body change but when you get 60 when you get 70 you begin to think about a body change a man Oh going to God a man he's will try to tell you're a fanatic now you better be careful or if you praise God before there's one evidence of your healer the devil will tell you you're lying you're lying you're telling the people you're healed you're rejoicing over your healing and you're still sick you're lying but let me be like Joshua look at Joshua before Warren Rock ever came out of the building of that wall the walls of Jericho before one Rock rolled out of that wall Joshua and his army marched around the wall shouting the victory to you this morning look at the cancer look at the wheelchair how much can you walk around that wheelchair how much can you walk around that back trouble how much can you walk around that sugar daddy daddy the victory and giving God praise hallelujah starting to feel 16 a man how can rejoice in my healer because the word says I'm healed I can rejoice in my deliverance because the word says I'm delivered don't wait for signs and wonders take God at His Word that's what he's trying to been teach us for years that's what he's trying to tell us for years that's what the Prophet was saying this morning about the bride coming to her position then when it's time God Oh said someone to call her back in line to want the word amen amen don't look at the symptoms hey man don't wait for some well I'm gonna wait and say I'm completely healed and I want to tell everybody know if you've got it right you'll tell everybody when you still can't hardly get out of bed you're still you know what ideas I got me a piece of soap and I went to the mirror in the bathroom and my wife is gracious she left it there it's been there for months now but I got me a piece of soap when I could hardly get out of the bed and I made my way into the bathroom because my back was so bad and I got on a mirror and I wrote God is my healer Oh and every morning when I get up and I look into the mirror you don't want to see I see that side God is my healer and the Prophet said your body will obey your confession [Applause] the Prophet said I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon the grounds of God's Word and believe it and start testifying and praising God for your healing the meetin wouldn't close with one crippled person in here God is under obligation to answer his word and I say to us this morning why not us why not Nell what does that have to be a quote that we read why can't there be a reality why not me why not now why not us why not now why are we wake known God's not dead God's not been weakened God told Paul Paul you've got to go to Rome and on the way to Rome he got in a shipwreck bo-best it all apart Paul was able to grab a part of the ship and float to land he gets out of land everybody's wet everybody's cold Paul being a servant he goes and gathers would think that something the prophet of God was gathering would you see people get it wrong the ministers are servants to the bride the bride is not servants to the fivefold ministry my lord I thought surely you know a man that a man they wouldn't wait no Paul Paul didn't say look now I'm the church age messenger you boys go get some wood while I sit here no he was the one getting the wood and on the way back in the pile of wood you know the story was the deadly snake I'm talking bad I'm talking about old my black snake I'm talking something bad this thing was so deadly when it bit you didn't you didn't even have thought they would used to call 9-1-1 you couldn't doubt the nine before they were dead that's how bad this snake was it was so bad it was so bad that we Paul got bid you know what they did they said under watch him die and you know what they said this man has really done something bad wrong he survived a shipwreck and now he's snake bit if I ain't God trying to kill him I don't know what it is when he got bit they were saying this man there's something bad wrong with him but look at Paul Paul looked at snake he felt God told me I've got to go to Rome so how can I go to Rome and die from a snake bite so Paul took the Word of God over the venomous snake and with the death started calming up his arm you know what it ran into it ran into face adversity antidote Evelyn Paul didn't die you know what they said they said this man is a God Hey well I tell you brother down now that's good so far that's really good but you know what I paid now if I was healthy I praise God if I had no worries I praise God if I was wealthy I praise God well that's all right I appreciated that I'm sure you would huh I had a lot of money I'd praise him dude but you see the problem with that there's nothing you know that's that's good thinking if I was healthy wealthy and wise and I had all that I'd certainly praise God and you know that's that's certainly our noble let's see the problem with your thinking is this the Bible says let everything please the Lord let the sad man a happy man but now some of you need a reason for not praising God I actually found one in the Bible I know you go get quiet and that's good because I wanted to hear this if somebody this morning don't want to praise God and you're pulling back and got there right now he ain't gonna make me jump up and I'm not trying to make you jump up but if you need a reason not to praise God this morning I found what and it's even in the Bible but to hang just a saying you need make myself laugh if you need a reason not to praise God I found one in the scriptures the bible says the psalms 115 verse 17 the dead praise not the lord neither that any that go down in silence so if you're dead this morning you're excused Oh exactly you see I come like this brother I come for one purpose this morning I didn't come to complain I didn't come to find fault I didn't come to sleep I didn't cut the text I didn't come to sit on a pew I didn't cut the on the preacher but I came for one purpose I came back the main job they travel two years over the desert through the valleys but when they got there they [Music] [Applause] [Music] come for one purpose that's the worship my god or like that song I don't know what you came to do but I came to praise the Lord amen whatever state you find yourself in just praise Him just worship Him just give him praise the Bible says in one Psalm 148 praise ye the Lord praise ye the Lord from the heavens praise Him in the heights praise him all his angels praising ye are his hosts praising him Sun and Moon praise him all ye stars of light praise him he heavens of heavens and you waters that are above the heavens let them praise the name of the Lord for he command and they were created he has also established him forever and ever he has made it a Kree which shall not pass praise the Lord from the earth he dragons and all deeps fire in hell snow and vapour stormy winds fulfilling his word mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars beasts and cattle and creeping things and flying flower kings of the earth or were not excused and all the people princesses and all judges of the earth both young men and maidens Oh men and children let them praise the name of the Lord for their name alone is excellent his glory is above the earth and the heavens you know I'm not smart I'm not a smart person I ain't never been smart the three hardest years of my life was second grade you well think about it I've just never been smart somebody asked me one time said you speak a foreign language did you how English I don't know a verb from an adverb I don't understand those things but there's one thing I know sis when I speak the name Jesus I am saying an excellent in the name of Jesus to break every chain he's the waymaker like the name of Jesus and when we call upon that name you are speaking an excellent word the Bible says let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord super brother homesick listen I said let's not no I'm not belittling that I certainly know what it is to hurt I know what it is to bury loved ones I know what it is to go to a hospital to see your baby lady in a coma on life support I I've been I know that then it's real and I'm not belittling at all but if we could only understand this border that every Sikh Christian while sick we have a thousand times more to be happy over then the most cheerful sinner you look at these Hollywood stars and all their Fame and all their money and all their cars cost more than my house but are they happy they end up hanging herself in the hotel room so there's no joy in that some of you young people sue I can't wait I get a little bit older get out of this church I'm gonna get me a football career I'm gonna get me a basketball career all right we'll get me a singing career but let me tell you something it'll never bring you joy you may break every record in the state of Minnesota they may write your name in the record book but I promise you in a hundred years nobody will know who you are but you give your life for Jesus Christ where there is no stars where there is no more America your name will still be the plant you know the prophet of God said that will you lead someone to the Lord your name is associated with that person throughout eternity you know the prophet of God said a little wash woman took her wash money sewing money and she cleaned out a stable she rented a stable cleaned it out invited a preacher and that night in just a shaggy-headed twelve-year-old boy showed up for the service he gave his heart to the Lord and the prophet of God said that little boy was DL Moody and BL Moody led a million souls to Jesus Christ and you know what he said that wash lady led a million-in-one [Music] you know what you do for Christ will be declared throughout eternity hell maybe sick that may be true but we still got more to be happy about you know why because we've got a savior we got a healer we've got a deliverer we've got a god that's mindful of us who said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you listen to me this morning I may have pain and they have sorrow and they have trials and they have troubles but I've got a God that's bigger than all that he's bigger than all my problems he's bigger than all my fears my God's figure they need him ousted that I can and cannot see my God is bigger he loves me remember remember when we was little so y'all may be downloads to me from different countries maybe but when I was little we had a daisy we picked that little Daisy we had a girl we were sweet on and we'd pull that off she says she loves me she loves me not y'all done it to she loves me she loves me not mine always ended on she don't then I met my wife and she did but when it comes to God and you pick up the days he wondered does God love me you know what that days he says he loves me he loves me he loves me we were yet sinners Christ John our 17:14 says heal me Lord I shall be healed save me Lord shall be saved for thou art my praise if I want to use my breath oh god help me let me use it to praise him not talk about my problems but let me use it to exalt his name to lift up his name for he said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto myself house there 16 verse 18 says this violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting or destruction within thy borders but thou shalt called thy walls salvation and thy gates praise gates of praise God has given us walls of salvation and gates now you know I gained us two things a gate keeps things out and it lets things in it's an entrance a gang is an entrance when it seems you're all alone praise His name when you feel you can't go on just raise your hands and say greater see that it's in me and you can praise your hurt away if you just praise His name Oh God let your praise be your entrance into his presence the Bible said God inhabits the days of his bball well your backs against the wall and the Devils coming at you on every side and it seemed that there's no way out trouble here trouble there this happened that happen you know what you can do God has given you a gate and you can hang that gate and slip through the gate into this presence when you praise his name amen amen hallelujah do you love you miss morning how do you aim quit me catch my breath amen SIG's got you cut off for it you've got a gate you can hang that gate and step through it into his presence I think of Paulus Allison prisoner they were cold they were hungry they were sore they were beaten they were bloodied they were chained I could hear silence as he comes back to from unconsciousness for they had beat him so much so he starts coming to his surroundings and he starts feeling the pain you don't know where he's at exactly so the last thing he remembers just parcel oh oh oh over the next cell Paul hears his voice he hears his name pushes herself up against the wall he feels the pain in his back the chains on his hands he's a Silas I'm over here I'm here Silas Silas my said something like this oh I thought this gonna beat us to death I didn't think they'd ever quit the spa what are we gonna do I didn't know following the Lord would be like this I thought it would even picnic I thought it would be easy what do you think we should press it I can hear Paul you know what I think Silas I think this is a good place to have Church give me a seat for Christ mmm I'm one of them I'm one of him I'm so glad that I could say I'm I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I could say I'm it's a guy done in the fourth cell down he didn't like that today count that noise you burnt your Holy Roller squatting down up there we don't know that around here we're Lutheran's Sallis of my goodness ball we kind of set that fella what do you think we should do your posture [Music] [Music] and up in heaven God's looking over the banister neither one would come here look right down there you see that where we sitting my lord what is that said that's Paul and Silas he said look at how they're cold they're hungry they're bloody they're beaten they're chained rejected and they're in prison and wormwood said my goodness what do they do it God said don't having Church you know what that tells me it tells me whether I'm on a mountaintop shout the victory or whether I'm in the valley or whether I'm in a prison cell I can worship my dog any place any time anywhere under any circumstance my situation does not determine my ability to worship my god they may take my freedom they may take my money they may lock me out but they will never take my joy [Music] where to god I feel like speaking in another target how do you the prison changed with bleedin stripes Paul and Silas prayed that night and then their pain begin to sing their chase were loosed and they were free I bless your name i bless your name I give you honor I give you praise you are the life the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name submit not our if you should find you're in a prison in your mind reach out and praise defy those chains and they will fall Jesus name several year ago I was in a meeting there's a young girl there she used to be a cutter she had all these scars on her arm she owned a short sleeve shirt that day the Spirit of God moved through the people and this girl testified she said I wanted to raise my arms and worship God but I was ashamed of the scars she had them all up and down her arms she said lord I want to worship you hello people to see these scars and she said a voice spoke to her and said raise your arms and give me praise I was there that sister raised her arms and the scars left her arms [Applause] she didn't have the trouble worshiping God she didn't have no trouble shouting she didn't have no trouble jumping up and down because God had took the stars away you've got stars in your life this morning you know what you can do you can play you can play the stars away where life's not being kind of some other some of you've been abused some of these separate things you probably wouldn't want nobody else to know and you tear you in your life but let me tell you you can't undo what was done but there's one thing you can do you can take that pain you can take that hurt and turn it into worship and turn it into frame and that God take the scars away not only is the gate for entrance it's also a defense it keeps things out rev Rev says let's say thanks be to God says you believe now you believe me to be a servant you believe me to be a servant you must believe now sister because we realize your condition you got cancer you're not gonna live long unless God touches you isn't that right come here my sister kind Heavenly Father let thy mercies be shown unto the woman makes you go from here tonight normal and well I condemned this enemy with this church and these believing people in the name of Jesus Christ may it leave her a man god bless you sister go happy now and rejoicing and thanking God and just believe it's gone from you now and when it goes out it'll come back again but if you just say thank you Lord if you just keep on rejoicing if you just keep on rejoicing it can't come back then it'll go out it'll try to come back but when it tries to come back if it finds you faking God if it finds you praising the Lord it cannot why because praise is a gate of defense Oh hallelujah do you love Eve this morning oh okay how you feeling for him I don't care what you in right now what would it be right now if every one of us just right now we'll just raise our hands and shout the victory if everybody in the let's just raise your hand [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] blessed be your neighbor blessed be your name how it must please God that while we're getting trouble we begin giving God praise the Bible says in Psalm 74 21 I'll let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise the name not wait to have fully recovered not wait you were fully read delivered not not not wait till we get the job we asked God to give us and did praise him for it but when we asked him just start thanking him for it there was a sister role many a few years ago a gypsy girl about 19 year old she was born without a hip she come to the service on a crutch when she walked her leg would swing like this she had no control over it when she stopped her leg with sweets you'd have to stop it with her hand she comes to the RO I had the night services and Friday night she came to the altar and she wanted to repent of her sins I felt sorry for her since this she's trying to get down on her knees to repentance it's just you can repent right here where you stand but that wasn't good enough she worked that leg till she got down on the ground and repented and I thought my god how many people in America has two good legs and never kneels before the Lord what a rebuke she'll be one day the next morning was Saturday after service we had a baptismal service in a river that young girl with her crutch went out into that icy rushing river and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ she come back Saturday night to the altar you know what she said Darrell I want the Lord to heal me she said I want to be a wife I want to have children she said but who would want to marry me like this and she said I'm gonna ask God to heal me I said you know what sis if I was you I said I wouldn't ask God to heal me because you're already healed I would simply just start thanking him for healing you I said you take this handkerchief and when God heals your help you send it back to me as the testimony of what God did for you two or three years went by and a brother came up to me at church he said brother Darrell I was in a chat room and the sister said do you know brother Darrell ward he said yes I go to church with him she said I'm trying to get a hold of him can I have his email address he says he said ok I said sure he ain't no problem me and my wife we'll look at it together it's no problem so I'll get this email from this girl her name was Christina she said brother there I've been trying to find you she said I did what you told me to do she said I went everywhere thanking God for my healing and she said it got to the point that my mama sent me down and said honey I want you to quit you're embarrassing the family because you're telling everybody God's healed your help and you're still on a crutch she said what brother died I didn't listen to my mama I just kept testify they said I was in young people's meeting I said let me say I want to testify I want to thank God for healing me and said even my friends got aggravated they said we're not I heard him say here she goes again she said but I kept doing it and she said I was in a service and I stood up and said I want to thank God for healing my Hill and she said brother Darrell when I said that my hip I was in Ohio at the youth the youth camp in Ohio a couple year ago and a brother came up to me from Romania he said brother Dale do you know Christina I said yes he said you know I said yes I said isn't it wonderful he said brother I was in the meeting I was sitting behind her he said I watched her leg grow up because he's God [Music] how it must please God that we begin to give God praise while we're yet afflicted while were yet in need not wait till we're fully recovered but while we're yet poor while were yet needed we could still call upon his name we can still exalt his name we can praise God in the morning we can praise Him in the noon time we can praise Him in the night time listen to me just the one service they will just take it this a little bit of time but what Satan gonna do to a man that every time he afflicts him he praises God now I'm not too smart but you see if every time Satan afflict you you do that brother Jewell for me says rosie-wosie me or was he was he I think what he said was he was he mean and every time he inflicts you you quit coming to church whew well that was a stinger happen thank you lord only where that came from but anything every time something happens you get discouraged then what do you think that there was if the devil put something on you that gets you so discouraged that you can't come to church what do you think is gonna do the next day they go give you a double dose because it worked but I'm not too smart but I figure that if every time the devil punches me I say praise God every time he afflicts me you don't say just a greater chance for a miracle I threw all the devil's will say discus crazy he's lost his mind and that's true I have lost my minds because I've got the mind of Christ hey don't look at your symptoms look to your God look at Jonah this morning everywhere Jonah look worse whales belly now friends ain't nobody here been swallowed by no fish you know that's the truth so none of us has ever been where Jonah was and Jonah look at him can you imagine just for a minute here's Jonah swaddled by a great fish and he's in his belly well what do you reckon sin what do you reckon sin a fish's belly other fish I don't care will you cook it it stinks so can you imagine the smell seaweed around and they tied the guy happened throw him in the ocean here he is tied up in the bottom in a fish's belly with Mississippi license plates and everything else that's in this fish's belly and the fish just swallowed a man a 6-foot 200-pound man perhaps what do you think his stomach's gonna do start producing more acid to digest a 200-pound man so now all of a sudden and all he's in a fish's belly with other fish and it's smelling to high heavens here comes the acid in his mouth in his ears in his eyes let's say that was a widest white man you ever saw tell he was bleached out back you see what I'm saying for instance I've just tried to bring the point to you how bad his condition was but did he quit did he collapse in to spare but the Bible says Jonah said I cried out by reason of my affliction unto the Lord now I wonder sometimes if God allows things to come into our life just so we will cry out that he can come and deliver us and just show us how great he is Jonah said I cried I didn't cry by the acid I didn't cry because of the fish that was around me but I cried by my affliction to the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heard my voice the symptoms all God the symptoms never silenced his voice not in the midst of his trial he begin to praise God I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord right in the midst of his trial he started having a Thanksgiving week in service you began to praise God you know the father said when those fish eat he said they go right to the bottle he said watch you feed them little goldfish they go right to the bottom of the fishbowl and when this great fish swallowed this big man he went right down to the bottom of the ocean because he had two hundred pounds to digest so he's done are just all well that was a good mule right there can't beat that white meat because it it's just all there just and Jonah begin to praise God and God began to hear Jonah's voice and be God begin to answer back and so that fish was just and I wasn't whoa whoa oh my god Jonah's praise made the fish uncomfortable and if Jonah's praise can make a fish uncomfortable if us praising God what will they do to the devil this morning that's it should I do I gotta get rid of this guy this guy's driving me crazy and he comes up and he opens up his mouth and he rolls out his tongue and Jonah walks up says repeat the lord spake unto the fish the Bible said and it vomited Jonah out up on trial and if price could deliver you from a whale's belly it can deliver you from the gloom and the doom where breath tells the sister now go on your road now rejoice just start praising God and say thank you dear God and all that gloomy feeling will be gone just hang your gate of praise God likes to be worshipped and when you worship Him it just isn't exactly singing a song as we do but it's singing it in the spirit of worship you see then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back you begin to worship God you begin to lift it up God begins to receive that because Jesus told the woman at the well he seeks those whom will worship him that's what he's looking for this morning he's looking for worshipers well as we sing that so let the worshiper arise that's what he's looking for this morning somebody that'll give him praise the Prophet said this he said God likes to be worshipped by his children then I say let's make him happy this is the first place if you won't scripture the people are supposed to come to the house of God for one purpose that is to worship to sing songs and to worship God that's the way God expects it he does inspect us to come to the house of God to talk about something else or talk about one another or talk about what we go to do through the week he expects us to come to worship Him because it is a house of worship and I say to you this morning as we come to a close let's not let this just be a house of worship but let's this be a house of worship then as long as I'm in Minnesota as long as I'm in Wisconsin as long as I'm in Tennessee or Arkansas or whoever as long as I'm on this earth the rocks will never have to cry out the Bible says this praise ye the Lord singing to the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints man Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their king let them praise His name is dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel in the harp for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds you don't just have to worship God in church you can worship Him at the red light you can worship God or ever your aunt because this is a house of worship it's not always swinging from the chandeliers it's not always screaming to the top of your voice but they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth I remember a few year ago when I worked in surgery I just work in surgery 17 years did thousands of opera assistant doctors in surgery and I remember one time this man came in he threw a blood clot over 90% of his bow was dead he's been dead for four days when this guy come in he could imagine the smell for days of dead Bell we opened the guy up the doctors dr. Evans was on the case and I was assisting him dr. Evans made a comment was going to take all this power out so many feet of bowel and we could put a little bag on his side and dr. Evan said there's no way this man can live over 90% of his bowel gone he'll have no time and because you know your bow absorbs the vitamins and nutrients when you eat your food that's where it's absorbed at and none of that was there so he buck he if he even lived he'd be like he was drinking it almost immediately come out he said there's no way this man can live and I thought you know Lord that's true that's true Lord I just don't see how the man could live I was just saying that just talking to the Lord under my breath and all at once God is my witness his presence came right there where I said and when I felt his presence I begin to you know a lot of people shouted to me when he comes up on me I just weep you know God deals with people different ways but to me God's always squeezed my heart to juice always comes out my eyes that's all I was there and I felt his presence and I begin to weep and I was turning my head away I didn't want the doctor to see me cry and if I spoke to me I said is there anything too hard for God and I just begin to worship him since I just begin to praise I said don't god there's nothing too hard for you you're a god you're the healer you're the deliverer of there is nothing that's too hard for you you know what the man lived about a year and a half later I went into the canteen the cafeteria there at the VA hospital that's where I worked and I we need to get some food and I looked at the table it was him I'll tell you his name I know you don't know him his name was Rufus Bunch and I saw him and I went over to him I said mister Bunch he said yes he didn't know me from Adam I said sir you don't know me I said but here a few years ago when you came in I was on your case and I begin to tell him what happened and once again the presence of the Lord came right down in the cafeteria and me and that old man except down at that table worshiped God because the Son of God can worship God anywhere hallelujah let the sakes be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon the bed that the high praises of God be in their mouth had a two-edged sword in their hand praise ye the Lord praise God in His sanctuary praise Him in the firmament of his power praising for his mighty acts praised him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psaltery and the harp praise him with the timbrel and the dance praising with the string instruments and organs praise him upon the loud sounding cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals let everything let every brother down I don't
