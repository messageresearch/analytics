[27:48] There's a little chorus we have back
[27:50] there. And uh uh guilty of love in the
[27:55] first
[27:57] degree. Let's try that tonight. I might
[28:00] not do well on it, but let's just throw
[28:02] it out there. Amen. Praise the Lord. The

[28:12] sent that chorus back there a long time
[28:15] ago and uh guilty of love in the first
[28:19] degree. If they don't find it, then I'm
[28:22] off the hook tonight.

[29:19] service
[29:19] here and
[29:25] [Music]
[29:46] Let's bow our heads together while the
[29:48] musicians play softly.
[30:11] [Music]
[30:17] [Music]
[30:20] Father, we love you tonight.
[30:23] We appreciate you Lord for giving us
[30:25] another
[30:27] opportunity to come Lord
[30:29] Father to this sacra moment of your
[30:34] word. We want to thank you precious
[30:37] Lord that you have taught us Lord
[30:40] Father to honor your ordinances. We just
[30:44] pray tonight, Father God, for those that
[30:47] are streaming in Lord God, who love to
[30:50] be here and they are not here with us
[30:52] tonight. And if there are any on their
[30:54] way coming, we pray that Lord, you bring
[30:56] them into safely. We just want to pray
[30:59] that you bless us in your presence,
[31:01] Lord, we want to take just a little
[31:03] thought of your word and share with your
[31:05] children tonight. Come, Father, speak to
[31:08] us, Lord. Encourage our hearts, oh Lord.
[31:12] draw us closer to
[31:13] you. Father, we love you. We appreciate
[31:17] you. In Jesus name we
[31:27] pray. The Lord bless you. Thank you
[31:29] musicians. Let's uh let's just take our
[31:31] Bibles. Revelation chapter
[31:34] 19. Revelation chapter 19.
[31:53] Revelation chapter 19 we will read from
[31:55] verse 6 to verse
[31:58] 9. Revelation chapter 19 we will read
[32:02] from verse 6 to verse 9.
[32:12] And I heard as it were the voice of a
[32:15] great
[32:16] multitude and as the voice of many
[32:19] waters and as the voice of mighty
[32:23] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[32:26] Lord God unimportant
[32:28] reneth. Let us be glad and rejoice and
[32:32] give honor to him for the marriage of
[32:34] the Lamb is come and his wife has made
[32:38] herself
[32:40] ready. And to her was granted that she
[32:43] should be araided in fine lining, clean
[32:47] and white, for the fine linen is the
[32:50] righteousness of the saints. Praise the
[32:52] Lord.
[32:55] And he said unto me, write blessed are
[32:59] they which are called unto the marry
[33:02] supper of the lamb. And he said unto me,
[33:07] these are the true saying of God. Amen.
[33:12] Father, once again we ask blessing upon
[33:15] your word in Jesus name.
[33:18] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[33:22] Lord. The Lord bless you. You may have
[33:23] your seat. After the service, there was
[33:26] uh one of one of the young ones that
[33:29] came in the office and
[33:32] uh uh after we were doing our our our
[33:36] candy fellowship and then she asked me
[33:39] the question. She said
[33:42] uh she
[33:44] said, "Brother one, you were saying
[33:46] something I didn't understand." She said
[33:48] uh to me, she said uh
[33:52] uh what was there that God asked uh
[33:56] Abraham to do? I said, for him to
[33:59] sacrifice his son. She said, "What does
[34:02] that
[34:03] mean?" I said, "Well, God wanted for
[34:08] Abraham to kill his son." She said, "For
[34:12] what?"
[34:17] and
[34:18] uh and
[34:21] uh and then Samuel jumped in and he was
[34:24] trying to explain it. So, he went over
[34:26] all of the story, but uh I could
[34:31] see where her question was coming from.
[34:35] Praise the Lord. Why would a loving God
[34:40] ask a
[34:41] father to kill his son?
[34:45] Now, so when then I I tried to explain
[34:49] it to her. as well. God was trying to
[34:53] really God now wanted for Abraham to
[34:56] kill
[34:57] Isaac and uh God was uh trying to prove
[35:02] Abraham love to him and try to try to
[35:06] explain it in a way what a little mind
[35:08] would be able to understand it because
[35:10] from the asking of her question I could
[35:13] see how her mind was terrified.
[35:16] Why would God ask for a father to kill
[35:21] his son?
[35:23] Then uh uh preparing for the service, I
[35:26] remember that uh while I was looking at
[35:30] this uh uh uh subject I spoke on this
[35:34] morning, the
[35:35] aid, I came across uh some uh some rabbi
[35:41] coming and their comment was just like
[35:45] the mind of this young child. So I went
[35:48] back to my note and then I decided to to
[35:52] just uh
[35:54] uh send two of them out there to to
[36:00] uh to our team back there. So uh they
[36:04] will share the first
[36:06] one. This was uh uh a rab discuss
[36:12] argument on a literal level. The text
[36:15] teaches us that the bounding of a of uh
[36:20] of
[36:21] Isaac as a test of Abraham faith. God
[36:25] needs to know if Abraham and his
[36:28] descendant will be able to fulfill their
[36:31] part of the covenantal relationship. And
[36:36] yet this answer is so problematic.
[36:42] What kind of a God will ask a parent to
[36:45] sacrifice a child? Now, so when when the
[36:48] little girl asks me, I was thinking,
[36:52] okay, I can see why the rabbi will ask
[36:55] that because I'm seeing them having the
[36:58] mind of a
[37:01] child. Praise the Lord. Let's let's
[37:04] finish reading there and then we will
[37:07] read the next one. I took two of them.
[37:11] Uh what kind of a God will ask a parent
[37:14] to sacrifice a child as a test? It
[37:18] doesn't make sense. There must be
[37:21] something more to
[37:24] that. Praise the Lord.
[37:27] Amen. They are seeing it that it doesn't
[37:30] make
[37:30] sense. Well, we we we see the end
[37:34] result. But just for the fact that God
[37:38] who asks Abraham to do that, it doesn't
[37:42] make
[37:43] sense. Praise the Lord. Amen. Now you
[37:47] have to also see it at the place that
[37:51] the Jews, these rabbi have not accepted
[37:54] what took place on
[37:56] Calvary. There is no way they can relate
[37:59] that to Calvary. You and myself have the
[38:02] benefit to be able to understand that
[38:05] but they have not accepted it. So they
[38:08] are saying there should be something
[38:10] more to
[38:15] that. Are we together? Praise the Lord.
[38:18] Let's read the next one.
[38:21] In the end, I have to strip the
[38:25] architect of its litual element. Looking
[38:29] looking uh at it as a story involving a
[38:33] real man and a real son is just too
[38:40] terrible. Praise the Lord. It's just too
[38:43] terrible in their literal mind.
[38:47] It's too
[38:50] terrible that Jehovah will require
[38:55] this. Praise the
[38:58] Lord. They don't have the benefit to be
[39:01] able to understand the types and the
[39:05] shadow. They don't have the benefit to
[39:08] be able to understand the all the
[39:10] similitudes that is in the word. They
[39:13] don't that that uh you know they are
[39:17] they are under the Lord is strictly the
[39:21] letters. So is the straight letter that
[39:24] is stumbling
[39:26] them because the veil has not been taken
[39:29] from their eyes for them to see what
[39:31] this actually
[39:34] represented. But let's go back to the
[39:36] facts of the story.
[39:39] God did not wanted
[39:42] Isaac. It was Abraham he
[39:46] wanted. Praise the Lord. It was
[39:51] Abraham that he wanted. He never wanted
[39:54] Isaac. He wanted that heart of
[39:58] Abraham that he been speaking to, that
[40:01] he's been dealing to all of this why to
[40:04] remain a constant faithful heart to him.
[40:09] Are we together now? So tonight, that's
[40:12] not what we are continuing to talk on. I
[40:14] just went that way because of what that
[40:16] little girl asked me uh this afternoon.
[40:19] I want to talk on the marriage of the
[40:21] lamb. Uh uh and and this uh uh talk
[40:26] tonight is is just coming from the place
[40:28] of where I I mentioned to you. I saw the
[40:31] brother uh you know uh uh putting up a
[40:34] subject and a wonderful brother. I
[40:36] appreciate listening to some of his
[40:38] comment in but he was answering
[40:40] somebody's question on what is the
[40:43] marriage of the lamb what what actually
[40:45] is the marriage of the lamb he took some
[40:47] quotes which of course you can look
[40:49] there and you will see it and uh and he
[40:52] was relating it to the marriage between
[40:56] the lamb and the bride would take place
[40:58] in the
[41:00] rapture before we go to the wedding
[41:04] supper and when he said
[41:07] I said, "No, I don't think that's the
[41:10] way it is."
[41:11] Amen. Now, so I'm not I'm not really
[41:15] coming in a sense of correcting him. But
[41:17] when I went back and started looking at
[41:19] some of my notes uh in in time past
[41:22] where I've spoke on this, I thought,
[41:25] okay, I would just take a little portion
[41:26] from there and and talk to the church,
[41:28] but then I would go in a different way
[41:31] to be able to encourage us tonight.
[41:33] Amen. So that's what we want to talk
[41:36] about tonight. Let us be glad and
[41:40] rejoice and gave honor to him for the
[41:44] marriage the lamb is come and his wife
[41:48] had made herself ready. Now what I want
[41:50] us to see in in in Revelation chapter 19
[41:54] here both the marriage of the lamb and
[41:58] also the marriage supper is stated right
[42:02] in our
[42:04] text. Praise the Lord. The marriage of
[42:07] the lamb uh uh uh uh has come is is come
[42:12] and his wife had made herself ready.
[42:15] Then down in verse nine, blessed are
[42:18] they that are called to the marriage
[42:20] supper of the lamb. So there is a
[42:23] marriage supper of the lamb and the
[42:26] marriage of the lamb. Praise the Lord.
[42:29] We go to the marriage of the lamb before
[42:32] we go to the marriage supper or the
[42:35] marriage take place, the wedding take
[42:37] place before we go to the the the
[42:40] reception, the marriage supper. Praise
[42:43] the Lord. So the marriage supper is more
[42:45] is more like the the the the reception.
[42:49] But tonight I just I will do it a little
[42:51] bit on the marriage of the lamb for for
[42:54] maybe
[42:56] uh 20 30 minutes that is before us
[42:59] tonight. I would just I would take one
[43:01] quote and then we will read through that
[43:03] together and uh and then maybe you can
[43:06] take it on from there. Praise the Lord.
[43:10] Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:15] We know that in uh in uh uh Revelation
[43:19] chap I mean Matthew chapter 25 uh um uh
[43:24] the
[43:25] voice of the bridegroom called out you
[43:28] know uh uh uh called out the bride and
[43:32] we know that uh this was a call that
[43:35] came to seven church ages. Amen. It came
[43:38] to seven church ages. So uh uh uh way
[43:43] back you know growing in the in the
[43:46] message I thought that you know it was
[43:49] only the seven age that you know that
[43:52] was producing the bride but God had a
[43:54] bride throughout the seven church ages.
[43:57] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[44:02] So let's just go to our our uh quote for
[44:06] reference tonight from the message
[44:08] proving his word. That's where we will
[44:11] just uh read from tonight and uh
[44:13] encourage ourself and and then uh uh go
[44:17] into the second part of the service
[44:23] tonight. And Jesus said, "As it was in
[44:27] the days of Sodom, now watch
[44:31] close in the days of
[44:34] Sodom." So will it be at the coming of
[44:37] the son of man when there when the son
[44:41] of man is being
[44:43] revealed. Praise the Lord. We know that
[44:47] uh uh there that's a promise uh uh that
[44:50] is mentioned. uh Luke recorded that uh
[44:54] uh in in Luke
[44:56] 17:30 that uh uh you don't find that so
[45:01] closely in the other gospel. Luke is the
[45:04] one that recorded that and and and that
[45:07] that uh uh take takes a place of
[45:10] importance here. So we we seeing this
[45:13] promise that Jesus said just as it was
[45:16] in the days of Sodom, so will it be in
[45:19] the coming of the son of man. And uh and
[45:22] right in that time there will be a
[45:24] revealing of the son of
[45:27] man. Let's go ahead and then uh now no
[45:32] more
[45:34] as as a church. See no more. Now this is
[45:40] the concept here that brother Brandham
[45:41] is carrying because he's saying no more
[45:44] as a church no more the bride is
[45:49] called. Amen.
[45:51] Praise the Lord. The bride is called. So
[45:54] the revealing of the son of man is
[45:56] molded in this place where Jesus
[46:00] throughout his ministry and uh uh uh you
[46:05] know he went about doing good, healing
[46:08] the sick and you know uh uh uh carrying
[46:11] out but there were there were there were
[46:14] stages of his
[46:16] ministry. Praise the Lord. Amen. There
[46:19] were stages of his ministry. If you look
[46:22] there in Matthew chapter
[46:25] 12, you'll realize that the that was in
[46:29] Matthew chapter 12 where the Pharisees
[46:31] called him the prince of devil. Amen.
[46:35] They call him
[46:37] Bezible, you know, the prince of devil.
[46:40] And right after that, the Bible says
[46:44] Jesus ministry changed because he never
[46:48] said things to to his disciples in in
[46:51] public
[46:53] anymore. Every time he would want to say
[46:55] things to them, he would bring them
[46:59] aside.
[47:01] Amen. And whenever the Pharisees and all
[47:04] the people were there, he would talk to
[47:06] them in parables.
[47:10] So his ministry
[47:12] changed. He was in a different stage of
[47:15] his
[47:18] ministry. Are we
[47:20] together? Now let's let's look at
[47:23] something
[47:24] here in
[47:27] uh in St.
[47:35] John. I think that should be over in St.
[47:38] John chapter
[47:48] 15. That should be St. John chapter 15.
[47:51] Let's let's read chapter 15 verse 15.
[48:11] we will get to get a good context of it.
[48:13] We go back to verse 13. Greater love has
[48:16] no man than this, that a man lay down
[48:20] his life for his
[48:25] friends. Ye are my
[48:28] friends, if ye do whatsoever I command
[48:32] you.
[48:35] Henceforth I call you not
[48:39] servants, for the servants knoweth not
[48:42] what his Lord
[48:44] does. But I have called you
[48:51] friends. For all
[48:54] things that I have heard of my
[48:58] father, I have made known unto you.
[49:02] Praise the Lord.
[49:04] Now, so the reason what I read there is
[49:07] for us to be able to see a progression
[49:11] of
[49:13] relationship. Remember that by the Lord,
[49:17] Israel is always called
[49:21] servants.
[49:22] Amen. They were servants to God by the
[49:27] Lord. Are we
[49:29] together now? So Jesus comes on the
[49:33] scene. He's about to take
[49:36] them to a higher level of
[49:40] relationship.
[49:41] Amen. Taking them from the Lord and
[49:44] bringing them more
[49:47] closer. Are we
[49:49] together? So he said, "Henceforth I call
[49:52] you no
[49:53] sevens. I call you my
[49:56] friends." Praise the Lord. For a seven
[50:00] is not invited into the inner
[50:05] chamber. Are we
[50:08] together? Now I'm about to tell you the
[50:11] hidden secret of the
[50:15] fathers. The Lord didn't give it to us.
[50:18] It was coded in the Lord. The Lord hide
[50:21] it in types and shadow. But now I'm
[50:24] going I'm I'm bringing you to a place
[50:26] where I'm now going to tell you the
[50:30] secret
[50:32] things. Henceforth you are no longer
[50:34] servants. Uh uh uh I call you my
[50:38] friends. Now you will see that
[50:43] after his
[50:46] uh
[50:55] uh I want to take one more beer. Oh,
[51:02] sorry. Praise the
[51:06] Lord. Let's take uh St. John, stay right
[51:09] there in John chapter 20.
[51:38] Praise the Lord. In in John chapter 28,
[51:42] you look at uh uh verse
[51:45] 17. This is right after the
[51:48] resurrection.
[51:51] Jesus said unto her, he's speaking to
[51:53] Mary, yet touch me not for I am not yet
[51:58] ascended to my father, but go to my
[52:03] brethren. Now you will realize this is
[52:06] the first time Jesus will call the
[52:09] disciple his
[52:11] brethren. Look in the scripture after
[52:14] his
[52:15] resurrection, they have gone into a more
[52:18] closer union. He says, "I go
[52:22] unto my
[52:24] father, which is your father, my God,
[52:27] which is your God." Praise the
[52:31] Lord. So he says, "Now you are no longer
[52:34] servants. I call you my
[52:37] friends." After his
[52:39] resurrection, he says, "You are my
[52:42] brethrens." Now what am I what am I
[52:45] doing here is is to just show us how
[52:49] that is the same way he did with the
[52:52] church. Praise the Lord.
[52:55] Amen. That is the same way he did with
[52:58] the church. He came as our savior, our
[53:01] lord and
[53:03] savior. He gave he gave his life. He
[53:06] paid the price. He he sent out his word.
[53:10] He's preaching uh repent the kingdom of
[53:13] heaven is at hand. Praise the
[53:16] Lord. And then uh when he sent out his
[53:20] word, there's a group of people that
[53:23] came out and that's what the church is.
[53:26] It's a call out
[53:27] people. Praise the Lord. And yet from
[53:31] this call out people, these people that
[53:33] have heard the message of salvation, you
[53:36] know, that has uh uh uh is is is turning
[53:38] away from Judaism, the that have that
[53:42] received the message of the gospel, we
[53:44] realize that by prophecy back in the Old
[53:48] Testament that God was going to get a
[53:52] people for his name's sake. Praise the
[53:55] Lord. So there is a call out group that
[53:58] is the church but there is another group
[54:01] in that group a people that are going to
[54:05] take on his
[54:07] name. Praise the Lord. That's what makes
[54:10] the difference between the church and
[54:12] the bride.
[54:18] Are we
[54:20] together? Are you are you getting the
[54:22] picture?
[54:24] are using John to show how God takes his
[54:28] people in progressive re uh uh uh
[54:31] relationship. We can we can we can
[54:34] compare that to our justification,
[54:37] sanctification and the baptism of the
[54:39] Holy Ghost. He takes us through those
[54:43] stages of
[54:44] relationship. Are we together? Is it
[54:47] making sense to you? I should not be
[54:50] confusing you tonight. Amen.
[54:53] because it's not a preaching service,
[54:55] it's a communion
[54:57] service. But the reason why I'm doing it
[54:59] is to be able to come to the marriage of
[55:01] the
[55:05] lamb because out of the church he has
[55:08] called a
[55:09] bride. He has called a people that would
[55:12] take on his
[55:14] name.
[55:16] Hallelujah. It's just like a young man
[55:18] looking for the woman. They are they are
[55:20] all many. They are all nice. They are
[55:22] all pretty. But he is only going to take
[55:25] one in the midst of all of the pretty
[55:28] girls that are there now. So that is the
[55:30] same thing here. There's a there's a
[55:32] there's a people in every church age.
[55:35] That is the reason why every church age
[55:38] take that emphasis. He that have an ear,
[55:42] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[55:48] church. Are we
[55:51] together? is hearing what the spirit
[55:54] says to the church that calls out the
[55:58] bride. Because in that message that goes
[56:01] forth to the church, there is a message
[56:03] there that calls out the bride. Come out
[56:06] of
[56:08] her. Are we
[56:14] together? Praise the
[56:16] Lord. Are we together? Now, the reason
[56:20] why uh I I I would do this tonight is uh
[56:25] is is uh uh this morning we're talking a
[56:28] little bit on uh uh uh commitment on uh
[56:32] uh the bounding power and all of that.
[56:35] So, uh uh I just I just uh taught him
[56:40] that this afternoon and said, well, I I
[56:42] would just go in this direction a little
[56:43] bit just to bring some sense of
[56:46] encouragement to the church.
[56:49] And also trust that the Lord will kind
[56:52] of awaken us because you see there is
[56:55] this notion there is this idea uh you
[56:58] know that floats around where people
[57:01] think you know what we are the bride we
[57:03] have believe brother Brandon message and
[57:06] uh and and and they just think that's
[57:08] all the bride
[57:11] requirement to believe that brother
[57:13] Brandham is a prophet baptized in Jesus
[57:17] name. Praise the Lord. Learn the dress
[57:22] code. Learn some of the message
[57:25] language. But we realize that many of
[57:28] these people that believe Brother
[57:30] Brandham is a prophet, baptized in Jesus
[57:33] name, the the the statement of born in
[57:36] the message, raised in the message, will
[57:39] realize that there is no birth in their
[57:42] heart.
[57:44] There is no birth that has taken
[57:47] place. Not because you are born by
[57:49] message. Parents make you a bride. Not
[57:51] because you are baptized in Jesus name.
[57:53] They make you a
[57:59] bride. He that have an
[58:02] ear will hear what the spirit
[58:06] says. Are we
[58:08] together? Amen.
[58:11] Now, so that's that's the reason why we
[58:13] go into this tonight. So, let's go back
[58:14] to to our quote because uh uh I has a I
[58:18] have a habit of taking one thing and
[58:20] just going on with it and can never get
[58:23] back home.
[58:25] So he says here when the son of man is
[58:28] revealed there will be there will be a
[58:31] time in his
[58:34] ministry that he will not just be the
[58:37] healer on godly
[58:40] show. There will come a time in his
[58:42] ministry where there will be a a a
[58:46] revelation. There will be a a an
[58:50] identity. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[58:57] At first many of them knew him to be the
[58:59] carpenter son. No doubt he he faced
[59:03] benches and cheers for
[59:06] them. But when he got into his healing
[59:09] ministry, they knew him to be the
[59:15] healer. Are we together? But you see
[59:18] there is there is a group of people like
[59:21] uh uh uh like Natania and the rest of
[59:24] them that was identifying that there is
[59:27] more to this man. this one that has a a
[59:30] a social ministry to know the secret of
[59:33] the
[59:42] heart. I say I saw you under the tree
[59:45] before before uh uh uh Philip call
[59:48] you. Peter come he says you are a son of
[59:55] Jonah. I believe those were just few
[59:58] that were recorded for
[1:00:02] us. But that that was the kind of a a a
[1:00:07] manifestation that was grabbing the
[1:00:10] hearts of the
[1:00:12] elite which is the sign of the Messiah.
[1:00:14] Let's read this and uh uh we will settle
[1:00:17] down somewhere here. When the son of man
[1:00:19] is revealed,
[1:00:21] not no more as a
[1:00:24] church. See not no more the bride is
[1:00:28] called. See in that day the son of man
[1:00:32] will be revealed. What? To join the head
[1:00:38] the the church to the
[1:00:41] head unite the marish of the lamb. So
[1:00:45] which mean is the
[1:00:48] revelation of the son of man when that
[1:00:51] ministry is being identified. It will go
[1:00:54] beyond healing the
[1:00:57] sick. It will go beyond great healing
[1:01:00] campaign. It will get to the place where
[1:01:03] it will be uniting the the the
[1:01:08] the church to the groom. It will be
[1:01:11] uniting the bride and the groom.
[1:01:15] Amen. So that is the reason why if you
[1:01:19] see uh uh uh uh in brother Brandon
[1:01:22] ministry he had to have three pools
[1:01:25] here. The first one was a healing
[1:01:27] ministry. The second one was
[1:01:29] discernment. The third is what we call
[1:01:31] the opening of the word. That's the real
[1:01:34] thing.
[1:01:37] Now remember, Paul told us in Hebrew
[1:01:41] chapter 4 that the word of God is
[1:01:43] sharper than a two-edged
[1:01:45] sword. Amen. Discerning the intents of
[1:01:50] the heart. So whenever that ministry
[1:01:54] that goes to discerning the intent of
[1:01:57] the heart that goes between the the
[1:01:59] dividing aunder of the spirit and the
[1:02:02] soul to be able to tell us where you
[1:02:05] know our our our struggle is our
[1:02:08] weakness is and bring us back to where
[1:02:11] we supposed to be. You have to know. I
[1:02:14] mean, uh, uh, uh, uh, we we we saw some
[1:02:17] of those things or heard some of them on
[1:02:19] brother Brandham in the tape, but Paul
[1:02:22] is letting us know that is it's the word
[1:02:25] that does it. It's the word that
[1:02:30] descend. Just like how John will say, in
[1:02:33] the beginning was the word, and the word
[1:02:35] was with God, and the word took on flesh
[1:02:40] and became man.
[1:02:42] Are we together? So we want to keep in
[1:02:45] our mind that it is the word is is is
[1:02:48] the word that is using the body of a
[1:02:52] man. It's the word that is using the
[1:02:54] ministry of a man to be able to address
[1:02:57] our
[1:02:59] need. Praise the Lord. It's not the man.
[1:03:02] It's the word that is used in the body.
[1:03:06] Are we together
[1:03:11] now? So he says here now to do what? To
[1:03:14] join the church to the head. Unite the
[1:03:16] marriage of the lamb. Now so yeah,
[1:03:18] brother Brandon will use church and
[1:03:20] bride intertwining. Amen. So I mean uh
[1:03:24] uh let's not let's not confuse that. So
[1:03:27] let's let's read on it a little bit
[1:03:29] again. The bridegroom call will come
[1:03:32] right through this. The bridegroom call
[1:03:35] will come right through what? The son of
[1:03:38] man
[1:03:40] ministry. Praise the Lord. The
[1:03:43] bridegroom call will come through the
[1:03:45] revealing of the son of man. The
[1:03:48] bridegroom call do not come through the
[1:03:51] healing
[1:03:53] ministry. Are we together? Amen. The
[1:03:57] bridegroom call comes through the
[1:04:00] revealing of the son of man.
[1:04:08] The bridegroom call will come right
[1:04:10] through this. When the son of man will
[1:04:13] come down and come in him of flesh to
[1:04:18] unite the two
[1:04:20] together. Praise the Lord. Amen. To
[1:04:24] unite the bride and the groom. Now, so
[1:04:28] this son of man ministry is going to be
[1:04:31] the marriage
[1:04:37] officer because every wedding must have
[1:04:40] a marriage
[1:04:43] officer. So that's why he's letting us
[1:04:45] know that the son of man
[1:04:48] ministry is going to unite the two of
[1:04:52] them together, the bride and the groom.
[1:04:57] Are we together?
[1:05:03] The church has to be the word. He is the
[1:05:07] word and the two unite
[1:05:11] together. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:15] Amen. Not following our creeds and our
[1:05:18] dogma.
[1:05:20] That's the reason why that ministry had
[1:05:23] to come with the opening of the word
[1:05:25] with with uh h revealing the secret the
[1:05:29] mystery behind uh uh uh the serpent sea
[1:05:33] the mystery of water baptism the truth
[1:05:36] of internal security. All of those
[1:05:39] things had to be preached to
[1:05:42] us because those were the things that
[1:05:45] were left out in in in in uh in the
[1:05:48] reformation.
[1:05:50] Now you have to understand under the
[1:05:52] reformation when Luther came out with a
[1:05:56] message that the just shall live by
[1:05:58] faith he was breaking away from
[1:06:02] capitalism. Amen. He had a message the
[1:06:06] just shall live by faith. He were not
[1:06:08] teaching
[1:06:09] mystery.
[1:06:10] Amen. What his emphasis was on that we
[1:06:14] don't need nothing like
[1:06:16] purgatory. Praise the Lord. We have to
[1:06:19] believe in what Jesus Christ did. There
[1:06:22] is nothing physical we can do. Bleed our
[1:06:25] knees, beat ourself, whip ourself. He He
[1:06:29] was trying to bring the church out of
[1:06:32] that. Let's get out of the system. Let's
[1:06:36] look to Jesus Christ.
[1:06:39] Are we
[1:06:46] together now? So we see here the church
[1:06:49] has to be the
[1:06:51] word
[1:06:53] because her husband is the
[1:06:57] word. Are we
[1:07:01] together? She has to be it has to be the
[1:07:05] word. It is not enough when is just what
[1:07:08] the pastor say. It's not enough or it is
[1:07:11] just what our church believe. It must be
[1:07:13] the word.
[1:07:18] Are we
[1:07:23] together? Because our mate is the word.
[1:07:27] We have to be flesh of his flesh, bone
[1:07:30] of his bone, spirit of his spirit. Are
[1:07:35] we together? Amen. So the church has to
[1:07:38] be the word. He is the word. And the two
[1:07:41] unite together. When we close this up,
[1:07:44] you will you will appreciate it. You
[1:07:46] will enjoy it. To do that, it will take
[1:07:49] the manifestation of the revealing of
[1:07:53] the son of man. Not just a clergy, not
[1:07:56] just a good
[1:07:59] preacher. It will have to take the
[1:08:02] revealing of a son of man
[1:08:08] ministry. Are we together?
[1:08:12] A good preacher can bring us down to
[1:08:14] water baptism. A good preacher can
[1:08:17] preach hell so hard that you can be
[1:08:19] afraid to go to hell.
[1:08:27] But for us to get down to this
[1:08:31] place of being prepared to be a
[1:08:35] bride to the
[1:08:37] bridegroom, God has to send
[1:08:40] us which he has done a ministry that
[1:08:44] will open that will take the veil of
[1:08:46] tradition from our
[1:08:48] eyes. Praise the Lord. The word will be
[1:08:52] esteemed highly than our church. The
[1:08:55] word will be esteemed highly than our
[1:09:01] pastor. Are we
[1:09:05] together? Not a clergic. It would take
[1:09:07] the manifestation of the revealing of
[1:09:11] the son of
[1:09:13] man. Are we
[1:09:15] together? Do you see what I mean? See,
[1:09:19] it is the son of man. Jesus Christ will
[1:09:22] come down in human flesh among us and
[1:09:27] will make his word so
[1:09:29] real that it will unite the church and
[1:09:33] him as
[1:09:39] one. Are we
[1:09:41] together?
[1:09:43] Amen. The son of man Jesus Christ will
[1:09:47] come. That that is the promise of St.
[1:09:50] Luke
[1:09:52] 17:30. Amen. He will take a him of
[1:10:01] flesh and he will make the word so real
[1:10:05] to us. Are we together?
[1:10:12] And that that revealing of the
[1:10:17] word will unite
[1:10:20] us. That re that revealing of the word
[1:10:23] will capture our
[1:10:27] hearts. Praise the Lord. That revealing
[1:10:30] of the word will make us to fall in
[1:10:33] love. that look at the the a type here
[1:10:36] of
[1:10:37] Eliza going to get
[1:10:41] Rebecca. Praise the Lord. Amen. When he
[1:10:45] head out there to get Rebecca and uh uh
[1:10:49] uh uh she was asking him lot of question
[1:10:53] about this
[1:10:55] Isaac. Now you have to realize that he
[1:10:58] was the messenger. His work was not to
[1:11:02] fall in love with Rebecca or make
[1:11:05] Rebecca love him.
[1:11:09] You see the son of man ministry. You see
[1:11:11] the ministry when a body will be
[1:11:15] borrowed. When brother Brandham said
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ will have to come down and
[1:11:19] take human flesh and reveal the son of
[1:11:23] man. Praise the Lord. Lea work was not
[1:11:28] to fall in love with Rebecca or make
[1:11:30] Rebecca to love him. Everything that he
[1:11:34] said how to magnify Isaac.
[1:11:40] Praise the Lord. She has to believe that
[1:11:44] this man can solve her problem. She has
[1:11:46] to believe that if I having 10 H came,
[1:11:51] he having thousand.
[1:11:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:00] Yet he was the
[1:12:02] messenger trying to uh h
[1:12:07] uh bring uh uh uh Rebecca to
[1:12:12] Isaac. But he had a message that would
[1:12:16] make her to fall in love with Isaac.
[1:12:22] Not to make her to fall in love with
[1:12:26] himself. Are we
[1:12:31] together? Let's go down a little bit.
[1:12:34] Not a clergy. It will take the
[1:12:36] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:12:38] son of man. Not a clergy. Do you see
[1:12:40] what I mean? Is the son of man Jesus
[1:12:42] Christ will come down in him of flesh
[1:12:45] among us. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:49] and will make his word so real that it
[1:12:53] will unite the church and him as one,
[1:12:56] the bride. So you see he's using church
[1:12:59] bride here. So just just understand
[1:13:03] there. And then she will go home to the
[1:13:07] wedding
[1:13:10] supper. If she will go home to the
[1:13:12] wedding supper, then when was the
[1:13:14] wedding?
[1:13:18] Praise the Lord. The wedding is the
[1:13:25] uniting. Praise the Lord. Amen. The
[1:13:29] wedding is the uniting time. When the
[1:13:32] bride is uniting with the
[1:13:35] word, when the bride is is falling in
[1:13:38] love with the word, she wants to find
[1:13:40] her place in the word. She want the word
[1:13:43] to have preeeminence in her life.
[1:13:48] So it's not just joining the church and
[1:13:50] that says I'm in a message church.
[1:13:56] No, this word is our lover. That's our
[1:14:00] bridegroom.
[1:14:03] How are we treating the word in our
[1:14:05] life?
[1:14:11] So that uniting time, that uniting with
[1:14:14] the word is the marriage that is going
[1:14:16] on. So the marriage is going on right
[1:14:21] now. Praise the
[1:14:25] Lord. We are uniting with the word.
[1:14:28] Every time we are in church, we are
[1:14:30] uniting with the word every time the
[1:14:32] spirit is speaking to our hearts.
[1:14:35] Every time God is dealing with you on
[1:14:37] something, what is your
[1:14:40] reaction? What is your
[1:14:51] attitude? Praise the Lord.
[1:14:56] You see, and and and and that is the
[1:14:58] thing I say to people all the time, you
[1:15:00] know, uh uh uh uh uh we we look over to
[1:15:03] to our our wedding day, you know, and
[1:15:06] and the emphasis is put on the wedding,
[1:15:08] you know, and you know, we plan for it
[1:15:09] and all of
[1:15:12] that. But after the wedding, that's when
[1:15:14] the marriage really
[1:15:17] starts. Amen. because you have just this
[1:15:20] short window of cold shape you know and
[1:15:23] in cold shape you are just managing you
[1:15:25] know you don't want to really lost this
[1:15:27] person I really love them you are just
[1:15:29] managing you are on your best
[1:15:33] behavior but when the veil comes
[1:15:36] down and you have to live
[1:15:39] together you realize the marriage is an
[1:15:43] ongoing
[1:15:45] thing the marriage of the lamb is an
[1:15:47] ongoing
[1:15:49] think. Praise the Lord. When we
[1:15:51] disappoint him, we fail him, we come
[1:15:53] back, we say, "Lord, have mercy on me.
[1:15:55] I'm wrong. Help me, Lord, to be better."
[1:16:04] Are we
[1:16:14] together? Do you see what I mean? The
[1:16:16] son of man, Jesus Christ, will come down
[1:16:19] in in a human flesh among us and will
[1:16:22] make his word so real that it will unite
[1:16:26] the church in him as one, the bride. And
[1:16:30] she will go home to the wedding
[1:16:33] supper. See, she's already
[1:16:37] united. See, we will go to the wedding
[1:16:41] supper, not to the marriage.
[1:16:45] We are not going to the marriage. Why?
[1:16:48] Because the marriage is taking place
[1:16:50] here. When that son of man ministry is
[1:16:53] revealed to you is not just to magnify
[1:16:56] brother Brandham is to fall in love with
[1:16:59] the word.
[1:17:07] Are we
[1:17:09] together? Because look at the three four
[1:17:12] purpose. The first one was
[1:17:17] what? To have preeeminence in a
[1:17:20] man. The second one was what? Have
[1:17:23] preeminence in a woman, which is the
[1:17:26] bride, the church. And the third is
[1:17:29] what? Take both of them back to
[1:17:36] Eden. So God used the
[1:17:41] prophets, the Old Testament
[1:17:44] to pre to prepare himself a body to
[1:17:47] dwell in to make a man to find a man he
[1:17:51] got a David he got a Moses he got a
[1:17:53] Joseph all in types he show a little
[1:17:56] year he show a little when Christ came
[1:17:59] this was the body where the fullness
[1:18:01] will dwell in God got Adam back that's
[1:18:05] why he's called the second
[1:18:07] Adam now God had to go through a seven
[1:18:10] church ages to get second Eve Eve to get
[1:18:14] Eve back to her
[1:18:16] place. Are we
[1:18:20] together? Am I putting you to
[1:18:23] sleep? Okay, let's just try to close on
[1:18:26] this
[1:18:27] now. The subject is even becoming more
[1:18:31] sweeter to me. Amen. As I'm talking
[1:18:33] about
[1:18:36] it, he says, "She's already united. See,
[1:18:39] we go to the wedding supper, not to the
[1:18:41] marriage, because the marriage of the
[1:18:44] lamb has come.
[1:18:48] Praise the Lord. The marriage of the
[1:18:51] lamb has
[1:18:54] come. But the rapture is going to the
[1:18:58] wedding
[1:19:00] supper. When the word year unite with
[1:19:04] the person, when the word year that is
[1:19:07] being preached to you, the word year
[1:19:09] that you hear on tapes, the word year
[1:19:12] that you read in the
[1:19:15] Bible, when that
[1:19:18] word year unite with the
[1:19:21] person and they two become
[1:19:25] one and then what does that do?
[1:19:29] They manifest the son of man again.
[1:19:36] Praise the Lord. Why? Because this bride
[1:19:40] is going to be what? Christ in bride
[1:19:42] form.
[1:19:45] She's going to be Christ in bride
[1:19:54] form. Are we
[1:19:56] together? Amen.
[1:19:59] So you see young people as we get ready
[1:20:02] for the rapture is not just uh you know
[1:20:06] uh uh uh trying to be a nice uh uh young
[1:20:10] man in church or the nice young lady in
[1:20:12] church. No, we must we must we must
[1:20:14] gravitate to this
[1:20:16] word. Amen. We must fall in love with
[1:20:20] this word. Don't wait to come to church
[1:20:22] before you read your
[1:20:24] Bible. Fall in love and start loving the
[1:20:27] word. Let let it just be a feeling in
[1:20:30] your heart that you can't go a day
[1:20:32] without the word.
[1:20:39] Are we together?
[1:20:44] Because you see even in the natural when
[1:20:46] you have uh uh you have a young man and
[1:20:48] a young woman in courtship and they they
[1:20:51] are just being together every day. What
[1:20:53] you know they are just together every
[1:20:55] day. I mean the the preachers said no we
[1:20:56] got to marry these people because it's
[1:20:58] becoming
[1:20:59] dangerous. They can explode any time.
[1:21:02] Are we
[1:21:05] together? Amen. We we got to we we got
[1:21:08] to do their wedding. We if if it
[1:21:10] happened before me I'm calling I'm
[1:21:12] calling for a wedding
[1:21:15] quick. I mean I'm seeing you all over
[1:21:17] the every shopping mall I go I see you
[1:21:19] people and I mean you are just all over
[1:21:21] the place. We let's just marry you so
[1:21:23] you can go and live together.
[1:21:29] Now, so you see that's that's what I'm
[1:21:30] trying to talk
[1:21:32] about. That's the marriage of the
[1:21:35] lamb. That's the marriage of the
[1:21:40] lamb. He whispers to you every time you
[1:21:43] read the word.
[1:21:46] Praise the Lord. He tells you how he
[1:21:48] love you. He tells you what he want you
[1:21:51] to straighten up. He makes you to
[1:21:53] identify things in your life without the
[1:21:57] preacher saying it
[1:22:02] because you are not falling in love with
[1:22:04] the preacher. You falling in love with
[1:22:06] this man that knows everything about
[1:22:08] you. Hebrews say all your ways are naked
[1:22:12] in his eyes. It's to him that we have to
[1:22:15] do.
[1:22:19] That's where the challenge comes. You
[1:22:21] know, we can we can celebrate, you know,
[1:22:23] the messenger. We can we can celebrate.
[1:22:26] Brother Brandham talks about the
[1:22:27] supernatural. But brother Brandham
[1:22:29] ministry was the ministry of the
[1:22:32] marriage officer.
[1:22:34] His ministry was the ministry of Eliza.
[1:22:39] Not for us to love him, for us to
[1:22:42] appreciate him and love our mate, which
[1:22:45] is Christ.
[1:22:48] That was the purpose of his ministry.
[1:22:54] Are we falling in love with
[1:23:01] Christ? That's your marriage of the
[1:23:05] lamb. That's your marriage of the
[1:23:08] lamb. And it's going on right
[1:23:12] now. Praise the
[1:23:14] Lord. Amen. The Lord bless you as we
[1:23:18] change the order of the service. Let's
[1:23:21] bow our heads
[1:23:27] together. When the word year unites with
[1:23:30] a person and the two becomes one and
[1:23:34] then what does that do? It manifests the
[1:23:37] son of man again. Not the church
[1:23:40] theologian. The son of man, the word and
[1:23:43] the church becomes one. Whatever the son
[1:23:46] of man
[1:23:47] done, he was the word. The church does
[1:23:51] the same. The bride will do the
[1:24:02] same. I love you too much to feel you
[1:24:05] now. Let's sing that
[1:24:07] together. They can put the words up for
[1:24:10] us. Let's sing it together before we bow
[1:24:12] our heads.
[1:24:15] I love you too

[1:26:59] Lord, I love you too much.
[1:27:04] Lord, to faith.
[1:27:08] Now one more time. Now I love you too
[1:27:15] much to
[1:27:17] fear you
[1:27:20] now.
[1:27:23] Too
[1:27:26] much to break my vow.
[1:27:32] I
[1:27:33] promise the Lord that I will make it
[1:27:41] somehow. Oh, I

[1:29:09] Jesus was the best thing
[1:29:14] I ever ever thought.
[1:29:19] [Music]
[1:29:23] In his
[1:29:25] word, I
[1:29:27] feel
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:32] protected. In his
[1:29:35] word, I'm never disconnected.
[1:29:43] in his
[1:29:45] word. I
[1:29:47] feel protected. Oh Lord, there's no
[1:29:52] place that
[1:29:54] I rather
[1:30:02] be. In his
[1:30:05] presence I
[1:30:07] feel
[1:30:11] protected. In his
[1:30:14] presence I'm never
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:21] disconnected. In his
[1:30:24] presence I
[1:30:26] feel protected.
[1:30:30] There's no place that
[1:30:32] I I'd rather be falling in love with
[1:30:37] Jesus. Let's lift our hands to him
[1:30:40] tonight. Falling in
[1:30:43] love with Jesus.
[1:30:51] Falling in
[1:30:53] love with Jesus.
[1:31:00] Oh, falling in
[1:31:03] love with my
[1:31:09] Jesus. The best thing that I've had that
[1:31:13] I've ever

[1:31:25] Jesus. Let's bow our heads. Let's pray

[1:31:29] Let's express our love to him. I don't
[1:31:31] know how you feel in your heart
[1:31:34] tonight. I don't know if you are feeling
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] disconnected, but his arms are wide
[1:31:45] open. His love is ever around
[1:31:48] [Music]

[1:32:03] Jesus, we love you tonight. We
[1:32:05] appreciate you, Lord. We love you,
[1:32:08] Father. I pray to God that Lord
[1:32:13] Jesus, I took more time than I wanted
[1:32:16] to, Father, Lord, but I just pray that
[1:32:18] God, you
[1:32:19] will amplify your word to the hearts of
[1:32:22] your people, Lord God. May we see Lord
[1:32:25] the the love of affair that is going on.
[1:32:27] It's not a church affair. It's a love
[1:32:31] affair. No matter what church we go to,
[1:32:34] we can flip them. We can change them.
[1:32:37] But we have to be in love with the
[1:32:40] word. That's what matters. That's what
[1:32:42] we are called
[1:32:43] [Music]
[1:32:45] to. This is not a society. It's not a
[1:32:50] cult. This is a love affair. This is a
[1:32:53] love
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:33:01] relationship. You have to love the
[1:33:04] word. You have to love the word in
[1:33:07] action. You have to love the word in
[1:33:11] words.
[1:33:13] Father, capture our heart tonight.
[1:33:17] Lord, if we are feeling disconnected,
[1:33:20] Lord, you can you can connect with us
[1:33:23] tonight. Oh, Father God, Lord Jesus, we
[1:33:28] can go back, Lord, and renew our vow
[1:33:30] with you,
[1:33:33] Lord, because you are coming for a word
[1:33:37] bride. You are coming, the word is
[1:33:39] coming to connect with the word and
[1:33:41] takes the word out of this earth.
[1:33:44] [Music]
[1:33:53] Father, we love you tonight. We
[1:33:55] appreciate you. We appreciate you, oh
[1:34:00] God. Help us, Lord
[1:34:04] Jesus. Have the preeminence, Lord.
[1:34:06] Father, in our lives. Let the word have
[1:34:09] a preeminence in our home.
[1:34:12] Have the preeminence, Lord, in this
[1:34:13] assembly. Lord, let it be the word. A
[1:34:17] good idea is not enough to put your
[1:34:19] people in the rapture.
[1:34:21] Lord, no matter how many good ideas we
[1:34:24] come up with, it has to be the
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:31] word. We have seen, we have identified
[1:34:33] the manifestation of the son of man
[1:34:36] ministry. We know that God, father, you
[1:34:38] took that ministry to brother Brandham.
[1:34:40] Lord. Oh God, Father, Lord, and and and
[1:34:44] oh Jesus, it it it captured our hearts,
[1:34:46] Lord. But God, now we want to fall in
[1:34:49] love with
[1:34:51] you. We want to fall in love with you.
[1:34:54] We want it to be something that we feel,
[1:34:57] Lord. We feel
[1:34:59] it. It's not just a statement.
[1:35:06] And because we are in love with
[1:35:08] you, we wash our tongues. We wash the
[1:35:12] thoughts that goes through our mind. We
[1:35:14] wash the things we gave our eyes to.
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:30] Father, we come in tonight, Lord, and
[1:35:32] say, "Forgive us of all of
[1:35:34] our transgressions, Lord. All of our sin
[1:35:37] and our iniquity, Lord God." Father, I
[1:35:41] confess mine and I confess the sin of

[1:46:07] control. I feel the
[1:46:17] poor. While the music plays softly
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:38] to give my
[1:46:44] Lord. He speaks to
[1:46:50] me. Lord and I
[1:46:58] agree. Lord please come and take
[1:47:04] control. I
[1:47:06] feel the
[1:47:10] poor for I receive of the Lord that
[1:47:13] which I also deliver unto
[1:47:16] you. That the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:47:19] in which he was betrayed took
[1:47:22] bread and when he had given thanks, he
[1:47:24] break it and said, "Eat, take, eat. This
[1:47:28] is my body which is broken for you. This
[1:47:32] do in remembrance of me. After the same
[1:47:35] manner also he took the cup when he hath
[1:47:39] s this
[1:47:41] is the new testament of my blood. This
[1:47:45] do ye as of as ye drink it in
[1:47:48] remembrance of
[1:47:50] me. For as often as ye eat this bread
[1:47:53] and drink this cup yet do show the
[1:47:55] Lord's death till he comes. Wherefore
[1:47:58] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:48:00] this cup of the Lord unwartily shall be
[1:48:05] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[1:48:10] Lord. But let a man examine
[1:48:13] himself and so let him
[1:48:15] eat of this bread and drink that
[1:48:21] cup. For he that eateth and drinketh of
[1:48:24] water eat it and drinketh damnation to
[1:48:26] himself for not discerning the Lord's
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:46] body. John
[1:48:49] 13:2 after supper being ended, the devil
[1:48:53] having now put in the heart of Judas as
[1:48:57] Simon's son to betray him. Jesus knowing
[1:49:00] that the father had given all things
[1:49:02] into his hands and that he was come from
[1:49:06] God and went to God, he rised from
[1:49:09] supper and lay aside his garment and and
[1:49:12] took a towel and g himself. After that,
[1:49:16] he pou water in the basin and be to wash
[1:49:19] the disciples feet and to wet them with
[1:49:23] the
[1:49:24] [Music]
[1:49:32] towel wherewith he was given. Then come
[1:49:36] he to Simon Peter, and Peter said unto
[1:49:38] him, Lord, does thou wash my feet? And
[1:49:40] Jesus answered and said unto him, "What
[1:49:43] I do, thou
[1:49:45] knowest, not now, but thou shalt know
[1:49:48] yet after." Peter said unto him, "Thou
[1:49:51] shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[1:49:53] answered him, "If I wash thee now, thou
[1:49:55] have no part with me." So Simon Peter
[1:49:58] said unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
[1:50:02] but also my hands and my head. Jesus
[1:50:04] said unto him, "He that is washed
[1:50:07] needeth not safe to wash his feet, but
[1:50:10] is clean
[1:50:12] everywhere. And ye are clean, but not
[1:50:18] all." For he knew who should betray him.
[1:50:22] Therefore he said, "Ye are not all
[1:50:24] clean."
[1:50:26] So after he have washed their feet and
[1:50:28] have taken his garment, he was sat down
[1:50:32] again and said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:50:34] I have done to you, ye call me master
[1:50:37] and lord, and ye say well for so I am.
[1:50:41] If I then your lord and master have
[1:50:43] washed your feet, ye also ought to wash
[1:50:47] one another feet. For I have given you
[1:50:51] an example that ye should do as I have
[1:50:54] done to you. Verily, verily, I said unto
[1:50:57] you, the servant is not greater than his
[1:50:59] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[1:51:02] than he that sent him. If you know these
[1:51:06] things, happy are you if you do them. I
[1:51:10] speak not of you all. I know whom I have
[1:51:16] chosen, but that the scripture may be
[1:51:19] fulfilled. He that eatth bread with me
[1:51:24] has lifted up his head against me.
[1:51:26] Praise the Lord. Let's just stop right
[1:51:31] here.
[1:51:32] Oh, rocketed cross.
[1:51:37] [Music]
[1:51:44] This song is for the crown. Let's sing
[1:51:49] the first verse to that song. On a hill,
[1:51:51] far
[1:51:53] away. On the
[1:51:56] hill, far
[1:51:59] away. Stood
[1:52:02] by rugged
[1:52:06] cross. God
[1:52:09] amling all of
[1:52:12] suffering and shame.
[1:52:20] And I
[1:52:21] love that old
[1:52:25] cross where the
[1:52:28] dear rest and
[1:52:31] dance our
[1:52:33] word of love.
[1:52:37] Ser was
[1:52:41] slave. Oh yes.
[1:52:44] Oh, I
[1:52:46] cherish the old of
[1:52:54] ke till my
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:02] draw down. Yes, Lord.
[1:53:07] Oh, I will
[1:53:10] cling to the old
[1:53:13] rocket
[1:53:18] cross and there's
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] changes for the crowd. Let's bow our
[1:53:28] heads. Heavenly Father, we lift this
[1:53:31] board up to you, Lord God. Lay in a
[1:53:34] fire, Lord God. It's a piece of bread,
[1:53:38] Lord God, that was baked with prayers,
[1:53:41] Lord, Father, Almighty God. Lord God, it
[1:53:44] represent your body. We lift it to you
[1:53:46] tonight. And we ask that, Father, you
[1:53:49] bless it as you will break it into many
[1:53:51] pieces tonight, oh God. Oh Father, all
[1:53:54] of those pieces will represent the needs
[1:53:57] that are in this assembly. All of the
[1:53:59] pieces, oh Father God, will represent
[1:54:01] the needs in our life. All of the
[1:54:04] pieces, Lord Jesus Christ will
[1:54:06] represent, oh
[1:54:07] God, our desire for you,
[1:54:12] Father. I pray that God you bless it as
[1:54:15] we identify ourself with it tonight.
[1:54:17] Lord, we stand in a gap, Lord God, for
[1:54:20] even those that are not yet with us
[1:54:22] tonight.
[1:54:23] Father, we love you. We appreciate
[1:54:26] you in Jesus name.
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:55:48] Heavenly
[1:55:49] Father, we lift this
[1:55:52] board up in your hands tonight, Lord.
[1:55:56] Father, in this
[1:55:57] board there are many cups, Lord
[1:56:01] Jesus, that represent our
[1:56:04] hearts. As we sing the song, Fill My
[1:56:07] Cup,
[1:56:08] Lord, I lift it
[1:56:10] up. We lift these cups to you that you
[1:56:13] bless it
[1:56:15] tonight. Oh God, see the need in our
[1:56:19] life. See the desire in our hearts,
[1:56:22] Lord. See the want for you.
[1:56:26] Oh God, we pray Lord as we come and
[1:56:29] partake of it tonight. Oh God,
