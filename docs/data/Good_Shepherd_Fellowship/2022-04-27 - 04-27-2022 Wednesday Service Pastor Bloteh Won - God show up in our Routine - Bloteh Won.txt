right in that scripture praise the lord i just want to share something little tonight there is one prayer request that i forgot to mention and that is that you pray for me i will be traveling this weekend i shall be leaving tomorrow over to the uk for meetings this weekend so just pray for me i should be back next week by the grace of god amen so just keeping in your prayers amen there is something that is taking place here in st john it's in luke chapter four i said luke chapter 4 amen and [Music] i know that i saw the the tech team back there trying to to work on some some other things and uh [Music] and i pray that lord will be able to give them grace praise the lord while we are singing in and and everything they are putting the songs off to sleep singing sinking trying to also work that those that are following the service online will will also sink into the service so i mean there are just a lot of things that is happening in the background praise the lord amen so uh we we want to be grateful that uh the lord has given us such brothers and sisters to serve us amen now now uh san luca chapter four we know one of the big scenes the scripture set set up with jesus uh uh you know been in the wilderness uh where he fasted for 40 days and he's been tempted by the devil and he left from there and he went straight into the the the synagogues and now and that part of the scripture is very very very uh uh uh very very interesting to us very very important to us because we saw jesus right there going to uh identify his ministry by opening the scripture finding the a place in the bible and identifying his ministry and telling the congregation that this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears so i will read from verse 20 and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogues were fasting on him and he began to say it unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and all beg him witness and wander at the gracious word which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son and he said unto them yahweh surely said unto me this proverb physician healed that self whatsoever we have heard done in companion do also here in that country and he said now this is where i want for us to study a little bit tonight i want to pick up from where we left on sunday but i just want to go in a little direction to encourage you tonight and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country but i tell you the truth many widows were in israel in the day of elias when the heavens was shot up three years and six months when great farming was throughout all the land but unto none of them was elias sent self their seraphtide as cited in freedom onto a woman that was a widow and many lepers was in israel in the time of elizabeth the prophet and none of them was clean said neman the syrian and all day in the synagogues when the hair distance were filled with raft and rose up and trust him out of the city and led him on to unto the blood of the hell where on praise the lord their city was built that they might cast him down hello but he passed through the midst of them went his way dear lord jesus bless this portion of the word i pray that you will bring something out of it tonight that we will be instructed in righteousness something that will encourage our heart father that will not just only become be a hair knowledge lord but it will be a revelation in our heart to give us strength to be able to walk with you in such an evil age in such a doubtful age in such a gloomy day lord we need it father bless us together now in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seat i'll take a little bible studies here before i get into now there's there's one thing that caught my attention uh sunday while we were we were uh uh studying together and uh it really did not caught my attention when i was studying personally but when i was preaching then then it caught my attention praise the lord and and the thing that caught my attention uh uh was this uh we read on sunday from the message bombing gila and brother branham said this it caught my attention while i was preaching and he said the one thing we have to move up to now is a suffering faith to what to what we have had you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you are doing and just like i said it's not just only when you want to pray for somebody or you want to ask god for something is knowing what we are doing in in in our life amen in every aspect of our life we must we must know what we are doing and and he says here he says uh when you understand uh you walk just you just say well i'm going home i'm going out and i start my car that's all out of faith tomorrow i will meet you at a setting place that's all out of faith because you have done it so much it is a regular routine with you now that that was that was what caught my attention how god is in our regular routine praise the lord you know as as i'm going to read a few courses tonight on regular routine as you know as as christians as as believers you know uh uh uh down through the church ages you know uh many many have taught that uh uh you know there is there is one form of life for church and there is one form of life when we are out in the world and out and about you know and and you know uh subconsciously people gear into that without ignoring praise the lord the gear right into that let me read something to you as i would just as i'm just trying to to move forward here tonight uh uh verb says in a message jesus on the authority of the word he says now i have prayed for thousands of people just as a routine of praying for people but yet i don't know what's going to happen until he showed me he showed me what's going to happen then i have thou said the lord then the lord has brought the word inc in confirmation then i know now but uh what what i what caught my mind here as i was thinking about this he said i have prayed for thousands of people just as a a routine of praying for people now uh uh uh and and you find out that uh you know uh uh uh and even as you're listening on the tip and and you see that brother brandon people comes in the prayer line you know he he either hold them by their shoulder on their shoulders and he just pray for them but you'll realize that sometimes people try to to get it you know you know and and they try to look for that that spiritual voice you know uh [Music] lord jesus a father you know and and i mean i mean sometimes you do this you just grieve the holy spirit but it's thousands of people i've just prayed a regular regular routine of praying for people just a regular way that i would pray there is not a there is not a special way to pray while blessing my food and then when i know it's a sick person then i got to be serious praise the lord god is in our regular routine the scripture i said two will be on the field one will be taken one will be left two will be at the mill two will be in bed those are just the regular things of life that we do praise the lord so you see that that mentality of where people think you know oh it's church time i had to i have to put on my church clothes and and then they put on their church spirit and put on their church attitude it has robbed the church over and over of its power you think about it if if the church through the ages has just been living on the expectation every meaning of our life living honor expectation where we will be in faith he's in the regular routine of our life that's not just a few things i want to share to you tonight that's what caught my mind brother bam says he says here he says down he says no i don't know of all things he says look at john when he saw the vision out on the outside of patmos and so forth see what i mean he fell down before the angel feet and probably that was a routine of the day his daily routine praise the lord amen when the angel appeared to manoa and his wife they were now wearing suit they were not wearing their sunday clothes they were not wearing their their special clothes for worship they were just doing their daily thing amen are we together praise the lord i'll come back to my scripture i'm just i'm just trying to grab your spirit tonight whatever he said unto you do it sometimes it might seems like if you see something different we got a regular routine he says he says christianity has we just have to stay right in their routine amen all we are not christians this is that thing of putting on you know our our our religious clothes i mean that's that's where the word pharisees came from you know when brother brahman says pharisees mean atos that's that's what it came from and god don't want us to be actors he wants us to be lifeless stones amen he want us to be living money man he's in our daily routine he's in our daily routine oh if the law can just can just drop us into this because he said i will never leave you i will never forsake you amen i will always be with you now he says this one also in the message ikea let me let me take this and then i will go into what i want to share with you tonight a few days ago when when it looks like that maybe he wouldn't arrive just right and things look like was all against us the opposition is usually just dark as before day you know that's the regular routine of human that's the regular routine of human so when things are getting worse we can expect that it will get better because it's the regular routine of humans god have always walked that way [Music] but you see when things are getting worse then we get frustrated then we are overwhelmed with our frustration praise the lord when it is just the time that he is about to step on the scene [Laughter] praise the lord that is the regular routine of humans praise the lord amen just like brother branham says uh uh uh uh seed of this trip and said he says we must we must live our life our everyday life we must we must be people that are in are that that are honor you know a desperation talking about applying the talking he says but but when do we wait to get desperate when there is an emergency situation he says that's what we wait for what make us to do that way it's our falling nature our fallen nature has has has uh has uh oriented us in a way that we wait for things to become you know uh uh in in in in honor of a kind of an emergency situation then we get desperate then we want to make things to happen when we when we're supposed to be living an everyday life of desperation their everyday life on our expectation praise the lord taking sides with jesus brother branham said he said he says those old testament scenes he said those old testament saints they will come up in the resurrection he said because every one of them when paul was preaching about the rapture paul never said they're in the future no he said they're without us so they all preach about the rapture as if it would happen in their time they were looking for that to happen so they died with that expectation so brother brahms says they are going to rise up with the sin anticipation because they went down with it that's why we bring the old testament things out all all the sins of the ages the sins of all the ages because they thought just imagine those people that were burned at the stake in order that they thought that it was in their time that was the thing that gave them faith for them to be able to hold to the word honor the condition that they were living praise the lord amen so god shows up in our daily routine amen when he wanted to meet the woman at the way he never went for the best moment of her life he waited for the moment where she just sneaked out that was her routine she watched the time realizing that i have to get down and get my my water quickly because i can mingle out with those women and you know i don't want anybody talking about me or asking me questions and all of that and that was just the best time that he needed to meet her praise the lord that's just the best time he want to use us in in the grocery store he want to use you i mean a pushing cotton and talking to somebody in in the mechanics store or wherever it is though those are the places where the lord loved to be he just he just don't like these four walls called church he likes outside he created outside praise the lord that kind of forgot my mind but that caught my mind it had me thinking since wednesday i've been thinking about it so i had to say something about it it's been ministering to me how god shows up in our routine praise the lord even you just you just take you just you just take a a good inventory of your life you realize that he shows up in your routine praise the lord sometimes it's just when you are just there washing dishes that something just strikes you he just shows up praise the lord sometimes some of the silly things you do he just shows up something just just speaks to your mind and you sit right there fighting your nails he's a peculiar god let's get to the word tonight amen i just i have five minutes to preach to you so let's let's get to the word tonight now there is there is something here that is that is interesting there is something here that is interesting i was going to i was going to go over from the book of daniel tonight and what i wanted to to to pick up was uh the the the the nebuchadnezzar image uh which of course uh god gave the king nebuchadnezzar that dream to be able to show to him what would represent the gentile kingdom and we know this is the kingdom of of of uh uh babylon and we know it is is the medes and and the persian we know also is is the kingdom of the greeks and we also know uh he end up in the leg which is the roman kingdom praise the lord and by bible prophecy by the word of the lord by the word of the lord that is what in god's mind that he calls superpower russia america germany and all of these people god don't consider them superpower the united nations called them super power in god's mind the superpower for the gentile kingdom are these are these nations are we together okay so we realized that uh right now you you will see you will see the uh uh during the time of daniel when uh uh dania had that time that you know waiting on the lord and and for the lord to be able to to to tell him what will happen to jerusalem and all of that 70 weeks and all that the angel told daniel from the moment that you prayed your prayer was received by the prince of pressure because at the time they will honor the persia kingdom amen at the time they were under uh uh the the pressure kingdom because it is just at the time what darus took over after the handwriting came on the wall and and beltachez broke his legs and you know and all of that so uh uh the the scripture is is identifying to us that uh that was the kingdom they were under and there was a power there was a a force of thy kingdom there there's the spirit behind it now you see paul paul uh uh identified the same thing let's look in the book of ephesians quickly i'm coming back i'm coming back to uh uh uh this uh seen luke chapter four but this is what i was going to talk on tonight just want to so you go there to ephesians chapter 1 praise the lord praise the lord now now it's it's not ephesians chapter one it's ephesians chapter two verse two one and two and you have heat quaking we were dead in trespass and sins where in time past ye walk a calling to the cause of this word i call into the praise of the power of the earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so until we are born again when we are birthed to this word we come right honor the prince of the power of the egg i don't care how pretty that baby is i don't care what godly home that child is we come right under the influence of the praise of the power of the earth the spirit the dwelling in the children of disobedience praise the lord amen that's what brother branham explained he says because of the serpent seed of what took place in the garden of eden our our spirit we we are born uh both our spirit and our body is born in sin shipley in iniquity so we come honor thy influence being predestinated it is only our soul that is that is kept from the influence of the enemy praise the lord that's the reason why brother brahm said he says when i was 12 years old i was going to give my heart to the lord he said but a spirit hover over me [Music] and that is with every one of us until we come to uh uh an understanding until we come to a a new birth praise the lord that's the reason why no no matter how ah all the effort we make and then we we we we teach the children and you know and and we we we give them the you know the the word of the lord we instruct them in righteousness but because this is something that influence our spirit they always have the tendency to bring and we all struggle with that praise the lord now so just like this this this is with the individual this is with the individual that is the same thing also now with the nation verb says every family have a spirit every tribe have a spirit every nation has a spirit amen but now we're talking about this this age right there from from the gentile kingdom praise the lord amen so so we see here that uh uh god showed to daniel the interpretation of the of of the dream and what actually was until the rock that is cut out of the mountain without a hand which is the revelation of jesus christ that would come in this last day that we struck that image at the feet until that revelation come this these are the super power that will that will control the gentile nation and now we honor that last power which is the roman power amen praise the lord a gentile kingdom that has messed with religion uh clay missed with iron so we see here that uh so just like how the prince of persia in the time of pressure war against daniel and and and and all god's believing children what against their prayers praise the lord not only their prayers you just think about in in such a time like there when you have all of those jewish are turning their back on god falling down and worshipping the the the image of nebuchadnezzar what was happening there was such a pressure on them yes the pressure of the age that's what better brain talks about this last day spirit praise the lord so now what where i was where i was going with this is that because on sunday we were talking about the super race and then we start talking about super faith and we start talking about the super grace that have come unto us so just like how the devil have a superpower to be able to influence the people of this age that's the same way god that is rich in mercy has also provided a release a super grace for his people in this age to be able to rise above all the deception and the lies of the devil praise the lord amen so i mean uh uh we can be grateful to the lord we can be grateful to the lord i wanted to use the time to to go over some of the things that i spoke about on sunday and and just and just show them to you in the scripture and also in the message time will not allow us tonight but let's get back in luke chapter 4 and so i can be able to show something something to you tonight and trust that the lord will bless it the bible says and jesus he closed the book and he gave it to the minister he sat down all the eyes of the people were on him and he declared this and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears the bible says debate him witness and the wonder are the gracious words which proceed out of his mouth and he said is not this joseph's son praise the lord praise the lord jesus said he said unto them pretty soon you will say this to me physician heal that self because you sh you're going to say what has been done in company let us also be done here but a prophet is without honor in his own home now jesus now think about this now think about this it will make you to to understand and appreciate why the bible says that and all there that were in the synagogues when they heard these things they were filled with raft now just just imagine now they are all in the synagogues this this is this is the suburb day this is worship day and this stranger when they were not allow a man to go up there because because this is the temple this this is a temple that is in type of the tabernacle it only have to be the priest the the other one that had a ride to to to be able to handle the book praise the lord now so but yeren said a stranger walks into the tabernacle he was straight there and everybody looking at him they don't i mean uh uh and and he went and he took the book opened the straw and he read they're all looking at him i mean uh they never got angry they i mean i mean where where were the ushers where were the deacons where were the men that was supposed to protect the the the synagogues of people intruding into it but god had the spirit of all men under control amen almighty god was in charge praise the lord even if they hated him they loved him at that time praise the lord now so he went and then and then after reading the scripture identifying his ministry that this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes you are soon going to say you know what physician healed herself verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country i tell you the truth many widows were in israel he's talking to to to the people of god he's talking to to to israel he's talking to the jews that's what i want to say he's talking to the jews at that time many widow went in israel in the time of elijah now he's taking both elijah ministry and elijah ministry now watch this now because it will be it will be a blessing it would be of something that would edify us he's taking the two major ministry and we know that that ministry has have succession with the spirit of elijah moving on to elijah and coming upon john the baptist and he's also prophesied in this day amen and it has to go back again for the 144 thousand praise the lord so he says many widow was in the day of elijah when god shut the heavens three years and six months and they all know the story they all know it but the comparison that jesus is doing right in the cylinders on a jewish puppet the emphasis that he making is on a gentile on the jewish pulpit before all the robbers before the high priest he takes the word he's standing where they consider to be the holy place and the emphasis that he's going to make is to talk about a gentile the widow was a gentile nehemiah was a gentile amen the lord you're seeing the picture amen praise the lord [Music] but jesus have just have just read isaiah prophecy where the spirit of the lord god is is upon me he have anointed me to to preach the good tidings you know onto the poll and to heal the sick the broken heart and all that he just read that took the first part the acceptable year of the lord use that to identify his ministry this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears praise the lord the bible says they all marvel are the wonderful words that have come from out of his mouth and then he starts to tell them on a larger ministry when ahab and jezebel and with all their prophets have brought israel to idolatry praise the lord even though elijah symbolically he restored the altar of the lord for the stones there and right before the eyes of the people god sent fire from heaven praise the lord and elijah said lord god let this be what would turn the heart of the people back but the heart of the people did not turn back immediately they saw the miracle they saw the first pool praise the lord and right after there the jezebel sought to kill him and he went the law of fear him we re felt him by ravens and now the lord sent him into the city to a gentile woman praise the lord to a gentile woman now so you see the other uh even though he had to pass that way what was playing out here this almost is is the book of ruth that was playing out amen for god to be able to get a gentile bride they had to take a jewish woman that would step out of her lane lost her son and he would come back with uh with with the gentile woman praise the lord so we know that uh i could use that to just kind of talk a little bit on on the coming of the lord but that's not where i'm going going to tonight is just to be able to to see that uh that's the reason why the second portion of that scripture of isaiah it had to be tied together it had to be fulfilled in the time of the gentiles because he was just passing through he just had to pass that way he had to be born just like i said god in his peculiar way he raised israel as a peculiar treasure so he would travel through the blood strain and become flesh he has already become flesh there was nothing for him to do but just passed that way and now the the the purpose now was was was to go and get a gentile bride praise the lord that's the reason why there is no way they could have received him there is no way they could have identified him that he was the messiah because what god raised israel up for us a treasure was just to use the bloodline for him god to become flesh and that has already been achieved through the virgin birth so the next treasure now was to get an eve was to get a woman in his image because the image of god in the beginning was male and female amen praise the lord so here's jesus here in the temple identifying his ministry can you see how easy it could have been with everybody mothering out his work wow is that not just a song how how eloquent we don't even know what school he went to my goodness he speaks the whole place is quiet it will have been so convincing for them to rally around him but just at the time where they were settling down then he preached another message [Laughter] just at a time where they were trying to be comfortable he was to pass that way he was just to pass that way but the reason why he passed that way was to get a gentile bride that's what he had on his mind so even at the identifying of his ministry he did not fail to declare unto them trying to tell them that look just like how it was honored the first elijah ministry it was a gentile that that that supported that ministry the second elijah ministry god used a gentile uh uh captain neymar are we together and you see in the picture he's identifying his ministry that this scripture is fulfilled but yet there is a purpose there is a purpose that's very peculiar and right there he'll be talking about gentile and that was the thing that got them angry because to the jews it was an abomination to even mention the name of a gentile in the synagogues praise the lord but you see jesus intention was not to make them angry jesus intention was to declare unto them what his mission was were there not many lepers in israel oh yeah there were many lepers don't you remember the story when elisha prophesied that tomorrow by this time a flower will be sold for this how did that prophecy came to pass it was leprous was it not the lepers that went to syria to the syrians and said we would if we would die let's go and die because they were farming in the land they were lepers praise the lord they were the one that went over to syrian and as they were getting over to to the syrian place god created a noise in the heavens that sounded like cherubs and those syrians got on their hearses and everybody ran from the time those lepers came they eat enough they went on a hill of of samara and start shouting to the people you don't die there is food here you'll come because they couldn't go in town so there were many lepers [Laughter] oh praise the lord god is a peculiar god his ways are past finding out amen there were one of those uh uh uh uh how what is his name being hidden or something like that that that challenge elijah and said i don't know how this would even come to pass the bible say he taught it in his mind and the prophet take up his thought and say because you have thought like that you will see it but you won't taste it praise the lord now this is to show a close right here or pick up some time ago i mean sometime after if the lord uh continued to bless the thought this is to show how how much that god invested in having a bride how much investment he made how much preparation he made for us to to be in this age praise the lord just like uh paul said he says there are not many nobles among us there are not many smart guys among us yeah not many we haven't few but not many you know we don't have a lot of the guys on wall street among us and and sometimes with the people that god has given grace to be able to identify see the message of their day we have the tendency of looking ourselves looking at ourselves as as nobodies you know and and pretty soon we start comparing ourselves to one another our educational status uh how much we are paid how much paid this one is making how much pay that one is making how much money they want how what house this won't buy and and we and and we bring everything down to such a pitiful state when god invested in all of this praise the lord to get us here now see what the scripture says you think about it [Music] the bible says when he when he made that statement that got so angry praise the lord they grabbed him he was taking him to the hill everybody mama that trust in life let's just finish with him they carry him up they went after they wanted to push him down so he can just roll down and just break every bones in his body and he got right there then he stopped some kind of a conversation came out they started talking and he just walked right among him just like when syrian ahmed came to look for elijah he said why are you looking for elijah you yeah go right down and go behind the hill pass down there you will see him praise the lord but it was just because he hired you on his mind amen just because he hides you on his mind he taught about a loud issue age age that would be one of the worst age the age that will that will actually once again see sodom and gomorrah it will not just be a story but it will be a life among the people age that will see the worst of every worse and just like there was a widow in the day of elijah there's a bride in this age that is going to rally around the message of elijah just like meme a nema that's uh the syrian captain was able to experience the bible says he experienced his body became like a baby when he did what the prophet told him to do he experienced the change of his body [Music] with all of his proud dip yourself in the water seven times he went the first time he came i look at him said he complained this message just making me old when i was there in syria i used to be in the word i had curse in my head this message just making me old hey seven says go the second time when he did what the prophet told him to do the bible says his leprose was cleansed and his body became as a baby to tell you that there is enough power in this world to change the atoms of your body whether it is health wise whether it is habit whether it is in the bloodstream there is enough power in this world [Music] the reason is that we're putting less value on the word and trying to look for it to come from somewhere else god bless you tonight musicians you can come this is a prayer meeting tonight with a few ones that were now well we pray for them we are believing that god will move on their behalf and we just wanted to bring a little hesitation to you and uh so let's just buy our house tonight and as we as we just change my heart to lord make it ever true [Music] yes lord yes lord yes lord are we sufficiently impressed [Music] are we sufficiently impressed of this word that has come to us in this last day [Music] are we sufficiently impressed when the prophet of god says everything that you need for your journey god has placed it in the word can you believe god's word can you take god's word [Music] the widow just took the word of elijah [Music] she says i have this is the last that i have for me and my son she took the word of that prophet [Music] the economy was bad [Music] there was no job because there was farming in the land but she took the word of the prophet she took the word of another mortal man that told her bake me a cake [Music] make for me first she took the word of a prophet over the knees of her of her own son brother brahm says in a natural mind it would be very cruel for elijah to go to the house of a widow there were many people there were many there many widows somehow stacks of food in the house but yet god sent her to the one that had only her last take she took the word of a man that she had never seen before are we just hiding ourselves under the message trying to look for cover trying to look for the place of comfort oh can we take this word and apply it to our life apply applied to our nature to believe that there is enough power in this world to change our habits and and change our lifestyle take the cruelness out of our heart the bitterness there is enough power in this world to blast every evil thought from our mind and every filthy thought and filthy desire there is enough power in the world [Music] are we going to take god's word above our fears that we know she had a reason to be afraid are we going to take god's word change my heart oh god make it ever true change my heart oh god i want to be like you [Music] oh change my heart oh god i want to believe your word lord oh god change my heart oh god let me learn to trust you lord you are my god lord i am your child [Music] me this is my cry to you change my heart oh god make it ever true i want to believe in you

are we sufficiently impressed of the word that have come to us in this day oh dear lord please father [Music] we know god is the prince of laodicea the same way he put pressure on those jewish people that they abandoned their god and they became so fearful they became so oh god and so much pressure that they could worship an idol when you know that it's written in the word of the lord you must never bow down before an idol lord we have that same last day pressure that is pressuring people to look at the thoughts of a prophet look at the front of a man that was not ashamed to admit his fault [Music] such a pressure lord yeah that we we quick to give into our fear we are quick to give into our fear and sometimes we are so terrified that we think we have faith but it's just fear in the in the root of faith please lord [Music] we have the word of almighty god [Music] a word that has been vindicated a word that is still proving itself to be the same oh teach our heart to trust you lord teach our heart to trust you bring us in that place lord take every religious spirit from our life of god we don't want to put on church we don't want to put on one life in church one life around the believers and and then we have a secret life going on that is that is not decent that is not that is not edifying to you or god because you want to get yourself involved in our daily routine when we lied on the pillows on our bed lord you want to come night and remind us of your precious promises change my life for god i want to live for you change my life for god i want to be like you change my heart oh god make it ever [Music] may i be like you father we pray tonight lord and ask your blessings come on guardian and go with us as you have always gone with us lord drive with us home teach us
