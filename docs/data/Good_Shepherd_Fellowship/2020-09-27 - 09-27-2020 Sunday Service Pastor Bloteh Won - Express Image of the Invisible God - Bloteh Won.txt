amen praise the lord we've been we've been talking on on the greatness of our god amen you just think about it it's not just a song that we sang it's not just a music amen but there is no problem in the building this morning that god cannot solve amen before you even have your problem he first got the solution before there was a problem amen but you have to break into the reality of faith that's right amen or as it would just be a mental thought you have to break into the reality because it's real yes before there was ever a problem there was a solution amen if there would be a problem without a solution then then then then then god is not god that's right that's right amen amen before he give a fish fan on the back there was a water for the fish to swim praise the lord hallelujah so there's no need to to to limit god he's in control and we love him for that amen praise the lord let's let's just read collusion chapter 1 verse 15. this morning and who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature amen praise the lord let's step back a little bit maybe from verse 12 we gave us a good picture here because we have we are we are diving into deep seed amen amen giving thanks unto the father which have made us made to be partakers of the inheritance of the sins in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness are you being delivered from the power of darkness this morning amen we have delivered us from the power of darkness he has delivered us from jealousy from cruel spirit from envy from lust that's the power of darkness the power of darkness is now one continent in the world no the power of darkness is spirit the however in our being praise the lord he has delivered us from the power of darkness even sadness is the power of darkness if you are just sad it's a dark spirit depression is the power of darkness so he had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son what is thy kingdom joy peace righteousness joy unspeakable full of glory amen praise the lord the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of our sin amen just to know that you have been forgiven amen who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him where all things created in the heavens and that i in earth visible and invisible praise the lord visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominion or principalities all power all things all things all things all means all all things were created by him amen and for him yes amen praise the lord the devil was not created for you the devil was created for him because satan is just a whip that god used to bring us in his presence all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things we are dealing with these all things i don't know what can you take out of it all things let all be all amen all things amen praise the lord amen hebrew chapter one oh i fought battles through the night amen praise the lord you are dead and you just did and you just did and you're just staring at night it's coming and going and you're saying lord yeah i am why am i going to speak tomorrow an enemy trying to make you feel depressed and he's trying to make you to worry praise the lord but i feel good amen you have created a wonderful atmosphere to help me break out of and just go into the word this morning hebrew chapter 1 let's read the first three verses god who at sondra times in double manas speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets have in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed hearers of all things all things disappearing again by whom also he made the words amen who being the brightness of his glory the express image in collusion we read about the image of the invisible girl now here paul go another level he says that image is an express image the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself paused our sin sat down on the right hand of the majestic on high let's pray together father in the name of the lord jesus christ we just pray the lord god you will come and bless us together now in jesus name amen praise the lord this morning have you seen i want to speak on this the express image of the invisible god the express image of the invisible god amen praise the lord you know christianity is a beautiful thing when you come into the revelation of faith praise the lord amen uh brother eric is working on on a picture for me and as soon as he's done we will have the privilege to share that with you uh but you know to some people they don't understand and even many of us that are caught up in the realm of christianity we are still learning every day amen we are still learning every day and uh and god stayed revealing himself to us he stayed he's still making himself known that's the reason why we never want to come to the place you know and and and feel like we uh uh you know we we really understand you know uh what god is even doing with our life praise the lord amen so uh [Music] but this morning we will try to to take this subject and bring us to the place where we can be able to understand it you know if you are inside it's almost like the the tent that we put on the on the door there on the glass when you are inside then you get an understanding of what is happening outside but when you are outside it's hard for you to know what is happening inside amen that's the reason why it frustrate the eight years and they frustrate you know all the godless people when they talk about god they just think that you are talking about uh uh i mean just one person is so selfish to talk about about god but you just think about what the scripture says he created all things and without him nothing exists and he created all things for himself until we understand it that this whole thing about faith and about god is all about him that's right it's all about him praise the lord he holds our life in in his hands praise the lord amen he holds our life he holds time and eternity in his hands so this is the this is the one we want to talk about this morning you know uh uh uh we've been we've been just going around uh talking about the go ahead and not really trying to make it as subject on the godhead for doctrine of purpose but we're trying to make it a subject to be able to bring us into the revelation of who this god is praise the lord amen to bring us into the revelation for us to understand who this great god is and i pray that he show himself unto us amen we can go back and forth with with doctrinal views but what we try what we try to bring out this morning the express image of the invisible god we want to talk about and i mentioned on the last sunday how god in the way that he showed himself you think about it even before he was god because god means an object of worship so before there was anything to worship him this great internal spirit existed by himself how we talk are we together and the bible called him the invisible god amen the invisible god so he's the invisible god but this invisible god try to make himself visible and until god becomes visible to you amen you can never worship him you can never serve him until he becomes visible to you amen amen praise the lord so this invisible god internal spirit praise the lord starts to unfold himself he started unfolding himself he started trying to make himself known coming from the invisible told the visible praise the lord amen coming to the invisible coming from the invisible to the visible praise the lord and when when when when jesus was born and came to the full age of his ministry the bible make us to know the invisible god fully embody into him that's why he could say i and my father are one that's why he could say i do nothing except the father show it to me praise the lord amen and and after jesus ascended on high the invisible god came in the form of the holy spirit and started dealing with the church back from the visible because when he was here he was visible he's dealing with the church now back from the visible to the invisible praise the lord and that's what we want to look at and that is the thing sometimes that that that that that trouble us because unless until we understand these things you know uh uh that the devil can come around and bother us because right now you see that is the reason why let me say this way when god was dealing with the jews he gave them all their laws and their other ordinances it was all visible things amen you got to wash your hands before you enter into the tabernacle you got to kill a literal animal you got to burn candles they were all all visible why because he was coming from the invisible to the visible so he have to give them visible ordinance for them to really know a man has to take a lamb and drag the lamb to the temple and and go there lay his hands on the lamb and wash the priests killing the lamb for him to be able to walk back and believe that his sin was forgiving but you and myself by faith we lay our hands on the lamb of god jesus christ invisible our faith is invisible man praise the lord amen the bible says he has forgiven us of all of our sin that's the thing that troubles us because we don't see it visibly we don't see it visibly so it's hard for us to believe what god is doing in the amen amen amen praise the lord but he came from the invisible to the visible and from the vegetable he's moving back to the invisible amen are we together amen let's read another scripture maybe he might help you romans chapter one romans chapter one romans chapter 1 praise the lord amen amen let's read from verse 18 romans chapter 1 reading from verse 18. the bible says for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness you see saints that is that is the responsibility that is given to us god has revealed great truth to us and the bible says here god wrath will be against a man that will hold this truth in unrighteousness praise the lord what a responsibility we have that god has placed in our hands what we could go into there but let's step up a little bit because the reason why god would do this he says because that which may be known of god the things to be known of god is manifest in them for god have shown it unto them god has shown it unto us let's follow the apostles a little bit for the invisible things the invisible things of him from the creation of the world the invisible things that's what paul is saying now the reason why god will judge this word the reason why he will condemn this word is because the invisible god threw out all the ages through signs through a medical doctor medical science and true and and and even the the the civilization we see around us everything that we see tangible from the invisible god amen amen he said because that which may be known of god is manifested in them for god has shown it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen the invisible things are clearly seen how are they seen because they will be invisible i clearly seen being understood by things that are made even his internal power in his godhead so this whole godhead about father son holy god jesus is god it all started from the invisible god trying to make himself visible amen trying to make himself visible the invisible god trying to make himself visible even the godhead that's where it started from from the invisible god trying to make himself visible so paul is saying the invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that i made so the visible things are the manifestation of the invisible god because this god that we worship the god that we claim to be our god he's not a man god is not a man before there was time before there was anything that was ever made he existed by himself and he fell all time in all space that's why the apostle paul said don't be deceived you can't mock god you can't mock god you can play god amen praise the lord before there was anything that was me he existed by himself this is the one that has no beginning of day no beginning of day no father no mother that's the one that we are worshiping when you think about it it humbles your heart praise the lord he's a great god when we say he's a great god he's great in himself praise the lord god don't need to do something for you for him to be great for the matter of fact that you are a life you are existing show his greatness just for the fact that you are existing the express image of the invisible god he's trying to express himself he's trying to make himself known are we together that is the reason why every time you pick up the bible you have read it over and over but it says becomes new it's still open up because it's all part of the greatness of god you can you can never discover all about this god when you think that you know you have not begun yet [Music] when you think that you know and you hear people say i know my god you know i know the god that i serve it's nothing to break about no it's nothing to break about praise the lord paul says something i'll share that with you first timothy chapter one let's look into that a little bit i'm so caught up in the thought of this thing that is it's hard for me to preach it the reason is because it's just it's just i mean it's it's just it's just like a slap on my face you know it's i mean the greatness of of our god it's just like a slap on my face i was i was trying to see how i can get away from this and and look for something evangelistic to preach about but i just i just felt like with all of the the prayer needs we had we need to talk about the greatness of god amen because our god is surely greater than coronavirus amen if he did not created a word there would not be a space for coronavirus amen he's greater than all every illness in our body praise the lord he is greater than uh than than your depths praise the lord amen when you have not figured out how to get out of debt god have already figured it out that's why we have to trust him praise the lord first timothy chapter 2 1 first team chapter 1 verse 17. see how the way the apostles said it here he says now onto the king in tenor the king in tanner immortal invisible do you know that internal life is invisible can you show me your internal life we all have eternal life here this morning can you reach in your pocket and show me your internal life can you show me your eternal life praise the lord amen is it because you come to church that you have eternal life no praise the lord amen you having faith this morning is that fit in the building this morning can you show me your faith can you put your hand in your pocket and bring out faith it's invincible praise the lord love is invisible love is not flowers no love is not flowers praise the lord amen love is not flowers love is not sweet words praise the lord amen let me not go down that route this morning but paul said unto the king in tanner immortal do you know you have immortal life dwelling in you and what immortal means that you can't die you can die yes as soon as this body dropped that's right there is another body you drop this body you step into the other one [Applause] praise the lord but you see because these things are invisible that's the reason why when we get sick we feel the the visible chills on our body we feel the the symptoms and all of that and and and and it creates fear it looks like we are going and it's gone and after this we are lost but in the midst of all of that there is an invisible being unto the king in tanner immortal invisible the only wise god amen the only wise god that's why we can't outsmart him he expects us to come to him just as we are we can ask matt god we can play him the only wise god be honored and glory forever and ever amen what a prayer yes to stick in your mind hallelujah onto the king in tanner immortal invisible yes the only wise god praise the lord we are so glad to call him our father amen amen so that's what god has been doing throughout all the ages that's how that's what he's been doing you see and and and and because if god do not express himself that way you will never be we will never be able to know him we will not be able to know him i mean we will be so confused we will be so confused even with all that we have read from the bible and all that we know from the scripture with all the denominations and everything that is happening out there in the name of the church we stay confused and all the religion out there but this invisible god this invisible god has been unfolding himself he's been unfolding himself that is the thing that buffered the minds of the people to think when god told to ahaz i will give you a sign a virgin child conceived it was god giving a sign it was god becoming a sign that jehovah god this invisible god will come in the form of a baby in dementia it's hard to wrap your mind around it i mean it's hard to wrap your mind around it why because the same nature has given us a sense of pride that when a man reached to a level of greatness he's not able to come down so it's hard for us to wrap our mind around the invisible god becoming a baby praise alone call the two years or you baby no i'm not a baby amen it's just that you know pride that comes with the sin nature so because of that it's hard for us to wrap our mind around it that is the reason why to know god in every age just like how god in the beginning john said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god just how god the invisible god the great internal god had to condense himself into a body of light for the angels to worship him because the angels could now worship him until he became an image amen and so that is the same way in every age to every people that's right for you to know this invisible god he had to take a form to reveal himself amen amen he has to find a china that's what he used the prophets praise the lord that's why god will take a man in the age and god will take that man that is born and sin and by athlete parents and god will draw him to himself look at the life of moses god will take moses a murderer draw him to himself take him into his presence that that man can speak fleas into existence that demon he can turn the water into blood why is the invisible god coming down in the form amen to make himself visible to the people so the people that are believing him will be able to see him through a visible form amen that's why in every age she takes a right and after he has revealed himself he make himself visible hallelujah praise the lord amen that a man moses that one time ran away from egypt was right back in egypt again he never came with a military uh uh uh uh behind him and with with amherst and terror he came just with a drastic in his hands why because he saw the invisible god when the invisible god came down in the in in the form of a fire moses said it was a fire when he went there you see that that's the thing about this invisible god he can choose to take whatever form that pleases him he can choose to take whatever form whatever form amen amen one time he took a form of a three-year-old boy in the temple called samir he came down and started giving that three-year-old baby boy vision and speaking to him that's the thing about the invisible god and that is the proud that he had to have you young men and young women living a dedicated life yes praise the lord and god take you in your youthfulness yes yes don't miss out just like he did to jeremiah he take you in your youthfulness [Music] yes he want to make something out of your life to show to this adulterous generation that a young man can live clean without follocation without a doctrine that a young woman can be a virgin until she walked down the aisle is the same invisible god [Applause] it's the same invisible god praise the lord each does not bother him if he don't get you in your youthful age he can get you in the older age because does not matter to god [Music] the bible says there was a woman old hannah blind in the temple blind but just at the birth of jesus a blind woman when they called that little baby illegitimate child they gave him all sorts of names but that blind woman could see him hallelujah praise the lord oh samuel in the temple oh he did all he knew to burn insane and everything amen but god did not despise his old age when the world was brought to the temple in his own age he recognized the word for his day he said lord now your seven can depart in peace become my eyes yes [Music] praise the lord [Music] all that god has been doing through the ages is not to make church all he's been doing is expressing himself finding people that he can express himself through praise the lord amen finding husband and wife that he can express himself through the man is like christ the woman is the type of the church and god wants to express himself through your union that's all he's been doing so the invisible god that's why jesus said let men see your good work and praise you is that what the scripture says and praise you let them see your good work and glorify your father because your work expressed the invisible god amen amen amen so if we don't praise you don't feel bad amen you should feel bad if we don't glorify the father because that's the purpose that's right to glorify the father that's god's purpose that's god's purpose and that's the thing sometimes that hurt you know it hurts i mean after a person and then yo you hear that with with many other people that really came in contact with the revelation of the world when they have when they have hate that uh that that year they mean when they have hit that super age praise the lord they have fees so broken why they didn't see this all of my life praise the lord amen but you don't have to be discouraged god kept you for that purpose amen to show that he the invisible god he can reveal himself whenever he wants to and whoever he wants to amen so if god is dealing with your heart if the fear of god is dealing with your heart against things don't play with him don't think that you are in control you are not in control amen you are not in control yes let me read something to you i'm just completely away from my notes but that's good amen it's good it shows that you are the one doing the preaching so i'm following you amen i'm following you jesus go away jesus listen to this he said he lives what this you are bumping into all the time showing that jesus is alive showing that the presence of god is alive he says what is this you are bumping into all the time amen these things you are bumping into that is making you conscious of god praise the lord what's that condemns you when you are wrong what is that thing that tells you when nobody is dead and nobody knows what you are doing what condemns you that's his presence he's the invisible god because you can hide from him amen amen all your ways are naked in his eyes yes he comes back and says you know you're not supposed to be doing this you look over your shoulder nobody did it's the invisible god what's that makes you believe what makes you to believe that there is god what makes you to believe that this thing is real it's not your knowledge it's not your knowledge it's the invisible god dealing with your heart it's the invisible god that is dealing with your heart that's him you might not be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in spirit form the invisible god but he dward among invisible people amen he dwelt among a visible people he can use a sister to talk to you he can use a brother to talk to you he can use a preacher to preach his word he can use somebody to sing a song and that song can minister to you he dwarfed among his people [Music] because he endured among invisible people making himself visible by his promised word in that people so god is making himself visible that's the reason why he called a people for his namesake to make himself visible that's the reason why he gave us a a a a prophet a son of man with the ministry of their son of man to make himself visible because until god becomes visible you can't worship him you will not be able to understand you will just be conforming to religion to create but unless god becomes visible his word becomes so visible that you can say this is god nothing but god and when god become visible to you that way nobody can kick you out nobody can tell you different you don't want an explanation from a pope or from a priest or whoever it is he has become so visible to you praise the lord that was the place where little david was standing amen he didn't care whether you believe his testimony on that david did not care he knew that he killed a lion he knew that he killed a bell you you want to prove it by his age you want to prove it how dangerous a lion is you couldn't tell david anything different because it was so real to him that's the reason why goliath was just like a little boy in david eyes because the invisible god became so visible to david when invisible god becomes so visible to you there is nothing nothing corrupt or filtered on the internet can be able to rob your mind amen praise the lord there is nothing that this world can offer because he has become so visible his glory is so close to you that it drives you away from anything that is ongoing that's right we're not talking about church membership not talking about putting your names on the book we are talking about coming in contact with the invisible god by him making himself visible praise the lord amen amen science want to make us and tell us that you got to see before you believe amen say you got to see it before you believe yes praise the lord but you see god is not bothered by science because he's not taken from science science is taken from him praise the lord science is taken from him amen you know brother lonnie he used to have this story he says the scientists wanted to go in context with god and he says let's go in context god said well okay praise the lord they say okay whatever you may we can make the same god said okay you go first amen they tried to go and take something from the universe because you know all of these things are mated amen make your own stars make your own planet create your own word and then you can do experiment you are using my product and then you trying to tell me that i don't exist amen you're using my own thing then you're saying i did not exist the invisible god the express image the express image the bible says god is spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth let's just take this from christ is the mystery of god reveal and then we will find a place to close you thank you for being patient with me amen now listen today this is this is very profound and in a way that he said yeah now for a text i want to take out of there this is a text basing it upon the entire bible this christ is the mystery of god revealed is based on the entire bible from genesis to revelation christ was revealing god through the entire bible amen christ not jesus the man christ the lord christ the anointed one was revealing god throughout the entire bible are we together and i want to tie to this christ the mystery of god reveal christ being the mystery of god revealed now god's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of his mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve what was that thing to make himself known that's all god wants to achieve to make himself known to you that he's your creator hallelujah he had given the boundaries of your life the day you will be here and the day you'll be gone out of this earth he want to make himself known to you without him you will never succeed he want to make himself known to you that's that's what god wanted to achieve is to make himself known that's all the preaching of the gospel is all about is for god to become known to us something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive of doing it and in order to to let himself be expressed amen so you see it even go a little farther not just for you to know him but for him to express himself through you because when you come to know him he wants to express himself through you so your friend can come to know him so your relatives can come to know him because when they look at your life and know who you were and the things that you used to do they say no this is not junior that we know that's not junior maybe something happened to him praise the lord amen my stepmom used to do that when i got saved she had a pentecostal friend you know and uh she always should be she will always be talking to the lady it looks like something has come over him you know in the night he just ch i don't know he's chanting or what i was praying at the time amen and then she would try to explain it to him to her but she she wouldn't get it you know because we were from uh from a melody's family and uh she will she was not able to get it but but that's what it is praise the lord sometimes you think that you just have it in your hand and you can do it and i can tell you that you know what many times we misrepresent jesus praise the lord we misrepresent him because we try to take it as our personality when it's not your personality now god's secret mystery he had before the word now back in the back part of his mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive of doing it in order for him to as for for himself to be expressed because first there there wasn't even a moon style outer molecule anything there was nothing nothing he was god amen praise the lord just like i said the other day if you don't worship god he don't take nothing from him no for us to come and worship god is for our own benefit amen praise the lord it's for our own benefit when paul says don't forsake the assembling of the saints if you choose not to worship god it does not change him praise the lord amen if you have ever had a true experience of god you will see how it affects your life because you won't have the joy that you're supposed to have you won't have that peace of mind that you're supposed to have you just get in the wilderness and you start longing you warm days you want this you will just you just be running all over the place because before you were made god existed amen before there was even the moon stars atom anything there was nothing it was all all blackness there was no sun that that's that's what i was i was reading this morning listening to it when that song came on my mind he carried the weight of the word on his shoulder not only at the cross even before there was anything god carried everything in himself the creation of this world he was carrying it in himself praise the lord before there was anything it was him and him alone there wasn't no sun no more no stars no nothing then he was god and he asked joe where were you where were you where were you when i lay the foundation of the wood amen see the monsters sang together for joy the sons of god the morningstar sang together the sons of god shouted for joy where were you that was way back before the earth was praise the lord the expression of the invisible god god expressing himself making himself known praise the lord making himself known making himself real trying to grab people that he can express himself in look at the day that we are living in the lawless day with all of the things that is happening in the name of the church as soon as you take a bible or you want to talk about the lord jesus people just think it's one of them there all the one is just it's just people money the church is a business they don't see this thing that was in god's mind to be able to get a people that he can express himself through you see that's the reason why god under the old testament he chose the jewish people and he gave them lord and ordinance because they were the people that he wanted to express himself through what the what did the the the rahab said rahab said we have heard about your god how he opened the red sea all the nations around praise the lord they could stay in their lane and in the night they would see the pillow of fire hanging over the children of israel when everywhere is that they can see light so they knew there was something special about those people god choose them to be able to express himself that's why he gave them his lord and his ordinances to be able to show through them that i'm a holy god i'm a holy god i'm a righteous god he was expressing himself but because he was coming from the invisible to the visible he had not entered the human soul yet that's the reason why all their ordinance was just literal ordinance physical things don't touch this don't touch this don't do this it was all physical things but finally when god got himself a body when he got himself a body praise the lord do you know for you to be here i mean in this world to be born there were thousands of your brothers and sisters that had to die because there were a lot of there were a lot of sales from your father a lot of elses from your mother that could have made other brothers and sisters of yours but god has to choose the one that make you but when it came to jesus there was not multiple cells god himself produced the blood cells for one body and he produced the egg cells for one body so there were now multiple cells just like from from your father from our father and our mother and finally god god a man and he couldn't express himself in it nicodemus came to him by night and says look we know we talk about it no man can do this except god except god they could see but they just couldn't fight from it the god that led our fathers by the pillar of fire how could he come into this capital boy they just could not wrap their mind around it that's why god did not call us to understand he called us to believe him because there are things that happen in our life we can wrap our mind on it i'm serving god i'm a son of god why is this happening you will never be able to wrap your mind on it but if you have seen the invisible one no matter what comes no matter what comes you can you can say i have seen him that is invisible praise the lord musicians you can come sometimes god has to take us through tough trials to be able to break us so we can see him sometimes the things that we go through is for our own good because he wants to make himself real he want to make himself real let's let's play that song again and there's no mountain too tall [Music] let's buy our hands and just worship him just think about him this morning what is bothering you are you worrying about [Music] what is so heavy on your heart what are you afraid of [Music] [Music] thinking about the many people that are needing god this morning in the hospital thinking think about it many people think about california with a fire disaster houston oregon with the water and all of those things that are happening what kind of trouble you are in and you think god cannot bring you out of faith [Music] he carried this entire word everything that was made he carried it in him before there was anything that was made it was just him and him alone and he brought those things out in the form of creation [Music] and the creation drifted away from him and yet he came in the form of a man and he took the scene of the word upon his shoulder once again [Music] to prove that he's the father he carried the weight of this world on his shoulders [Music] i know my brother [Music] i know my sister that he will carry you yes he carried the wing of this world upon his shoulders i know my brother that he will carry you jesus said come unto me all you that labor and heaven lady whatever that is bothering you and if you can just trust

around the country uh during the week but back at how one did in cape town brother ruby daniels had another one there in johannesburg and there was one that they had over in in port elizabeth and there's that's brother shennick there this brother uh uh he's an old timer he's a man of faith he was an evangelist and an apostle in a sense that i think that is very significant he's a he takes teams around south africa he goes into villages and just put up tents and and stayed at a week have meetings and uh and and for many of those things there were there were churches that was birthed in different places but he was he was very he was unknown by all the believers there there uh so they were coming from a finer that he and his son-in-law that also passed uh preach and they would return him back and his wife there i mean you listening to the tributes that was given to that sister you say oh my goodness oh my goodness i mean if the saints if god could give them you know the grace to to be just like the the scenes in uh in in the book of arts that called for doctors to come back i mean she had such a testimony i mean she was mother to to all the children you know and and a great supporter to her husband i mean a woman that had such a confidence i learned that morning at the funeral she signed she and her daughter that also passed signed the song when the road is caught up yandere i would be there and not knowing she was prophesying that she was going to go before her husband prashanik is recovering and it's very difficult for him he lost his wife and he lost his daughter and his son-in-law the next picture is uh uh the picture of brother babes uh and there's their sister eunice there like we share with you a little bit on wednesday night uh you know but base i was trying to get the numbers together it was actually seven years that he stayed in prison for something that he never did and uh but you could never make better fee sign for being in praising you could never you could never bring sadness out of him why because he felt like he was not serving a sentence that was the first message he preached when he came out of prison i never said a sentence i said the purpose he says when you go to praising you become a hero he says but god has to bring you to zero from a hero to zero amen for you to be able to understand what actually he's doing in your life and many times that's what happened you know many of us we own our houses so proud so arrogant god has to bring us down to zero for us to really understand what he wants to make out of our lives yes uh that's our brother brother babes and the last time i was in i was over there in south africa i really wanted to contact him you know and and we didn't have the privilege to to be able to to contact him but i think i spoke with him when he was all in praising and you know he loved he left a very very tremendous testimony tremendous testimony just imagine he was pastoring the church and he had just had his first first try before that incident took place he was falsely accusing and uh you know and all of that you know you know the brothers were talking and talking about that you go to see but baby praising as uh you know you try to be sorry he will just break you out into some kind of a laughter you know and uh he was he was never the man that carries sorrow with him you know yeah and uh the same with brother shannon's wife i mean she was a sister of contempt you know she just has such a content and she was a strength to her husband ministry i mean even if she was now well she wanted to be there she wanted to make sure she sing a song before he comes to the pooping you know that was the kind of a woman that she was so we would miss them but they ain't a better place praise the lord i think they understand about the invisible more than you and myself do because everything now is so visible to them amen heaven is visible to them heaven is invisible to you and myself but heaven is visible to them praise the lord so we just want to continue to remember them [Music] the children the rest of the family we just want to continue to remember them let's pray together again
