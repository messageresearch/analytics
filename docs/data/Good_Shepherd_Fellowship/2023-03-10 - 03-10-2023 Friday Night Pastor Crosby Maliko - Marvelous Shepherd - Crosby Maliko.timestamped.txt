[49:34] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[49:36] Jesus Christ
[49:37] praise the Lord so I happy to be in your
[49:41] midst
[49:42] amen I'm so glad when I go to a place
[49:44] where the pulpit has been designed for
[49:47] short people
[49:49] praise the Lord many times I've had to
[49:52] go to pulpits where there's an
[49:53] adjustment
[49:55] pseudo-platform where you stand because
[49:58] the preachers there are very tall but ah
[50:02] he is a man I say eye to eye with so I'm
[50:04] grateful to God
[50:06] praise the Lord do you love the Lord
[50:09] amen I'm so humbled and thankful for the
[50:13] invitation from our precious brother he
[50:15] is a well-traveled preacher with so many
[50:17] friends across the world
[50:19] so for him to have a select deliberate
[50:23] choice to call me for these meetings I'm
[50:27] very humbled and I truly appreciate him
[50:29] as a friend and as a preacher he did
[50:32] preach so well for us in our church such
[50:35] that I'm under pressure praise the Lord
[50:37] so so grateful again to meet his family
[50:40] and also to also have my friend brother
[50:44] Bill brother William a man so hosted us
[50:48] uh
[50:51] so well that I wish I had two tummies or
[50:54] so praise the Lord because the food was
[50:56] just so nice amen and I thought to
[51:00] myself I should have had this type of
[51:02] food in my youth because there now
[51:04] they've maximized the opportunity but
[51:08] nonetheless we thank God praise the Lord
[51:11] I greet you once again in the name of
[51:12] the Lord as we remain standing shall we
[51:14] turn to our Bibles
[51:17] I don't know whether my quotes and
[51:19] scriptures will be projected praise the
[51:21] Lord
[51:27] amen
[51:29] to uh Psalms
[51:32] chapter 23
[51:34] verse 1 to 6.
[51:37] the thing that uh is a testimony to me
[51:41] is that throughout the year from the
[51:44] beginning of the year right after today
[51:45] I've just been preaching from Psalms
[51:47] chapter 23 and I've known brother one
[51:51] but I didn't know that the name of his
[51:54] church is called the Good Shepherd so to
[51:58] me that itself is a testimony I don't
[52:01] have to worry what to speak about I've
[52:03] got to speak about the Good Shepherd
[52:05] praise the Lord so Psalms chapter 23
[52:08] which is a very familiar scripture but I
[52:12] always like to say there is nuggets in
[52:14] them familiar scriptures if we dig deep
[52:17] and look through the eyes of Malachi 4
[52:19] 5. amen so allow me to read the sound
[52:23] from Psalms
[52:25] 23 verse 1 to 6 the Lord is my shepherd
[52:31] I shall not want
[52:33] he maketh me to lie in Green Pastures
[52:38] he leaded me beside the Still Waters He
[52:43] restored my soul he leaded me in the
[52:47] paths of righteousness for his name's
[52:50] sake
[52:51] yea
[52:52] though I walk through the valley of the
[52:55] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[52:59] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[53:03] they comfort me thou prepare is the
[53:07] table before me in the presence of mine
[53:10] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[53:13] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[53:17] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[53:21] life and I'll dwell in the house of the
[53:23] Lord forever may the Lord add blessings
[53:26] to the reading of his word he may take
[53:27] the comfort of your sins
[53:29] and while I'm still trying to relax
[53:32] myself I would like to also grip my
[53:34] precious elder brother from Liberia who
[53:37] have just met a couple of minutes ago
[53:39] praise the Lord he's a reverend so that
[53:42] also puts another layer of pressure
[53:44] praise the Lord because when you're
[53:46] preaching to a man of his caliber you'll
[53:49] probably go through scan through the
[53:52] scriptures you are saying to find the
[53:53] validity and the truth in them
[53:55] scriptures so I trust that somewhere
[53:58] there he will be a little bit lenient to
[54:01] his younger brother praise the Lord do
[54:03] you love the Lord
[54:05] amen praise the Lord now Psalm chapter
[54:08] number 23 is a very familiar scripture
[54:11] we've sang about it in Primary School
[54:14] we've read about it it's a scripture
[54:17] we've seen on posters in bookshops in
[54:20] places where they want to express that
[54:22] God is still the leader and the shepherd
[54:24] we've seen it it's not a new strange
[54:27] scripture that I have to go and ask the
[54:30] Sunday School to find a way of breaking
[54:32] it down for the little ones it's a
[54:34] scripture that is well known if you
[54:36] don't know Psalm 23 I don't know what
[54:38] you're doing with the Bible praise the
[54:39] Lord Psalm 23 is like there are the
[54:43] scripture the Lord is my shepherd a man
[54:45] that are the scripture that speaks about
[54:48] uh uh what we call the Lord's Prayer
[54:50] praise the Lord if you remember
[54:52] correctly The Lord's Prayer is something
[54:54] that we've memorized uh Through Time and
[54:57] Eternity praise the Lord even
[54:59] unbelievers know that there is a prayer
[55:01] that the Lord prayed so Psalm 23 is in
[55:04] that category are very familiar
[55:06] scriptures but I want you brothers and
[55:08] sisters as message Believers to not be
[55:10] familiar with scripture because the
[55:12] prophet speaks about the example of a
[55:14] man that lived by the sea too much he
[55:16] never be he never had the law of the sea
[55:19] until there was this young boy that
[55:22] wanted to see the sea so much never make
[55:24] the things of the word become common or
[55:27] familiar that is always power attached
[55:30] to a scripture there is always something
[55:33] significantly powerful behind every
[55:36] scripture despite and in spite of how
[55:38] much you think you know it somebody say
[55:40] Amen to that now as I was approaching
[55:42] 2023 praise the Lord you begin to scour
[55:46] through the scriptures to look for
[55:47] things to help you think about what
[55:50] theme to speak about in 2023 and
[55:53] couldn't come any better with the
[55:55] scripture of Psalms 23 and I
[55:58] particularly am so happy that I never
[56:00] would have invited myself to a church
[56:03] called the Good Shepherd of the flock
[56:05] praise the Lord so in God's wisdom I
[56:08] couldn't have come in 2022 I wouldn't
[56:10] have come in 2020 one I had to come in
[56:13] 2023 while I'm preaching about Psalm 23
[56:17] to this flock named the Good Shepherd of
[56:20] the Flocka oh my that just makes me so
[56:23] excited if I Don't Preach anything
[56:25] spiritual I'm more of a zealous to know
[56:27] that in 2023 I preached in this
[56:30] congregation somebody say Amen to that
[56:33] so I'm happy or by myself because I'm
[56:37] here praise the Lord preaching about
[56:39] Psalms 23. let me put a disclaimer out
[56:43] there there is nothing new nothing fancy
[56:45] it's just what God has put upon my heart
[56:47] for today praise the Lord so the
[56:50] scripture starts by saying the Lord is
[56:53] my shepherd He is not saying the Lord is
[56:57] our
[56:58] I need you to you to note of that this
[57:01] is a scripture that is very selfish and
[57:04] I particularly hold it with a selfish
[57:06] notion I don't know about you but the
[57:09] Lord is my shepherd and because he's my
[57:12] shepherd he's led me to this place in
[57:15] Minnesota the place that I grew up
[57:17] reading in geography that there is a
[57:19] city with Twin Cities Saint Paul's and
[57:23] uh Minneapolis praise the Lord in the
[57:25] state of Minnesota so I'm walking
[57:27] through my geography Brook right now so
[57:30] I'm so happy that the great Shepherd has
[57:33] made me be familiar with all you folks
[57:36] so let me tell you if you are thinking
[57:39] that this is a scripture in the psalm
[57:41] for all of us you are thoroughly
[57:43] mistaken the scripture says the Lord is
[57:46] my shepherd because it's speaking about
[57:49] a personal revelation that David had
[57:52] having been a Shepherd boy himself he
[57:55] understood the responsibility and the
[57:58] weight that ownership and then you
[58:00] figure out there that if I have to be
[58:02] led if I have to be someone that is
[58:05] actually leading like I lead my sheep
[58:08] who would I want to be my shepherd and
[58:10] he decided conclusively that I don't
[58:12] know about my brother earlier I don't
[58:15] know about my father just say but I know
[58:17] for certainty that the Lord is my
[58:20] shepherd I could stand right there and
[58:23] just clarify that he is a very very
[58:25] selfish man there Comes A Time in one's
[58:29] life that God is going to be somebody
[58:31] that you are are familiar with or
[58:33] acquainted with and have a personal
[58:36] selfish relationship where he begins to
[58:39] guide you so let me tell you the Lord is
[58:41] my shepherd so I have come to tell you
[58:44] about my shepherd praise the Lord making
[58:47] him my shepherd does not exclude you you
[58:50] just have to have your own personal
[58:52] revelation and you can join us in this
[58:55] choir of saying the Lord is my shepherd
[58:59] praise the Lord says I shall not want
[59:03] praise the Lord the fact that the Lord
[59:06] is my shepherd He has a responsibility
[59:08] for my provision I shall not want praise
[59:12] the Lord if you have to delve deep into
[59:14] that part that says I shall not want
[59:17] praise the Lord it means I shall not
[59:20] diminish
[59:21] praise the Lord I shall not lack praise
[59:25] the Lord there is nothing that he has in
[59:28] store for me that will be beyond my rich
[59:31] praise the Lord and he says he maketh me
[59:34] to lie down in Green Pastures and he
[59:37] lead at me beside the Still Waters now
[59:39] the purpose for making the people of God
[59:42] lie in Green Pastures is such that they
[59:45] can defect yes with fresh food from the
[59:48] pasture now they are not supposed to be
[59:51] mobile when they are in the green
[59:53] pasture they are supposed to be lying
[59:55] comfortably eating as the shepherd is
[59:59] providing somebody say Amen to that then
[1:00:02] he says he leads me besides the Still
[1:00:05] Waters praise the Lord why so that there
[1:00:08] is no disturbance
[1:00:10] because you're feeding on the passage of
[1:00:14] God will determine what happens in verse
[1:00:18] number three verse number three says he
[1:00:20] restoreth my soul praise the Lord so
[1:00:24] there is no soul restoration without
[1:00:27] eating from the green pasture somebody
[1:00:30] say Amen to that that is why the prophet
[1:00:32] was given a mandate to store up the food
[1:00:35] yes because that becomes our Green
[1:00:38] Pastures and if we eat of that pasture
[1:00:41] then the next step which is so
[1:00:44] restoration takes place without Green
[1:00:47] Pastures there is no restoration without
[1:00:50] good food there is no restoration that's
[1:00:53] why the diet of the sheep is very
[1:00:55] particular you can give it what it's not
[1:00:58] prescribed to eat praise the Lord if you
[1:01:00] give it anything different to what's
[1:01:03] supposed to eat then what will happen is
[1:01:06] the soul will be malnourished and
[1:01:08] subsequently there will be no soul
[1:01:10] restoration the reason for the proper
[1:01:13] food to come to the ship is so that they
[1:01:17] can be Soul restoration somebody say
[1:01:19] Amen to that if there is sore
[1:01:22] restoration then God has accomplished
[1:01:25] this purpose he has shepherded you you
[1:01:29] shall not want he feeds you then he
[1:01:31] makes sure your soul is restored because
[1:01:34] when your soul is restored something has
[1:01:36] got to take place praise the Lord you
[1:01:39] begin to become a candidate of what we
[1:01:41] call the third pool because it's an
[1:01:43] operation from the soul it's not an
[1:01:45] operation from the body it's not an
[1:01:47] operation from the spirit it's an
[1:01:49] operation from the soul your soul must
[1:01:52] have what we call I don't know about you
[1:01:55] folks but I've read a lot about America
[1:01:57] amen down the South they call it soul
[1:01:59] food praise the Lord because food will
[1:02:02] be so nice there will be colored greens
[1:02:04] fried chicken amen uh you name it a
[1:02:09] barbecue ribs uh crayfish uh shrimp the
[1:02:15] more the food the more Soulful it is
[1:02:17] they say praise the Lord so we must
[1:02:20] never be furnished when it comes to the
[1:02:22] word of God say Amen to that somebody
[1:02:25] so he says he praise the Lord he leadeth
[1:02:28] me beside the Still Waters he restoreth
[1:02:32] my soul
[1:02:34] praise the Lord he leadeth me in the
[1:02:37] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:02:39] sake
[1:02:40] yay so I walk through the valley of the
[1:02:44] shadow of death I will fear no evil for
[1:02:47] thou art with me thyroid and thy stuff
[1:02:52] they comfort me thou prepare us the
[1:02:55] table before me in the presence of mine
[1:02:58] enemies
[1:02:59] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:03:03] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:03:05] shall follow me
[1:03:07] I like that it's not us pursuing
[1:03:10] goodness and mercy is goodness and mercy
[1:03:13] behind us following us somebody say Amen
[1:03:17] to that praise the Lord says
[1:03:20] surely goodness and message shall follow
[1:03:22] me all the days of my life and I'll
[1:03:24] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:03:26] amen of particular note in this Psalm is
[1:03:30] that it has
[1:03:33] 17 personal pronouns
[1:03:37] so it's a very selfish sound
[1:03:40] praise the lord it's not a Psalm I
[1:03:43] desire to say so Pastor what are you
[1:03:46] doing in front I'm only telling you
[1:03:48] about my shepherd hoping that he might
[1:03:50] become your Shepherd then together we
[1:03:52] might be able to say he's as mine as he
[1:03:55] is yours praise the Lord how many
[1:03:58] remember the story of brother Branham
[1:03:59] and his two daughters and uh Rebecca
[1:04:01] being young and the other one
[1:04:04] Sarah being also young and and daddy
[1:04:07] came from campaigns and and and Rebecca
[1:04:11] Ren and outran uh the little sister and
[1:04:14] gave daddy a hug and say Dad he's got
[1:04:16] all of me pray so I said I've got all of
[1:04:19] that he said said Rebecca and then Sarah
[1:04:22] somehow God gave her an instinct instant
[1:04:25] revelation of of of how to answer his
[1:04:28] sister he says you might have all of
[1:04:30] daddy but I want to tell you something
[1:04:32] daddy is got all of me praise the Lord
[1:04:36] so that's what I'm just trying to put
[1:04:37] across right there to you that I don't
[1:04:39] know about you folks praise the Lord but
[1:04:41] this is a very selfish sound you can
[1:04:44] join me and making it his he's becoming
[1:04:48] your Shepherd in your own right somebody
[1:04:49] say Amen to that so now if you count the
[1:04:55] number of there's no pronouns in this
[1:04:58] particular sound they are 17. the Lord
[1:05:02] is my one
[1:05:04] I too shall not want
[1:05:07] ye maketh me free
[1:05:10] you can read the whole personal pronouns
[1:05:14] in the 17 of them
[1:05:16] all just there is no inclusiveness he's
[1:05:20] not even speaking about his mama or his
[1:05:22] daddy he's not even speaking about the
[1:05:25] prophet who anoints him is just the Lord
[1:05:28] is my shepherd I shall not run me my me
[1:05:31] is is an i i it's a very very very
[1:05:34] selfish sound praise the Lord and the
[1:05:38] only other time we see selfish
[1:05:39] scriptures is when we see praise the
[1:05:41] lord the devil praise the Lord as
[1:05:44] Lucifer saying I shall Ascend to the
[1:05:48] most I I shall I I I in one scripture
[1:05:52] there's about four or five six personal
[1:05:54] pronouns of selfishness because he was a
[1:05:57] devil but right here I want to tell you
[1:05:59] brothers and sisters you can have an
[1:06:02] exclusive relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:06:05] that he becomes your absolute Shepherd
[1:06:09] praise the Lord you can give him all
[1:06:12] that you want so now I've got to put
[1:06:15] that scripture out to contrast the
[1:06:18] before I announce my title Jeremiah
[1:06:20] chapter number 23 verse 1 to 4. who
[1:06:24] would be unto the pastors that destroy
[1:06:26] and Scatter the ship of the my of my
[1:06:28] pasture saith the Lord therefore thus
[1:06:32] saith the Lord the god of Israel against
[1:06:34] the pastors that Feed My People
[1:06:37] ye have scattered my flock
[1:06:40] and have driven them away and have not
[1:06:44] visited them behold I will visit you
[1:06:46] upon the evil of your doings saith the
[1:06:49] Lord and I will gather the remnant of my
[1:06:52] flock out of the countries whether I
[1:06:54] have driven them and I will bring them
[1:06:56] again to my fault to their Falls and
[1:06:59] they shall be fruitful and increase and
[1:07:03] I will set up Shepherds over them which
[1:07:07] shall feed them and they shall fear no
[1:07:09] evil nor will be dismayed neither shall
[1:07:13] they be lacking saith the Lord
[1:07:16] now you find David
[1:07:18] and Jeremiah
[1:07:20] speak about this Shepherd
[1:07:23] how be it encapsulating all the
[1:07:26] qualities of a good shepherd it starts
[1:07:29] with a rebuke because they have not fed
[1:07:31] the Sheep but God being interested in
[1:07:35] the ship he gives a promise that I will
[1:07:37] always be a God that has a notion of a
[1:07:41] soul restoration so they cannot be so
[1:07:44] restoration unless the flock are fed
[1:07:47] and if they are fed then they will be
[1:07:50] fruitful and then he goes on further to
[1:07:52] say that when I feed your soul amen I'm
[1:07:56] paraphrasing then you will not fear
[1:07:58] praise the Lord and also you will not be
[1:08:01] dismayed and also you will not let and
[1:08:05] also you will have all the qualities of
[1:08:08] the Revelation that David had so you
[1:08:10] find Jeremiah is stepping into David's
[1:08:13] Revelation amen
[1:08:15] and the Revelation that David had as
[1:08:18] much as it was him relating to his God
[1:08:21] it was so inspirational that it became a
[1:08:24] standard of standards for the ship
[1:08:26] somebody say Amen to that and I give you
[1:08:29] to understand for a title I want to
[1:08:31] preach about The Marvelous Shepherd
[1:08:33] praise the Lord that's my title tonight
[1:08:35] that God is interested in being a
[1:08:38] marvelous Shepherd to you say Amen to
[1:08:41] that and have pre-fisted marvelous
[1:08:45] Shepherd there is a purpose and the
[1:08:46] reason why I put it like that praise the
[1:08:49] Lord and we all know that John chapter
[1:08:51] 10 verse 1 to 10 every obviously being
[1:08:55] the Church of the Good Shepherd it's a
[1:08:57] scripture you're probably too familiar
[1:08:58] with somebody say Amen to that it's the
[1:09:01] chapter of the Good Shepherd of the
[1:09:04] flock and I give you to understand Jesus
[1:09:07] himself who inspired praise the Lord
[1:09:10] David to catch the revelation of that
[1:09:13] intimate relationship of Shepherd and
[1:09:15] she ship and also give Jeremiah that
[1:09:18] same Revelation to capture the essence
[1:09:21] of being a good shepherd so for for that
[1:09:25] to be a good shepherd there had to be a
[1:09:27] contrast of a bad Shepherd and therefore
[1:09:29] out of it should come a marvelous
[1:09:31] Shepherd so you will find in the two
[1:09:34] contrasting scriptures the whole epitome
[1:09:36] of it comes and is encapsulated in John
[1:09:40] chapter 10 praise the Lord from verse 1
[1:09:43] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:09:45] entered not in the door into the
[1:09:47] sheepfall but climb it up some way the
[1:09:50] same is a thief and a robber but he that
[1:09:53] entered not in the door is The Shepherd
[1:09:56] of the ship to him the Potter openeth
[1:09:59] and the sheep hear his voice amen and
[1:10:02] equalities owned by name is shipped by
[1:10:06] name and lead them out and when he put
[1:10:08] her forth his own ship he got before
[1:10:10] them and the Sheep follow him for they
[1:10:14] know his voice
[1:10:15] the a stranger they will not follow but
[1:10:19] will flee from him for they know not the
[1:10:21] voice of strangers a lot can be said
[1:10:24] about these scriptures but I'm just
[1:10:25] going through to get to the point in
[1:10:27] other words like you all say in America
[1:10:29] I'm cutting to the chase praise the Lord
[1:10:33] this number six this Parable spake Jesus
[1:10:37] unto them but they understood not what
[1:10:41] things they were which he spake unto
[1:10:45] them
[1:10:46] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[1:10:51] verily I say unto you I am the dough of
[1:10:56] the ship
[1:10:58] praise the Lord all that ever came
[1:11:01] before me are thieves and robbers but
[1:11:06] the ship did not hear them I am the door
[1:11:09] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:11:13] saved and shall go in and out and find
[1:11:17] pasture you always see the predominant
[1:11:21] component in a shepherdship relationship
[1:11:24] is pasture
[1:11:27] and Leadership praise the Lord
[1:11:30] then he goes on to say the fifth cometh
[1:11:33] not but to steal to kill and to destroy
[1:11:36] I am come that they might have life and
[1:11:40] that they might have it more
[1:11:43] abundantly
[1:11:45] amen now
[1:11:47] that which was a revelation
[1:11:50] has now been made flesh
[1:11:54] and this time
[1:11:56] speak and say you shall not lack he
[1:11:59] further goes on to say no not only will
[1:12:01] you like you shall have abundance I've
[1:12:04] come that you might have your life
[1:12:06] abundantly you see lacking and provision
[1:12:09] could be breaking even but I've come to
[1:12:12] do more than break even in your life to
[1:12:14] give you a life that is fully fulfilled
[1:12:17] a life of abundance a life of provision
[1:12:20] a life where things are according to how
[1:12:24] you have eaten in the diet of the
[1:12:27] pastors I've given you
[1:12:30] when you come to understand nutrition
[1:12:33] you will understand that good nutrition
[1:12:36] means longevity good nutrition means
[1:12:40] strength good nutrition means immunity
[1:12:44] from diseases so if you are eating and
[1:12:47] feeding from the Good Shepherd he has to
[1:12:50] make sure that you eat from a menu in
[1:12:53] the diet that consists of the nutrients
[1:12:55] that will make you survive in lower this
[1:12:58] year in 2023
[1:13:00] somebody say Amen to that
[1:13:03] praise the Lord praise the Lord I hope
[1:13:06] we're getting on okay it's an
[1:13:08] introductory service praise the Lord and
[1:13:11] I'm I'm overwhelmed that your response
[1:13:13] praise the Lord and I'm truly grateful
[1:13:15] to God for that amen so you see now what
[1:13:19] was David's Revelation amen what was
[1:13:22] Jeremiah's prophecy in Jeremiah was
[1:13:25] coming from a perspective of rebuking
[1:13:27] The Not So marvelous Shepherds and
[1:13:29] asking that they be turned to marvelous
[1:13:31] Shepherds and therefore my title is The
[1:13:34] Marvelous Shepherd praise the Lord allow
[1:13:37] me brothers and sisters to go again and
[1:13:39] read from this quotation seven compound
[1:13:42] names of Jehovah
[1:13:45] 18 praise the Lord now
[1:13:49] from here we want to make a quotation
[1:13:53] and now I have written out of the
[1:13:55] envelope here that I carried the seven
[1:13:58] compound names of Jehovah
[1:14:02] in other words it was Jehovah it was
[1:14:07] what Jehovah is
[1:14:10] is made up in these seven Redemptive
[1:14:14] names of his
[1:14:17] in other words God wants to identify
[1:14:20] himself by his characteristics and now
[1:14:23] God his attitude towards the people from
[1:14:28] Eden Back to Eden is left in these seven
[1:14:33] Redemptive names
[1:14:35] praise the Lord
[1:14:37] that makes me understand that if you
[1:14:41] were predestinated called of God from
[1:14:44] Eden before the foundation of the world
[1:14:46] and you are going back to God everything
[1:14:49] you will ever need God mix it within the
[1:14:53] framework of the seven compound
[1:14:56] Redemptive names at one point you either
[1:15:00] need one of them or two of them or all
[1:15:03] of them but whatever you require if
[1:15:05] Jehovah has to be Jehovah it's all
[1:15:07] contained in the Redemptive name
[1:15:10] somebody say Amen to that so the prophet
[1:15:13] came with it written on the paper like
[1:15:16] an envelope says I've written them all
[1:15:18] on the paper to read to the church and
[1:15:20] then he says the first one being Jehovah
[1:15:24] Jireh which means the Lord will provide
[1:15:27] himself a sacrifice praise the Lord the
[1:15:30] second one is Jehovah Rapha the Lord the
[1:15:34] Healer Manassas Shalom our peace then
[1:15:37] Roy is Shepherd now give I give you to
[1:15:43] understand he can never be a Shepherd
[1:15:46] unless he is of the highest order that's
[1:15:50] why my title is The Marvelous Shepherd
[1:15:53] and I'm preaching that in the
[1:15:55] congregation called
[1:15:58] aha so I'm here to tell you that your
[1:16:01] Shepherd ain't just good he's marvelous
[1:16:04] praise the Lord he is so marvelous in
[1:16:08] the word marvelous means he's full of
[1:16:10] Wonders things that will make you grasp
[1:16:14] in all things that will make you Marvel
[1:16:17] at his wisdom things that will make you
[1:16:20] be surprised at every time things that
[1:16:23] will make you think ain't God good
[1:16:24] things whenever you are caught between a
[1:16:27] rock and a hard place and you don't know
[1:16:28] how to come out he just comes out there
[1:16:30] he provides for himself a sacrifice
[1:16:33] everything marvelous somebody say Amen
[1:16:36] to that
[1:16:37] all right yay praise the Lord in the
[1:16:41] highest give God some crazy Place amen
[1:16:43] and amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:51] praise the Lord
[1:16:52] now
[1:16:53] to recap again we've got David catching
[1:16:57] it by Revelation we've got Jeremiah
[1:16:59] inspired to rebuke then now we have the
[1:17:02] Lord Jesus Christ coming on the scene
[1:17:04] and telling the people I am the Good
[1:17:07] Shepherd praise the Lord in telling the
[1:17:10] people that have come that you might
[1:17:11] have life and have it abundantly which
[1:17:14] means the formula for abundancy is in
[1:17:18] his compound Redemptive names at one
[1:17:20] point you need him to jail you at
[1:17:23] another point you need him to Rapha you
[1:17:25] and another point you need him for your
[1:17:27] peace at another point you need him for
[1:17:29] something
[1:17:30] somebody say Amen to that
[1:17:34] so is he he is our Rafa our
[1:17:37] righteousness and Shalom the Lord is
[1:17:39] present Lord Sharma the Lord the one I'm
[1:17:43] going to speak on is on Psalm 64. now
[1:17:46] I'm not speaking on Psalm 64. I'm
[1:17:48] speaking on the foundation of his
[1:17:50] personality encapsulated by a man
[1:17:53] through Revelation somebody say Amen to
[1:17:56] that when David wrote himself it wasn't
[1:17:59] just poetry or a song it now became much
[1:18:03] deeper because it connected with who God
[1:18:05] is
[1:18:06] praise the Lord and let me tell brothers
[1:18:09] and sisters in the message of the hour
[1:18:11] we have the correct diet to transform
[1:18:13] our bodies which means the pastors are
[1:18:15] too good praise the Lord from 1947 to 65
[1:18:19] all that the bride needs is in them
[1:18:21] tapes and books somebody say Amen to
[1:18:23] that and in that span of life God wants
[1:18:27] to be known by his eyes characteristics
[1:18:30] the prophet says he is listen to this he
[1:18:34] says his attitude
[1:18:36] in other words how he thinks of you from
[1:18:40] Eden
[1:18:42] to Eden
[1:18:43] is wrapped up in these words
[1:18:45] praise and that is why you should never
[1:18:48] be a one-trick pony if you see somebody
[1:18:51] requesting and requiring something that
[1:18:54] you already have and you say well I'm
[1:18:56] not like that well I don't have to pray
[1:18:57] for that I have that somebody at some
[1:19:00] point needs something within the
[1:19:01] framework
[1:19:02] of the Redemptive names
[1:19:05] because God has always been wanted to be
[1:19:07] known as Jehovah not God almighty God
[1:19:11] almighty is for everyone but Jehovah is
[1:19:15] what you make him be he will be to you
[1:19:18] what you catch and have a revelation of
[1:19:21] what he is for you somebody say Amen to
[1:19:23] that so God comes in the beginning of
[1:19:26] the Exodus he speaks to Moses and says
[1:19:29] by my name Jehovah was I not known only
[1:19:33] they knew me by the name God Almighty
[1:19:37] which means it's an Universal name and
[1:19:42] just like if you come to America and
[1:19:44] don't understand a few things you'll see
[1:19:46] everyone is American from state to state
[1:19:49] until you find out that each state has
[1:19:51] its own governor and its Governor is its
[1:19:54] own laws and they all have different
[1:19:55] taxation system praise the Lord but
[1:19:58] they're all Americans what happens here
[1:20:00] is not what happens in Georgia it's not
[1:20:02] what happens in Florida amen is not what
[1:20:04] happens in the swing states it is but
[1:20:06] yet you all call yourself Americans
[1:20:08] praise the Lord now God knowing his
[1:20:12] nature that I cannot be a one-trick pony
[1:20:15] and operate and be predicted I will have
[1:20:17] to put a name that when Moses asked who
[1:20:21] to move up slavery sent me I'll say the
[1:20:24] I am so that you can fill in the party
[1:20:26] you want him to be in your life
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:32] Moses was told go and tell them that I
[1:20:34] am
[1:20:35] he sent me and then after a few chapters
[1:20:38] God comes down on the scene and says to
[1:20:40] Moses the name I am shall be
[1:20:43] a name for all generations
[1:20:46] which means you cannot Corner God you
[1:20:49] cannot box him you cannot say he is God
[1:20:52] because of this and that everybody is to
[1:20:56] experience God in their own revelation
[1:20:59] of who he is somebody say Amen to that
[1:21:02] I've had the privilege or amen or
[1:21:05] fellowshipping with people that have
[1:21:07] survived brutal War praise the Lord I've
[1:21:10] never been to where they were throwing
[1:21:11] stones I'm talking about people that dug
[1:21:13] bullets to those people they were not
[1:21:16] looking to pray for the house a house is
[1:21:19] what they were fleeing from they were
[1:21:20] looking for somewhere for to land which
[1:21:23] is that their request for God was Lord
[1:21:25] Make Me safe
[1:21:27] meanwhile someone is saying Lord if you
[1:21:29] are with me help me build this building
[1:21:32] that's a diversity and you must
[1:21:35] appreciate God in his uniqueness because
[1:21:37] each person has got to relate to God in
[1:21:39] their own experience
[1:21:41] praise the Lord so if you haven't
[1:21:43] experienced God in a certain way that
[1:21:45] somebody has experienced don't judge
[1:21:47] them because God put a very very very
[1:21:51] broad way of experience he says right as
[1:21:55] long as you come within the seven
[1:21:56] Frameworks right say Amen to that
[1:21:59] somebody I live in England and I've met
[1:22:02] people that have come as refugees to
[1:22:06] them those that came as refugees all
[1:22:09] they wanted was stability and they stay
[1:22:11] something that allows them to work every
[1:22:14] man within the framework of the laws of
[1:22:16] that state but to somebody who's never
[1:22:19] had to look for any Visa or stay in
[1:22:22] another place it's so it's so awkward
[1:22:24] that it's like why can't you go home
[1:22:27] praise the Lord there's no home to go to
[1:22:29] heaven is God's throne and Earth Is His
[1:22:32] footstool we should have that Liberty of
[1:22:34] knowing that God will provide based on
[1:22:38] our needs based on our experiences
[1:22:41] somebody say Amen to that
[1:22:44] hmm
[1:22:45] Blessed Be His holy name
[1:22:48] so what someone might be praying for
[1:22:50] might be different to what you
[1:22:51] experience and your prayers are as far
[1:22:54] as the East is from the west but God is
[1:22:57] still able to say oh you need me to gyro
[1:23:00] you I will jail you need me to give you
[1:23:03] a peace of mind I will give it right
[1:23:06] praise the Lord
[1:23:08] see I've come in a place where I know
[1:23:11] there are people who fled for their
[1:23:13] lives praise the Lord just wanting to
[1:23:16] survive others walked distances as far
[1:23:19] as their feet could carry them praise
[1:23:21] the Lord amen others praise the Lord
[1:23:23] they have lived a luxurious life the
[1:23:26] life is so boring they are thinking of
[1:23:28] suicide those are two diverse people the
[1:23:31] other one wants peace they want mental
[1:23:34] health the other one is running away the
[1:23:38] amen saying I just want survival their
[1:23:40] health is okay in terms of mentality
[1:23:42] they know that they ought not to die but
[1:23:45] somebody is so full of luxury they think
[1:23:47] that life could be better they even have
[1:23:50] enough money to buy a gun to blow their
[1:23:52] own head praise the Lord that one means
[1:23:55] the God of Peace the other one needs the
[1:23:57] good that provides they are coming from
[1:23:59] two different perspectives
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] then you find somebody who was born
[1:24:06] barren they are issuing their prayer
[1:24:09] request is Lord just a baby I don't mind
[1:24:11] whether it's a boy or a girl others they
[1:24:14] just have babies they don't even have to
[1:24:16] pray for babies babies just come theirs
[1:24:19] is Lord provide for me to provide for my
[1:24:22] babies
[1:24:24] somebody say Amen to that
[1:24:27] and you find somebody with nine babies
[1:24:29] and a little apartment and then you find
[1:24:31] somebody with two babies and a large
[1:24:33] farm your provision level are different
[1:24:35] but God will still meet every request
[1:24:38] from every individual praise the Lord
[1:24:41] hey Pastor I I hope I don't get you into
[1:24:43] trouble I just preach how I feel praise
[1:24:45] the Lord amen I hope I'm helping
[1:24:49] somebody being able to put themselves in
[1:24:52] somebody else's shoes because if you
[1:24:54] haven't been in my shoes you will not
[1:24:56] understand my needs
[1:24:59] praise the Lord oh my my my I always get
[1:25:02] into trouble that's why I don't get
[1:25:03] invited in many places I just get into
[1:25:05] stuff that goes under the skin praise
[1:25:08] the Lord I'm not a generic preacher I'm
[1:25:11] just awkward you'll see the awkwardness
[1:25:13] doesn't start with my height it goes
[1:25:15] into my preaching as well praise the
[1:25:17] Lord so do you see how God wanted to
[1:25:20] identify himself
[1:25:21] he comes to the prophet he says right
[1:25:24] I've wrote them all here praise the Lord
[1:25:26] this is how God wants to identify with
[1:25:30] his people so I'll read that quote one
[1:25:32] more time so that I really cement it
[1:25:34] praise the Lord now
[1:25:36] from here we want to make a quotation
[1:25:39] which means it's something that you can
[1:25:42] put on a poster the quotation the
[1:25:44] prophet made
[1:25:46] we want to make a quotation
[1:25:48] and now I have written out on the
[1:25:50] envelope here that I've carried the
[1:25:53] seven compound Redemptive names of
[1:25:55] Jehovah in other words it was what
[1:25:59] Jehovah is is made up of these seven
[1:26:05] Redemptive names of his
[1:26:08] and look we have highlighted now his
[1:26:12] attitude
[1:26:13] towards the people from Eden Back to
[1:26:18] Eden is wrapped in these seven
[1:26:21] Redemptive names
[1:26:23] so if you want to know how he thinks of
[1:26:25] you
[1:26:26] his attitude towards your challenge
[1:26:29] if it's kept if it's captured as a
[1:26:32] solution in the Redemptive names that's
[1:26:35] his attitude
[1:26:37] if you like he wants to provide
[1:26:39] praise the Lord if you have no peace you
[1:26:42] want to provide then the rest of all has
[1:26:46] always been said and done there is one
[1:26:48] outstanding attitude he has he wants to
[1:26:50] be your Shepherd he becomes Roy
[1:26:54] to lead you to guide you to feed you
[1:26:58] somebody say Amen to that allow me to
[1:27:01] read the beginning and ending of General
[1:27:02] dispensation 1955. now
[1:27:05] a man that's really got his face towards
[1:27:07] heaven no matter what takes place here
[1:27:10] on Earth he still got his face towards
[1:27:13] heaven
[1:27:14] his friends May forsake Him
[1:27:16] his family may forsake Him he's Pastor
[1:27:19] May forsake Him but there is one that
[1:27:22] won't forsake Him that's God and when
[1:27:25] your mind is made up I like that yes
[1:27:28] praise the Lord now in the message
[1:27:30] beginning and ending of General
[1:27:31] dispensation brother Abraham is dealing
[1:27:33] with the life of David and the
[1:27:36] Patriarchs the people that are in
[1:27:38] Babylon so that we have a clear
[1:27:40] understanding of what it is to be in
[1:27:42] this day because it's a day that's been
[1:27:44] prophesied about somebody say Amen to
[1:27:46] that then he goes on to say Daniel had
[1:27:49] bent all the bridges behind him he
[1:27:51] wasn't planning on going back anymore he
[1:27:54] wasn't watching his back
[1:27:57] his backside Trail he was looking
[1:28:00] forsaking those things which are in the
[1:28:03] past
[1:28:04] there must come a time where you forsake
[1:28:06] the things that are in the past he
[1:28:08] pressed on to the mark of High Calling
[1:28:10] that's what we should be doing that's
[1:28:13] what the church should be doing you
[1:28:16] cannot live in the past of who has
[1:28:18] abused you what has gone on whatever
[1:28:20] you've gone through whatever challenge
[1:28:22] you have faced you've got to come to a
[1:28:25] point where you say you know what I'm a
[1:28:27] Survivor and because I'm a Survivor God
[1:28:30] Will Make A Way
[1:28:33] you can't be 82 talking about a beast
[1:28:37] that happened to you at 16. there should
[1:28:39] come a time you have closure to that and
[1:28:42] know that whatever whatever couldn't
[1:28:44] kill you is because the great Shepherd
[1:28:46] was there to help you
[1:28:50] praise the lord we are living in a day
[1:28:52] where everything and everyone at some
[1:28:57] point has been abused
[1:28:59] the issue is let's find who hasn't been
[1:29:02] abused but how is it that we have people
[1:29:04] that have gone through the West gone to
[1:29:07] hell and back but when they found Jesus
[1:29:09] they found a great Shepherd their life
[1:29:12] started to be fed with the word as they
[1:29:15] were fed their soul was restored
[1:29:18] everyone your soul has been restored
[1:29:20] forgetting the things that are passed
[1:29:22] you move towards the mark of a high
[1:29:25] calling

[1:29:29] still living with the traumas of War
[1:29:32] when God brought you out of War we call
[1:29:34] that past traumatic stress disorder
[1:29:37] there is no scripture for that but the
[1:29:40] scripture we know that if you've gone
[1:29:42] through turmoil that same God can bring
[1:29:45] some peace upon your life
[1:29:48] amen that's right somebody said I'll
[1:29:51] give the message a chance don't come
[1:29:54] into the message with your hand over
[1:29:56] from your past life forgetting the
[1:29:58] things that are past put yourself in a
[1:30:00] position of saying this is a brand new
[1:30:03] start

[1:30:21] you should look like your past look like
[1:30:24] your future somebody say Amen to that
[1:30:26] that's the purpose and the point with
[1:30:28] which we should preach to forget the
[1:30:31] things that are past
[1:30:32] right
[1:30:34] Daniel had to bend those bridges Daniel
[1:30:37] never walked around telling people do
[1:30:39] you know me my name is Daniel I'm the
[1:30:42] one that was putting the ferry fan in
[1:30:44] the in the in the Lion's denim that
[1:30:45] survived Brothers now let me tell you
[1:30:47] the devil is real I was putting no
[1:30:50] that was an incident that happened and
[1:30:53] God kept him through that incident and
[1:30:55] when God keeps you through an incident
[1:30:57] no matter how painful it's a point for
[1:31:00] you to give God praise
[1:31:05] somebody say Amen to that
[1:31:07] so he says that that's what the church
[1:31:09] should be doing
[1:31:10] praise the Lord
[1:31:12] and as I notice then God permitted Satan
[1:31:16] to give him the test whatever you've
[1:31:19] been through
[1:31:21] who allowed it
[1:31:25] whatever you've come across that was
[1:31:27] very horrific and very painful who
[1:31:29] allowed it
[1:31:33] to give him the test and all they tested
[1:31:36] them by the fire they tested them by the
[1:31:39] Lion's Den and in every instant
[1:31:43] in every instant
[1:31:45] in every instant
[1:31:47] God brought them out more than
[1:31:51] Victorious
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:55] do you see that
[1:31:57] many other testings of the righteous but
[1:32:02] God delivereth him out of them all
[1:32:06] how marvelous that is
[1:32:11] how we appreciate that
[1:32:14] I don't suppose when you're going
[1:32:16] through it file there is a sense of
[1:32:17] appreciation but the appreciation comes
[1:32:20] after you've gone through the trial then
[1:32:23] he says here
[1:32:24] then we appreciate that
[1:32:27] amen amen trials tribulations tests all
[1:32:33] working for the good
[1:32:35] after a while God can see then
[1:32:39] that he can put his trust in you and
[1:32:43] then he will do great things for you it
[1:32:47] doesn't start with great things first
[1:32:48] then you trust it starts with you going
[1:32:53] through trials tribulations painful
[1:32:56] horrific situation it means that you
[1:32:59] identify the plan of God then after he
[1:33:03] trusts you to worship after he trusts
[1:33:07] you to praise him after he starts you to
[1:33:10] begin to be a person with a consistent
[1:33:13] Christian life then
[1:33:15] yeah then
[1:33:18] then he can say right
[1:33:21] let's be let's make you more Victorious
[1:33:25] I've seen a lot of people that say if
[1:33:27] God loves me you see I will worship him
[1:33:29] if he does this and this and this and
[1:33:31] this wrong way of doing the formula the
[1:33:33] formula is you've got to be tried and
[1:33:35] tested and it's going to be thorough and
[1:33:37] see that you actually love him despite
[1:33:40] and in spite you've been to Hell and
[1:33:42] back and your thought process towards
[1:33:45] God has not changed yet this is right
[1:33:47] now let me bring you out now I can trust
[1:33:50] you now I can give you victories
[1:33:54] praise the Lord are you hearing me
[1:33:57] Church
[1:33:57] praise the Lord and he goes on he says
[1:34:00] now
[1:34:02] we find out that Daniel became an
[1:34:04] instrument
[1:34:05] in the hand of God while he was away
[1:34:07] from his own people out of his own City
[1:34:10] away from his own church in a Strange
[1:34:12] Land God used him
[1:34:15] are you hearing that
[1:34:17] away from his own people his church he
[1:34:21] is land so which means when God was
[1:34:23] dealing with Daniel as a young believer
[1:34:25] before the Lion's Den Daniel thought he
[1:34:29] loved God he thought he trusted God and
[1:34:32] it is true he loved God he trusted God
[1:34:34] but God wasn't so sure how far he can go
[1:34:36] with Daniel so he allowed
[1:34:40] and inspired
[1:34:42] the devil to have permission
[1:34:44] to inspire the people that were against
[1:34:48] Daniel and tell them right put a law and
[1:34:52] make sure that that law will find Daniel
[1:34:55] guilty and then when we do that we will
[1:34:58] sentence him then when we sentence him
[1:35:00] then we see what becomes of this guy
[1:35:03] then Daniel found himself one morning he
[1:35:07] just woke up
[1:35:08] the laws have changed
[1:35:10] men instead of Daniel crying saying oh
[1:35:13] God you brought me out of the land of
[1:35:16] our inheritance now we are here in
[1:35:19] Babylon things have just all of a sudden
[1:35:21] changed oh God kill that leader oh no no
[1:35:25] no no
[1:35:26] when the law was put
[1:35:29] Daniel used to close his windows when he
[1:35:31] prayed
[1:35:32] but on this particular day he says I
[1:35:34] will open the windows so that you don't
[1:35:37] have to investigate and send spice
[1:35:39] you'll see me break the law as I worship
[1:35:42] by God
[1:35:44] and they came and took Daniel
[1:35:47] then says Ah if the shepherd
[1:35:50] he has ordered my footsteps to go to the
[1:35:53] Lion's Den he will make a way in the
[1:35:56] Lion's Den
[1:35:58] praise the Lord so as he got to the
[1:36:00] Lions then
[1:36:02] he wasn't afraid because he had settled
[1:36:05] in his heart that Jesus Is My Savior
[1:36:09] if it's without God
[1:36:12] so then he got into there and the Lions
[1:36:15] lost their appetite for some strange
[1:36:17] reason these lions were fasting but on
[1:36:19] this particular day
[1:36:21] they lost their appetite
[1:36:23] the Bible says God closed the mouths of
[1:36:26] lions
[1:36:27] praise the Lord and as he was there
[1:36:29] praise the Lord yes
[1:36:32] the king who was his friend who knew
[1:36:35] that the laws of the myth and the peace
[1:36:37] would never be broken came to look for
[1:36:39] Daniel in the lands then which has never
[1:36:41] happened you can never look for a person
[1:36:43] in the Lions Den especially when the
[1:36:45] Lions have been fasted and especially
[1:36:47] when somebody tiny wasn't the first to
[1:36:49] be thrown in there that's right
[1:36:51] so the king came and said oh Daniel has
[1:36:54] your God delivered you
[1:36:56] how was he expecting an answer when
[1:36:58] everybody that's gone in there has never
[1:37:00] been able to say I'm alive
[1:37:03] it means Daniel was a complete different
[1:37:05] specie in terms of his relationship with
[1:37:07] God
[1:37:08] that's what we are expected yes
[1:37:12] the message of the hour and being a
[1:37:15] Christian in this day is not a picnic we
[1:37:18] go through real trials real challenges
[1:37:21] real excruciating painful things but in
[1:37:25] that if you can identify that the Lord
[1:37:28] is your Shepherd you will surely come
[1:37:30] out and when you come out you'll be good
[1:37:33] for praise
[1:37:35] the victories you have after you've
[1:37:38] survived cannot be compared to before
[1:37:42] so in other words it's a before and
[1:37:44] after
[1:37:45] I have seen people that do flipping
[1:37:47] houses they have a before when they buy
[1:37:49] start the project and then after the
[1:37:51] project has been done thoroughly the
[1:37:52] heaven after to tell you how dilapidated
[1:37:55] and gutted this property was but it was
[1:37:59] so much hard work we put into it so much
[1:38:01] that this is the end product that's the
[1:38:03] life of a Christian it is a before and
[1:38:06] in after before trial and then after
[1:38:10] trial and watch what God will do if you
[1:38:13] survive your child without without
[1:38:15] sleeping somebody say Amen to that
[1:38:18] so he says here Daniel
[1:38:21] became an instrument you can never
[1:38:23] become an instrument but God never wants
[1:38:26] you to share
[1:38:27] a theoretical gospel he wants you to
[1:38:30] share an experience yes
[1:38:33] you can't talk about oh I survived
[1:38:37] when all you had was a headache because
[1:38:40] you never drank much water you were
[1:38:41] dehydrated
[1:38:44] there must be stuff come your way
[1:38:47] that defy who you are yes
[1:38:50] and when they Define who you are you
[1:38:53] will know for certainty that God is your
[1:38:56] absolute so when you see David saying
[1:38:59] the Lord is my shepherd He is making God
[1:39:02] his absolute
[1:39:04] Believers all this
[1:39:06] listen to this now
[1:39:08] that's right
[1:39:12] out of his own City away from his own
[1:39:14] church in a Strange Land God used him
[1:39:18] now
[1:39:20] you can be away from whatever you may be
[1:39:23] you can be away from your loved ones or
[1:39:25] you can be away from your church but you
[1:39:28] can still be an instrument in the hands
[1:39:29] of God
[1:39:30] God can use you for a testimony or for
[1:39:34] anything that he wishes to use you for
[1:39:36] beautiful examples the Bible is just so
[1:39:39] shagged full of those things everywhere
[1:39:43] you turn
[1:39:44] don't you love to read the word
[1:39:45] congregation says hey oh I love to read
[1:39:49] it sometime we weep and here a few days
[1:39:52] ago I was reading in the room there and
[1:39:56] I just had to sit down and cry like a
[1:39:58] baby I just got up and walked around my
[1:40:01] chair and put my hand on my chair and
[1:40:03] looked down at my Bible again and I
[1:40:05] broke down broke out went around the
[1:40:08] chair again looked at it again and I
[1:40:10] thought oh God here is eternal life to
[1:40:14] every man or woman that will dare put
[1:40:16] their trust in him and believe it
[1:40:18] eternal life praise the Lord this is
[1:40:20] what the prophet did he had been reading
[1:40:22] his Bible throughout the night then as
[1:40:25] he was reading and it began to impress
[1:40:29] upon his heart so deep then he began to
[1:40:31] cry and then he put his Bible on the
[1:40:34] chair he looked at he says him there is
[1:40:37] eternal life looking just at the Bible
[1:40:41] look daddy that says oh then he went
[1:40:44] around the chase
[1:40:47] oh God
[1:40:49] if you know what this is and then you
[1:40:51] put your trust in it and then he did it
[1:40:53] a few times and he says oh and he said
[1:40:56] search the scriptures in them you think
[1:40:58] you have eternal life they are they
[1:41:00] which testify of you amen then he goes
[1:41:03] on to say the word of God is a lemon to
[1:41:04] our feet what we that we should be
[1:41:07] guided then
[1:41:10] the light it's the light that follows
[1:41:12] the pathway that leads us from victory
[1:41:17] and you can never have Victory unless
[1:41:19] you've been in a battle
[1:41:21] now before you get a victory there has
[1:41:24] to be a battle and if there is no
[1:41:26] battles there is no victory
[1:41:29] which means victories start with
[1:41:31] survival stories
[1:41:32] what the devil meant for Eve
[1:41:36] remember the Good Shepherd in John
[1:41:39] chapter 10 he says the enemy comes to
[1:41:44] kill steal and destroy but I am calm
[1:41:48] that you might have
[1:41:50] life
[1:41:52] abandoned it can become more abundant
[1:41:55] than being Victorious and then
[1:41:57] thereafter have eternal life
[1:42:01] so that pathway to our Victory starts
[1:42:04] from
[1:42:05] Eden to Eden and in our survival journey
[1:42:10] we'll be using the Redemptive names
[1:42:13] praise the Lord are you happy so far
[1:42:16] praise the Lord I'm about to finish
[1:42:19] so we ought to be thankful for the
[1:42:21] battles
[1:42:23] and trying
[1:42:25] and it's God giving us the opportunity
[1:42:29] to have victories
[1:42:32] who can truly say thank you Lord for the
[1:42:36] battles and the flyings because it's
[1:42:39] God's opportunity for victories
[1:42:42] oh my those that make you a little bit
[1:42:46] better now
[1:42:47] see the battle come along somebody's
[1:42:50] saying something bad about you sickness
[1:42:53] come to you unto you maybe God give you
[1:42:56] those light afflictions that he might
[1:42:58] heal you and show you his favor to you
[1:43:01] let you see what he means by it he loves
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:07] the old Shepherd story that's told in
[1:43:10] Jerusalem in the Holy lands of a
[1:43:12] Shepherd was packing the sheep and said
[1:43:14] what are you begging it for says he's
[1:43:16] got a broken leg
[1:43:18] said
[1:43:19] how did you do that follow over the
[1:43:21] cliff said no I broke its leg
[1:43:25] he said why
[1:43:27] you're a cruel Shepherd to break the
[1:43:29] shepherd's leg said no I loved it
[1:43:33] do you understand what I'm alluding to
[1:43:37] most of you folks didn't pray to come to
[1:43:41] Minnesota
[1:43:44] no
[1:43:45] you were comfortable wherever you were
[1:43:48] but God wanted you here so trials came
[1:43:52] for all you know right now as we speak
[1:43:55] you could have been in some other place
[1:43:58] you could have been into
[1:44:00] but God didn't have a purpose for you in
[1:44:02] Timbuktu
[1:44:03] His science never LED you to Timbuktu
[1:44:06] the great Shepherd knew there's going to
[1:44:09] be a Shepherd so he had to allow the
[1:44:11] trials and testings to come from
[1:44:13] wherever you are so that you find
[1:44:16] yourself in destination Minneapolis
[1:44:20] sure that wasn't voluntary yes yes
[1:44:22] nobody chooses affliction nobody chooses
[1:44:25] nothingness to come upon their life but
[1:44:27] when it comes and you embrace it as
[1:44:29] God's leadership seeing that is the
[1:44:31] great Shepherd what will come out of it
[1:44:34] is much more sweeter than you can ever
[1:44:37] envisage
[1:44:39] praise the Lord that is why brothers and
[1:44:40] sisters no matter what you've been
[1:44:41] through don't live in your past live in
[1:44:43] your future
[1:44:44] somebody say Amen to that
[1:44:47] praise the Lord and listen to this
[1:44:51] as the prophet goes on
[1:44:53] sometimes God has to let let us break
[1:44:55] down just a little bit in health to give
[1:44:59] us extra attention to guess to get us
[1:45:02] upon his lap to who Us in his bosom
[1:45:06] when the doctor said nothing can be done
[1:45:10] how many have ever heard the news that
[1:45:13] we are so sorry
[1:45:16] your cancer that's when you say it's not
[1:45:18] mine your cancer
[1:45:22] is far gone
[1:45:24] it's malignancy
[1:45:26] is so much
[1:45:28] that there is nothing can be done
[1:45:30] then you walk into a humble church with
[1:45:32] God-fearing people and prayer
[1:45:36] changes things
[1:45:38] and then you see
[1:45:40] that what it took scientists to discover
[1:45:43] and measure and even tell you how far
[1:45:45] you can go out all it needed was for you
[1:45:48] to identify yourself as the Sheep of God
[1:45:52] praise the Lord
[1:45:53] and he says here
[1:45:56] it will give you extra attention to get
[1:45:59] us upon his lap to woo Us in his bosom
[1:46:03] when the doctor said nothing can be done
[1:46:06] then he take us into his bosom and say
[1:46:10] see I love you
[1:46:12] I'm going to let you get well
[1:46:15] oh
[1:46:16] Co doesn't that make life a little
[1:46:20] better congregation says
[1:46:23] he is so great
[1:46:25] he is a marvelous
[1:46:28] Shepherd
[1:46:29] what am I trying to tell you no matter
[1:46:31] how negative or nasty news comes upon
[1:46:36] you let not your first reaction be
[1:46:38] disappointment but rather
[1:46:41] have in you a reflex that says maybe God
[1:46:45] is trusting me right to praise him in
[1:46:48] spite and if I can Praise Him in my
[1:46:51] situation he'll be beautiful he will
[1:46:53] make a way maybe God wants to give me
[1:46:56] special attention have you ever noticed
[1:46:58] Whenever there is bad news that you
[1:47:00] clutch your Bible like you've never done
[1:47:02] before you listen to tapes like you've
[1:47:03] never done before that's God saying now
[1:47:06] let me woo you a bit
[1:47:09] let me show you my love but that didn't
[1:47:11] come by God sending you a present
[1:47:15] it came by God allowing
[1:47:19] his trust for you to let the Devil tempt
[1:47:22] you that's what he did to job
[1:47:25] being the great shepherd He under
[1:47:30] that guy will not sell out never he had
[1:47:35] properly tested and tried him and made
[1:47:38] him a guinea pig of perfection before
[1:47:40] the stage of a perfect man
[1:47:42] you has already testified to be perfect
[1:47:44] before we even knew what it took for
[1:47:46] Perfection that it took Faith virtue
[1:47:48] knowledge long-suffering Temperance
[1:47:50] right up to the Brotherly Love job was
[1:47:54] satisfied perfect amen
[1:47:56] and God was so happy with the Perfection
[1:47:58] of job he says but there's one more
[1:48:01] trial we just need to check
[1:48:04] so that before we put our stem for QC
[1:48:07] quality tested let's just make sure that
[1:48:10] a few things
[1:48:12] are in order
[1:48:14] this is
[1:48:15] even the devil wasn't interested in The
[1:48:17] Proposal
[1:48:19] slides let's have you considered myself
[1:48:21] and job
[1:48:22] the devil says
[1:48:24] why would I waste my time look at this
[1:48:27] guy you've blessed him which means you
[1:48:30] have generated him remember the
[1:48:31] Redemptive names are to work throughout
[1:48:34] from Eden to Eden you've provided for
[1:48:37] him he's got peace of mind the only
[1:48:38] thing he worries about is that his
[1:48:40] children might blaspheme so I have no
[1:48:42] business tempting job
[1:48:45] his account is okay his bank balance is
[1:48:48] fine his animals are producing well
[1:48:51] there's nothing wrong in his life why
[1:48:53] would I attempt and to top it all up
[1:48:55] you've put a hedge around him that's
[1:48:56] right
[1:48:58] and uh
[1:49:00] the devil said Lord you can't ask me to
[1:49:03] respond to him to a mission impossible
[1:49:06] says okay let's make it lighter what
[1:49:08] should we do to make it like this remove
[1:49:10] all the gods
[1:49:12] says okay we will remove the guards
[1:49:13] because we want to play fair but just
[1:49:15] don't touch his soul
[1:49:18] don't touch the guy
[1:49:19] see so what shall we do what are the
[1:49:21] parameters
[1:49:22] and if you understand that whatever
[1:49:24] you're going through parameters have
[1:49:26] been set
[1:49:28] right God will not allow you to be
[1:49:30] tempted above what you can be
[1:49:32] praise the Lord and with every
[1:49:34] Temptation there is a way of Escape
[1:49:38] he says right go ahead let's start with
[1:49:42] killing the animals
[1:49:43] it says no we want to do it in such an
[1:49:46] overwhelming Style
[1:49:48] we can't do it in installments we can
[1:49:51] make the ship die this year and the cows
[1:49:54] next year and the camels next year but
[1:49:57] one and then somewhere there we bring an
[1:50:02] epidemic and kill the children years
[1:50:04] later so let's all do it
[1:50:08] in one day
[1:50:10] and let's make sure one escapes now if
[1:50:14] you came to me to tell me my children
[1:50:16] are dead only I am escaped I'll kill you
[1:50:18] because I'll tell you why did you escape
[1:50:21] to come into me did you not have
[1:50:23] anything to do with the death of my
[1:50:24] children that's human
[1:50:26] that's humanistic but when God is flying
[1:50:30] your character he must make sure you
[1:50:33] have enough power for the victory he
[1:50:35] expects of you
[1:50:38] so he says let's do it in one day so job
[1:50:41] just wakes up on a particular Wednesday
[1:50:45] one by one
[1:50:46] it was so overwhelming
[1:50:48] such that the guy
[1:50:50] could be could not be consoled
[1:50:54] because God was sure of his Perfection
[1:50:56] just like God was sure of Daniel's
[1:50:59] Perfection yes
[1:51:01] Daniel lived a perfect life that there
[1:51:05] is nothing mentioned about Daniel's life
[1:51:07] that is disastrous
[1:51:10] God said
[1:51:11] put it on him
[1:51:13] to overwhelm him
[1:51:14] but was
[1:51:16] job overwhelmed no
[1:51:19] for some reason
[1:51:21] something within him knew that he can
[1:51:24] never fail me there is a master plan he
[1:51:27] is a great shepherd He is a marvelous
[1:51:30] Shepherd
[1:51:31] praise the Lord
[1:51:33] hence
[1:51:34] now the court goes on to say oh sorry
[1:51:37] person say sometimes
[1:51:42] when he gives us that then he becomes
[1:51:44] The Marvelous Shepherd amen and then now
[1:51:49] the prophet alludes to the fact that no
[1:51:51] wonder David said the Lord is my
[1:51:52] shepherd I shall not want and how he
[1:51:55] leads us by the side of the Still Waters
[1:51:57] and restores their soul
[1:52:00] I want you to make particular note of
[1:52:02] Soul restoration because everything that
[1:52:04] God has to do with you he's going to do
[1:52:07] it with you from the perspective that
[1:52:09] you are part of it through your soul
[1:52:12] so without your soul being restored
[1:52:15] there is nothing that your faith will
[1:52:17] latch onto that will be profitable
[1:52:19] because it's not a head knowledge
[1:52:21] it's something within
[1:52:24] yes listen to this
[1:52:27] and anoint us
[1:52:31] are anointed in the presence of your
[1:52:32] enemy just to testify
[1:52:35] till your cup
[1:52:37] boiled over you know just how marvelous
[1:52:40] he is Anointed in the presence of thine
[1:52:44] enemy now the reason why I mentioned the
[1:52:47] term nevertheless Shepherd is coming
[1:52:50] from the original word for the meaning
[1:52:52] of marvelous in the Greek you will go to
[1:52:55] the scripture of Isaiah chapter 9 verse
[1:52:58] 6 which says unto us
[1:53:01] a child is given and to us a son is born
[1:53:04] he shall be called
[1:53:07] wonderful
[1:53:09] that's the first
[1:53:11] on the names
[1:53:12] of the coming son the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:15] that word wonderful in Hebrew is Pala
[1:53:20] and Pele
[1:53:22] is the noun Pele is the adjective like
[1:53:25] Pele the footballer that word means
[1:53:28] wonderful
[1:53:31] and the only other time that scripture
[1:53:34] was used
[1:53:35] the first time it was ever used it was
[1:53:37] used in Genesis Chapter 18 when God said
[1:53:40] is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:53:43] so his name had to be called wonderful
[1:53:46] the other name for wonderful is
[1:53:48] marvelous
[1:53:49] that's why now I call him The Marvelous
[1:53:52] Shepherd and every time the prophet
[1:53:54] makes a comment on God's goodness as a
[1:53:57] Shepherd he uses marvelous Shepherd
[1:54:01] praise the Lord
[1:54:02] believe without this
[1:54:04] and he says
[1:54:06] oh my
[1:54:08] allow me to read this
[1:54:10] the Good Shepherd of the Sheep
[1:54:12] let me skip right up I've read there's
[1:54:15] quite a lot of stuff there to read let
[1:54:16] me skip right that to paragraph
[1:54:23] paragraph 22.
[1:54:26] sorrows and tears can never keep the
[1:54:29] shepherd away
[1:54:30] are you hearing that
[1:54:32] corruption he proved it at the grave of
[1:54:34] Lazarus Lazarus was one of his little
[1:54:37] lamps
[1:54:38] and he was lying in the body bottom of
[1:54:41] the pits and the stone rolled over it
[1:54:43] his body was molded the nose had dropped
[1:54:47] in the skin worms had eaten him up but
[1:54:50] the chief Shepherd come up to the Grave
[1:54:53] he node his ship by name
[1:54:57] and he speaks your name now calls you
[1:55:01] you answer now
[1:55:04] there's going to be a time set the
[1:55:06] prophet that he will call and I will
[1:55:09] answer him Lazarus was four days dead
[1:55:12] his body corrupted but the shepherd
[1:55:15] spoke in corruption knew its maker and
[1:55:19] the Soul there was four days journey
[1:55:23] watch this the body was decomposing
[1:55:28] in the grave but the soul was four days
[1:55:31] journey today from Eden to Eden
[1:55:35] are you with me
[1:55:37] and the body had been embalmed no blood
[1:55:40] the cells was broke he was rotten in the
[1:55:43] grave but the Shepherd Of Life spoke the
[1:55:47] name of his lamp and his lamp let out a
[1:55:51] bleach and said here I come
[1:55:53] then intriguing to me was the fact that
[1:55:57] this quotation had to be on paragraph
[1:55:59] 23. oh
[1:56:03] he is a marvelous Shepherd
[1:56:07] praise the Lord
[1:56:09] whether God is just trying to be
[1:56:11] humorous whether it's a coincidence but
[1:56:13] I don't think it is
[1:56:14] I honestly think that every time you
[1:56:17] read Psalm 23 and you go to the message
[1:56:19] the Good Shepherd of the word you'll
[1:56:21] understand the paragraph 23 the Lord
[1:56:24] says I am a marvelous Shepherd
[1:56:28] let him feed you
[1:56:30] you will feed you on his word
[1:56:33] the Holy Spirit lives by the word of God
[1:56:36] the great Shepherd of the flock suddenly
[1:56:38] he cannot lose one
[1:56:42] it would be a disgrace you say brother
[1:56:43] you mean to tell me that when the Bible
[1:56:47] looks it says God told Israel away down
[1:56:50] in Egypt I gave him you Palestine and
[1:56:54] now
[1:56:55] he wouldn't just let up there and be
[1:56:59] excommunicated the whole thing run them
[1:57:01] all out with the plague killed them all
[1:57:03] off he wouldn't he wouldn't have went up
[1:57:06] there and sent fear among them and drop
[1:57:09] them out of the country but he said
[1:57:13] Israel it's yours
[1:57:16] you go get it
[1:57:21] now that's where I used to have a
[1:57:23] dilemma whenever God sent you to go get
[1:57:26] something
[1:57:27] you almost think that it's going to be
[1:57:29] easy
[1:57:30] no
[1:57:32] you go get it you are thinking you will
[1:57:34] just be finding stuff that you just come
[1:57:36] because God said go get it the shepherd
[1:57:39] knows that he will not lead you unless
[1:57:41] he's given you capacity
[1:57:44] through the soul restoration so your
[1:57:47] faith is from your soul that has been
[1:57:51] restored through the feeding of the
[1:57:54] shepherd's food there when he says go
[1:57:56] for it
[1:57:58] you've got enough action and power to
[1:58:00] fight to obtain it
[1:58:02] so he then says
[1:58:04] it's yours go get it they had to fight
[1:58:07] for every inch of ground they stood on
[1:58:09] every promise
[1:58:11] in the book of The Great Shepherd
[1:58:14] is to his sheep
[1:58:17] which means the sheep have been well
[1:58:19] nourished their souls have been restored
[1:58:21] there's not enough devils in the hell
[1:58:23] that could ever stop the move of God
[1:58:25] that God fore ordained and so in their
[1:58:27] lives there is not enough abortions
[1:58:29] there is not enough depression there is
[1:58:31] not enough heartaches there is not
[1:58:33] enough death pain that you might have
[1:58:35] ever experienced that will stop the move
[1:58:37] of God that is put in your heart
[1:58:41] you see we are in the message in the
[1:58:44] message we shouldn't throw pity parties
[1:58:46] we should just point each other to the
[1:58:48] promise
[1:58:49] and as long as the word has been
[1:58:51] thoroughly put in the soul you can do
[1:58:53] more than you think you can do I have a
[1:58:56] friend of mine I won't mention his name
[1:58:58] but he's an ex is a very renowned
[1:59:01] Soldier so every time I'm driving with
[1:59:02] him in his BMW I'm asking him about a
[1:59:05] soldier things
[1:59:07] capacity how many miles have you walked
[1:59:10] what's the longest distance you've taken
[1:59:11] and he's kept on telling me that your
[1:59:14] body can take more than you think it can
[1:59:18] take only that it doesn't be subjected
[1:59:20] to those things now if a soldier by just
[1:59:24] training in the military knows what the
[1:59:27] body is capable of
[1:59:30] how much more should we know what our
[1:59:32] souls are capable of
[1:59:36] juicy brothers and sisters that whatever
[1:59:37] you're going through I've come to let
[1:59:39] you know here in Minnesota Minneapolis
[1:59:42] to be specific praise the Lord that
[1:59:45] greater is he that is in you and God
[1:59:48] through your Affliction has already
[1:59:51] trust some people have already been
[1:59:52] trusted they've seen the west of the
[1:59:55] West
[1:59:56] you can now be trusted to sit down with
[1:59:59] somebody with a problem that they can't
[2:00:01] put their head around and tell them it's
[2:00:03] going to be all right because you come
[2:00:05] out the other end
[2:00:07] may God bless you who praise the Lord as
[2:00:10] I invite our pastor praise the Lord how
[2:00:12] many believe that he's a great Shepherd
[2:00:14] tries to our
[2:00:14] [Applause]
[2:00:19] praise the Lord
[2:00:22] many times we find ourselves whenever
[2:00:25] something negative happens we think
[2:00:27] where is God does he love me
[2:00:30] he actually does that's the evidence
[2:00:32] that he does if you pass your test
[2:00:35] then you get the kind of trust that is
[2:00:37] always wanted for you to go through
[2:00:39] amen so we go through life
[2:00:42] in its stages in pain
[2:00:45] but yes there is one thing that should
[2:00:47] remain certain
[2:00:49] the power
[2:00:51] of God in our lives through his
[2:00:55] shepherding
[2:00:56] capability that is why brothers and
[2:00:59] sisters I'll tell you tonight
[2:01:01] when David said the Lord is my shepherd
[2:01:04] right there all the pain and the trauma
[2:01:08] he could have faced from his background
[2:01:10] of fighting
[2:01:12] his
[2:01:14] all Acceptance in his family
[2:01:17] Soul on the other side all the battles
[2:01:19] he knew that as long as I have got
[2:01:21] treatment at one point he came from a
[2:01:24] battle and he saw the whole entire
[2:01:25] family taken away
[2:01:27] he never
[2:01:29] he never bowed down and started speaking
[2:01:32] foolishly
[2:01:33] charging God foolishly instead what did
[2:01:36] he do he said bring me an effort and
[2:01:40] then he encouraged himself in the Lord
[2:01:41] It's the only scripture where you hear
[2:01:44] that men cried until they couldn't cry
[2:01:46] anymore
[2:01:47] and after crying instead of saying where
[2:01:50] is God they wanted to Stone
[2:01:53] David because they had a blame culture
[2:01:56] that's why I've come to tell you praise
[2:01:59] the Lord don't blame your past over your
[2:02:02] future
[2:02:03] rise up above it you have the capability
[2:02:06] the reason why you are not in some
[2:02:09] denomination and God LED you to the
[2:02:11] message he knew that's where there is
[2:02:13] the food that will allow your soul
[2:02:16] restoration he knew that there is the
[2:02:19] food that will allow a reboot
[2:02:23] you can feel on top of your situation
[2:02:26] again
[2:02:27] praise the Lord
[2:02:29] quit being a victim and don't have a
[2:02:31] victim mentality greater is he that is
[2:02:34] in you
[2:02:37] I can I will I do
[2:02:42] believe I can
[2:02:45] I will I do believe I can
[2:02:53] I will I do feel live
[2:03:01] does
[2:03:03] [Music]
[2:03:18] lead the Lord
[2:03:25] only in the Lord that Jesus is
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:38] I
[2:03:41] do
[2:03:42] believe
[2:03:44] I can
[2:03:46] I will I do believe
[2:03:52] I can I will I do
[2:03:57] believe that Jesus
[2:04:02] heals me now
[2:04:06] Saints
[2:04:08] I'm going to say I know he's led me this
[2:04:11] far
[2:04:12] but I want a much higher
[2:04:14] of a relationship with him
[2:04:17] as my great Shepherd
[2:04:19] I don't want to be a victim of
[2:04:22] circumstances
[2:04:23] but I want to overcome
[2:04:27] every circumstance
[2:04:30] is a testament
[2:04:32] that God is my shepherd
[2:04:35] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[2:04:38] want.
[2:04:42] one he leaded me to Green process
[2:04:46] though
[2:04:48] I lie in the value of the shadow of
[2:04:50] death
[2:04:51] don't never live your life with
[2:04:54] underlining fear because the Lord is
[2:04:57] still in control
[2:04:58] shall we pray
[2:05:00] our heavenly father
[2:05:02] almighty God we lift up holy hands unto
[2:05:05] you
[2:05:06] many times Lord
[2:05:08] our faith is crippled
[2:05:11] by the amount of fear we entertain but
[2:05:14] tonight father I pray in Jesus name the
[2:05:17] same Revelation you gave to David that
[2:05:20] you will stand up and raise his hands
[2:05:22] and say the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[2:05:24] not want father we want you to
[2:05:26] exclusively own us be the absolute of
[2:05:30] our lives and be our real Shepherd Let
[2:05:33] It Be almighty God that each day and its
[2:05:35] each moment we live as Christians we
[2:05:38] live a life that attracts more of you in
[2:05:41] our lives more Revelation and power
[2:05:44] available to us through the trials and
[2:05:46] temptations we go through knowing that
[2:05:49] father you never allow us to go
[2:05:51] into those things unless you have a plan
[2:05:53] to make us overcome and therefore Lord
[2:05:56] when we pass the test we almost we
[2:05:58] always come out the other end as your
[2:06:01] trusted servants to be used
[2:06:03] no doubt Lord this is an introductory
[2:06:05] service with the folks here I pray in
[2:06:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[2:06:10] these few words I've been able to say
[2:06:12] may they take meaning o God in the
[2:06:15] hearts of your people may they be a
[2:06:17] people that will come out of this place
[2:06:18] and say did our hearts Ben as he speak

[2:06:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may

[2:06:37] that are sure and Amen Let It Be Lord

[2:06:53] ask that Lord you might help these
