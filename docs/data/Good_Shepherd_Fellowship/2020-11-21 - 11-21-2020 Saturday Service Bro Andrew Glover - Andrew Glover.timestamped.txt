[44:57] it's going to be uh say man amen the
[45:00] book of numbers the 33rd chapter
[45:02] looking here in the 50th verse
[45:08] the bible here says and the lord spake
[45:10] unto moses in the plains of moab by
[45:12] jordan
[45:13] near jericho saying speak unto the
[45:16] children of israel
[45:18] and say unto them when ye are past over
[45:20] jordan
[45:21] into the land of canaan then ye shall
[45:25] drive out
[45:26] all the inhabitants of the land from
[45:28] before you
[45:30] and destroy all their pictures and
[45:32] destroy
[45:33] all their molten images and pluck down
[45:36] all their high places
[45:38] and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants
[45:40] of the land
[45:41] and dwell therein for i have given you
[45:44] the land to possess it
[45:46] and you shall divide the land by lot for
[45:48] an inheritance among your families and
[45:50] to the more
[45:51] you shall give the more inheritance and
[45:52] to the fewer you shall give the less
[45:54] inheritance
[45:56] every man's inheritance shall be in the
[45:59] place
[45:59] where his lot falleth according to the
[46:01] tribes of your fathers
[46:03] you shall inherit but if you will not
[46:06] drive out the inhabitants of the land
[46:07] from before you
[46:09] then it shall come to pass that those
[46:11] which you let remain of them shall be
[46:13] pricks
[46:14] in your eyes thorns in your sides
[46:17] and shall vex you in the land wherein
[46:18] you dwell now this is amazing how god
[46:21] tells moses this
[46:23] and moreover it shall come to pass that
[46:25] i shall do unto you
[46:27] as i thought to do unto them isn't it
[46:29] something that that disobedience
[46:31] can actually change the very thoughts of
[46:33] god that he would deal with you
[46:35] the way he would deal with his enemies
[46:38] he says now if you'll do these things i
[46:39] won't deal with you that way but if you
[46:41] don't do these
[46:42] things then i'll have to deal with you
[46:43] the way i thought to deal with your
[46:45] enemies now
[46:46] in the book of revelation the second
[46:47] chapter
[46:49] revelation the second chapter we want to
[46:51] look there in the 20th verse
[46:57] revelation the second chapter in the
[47:00] 20th
[47:00] verse
[47:03] you love the lord this evening amen
[47:06] revelation 2
[47:08] and verse number 20 here now jesus
[47:10] speaking here in this
[47:12] this age he says notwithstanding i have
[47:15] a few things against thee
[47:16] because thou suffers that woman jezebel
[47:19] which calleth herself a prophetess to
[47:22] teach
[47:23] and to seduce my servants to commit
[47:25] fornication
[47:26] and to eat things sacrificed unto idols
[47:29] now notice here in verse 21 and i gave
[47:32] her so she didn't she didn't earn this
[47:34] she didn't work herself into this but he
[47:36] actually says i gave her it was a gift
[47:38] i gave her a space to repent of her
[47:41] fornication
[47:42] and she repented not i gave her a space
[47:45] to repent
[47:46] of her fornication and she repented not
[47:49] we ask the lord this evening to add the
[47:51] blessing to the reading of his word
[47:53] as you may have your seats there for
[47:56] just a few moments this evening
[47:58] by the help of the lord and from those
[47:59] scriptures if i could
[48:01] i want to speak to you here for a few
[48:02] moments on a thought if i would title it
[48:04] tonight
[48:05] maybe just title it this it's time to
[48:08] deal with it it's time
[48:10] to deal with it and i believe tonight
[48:12] that we've gathered here for the first
[48:13] night of these
[48:14] meetings this weekend and i believe
[48:16] we've come here that the lord might deal
[48:18] with our lives he might deal with
[48:20] our hearts he might speak to us and he
[48:21] might change us
[48:23] that we would not leave these meetings
[48:24] the way we came but we would leave
[48:26] different we would leave closer to him
[48:29] and i'll just maybe
[48:30] maybe share this with you is just a
[48:31] foundation here of where the lord
[48:34] began to deal with my heart on this
[48:35] thought and i'll just sit like this
[48:37] sometimes in traveling and preaching
[48:39] uh being in different prayer lines
[48:41] you'll stand there and you'll you'll
[48:42] have
[48:42] multiple people come up for prayer some
[48:45] will come up for healing some will come
[48:46] up for deliverances and it's uh
[48:48] actually one thing that's always amazed
[48:49] me is when you hear the different needs
[48:52] of people and you would you just begin
[48:53] to
[48:54] maybe process that process that through
[48:56] your mind and i was in a prayer line not
[48:58] long ago and a person came up and
[49:01] they were going through some things they
[49:02] were facing some battles and some things
[49:04] and some troubles
[49:05] and when they come up for prayer they
[49:07] actually just said i'm trying to find a
[49:08] way to live with it or i'm trying to
[49:10] find a way to deal with it and it began
[49:11] to dawn on me
[49:12] that we find many people today that
[49:15] they're trying to find ways to put up
[49:17] with things that they don't have to put
[49:18] up with they're trying to
[49:19] they're trying to find a way to live
[49:21] with something that really they don't
[49:22] have to live with
[49:23] or or find a way to deal with something
[49:25] that really they don't have to deal with
[49:27] now
[49:27] we realize as christians that we are in
[49:29] spiritual warfare now we know
[49:31] the spiritual warfare is actually
[49:34] between the powers of satan and the
[49:36] powers of god bible says hey we see
[49:38] how can overcome we see this age that
[49:40] we're living in
[49:41] it's one of the grandest of all ages
[49:43] this laodicean church age
[49:45] is the grandest of all ages
[49:48] he says because it's the ending of time
[49:52] and the blending of eternity he says and
[49:54] then
[49:54] it's the greatest sinful age it's more
[49:56] sin in this age
[49:58] than there's ever been he says and the
[50:00] powers of satan
[50:02] is many times harder to fight against
[50:04] than it was in any age now
[50:06] to think tonight that we're not living
[50:08] in an easy age we're not living in an
[50:10] age
[50:10] amen where everything's going to be just
[50:12] a happy age going to be easy to get
[50:14] through but we're living in a time
[50:16] where there's going to be struggles
[50:17] where there's going to be battles and
[50:19] the prophet is telling you here
[50:20] that the reason there's going to be
[50:21] these battles is because the powers of
[50:24] satan
[50:24] amen is many times harder to fight
[50:26] against in this age than any age before
[50:29] now
[50:29] i think of how that there is the powers
[50:31] of satan but lest not so much tonight
[50:33] amen focus on the powers of satan but
[50:35] let's look at the powers of christ i
[50:37] i believe just as the powers of satan
[50:39] are are joining their forces together
[50:42] and they're they're building their
[50:43] their their strengths together to try to
[50:45] stop the church and to try to stop the
[50:47] moving of god
[50:48] amen i believe that the power of christ
[50:50] has come down
[50:51] amen to liberate those who are captured
[50:54] amen and bound by the powers of satan to
[50:57] think tonight
[50:58] amen that if you're bound by the powers
[51:00] of satan you don't have to remain like
[51:01] that
[51:02] amen but there is a higher power there
[51:04] there is a more greater power that can
[51:06] come into your life tonight
[51:08] and can break the powers of the enemy
[51:10] then when we gather together
[51:11] amen in meetings like this we don't
[51:13] gather here to be seen amen
[51:15] we don't gather here to be heard we
[51:16] don't gather just a singer
[51:18] and then just to preach a sermon but we
[51:20] gather here amen that
[51:22] christ might come in the church amen and
[51:24] deal with our hearts and our lives
[51:26] according to the word
[51:27] now paul will say this way in hebrews 10
[51:29] 25 he will say not forsaking
[51:32] amen the assembling of ourselves
[51:34] together as the manner of some is
[51:37] amen but exhorting one another and so
[51:39] much more as you see
[51:41] the day approaching now now to think
[51:43] tonight that we're living in a time
[51:45] amen where the house of god has become
[51:47] the last thing on people's list right
[51:49] amen it's become well if i got time i'll
[51:51] go to church if i got time i'll pray
[51:53] amen but the bible says that there
[51:55] should be more earnest now
[51:57] amen for the house of god than there was
[51:59] when you first got saved
[52:01] they been defaint tonight church that
[52:03] this is the last days amen
[52:04] amen these are the final hours these are
[52:07] the closing moments of the history of
[52:08] the world
[52:09] and there is a bride here amen that is
[52:11] not going to be bound by the powers of
[52:14] satan
[52:14] amen but there's a hole in the rock
[52:16] tonight she can run into and the power
[52:18] of god can set her free
[52:21] my when i think of how the bible says
[52:23] not forsaken the assembling
[52:25] of ourselves together then i begin to
[52:26] think of how amen that we come to church
[52:28] now the prophet says as we study this my
[52:30] purpose of this how can overcome
[52:32] he said if this is not just a community
[52:34] fellowship with you people
[52:35] which i love to do that but if i had a
[52:37] chance to do that i would come to your
[52:39] home and shake your hand and talk with
[52:41] you and sit down
[52:42] and eat dinner with you and sit down
[52:43] under the shade tree and talk and
[52:45] fellowship a while
[52:46] he said but when we come here amen we
[52:48] are here for one specific purpose when
[52:50] we
[52:51] when we come here we are here for one
[52:53] specific purpose this
[52:54] is amen the house of correction this is
[52:57] the throne
[52:58] this is the throne of god and judgment
[53:01] goes forth from the house of god
[53:03] and here is where we come together in
[53:05] love with one another as
[53:07] only christians can love he said but in
[53:10] here we are
[53:11] under a leadership of the holy spirit
[53:13] and the holy ghost is among us so when
[53:16] we come here
[53:17] amen we are not here under man's
[53:19] leadership we are not here
[53:20] under a church's leadership but when we
[53:22] come in here amen we are here
[53:25] under the leadership of the holy ghost
[53:27] amen
[53:28] and this is a house of correction we're
[53:29] here amen to take a reckoning among us
[53:32] to see
[53:33] where our short places are our
[53:34] shortcomings and how can we catch
[53:37] from where we should be over to where we
[53:39] ought to be now
[53:40] where we are and where we ought to be he
[53:42] said that's what we study ministers
[53:44] study those places for the people
[53:46] when they see the people that lack then
[53:48] they begin on that
[53:50] amen now how many will agree that there
[53:52] is a past
[53:53] amen how many will agree there is a
[53:55] present amen then how many will agree
[53:57] there is a future there is a past
[53:59] there is a present and there is a future
[54:01] and a prophet of god is saying what
[54:03] we're here in the house of god for
[54:05] amen it's not soup suppers amen it's not
[54:08] handshakes but we're here
[54:09] amen to see if your pastor's behind you
[54:12] amen to see where you're standing
[54:14] and to see where the word says you can
[54:16] be amen and to preach a word
[54:19] amen that will take you by the hand and
[54:21] say now let's move on
[54:22] church amen let's go into higher heights
[54:25] amen amen let's go into deeper depths
[54:27] and i pray tonight
[54:28] amen that the same god amen that
[54:30] appeared before would appear here
[54:32] tonight
[54:33] and would take the church by the hand
[54:35] and say come on church
[54:36] let's go a little bit higher amen let's
[54:39] go another round higher
[54:40] and there is a place we can go where the
[54:43] powers of satan are broke over the
[54:45] church
[54:46] ah to think tonight amen i believe that
[54:49] god ordains
[54:50] and arranges these meetings i don't
[54:52] believe amen that a man just puts a
[54:54] couple dates together
[54:55] amen but i believe before the foundation
[54:57] of the world
[54:58] amen that god ordains and arranges each
[55:01] service not just in a special meeting
[55:03] amen not just on a saturday night but on
[55:05] a wednesday night
[55:07] amen on a sunday morning wherever the
[55:09] believers gather
[55:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ i
[55:12] believe amen that god has ordained
[55:15] amen god has arranged that amen that he
[55:18] might come in and deal
[55:19] with the needs of his believing children
[55:22] amen then you see what will happen when
[55:23] that happens
[55:24] is god will call a man on the pulpit
[55:27] amen see the prophet said now think of
[55:29] god
[55:29] in his mercy has the mother before the
[55:31] little baby is born
[55:32] it's craving for some vitamin and the
[55:34] mother's word speaks forth dad
[55:36] i want cantaloupe or watermelon i want
[55:39] something or another
[55:40] well he'll do everything he can amen to
[55:43] get that because he knows
[55:44] he wants his child born as perfect as it
[55:47] can be
[55:48] see and he'll do everything he can
[55:49] because he's able to do it to get it
[55:52] now the prophet there is speaking of a
[55:54] natural father who is desiring the birth
[55:56] of his natural child
[55:58] amen to be born as perfect as he can be
[56:00] then turns it and says
[56:02] now how much more able are speaking of
[56:03] god is he
[56:05] amen to get it for he's a creator amen
[56:08] see now think about that a woman
[56:10] carrying a child
[56:11] amen can wake up in the middle of the
[56:12] night and say honey i want some
[56:14] cantaloupe
[56:14] i want some watermelon hey man you know
[56:16] what he's got to do he's got to get up
[56:18] and he's either got to go to the
[56:19] refrigerator and find it
[56:20] he better go to the store and buy it he
[56:22] meant but a creator can say let there be
[56:24] cantaloupe
[56:25] amen or let there be watermelon see what
[56:26] he's showing you here is there is a
[56:28] difference between a natural father
[56:30] amen and your heavenly father and the
[56:32] faint tonight church
[56:33] that we have not gathered here amen
[56:35] under the jurisdiction of the natural
[56:37] father
[56:38] amen but we have gathered here under the
[56:40] leadership of our heavenly father
[56:42] and whatever you have need of tonight
[56:44] it's not beyond the power of creation
[56:46] amen i'll tell you what if you need
[56:48] something tonight from god
[56:49] and there's no way you can see it let me
[56:51] remind you he is still jehovah's ira
[56:54] amen let me remind you he can still
[56:56] speak things into existence
[56:58] whatever you have need of amen let's
[57:00] just go and knock that devil in the face
[57:02] here for a minute amen you say well i
[57:04] need something from god there's no way i
[57:06] can get it
[57:06] let me remind you who your father is he
[57:09] is a creator
[57:13] then how much more abler is he amen he's
[57:15] a creator now think
[57:16] now think here how able he is to prepare
[57:19] us a body to have to live like his own
[57:21] glorious body
[57:22] if we want to live see then there is
[57:24] something in us that calls to live
[57:26] and there is something in us that calls
[57:28] to do right then god will call somebody
[57:31] on the platform or in the pulpit that
[57:34] will preach the absolute truth
[57:36] why see it shows you then if you're a
[57:39] real child of god
[57:40] then you begin to cry out god take it
[57:43] away from me
[57:44] and circumcise me from this take these
[57:46] things away from me why
[57:48] it's needed for your heavenly home that
[57:50] you're going to
[57:52] where he's prepared amen see you've got
[57:54] to be a real
[57:55] word bride of christ amen then to think
[57:58] tonight
[57:59] amen that a real child amen does not
[58:02] resist chastisement
[58:03] amen but a real child actually accepts
[58:05] it paul says in hebrews 11
[58:08] now no chastening for the present
[58:10] seemeth to be joyous
[58:11] amen but grievous amen but nevertheless
[58:14] afterward
[58:15] it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[58:17] righteousness unto them which are
[58:19] exercised thereby
[58:20] in the of sin church age remember says
[58:22] here and now set forth
[58:24] amen the love of god he desired in love
[58:26] a family of his own
[58:28] amen a family of sons like himself there
[58:31] before him lies all mankind has one lump
[58:33] of clay
[58:34] out of that same lump he will now make
[58:36] vessels under honor and unto dishonor
[58:39] see the choosing will be his own
[58:40] choosing then
[58:42] then the chosen ones have been born of
[58:44] his spirits
[58:45] will be trained to conform to his image
[58:48] in their walk
[58:50] now think about this the heavenly father
[58:52] amen is actually going to choose you're
[58:54] not going to choose him
[58:56] amen but he's going to choose you amen
[58:58] and when he chooses you
[59:00] amen then because you're the chosen one
[59:02] what he's going to do
[59:03] is he's going to transform you amen into
[59:06] the image of their walk
[59:07] he says he reproves with all
[59:09] long-suffering and gentleness and mercy
[59:12] he chastens amen with nail scarred hands
[59:15] now now no chastisement
[59:17] amen seems amen no chastisement amen
[59:20] seems joyous for the president
[59:22] amen but nevertheless afterward it
[59:23] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[59:24] righteousness see
[59:25] amen he's going to chasten you amen with
[59:28] nail scarred hands and sometimes this
[59:30] potter
[59:30] must take the vessel he's working on and
[59:33] thoroughly break it down in order that
[59:35] he may rebuild it
[59:36] exactly as he desires it see but it is
[59:39] love
[59:40] that is his love another way of his love
[59:42] thereby is not
[59:43] there cannot be amen now let me say it
[59:46] this way i believe
[59:47] amen that if you're the chosen of god
[59:49] amen and there's something about you in
[59:51] your life amen that god does not desire
[59:53] to be
[59:54] i believe that god being the potter
[59:56] himself amen will take us and will break
[59:58] us down
[59:59] amen until he breaks that thing out of
[1:00:01] us amen because there's nothing going to
[1:00:03] be in this bride
[1:00:05] amen accept the word amen there's not
[1:00:07] going to be feelings there's not going
[1:00:08] to be sin
[1:00:09] there's not going to be unbelief there's
[1:00:11] not going to be fears there's not going
[1:00:13] to be skepticism there's not going to be
[1:00:15] complexes
[1:00:16] this bride is going to be a word
[1:00:19] born bride she's going to be a word born
[1:00:23] bride
[1:00:24] now i believe with all my heart then
[1:00:26] that god amen right here tonight
[1:00:28] how many will agree with me is desiring
[1:00:30] to deal with hearts
[1:00:31] amen i believe god is desiring to deal
[1:00:34] with hearts
[1:00:34] i believe god is desiring to deal with
[1:00:36] lies you say well brother andrew there's
[1:00:38] nothing going to happen here with me
[1:00:40] amen there's no way god can deal with me
[1:00:42] the prophet said your faith don't have
[1:00:43] no hindrances
[1:00:46] i don't care where it's had what it is
[1:00:48] no matter who says not
[1:00:49] if god begins to deal with the human
[1:00:52] heart
[1:00:52] begins to pulsate in there that it's the
[1:00:54] truth and you find it to be the truth
[1:00:57] there's nothing going to keep you from
[1:00:59] jesus christ
[1:01:02] when god begins to deal with a human
[1:01:05] heart
[1:01:05] amen if they're a chosen one if they're
[1:01:08] a real
[1:01:08] child of god there's nothing going to
[1:01:11] hinder
[1:01:12] amen god from dealing with your heart
[1:01:15] amen now let me say this just as we
[1:01:17] believe that god
[1:01:18] amen desires to deal with our lives amen
[1:01:20] i also believe
[1:01:22] that god is desiring us amen to deal
[1:01:25] with things in our lives that don't
[1:01:26] belong there
[1:01:27] well brother andrew i've been in the
[1:01:29] message for 20 years i've been in the
[1:01:30] message for 30 years
[1:01:31] i don't care if you've been in the
[1:01:32] message five years amen every now and
[1:01:35] again we get some things in our lives
[1:01:37] that just simply don't belong there amen
[1:01:40] that don't mean you're backslidden
[1:01:42] it don't mean you're not revelated it
[1:01:44] don't mean you're not the pride
[1:01:45] amen it's just the age we're living in
[1:01:47] amen where things creep in
[1:01:49] amen we're habits come in amen where
[1:01:52] little things come in and they come in
[1:01:53] so
[1:01:54] innocent amen they come in so unnoticed
[1:01:56] amen but before long they're controlling
[1:01:58] you
[1:01:59] amen before long they're driving you
[1:02:01] amen before long your joy is gone
[1:02:04] amen before long your victory is gone
[1:02:06] but how about tonight
[1:02:07] amen we say the same holy ghost that
[1:02:09] filled the upper room
[1:02:11] amen would come in this building tonight
[1:02:13] and we'll light a stick of dynamite
[1:02:15] and would blow everything out of our
[1:02:16] hearts would blow everything out of our
[1:02:18] lives that don't belong
[1:02:20] there ain't been that the living god he
[1:02:22] might come and take possession of the
[1:02:24] church
[1:02:26] hey i believe god is desiring a clean
[1:02:29] bride amen
[1:02:29] i believe god desires a clean church
[1:02:31] amen let me say this if god desires
[1:02:34] it he's going to have it if god wants it
[1:02:36] he's going to get it
[1:02:37] amen if god said it's going to be there
[1:02:39] you can put everything you've got on it
[1:02:41] it's going to be there and then now when
[1:02:44] you say this term
[1:02:45] amen to deal with it how many how many
[1:02:47] believes god wants us to deal with some
[1:02:49] things
[1:02:49] amen if it's okay i'm just going to
[1:02:51] preach a little bit tonight and then to
[1:02:53] deal with it means to take measures
[1:02:55] amen concerning someone amen or
[1:02:57] something
[1:02:58] it means especially with the intention
[1:03:00] of making something right
[1:03:02] it means to confront an issue and to
[1:03:05] reach a resolve
[1:03:06] amen it means to quit playing with it it
[1:03:09] means to quit just just talking about it
[1:03:11] it means to get down to business and
[1:03:14] confront it
[1:03:16] it means to look it in the face amen and
[1:03:19] deal with it
[1:03:20] amen now that's what it means it means
[1:03:22] to bring an issue amen not to leave
[1:03:24] loose hands
[1:03:25] amen but to tie those loose ends
[1:03:27] together listen friends this message
[1:03:29] is not a message of loose sins it's not
[1:03:31] a message of this and that he meant a
[1:03:33] prophet come and found all the loose
[1:03:35] sins
[1:03:36] and he tied them together amen that a
[1:03:38] church would rise in the power
[1:03:40] of the resurrection of jesus christ and
[1:03:42] i think if the word don't have loose
[1:03:44] ends then let me say this word-born
[1:03:45] bride she ain't going to have loose ends
[1:03:48] either
[1:03:48] amen she's going to be tied together by
[1:03:51] the word
[1:03:52] and then to deal with something means to
[1:03:53] reach a resolve now in the year of 2010
[1:03:56] amen a popular term was formed just deal
[1:03:59] with it that was that was the that was
[1:04:01] the term of the year 2010
[1:04:03] was just deal with it amen now when they
[1:04:05] when they formed that popular term
[1:04:07] what they actually done was they totally
[1:04:09] changed amend the people's view
[1:04:12] of how to deal with something
[1:04:15] before when you said deal with it you
[1:04:17] had the intention of confronting
[1:04:19] something
[1:04:20] amen and getting it out in the open and
[1:04:21] then coming to a resolve
[1:04:23] amen but when they changed that the
[1:04:25] phrase deal with it
[1:04:26] is a bold self-assured declaration
[1:04:29] ordering someone
[1:04:31] to put up with something that they may
[1:04:33] object to
[1:04:34] or make to do with a challenging but
[1:04:36] ultimately manageable situation
[1:04:38] so instead of handling or facing or
[1:04:41] working out a situation
[1:04:42] people just say deal with it amen see
[1:04:45] which actually what they're saying
[1:04:47] is just put up with it amen what they're
[1:04:49] saying is don't take the gloves off and
[1:04:50] deal with it
[1:04:51] amen just let it be there it's a
[1:04:53] manageable situation
[1:04:55] amen i'm going to preach here for a
[1:04:56] minute amen because the world we live in
[1:04:58] says you just have to learn to deal with
[1:05:00] it
[1:05:00] you just have to learn how to put up
[1:05:02] with it amen and i'll say the reason why
[1:05:04] the world says that
[1:05:05] is because they've lost their backbone
[1:05:07] they've been they've lost
[1:05:08] they've lost the guts to stand against
[1:05:10] sin they've lost their guts to call
[1:05:12] black black
[1:05:12] and white white everything's a gray area
[1:05:15] amen but i believe in these last days
[1:05:17] there's going to be a pride that's going
[1:05:19] to rise up under the anointing of the
[1:05:21] word of the hour
[1:05:22] and she's going to put every devil amen
[1:05:24] under her feet
[1:05:27] oh now that's what the world says amen
[1:05:30] the world says
[1:05:31] just deal with it the world says just
[1:05:32] find a way to live with it amen let me
[1:05:34] set you like this
[1:05:35] amen then that same spirit has come in
[1:05:37] the church
[1:05:38] amen you say what are you talking about
[1:05:40] the prophet said this way he said and
[1:05:42] the world has come
[1:05:43] into the church in the name of
[1:05:45] denomination
[1:05:46] he said the name of some creed and we're
[1:05:48] religious and all this
[1:05:50] and all this but yet it denies the
[1:05:52] resurrecting power of christ
[1:05:54] he meant to vindicate his word that is
[1:05:56] prophesied for this day
[1:05:58] amen see there can only be a light
[1:05:59] through god through the word of god
[1:06:01] we know that god in the beginning said
[1:06:04] amen let there be light and there was
[1:06:05] light
[1:06:06] vindication of his word that he had
[1:06:08] spoken
[1:06:10] now to think about this of how that the
[1:06:12] world had that term
[1:06:14] amen just deal with it and they totally
[1:06:16] changed it
[1:06:17] to say just learn how to manage it just
[1:06:19] just find a way
[1:06:20] ain't meant to put up with it just just
[1:06:22] find a way that you can live with
[1:06:24] something
[1:06:24] amen now that that same devil comes over
[1:06:26] in the religious world
[1:06:28] amen and i'm going to preach here for a
[1:06:29] second the religious world is saying the
[1:06:31] same
[1:06:32] thing amen what they've done is they've
[1:06:33] dismissed divine healing
[1:06:35] amen so they teach that you need to
[1:06:37] learn to put up with sickness
[1:06:39] learn how to manage it learn how to deal
[1:06:41] with it amen the religious world has
[1:06:43] dismissed the power of god's deliverance
[1:06:45] amen so now they teach you there's no
[1:06:47] way to overcome that devil
[1:06:48] there's no way to rise above it you've
[1:06:50] just got to live with it you've got to
[1:06:52] learn to put up with those habits
[1:06:53] you've got to learn to deal with those
[1:06:55] besetting sins you've got to learn to
[1:06:57] manage those strongholds
[1:06:58] amen see what they've done the bible
[1:07:00] says they have denied the power thereof
[1:07:02] amen they've denied the power of god let
[1:07:04] me say if this message
[1:07:06] don't have the power to produce an
[1:07:07] overcoming life let's go find something
[1:07:10] that does
[1:07:10] amen if this message don't have the
[1:07:12] power to take a man
[1:07:14] and lift him above pornography and lift
[1:07:16] him above homosexuality
[1:07:18] if this message don't have the power and
[1:07:20] then to take a girl
[1:07:22] and lift her above hollywood fashion
[1:07:24] then let's go find something that does
[1:07:26] but may i announce to you here tonight
[1:07:28] there is nothing
[1:07:29] under the sun with more power than the
[1:07:31] message of the hour
[1:07:32] there is nothing with more power to
[1:07:35] overcome the devil
[1:07:36] than this message
[1:07:39] this message is the power of god to
[1:07:42] overcome the devil
[1:07:45] the prophet said then can you imagine a
[1:07:47] person amen having the holy ghost and
[1:07:49] denying part of god's word
[1:07:50] taken half of it say the other half is
[1:07:52] no good see so i believe a man
[1:07:54] ought to live a pretty good life but
[1:07:56] when we come to a time of thinking about
[1:07:58] divine healing
[1:07:59] and all this stuff like that and
[1:08:00] abstaining oh we have to do this and
[1:08:02] that don't believe in it
[1:08:03] the bible said that would come to pass
[1:08:05] having
[1:08:06] a form of godliness but deny
[1:08:09] the power thereof see the prophet said
[1:08:12] they deny
[1:08:13] half of his word and all of this power
[1:08:15] that's right
[1:08:16] yes certain they presume they got it
[1:08:18] amen now we've come here tonight
[1:08:19] that we might see your great power
[1:08:21] deliverance lord how it delivers the
[1:08:23] captive
[1:08:24] and sets them free and makes known to us
[1:08:27] the things it was
[1:08:28] which is and shall come see that's why
[1:08:31] every service
[1:08:32] you should be under expectation that the
[1:08:35] god that was
[1:08:36] is the god that he is is the god that
[1:08:38] will be and that god will come down in
[1:08:41] the church
[1:08:41] and he will manifest himself through the
[1:08:44] great power of deliverance
[1:08:46] now let me just preach here for a second
[1:08:48] amen because you've got to agree
[1:08:49] or you may not agree but it's the truth
[1:08:51] anyhow the world has replaced the power
[1:08:53] of the gospel with psychology
[1:08:56] paul says in second corinthians 4 4 in
[1:08:59] whom the god of this world
[1:09:00] hath blinded the minds of them which
[1:09:02] believed knowledge lest the light of the
[1:09:04] glorious gospel of christ
[1:09:06] who is the image of god should shine
[1:09:09] unto them
[1:09:09] now when you look at that word blinded
[1:09:11] it means to blunt
[1:09:12] the mental discernment it means to
[1:09:15] darken the mind
[1:09:16] now what that's saying is there's going
[1:09:17] to come a time where that where they're
[1:09:19] not going to be able to discern
[1:09:21] between what is right and what is wrong
[1:09:23] they're not going to be able to discern
[1:09:25] between what is truth and what is there
[1:09:27] amen so everything's going to be right
[1:09:29] amen nothing's going to be wrong amen
[1:09:31] every man's opinion is going to be right
[1:09:33] no man's going to be wrong amen but do
[1:09:35] you see where that comes from
[1:09:37] that came from the devil amen who has
[1:09:39] taken the glorious light of the gospel
[1:09:41] and is blind in the minds of some amen i
[1:09:44] don't know about you tonight church
[1:09:45] but i'm not blinded amen i'm not blind
[1:09:48] tonight god sent a message in this hour
[1:09:50] amen with some eyes have amen called the
[1:09:53] baptism
[1:09:53] of the holy ghost and the prophet said
[1:09:55] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:57] you can never have your eyes open
[1:09:59] to a true spiritual revelation of the
[1:10:02] word
[1:10:03] a man without the spirit is blind to god
[1:10:06] and his truth if you ain't got the holy
[1:10:09] ghost
[1:10:10] you're as blind as the man smoking a
[1:10:12] cigarette if you ain't got the holy
[1:10:14] ghost you're as blind as a local baptist
[1:10:16] preacher but if you've got the holy
[1:10:17] ghost tonight
[1:10:18] amen you've got eyes to sing you've got
[1:10:21] ears to hear
[1:10:22] you've got a heart to believe you've got
[1:10:24] a faith to reach out
[1:10:26] and say yes lord i believe
[1:10:30] oh the god of this evil age does not
[1:10:32] want our spiritual eyes to come open
[1:10:34] amen he don't want our eyes to come open
[1:10:36] to the reality that god is still a
[1:10:38] deliverer
[1:10:41] are you with me tonight he doesn't want
[1:10:43] our eyes to come open to the reality
[1:10:45] that god actually still delivers
[1:10:48] hey and i preach for a minute god
[1:10:51] actually still delivers
[1:10:52] that right there is enough to make you
[1:10:54] shout your shoe heels off
[1:10:55] amen god still delivers in an age
[1:10:59] when minds are bound in an age where
[1:11:01] strongholds
[1:11:02] have possessed the lives of young people
[1:11:04] in a time
[1:11:05] amen when the world is in such confusion
[1:11:08] when politics are falling apart
[1:11:10] when young boys don't know if they're
[1:11:11] boys and girls don't know if they're
[1:11:13] girls
[1:11:14] there is a power amen called the holy
[1:11:16] ghost
[1:11:17] that can set a man free it can set a
[1:11:19] young girl free
[1:11:20] and they can see who they are
[1:11:24] my god amen open our eyes tonight lord
[1:11:28] to the reality of your deliverance
[1:11:30] that's why paul would say in ephesians 1
[1:11:32] 18 that the eyes of your understanding
[1:11:35] being enlightened
[1:11:36] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:11:37] this calling what is the riches of his
[1:11:39] glory
[1:11:40] of his inheritance in the saints and
[1:11:42] what is the exceeding greatness
[1:11:44] of his power towards us who believe
[1:11:46] according to the working
[1:11:48] of his mighty power now the prophet says
[1:11:51] i was a little boy in kentucky
[1:11:53] my brother and i slept in an attic on a
[1:11:54] strong palate the cracks of the house
[1:11:56] would let the would let the giraffes
[1:11:58] blow through
[1:12:00] he said sometimes in the winter it would
[1:12:02] get so cold
[1:12:03] we would wake up in the morning with
[1:12:04] such colds in our eyes that our eyes
[1:12:06] would be shut tight with inflammation
[1:12:08] we would cry out to mother and she would
[1:12:10] come up there with some hot grease
[1:12:12] and rub our eyes so the hardened matter
[1:12:14] was gone and then we could see
[1:12:16] he said and you know there have been
[1:12:17] some awful cold drafts blowing on the
[1:12:20] church in this generation and i'm afraid
[1:12:22] her eyes
[1:12:23] have sort of frozen shut and she is
[1:12:25] blind
[1:12:26] to what god has for her see the devil
[1:12:29] don't care
[1:12:30] if you see what god's got for your
[1:12:32] pastor or the wand the devil don't care
[1:12:34] if you see what god's got for the
[1:12:35] evangelist or what god's got for
[1:12:37] brethren or what god's got for your mom
[1:12:39] or your daddy
[1:12:40] amen but he don't want you to see amen
[1:12:42] that the same god
[1:12:43] that's got something for them is the
[1:12:46] same god that's got something for you
[1:12:51] see that's that's the reality she needs
[1:12:53] some hot oil he says with the spirit of
[1:12:55] god
[1:12:55] amen to open her eyes unless she
[1:12:57] receives the spirit of god
[1:12:59] she will go on substituting program for
[1:13:01] power and creed for word
[1:13:03] she counts numbers for success rather
[1:13:05] than to look for fruit the doctors of
[1:13:07] theology
[1:13:07] have shut the door of faith and forbade
[1:13:09] all to enter they neither go in
[1:13:11] themselves nor let anyone else go in
[1:13:13] their theology comes out of a textbook
[1:13:15] on psychology
[1:13:16] written by some unbeliever there is a
[1:13:18] textbook on psychology
[1:13:19] one we all need it is the bible it is
[1:13:22] written by god
[1:13:23] and contains god's psychology you don't
[1:13:26] need any doctor to explain it to you
[1:13:28] receive you the holy spirit and led him
[1:13:31] to the explaining
[1:13:32] he wrote the book and he can tell you
[1:13:34] what is in it and what it means
[1:13:36] see then you find tonight we are living
[1:13:38] in a time of contrast
[1:13:40] right now we are living in a time of
[1:13:43] contrast
[1:13:43] you say what is a contrast a contrast is
[1:13:46] two opposites
[1:13:47] amen like this amen if there's a cold
[1:13:49] weather somewhere there's a hot weather
[1:13:50] somewhere else
[1:13:51] amen if there's a if there's a strong
[1:13:54] person
[1:13:54] then there's a weak person see what i'm
[1:13:56] saying there's a contrast amen and right
[1:13:58] here here's the contrast
[1:14:00] we are living in a time where the bible
[1:14:02] says it's a time of weakness
[1:14:04] but at the same time the same bible says
[1:14:06] it's a time of strength
[1:14:08] amen so there's one week amen and
[1:14:10] there's another strong
[1:14:13] there's one that's weak but there's
[1:14:15] another one that's strong
[1:14:16] living in the same world amen living in
[1:14:19] the same state
[1:14:20] amen come on church amen the bible says
[1:14:22] in isaiah 37
[1:14:23] 3 amen thus saith hezekiah this is a day
[1:14:26] of trouble
[1:14:27] and a rebuke and a blasphemy for the
[1:14:30] children are come to the birth
[1:14:31] and there is not strength to bring forth
[1:14:34] the children are come to the birth but
[1:14:37] there's no strength to bring forth
[1:14:38] you realize what that word strength
[1:14:40] means it means power
[1:14:42] it means might it means the power of god
[1:14:44] the prophet said when the church
[1:14:46] allowed herself amen to move away from
[1:14:49] the original
[1:14:50] like adam and eve death city and there
[1:14:52] is
[1:14:53] no strength in her when she left the
[1:14:55] original word
[1:14:57] and death come in and she lost her
[1:14:59] strength amen are you with me tonight
[1:15:01] when she left the original
[1:15:03] amen death come in amen so what's going
[1:15:05] to take death out
[1:15:06] is when she comes back to the original
[1:15:10] when she comes back to the original then
[1:15:12] see where we are tonight
[1:15:14] we are back to the original tree amen
[1:15:16] we've got the original word
[1:15:18] we've got the original spirit we've got
[1:15:20] the original life
[1:15:21] we've got the original god we've got the
[1:15:24] original holy ghost
[1:15:25] we've got the original seed oh come on
[1:15:28] church
[1:15:28] amen if we come back to the original
[1:15:31] then
[1:15:31] death is gone and life has come in
[1:15:36] oh weak pulpits though has taken the
[1:15:38] church from the original
[1:15:40] amen let me just preach it for a second
[1:15:41] the proud of god said weak pulpits
[1:15:43] produces weak churches
[1:15:45] see remember said she was standing there
[1:15:46] talking about a little girl she was
[1:15:48] standing up there poor little thing not
[1:15:49] old about 18 years old
[1:15:50] he said what's the trouble today we've
[1:15:52] got too many weak pulpits that's afraid
[1:15:54] to preach
[1:15:55] amen and to warn the people of things
[1:15:56] that's letting the church go just as
[1:15:58] softly
[1:15:59] and sloppy as it can be what's the
[1:16:01] matter it's because they've loved the
[1:16:02] things of the world
[1:16:04] more than they love the things of god
[1:16:06] and they gotta pervert it see not only
[1:16:07] that
[1:16:08] but our churches is crushed little old
[1:16:10] pulpit 65 preachers that stand up
[1:16:12] i ain't criticizing those certain ones
[1:16:14] he said but they stand up and it's a
[1:16:16] meal ticket
[1:16:17] it's an offering it's a popular name to
[1:16:19] get on television or on the air
[1:16:20] i wouldn't sell my birth right to jesus
[1:16:22] christ for all the televisions
[1:16:24] and popularity there is in the world no
[1:16:26] sir life means more
[1:16:27] than these nasty ungodly things i'd
[1:16:30] rather have favor with christ
[1:16:32] than to be the president of the world
[1:16:33] what a condition
[1:16:35] the world's got into amen now come on
[1:16:37] church we know the condition of the
[1:16:39] world
[1:16:39] we know tonight amen that men are
[1:16:41] marrying men we know tonight that women
[1:16:43] are marrying women
[1:16:44] we know tonight amen that that there's
[1:16:47] hate and there's division
[1:16:48] and there's there's all kinds of
[1:16:50] nonsense well we know that amen we're
[1:16:52] not going to change it but the devil's
[1:16:54] not going to leave it out there
[1:16:55] he wants to bring the same thing in the
[1:16:57] church
[1:17:00] you say number there you don't know what
[1:17:02] you're talking about oh yes i do
[1:17:03] he wants to bring the same spirits in
[1:17:05] the church well brother andrew don't you

[1:20:16] amen now you say what are you talking
[1:20:17] about demons
[1:20:18] are enticing and tormenting spirits the
[1:20:20] problem of god said i want to speak on
[1:20:22] enticing spirits
[1:20:23] which has would really be titled
[1:20:24] demonology
[1:20:26] he said you hear so much about demons of
[1:20:28] these days but you hear so little about
[1:20:31] how to get rid of it
[1:20:33] you hear so much about demons demons are
[1:20:35] real amen by how you get rid of them
[1:20:37] well we'll see where we're at they say
[1:20:38] you can't get rid of them you got to
[1:20:40] live with them
[1:20:41] you can't overcome them you've got to
[1:20:43] live with them so what we're doing is
[1:20:44] we're making deals with the devil
[1:20:48] well we're all aware that there's devils
[1:20:50] he says
[1:20:51] but the next thing is how to get rid of
[1:20:54] that thing
[1:20:55] let me take a minute here and say
[1:20:56] there's still a possibility
[1:20:59] of getting rid of it whatever demon is
[1:21:02] tormenting you
[1:21:03] there's still a possibility of getting
[1:21:06] rid of it
[1:21:07] whatever devil is controlling your mind
[1:21:10] or still a possibility
[1:21:12] amen to destroy that pain whatever
[1:21:14] spirit is trying to destroy your home
[1:21:17] there is still a possibility of
[1:21:19] defeating that faith
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:23] oh yes sir you say how can you be so
[1:21:26] bold and say that
[1:21:27] because we are not ignorant of satan's
[1:21:28] devices paul said lest satan
[1:21:31] should get an advantage of us for we are
[1:21:33] not ignorant of his devices
[1:21:35] and the message i can overcome he says
[1:21:38] overcome means
[1:21:39] to recognize the devil in every one of
[1:21:42] his tricks
[1:21:45] that's the first step to overcoming the
[1:21:47] devil
[1:21:48] is recognizing the devil and every one
[1:21:50] of his tricks
[1:21:51] a lot of people says there is no devil
[1:21:53] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:21:55] that there's a real devil
[1:21:57] amen he's just as real as you are
[1:22:00] anybody a real devil and you must

[1:22:05] can i preach to you
[1:22:06] here's how we're going to get rid of him
[1:22:08] then the same time
[1:22:10] you recognize him and know that he's a
[1:22:12] devil
[1:22:13] and he's against you then to overcome
[1:22:16] you must recognize
[1:22:17] that the god in you is greater
[1:22:22] is greater and mightier than he is
[1:22:25] that's the one in you has already
[1:22:28] overcome him are y'all hearing me

[1:22:45] overcome him
[1:22:46] what are you saying i'm saying the only
[1:22:48] thing the holy ghost is doing now

[1:24:07] how that the lord comes and speaks to
[1:24:08] moses in numbers 33 he comes to moses
[1:24:11] and speaks to him concerning israel
[1:24:14] passing over into pain
[1:24:15] land and he says now what was canaan
[1:24:17] cainlan was the promised land
[1:24:19] in the message adoption he says now
[1:24:20] canaan does not represent the age of the
[1:24:22] millennium
[1:24:24] it only represents the age of the
[1:24:26] overcomer
[1:24:28] it's the dispensation of overcoming
[1:24:30] because in canaan
[1:24:32] they killed in canaan they burned
[1:24:36] and took cities and there'll be no death
[1:24:38] in the millennium
[1:24:39] now brethren says and god talk to moses

[1:25:03] said he said how many let me say this
[1:25:05] how many needs the baptism of the holy
[1:25:06] ghost
[1:25:06] tonight when you say you're going to
[1:25:08] accept it he said that's when the devil
[1:25:11] flies on you
[1:25:12] with all four feet when you rise up
[1:25:16] and say i'm gonna accept it when you
[1:25:18] rise up and say i'm gonna take it
[1:25:20] when you rise up and say it's mine
[1:25:23] that's whenever
[1:25:24] devil raises up to try to stop you oh
[1:25:27] but church remember he couldn't stop
[1:25:29] moses
[1:25:30] and he couldn't stop david and he
[1:25:32] couldn't stop joshua and he couldn't
[1:25:34] stop rehab
[1:25:35] and he's not going to stop the bride of
[1:25:37] jesus christ
[1:25:38] she's going to take even possession of
[1:25:41] what god has given her
[1:25:42] in her inheritance yes sir

[1:25:52] numbers 33 52 again
[1:25:54] i don't know if you can put it up here
[1:25:55] or not but in numbers 33 52
[1:25:58] god speaks to moses and moses tells
[1:26:01] israel
[1:26:01] what god told him to tell them to do
[1:26:04] when you get over the land of canaan
[1:26:05] notice here verse 52
[1:26:07] then ye shall drive
[1:26:11] out all the inhabitants of the land from
[1:26:13] before you notice this word drive
[1:26:16] it means to cease it means to dispossess
[1:26:19] it means to take possession of it means
[1:26:22] to inherit
[1:26:23] it means to disinherit it means to
[1:26:25] occupy
[1:26:26] it means to impoverish to be an heir
[1:26:28] come to poverty
[1:26:29] be poor to devour to destroy bring to
[1:26:32] ruin
[1:26:33] disinherit so moses is saying through
[1:26:35] the lord then ye shall
[1:26:36] dispossess ye shall cease ye shall ye
[1:26:40] shall bring to run
[1:26:41] you shall destroy all the inhabitants of
[1:26:44] the land from before you
[1:26:46] and you shall destroy their pictures
[1:26:50] now look at what this word pictures
[1:26:51] means the word picture means show peace
[1:26:54] figure imagination image a car figure of
[1:26:57] idols can see
[1:26:58] amen a lot of us have got pictures that
[1:26:59] we need to destroy
[1:27:01] the devil has painted pictures of you
[1:27:03] that you need to destroy
[1:27:04] he's painted pictures of your future you
[1:27:06] need to destroy them things
[1:27:08] he's painted pictures of your family you
[1:27:10] need to destroy them things
[1:27:12] he's painted pictures of your church you
[1:27:14] need to destroy that thing can i preach
[1:27:16] amen destroy all their pictures
[1:27:21] can i go on and destroy all their molten
[1:27:24] images
[1:27:25] which that word molten means to pour in
[1:27:26] a libation of molten metal cast image
[1:27:29] drink offering metal molten gods it
[1:27:31] means a web
[1:27:35] direct quote or direct definition it
[1:27:37] means a web
[1:27:38] a covering a veil woven stuff you've got
[1:27:41] to destroy
[1:27:42] all the things that the web
[1:27:45] can i preach the way up the devil has
[1:27:47] created
[1:27:48] a meant to entangle you in you've got to
[1:27:50] destroy that thing
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:54] come on church amen have we lost our
[1:27:56] ability to destroy the devil
[1:27:58] i say no sir we are more able tonight
[1:28:01] than we were two years ago we are well
[1:28:04] able tonight
[1:28:05] to destroy our enemies
[1:28:08] destroy their molten images and then he
[1:28:10] says quiet pluck
[1:28:11] down all their high places you know what
[1:28:14] that word pluck means
[1:28:15] exterminate be destroyed be exterminated
[1:28:20] to be annihilated to be devastated
[1:28:24] i'm trying to behave here tonight but
[1:28:26] are y'all hearing me god's telling them
[1:28:29] go in there and destroy your enemy
[1:28:32] it's your land go in there and kick out
[1:28:34] the images
[1:28:35] tear down the pictures destroy the
[1:28:38] molten images
[1:28:38] and pluck down the high places see god
[1:28:41] gave them the land
[1:28:43] but he instructs him to dispossess the
[1:28:46] land
[1:28:46] see notice here we have to dispossess
[1:28:50] in order to possess we've got to
[1:28:53] dispossess
[1:28:54] in order to possess when we get in the
[1:28:56] millennium there'll be no dispossessing
[1:28:58] there'll be no killing there'll be no
[1:29:00] burning there'll be no taking down
[1:29:02] cities
[1:29:03] that's why canaan was not a type of the
[1:29:05] millennium
[1:29:06] it was a type of the baptism of the holy
[1:29:09] ghost when you get the holy ghost is
[1:29:11] when the battle begins
[1:29:14] god is telling israel there's something
[1:29:16] you're going to have to deal with
[1:29:17] you're going to have to face them in it
[1:29:19] it's amazing brother juan
[1:29:21] god gives him the land he gives him a
[1:29:23] prophet
[1:29:24] to lead him to the land he tells them
[1:29:26] where the land is
[1:29:27] he puts the milk in the land he puts the
[1:29:30] honey in the land
[1:29:31] and he says now you go in there and
[1:29:32] destroy the enemy that will stop you
[1:29:33] from enjoying the land
[1:29:38] how can i preach to you for a minute
[1:29:40] amen because these were not church
[1:29:42] members
[1:29:43] these were prophets these were present
[1:29:44] day prophet followers
[1:29:46] they were following the vindicated
[1:29:48] prophet of the age they went out of
[1:29:50] egypt
[1:29:50] into the promised land can you imagine
[1:29:52] when moses comes
[1:29:53] and delivers numbers 33 messes to him
[1:29:56] and says destroy
[1:29:57] destroy this do you imagine when he gets
[1:29:58] done you imagine the devil got in there
[1:30:01] among them you imagine that devil got in
[1:30:04] and said now i just i'll just paraphrase
[1:30:05] here for a second maybe dramatize it
[1:30:07] you imagine one more devil was raised up
[1:30:09] no doubt israel heard moses
[1:30:11] and maybe one of them thought don't you
[1:30:12] think that's a little extreme
[1:30:16] you imagine brother one when moses got
[1:30:17] done preaching and he said destroy their
[1:30:19] images
[1:30:20] hey it quite plucked down their high
[1:30:22] places ain't imagine what moses got done
[1:30:24] maybe that old devil said don't you
[1:30:26] think that's a little extreme moses
[1:30:28] ain't not going a little bit too far or
[1:30:29] maybe maybe maybe just possibly
[1:30:32] oh eve's interpreter come around maybe
[1:30:35] eve's interpreter come around
[1:30:36] and begin to try to interpret moses's
[1:30:38] message to them
[1:30:39] maybe they went back to their tents and
[1:30:41] they were thinking about moses saying
[1:30:43] when we get in the land
[1:30:44] we gotta fight we gotta draw our shorts
[1:30:46] we got
[1:30:47] we got to have some bloodshed here we we
[1:30:49] got we got to tear these things down
[1:30:51] you imagine they got back their tents
[1:30:53] and here come on eve's interpreter
[1:30:54] and said listen listen you don't have to
[1:30:56] believe all that
[1:30:58] maybe brother juan he said surely we've
[1:31:00] heard that word before
[1:31:01] we surely maybe they were sitting there
[1:31:03] saying how are we going to destroy our
[1:31:05] enemies
[1:31:05] how are we going to do all this this is
[1:31:07] too much and oh eve's interpreter come
[1:31:09] by
[1:31:09] and said surely when we cross in the
[1:31:11] land we can all live peaceably together
[1:31:17] surely when we get in the land we can
[1:31:19] find a way to put up with the highlights
[1:31:21] surely when we get we can make a deal
[1:31:23] with the japanese and the amorites of
[1:31:25] the parasite
[1:31:26] surely we don't do that amen but but
[1:31:28] moses said but if you will not drive god
[1:31:29] said through moses
[1:31:31] if he will not drive out the inhabitants
[1:31:33] of the land from before you
[1:31:34] then it shall come to pass that those
[1:31:37] which he
[1:31:38] let remain see those which ye let remain
[1:31:43] of them shall be pricks in your eyes and
[1:31:46] thorns in your side
[1:31:47] and shall vet you in the land wherein
[1:31:49] you dwell i'm gonna preach to you for a
[1:31:51] second
[1:31:52] because a lot of people's been blaming
[1:31:53] everybody for their problems
[1:31:55] in reality it's your own fault
[1:31:59] you've been blaming the preacher you've
[1:32:01] been blaming mama you've been blaming
[1:32:03] your husband
[1:32:04] been blaming your wife blaming everybody
[1:32:06] but the reality of it is you
[1:32:07] let some things remain that needed to be
[1:32:10] destroyed
[1:32:12] [Applause]
[1:32:14] now that word remain means to be left
[1:32:16] over to remain over to leave
[1:32:18] to preserve alive to show preeminence so
[1:32:21] maybe when they went in there brother
[1:32:22] one they said now listen here amorites
[1:32:24] you stay on your side and i'll stay on
[1:32:26] my side
[1:32:27] amen and maybe they agreed that for a
[1:32:28] few days but then then a few days later
[1:32:31] hear that oh am rock come over and they

[1:33:16] be pressed hard upon
[1:33:17] to show hostility toward to treat with

[1:34:21] and that old vexer raises his head
[1:34:23] before you would be hurt
[1:34:25] before you could be knocked down for
[1:34:27] hitting him but when he comes on your
[1:34:29] land

[1:35:37] this a bit more simple for you okay as
[1:35:39] plain as i can
[1:35:40] in egypt they had straight jackets when
[1:35:42] it come to praising god
[1:35:44] when they wanted to raise their hands
[1:35:45] and sing and shout there was an old
[1:35:47] taskmaster there that would draw out his
[1:35:49] whip and say shut up
[1:35:50] and get back to work when they would
[1:35:52] want to praise god a little bit
[1:35:54] there was an old task master there who
[1:35:56] would come by and harass him
[1:35:57] and tell him you're making too much
[1:35:58] noise and you're being a little too
[1:36:00] pentecostal
[1:36:01] and you've got a little bit too much joy
[1:36:03] and he would shut them up
[1:36:04] and you know what because they was in a
[1:36:06] land that was not theirs
[1:36:07] they had to listen to him they had to
[1:36:09] obey him oh but when they got on the
[1:36:11] other side
[1:36:15] when they got in the promised land if
[1:36:18] they wanted to shout
[1:36:19] they could shout if they wanted to
[1:36:21] rejoice they could rejoice
[1:36:23] if they wanted to sing they could sing
[1:36:25] if they wanted to preach
[1:36:27] they could preach and if one devil if
[1:36:29] one devil raised his head
[1:36:31] and said you can't do that they would
[1:36:33] pry out their sword
[1:36:34] and say in the name of the lord i'll
[1:36:36] take your head off and i'll tell you
[1:36:38] what tonight church
[1:36:39] it's sword raw in time it's shore
[1:36:42] drawing time
[1:36:43] it's time to draw our swords it's time
[1:36:46] to stand
[1:36:46] as the mighty army of god and take our
[1:36:50] land
[1:36:52] oh what did he do separated us open to
[1:36:55] us a new land
[1:36:56] amen see the first husband has to be
[1:36:58] dead right see that's the reason
[1:37:00] you have to be born again you have to
[1:37:02] separate you have to die to that first
[1:37:04] husband
[1:37:04] you can't live with it
[1:37:10] invisible union you can't live with it
[1:37:14] you just can't say well i'll divorce him
[1:37:18] and hang him up here to another occasion
[1:37:22] no sir he says no riding a divorcement
[1:37:27] he dies
[1:37:31] the nature of the world has to die
[1:37:34] every speck of him has to die you have
[1:37:37] to be reunited again
[1:37:39] with another nature
[1:37:44] now you say letter die amen god let it
[1:37:47] die
[1:37:48] that's a direct quote brother says
[1:37:49] invisible union now closing and saying
[1:37:51] this
[1:37:51] finishing up the great commission how
[1:37:53] could they do it we know they're dead
[1:37:55] god let it die in this sign to engage
[1:37:57] all of it
[1:37:58] so he could do what open up the seven
[1:38:02] seal mystery to the undenominational
[1:38:05] bride
[1:38:07] how can the denomination accept those
[1:38:10] seven seals
[1:38:11] when it's absolutely contrary to serpent
[1:38:13] seed and all other things
[1:38:15] the whole full seven mysteries is
[1:38:17] contrary to what they've been taught
[1:38:18] because they took the old school
[1:38:20] from their bible school they took the
[1:38:22] old school from their bible school
[1:38:24] amen but god let it die remember it says
[1:38:26] see remember the law never took them to
[1:38:28] the promised land
[1:38:29] joshua took them over grace not the law
[1:38:31] and neither will the denomination
[1:38:33] any denomination ever take the church of
[1:38:35] god over it'll be by the grace of god
[1:38:38] that shed abroad in our hearts by the
[1:38:40] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:38:42] that will take us to the promised land
[1:38:44] in the fullness of god's blessings
[1:38:46] certainly it is they make a fatal
[1:38:48] mistake what they do these things
[1:38:50] brother bram says it served its purpose
[1:38:52] very well
[1:38:53] but the time come when it wasn't good no
[1:38:55] more and
[1:38:56] god let it die out so he could take the
[1:38:59] grace
[1:38:59] so he could take grace and take them
[1:39:01] across and
[1:39:02] positionally place them into their
[1:39:05] places
[1:39:06] in the promised land come on church amen

[1:44:44] innocent pretty probably god said don't

[1:44:49] might have staples and shrines and say
[1:44:51] aw man like a dying cat but that don't
[1:44:52] change god's word
[1:44:54] the promise is ours the same peter of
[1:44:57] fire
[1:44:58] that led the children of israel through
[1:44:59] that wilderness and went with him to the
[1:45:00] promised land here he is with us tonight
[1:45:05] even had his picture taken with us
[1:45:08] all over and over showing the same signs
[1:45:11] and wonders
[1:45:12] yes so what joshua was telling them was
[1:45:15] he was saying either you'll deal with it
[1:45:17] now
[1:45:19] in its infancy
[1:45:26] or it will deal with you later in its
[1:45:30] maturity praise the lord
[1:45:34] now can i have a little liberty here
[1:45:35] tonight
[1:45:37] the protagonist says let me say this my
[1:45:39] friend you better destroy
[1:45:42] your enemy before your
[1:45:45] enemy destroys you
[1:45:49] but brother andrew it's just a spirit
[1:45:51] but spirits are real
[1:45:54] can i let you in a little secret and
[1:45:56] time doesn't change spirits
[1:46:00] it only gives them time to grow and
[1:46:02] mature
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:05] you say what are you talking about i'll
[1:46:06] talk like this you take a you take it
[1:46:08] you take a young boy
[1:46:09] that's got it's a high passion young boy
[1:46:11] and he can't keep his hands off girls
[1:46:13] running girls all the time
[1:46:14] and he gets up to be about a 40 50 year
[1:46:16] old man he got that same spirit on him
[1:46:18] still chasing women still chasing girls
[1:46:20] can't live with one wife
[1:46:22] then you let him get about 75 80 years
[1:46:24] old put him in a nurse at home
[1:46:25] and that same spirit on him he'll be
[1:46:27] flirting and flirting carrying over the
[1:46:29] nurses
[1:46:30] right pulling it there pulling at their
[1:46:31] closet why because the spirit didn't die
[1:46:34] it only matured over time
[1:46:38] are y'all hearing me see the spirit that
[1:46:40] that man should have destroyed
[1:46:42] he put and said well we'll we'll make an
[1:46:44] agreement okay i'll i'll leave you alone
[1:46:46] but but he should have destroyed it
[1:46:48] amen now i know it may get a little
[1:46:50] tight here but that's okay because i'm
[1:46:51] prepared for it to get tired
[1:46:52] because friends we're at rapture time
[1:46:55] we're at the coming of the lord
[1:46:57] literally the coming lord is knocking at
[1:46:59] the door of the church
[1:47:00] the world is falling apart do you
[1:47:02] realize end time prophecies are falling
[1:47:04] in place
[1:47:05] as we speak
[1:47:08] it's time to destroy these things amen
[1:47:11] i don't know how long i'm supposed to
[1:47:12] preach but if i can have a few more
[1:47:13] minutes
[1:47:16] in luke 8 26 the bible says they arrived
[1:47:18] at the country the gatherings which is
[1:47:20] over in galilee
[1:47:21] and when he went forth to land there met
[1:47:23] him out of the city a certain man which
[1:47:24] had devils a long time
[1:47:26] and where no clothes neither a boat in
[1:47:28] any house
[1:47:29] but in the tombs and when he saw jesus
[1:47:31] he cried out and fell down before him
[1:47:34] and with a loud voice said what have i
[1:47:35] to do with thee jesus thou son of god
[1:47:37] most high
[1:47:38] i beseech thee torment me not for he had
[1:47:41] commanded the unclean spirit to come out
[1:47:43] of the man for oftentimes he caught him
[1:47:44] and he was kept
[1:47:45] he was kept bound with chains and
[1:47:46] fetters and he broke the bands and was
[1:47:48] driven out of the devil
[1:47:49] and was driven out was driven of the
[1:47:51] devil into the wilderness see the devil
[1:47:53] unclean spirits possessing people
[1:47:55] driving them
[1:47:56] drove this man into the wilderness and
[1:47:58] jesus said what is that name he said
[1:48:00] legion because many devils are entered
[1:48:02] in him
[1:48:02] notice here and they besought him then
[1:48:03] he would not command them to go in the
[1:48:05] deep there was a herd of many swan now
[1:48:06] you know the story
[1:48:07] he cast them out and they win the swine
[1:48:09] that comes along and says oh there is
[1:48:10] one blessed thing
[1:48:11] you can't go to him but he can come to
[1:48:13] you and he has never at any time failed
[1:48:15] one day now in the land of gadara no
[1:48:17] doubt a sociable god-fearing citizen
[1:48:19] once lived
[1:48:20] and he got out with the wrong crowd
[1:48:23] first thing and maybe just married and
[1:48:26] had two or three little kitties
[1:48:27] but he got mixed up in the wrong group
[1:48:29] and there's where many a young man and
[1:48:31] young woman
[1:48:32] loses out getting mixed up in the wrong
[1:48:34] group the wrong associates
[1:48:36] and so one night they take him out and
[1:48:38] give him a drink go play a little game
[1:48:39] or do this or gamble a little bit
[1:48:41] it won't hurt then the first devil
[1:48:42] entered into him
[1:48:44] see unclean spirits the first devil
[1:48:46] entered into him
[1:48:47] he went home and had to tell his wife a
[1:48:48] lie see then the second devil entered
[1:48:50] into him
[1:48:51] and until he was possessed amen are you
[1:48:54] with me i'm not going to preach all
[1:48:55] night
[1:48:55] but he was possessed with a legion and
[1:48:58] he got beyond any
[1:49:00] help
[1:49:03] and the poor little fellow was drove out
[1:49:05] in the tombs
[1:49:07] did you ever notice the devil likes to
[1:49:08] dwell in the tombs
[1:49:10] the devil stays around an old dead place
[1:49:13] and he says and that don't exclude
[1:49:15] churches either
[1:49:16] when they get colder it's a devil's
[1:49:19] hangout
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:22] now just imagine for a minute when he
[1:49:25] got mixed up with the wrong with the
[1:49:26] wrong group
[1:49:28] and maybe he took that first drink
[1:49:31] you know maybe maybe after he took it
[1:49:32] something said oh that was so wrong
[1:49:35] he felt conviction god i shouldn't have
[1:49:38] done that
[1:49:39] god i'm sorry
[1:49:42] maybe that conviction maybe that
[1:49:44] conviction wrote him all the way home
[1:49:47] and he got home and opened the door and
[1:49:48] nursed to his wife and said where you
[1:49:50] been and he lied to her
[1:49:54] conviction come but maybe that time it
[1:49:56] wasn't as strong as he did the first
[1:49:57] time
[1:49:59] see little by little it got easier until
[1:50:02] the maniac of gadara
[1:50:04] had an opportunity to deal with those
[1:50:05] spirits but instead spirits began to
[1:50:08] accumulate
[1:50:10] the prophet said this way jesus said
[1:50:12] unto him come out of him that's right
[1:50:13] you unclean spirit
[1:50:14] now look the devil had a good home
[1:50:17] church
[1:50:21] direct coat so he didn't want to leave
[1:50:23] that country
[1:50:25] it was a good hangout he liked to hang
[1:50:27] out around there
[1:50:28] so he had him a good home place settled
[1:50:29] down so he just didn't want to leave the
[1:50:31] place
[1:50:31] and that's the way the devil that's the
[1:50:33] way with devils
[1:50:35] whenever they once gets settled down
[1:50:41] when they come in they're not hard to
[1:50:42] deal with when they get settled down
[1:50:46] he says amongst a bunch of people they
[1:50:48] don't want to leave
[1:50:50] oh they're stubborn say now i don't
[1:50:51] believe in such things as my healing i
[1:50:53] don't believe in that kind of stuff sure
[1:50:54] not
[1:50:55] that's the devil making you do that
[1:50:59] but can i show you something can i show
[1:51:01] you something
[1:51:03] it got easier for him and what's not
[1:51:06] dealt with in one generation
[1:51:10] goes to the next that's right like
[1:51:13] brother bram says here one media
[1:51:14] remember
[1:51:15] brother brown come home and the phone
[1:51:16] rang right the phone came
[1:51:18] the phone rang ram told her said who is
[1:51:20] it she said it's the lawyer
[1:51:21] he said tell him i'm not home remember
[1:51:25] he said tell him i'm not home and said i
[1:51:27] stepped outside and he said didn't mean
[1:51:29] he told him and she had to lie
[1:51:31] and everybody said then i come back in i
[1:51:32] went to pray for that baby and he said
[1:51:34] the spirit of god fell upon me and said
[1:51:35] you lied
[1:51:36] remember that yeah number one tells this
[1:51:38] total deliverance he said that afternoon
[1:51:40] i went to pray for a sick baby
[1:51:41] and before i left the house
[1:51:45] this is after me and it's done her what
[1:51:47] what he had her do
[1:51:48] he said before i left the house the
[1:51:50] phone rang again
[1:51:52] and my little joseph run over and took a
[1:51:54] hold of the phone
[1:51:55] and said daddy do you want me to tell
[1:51:57] him you're not here
[1:52:02] see how quick
[1:52:06] he said you see how sin corrupts
[1:52:09] what a family that would finally be
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] had brother branham not dealt with it
[1:52:20] what a family that would have been
[1:52:25] had jesus not found the maniac of godair
[1:52:29] and commanded them demons to go out of
[1:52:30] him what a family
[1:52:33] that would have been you say what are
[1:52:36] you preaching that preacher i'll tell
[1:52:37] you what i'm preaching
[1:52:39] i'm saying this you've got to serve
[1:52:42] eviction notice
[1:52:46] tonight is the night
[1:52:49] to serve eviction notice on the devil
[1:52:53] neither give place that word place means
[1:52:56] room quarter license any portion space
[1:52:59] district village opportunity power
[1:53:00] occasion fractal neither give place to
[1:53:02] the devil
[1:53:04] don't think sitting there in the
[1:53:05] wheelchair that you're hoping to help us
[1:53:06] you're not
[1:53:08] don't let that negative thought ever
[1:53:10] pass through
[1:53:12] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[1:53:14] from going through your mind that's
[1:53:15] right but don't let it stop
[1:53:16] like the old farmer said i can't keep
[1:53:17] the birds from flying over my place
[1:53:19] but he had a double barrel shotgun and
[1:53:22] said i can sure keep him from roosting
[1:53:26] you do the same thing don't let them
[1:53:29] roost
[1:53:30] don't let them devils have time to
[1:53:32] settle down
[1:53:34] you say that why are you saying this
[1:53:35] because what you don't deal with just
[1:53:37] builds up
[1:53:40] like revelation 18 1 and everything said
[1:53:42] after these things i saw another angel
[1:53:44] come down from heaven
[1:53:45] having great power and the earth was
[1:53:46] lighted with his glory and he cried
[1:53:48] madly with a strong voice saying babylon
[1:53:50] the greatest fallen has fallen
[1:53:51] and it's become the habitation which the
[1:53:53] word habitation is abode
[1:53:55] has become the abode of devils has
[1:53:57] become the house of devils
[1:53:58] and the hold of every foul spirit in a
[1:54:00] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[1:54:02] now revelation 17 says the mystery
[1:54:04] babylon the mother of harlots mother is
[1:54:06] the the daughters are the harlots
[1:54:08] now notice here now this is now the
[1:54:10] discovery of her mystery
[1:54:12] and her children's mystery
[1:54:15] what's she allowed to accumulate are
[1:54:17] y'all following me
[1:54:19] come down into harlot dalton he said see
[1:54:22] looking
[1:54:22] after the mystery was made known who she
[1:54:24] was what she was who her daughters was
[1:54:26] the mystery made known
[1:54:27] then god sent an angel messenger to what
[1:54:29] call
[1:54:30] come out the message of the hour the
[1:54:33] message of the hour came to uncover and
[1:54:35] deal with our lives
[1:54:37] can i say it like this god dealt with
[1:54:38] israel he did
[1:54:40] yeah but there were some things israel
[1:54:43] didn't deal with that came back
[1:54:48] but andrew what are you saying i'm
[1:54:50] saying right here in this meeting
[1:54:51] tonight
[1:54:53] you have a choice that's right
[1:54:56] right here in this meeting tonight you
[1:54:58] have a choice you say my you slow down a
[1:55:00] lot yeah i did
[1:55:02] because i believe the spirit of the
[1:55:03] lord's here tonight
[1:55:06] and i think sometimes we can shout
[1:55:08] conviction right out the door
[1:55:10] that's okay to say it that way
[1:55:13] just start shouting and shouting and
[1:55:14] shouting and forgetting there's some
[1:55:16] things we need to deal with
[1:55:18] i believe it shall not do it all the
[1:55:20] time but either you'll deal with it now
[1:55:23] or you'll continue to sweep it under the
[1:55:24] rug
[1:55:26] and let it build up and build up
[1:55:29] and build up but i say to you tonight
[1:55:32] the time is at hand to deal with it
[1:55:36] the time is at hand tonight to expose
[1:55:39] that devil
[1:55:43] you have got the authority tonight by
[1:55:45] the almighty god to serve eviction
[1:55:47] notice on the devil
[1:55:51] you know how you serve an eviction
[1:55:52] notice you go in brother and say
[1:55:56] get out
[1:55:59] get out yeah you've been living here but
[1:56:02] go find you another place to live
[1:56:05] kick that devil out the devil says but
[1:56:07] how am i going to get home i wrote here
[1:56:08] in your car i don't know find another
[1:56:10] way home
[1:56:10] but you ain't riding home with me
[1:56:14] time to go time to deal with it
[1:56:17] time to destroy them things god gave us
[1:56:20] space to repent
[1:56:21] yes the bible there says i gave her a
[1:56:25] space to repent of her fornication
[1:56:26] and she repented not see that word space
[1:56:28] means time
[1:56:30] season wow time either long or short
[1:56:34] i gave her time to repent i give her
[1:56:36] time to change one's mind to repent
[1:56:38] to change one's mind for better to
[1:56:40] hardly to amend with the abhorrence
[1:56:42] of one's past sins to to to repent of it
[1:56:47] but andrew i don't want i don't like
[1:56:48] repentance preaching while repentance is
[1:56:49] the key that unlocks the door of revival
[1:56:55] you say blender i i don't know if i i
[1:56:56] don't know if we can deal with these
[1:56:57] things we can tonight
[1:57:01] and you know what i know this may be
[1:57:03] different but
[1:57:04] i trust it's okay you know what we can
[1:57:07] we can suppress
[1:57:08] things but let me tell you can only
[1:57:11] suppress
[1:57:12] him so long
[1:57:15] you can only push him down so long
[1:57:18] the prophet said you know this church
[1:57:20] was actually more wicked speaking the
[1:57:21] catholic church than they have
[1:57:22] do you know that he repented for a while
[1:57:23] and walked softly before god you can't
[1:57:25] say that at the roman catholic church no
[1:57:27] sir
[1:57:27] she has never repented but has
[1:57:29] stubbornly destroyed any and all who
[1:57:30] tried to help her repent
[1:57:31] that is history now god kept raising up
[1:57:34] not only the messengers to each age but
[1:57:35] he raised up some wonderful helpers for
[1:57:37] those messengers
[1:57:38] he gave every age some wonderful men of
[1:57:40] god and they did everything they could
[1:57:42] to bring the church back to god
[1:57:44] god certainly gave her opportunity and
[1:57:45] helped to repent did she ever repent and
[1:57:48] how
[1:57:48] she did by her first fruit by her fruits
[1:57:50] no sir she never has
[1:57:52] she never will she is drunk he says she
[1:57:55] has lost
[1:57:56] her senses in spiritual things
[1:57:59] now don't be confused to start thinking
[1:58:01] that the church of rome has repented of
[1:58:02] her slaughter of the saints
[1:58:03] because she is attempting to unite with
[1:58:05] the protestants by making her creeds
[1:58:07] line up with protestant creeds
[1:58:09] not once has she ever apologized and
[1:58:11] said she was wrong for her mass murders
[1:58:13] and she won't either
[1:58:14] and no matter how mellow and sweet she
[1:58:17] appears at this particular time
[1:58:20] she will yet rise up to kill for murder
[1:58:23] lies
[1:58:24] in her evil and unrepented heart
[1:58:29] preacher what are you saying i'm saying
[1:58:30] you don't destroy a tree by destroying
[1:58:32] you destroy your tree by destroying the
[1:58:33] root
[1:58:35] the life of it you destroy a spirit
[1:58:39] by destroying the root of it
[1:58:43] paul said lester didn't root at any time
[1:58:45] the root of bitterness bringing up
[1:58:46] trouble you
[1:58:48] how many can say tonight lord i hear you
[1:58:49] speaking to me
[1:58:52] i hear you tonight lord there there's
[1:58:54] some things that
[1:58:55] that i need to deal with there's some
[1:58:59] there's some
[1:58:59] yeah i was in the meat one time and got
[1:59:01] the power of god i got the nerve up
[1:59:03] enough to kick that ammo right out of
[1:59:04] the way
[1:59:05] but i looked over and i saw that little
[1:59:07] cute baby
[1:59:09] and i said no way and now that baby's
[1:59:12] matured into his dad
[1:59:14] and things i thought i had victory over
[1:59:17] they're right back here in front of me
[1:59:18] tonight
[1:59:20] brother i must be beyond help i must be
[1:59:22] beyond grace no
[1:59:24] i come to k i come to tell you tonight
[1:59:28] kick it out of the way you love him
[1:59:31] tonight
[1:59:32] as our musicians come
[1:59:38] it's time to deal with it
[1:59:41] it's not time to learn how to it's not
[1:59:43] terminal it's not time to learn how to
[1:59:45] put up with it
[1:59:48] it's time to destroy it
[1:59:54] there's a pastor over in ohio you some
[1:59:55] of you may know me
[1:59:58] pastor the church that pastors the
[2:00:00] church there
[2:00:01] he was telling us testimony one time
[2:00:03] about how he years ago he
[2:00:05] moved i think he shared this testimony
[2:00:07] with several brothers so i'm sure you
[2:00:08] don't mind me sharing it
[2:00:10] but it's talking about how he moved into
[2:00:11] a or he moved into pastor in there and
[2:00:13] he had
[2:00:14] had some converts coming to the church
[2:00:16] and one one day they asked him said
[2:00:18] said preacher said we got some problems
[2:00:19] in our home so when we bought this home
[2:00:22] said we
[2:00:23] we went in and said there was there was
[2:00:24] demons in the home that was demon
[2:00:25] spirits
[2:00:26] i think they had practiced witchcraft or
[2:00:27] something in the house before
[2:00:29] so there was demons there and he said so
[2:00:31] they asked me to come over
[2:00:33] and he said i believe if it goes
[2:00:34] correctly their little girl was having
[2:00:36] just just having fits out of nowhere
[2:00:38] she'd just break out and fit
[2:00:39] just break out screaming and crying and
[2:00:41] carrying on and they could not figure
[2:00:43] out what was going on
[2:00:45] so brother juan the pastor went over
[2:00:46] there one day and he goes in and he said
[2:00:47] hey he said
[2:00:49] said that got some issues here and they
[2:00:51] said yes and our daughter
[2:00:52] she she just breaks out in these fits
[2:00:56] so we don't we don't we can't figure it
[2:00:57] out so the only thing we can think of is
[2:01:00] there was
[2:01:00] there was a this there was witchcraft
[2:01:02] practice in this house years ago
[2:01:04] and said when we moved in said doors
[2:01:07] would just open up on their own
[2:01:09] literally the door would just open up
[2:01:11] for the one just nobody in there the
[2:01:12] the bedroom door just opened wide open
[2:01:14] then it shut on its own it was a demon
[2:01:16] listen friends demons are real
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:19] and the parents said you know what to
[2:01:21] make a long story short the parents said
[2:01:22] you know what we did
[2:01:23] we went in there and said now demon if
[2:01:25] you'll leave us alone we'll leave you
[2:01:26] alone
[2:01:30] brother told me he said man i thought
[2:01:31] what in the world have i got myself into
[2:01:34] he said what they did was they made a
[2:01:36] deal with that demon
[2:01:38] and he said they let that demon stay in
[2:01:40] the house and they thought they were
[2:01:41] controlling it and come to find out that
[2:01:44] demon was tormenting that child in the
[2:01:46] middle of the night
[2:01:48] listen friends we are the church of the
[2:01:51] living god
[2:01:53] we are the bride of jesus christ we are
[2:01:56] the most powerful
[2:01:58] force of people on the face of the earth
[2:02:01] tonight you the people i'm looking at
[2:02:05] tonight with the baptism of the holy
[2:02:07] ghost
[2:02:07] is more powerful than the press of the
[2:02:09] united states of america
[2:02:13] the people i'm looking at tonight has
[2:02:15] got more authority
[2:02:18] do you realize you realize how powerful
[2:02:20] you are
[2:02:21] remember you can speak the world into
[2:02:23] existence
[2:02:25] and go live on it
[2:02:28] if we can speak a world into existence
[2:02:30] and go live on it

[2:03:25] god said when a church
[2:03:27] gets cold it becomes the devil's hangout
[2:03:30] prophet said you know you did you know
[2:03:32] how big a root out

[2:03:35] and just get down at it dig it till

[2:03:38] and he said if there'd be any root of
[2:03:40] bitterness bring it up into you
[2:03:42] grub her out that's right that's what
[2:03:43] the holy spirit does roots out all the
[2:03:45] bitterness
[2:03:47] church we've been gentle with the devil
[2:03:48] long enough
[2:03:50] jesus said the kingdom of heaven

[2:14:46] rejoice
[2:14:47] she began to praise god the holy ghost

[2:15:03] she said i'm free of this thing i've
[2:15:05] been liberated of this thing
[2:15:08] my brother sister i'll be honest with
[2:15:09] you okay it was that same girl that
[2:15:12] testified
[2:15:13] in that meeting over there that previous
[2:15:15] saturday about what god had done for her
[2:15:17] was the same girl that had that chord to
[2:15:19] play that song was the same girl that
[2:15:21] demon manifested itself in was the same
[2:15:23] girl that demon left
[2:15:26] now when you got an 18-hour ride home on
[2:15:28] a plane you got a lot of time to think
[2:15:30] right
[2:15:31] so on the way home i was thinking i was
[2:15:33] praying thinking about the meetings
[2:15:34] praying for the people and it just began
[2:15:36] to ponder in my mind brother juan
[2:15:38] how could that girl be possessed like
[2:15:41] that how did that happen
[2:15:42] just just praying about it lord how did
[2:15:44] that happen and i was sitting at home
[2:15:46] and i sit in my office i was getting a
[2:15:48] preacher at the church at home
[2:15:49] i sit in my office they're listening to
[2:15:50] a tape and brother come down the end of
[2:15:52] the tape he said now in the name of
[2:15:53] jesus christ
[2:15:55] he said i command every devil to take
[2:15:57] your hands
[2:15:58] off of god's property
[2:16:02] did y'all hear me he said take your
[2:16:04] hands off of god's property
[2:16:06] and brother juan when he said that it
[2:16:08] was like it was just like something
[2:16:09] happened to me
[2:16:10] i just jumped up i said right there's
[2:16:12] the answer i went back played it again
[2:16:14] to make sure i heard it right
[2:16:16] you know what he said sis he said i
[2:16:17] command every devil to take your hands
[2:16:19] off of god's property
[2:16:21] i said right there it is he never one
[2:16:24] time
[2:16:24] said i command every devil to take your
[2:16:26] hands off and let them become god's
[2:16:29] property
[2:16:29] but they were god's property before the
[2:16:31] devil ever put his hands on them
[2:16:34] therefore he could serve eviction notice
[2:16:38] and say take your hands off of god's
[2:16:40] property and i say to not
[2:16:42] church you was god's property before the
[2:16:44] devil laid one filthy hand on you
[2:16:47] and in the name of jesus christ i
[2:16:49] command the devil to take his hands
[2:16:51] off of god's property in the name of
[2:16:54] jesus
[2:16:55] for the glory of god take your hands off
[2:16:58] of god's property
[2:16:59] you're the sons of god you're the
[2:17:01] daughters of god
[2:17:02] you've been bought with the price you've
[2:17:04] been redeemed by the blood of jesus

[2:19:55] are lost in interest in spiritual things
[2:19:59] there is no way that we can there is no
[2:20:02] price we can put to this service tonight
[2:20:06] it looks like a few people here tonight

[2:20:13] like uh uh
[2:20:14] uh uh you know what and everything from
[2:20:17] the beginning of the service but there
[2:20:18] is no prize

[2:20:46] and i mean the holy spirit the spirit of
[2:20:47] the law was all over the place
[2:20:51] he was just calling out in different
[2:20:53] direction
[2:20:57] helping us to be able to identify things
[2:21:00] in our lives
[2:21:03] bringing us to the place
