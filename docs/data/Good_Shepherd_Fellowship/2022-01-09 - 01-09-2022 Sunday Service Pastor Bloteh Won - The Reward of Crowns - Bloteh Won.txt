want to thank the lord for this opportunity that we have to come and bring our praise our gratitude our worship to the king of kings and the lord of lord amen praise the lord amen the lord bless you you may have your seat for a while let's just go over a few greetings here prayer requests and then we will sing a song and change the order of the service here praise the lord amen amen [Music] once again we want to we want to say happy new year to to each and every one of you it's good to see sons and daughters stay pressing onto the mark of the high calling and we just want to continue to encourage ourselves believing that the lord is faithful and his grace is going to be with each and every one of us praise the lord god bless you brother one good to see you amen and uh uh i would like to address this uh first uh we will uh uh just go over our time again is uh we know that the doors open at ten o'clock and uh that they can saw some of the usher's brothers try to be here or some of our sisters that helped with the sound try to be here at ten o'clock but i i i kind of noticed we were we were the trying to do from 10 o'clock to 10 15 a time of prayer and then we go on playing the tape just before we get into the service and i also realized that uh some are able to make it some are not able to make it here at ten o'clock and that's okay and one good thing there is that if you uh either on the youtube facebook channel you can be able to follow whatever is being played and one of the reason why we did that was one of the major reason was to encourage ourselves to to continue to play and listen to the voice of the messenger that's one reason and the second reason there is that you know when you talk about melee meditation time you realize that when the prelude of the music is playing if you don't have anything to set your mind on the devil is going to give you something to put your mind on so that is that is all part of our meditation time but i realized a couple of few times being in l.a i will see the the sound people will come and they go right back there trying to to get the tip on get the music going get the tape on and it's just they are just there from that time to the end of the service and then right right after the service uh i saw some of the sisters trying to get a little time to sit down and and meditating you know trying to be able to get something that they might have heard during the service so i thought okay we might uh approach this a little bit different we will go uh those will be opened at 10 o'clock and we will have a time of prayer from 10 to about 10 25 or 10 30 if you can be in prayer for that long but what will happen is they had a right in the midst of that time around 10 25 or so uh the sound team we will return on whatever we are playing that that morning i'm hoping the other you know uh you know i mean just playing the message of the prophet or maybe plain we might choose to play the book of the bible maybe the book of genesis or any book of the bible that we choose to play and it would just be you know to be able to remind us i mean if a person does not play the tip of the prophet you might have the privilege to listen to one when you come here on time and so in that way uh when the sound team comes in they can be able to turn the prelude music on and and they themselves can be able to find some time to sit pray and uh you know uh if you have to do some technical things you will never know how stressful sometimes it is for them when things are not working back there we sit you know we listen to the sound or sometimes we complain when the when the speakers go wow hold your ears and and but you really don't know what all they have to go through back then so uh i will love that we come in and we all can use that time to come and pray and by writing between 10 20 10 25 they will turn the message on and and all of that is just to help set our mind on positive things set our mind on the lord set out our mind on something that the prophet of god myself said before we just go right into the service so uh uh that that would be the order that we will we will try to follow as the law would give us grace and uh around 10 50 or so they will be able to change because actually they have to do some change changes to be able to put us right into the service for the day so uh they will know how to uh whatever they do back there just to be able to give them some room for them to be able to change that so we will come again the doors will be opening at 10 o'clock we will have our time of praying and we will also want to encourage the musicians and and every one of us to come come and you know find a place uh uh if you want knee down and pray sit down and pray one thing i would not i would not want us to do is to use that time to browse on your phone uh i mean you will be invading our space if you do that because you will be trying to bring some kind of a fourth dimension atmosphere we already have a lot to deal with when we come in here so uh uh if you will not be praying or you would not be reading your bible just sit in your car and wait for the music to be playing and then you can come and dance but i would not want uh you know anyone to use that time to be browsing on their phone doing what they are not supposed to be doing and so uh uh that would be uh you know our our time the way we would love to approach it as the lord will give us grace and then the next thing that we we would like to talk about is uh [Music] what was supposed to be the cry room that is now like a multi-purpose room we have a few young ones in church babies and mothers and i fed i felt a little bit i felt bad when you know the deacons told me have some talks with the sisters and they feel like uh they don't have some privacy to be able to take care of their babies so uh for that reason we will go back to using that room only for the mothers and and you know and the young ones you know uh when when it's service time when we come in here unless you come early uh brothers deacons usher and you want to get water from in there when it is time from service 10 o'clock either get a sister to go in that room no brother should go there either get one of your sister ask your wife to go and get something water or whatever but let it roam solely be used for the sisters that's the reason why musicians when we come if you come during the time of prayer on that we would just meet right in the foyer there and we would pray and then we would come into the building uh coming early and during the prayer time or so you you you prayed and you think that you know uh uh uh you want to talk to one of your uh uh you know teammate on you know music or different things that we can do there right in the foyer there but let that room be used for the mothers and their babies and also the hallway there now you know the law would turn our captivity around that's why he promised that he would do amen and we will be like zion one of these days but until that time we have to manage the space that we have the room down there i mean they're right in the all the hallway there uh you know uh asks uh you know unless a brother you're going right directly to use the men's room and uh uh you know let's let's not stand and hover back there because you know it also split the way there to the the sisters you know roma as well so [Music] we want to manage our space that we have and we also want to do it with a lot of decency and respect to one another praise the lord so uh i pray that the lord will you know will be able to help us and uh we will do the best that we can to be able to sell you in the best way that the lord will be able to help us and we got prayer requests yesterday the young joshua ali not feeling well he having a lot of pain in his stomach and so we want to lift him up in prayer this morning and and uh our sister also says to mary that you come here uh her husband went to be with the lord back in liberia uh so we also want to leave that family uh in pray you know when she called me and i was i was talking actually she spoke to brother johnny brother johnny called me and then uh i called her back and you know we were talking and she was telling me now she could not remember but i know i know her husband because uh uh many years back where we were having service was very adjacent to his church very close to his church you know and then sometimes we will borrow the benches from his church for service and or death so uh yeah it kind of brought a lot of memory too so we want to keep our sister in prayer that the law will be able to comfort her and the family and uh it's also good to see british and bibi some back there and uh we see uh uh some of the young people went down to arizona for the youth banquet uh spoke to brother israel i think they had a good time there and they should be back tomorrow so we also keep them in prayer let's buy our house together as we just lift these knees to the lord and if there is any other special needs on your heart that you want to live to the lord this morning we can all just speak to the lord if you don't have no one to pray for i will ask you to pray for me because i need all the prayers that i can i can get in for myself thank you thank you father thank you lord thank you jesus [Music] the light of his glory and grace turn your eyes upon jesus lord in his [Music] wonderful faith and the things of earth [Music] of his glory and break let's turn to our feet now turn your eyes

a song here um [Music] uh keep me sanctified it's uh it's an old song this is a song i thought i sent it over to [Music] it's an old song uh all him uh back in the in the seventies now let's listen let's start from the chorus keep me sanctified [Music] when the storm clouds gather when the battle get rough and the waste seems hard when i try so hard and i've been sought to failure whatever i do whatever i say keep me sanctified oh keep me sanctified [Music] is [Music] is [Music] and is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] praise the lord amen glory be to god do you feel like that to be sanctified amen amen yes sometimes my law is too heavy to carry and they see my cross [Music] when [Music] is [Music] yes lord jesus yes oh father oh hallelujah yes lord amen amen amen all the lord bless you let's just uh take our bibles thank you musicians we're going to want to go right into into the word praise the lord we started talk speaking on crossing into uh crossing jordan and possessing inheritance and all of that this morning i want to i want to start something on the rewards of crowns the rewards of crowns in the bible it talks about different crowns and and that's what we want to talk about a crown of joy the crown of life and crowns that's why we want to talk you see because [Music] i think i would do better if i have you read the scripture and sit down because it looks like i'm i'm already ready to preach now first corinthians chapter nine let's read first corinthians chapter nine praise the lord let's go first corinthians chapter nine and i think uh some of the brothers brought it up on the on the terry first night uh i think it was it was an amazing night having all of the brothers uh speaking but then started with running the race uh brother jose i mean he comes there and say if you really want to run this raid you got to start with repentance amen and i mean it was just beautiful and virgil came and brought jordan taking us right into the seven seals oh my goodness amen let's just read here uh first corinthians chapter nine we read from verse 24 and paul speak to the corinthians here and say no ye net that they wish run in a race run all but won't receive the prize so wrong that ye may obtain and every man that strived for the master it is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptible and therefore so wrong net as uncertainly sulfite are not as one that beated the air but but i keep my body now listening to this is the apost the apostle paul this is the prophet to the gentiles amen he says but i keep my body and bring it into suggestion suggestion to what to the word amen i keep my body and bring it into suggestion least that by any means when i have preached to other others i myself should be a castaway praise the lord now so it gives you an idea to to let you to see where those apostles where those great men that experience the supernatural where they stand they never felt that they did arrive because they pray for the sake or they got one miracle or the god won spiritual dreams they never felt that they have arrived they always fear there was a fighting to do praise the lord they always felt there was a fighting to do i keep my body and bring it into subjection leads by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway let us pray heavenly father lord we want to just ask your grace to come in and speak to us this morning come break your word come father lord o god and as we will pray until we get through this year we don't know what it holds lord but we know you the whole time in eternity but father we know the times are challenging father the times are perilous times the times are dark times of god where men are falling away from the faith and some are growing cold the love of god is growing cold some have sealed their mind with hot iron so god somehow make a shipwreck father lord god and we we see all of these things happening around us and we want to come to you like the apostle paul this morning to bring our mind our body in suggestion to your word father god the lord we will not run a vain raise lord we will not run a church race we will not run a religious race when i run the proud race of god but we will run the race of father lord a race of god where we are striving we are fighting lord and that's why we can say keep me centrified even lord god when i'm saying seem like i'm a failure lord and what i'm doing all that i said i need you to keep me sanctified oh dear god because sometimes lord the father just look like prayers are not being answered it looks like father god that you are not moving when even you are moving it's because you are moving so fast the lord the human mind cannot catch up lord and oh god we just thank you because you are a living god that is living among your people vindicating your word oh god father you are the same yesterday to them forever lord jesus we want to thank you lord god for your ever abiding presence that has never failed lord when you came to the earth you introduce yourself as elohim and the elohim is a coveted god you make covenant with the earth and you make covenant with the people of the earth lord even when there was no one existing you make a coveted lord father and we know that god is the same covenant you made with us i will never leave you i will never forsake you and father we can stand on that this morning lord god father and say no matter god lord ten thousand demons may rise we know that god father the captain of the horse is in the camp lord jesus we can see the shout of the lord is in the camp oh god father lord jesus we just thank you lord we appreciate you father we glorify your holy name almighty god we just want to commit ourselves this morning for service and pray that lord god you will bless lord your children this morning father speak to us lord in the way that our soul will understand and oh father we love you we appreciate you lord jesus bless your children father and all those lord god that are streaming in this morning that couldn't make the service we pray for them that you will be with them as well in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen now i want to start up like this you know wha uh we you uh you know uh brother branham said in question that answered on genesis he said god had to uh he he had to condescend himself god in the way that god does things he have god have to use the most simplest means to give us an idea of what he want to do because you see in a way our human nature is made praise the lord sometimes this this this life that we boast off and and become so proud of if you realize how reverse it is praise the lord if you realize how reverse we might think that we are walking forward but i mean it's a complete reverse we might even be walking upside down praise the lord praise the lord so you see god god will have to break things down and you will have to do things and and do things and make it simple and and make things to happen just to be able to grab our attention and give us an idea of what he's doing that's what the apostle paul can say his eyes have not seen ears have not heard neither have it come to the heart of man what god having installed now i want to talk on the rewards of crowns the reason why i said it is because when you read through the scripture and you and you you think about the the crown of life the crown of glory and the different crowns that the bible talk about all we imagine in our mind heaven they're going to set something on our heads now all we think about i'm going to have a crown praise the lord we just think about wearing some kind of a gold thing on our head you see that's that is the that is the reason why the devil knows that that's the reason why he used the the prosperity preachers and the prosperity gospel to to you know to kind of push those things in the mind of the people you know that if you are if you don't if you are not wearing a gold ring and a big gold chain around your neck and and it means that you you're not getting close to your internal reward when that does not have anything to do with eternity now you see it takes a prophet to come on the scene again and let us to know what jesus said uh in my father's house are many mansions you know uh i go and prepare your a place for you paul have already said it that uh you know uh uh uh mortal cannot inherit immortality but yeah in our mind we look at mention we are thinking about beverly hills we are thinking about out of this 10 bedroom house praise the lord so we think that we're going to heaven we're going to get a 10 bearing house 20 bearing house you know all my children will get their own room praise the lord and the prophet says no i don't think it would be a malta house amen i don't think it would be a malta house it will be a dwelling place a dwelling place that do not perish so we want to look at there this morning we want to look at that uh we want to look at that in and i will i will i want you to bear with me because uh we i i don't think i can be able to do this in one service but i will try to do my best and then we we can pick it up wednesday night i i i wanted to speak on something but i was i was looking at the weather and uh and never wanted for us to be trapped here so i kind of was uh uh i strayed a little bit from what i was going to talk about but uh i hope we we were able to grab you know a little bit of uh of the concept we read isaiah chapter 14 where uh david has already said in the psalm you know uh uh talking about the law dwelling on the in this on the side of the mountain you know mount zion the city of the lord of the great king amen and uh uh let's let's let's look at that uh because we we read that a little bit i want to i want to use that as uh as a stepping stone here that was psalm chapter 48 we read psalm chapter 48. psalm chapter 48 reading from uh verse 1 great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness great is the lord and greatly to be praised amen beautiful situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the side of the north the city of the great king praise the lord the side of the another city of the great king isaiah chapter 14 reading verse 12. now satan noun is going to express how he wants to take that place he's now going to say i'm going to do her in that place now the talk behind that is that your your your your greatest battle is where your blessings lays praise the lord your greatest weakness is where your strength lays why because a chain is only strong at its weaker length you see that's the reason why the enemy will always he want to do or he want to possess that place because he knows if he can possess that place he can he can keep you as his slave satan don't keep people as children he keep them as slaves amen because he can give birth isaiah chapter 14 we read that in verse 12 how are thou falling all lucifer son of the morning how are that cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations for thou have said in their heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the side of the north the very same place where the sami declared is the city of the great king said don't say i will make that city my my throne i will make it my sitting place praise the lord amen that's the reason why he comes to church and then if he can just get us distracted and just get us into amusement get us away from the word he's i mean he has he has he has taken over the service all he needs is just to just throw one human element into it make a showmanship no longer he keeps repeating those things in our lives and keep bringing those things up again and keep bringing it up keep bringing it up because he knows that's what your strength is if you can just bring that thing on a subjection every other thing will fall in place whether it's a little temple whether it's a little lost whatever it is if you can just subject that thing to the world every other thing will line up he knows that he knows that he has studied man since the garden of eden now so we we that so talking about that and talking about crossing over going into the inheritance and talking about we started there with rebecca and and uh i mean uh richard and leah uh uh we we talked about the birthstones then we went and talked about uh you know jacob also prophesying in his last day genesis 49 because in one of in jacob's uh a prophecy he said this about joseph let's read genesis 49 we start like this on the max go amen verse 26 the blessings of the father have prevailed above the blessings of my prayer janitors onto the uttermost bound all the everlasting hills they shall be on that on the head of joseph and on the crown of his head a crown of the head of him that was separated from his brethren now so see here in in the many blessings that he's putting on joseph he's telling joseph that you know uh uh uh the blessings you know of how god all the blessings of abraham isaac and joseph i mean abraham isaac and jacob has come on the head of joseph as a crown he's not talking about wearing a physical crown he's talking about the blessings that were that were that will overwhelm you that would crown your life praise the lord but you think about it think about it if if all of those 12 boss knew that there was there was a blessing of abraham isaac and and jacob that was going to pull down to be a crown do you think that they were going to give joseph out to be slave joseph himself did not even know that that that was going to be his end he's he keep thinking what have i done to my brothers that is so mean to me that's that's why he's thinking in his mind but you see then and and he goes through that and he goes through everything in potiphar house and he goes through everything in the prison and in all of that he keeps thinking oh my god what a life is this praise the lord but all of those things were preparing him for the crown what he would receive as a reward praise the lord amen and god actually crowned his life because until joseph died there was no man higher in egypt god crowned his life until the name joseph the name joseph a stranger a hebrew name will those egyptians in their boats god crowned him with honor respect glory but it never came on the flanks of life amen praise the lord amen do you know why you know why podify put joseph in praising the reason is because potiphar never believed his wife it was a capital punishment if it was truth joseph would have been beheaded it was a capital punishment for him being a slave yes sir he did not believe his wife praise the lord for him not to believe his wife means that joseph has lived such a life he has lived such a life praise the lord amen that it was never i mean it did not bother qualifying now he will entrust in the hands of a stranger everything that is in his house praise the lord the bible says when god was about to be made flesh and with his promise that a virgin shall conceive he was going to take a young innocent girl to fulfill his word but yet he needed a man of character to be able to protect that gift so the bible say he got a man joseph and he was a just man the bible used that word for a reason he was a just man means that he will respect every lord of course shape amen he will respect every law of courtship he will not be making up cuts i said the prophet said you know the prophet said no that even when the angel told him don't put merit away he was ready to race his life the only reason why he was thinking about putting out a white is is all because he was confused he was confused but even in the midst of that the bible says he was thinking not even to make it a public thing which means he was not going around running his mouth you see how a lot of these young girls can behave you see that the bible says he was a just man and because of that god crowned him by sending the same angel to speak to him praise the lord you see people they get so careless and it gets so trying to be funny when it's not supposed to be funny well i mean you know me i don't mind i mean if i can just get to heaven whatever way i get that there is no other way to get there there is one way to get there there is no other way to get there even if i have a brass crown or i mean if you want to cry if i can just be there those kind of a careless way of speaking and the thing is funny it's all because there is nothing there is no fighting in them they want to linger lay and sleep in sin and expect to see themselves in glory i get a news for you the bible says no idolater no drunkard no smoker so you better start fighting you better find the ground to stand and stop fighting so the bible speaks about joseph having this crown how god will crown him with the blessings of his prejudice all of jacob's fathers and all the blessings of abraham would come on this boy because he was separated god set you aside for the promise that he gave abraham after 400 years i would come down and deliver them you were the one that god set aside in your youthful age you never enjoy youthfulness as a little boy you were captured put into a a a stranger but sent across to egypt used as a slave and all of that god set you aside that way because of that he will crown you praise the lord the bathroom is getting bloody i might have bought my lady but it's okay now brother branham said this philadelphia church age let's start with the definition here he said what is a crown what is a crown we know their age was promised the crown of life he says what is a crown he says a crown means you have a domain you have a domain things have been placed on you you are a king if you are crowned amen that's the reason why the prophet of god in the book of revelation could find those 10 detectors the bible says only one hour with the beast they were crowned kings or they were makings they never said they were crowned one hour with the beast they were making but brown says they could not be made they could not be makings he says in that way they were detectors because king is not they are crown kings kings are crowned so they were they were kings without crown praise the lord so their influence with the beast they are influenced with the beast give them uh give them that power and all in all of those territories that are out there pulling you know uh uh spinning in the rest of that but let's let's just stay right here so you are a king if you are crowned see and we are sons of god sons and daughters of god when we are crowned with internal life how are you crowned with eternal life jesus said he that believeth in me amen has passed from death onto life so by faith when we reach out by faith and accept the lord jesus amen as our lord and savior he crowned us with internal life it's not what we are wearing on our head but our faith declares that we have internal life we don't get there before we have internal life we have a year that's what influenced our life in the path that we go yes sir are we together you see you are a son of god when you are crowned with internal life and our domain is the earth praise the lord amen our domain is the earth so while we are here as a son of god as a daughter of god that is crowned the son of god crown the daughter of god we have a domain that we we there they are things that we have to bring under control there are things that we have to bring honor control we can do it ourselves that's the reason why the holy spirit is offered to you that's why the holy spirit god offered you his spirit are we together the earth is our domain [Music] make you priests and kings unto god is that right now so you see the whole subject about crowns you read in the scripture you will see the uh the whole subject about crowns different crowns we will look at as we look at the subject together but the the thing about it there is that uh in the way that the bible speak about this crown like i said there are rewards that are given to the faithful the crown of righteousness the crown of life the crown of joy now so you see god has crowned an individual life amen that's why sometimes you don't understand it it looks like other people try to be i mean what what is the guy god has crowned a male life with with truth with righteousness amen he just i mean he just frown at any shitty thing anything that that is questionable he frowns i ate he can lose sleep he can lose weight praise the lord because that man has walked with god in such a way he has trusted god he has proven god in different ways and he knows that god is his provider he's resting on the word of god until god comes around and crown his life some people are crowned with hospitality they can take their lives and give it they enjoy doing it it's part of their life god crowns joseph received his crown in this life praise the lord it's after the man has crossed over he has now entered the promised lane he has entered the territory where he's taking his position he knows now that he's the son of god man i got to stop all of this nonsense stop playing church i mean i got to possess something of god [Music] and then god comes down and crowned his life god comes down and crown his life praise the lord some people are wearing their crowns amen and maybe you think their crown looks funny on their head that guy you just he just me i can do that i can take that nonsense but don't worry it's not your call god has crowned a man life there's nothing you can do about it there is nothing that you can do about it paul says they are not perishable crowns so god do not crown us with substance he crying us with character because substance are perishable characters are not perishable that character will always bring substance around you oh praise the lord are we together leviticus chapter 21. let's run a little bit now amen i don't want to put you to sleep so don't sleep on me leviticus 21. let's let's just look at another biblical uh uh approach here 21 verse 12 neither shall he go in to any dead body that's the priest now none defied himself what what am i reading okay define himself for his father or for his mother that's supposed to be reading twelve i'm reading eleven miracha he go out of the century non-profane the century of his god for the crown of the anointing oil so you see when the priest is pulled when that's that's why all was used to to anoint the priest or anoint the king it becomes a crown when a man is anointed praise the lord if there is any sacred morning who says the book of james call the other and let them be anointed with oil when that order is anointed that's that's the reason why we put it right on your forehead amen we don't want to waste a whole bottle of oil praise the lord the preacher just put a tongue on your forehead what happened is that he have crowned you to be able to bring that sickness on a possession amen it's just a symbol the oil do not the oil do not heal it's the word of god that heal the word of god says the sick must be anointed with oil amen the kings were anointed with oil so when the oil is pulled upon the king he has a crown he's been put into office all the other one they would do uh uh other out of those one they are just ceremony they have formality going to find a special crime and put on it is when the when the prophet has already come and he has turned down that horn of oil over your head that's all you have been crowned you have an anointing on you a positionally place you into that office praise the lord when samuel anointed david he didn't have to wait for a ceremony for them to be bringing him down it took 30 years before david would wear a crown on his head but yet he was already positionally placed as a prophet that's the reason why he could go to the battlefront and defend ezra because that was the position of the king when saul and his men were hiding under their beds for the crown of the anointing oil of his god is upon him for the crown of the anointing lord of his god is upon him toshna man anointed and do my profit no harm are we together proverb 12. i just run through some few scriptures here i already told you that i won't finish this in one day so now that i've told you i don't have to hurry up oh let's look in the book of job first job chapter 2. but i'm bringing it to a place i want for us to watch up here people praise the lord all that god will help us amen that the lord god will help us now this is this is where the bible speaks about job being crowned with bob's sickness all over his body from the sword of his foot to the crown of his head chapter 19 verse 9. the bible says he you have stripped me off my glory and taking the crown from my head because of the illness now because it's covered with sickness all over his body a familiar psalm in psalm 103 so i'm just all reading all of this scripture to you to show us that there are different things in in in our lives that crown you see in the scripture how people are crowned with pride amen when people just take wickedness to be their identity psalm 103 let's read this up it's a sign we can read the blessing there bless the lord o my soul and all that is with amen bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not his benefits who has forgiven all thine iniquity who have healeth all thy diseases praise the lord amen who redeemeth the life from destruction and he crowned thee with loving kindness intent of mercy he redeemed you from destruction and he he have crowned you he have rewarded us more than we have been good to him god has crowned us with loving kindness that no matter what you do he still loves you he have also crowned you with ten of mercy that he's ready to forgive your sin praise the lord what a crown to wear every day lord thank you for your loving kindness and your turn of mercy and no matter what you do he still loves you he wants you to realize that and stop what you're doing he don't love what you're doing but he loves you amen and that's the reason why his tent immersion never fell because when you're ready to repent he's ready to forgive you praise the lord the only time he would take that crown from your head when you refuse to repent and you die then he would take that crown off your head and he would crown you with joshua but as long as you are in this life you have the crown of tender mercy on your head proverb chapter 12. oh glory be to god amen proverbs 12. i'm still laying foundation i'm digging grounds people proverbs chapter 2 verse 4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that make it ashamed is as rotiness in his bones a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband you think about abigail the bible says never he was just like his name a fool but abigail was a woman of wisdom she was a virtuous woman that was the thing that caught david hot whenever died to choose abigail just to see how so much wisdom adventurous woman she was she stood between her husband and the public praise the lord she ran to david don't mind my husband you'll be you and your man has been so nice to us i brought bread i brought wine and and and and she stole between her husband and the public she never said david you need to kill that man he's too stupid you need to cut his head off that's why he does around here no she never did that because she was a virtuous woman that's the reason why the prophet of god says your power woman is in your vector it's not in your mouth it's in your virtue praise the lord and then i throw something in here first timothy 5 8. [Laughter] a hard working man is a crown to his wife because the scripture said if a man cannot take care of his house he's worse than any feeder he has to be a provider he has to be visionary that word provide is like a seer so a hard working man is a crown because she can rest and knows that he have things under control he have things covered where are we going we are talking about the reward of crowns and some of those crowns that we were in this life praise the lord some of the crowns and most of them we were in this life it was it was it was so amazing to me i was telling last night to just there was something that came open in the scripture when you read it talks about the crown of glory praise the lord it talks about the crown of glory and uh uh thank you for joining it talks about the crown of glory but if you if you watch in the scripture you will realize that the bible never promised us a crown of glory until the chief shepherd appeared it blew my mind last night i was studying i was looking at this i was looking at this subject for over a year now you know just just looking at different things and but it's okay praise the lord amen and uh i got a little bit distracted in my mind but it's fine praise the lord you see because out of the you know this whole coronavirus thing and people loca you know corona in spanish in the latin and all of that and how it means crown and it's just like crown and you know and all of that as much as i appreciate all of those things i'm not the person that just goes into those things amen uh yeah you know i don't i don't i don't fight against it i don't doubt it you know it's just that uh i'm i'm dead with a completely different way i you know a person can preach on coronavirus and show all the crowns and show uh you know is the crown of diseases that have come upon the word and you see the whole world is affected by it and and all of that you know uh it it can be beautiful you can be able to take it out of the scripture you know uh uh there are there are men that are caught like that i mean give it to george martins he would break every letter in coronavirus and show it to you in the scripture he caught like that that's the way he is a very gifted man in topology you know i mean uh i mean uh uh sometimes i don't know how brother george does that but i'm not that way hey man i don't like to venture with our authority even though sometimes i do it [Laughter] but so i i kept i just kept trying to to hold this back and you know and look at it in a different way to be able to bring it more in a way that it will apply to us than to just talk about coronavirus amen coronavirus is now my message praise the lord so uh you know but when i was looking at this it was so beautiful and it gets right in where my my god caught i said oh god see the bible says in in isaiah 42 8 uh god says i will not share my glory with no one and when the bible talks about the crown of glory hebrew chapter uh uh a tool what the bible says you know uh uh what is man you know what is man that thou are mindful of him what the psalmist said paul picked that up in hebrew chapter 2 to show that when david spoke of that in the sand he was thinking about god becoming man the bible says what is man that that was so mindful of him and that thou have crowned him with glory praise the lord but but you you see it as as a reward to the believers it's not promised is not promised until when the chief shepherd appeared that's what peter said in first peter 5 4 when the chief shepherd appeared then now he would take his glory and crown us with faith god will crown us with different things in this life but now with glory because his glory he will share with no man praise the lord yeah man that god has given authoritative domain in a certain area and every child of god must be able to identify places that god has given you control over praise the lord amen now a lot of these wish hunter churches witchcraft and you know all of that we having self sin and the devil to get under control and before we leave from here all three of them will be on our feet the last enemy to get on our feet will be the devil praise the lord jesus settle the same question you have to deal with the safe question all glory be to god when the battle over we shall wear the crown amen and when we sing about that we think about they're in heaven we're talking about every battle you overcome here god crown you with grace for the next battle he crowned you with grace let's look at isaiah chapter 28 verse one then i can get into what i want to speak here now and start looking at some few things i'm just going to read scriptures quote to you this morning yeah we talk about easter you know what the bible said last week we spoke about that how how uh down in easter down in ephraim you know the two places that jeroboam built an altar you know was down in ephraim ephraim is is delta you know uh and and because of that because they took in idolatry and that's the reason why you know that the reward was taken from them amen the athlete reward was taken from them that's why in revelation chapter seven they were not counted in the tribes yeah i read a quote to you where brother braham says your crown can be taken from you the attitude how you deal with things how you deal with things especially when god lays something on your path trusting and believing that you have come to a maturity to be a son of god and to be able to look at that thing as a child of god will look at it you allow it to get under the sleeves of your flesh and you deal with it fleshly well this message is not to make church members is to prepare the people for glory land isaiah 28 verse 1 let's read that amen woe to the crown of pride to the drunkard of ephraim you see in the old testament time right under there after that period of time how ephraim went into idolatry how how the broad idols into into their land and they were crowned with pride the beginning of every fall is pride the beginning of every fall it's proud when a man or a woman is crowned with pride you have just docked your grave with your teeth because your life is going to go in constant descending order no matter how much you try because pride is the beginning of every fall so people life can be crowned with pride some people are crowned with wickedness weakness and we've seen the oil around us weakness all the shooting spreading all the evil that is going on and that's the crowning of this age the crowning of this age is a grounding of wickedness people can be crowned with pride amen they can be crowned i mean that just all sorts of things this let's read the united not entitlement sign one of the the the harmless things to see is a man or a woman constantly complaining constantly complaining complaining about everything everything the sun is too hot the wind is blowing too fast complain about everything the gear in the eye warmer they are complaining how did they pack this thing what does that concern you pick your thing and go i've always thought god keep me from it thou weakens faith complaining weakens fate awakens fate when we complain we are not giving we are not giving ourselves an opportunity to see the supernatural that we can face all the time you know i know as as uh the guests order each one of us we are going to we are going to get uh something happening and something happened now watch this now watch this you got you got to watch this as you get older i lied because the older one other guy says he says he says life is just like you know uh it is just like uh uh you know tissue paper he says when it gets to the end of the road it rolls faster that's an older guy told me like that he said son that's how life is you gotta wash up he says you know as as as we get older we are going to have something happening because you are getting to the weakness of your strength even spiritually you are strong in the spirit but in this body something will happen and something will happen that's the reason why you have to guide your heart and don't let those things happening to crush your spirit because a wounded spirit who can heal something happened and something happened and i know those little things are going to keep accumulating all the digits and it just it just throws you off throw you off yeah i used to be in that church and it did it and and this other and they did i mean and all of those things would just throw you off you got to take your eyes from all men keep your eyes on the lord jesus christ because things are going to happen things will keep happening praise the lord amen oh it looks like when when when that when when when that when the when the lord is blessing the assembly it looks like you see all of these things and you feel happy about it but i don't feel happy i thank the lord but then i have to keep watching because i know things will happen people come from different places different way things were done things will happen and those little things will keep accumulating that as you get older they just got tall but i think one of the most horrible things it's for satan to crown some person's life to be crabby to be crabby all the building is too hot all the building is too cold all the sound is too loud all the sound is all there praise the lord he says for satan to crown some person's life a crowded old man or the krabble or woman i hope i don't get to that place i hope that i can bear it as my burden and get to the spot where uh i i i i want my life crowned with the glory of god no matter what is happening i hope i can bear it i hope i can be patient with people because if you don't take time the devil will crown your life with unforgiving spirits i don't want to even see the ground they walk on you make the ground you made a ground you are walking on you don't want to sit on crown in your life you don't want him crowning your life praise the lord with all with all this uh uh uh uh uh a word you know uh social reality making things making on saying things real to you you don't want the devil crown in your life where you can have more fun on your phone then to actually have fun with real people you get more laughter on your phone and they set you among people you sit down like a stonewalled you don't want the devil crown in your life where you are so crabbit you complain about everything can never be satisfied oh this make us to watch ourself i would rather be crowned in this life with patience than to wait for a gold crown on the other side i'd rather be crowned in this life with the grace of god i would rather look for that crown flashing red light he went into the same line of touch here one of the most miserable thing is to see a man or a woman who's never accepted christ and just laid an old most back church member i don't even know where he get this voice from steve you from kentucky okay you have to tell me even if pronouncing i don't know what it is oh stagnant okay a morse back church member meaner than satan oh my goodness the bible says he's the father of all lives i don't know how can you lie more than satan he's supposed to be the most meanest man i don't know how can you be more meaner than satan but let's go right ahead here it's just dragging the taut amen it's just for us to be able to grab a thought here may not then sit on himself and see how the crab [Music] at all something well i tell you i don't believe in this you know and and uh there's there's uh the horrible crown that satan can crown a life wave it's a groundcheek old woman after 60 or 70 years old with fats hanging on her arm and wrinkle all over her face and her head bump up in four or five different colors praise the lord amen glory be to god now it is it sounds funny as we all can you know uh you know laugh but he's he's dragging to a point right he's trying to make a point he's not really trying to be rude but he's just trying to create a scene for us to be able to grab a point amen you find people in that place i have to have a quote here where brother graham talks about people that are crowned with denominational creeds that hotel they just hold to that denomination of greed as long as i believe the message it's more than their people it's more than that what do you want you want to believe it or not we have made creeds for ourselves that people watch what you say when you speak their language that's my guide but let's get into this a little bit yeah brother branham talking about this and he's describing this scene and talking about this person you know that uh that is having you know just this stagnant uh church member life and uh and it just mean and now you know and yeah crap at everything you know it's it's not a problem for them to swear you know say curse word when they get angry you know just a grouchy old person and uh you get grungy young people too praise the lord you know then they are just like that you know well uh i mean and uh you know he gets down to this place and and you know about their head and and four different different colors you know i thought about basing and uh you know when and you know i know it is kind of sensitive to our our sisters and all of that you know but like brother branham says you know uh i mean uh uh be decent praise the lord amen be decent but all of these things were i mean today you look like a japanese and tomorrow you look korean praise the lord and then you just want a purple hair to just roll in the midst of that i mean it's it's just crazy just be decent so we can be able to identify you all the time don't come to church and i think it's a stranger i'm i'm trying to introduce a stranger when you're supposed to be somebody that is part of this church just be decent that we can identify you i leave it just as that he says in four different colors and and and wearing a pair of shots if that earned the crowning of satan why would a person want to dress like that praise the lord when you need people to carry you all around then let me just let me just let just go ahead oh god give me grace to never complain i want my life lord i want my people life god grant that our life could be crowned no matter if we suffer whatever take place how many turn against me i know this one thing in my life as i get older my friends the stream behind me will soon be running out narrow and narrow praise the lord as i go down the road and i know one thing it will come to pass after the y there will be nobody to come to mean and say ask me an advice praise the lord because we always we always look for the new revelated preacher you know the new guy that is on fire the one who knows me in my in my young days will be gone if i shall lay my friends will get fewer and fewer as i get older now and i know that that some days i have got to die i hope that god never let satan crown me praise the lord as an old crabby indifferent and my wife as an all-nighting woman and your wife or you that way i pray brother that our life will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit love joy long suffering gentleness patience truth faith in the holy ghost these are things that god crowned people life ways that's what god crowned people when the bible said i told your faith that you better brain will bring that out then i'll read it to you now how it's a crown of patient that god gave you he crowned you you are just a young man of faith a young man has spent time with god in prayer you don't have to blow homes about it praise the lord amen it's just something that you have sacrificed to god you have given it to god and if he pleased with with your sacrifice if he pleased with your service and he crowned you that way you have people that are just generous god crowned then god blessed him that way because he knows that he can always use them to be able to minister to others while some i keep looking and i mean they are trying to gather every penny in the dust and this man that god has blessed and crowned with this life does not even have the money it's not the money that god looks for to use is the heart he looks for the heart the man or the woman that has the heart he don't look at your bank account before he use you you look at how much your heart is before the altar how much your heart is giving to him lord i want you i want more of you that's what he looks at oh my satan don't crown our life especially in this time that we are living some people are so crowned they're they're so bitter and so angry that they just sit at the television and fuss switch the television off go to bed they won't do it they just sit right there and fuss you do why are you making noise i ain't even seeing what you're doing switch the television on they can't even see the person on the radio you your voice don't even sound nice shut up i mean they are just crowned that way leave them to themselves they call their own name blatant what are you doing now they get mad with themselves this is a crowning age this is the crowning age laureation is a crowning age he that overcome was said in my throne even as i've overcome that throne is a domain it's a crowning age praise the lord your elderly brother call me in the week a good friend of mine this brother he has retired he's an elderly preacher in his 90s his church you know someone as his pastor in the church but he's a man that have a heart for missions and what he called me for it because he was about to you needing to send some some funds into missions and he really can't get it over to where he wanted to send it so he called me and he asked for one and you know uh i i think i can use i can use you i you know what to do basin you know and all of that you know and and i like i like talking to him i try to talk to him maybe twice a month a good google friend of mine and since i know him he's he has been like that you know you always talk about you know mission work you always talk about sending support to the philippines sending support to different parts of the world and and i'm i'm sitting after we got off the phone i'm sitting there i'm i'm saying oh god oh god he's going to go to his grave like this it's something that he enjoy doing he's not working where he's getting the money from maybe his social security but he just want to do something for the kingdom of god god has crowned his life even in the denomination god used him to sponsor brother branham it's his life god i mean maybe it was what he did that god just crowned him that way and your people can say why i mean what what is he trying to prove he doesn't even have a church what yeah and you can make all the noise about it it does not matter to god that's not one time we will talk when we're not talking about missions i always used to tell him those days before he retired i used to say sir i says every time i talk to you i feel ashamed of myself if a man of your age can be burning and looking for the next soul to save oh i feel ashamed of but i like to talk to him because he he sparked me up oh praise the lord oh praise the lord some of the things that god will cry in the man life is now the things that are then done in the public is now the things that is done before everybody it's not when you are looking for name when you're looking for name god can i associate his name with you but if you don't have a name then he can give you a name praise the lord amen i have four minutes to one teddy i don't feel like stopping but i have to give give you time to think over this because just like i said we can get through this today amen we can get through this today but let me read this present stage of my ministry now is usually such a time as this when man has stayed true to the word and all men has forsaken him until god steps in his defense in defense of that person and crown his ministry praise the lord amen sometimes it's not in the heat of it sometimes it looks like when the person is not even doing nothing god comes back and crown you because of what you did that day that's right what a consolation a consolation is built in the promise of god you know when paul wrote to timothy that was his last letter that he ever wrote that a crown of life awaits me he was in prison waiting to be beheaded i found a good fight when he said that statement i have fought a good fight and the crown of life awaits me he was imprisoned waiting to be beheaded praise the lord but yet you will see the courage he had to be able to encourage the saints and tell timothy let no man despise your youth and then he kept he kept teaching him and and telling him the things that he that he that he's supposed to do to be a good stealer he was comforting the saints praise the lord he was comforting the saints but yet he was waiting to be beheaded he was still right there and says well i've i've i've been here and nope too many times you have not even called me i need your comfort you know so i would die that would soon kill me a lever for you people i preach and nobody send me even an email no text message oh my goodness no that was not paul hey he was not a crabbit old man he was a man that stick to his calling he stick with the words praise the lord an age where it's so hard to find people that want to do things for the lord we only look for things that will be done for us encourage a man to church he gets angry with you praise the lord clearly be to god but you think about it we'll close with this i'll pick it up another time water consolation is built in the promise of god's word no matter what the word says what the word does this net our hope but is built in what is not built in what the world does then i just i just i just pick out these cults and intrude them in like this jesus he was crowned it he crowned it on easter morning on the resurrection that was where his ministry was crowned why because he says i had the power to live my life down and to pick it up again praise the lord it was not a crown where he was sitting and and praised before everybody no it was when he went through his darkest hour elijah he crowned his ministry with a cherish that took him to heaven that was the crown of his ministry that he got angelic ascot [Laughter] there brother branham said i will not allow you to walk like in elijah i will send an escort for you [Laughter] praise the lord the way we think about crown for every eyes to be on us our cheeks up that's not how god thinks about crowning his people daniel god sealed his ministry in the lion's den his ministry was sealed in the lion's den when he came out the king charged the whole world to worship the god of daniel that was the crowning of his ministry your life reaching to the place where is affecting people positively you're talking about the lord and encouraging them to church you're giving them an invitation you don't want to make a church memo out of them you just you're just telling them that's why we can be a witness because i mean we we are so consumed and involved about ourselves jacob from us as a planter a her to the prince of god when he walked out the next morning with his ministry crown he was crowned as a prince but yet he was sleeping but god has crowned his ministry by breaking his legs god's servants that stay true to the word that god sealed their ministry with a crown in time that would be this time in our life where god will do something special and see i've seen the longing of my son see the love he had for me and i see the sacrifice i see the way that he have supported the work of god the ministry i've seen the life of dedication that he thought a time of devotion thou come and crown him with grace that the things that we're looking so big and it looks like the soul matter you realize oh my goodness thank you jesus the devil can come and throw things in and break everything around he said glory be to god you give it and you take it away blessed be the name of the lord he can come and start throwing everything down making this to happen you say thank you jesus you are in control praise the lord that's why brother branham says god can get a man to a place that the devil can look for him and can never find him because he saw hate in god that everything that the devil destroys his way just make him to sin much louder he just go another key higher glory thank you jesus not just the devil just oh my goodness it's time to possess paul says i bring this body on a subjection at least i preach and become a castaway i subject myself to the word be it unto me according to your word lord i rather have the crown of grace in this life thank you love for the golden crown on the other side go crown my life with passion cry my life with thanksgiving let me be thankful because we're living in an age where man is unthankful musicians you can come verb i'm talking here then saying i hope he will crown my ministry with this of letting me to take the cloth of the word and to dress his bride in the clothes of the word for his righteousness i hope he will crown me and let me stand there on that day saying behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the word there are so many hills to climb up wall strain sometimes it gets harder but the one that
