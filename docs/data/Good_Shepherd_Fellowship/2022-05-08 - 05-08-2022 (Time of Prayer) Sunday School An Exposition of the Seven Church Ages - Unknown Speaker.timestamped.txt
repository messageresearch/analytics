[2:28] so
[2:30] [Music]
[2:42] so
[2:44] [Music]
[4:34] so
[4:45] is as many as i love
[4:48] in the greek the emphasis is upon the
[4:49] personal pronoun i
[4:52] he does not say as many would feel he
[4:54] should say
[4:55] as many as love me
[4:57] no sir
[4:58] we must never try to make jesus the
[5:00] object of human love in this verse no
[5:04] it is the many that are the loved ones
[5:06] of god
[5:07] it is his love in question not ours so
[5:11] once again we find ourselves glorying in
[5:13] his salvation his purpose and his plan
[5:16] and we are confirmed even more strongly
[5:18] in the truth of the doctrine of the
[5:19] sovereignty of god
[5:21] even as he said in romans 9 13
[5:25] jacob have i loved
[5:27] does it now obtain that since he loved
[5:29] only the many
[5:31] is he therefore in a state of
[5:32] complacency awaiting the love of those
[5:35] who have not drawn nigh him
[5:37] by no means is this so
[5:39] for he declared also in romans 9 13
[5:43] he saw have i hated
[5:45] and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls
[5:47] out
[5:48] for the children not being born neither
[5:50] having done any good or evil that the
[5:53] purpose of god according to election
[5:55] might stand
[5:56] not of works but of him that calleth
[5:59] this love is elective love
[6:02] it is his love for his elect
[6:04] and his love for them is apart from
[6:06] human merit for it says that the purpose
[6:09] of god stands in election which is
[6:11] exactly opposite to works or anything
[6:13] man has in himself
[6:15] because
[6:16] before the children were born
[6:18] he had already said
[6:20] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[6:24] and now he says to his own as many as i
[6:27] love i rebuke and chasten
[6:29] to rebuke is to reprove
[6:31] to reprove is to expose with a view to
[6:34] correction
[6:35] json does not mean to punish it means to
[6:38] discipline because the subject's
[6:40] amendment is in mind
[6:42] this is exactly what we find in hebrews
[6:44] 12 5-11
[6:46] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[6:48] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[6:51] my son despise not thou the chastening
[6:53] of the lord nor faint when thou art
[6:56] rebuked of him
[6:57] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[7:00] and scourgeth every son whom he
[7:01] receiveth
[7:03] if ye endure chastening god dealeth with
[7:05] you as with sons
[7:07] for what son is he whom the father
[7:08] chasteneth not
[7:10] but if he be without chastisement
[7:12] whereof all are partakers then you are
[7:15] bastards and not sons
[7:17] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[7:19] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[7:21] them reverence
[7:22] shall we not much rather be in
[7:24] subjection unto the father of spirits
[7:26] and live
[7:27] for they verily for a few days chastened
[7:29] us after their own pleasure
[7:31] but he for our prophet that we might be
[7:34] partakers of his holiness
[7:36] now no chastening for the present
[7:38] seemeth to be joyous but grievous
[7:41] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[7:43] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[7:44] them which are exercised thereby
[7:48] herein is now set forth the love of god
[7:51] he desired in love a family of his own a
[7:54] family of sons sons like himself
[7:57] there before him lies all mankind as one
[8:00] lump of clay
[8:02] out of that same lump he will now make
[8:04] vessels unto honor and unto dishonor
[8:07] the choosing will be his own choosing
[8:10] then those chosen ones born of his
[8:12] spirit will be trained to conform to his
[8:14] image and their walk
[8:16] he reproves with all long-suffering and
[8:18] gentleness and mercy
[8:20] he chastens with nail-scarred hands
[8:23] sometimes this potter must take the
[8:25] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[8:27] break it down in order that he may
[8:28] rebuild it exactly as he desires it
[8:31] but it is love
[8:33] that is his love
[8:35] another way of his love there is not
[8:37] there cannot
[8:38] be oh little flock do not fear
[8:42] this age is fast closing
[8:44] as it does those tears will be bound
[8:46] together and as a threefold court is not
[8:48] easily broken they will have a
[8:50] tremendous threefold strength of
[8:52] political physical and spiritual
[8:54] satanical power
[8:56] and they will seek to destroy the bride
[8:58] of christ
[8:59] she will suffer but she will endure
[9:02] fear not those things that are coming
[9:03] upon the earth for he who loved his own
[9:06] loveth them unto the end
[9:08] john 13 1
[9:11] be zealous and repent
[9:14] now this false church has zeal make no
[9:16] mistake about that
[9:18] her zeal has literally been that of the
[9:20] jews john 2 17
[9:23] the zeal of thine house have eaten me up
[9:26] but it is a wrong zeal
[9:29] it is for the house of their own
[9:30] building
[9:31] it is for their own creeds dogmas
[9:33] organizations their own righteousness
[9:36] they have put the word out for their own
[9:38] ideas
[9:40] they deposed the holy ghost and made man
[9:42] into leaders
[9:43] they have put aside eternal life as a
[9:45] person and make it good works or even
[9:47] church conformity rather than good works
[9:50] but god is calling for another zeal
[9:53] it is the zeal to cry
[9:55] i am wrong
[9:57] now who is going to say that he is wrong
[10:00] what is it that all these denominations
[10:02] are based upon
[10:03] the claim to originality and that of god
[10:06] the claim that they are right
[10:09] now they all cannot be right
[10:11] in fact not one of them is right
[10:14] they are white sepulchers full of dead
[10:16] men's bones they have no life they have
[10:19] no vindication
[10:20] god has never made himself known in any
[10:23] organization
[10:24] they say they are right because they are
[10:26] the ones that are saying it but saying
[10:28] it does not make it so
[10:30] they need the vindicated thus saith the
[10:33] lord of god and they don't have it
[10:37] now let me say this here
[10:39] i don't believe that god is calling only
[10:41] to the false church to repent
[10:44] in this verse he is talking to his elect
[10:46] they have some repenting to do too
[10:49] many of his children are still in those
[10:50] false churches
[10:52] they are those of whom it speaks in
[10:53] ephesians 5 14.
[10:56] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[10:59] the dead and christ shall give thee
[11:00] light
[11:02] to be asleep is not to be dead
[11:04] these are sleeping amongst the dead
[11:06] they are out there in the dead
[11:08] denominations they are floating along
[11:10] with them
[11:11] god cries out wake up repent of your
[11:14] folly
[11:15] here they are lending their influence
[11:17] giving their time and their money
[11:19] actually their very lives to these
[11:20] antichrist organizations
[11:23] and all the while thinking it is all
[11:25] right
[11:26] they need to repent they must repent
[11:29] they need to have a change of mind and
[11:30] turn toward truth
[11:33] yes this is the age that most needs to
[11:36] repent
[11:37] but will it
[11:38] will it bring back the word
[11:40] will it again enthrone the holy spirit
[11:42] in men's lives
[11:44] will it again revere jesus as the only
[11:46] savior
[11:47] i say not
[11:49] for the next verse reveals the
[11:51] astounding and shocking truth of the
[11:52] close of this age
[11:56] christ outside the church
[11:58] revelation 3
[12:00] 20-22
[12:02] behold i stand at the door and knock
[12:05] if any man hear my voice and open the
[12:07] door i will come into him and will sup
[12:09] with him and he with me
[12:11] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[12:13] sit with me in my throne
[12:15] even as i also overcame and am set down
[12:18] with my father in his throne
[12:20] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[12:22] the spirit saith unto the churches
[12:26] now there is a great deal of confusion
[12:27] over this verse because so many personal
[12:30] workers use it in personal evangelism as
[12:33] though jesus were at the hearts door of
[12:34] every sinner knocking for admission
[12:37] it would then be said that if the sinner
[12:39] opened the door the lord would come in
[12:42] but this verse is not talking to
[12:43] individual sinners
[12:45] this whole message has a summation as
[12:47] does every message in every age
[12:50] in verse 22 it says he that hath an ear
[12:53] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[12:55] the churches
[12:57] so this is the message to the church of
[12:58] the last age
[13:00] this is the condition of the laodicean
[13:02] church as its end nears it is not a
[13:05] personal message to one person
[13:07] it is the spirit telling us where jesus
[13:09] is
[13:10] christ has left the church
[13:13] is this not the logical result or end if
[13:15] the word is put aside for creed the holy
[13:18] spirit deposed for popes bishops
[13:20] presidents counselors etc and the savior
[13:23] set aside for a works program or church
[13:26] joining or some type of conformity to a
[13:28] church system
[13:29] what more can be done against him
[13:31] this is the apostasy this is the falling
[13:34] away
[13:35] this is the open door to antichrist for
[13:38] if one came in his father's name jesus
[13:41] and was not received but rejected then
[13:43] there will come another with his own
[13:45] name
[13:46] liar a pretender and him they will
[13:48] receive john 5 43
[13:52] the man of sin that son of perdition
[13:54] will take over
[13:56] matthew 24 mentioned signs in the
[13:58] heavens concerning this last day just
[14:00] before jesus comes
[14:02] i wonder if you noticed such a sign
[14:04] recently fulfilled as to portray the
[14:06] very truth we have been discussing
[14:09] that truth is that jesus has been
[14:11] steadily pushed aside until in the last
[14:13] age he is pushed outside the church
[14:16] recall that in the first age it was
[14:18] almost a full orbed church of truth
[14:21] yet there was a little error called the
[14:23] deeds of the nicolaitans that kept the
[14:25] circle from being full
[14:27] then in the next stage more darkness
[14:29] crept in until the ball of light glowed
[14:32] less
[14:32] and darkness covered more of the circle
[14:35] in the third age it was eclipsed still
[14:37] more and in the fourth age which was the
[14:39] dark ages the light had all but gone
[14:43] now think on this
[14:44] the church shines in the reflected light
[14:46] of christ
[14:48] he is the sun
[14:49] the church is the moon
[14:51] thus this orb of light is the moon
[14:54] it had decreased from almost a full moon
[14:56] in the first age to a sliver in the
[14:58] fourth age
[14:59] but in the fifth age it began to grow
[15:02] in the sixth it took a great step of
[15:05] growth forward
[15:06] in part of the seventh age it was still
[15:08] growing when suddenly it stopped short
[15:11] and waned to almost a nothingness so
[15:13] that instead of light it was the
[15:15] blackness of apostasy
[15:17] and at the end of the age it had ceased
[15:18] to shine for darkness had taken over
[15:21] christ was now outside the church
[15:24] here is the sign in the sky
[15:26] the last eclipse of the moon was a total
[15:28] eclipse
[15:29] it waned to a total darkness in seven
[15:31] stages
[15:33] in the seventh stage the total darkness
[15:35] came as the pope of rome paul vi
[15:38] went to palestine to make a holy tour of
[15:40] jerusalem
[15:41] he was the first pope to ever go to
[15:43] jerusalem
[15:44] the pope is named paul the sixth
[15:47] paul was the first messenger and this
[15:49] man goes by that name
[15:51] notice it is the sixth or the number of
[15:53] man this is more than a coincidence
[15:56] and when he went to jerusalem the moon
[15:58] or the church went into total darkness
[16:00] this is it
[16:01] this is the end
[16:03] this generation shall not pass away
[16:05] until all be fulfilled
[16:07] even so lord jesus come quickly
[16:10] now we can see why there were two vines
[16:13] one true and one false
[16:15] now we can see why abraham had two sons
[16:18] one after the flesh
[16:19] that persecuted isaac and one after
[16:22] promise
[16:23] now we can see how that out of the same
[16:25] parents two boys came forth as twins
[16:28] one knowing and loving the things of god
[16:31] and the other knowing much of the same
[16:33] truth but not of the same spirit
[16:35] and hence persecuted the child that was
[16:37] elect
[16:38] god did not reprobate for the sake of
[16:40] reprobation
[16:42] he reprobated for the sake of the elect
[16:44] elect cannot persecute elect
[16:47] elect cannot harm elect it is the
[16:50] reprobates that persecute and destroy
[16:52] the elect
[16:53] oh those reprobates are religious they
[16:55] are smart
[16:57] they are of the cane line the serpent
[16:59] seed
[17:00] they build their babbles they build
[17:01] their cities they build their empires
[17:04] and all the while calling on god
[17:06] they hate the true seed and they will do
[17:09] all they can even in the name of the
[17:10] lord to destroy god's elect ones
[17:13] but they are needed
[17:15] what is the chaff to the wheat no chaff
[17:18] no wheat
[17:19] but at the end what happens to the chaff
[17:22] it is burned with fire unquenchable and
[17:25] the wheat
[17:26] where is it
[17:27] it is gathered in his garner
[17:29] it is where he is oh elect of god beware
[17:34] study closely
[17:36] be careful
[17:37] work out your salvation with fear and
[17:39] trembling
[17:40] rely upon god and be strong in his might
[17:43] your adversary the devil is even now
[17:45] going about like a roaring lion seeking
[17:47] whom he may devour
[17:49] watch unto prayer and be steadfast
[17:52] this is the end time
[17:54] both the true and false vine are coming
[17:56] into maturity but before the wheat
[17:58] matures those ripened tears must be
[18:01] bound for the burning
[18:03] see they are all joining the world
[18:04] council of churches that is the binding
[18:08] soon the garnering of the wheat will
[18:09] come
[18:10] but right now the two spirits are at
[18:12] work in two vines come out from among
[18:14] the tares
[18:16] start to overcome that you may be
[18:17] considered praiseworthy for your lord
[18:19] and fit to reign and rule with him
[18:23] the overcomers throne
[18:26] revelation 3 21
[18:29] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[18:31] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[18:33] overcame and am set down with my father
[18:36] in his throne
[18:38] now what are we to overcome
[18:40] that is the normal question to ask here
[18:43] but that is not the actual thought of
[18:44] this verse for it is not so much what we
[18:47] are to overcome but how we are to
[18:49] overcome
[18:50] now this is logical for does it matter
[18:52] much what we are to overcome as long as
[18:54] we know how we can overcome
[18:57] a quick look at those scriptures which
[18:59] involve the lord jesus overcoming will
[19:01] bring out the truth of this proposition
[19:04] in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of
[19:07] the devil he overcame the personal
[19:09] temptations of satan by the word and by
[19:11] the word only
[19:13] in each of the three major trials that
[19:15] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[19:17] of the garden of eden the lust of the
[19:19] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[19:22] of life jesus overcame by the word
[19:25] eve fell to the personal temptation of
[19:27] satan by failing to use the word
[19:30] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[19:32] word
[19:34] but jesus overcame by the word
[19:36] and right now let me say that this is
[19:38] the only way to be an overcomer
[19:41] also it is the only way that you can
[19:42] know if you are overcoming because that
[19:45] word can't fail
[19:47] now notice again how jesus overcame the
[19:50] world systems of religion when he was
[19:52] repeatedly badgered by the theologians
[19:54] of his day he constantly applied the
[19:57] word
[19:58] he spake only what the father gave him
[20:00] to speak
[20:01] there was not a time when the world was
[20:02] not utterly confused by his wisdom for
[20:05] it was the wisdom of god
[20:07] in his own personal life contending with
[20:09] himself he overcame by obedience to the
[20:12] word of god
[20:14] in hebrews 5 7 it says
[20:16] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[20:18] offered up prayers and supplications
[20:20] with strong crying and tears unto him
[20:23] that was able to save him from death and
[20:25] was heard in that he feared
[20:28] though he were a son
[20:29] yet learned he obedience by the things
[20:31] which he suffered
[20:33] and being made perfect he became the
[20:35] author of eternal salvation unto all
[20:37] them that obey him
[20:39] what was he obedient to
[20:41] the word of god
[20:43] now then there will not be one person
[20:45] who will sit in the throne of the lord
[20:46] jesus christ unless he has been living
[20:48] that word
[20:49] your prayers your fastings your
[20:51] repentances
[20:53] no matter what you present to god
[20:55] none of that will gain you the privilege
[20:57] of sitting in that throne
[20:58] it will be granted only to the word
[21:00] bride as the throne of the king is
[21:03] shared with the queen because she is
[21:04] united to him so only they who are of
[21:07] that word even as he is of that word
[21:09] will share that throne
[21:12] remember we have shown clearly all
[21:13] through the ages that even as adam and
[21:16] eve fell because they left the word so
[21:18] the ephesian age fell by turning
[21:20] slightly from the word
[21:22] until with every age continuing to turn
[21:24] away we have a final repudiation of the
[21:27] word by the world church system this
[21:30] laodicean age ends in a blackout of the
[21:32] word
[21:33] thereby causing a departure of the lord
[21:35] from the midst
[21:36] he stands outside calling to his own who
[21:39] follow him by obedience to the word
[21:41] after a short and powerful demonstration
[21:43] of the spirit this little hunted and
[21:45] persecuted group will go to be with
[21:47] jesus
[21:49] the consummation of the gentile ages
[21:53] this age is the last of the seven church
[21:55] ages
[21:56] what began in the first or ephesian age
[21:59] must and will come to full fruition and
[22:01] harvest in the last laodicean age
[22:04] the two vines will yield their final
[22:06] fruit
[22:07] the two spirits will terminate their
[22:08] manifestation in each of their final
[22:10] destinations
[22:12] the sowing the watering the growing is
[22:15] all over
[22:16] summer is ended
[22:17] the sickle is now thrust into the
[22:19] harvest
[22:21] in verses 15 to 18 which we have just
[22:23] studied lies the true picture of the
[22:25] ripened false vine false spirit false
[22:28] church people
[22:30] i know thy works that thou art neither
[22:33] cold nor hot
[22:34] i would thou art cold or hot
[22:37] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[22:39] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[22:41] out of my mouth
[22:43] because thou sayest i am rich and
[22:45] increased with goods and have need of
[22:47] nothing
[22:48] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[22:50] and miserable and poor and blind and
[22:52] naked
[22:53] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[22:56] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[22:59] white raiment that thou mayest be
[23:01] clothed
[23:02] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[23:04] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[23:06] eyes have that thou mayest see
[23:09] no words ever spelled out a more bitter
[23:11] denunciation and no proud and arrogant
[23:14] religious people ever deserved it more
[23:16] yet in verse 21
[23:19] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[23:21] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[23:24] overcame and am set down with my father
[23:26] in his throne
[23:28] we find the true vine true spirit true
[23:31] church people exalted to the very throne
[23:33] of god with the highest compliment ever
[23:35] paid to a humble steadfast spiritual
[23:38] group
[23:40] the words of john the baptist who so
[23:42] accurately set forth the christ in
[23:43] relationship to the true and false
[23:45] church now comes to pass
[23:48] matthew 3 11-12
[23:52] i indeed baptize you with water unto
[23:54] repentance
[23:55] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[23:57] than i
[23:58] whose shoes i am not worthy to bear
[24:01] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[24:03] and with fire
[24:04] whose fan is in his hand and he will
[24:07] thoroughly purge his floor and gather
[24:09] his wheat into the garner but he will
[24:11] burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
[24:14] christ the great harvester is now
[24:16] reaping the fruit of the earth
[24:18] he gathers the wheat into the garner by
[24:20] coming for his own and receiving them
[24:22] forever unto himself
[24:24] then he returns to destroy the wicked
[24:26] with fire unquenchable
[24:29] the mystery of the tares and wheat of
[24:31] matthew 13 24-30 is now also fulfilled
[24:36] another parable put he forth unto them
[24:38] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[24:41] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[24:43] field
[24:44] but while men slept his enemy came and
[24:46] sowed tears among the wheat and went his
[24:48] way
[24:49] but when the blade was sprung up and
[24:51] brought forth fruit
[24:53] then appeared the tares also
[24:55] so the servants of the householder came
[24:57] and said unto him
[24:58] sird it's not thou sow good seed in thy
[25:01] field
[25:02] from once then hath it tares
[25:04] he said unto them an enemy hath done
[25:07] this
[25:08] the servants said unto him
[25:10] wilt thou then that we go and gather
[25:12] them up
[25:13] but he said
[25:14] nay
[25:15] lest while you gather up the tears ye
[25:17] root up also the wheat with them
[25:19] let both grow together until the harvest
[25:22] and in the time of harvest i will say to
[25:23] the reapers gather ye together first the
[25:26] tares and bind them in bundles to burn
[25:28] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[25:32] the wheat and the tears which from the
[25:33] first age until now have grown side by
[25:36] side are harvested
[25:38] what nicaea set out to accomplish has
[25:40] finally come to pass
[25:42] with all the might of organization the
[25:44] false church turns from any vestige of
[25:47] truth and with political might
[25:49] reinforces herself with state backing
[25:51] and sets out to eradicate forever the
[25:53] true believer
[25:55] but just when she is about to accomplish
[25:57] her cowardly plot the weed is gathered
[25:59] into the garner
[26:01] no longer will the wheat and tears grow
[26:02] side by side
[26:04] no longer will the tares receive the
[26:06] blessing of god because of the presence
[26:08] of the wheat for the wheat will be gone
[26:10] and the wrath of god will be poured out
[26:12] into the sixth seal which will end in
[26:15] the utter destruction of the wicked
[26:18] now i said a moment ago that the false
[26:20] vine came into full fruition in this age
[26:22] her fruit would mature and ripen that is
[26:25] correct
[26:26] this evil spirited church full of
[26:28] iniquity will be revealed as the mustard
[26:31] seed that grew into a tree wherein
[26:33] lodged the fowls of the air
[26:35] at her head will be the antichrist the
[26:37] mystery of iniquity
[26:39] all this is true
[26:41] and if this is true then it must also be
[26:43] true that the bride church will mature
[26:46] and her ripeness shall be an
[26:47] identification with her lord by means of
[26:49] the word
[26:51] and her head who will come to her is the
[26:53] mystery of godliness which indeed is
[26:56] christ
[26:57] and as the false church with all cunning
[26:59] and diabolical power made up of
[27:01] political force physical force and
[27:03] demons of darkness come against this
[27:05] true vine
[27:07] the true vine with the fullness of the
[27:08] spirit and the word will do the very
[27:10] acts of power that jesus did
[27:13] then as she nears her headstone becoming
[27:15] like him through the word
[27:17] jesus will come that the bride and groom
[27:19] may be forever united as one
[27:22] already the visible manifestations of
[27:24] what i have been telling you are seen
[27:26] all around us
[27:27] the ecumenical move of the tears is
[27:29] factual
[27:30] but also it is a fact that the prophet
[27:33] for the last age must be bringing forth
[27:35] a message from god that will forerun the
[27:37] second coming of the lord
[27:39] for by his message will the hearts of
[27:40] the children be turned back to the
[27:42] pentecostal fathers
[27:44] and with the restoration of the word
[27:46] will come the restoration of the power
[27:49] what crucial times are these in which we
[27:51] live
[27:52] how careful we must be that we remain
[27:54] true to this word and not take from it
[27:56] or add to it
[27:58] for he who would speak where god has not
[28:00] spoken makes him a liar
[28:02] what i have particularly in mind is this
[28:05] about the turn of the century the hunger
[28:07] for god that was generated in the
[28:09] philadelphian age brought a cry for the
[28:11] spirit of god
[28:13] and when the cry was answered by god
[28:15] sending forth manifestation in tongues
[28:17] interpretation and prophecy a group
[28:20] immediately and most contrary to the
[28:22] word drew up a doctrine that tongues was
[28:24] the evidence of being baptized with the
[28:26] holy ghost
[28:27] tongues were far from evidence they were
[28:30] manifestation but not evidence
[28:33] the falsity of the doctrine can not only
[28:34] be seen by a lack of scripture to
[28:36] substantiate it but those who subscribe
[28:39] to the doctrine immediately organized on
[28:41] the basis of the doctrine
[28:43] proving that they were not in the truth
[28:44] as they would have people believe
[28:47] oh it looked good
[28:48] it looked like the return of pentecost
[28:51] but it proved it wasn't
[28:53] it could not be for it organized
[28:55] that is death not life
[28:57] it looked so close to the real that
[28:59] multitudes were deceived
[29:01] now if it wasn't the genuine what was it
[29:04] it was the husk the chaff
[29:07] in the green soft sheath form it looked
[29:09] like it was the real thing
[29:11] but as one can go into the field and see
[29:13] what looks exactly like wheat and yet is
[29:15] only the husk for the wheat seed has not
[29:18] yet formed
[29:19] so this was but the soft shell that
[29:21] looked like the real grain yet to come
[29:24] the original wheat seed of pentecost was
[29:26] to come back in the last age
[29:28] it had been buried at nicaea
[29:30] it sent up a shoot at sardis it grew a
[29:33] tassel at philadelphia and it was to
[29:35] mature at laodicea
[29:37] but it could not be back to the original
[29:39] until the word was restored
[29:41] the prophet had not yet come upon the
[29:43] scene
[29:44] but now according to the time wherein we
[29:46] stand in the laodicean age the prophet
[29:48] messenger of revelation 10 7 must
[29:51] already be in the land
[29:53] once more thus saith the lord must be
[29:56] here ready to be manifested with
[29:58] infallible vindication
[30:00] thus is the true seed already maturing
[30:03] and then the harvest
[30:05] harvest time
[30:07] yes harvest time
[30:08] the two vines that grew together and
[30:11] intertwined their branches are now to be
[30:12] separated
[30:14] the fruits of those vines which were at
[30:16] such variants will be gathered into
[30:18] separate garners
[30:19] the two spirits will go to their
[30:21] separate destinations
[30:23] now it is time to heed the final call
[30:24] that comes only to the wheat bride
[30:27] come out of her my people that ye be not
[30:30] partakers of her sins and that ye wheat
[30:33] receive not her tares plagues the great
[30:37] tribulation of the sixth seal and
[30:38] matthew 24
[30:42] the last warning of the spirit
[30:45] [Music]
[30:56] so
[31:10] [Music]
[31:37] do
[31:49] you
