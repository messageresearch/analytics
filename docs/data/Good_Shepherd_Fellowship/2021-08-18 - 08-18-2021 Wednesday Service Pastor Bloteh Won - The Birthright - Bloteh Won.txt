[Applause] [Music] praise the lord amen you know one of our problem here is the other just like we said and constantly say we have to realize that you're not singing to me amen we are singing to the lord amen and let's express ourselves you don't have to be afraid i mean we there is no uh voice concept of voice tests that we have to be singing manifest you don't want your voice to be heard so they can't say you spoil the song and i mean everybody's singing in your stomach i mean this is a song of expression it's a song of worship you know we must be able to because it looks like the music is louder than the voice of the people the music is just to help us [Music] praise the lord let's try it one more time glorify the lord with me [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] is [Music] with me forever taste and see that the lord is good and [Applause] that the see is [Music] praise the lord amen thank you musicians we might start a choir practice tonight well the lord bless you let's take our bibles genesis chapter 25 i really don't know if i will be able to go into this but as we read the scripture yet i will i will i will share with you why i'm going into this tonight praise the lord amen amen are we together verse 23 genesis 25 23 and the law said unto her to rebecca two nations i in that womb and two mana of people shall be separated from the bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the other shall self the younger praise the lord and when her days was to be delivered when her day and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb praise the lord then let's drop down a little bit verse 27 and the boys growed in either and ether was a corning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and isaac loved easter because he did eat of his venison but rebecca loved jacob and jacob saw pottage and israel came from the field and he was faint and israel said to jacob femin i pray thee with the same rare party for i'm faint therefore was his name called edom and jacob said cell mean this did that birthright and ether said behold i am at the point of death and and what prophet shall this birthright do to me and jacob said sword to me this day and his word unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob amen let's read the last verse then jacob gave easter bread and pottage of lentil and he did eat and drink and rolls up and went his way does easter despise his birthright that's that's one of the words that kind of underline his action let's pray together heavenly father lord jesus i just pray that lord you will come in and help if there is anyone that needs help tonight i'm the one i mean in need of of help i'm in need of prayer tonight lord just listening to a message you followed around around the birthright and a lot of things so god on my mind that father-in-law we just want to take this subject tonight father-lording and be able to bring light onto what we were talking about last week and and just give us grace of father lord precious savior uh our heart lord is to is to be able to bring christ out of the pages of the bible father and no man can do their lord father because only you can do it you were the only one that was worthy to take the balkan to lose the seals thereof let let it be a losing tonight lord because we we've been taught by your word that the loosening of the seals were the releasing of christ to the people come father release yourself tonight in the form of god father of teaching in the form father lord of preaching of rebuke in the form of healing in the form of strength oh god we just prayed we the father we would benefit lord from the supernatural effect of your presence we pray for the bride of jesus christ everywhere almighty god we are conscious that law there are areas law where some of your children cannot even properly meet together we still remembering them of god father and we are stay conscious lord that in times like this of father the burden of looking for lost souls have not gone away from the heart of men or god that are burdened so they are missionaries out there we pray that you watch over them father dear god precious lord we just we just want to pray to god father for every need that is in the house of faith every need of god that is in the body of jesus christ oh god we lift it up to you tonight precious lord it can be in the darkest part of the world you know where your children are father and we pray that you just reach unto them tonight dear god and but as you are blessing your people remember us tonight and speak to us in a way that only you can in jesus name amen amen the lord bless you tonight you may have your seed amen let's go see each and every one of you and uh and it's good to have our dear sister with us tonight praise the lord so uh i just just from the reading tonight you'll get an idea that i want to i want to talk a little bit on the birthright but the reason why i want to talk on the birthright i might not get into it tonight but the reason why i want to talk on the birthright is to go back to what we've been talking about okay okay like i always do i think i did the same thing here brother hilary wrote a prayer prayer burning and experiencing pain in his stomach and he want us to just remember him and let just pray father we we we know lord god even if we did forget just as our brother took the pain you remember lord what his need was but father lord garden and and as we are human lord we never want anyone to feel that their need is despised so we left our brother up to you we want to thank you father for even helping him to lead a son on a painful stomach but we pray that you will touch him oh god father and touch all of your children lord that are having one pain or another in their body tonight we love you we appreciate you father in jesus name amen amen praise the lord praise the lord okay i forget what i was saying but what i was saying is it does not matter amen the word matters so we will just trust the lord tonight and he will help us and uh uh like i said on sunday that was studying on uh the attributes of god if we actually decide to go in and just talk about the attributes of god is a subject that we could preach until we go in the rapture and then uh since we'll be under the blood in the millennium maybe we could still be doing some preaching there praise the lord amen you know i don't know if we should we should make it a subject about preaching in the millennium you know but one thing i noticed that we will we will be worshipping in the millennium amen praise the lord we will be we will be worshiping in the millennium we will still be honored the blood so uh uh [Music] so whichever way the lamb would be the light you know the line would be the minister so we will be learning more about him and we will still be in in a discovery state in the learning stage so we will not be in that place where we will know everything no eternity will bring that to us not the millennium praise the lord amen so uh but i mean like i said talking about the attributes of god is something that we could talk right into internet that's what i wanted to say so uh but again just to back up and to and to kind of uh cap ourselves the the full knowledge of god that attribute was one of the the the attributes that many scholars you know uh in studying that subject you know there were many controversies around it you know because when you talk about full knowledge uh it you know the the the webster dictionary or the dictionary meaning will point you to you know knowing something beforehand and uh you know and there are other some uh deep definitions there but what we were trying to deal with is that point of teaching were uh uh you know many of us uh were taught about god for knowledge in a sense of where you know he knew that we will we will want to be safe and because of that he saved us you know or godfall knew that we will love him and he predestinated us that was a great line of teaching you know in in ages gone by and which of course it does not rightly center with the word there is a truth there but it is not fully balanced amen so as we look through the the the quote uh and the message in the scripture we realized that it was what god projected amen it was what god projected you know everything came out of him without him there was nothing praise the lord amen so uh brother branham we read a little bit on that on sunday where brother branham took uh uh from uh the message you know uh uh uh who is this machisa deck and and and then he dwelt on that a little bit and make us to know you know how the self-existing god and and then we went right into into god dwelling alone and and that is also another place to work is greatly misunderstood you know brother branham says you know you know being alone with god you know or a man standing alone you know uh you can you are you can never amount to anything until you stand alone so that language standalone has made many people to think that they can become independent believers and work their way into the rapture you know you know in a walk with god you know he was the only one man that could fulfill that scripture the only one man that could fulfill that scripture if there was any other man to fulfill a a one-man walk with god's scripture it would corrupt the scripture that says we are baptized into one body the only one man that can do that is the one man with many members body you see so that was where i tried to go on on sunday talking about elohim dwelling alone you know with his attributes and and just just trying to talk about that dwelling alone and and over and over if you if you check if you if you really started the message you would see every time brother branham talks about being alone is always being alone with god praise the lord it's always been alone with god and when you talk about being alone with god you have to bring it in the context of the word right praise the lord amen if you say you are well i'm alone with god and and but yet the word of god says do not forsake the assembling of the believers praise the lord amen spoken word is the original see brother branham says life comes through the body cut this hand from my body it will not be a life for any member of your body to live it has to be attached to their body life comes through the body so that was one of the reason why we went down we went down and you know me when i get dead it becomes a rabbit trail we start going and it's hard to find the end but as i was as i was really studying the subject i was looking into the subject it's something that i've looked into you know years back it was just because brother peterson read that quote from uh from adoption so it just it just triggered that thing i mean i say i have to pick this up and deal with it amen there was nothing wrong with the code there was nothing wrong with the service the word was just in place i just fed as a pastor i need to take up that subject and let's just lick the honey that is on the rock that's all i was doing praise the lord so don't don't misunderstand me and think that i'm correcting anything i'm not correcting anything and sometimes when you take this and people think well maybe you want to correct the prophet the prophet said it i believe it yeah the prophet said it but he even said it it's from his own word right amen brother branham said we read here on on sunday he says here if i will be able to find it now talking about a thought a tortoise press is the word but it it has to be a thought first so it's god's attribute then it becomes a top then the word notice though who have those who have uh tonight internal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel-style cherubin anything else that's in tenor and if you have internal life you always was not your being not your being not your body not this flesh you have always been but in a sea form that comes back to the sea world so if we start to talk about sun ambassador you will see why the scripture deals with sun ambassador because son comes from the seed word that's the reason why a song will not argue with the word he will take correction from the word because that's where his origin is a man can keep this body this being around the world in church and never take correction we read that to you before brother branham she is not this body that is predestinated right it's the thought that god heard of you and then when you look in the scripture also and you and you and you deal with uh uh let's let's take a few scriptures here tonight i'm i'm just all over the place amen i'm just all over the place tonight are we together praise the lord amen amen me know let me do something we read one scripture and i'm i'm going in another way tonight uh let's look at first period chapter one first peter chapter one now what i want to what i want to establish when you actually study it unfold on full knowledge you will realize every word that the bible talks about it is that it is not the act of the believer that the bible referred to as being uh uh has been god having full knowledge of not the act of what you would do but the person amen is not the act so that's what this whole subject comes back to for you to say that god predestinated you or elected you because he he knew that you will love him is an act is not the act he predestinated you because you were part of him now for what you will do not the art praise the lord are we together so that that is one of the call that is that is right there when you when you study the scripture then you study the message the thing about it did is that we must realize as as privileged people that we are god never sent us a theologian brother branham was not a theologian brother branham was a prophet and and the work of a prophet is to speak the word of god in sea form the prophet speak those words there's a sea of internal life in that word amen he might not pronounce his words right his expression might not be right but you see when you follow the thought of what he's saying you will realize that he's coming back to the sea form of of of of of god's word praise the lord that's the reason why you never find brother branham you know uh uh uh uh trying to explain scripture scarlett explains scripture but the work of a prophet is to interpret scripture two different things as scholar will say that the synaptic gospel and you go to the root word of days and you go to the root word of death a prophet don't have time for that praise the lord amen i asked you to turn to a scripture now and i did not myself uh first feeding chapter one if you just see peter in this letter talking about to them that he's addressing the letter to it is not about what they will do but he's pl talking to the people you know placing those people amen amen verse 2 elect i call into the full knowledge of god the father true sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you in peace be multiplied praise the lord amen so if you even look at this and and if you just want to stretch the thought of what we have just read you'll realize that you know uh all of those things were projected like i said sanctification of the spirit was projected amen obedience and the sprinkling of the blood and all of that but so you you see where where where i'm trying to drive tour with with all of this because we have been given the ministry that has rightly divided the world of truth to us amen and we might not just take one uh uh line of cult or one scripture and just run with it you know and build our own security you know i'm pre-destined that i'm elected and all of that only because you know uh i mean we are walking and fading and all that you know they did there so they are now predestinated you know they did that they are no longer of us because they left us in all of that right so but let me come to something here uh that that brings me to this subject of the birthright if we have time tonight i actually will deal with it on sunday but just to kind of lay the foundation here so uh we can be able to appreciate the subject uh birthright one word is it actually caught my mind recently when when my nephew passed away and talking with the family and all of the struggle that was going on there uh and and you know the you know the this word came to my mind and it a plays on my mind because of the word right okay we realize that birthright is given to the firstborn amen is given to the firstborn and it is because of his position as we will see in scripture but it does not make him any different from the other children sure praise the lord it's just a right and that is the reason why stricturally that right can be taken also sure i mean it's always is is is is also and because the the conversation came in on the right of the of the wife you know uh i mean because because she's the wife she's giving this right it does not make her better than the mother of the individual amen or because he's the husband he's giving this right it does not make him better than the girl's father it's just a right that is that has been given to him by the union of marriage praise the lord amen now so for us to be able to to appreciate predestination election for knowledge being ordained by god we will we will appreciate it in a sense that is a right and we obtain this right by being accepted in the beloved the lord amen so understanding the the the birthright understanding structure of birthright understanding the importance of the breath right will make us to appreciate god's plan of redemption the lord amen do you believe there are people that believe they are predestinated they are elects of god but they will miss the rapture yeah definitely amen why because coming in knowledge of the word of god they embraced that truth but yet they did not have the right sure because the right of being an elected child of god is just not a title right the right of calling yourself a bride what is that what is the need of calling yourself a bride when you know you're not actually married sure yeah are you are you seeing the top line where i'm going so to really appreciate to be able to appreciate the subject of his divine nature that has been given to us to appreciate being the act the yeah the attributes of god the seed of god and appreciate all of god's attribute that he has he has given to us for you to really appreciate that you have to appreciate what the breath right is praise the lord amen so what i would do is that i would i would go to the end and then go back to the beginning and bring you to the end praise the lord amen you remember we we read from the scripture that he is the firstborn among many brethrens amen he is the firstborn he is the firstborn so because christ is the firstborn he has the breath right praise the lord so for us to enjoy the benefit of the breath right he brought us in him we are all baptized into one body anything out of that body you don't have a right to the rapture you don't have the right to redemption you don't have the right to call yourself a predestinated seed anything out of that body because he is the firstborn every right of the father belongs to him so for the person to think that god knew that i will love him i will serve him he knew that so he predestinated me it sounds like your self-possession except value that you had and god said i can't miss that one no i can't miss that one he having something that i need if there is any good in you it's because he gave it to you and then when we understand that then we appreciate grace then we walk humbly before him i was i was reading one of my devotion what i read charles bargin he said if god should take his grace off of the most holiest man he will become the most faithiest man the most wicked man you have ever known in the book of kings elisha came to to uh to that young man and said tomorrow you will wish ward against israel tomorrow you're going to rip the women in the town and you're going to ravish the babies praise the lord he says what am i a dog am i a dog for me to do that now this was a prophet if he only knew who was talking to him the word of the prophet anointed him for that service and it was on his fight that the dogs lake the blood of ahab praise the lord where are we tonight amen now you have to also realize that this is this is not a subject you know to create fear i mean if you're having fear it's in you it's not coming from me praise the lord i'm not preaching firing a brainstorm message here praise the lord is just a subject because we are a people that have been predestinated to give christ the preeminence and you can never put him first in your life until you really know who he is the bride that is promised in this age not to see death not to see death praise the lord is that bride that we give him the preeminence right we should make wish making him all in all the first in everything that matters praise the lord amen so you see it does not have to do with anything of how long you've been serving god how long you've been in the church how long you've been believing the message does not have to do anything with that you think about that it just made you to appreciate the grace of god it just make you to look back and say the lord god that have kept me out of these days he's able to kept keep me over the finish line amen praise the lord i mean with god we don't count years we don't count years with god because he's the asian of day so you don't count years with god you know i've been serving the law for 12 years for 10 years for 15 years for 50 years you don't count years with god because he's the asian of day and we also have a promise that they that know their god will be strong and do explode so we want to be strong in this time of of of fear i mean it's just a great fear among the people praise the lord just a great fear and i mean if the lord don't help us i mean we we all try to bring out all our spiritual weapon and you know our spiritual reason why we we choose to do this we choose not to do this i was talking with brother bill youngs he's uh he's too old for me to call him my friend but he's my friend and uh uh we do we do check he's one of the old men i checked him in all the time and we were talking from one thing to another you know and and i told him i said you know he was just talking about i mean just such a fear brother one you know i mean fear on the people every word i said yeah you know but the thing about it there is that we we have to realize that uh the scripture says the devil know that his time it's not short bro jordan it's finished it's out right and he's scared is the effect of his fear that is affecting the world is the effect of his fear that is affecting the world because he knows his time is out are we together you know so let's let's just enjoy the lord you know let's let's be grateful that we still have our doors open we can still be able to come together praise the lord and uh i mean those that can make it they can stay stream the service online you know and uh and and all of that and uh i would just say this you know uh uh as a church we try to encourage ourselves and and and discipline ourselves in as much as the lord can be able to help us we all need god's help praise the lord amen and we we put all of these things in place you know i mean if a person stays home and out of there you know brother brother wesley and sister carrick they drive two hours i believe they're following the service tonight you know brother wesley will call me in the week and say something he says and you call me and we talk a little bit and say but one we really enjoy the service on wayne's tonight you know we reeling and we talk and we just fellowship and all that you know so i mean uh a preacher will make the expression you know it's not the same you know being in service and following the service online don't allow that to get under your skin praise the lord amen you know when when when it is truth you say amen to the word but you don't take offense and say well i'm the one he's talking to because you know i don't come to church then you really get problems praise the lord because i mean if it is completely wrong then we as a church we are wrong for even hosting our service online sure but we did it to be able to facilitate the people that can make it here it is your responsibility to be in the spirit on the last day well let's go to the word tonight amen praise the lord i just want to take one quote from the message hearing recognizing acting on the word i read that tonight and then we share a few thoughts with you my time is almost up bill banham said jacob the reason that he choose to find the birthright regardless amen regardless he wanted to get it because that he know that birthright had the blessing amen praise the lord do you really think that's the reason why jacob wanted the breath right before jacob was even born the angel of the lord told rebecca the other we save the younger so there was something supernaturally dragging him that he could not understand sure praise the lord there was something supernaturally that was hidden in the gene of crookedness and lying and stealing and all the things that jacob had there was something that was lying there that was driving him the reason that he choose to find the bread fry regardless he wanted to get it because that he know the birthright had the blessing it held life praise the lord and that is the scene with us the breath right have the blessing the breath right holds the mystery of our life the will to live the will to serve god is in the birthright the will to surrender is in the birthright hell life he didn't care how it comes just so he got it praise the lord he didn't care the aqua sounds like a very careless tip me but it's truth because there is an internal thought behind that and another person would read this and think they can do anything they can lie they can cheat he didn't care how it comes just so he got it that was the mean thing while playing it comes on very matter he wanted it and he must have it and he got it blessed are they that do hunger now you see that's that is the beauty of a prophet ministry brother branham makes this this statement he make this expression no matter what it costs him but in another sense is that he's using a scripture here from from from the beatitude matthew chapter 5 to to kind of explain to bring the scriptural sins the scriptural drive praise the lord because jacob really did not understand it amen do you think that he really sat down and says man i need to get this breath right i really need to get his breath right man i need this birth right praise the lord let me step back a little bit if i forget my trench of thought i would trust the holy spirit to remind me but you'll realize that in the scripture the subject of birthright never came up in the first twins that were born amen praise the lord king and evil were the first twins that were born but you realize that breath right the subject of bread fry never came if a person is is really spiritually inclined you will ask yourself why the subject of birthright never came god had to wait for the twins of esa and jacob before he brings up the subject of birthright he never addressed because there was nothing to be addressed uh uh adam i mean uh king and evil on breakfast it's a scriptural proof that they had different fathers [Laughter] so god will not he will not use an inspiration to address that subject right but here you will also see that in the early book of genesis the early part of genesis there you will realize that the holy spirit appointed seth amen appointed seth so even though the subject of birthright never came up with king and abel but the sergeant of brethren were also on the line because birthright goes to the firstborn praise the lord amen birthright goes to the firstborn and the bible says when seth was born the scripture says amen begin to call upon the name of the lord praise the lord amen so we see here that the birthright the birthright you know you know i mean in a day and age where you know of the people's right water time word the truthness of god's birthright will be on this plane praise the lord amen so brother branham says blessed is he blessed blessed are they that do hunger then test for righteousness and they shall be filled so we see this subject here becomes very important and that's the first time that god will bring out the subject he will he will you write about the birthright i don't want to get out of talk but i pray that lord would just be able to help us because you you also you also see that when you start looking at uh songs ambassadors but we will get to that uh as we would trust the lord to be able to help us here so you see the birthright all the the sons all the children that were born born of the same parents there was one that this right was given to over in exeter is the one that opened the matrix the first one that was born girl says uh they belong to me so the the first bone the birthright all tied together praise the lord amen but you see what what what we want to keep in mind here is that uh we want to we want to we we are we are traveling to the spiritual application we are traveling to understand what gives us the right to the holy ghost what gives us the right all of these spiritual principle as god will establish it among his people and and and and you know and and make it lord and ordinance it will be something that we will we will we will learn about and we will grow up and people were applied and they are formulating and because because it's a law of god we must also realize that that because it it's god that makes everything he's the one that makes nature praise the lord and because it's a lord of god you realize that people that don't even read the bible state state appreciate that lord they still follow that lord praise the lord it's among the hindus is among the muslims is more on the uh i mean uh the haunting talks like brother branham who says you know uh i mean it because it's a law of god but we have to also appreciate and realize that god when he was giving his ordinance and his statutes to the children of israel they were not laws as do and dumbs all of those statues were given to the children of israel it was god trying to bring his thoughts what was in his mind praise the lord because the first time he tried to speak to them it sounded like lightning intended so god his internal thoughts he will give it to them as statues praise the lord think about giving them a sour day of rest it goes back to his internal thoughts it goes back to the god that appreciate works i mean i rest after his works so his his thoughts was not to just take one day special and maybe one day holy and and you know and and and become a hypocrite on one day but his thoughts was to bring an inner confidence that would become a rest that no matter how much money you have in the bank no matter what your job title is no matter if your house your bill is due when that rest is inside your mind might be in trouble because of how your body feels under the symptoms but there is just such a confidence that is down resting in your heart you know that god is in control i don't know how but i know he's in control praise the lord that's the reason why you will see the old testament statues and ordinance taking different approach in the new testament poor pharisees of pharisees would take the old testament sabbath and teach it in the book of of of hebrew and said there is a rest unto the people of god trying to show that all the sprinkling of of bloods on the on the tabernacle and all the sprinkling and all those things that was that were done in the old testament tabernacle paul will take that and give a spiritual meaning to it the high priest that will go behind the veil because he understands that god lay out all of those statues and ordinances expressing what was in his mind praise the lord amen you know as i thought i i talked about that i taught also on the subject of the testament and the testator praise the lord amen because you cannot have a testament until the testator is dead praise the lord amen now you see that's the reason why scholars come up with the old testament because they found that what the old testament was talking about is fulfilled in christ and his death fulfill the old testament so now they can have a testament because they tested or die praise the lord but the problem there is that we have a new testament amen we have a new testament and then how can we have a new testament we have to have another testator that has died and paul said you are a written episode read by all men you become the you become a new testament when you have died to yourself for the word of god to be revealed in you that's why the living word it's more in new testament than just a pocket bible because you cannot have a testament until the testitude is that is dead we could have an old testament because christ died but why should we have a new testament when we have not had a death but yeah we have a death paul said is no longer i don't leave it but christ now leave it in me praise the lord are we together so we will appreciate the subject of the breath right by the grace of god we look we look more into it on sunday and i'll try to bring uh a few scriptures there there there are there are things that are tied to to the breath rights benefits you know enjoy like like uh you know the the let's let's take one scripture here praise the lord let's take one and we can close on that tonight you love the lord tonight i mean that's that's what matters is falling in love with jesus he says if i be lifted up i will draw all men onto me to be called equal with jesus is to leave him up is to praise him because the more you praise him he's lifting you up amen so we want to live jesus glory be to god first chronicle chapter 5. i might need my baby to come and help me find chronicles praise the lord first chronicle chapter 5. verse one we'll pick up this on the on sunday if the lord help us we'll get back to this but i just want to show something here now the sons of ruben the firstborn of israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defied his father dead the breath right was giving if he was giving which means it was taken it was taken from him and he was giving it was giving unto the sons of joseph the son of israel but the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright which means you can never change the fact that he was the first born sure right praise the lord you you cannot you you cannot you cannot spiritualize it enjoying the benefit of the breath right cannot spiritual you there are certain things you cannot spiritualize sure praise the lord it's it's almost like uh uh you know years back uh uh uh uh you know that there's this this subject you know uh i mean you know uh adam was the first he was the first adam adam was the first adam does that sound funny praise the lord christ is the second adam amen and and and and for some reason you know people thought that there should be a a tear at them and what you would try to do there is that you you will try to spiritualize something that is not in god's word because that time is only meant for a first and a second praise the lord amen just like that a a first eve and a second eve there are some types that are just meant for that for you to try to roll it over and create another one of it you are just trying to spiritualize something that do not exist it's almost like trying to make joseph the firstborn why because he went to egypt you know what he uh he he was a son of prosperity so actually he's the firstborn because he have the bread right it does not work like that amen he can lose the the right he can lose the blessing he can lose it but it will always remains the fact that he was the one that came out first praise the lord jacob waved with with the breath right and with the blessing he met the angel and everything why was he seeking to reconcile with his brother or he could have just become spiritual life the angel has met me he changed my name i don't even care for that guy anymore i don't have to worry about oh praise the lord i mean you know i'm i'm in the rapture then you know why he could just spiritualize everything but he knew in the back of his mind the fact remains that he came out first that you cannot reverse you cannot spiritualize it praise the lord so here in this scripture and many other scripture which shows us how the birthright is tied to the firstborn praise the lord and all our rights is tied to the first born you have to find your first pawn which is christ jesus it's because of him that we have this right to the blessings of abraham it's because of him that we have the right to healing praise the lord sure you realize that i mean it's the firstborn has the right of redemption the right of redemption was given to the firstborn that's what god told the children of israel at the uh exeter exodus leviticus if you study that you realize that uh uh uh he says he says every every first born is mine then god went on he says well the levites will now take the place of the first born so what happened every first born that is born must be redeemed because now god choose the levites in the place of the firstborn what is he doing he's slowly bringing out his deep thoughts first he said the first born the first born on my eye but then as the people move on he says well okay i'm going to take the levi's in the place of the firstborn so now the levites are my firstborn praise the lord you see israel did not argue with it he did not he israel did not argue with it because from from the very father god told them that the uh the reason why i'm taking the first bone to be mine is because i i i spared the first bone and i slayed the egyptians first born this death anger was supposed to slay every firstborn but i saved the first born under the blood and i slayed the egyptian first bomb so all these first born that i saved are mine praise the lord won't you be glad to give god your firstborn if you realize that they would have died in egypt that there was no place in the house to keep your first born like him in the closet he's going to die under the bed he's going to die put the first bone on the breast to suck he's going to die won't you be glad to give god your first born musicians you can come let's stand up tonight praise the lord [Music] it's a testimony thanksgiving year [Music] i want to thank the lord for his healing mercy in the life of pat johnson a friend of mine who was losing his eyesight about a year ago sometime back in 2020 i brought a prayer request at the church year for him and was pray for today he called me in and said the lord healed him by the way of soddran now he can see very clear praise be to the lord our god and thank god for all amen and thank you all for your prayers praise the lord let just praise the lord tonight amen let's praise the lord tonight let me see something let me see something tonight and today he called me and said he was the law healed him by the way of surgery now now if if you fell shocked in your spirit if you if you swallow your praise because of that you have a wrong attitude that's that's one of the problem we have sometimes we think we know sometimes we think we have grown in the grace of god that's god's ordained way he ordained it he's the god of life and bible tells healing can only come from god and whatever that god will use he told up the prophet isaiah took a clean and and rob and go and he told hezekiah go and take some leaves and rub it in in in the clay and rub it on your bars jesus spit in the clay wrap it on the man eyes [Music] praise the lord [Music] we have have we have had people [Music] good men that have stand in faith they have trusted god for their healing and they won't visit the doctor they won't do what the doctor says and they trusted god for their healing and god healed him in a new body through death [Music] praise the lord for some reason when i read that i fed it and that's the reason why i'm crying against it because it's a wrong attitude [Music] i would just leave it as dead i don't want to go into any other thing tonight the same god i healed by divine healing is the same god that healed by the preaching of his word is the same god i hear by the hands of the doctor praise the lord [Music] on lift me up and let me stand by fade on [Music] my and let me stand by faith [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] yes i'm pressing on oh oh yes [Music] oh you see that's the reason why [Music] you're realizing the lord jesus ministry and even in the time of the great revival and even now an unbeliever with no knowledge of god maybe no desire of god he can easily be touched by the miraculous than the believer one of the reason is because that paul sinner is looking at himself now even walter of god's grace [Music] while the believer is looking at it as a right he's he's he's demanding god the lord i have trusted you all of these years you gotta you gotta do a miracle in my body lord i believe you have been holding to your word you can force god [Music] like we saw under the prophet ministry how the injured of the law will move in a meeting move in a meeting and touch sinners and heal people and all of those uh uh uh uh uh uh theologians and scala will sit on the pulpit expecting lord you know i brought my nephew to this meeting expecting you to move i know you were you would leave brother branham to i mean you don't program god like that that's not faith that's not faith it's a sense of fear you are expressing fear it's not faith if you believe that god can do a putter in his hands and leave it there most of the time we express fear and think it is faith that we have [Music] you would just love him you would just appreciate him he would just love him because god can use a five years old to hold his mama hands and say lord please jesus lord i pray for my mama just that simple prayer the miraculous god can be so pleased because it's an innocent child all he's doing he's just saying expressing words because there's a god he's being taught about [Music] and we put god on terms and we put him and lord jesus and and we bring him to death you remember lord you and god and oh my god may god just i believe church there are higher grounds i believe that the the the message of the hour is raising the bride to a higher ground that where we can appreciate god in his love we can just love him now even though you slay me i will still love you by a believer goes through a small trial then we start to look on our calendar how long we've been serving god then we want to bring god to court [Music] but when there is no triumph we can preach those things and it's so beautiful oh praise the lord thank you jesus oh praise the lord let god just put us through a little bit [Music] let's just thank him tonight
