[57:23] praise the lord
[57:25] let's pray together heavenly father
[57:27] lord we just want to thank you for your
[57:29] word
[57:31] lord like your prophet said in your word
[57:33] every history
[57:35] in your word
[57:36] is sometimes written in a poetic
[57:39] language
[57:40] and father god but they are hidden
[57:43] truths
[57:44] that lies in every line in every verse
[57:48] father so we are asking tonight that the
[57:50] holy spirit will come with god and take
[57:53] a portion of the word lord and open it
[57:56] this portion that we have read tonight
[57:59] father means something of internal value
[58:02] be said oh god that will draw those
[58:04] closer to you
[58:05] father knowing that god we we just not
[58:10] want to use this opportunity to god to
[58:12] play it in a form of religion but we
[58:14] want to let our house be for you
[58:17] oh god that you will come out of the
[58:18] pages of your word
[58:20] and meet us at the very point of our
[58:22] needs tonight
[58:23] we thank you father we love you and we
[58:26] appreciate you dear god
[58:27] in jesus name we pray
[58:29] amen
[58:31] amen the lord bless you you may have
[58:32] your seat
[58:34] for the next few minutes that is before
[58:36] us maybe 30 or so
[58:39] um
[58:41] i will i would like to
[58:44] for us to do a little little bit of a
[58:46] review here let's go back to the book of
[58:49] obedience
[58:50] let's go back to the book of opidios we
[58:53] realized that uh
[58:57] we've been
[58:58] kind of for studying
[59:01] the joining
[59:02] of easter and edom
[59:06] and just like we said
[59:08] you know the lord
[59:10] gave obi dyers a vision
[59:13] to be able to
[59:15] search out the hidden things
[59:18] of easter that's why the scripture the
[59:20] verse there in verse 6 says how are the
[59:23] hating things of israel such out
[59:27] how
[59:28] are his hidden things sought out
[59:31] so we realized that
[59:34] can you can you imagine that that god
[59:37] raised up
[59:38] obedience in all of his life brother
[59:41] branham said
[59:42] uh
[59:43] there's not much we know about dire and
[59:46] strange enough that was the only time
[59:48] that brother brennan mentioned ob diary
[59:50] in in
[59:51] that is on te he might have mentioned it
[59:53] sometime but the only time on tape was
[59:56] where he says there is nothing we know
[59:58] about opidia
[1:00:01] praise the lord now so we but you think
[1:00:04] about it that god
[1:00:06] you know bless his mom and his dad with
[1:00:09] this boy
[1:00:11] and
[1:00:12] give them what they needed to raise him
[1:00:15] up whether he went to school or not we
[1:00:17] don't know but
[1:00:19] that god would god in part in his life
[1:00:22] for one purpose
[1:00:26] to revere to him
[1:00:28] the hidden things of easter
[1:00:32] praise the lord
[1:00:35] we know that god bless
[1:00:38] zacharias and elizabeth with a son
[1:00:40] called john
[1:00:43] after they have lived all of their lives
[1:00:45] and anyway in old age but yet god
[1:00:47] blessed them with that child
[1:00:50] and
[1:00:51] just for a six-month ministry
[1:00:54] and all he was born for was to introduce
[1:00:57] the messiah
[1:00:59] six months
[1:01:03] everything that he went through in his
[1:01:04] life everything he learned
[1:01:07] was all gearing to a six-month ministry
[1:01:13] a voice
[1:01:14] crying in the wilderness
[1:01:17] praise the lord
[1:01:19] and that's the reason why we can believe
[1:01:21] from the word of god and from the
[1:01:22] message of the hour that god has a
[1:01:24] purpose for our lives
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] you going to school and and learning
[1:01:31] getting a career
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] and everything that you are doing
[1:01:36] is all intertwining
[1:01:39] into
[1:01:40] the the sole purpose
[1:01:43] that god ordained your life on this
[1:01:45] earth
[1:01:46] praise the lord
[1:01:48] out of your hardship out of your
[1:01:50] struggle all of your tears they are all
[1:01:53] in the plan of god just to be able to
[1:01:56] achieve that one purpose
[1:02:01] praise the lord
[1:02:03] can you can you imagine it brother
[1:02:05] branham says
[1:02:06] in
[1:02:08] adoption series he says
[1:02:10] he says maybe for a mother
[1:02:12] her purpose
[1:02:14] was to be able to raise a boy
[1:02:16] like susanna wesley
[1:02:19] that someday he will be a preacher
[1:02:22] that was the only work
[1:02:24] that god had for her
[1:02:28] to be able to install into a young man
[1:02:32] the value of god that someday he will be
[1:02:34] a preacher
[1:02:40] praise the lord
[1:02:41] so we get back to the book of obedience
[1:02:44] here just one chapter
[1:02:53] we talked about it the last time but i
[1:02:55] want to pick up something
[1:02:57] that is tied into the prophecy
[1:02:59] there of
[1:03:02] psalm chapter 137 that we read tonight
[1:03:09] praise the lord
[1:03:12] you love the lord tonight
[1:03:14] you relax
[1:03:15] it's just a prayer meeting
[1:03:17] we're kind of
[1:03:19] trying to uh
[1:03:21] flex our muscle a little bit we know
[1:03:23] that the lord there with us this weekend
[1:03:25] if he never there with you he's there
[1:03:26] with me surely amen praise the lord amen
[1:03:30] so uh
[1:03:32] we had a good time good to have our
[1:03:34] brother ben and his family back from
[1:03:36] their trip to pennsylvania and praise
[1:03:38] the lord thank god for granting you a
[1:03:40] safe travel
[1:03:41] and we are glad that you made it back
[1:03:44] home
[1:03:45] praise the lord
[1:03:46] uh
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:50] brother eric have a reason to be away
[1:03:52] this weekend so uh we pray that the lord
[1:03:54] also will grant him a safe travel
[1:03:58] now so as we look at this
[1:04:00] together
[1:04:01] tonight
[1:04:03] uh
[1:04:05] let's read verse one there in the book
[1:04:07] of obedience the bible says the vision
[1:04:09] of obedience god said the lord god
[1:04:13] concerning
[1:04:14] edom
[1:04:15] his vision was concerning
[1:04:18] edom
[1:04:20] praise the lord
[1:04:22] and see the way that he
[1:04:24] uh he brought
[1:04:26] his message out
[1:04:30] we have heard
[1:04:32] a roman from the lord
[1:04:36] it's like god whispering because god is
[1:04:39] never into gossip anyway
[1:04:42] amen
[1:04:44] and he says
[1:04:45] and an ambassador
[1:04:48] is sin
[1:04:49] among the heating arise yet
[1:04:52] and let us rise up against her in battle
[1:04:57] and we read all of this
[1:04:59] he's talking about edom
[1:05:01] behold i have made thee small among the
[1:05:04] hittings
[1:05:06] thou are greatly
[1:05:08] despised
[1:05:10] praise the lord
[1:05:12] now what i want us to understand
[1:05:15] is not the people
[1:05:17] that god is despising
[1:05:20] there is an attitude amen
[1:05:23] there is a lifestyle and we will
[1:05:25] identify them tonight because all of
[1:05:28] this will bring us to the place where we
[1:05:30] will we will understand what malachi
[1:05:33] said
[1:05:35] easier
[1:05:36] jacob i love
[1:05:38] isa i hate
[1:05:40] well what actually brought that language
[1:05:44] we will understand that that's that's
[1:05:46] what i want to go to with this but
[1:05:48] tonight i just want to do it a little
[1:05:50] bit around their prophecy there in
[1:05:55] psalm chapter 37.
[1:05:58] so hear god looking at these people
[1:06:01] saying
[1:06:03] uh
[1:06:04] that greatly despised
[1:06:07] malachi said jacob i love
[1:06:10] eso i hate paul came he said
[1:06:14] the children
[1:06:15] not even being born
[1:06:17] they never even make no choices
[1:06:20] of their own god says i love the younger
[1:06:25] and i hate
[1:06:26] the other
[1:06:28] so we want to look into this pray that
[1:06:31] the lord will be able to help us amen
[1:06:33] so as we go a long year
[1:06:36] we are further read through this uh the
[1:06:38] last two uh
[1:06:40] uh services that we do out on this
[1:06:43] let's let's travel down a little bit we
[1:06:46] we read verse 3 talking about the pride
[1:06:50] of that heart has deceived thee that
[1:06:53] dwelleth in the clave of the rock
[1:06:55] whose habitation is high
[1:07:00] that said in his heart who shall bring
[1:07:02] me down
[1:07:03] you know we compared
[1:07:05] edom
[1:07:06] you know uh uh
[1:07:09] confession year to date of lucifer
[1:07:12] confession in isaiah chapter 14.
[1:07:18] and
[1:07:25] i wish i bring me down to the ground
[1:07:26] down though thou exult thyself as an ego
[1:07:31] and though they have set the nets among
[1:07:33] the stars things will i bring thee down
[1:07:36] said the lord
[1:07:38] praise the lord
[1:07:40] now we get to verse six let's drop to
[1:07:42] verse six that's where we stopped the
[1:07:44] last sunday how are the things of ether
[1:07:47] searched out
[1:07:49] how
[1:07:51] are his hidden things
[1:07:53] now
[1:07:55] if you if you just take this verse
[1:07:58] it will make you to appreciate
[1:08:02] the prophet ministry many of us
[1:08:06] got to know brother branham through the
[1:08:08] text
[1:08:09] through the box
[1:08:10] we were never in the meeting
[1:08:12] praise the lord
[1:08:15] but yet when you listen to the tapes and
[1:08:17] you see uh you know and and and you i
[1:08:20] mean you are caught up into
[1:08:22] uh the the discernment the healing which
[1:08:25] of course i've received a miracle by
[1:08:27] listening to a tape god reaching mercy i
[1:08:30] still remember it lying on my bed i
[1:08:33] still remember how god visited me
[1:08:35] and
[1:08:36] but
[1:08:37] this is a prophet
[1:08:39] a man
[1:08:41] that god
[1:08:42] is using
[1:08:44] to go back in the life of esau esau
[1:08:47] lived many years
[1:08:50] from ob dives
[1:08:52] many generations now only years
[1:08:56] but here he said this prophet
[1:08:58] with a gift of vision he's going to go
[1:09:01] back
[1:09:02] to be able to search some of the heating
[1:09:06] things some of the things that are not
[1:09:08] even written
[1:09:14] praise the lord
[1:09:16] and we believe that that same spirit is
[1:09:18] here tonight the same spirit that
[1:09:21] searched the rings and the heart
[1:09:24] before whom every every life is naked
[1:09:27] like paul said in the book of hebrew
[1:09:30] how are the things of esau sesh out
[1:09:34] how are his hidden things
[1:09:37] sought out
[1:09:40] all the men
[1:09:41] of the
[1:09:42] confederacy have brought thee even to
[1:09:46] the border the men that
[1:09:50] were at peace with thee
[1:09:52] have deceived thee
[1:09:54] now when we look into the life of easter
[1:09:57] we saw how
[1:09:59] you know he he disobeyed his parents
[1:10:02] uh he knew that his parents were not in
[1:10:05] favor of him marrying any of the girls
[1:10:07] from the land of kenneth and he decided
[1:10:09] to do that
[1:10:11] he took the anger of his against his
[1:10:13] brother jacob
[1:10:15] even against his parents
[1:10:17] and he became defiant
[1:10:20] so
[1:10:21] you will see that
[1:10:23] as you look at the history we we shared
[1:10:26] a little bit of that with you right from
[1:10:28] from abraham
[1:10:29] and then
[1:10:31] abraham having isaac
[1:10:34] there's a little review now and abraham
[1:10:36] having ishmael
[1:10:39] praise the lord
[1:10:40] and then after sarah died abraham
[1:10:44] married keturah
[1:10:47] and he had other sons
[1:10:50] now those sons that abraham had by
[1:10:53] keturah they are the arabs
[1:10:58] they are the dwellers of the present-day
[1:11:00] saudi arabia
[1:11:05] okay
[1:11:06] and we see that ishmael also
[1:11:09] had
[1:11:10] a
[1:11:13] 12 songs
[1:11:16] then we see
[1:11:18] isaac
[1:11:19] from isaac now is branching out easter
[1:11:23] and jacob
[1:11:26] are we together
[1:11:28] okay
[1:11:29] so
[1:11:30] all of the nations that are around
[1:11:34] present-day israel
[1:11:36] are all children
[1:11:38] from easter ishmael
[1:11:41] and the sons of keturah
[1:11:48] and israel
[1:11:49] is from isaac jacob
[1:11:52] now so we we see that
[1:11:55] now that's that's where verse seven
[1:11:57] comes in play because there was a
[1:11:59] confederacy that was made
[1:12:01] ishmael merged with these other he
[1:12:05] merged with the children i mean yeah
[1:12:07] easter which is edom merged with the
[1:12:10] children of of uh
[1:12:12] ishmael and the rest of the sons of uh
[1:12:17] uh
[1:12:18] keturah you know to make a confederacy
[1:12:21] to come against jacob
[1:12:26] praise the lord
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:31] what we want what i want us to look at
[1:12:33] tonight
[1:12:35] there is an evil there's a there's an
[1:12:38] evil that edom date
[1:12:40] a sin you can call it sin you can call
[1:12:42] it iniquity there's an evil that edom
[1:12:45] date that god never forgot
[1:12:49] that's what i want us to look at tonight
[1:12:50] that's what i want for us to study so we
[1:12:53] see here that
[1:12:55] there was a confederacy may
[1:12:59] and uh
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:11] verse seven all the men of of that
[1:13:13] confederacy had brought thee even to the
[1:13:15] border the men that were at peace with
[1:13:17] thee have deceived thee and prevailed
[1:13:20] against thee they that eat that bread
[1:13:23] have lain
[1:13:25] and won't honor thee there is none
[1:13:28] understanding in him
[1:13:31] shall annette
[1:13:33] in that day said the lord
[1:13:35] even destroy the wise men of edom
[1:13:40] and understanding out of the mount of
[1:13:44] easter praise the lord
[1:13:47] all the all the mighty men oh tamman if
[1:13:50] you go back and check the root of israel
[1:13:52] you'll find out that that name is one of
[1:13:55] his sons
[1:14:02] all to the end of every one
[1:14:04] of the man of easter may be cut off by
[1:14:07] slaughter
[1:14:09] for the violence
[1:14:11] against that brother
[1:14:13] jacob
[1:14:14] shame chakra day now this is hundreds of
[1:14:18] years after
[1:14:21] easter has died he has gone but out of
[1:14:25] him has come this this people called the
[1:14:30] and
[1:14:32] the the the the hatred
[1:14:35] the bitterness
[1:14:37] the easter hard against his brother i
[1:14:40] mean it was god that intervened that was
[1:14:43] the reason why god had to meet jacob
[1:14:46] that night
[1:14:48] he had to meet the injured that night
[1:14:51] because nothing was going to stop easter
[1:14:56] from destroying jacob unless god has
[1:14:59] intervened in jacob's life
[1:15:04] praise the lord
[1:15:05] now what makes this story interesting
[1:15:08] is dead
[1:15:10] two brought us from the same wound
[1:15:12] and when brother branham talks about how
[1:15:14] every revival produced twins
[1:15:18] it would take people that have hanged
[1:15:20] around this message
[1:15:24] to persecute this bride
[1:15:29] the people that are saying the most
[1:15:32] foul things about the message
[1:15:35] about the prophet were people that sat
[1:15:38] in the pew just like you are sitting
[1:15:41] sad honor a preacher
[1:15:43] listening to this very same message that
[1:15:45] you are listening to
[1:15:49] praise the lord i don't want to go into
[1:15:51] that tonight i'm just trying to give you
[1:15:53] give us some history here but that's why
[1:15:55] we are traveling let me introduce that
[1:15:57] to you
[1:15:58] praise the lord
[1:16:00] unless god intervened in the life of
[1:16:03] jacob
[1:16:04] it was the supernatural
[1:16:08] it was the angel of the lord that met
[1:16:10] jacob that night
[1:16:12] the influence that the angel had on
[1:16:15] jacob's life
[1:16:18] that's why softing easier
[1:16:24] because until jacob came and met easter
[1:16:28] isa was determined
[1:16:32] to destroy him jacob saying he's saying
[1:16:36] katos take it and go in the peace my
[1:16:39] brother
[1:16:41] esau told him i have i have cuddles on
[1:16:43] the hills
[1:16:45] i don't want your cattle i want the man
[1:16:47] jacob
[1:16:55] praise the lord
[1:16:58] and with everything we find that is
[1:17:00] happening around us we don't know when
[1:17:02] that hour will come upon us
[1:17:06] praise the lord
[1:17:07] but we see we see the message and the
[1:17:10] messenger being attacked on facebook
[1:17:12] and people are bored to say whatever
[1:17:15] they want to say
[1:17:16] and i was just talking to a a brother uh
[1:17:19] uh uh was that last night or the other
[1:17:22] uh just just few days ago then i was
[1:17:24] just telling him i said
[1:17:26] does that just the nature of man we
[1:17:28] always try to blame somebody for our
[1:17:31] failure
[1:17:34] praise the lord
[1:17:35] we want to blame brother branham why are
[1:17:37] we not living godly life
[1:17:41] brother branham should be responsible
[1:17:42] while we don't have the holy ghost
[1:17:47] when he have declared the counsel of god
[1:17:50] to us
[1:17:57] men are always
[1:17:59] with that uh brother branham says that's
[1:18:01] that's uh that's passing the ball that's
[1:18:03] that's that's the adamic falling nature
[1:18:08] they always want to blame somebody
[1:18:11] for their failure
[1:18:13] oh god
[1:18:18] let me realize
[1:18:21] if i don't get to that place to have
[1:18:24] like brother branham says uh uh uh the
[1:18:27] the the
[1:18:29] he says uh the dynamics of this church
[1:18:33] will be the refilling of the holy ghost
[1:18:37] for this church to go right into her
[1:18:40] revival
[1:18:41] for this bride to go right into
[1:18:45] that spoken word revival we will need
[1:18:47] the dynamics we have the mechanics we
[1:18:50] have it on our phone we have an ipad we
[1:18:53] play it all night but we will need that
[1:18:55] quickening power to come from on the
[1:18:57] tape to come from on the box and quicken
[1:19:00] our lives
[1:19:03] if you don't have it it's your own fault
[1:19:08] praise the lord if you don't have the
[1:19:10] holy ghost it's your own fault
[1:19:13] the better you start you start looking
[1:19:15] at yourself now
[1:19:16] the better it is for you to get closer
[1:19:18] to god
[1:19:29] for the violence against the brothers
[1:19:31] jacob
[1:19:32] shame shall cover thee
[1:19:36] and thou shall be cut off
[1:19:38] so we see here
[1:19:40] if you go back there in verse three
[1:19:44] esau was very proud
[1:19:48] we see
[1:19:50] with the the the bitterness and the
[1:19:53] hatred that he has
[1:19:57] he he got again he he gained people
[1:20:02] when he spread four romans all around
[1:20:04] jacob has told him a blessing and i mean
[1:20:07] and he just he just he just polluted
[1:20:09] people's minds to hit jacob the same way
[1:20:12] he hit jacob
[1:20:14] he created a confederacy
[1:20:20] and he was violence
[1:20:25] against his brother jacob
[1:20:27] you think about it
[1:20:29] they came from the same womb
[1:20:38] praise the lord
[1:20:39] the mystery of the first tweens is
[1:20:42] different from the mystery of the second
[1:20:44] tweens
[1:20:46] the first twins they came from the same
[1:20:48] womb but from two different life two
[1:20:50] different father
[1:20:55] praise the lord
[1:20:56] amen
[1:20:57] we talk about that i don't want to
[1:21:00] repeat myself here because somebody
[1:21:02] quit to get out of track here
[1:21:06] and that's what we see here he had a
[1:21:08] violence against his brother jacob
[1:21:11] listen to this now verse 11
[1:21:15] in the day
[1:21:17] that thou stood on the other side
[1:21:22] in the day
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:25] the strangers
[1:21:27] carried away captive his force
[1:21:30] psalm
[1:21:31] 100
[1:21:34] and 37
[1:21:37] that's why ob diary is referring to yeah
[1:21:46] praise the lord
[1:21:47] in a day that thou stood on the other
[1:21:49] side
[1:21:52] in the day
[1:21:53] that the strangers
[1:21:55] carried away captive his forces
[1:21:58] and foreigners entered into his gates
[1:22:02] and cast lot
[1:22:04] upon jerusalem even thou
[1:22:07] waste was one of them
[1:22:10] but thou should not have looked on thy
[1:22:14] brother in the day that he became a
[1:22:17] stranger
[1:22:20] praise the lord
[1:22:22] now when you go back to the sound that
[1:22:24] we have just read
[1:22:26] let's go back to psalm 137
[1:22:34] like i said it's just a prayer meeting
[1:22:36] tonight we just want to read our bible
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:46] psalm 137 let's go back there
[1:23:01] we will do the preaching on sunday but
[1:23:02] let's let's just read
[1:23:04] the scripture tonight and then we trust
[1:23:07] the lord to
[1:23:08] to put something on our heart to preach
[1:23:10] on sunday
[1:23:11] okay
[1:23:13] 37
[1:23:16] look at the
[1:23:17] uh
[1:23:20] verse
[1:23:22] seven
[1:23:28] david out of inspiration he picks this
[1:23:31] up
[1:23:34] or the psalmist let me say
[1:23:36] because david is not one that wrote all
[1:23:38] the psalm anyway
[1:23:42] remember
[1:23:43] oh lord the children of edom
[1:23:46] in the day of jerusalem
[1:23:51] who said raise it raise it even to the
[1:23:54] foundation day of
[1:23:58] this is a prophecy if you go back
[1:24:00] instead of this is in history how the
[1:24:02] children of edom when when when
[1:24:04] nebuchadnezzar came babylon came and
[1:24:07] took over jerusalem
[1:24:11] the psalmist just did not say this
[1:24:14] to create a scene
[1:24:17] but that was the attitude of the people
[1:24:19] that was the attitude of the children of
[1:24:22] edom
[1:24:23] they were saying
[1:24:26] leave no stone untouched
[1:24:32] leave no stone untouched
[1:24:36] even to the foundation thereof
[1:24:39] raise it rig everything destroy
[1:24:42] everything
[1:24:44] now in the book of obedience
[1:24:48] obedience in his vision is seeing edom
[1:24:51] on the other side
[1:24:53] looking at his brother
[1:24:58] being carried into cutting and doing
[1:25:00] nothing about it
[1:25:04] doing
[1:25:05] nothing about it
[1:25:08] the scriptures say he that know to do
[1:25:10] good
[1:25:11] and doing that
[1:25:14] is sin
[1:25:17] brother branham said that is the worst
[1:25:19] thing that you can do to do nothing
[1:25:22] praise the lord
[1:25:23] let's read the prophet a little bit
[1:25:30] making valley full of dishes
[1:25:38] he says that that's the trouble of it
[1:25:42] it's more seen
[1:25:45] not to do
[1:25:47] than it is
[1:25:49] to do
[1:25:51] when you know better
[1:25:56] it's more seen
[1:25:57] not to do
[1:26:00] the attitude of it does not concern me
[1:26:06] praise the lord
[1:26:11] he said it's more seen not to do
[1:26:14] than it is to do when you know better
[1:26:16] that's right
[1:26:18] he that knoweth to do good and does it
[1:26:21] now to him it's sin
[1:26:24] you got to
[1:26:26] make ready
[1:26:28] doing nothing
[1:26:29] is the worst thing
[1:26:33] you can do
[1:26:36] praise the lord
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:40] doing nothing
[1:26:41] even with this whole covey situation you
[1:26:43] are not a doctor you are not a scientist
[1:26:45] but you are a christian
[1:26:50] you are a christian you can pray
[1:26:52] you have a god that can answer prayer
[1:26:56] so you can contribute
[1:26:58] to help this the corvette situation if
[1:27:01] you just take a time to pray
[1:27:08] but brandon says the worst thing you can
[1:27:10] do doing nothing is the worst thing you
[1:27:12] can do
[1:27:15] do nothing about it
[1:27:18] it's on what you are doing
[1:27:22] then it is what you are failing to do
[1:27:30] praise the lord
[1:27:34] you see generational conflict
[1:27:38] something that just happened when they
[1:27:39] were just little boys
[1:27:43] in the house
[1:27:45] of their parents
[1:27:47] when they were not even married
[1:27:53] has now spread out to nations
[1:27:59] you see all of those nations around
[1:28:01] israel
[1:28:02] that don't want the peace of israel want
[1:28:04] to whip them out of the map it comes
[1:28:06] back to this prophecy
[1:28:22] praise the lord
[1:28:26] i give you the example of
[1:28:29] joseph and his brothers
[1:28:35] he was the one that was taken away
[1:28:39] his brother sold him his i mean it was
[1:28:42] not like edom eden was not the one that
[1:28:44] was coming against israel
[1:28:48] joseph brother saw him
[1:28:52] and it's still right there
[1:28:54] dividing the money
[1:28:58] of his price
[1:29:00] while the chair took him away
[1:29:07] but you see
[1:29:09] he never talked what happened to him
[1:29:14] as as ugly as he was as as as
[1:29:17] heartbroken as he was as disappointed as
[1:29:19] he was in his brother his question was
[1:29:22] why they did this
[1:29:27] why they did this
[1:29:30] now you have to remember now these are
[1:29:32] the same boys
[1:29:34] that raid a whole nation
[1:29:37] when the temple with their sister the uh
[1:29:39] diner
[1:29:43] they raided a whole city
[1:29:45] kill all the men in the city
[1:29:49] so perhaps joseph is thinking in his
[1:29:52] mind these guys are throwing the praying
[1:29:54] on me maybe they will come after this
[1:29:56] man and beat them
[1:30:01] but you see
[1:30:02] he could not understand it
[1:30:05] and he did not put no reason to it
[1:30:09] and because of that
[1:30:11] he could not get better
[1:30:15] he could not sow bitterness in his heart
[1:30:23] for all the years that he was away
[1:30:27] he was longing to see his brothers
[1:30:29] when he even had the opportunity
[1:30:32] to light them up give them some latches
[1:30:38] but he treated them with kindness
[1:30:40] because there was now one
[1:30:43] root of bitterness
[1:30:47] in his heart
[1:30:52] but easier
[1:30:55] because of proud
[1:30:58] that is in his heart
[1:31:02] you know what pride comes from
[1:31:04] it comes from that
[1:31:05] it comes from the attitude of
[1:31:07] entitlement
[1:31:11] when a child feels like they i mean they
[1:31:14] are entitled to this
[1:31:18] they don't they don't they don't regard
[1:31:20] it
[1:31:22] they just think they have a right they
[1:31:24] can they can take it they can do
[1:31:25] whatever they want to do with it
[1:31:33] praise the lord
[1:31:38] but that root of bitterness
[1:31:46] these two across the street
[1:31:50] i mean they couldn't they couldn't fight
[1:31:52] the babylonians
[1:31:55] but i mean they could do something
[1:31:58] they could even put their hands on their
[1:32:00] head and cry
[1:32:02] but that was not their attitude
[1:32:06] their attitude was web them out destroy
[1:32:09] everything
[1:32:16] that kind of attitude
[1:32:19] god never forget
[1:32:22] now you have to think about it this way
[1:32:25] brother branham said
[1:32:29] if you want to do something special for
[1:32:31] me
[1:32:32] he said do it for my children
[1:32:38] so
[1:32:39] it's a sense
[1:32:43] that's why jesus said
[1:32:46] anything spoken against the son of man
[1:32:47] will be forgiven
[1:32:51] he says but when the holy spirit come
[1:32:53] one word
[1:32:55] because the holy spirit will be in his
[1:32:56] children
[1:33:04] are we together
[1:33:19] say remember oh lord the children of
[1:33:22] edom
[1:33:23] in the day of jerusalem
[1:33:27] who said
[1:33:29] raise it raise it even to the foundation
[1:33:31] thereof
[1:33:40] now so
[1:33:41] obi daya picks that up in his vision
[1:33:44] describing that very sin in the day that
[1:33:46] thou stood on the other side
[1:33:49] in the day
[1:33:51] that the strangers
[1:33:52] carry
[1:33:54] and rebrand talks about that i i read
[1:33:56] that to you there you know
[1:33:59] he says he says as long as
[1:34:04] birth is in a man never give up on him
[1:34:14] but when we want to fail

[1:34:18] he have crossed the line
[1:34:20] he had crossed the line that that
[1:34:23] language of they have crossed the line
[1:34:25] is your personal attitude
[1:34:30] it's your attitude against the person
[1:34:33] you you i mean you are so angry with the
[1:34:35] person you don't want to help them no he
[1:34:37] has crossed the line
[1:34:39] the brother has crossed the line

[1:34:49] let brother or sister
[1:34:53] misrepresent the truth
[1:34:57] we get better we get angry
[1:35:03] praise the lord
[1:35:07] when the lord said vengeance is mine
[1:35:09] i will repay
[1:35:11] why you want to play god
[1:35:27] in the day that thou stood on the other
[1:35:29] side in the day that the strangers
[1:35:31] carried
[1:35:32] a wake up to his forces and foreigners
[1:35:35] entered into his gates and cast lot upon
[1:35:39] jerusalem even the our world has one of
[1:35:41] them

[1:35:56] coming in
[1:36:00] but there should not have looked on
[1:36:03] the day of that brother
[1:36:06] that he became a stranger
[1:36:09] god is saying you should have done some
[1:36:11] when you go to the book of deuteronomy
[1:36:14] you realize that god told israel
[1:36:18] god told israel
[1:36:20] he says
[1:36:21] do not pay back on edom
[1:36:24] what he has done to you
[1:36:26] because he is your brother
[1:36:33] he said even the egyptians
[1:36:36] because they house you
[1:36:48] you see the benefit of the ministry of a
[1:36:50] prophet
[1:36:54] just one vision
[1:36:58] it takes us back to genesis and carrying
[1:37:00] us all the way to the to
[1:37:02] the to the end of edom and uh in in in
[1:37:04] all and i mean we and we can go on and
[1:37:06] on
[1:37:09] god said thou should not have looked on
[1:37:11] the day of the brother in the day that
[1:37:13] he became a stranger neither should they
[1:37:16] have rejoice
[1:37:20] over the children of judah
[1:37:22] in their destruction
[1:37:24] a hurt god
[1:37:26] to his heart
[1:37:28] when you laugh at his children
[1:37:32] when you mock god's people
[1:37:35] and you throw hint in smart words
[1:37:38] it hurt god to his heart
[1:37:41] when you do that
[1:37:51] god
[1:37:52] never forgot that
[1:37:56] he never forgot
[1:37:58] the sin of edom
[1:38:10] neither should i have spoken proudly
[1:38:14] in the day of distress
[1:38:20] they all should not
[1:38:22] have entered into the gates of my people
[1:38:25] in the day of their calamity
