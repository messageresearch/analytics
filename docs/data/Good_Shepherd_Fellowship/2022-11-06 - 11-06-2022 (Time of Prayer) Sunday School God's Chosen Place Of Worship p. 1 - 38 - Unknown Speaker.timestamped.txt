[0:44] of Grace by faith we move into the
[0:48] Beyond
[0:49] or God
[0:52] and the angels and the cherubins and all
[0:55] the Heavenly Host is assembled together
[0:58] or he said there cannot be even a
[1:00] sparrow fall to the ground without a
[1:02] Heavenly Father knowing it how much more
[1:05] does he know here when hundreds of
[1:07] people have their heads bowed and
[1:09] calling up on the far special requests
[1:14] father looked down upon the needy world
[1:17] tonight for we are needy people
[1:20] I pray God that because that we have
[1:22] assembled here and expressing to thee
[1:25] our faith and a living God who does
[1:28] answer prayer
[1:31] we have come out from among the world of
[1:34] the uncircumcised of the heart and ears
[1:37] come out to live a separate life and to
[1:39] live in confessing our faith in thee
[1:41] tonight we've raised our hands and
[1:44] saying we're needing
[1:46] dear God answer every one of their
[1:49] requests
[1:50] and then father we pray that you have
[1:52] visited us tonight in the word
[1:54] we come here for correction for
[1:57] understanding that we might know just
[2:00] how to live in this present day what to
[2:02] look forward to what to do for we know
[2:06] the coming of the Lord is drawing now
[2:08] according to all the signs that the
[2:11] prophets foretold
[2:13] we're nearing the time lord when
[2:15] complete deliverance will be given to
[2:17] your children
[2:18] God let us everyone be their father May
[2:21] there not be one missing
[2:25] that's our purpose of being here Lord we
[2:27] love you and we're trying to prepare for
[2:29] that hour
[2:31] speak to us we ask again tonight and
[2:33] heal the sick
[2:34] all the sick and Afflicted that's in the
[2:36] building we pray that you'll heal them
[2:39] Lord and especially them with spiritual
[2:41] needs we pray that you'll save our lost
[2:44] soul
[2:45] feel every believer with the Holy Spirit
[2:48] and renew the strength and power in your
[2:52] believing children
[2:53] Grant these things father we asked much
[2:56] because you told us to ask them uh ask
[2:59] abundance
[3:01] ask for great things many of them
[3:04] that our Joys might be made full
[3:08] and we ask then in Jesus Christ's name
[3:10] amen Lord and be seated
[3:21] yeah
[3:23] I certainly deem this the grand
[3:25] privilege tonight to be back here to
[3:27] platform again here in this High School
[3:29] to face These Fine people that's
[3:31] gathered out to hear the gospel
[3:34] I ask God's mercy to help me to tell you
[3:36] the truth as far as I know the truth he
[3:39] still can close the mouth of a man he
[3:41] seems he could the mouth of a lion and
[3:43] if I had ever tried to see anything that
[3:45] was wrong and contrary to his will my
[3:47] sincere prayer is that he closed my
[3:49] mouth that I won't say it or truly I
[3:52] want to be in heaven myself and I'll
[3:54] never be there and besides all that I'd
[3:56] be a false leader somebody who had done
[3:58] something falsely if I do it it's
[4:01] because I don't know no different the
[4:03] Lord bless you now tomorrow morning if
[4:06] it be the will of God I aim to speak on
[4:08] that subject marriage and divorce and we
[4:12] trust that you'll come
[4:13] and bring your pencils and papers we
[4:16] won't take too long but I just like that
[4:20] that was my purpose of being back here
[4:22] first in Indiana that I promised you
[4:24] that and I will try tomorrow morning if
[4:27] I don't get it tomorrow morning it will
[4:29] tomorrow night but I will try tomorrow
[4:31] morning if the Lord willing to speak on
[4:33] the subject the two schools of thoughts
[4:35] and may God help us to know what is
[4:38] truth just to know what's true so we can
[4:40] walk in truth and in life
[4:42] we you know used to have an old colored
[4:46] friend he said to me he said brother
[4:48] Billy said I don't want any trouble at
[4:50] the river
[4:51] he said I want to have my ticket in my
[4:53] hand and when the whistle blows I don't
[4:55] want any trouble there I've asked the
[4:57] Lord a long time ago if there's anything
[4:58] wrong let me set it up right now that
[5:01] because it'll be dark and stormy on that
[5:03] morning when the ship pulls out for the
[5:05] other side that I don't want any
[5:07] interference I want to take care of all
[5:08] of it now that's what we're here for try
[5:11] to take care of all the interferences so
[5:12] that we can walk aboard on that hour
[5:16] now
[5:18] I won't speak to you very long tonight
[5:19] because we got two Services tomorrow and
[5:22] then I take right off somewhere else to
[5:24] another more services but now in the
[5:27] book of Deuteronomy I wish to read from
[5:30] the 16th chapter the first three verses
[5:33] of Deuteronomy 16 and 1-3
[5:38] observe the month of Abid and keep the
[5:41] past over the Lord die God in the fourth
[5:45] month of avid the Lord thy God brought
[5:47] the fourth out of out of Egypt by night
[5:52] Thou shalt therefore say sacrifice
[5:56] the Passover unto the Lord thy God of
[5:58] the flocks and of the herd in the place
[6:01] which the Lord has chosen to place
[6:05] his name there
[6:08] now
[6:10] my subject tonight is God's chosen place
[6:14] of worship
[6:16] if you notice
[6:18] the month ABA D be there is means April
[6:23] the month of April is when they were
[6:26] brought out
[6:27] and now the strange thing is that we
[6:31] denied as worshipers of God in this day
[6:34] that we live in
[6:36] and we find so many different ideas of
[6:39] people
[6:41] and as long as there's different ideas
[6:43] about things there's got different
[6:46] questions there's got to be one true
[6:49] answer
[6:51] that ever question that's asked if I
[6:54] would ask the question what is this well
[6:57] let's say a desk what is it for see now
[7:02] there somebody might say it isn't your
[7:05] test it's a board
[7:07] well it is a board but yet it's a desk
[7:10] you see there's got to be a true answer
[7:11] to it and if I asked a question about
[7:14] anything there's got to be a true answer
[7:16] there can be something close to it but
[7:18] there's got to be a true direct answer
[7:20] to every question
[7:22] so therefore every question that comes
[7:24] up in our lives there's got to be a true
[7:28] correct answer
[7:31] and now today we hear it said so many of
[7:35] our people in the world today as being a
[7:38] missionary
[7:39] have taken several trips across the sea
[7:43] and around the world I've been in
[7:45] contact with many different religions
[7:47] such as Buddha and Muhammad and and
[7:51] Sikhs and genes and what more uh of the
[7:55] religions of the world
[7:56] and then here in our own United States
[7:58] and other foreign countries meet with
[8:01] all of our different churches such as
[8:03] our denominational churches beginning
[8:06] with the early Roman Catholic and then
[8:08] to the Greek and so forth and the
[8:11] different rights
[8:13] and then down into the all the
[8:15] denominational ages of 900 and something
[8:17] different Protestant denominations
[8:20] now each one of them of course you could
[8:23] see their idea and I cannot blame them
[8:25] each one claims that they are the truth
[8:29] they have the truth and uh the people it
[8:33] belongs to those churches should believe
[8:34] that because they have staked their
[8:38] their destination their Eternal
[8:40] destination upon the teaching of that
[8:42] church
[8:43] and there's so much different one from
[8:46] the other so it makes 900 and something
[8:50] different questions
[8:52] therefore being 900 and something
[8:54] different questions there's got to be
[8:56] one correct answer
[8:59] and
[9:00] I would like for us tonight
[9:02] being that we're trying to go to heaven
[9:05] and to meet our lord Jesus who we all
[9:07] love I would like to search in the
[9:11] scriptures to find that now if it is a
[9:14] Bible question then it should have a
[9:17] Bible answer it should not be able to
[9:20] come from a group of man from any
[9:21] certain uh
[9:24] a fellowship are from some educator or
[9:28] from some denomination it should come
[9:30] straight from the scripture where God's
[9:34] meeting place is of worship and surely
[9:37] being God there is a meeting place
[9:39] somewhere that he meets now we find out
[9:43] here that in Deuteronomy here at the
[9:46] beginning Moses reciting back the
[9:48] scripture the things that he had told
[9:50] them how he brought him out the great
[9:52] strong arm out of Egypt and at first
[9:54] established them they were called the
[9:56] people of God until they come out of the
[10:00] Egypt and then they were called The
[10:02] Church of God because the church is a
[10:05] congregating or the way the church means
[10:07] called out ones those who have been
[10:10] called out and they come out of Egypt in
[10:13] order to be the church now God told them
[10:16] when the before they established the
[10:19] temple whatever they did I will choose
[10:22] the place of My Worship
[10:24] and I'll put my name in it and that's
[10:28] the only place that God would ever meet
[10:30] anybody was by his own choosing he chose
[10:34] his place and where he chose his place
[10:37] he put his name the second verse here
[10:41] tells us that he would put his name in
[10:44] the place that he had chosen for people
[10:46] to worship Him in now the thing of it is
[10:49] we want to find where that place is with
[10:52] 900 and something different ideas being
[10:55] we're bypassing all Heathen religion and
[10:58] just speaking of Christian religion
[11:00] which uh uh have a feeling for the
[11:03] heathens or I certainly wouldn't be
[11:05] going over there talking to him but
[11:06] they're wrong
[11:08] Christianity is the only religion that's
[11:11] true it's Christianity I'm saying that
[11:13] not exactly because I am a Christian
[11:16] because I believe that to be the truth
[11:18] it's the only religion that's right
[11:21] I've been to the Grave where the white
[11:22] horse has changed every four hours where
[11:25] Muhammad a great uh priest and leader
[11:29] right after Christ was supposedly to be
[11:31] a prophet and I don't doubt for what he
[11:34] was right it's a Maccabee Brothers but
[11:36] when they he died he claimed that he had
[11:38] raised again and would conquer the whole
[11:41] world now about every four hours they
[11:43] changed guards and they keep a white
[11:45] horse at his grave they have for two
[11:47] thousand years expecting him to rise
[11:49] again and conquer the world but you see
[11:52] and you go to Buddha Buddha live
[11:55] um many hundred years about 2300 years
[11:57] ago the god of of Japan and um so he was
[12:02] a philosopher something like Confucius
[12:03] and so forth but all these four uh
[12:07] Founders and so forth all of them died
[12:10] with their philosophy and buried and in
[12:13] the grave
[12:14] but Christianity
[12:16] which is established by Jesus Christ
[12:19] there is an empty tomb
[12:21] he was the only man that ever stood on
[12:23] Earth and lived and said I have power to
[12:25] lay my life down and raise it up again
[12:28] and he did it
[12:29] and he lives today
[12:32] and we know he lives because he is with
[12:34] us and proves himself by physical signs
[12:37] and wonders that he promised that he
[12:39] would do to show it in so much as a
[12:41] pillar of fire that led the children of
[12:43] Israel through the Wilderness it's with
[12:45] us today even having his picture taken
[12:47] performing the signs and wonders that he
[12:49] promised it would do in this day seeing
[12:52] all the words that he promised being
[12:53] made Manifest this day therefore the
[12:57] rest of heathen world is out it's
[12:59] Christianity now being if there's 900
[13:01] and something questions about where God
[13:04] meets he meets with the Methodist or he
[13:06] meets in the Baptist and he meets and
[13:07] this and that the other now there's a
[13:09] question there
[13:10] so everyone has to seek out his own
[13:12] salvation with fear and trembling but
[13:14] tonight I want to try to find and prove
[13:17] in the scripture where the correct place
[13:19] is where God meets and worships with the
[13:21] people
[13:22] and if that's it that's the only place
[13:24] you'll ever meet
[13:25] now we took this text out of Deuteronomy
[13:28] it's a Greek word which uh has a
[13:31] compound meanings or it means two laws
[13:34] the Greek word Deuteronomy means two
[13:36] different laws and that's just what God
[13:40] has two different laws and one of them
[13:43] is the law of death and the other is a
[13:46] law of life
[13:47] God has two laws to follow him and serve
[13:52] him and worship him his life to reject
[13:55] it is death
[13:57] there's two laws in God now one of those
[14:00] laws was made recognized to the world at
[14:04] Mount Sinai
[14:05] God gave the law to Moses and Israel not
[14:09] if the law could help them but the law
[14:10] only pointed out to them that they were
[14:12] Sinners until that time they didn't know
[14:14] what sin was so they had a law there
[14:17] cannot be a law without a penalty a law
[14:19] is not a law without penalty so
[14:22] therefore the transgression of the law
[14:24] is sin and the wages of sin is death so
[14:28] therefore until God made them a law
[14:30] there was no uh transgression reckon to
[14:33] him if there's no law here says you
[14:35] can't run over 20 miles an hour then you
[14:37] can run over 20 miles an hour but when
[14:39] there's a law says you can't do it then
[14:41] there's a law and the penalty behind it
[14:43] now
[14:44] death or the law of death was the
[14:48] Commandments given on Mount Sinai I was
[14:51] told man that he was a sinner
[14:54] and a transgress God's law he died but
[14:58] there's no salvation in the law the it
[15:01] was only a policeman that could put you
[15:03] in jail it had nothing to bring you out
[15:05] with but then he gave another law that
[15:08] was at Mount Calvary
[15:10] where sin was reckoned in Jesus Christ
[15:13] and there the penalty was paid and not
[15:16] with without law but by Grace you are
[15:20] saved by the grace of God through
[15:22] predestination for God's foreknowledge
[15:24] of your being now we see these two laws
[15:28] Deuteronomy speaking of two laws there
[15:30] was two laws one was the law of death
[15:32] and the other in the law of Life there
[15:34] was also two covenants give to the
[15:36] people we're going to speak of them in
[15:38] the morning
[15:39] one of them was given to Adam on
[15:42] condition if you do this and don't do
[15:45] that but that law was broken Adam Eve
[15:49] broke that in the Garden of Eden then
[15:51] God made the second Covenant and give
[15:53] that to Abraham and that law was
[15:56] unconditional
[15:58] it isn't what you've done or what you
[16:00] will do he said I've already done it
[16:03] that's Grace
[16:04] That's the Law of life God
[16:07] did that for Abraham and his seed after
[16:12] him that's all of Abraham's seed as the
[16:16] Bible said all Israel will be saved but
[16:20] that don't mean Jews as Paul said that
[16:22] Israel which is inward are Israel
[16:24] outward
[16:25] outward as we spoke of other night it
[16:27] was Isaac's children by sex but the law
[16:31] of God was through Christ which was
[16:33] Abraham's Royal seed that by Grace all
[16:37] Israel is saved that's all that's in
[16:39] Christ is saying oh god's second
[16:43] Covenant but all these things
[16:45] foreshadowed Christ
[16:47] now notice the second verse the second
[16:51] verse here in Deuteronomy 16 Worship in
[16:54] the place that I have chosen
[16:58] now you must worship God he said in a
[17:00] place that I have chosen not what
[17:02] someone else chose but what I have
[17:05] chosen now if God chose the place it
[17:08] behooves us then to find out what he
[17:10] said about it amen and where is it yeah
[17:14] I want to find it because truly I want
[17:17] to worship Him
[17:18] we all are here tonight to worship him
[17:20] we're sitting here tonight as Methodist
[17:22] Baptist Catholic Jehovah Witness
[17:24] Christian Science and all but we're all
[17:27] seeking something we want to know truth
[17:30] the Bible said You shall know the truth
[17:33] and the truth shall make you free
[17:35] somebody you can't know what you're
[17:37] doing you don't know how to do it until
[17:40] you know how to do it you don't know
[17:42] what to do until you know how to do it
[17:43] rather you must know what you're doing
[17:45] and how to do it
[17:47] this Son shows us that God has a meeting
[17:50] place for his worshipers and one certain
[17:54] place and that place only God meets his
[17:57] worshipers now also the place he has
[18:01] chosen for his worshipers he claimed he
[18:04] would put his name now let's search out
[18:07] and find through the scripture where
[18:10] this place is surely if God said he had
[18:13] put his name in this place where he had
[18:14] chosen to meet the people and worship
[18:18] with them or them worship Him rather
[18:19] that is somewhere in the Bible
[18:23] for it was for all ages and the great
[18:26] unchanging God cannot change
[18:29] man changes but you can put your life
[18:32] upon anything that God ever said at any
[18:35] time because it is truth
[18:38] it is truth because that's the only
[18:41] thing I can have confidence in is the
[18:43] Bible
[18:43] because man's word will fail but God is
[18:48] supreme to this year I should know more
[18:51] than an old last year you should too
[18:53] each day we're finite so we gain
[18:55] knowledge but God is infinite
[18:58] is infinite and being infinite he cannot
[19:02] gain knowledge
[19:03] he is perfect to begin with every
[19:06] decision has to be exactly right and the
[19:11] way God acted one time he must forever
[19:13] act that way or he acted wrong when he
[19:16] act the first time
[19:18] if a man ever come to God for salvation
[19:20] upon the bases that he accepted him on
[19:22] it's got to be accepted on that same
[19:24] basis every time
[19:26] that's right
[19:27] if a man ever come to God for Divine
[19:29] Healing and God accepted him up on a
[19:32] certain base the next man comes he's got
[19:34] to accept them the same way or he did
[19:35] wrong when he accepted the first man
[19:38] God made a basis that he would meet a
[19:41] man on he made a basis at what he would
[19:44] do how he would do it and that is to the
[19:46] sacrificial blood of a lamb in the
[19:48] Garden of Eden God has never no time
[19:51] ever changed it right he decided I would
[19:54] save man we've tried today to educate
[19:57] man into it we tried to school him tried
[20:00] to educate him try to denominate try to
[20:02] do all these other kinds of things bring
[20:04] them in shake them in baptize them in
[20:05] every other way there is bring him in by
[20:07] letters but Still Remains the Same
[20:10] God beats the man under the shed blood
[20:13] of the Lamb amen amen blood was God's
[20:16] way in the beginning a blood's a God's
[20:18] way tonight
[20:19] it's good to do Penance and all these
[20:21] things but Salvation only comes through
[20:22] blood
[20:23] blood is the only way that God chose to
[20:26] save man and he cannot change it job had
[20:30] the same thing he knowed he was a
[20:31] righteous because he had offered the
[20:33] sacrifice that God had required of him
[20:36] now let us search now to see what this
[20:38] place is and a place he put his name
[20:41] we're going to have to find out where he
[20:43] put his name then if we find out what
[20:46] God's name is and where he put it then
[20:48] we got the place of worship
[20:50] as soon as we find that all these things
[20:52] of course is the shadows of things to
[20:55] come all the law was foreshadowing of
[20:57] the things to come just like the Moon is
[21:00] a shadow of the sun it serves in the
[21:03] absence of the sun just like the church
[21:05] is to serve in the absence of the s o n
[21:09] of God in the absence of the son the
[21:11] Lesser light the church the Believers
[21:13] serve God give life
[21:16] in the absence of the Sun but when the
[21:18] Sun rises you don't see the moon no more
[21:20] because it's gone down it doesn't need
[21:23] its light anymore because it only gets
[21:24] the side secondarily off the sun now
[21:27] like husband and wife the sun and moon
[21:29] is church in Christ now we find that
[21:32] these things being a shadow of Christ
[21:34] every sacrifice feast and everything in
[21:36] the Old Testament foreshadow Christ just
[21:39] as the shadow strikes across the floor
[21:41] now here's where we're going to have to
[21:43] find the correct place of worship is to
[21:46] go back here in the Old Testament where
[21:48] it was given and see what these things
[21:50] were now when a shadow comes across the
[21:54] floor you can tell whether it's man
[21:56] woman or beast or whatever it might be
[21:58] because it casts a shadow upon the floor
[22:01] and as that shadow gets shorter the
[22:04] shadow being a negative and there cannot
[22:07] be a negative without a positive
[22:09] therefore when the positive becomes
[22:12] closer to the negative the negative is
[22:14] swallowed up in the positive the Shadow
[22:16] and the and the positive comes together
[22:19] and that's what makes it then uh the
[22:22] positive and if all the old things the
[22:25] Bible said in the Old Testament were
[22:27] Shadows of the things to come then
[22:30] therefore Christ was a shadow of things
[22:34] to come
[22:35] so we can see by the Old Testament types
[22:38] where he chose to put his name and uh to
[22:42] for now now as the shadow is uh crosses
[22:46] the forest that is a negative being a
[22:48] type so we the worshipers also can see
[22:52] the Shadows of the Old Testament Fading
[22:55] Into the positive of the new now all the
[23:00] feasts the holidays all the Tabernacle
[23:03] all the wood everything in the
[23:04] Tabernacle everything type Christ all
[23:08] the offerings all the laws everything
[23:10] was a type of Christ we've been through
[23:12] it time after time here at the
[23:14] Tabernacle
[23:15] then we see by these that every Creed
[23:19] church and denomination is left far
[23:21] behind yes
[23:23] it's not even in the race at all every
[23:26] Creed every church every denomination is
[23:29] completely left out
[23:31] there's no place farm at all
