Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. We greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh surely surely a great [music] joy and a privilege for me be to be here this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to be amongst uh [music] uh believers that uh walk in the light of the hour, I think it's just a privilege. Amen. And uh so uh yes, thank you very much. Such a warm welcome. And uh I I think we uh somehow always when you meet people, you don't need very long to find out you met before. &gt;&gt; You met before somehow there's a connection. And that's so wonderful. We are not one because uh maybe we have the same skin or same color, [music] but we are one because we have the same revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; We come from the same father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what you find out very quick. So uh [music] that's just a wonderful wonderful privilege for me to be here and uh maybe short to introduce because I will not take long for that because we want to have the time in view. [music] Uh so I'm uh my name is uh Andrew Ringan. Uh Andreas or Andrew if you call it English. Uh I come from Germany, from the northern part of Germany. Sister Rebecca, actually she's my niece. You know all her, you know her. So she's my niece. And uh I come from we come from the north part of Germany. Um uh I'm uh I'm uh yeah, can I say uh husband of one wife. I think that's always important to say today. So and we have 10 10 children at home. So not at home anymore. most of them uh or quite some they left already in marriage. So, but uh we are so grateful for the Lord and uh he has blessed us with wonderful children and uh and um I'm ministering pastoring a church in the northern part of Germany for some years and we just want to say the Lord is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And greetings from each and everyone. Uh also I must bring you greetings a brother that you might not know. Uh it's a brother from Uganda, brother Steven Ibali. He just told me when you go down there uh to uh to minister for the for the people there, just greet them from me from a brother in Africa. So this is what I want to do and uh I think that's that's actually all for introduction. I think you will uh get to know me a little better as we are ministering and uh and so we are just uh and I want to thank you say thank you to brother one for uh you know for uh the the really the warm welcome and uh and uh all the things that he has done so far already uh it's just wonderful to be amongst believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Is that fine? Is it enough for introduction? &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Perfect. So then let's go straight into the word because I'm not so good in that uh in introduction and uh because something is really burning on my heart and as you have sang the songs see there sometimes it's really amazing um how the Lord is just uh orchestrating things and so I was so encouraged hearing the songs and uh you know we are all we are all uh we are all in great expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; For what the Lord uh is is doing or what the Lord has done and also expectation what the Lord is doing and how he will do things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think to me uh one of the most important things that we understand how God is doing things. &gt;&gt; Uh that God is doing things it's it's sure but how he is doing things that's the way the people miss it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because that's the way uh um you know when the the rapture will come it will be a secret going. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh you know why secret going? Because people expect it different. &gt;&gt; So when it happens because it's not according to the expectation they will miss it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it's it's so important that we really understand how God is doing things. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh and so that was such an inspiring thing to see how even the song service somehow was led in that direction. Amen. So let's turn our Bibles. And as I said, I don't want to, you know, speak long around it. Uh because I know time is always not my friend. So uh I'm I'm known as a long- winded preacher. So I don't want to ruin my reputation in the first service. So that's why we go straight to the word. First Corinthians, we want to uh open our Bibles and I have something for a Wednesday night maybe. Um uh much, but I trust we can get at least some of the highlights. Um I want to speak this evening on ready for rapture &gt;&gt; or ready for change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to speak this evening on just ready for rapture. And the question is are we? &gt;&gt; That's right. So uh and uh and I think uh I think uh it will be wonderful. First Corinthians, we want to go want to start with 1 Corinthians. We want to read uh three portions of scripture. 1 Corinthians 6, [snorts] we want to read from 9 to 11. 1 Corinthians 6 from 9 to11 we want to read and it is read like this. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themsel with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. As such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Luke 18, we want to do as another scripture. Luke 18, we want to read from 9 to4. Luke 18. We want to read from 9 to4. Amen. And we want to speak on ready for rapture. Uh ready for change. And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themsel that they were righteous and despised others. Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. The Pharisees stood there and prayed thus with himself. God, I thank thee that I'm not as other men are extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week. I give tithe of all that I possess. And the publican standing a far off would not lift up so much his eyes unto heaven, but smokeote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. &gt;&gt; I tell you that this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. &gt;&gt; For everyone that exaltth himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted. Who was rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Who was rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and just watch. He went home to his house justified. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isn't it beautiful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then one more scripture. Sorry to read a little more, but I always read them in the beginning. And I know you are uh you know, brother one, as a pastor here, you are well taught. So we can stretch our legs this evening a little bit our arms. &gt;&gt; So and I know uh I will not lose you. So we read another scripture James 5. We want to read James 5 16-18. James 5:16-18. I thought that's so so uh wonderful how that's how how James will will bring it out or it comes out here. Uh and just just shortly back that one man went justified home. &gt;&gt; That was the Bible said, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Confess your faults one to to the other and pray one for the other that me ye may be healed. The effectual favor favoring prayer of a righteous man &gt;&gt; avail much. &gt;&gt; And now now very very beautiful. Watch how the scripture how James brings a type in here. Elias was a man subject to like passion as we are. And he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. And it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it amazing how James is bringing Elias in &gt;&gt; a man that is subject under like passions that we are. &gt;&gt; That means he faced the same trouble that we are facing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we just uh it's such a great privilege, Father, to live in this hour. Oh God, we have not deserved it. We have not worked for it, but it was your great merciful plan, Father. And we are so grateful for that that we can live in this hour in the in the most dangerous days and hours that ever was there and the most glorious time that ever was there, Father. And we pray this evening as we look into your word, may you unveil yourself. I pray, Father, forgive us for all our shortcomings. Forgive us for everything that we thought wrong and did wrong. Father just forgive us we pray and may each and everyone walk out this evening like that man ready for rapture. Father I pray thee that you will be with us father in the service &gt;&gt; anoint your word anoint the speaker anoint the those who are listening uh here present and on stream. I pray father that your holy spirit may go and may be there and unveil and reveal himself and your word as we are listening to your word. And we ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just want to this was something that was was really um as I was reading it and uh and as I'm um as as we are really approaching I believe we approaching uh the the that day uh and uh what is always somewhere on our mind you know we see the uh modern events how they take how they take care or how they are happening modern events that uh you know were made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But today it's not modern events made clear by prophecy, but it's modern events made clear as they happen. &gt;&gt; They were once prophecy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's not prophecy anymore. So many events are fulfilled in our days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So we're living in the hour where those prophecies are are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As they are fulfilling and and you are here also in a country where many things the prophet would speak about. You you all know that he spoke about the second the second Catholic president and so on. He spoke about the pope and so on and so many things that he spoke of as prophecies are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? They are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So they are not just made plain by prophecy but they are made plain as they has happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, and that to me makes it makes it more evident that really let's say it if if you take the bright picture, the rapture or the change actually uh is is is just must be very close must be very near, right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; The the the rapture as we know is a process but but the change of the body because this is actually the final stage of the the rapture which will be this the the change of our bodies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We still believe in the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so happy that these bodies will be changed uh in one of these days. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as it as we are waiting or not waiting but as we are expecting actually that happening we should be under under an expectation under something that is thrilling us because we are living in a time where where people don't have to die but they will be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye &gt;&gt; right so and not only one but a [clears throat] whole group of people &gt;&gt; I mean this is amazing you know how God is constructing and orchestrating it. That is not your only only one person as we always had them uh but uh but a whole group of people will be ready at the same time, &gt;&gt; right? Will be ready at the same time and God is able to manage that all over the world. &gt;&gt; So if you are in the states or we are in Europe or you are somewhere in the bush in Africa, I'm much in Africa traveling. So uh and you can see it's I mean this is a masterpiece of God's great plan and orchestration &gt;&gt; how he is able to get a a whole group ready for a body change. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we understand the body change will not be one week this and after three years that one but it will be in a in a certain amount of time. It will be very close together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so, so as we are looking at it and it becomes more amazing the more turbulent the whole situation and scene becomes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; It becomes more of of really you can see it will be the hand of the Lord. It's not orchestrated by men. This is not organized by men. &gt;&gt; This is God must be the organizer of this. That's right. Because in this what we have today, you understand man will never organize it. &gt;&gt; Man has never been able to organize this. &gt;&gt; Amen. When it all comes together, you know, even if we have modern media, we can communicate with one another, we cannot we cannot organize orchestrate that. So it is the sovereign hand of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to read you a statement of the prophet what what he I mean he he said it in in in Balam and in in in Gilead in 19 uh I think it's 1959. Brother Random said speaking about you know the change and then he's speaking about the faith and and then brother makes interesting statement. He said he said uh you just say uh when I go home you know when you drive home he said I got home and out and start the car that's all an act of faith rel said &gt;&gt; he said tomorrow I will meet uh you in a certain place that's all an act of faith &gt;&gt; because you have you you have just done it so much because it had become a regular routine with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, that's the way the things of God are. &gt;&gt; After you have trusted him and watched him do so many things, it becomes like a regular routine. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the condition I think the church will be just before the coming of the Lord. So the rapture will just go right on in the same way. It will be just a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I found this very amazing statement of the prophet how he how he said that the rapture you know when the the change of the body it will be a normal day. It will be normal life regular routine. So that means you don't need to try to be somebody special. &gt;&gt; That's right. to be to be changed or to be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; You don't need to act extraordinary to be ready. &gt;&gt; You understand? The prophet would really try to and most of the time is actually is actually hindering you to be ready. If you are trying to be somebody that you are not, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Random would many times say, don't try to be somebody special. Don't try to be somebody that is maybe your star or he said be what you are because God needs you the way he made you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He needs each and everyone the way he he made us. He orchestrated us. You know he planned you. You know that he he planned you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother would say that the the that the birth is more mysterious than the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the virgin birth actually was very simple. God just had to create that act and that sperm and that's it. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to you, God had to put put much more effort in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he had to plan and pre-plan and really orchestrate and and things from generations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that you finally at the end of the day use it here now. &gt;&gt; So and if he put so much effort in your coming that [clears throat] means he he has something he has a plan with you. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has a plan with you. So don't try to be somebody else. Don't try to be somebody that you are not. Don't try to be somebody special to go in the rapture that you are not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will be it will be a regular routine. the rapture will be. &gt;&gt; It will be. It will be. And so it's that's always that's always stirred me. Uh and and as as we understand this this really this day is approaching and uh and how how you know as as as a pastor also of a church, how how to get the people ready? How to be ready yourself? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How to get the people ready. You understand? How to how to be ready? uh because we we don't really it can be overnight. We understand that before we wake up in the morning the thing could be done. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand that right? &gt;&gt; So we still believe that &gt;&gt; you know and it will be it will be in a in a time when people when when maybe we feel it's not a good time to be to to that it comes &gt;&gt; you know so but God is not interested in what we think God is interested in fulfilling his plan. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that's why in an hour when when we not might not think it or not then the thing will happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; So so and and as as we really are looking for for to be ready for rapture rapture ready how that state is how will God orchestrate that worldwide you understand worldwide so that we at the same hour at the same time. My goodness, what kind of a program must God have? &gt;&gt; You know, what kind of what kind of organiz you know, but many times we underestimate the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, because because you know, you know, we sometimes we hardly get a you know, a unity in a family how he will get a unity amongst the believers. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; But but but what I what I came to understand is it might be this is what I have learned many times. It comes different than I think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it's nothing wrong with God is something wrong with my way of thinking and with my approach and with my expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So and that's what I learned. So I just always pray that Lord help me to to have the right kind of expectation &gt;&gt; to have the right kind of goal that I don't miss as it happens &gt;&gt; because I don't want to lo miss the joy of being present when it happens. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I believe the bride of Jesus Christ especially especially because she is she is married to him and brother Bunn would say that the the bridegroom he's interested now in sharing the secret to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I think she he is somehow introducing it to the bride so that she can be happy that she can be exciting as she see it happening. So I believe we will walk in our body change with open eyes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we walk in I believe that we walk into a body change with open eyes expecting it to happen. And when the dead in Christ shall come will come it will be a surprise but we we will not be shocked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because somehow we expect them right somehow we expect them. &gt;&gt; Yet I think we will be surprised and absolutely surprised the way they look like. But but but you expect them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and let's let me read first first Thessalonians. I want to read that again maybe because that is actually the hour that we are approaching. Uh 1 Thessalonians 4. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Therefore, comfort one another with these words." &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand that we're living in the time we brother plainly would say that the shout is the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we speak, we don't go this evening there, you know, seeing I went at home a little with the church and the voice of the archangel, Brother said only Christ can be the voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said Christ and and so the the the the the the voice of the archangel and the trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first. And then brother said, you all know the quote in in in the rapture message, brother said he Jesus does all things, three things as he's descending. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so and and surely we have people have their understanding how will it be when the great archangel you know cries with a loud voice. It will be a loud voice, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and so people have their own understandings, their imaginations how things are and and and then then the trump of God the trump of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise. So, so you understand each and everyone has has their own picture how uh you know how that will be and that's the way many times we miss it. &gt;&gt; That's the way many times we miss things in the days of Jesus. You know how much they missed it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because they had a different expectation. &gt;&gt; It came in such a unusual way that they missed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the prophet told us he told us he said it will be this time again it will be so simple people will just simply miss it &gt;&gt; because of the simplicity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But but as we are as we are um as we are approaching that hour and I and we understand brother Adam could say the shout is the message &gt;&gt; together the people together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said and then the voice and the trump as I said this evening we don't go to details. We don't want that. But to understand it is happening or it must happening. It must happen amongst us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are about that the dead in Christ shall rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So the dead in Christ shall rise because they they rise because of the the loud voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of the trump of God. And we understand the prophet would let us know that a trumpet in itself can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prophet said a trumpet is a mute thing unless somebody plays it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So the trump of God in itself is a mute thing unless he plays it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So but it must happen somehow somewhere before the dead in Christ rise. Okay? &gt;&gt; Because as we have read, as we have heard, the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they we understand that they are that they wait on the other side. As Paul would say to the Hebrews, they are waiting on us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Without us, they cannot be made &gt;&gt; perfect. &gt;&gt; Perfect. That means without us, without us. Come on, church. without us. &gt;&gt; They still have to wait. &gt;&gt; But when this church is ready, &gt;&gt; when this church is ready, &gt;&gt; and God can do with the church what he is intended for, &gt;&gt; then the dead in Christ shall come first, rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So actually God is just waiting on me and on you to be ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's right to be ready. Now what do we have to do to be ready? It's as I say it's puzzling always to people what what must I do to be ready you know what can I do to be ready and we understand that's why I've read the scripture of Luke 18 there was a man and seemingly he was he was he was he was a man that that understood there was not everything in his life was right right &gt;&gt; but yet he he said actually that man actually said Lord have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he went justified home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we understand &gt;&gt; that attitude is maybe more important than we think. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Actually, brother Adam said it is your attitude that presents you before God. &gt;&gt; That's your attitude that present not what you can do, but you want to what you want to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and we understand allow allow me maybe shortly to to stay there. Brother Benham said you know many times we we know the the statement of the prophet that the right mental attitude &gt;&gt; of any promise of God will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; But then brother make also another statement. He said it is not your mental attitude that brings it to pass. It is not your mental attitude that brings it to pass &gt;&gt; because it is your right mental attitude towards the one that brings it to pass. &gt;&gt; He said if so that means if you keep your right mental attitude towards God &gt;&gt; then he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; So it's not our mental attitude that produces this. So don't try to be don't stress your mental attitude. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, don't do that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; just be simple enough. Have the right kind of attitude &gt;&gt; towards God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Towards God. Anything then he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I think sometimes it's so important that the people understand how to relax in the right way. &gt;&gt; Because we have to today we are mental we are so under pressure under fire the whole world brother Anna would say it will be a mental sick institution actually. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the mental pressure is rising. Yes. &gt;&gt; Constantly. &gt;&gt; And you have to understand that you are more than your mental condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to understand that you are living in a dying body and in a dying spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The body ch the change will not only be your body but also your human spirit will be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it needs a change, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So attitude is it's it's very very very I think it's very important and very simple also you understand that and this man had just had the right attitude he just SAID LORD BE MERCIFUL to me THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS ALL &gt;&gt; YES amen &gt;&gt; isn't it amazing &gt;&gt; that was all &gt;&gt; that man went justified home &gt;&gt; and the other man that had his life or that was not in that maybe his genes was a little bit different. &gt;&gt; You understand? So, so he for for some people it's easy to stop smoking. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; For some not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I remember when I was young, I tried to STOP SMOKING. I COULDN'T STOP. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because I couldn't. &gt;&gt; And I had I had OTHER FRIENDS. THEY COULD STOP. And I said, "My goodness, what what a cursed person I am." understand that helped me that I needed him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand I needed him. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, I need you. I cannot do it by myself." &gt;&gt; And you understand if you if you have things that you know you cannot you cannot overcome yourself or or then you know you need him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That you just you need him &gt;&gt; and as you know you need him, you are in a right condition for rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I think it's I think it's it's beautiful how it is done and and and and and brother Vandom would really say that and and watch in the Bible. Watch in the Bible. We have we have four we have four women in the Bible where really where really um the attitude becomes very very obvious how important that is. The one the first one we want to just touch is Eve. Uh, you know, Eve is was was a woman. She had she had she was the right womb &gt;&gt; and she received the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the product was Cain. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So you can be the right womb. &gt;&gt; If you receive the wrong seed, &gt;&gt; you will bring forth something evil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Satan hunts you &gt;&gt; because he knows you are the right womb. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's why Satan I want to say that again. That's why Satan hunts you because he knows you are the right womb. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That same womb brought forth Cain brought forth Abel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the next the next woman we want to see which which which I think is very nice. It's Hagar. Hagar was the wrong womb &gt;&gt; in the right seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so Eve had was the right womb in the wrong seat. &gt;&gt; Hagar was the wrong woman in the right seat. What was the result? &gt;&gt; A man that could not be controlled. &gt;&gt; Right. You with me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Was I Israel the seed of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; But it was just the wrong womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you have the the right womb, wrong seat. Then you have the wrong womb, the right seat. Then we comes then we come to Sarah. &gt;&gt; Sarah was the right womb and she had the right seat. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She brought forth Isaac. &gt;&gt; That was But that man died. But there's another woman in the Bible. &gt;&gt; There's another woman in the Bible. Her name is Mary. She was the right womb. &gt;&gt; She received the right seat. &gt;&gt; And what was the difference to Sarah? &gt;&gt; See, didn't die. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; The se the difference to Sarah was Mary had the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where Sarah actually said, "Me, an old woman." &gt;&gt; Sarah said, "It be to be according to your word." &gt;&gt; Just the right attitude. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brought forth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the right attitude brought forth Jesus Christ. So we we understand that's and that's why brother Bam said church age book the word is in the bride as it was &gt;&gt; in &gt;&gt; Mary &gt;&gt; not in Sarah &gt;&gt; not in Eve &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; not in Hagar the word is in the bride as it was in Mary &gt;&gt; showing how important the right attitude will be at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; It's amazing. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing how we can be ready? Very simple. &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Just keep the right attitude towards any promise of God. Just keep the right attitude towards the rapture. Just keep the right attitude to the body change. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So, so you understand? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What shall we do to be ready for the rapture? &gt;&gt; What kind of expectation do we have? &gt;&gt; When is the church ready for rapture? Speak of this little local church. What? How would you think that people that go in the rapture will be shining lighting out of this little group here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Oh, that mean ah that guy is ready for rapture or that sister's ready for rapture. How will it be? [laughter] &gt;&gt; I trust we can say praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You understand? Are we ret? Well, if it was a good day, yes. A bad day, no. No. God is not running his business like this. &gt;&gt; I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is not depending on your mental stage for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a for me it's a it's a wonderful thing. And uh and so as I as I was pondering and and then brother listen listen what he what he what he's in Christ the mystery of God he makes a again a very amazing a very amazing statement about the the coming the change of the body or the rapture in itself. Listen what brother said. I know you have read it maybe many times. Uh but as I even with our own church at home sometimes you know the things that the the um modern events bring things out what brother Brandham said to a new light. &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; absolutely to a new light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. things that happening around us for me many times bring things brother Brandham because you know we have we are as message believers we are used to quote brother Brandham &gt;&gt; and if we are really faithful we say what the prophet said &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but I I really want also to to um maybe allow us to to ponder about how can we really say what brother Brennan said &gt;&gt; if we don't see what he saw &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; we just become parents &gt;&gt; repeating &gt;&gt; you know I trust it it doesn't bother someone &gt;&gt; you're not called to be parents &gt;&gt; that's right Paul said Paul said Brother Brandham said, Brother Ram said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham spoke something, he saw something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's you know, when you really want to repeat me, really want to say what I say, you have to see what I see. &gt;&gt; Is it right? Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's why the bride of Jesus Christ today is called to see &gt;&gt; what brother Renan saw. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; John, come up hither. &gt;&gt; Come up hither. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And John said, "And I come and I came hither and I saw &gt;&gt; for myself." &gt;&gt; And when you see for yourself, then you can quote, right? &gt;&gt; Remember, Satan is very good in quoting &gt;&gt; the scripture. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he's very good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What do you do when Satan throws the truth at you? &gt;&gt; As he did with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was That was a temptation by the way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was a temptation by the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where Satan said, "It is written." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is written. &gt;&gt; And how did Jesus answer? He was not disqualifying the scripture. He was not even putting uh some commands to it. He said it is also written. &gt;&gt; That was his answer. &gt;&gt; You know why Jesus could say that? &gt;&gt; Because he saw &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He saw what it was when it was spoken. It is written. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe really as we as we go on and we we we see we we uh we see where the prophet is modern events as the Holy Spirit is still present and the five-foot ministry is doing their what their work what they have to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the five foot ministry is doing this is this you don't get just by listening to tapes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sorry to say so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not what you because I I I I I meet people they listen to tapes all the days of their life &gt;&gt; and they don't know you know you know we have a wonderful example in the scripture it's it everything is nothing new under the sun you know that &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that's what the Bible said &gt;&gt; so in the time of Jesus we had faithful tapelessness &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that missed everything &gt;&gt; called the disciples of John, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They called even themselves. We They were the disciples of John. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What were they? They followed John, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They followed the the forerunner. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Paul met them in the upper coast of Ephesus after 30 years, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; later, &gt;&gt; Paul asked him, "Hey, did do have you received the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; They said, "What Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, this was the group that was very true to the forerunner, &gt;&gt; stayed with what he said, &gt;&gt; recoted him every day, &gt;&gt; listened to it. Sorry when I say that. listen to a tape every day and missed it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Totally. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What God was doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; So, we are INVITED AS A BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. COME ON. BROTHER RANOM IS GONE. But but brother even made those statements. He said, "Two of us cannot be at the same time." &gt;&gt; If that is true that he is here now, then I must decrease and he must increase. &gt;&gt; Who is that? He that's Christ himself. &gt;&gt; That's Christ himself. Not not another prophet, not another messenger. Yet it is the messenger of all messengers. But because the messenger of the church age always was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and let me drop that little in just to think about just to understand also what what happened at the end of Laia. Do we believe we live in the end of Lisia? &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we don't know. We we don't put it we don't put a time to it, you know. Is it is is it now 1977 or was it later or you know we are not the shortest age anymore anyhow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Up just a few years I think it was two or three years ago was still the shortest but now Ephesus is the shortest. Uhhuh. So is Ludicia over? Are we in Ludicia still? &gt;&gt; Amen. But this is not what I want to do. We don't want to go in numbers this evening. &gt;&gt; Uh because we are not found in the book of numbers. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But rather allow me to say brother make a very amazing statement. Let me read that before we go here. Brother said you know it's God's great mystery of how is a secret. He kept it secret. Nobody knew about his coming. Even the ages didn't understand it. That's the reason why under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence. Uh you know and when they asked Jesus when he was here when it will be he said not even the son knows. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When &gt;&gt; right when. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And brother said the when and the how is a great secret. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. The when and the how is a great secret. But to me, the when is not so important anymore. &gt;&gt; To me, the how became much more important &gt;&gt; because I don't know. I don't care when it happens. &gt;&gt; It's important to me that I see how it happens. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are with me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if it is now this year or next year or over next year or over next year, I don't care. It comes when the Lord has put his time plan. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to see how it is happening. &gt;&gt; Then I'm a part of it. &gt;&gt; Then I'm not waiting for the rapture. Then I am the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember all I think it was a prophet speaking of that that old fellow that came to church one day and the church was in a total mess and uproar and everybody was totally confused because somebody I don't know if if if there was a vision or a dream or whatever and they has they they had made up their mind in the church the rapture has taken place and they are left behind and here that old old brother I think brother Adam is the story of the prophet that he tells that old man came into the church I think he said he was a old color brother came into the church and he said, "What are you so so so yeah have not heard it? The rapture has taken place and and the the bride's gone and we're left behind." He said, "That's not possible." &gt;&gt; He said, "HOW HOW DO YOU KNOW?" HE I SPOKE to him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he never said me nothing about &gt;&gt; you understand what what IF YOU KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED, how it happening, nothing can disturb. &gt;&gt; Amen. because you were a part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But and really really just only to drop that shortly in I might go in when I go to a higher I might go a little deeper into it to brother Chad Lamb we go there because it's something that really puzzled not puzzled me but really gave me so much light that we understand really who is here right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Who is present with us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke of someone when he said my ministry is to declare him that he is here now. He was not speaking of the Holy Ghost that was there through the church ages. &gt;&gt; That was right. &gt;&gt; But now somebody is here. Brother Wan said, &gt;&gt; right? And and so he I said I'm laying the platform not for a new messenger, not for another messenger, not for a great man, but for for the Holy Ghost himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now allow me few minutes, just a few minutes only to lighten that up. is we understand that brother Brandham was the the messenger to the Lysian churches. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; We understand that Paul was the messenger to Ephesus. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; We understand Arinius was the messenger to Smyrna. &gt;&gt; We understand Martin was the messenger to Pergamon. We understand Columbus was the messenger to Tyara. We understand Luther was the messenger to the Zadis Zadian church age. We understand Wesley was the messenger to the Philadelphiaian church age. I asked you a question. When is the messenger coming? When is the messenger coming? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Wen would say the messenger is always coming at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, did brother Venom came at the end of Lisia? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Very very very just just give me a few minutes you will understand who came at the end of Ludicia is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Luther didn't came at the end of Ephesus. Luther came at the end at the end of Judaism, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And started the churches of heaven, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh, Paul, sorry, Paul. Thank you very much. Arinius didn't come at the end of Arinius come at the end of Ephesus. Brother Brandham, when did brother Renom came? Brother Ram came at the end of Philadelphia as Philadelphia was closing here the prophet came right Philadelphia was 1750 to 1906 and brother Renham was born 1909. &gt;&gt; Brother Renom made the statement the messenger always comes at the end of the old age. Just for us to ponder who is present right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just to ponder who is present right now. &gt;&gt; Who who came? Why did brother because it was now the end of Laudisia was coming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then we understand the great happening in the life that changed brother Renham's ministry so much. You understand that? &gt;&gt; That changed his ministry. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And he was the church age messenger all the way through. But he WAS MORE THAN JUST the church age messenger. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He had more ministries. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; He had the he had the Moses ministry to bring the people out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he also had the Joshua ministry to bring the people in. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; So we see in that that's why we see a change in the ministry of William Brham. So it was not SO MUCH MORE HIM BUT IT WAS NOW Christ in him &gt;&gt; in such a different way than it was in the beginning. Is that right? Come on church. &gt;&gt; It was in the be you know just read what the messenger is telling to the Louise church age. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a MESSAGE HE HE BRINGS TO THE CHURCH AGE. &gt;&gt; And then watch how the prophet would say the Holy Spirit woke me up one night and he told me you pick up the pen and write now. Amen. &gt;&gt; So then BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY WAS writing something that the Holy Spirit himself dictated him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the messenger of all messengers was present. Now &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand in what we are confronted all those years something that will maybe uh quite enlightened me very much. You can study it. You can go home and really look it up. For me it was so I was I was shocked actually when I found that out as as studying the messengers. We know about the messenger Cola. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. If you study his life, it was Columba from France according to the prophet &gt;&gt; and you know the Holy Spirit how the Holy Spirit vindicated as the prophet was looking for the messengers &gt;&gt; how the Holy Spirit vindicated &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; Mr. Let let me call him Mr. Columba never lived one day in the church age that he was messenger to. He was born before his church age started and he died before his church age started. I found that amazing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I found that amazing just to show the principle that the messenger always comes at the end of the former. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why William Brham the message to the churches of Lisia came at the end of Philadelphia &gt;&gt; to open up. Come on church &gt;&gt; to open up the new church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So who came at the end of Ludicia? &gt;&gt; It was Christ &gt;&gt; in William &gt;&gt; Brandon. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You see the change of the ministry in his ministry. &gt;&gt; To really understand where we are at. So this is NOT JUST BROTHER RANDOM SAID NOW IT'S Christ &gt;&gt; dealing with the church &gt;&gt; now IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF DEALING WITH the believers &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's why brother Adam could say I must decrease and he must increase I ask you a question has he increased &gt;&gt; SEE MANY TIMES BROTHER BRANDHAM HAS increased But has Christ increased? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; We should not just allow brother Random to increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We should Christ to increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother said, "I have to go." Do you know that brother Renham said to the people around him, he said to some, he said, you know, "As long as I am still with you, I will be always here and you will be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "But when I'm gone, &gt;&gt; you come up to where I am." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was it not with Jesus? The same way. One day Jesus told his disciple, "It is expedient for me to leave you." &gt;&gt; You know why? Because Jesus was tired &gt;&gt; of the disciples depending on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, one day when they was feeding the multitude of people, then after a long service, everybody was a little nervous. You know, the service is very long and the people, you know, so many 5,000 I think it were. So, they were a little nervous and they preached very long. You know, they need to go, they need to go home shopping and eating. And Jesus said, "No, no, they don't need to go." Jesus told them, "You make them sit and you give them to eat." &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus was saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Jesus said no no no not I will give them you give them to eat so the ability was there for them &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; to do it &gt;&gt; but because of Jesus was there they wouldn't look at it &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's why Jesus said it is expedient for me that I go &gt;&gt; hallelujah how expedient it was that brother Brandham went &gt;&gt; come on church &gt;&gt; it was expedient him to leave the scene &gt;&gt; because now he Christ had increase. &gt;&gt; Where is he increasing? He's increasing in you and in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then then don't worry about rapture. Don't worry about ready for rapture. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; I'm not worrying about the rapture. &gt;&gt; I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; And I don't say that proudly. &gt;&gt; I don't say that arrogant. I say, but I know what God has done. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and brother Adam said he he said Christ the mystery. He said he has showed and revealed it in every type that is in the Bible. Therefore, the Bible is a revelation of God's great mystery. The anti Bible is the expression of go one great goal that God had and and he wanted to achieve in the Bible. And all the acts of the believers in the Bible has been a type and expressing what God's great goal is. and the last day has revealed and showed it. So you understand? So even even about the the change and the rapture, the going, God has showed it, brother said in the types of the Bible. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; And so I I when I when it comes to rapture ready, &gt;&gt; I I I I I said, "Lord, okay, uh I just want to see in the Bible what it was when people was raptured. &gt;&gt; What it meant to them to be ready." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. what it meant to them &gt;&gt; because we had gladly we had a prophet and the prophet told us there was three raptures in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there's three pointed out in the New. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we are actually rapture number five. &gt;&gt; Right. Number six, we understand will be Moses and Elijah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just maybe start from the end. Maybe just start from the end &gt;&gt; because that will be after the bride is gone. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; SO, MOSES AND ELIJAH, how you know, HOW CAN WE FIND OUT IF they're ready to be raptured? What is their condition before they are raptured? Come on. &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL BE THEIR STATE OF being before they are raptured? Who knows that they will be they lay dead in the streets of Raleam, &gt;&gt; murdered, killed. Huh? &gt;&gt; Killed by what? Killed by the system. That's right. The whole world will will make a big feast when those two terrorists will lay in the streets of Jerusalem. Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. This what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you would see them laying dead in the in in Jerusalem, would you think they are rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that we understand what it means to be rapture ready &gt;&gt; because there you can find &gt;&gt; you the key that you understand when you are ready for rapture &gt;&gt; you're still with me &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I we started from the end because to me it is striking you can you imagine they get they don't murder themselves they get killed &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so that means that means means they don't have the power and the strength to withstand that. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; they do great miracles. Is it right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They do before great miracles, &gt;&gt; but now it looks like strange left them. Hello. &gt;&gt; Are we still awake? Wednesday night. I know. BUT &gt;&gt; NOW YOU UNDERSTAND IF THEY WOULD BE RAPTURED AS THEY'RE PERFORMING MIRACLES. OH YEAH. Easy go. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW THEY THEY DEAD IN THE STREET. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; Are they rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Yes, they were. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; They are rapture READY YET LAYING DEAD IN THE STREET. &gt;&gt; OKAY. &gt;&gt; KILLED BY THE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; OKAY. Brother said he has showed the things in the types and the characters of the believers of the Bible. &gt;&gt; So we can understand what it means to be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU'RE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN, YOU FEEL YOU'RE rapture ready. But what if if you are low in the valley? That's right. &gt;&gt; Facing death, &gt;&gt; facing cancer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you rapture ready? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe we are further than we think. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't it amazing how God is doing things? &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's let's really let's really look let's really look a little bit at two the other ones of the Old Testament because it becomes very plain, very plain what it means to be to be rapture ready. The first one that was raptured, everyone I think knows knows the message. It was Enoch. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Enoch. No. One thing that is very when I was a young Christian, I always felt it's not just fair &gt;&gt; that there's so little written about Enoch. &gt;&gt; You know, he was the one that the first one that was actually raptured, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we don't we do not know so many things about him, right? &gt;&gt; We don't know what he has done or what he has not done. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So I said in the big I said Lord why can I not read what he has done and not done to know what it is &gt;&gt; God told me is because it's not your life. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the first one was Enoch. We understand what we know about him. He was the seventh from Adam. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was the seventh from Adam. If you can count, you can see he was the seventh from Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we understand, we are the seventh from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We are the seventh from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; So that's why Enoch is actually one of the the major types for the rapture for us because he was the seventh from the first Adam. &gt;&gt; And brother Venom would say seventh church age, the seventh from the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right? This is who we are. &gt;&gt; So quickly quickly about Enoch. Is that okay when I read you a few things about Enoch? &gt;&gt; But brother Venom said about him. &gt;&gt; Uh again some things you don't cannot read black and white in the Bible but brother Venom said it &gt;&gt; and uh I'm not comparing the Bible and then brother Venom finding out who is the truth. A prophet is given when a prophet says something, it is not to to contradict the Bible but to to make the Bible more plain to us. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because so many times a scripture has a compound meaning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And how many times we limit it just to one meaning. Is that right? If we limit a scripture to one meaning, we miss 50%. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful things about Enoch uh we don't go into into numbers into into accountings but we understand Noah and Enoch if you really look at it they didn't know one another there was 70 years gap between Noah and Enoch right &gt;&gt; if you study you will find out &gt;&gt; it's very easy actually you can see the numbers when he was born so when when Noah was born Enoch was not there for quite 60 or 70 years and yet brotherham that that Enoch and Noah knew one another. This is what brotherham said. &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, I I read to you you can read it. Third seal, first seal in in different different statements." Brother Wam said, "Let me read third seal." He said, "Just like Noah kept watching Enoch. And when Enoch went, Noah said, "Better get close to the ark. The time is at hand." Noah kept watching Enoch. first seal. What was it like Enoch? You know, Noah watched Enoch. For when Enoch come up missing, he knowed judgment was at hand. He's got he was now hanging around the ark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's something special about Enoch like there's something special about the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THAT YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN. The Bible tells us in Genesis 5 that Enoch walked with God how many years 365. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible said and he was we read it in a couple of minutes. If you take brother Brham he only said Enoch walked 500 years with God &gt;&gt; only. And I have all the quotes printed out. It's dozens of them. He said in a work with God 500 years from the top to the bottom. He never said 365. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get confused now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what is WHAT WHAT IS BROTHER TRYING TO DO? Trying to understand that Noah that Enoch was a special man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the BRIDE OF CHRIST WAS SPECIAL. SO THE RAPTURE will be special. &gt;&gt; The change will be different than we think. Okay. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Oh, we are so privileged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we had a prophet introducing to us that the whole body change will not be a mystery to us. &gt;&gt; So we we understand what is going on with us and we are we changed already? Yes. We are not what we want to be but we are not what we were. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why we ARE CHANGED FROM GLORY unto glory. As we look to the right kind of picture, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When we look to the right kind of picture, WE WILL BE changed into the same image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's that's so beautiful about about Enoch. So So and then brother Rand makes statements like that. He he he he said when God said to Noah to Enoch one day he said Enoch walking after accepting in 63 accepting God's provided way Enoch after walking 500 years with God and God told him Enoch you're not going you you're not going to have to die you want to come up home are you homesick Enoch he said yeah Lord I'm homesick &gt;&gt; he said you understand &gt;&gt; Enoch was had the same feelings like we have sometimes Are you sometimes homesick? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you sometimes sick? &gt;&gt; I've still been here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Enoch was. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Have you walked in this pedest house down there long enough?" He said, "Yes." He said, "All right, just start walking." Enoch needed a leather. God give him a highway. That was God's way for him. It provided him. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; I'm not LOOKING FOR A LEATHER BECAUSE GOD HAD PLACED ME ON THE HIGHWAY. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly quickly together to I know that's for a Wednesday. I know that's maybe a little a little, you know, much, but I trust you. You know, sometimes when you have good food, store it quickly. &gt;&gt; Put it in place so you can eat it later. Okay? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Don't throw it away. Just put it in a place you can you can you will enjoy it later. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go quickly to Genesis 5. &gt;&gt; Genesis 5. And you will see how much it is a type on what is happening in our day. Enoch. So, Enoch was a man like you are. &gt;&gt; Enoch had his mood swings like you have. &gt;&gt; Enoch had his ups. Enoch had his downs. &gt;&gt; You know why? How I know that? Because I have my ups and I have my downs. &gt;&gt; Let's read the Genesis 5. Uh Genesis Genesis 5. You want to read quickly? Beautiful. Genesis 5. Um, and all the days of Enoch were 360 and five years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what happening to Enoch was that God took him. Right? Now, now allow me to just only very short go to because then you understand that to Enoch happened what happened to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now our body is not changed yet. We still here. We are waiting for the body change. But you understand according to Romans, Paul said the body change is the last step. The final step of redemption is the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; That's the final stage of adoption is the change of our body. &gt;&gt; But adoption is more than just the change of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and listen how beauty you can read it. You can find it out yourself. Oh. Uh and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. That word God took him. You know what that means? That means in the I think it is in the in the Hebrew or the Greek one of them it means to select &gt;&gt; to take to select to take possession of &gt;&gt; to take in marriage. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Well, we understand it is a husband taking a wife. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And when a man takes a woman, he takes her out of her own family. She receives a new name as he is taking her. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Amen. So with other words, there was a marriage taking place &gt;&gt; between God and Enoch. &gt;&gt; Is there a marriage taking place in this hour? &gt;&gt; Is there a marriage taking place? Come on. William Brandon was what? Revelations 10 is actually a marriage. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1 IS WHAT? IS CHRIST HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Can I call him the bridegroom? Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; There you see Christ himself. Then you see Revelation 10:7 is the marriage counselor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where's the bride go? &gt;&gt; The bride IS A TYPE JOHN THE TYPE OF THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; That's Revelation 10:8-11. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So Revelation 10 actually is a marriage that takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the same thing that happened to Enoch IS HAPPENING TO THE CHURCH TODAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF, CHRIST HIMSELF CAME DOWN AND HE TOOK A WIFE. THAT'S WHY BROTHER ADAM SAID, "It is the invisible union of the bride of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We understand that. &gt;&gt; So if I WANT TO KNOW WHO ENOCH WAS, WHAT ENOCH DID, I have to &gt;&gt; look who I am. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So don't be depressed when you are depressed. &gt;&gt; DON'T FEEL DON'T DON'T DON'T LET THE DEVIL GET YOU MORE DOWN WHEN YOU'RE DEPRESSED. &gt;&gt; I would doubt my doubts. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We can cause in this hour we can cause the devil a heart attack &gt;&gt; because finally brother don't know what to do with the church. &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; Where have we come to with this message? Where have we come to? We are believer of the message. I say at home many times 60 years we have this message. What have we come to? &gt;&gt; Because if we have the message we have a message and the message is not God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That's not the message. &gt;&gt; No. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. If somebody is there that tells you here's a message, &gt;&gt; then you want to know what the message is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't come with phrases. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we have a message. WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; What is the message? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's that was that was Enoch. Let's let's let's quickly go uh if we little time we need to go to the second and to the third. The second that was raptured was was Elijah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Was Elijah. Is that right? A man &gt;&gt; of &gt;&gt; like same &gt;&gt; passion &gt;&gt; passion as we are. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful. It's stated in James, right? &gt;&gt; So the Elijah was of Come on. Come on. He was was the same. You can imagine what what what what kind of person Elijah was &gt;&gt; and and you understand to what kind of of swings he went in his life. We know even the scripture reads about it. We read it very very very close and then we see also the mistakes that he did. &gt;&gt; Elijah did mistakes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we in our walk sometimes we just do mistakes and make situations worse. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Never change the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I saw that, I said, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; GOD IS NOT DEPENDING ON MY SKILL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God is the rapture is not depending if I feel good. &gt;&gt; Actually, brother is preaching the rapture. Remember how he was reading Psalm 27 as a start of the rapture message? And he said, "You will be amazed." He said, "What I'm reading, maybe you're a little bit confused the way I'm starting." He said, "But you will find out it will be exactly the way that I tell you." &gt;&gt; Psalm 27 is right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You all know what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible said, "In time of great trouble, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; the brother said, I just want to lay a platform, a background for the rapture." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, it will be in time of great trouble, he shall set me upon the rock. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, read Psalm 27:1-5. This was brother Ram's scripture for the rapture message. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was he was he was the second one. That was Elijah, as we have read in in in James 5, a man of like passions. That means in the Greek, of like feelings and like affections. That was Elijah. That was Elijah. A man that was raptured. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That was Elijah. A man of So with with other words, if you come to Elijah one of the one of the days and you tell him what you went through, he said, "I know I went through the same stuff." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think it's so beautiful. Allow me to say first um how many miracles Elijah did. How many miracles Elijah did? So you can some some I I understand some say eight, some say 16. Okay. Depends how you count. But once we once we know Elisha did double. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the amount of miracles that you have in your life does not make you rapture ready. Otherwise, Elisha should have been raptured &gt;&gt; because he had more miracles than Elijah. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; So, it's not the amount of miracles that you do in your life &gt;&gt; that makes you ready for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When do we feel we are rapture ready? &gt;&gt; You know when a miracle I remember I I you know the Lord did many miracles in my life with me and I I was I was witness of of even raising dead a dead person. I remember I I'm very careful to say that because because I I remember I was once preaching in a in a place that was in Switzerland and there was a there was a a p the pastor there and after the service after we were in the fellowship hall and the pastor had some kind of a fit and he passed on and he was laying on the ground and they they had a registered nurse in the church and she went down to him looked at his eyes and she told me he's gone. Okay, that was and the brother had a had a it was was an interesting brother. He just said, you know, when I once fall dead, don't bring me back. That was he always told his church, you know, when I die, I die. Don't bring me back. [laughter] Don't, you know, don't make any moves with machines and stuff. And so, as as I saw him laying dead, I I knew that was his command to the church. So he but then I said but then I told the church but he never told us not to pray for him. Okay. &gt;&gt; I said the church said he never told us not to pray. Okay. So I said I just grabbed the hand of a of a of a man of the church said let's pray for him quickly. So we prayed for the brother that was laying there. He came back to life. &gt;&gt; You know what a good feeling that was when I went from that place. I said, "My goodness, &gt;&gt; what is going on?" &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was I rapture ready then? &gt;&gt; You understand the amount of miracles? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE FOUNDATION TO be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because Elisha was not You know how Elisha went on? You know how Elisha, the guy was a the man was a double portion? &gt;&gt; Yes. Is it has did a double portion? &gt;&gt; The man with a double portion. You know how he died? &gt;&gt; The Bible said he died with his sickness. &gt;&gt; He died not on his sickness. No believer dies because of a sickness. You you die with his sickness. But brother said a believer dies when his time has come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? Come on church. &gt;&gt; So when Elijah's time had come, he died with a sickness. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, God had a plan. &gt;&gt; God had a wonderful plan with Elijah. He had a plan with Elisha. That's why Elisha was raptured, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; I mean, come on, church. If we had time, we could could could could Elisha was much more of a Oh my my my God help me. Elisha was much more of a kind person at the end. Elisha was just judgmental. Elisha started very judgmental, but at the end, Elisha, you remember how Elisha was cursing those children? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And brother, it was not pleasing to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It was a It was an angry prophet. &gt;&gt; But Elisha learned that Elisha grew out of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when Elijah When Elisha Come on, church. When Elisha actually was more of a kind person that should be raptured. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And trust we can see. So when it comes to be a nice person, El Elisha was much more nicer than Elijah. &gt;&gt; So the rapture is not depending how nice you are. &gt;&gt; I trust you understand that right. &gt;&gt; I speak to Holy Ghost fil people. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet we are Holy Ghost fil. We we still have our character. We still have our being. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Yes. And some are nice, some are not so nice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Be honest. Be honest to yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some are nice. They have nice jeans from their parents and grandparents. Some not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT CONTROLLING US, BUT IT'S STILL THERE. IS THAT CORRECT? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After after Pentecost, Peter was still Peter. He wasn't suddenly Thomas or Paul. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He was still Peter. Right. Come on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was full of the Holy Ghost and yet he was Peter. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Is that correct? PAUL AFTER HE WAS FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE STILL WAS PAUL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Not so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Do you know that Paul had complexes? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All his life. You know that. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; So that means even with the Holy Ghost, you can have complexes. He had such a great complex. You know why? Because he killed Steven, &gt;&gt; right? He was witness remember who who was taking the clothes of Steven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Paul was there. &gt;&gt; And that never Paul can never over it. He never came over it. &gt;&gt; That was such a sting in him that he was how unspiritual he had been. &gt;&gt; And remember how how he he oh my goodness how he wanted to you know he wanted to die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Remember when when he wanted to go to Jerusalem, I think it was and the Holy Spirit spoke to Agabus, I think it was. &gt;&gt; They said don't go. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit telling to a prophet don't go. All the other people the spirit was leading him telling him don't go and Paul was persuading them because of a complex. &gt;&gt; All the people said the will of the Lord be done. You're with me. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; This was a prophet. &gt;&gt; This was the messenger. So that means even AFTER HE WAS FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST, HE HAD BATTLE WITH HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Give me Give me a few minutes. uh because we we don't want to go to Jesus because that that becomes more more obvious. But you can study it yourself. [laughter] But here is here's but here's here's uh listen here's Elijah. Here he's Elijah and very very very um amazing. Let's go quick to first kings quick. We want to read that scripture at least. First Kings, we want to read quickly that scriptures. First Kings uh 19. We want to read quickly and this might be a help also for us because here Elijah we can see a mistake and it's so amazing but a mistake that you do sometimes because of who you're in the mistake that you do doesn't stop you from being rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When I look to people, I, you know, when I look to myself [sighs and gasps] many times, you can be disappointed. You say, "Lord, why? Why I'm struggling so much?" &gt;&gt; And then Satan brings you down. &gt;&gt; You understand? Or he tries to brings you down. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then the word comes in and said look then you can say Satan whatever condition I am &gt;&gt; I will be raptured. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Closing with Elisha. Remember when Elisha finally died with his sickness? They had not even time to give him a proper funeral. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they were in the time of war. &gt;&gt; Time of war. &gt;&gt; So they just open quickly a grave and throw the body in. Had not even time to proper close it. &gt;&gt; God is doing great things in an unusual way. &gt;&gt; You remember how then one of the soldiers want to get killed? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And because they had no grave of war, they said, "Hey, the grave is still open. Let's quickly put him on. That was the solution for that. &gt;&gt; Never. Nobody thought of rising up and it was just the regular routine. &gt;&gt; Hey, let's throw him in there. &gt;&gt; Let's throw him in there. &gt;&gt; And as THEY THROW HIM, NOBODY EXPECTED A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And nobody's expecting with you America it will happen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Come on brother. &gt;&gt; We I know the time is going with this. We're closing with uh first kings 19 quickly. We want to read and about quickly about um Elijah. Listen listen very carefully about Elijah. Elijah and see how that follows him till the rapture. And Ahab told Jezebel all the things Elijah had done and with with all the slain all the prophets with the sword. And then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying, "So let the gods do to me as more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time." And when he saw that he arose, he went for his life and came to Bashiba which belongs to Judah. Listen very carefully. and he left his servant there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was the greatest mistake he did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is what many times you do as a great mistake. You know why? Why did why did why he left his servant there? Because if somebody is going to a depression, he want to be alone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if you go to a depression, don't make the mistake to stay alone. come to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't stay home. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; If you are really under big depression, don't stay home. Don't stay alone. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; There he made his mistake. He left his servant and the servant has to obey. &gt;&gt; Not so Elijah. [laughter] Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, we we and and listen very carefully. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; it's beautiful. I said, but he himself went days for four journey into the wilderness and came down and sat down under tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said, Lord, it is enough now, Lord. Oh, take away my life for I am not better than any of my fathers. Can you IMAGINE A MAN LIKE THIS UNDER SUCH a that just has done such a great miracle and things coming under such a mood swing that that he even trying to die. He said Lord I I just want to die. The service would tell him different. The ser the servant would tell him his purpose. &gt;&gt; Come on church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, there is WHERE IT'S TOLD YOUR PURPOSE to you. &gt;&gt; That's why when you are in a depression, don't stay home. Don't separate yourself from people. &gt;&gt; But this was Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A man of like passion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Rapture material &gt;&gt; ready. &gt;&gt; You know, on the day here in with that we closing because really the time is up. With that we're closing. You know at when the time you know at the time when he was taken up he went from Gilgal to Beth to Jericho to the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A wonderful journey. Watch him as he went to Bethl. You know what he told Elisha? &gt;&gt; Wait for me. &gt;&gt; Wait for me. I want to be alone. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. &gt;&gt; You know what Elisha said? Nope. &gt;&gt; And Elijah COULDN'T SAY, "BUT YOU ARE MY SERVANT." &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; So Elijah ex accepted fellowship. They came to They came to Gilgal. The same story. &gt;&gt; Elisha said, "You know what? Elisha Terry here." &gt;&gt; And Elisha said, Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You understand? ELIJAH ON HIS WAY to be raptured. &gt;&gt; They came to Jericho. So that allow me to say that the depression was so much on him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That he said again to Elisha, "You know what, Elisha? Tell me here. I want to go alone. And Elisha said, "No." &gt;&gt; No. They come to the Jordan. You understand that? &gt;&gt; They go through the Jordan. They do a miracle not to show to anybody but to walk dry food through it. &gt;&gt; Right. But then as they stand on the other side, Elijah is still a man of like passion like we are. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; If you would have time to go to Jesus, when do you think he was rapture ready? When he was born. When he was riding on the donkey. When he was doing great miracles. when he was making WATER TO WINE OR when he was hanging at the cross &gt;&gt; when he was in the garden of Gethsemane three times. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; The spirit had left him. &gt;&gt; When the spirit had left him, was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The spirit had to leave him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he had to die as a man. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes. &gt;&gt; So if you have to if you walk through a situation in your life that YOU HAVE TO DO FOR YOUR LIFE PURPOSE, &gt;&gt; come on church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what it is, &gt;&gt; you're still raptured. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? &gt;&gt; Amazing. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; What would you think of Jesus hanging at the cross crying lover, MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAS THOU FORSAKEN ME? WAS he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; This became the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he cried out with &gt;&gt; voice. That's right. &gt;&gt; First time he said, "My God, my God, why has the second?" And then again he cried out with a Lloyd voice. You know what it was? It is finished. Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; another rapture took place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I believe we can be rapture ready every moment &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can we understand that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let us enter our feet. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Thank you, Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was a man on the cross. There was a malfector on the cross, right? There was a man that was hanging with Jesus on the cross. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, here we go. You know that he was the last one that came in. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because Jesus told him today You will be with me in paradise. Remember that man was the last one to enter paradise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Belonged to the group that was raptured out of there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Brother said that was the first rapture in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; The Old Testament saints rose. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Was the manifactor with them? Oh yes. Is that correct? He was the last one that came to paradise. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was taken out of paradise as the Bible would say. He would he [music] would he would capture captivity. Jesus Christ did. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Was he rapture ready? How? He just had the right attitude. &gt;&gt; He just told to the other malfector on the cross, we deserve our punishment because we have done wrong, but this man has done nothing wrong. And then he said, remember me. You know what Jesus said, today you will be with me in paradise. &gt;&gt; And not only with me in paradise, because I come to empty out paradise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand &gt;&gt; what it means to be rapture ready? [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to speak to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's how that's how I believe the rapture can take place any moment. That's why I believe the rapture, the change of the body can take place any moment. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We are ready to leave in the twinkling of an eye. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. Let us sing the song Ready [music] to Leave in the Can you know the song? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay.

We thank you for all that you have done, what we can see in the types and shadows of your word. Oh God, we see how Elijah was a man of like passion. We see Enoch was a man that was like we are. We see even Jesus was in those swings and he was even so much under tension till his his sweat [music] turned into blood. Yet he was rapture [music] ready. &gt;&gt; Yes. He even cried out, "Why hast thou forsaken me?" And yet he was rapture ready. Hallelujah. Father, and we understand that the voice of the resurrection, the same voice that woke Lazarus out of the grave, that same voice that brought them out of the paradise called them out, the same voice is here [music] this evening. The same voice is here this evening. [music] And as your prophet told us, that voice is now [music] in the church. She is the voice under her messenger.

So Moses saw 360 something days of Enoch life. The rest was not revealed to him. [laughter] The rest was not revealed to him. He earnestly recorded what he saw. [music] He was not in the Garden of Eden. Everything he wrote about the Garden of Eden were by vision. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here is a prophet comes on the scene and he gave us the rest of in life. &gt;&gt; The part that Moses never saw. [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We we actually had church today.
