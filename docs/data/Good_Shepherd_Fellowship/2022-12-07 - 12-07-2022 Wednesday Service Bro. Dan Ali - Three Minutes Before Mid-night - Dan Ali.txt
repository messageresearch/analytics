glorify the father in the name of Jesus as we look forward father for the rest of the service praise God God bless you musicians that'll be all for tonight for now and while we are so standing can we take our Bibles and open to Exodus 11 Exodus 11. Exodus 11 4. and Moses said thus says the Lord about midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt praise be to God Exodus 12 29. and it came to pass that at midnight the Lord smote the first born in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the first born of cuddle may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word praise be to God shall we be seated good to see around of you tonight God bless you for coming yes we had such a wonderful time on Sunday the Holy Ghost came down in a very special way and um I remember sitting in the foyer and I was asking myself I said the way the Holy Ghost is moving I said what am I going to preach on Wednesday it was like even though I had something on mine it was like it just disappeared and I remember a couple of probably a couple of months ago um Joshua came out to to sing a special and um I remember he put in his his request and before then gospel had put in a request so Joshua was called To Come and sing he came out and he sang it was a very wonderful time for the first time I saw people dancing in the aisle that was not the first time but I saw some people for the first time dancing in the aisle it was just a wonderful time and I was out there and I was praying that the song leader should not call gospel not knowing gas cloth was sitting here praying that they shouldn't call him but the reasons were too different the atmosphere was so ripe and I was just praying that they shouldn't call gaspio so brother one would that passed out brother one would just walk in no no he was also sitting here praying that they shouldn't call him because the bar was so set very high and that if he came out nobody was going to listen to him I didn't know he didn't neither did he know so when Joshua went back and sat down into his ears Joshua you have embarrassed me greatly and Joshua said what so after service Joshua said that here Emmanuel said I said how would you say that to your brother he said that the way he sang nobody was going to listen to me so I was praying now she didn't be called and if they had called me I would not even saying oh praise be to God yeah it was just a good thing I didn't come right after after Sunday's service because I wouldn't have known what to preach praise God but there's been some days now um we are just trusting God for his Divine leadership somewhere last month during Sunday School um I was also having so so busy this week it's like I have not had time for myself I I thought it was God being misunderstood but I'm not very sure don't take me on that and there was a phrase that said three minutes before midnight so that struck me while I was sitting in the foyer I said three minutes before midnight this sounds very much like a sermon so after the sermon when I got home I just plugged it in searched three minutes before midnight Midnight nothing came up but it just it was so much on my heart I started feeding on it and I just it was leading me into one from one thing to the other and tonight by the grace of God we are going to talk about three minutes before midnight three minutes before midnight we are living in a time in fact in a very very dangerous time and if there was any time that we had to take off our cloak our human cloak and put on Christ it is now this is not a time to play this is a at which aisle of the which part of the aisle you belong right there is no time to play Church this is the time to really find out who you truly are and where you stand at work today a colleague had his 15 15 year celebration so we had to stop work we didn't stop but we had finished with work we all gathered together just to eat and have fun and somebody says something he said he was playing Chris Christmas carols and another person told him I had to listen to this type of music and there was somebody sitting right next to me who said yeah I couldn't listen to that for one month and then it blows my mind to think that there are people that cannot listen to Christmas carols for a month but they can listen to one rock and roll every single day for one month and they don't have a problem so the whole place was quiet and I said I have a problem with that I said because everywhere on the platform there are radios I said a lot of the times you hear people playing songs and I said they have filthy songs by my standard they are songs I will call filthy but I said I have never complained I have never told them I don't like this music but I just do my work knowing that I don't like it so why would somebody be playing A Christmas Carol and somebody will say I don't like this music I said I have a problem with it and the whole place was going and I remember that happened before between somebody and I and we sorted it out now you are the one under under attack no you are not under attack the Lord Jesus Christ is the one under attack when you take on Christ then you come in the Firing Lane because you have taken on Christ and he is under attack then you are under attack that is why the Bible says that the battle is not your battle it is the Lost battle it is not yours so if there was any time that we have to put on Christ and be proud of who we truly are it is in this day and age because Christ is under attack except we suffer with him there is no way we can reign with him we are just partakers of his suffering praise be to God in time I am here to tell us to remind us I'm too new the topic May take me three minutes before midnight I don't know how it's going to end but I'm here to remind us that it is later than we think that it is homegoing time it's homegoing time one time the Lord Jesus was with his disciples and they came and they told him they were just showing him the bodies of the Temple and he told them that there is coming a time that one stone would not remain stand on another and when he went up the mountain Mount Olive and sat down the Bible says they came to him privately and to ask him what time is it going to be and when you read the Bible he started talking about the end time talking about the end time or giving all the signs what to watch out for and when you look at all the signs you know nobody has to tell you that we are living in the end time it is homegoing time it's like we are working on a knife edge that is how we are to the end and he said that any generation that would live to see the Fig Leaf foot of leaves that generation would not pass until all these things be fulfilled talking about Israel Israel has become a nation since 1947 Ember brother said a generation is 40 years and when you do the math probably we are getting very close to 80. two generations oh it's so our generation is 40 and Christ said any generation that sees this signs that generation will not pass away God is Not slack concerning his promises as some [Music] repentance brother Branham said that we are living in a borrowed time on a borrowed time we don't know why the loss of the elect is he could come in tonight it could be tomorrow morning it could be tomorrow evening Jesus said oh that the father have given me he would not lose one and if he is tired of God there is no place for you here just get ready you either come crawling or you come walking or whichever way God is going to get you back he's going to get you but he's not going to lose you praise be to God we are in the homegoing time and I wonder I've never forgotten my topic three minutes before midnight we are in a homegoing Time I wonder how many of us are in the homegoing mode it does not have to be a lip service oh we are in the enter we are in the end time no the life you live what you meditate upon what your self is on the way you live should tell the story it shouldn't be a lip service that somebody can look at you and tell that you are preparing for something that may not be able to know what you are doing how many of us are in the homegoing mode it's like it's just like your car you had the four-wheel drive you have the four two-wheel drive now if you were driving in through Hill and you got into snow and the road was slippery and you were driving on two Hills making 75 degrees I mean 75 miles per hour Lord have mercy and you got to a slippery place you think you'll still be driving in two wheel do a 75 degree ah oh my goodness what is wrong no you're going to slow down you select a different mode when the times change or when the seasons change it prompts a change in our lives I remember those days we used to go to the record dance just go and dance off our heads you'll be dancing a reggae song and I'll put you some different song you change the dance why because the music has changed times have changed times have changed they are no longer what they used to be but when you look at your life can you confidently say that your life has changed can you confidently say that your life measures up with the gospel can you say confidently without any Shadow of Doubt that you are no longer that person used to be or you are still hopping left and right hmm sure it's homegoing time how many of us are in a homecoming mode now I believe every one of you know what it means to be homesick if you are born and bred here um not quite but for those of us that have traveled across the Atlantic and across the Pacific to be here you know what it means to be homesick you sometimes something drove us here we came looking for greener pastures looking for a better life for ourselves of our children okay now you think back and you look at the life you once lived in you looked at the difficulties you looked at the financial difficulties you look at the problems the crimes the condition in which you wear you knew it was not the best sure that sometimes you didn't even have a room to yourself two three four people sleeping in one room and sometimes you have to eat together and you have to learn how to eat fast you didn't have the Comfort to just sit down and take your time and eat no no if you did that you may end up getting hungry so instead of chewing you have to learn to swallow and then you just fight and you roll in the Sun and what have you you end up going to sit by the Fireside to just tell stories go to bed wake up the following day you look at a life like this it doesn't look like it has any future now you'll find yourself here with all the blessings with all the prosperity and then you can look back to a life like that and then you still get homesick here he said that um well what did he say um that the home is a special place I'm trying to get this quote he just lived by there is no place like home and indeed there is no place like home sometimes with all the blessings you still want to go just to see the old friends to see the relatives sometimes just to walk the streets you once walked on before sometimes just to go and visit that school that old school just to I mean something about it wants you to go back and there is something about being homesick it tells of your origin I am a Ghanaian I can never say I'm homesick for China if I ever say that just do me a favor call the paramedics praise the Lord I can never I can be homesick for Ghana that tells you of my origin now does this surprise you that you get homesick for heaven does it ever surprise you that you get homesick for heaven if getting home sick naturally of a country you belong to tells of your origin your place of birth then what it also means that you getting home sick for heaven tells of your true origin because you can never get homesick forever for heaven if that was not your home the Bible says that God said let us make money in our own image and in the image of God he made man man was a spirit man before God forming Out of the Dust of the Earth we just bypassed our theophany to come into this life but this is not our home so it shouldn't surprise you when you begin to Crave for Heavenly things the Bible says treated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you longing for heaven longing for heaven homesick for heaven that you can be seated here and yet you are lost somebody can look at you and tell that you are completely disconnected you are somewhere else that is what happens when you're homesick we are talking about three minutes to make time and when somebody is really homesick for a country and they want to travel and they are doing all their preparation you know they just sit down and their minds their spirit is just gone and they already are in that place while they are here before they ever make that Journey and they are searching the net trying to keep Pace with what is going on there they don't want to be led back and when I go why do I even want to visit what is new what is going on and I encourage you brothers and sisters that keep yourself in tune we are Heavenly beings we are not Earthly creatures we are Heavenly beings keep feeding on the world searching through the word keep meditating upon the world by day and by night not when it seems convenient praise be to God it's homegoing time we are very very very close to the end three minutes three minutes before midnight praise be to God now when you know that the end is here when you know that there is no more time when you know that we are living in the most dangerous times that a man could ever live in what you have to do that as you keep reading it's not enough to read the Bible says if I don't get to the message praise God the Bible says that my people perish for lack of knowledge you ought to make time life in America is so so busy life in America is in the fast lane you can get up from money till evening with a very very good intention you apply to such the scriptures read the message meditate upon the word of prayer or seek the face of God and the day just comes and passes by and before you away it's a week and before you away one month has come and gone and you have not done anything right you have to make time with God knowledge doesn't come just by sitting down on the back of your side just crossing your leg and enjoying no you have to make time with God and as good as knowledge is knowledge would not benefit you if you don't apply that knowledge you must have that wisdom them of God to rightly apply the knowledge of God knowledge without its application will still not benefit you the Bible says we are living Epistles apply the word to your life live by the word the word is our absolute praise be to God it's a time to keep consecrating ourselves a Time you keep purging ourselves because eternity is actually closing in on us and time is running out eternity is closing in on us and time is running out three minutes before midnight now a day is made up of 24 hours times 60 minutes I did the math already 8 440 minutes 1440 minutes in a day so if you got up in the morning and you had 1440 minutes you know you have time it's a lot of time when you are down to a thousand you know you have a lot of time you'll get down to 500 you know you still have time but when you get to three minutes we are not talking of three minutes just three minutes in a vacuum no we are talking of three minutes to midnight so put it in context now if from 1440 minutes you have come all the way down to three minutes to midnight what it tells you is that you have run out of time what it tells you is that you don't anymore have time on your hand right praise be to God we are living in a very uncertain moment this life is very very uncertain I remember last last month I was just sitting with a colleague he comes from West Africa too and he was talking to somebody tried to console him not knowing that fellow was going to die the same day he lost his mother on Sunday the following day was Monday and he was consoling him and guess what the following day was Tuesday they were calling him and they were not getting him he he was a truck driver he got to the the stopover or however they call it and then he slept in the truck and that ended the story and they called the police because they knew his last location and they told the police this was why he was the last time we spoke with him and if it had been three days now the police went there and then they found out he was in the truck and he was dead that is how uncertain this life is now my question is in the final three moments in the final three minutes of his life what was on his heart because this brother was telling me that he just finished building his house hmm and Sierra Leone and he walled around it everything completely done and his diet gone and left it behind so everything he told for is completely useless it doesn't mean we don't have to work it doesn't mean we don't have to acquire property if God gives you go for it right but remember that these are things we are just going to use while we are here just for a little comfort just for a little comfort but there is a land Beyond what we are going to spend eternity and what choices are you making in life what are the choices you are making three minutes three minutes doesn't mean anything but if you have three minutes to midnight and midnight is a Tipping Point that when you go beyond midnight you are going from one day to another day you will never come back to the previous day is God and is gone for good so when you have three minutes to make midnight let's just use this an example those of you are in school or those of you who just went through the system you know that when you are given an assignment and they say the assignment is due at 11 59. and you are you you are your assignment you are covering what you have done and you are just going through just sitting down with a mouse in your hand just waiting to click Send or submit you are just comfortable the same cannot be said with somebody that has not fully completed their work either they are Midway either they are food and material together they are not sure of what they have and they look at the time and it's three minutes to midnight you are supposed to submit your work at 11 59. guess what you get more so confused there are some instructors who will not even look at your work if it is a minute late some will look at it and they'll do that some points some may show Grace so when the odds are against you it is not a comfortable place to be when everything is all right that is good but when the US are against you three minutes to midnight is not a comfortable place to be it can be good and it can be bad depending on where you are standing praise be to God it's a Time to keep consecrating ourselves don't seek to do something new or something no man has done before just consecrate keep consecrating yourself keep believing and keep trusting be pushing on there is a lot will go through and there is a good reason why every single day you have to consecrate yourself there is a good reason why you have to keep pledging yourself every single day like the sea the sea is always in a joyful mood if you were going to the Sea to the shore you are going to hear the sound of the waves it's always rejoicing but a lot of the Radioactive probably they have stopped that is The Dumping Ground but the sea keeps Paving itself single day it has a single day the sea is paging itself every single day this is happening having arrival and we ought to be pegging ourselves knowing that we are getting very very close to the end never depart from the world like a friend was telling me somewhere last two weeks about his marriage the first question I asked him I said you go to church oh everything changes everything I said no do I say don't laugh I said do you pray in the house he says sometimes I said does your wife go to church he said I can't I don't I don't know you are living in the house you are the man of the house you don't even know what a wife goes to church or not I said well I have a lot of things to tell you but the first thing I will tell you is that start going to church and he started I said no I'm not joking I said stop going to church I say you have thrown God out of your home that is how you have those problems when you throw God out of your home you have nothing left never depart from the world say with the word feed on the word meditate upon the world always look at your life oh my examine yourself see why you are standing with the word praise be to God now you may have realized by now that there is nothing Under the Sun that brings Joy you may have realized that there is nothing under the sun that actually satisfies you sometimes for those that are poor you will think maybe when I get money I'll be fine you get the money you realize you're not fine sometimes people are just any for recognition when you gave when you become a prominent person or you become famous you'll be fine they become prominent they become famous and they realize that no that wasn't it a lot of them take drugs and they die in their in their in their bathtubs we hear the story right sometimes you think oh it's because I'm single why now when I marry oh I'll be fine life will be so good and then you get married and they realize that the honeymoon is just for only two weeks praise the Lord there are a lot of things our hearts go for and you will think that when I get this then I got it when you get it they realize no it doesn't even mean anything anymore oh the excitement is gone through the window it doesn't satisfy there is nothing rewarding the only thing that satisfies and the only thing that is rewarding is just Christ and him alone do not let anything carry your attention away from the most important things nothing under the sun satisfies the only place and Son of God the other place a daughter of God will find satisfaction is in Christ anything outside of Christ you are not standing sure three minutes before midnight I'm going to start it now praise be to God now it's a time of time of agency three minutes before midnight of agency it's a time that keeps you on your toes that you don't do things a normal person does that things just change why because time is running out you can have a fire service uh a fire firefighter come to the house maybe your alarm is going off and you call the firefighter and he comes he takes his time he comes he knocks at the door and then oh come in and then he comes and inspect they say firefighter comes when there is fire on the house he doesn't need your attention to enter the house because he knows that time is running out on the souls in the house praise be to God and here in America you see firefighters so I'm not surprised when they ask some of these small children what do you want to be when you grow and they sound to be a firefighter I'm not surprised because these are courageous man I know of places that they have never put a fire sometimes I will come when the place is on fire they will come and look at the size of the fire before they even go and get water don't wait till the structure is bent down before they see them in the street poor people people pee and they come the place is just in everything is consumed and then they come and stand and they are spraying the smoke but here in America they are firefighters my goodness I don't want to go too much in that direction we are already out of time so when a man is running out of time there is something about them you see people when they are late for work and they're on the highway they drive like they are losing it right you see people working to work and they are late you see the way they are walking it tells you that there is agency when you see their lives it tells you you don't have to tell you you can tell that there is something going on and we are living in a time of agency in the most crucial time ever do we have that agency are we are we at least like we are so relaxed so so so relaxed like we have all the day to ourselves forgetting that we are running out of time and as we go down you will see we are talking about three minutes to midnight but you realize that we don't actually have three minutes to midnight praise be to God we are not just talking about midnight because my brother said somewhere that we are waiting for midnight to March out of here so if it were midnight would not be here but we are talking of three minutes to midnight a Time even though it's not enough even though time is running out it's enough time to make a right turn even though there is no time even though time is running out on us it is enough time to start making the right choices it gives us enough room to do an introspection set our hearts search Our Lives and start making the right decisions praise be to God three minutes before midnight something is about to strike and praise be to God has so much loved us that he has sent us a prophet with a message to turn our hearts to the Faith of Our Fathers before he strikes the Earth with a kiss something is about to happen count yourself blessed and after you have had this message the message of our Lord Jesus Christ and then you find yourself God forbid with somebody that never believes tomorrow you blame yourself you don't blame God for it everything we need to overcome has been given us we are not in the dark I have heard people say that if I don't make it I'll be a foolish virgin you will never be a foolish virgin as a matter of fact the foolish version does not even know that's just a foolish version right she doesn't know when the time comes and they don't make itself so yeah there was something I was missing may you and I know better than that you and I know better than that the Bible says to whom much stories coming in I will just leave it alone for now praise be to God now midnight is the darkest time of the night according to science that's when the sun is farthest away and it also goes without argument that The Darkest Hour of the night is Just Before Sunrise because if the sun rises here it has to go one revolution to come back again now when it goes all the way to the end here that is when the sun has gone farthest from this point and you have the darkest moment but again it happens to be the time that the sun is going to make a U-turn and then shine again so the darkest moment science says it's midnight and that is when the sun is farthest away and three minutes to midnight talks about living in the darkest moment of the day three minutes before midnight that means you are living in the darkest moment of the day it is also it also talks about how far away the Sun is from the West and how close it is to the east and without a doubt we are living in the darkest moment in human history there is gross Darkness on the land grass Darkness on the land and that tells us how far away the Gospel Light has traveled from the West that is from the Gentile dispensation back towards the east that is to the Jews praise be to God and when the gospel returns to the Jews it never comes back again to the Gentiles that is going to be the end the gospel is just not returning to the east the gospel is going back to its origin praise be to God salvation is of the Lord he came to you he came to his own and his own received him not they were blinded for our sake but when the gospel goes back that closes the door on the Gentile disposition we must get a hold of God we must get a hold of God praise be to God told Moses the scripture will just write an Aaron that he was going to send one more plague to pharaoh and Egyptians and this time Pharaoh would let them go Not only would he let them go but he was going to stress them and to trust is just like throw something away he had no choice but to stress them out and God told Moses and Aaron to tell the children of Israel to get a lamp for each family and why the family was small poor families could come together and kill alarm and we know the story and they should apply the blood on the letter post on the door post and on the lentil of the door and wherever there was the blood wherever the blood was applied the deaf Angel was not going to go in there but anyway there was no blood applied the deaf Angel was going to go in and the first born Pharaoh right down to the firstborn or whosoever was in the dungeon of both animal and men we're going to die three minutes before midnight three minutes before midnight I could just imagine the children of Israel applying the blood applying the token because endless 11 says about midnight I will pass through the land and exodus 12 29 says at midnight the deaf Angel went through the land so three minutes to midnight I could just imagine how they were just busy applying the token busy applying the blood and they were not sitting down they were not lying down they were not sleeping they were eating as they were in prepressing mode their feet were in their shoes they guide their lives they hide their stuff in their hands and they were ready to March out as they were applying the token three minutes before midnight before the angel the deaf angel struck they were busy playing the token three minutes before midnight and a deaf angel struck everyone except under the blood the only place strike was under the blood and today as Midnight Hour is approaching the only safe place is under the blood praise be to God death will strike everywhere accepts under the blood and if you are looking for a hideout if you are looking for a safe place to hide it's under the blood in the message the sign of the Messiah every Bible teacher knows that the gentle dispensation is the end and here's to tell you intellige you and God has had in the heart of Hitler Mussolini all them dictators and Russia and run those Jews right back into Palestine where they supposed to be standing there I got a picture three minutes before midnight according to science and those Jews those Jews coming in with packing their loved ones old on their back you see it is in the look magazine coming down from Iran and those places and you coming back let me just backtrack a little um packing does all juice in and a friend of mine went to them got in with a quarter crumb color said are you coming back to the Homeland to die said no we are coming back to see the Messiah we are not coming back to die we are coming back to see the Messiah Jesus said when the Fig Tree Grows I mean it goes to put him forth his bars this generation 40 years shall not cease until all these things be fulfilled do you get it what's happening the last call for the Gentiles the nations are ready to be pulverized at any time and to think of it before that can happen the church goes home first praise be to God and if we could if if we could be pulverized before morning and the judgment and about going home of the church it could come any minute certainly wake up people shake your spiritual Souls Within You by reading the word we are at the end time the time is at hand we've had theology we've had Church age but this is the time and now the last sign to the Jew was that was what the appearing of the Lord Jesus the last sign to the Gentile is the coming is him coming in the spirit of the Holy Ghost back into his church doing the same things that he did then to declare himself the same yesterday today and forever praise be to God so we are at a very very very end and when all the confusion started in Ukraine and there was this um information about putting putting says he's ready to go to use nuclear arms and mind you nobody knows whether he was boosting or he meant it nobody knows that we are admonished to watch Russia and what Russia has America is a great superpower but America doesn't have it the Satan too they have it and it looks like they gave it the right name Satan too and he was busting he will use he will use it nobody knew he was just one day going to get crazy and then just extract them or somebody will just get crazy and saying I'm just I'm really tired with this world and just press the button that is how close we are my brother is saying that before we hit that point the church will be out of here that should tell you how close how close the church is to the end it is almost three minutes we are seconds away from Midnight circus away from Midnight I swear brother was asking a question I think it's in um question and answers he said do you know I'm just paraphrasing it now that by sunrise tomorrow morning we will be out of here by sunrise tomorrow morning and see how many years now since he passed if there was any time to mean business with God this is the time praise be to God in the message God's provided way did he notice just in the anti-delivian world before that Noah before that the first drop of rain ever fell Noah went into the ark in the death of Sodom before one bit of fire ever fell from heaven that angel said to Lord make tastes come hither for I can't do nothing till you come out of there praise be to God in fact God cannot do anything until we live here we are the one holding back the wrath of God that God looks down and he sees his sons and daughters and that alone cools his heart when we are out of here it's a different thing and remember even though lot and his wife and children came out his wife didn't make it coming out is not enough coming out is not enough there is a saying that you can take the baboon out of the forest but you can't take the forest out of the baboon but in this race the forest must be taken out praise be to God it is not enough to come out of the world and still have the word in your heart the next word that takes place will only last I take it again the next world that takes place will only be three minutes long three minutes no wonder size sizes is three minutes till midnight three minutes is all it will take to rock the world completely to pieces and blow it up we are living on borrowed time the prophet speaking and God's provided why the Earth is bulging out the sun doesn't go around its orbit like it used to do everything is indicating that that coming of the lord we are right at the door and remember before one of those Bobs can drop don't forget this Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and in the days of Lord so shall it be at the coming of the son of man and before Noah before the rain fell down Noah was in the ark safely before Lord was outside and before one bomb can strike the church will be home in glory God in good praise be to God praise the Lord talking about the somebody out in the sun doesn't go around its orbit like the way it used to do so something happened to me one day if it's not long I'll be closer very soon the time is up normally I would my my alarm would go up at 4 30. and a lot of the times I'll be up before then so I woke up and uh I needed to use the restroom but I didn't want to go use the restroom and then come back and then my alarm goes off and I have to go back so I looked at a time and the time was three fifty nine 359 I said no I have 30 minutes to sell rests in bed so I went to the restroom I didn't spend two minutes in the restroom and I came back as soon as I got back and I lay on the bed my alarm started going off I have never understood that I have never understood that that is how fast that is how fast time is running away that is how fast eternity is closing in it's just too fast I have never understood that and there is nothing to explain that that I go to the restroom in less than 90 seconds I come out from 359 is already 4 30. that should give you sleepless night you have to watch every step you take you have to watch the life you are living keep examining yourself we all have work to do keep consecrating yourself let's keep praying for one another let's keep one another before the Lord praise be to God speak to the Rock for I believe the meeting is at hand I believe the meeting is at hand right now that's going to bring the gospel back to the Jews again in Palestine and then the Gentiles is finished when the Jews receive the Holy Ghost again in Palestine the Gentiles are finished you scream cry do what speak to the rock you want to but Mercy has returned to Israel again that's right and the Gentiles they will throw down the Walls until the gentle dispensation be finished and then it's over for you so you get right now with God be sure that you are right and don't pay any attention to this little old weak this was stuff you'll get you get into the strong power of the Holy Spirit that has changed your innermost being and made you what you wasn't yourself now how the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can do that praise be to God it is not our effort your effort would not do what God has done he would never undo it right Peter's denial of him never stopped God first persecution of him never stopped him it's a prop executed yes Paul persecuted him on his way to Damascus when he was struck down by the pillar of Fire what is Jesus asking why persecuted down me that didn't stop God Thomas doubting did not stop God if you are a child of God you cannot stop God oh that the father has given him would come nothing nothing can take you away oh that the father had given him will come there is no place for a child of God in hell even if you chose it you'll be disappointed because there is no place there for you our souls are redeemed by the blood we have come this far by grace is what he has done we couldn't do anything it's what he has done that is what we are depending on and he will never let us down he would never fail us praise be to God Moses gave the command done to them to stay under there and here come the Midnight Hour I can hear the unrest and a little boy I can see him run up to his daddy and say Daddy what's that great noise the people all seem to be staring here says son God is going to send judgment Upon This Nation Daddy are we going to be killed no God has promised us if we were under the blood that we would not die praise be to God I remember brother one was preaching last last Sunday was was it Sunday I believe it was and he says something he said that a Rapture is a family event and that when you are packing your bag make sure that everybody's bag is packed this brings us right there this this this dialogue between his father and son just reminds me that when you are saved when you know that you are saved it doesn't end there you have to make sure that every member of the family is under the same token every member of this is under the same token I remember when Daniel and Joshua were in the streets one day I took my phone I don't know what I was writing but I wrote on it that we that our children uh what was it um I forgot I said what I wrote but I wrote We without our children oh my goodness I'm trying to get the last word maybe I'll just paraphrase it something like we without our children um actually I lost something like that but that wasn't what I wrote and then for a very long time I forgot of it and I was holding this phone and I was just doing something on the phone and this thing from nowhere just popped up on the phone we without our children have lost hope or something something and I started looking I said wow and honestly speaking that was not even a time I wanted to read that it was not a it was not a Time that I wanted to be reminded of that but it just came and said oh what is this again I didn't want to look at it but I was forced to read it so when it comes to our Salvation it's just not just it's not just you it's not just you and you alone everybody Under The Roof everybody under your umbrella it is your duty to make sure that they are under the same token you must be concerned the wrong thing is button to ask a brother brother are you saved sister are you saved some of the times people will take offense at it listen to the question he was asking me who are you ask me that question but I believe that if we are all in the right set of mind will not take offense at some of these things the sun was concerned when he had all the turmoil going on outside day he was he was just worried my daddy was saying that God has given us a promise that so long as we keep ourselves under the blood we are safe praise be to God the musicians can come over I'll be done in the next two three minutes praise the Lord brother a man has got to be born of the spirit of God regenerated washed in the blood of the Lamb with the baptism of the Holy Ghost as God's Divine witness in his soul no two ways about it it's a must you have to get a hold of God and I'll tell you are certain you don't have to let go of God in the midst of the uncertainty there is a degree of certainty in Christ even though life is shot on Earth you can trade that short life with life in eternity with God there is life in Christ apply the token the deaf angel [Music] where am I [Music] so that's true yes sir don't worry son everything is all right the death angel turn away that droughts may come the hard times may come you may be persecuted made fun of and everything but eternal life stays right there just the same praise be to God hallelujah let the never say what they want to say let the measure say what he wants to say let the doctor say what he wants to do take away eternal life is the gift of God that was given by the Holy Spirit it can't go away is the Holy Spirit the deaf Angels struck everywhere except under the blood the other place death couldn't strike was under the blood and today as the Midnight Hour is approaching the only safe place to be is under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ death will not strike anywhere under the blood three minutes before midnight as I said a while ago it's later than we think but not too late to turn to him not too late to make things right not too late to seek his face we are now seconds away from his coming of the time and the hour no Snowman but we can tell from the science that we are right at the very end of this journey there is enough time to do something about the situation there is only one safe place which is in Christ Jesus our only place of shelter our only hiding place and in him we find our being and our strength keep applying the token praise be to love praise be to the Lord thank you Jesus praise be to God I will cover the one brother one if you can take over God bless you science see the boys yes I will pass I will pass over you Josh man is coming will be there each one received just [Music] in the city increase in Blood and our good past my soul for you oh foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign we know that every time when God allow the world to comfort there's a purpose that the word comes for you know better brand him talking about three minutes to midnight every time the prophet made our statement he ties into uh to the Jews and he ties it to the Jews timeline he ties it to the Jews returning back to their Homeland he ties into the prophecy concerning the Jews and and all of that but you also realize that in Revelation chapter 10 are the sounding of of the last messenger uh the scripture says time will be normal time is normal and when brother Branham talks about that is the time he says that uh the sounding of that messenger you know or uh uh put the end of time to the worst system you know and and that's the reason why it looks like uh you know politics have come to its end you know that we see the the church system has come to his end and all of that and that's the reason why God has to call us out with a message so uh we know that that that face the Jews timeline for for our timeline we realize that the message has called us out of La audition praise the Lord so uh we're uh uh but I would say that you know every time like just like I said when when the message comes like this is is is for the church is for an individual to take you know examine their life I've been kind of for studying a little bit in the book of Leviticus you know every time we we start reading a book at home I take a time to go back and start studying the book and what I realized uh just in life with what what I feel that that the Lord was speaking through brother Dan tonight instead in The Book of Leviticus and looking at uh some of the the subject there in the book The Book of Leviticus turned out to be one of the a very striking book because it's a book that has a sense to deal with the church it's called The Book of the call you know it's it's one of the book where God spoke to Moses directly from the Tabernacle and is calling the people to a life of separation with all the ordinances all the feasts it is with you know uh the uncleanness and everything and then uh listening to what brother Dan preached tonight what I hear the spirit saying to the church is uh uh you know we we have to uh somehow examine ourselves we know that uh like we always says the worship part is never on an examination but we have to take a very close look at our life just like where we were trying to encourage the church on on Sunday and uh uh this message have called us to a higher calling we are a Rapture people praise the Lord where people that has been called out of the worst system you know out of out of uh you know the loudisha age and uh we know we have to go to work we have to go to school you know we go to the same Grocery Center the same hospital we deal with the same things but we realize that we have been called to to uh to go into the holiest of holy with the Lord you know we are called to a life of communion you know a life of of dedication uh you know a life that is separated from uh you know from the things of the world and as I was just looking into into that and sharing some of the few things at home with the family and uh and seeing where we are you know uh uh any any day now like our brother said we can be stepping on the shows of glory and all of that but it's also at a place where you know God wants us as his children with everything that we have to deal with to come to a you know a life of of confidence you know we have confidence we know where we are we know where we are standing with the Lord you know what I mean if there is things in our lives and you know that are blocking us we we must deal with it you know while we we must we must trash those things away you know we must have time to spend with the Lord our communion with the Lord our devotion with the Lord when we step out of our homes we know we are stepping out in faith you know when we come back to the house and if yes if we have a situation at home we must deal with either calling to the word if there's a situation with a brother we must deal with it according to the word if there's a situation in church we must deal with it calling to the word it's a place where the uh this bride this rapturing bride is standing with so much confidence we know where we are standing you know what we know where we are with the Lord so let's just buy our house tonight let's just buy our house tonight as uh as uh the message of our brother you know is bringing us to the place to realize uh is later than we think that's what we can say you know three minutes to midnight means that it's later than we think it is not it is not time to put off things you know we must not put up what we can do today for tomorrow if the Lord is dealing with our hearts let's place it before him the Bible says if our heart condemned us not we have confidence with God but if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart then let's place it before the Lord you know let's let's come before the Lord let's be able to speak things you know put our hearts before God place our weaknesses Lord I Need Your Grace in this area father help me help me in this area of my life Lord father if there is if there is if there is a habit that is bothering us let's place it before the Lord and uh and place it under the blood God is more than able he can deliver us he can cleanse our
