[50:03] why we want to approach him tonight with

[50:20] for those that are online we want to
[50:22] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[50:23] Jesus Christ
[50:29] we want to open our Bible in the Book of
[50:30] Job chapter
[50:46] 14 job
[50:54] 14:7 for the Bible say
[50:57] says if you thereare you can say amen
[51:00] amen amen are you happy to be here oh
[51:03] yeah thank the Lord for that job chapter
[51:07] 14:7 says for there is hope of a tree if
[51:12] it be cut down that it will spr again
[51:15] that the tender Branch thereof will not
[51:19] cease though the root therefore thereof
[51:23] waxs old in the earth and the stock
[51:26] there off die in the ground yet the
[51:29] sense of water you will bud and will
[51:32] bring forth like a a
[51:34] plant if you look at this scripture very
[51:38] carefully if God could make a way for a
[51:41] flower to live again what about you and
[51:44] I so it doesn't matter how dead we can
[51:47] be
[51:48] tonight it doesn't matter what is the
[51:51] sickness whatever situation it
[51:53] is God is still alive if there is hope
[51:57] in the tree means that there's hope
[51:59] tonight and God is able to give you what
[52:02] your heart desire if we approach it the
[52:04] same way I also want to open the Bible
[52:08] in the book of Roman Romans chapter 4:
[52:14] 16 Romans chapter 4 verse 16
[52:29] the Bible
[52:34] says says therefore it is of faith that
[52:38] it might be by grace to the end of the
[52:43] promise to the end of the promise might
[52:46] be sure to all the seed not to what that
[52:51] only which is of the law but to that
[52:56] also which is of faith of Abraham who is
[53:00] the father of us all as it is written I
[53:04] have made thee a father of many
[53:07] Nation before him who he
[53:10] believed even God who quickeneth the
[53:15] dead in other word in another way who
[53:18] giveth life to the
[53:20] dead so Abraham was a strong believer of
[53:23] a god of Resurrection
[53:29] and call those things which be not as
[53:32] though they were who against hope
[53:36] believe in hope that he might become the
[53:40] father of many Nation according to that
[53:43] which was spoken so shall thy seed be
[53:48] and being now weak in faith he ConEd
[53:52] not so Abraham decided to considered he
[53:56] decided not to
[53:59] consider his own body now
[54:03] dead when he was about 100 years old
[54:06] neither yet the the deadness of Sarah's
[54:09] wom he staggered not at the promise of
[54:13] God through
[54:14] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[54:18] glory to God and being uh fully
[54:22] persuaded that what he had promised
[54:26] he was able also to perform shall we
[54:31] pray again Heavenly Father may you bless
[54:34] us tonight Lord may you come Lord Jesus
[54:37] father feel so nervous Lord but I just
[54:40] trust that the same God that came and
[54:42] reveal me this message oh God will be
[54:45] the one father that will deliver it
[54:46] father Lord we pray now in the name of
[54:48] our Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you you
[54:52] may be seated for a while
[54:57] tonight by God's grace I want to speak
[54:59] on a message which really I was
[55:01] listening to a message somewhere of
[55:03] course I'll read the message later uh I
[55:05] want to speak on the thought here Faith
[55:09] sees the god of
[55:14] Resurrection Faith sees the god of
[55:20] Resurrection faith is the six
[55:23] sense and that six sense element
[55:26] sees the God who gives life to the dead
[55:30] sorry I forgot to put that last
[55:33] week so we see here I was listening to a
[55:37] message calm down and brother bham said
[55:39] something really that caught my
[55:41] attention it was in the world fair he
[55:44] says showing by scientific research that
[55:48] science has been able to achieve in the
[55:51] natural thing he says now we are here
[55:54] showing by spiritual
[55:57] research what God has been able to
[55:59] achieve with people who will believe his
[56:02] word amen it says now to achieve
[56:05] scientific things you've got to work in
[56:08] scientific line to achieve spiritual
[56:11] things you got to work in spiritual line
[56:14] it says little science that didn't know
[56:17] the ABC founded why there were spiritual
[56:21] scientist
[56:22] amen how many spiritual stist we have
[56:25] here
[56:27] it says this they seems the things they
[56:29] believe it it says men did it by
[56:33] education the natural scientist the
[56:36] spiritual scientist done it by
[56:41] Revelation it says one by education the
[56:45] other by Revelation right so now there's
[56:49] two group here so tonight we have to
[56:53] identify to one of this group because we
[56:55] cannot be in m in a middle but I truly
[56:58] believe that we are standing here
[57:00] tonight has spiritual scientist that has
[57:03] to do all things by
[57:05] Revelation now in Hebrews chapter 11 the
[57:08] Bible says and I want us to pay
[57:10] attention it's a very familiar scripture
[57:12] here it says now Faith it does not say
[57:17] faith is it says now so it's it's a
[57:20] present tense element so it's not just
[57:24] based on something that happened
[57:25] yesterday is something that is happening
[57:28] now so basically if you want to receive
[57:30] something of the Lord tonight you have
[57:32] to apply it to the present tense so now
[57:35] as I will be I'll be talking tonight and
[57:38] I'll just ask you to do something for me
[57:40] if you have any situation in Your Heart
[57:43] Take God's
[57:44] word and apply faith into it and let's
[57:47] see what happened because God cannot
[57:50] fail there's one thing that God cannot
[57:51] do is fail so now Faith is a substance
[57:55] of things hopeful
[57:56] the evidence of Things Not Seen so it
[58:00] already takes away the sight so you
[58:02] don't have to see it all right now in
[58:04] the Amplified version it says now Faith
[58:07] is the
[58:10] Assurance you know amen faith is the
[58:14] Assurance it's a title
[58:17] deed so it's something that you already
[58:20] have it says a
[58:23] confirmation of things hop for so it's
[58:26] divinely
[58:27] guaranteed it says and the evidence of
[58:31] Things Not Seen I love this it says the
[58:35] conviction of the
[58:37] reality so now it continues here it says
[58:41] faith comprehend as fact so you can't
[58:45] see
[58:47] it but yet is a fact so you can be able
[58:51] to touch something that is as real as
[58:54] I'm I'm looking at you tonight so this
[58:56] is what faith
[58:58] is oh my faith comprehend as fact what
[59:03] cannot be
[59:05] experienced by the physical
[59:08] senses so Saints tonight by God's grace
[59:11] I felt in my heart to bring to break
[59:13] this thing Faith a little bit more so
[59:16] that we can get something out of it so
[59:19] if we have a desire we can tap into that
[59:21] world and get get something from the
[59:23] Lord now in another message here brother
[59:26] bham
[59:27] says faith is a substance it says
[59:30] paragraph 4 49 it says now listen
[59:34] closely give me your attention the F the
[59:38] senses the five senses in oh I might I
[59:40] might as well just read it here it says
[59:43] now listen real Qui closely and give me
[59:46] your attention now this senses these
[59:49] five senses is this right see taste feel
[59:52] smell hear is that is that right it says
[59:55] them five senses control the entire
[59:58] human body is that true see taste feel
[1:00:02] smell and hear now there is none of them
[1:00:06] that declares
[1:00:08] Faith so Saints let's get rid of the
[1:00:11] five senses so if you want to receive
[1:00:14] something from the Lord you need to
[1:00:16] completely anal the five those five
[1:00:18] senses are we together it says faith is
[1:00:22] the six sense not to some people as you
[1:00:26] want to as mental telepathy some people
[1:00:30] think it's just mental telepathy right
[1:00:32] it says whatsoever you want always to
[1:00:34] call it many of them call it names but
[1:00:38] to me that was to brother Bram but you
[1:00:41] have to take it to yourself to you what
[1:00:43] is Faith it says faith oh my goodness
[1:00:48] where am I
[1:00:49] at oh my is the six sense is that right
[1:00:52] it says but to me it faith
[1:00:56] that is in above all five senses of the
[1:00:59] human body you see what it what I mean
[1:01:01] it says faith is the only direct and
[1:01:07] positive sense it's the six sense so
[1:01:12] which means your five senses are now
[1:01:17] real you can't see something you can
[1:01:21] also be called a blind and say you know
[1:01:22] what this is red but it may not be red
[1:01:26] you understand what I'm saying but Fai
[1:01:29] here is as real as I'm I'm touching
[1:01:35] something but now you have to analge
[1:01:38] those five senses then just grab these
[1:01:40] six
[1:01:42] sense oh my I hope somebody will cat
[1:01:45] something tonight and receive something
[1:01:47] tonight it says faith is more than
[1:01:52] sight faith is more than feeling you do
[1:01:56] not feel Faith that's right sometime you
[1:01:59] know the presence of the Lord will fall
[1:02:01] into a room and people say oh wow I feel
[1:02:03] it brother bam
[1:02:05] says are we are we together
[1:02:08] here glory to God he says faith is more
[1:02:12] than feeling you do not feel Faith you
[1:02:15] don't taste Faith you don't smell Faith
[1:02:19] you don't see it faith is the
[1:02:22] substance of things hopeful the evidence
[1:02:26] of Things Not
[1:02:29] Seen oh my
[1:02:32] goodness so
[1:02:35] faith is the
[1:02:37] evidence direct positive this is my own
[1:02:41] note just the same as the sight is
[1:02:45] positive declaring that you are sitting
[1:02:48] here tonight it says faith is direct
[1:02:51] evidence of things not not seen F tast
[1:02:54] smell or heard
[1:02:57] faith is as if can you just imagine this
[1:03:02] I don't have five bucks in my
[1:03:05] pocket all right it's empty I can prove
[1:03:07] it there's nothing
[1:03:09] here all right so
[1:03:12] Faith you the fact is there is nothing
[1:03:16] there all right there's absolutely
[1:03:19] nothing there all of you guys have seen
[1:03:20] it but faith can believe that there is
[1:03:23] $5 in the pocket and go inside and get
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:27] $5 I don't have to feel it I don't have
[1:03:31] to touch it because if I believe it it
[1:03:33] brings that element to come to
[1:03:35] pass I I'm just bringing you a little
[1:03:38] higher in faith here tonight are you are
[1:03:40] we together here tonight all
[1:03:44] right oh my is as real as the rest of
[1:03:48] the
[1:03:50] senses may God give us the revelation of
[1:03:52] what it is may God help us
[1:03:57] now I want to declare to you tonight the
[1:04:01] senses of
[1:04:03] faith is real and you can't tap into the
[1:04:07] channel of Faith where all things are
[1:04:12] possible Saint I just pray that somebody
[1:04:15] will come a little higher to reach that
[1:04:18] place where all things become possible
[1:04:21] and if you could catch the revelation of
[1:04:23] what this is you can get anything you
[1:04:26] want
[1:04:28] to tonight if somebody live here the the
[1:04:32] same way they came in something is
[1:04:35] wrong they have not entered into the
[1:04:37] channel of faith yet they don't know
[1:04:39] what faith
[1:04:42] is if you heal if you sick tonight you
[1:04:45] can't leave this place if you tap into
[1:04:47] that channel you will receive what your
[1:04:49] heart desire is I may not know it but
[1:04:51] God knows it and God cannot move until
[1:04:55] you believe
[1:04:57] you say brother Ariel what are you
[1:04:59] saying Jesus says I am the vine ye are
[1:05:03] the
[1:05:04] branches the branches does not bear
[1:05:08] fruit sorry the the vine does not bear
[1:05:11] fruit rather but but it's the branches
[1:05:14] that bear fruit so God will stay there
[1:05:17] until you believe his word and then
[1:05:20] something will happen sometime you say
[1:05:22] okay let me just relax and wait God to
[1:05:24] do something he will not do do it
[1:05:27] because the Bible says only by faith
[1:05:30] that you can please God so if you want
[1:05:32] to please God you must believe it you
[1:05:34] might as well believe it Oh Glory to God
[1:05:38] who who want to please God tonight oh I
[1:05:40] want to please God tonight I I I want my
[1:05:43] my service to be worthy H by his grace
[1:05:46] tonight oh my believe believ in God the
[1:05:50] prophet says I might go a little faster
[1:05:52] here just bear with me there's something
[1:05:54] good that is coming
[1:05:56] it says now the senses are worldly
[1:05:59] instrument do you believe it God can
[1:06:02] control them I would admit it but they
[1:06:05] are not given to us to contact our
[1:06:09] heavenly
[1:06:11] father those five senses does not
[1:06:13] contact our heavenly
[1:06:15] father let's look what it says because
[1:06:19] he is not in human flesh God is Spirit
[1:06:23] now we contact him
[1:06:26] by Spirit through
[1:06:29] faith so if you want to contact God
[1:06:32] tonight you need to come the way of
[1:06:34] Faith right it says
[1:06:38] believing oh Saints you can't get
[1:06:40] anything tonight until you believe
[1:06:44] it let me just say maybe it might be a
[1:06:46] bad news but it's
[1:06:48] true you will not leave this place with
[1:06:52] your the desire of your heart if you
[1:06:53] don't believe
[1:06:57] that's what God says and we staying
[1:06:58] behind
[1:07:00] it the only thing we saying all of these
[1:07:03] things is just so that you can be
[1:07:04] blessed so that I can be
[1:07:07] blessed in another message forsaking all
[1:07:09] it says I think that what the Christian
[1:07:12] are to do tonight oh my goodness find
[1:07:16] out what you've
[1:07:18] got if something gets just a little
[1:07:21] higher I can reach it I can't reach it
[1:07:25] rather I will get me a step ladder and
[1:07:28] climb up to it if some if something
[1:07:31] seems a little Out Of Reach in the Bible
[1:07:35] God has
[1:07:36] promised I will stay on my knees and
[1:07:40] climb Jacob ladder till I reach it cause
[1:07:44] it's mine God give it to me if Divine
[1:07:48] Healing is Promised in the Bible and I'm
[1:07:50] sick I will stay there until God give me
[1:07:55] because it's a
[1:07:56] promise so now we we we we we're getting
[1:08:00] somewhere so if there is a promise I can
[1:08:03] use Jacob ladder by faith and reach that
[1:08:07] promise and get whatever I
[1:08:10] need Saint there are one thing that God
[1:08:13] cannot do is
[1:08:16] lie he cannot write something and then
[1:08:19] turn his back and say I didn't write it
[1:08:21] or I didn't say it
[1:08:25] but God wants you to hold on to a
[1:08:28] promise if you hold on to a promise all
[1:08:30] things are possible tonight oh my
[1:08:33] goodness glory to God your five senses
[1:08:36] tonight are declaring I can't see it
[1:08:39] tiredness maybe there's so much big you
[1:08:41] know bills that you have to
[1:08:43] pay maybe there are many disappointment
[1:08:46] in
[1:08:47] life maybe
[1:08:48] sicknesses maybe
[1:08:51] anxiety maybe old
[1:08:54] age Maybe addiction maybe different
[1:08:57] things going on in your life those five
[1:09:00] senses are feeling it when you wake up
[1:09:02] in the morning you feel the pain because
[1:09:05] those five senses are declaring it but
[1:09:08] down in your heart you say God
[1:09:10] promise that he is my healer he is my
[1:09:14] deliverer he is my comfort so when you
[1:09:16] wake up with that promise you apply
[1:09:18] Faith to it you see standing up you you
[1:09:20] get up in the morning you ready to go to
[1:09:22] work you you ready to go to church why
[1:09:25] because you have tapped into a Channel
[1:09:27] of
[1:09:29] faith God charged your battery to go to
[1:09:32] get up to start your day worshiping God
[1:09:36] because you tap into a certain Channel
[1:09:39] and you got energized by
[1:09:41] it oh my we cannot receive anything of
[1:09:44] the Lord tonight without faith let's
[1:09:48] look at some scriptures here Isaiah
[1:09:51] chapter
[1:09:52] 40 oh my
[1:09:55] has thou not
[1:09:57] known has thou not heard that the HL
[1:10:01] lasting God the Lord the creator of the
[1:10:05] end of the Earth fth not neither is
[1:10:10] Worthy is neither is is wored there is
[1:10:14] no searching of his understanding he
[1:10:18] gave power to the faint and to them that
[1:10:21] have no might he increases strength
[1:10:26] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:10:29] and the young men shall utterly fall
[1:10:32] look at this it says but they that wait
[1:10:36] upon the Lord they shall renew their
[1:10:39] strength they shall mount with wingless
[1:10:42] ego they shall run and not be wored and
[1:10:45] they shall walk and and Oh Glory to God
[1:10:49] do you believe
[1:10:51] this how many of us believe it tonight
[1:10:56] yes I did not write it I'm just quoting
[1:10:59] what he said and this word is infallible
[1:11:01] it can't
[1:11:03] Fair hold the next
[1:11:06] verse oh my goodness I back I love this
[1:11:10] scripture this scripture struck me one
[1:11:13] night oh my long story but anyways I
[1:11:16] stand upon my watch and set me upon a
[1:11:20] tower and we watch to see what he will
[1:11:24] say unto me
[1:11:26] what I shall answer when I am
[1:11:28] reproved and the Lord answered me and
[1:11:31] said write the
[1:11:33] vision take your book write the vision
[1:11:36] write what it said sometimes s let me
[1:11:38] just open the parenthesis here you can't
[1:11:41] read your Bible every morning but
[1:11:42] sometime you have to write it
[1:11:44] down you have to take and write the
[1:11:46] promise put it in your
[1:11:49] Bible put it in a wall somewhere so
[1:11:52] every morning when you're going to work
[1:11:53] you remember there is a promise
[1:11:56] there every time that you come into the
[1:11:58] house you look at that little paper you
[1:11:59] said that's a promise God gave
[1:12:02] me since we need to get into business
[1:12:04] with God if we need to receive the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost we need to mean business until he
[1:12:09] gives us the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost we can't just stay there starchy
[1:12:14] and cold and look warm how much how much
[1:12:17] do you want
[1:12:20] it how much do you want the Holy Ghost
[1:12:23] because if God does not give you the the
[1:12:25] Holy Ghost you make him a
[1:12:28] liar because if it says repent you
[1:12:31] repent the right way you be baptized in
[1:12:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:12:36] did it the right way God is obligated to
[1:12:40] empty heaven and to give you the Holy
[1:12:43] Ghost because Oh Glory to God he
[1:12:47] promised
[1:12:49] it even the young ones if you stay in
[1:12:53] your room you know you did things the
[1:12:56] right way just
[1:12:58] wait he will visit you in that
[1:13:01] room you know sometime people think the
[1:13:03] Holy Ghost the experience of God is just
[1:13:06] the angel will fly out Saint it's a
[1:13:08] conviction in your soul no man can take
[1:13:11] that away from
[1:13:13] you oh glory to God he has to be a
[1:13:16] revelation it's
[1:13:20] personal it's not just about who is
[1:13:22] preaching it's personal it's an
[1:13:24] experience
[1:13:27] you can you can be down in the valley
[1:13:29] but when you remember that experience he
[1:13:31] energ
[1:13:33] you it will make you cry in your car
[1:13:35] when you driveing when you listen to a
[1:13:37] song you crying and people wonder say
[1:13:40] what in the world is going on with this
[1:13:41] man what is going on with this woman
[1:13:43] because youve met God something happened
[1:13:46] to
[1:13:48] you no man can take that away from you
[1:13:50] Saints let me say this no denomination
[1:13:53] no church nothing nobody can take that
[1:13:55] away from you because you came from God
[1:13:58] and you're returning back to God
[1:14:00] hallelujah glory be to God where was I
[1:14:04] at uh verse three is that right for the
[1:14:07] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[1:14:12] at the end he shall
[1:14:15] speak the promises of God speaks louder
[1:14:19] when is the appointed time when he
[1:14:21] reaches the appointed time oh glory to
[1:14:23] God don't worry you can lay down and
[1:14:25] sleep that promise will come to pass
[1:14:28] Hallelujah it shall speak for
[1:14:32] itself it says and lie though it ter
[1:14:37] wait for it because it will surely come
[1:14:40] he will not
[1:14:42] ter it says behold his soul which is
[1:14:46] lift up is not upright in him but the
[1:14:52] just but the just shall leave by by
[1:14:55] Faith by what his
[1:15:00] faith it's not your
[1:15:04] righteousness you can be
[1:15:08] righteous
[1:15:10] oh that's why is Jehovah Chen is your
[1:15:14] righteousness You Must Believe in the
[1:15:17] righteous one to be
[1:15:21] righteous sometime you know you can't
[1:15:23] sin against God you you know you did
[1:15:26] something wrong you go to God you say
[1:15:28] Lord you know I'm I'm I'm a I'm a sinful
[1:15:31] man I I need your
[1:15:34] help you are my righteousness Lord you
[1:15:37] said
[1:15:39] it if you confess the right way God will
[1:15:42] give you peace in your heart you know
[1:15:45] the devil will punch all your
[1:15:47] wrongs but when you point him the
[1:15:50] word when you point him what Jesus has
[1:15:53] done for you that some one he cannnot
[1:15:55] play with it he knows that is
[1:15:58] real so you need Faith to believe what
[1:16:01] Jesus has done for you you need to
[1:16:04] believe that he is your
[1:16:07] righteousness oh my goodness
[1:16:10] tonight with my my
[1:16:12] goodness the next quote here sir we
[1:16:15] would see Jesus we're coming somewhere
[1:16:17] we're going somewhere and I like this he
[1:16:20] says now would you ever know you touched
[1:16:23] him he says if if there wasn't something
[1:16:26] to come back and told
[1:16:29] you see faith is not something it's not
[1:16:33] a
[1:16:35] myth faith is the substance of things
[1:16:38] hope for the evidence that something has
[1:16:44] happened of Things Not Seen sense this
[1:16:49] is deep this is
[1:16:51] powerful if we did not have a prophet I
[1:16:53] don't know where we will be
[1:16:57] huh if God did not send William brandham
[1:17:01] we'll be in the full confusion
[1:17:05] here oh glory to God he says it's not
[1:17:08] just a make belief saying oh yeah
[1:17:12] Hallelujah I got it it says that's been
[1:17:15] too much in you Pentecostal people to
[1:17:18] begin with you rejoice about things that
[1:17:21] you don't have
[1:17:25] people holler about different things but
[1:17:27] they don't have
[1:17:29] it faith is absolutely a substance can
[1:17:32] you preach with me you know can we do
[1:17:35] that tonight it will help me a
[1:17:37] lot it's not a hope
[1:17:43] oh oh no I'm hoping that this can no no
[1:17:46] that's not
[1:17:48] faith hope you just wish that something
[1:17:51] may it may or may not happen but faith
[1:17:54] is in in you you know it's going to
[1:18:02] happen it says hope is Faith is the
[1:18:05] substance of things so forth but when
[1:18:07] Faith takes
[1:18:08] it it becomes the substance to you you
[1:18:13] hope for the evidence of things not seen
[1:18:17] you know what is the substance in I
[1:18:19] didn't put this the message there
[1:18:21] brother bam says in the message
[1:18:23] perseverance it says a substance is
[1:18:26] something you can hold on
[1:18:31] to in another message experience fifth
[1:18:34] by experience something you
[1:18:38] have Webster says something
[1:18:41] real not
[1:18:44] imaginary something
[1:18:46] solid
[1:18:48] existing
[1:18:51] tangible so you can get hold of it
[1:18:57] right my
[1:18:59] goodness it says there is only one thing
[1:19:02] you have to do what is it is to
[1:19:08] appropriate that Faith this word is
[1:19:10] strong very
[1:19:12] powerful you must be able to appropriate
[1:19:15] that
[1:19:17] faith and that faith is something you
[1:19:22] know not something that you at or guess
[1:19:26] at you know it something
[1:19:31] happens it says Through the Ages people
[1:19:35] has rested upon this so if you have to
[1:19:39] rest on it there's somebody before you
[1:19:41] that rest upon it he worked for them so
[1:19:44] if he worked for them it will work for
[1:19:47] you so it's not like oh you've been in
[1:19:50] this road before Oh you alone you don't
[1:19:52] know when no this is some the Bible tell
[1:19:55] telling you somebody before you went
[1:19:58] there and they came back with the
[1:20:00] evidence of the faith right there are
[1:20:03] people in this room they have the
[1:20:07] evidence they have stepped into that
[1:20:09] channel and they receive what their
[1:20:11] heart desire is there are sister here
[1:20:13] that couldn't bear children but they tap
[1:20:16] into that channel they had a children a
[1:20:19] child there are people that had
[1:20:21] sicknesses cancer whatsoever they tap
[1:20:23] into that channel they receive the
[1:20:27] healing so Saints if you leave this
[1:20:30] place in unbeliever something is
[1:20:32] wrong because people we all sitting here
[1:20:36] as the
[1:20:38] evidence we Are Witnesses we've been
[1:20:41] there we tested it we came out of it
[1:20:44] with with with a
[1:20:46] substance I'm sitting here as a
[1:20:52] witness s for me to preach the word word
[1:20:55] let me just say this is just God's
[1:20:58] grace as brother one always says if we
[1:21:01] have to trace back our
[1:21:03] families nobody will be even
[1:21:06] here God decided to rewrite our
[1:21:11] life when we were in sin but God in his
[1:21:14] Mercy he saw you he saw
[1:21:18] me you know it was look it was
[1:21:20] protecting you back to some generation
[1:21:23] prior to that he was looking he says
[1:21:25] this is my son this is my
[1:21:26] daughter you might come out of there
[1:21:28] with hurts and different things in your
[1:21:30] life but Sint God is looking at you he's
[1:21:33] willing to give you revelation of what
[1:21:35] these things
[1:21:37] means he send you a prophet for a
[1:21:40] purpose we're not just in this corner of
[1:21:42] this street for for just randomly like
[1:21:44] that there is a
[1:21:47] purpose you say I'll just open this
[1:21:49] thing you know Mary in the Bible when
[1:21:52] the Bible says the the the virgin shall
[1:21:57] conceive normally if we have to read it
[1:21:59] is that Mary shall
[1:22:02] conceive because in the Bible was
[1:22:04] written virgin but that virgin was Mary
[1:22:08] Mary came into this world she never even
[1:22:10] know who she was until she the angel
[1:22:15] came to
[1:22:16] her when the angel came and broke the
[1:22:19] Seal of who she
[1:22:21] is she could relate back to a promise
[1:22:26] that a virgin shall conceive and as soon
[1:22:29] as she believe it she conceive I mean I
[1:22:32] mean yeah she conceived yes
[1:22:34] indeed she did not feel any sensation
[1:22:37] she just said Let It Be according to
[1:22:39] your will something happened to her
[1:22:43] after a while we see the baby coming out
[1:22:44] we see Mary killing a child how did you
[1:22:47] get
[1:22:48] here how can you have a
[1:22:51] child without a man you know you know
[1:22:54] why because Isaiah said
[1:22:58] it you talking about faith you're
[1:23:01] talking about a man and a woman yielding
[1:23:03] to the will of
[1:23:05] God Saints tonight if you could yield to
[1:23:08] the voice of God something will happen
[1:23:10] to you since I'm not even getting to I
[1:23:13] mean brother one I won't have time to
[1:23:15] finish
[1:23:16] this but I just trust the Lord you know
[1:23:20] oh my
[1:23:21] goodness my goodness never learn to
[1:23:24] sweat like this you know but we thank
[1:23:27] the Lord
[1:23:28] amen it
[1:23:30] says Oh Glory to God I'll get the next
[1:23:35] quote and I'll go a little faster here
[1:23:38] it says work is Faith express it says
[1:23:40] now Faith is is a
[1:23:42] revelation is that right
[1:23:47] are is
[1:23:51] if okay I'll just go before there so if
[1:23:54] Ephesians chapter 2:9 it says by
[1:23:58] Grace so how do you get the
[1:24:01] Revelation the Bible says by for by
[1:24:04] grace are ye saved through
[1:24:07] faith and not of your own it is the gift
[1:24:11] of
[1:24:12] God so there is another portion that is
[1:24:15] coming out of here of Faith so God by
[1:24:19] his grace thank you so much brother then
[1:24:21] I appreciate
[1:24:23] it God God by his grace he gives you the
[1:24:27] revelation of
[1:24:31] something it's
[1:24:33] a you understand what I'm saying so it
[1:24:36] says not of work lest any man should
[1:24:39] boast you can only have faith as God
[1:24:43] gives
[1:24:45] you so you see it's a special Grace that
[1:24:49] God want to give to
[1:24:51] you so God decided by his grace grace
[1:24:54] and mercy it says I will open the eyes
[1:24:58] of this sister this brother to believe
[1:25:02] my word so when God gives you Grace he
[1:25:06] also knows that you will
[1:25:09] believe because he cannot give you
[1:25:12] something knowing that you
[1:25:14] fail so God in his Mercy he loves you he
[1:25:19] had chosen you he gives you even the
[1:25:22] revelation of the word so that you can
[1:25:24] come up to believe it and then as soon
[1:25:27] as you believe it you receive what you
[1:25:28] desire is your heart is desire is that's
[1:25:32] why when we sing Amazing Grace we have
[1:25:35] to trace it
[1:25:36] back how are we singing
[1:25:39] it Amazing Grace is God's election when
[1:25:44] was that Amazing Grace happened before
[1:25:46] the foundation of the
[1:25:47] world it was not the day you came to the
[1:25:50] altar The Amazing Grace was when you
[1:25:53] were in the back part of God's
[1:25:56] mind so as he was creating things he
[1:25:59] thought of you
[1:26:03] tonight sometime we think like oh man I
[1:26:06] just existed no you did not just
[1:26:09] existed or the scripture
[1:26:12] Jeremiah it says I ordain you to be
[1:26:17] Prophet when he was yet not even his
[1:26:20] mother did not even conceive him he was
[1:26:21] already a prophet
[1:26:25] Jeremiah chapter 1 brother one is that
[1:26:27] right I think it's in the book of
[1:26:28] Jeremiah chapter
[1:26:30] 1 oh my glory to God it says faith is a
[1:26:37] gift of God even now even how you may be
[1:26:41] yet it must take you must have faith
[1:26:44] your faith can only rest if you are a
[1:26:47] Christian upon the proven word of
[1:26:51] God so faith has has to be resting upon
[1:26:55] something it cannot rest upon your
[1:27:01] opinion your faith has to be based on
[1:27:04] something that is proven to be truth and
[1:27:07] there's only one thing that is proven to
[1:27:09] be truth that's the word of
[1:27:12] God it says five faith is a revelation
[1:27:15] of from God faith is a revelation there
[1:27:18] is where I want to stay there just a
[1:27:21] moment it's a revelation he has revealed
[1:27:24] Reve it to you by his
[1:27:27] grace it's nothing you did you did not
[1:27:30] work yourself up into Faith you ever
[1:27:33] have faith so you never had
[1:27:36] Faith huh is that a quote is that
[1:27:39] brother Bram are we reading the same
[1:27:42] thing right it's given to you by God's
[1:27:46] grace God reveals it to you therefore
[1:27:50] faith is the Revelation and the whole
[1:27:53] church of God is built upon the
[1:27:59] Revelation I'm not talking about this
[1:28:03] building I'm talking about
[1:28:07] you the next quote
[1:28:12] please oh my goodness oh yes this is a
[1:28:14] part where I would desire to to speak
[1:28:18] the message look it says listen just
[1:28:19] closely to this remark I don't forget to
[1:28:23] to get this now Faith is
[1:28:27] designed is designed to see what God
[1:28:30] will and want there is no knowledge that
[1:28:35] can do that faith alone is designed to
[1:28:38] give to the human race to find out what
[1:28:41] the will of God
[1:28:43] is it says you take your faith and you
[1:28:46] got it and don't focus with the word
[1:28:49] then leave it alone you won't you you
[1:28:53] got the wrong Faith but when your
[1:28:56] god-given faith focuses on the
[1:28:59] word you directly what in line and
[1:29:05] zeroed so you have a
[1:29:08] scripture you apply faith into it you
[1:29:11] are
[1:29:12] zero because God cannot fail so if you
[1:29:15] use his word you apply faith into it
[1:29:18] Saint you going to get what your heart
[1:29:20] desire is that's why Jesus says nothing
[1:29:23] is is there anything too hard for the
[1:29:25] Lord
[1:29:31] no God help us this hour great hour that
[1:29:34] we live in faith designed to to see what
[1:29:37] God wants how do you see it through the
[1:29:40] camera of his word his promise this is a
[1:29:44] full Revelation what of Jesus Christ it
[1:29:47] says when the faith that is in you
[1:29:49] focuses you to do this word you are
[1:29:52] focused away from the denomination and
[1:29:54] Creed and everything you focus right
[1:29:56] straight on the word of God you are zero
[1:29:59] de it only needs a little touch off amen
[1:30:05] it says that prayer flies
[1:30:09] straight in the presence of God because
[1:30:12] there is nothing to stop
[1:30:22] it my my my in another message where the
[1:30:25] BAM says prayer is not God coming down
[1:30:29] is you going
[1:30:32] up if you need a quote I can share it
[1:30:34] with you I just don't have it now now
[1:30:38] Joshua chapter 2 verse 9 if you have
[1:30:41] your Bible you can open it with
[1:30:43] me how many of us know this woman called
[1:30:48] RAB now this woman R she's called to be
[1:30:51] a heal woman that's what we call these
[1:30:53] days right
[1:30:55] correct she said unto the men when the
[1:30:58] spice came to her house now we need to
[1:31:00] pay attention very closely here there's
[1:31:02] something
[1:31:03] important she said unto the man I know
[1:31:06] that God has given you this land and
[1:31:09] that your terror is falling upon us that
[1:31:12] all the inhabitants of the the land fent
[1:31:14] because of you now look at what reab
[1:31:17] says it says we have heard how the Lord
[1:31:21] dri
[1:31:22] up so reab a prostitute living in
[1:31:27] Jericho heard the word of God because
[1:31:30] faith comes by
[1:31:32] hearing you must be able to hear the
[1:31:36] word of
[1:31:38] God she never been to church she's not
[1:31:40] even an
[1:31:42] Israelite but what came to this specific
[1:31:45] woman to be able to catch something
[1:31:48] because the Bible also is spoken of RAB
[1:31:51] but what did she tap into
[1:31:54] for her to join that
[1:31:56] family that was faith and it was a
[1:32:00] revelation that God chosen to give her
[1:32:04] what by his grace you see it brings us
[1:32:08] back when the mind of
[1:32:10] God she was a hidden but in the mind of
[1:32:13] God she was a chosen
[1:32:17] one oh glory to God we have heard he dag
[1:32:22] the Red Sea for you and then came out of
[1:32:24] Egypt what uh what he did unto the two
[1:32:27] King of the Amorite and the on the other
[1:32:28] side of the Jordan look at what the
[1:32:30] prophet says the token it says anyone
[1:32:33] knows anything about the Bible knows
[1:32:35] that the Harlot was what
[1:32:38] predestinated she sure was the Bible
[1:32:42] says that was Hebrew now is quoting
[1:32:44] Hebrew Hebrew CH 11:3 it says
[1:32:49] now oh she perish not with them who what
[1:32:56] she had to
[1:32:58] believe but now the prophet says in
[1:33:01] order for you to have faith it must be
[1:33:03] given by Grace you know why now she's an
[1:33:10] elect it was something that was already
[1:33:12] done s I'm trying to cut your attention
[1:33:14] somewhere we're going
[1:33:15] somewhere if you want to receive
[1:33:17] something tonight it's your choice God
[1:33:19] has already done it but he needs you to
[1:33:22] have faith
[1:33:25] oh my
[1:33:25] goodness that's right she believed the
[1:33:29] message of the hour you know a few
[1:33:32] months ago or maybe a year brother the
[1:33:34] one was preaching on uh uh the message I
[1:33:37] think he spoke about it on Wednesday he
[1:33:39] was talking about what is the message I
[1:33:40] think you read in the Book of John when
[1:33:42] you were going through the series of
[1:33:43] John the message of the hour in her
[1:33:48] time in her time God was the message
[1:33:53] when she believe in God she receive the
[1:33:57] message of the hour so the message of
[1:33:59] the hour is Jesus Christ the same
[1:34:02] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:34:04] Jesus
[1:34:06] tonight when she met that Jesus she
[1:34:08] believ in him now Jesus is the word do
[1:34:12] you believe
[1:34:14] it that same Jesus we open the Bible
[1:34:16] every day but it's laying
[1:34:19] there everything is there a revelation
[1:34:23] what is faith
[1:34:24] is
[1:34:26] God by the spirit revealing to you
[1:34:31] something that is going to do or he has
[1:34:37] promised it says now if you only hear
[1:34:40] faith comes by hearing but hearing is
[1:34:43] not Faith a love of bread is not the
[1:34:45] purchase of 20 cents 25 cents but 25
[1:34:48] cents is not the love of bread see
[1:34:50] hearing hearing only brings the word
[1:34:53] that produces fa Faith but faith is the
[1:34:56] substance of things for the evidence of
[1:34:58] Things Not Seen then you see you hear
[1:35:02] the word you see why is important to
[1:35:05] listen to the word of God this is
[1:35:10] it the you hear the word god reveals it
[1:35:13] to you that is true and by the spirit
[1:35:17] reveal true confirm your faith to God
[1:35:24] so we not just coming to church just to
[1:35:26] make as a
[1:35:27] routine God has a
[1:35:29] purpose God has a purpose in everything
[1:35:33] oh my goodness I'll have to pass the
[1:35:35] Bible talk about Hebrews chapter 13 it
[1:35:37] talks about jeffi it talk about David he
[1:35:40] talk about Samuel and the prophet it
[1:35:43] says who through faith subdue kingdoms
[1:35:46] they brought righteousness obtained the
[1:35:47] promise stop the mouth of lying these
[1:35:50] are the rord of men who did it
[1:35:56] they were dealing with situation but God
[1:35:58] gave them they overcame they over they
[1:36:01] actually was so powerful they quenched
[1:36:03] the the the power of of the fire by
[1:36:08] faith now let's talk about the God faith
[1:36:14] that
[1:36:16] sees the god of
[1:36:18] Resurrection I got my inspiration from
[1:36:20] this message here the power of decision
[1:36:23] I was just leaving the house going to
[1:36:24] work really quick in the morning and I
[1:36:26] heard it something told me stop there
[1:36:28] there's something for you and that's
[1:36:29] what inspired me tonight he says so the
[1:36:32] devil usually start a little flare you
[1:36:36] know situation come in
[1:36:39] church or a problem arise if people get
[1:36:42] distracted this is Satan that is doing
[1:36:46] it it says the devil use usually start a
[1:36:50] little flare so watch it I try to cut
[1:36:53] off the move uh he's trying he tries to
[1:36:56] cut off the the the move of God every
[1:36:58] time he will do that he still the same
[1:37:01] devil use the same technique that he did
[1:37:04] in the old days he still uses them today
[1:37:08] we could only read the Old Testament and
[1:37:10] we learn the TAC of the enemy of the
[1:37:12] devil how he that he does it we find out
[1:37:17] his power he had power and that power
[1:37:20] was
[1:37:21] death it says but
[1:37:24] he had no power beyond that it says just
[1:37:28] death end his power then beyond death
[1:37:32] Faith sees the god of
[1:37:36] Resurrection it says after the devil
[1:37:38] ends his power of death then he finishes
[1:37:42] the the devil can do no
[1:37:44] more but after
[1:37:49] death Faith sees the resurrection
[1:37:53] god of the Resurrection That's The Power
[1:37:56] of Faith to
[1:37:59] believe it says he we standing over here
[1:38:02] behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see
[1:38:05] with your your natural eyes now you
[1:38:08] might be going through a
[1:38:09] situation it's so dark things are not
[1:38:12] working you try this it doesn't work you
[1:38:14] try this it doesn't
[1:38:15] work now look at what the prophet says
[1:38:18] by faith Stand By
[1:38:20] You directs you to that God of
[1:38:24] resurrection and a God of all wisdom who
[1:38:27] has ordained our path is standing just
[1:38:32] behind every trial that's
[1:38:36] right that's right so when your natural
[1:38:40] eyes are looking at different things
[1:38:41] that is going on but God when he he
[1:38:45] gives you Faith you see beyond that
[1:38:51] trial situation can happen in church
[1:38:53] church just look beyond that trial look
[1:38:57] at something God is doing something
[1:39:00] because you're about to miss your your
[1:39:01] your your blessing if you get
[1:39:05] distracted and in the midst of all devil
[1:39:08] the devil situ then our mind goes to
[1:39:11] different things we become distracted we
[1:39:13] trying to figure it out these things oh
[1:39:15] what what what is going on here it's the
[1:39:17] devil but if you could spend your time
[1:39:20] on your knees say Lord help me let Open
[1:39:23] my eyes to see beyond this
[1:39:27] trial sister I think you can just close
[1:39:30] up the PowerPoint I'm just going to
[1:39:32] preach like there I think I I had
[1:39:33] different things but due to time we're
[1:39:35] not going to have time to continue to
[1:39:36] far here let's talk about Abraham here
[1:39:39] Roman if you have your Bible Romans
[1:39:40] chapter
[1:39:41] 19 oh my
[1:39:44] goodness or maybe if I I mention the
[1:39:47] quot you can just go to to the quotes
[1:39:49] yeah now the we just read there
[1:39:53] it says being not weak in faith he
[1:39:56] considered not his own body now dead
[1:40:00] when he was 100 years old neither yet
[1:40:02] the deadness of Sarah's
[1:40:06] home he stug not at the promise of God
[1:40:08] to unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:40:11] given glory to God Saint if you look in
[1:40:15] the Bible God visited Abraham seven
[1:40:20] time you can't read it you'll see it
[1:40:24] the first encounter Genesis 12 verse1 he
[1:40:28] was 75 and Sarah SAR was 65 and of
[1:40:32] course you know the story she was Barren
[1:40:35] is that right
[1:40:36] amen Now by faith God called
[1:40:40] Abraham he call and there even a place
[1:40:42] here brother
[1:40:44] says oh my goodness he says by faith
[1:40:47] perhaps he thought like this if there is
[1:40:49] a God who made the ark let Noah flow
[1:40:52] through he still live today somewhere in
[1:40:55] the land of the Heathen he was a
[1:40:58] surgeoner he touched the hand of God in
[1:41:02] there God gave him a revelation that
[1:41:05] there is a city whose Builder and make
[1:41:08] was
[1:41:09] God he was a
[1:41:12] hidden but for some reason he tapped
[1:41:14] into a certain Channel and that channel
[1:41:17] of Revelation when he heard the voice he
[1:41:20] stopped everything he said Sarah
[1:41:21] everybody come on let's back we got to
[1:41:23] go not even knowing where it was
[1:41:26] going but how many of us if God says do
[1:41:29] this we say oh God why you know things
[1:41:31] does not look the same Faith looks
[1:41:35] beyond you see Faith looks beyond what
[1:41:38] you can't touch what you can't feel it
[1:41:40] goes beyond that the second
[1:41:43] encounter God promised to him Genesis
[1:41:45] 12:7 I'll give you the L the third one
[1:41:47] Genesis
[1:41:49] 13:14 you know when after he separated
[1:41:52] from lot
[1:41:53] the fourth encounter MC the king of
[1:41:57] salom after he he was returning from
[1:42:00] rescuing his brother his nephew lot
[1:42:02] Genesis 14:12 18 rather 15 the the fifth
[1:42:07] encounter by
[1:42:09] Vision he gave him a pro promise of a
[1:42:11] child I will give you I'll visit you
[1:42:14] he's not going to be a leazar of
[1:42:16] Damascus but that child will come to
[1:42:20] Sarah he believed God and the Bible says
[1:42:23] he counted it to him for
[1:42:28] righteousness can you imagine you dying
[1:42:32] physically brother bam says I won't have
[1:42:34] time to read it he mentioned about the
[1:42:36] room of of of of of Sarah it was
[1:42:38] completely
[1:42:40] dry but what did Abraham tap
[1:42:45] into when all the senses was declaring
[1:42:48] that everything was
[1:42:50] dead but he tapped into a place where
[1:42:53] all things are
[1:42:54] possible oh my
[1:42:57] goodness I want to read the story
[1:43:00] here and then we'll close there oh my
[1:43:03] goodness may the Lord help us tonight do
[1:43:05] you love the Lord can we give God a hand
[1:43:09] please he is worthy of that he's worthy
[1:43:12] of Our Praise
[1:43:14] amen oh my
[1:43:16] goodness we we we serve a true and
[1:43:19] wonderful God he is not dead is alive
[1:43:24] life you
[1:43:25] know even Jesus Christ
[1:43:28] himself he came to this
[1:43:32] world Jesus saw beyond the flesh this
[1:43:36] flesh
[1:43:37] here he knew who he
[1:43:41] was the prophet spoke about him can you
[1:43:44] imagine Jesus himself had to have faith
[1:43:48] to believe what was spoken about
[1:43:51] him tonight we living under our
[1:43:56] privileges Jesus why gave him the power
[1:43:59] is because he believed what was spoken
[1:44:01] about
[1:44:02] him he believed the
[1:44:06] prophets David says in the volume of the
[1:44:09] book it is written of me he knew that
[1:44:12] the prophet the Psalms wrote about him
[1:44:17] but it doesn't just stop with
[1:44:19] Jesus the B the prophet spoke about you
[1:44:22] too but you need
[1:44:24] Faith you need Faith to tap into that
[1:44:27] place and to live
[1:44:29] accordingly I don't do this not because
[1:44:32] somebody's behind me I don't do it
[1:44:33] because I have the revelation of what
[1:44:36] God has given me I know who I am that's
[1:44:41] right oh my
[1:44:44] goodness Genesis chapter 3:15 he was the
[1:44:47] seed of the
[1:44:49] woman he knew he was the seed of the
[1:44:52] woman
[1:44:54] when something you know sin enter into
[1:44:57] the Garden of Eden butam says God did
[1:45:00] not let Adam and Eve to leave all to go
[1:45:03] out of the garden just empty-handed like
[1:45:05] that he gave them a
[1:45:08] promise so they left the Garden of Eden
[1:45:12] with a
[1:45:15] promise can you imagine you you done
[1:45:18] something wrong everything you know the
[1:45:20] animals are are going crazy because of
[1:45:23] the mistake that you have made but yet
[1:45:26] God in his Mercy looks at and say I'm
[1:45:28] not going to let you go like that and
[1:45:30] that same God doesn't want you to live
[1:45:32] this place this way that's why he's
[1:45:33] giving you a
[1:45:36] promise he's giving you this word so
[1:45:38] that you can hold on to that you can
[1:45:40] look beyond your situation and grab
[1:45:43] something that is
[1:45:46] real amen hallelujah the perfect faith
[1:45:50] brother bam says something here
[1:45:53] I think if you have that quote perfect
[1:45:54] Faith preaching 6063 is right at the
[1:45:56] bottom closer uh I think I never mention
[1:45:59] say now the only things you have to do
[1:46:02] then is have faith in what you
[1:46:05] are faith in what the word says you are
[1:46:09] Jesus had faith in the word of God that
[1:46:14] says what he was it is written of me
[1:46:18] referring to John chapter Psalm chapter
[1:46:21] uh 47
[1:46:24] didn't David and the Psalms and the
[1:46:26] prophet and all of them speak of him now
[1:46:29] in the following paragraph 74 paragraph
[1:46:33] 74 I think is the next one H look at
[1:46:36] what the prophet says for the word
[1:46:39] identify identified
[1:46:42] himself what he was that's talking about
[1:46:45] Jesus it says the same word identify
[1:46:50] us so it was not just Jesus alone you
[1:46:53] were also there let's look at scriptures
[1:46:56] here let's look at Jesus First Genesis
[1:46:59] Chapter
[1:47:01] 14 verse 10 the septer shall not depart
[1:47:04] from Judah not the law the lawgiver from
[1:47:07] between this feet until shalow comes
[1:47:11] shalow means the
[1:47:12] Messiah the scepter had not you know
[1:47:16] couldn't leave the the line of Judah
[1:47:18] until the Messiah comes he was the
[1:47:21] Messiah he was
[1:47:24] shoh Isaiah
[1:47:26] 7:14 he was
[1:47:29] Emmanuel it says therefore the Lord
[1:47:31] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:47:33] virgin shall conceive and the bear shall
[1:47:35] it shall be called Emanuel Isaiah
[1:47:37] chapter 9:6 unto us a child is born unto
[1:47:41] us a son is given the government shall
[1:47:44] be upon his shoulder his name Shall be
[1:47:46] Called wonderful counselor Mighty God
[1:47:48] the Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:47:51] Peace there
[1:47:53] Daniel Daniel
[1:47:58] 2:34 God Jesus was that stone that came
[1:48:02] out of that mountain to job he says I
[1:48:06] know my redeemer
[1:48:08] live to Ezekiel he saw the will in the
[1:48:12] middle of the
[1:48:13] wheel you see all of these things if we
[1:48:16] had to go through and look at all of
[1:48:18] these things there are
[1:48:19] plenty but to you Jesus says this son
[1:48:23] shall follow them that
[1:48:26] believe now it's about you let's let's
[1:48:29] let's bring it home
[1:48:31] now Jesus says the son shall follow them
[1:48:35] that
[1:48:36] believe if you are a Believer the faith
[1:48:40] the faith of God that move in you
[1:48:42] revelation will open your eyes to see
[1:48:47] beond and see The God Who Quicken the
[1:48:50] Dead
[1:48:52] you can't sit here spiritually you dead
[1:48:55] you cannot connect to the
[1:48:57] word but we have a god
[1:49:00] tonight who quickeneth the dead
[1:49:04] Hallelujah they can give life again
[1:49:06] Ezekiel says does this dry bone speak
[1:49:08] again can they revive again they can't
[1:49:11] live again it says
[1:49:13] yes and later on the scripture says they
[1:49:16] became a mighty
[1:49:18] Army it says father only that knows
[1:49:23] there
[1:49:24] nowhere he says speak to this dry
[1:49:27] born the power and brother bam talks
[1:49:30] about the fourth light L Wesley the
[1:49:34] restoration of gift it says now the
[1:49:36] fourth light is the revelation of the
[1:49:38] word is the time in which you and I are
[1:49:40] living
[1:49:41] in oh my goodness you can read in the
[1:49:44] message restitution of the Bride
[1:49:47] tree now Malachi 4 comes around if you
[1:49:50] have Malachi 4 verse 5 talking about
[1:49:54] us he says behold I God will send you
[1:49:59] Elijah so there's three of them there's
[1:50:02] God there's Elijah and there's
[1:50:04] you so you are part of that
[1:50:08] promise it does not just stop there
[1:50:11] Revelation chapter
[1:50:12] 10 it says verse one and I saw a mighty
[1:50:17] Angel but call a covenant Angel which
[1:50:20] was
[1:50:21] Christ revelation CH 10:7 it says at the
[1:50:25] voice which I heard oh my no no no in
[1:50:28] the days of the voice rather of the
[1:50:32] seventh angel he talks to a Prophet
[1:50:34] Elijah the prophet it does not stop
[1:50:36] there Revelation 8 to11 he talks about
[1:50:39] the bride she must prophesy
[1:50:42] again we see Christ the messenger and we
[1:50:46] see you later on the prophet says the
[1:50:49] bride the spirit and the bride say come
[1:50:52] but the says no he does not just stop
[1:50:54] there he says the bride the spirit and
[1:50:57] the prophet will say the same
[1:51:00] thing so there's not going to be a
[1:51:02] contradiction between those three so if
[1:51:06] God said it the prophet will repeat it
[1:51:08] you will say the same
[1:51:13] thing you talking about
[1:51:16] Revelation you're talking about
