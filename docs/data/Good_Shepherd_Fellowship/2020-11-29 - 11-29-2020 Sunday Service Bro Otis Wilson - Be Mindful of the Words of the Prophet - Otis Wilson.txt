was there with them for the thanksgiving and i told him i was coming minnesota for visit so they asked me to extend their greeting i just want to get that out of my mind before i forget praise the lord amen amen and amen it's good to be back here again for fellowship really i've been planning to see pastor one for sometimes we have some offending business to discuss so uh i wanted to come in in november in september before for my anniversary to bring my wife along so we can see him but she has something else to do so uh that didn't work up so uh i was planning for us to come again for the thanksgiving and that didn't work out for her again but i said where i got something to discuss with brother when i was very serious so i need to go so that's what i'm here to see him and do also fellowship with you praise the lord you know when you have the opportunity to see the children of god is very important because we are living the time where we don't know tomorrow tomorrow is not a promise day for us we only expect to see tomorrow by faith god never promised anyone tomorrow so we want to make use of every opportunity we have when we have the chance to meet like this so i'm happy to be here and uh and i believe that you have prayed so much for this service and we just want to just pray that god will come down and just minister to us praise the lord so uh i just want to say happy thanksgiving to you all and i trust that this would be a wonderful thanksgiving message to you praise the lord amen and amen how many happy this morning wonderful wonderful wonderful amen and amen hallelujah in no church this is the most important part of my life not so much of standing beyond the pulpit but being in church i'm not saying that because i'm here i'm saying that because of me what i'm saying being in church to serve god is the most important part of my entire life i don't see one thing i would do much better i i got my job i get my family i got my case but when i in the presence of god in church is the best part of my life and i take it very seriously and i believe that you all this morning have come here with that expectation you know i was just meditating i said lord i don't want us to come to church just because today's sunday and we want to make that like a tradition and then just come to church saying club and go no i want us to come to church meaning i want to feed that connection with god i want to see something happening when i come to church i want to break through this multidimension into the supernatural realm i i want to feel something extra so when i go home i can tell someone i met god today i you know go home go go home with that experience like oh yes i met god today i was in church today yeah i i really feel something today so when i'm going to church that's what i want because sometimes it becomes very easy you know sunday morning we got to go to church again or to the sunday it becomes like like any other denomination church but brothers and sisters this we are not a denomination and when you get that in mind we are not a denomination we are a spiritual people that have been called by a prophetic message and i trust that by god great this morning uh the holy spirit will just minister to you god bless you brother one for this opportunity again to come and just take the time to have fetishes we all and god reach the bless you all let us just turn to our feet let's send our bible to second peter chapter three i've been thinking that i had a message in mind when i told brother one that i was coming down and i say oh i saw to preach because instead of cody were coming so i was telling the thought but i think the spirit of god being changed him and taught i think over and over so i think this is the most appropriate one that he want me to speak amen so i hope that it will be a test giving message to you like i said so uh ii peter chapter three verse one before we can read the word let us just talk to god thank you jesus let us bow our heads and close our eyes our gracious father we thank you lord lord we've just been talking with brother one back and forth from the word we realize lord we are living such a time [Music] that we need more of god than ever before and lord that's why we are yet dismantled to just look in the pictures of this message the written word look at what time we're living in lord so that we can know what we can do next because everything is shaking nations are breaking israel's awakening the heart of man is fit in fear but lord you have given up your word your mind you have expressed that to us in this age to the ministry of a prophet so lord that's what we want to look at this morning oh god and just think of what time are we in and what is required of us lord what can we do lord to be more closer than closer to you and that's why we need your help this morning lord i need your heaven i know all these churches people lord have come from different places lord are forsaking everything this morning and i've got your law because they need something lord said i pray that lord you would just pull me aside lord and take the gift which is yourself and do something in our midst lord if there be anybody sick yet lord let that go free this morning oh god anyone come with a burning hot lord let the holy spirit come and meet that breading this morning oh god lord separate us to god for from this condition of god whatever situation it is lord we all need you this morning father grant this thing's lord we need total deliverance lord so that surrounding myself to you lord speak to me and yeah to this people the lord when we come to the end of today lord we we will see that clear patented friend dead in our heart brain within us thank you jesus bless the church back home lord my family law and the believers that commit them in your hands lord thank you we give you all the praise lord as we wait on you now in jesus mighty name we pray amen and amen praise the lord second peter chapter three verse one sorry can i take out my quote unless in the peter very carefully i hope i had to project some reading for us to read i want to take my own time i trust that we have time this is thanksgiving and i pray that god will give for grace but i want you to do everything give me your own divine attention everything you can do don't let the devil distract you because the devil the devil is good at that so just give me your attention you see peter said this second episode the love are not right unto you in both which are step up your pure minds by way of memories yes and that's what i'm here for this morning i'm not yet to preach anything new i don't have to bring anything special i'm just here to remind you amen he said that he may be mindful of the words which was spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and savior is ignoring this first that they shall come in the last days scofus walking after their own lost and saying what is the promise of his coming when would this happen when would this thing happen when would jesus come when would the rapture take place when will we go home praise the lord amen for since the father fell asleep sin wouldn't brah and die we still following this message praise the lord all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this their willingness ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of all and the earth and the f standing out of the water in the water whereby the word that then was being overflowed over water perich praise the lord yes amen i will stop you and now pray that go help you may the blood bless the ruin of this world you can please be seated praise the lord thank you jesus now um just for the record the tip my subject this morning will be be mindful of the words of the prophet i just want to remind you this morning you know it's very it's very easy as we we goes along the christian work and as time linger we seem to forget we seem to just forget about things that have been spoken of perfected things that have been said we just become church god now we we all believe the message i got to go to church today i got to be in prayer meeting and that is just all to our christian work now but the seriousness they they they the desire to become more of god seem to be dying so i'm just here this morning to just remind you about some things that we kind of like wake you up praise the lord kind of get you back on your toes and pray that god will give you grace praise the lord so i asked the brother i don't know if the brother received what i just said him i hope he get it he can just forget it for us this morning amen i want to read some quotes from the prophet like i said i'm just here to remind you i want to read a few quotes from brown this morning it will be kind of a little bit lame to a reading but take your own time and just follow the reading like i said i want your attention because the one you follow this very carefully praise the lord um okay let's begin this reading from this okay the city of laodicea let's just start reading from there praise the lord now i want you to follow this reading very carefully because i'm going to use that as a foundation and i trust that god give us listen robert brown said he said the name lao di which means people right was very common and was given to several cities in honor of royal lilly's sony just follow me very carefully this city was one of the most politically important and financially flourishing city in asia a numerous amount of property was equated to the city about feminine citizens it was the seat of a great medical school its people were distinguished in the arts and science it was often called the metropolis and it was the country seat for the 25th 25th other cities the peaking god watched there was zeus in fact this city was once called the polios city of zeus in honor of their god in the fourth century an important church council was heard there frequently earthquakes finally caused it complete abandonment praise the lord amen watch he said how fitting what the character reaches of this last age to represent the age in which we none live for example the watcher one god zeus who was the chief and father of the gods this forecast the 20th century one god five of us are religious preeminence that set forth the the brotherhood of man it is even now breaking together the protestant catalyst jews hindus etc with the intent that a metro form of water will increase our love understanding and care of each other the catholic the catalyst and the protesting are even now striving for and actually gaining ground in this union with the avoid intent that all other we follow this very attitude was seen in the united nations organization when the world leaders refused to recognize any one comes out of spiritual worship by recommending putting yourself all these separated concepts with the hopes that all the religions become invaded in one for all desire the same goals all have the same purpose and all are basically right we are not all the same i can never be a buddhist i'm not a caddy i'm not a denomination but watch what by brown is saying but brown is just trying to express to you the characteristics of laodicea for which is 50 in our day now i'm i'm preaching though you'll be mindful of the words of a prophet and i'm reading this for you to give you the foundation on which i'm going to preach he said i just want to follow the reading because like i said we we we walk in the lag of the message of the hour but we seem like many things slip in our mind and we're forgetting what time we're living in and the thing that supposed to be most important to us we're taking the less important so i pray that god help us to remind ourselves this morning let's just continue let's just continue the reading number one said in he said notice the name laodicea the people right or justice of the people was there ever an age like that 20th century church it does oh that has seen all nations rising up and dominating equality socially and financially he said this is the age of the com communions where all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in turi this is the age of political parties who call themselves christian democrats and christian socialists now you you become sadder to the massive believer trying to get themselves involved in politics even preacher beyond the puppet today they're trying to promote politicians such as sick spirit amen i'm telling you brother you have to be very careful i trust that god would give for grace amen he said he said he said and christian socialist christian commonwealth federation etc according to our liberate your login jesus was a socialist so that they excuse the game praise the lord and the edit church honor the guidance of the spirit practice socialism who told you that and those we ought to do so today no that is wrong i i'm not mentioning too much on this but when i'm preaching you follow this you just said it this very carefully he said when the ancient caller odisha the metropolitan was looking forward to the one world government that we are now setting up as we think of that city being the location of a great church council we see foreshadowing the ex-economic the economical move taking place today we're in very soon we will see all the so-called christians come together indeed the church instead religion and politics are coming together the thighs are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the ghana hallelujah but it was a center of earthquake such effort has finally destroyed it this age will end in god shaking the word the whole world that has gone off to make love with the o hallett not only will one sister crumble but the very earth will be shaking and then renovated for the men for the millennial reign of christ hallelujah brothers and sisters listen i'm looking for this moment of time i was just telling the brother yesterday i said brother i can't wait for the millennium i can't wait to see where i can sleep with my door open when i can just get in my car and drive without even thinking about any crazy crazy thing that will happen to me because during the millennial ring is going to be a path for peace the devil is going to be bad for that thousand years there will be no sickness there will be no sorrow there will be no headache i don't have to worry about markets i don't have to worry about money i would be living in perspective peace hallelujah versus sister i need to strive for this coming millennium i don't want nothing to hold me back i don't want nothing to tie me down i want to give my all to god because i want to see the millennium hallelujah praise the lord but the city was rich in doomed by the wealthy it was full of culture sounds abandoned highly today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful informal but cold and dead the churches are rich the watchers the people sing the angel but they are dead in wall-e we don't want to be like that church we want to be on fire we want man our man and woman to come here play instruments with the holy spirit in their hearts that's the church i want to see amen culture and education have taken the place of the spirit-giving world that's right oh my god and faith has been supported by science so that man is evicted of materialism you don't understand that greedy i'll get to that moment praise the lord i'm going to remind you amen praise the lord vibrancy in every attribute ancient lava disha is found reborn in the 20th century like this age in the mercies of god and he said may those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they be not particular of a sin and the consequence of judgment now listen what do you say yes he said the lord is beginning around the 10 of the 20th century he said perhaps nothing or says how long would it last as a servant of god who has had multitude of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977. who but listen to the reading very carefully listen very carefully he said if you were preparing a personal note here i based this prediction on seven major continuation that came to me one sunday morning in june 1933 the lord jesus spoke to me and said that the coming of the law was drawing nigh but that before he came several major events will transpire are you waking up be mouthful of the wolf of a prophet verb said on the sunday morning he said the lord jesus himself came to him he said that the coming of the lord is very close but before he comes several major events will have to happen before he come now listen very carefully he said i wrote them all down and that morning i gave both the revelation of the law you see the first vision was that muslim will even ethiopia and that nation will fall at his steps that vision surely did cause some repercussion and some were very angry when i said it and would not believe it but it happened that way he just walked in there with his muddy arms and took over the native then i had no trust but the vision also said that muslim will come to a horrible end with his own people turning on him that came to pass just exactly as he said the navigation foretold that an oscar by the name of adam hella would rise up as detective over germany and that he would draw the war into war it showed that sifa land in our and how our troops would have a terrible time to overcome it then they showed that hitler will come to a mysterious end the television was in the realm of war politics for it showing that there will be three great emptiness fascist fantasticism narcissistic communism but that the first two will be swallowed up into the term divorce and manage watch russia watch russia keep your eyes on the king of the north praise the lord the fourth vision shows the great advance in science that will come after the second world war it was he headed up in the visions of a plastic bob trip car that was running down beautiful highways on the remote control so that people appear seated in this car without a steering wheel and they were playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves the faith vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mercy around women god showed me that woman began to be out of their place with the grating of the vote then they cut their off their hair which signify that they were no longer on authority of a man but insist insisted on equal error equal rights or in most cases more than equal right she adopted men clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fact leave that april but branson with this vision i saw the terrible perfection and moral plague of the entire world then in the six visions there arose in america and most power a most beautiful but raw woman she had a people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roma catholic church he said though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some warmer rise in great power in america due to a popular vote by woman the last in seven vision was within i heard a most terrible expression that this is what i want you to come to because like i said be mindful of the wars of a prophet jesus taught wedding brown that this ever event when it took when after the seventh event take place that would be total discretion and what's better brown the last vision he saw was the wrath of the powerful woman in america he said after this when he saw right after this he said he said the last and seven weeks i was with him i heard a most terrible explosion as i tend to look i saw nothing but depressed catches and smoke all over the land of america what time are we he said based on this seven vision along with the rapid changes which have swapped the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that this vision will have all come to pass by 1977. listen what he said and though many may feel that there is an in in responsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man know at the end of the hour a statement in this prediction after 30 years because jesus said jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so i repeat as sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the world along with divine inspiration that 1977 auto terminate the wash system and also in the millennium i will leave that to you and your pastor to think before we say brother otis you give me some interpretation but listen to me he said now let me say this can anyone prove any of this vision wrong where they're not all fulfilled yes each one has been fulfilled all is in the process right now muslim evil ethiopia successfully then fell and lost it all hella started war he could not finish and die mysteriously communism took over both the other two incidents the plastic bobcat has been built and is awaiting only a better network of roads that want to already build the roads woman at all but naked and even now worry tape let's buy this shoot did i tell the people in my church you know i wanted to preach something different what come but i preached this message last week in my church and i said and the holy spirit tell me okay just preach the message here so it was not something intentionally died but it was just led by the spirit of god so i'm not yet targeting anybody praise the lord praise the lord he said he said women are naked and what even now wearing topless bathing suit and just the other day i saw in the magazine the very dress that i saw in my vision so while brad brown was living he saw in democracy the fulfillment of his vision sister where time are we living in be mindful of the words of a prophet praise the lord he said it was a plastic transparent type of cloth with tiny darkened spot that covered both breasts in the small area and then there was a dark place like a smart apron below and he said he said the capital church is on the rise we have her one

listen to the prophet it says concerning the last days that because of the abundant inequity the love of many will wash god you say in the laodicea oh last age seven who said love you love yourself so much when it comes to the teams of god you put it day it's a spirit we are living a very terrible time brothers and sisters if you don't see the desire for god in your heart you gotta check yourself right listen listen whatever brahmana said i'll read that a little bit so i can run you see our last episode he says seven love and love for what this is a prophecy by basically this is a warning catch that spirit operating in laodicea he says listen brother sister don't get yourself to the place that you think oh i believe the message i can go to church listen let me tell you something except you become born again with a new nature you are not a christian it's not just coming to church it's not just being a good woman or being a good man no there are thousands of good people will go to hell or because you think i don't smoke i don't drink i don't cheat on my wealth i don't cheat on my husband that is now all to a christian work i've been married 16 years i got five kids you think that's not gonna take me to heaven never cheat on my weather i would never cheat on my wife but that is not what taking me to heaven i need that change of nature i need to be born again i need a transformation i need the holy ghost i need god's spirit in me and when you get the spirit of god something knew that for your life [Applause] hallelujah listen we we get into the place where we be we're getting so soft we want everything to be easy and soft we want a pastor to say good about us every day this is not this hour this is the house that we need to be on our toes young man young woman seek the holy ghost rapture for you it's not about being a good boy i don't i don't say bad words i don't say f words i don't disrespect my parents these are all good things but your nature and you need to be changed god needs to give you the holy ghost praise the lord this is my thanksgiving mercy hallelujah and that's what i was telling my church brother we live in such an evil age see what is happening in the government see what is happening in politics do you really pay attention to what i read do you really see the time we live in it do you see what is happening in america you know that america become one of the metro nations also in prophecy according to revelation 13 and then in willie brown last vision it's also god has to reveal to him the rationale of the powerful woman in the america is that you need to watch this country but somehow we're in america we feel we are harassed we get we drive good cars we live in a very good house but listen listen oh you take it off i'm not feeling with the code yet keep it amen your sad love has taken all of your life and the devil magnify and and and and and and not just yourself law but you have become so materialistic the devil is working you so much that you become so materialistic until you want everything and in a good car this year and and any desktop or heart you buy a horse that you're not satisfied you're right even a new car you're not satisfied you become so materialistic until the devil is using that to capture your mind from the prophetic word of god until you don't pay you're not paying no attention to prophecy no more you we are not following events that will awaken us as a christian like i said we are not a denomination not just going to church and coming back that he said no brothers and sisters we are more than those people god has sent a prophet we are living in a very boring time because if it transpiring rapidly but we're becoming so complicit becoming so relaxed we're becoming so soft we come to church the pastor preaching we go back home we have no time to pray we have no time to study the bible on our own throughout the whole week from monday to a saturday we just about our own business no time to read no time to pray no time to concentrate your life no time for god at all why because the demon of said love have gotten over you and have moved you into the state where you become materialistic praise the law everybody want to take good nice picture after church and post it on facebook everybody looking nice taking the serpents we want that love that materialisticness catching all of our lives we forget about our soul [Applause] hallelujah it's a lot of material things with dick the place of true love now listen to what bran said he magnified true love not that you don't love god but that true love is taken away that you love that wake you up in the night and you go to god on your knees and you pray for your wife and you pray for your husband and you pray for your children that true love of god when you want to see the holy ghost in your family you want to see the holy ghost in your children you want to see god in your home in your life every step of the way that you love is dying but all you think oh i love god i can go to church that's okay i pay my tax and i pay my offering that's guru hey that that's official be mindful of the words of a prophet the devil is very smart make you it make you reach to that place where you just stop i'm the churchgoer i'm in this uh good shop for church pastors pastor one ah maybe perhaps playing the instrument go to church every sunday i'm doing good yeah you're doing good let me say yeah you're doing good but don't be deceived because i can guarantee you i know people but since there are no man and no woman who have come this way for so many years who that we taught today they are no more serving god because why they thought they were okay they thought they were doing fine i believe the messiah didn't win a brand they thought that i i'm good but brothers and sisters when the wind began to blow hallelujah when that waves began to blow then they begin to realize that the foundation was not on the rock [Music] hallelujah you have to place your foundation of the right and that right is the personal experience with jesus christ when you know something that happened with isaac i know something happened i know that lord has touched my life i know something has taken place in me i'm not just scary i'm not just putting on i'm not bluffing something has happened to me [Music] yes brothers and sisters that nobody needs to call me and say you coming no i know something happened i need a fellowship with my father i need a fetish with god i gotta go to church i gotta read my bible every day i gotta pray every day something happened to me hallelujah you see the person taking the place of the true love of god listen what he said he said we we need to guide against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so high people are getting so high in this life that you can't correct them anymore let me say the sorry sister but it's becoming more of our sister that you can't tell them anything i'm serious you try to correct your sister you're doing something wrong who you talking to that's true brother you're supposed to talk to me like that people are getting so high oh you

smarter than your dad or you're smarter than your mother that's what i can tell you every day i'm i'm helping you i'm trying to get you to the place where you can realize who you are this game they are nothing why are they taking you you waste your time all the way again what would they do for you but we are living in the age where the devil is hitting people and people are getting so high very brown said he said so many are getting so high because listen what he said he said because they haven't realized the effect of this last dewa it's a light this spirit and that is the effect that is making us so high but we are not realizing that we need to wake up church we need to be mindful of the words of the prophet do everything in this world to self god listen what he said he said it is time to draw near to god praise the lord he said it is time to join near to god and let him fill our life with his love i need more of god i'm telling you church we need we need more of god we need

own eyes when these things happen but ransom when he turned he she total destruction you you playing you don't know you think you think just going to church this is not the message where we just go to church this is the message we keep our eyes open because we are expecting the body change we are expecting to leave this as anytime soon we are expecting a rapture how will we go in the rapture with this type of condition we don't pray we don't fast we don't consecrate ourselves we don't know more of god all we fear is okay i come to church i sing and i watch it hallelujah that's it i get out of

king 22. and it came to pass in the 10 year listen very carefully no i won't reverse one the game first one again i won't reverse one and they continue today yes without war now let's see so when he had killed about elijah can you bring josh prophesied judgment on him he forgot why because things began to get normal no war everybody realized oh i'm getting good job and i get in good businesses now he ain't know the warning of the prophet elijah that is what is happening to us we're feeling so relaxed now we buy a new horse without a new car we got a good job so we are not so desperate for

but what we should be doing now in church running after money running after all these things when we see event may clap our prophet said we need to wake up this may become so blind all year but think about prosperity blessing now why it's very careful i'm so close listen so when joseph verse 2 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel now very careful for the rest of you and the king of israel said unto his seven know ye that raymond in gilead is ours and we be still and it it is not out of the hand of the lord of this and it is not out of the hands of the king of syria and he said unto jessica would that go with me to battle i was telling my church last week i said you see christian when they in need then they come to church [Music] people people only go to church maybe when they're in the desperate condition they want the pastor to do something for them or they want this brother or the one sometimes you don't call your brother for two td moves oh you don't call yourself you don't call your sister for two to the moment but when you when you know oh you you're in the city situation but this is talking here then you take the phone hey how are you doing today oh yeah sister i'm doing great you forget about the sister two three months you don't know what you're going through you don't know what he's going through you don't care but when you are in need then you try to reach them that is that they have you don't attitude about the church the doctor you don't come to church you stay oh no i got this and i get that seven off but when you get in desperately you know when the chest pray your prayer will be answered so got to go to church now it's good you come to church but when you come to church you have to be corrected then when those type of people come to church now when the pastor preaching then you're saying they'll be squeezing their face who are you talking to you think because i kind of turned up you'll be blessing me if i don't come to the chat number go hallelujah [Applause] when you're a child of god the lord will pull you on your back and then you'll run back in the house of god and when you come back here then we'll repeal you again [Applause] because you need to repent and give your heart to jesus give your life to god not can be plain church when you want the people to do something then you come look at there was no history when he had read joseph but when they making the visiting as a brother and he said oh brother you know what i ain't the problem you think you can be with me my god uh i want to buy these things my money shot can you add it up but someone you don't even call your pastor you don't want to say i would say amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] you don't call your pastor you don't check on him the the most important man that need prayer in the church is the pastor [Music] the devil attacked him the devil targeted his family the day the devil got him down the frog was scattered so it's your pastor that needs your call it is your pastor that knew your prayer it is your pastor i need your support [Music] [Applause] hallelujah but we don't know him until we are in need so the man came and said my man we got our place daniel i want to go there you you're going to go with me the man said yeah because you know the pastor you always solve anything you say you're having to say no if you even care they say you say i will try because he's just a pastor that's why i was i wanted to ask brother one because he ordered me i want to ask and say brother how you managing i'm that interesting because no matter what you do you have to be there for the flocks they can call you midnight pastor i need you to come to my heart you will get her in the night forsake his sleep get in his car and drive i do the same thing that's what i'm talking about so don't think you tell me something i know what i'm talking about [Music] it would take the last money to give it to you just so you can solve your problem it's the very same man you guys say about is the very same man you try to damage the repetition it's the very same man that you try to damage [Music] hallelujah and the brother said yes we can go what happened i will help you we'll go but listen first titty first four verse five he said under joseph and joseph i said unto the king now this is verse five and joseph i said unto the king of inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today listen to me very carefully any true child of god before you do anything you want to know what the lord say about it [Music] before you make a decision in your life before husband and wife family make a decision bring your back to what god said about it every true child of god every true christian and josephus said let us just acquire what the lord said i will go with you i will support you but what did god say that is a true minister you come to the pastor for advice he have to bring you to the world he doesn't have to tell you what you want to hear have to tell you what the prophet said whether you like it or not what the prophet said is what we stand for [Music] and he said let go of the law let's go to god in prayer amen and he said okay no problem oh i got 400 profit 400 prophets that will tell you what he wants to hear oh you can see in the last day men will have inches giving he to seduce his spirit go to churches where they want to hear what the pastor preached and i would tell them a church some of us massive believer we get into we don't go to church corona viral keep our home some of our churches maybe we they don't have internet so we sit down and listen to sick td jakes what other need call their names you know them who don't even know the voice of god in this day brother i'm not afraid to tell you if anybody has to receive abolition in that dispensation you have to come on america four i'm not afraid to say that they don't know the voice of a prophet so i would sit there and put that video and listen to what trash no sense you reject the message of your day you are doomed for hell there's a quote upon recognizing your day in this message i know if the shits that can pull it up listen robert branson praise the lord i don't preach alone but this this age is getting too evil listen what brown say his day he will have never condemned the prophet makaya with the word of god of promise to him he forgot he forgot what elijah told him so when johan told him he said let inquire of the lord he brought the 400 prophets sick minister that's why you see massive minister today the standing behind listen church let me tell you something i know we have internal security another brand preacher message called invisible you know the bread of christ on thanksgiving day i think about all these things but why would that do good to you when i continue telling you you are saved you are internal safe when you stay get crushed and married you don't repent your heart is why would i go and do to you when someone you come to change your gross marriage hate your bitterness in your heart you can't even forgive oh i tell i'm not mad with nobody i'm just mad with the devil [Music] [Applause] you don't even see your sister to shake on him properly you might you get history that bitterness is dead for so many years then you won't tell me you are internally safe [Music] praise the lord so he's sitting on the ministry of the people who are telling oh you are blessed hallelujah i dream a dream you will prosper i i saw this vision hallelujah [Music] those shakes blindfold on the prophet it's the same spirit that is in laodicea today someone a messy preacher will go and sinner and listen to some of these sick people in in and take inspiration for the instead of the message hallelujah that's what we're telling the people in philadelphia i tell them and say listen to me you some of you people with sick some of you your sister you dressed very bad these these days we just we're cutting our schedule and bringing it up [Music] [Applause] yeah you think i still playing for camouflage definitely kind of to look at your face and smile when i go by you tell your pastor to knock on my gun away but you know what i will always come here yeah it's getting serious somehow wearing dresses we're showing our breasts interesting spirit and you're not careful no more you want technology to squeeze yourself inside [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] praise the lord people are leaving the message cut in your hair that was a heaven jezebel so they have special people to preach to them and that is why this message is coming to most people in the message now they won't come to judge with the pastor undertale yeah you good oh yeah you're blessed you will go in the rapture hallelujah you are the bride of christ the blood of christ will land up with this world the proof that you are a bride of christ your life will be in line with this world [Applause] praise the lord so he said we got 400 prophets he messed up cannot bring that in the kingdom and the prophet saw goodbye and the message oh yeah i said with the temple preaching let me tell you something a true child of god a true child of god the deep god to the deep where the kaka is that was the economy [Applause] god the man was sick because something was not connected so he said man is that all the picture you get there's no more go back to the scripture my sister god bless you amen just listen i know you're getting tired with some clothes amen thank god you're leaving for yourself nobody run behind me i tell the pastor i want to stay out yet today for the whole day and tomorrow but you know i changed my flag praise the lord to the airport [Music] [Applause] first king chapter 22 where were we my sister larry so we can finish then the king of israel gathered the prophet together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against rhema glad to battle or shall i re forbid and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and jehoshaphat said is there not hap it's just not yet a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him the manner is not looking correct yay i'm not seeing something brainy inside i'm not seeing a message to bring a change i need to feel on the world i need something to tell me who i am i need something to change my life i need to go to a church where the pastor will preach the word i need to sit on the ministry that the power of the power of the change and he said there's nobody else here and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man glory to god one voice in this age he said there is one man mackay the son of imma but when we may inquire of the lord but i hate him why why you hate the man the man not telling you anything to me i want to tell you the word but you see when you fail to remember what the prophet has said that's what can happen to you that's what i'm here to remind you the money be mindful and have faith to go back to the mercy you fail to remember what elijah said because he has sat on me wrong teaching for so many years so he ain't not the true voice of god but he listen the fact of the matter is he knew you getting what i'm saying that's what jesus said he said not everyone that said allah will enter the kingdom but he that do it the will of my father he says somewhere come to me on that day and say lord we prophesy we preach we do many things but you will say depart from me because you walk of iniquity you know the man telling you the truth you know what we're preaching as real but you're faithful and leave it but your judgment will be on your own hands so i have failed to remind remember the word they said i got one guy here called makaya jesus if i say here bring the man but i hate him but he does not prophesy that good concerning me but evil in jersey first said let not the king say so and the king of abraham said unto joseph there is okay restraint nine then the king of israel caught an officer and said hasting hida makai the son of imla and the king of israel and joseph are the king of judah sat ish on his own throne having put on their robes in the va place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophet prophesied before them right and zedekiah the son of chanting made him horns of anger and he said dusty at the law how can the man so much lie you want to say a man was staying in the puppet and lie look at this man standing right in the midst of the people and saying dos you know what dost yet the law is and he said thus you're the law with this shadow post the syrians that have consumed them but let me tell you something before i close when you fail to heed to the truth god will allow you to believe the law that because of that lie you believe will lead you to your destruction because they have failed to acknowledge the words of elijah the truth god raised those mental giving a deceiving spirit because elijah all the prophesied that he would die when you think down the walls of the prophet that's what happened to you brothers and sisters be mumford of the worst of a prophet let us draw near to god amen i got to close now let us join near to god be very mindful of the words of the prophet we are living such a dark hour evil is too much what are we doing what is taking your time let us turn to our feet if you go home finding the reading of the scripture and you'll see what happened to ahab because he never recognized the voice of god be mindful let us be mindful let us go back to the tip let's go back to the book let us spend our time in the world let us take our time brothers and sisters check your experience with this message stop playing around
