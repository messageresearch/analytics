our house tonight father and bless the service in Jesus name amen thank you musicians let's turn to the word [Music] foreign praise the Lord praise the Lord I realized on Sunday I was I was longer kind of a lengthy service that's a very good sign to tell you that I'm not a teacher amen teachers are very organized you know they are organized they are in their time I'm not a teacher so but uh what uh what what was guten in edifying is the other Monday uh a sister called meeting and she had a um she had a she had a dream and she was narrating that to meaning and in as much as uh some of the things she said in the dream was somehow pertaining to to herd and and some things that she's going through that the Lord is uh lifting her out of but it was more ministering to me because uh there were elements of the dream that related with the scripture that we read he gave his Angel spirit and his ministers flame of fire so that was very edifying to me and I felt like we were we were right right down there in in in the middle of the book praise the Lord in the middle of the book so let's let's read tonight the book of Isaiah chapter 52. Isaiah chapter 52 we will go a little step further tonight on Paul a seven of Jesus Christ um stay all in the midst of the same thing so I will go a little further tonight uh 47 of Jesus Christ so we Isaiah chapter 52 less we will read verse 13. as I have chapter 52 verse 13. uh let's let's first read 42 Isaiah 42 before 52 as I have 42. Isaiah 42 we read uh first one Isaiah 42 verse 1 behold my seven womb are uphold my elect in whom my soul delighted I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles this judgment is not condemning judgment but it's a judgment of conviction praise the Lord amen is a judgment of conviction that this generation uh when you hear people don't judge me is just don't condemn me you know but uh judgment in the in the Bible who means instruction means conviction it could means uh uh leadership it also have the sense also of condemning but this judgment that he will bring to the Gentiles is a judgment of conviction I'll put my spirit upon him and he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentile he shall not cry nor let none lift up not cause his verse his voice to be heard in the street a Bruce Reed Shah he not break as smoking Flags Shaheen he shall bring forth joshmen unto truth praise the lord we know that uh uh this scripture was referred to our lord Jesus let's pray Heavenly Father we just want to pray tonight we want to talk about you the ministry of Jesus Christ we want to talk about you Lord God as the the the suffering servant Lord gather the purpose law of why you came down to serve us oh god father and that is the same thing that you have distributed to the body that we can be able to serve one another that's the purpose of the ministry is to self so Lord we just ask that God you will just minister to us tonight the different things that we wanted to look into we have a little more note than the time that we have tonight but we're just asking that you have your way in Jesus name amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seed so you look at this that there are scripture Isaiah 42 and then when you go to Isaiah 52 verse 13 the Bible said behold my seventh Shadi prudently he shall be exalted in the stroll and be very high now you go also over to Isaiah chapter 53 the Bible says he he sh I see the travel of his souls and shall be satisfied 53 verse 11 by his knowledge of seven justify many so you look all through the Old Testament the Bible is prophesying of Jesus being a seven these verses that we read is talking about Jesus being a seven and uh the theologians call him Jehovah seven uh Jehovah 7. so is Jehovah becoming man to serve Us Praise the Lord you look also in Philippians chapter 2 Paul also said that uh verse 7 Philippians 2 7 but made himself of no repetition and talk upon him the form of a seven and was made in the likeness of man so God became man to serve us praise the Lord if you get that Revelation it must never be difficult to serve God he became men to serve us praise the Lord amen he became man to serve us and now we can gladly return service back to him praise the Lord amen we can gladly return service back to him and we can serve him the most when we serve one another praise the Lord we can serve him the most when we serve one another I mean God is Not much pleased in our in our service if we keep the church ordered you know then we keep the dress cold and uh and then you know we do all of those things and never serve one another praise the Lord we serve the Lord the most when we serve one another so that's why we want to look in tonight that's the reason why Paul called himself Paul the seven of Jesus Christ I don't know whether it was last Wednesday or the Wednesday before we we brought out the seven scriptures where Paul referred to himself as an Apostles Paul he greeted Paul the Apostles of Jesus Christ so two-year Romans chapter 1 verse 1 Paul greetings he says support as servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle praise the Lord that's what makes the ministry effective when you when you realize your duty the ministry is an office an apostle is an office the work of an apostle is a seven the pastor is an office the work of the pastor is a seven the Evangelist is an office the work of the Evangelist is a seven praise the Lord there are the the the the the the song and daughter of God is also your office but the work description of that office is a seven praise the Lord amen don't take that don't take the job by just looking at the title read the description read the work description praise the Lord amen you want to be a supervisor amen just to be a supervisor the description there is that if somebody don't show up you will work for them so find out what is the work description and don't don't be carried away with the title are we together praise the Lord that's one of the easiest way I could make myself understood tonight amen and so Paul says Paul as seven of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated onto the Gospel of Jesus Christ The Gospel of God tied uh uh Titus 1 verse 1 he also said the same thing Paul as seven of Jesus Christ and an apostle seven of God sorry and an apostle of Jesus Christ praise the Lord are we together amen so I wanted to establish that we're talking about Paul as seven of Jesus Christ tonight we we will go into into some few things so just just again to be able to back that up is the ministry of Jesus Christ so we see Jesus being prophesied in the Old Testament as as Jehovah 7 that is going to bring judgment on to the Gentiles so he's going to choose men that he will fulfill that he's going to call men he's going to call you and myself to be able to bring this judgment onto the Gentiles to be able to bring his word to be able to bring his righteousness or or his life unto the Gentiles so it's it's a state of fulfillment of the Old Testament uh prophecy of Jehovah 7 Jehovah becoming seven in Jesus he was able to find one man where the fullness of God do word in to be able to serve us bring us the ultimate service the death on the cross to settle the same question praise the Lord he did the big part we must now do the little part praise the Lord he paid the debts we must now tell all that your debt is paid you don't have no reason to live under that bondage praise the Lord amen he did the he did the big part of it now we must do the little part to to let people know so we we we're talking about Jehovah himself but I would step back a little bit and like I said I was not able to cover cover all I was dealing with on Sunday so I'm going to go fast you got to you got to try and catch up with me if not I will leave you behind amen might do a little bit of too much reading this evening just to be able to cover uh uh some of the things we left we left out on on Sunday so on Sunday what we were talking about uh stay talking about Paul and Apostle but we were talking about the uh the apostle of our profession Paul called Jesus the pro the Apostle of our profession and our high priest praise the Lord he is our Apostle and he is our high priest of our profession our confession praise the Lord so we were looking at their man so you see Jesus fulfilled the Apostle ship he is Jehovah 7 Peter called him the chief Shepherd praise the Lord uh uh uh Solomon called him in Ecclesiastes as the preacher that's what that book means the preacher the ones that Proclaim that what it means are we together praise the Lord so let's go very very quick here the uh God God doesn't call the man to judgment with our first warning him brother Branham in a quick way yeah he he went over the the the the faithful Ministry so let's do that quickly if we can just run through that he says but you see in the church there is a pastor and that Pastor is a special person he's built to where to where he can put up with the forces of the people he is the burning Bearer he is the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down somebody got something against somebody else and sit down with them with them two families and and take care uh neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness see he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things praise the Lord then he goes to the Evangelist the Evangelist is also a special man every one of them are special in their calling there is no comparison here amen whether we're not running Rat Race everybody this bill different everybody is designed different for what they are called they are evangelists is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball he runs into a city and he preached his message then get out of there somewhere else see he's a special man praise the Lord we know about Philip he was an evangelist praise the Lord he was an evangelist and and I mean he preached uh the spirit lift him up you know well I mean that that is just a scriptural uh uh scene or the scriptural type of how the spirit deals with the Evangelist he lifting up whereby the Apostle the the spirit will set him down because he have to stay there with the people settle them but with the Evangelist I mean the the fire is right on him amen is Right honor him he's ready to go he can sit down are we together now uh on Sunday also we read a code where brother Brown says if if a man is called to be a deacon is better you stay in that office of the deacon now we're talking about the Evangelist you see in the Old Testament sorry you see in a book of Acts the uh the first church there were law that the among the seven uh deacons the seven men that was choosing to be deacons we realized that Stephen was a preacher and Philip was an evangelist praise the Lord so that gave us the sense that in in many local churches you will find that uh in in many cases you'll find uh uh meant that that that are ministers you know they were they will they will serve in the office of a deacon if they meet the qualification because you like I said on Sunday you see there there is there is a lot of similarity between the qualification of a deacon and the qualification of a pastor praise the Lord look on the brain and Ministry brother Collins was a Methodist uh uh Pastor he came he was serving as a deacon most of the brothers that were serving as a deacon when it came here to work we brought a brand and building the message the first self you know there were ministers you know in in the air in their group but they came and they were able to serve the church as a deacon praise the Lord amen because it also fulfilled the place where the Bible says a deacon must be able to teach at decom must be apt to teach now it does not means that if a man does not have a calling as an evangelist or a calling to teach he cannot be a deacon no no that's not not that's not what it means uh the the the the the Deacon being able to teach also means that a deacon must be one that is solid in the word amen that you can be able to go to and ask questions and he can put you right in the word are we together praise the Lord he might not be able to come behind a puppy with an emotion but he can give you a scriptural answer amen to a scriptural question are we together so I just I just decided to put this in because we're talking about the Evangelist he's a special man he's a man that is burning like a fire he runs into a city he preached his message then gets out there somewhere see he's a special man the teacher is a special man he sit back under the anointing amen of the spirit and is able to take the word and put them together by the Holy Ghost if you see a man there has a teaching gift he can take the Bible he can line up with the courts praise the Lord a man can take the scripture he can take verse by verse by verse and line it up by the scripture and if he can't find his way back to the message there's a problem praise the Lord or he can build you quotes and quotes and quotes and broadbands and bread basket and if he cannot find his way back to the scripture then there is a problem a teacher will be able to give us that balance he sit back on the anointing of the spirit and he's able to take the word and put them together put them together by the Holy Spirit that the pastor or the Evangelist either one could not compare with him praise the Lord amen amen as the pastor I have a duty to teach but I'm not a teacher praise the Lord amen so I I I I just I just trying to drop all of these things in here running my way now the next one he sees right here and then we find out the Apostle he's also a special man he's a uh uh sector in order he's a man that sent from God to set things in order praise the Lord amen the prophet is a special man the prophet is a man of whom the word of the law comes to because the prophet is so designed life that his subconscious and his in his first conscience is so close together that he doesn't go to sleep to dream a dream he sees it when he is wide awake see now that's there's something God has to do he sees what's going on a prophet Falls foresee the way see the things that is coming he sees the cup of God's Wrath fall before it is filled now look back there in the scripture you see you see uh uh akabas you know he saw what was going to happen to Paul okay he got a vision and so what was going to happen to Paul and then uh right in the service there in in Phillips home he he prophesied the man that owned these things change is awaiting him praise the Lord he saw that Paul was going to be bound in Rome praise the Lord now so he foresee way off he see the things that is coming he see the cup of God's rightful before it is filled he can say thus said the Lord amen God will destroy this city except you repent why he is an ego praise the Lord so we have that gift in the faithful and then we have a prophet that is a major prophet amen so uh the gift in the five four will work in a manner way you know or addressing things in the local church and even things about the city you live in about things that is happening you know is is then the prophet is also there now so we see that we have all of these things that brother Branham says here so we will see Jesus God has set in his church first Apostle a prophet a teacher evangelist and Gifts of healing in working of miracle and so forth all for the perfecting of the sins Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so what is he introducing here the fight for Ministry and the nine spiritual gift okay he's introducing the faithful Ministry just like how God has raised man and designed them with a fight for Ministry there are also nine spiritual gifts that God has given to the the church people that have the the you know the the gifts of healing the gift of Miracle will read through few of them tonight praise the Lord are we together amen now so we see here that uh uh these gifts are for the body praise the Lord these gifts are for the body there are some things there to share with you tonight that are very very interesting let's let's just go with them let's just go so we can manage our time question and answer a year he says here the Lord having a shadow oh please church have faith just a little while see you must come under teaching you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost is come my friend that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you have really got it or not all of these people that are you know that are separating himself you know uh you know we we have the tape we can listen to the tape at home God can speak to us through the tape you know I forget I didn't I didn't put that code there but it's a direct code but Abraham says God never ordained uh uh any kind of for uh how he called it now mechanic things to to lead us God or deemed meant to leave us amen so brother Brandon says here if we if we if we stay away then just think that we have the Holy Ghost we can be taught by the Holy Ghost by ourselves he says that it shows a little doubt that you really didn't get it amen praise the Lord that you really didn't get it he says see the way you are acting see the things you are doing if the Bible says the holy spirit is the teacher why did he why did the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church then to set the church in order amen praise the Lord to set the church in Autumn now let's go go a little further here it is it will get interesting as we go along amen and that is the way with the church if we could get away from our little differences and come to Christ and forget about the the the outside word all forget about our denomination and so far and be obedience children and be about the father's business to get so safe and to do things of God after why God will set us to one side and he will anoint us with the Holy Ghost and then we are positional place in his kingdom some has the gift of wisdom some have knowledge somehow the gift of tongues some preach the gospel some are prophets and other gift but now God is moving the gifts in the church are might as well say it it on my heart I see it I don't want to hurt you Brothers I don't want to hurt you sisters but the Pentecostal church and the four gospel people uh with these gifts do not know how to control them they they I guess they are all right but you are going why with them put them in their place look the the the first gift is wisdom that's in the nine spiritual gift what good is going to do is going to do you to have knowledge if you don't know have wisdom to know how to control your knowledge Paul says in Corinthians is just going to make you puff up you would just argue with people praise the Lord amen what good does it do for you to speak with tongues if you don't have wisdom to know when and how and to place it right are we together so you see then uh he says Hebrew chapter six I might have placed this uh okay healing should be in every local church all these gifts operating healing should be in every believer amen every believer have the promise that they can lay their hands upon the sake and they will recover praise the Lord exercise the gifts in your husband and in your wife if you feel sick say honey lay your hands on me because it's in the body it's not only for the preacher it's not only in the pastor okay we will tell the pastor later but let's lay hands on one another praise the Lord exercise the gift even in your children say honey come and lay your hands on me papa is not feeling well my mind is not feeling well praise the Lord are we together now so he says uh uh healing should be in every local church but don't go to seed on those gifts don't pay attention to give if God wants to use you for something he will do it but look after The Giver don't go seeding on the gift and that has been the problem that has been the problem praise the Lord we are not Pentecostals but yet we behave like Pentecostal or organization because we try to look for for manifestation to believe that God is in our mess praise the Lord we have the word let's look at what the word is producing in our lives praise the Lord if the word is not bringing you to conviction then you need to come to the altar are we together amen I was talking with a brother a good friend of mine you know we we Fellowship together and uh and uh you know we we share thoughts and all of that he called me and he asked me and he said he said brother one have you ever looked into the zodiac and I've been reading some things about it is is uh it's very it's very exciting I said yeah I remember I look into that couple of times and then you know and we were just talking you know and he says wow it was amazing I was reading something you know brother brand mentioned the Zodiac and it just caught my attention in all of that so as we Fellowship you know uh uh and and you know just uh sharing with one another and uh I I then you know I caught a thought and I told him I said look you see yeah looking back to the zodiac uh uh we we can we can look and read things about it and and be able to appreciate you know some of the things there but uh we will never be able to go into the depth the more you try to do that you will straight away the reason is because God has given us his word job could get more from the Zodiac because that was what he had that was what he had he could look to the stars and see things that was what he had God spoke to them through that because that was what they had God gave you this why not look in this why not look in this this is your zodiac are we together amen praise the lord well you can bring things from the Zodiac that we edify the body are we together so you see it's almost like the gift in the church tongs was the least gift God used that at the beginning praise the Lord but where where are we now we are not even in the eye age the IH is the prophet where are we we are in the intelligence we are in the intelligence what does that tell us you know I've I've been I've been selling something on artificial intelligence I've been looking at uh intelligence and and just saying that uh you know as I was reading all of those things I said way back I mean in the 50s and in the back their brother Brandon is telling us about uh intelligence you know you remember that story where he he met that uh in theater about the Apple you know and say Ben was have you backslotted to be walking around with preachers you know and this is uh you know and brother Brahms is can you tell me what intelligence put the sap back in the Earth to stay there until winter pass and bring it back up again praise the Lord and he led the man to Christ because the man could see that behind nature there was an intelligence actually are we together and we talk about the mind of Christ the mind of Christ is the age of intelligence is the age of intelligence if we can just uh you know uh meditate upon the word of God feed our mind with with the thoughts of God praise the Lord you can also just rebuke the Devil with a thought if you can just feed your mind with the thought and that's the reason why I mean he will send every bombing every nasty thing that he can to our mind because he knows that's where we are praise the Lord amen what different it would be if the people comes to church you know and then they're just just take that time relax their mind take everything keep their mind on Christ what a service we could have praise the lord well you see he will he will now want to he will do everything to distract us you know we can come 40 minutes before service and and I mean take the time to clean our nails take the time to you know uh uh you know do everything is just not to get our mind on Christ are we together now see what brother Brandon said yes there's something I read today I I kept that and it took me the whole while to look for it I didn't know where I kept it but uh we will get down to it I'll share it with you I'm trying to to be nice tonight so I'm running but Brian says here he says Martin Luther once after speaking in tongues he was asked why he didn't preach it he said if I preach that my people will go after the gift instead of The Giver Moody one time speaking and begin when when when he was preaching saw on the inspiration he spoke with tones he said God forgive me for uh modern foolish words certainly see and they had those things We Believe those things but they must be put in their place and they must not be set as evidence no guilt must be served as evidence amen not even because a man preached must be served as evidence are we together the thing there must be the evidence of the Holy Ghost to you is the constant longing in your heart to do right it means that God is dealing with you your desire to do right your desire to please God your desire to live above your weaknesses is to prove that God is dealing with you are we together am I going too fast now listen to this he says I know people who could speak with tongues this morning is that was morning for him but it's evening for us setting right in this church and I put this quote here because I know that in this church I know gifted people that are in this church amen I remember one time we had a prayer meeting some time ago and uh right in church here and and I mean we prayed and we prayed and we prayed and for some reason uh I heard a young person and uh I mean they were they were pouring their heart out and and and pretty soon they started missing their words because they were so caught up in prayer and I just felt like there's a gift hanging over that child if they can just give themselves to God praise the Lord as a pastor you wash those things you wash it you just prayed you just prayed you don't feed things into people mind you would like God to deal with them I know people who speak with tongues this morning sitting right there in church if there was no interpreter may they be daring to do so praise the Lord because we have the gift see you got to remember them we means was born under a setting line I will come back to them your birth has a lot to do with it amen it's your name is all about you has a make up to it your makeup has to do with faith no matter what it is this is something yet again and I love this one he says I believe that a Spirit-filled man or woman or a child a Spirit-filled man or woman or a child that live under the altar of God who lived there long until they will be speaking in tongues and that's that's you know the gift of tongues is just like the first thing that a baby does when a baby is born the first thing the baby do to use their tongue and cry yeah yeah yeah that's the first thing that's what the gift of tongues is to the church and many times many people uh uh experience that you know the experience there in a sense that like brother Branham says was what are the spiritual men or the woman or the child if they will live under the altar what does he means about that if he would live a consecrated life a prayerful life he says that it will not take long until they will speak with tongues when a person really gets down into praying you guess down into praying where you are so involved and you are crying before God you are pouring out your heart before God many times you speak with tongues why because you get to the place where you you remember words that you that that have no understanding but your heart knows what you are saying to God you are speaking with tongues praise the Lord amen for for the many times that I've experienced that it has been with me in prayer but you see that we we we're living in an age where the uh uh uh the the the the church denomination has just make it because they have make it an Evidence now that's the reason why everybody has to drag themselves into it and you know it have become what it has become and not because it has become what it has become become we must degrade it no it's not because it is what it is what the church has make it means that we don't need it no we need it if you want to experience it better balances live under the altar he says live under the altar of God and it will not take long you will ask yourself what have I just said praise the Lord you will also worse that you cannot repeat again but your heart will feed God are we together are we together okay I think I'm doing well come back to my message I just want I just wanted to run through this uh now uh uh uh uh listen to this now this is this is very beautiful you see if I tell you that's that's a question and answer your number three that was a program I found someone not a program excuse me on an interview this morning baby I'm going to talk about something very important now listen to me let's read together on an interview this morning a person I guess they are still here in the building uh uh about speaking with tongues the person is a genuine person a real person and they have live right and they have heard me say the evidence of the Holy Ghost wasn't speaking in tongues and it isn't but I advise that person to ask God to let them either speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature what is he talking about is interperson nature to have an Evidence the person needs some physical manifestation to confirm it to them are we together now we've brought Abraham being a prophet and and and and the gift of vision looking into people's life he could see that this person is a real Christian this person is born again they have the Holy Ghost but the the person is struggling because they are looking for some physical manifestation so he said okay I advise the person to ask God to let them speak in tongues or prophesy because it's the nature is going to settle them the moment they can experience that they are going to be settled it does not mean that they will not have battle they will not have challenges but it is God deals with us with our nature praise the Lord that's why your battle will not be another person battle he don't give us nothing that we can bear because he know what he puts in US praise the Lord some people can be going through things and different things in their life all they need is just a spiritual dream the moment they have that is set to them praise the Lord I'm different all I need I must just come to the world the word speaks to me all the time I don't dream I do have dreams let me not say I don't dream like I just sleep with my eyes open no I close my eyes amen well I'm not built that way but the word speaks to me all the time all the time things at home things in church things about people I would just be there in the world and something I will be reading something was just question to me I said that's it so let's continue to read here I I knew that this would be a blessing to you so brother Graham says the first thing I went to that person and found their birthplace when he says I went to that person with me by vision found their birthplace and what sign they were born on Earth and I could tell what their birth was which way which way is set in their natural nature set them in a certain line now you see the whole thing it goes It goes with us in every way now look at this the constellation of the stars that live the wise men amen the three wise men were not three brothers that were born in the same house no they were not living together amen but there were three men that had the gift to read the Stars amen and every one of them as they were looking at the constellation of the Stars they were reading the message that a star would rise up in Jacob that style means a king would be born you know and that's how they gather their gifts and so what did they do aligned them up to Jerusalem right now I'm going to go into something tonight and and and the same thing with us even with a church you have a preacher that uh that that is you know that is that is gifted in a certain way and uh that's that's the reason why I better bam said we must we must all be 100 together in the word if there is one suspiciousness you're not going to go any further I can be a blessing to you and that just declared thought about it neither you can be a blessing to me now brings it in Family Life the same thing in in in marriage I mean we get we get so caught up with you know love and you know love and that we we get so wrapped up in the emotions that we don't even see this spiritual part of it right even in family life sometimes you go through your different challenges and all of that and and you get to the place where you start to become established in your home and settle in what actually happened is that you're born on a different nature this the other person born on a different nature even your children are now born under the same stars that you are how many comes in the home when we all starts to line up right God giving the grace word I'm lining up my nature with my wife then pretty soon what you will realize is that the fusing will start dropping right amen we start understanding our children and we're lining up with them we're now forcing them to do things the way we want things done we are understanding what is this child dealing with how can I support them what is this my wife dealing with what is this my husband dealing with so when all of those things line up then there is harmony praise the Lord instead of looking at all that this child is just a child of the devil you born a child of the devil hold this one this uh oh my God this Wonder you give birth to it are we together let me leave the husband and wife you figure that out for yourself but you see this is it's uh that's that's what it is he said brother Brown says I went back to look at her birthplace John Ryan that that got his sight under the Bible he came in the prayer line the first time and then brother Brandon prayed for him and uh you know he went and he came back again he says he said Brandon uh you know uh on a vision Broadband says I told you say you believe that you receive yourself he said yes I believe about it my eyes is now open Reverend says on a vision I realize that he's a Catholic and Catholic love to confess so I told him go confessing so he picked that thing up and when John Ryan go confessing he just lined his nature with the word that's all we need that's all we need whatever we are struggling with lining up with the word you don't need to break your bed you don't need to bust the wall you just need to submit yourself to the word created the universe there is nothing in us that it cannot deal with our impatience of submitting to the world our struggle our stubbornness of just saying be it unto me according to your word and creating an expectation are we together let's enjoy this together amen if that's the only thing we can say tonight then I shall be a blessing to you he said first I went back and and and uh to that person found their birthplace in what sign they were born on them and they could tell her and could tell what their birth was and which way is set in the unnatural nature set them in in a setting line then when they are reborn again they are over here in another nature amen natural nature is line up this way and then the new birth is here praise the Lord but you see the the the the the the you know the just like the new birth don't change the color of our skin amen it is how we have to carry this body along with the new birth are we together they are over here on another Nation now then when you find it when when you find into this nature that's the inside the unconscious inside conscious they are subconscious move you one way that's your natural birth then they will they will make up something and then a push they push them what under afford and put them in as a split condition they don't know what to do they will say the Lord want me to do this the answer oh I just know is lined up with the scripture and they will start to do it and the first thing you know sit on on this outside will show them all kinds of uh defect in it and then this says oh I guess you know they will listen to Satan see you have got to take that inside something that's what on the inside of you their scripture and don't let sit and stand any word hold to that right amen no matter how your body is pulling you whole to your conviction go to what you believe in your heart no matter how the devil is blasting your mind hold to that thing Lord I know you promised me Lord this is your word Lord you can do it that's his duty to stand there they are set on duty to stand there and pound at you like that but don't you listen to him but that person I told them they said well now if I could just be sure of having the Holy Ghost see uh uh a deadly person a real loyal person with the Holy Ghost but it will be good for her to say father just give me this for something to stand on your Broadband was struggling not to say whether it was a man or the woman but you see here he let it out you know praise the Lord he was trying to to net but uh uh you know he says a real loyal person with the Holy Ghost so he knows that she had the Holy Ghost but she's on the other side struggling if I could really have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord which of course I think in most cases it's a good place to be amen it's a good place to be than to be overconfident and then just going to sleep I think we just read this tonight and prayed okay now if I taught it if I taught it like that people will reach out and get a hold of that without having what that person's got so what the brother balance is if I was teaching they are speaking in tongues was the evidence people will go out for speaking in tongues and not having a real life praise the Lord they will go out for speaking in tongues and not having the real life see the Holy Ghost doesn't speak with tongues but you got to have the Holy Ghost first before it can speak with tongues now you get it see if you reach out and get a hold of a gift of speaking in tongues now remember that can be a genuine gift that could be the Holy Ghost speaking with you speaking in you wave unknown terms and you did be lost and go to hell yeah because your flesh could be anointed amen look at this uh uh Saul disobeyed and uh he sent his servant to go to go meet uh Samuel when they get there they started prophesying he sent another seven again to go meet Samuel he got there he to the spirit God on him he's not a prophesy saw with throwing Javelin and everything he got in the presence of Samuel he too started prophesying praise the Lord while the atmosphere around the prophet just anointed their flesh so you see yeah I mean the the way God deals with us that's what that Prophet cries uh you know in that Vision stay in line just line up with the word just line up with the word keep our hearts under the altar take every foolishness away you I mean you will enjoy your Christian Life it is going to be sweeter amen because you see the Christian life is not we we are not fighting for victory no we are fighting from victory from Victory because Jesus has already overcome everything he have already won it we're standing from Victory going forward so it has to be Victory and victory and Victory are we together so you see the the the I mean the the gifts are there in the body I mean even even our little group here I mean uh I mean some of the things that I've I've seen and I mean some of the things that the Lord has has done year that you know I've seen people you know uh uh having visions praise the Lord we prayed about it we watch it we see it happening but we don't want to use give as a seed nor we don't want to use give as a seed then before Sunday there are 20 different dreams on paper then the church become dreaming Church when we're supposed to be living church not dreaming Church living are we together praise the Lord I mean I can I can ask you to dream dreams I can take it away from you if you are Dreaming Dreams there's no way that I'm not discouraging that but that's not where the emphasis is that's not where the dealing of the spirit is are we together now you see that the gifts like we said on on Sunday is is for the edifying of the body okay it's for the edifying of the body so even if there is a gift that a person have if you are not in church your gift will never be edifying because it's giving for the body and if you are separated from the body how will you find your place how will you find your gift praise the Lord amen what is given to us what is promised to us in this age honor the son of man Ministry is the literal life of Jesus Christ that's what is promised to us that our life struck in the human soul go away from Ministry over us if he brought one crop he can bring many more Sons and Daughters to manifestation are we together he can bring many more Sons and Daughters to manifestation if we just wash that it's the literal life amen is the life that is behind the name that makes the demon the demon tremble amen is the life that is behind the name are we together so I just I wanted to I just wanted to finish run through my my notes and uh that portion of it uh there's uh there's another part of it it's already nine o'clock so uh we will ask the musicians to come and we will just all take our our hearts to the Lord in prayer uh or take our hearts to the Lord in prayer [Music] I love that I love that uh you know when this little quote I read

foreign Jesus draw me close Jesus Draw Me Close Jesus draw [Music] thank you let's sing that together before we prayed Jesus draw me close out onto you [Music] and let the world around me fade away

Hallelujah why the musician plays Softly while the musician plays softly and quietly tonight let's just speak to the Lord together and from wherever you are we just just look at these things in the light of the world see how the prophet of God laid him down these things are for the benefit of the church they are not difficult things they are things that he gave to the church he's there the gifts that he gave to the church but he don't want us to be spoiled on gift he want us to get a hold of The Giver he want us to live a life with our heart honor the altar constantly how much time do we spend in his presence what is our prayer life do we ever take up time and just and just spend it with the Lord say Lord I I gave away my breakfast and and I'm I'm just going to spend time with you I give away my launcher uh do we just it's there for our benefit this is a life of abundance it's a life that we can enjoy it's a life we can step forth it's not just a life for us to be wandering and hoping it's a life for us to be believing we must be believing we must be on the expectation we must build expectation I know God is going to do it he's going to come at the scene we are not even started yet and then we are giving or we are throwing the tower we are making excuses [Music] young people you have the time to be able to build a prayer life for yourself say Lord I wanna I wanna have a life that that come in submission to you I want to have a time where I can just slip in my room and get on my knees and pray you are not too young for that you are not too little for that [Music] where you you get it from there that the first thing that comes on your mind you get on your knees you turn on your bed you say Jesus thank you for today Lord thank you for waking me up I love you you are not too young for that he's a living God that lives among his people he's a god that is real [Music] if we can just line up if we we can just line up here we are born there they are different constellations in our homes different constellation in our family sometimes we get so caught up in our mind the devil fear our taught this child is so stubborn discharge and that's all we blow the trumpet and never find and never watch and say Lord how we can line up and you speak those positive things you may just find the positive ingredients where you can just be able to line up if I can support them in this area if I can support them in this area just so we can come into a consolation then we can find our way down to Jerusalem then we can we can come and worship because we have seen his style in the East and we have come to worship all coming to church will be a joy because we can we can be singing in a car or we can be we can be all laughs into the same thing not arguing

unique way that he's dealing with us and until we can understand it until we can submit ourselves to it we will not enjoy service become beautiful if our mind is here if I want if if we are part of what is happening here whatever but whatever gift you have would never be a benefit to this church when you are just in and out when you are just in and out I know there are people that can't make the service but their heart is here they are following what is happening here they are walking around different things in their home or different things maybe some is because of distance so am I praying Lord give me the perfect schedule I love to be the church oh Father line us up Lord line us up with your word line us up with the constellation there is a consolation taking place in the building
