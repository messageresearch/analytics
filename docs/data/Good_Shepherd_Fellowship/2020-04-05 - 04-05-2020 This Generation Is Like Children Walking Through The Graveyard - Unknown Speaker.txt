he has that blood cancer and just a little seven-year-old boy and we've been praying for him daily and so we're believing for him and let's remember I mentioned on Wednesday night brother Ike la Fontaine came down with the Cova 19 and so he's not feeling too bad but we just need to remember him in prayer and also I think there was a family but their Daniel Jones and his wife and three daughters I think we mentioned that Wednesday night ooh that they came I think there are missionaries to Thailand and so we just need to keep them in prayer because they came down with that sickness too so also from mother and Steve Cassidy he mentioned to pray for him he says I've got a second job interview with a company called prime therapeutics on Monday at 11:00 a.m. so if you want to write

Thanksgiving amen praise the Lord praise the Lord Amen thank you sister now me that will be all for the the music and again we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is the first Sunday of the month and praise the Lord this is communion service so I brought my communion thanks for a scare I'm hitting the road and praise the Lord you know I was thinking about it yeah I mean there are so many things that I just line up with everything that is going on you know sometime in a week came from working stop by hearing and the brother called me actually brother here he called me and he was looking at something in the structure and a natural idea you know the very day that that Noah went into the Akeno birth Branham says he went in on the 10th of May and and there was a seven day period and the doors were shot on the seventh thing of me and he says you know and 7 a.m. in the morning you know the clouds start breaking forth in the range that are coming you know in and but the area was sharing there would mean insisting he says but one do you know that the 10th of May this year is on Sunday and the 17 of May this year is on the Sunday you know and I mean ash you know not trying to make anything up there but there are just a lot of things you know that is that is just speaking to us in different ways and I was thinking about it this is the first Sunday of the Monday actually should be our communion service and and the first communion service I was ever here the Passover was right in the time of a plague praise the Lord it was right in the time of a national player God was dealing with with Egypt you know honor the Ministry of Moses and and that was the way he assured his people you know out of Egypt you know was I was bad a convenient the beginning of months and and I mean in in all of those things you know but where my mind was going with with that you know I was thinking about it I was saying I was saying man we don't we don't know how long this thing is going to linger and if we don't we don't be careful you know they might rob us of some of our our you know our spiritual blessings and so I started thinking about it and and started checking you know and I said well I'll get online and see if I can find now you know this communion tray with a little cups number Johnny just just kind of for turn the light on in my head because I was finding all of those trade but once I was finding the Naha cops actually you can buy the disposable cops you know and after people use it and throw it away so I couldn't buy any SS all of these ones does not have cuffs talking about a tray with our cups and any my search and then I found this possible one you know that I can slip right in my bag and get on the road praise the Lord the scripture says they went from house to house breaking bread amen praise the Lord so we will not allow this Kover 19 or whatever area is to stop us from enjoying the blessing of God we are ready for this devil more than ever before amen he cannot stop us praise the Lord amen you know so but I was thinking you know if if the Lord break us out of this you know what are we going to stay in along what are we going to come out of faith is not going to change our love for God it's not going to change our service for God it's not going to change our devotion for God praise the Lord we will keep the Word of God in season and out of season and so you know but we would get you will get that entire tray set and as soon as the Lord can lift this curse from upon us that is the way we approach our our communion service you know for now you know because I mean I don't want I don't want any you know any doubt lingering around the service you know whatever people might be thinking you know the Lord has blessed us for many years we have did our communion from the same glass and and he has just been blessing you we have to remember the last communion service we wear from bourbon bourbon MCs the communion is divine healing you know and and divine healing must remain in the church you know the churches that have a stain from communion and all of their they are denying the people of experiencing divine healing because there is healing in the water there is healing in the wine the bread represent the body you know that was broken for us now so when we get back the Lord help us we'll get one of those tray that's how we would go with our convenient until he can be able to raise our faith again amen praise the Lord but until then you know as we go into this week this is Palm Sunday this coming Friday it is going to be Good Friday next Sunday is going to be Easter Sunday let's just keep this time before the Lord amen let's let's keep our hearts in praying for one another I mean less less let's go let's go - cavalrymen let's go down the streets of jerusalem this week let's go to Palace Josh main hall and see how Jesus - alone let's go in the night and see how Peter denied him praise the Lord it might not be Peter they might be you it might be mean because all the disciples deny him he was left alone so let's trouble with him this week let's keep it in our mind let's make that I mean that is the only religious even that we had only religious holiday we have is the Easter that is the thing of what our faith is all about that is what Christianity is all about is the resurrection of Jesus Christ so let's just keep it real this this week we might not be together but I mean we will be in in the last day that's what I'll talk about that a little bit you know over in Revelation chapter 1 verse 10 the Bible says and John was in a spirit in the last day and brother branham Torah it was it was a bit different from the days of the day of the law because the day of the Lord all through the scripture was pointing to the judgment of God but what John was was going through being transported in a spirit he was in the last day and I was looking at that last night how beautiful it is I really read something to you here from brother Branham but you see the bride God's people that are honored talking that is experiencing the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul is actually in the last day because he's dealing with us I mean he's speaking to us he's we are traveling with him why the word because a judgment that all through the scripture the Prophet spoke about God judgment as the day of the Lord so the word is is experiencing the dead of the Lord I mean the fullness of it I have not break upon the word yet but they are experiencing the dead of the Lord why the bride is caught up in the law state it means we are currently in a revelation of his world we are caught up in what he's doing in our life and and and where he's taking us to so and and those things have be real praise the Lord I believe that's a reason why God having us to go through this thing with the word he want him make himself more real to us than we have ever experienced him amen praise the Lord so we want to thank the Lord this morning and and just as I was saying you know I have my man anointing all year I have my convenient trade it was so beautiful so this thing and it's right Genesis do this in remembrance of me oh my goodness praise the Lord you know so just like I said I don't know how how long this is going to go but you know if the Lord blessed us and as we go along and any of you things you know praying and feeding your heart you want to have communion we will not do it every day in your house to you alone I mean once a month will be a bit okay but if you feel the need of faith you just let us know we were prayed in and then we we can come right to your house and self communion amen if you want to stay in the living room and keep me in the kitchen we'll come right to your house and have communion together [Laughter] praise the Lord Amen but I'm telling you we're ready for this devil a me praise the Lord Amen we are ready for this devil he's just taking us back to the book of Acts amen keeping us in our home to have service it's not new to the church we must not be an embarrassing man because that's what the Old Testament says they from house to house the wind breaking bread praise the Lord and I would just encourage you the law place on your heart this week you know just just building prayer you know if he placed on your heart to spend a time before him spend that time before him you know I pray for me and I'll be praying for you but you know let's let's make this Easter Special amen let's make this Easter special we we I mean we plan to have a Easter meeting in and we can still have an Easter meeting and then you can we can have an Easter meeting with the Lord it can be you and the Lord on your knees have an Easter meeting experience the power of the Resurrection I don't know if for some reason that is just the burden that is on my heart birds cat I mean making emphasis on the Holy Ghost has never struck my heart like the way I'm feeling about it praise the Lord I mean that's the ticket we have to get out of this he meant that is our assurance that we would get through this praise the Lord the Holy Ghost is the only thing that we need you see that's the reason why Wednesday night I was talking about all of this jewelry out there and people trying to talk about Vaseline what a vice in or Navesink that's what I'm gonna get into this morning God Holy Ghost is our inoculation he has already I give us our vast in fascination with his spirit and and and and I was just thinking about this the other day Isis oh my goodness this whole world I mean the minds of the people so scary I mean all the preachers are talking about it all I mean all the megachurch preachers they are talking about it and what they put in the mind of the people is this won't work government and everybody is going to be having a digital number and everybody is going to be having a special number you know and I'm going to bring this fascination and it will fasten you and and all of that look Paul the Apostle Paul when he received the Holy Ghost you think about it he had an experience of one of the more daily snake to bite him and brother branham said because he had a quick empowering him he has already received God's fascination that the other person of national could not kill him praise the Lord so you see when we have the Holy Ghost that's the reason why he gave us the promise we would drink the other things it will not harm us is not that we will look at it and drink it but if we are not conscious of it and we drink it because he he has possessed this body and he is dwelling in this body is not going to go any far praise the Lord so I mean the Holy Ghost is our only way out of this praise the Lord and this morning I want to speak on a message you know Jesus Christ described his age as children playing in the marketplace Berta Branham described our age as a little ball going through the grave yeah whistling aiming so that's what I want to speak about I was thinking about this all through the week then and then I started checking checking online and trying to look for the kind of an image I could use and then a low key later a good Christian and a Christian Avenger you know program for kids we had a little picture there show a little ball going through the graveyard whistling oh man I was here yesterday that I was just having the time with the Lord so I told bruh I sent it down to brother Andrews I see brother Andrews you copied this picture for me I want to use it tomorrow in church praise the Lord so that's what I'm going to be speaking about ever Jordan if you have it there just put it up for me oh man my goodness praise the Lord nearly has it has a little it has a little story for the case let me let me read a little bit on there you were having fun playing with your friends but you stay at his house longer than you playing now it's midnight and you must walk home in the dark you need to hurry too because your parent will wonder where you are locally your home is now far from your frame house but there is a shot card you can take but it's true the grave yeah as you walk through the spooky dyin gates of the cemetery and make your way by the many tombstones you start to feed neighbors you have taken this shock of many times during the day but things just feel different at night you wish you had a friend with you so to occupy your mind you start whistling why you quickly walk towards the other side about halfway across you see a shadow of a tree moving and the wane and you hear that the rustles of the love of it leaves is enough to get you running as fast as you can with great relief you finally leave the grave year behind and so on arrived home amen I'll stop right there so this morning I want to I want to speak on their praise the Lord amen but I started this actually Wednesday night that was what I started speaking on and talking about the Mac of the Beast I just nimi like that because my mind was was generally on all the theories that are out there I just wanted to draw our attention a little bit so before we go any further let's just read a word this morning for a tester learn in chapter 5 first just to learn in chapter 5 that's why we want to read and then I mean I'm so I'm so excited I'm so anxious for what I want to share this morning if I don't take time I won't say anything if I don't take my time I will enter saying nothing so I have to take my time praise the Lord first testimony chapter 5 Chapter five reading from verse one Paul says bought all the time and the seizing bread wings yeh have no need that I write unto you praise the Lord we must now be looking for something on the internet to tell us about time and season time and cz must be something we are experiencing in our body of what God is doing for yourself nope FLE that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for wendish I say peace and safety then suddenly destruction cometh that's the only scripture that could kind of a describe walking in the gravy away sling [Laughter] for when they shall say peace and safety then suddenly destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night none of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet hope of salvation for God hath met a one of us to wrath amen but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore comfort yourself amen together why are you in your home comfort yourself why are you going alone comfort yourself and edify one another even as also you do praise the Lord let's pray together father o God we approach your word this morning Almighty God Father we just ask your blessing our Lord the Apostle Paul speaking to us norine Father God the inspiration law of father that we will have been in such a condition Lord O God we are not the children of the night law to be troubled father God by all the news law or father in all the Deaf reports of God and all the horror that is taking place Lord father God we are children of the Damned we must be looking at the positive things that is happening Lord we must be looking no God or other daily blessings that you are sending us law on the hope of salvation of God in the resurrection that we hold dearly in our heart to go not just a mentor taught Lord God our experience by 1/2 that experience so father we pray bless your world oh god father this morning bless your people now Lord Jesus may you just all take us into your presence now or father Lord in heavenly places in Christ Jesus father bless us now and your wonderful name we pray amen amen Allah bless you you can have your sea praise of Lord amen but Pascal mentioned but one not being feeling well and we were able to talk to him in and have some fellowship with him as perscare see he's doing well and guess what I was with brother brother Brad yesterday and and we just and we just had it we just had a time amen I mean the Lord being kind of a with him in I mean in in his own way and I mean we were down in his garage his workplace he was you know helping me doing some work there and he was testifying to me and I mean social presence came in the garage and he's crying and I'm looking in his face I mean we can have Church and a word in every word Amen praise the Lord I mean we just we just had a good time yesterday I mean crying laughing and and just and just shouting shouting all over the place we were just like children playing in the mechanic all yesterday oh [Laughter] praise the Lord amen so I talked a little bit yeah but Brennan I mean for years speaking and saying they're the dead of the law coming as a thief in the night wish of course we know that birdbrain Chase is the date of judgment now let's see what were banished a year over in Patmos vision revelation chapter 110 he says actually what what happened was that John was caught up in the spirit now watched our work cut up is the same as raptured I mean is the same as being in heavenly places so John was caught up in the spirit and transported into the last day which is yet to come the Bible speaks of the day of the Lord which is to be in the future and John is now seeing the things of their future but in the meantime just to settle our minds amen he says it is it is just that at this time of the revelation of Jesus Christ John was taking up the same as caught up taking up the same word come up higher rapture is all the same word for alone John was taken up by the spirit and bourbon and made emphasis on that you know John was in the spirit on the last day that was word he was talking about being in a spirit of laude shirt and being in a spirit you know that's what he was talking because it is irani parallel if we don't if we don't take time we would think that is the same just like the date of the Lord I was looking at a lot of commentary last night and I was understanding why brother Branham was saying he says many things that I did of the Lord is Sunday you know because it's a complete different way that John expresses it nowhere in the scripture it is written that day that the lost day you will see all through the scripture the dead of the law the dead of the law the dead of the Lord is only in Revelation 1:10 that the Bible turn the world that way that the Lost Dane and brother Branham says many of the commutator wish of course when you look there some would say is is is is the last day the first day of the week because it used to be the Sabbath day but because of the resurrection the early church make it the first day of the week so many believed that it was the lost a brother Branham was trying to help us to realize that it's not a passive day like some day but it's an experience that goes with the believer because every day to the believer is the last day every day in the heart of the believer is the last day are we together so the believer experienced the last day while the war goes through the day of the Lord that is the difference are we together Amen man I I don't know what is happening but it's like there's an atmosphere in this building this morning amen John was taking about the spirit and transported by the spirit to that great day that is coming the lost ape is when the days of man is over when the work of flesh is over it's when we are now submitting ourself toward the Word of God submitting ourselves to the Spirit of God not being led by our own ideas and our own desire that's man's day he goes alone he says a little bit then the kingdom of this world will become the kingdoms of our God praise the Lord amen he says that's the lost day but the day of the Lord is when Josh man falls so the deal of the law speaks of judgment the last day speaks of our experience of God when we are lifted up above our fleshly desires when we are caught up into joy unspeakable for the glory when you just don't know what making you happy but you just happen oh you are in the Lord's Day it's not a date of flesh I mean when you I mean when when is you just thinking one hymns from another you just thinking I mean songs are just flowing through your mind it's just flowing through your heart you just feeling so happy that's the last day a me and after that comes the millennia so see what he says here the day of the Lord is when the judgment Falls that's for the world and then after there comes the millennium that is for the believer prays alone so that the dead of the Lord and the lost he goes I has to say he says right now the world does what I want to do with the Christians they call him all manner of evil names make fun of him but there-there is coming that Great and notable day when there we will in Hall for the lamb is coming in RAF to Josh the word that is when the Rogers will have their day with the Lord amen so the the Lord's Day is when the believer is having a beer with the Lord that the believer is having a time with the Lord the believer is spending time in God's presence walking by faith a man living in love amen praise the Lord this is when the righteous will have the idea with the Lord for the wicked shall burn and the righteous will walk over there atrás in the Millennium praise the Lord is just like right there in Egypt you know George man was falling and but the household of Israel was dead in Goshen with light you know I mean they were they were there singing the son of Moses they were dead I mean remembering the covenant of abraham and what george man is falling on the other side praise the Lord I mean and just like I said there was a time of the first communion it took place on a plague and they saw this convenient soon asked I mean this place should not stop us amen it should not stop us glory be to God amen so I'll just I just wanted to go go back to Dan and then I'll take a review back again from Wednesday night talking about the Mack of the beach let's read this code Brad Branham share the mark of the beast 1954 he said now you see what the mark of the beast is is the mark of apostasy if a person who think it's a person whom just think they're well I belong to church and I'm just as good as the next fellow he says I belong to this church and you realize were your church organization that you are depending on where it comes from do you realize the Bible said that he the Bible said he that worship the Beast receive his Mack or the letter of his name now watch in the forehead or hand there's knowledge in the forehead knowledge in hand deeds where balances that's what it is in the forehead or in the hint that's knowledge or deeds praise the Lord so receiving the mic in the forehead is knowledge that's the reason why I was pointing out on Wednesday night a mindset the scripture said trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on to your own understanding laying that on to your own mindset because the human mind said is just stop honest when a man said in his own mind said he just become stubborn in listening to anybody so brother Branham says the mag is in your forehead or your hand that is knowledge or d-dad don't he says that don't means you got a big tattoo on your face it don't have to be dead it's not taking of an outward is is is talking it's not talking of the outward is talking of spiritual praise the Lord now something happened Wednesday night I was confused a little bit you remember when I was talking and I referred our brother branham since you know these two Mac was played out in Genesis and I took Genesis chapter 3 and the seed of the woman I got that taught on my way to church and I wrote it down in the office and I referred to as Wednesday night but I was I was a little bit stuck in between our in my mind I was thinking what wow what am I talking about Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 the seed of the woman were in here does it shows out the mark of the beast but I will tell you something the Lord spoke to me yesterday and he helped me to understand why he laid that scripture on my heart praise the Lord let's look here a little bit here in Genesis chapter 4 let's look at King yet a little bit as we look at this map we're just doing a review from Wednesday night and then we were getting to our message this morning praise the Lord Amen you that a home I don't I don't have to to tell you they're sorry for taking your time because you already home praise the Lord Amen I would just I just have to sew adjectives that I hear with me in this morning to to be patient a little bit with me amen praise the Lord let's look at Genesis chapter 4 Genesis chapter 4 brings out word Cain and Abel went out you know to make it sacrifice before the Lord and the scripture says here reading from verse 6 that's where the law started speaking to King that's father now and the law said and the lost speaking to King that wroth and why is thy countenance falling if they'll do well shall their net be accepted now Berta Branham says actually God was telling King go and do as your brother ever did amen if you can go and do what your brother ever did would that now be accepted and if doubt does now well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and - and thou shalt rule over him and king talked with Abel and it came to pass when they were in the field now we see God has already instructed King to go and do the right thing but he had a mindset because he was angry he got stuck in that mindset instead of taking the correction of God he used our mindset and when is slay his brother because in his mind said what he did was right nobody should correct him so he goes he got stuck in their mind said I'm going to do it no matter what you say so he went and he killed his brother are we together verse 9 and the Lord said unto King where is a better brother now see the attitude now God came down and corrected him he refused he killed his brother God come down again trying to draw him into fellowship trying to draw him into reconciliation where is your brother am I my brother's keeper he just fly a while because he stuck into a mindset and his mind said there is that I was right from the beginning my my sacrifice you have been accepted praise the Lord verbatim says is knowledge or deeds now so verse 11 and now that occurs from the earth because he would not listen to God amen we have opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from the hang-its what his hands have done is his deeds his mindset is affecting his work praise the Lord is his deeds the earth has opened his mouth received a brother's blood from thy hand when they out till at the ground hashanah hands for the year on today cause strength a fugitive in vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and King said unto the Lord my punishment is great then I can bear that's not repentance that statement is not repentance law you know what I'm going through it's not repentance amen I can't take this anymore if that is not repentance the Bible says God is sorrow worketh repentance true repentance always come with the word I'm sorry and King said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear behold that has driven me out this day from the face of the earth I will together from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I behave and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall sleep me and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord said a mock a porn King lease and find that he should kill him praise the Lord now there Mac that's what we're Branham says it was not an outlaw Mac their mark was a spiritual Mac praise the Lord so we see right in this in this entire scripture that we have just read the map over and over the king was demonstrating was just a rejection of God's Word he refused God's correction now even when God was trying to draw him into a fellowship of reconciliation where is their brother he flame up God was about to help him he was angry to be helped he don't want to be helped and when he comes before God thinking that he's repenting trying to make himself sorrowful this thing is too hard for me to bear that is not repentance constant rejection of submitting ourselves to the Word of God now the scripture says just like I said I'm making a little review here let's let's look at a amen Solomon say in ecclesia such up to 9 amen verse 10 the mark on your hands according to revelation that will be on the hands praise the Lord well increased as a chapter 9 verse 10 Solomon says here whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with the might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether I go with but look at the phrase whatsoever your hand father to do if the mark in the hand is deed then whatsoever your hand funny to do now compare that scripture with sin Luke chapter 9 verse 62 Luke chapter 9 verse 62 Jesus over in luke 9:62 and Jesus said unto him no man after putting his hand toward the plough and look back whatever your hands find it to do I mean the mark in the hand is all about our deeds where are we putting our strength whatever your hand find it to do Solomon save do it with all your mind and Jesus he has said whosoever no man after having put his hand to the plough and look back it's fit for the kingdom of God are we together [Music] Wednesday night we look at Jeremiah chapter three that talks about the forehead of a wall and Ezekiel chapter three that speaks about the forehead that God was going to give Ezekiel to a rebellious people it's not that Ezekiel face was going to change but God was going to give him a steadfast spirit that no matter how the people frown at him no matter how they criticized him he would just be steady he would stay with the word of God and in Jeremiah chapter three God was rebuking Israel and said you have a forehead like a wall and the forehead of the wall is that she has no shame she has no shame she's not embarrassed of what she's doing she can dress anyhow it does not him but it does not bother her it's not a max it's a spirit that possessed her that makes her to dress like that and go like that and it would be a spirit the spirit of the law will possess Ezekiel and he will have the forehead like God says to be able to withstand that rebellious nation you know so like like brother Branham says here you know it's a mark on the forehead or the hand and there's knowledge or deed he said that does that that don't mean you got a big tattoo on your face amen and then in this church down there I don't know where it is and all of these people taking a tattoo of 666 on their face and and and they want to call themselves you know the the the Church of Satan or whatever they want to do you know they are just kind of for manifesting an outward manifestation of a spirit has already possessed him praise the Lord now what Ava a seed of God on a deception has gone honor their spirit and God goes and reach there and deliver that person with the tattoo on on on their body it will still be on their body but if God saved him if they repeat that tattoo on their flesh is now going to stop them from receiving the Holy Ghost I mean we have many brothers that I mean that they had tattoo on their body before they even got safe so it's just not it's a spirit that possessed the individual and mindset there no matter how you present truth to them they cannot walk in truth they will always give a reason why they have to step out and do something different all these telling evangelizing and they are talking to their people there's a digital number and they're having the people there that I mean living wrong according to the scripture then dressing wrong they will not address those things by the scripture and they keep pushing the promise I had with all of these things that is happening I mean the world will get a digital number and they are going to do a fascination and they're going to vas in you and you'll get the mark of the beast and all of that all of those things are just lying spirit continuing to deceive the people and keep them in a mindset to disobey God's Word because what would they be looking for they will be looking for a Medical Center I want to give them vaccinations or they will be looking for a system to come when it's happening right now right out of their nose praise the Lord and mind said having two other Scripture year over in Genesis let's look at that a little bit and speaks here of Jacob year dealing with his father-in-law amen Genesis chapter 31 now before we read this trip to look at the story here now brother Branham says Jacob was more interested in the birthright amen he was more interested in the birthright he was taught by his mother he got the birthright even though he was he he had all of these things that was happening in his life as a plane the lying and cheating and all of that but he had this preference he brought himself honor a token message with all the struggle he had and because he identified himself with the birthright God was obligated to meet him along his way and God met him and told him I will bring you back to this place where he had a vision of angels ascending and descending I will bring you back to this place chapter teller 1 verse 29 it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the God of your father's speak on to me yesterday yes tonight saying take thou he that thou speak net to Jacob need a good or bad the mark in the hands your days he said it is in the power of my hands it's in the power of my hands to hurt you but he says the God of your father spoke to me last night now you see there over in Revelation chapter 7 the Bible says and the Lord told insisted hurt hurt not them that had the seed of God don't hurt him so the seed of God it preserved us just like we said Wednesday night is a security it keep us and what we need is that blessed assurance that we know that we have been kept amen we have all of these people he developed in a secret place of the Most High and the RER of these signs of David I mean the the the the the burn or the brain instance they do all of these things it's all working in their mind but the heart desire they can wait for this thing to be over to get back to the nightclub they can't wait for these things to be over to run back into the street but now with all of this happening they are wearing they are religious guy meaning and and carrying themselves on hunger strike they call it fasting and all of these things but their inner desire the warmth is to be over so they can get back in the street and start their adulterous ways Genesis chapter 39 verse 3 this is Joseph verse three and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the law may all that he did to prosper in his hand that's his DS all he did to prosper in his hands so Joseph was wearing a Mac of the Sun of prosperity they knew that wherever he lays his on it will prosper he never had a written on his back or written on his forehead they just knew what if I knew that I can trust this man whenever he put his hands to do prosper because he doing right he do it with dedication praise the Lord when are we putting our hands to do amen it's not an out what Mike is a spiritual man mark of the beast' 1961 brother Branham says the fear of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen he said the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I break this code like this so we can be able to see it the mark of the beast is to reject it to reject one to reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost to just go to church and be religious and never get to the place where God has a complete control of your life where we cannot submit to God enough we submit to God and we get tired and we get back from there we get back to ourselves get back to our own minds praise the Lord the seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the mark of the beast is to reject it and he said receive ye the Holy Ghost and that's what I'm saying this morning receive ye the Holy Ghost praise the Lord young people receive ye the Holy Ghost we cannot go on the experience of our parents you cannot carry your child on your experience you might expose them to that experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost work they are submitting himself to to the Word of God it's not honor I 7 but it's a desire in their heart to submit himself to the world that is our escape from this plague is the Holy Ghost that is the thing that was that will make us to survive whatever may come whatever may come that'll be whatever it is I'm talking to a brother yesterday from France a good friend of mine I mean lovely brother he's he I mean he used to be my pastor and I mean we were just good friends and we were fellowship in you know and he was talking about you know III mean this this another to reality and I told him I said slow we can't doubt these things there's a fudgy you know the file genius that is out there into the world and in and it's a radiation from the 5g that is affecting us I told him I said to me I said bro watch this if that is what is happening that thing has been launched ever since it's in the atmosphere we've been breathing it so if we find out today is not today that we're going to higher honor our bed because there's a foggy out there if it is there is there but the Holy Ghost in the believer will see us he will help us we have a promise we have a promise the Holy Spirit sifted the air that we breathe praise the Lord he's freeing the water that we drink when we bless our food he bless him for it to be a blessing to our body so no matter what is happening out there our only escape from it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need to go back to the altar and receive the Holy Ghost and I believe this morning you can receive it right in your room you can receive it right where you are if we just open our heart and submit it to the word church membership is not the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I mean what are you married in the message of Mary out of the message it's not a holy goal we must have a personal experience we must have a personal experience I mean the devil will bring all of those things to our mind and try to turn our spear and go into inna or your heart what is your heart desire in are you submitting to God's Word whatever he did prosper in his hands Joseph had a mock praise the Lord now let me let me let me share with you what the Lord kind of a dare with me yesterday Genesis chapter 3 I read his Scripture and even when I was driving home on Wednesday now I was asking myself in the car Isis I wonder why I read that scripture I really did not draw out what I thought was there oh but God never failed me God never feel praise the Lord he never feel amen praise the Lord Genesis chapter 3 amen he said I would put an amateur between D and the woman and between the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise the head and thou shalt bruise his heel now this is where I was sitting yesterday I mean I was just I said oh God I mean and I mean and the Lord just beautifully open a word to me we know that the woman by nature does not produce a seed she has to receive it amen so the seed of the word does not combi our natural birth we have to receive it just like Jesus said receive ye the Holy Ghost married Navajo desire to be the bring for the virgin birth she received it from the angel bee to mean I'm calling to your word so the promise of the warmest seed is a promise of the Holy Ghost she received a C and there is a man that changes her when a woman receive a seed is a mark that changes her let's see what the scripture says Paul Galatians chapter 6 Paul in Galatians chapter 6 oh this never came so beautiful to me yesterday sitting down I said all God have mercy praise the Lord the seed of the woman a type of the church a type of the bride she received God's instruction we cannot manufacture it we cannot produce it but we bring our bother in obedience to what His Word says amen for in Galatians chapter 6 verse 17 he says from henceforth let no man trouble me for a beard in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus are bared in my body I'm conceived with the word what is happening to me is not an outward expression is something I'm bearing in my body he received the word just like a woman received the seed when God said the seed of the woman is now what she will produce is what she will receive from God by obedience and that's the same thing with the church for refer to death in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 15 he said in childbearing she shall be saved in childbearing she shall be saved that goes back to Genesis chapter 3 there is no salvation in just having and not what try what is the parallel date receiving the word when she received the Word of God to be able to bring for the life of Christ and childbearing she shall be safe 1st Peter chapter 1 verse 23 first Peter chapter 1 verse 23 Peter says it here amen that we are born of the seed incorruptible being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and Abbar forever that's the seed of the woman the Word of God is the seed of the woman in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and everything would bring full of his kind and that's the Mack of God that is the seal of the Holy Ghost when a person is born again by the word now born by a church identification but born again by the Word of God the seed incorruptible that is the see that we are possessed we are pregnant with that incorruptible seed it's a seed that brings us in subjection to God's words he will have the rule over you if his seed having rule over the church is a seed having rule over the bride we are submitting our set to the word that's the seed of God God gave a promise where he filled his church in when we received our seed there is nothing that comes from out war that can affect us because this is see incorruptible in his body even death itself Paul said death where is your sting Deborah self can I to us because I see incorruptible is in this body oh my praise the Lord and you know better brain I'm talking about this boy walking through the graveyard there is there is few things that he said that kind of a describe what is happening question and answer 1962 he said we realized Lord something is fixing to happy the world knows it they are singing songs the people dying in Liberia and the president going make a of coronavirus music now even thinking about the medical condition they are singing songs and a television a bursting forth will new Retta called jokes now that was brother branham day television but now it's the social media that is bringing out all sorts of jokes about this coronavirus and what are they doing they are just doing it to ease the pressure from the people to distract them from the fear and the horror that is on the world jokes and sounds what are you doing like a little boy whistling in the dark passing by the grave you scared to death trying to smooth his nails by whistling he's only fooling himself so this nation only laughing joking just just as I said that at the time who come when they would do that return from truth to Phoebus there when I look at the truth in God's Word but it will believe all the lies from the internet or do you know what it said again they say the corner virus is this thing that can hear you oh you know what Elijah said again the corner bar say this thing I can hear you and sometimes even believers we just so sweep another thing all of these social media things comes well you can stop them from coming you don't have to be in it and just publish slash slash to people when you don't even go to verify whether this information is true you just send it to all your contact you have become a preacher of lies you are honor the last days spirit praise the Lord one brother text missus why I sent you a lot of messages you don't reply praise the Lord I said so he might says well I just see you copying things and sending it to me it's not a message from you it's not a message you now address him in to say brother 1 how are you somebody sends something to you and you just sending it to me for me to read it I read it and that's all oh my goodness the thing about it there is the error is there's there's nothing wrong for us to laugh if he's a joke and I mean it's something for us to to cheer about but not to be caught up in the spirit of it not to be caught up in a spirit of it what we're looking for well I mean what is the latest joke they has put up I mean what is floating on the internet everybody is laughing about and how that in the last day there who comes coffers and laughters and how these things will be at the end time heidi hired minded and mindset i minded having a form of godliness turning away from the truth and we see it right now oh god wake up people let them realize that they can be that they can be a sure right now that they have passed from death unto life that's what we need having that assurance in our heart will not be worrying about what other is advancing or there is not a passing if that assurance it is in our heart that we have passed from death unto life come what may come with me oh there's never a time where we need to put importance on the holy ghost it's not just a mental conception is not a church identification it's an experience is alive it live in us it live in us it flows through our being it goes through every fiber of our body who sing the song flow through me holy spirit flowed through me it's not just a music it's a reality it's a reality the scripture talks about and a man i was dead and the people are embattled and here running and it took this demon and threw him into the grave of elijah where Benham says the quickening power what that meant back up today to life working from there back to life then what were the Holy Ghost do in our body what would the Holy Ghost do in our body what will happen when the ones that we love in and once we care for a sick in such a time with all the fear that is out there it will have a one that is having a cop are you just going to plug your my or maybe this car in the back I mean you got to stay away from it's your loved one this is the one that you embrace you love you have a commission you will lay your hands on the sake it's not only for the pastor it's for the housewife it's for the hospital's for the mother is for the father you will lay hands on the sick and the sick will recover we have a promise let's put more value in the promise that we have let's take Jesus word then what the Health Ministry is saying praise the Lord I mean you look you look at you look at some of the news report the president comes our waiver with his with the health minister in the doctors he have around him you just think about it just like the time of Egypt Pharaoh comes out with all his Weisman what can we do about this if you will ever get to their hearts and says let the church get on their knees and prayed if they ever think about that and speak it right from the White House and say let the church let the people of God get on your knees and pray the journalists who ask and the doctor they're happening well we don't know I mean I mean this is the best we know this this could last for long and in this school and the people and all stuck in or it could last for long we need to fill our house with this we need to fill that the same will last for long at the people that are called by my name will humble himself will humble themselves let's start listening to God's news let's turn God's news on and listen to God's news if the people that are called by my name will humble himself if we will start just may be skipping bread fashion and and I said walking huh I take my bread fast I was skipped lunch and just and just and just use that time to pray lord I give my lunch to you for somebody that does not have meal I'm going to stick my face to the ground and caught up on your name and the people that I called by my name will humble himself Oh God with the people let them realize that a day that there can be a show right now that they are passed from death unto life when we receive Christ the Holy Spirit we just rise above the word then we know we are already raising with him and we are just waiting for that change where death we seized in the muttering not in motoring where death with ease in the motoring there ceases in the motor room of the believer when he's possessed of the Holy Ghost for death for for him is just a step over the river but in his body deficits are we together just waiting for that change where Deborah sees in a motoring these little Williams of motor life that's attorney in our senses will be redeemed bridgeberg Brenham said he says like some of these comedians going down and telling these jokes and carrying on and women carrying on a way to do and men together it just reminds me of a little boy going through a gravy i whistling trying to make himself believe he's not scared the people are scared to death a man they were just such a fear I mean that is that is what we would deal with when all of this is over it will not be the plague again will just be the fear that is on the mind of the people people can even trust their own hands they can trust their own hands they wear gloves to eat if you're left with them they would stay six feet from their hands oh my goodness me praise the Lord they can't trust their own hands these hands that I serve you from the day you were small now coronavirus you can't trust your own hands oh yeah we must wash our hands we must take all the precaution but let them not just fill this thing in in our mind well you see that a piece of chicken in a bowl to eat although I shouldn't touch over my hands my goodness unless you have now wash your hands go and wash it but if you wash your hands don't feel bad to eat and lick your finger say man it's a good old habit hey my goodness that's why you know that the food has gone down you know that is good when you start licking those fingers praise the Lord oh man go have mercy it's fear that is plaguing the people mind but I'm telling you that's why you bless your food that's why you Centrify your food and clean here's when I keep you safe getting all the right vegetable when I keep you safe that's why you commit that fool you blessed with faith and Thanksgiving let's take Jesus word to be real he was not saying those think Joe Keene those things that are written in the scripture were not just put there for them to be there just to make us different from the world it's just a religious practice our Lord Jesus blesses food loss and value our is that just a religious practice it's that's a reality in it trying to make himself believe his nasca sure he's scared seed he's not fooling nobody that's why he's whistling that's why they are joking and he are laughing and yet they are looking over their shoulder praise the Lord if their own shadow approached them that did you oh I thought somebody was behind me it's just your shadow see he's trying to say he's not scared but he is that's what the matter today but all what a blessing hope for the believer that's lifting of his hands amen what a blessing hope we hold in our body it don't make us to be proud brother Branham says the evidence of the Holy Ghost will make you to cry for what is happening in the lame you were crying before you go to bed you were crying that love that that children I loosened me up their parenting and in parents are losing their children it will break your heart that is the evidence of the whole ego that is that is the mercy of God it will not make you proud and you just laugh and that's how arrogant the religious I paved myself with the blood of Jesus the scripture say well ten thousand were father on my right hand ten thousand before it will never come not us well let me tell you it might not come nigh to you but when you can't get food to eat you were good night it if you can find where to bar you will walk in the streets you ago you were good night and when I come now you talking with brother Moses yesterday he told me this he told me the story and we were just talking about this very thing this very very conversation and I told us as I said brought I said brother we I mean I mean if he ever gets badder than what it is it will affect us because we will have to go and look for food he told me see you separate one while you say in his truth he says in there in Liberia during the water he says he says I know what hunger is I was so hungry until I got right into the shooting I was going to look for food because I just felt I was going to die he says all the gun noise the shooting was not even the one I was sounding to me because I was looking for food say when I get stuff I dropped my head when he sees he says when I got food and I came back then I asked myself was it really made I went out sometimes we don't know what we inviting ourself inviting on ourself it's time for us to seek the mercy of God amen you don't have to be happy in Minneapolis but we can say lord have mercy like David prayed have mercy Lord and take this plaque away live it from the city of New York live it from the people of Italy or a blessed hope for the believers that's lifting of hands for redemption is drawing nigh when we see these things appearing it's a great time for the believer amen it's a great time now for the believers to be proud it's a great time for the believers to be humble for the believers to keep his face between his knees on his knees seeking the face of God oh my praise the Lord I realized I've kept you a little bit long our radius one United on a one head brother Branham shed a little bit of a long coat but I kept it to read it to close the service of faith the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost received the mark of the beast I read that again the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost if John received the Holy Ghost in his mother warm we can pray our babies to have the Holy Ghost we can pray our little ones to have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you know I was I was thinking about this in and and just and just reading Barbra I'm talking about you know the gorge may fall in there in India and he never touched those animals do you know that it's even said that this play can not affect an animal this coronavirus can not affect an animal I was just looking at that look in there Appa and then I listened to someone a nurse saying they're giving a report that people are house pet should not worry it does not affect an animal and it's always like that when it's the son of Osmond the Bible plainly says they're all there was not sealed with the
