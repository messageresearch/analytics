uh my wife always said Lauren's name the baby after me because his wife my sister would not stay away from her house so you rather have the baby bearing my name so he can be home and then she can stay home instead of being to my house all the time so praise the Lord praise the Lord let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord I taught about this Lord studying yesterday the privileged law father to hold this little baby in my hands Lord before this congregation father we've been talking about the prophecy that lies in the scripture how the F was Barren have the women through the scripture that you give the promise Lord Sarah Rebecca Richard all of them came true baroness father you design it that way because Lord you wanted to bring a sea of faith you want to bring a seed of life and oh God to to be speaking on there and and uh [Music] encouraging the church Lord for us to pay attention to the purpose of redemption the reason why we were safe the reason why you have dealt with our life oh God the reason why we failed a period of barrenness is because they said there's an appointed time for you to bring for life and yet God we are holding a little baby a little life that you have given to the Kamara family Lord God is a child that is born into their home and we want we are dedicating him this morning and that you will bless the family Lord but also oh God as a pastor of this church I hold this child as a life to this church I hold this child father God and especially Lord dealing with this subject that father or we would we will we will begin to break for the Lord and bring full life and bring for the Life of Christ o God and get away from the things of the word of God father get into business with Christ Lord and seeing the Rapture at his hand of God see in the days that we are living in or we will become a better Witnesses for you oh god father as we hold this child Lord God father May each and every one of us Lord just hold our personal relationship with you may you just become a person sin become a father a life in our hands Lord oh God not just an identification with a church but father a life for God that we can know our say Lord father I know what I was and I know what I am today oh God we just thank you Father we want to pray that Lord you will bless this little baby bless little bloody Lord God father and we pray that Lord God he will grow in the field of the Lord bless the Camaros also Father keep him in good health Lord father God and uh bless the mother o God and strengthen her father Lord Jesus we just love you father the rest of the children oh god father treasured and uh little Divine dear to Father God Lizzy Lord Jesus the rest of the boys back home uh Josephine father we just pray that you bless them all we love you we thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray this morning amen amen praise the Lord congratulations thank you amen thank you for bringing me forth [Applause] praise the Lord amen amen praise the Lord we want to thank the Lord this morning we will go right into the word we we have gone pretty much uh into our time but just like I said I've rehearse over what we we spoke on last week I'm continuing from our subject give me children Lisa died that was a richer try to to Jacob gave me children least I died and this morning uh take that as part two but sing o-barring sing Old Baron that's that's what I want to come from this morning think all Baron praise the Lord when we spoke last Sunday we we read from another translation where the scripture says the f was Barren Genesis uh chapter 1 verse 2 the F was Barren but yet out of that Barren Earth God was able to bring a Garden of Eden praise the Lord out of the barren Earth God was able to bring out the Garden of Eden so we see here there is a principle there is a principle that we see and we want to deal with a little bit that uh there is pain in birth and there is gain in death there is pain in birth Genesis chapter 3 we know that it was a it was a promise that was given to the woman you know it was a promise that was given to the woman in pain she would be able to bring forth now you see uh uh as as as as Christians and and Bible students we we are learning to be able to see that the Old Testament was a shadow praise the Lord so there are a lot of things that God did in the Old Testament he laid some principle rules down in the Old Testament to be able to uh uh uh help us in in a sense of expressing what was in his mind so we see here that there is pain in birth and there is gain in death like job says uh birth is a few days that is full of trouble but also in the scripture we realize that death is an eternal Victory to the believer praise the Lord amen but it is because of our fallen nature we term to celebrate our birth then our death praise the Lord we turn to celebrate our our birth then our death but it's in death that we have victory praise the Lord when when we at Birth is is in pains is is is is full of trouble and uh just like you look at the the the you know the nature you know it take a dark cloud and and rolling turned out to bring forth rain you know the rain will only comfort when the cloud gather the tunnels roll then it gives birth to rain the Lady of the Valley has to go through the mall to be able to get her best perfume the rose of Sharon has to be crushed to be able to ease pains so we look at all of these things and we realize the other uh the god of life lays them as a lord as a principle uh you know that he lays in the in the law of nature he lays them in the Lord of nature so last week when we spoke on this we saw how God called Abraham to to start a coveting with him promised him that he will be the father of many nations but yet God had to carry him through a period of barrenness he had to go through a period of baroness and uh and in and in the midst of that there's there's a beautiful thing that uh that came out of it we saw that uh Sarah uh uh she brought Higa into this promise now you have to remember Hagar was an Egyptian girl she was a gentile woman she brought her into the promise richer wanting crying out to Jacob for children she had to bring bilha which was a Philistine girl also into the promise now so what was all of these things in the scripture in as much as they they they look at ugly picture and a very ugly picture you know with with uh with Ishmael being born in and and they have they have you know uh contributed to the the Arab race or not mostly Arab because the Arabs are from the sons of Keturah now actually uh from from here but uh you see the other there is there is a beautiful picture here as as we will as we will see and we will go we will go go ahead and look at this let's turn to galatian chapter four foreign being the prophet to the Gentile he's going to take this prophecy that we are dealing with this morning and he's going to address it in a complete different way that that will give us a picture there the when the Apostle Paul looks into God's mind he saw something completely different than just the the physical manifestation all the physical people that were playing out in uh in in the lifetime of Abraham praise the Lord amen so we over in uh in galatian chapter four let's read from verse one maybe and then we will drop down a little bit here now I say that the hears as long as he is a child uh uh different nothing from a seven door he be Lord of all but it's on the tutor and Governor until the time appointed of the father praise the Lord so this child owns everything all the Heaven and Earth can provide he owns it as a child of God he owns everything but yet the father will not give him everything the father is going to put him on the tutor and a governor until an appointed time so you see there are a lot of things in the Old Testament that's the reason why it's a shadow okay now you you look at uh Abraham and Sarah Barron State and all of these virus state is the father that is putting a sense of teachership something we can learn from because that's what tutor is for is is for us to learn praise the Lord and until an appointed time then the father will bring the child let's read verse three even so we when we were children were in bondage under the element of the word praise the Lord amen so he's dealing he's dealing with uh uh our natural birth and our new birth is also dealing with how the law has kept them on a bondage and then when Grace came it brought some sense of maturity because we can now see what was in the heart of the father are we together amen it was God's way of expressing his thoughts he was not really giving us laws to to to keep us on a bondage but he was he was in a sense expressing his internal thoughts of what he's going to do in the future now so let's continue to read even so we when we were children were in bondage honor the elements of the word but when the fullness of the time was come now this fullness of time he's talking about the fullness of time which is the Gentile time he's he's applying that also to our fullness of time you know I was talking to a friend and uh uh uh and and I was you know kind of for encouraging him and and I told him I said Paul says something he said there are so many sins that go before them and there are so many things that come after them amen praise the Lord I say uh uh uh it's it's easy to just to to see that and and and hold to that as a scripture but it's a principle it's not only sin amen their songs men's blessings that comes behind them there are some men blessings that go ahead of them praise the Lord some man's gift come as us as they go along their gift came after them some other gifts wait for them at the end praise the Lord some people were fruitful they are their fruitfulness came after them of the things that they were doing some people became fruitful uh uh in in the ministry in the things of Christ it went ahead of them so it's a principle it's a law that is written out there and God himself wrote that Lord praise the Lord amen so that's what we're seeing here so Paul is saying but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law now so you see what he's doing he's he's trying to show how the law was holding some things until this fullness of time so Jesus never came by passing the Lord he came exactly out of the Lord the Lord and the prophets were until John Then There came forth our Lord Jesus Christ are we together but when the fullness of time has come God sent his son made of a woman made honor the Lord to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive their adoptions of sons praise the Lord this adoption of songs is not God going to take us from a different family and bring us to his family no this adoption of son is that he used the law as a tutor to train us that when this fullness of time has come we can look back to the law and know what he wants us to do now praise the Lord that's the reason why our mistakes in life supposed to be stepping stones for us praise the Lord where we are now a things that we have done in the past are repeating they must they are things that we must be able to use and say Lord I did this and and this is what I got out of it and I can't do it again praise the Lord so the law was a tutor the law was a shadow the law was to govern us in our childhood that when this fullness of time has come the father he he uh uh he watched us he uh you know watch our lives and and and our Behavior or under the law that when this fullness of time has come because we have proved ourselves as obedience children now he can call us out as adopted Sons praise the lord we can be manifested Sons and Daughters of God for our age praise the Lord are we together amen and because because ye are Sons because you are a child of God God has sent forth his Spirit of his son into your heart giving you a constant desire to cry back to God praise the Lord the thing that makes you that gives you a constant desire to cry back to God amen is the seed of your sonship because you were a child praise the Lord like Solomon says he says foolishness it's in the child foolishness is in childhood amen so we do foolish things we make foolish choices glory be to God but you see the sea of our sonship the sea that we are sounds and Daughters of God is that thing that God placed in US that we can cry back to him oh God oh God help me Lord oh God are we together and because he our sons God has sent forth his spirit the spirit of his sons into your heart crying out by father wherefore there are no more servants by a son and if a son then and hears of God through Christ amen how I be here when you knew that God you did safe unto them Wish by Nature I know Gods okay he he already there with that thing of a sonship Let's Travel a little bit and and get down over to uh uh Let's Travel a little bit and get down to verse 19. Paul's saying yeah my children of whom are travel in birth again until Christ be found in you I desire to present uh to be present with you now and to uh change my voice for I stand in doubt of you okay let's go down to verse 22 that's what I want to get to now we're going to get into this picture so pay attention here for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one of the bounded and the Order of the free woman which was Sarah praise the Lord now but you also think about this now think about this Abraham never choose Hager Sarah gave hega to Abraham and says yes my seven bring four child praise the Lord Jacob never choose bihad Rachel said yes my seven give me children oh my God oh my goodness praise the Lord amen Hallelujah hmm but he who was off the bound woman was born of the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise praise the Lord so wish me God kept Sarah that way because of his promise he wanted for all the human strength to be gone he wanted for no flesh to take glory in the coming of the promised son and no flesh would take Glory in the coming of the promised son praise the Lord he wanted all the human effort to be exhausted now so Paul yeah as a prophet to the Gentiles he's taking what we saw in the natural he's now bringing it to be able to apply to us spiritually because if you don't see it that way you'll never be able to understand what God was doing it will confuse you why would God say you'll be the father of nation and then he kept them Barren for all of their lives why why did God did that oh because he has something better in his mind praise the Lord he has something better that your youthfulness can provide amen are we together which states for saying yeah and our Glory for these are two Covenant he's taking the two sons and now making us to see that God was laying out two Covenant one Covenant that he would deal with our flesh that can never be redeemed that can never be said that will always make mistake and there is another Covenant where he would be with that see promise in your soul that he will never fail when you say Jesus never fell it's not for your fleshly need Jesus never failed for your soul need praise the Lord amen which things are in our glory for for these are too Covenant one from Mountain we shall grammar told that the the bondage which is a hega for this Eiger of Mount Sana in Arabia and answer it to Jerusalem which noun is and and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all praise the Lord amen then now he's going to take Isaiah prophecy and apply it to this very saying that we are reading he says for illustrating Rejoice thou barring the beareth net Break Forth and cry for thou thou that traveled net for the desolate have many more children than she which have an husband praise the Lord amen now he's taking ours are your prophecy and he's bringing it and applying it yeah to these two confidence being a prophet he's going right into the mind of God trying to to help us to see what God was thinking in his mind I don't know whether that that blew your mind uh uh uh last week but it really did it really speeding my head around my shoulders to realize that all of these Patriot wife came out barren but when it came to Joseph that was perfection his wife was not buried when it came to Moses the prophet of the Exeter his wife was not buried I'll tell you that God is more interested in your spiritual life in your soul than what your flesh can produce praise the Lord amen and also you look at a year you're seeing also that uh Sarah is bringing and he eats European woman into the promise when when over and over Abraham has told her that God says we will have a child he never said bring me somebody he said we will have a child but yes Sarah is going to bring this Ethiopian gear into the promise a type of how the Gentiles will be grafted in praise the Lord and Rachel is going to take Jacob by the belt that ever since I I thought about this that's the picture that keep coming to my mind I was looking all all the uh through the week and trying to find a beautiful picture that we designed that no no none of them I wanted a picture that I just hired Jacob by the belt give me children at least I died amen praise the Lord but yeah she will take this Philistine girl be your heart that was her seventh and also bring her into the promise now you tell me what intelligence was behind your mind how were Sarah thinks that uh uh uh Hey God will have a child and we'll carry that child for nine months and then she would turn the child over praise the Lord so you see the inspiration the power that was behind their decision was stronger than them because the very Sarah that says I take Hagar she said put her out she said pull out she cannot disrespect me in my own home so you see they were honor and influence that they don't have control over when he said when she said put her out God told Abraham you better do it boy you better do it if you want to stay in this house amen so you see that old people if you if we would just realize that the thoughts that is influencing our life is stronger is stronger than your education is stronger than your desire is stronger than your natural birth is stronger than your strength there is an intelligence that has been governing your life from the day you were brought forth there's a thought that has been watching over you if you think you can get away from it at the appointed time that's what everybody has then appointed that was a great intelligence oh and Abraham just imagine the conversation all through the night Abraham I mean we have waited well why if why if I mean she's here she's my girl she's my daughter if she has a child it would be my child praise the Lord Abraham said no God said you was going to have that now I'm old I'm old forget about this I've heard this thing for 25 years see the kind of a strong thoughts Divine thoughts that can be behind our forces praise the Lord when we are fussing and having the argument and and I don't care what everybody say I'm going to do it that's my life I'm going to live whatever I want to live you are struggling with an internal thought yes praise the Lord they made the reason why you you are expressing yourself and yelling is because there is something more that you are struggling with than the people that are before you sometimes you think it's your parents nobody can tell me nothing but there is something more if you were just common it would be a pleasant conversation when you start becoming emotional and start shaking and everything which means something that is driven into your blood vessel something that is in your nerves you're beginning to struggle with that thing you are struggling with a Divine thought praise the Lord he's just saying okay he's making a decision to get to the junction that I need him to be okay he say he's stubborn okay that just what I want you to do boy I'm going to lay you down on your back praise the Lord oh if we would just realize that it would be so easy to surrender to God it will be so easy if we just realize that that we're not making thoughts and making decisions for ourselves that's a great intelligence that is influencing us that's the reason why we learned to go back to him Lord is it your will they say you're well please help me praise the Lord and sometimes when we make choices and we fail we don't throw the ball down we don't cut ourselves out say Lord forgive me I realized I feel this because there is a great intelligence that has been behind your life from the day you were brought forth are we together let me finish reading this thing so I can get into my message written rejoice thou Barren that beareth met break for cry that a triviality net for the desolate have many more children than she wish have a husband praise the Lord in Paul says here now we brethrens as Isaac was we are children of the promise we are children of the promise not only children by our parents that was the medium we came but we are children that A promise is hanging over A promise is hanging over your life praise the Lord what is that promise God a promise that he will have a son in every age he will have a son he will have a daughter he will have a vessel he will have a young man or a young woman that he will use as a witness yes children or promise that is hanging over your life this morning praise Lord God is more interested in bringing his word to pass in every age getting a people to bring his word to pass because heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away amen his word will never pass away but now Brethren's we as Isaac are children of the promise but us then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now what what is he dealing with he's dealing with law and Grace he's dealing with this flesh struggling with the spirit struggling wave the soul desire that's why we have constant war that goes through our body because there is one that is born of the flesh that is the bound man and uh uh of the bound woman and there is one that is born of the free woman nevertheless was saved the scripture cast out the bound woman and her son for the son of the bound woman shall net behaved with the son of the free okay so we see there they're trying to bring you in a mind of of this of this great prophecy very great prophecy great man uh through all the ages has been has been inspired by this let's let's just take spoken word is the original CEO and uh uh let's let's read a little bit here study together now glory be to God are we together we're having some let me just stay with what I'm doing here now the power of the believing Church think about it the power that we have Christ have all power in Heaven and Earth you believe that now what if he's in you then all power in Heaven and Earth is also in you that's the power of the believing church amen has Christ got all the power sure Matthew 28 18 says that he is the the c word in the bride he is a c word do you see how we've been robbed that c word lying in your sword Dharma and the devil is is telling you that I mean you you don't have no power he blasts your mind he frustrates us and yet we're having the c word lying in our sword oh that's the reason why when the weakest Christians get on their knees amen whatever he can do to keep us away from the ground of praying whatever he can do to keep us away from the word and keep us away from the promises you want us to see everything that is in the Bible that condemn us but he don't want to see what has been promised to you praise the Lord he will rather you put giving out to another age and give it out to another person but for you it's just only chaos and frustration praise the Lord because he knows that when you see the Promise God see a word that is lying in your soul will connect and we identify that this is the promise that belonged to me he is the c word in the body and he in us become the c word in US all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was was poured into the church that's the power we don't have no power on our own amen we can make our own power but to relied on all that Christ was he poured into the church Hallelujah now watch remember God lord of reproduction after it's kind everything will bring forth after a kind so if the c word is in you there is nothing less can come out of your life nothing less if God see word is in you then the promise of this age is the only thing that you can bring forth praise the Lord amen that's the only thing you can bring forth but just like in the natural life there are seas that are being put into the Earth that take years and years and years before they ever bring forth it looks like the tree is bearing it looks like the Earth is barring it looks like our life is barring you think about how the mighty move of God that hit this Edge with what this age have seen that the sign of discernment the son of man Ministry you will think that there will be a people on the Earth praise the Lord in our mind we will think that we can joke we walk to the hospital and and and just throw all the the the the the the the the bed out of the hospital praise the Lord amen can you imagine we came to such a time in this country one of the greatest country in the world we came to such a time with this uh epidemic that there was no hospital bed there was no hospital there people go to the hospital they can't take them in because there was no hospital bed but yet in this very same country where people were the same Word of Life was lying in you praise the Lord the same Word of Life the very life of the creator and yet we were scared to death paradox amen that's God lord of reproduction the seed of Christ must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born against seed of the world must come true they had remember what it is Christ seed how does my seed comes through my body how does an ipose he comes it has to take a body there's a body that that that covers the seed praise the Lord there's a body that covers the sea amen so you see this c word has to be in a bright body not a one-man Ministry no that time of the one man Ministry has done it has to be a body praise the Lord and that's the reason why that seed is not breaking for us yet because the body the the bother is is I mean we're fighting against one another chopping one another on the pulpit you know gossiping about one another and all of that how can we ever come to our potential when we are destroying ourselves we are looking for individual glory and individual praise when it's supposed to be a body the Sea comes in a body that it must have a cloth on are we together there's no time here for individual Glory the days of individual praise is all don't finish God is dealing with a body a people Hallelujah the seed is through the body the church the church is the body of Christ that's right the Bible Church the birth produced now I'm I'm coming down to this promise so just follow me a little bit here himself a body his church his word so that people can see the confirmation of Hebrew 13 8 Jesus the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord amen the purpose is to get a people you're not in time and sign we are uniting around the world the word is our point of contact amen the word is our point of contact there is no Nation there's no city that is our point of contact the word is our prayer of contact he says if you embody mean in my word abide in you are we together it's not because I belong to this guy's group or belongs to this other uh uh man no no it has to be the word it's the nomination hybrid now he says this this is those that in in the orbit waiting for the countdown you know that I mean fixing to take a rocket Glory these are not denominational hybrid not standing here they are mad no sir it is the sea glory be to God although the denomination churches will outnumber the bride now he's coming to this oh oh oh oh Baron rejoice praise the Lord amen when you see uh uh uh all the the the the the atheist movement and you see uh the agnostic movement in all of this movement that you know that that you know that that are just rising and and and and and and in everything that they are doing their blast is is on Christianity praise the Lord the ablast is on Christianity and then how easy it is for people to to to believe in numbers that's how we're supposed to believe in Revelation we are not in the book of numbers we in the Book of Revelation the Revelation brings us to the end we must believe in Revelation we might not never underestimate the power of Revelation how people believe in numbers because a group of people believe that this is right so we must all do it right praise the Lord but the Bible says that will be the description of the children of the dissolute they will always outnumbered the children of the married wife are we together they were always outnumbered they were always our number diarrhea's he you know why organic fruits are expensive is because the hybrid wants outnumbered the organic oh yeah that's what organic fruits are expensive because the hybrid one can be spray them they are organic one you got to take care of them you got to make sure you gotta you got to do what you have to do to keep them that way so they are expensive they are few on the market the average ones are everywhere numbers should never be the way which we must Josh things must be charged by their character that the Bears bringing it back to the word right every church is doing it so what so what his cattle is in there has make us to believe the church then to believe the word is that Catholic Spirit every church is doing it so what what did the word says about it let's bring it back to the word because men shall lay by the word of God not by the bread that Catholic gave or the bread that the church gave or the bread the doctrine that the church you know we must bring it back to the word we must bring it back to the word amen amen because this word see do you see why God why God created that that stage of barrenness that's that stage of barrenness was a time for tutorship that state of barrenness was a time to betrayed to betrayed to be trained what will happen if spoken where power was in our hand this world would be blow up because we will use the very same spoken word power that's supposed to heal the sake and raise the dead we will use it and we will touch the atomic bomb and it will blow the whole thing up there is one thing that God take pleasure in training God take pleasure in training teaching his children the Bible says that is the first or record of God that's why the book of Hebrews says teaching is the first article of God he take pleasure in teaching his children praise the Lord living in the word and and especially the age that we are living in you know people can just they they can put things on the internet and you just read it and the other person commented another person coming it spread around so fast it just become a belief system oh wow that's why they say oh wow that's and sometimes it's very far from the reality very far from the reality let Moses down there the man I keep arrived from the presence of the shakana glory right from the presence of the burning bush when those people were down there in slavery and and making breaks and all of that he stepped on the scene the man that could stand before Pharaoh they said let my people God where was Quran and data where were they just runaway Prophet this man that knew that he knew he knew that his life was on the line they have put they have put Billboards of Cash Moses for for 50 million anybody that bring Moses we gave you a palace praise the Lord amen so when Moses stepped forth there from the burning bush even though his beard was trying to disguise him but people could still remember him all right no doubt in my mind because human has never changed somebody was trying to get that 50 million somebody was trying to run to Pharaoh house and say I saw him they said bring him now see him bring him praise the Lord I hope Pharaoh could give Moses the 50 million because Moses brought himself he went right to Pharaoh's house he says here I'm asked give me the money I turned myself in but not to stay here to tell you let my people go praise the Lord but yeah they saw the opening of the Red Sea they saw this man left in his hands to God and changing a bit of water yeah there was a million of people multitudes of people that we gained around this man and says this man is too much about himself praise the Lord yeah with all of that then we came together and says this God is too much about everything is he and Aaron and he and Aaron and he and hero let's get rid of him praise the Lord we live with this guy too long that we really think that's what we are we have lived with this guy this flesh too long praise the Lord from the day you were born that was your twin brother we live with him too long that we think that's who we are praise the Lord amen that is I mean it's so easy for us to uh you know uh brag about our tempered and our patience praise the Lord you better stop that don't don't don't don't make me angry with you don't bring my temple out praise the Lord why couldn't you tell the person keep doing it bring my patient up okay I want to grow impatient continue we live with this guy so much that we think that's really what we are but I'm telling you God got a surprise for you amen he got a surprise for you when you really see yourself will you believe it [Laughter] when you really see yourself praise the Lord are we trying to fix him are we a haircut trying to fix him up with with cream and spread we want him to smell nice we want him to look bright and all of that and yeah he's a guy that is giving us all of this trouble let's continue so we can close right somewhere around here although the denomination churches will outnumber the bride praise the Lord remember that she's going to come from every age amen she's going to come out of every age I have no doubt because there were there were seven Church ages before us that a resurrected Saints are going to be more than the living things praise the Lord because there were seven Church ages before us so you see this this this this this these three four purpose of God having the preeminence what am I trying to say Good Shepherd let's go beyond Church amen having Church must not want to be in this building having Church must be an an everyday thing of our life you can have church right in the kitchen praise the Lord Lord I'm having church I'm thanking you you can Worship the Lord lift your hand you can have church right behind your steering wheel because you want to be an expression of Christ you want to be an expression of him not to make an impression but an expression two different things making an impression you are driving it yourself being an expression you are surrounding and he's reflecting himself through you the denomination will outnumber the bride it tiles into one praise the Lord the Bible teaches that he promised it that he gets down here now to to Isaiah 54. sing all Byron now that then now you see so when Paul took this prophecy he applied it to his age what was his age coming from Lord to Grace now the last day of prophet is also taking the same prophecy applying it to his age what his age coming out of denomination of the denominationalism to the bride that's what make the prophet an interpreter of the word because if not we will be stuck in the interpretation past but he's narrowing it down to our age single Baron you've been born again you've been saved you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but there is still a longing to bring forth Christ there is a long in there you you have a Hungary you are not happy with your life praise the Lord amen most of the time we think being born again is an accomplishment no no it is not you have not started yet all bearing thou that did not bear breakfast into singing cry aloud the other did not travel will try for more other children of the desolate more are the children of the day so they see the people that are bringing reproach to Christ reproach to Christ just another a new feed the other day a woman tried to open the plane in my head and said Jesus told her to do that try to do that people will just think that Christians they're out of their mind people feel on all of these denominational stuff they get so arrogant against the word of God when the word of God tells them to do things they defy the word of God but yet they want to use the name of the Lord many like the children of the desolate they are not children of the married wife they are not children that were brought in the home children that were brought they sit down under the teaching of the world you are taught right using the lord's name you don't have to call it you live it you live it if your life is represented Christ wrong and you never say a swear word you are still blaspheming his name let me tell you young people it's God's design God's family design is to have a parental father and a parental mother the lack of one of that will trouble us in our life we trouble us in our life the lack of one of that will trouble us in our life it will take the grace of God for you to come out to be a successful father if you are not rightly draw up under the tutorship of a mother and a father it will take the grace of God for you to be a successful father to your children that's God's design that's God's design is not a government that gave Parenthood is God that designed Parenthood that's why people get into marriage they become so arrogant the thing now is the money that they are making all the or the education that they have no no no no no no you get the whole picture out of order you are not the one that make Parenthood you did not design it it was long existing before you were born praise the Lord many times of the desired of the the of the parents dealing with a child most of the time it is our desire we don't we don't cater to the child desire we don't try to blend it together we don't we don't look for the harmony we try to impose I'm your father listen to me you listen to me I'll burn you she didn't ask you most of the time that's what we are doing that's not balanced parenting it's not balance parenting praise the Lord but I'm talking about a young man dead in in uh uh in the message Paradise they're talking about a young man this is mine the girl that will marry that man here young man she will have a whole lot of trouble you don't know if he's happy you don't know if he's high he doesn't even say hi you say thank you you don't even say hi and that's the reason why young people we have to be grateful God has given us a word that is parenting us this message is parenting us it's parenting us that what we did now fully receive we can receive it from the word is parenting us is bringing us in a Harmony if you can submit yourself your will to a fact that you can see father that you are approached by faith how much more about the one you see before you praise the Lord that's the reason why this generation just think their parenting is just to have children what are they take care of here or now they leave it to the state amen they can brag that they are parent and it's a state that is taking care of their children praise the Lord it's a divine blessing it's a blessing it's a blessing to the children it's a blessing also to the parents it's also a blessing to the parent we must enjoy our children we must enjoy them God gave them to us for us to enjoy them and sometimes you can enjoy them when they disagree with you oh yeah that's that's a tough part eh it's hard to enjoy that one but yeah you can enjoy them well it shows it shows a sense of growth they might not be saying the right thing or making the right choice but it just shows a sense of growth they are making a choice now the grace there now we must find is how to redirect that but that's what we are talking about here in every age God brings forth his children there is there's there's a a one Elijah and and uh one member of the you know his children are just few in the age and the age is yes you look through the scripture you just see the age it just covered with idolatry all over the place idolatry and evil and slaughtered and all of that but yet there is a never that is keeping his father then yeah he's also finding a way to visit the elites keeping his Vineyard and producing fruits to feel the fuel Inlet that is in a city praise the Lord many are the children of the desolate young man that's the reason why you'll find many of your friends they will not agree with you thank you if you want everybody to agree with you you are not ready to walk with Christ yet they will not agree with you praise the Lord because for them to agree with you they want okay you all have to pierce your ear and cut up cut up your one ear off and then and and strip the eyebrow off and then yeah then we just want you have to conform to them for them to agree with you everybody got to be in a uniform you can be here and be a strange duck but the scripture says sing or Baron praise the Lord it might look like it's difficult I I I don't have no friends I don't have you going through your time of barrenness but wait and see what that is going to produce wait and see what is going to produce is going to produce such a gentleman in your life such a gentleman that peer pressure when I have influence on you praise the Lord because the lack of friends have have just brought you up until you get to the place now where no no no no all right I can do it I can do it because you are not even there there were many times did not have friends you are not there so if you want go go praise the Lord so you see this this dry periods in our life the Bible say think Break Forth rejoice God is allowing it for a season for a reason their season is for a reason he's a Larry Nate for a reason he's trying to build character in you that I feel this you will have on Earth you can sit down and enjoy it not to waste all your life and then your few days you sit down in regret Break Forth while I was telling this I can't get through this now now uh out of my time here I thought about David Ben guren foreign first prime minister praise the Lord he took Isaiah chapter 35 let's look there we'll close with there Terry Ben Guru and took Isaiah chapter 35. oh my where are those Garden leaders that would take their counsel from the scripture praise the Lord that will take their counsel from the scripture the

thing that Pete that Peter says while you go through your favorite trial rejoice you are going through your desert time you are going through your solitary place it looks like you are alone it looks

chapter 41 also where he speaks in the same light lucky I Ezra I said Dry desert land as a dry desert land that's what Palestine was praise the Lord he was pointing to the scripture he was holding this promise that God you said the desert with bluesome with rose that there's it you're going to bring rose out of my dry situation if you can bring skin and signals on Dry Bones so the prophet Ezekiel you can do the same thing to this desert and Israel today stands as one other word best place of agriculture in the desert because a man saw a promise in the word he saw a promise in the scripture and he had to eat when a man's whole to the promise of God's word god used that promise to bless your intelligence you don't use your intelligence on God's word no you use God's word to help your intelligence because using your intelligence so to interpret the world you're just using a canary brain you will be beating on the light praise the Lord oh my strengthen the weak hands can you imagine all of those Jews returning back and he's telling them strengthen their weekends and your feeble niche oh my God strengthen the weak hands we might look like a defeated people but we have a

[Music] Jesus died [Applause] Naomi went away then she went down there to the land of more there she lost her husband she lost her son she came back with a gentai girl you have to realize their boss was not a case man to roof he was a case man to know me he was not a case man to roof roof was just a complete stranger but again we see Naomi giving root the boys by teaching her what she can do on the traction floor why because she want to be redeemed the problem here is the other Christians we become so dogmatic that is hard for us to get out of our comfort zone we become so dogmatic we regulate our life we get a remote temperature gauge we put all of those things on our life sometimes as when we break forth so the Astro ordinary when we break forward when we break forward to an expression desperation give our life to commitment when I see all of these Believers driving over an hour coming to church and and beyond their desire for Fellowship Beyond just want to be in church and being service it also speaks of what God has been able to achieve in your life that sometimes he can carry us beyond their camps he can carry on beyond our comfort level you know there was something I was telling the Book of Leviticus before I close here as I was telling the sacrifices I realized that all the animals that were brought to sacrifice they had to be a domestic animal they have to be one that you are raising at home you don't just go and buy in the market and bring it it had to be one that you are raising one that is dear to you you see that's the reason why when brother Brown was talking about blam batimos he took his pigeon the one that was dear to him the one that was his livelihood sometimes you have to put your livelihood on the line you have to you have to make a sacrifice it blew my mind when I was when I was setting this wrong week that it has to be a domestic animal one that lived with you one that has been around not not something that is strange to you God wants something that is part of you he don't want you to just give him your waste time in your life the time that you don't have he won the town that is so dear to you it has to be dear to you can you imagine raising an animal that has become a friend and now you got to give that friend to be sacrificed for you there has to be something that is dear something that is personal something that is homebound to us that's what God wants foreign [Music] Hosanna Lord I Thank you you are the land that was filled [Music] Jesus died and rose again Heavenly Father dear Lord without doubt to God thank you we read these things in the scripture to God sometimes they go over our head sometimes so God they look so mysterious Lord so pondering to our mind that that Lord all of these things and and most of the time we are so caught up in the flesh that we look at it from a physical standpoint but Lord there's a big picture that you hide in your mind a picture of redemption Lord a picture Lord

back to those days and you will appreciate they were standing there to taught that we would not make it and thought that we would not have food on our table how we take care of our children how we pay the bills you see when when you are in those situation and it don't affect your feverness to God it don't affect your your time of praying and your dedication to the Lord that's that's what we're talking about that's the father training you that's the father putting such a substance in you that the devil can put you to the wall press you to the wall where you don't even know how you have money to take care of your children but it don't change your fairness to God seeing the kind of a pressure that is on this Edge and seeing the things that is going to unfold God has sent his word to build such a character in US [Music] we don't have a promise that the squeeze is going to come but or we will be here during The Squeeze but let that pressure starts to come on the church do we have what it takes do we have what it takes to re to remove seven let God send a sickness in our way do we have what it takes to relieve heaven drop said why should we always suspect good things from the Lord knowing that when God allow trial to come or something to happen to us it's not because he don't love us he's trying to build faith in that moment he wants to use that situation and being feeding you I've always used to wonder when I read Leviticus I used to wanna why why they used to offer the facts to the Lord I was studying this week and I realized the facts have the sacrifice to burn very well
