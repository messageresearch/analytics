[music and singing] And my sins I watch, they [singing and music] are all watch away. Oh my sins I watch [music] away. [music] I'm amazed that you love [music and singing] me. I'm amazed, oh [singing] Lord, that you care. [music] And through [singing] your preious blood [music] I found father and [music] my [singing] sins I watch [music] all [singing] watch away. Oh my sins I wash [music] away. Now [music] when you think about that chorus, I don't know how much of us is retold that you can be [music] earnest to say you are amazed that God love you. Praise [music] the Lord. It's not really just only a song. I believe it came from a deep inspiration [music] from the writer. But when you think about it yourself, does it amaze you that he love you? [music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Do you really feel that it amaze [music] you that God love you? We want to talk a [music] little bit about the love of God tonight. Let's just sing that one more time. [music] Yes, I'm on this. Oh [singing] that [music] you love me. I'm amazed [singing] [music] that you care [singing] through [music] your preious [singing] blood and my [music and singing] sins I watch. Oh, they are all [singing] watch away. Oh, my sins. [music] I watch away. [music and singing] Praise the Lord. You know, I Andrew Crutch sank a song, I don't know why Jesus loved me. And I've I've I've heard uh a lot of religious [music] people around the message uh that things that we must not sing that song because the seals are open. We must not ask the question I don't know why Jesus love me. But I would tell you that uh even in eternity we will still be learning why he love us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music] I don't know [music] why Jesus [singing] loved me. I [music] don't know why he cares. I don't know why he [singing and music] sacrifice his life. Oh, but I'm glad. [singing] [music] I don't know why [singing] Jesus loved me. I don't know [singing] why [music] he cares. I don't [singing] know [music] why he sacrificed his life. Oh, [music] but I'm glad when he [singing] did. Oh, sing more of the earth. Amen. The Lord bless you tonight. Let's take our [music] Bibles. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Because I think for many of us or for some of us the way we understand the grace of God is a little bit different. Luke chapter 10 tonight. Luke chapter 10, Sunday. We read a little bit from Matthew chapter 23. Let's look at another conversation with Jesus and another lawyer, another student of the word, J uh uh uh uh Luke chapter 10-9. after service uh on Sunday. I couldn't get out of my mind loving the Lord with all of your heart and all of your soul and all of your strength. I couldn't get that out of my mind. I I lay there I think about it. I says, "How do we love God with all of our heart?" Think about that tonight. When Jeremiah the prophet of God says the heart is desperately wicked, meaning the heart is unconvertible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then how can we love God with all of our heart? That's why we want to look into a little bit tonight. Just ask that the Lord will bless it. Amen. Luke chapter 10, we read from verse 25. Luke chapter 10. We'll read from verse 25. Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 10. I mean Luke chapter 9. Come on. Put it together there. Luke chapter 10 verse 25. And behold, a certain lawyer stood up to tempt him. This is not the same case. Uh Matthew chapter 22 was a different case. This is different. You will see that the setting year is different. Stood up to tempt him. Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What shall I do to inherit eternal life? This was the same question of the young rich ruler. He said unto him, Jesus said unto this gentleman, what is written in the Lord, how readth down? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is written in the Lord and how readth down? Two different things. What is written and how you read it &gt;&gt; is two different things. You could be reading it completely different contrary from what is written. what is written and how readth. And and he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thyself. &gt;&gt; That's the lawyer answering Jesus this. And he said unto him, Jesus said unto him, "Thou hath answered right. This do and thou shall live." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord add blessing to the reading of his word. You can have the comfort of your seat &gt;&gt; while I remain standing &gt;&gt; and the fellowship continue. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fellowship continue. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Now, so tonight I want us to look at this a little bit. We will just uh do couple of review here and there, but uh I want us to look at this thought tonight and just and just study it together. Jesus, this Lord again is saying to Jesus, "Thou shalt love the Lord with all of thy heart and all of your soul and all of your strength and all of your mind and uh and your neighbor as yourself." Now, in in over in Matthew chapter 22, when we read that, we saw how Jesus uh broke the ten commandments into two. We we we deal with that a little bit on uh uh on Sunday. Today I want for us to look at uh uh a kind of a progression. If you follow me a little bit, you will see it. Okay. Exodus chapter 20. That's where the ten command means. We're reading. Let's go to Exodus chapter 20. Praise the Lord. Exodus chapter 20. And then we read reading from verse one. And God speak unto God speak all these words saying and God speak all these words saying I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other god before me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou shalt not make any thou shall not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them. Don't serve them. For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting their iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the dead and the fourth generation, to them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. That's that's that's the third commandment now. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. But if you look at let's let's go back a little bit. If you look at uh uh the first and the second, if you don't read it closely, it will be difficult for you to be able to tell which was the first and which was the second. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's telling them, you must not have no other god before me. You must not have no graven image. You must not bow down before them. Praise the Lord. So which mean uh uh uh he repeats it. [snorts] He repeats the first commandment. You must have no other god before me. That is the first commandment. The second commandment is that you should not have no grave in image. It's almost like the first. Am I right? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like the first. So he's uh is is is it's more like he's uh he's he's making emphasis. Praise the Lord. You must not have no other god before me. Now, they are coming from the land of Egypt. You have to grab the setting. They're coming from out of the land of Egypt where there were uh hundreds different gods. God of fatality, God of harvest, God of uh the flies, and God of of uh you know, God of everything. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's uh he's he's not only telling them that uh you know uh he's trying to grab grab them from within. It's not just only don't have no other god beside me. But don't also have no graving image. It must not be of the heavens because uh the Egyptian had god of the heavens. Uh what that worship for for for rain and for for whatever they want. You must not have no god of the earth because they have different god. No god of the waters because uh they are god of fatality and everything you know. So he's he's just trying to get this to them. But if you actually look at it, it's the same thing. If you say don't have no other god before me is the same as don't have grading image, don't have water god, don't have heaven god, whatever it is. But he's making emphasis. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then the third commandment uh verse seven is thou shalt now take the name of the Lord thy God in vain for the Lord will now hold him guiltless that take his name in vain. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth commandment is remember the Sabbath vain and keep it holy. Then he make emphasis here. Six days thou shalt labor and do thy work, but the seventh day, you know, he's he's trying to explain it to them. He's trying to make them to see what he's talking about. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when we spoke on Sunday, we put these first four commandments together as the great commandment that Jesus talked about. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Matthew chapter 22, uh, uh, he says, uh, uh, uh, the first commandment, and this is the great commandment, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all of your heart, all of your soul, all of your strength. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Deuteronomy chapter 6. Let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 6. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the setting of Deuteronomy here, the setting of Exodus is that the people have just come out of Egypt. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people have come out of Egypt. They are setting on their journey to the promised land. The setting of Deuteronomy is that Moses is about to leave the people. Between Exod and Deuteronomy, they have 40 years of traveling in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have 40 years between Exod and Deuteronomy. And what is happening here in the book of Deuteronomy is that Moses is uh uh uh he revi he he revising or or rehearsing the commandment. He he's bringing the entire history of the people trying to remind them the children that were born in the wilderness, those that were not in Egypt that did not experience the red seed. He's bringing everybody up to date. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now &gt;&gt; amen. from uh from the first chapter. He's he's he's bringing the people how God brought them out uh through the Red Sea and everything. He's he's he's uh you know trying to do a review with the people. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring them up today because he he's he's not having much time to be with the people. He will soon be taken away. He know that his time is up. He will soon be leaving. and uh uh uh um and and and and they have the the the the promised land ahead of him. But look at this now. 40 years between um Exodus and Deuteronomy. Look at this. Deuteronomy chapter 6. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read from verse one. Now these are the commandments and statutes and judgment which the Lord your God commanded to teach to teach you that ye might do them in the land where ye go to possess it. possess it that that thou may fear the Lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his commandment which I command thee thou and thy sons and your son songs sons all the days of thy life and that the days may be prolonged praise the Lord &gt;&gt; year therefore oh Israel and observe to do this that it may be well with thee, that thou may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers have promised thee in the land that flowth with milk and honey. Here, oh Israel, the Lord our God is one. Praise the Lord. Now, Moses right here, he's about to rehearse the Ten Commandments to them, &gt;&gt; but he's not going to say it to them the way he said it in Exodus. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in Exod, MOSES HAD the Ten Commandments written on plate. He was reading the plate to the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shall not have no other grave in image, not the God, not of the heavens, not the earth. Just like we read in Exodus, he was reading from the two plates that he had in HIS HANDS. NOW, HERE HE'S NOT READING from the plates. He's reading from his experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AFTER WALKING FOR 40 YEARS, he have really understood what God said on those plates. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Are you are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; AFTER WALKING FOR 40 YEARS, he has really understood what God has said, the word that was given to him. So he's not coming back again to to to to uh repeat what uh uh uh he told the people 40 years ago. NOW HE'S TELLING THEM referring back to the same commandment that Yeah. O Israel the Lord your God is one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. THE LORD YOUR GOD IS ONE is the same as don't have no other god beside me. &gt;&gt; Are you grabbing the picture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's he's now he's he's speaking in a in in in a more progressive way. He have had progress with the Lord. HE HAVE UNDERSTOOD HOW GOD HAS BEEN dealing with the people. Now everything we read in Exodus, you must not have no other uh graven in image, not of the heavens, now of the earth, now under the sea. H uh you must NOW BOW BEFORE THEM. EVERYTHING THAT he said right there, he's going to just put them together. When he said, "Yeah, O Israel, THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD. THOU AND THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD THY God with all of thine heart and all of thy soul and all of thy might. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And see what he says in verse six. And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So when Jesus was telling the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 22, he was quoting exactly what Moses said word for word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was not going back to to uh uh the the the written word. Now he was quoting the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 20 was the written word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 6 is now the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can if I can compare it like that just to be able to to give us a picture. So now we so we we what what what we want to look at here is to see uh uh uh all of these years just like I said that Moses uh this is like 40 years he have seen how the people had tempted God. This was the same man that said, "Lord, oh, what what what a people is this?" And and the man that went in the breach between God and the people when God was about to wipe the people out just because of their stubbornness and uh and because of their complaining and everything, he said, "God, what were the nations about about you that you were not able to keep the people that you brought out of Egypt?" &gt;&gt; Right? He have seen all of these things dealing with the people speaking to God. It have given him a lot of experience. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, for Moses, IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THE PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO QUOTE FROM THE TABLETS. The word has become an inspiration now to Moses. &gt;&gt; He honest to it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing where we going? &gt;&gt; Now think about this also. These people that their heart was after the garlic of of Egypt and WHENEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING that came up, they were ready to tell Moses they want to go back. How could God ask them to love him with all of their heart? How how praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How could God ask them to love him with all of their heart when their heart was not really after following the Lord their heart was back in Egypt? How could he ask him? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same question will be for you and myself tonight. How could how can the Lord ask us &gt;&gt; to love him with all of our heart? How do we do it? How do we love him with our soul and with our mind and and and with our strength? How do you love the Lord with your strength? How do you love him with your strength? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, I sleep in sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and keep thinking on this. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we just we just want to fellowship around that tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to fellowship around that tonight and see how how the Lord uh will be able to help us tonight. Let's look at Hebrew chapter 4. Let's look at Hebrew chapter 4. One of our familiar scripture, Hebrew 4:12, the word is sharper than the two edges sword. Let's let's look at that. Praise the Lord. Amen. Hebrews chapter 4:12. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edges who are piercing even to the dividing the sun of the soul and the spirit. Praise the Lord. So right here Paul is giving us an idea that our soul and our spirit has a dividing aunder. They are not the same. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your soul and your spirit are not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said the word of God is sharper. The word can go right in between and help you to know what reality is your soul and your your your the real you. And also to help you to know what is your spirit. The things uh uh that make up your attitude, your behavior, your like and your dislike. &gt;&gt; It's all in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. and see what he says again. And he says the word dividing the sun is piercing even to the dividing the sun of your soul and your spirit. And it goes to and of your joints and marrow. Amen. and is a descender of your thoughts and the intents of your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you look at this, you see here what I want us to see right in Hebrew 4:12 is that your soul, your spirit, your mind a descender of your thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your mind and and and uh and and and what again is there your uh uh your maron uh your joints and your maron. Now I was looking at this today if uh if uh if if I don't know if I attach it to my notes but let me read this to you. This is uh something I was searching on how how is the maron connected to our strength. because I'm looking at Hebrew 4 to be able to understand how can I love the Lord with all of my strength. &gt;&gt; I see my soul. I see my spirit. I see my mind which is my thoughts, my intent. Now, so I was also looking at it. See, see what it says here. The phrase the human strength from the marrow can refer to a several concept nutritionally or nutrition strength where bones marrow uh provide fats and nutrients that contribute to the human evolution. physical and structural strength where bones marrow can help distribute impart energy to joints and uh spiritual or symbolic strength where maron refer to the very cord of one being and is used in the phrase like the mar of the bone. to denote deep core strength and I also look at this one too. The saying there the he strain comes from the mara is is uh is partly uh a kind of a manifold referring to the inner cord of the strength but it it also has a base a basis in the in the the the functional strength that bone marrow provides for the entire body. The bone marrow create nearly all our blood cells which which are uh crucial for carrying oxygen and fighting disease and clocking blood. Why is stem cells is v for the repair and regeneration of tissues and bones. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay, those are all scientific uh uh uh knowledge and idea. But what I was what I was actually looking at is the just like I said to you how how that's God is telling us to love him with all of our heart, all of our mind. Is it is it just keeping your mind on God? That's the law. That that's the way we should love him. That the whole day our mind should just be on him. Or is it just uh uh you know we wake up in the morning and all we do we read our Bible, we pray, we I mean we just do things uh uh religious things. Is is it what is required of us to love the Lord with all of our strength? What actually it is? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it's beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very beautiful. Now, so look at Hebrew chapter 4. As as we look at the thought together, the Bible is letting us know that the word is shephering the two edges sw and and generally we uh this is referred to as the preaching of the word. But go back to St. John chapter one. In the beginning was the word. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and that was what we said on Sunday that that was the first form that God took when he left the form of being an eternal spirit. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; His first expression was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He expressed himself and and and what was he doing? He was condescending. &gt;&gt; Yes. He was coming down. Are we together? &gt;&gt; TO TAKE A FORM WHERE he can relate to us. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was taking a form. He was condescending to take a form where he can relate to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now look, look here. Let's let's just uh read this little thought here in statute of a perfect man. We took a quote here that we want to uh uh just use that and and relax our mind a little bit. What is it? God condescending to his creation. God want to be worshiped. The word God means an object of worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for. &gt;&gt; Think about it now. You just think about those words. God conditioning us so he can get from us what he created us for. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when you think on that, he never made you to be something else beside a son and a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says and and uh if you have missed that or being a son of God or being a daughter of God, you just enjoy being a church member, you just enjoy being an American, you just enjoy being whatever you think you are. If you miss that being a son of God or a daughter of God, then you have missed the mark. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You have missed the mark. You have missed your purpose. You have missed your purpose for being here. Now, so here is he conditioning us now. How is he conditioning us? That's what we want to look into a little bit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, here is the great internal spirit. Now condescending he's coming down to be able to relate to us and he TOOK THIS FORM CALLED THE logus which of course is that's what is called the word. So this word now this this this word uh uh uh that uh this FORM THAT GOD HAS TOOK BY THIS FORM HE'S GOING TO create everything. That's what the book of pollution says. He created everything by his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hebrew also testify by that by the word of God everything was created. And that's the that's the very same word now that Paul is saying here. The very same word that created everything is the same word he says is sharper than the two edges swall and and tears into the dividing the sun of our spirit and our our soul our uh the mars of our bone. the descenders of our thoughts and the desenter of the thoughts and the intents of our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God is so good. &gt;&gt; When you really think about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you really think about it, &gt;&gt; think about this phrase. When love projects. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When love projects. Now you think about it. The Bible says, "For God so loved the word that he gave his only son." It was not just through the virgin birth. For God so loved the word that he gave his son. Goes back to Genesis when God condescended and took the form of the logos. It was God giving his son. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the beginning of the son. But see what is associ ASSOCIATED TO FOR GOD SO LOVETH THE WORD. AMEN. For God SO LOVED THE WORD THAT UH HE SENT HIS word like like like the psalmist WOULD SAY HE SENT his word and his word heal us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He sent his word. THAT WORD THAT GOES OUT and and and and and and starts to identify your soul and starts to, you know, capture your spirit AND HEAL YOUR BODY AND DISCERN YOUR THOUGHTS AND TELL YOU THE INTENTS OF YOUR HEART. THAT VERY WORD IS GOD'S LOVE EXPRESSED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you Are you grabbing the picture? is God's LOVE FOR GOD SO LOVE THE WORD. He love the word that he's he's coming down. HE HE'S TAKING A FORM uh uh to be able to associate with us. Not just to BE A A GOD OF DEAD and and we just as people down on earth, but he's coming down to fellowship with us, &gt;&gt; to commune with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if HE'S TELLING US THAT WE MUST LOVE HIM WITH ALL OF OUR HEART AND ALL OF OUR SOUL AND ALL OF OUR MIND AND ALL OF OUR STRENGTH, which of course he knows that we don't have the ability to do it. So you see, IT'S THAT VERY SAME LOVE, THAT VERY SAME WORD that is coming down, that very same word that is discerning your heart, that very same word that is that is uh going IN BETWEEN THE DIVIDING THE SUN of your soul AND YOUR SPIRIT. THAT IS THE VERY SAME WORD. AND THAT WORD IS THE love of God expressed to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So are you seeing the picture? not clear yet. The picture here is that uh UH UH GOD IS WAS NOT relying on the ability of THE PEOPLE. HE KNOWS THAT BY NO WAY THE PEOPLE WILL KEEP THIS COMMANDMENT. &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE WERE UNCONVERTED. THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE WERE BACK IN EGYPT. They had NOT THEY HAD REALLY NOT UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; YES. Praise the Lord. HE'S MAKING ALL OF THESE EMPHASIS TO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE NO GRAVE IN IMAGE and and BECAUSE HE KNOW A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE GOT INTO THE EGYPTIAN WORSHIP. THEY HAVE THEIR LITTLE IMAGES UNDER THEIR BLANKETS and whatsoever. Are we together? BUT YOU SEE, GOD WAS GOING TO USE HIS WORD. He was going to use his word as he keeps speaking to the people. Take it take it in. Take the picture of Eliza and Rebecca and you will you will you will grab it. Amen. Yeah. Eric Elea here is speaking to this WOMAN ABOUT A MAN CALLED ISAAC THAT she have not seen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT THE MORE THAT ELA TALKED TO HER, THE MORE AN EMOTION IS creating in HER HEART TO LOVE THIS MAN THAT SHE HAVE NOT SEEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE IT IS GOING TO BE THE WORD THE WORD THAT COMES TO TO DIVIDE YOUR THE YOUR YOUR SOUL AND SPIRIT AND YOUR MARANCE AND YOUR THE INTENSE OF YOUR HEART IS GOING TO BE THIS VERY SAME word that is going to create the love of God in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the principle of when love projects. &gt;&gt; We have a projector here. We have our team back there. When we sing in a song, we call the song and they they tap it on their keyboard through the main electronic. It gets from the keyboard and hit the projector and then the the projector send it on this wall. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When love projects, you have to you you have to you have to pay attention now and see how this whole thing is working. Now when when the projector project the words this word h this this wall has to be fashioned in a way painted in a way that the letters can be able to express just like they did just now when love projects. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. This do not have these letters in it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. UNTIL THE PROJECTOR sent it, there is no way this war can produce when love projects. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's giving US HIS WORD. LOVE ME WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART AND ALL OF YOUR SOUL AND ALL OF YOUR MIND. HOW CAN WE DO IT? love will project it. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; GOD PROJECTING HIS LOVE &gt;&gt; FOR YOU AND MYSELF. WE SEE IT AS A REQUIREMENT. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; FOR GOD, HE WANTS YOU TO BE AVAILABLE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wants YOU TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE WHAT? HE'S GOING TO CONDITION YOU. &gt;&gt; God conditioning us &gt;&gt; to be ABLE TO GET FROM US what he made us for. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the principle? &gt;&gt; When love projects. So, I mean, uh, if we if we didn't had a wall year or maybe we had uh uh uh uh I I I don't know what how to how to say, but uh uh uh uh just just an airspace year and the projector will project whatever they want to project. You will never see what is projecting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there is there is not a a a substance here to receive it. Are we together? &gt;&gt; There is not a substance here to be able to receive it. The wall is here. It's painted right. The the change the letters there. Take for example if the if they make the letters in gray color just like the color of this wall. It's going to be hard for us to see it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's just going to blend in with the wall. You might just think it's a pin on the wall until you come. Oh yeah. Well, that it's a writing day. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because for many, we see it like a requirement. And because we see it as a requirement, we work ourself towards loving God with all of our heart. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we think it's something that we have to do and we work oursel with loving God with all of our mind and we think that is SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO work our mind. And what's about loving God with all of our strength, loving God with our spirit, which of course what you want to see, you look at the five senses of the spirit. And we think that we have to work ourself in all of these things to be able to keep that commandment because that is the great commandment. Love the Lord with all of your heart, with all of your mind, with all of your strength. How are we going to do it? WHEN WE ARE NOT BORN WITH the love of God, we not born with the love of God. WE ARE BORN WITH HIM A LOVE. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; GIVE US THE CHANCE. YOU just give us the chance. Let's grace just give us the chance. &gt;&gt; And what what is in us is ready to run to sin. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The thing that is in us is ready to love something that hit God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what THAT'S WHAT THE SEX BIRTH produce &gt;&gt; that that that law that is within us. IT'S READY TO LOVE something that that that is against the LAW OF GOD. WELL, WE NOT we are not born with THE LOVE OF GOD. HOW CAN WE THEN LOVE HIM WITH ALL OF OUR HEART? Love projects. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God projects his love and your heart is just like a ball that is able to receive from the projector. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; This Bible is the projector. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And as the word as the word as the love for God is being preached from this Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your heart is like the projector string. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And your AND AND AND YOUR HEART IS receiving &gt;&gt; and reflecting and you look here and IT SAYS, "OH WOW, GOD LOVES ME. OH WOW. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the songwriter says, "I'm amazed. I'm amazed. Oh wow. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT uh we reduce his love to substance. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF GOD'S LAW WAS HIS WORD. YEAH. &gt;&gt; When he condemn when he when he uh was condescending when he condensed himself he condensed himself into the word that is called the logos. That is God's first expression. HIS FIRST EXPRESSION TO YOU IS NOT GIFTS. It's not what he gave you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not what he GIVES YOU. HIS FIRST expression to you is his word. &gt;&gt; He sent forth his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And something IN YOUR HEART WAS ABLE TO receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You keep asking yourself, well, if if if you love me, he say, I love you. It's written on your heart. I love you. If you really love me, why am I wearing this clothes? &gt;&gt; Why I don't have money? That's that's what your mind is thinking. &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord. That's what your mind is THINKING BECAUSE THE MIND THAT THAT IS THE IDOLATRY THAT GOD WAS TELLING THE PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE NO OTHER FORM OF IDOLATRY IS THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR MIND BECAUSE GOD HAS BEEN REVEAL REDUCED to substance. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS A PROOF THAT GOD LOVE YOU. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS AS A PROOF THAT GOD LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Have you cropped the picture? &gt;&gt; If not, I I'm going to labor a little bit. &gt;&gt; If it's not clear to you, let me labor a little bit. If it's clear to you, then let's pray and go home. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HOW WE HOW WE GOING to How do we love him with our strength? How? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at this principle again. [clears throat] The same principle works in this way. The principle of a pattern is not a pattern until it has been accepted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As a pattern. That's right. &gt;&gt; Like I said many times, the difference between God DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL LOVE for you because you in church Wednesday night &gt;&gt; and he have a different love for the man that is on the street uh uh uh on the drugs. No, no. God love is not passure. &gt;&gt; There is no partiality in his love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you SEE THE DIFFERENT HERE is that uh grace has been given to you &gt;&gt; to receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grace has been given to you for FOR FOR THE LOVE THAT IS PROJECTED TO YOU for it to reflect on you and YOU CAN SAY OH WOW GOD LOVED ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he has not he has not THE THE SAME LOVE IS PROJECTED to him because h the Bible says his blessing fall upon the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The same grace that woke you up this morning is the same grace that woke the the the homeless men on the street. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME GRACE THAT WOKE THE GUY THAT STONED HIMSELF UP WITH DRUGS AND he he didn't even know where he WAS SLEEPING. HE WOKE UP IN the morning. He just realized that he's up. He can't even get up straight. It's the same grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Moses told the people don't not to have any graven image. Why? Because their God was re was reduced to substance. They have to have a certain image before them for them to realize that this is their God. Amen. And that's WHAT GOD DON'T WANT US TO DO. He don't want us to reduce him to substance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He want US TO SEE HOW HE'S PROJECTING his love to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Projecting it in our strength and projecting it in our mind that we can have our right mind. We can have our mind on the right things. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And not on the things of of of the word, not on perverted things, not on uh uh uh things of jealousy and envy. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is shepherd in the two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what the word does. &gt;&gt; Yes. When the word is preached, when the word goes out, it express itself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It express itself. The grace when love is projected, brother Bannam says, then sovereign grace takes over. Amen. &gt;&gt; That love of God was projected to the word just like God so loved the word that he gave his only begotten son. This time was in a being was in a child that was born in the manger. THAT WAS GOD'S LOVE THAT WAS EXPRESSED. IT WAS PROJECTED TO the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the people that he was sent on, they rejected him. Yes, &gt;&gt; they couldn't see him as the love of God. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY ASSOCIATE HIM TO A GIRL THAT SAYS SHE WAS MARRIED, THE GIRL THAT WAS EXPOSED TO A MAN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the So, they associate THIS LOVE OF GOD, THIS GIFT THAT WAS BORN, THIS GIFT THAT WAS ANNOUNCED TO ANGELS ON THE HILL. The angels was in the field. I mean the shepherds was in the field and the angels told them YOUR KING IS BORN THERE IN Bethlehem and they came and THEY THEY FOUND THE PLACE. AMEN. And and and and uh and and and and THE WORSHIP THE WHOLE NIGHT THEY WERE SINGING SONGS. They could see it. WHY? BECAUSE THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECTED TO THEM AND AND AND HELPED THEM TO SEE THAT THIS is the gift of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they could accept it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; THE THREE THE THREE WISE MEN THAT WERE TRAVELING HAD TO TRAVEL FOR THREE YEARS. THE LOVE OF GOD PROJECTED TO THEM THROUGH A STAR THAT WAS SHINING. &gt;&gt; THEY COULD ASSOCIATE THAT STAR WITH THE WORD OF GOD. A STAR WILL RISE OUT OF JACOB. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THE LOVE OF GOD. THEY FOLLOW IT. THEY CAME. THEY SAW THE BABY. THEY WORSHIP HIM. THEY GIVE HIM GIFTS. But all the religious men that were in the time says he's an illegitimate child. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; With with WITH THE WORD OF GOD OPEN, WITH THE TORAH OPEN BEFORE THEM, they are reading day and night LOOKING FOR THE MESSIAH. HE'S BORN RIGHT BEFORE THEM. &gt;&gt; And they said he's an illegitimate child. Praise [clears throat] the Lord. &gt;&gt; And yet these guys are trying to love God with all of their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for them to prove that they are loving God WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART, they have to wear white garments. They have to wash their hands. They have to don't do this, do this. They are trying to prove. They are trying to keep the word. AMEN. BUT THE PROMISED BIAH IS BIRTHED RIGHT BEFORE THEM. And he said he's an illegitimate child. How do we love God with all of our heart? Praise the Lord. How do we Is it in our dos and our done? No. No. When you really start to appreciate the love of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you really start to appreciate the love of God, that is not just a word to you that God love you, but it's something that you feel. &gt;&gt; Amen. is something that you feel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Have you ever got a feeling of love? Have you ever got a feeling h I just listened to brother Brown? You was you was uh talking there story about uh uh uh uh what's the fellow name? Forgetting his name here. Just on top of my mind here. And uh uh uh you remember the story. He you know uh his name is just on my mind. Uh he was going to work and then uh uh you know he and his wife were just talking some things in the house and he kissed her bad and he left and he turned around and came back again and you know uh and then he had to kiss her for the second time. He said the second one high feeling in it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because as he was going to work, he was thinking, "Oh my she's sad. Why is something happen and I don't come back?" Or why is something happen to her when I'm gone? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of those thoughts in his mind make him to turn around and he went back home. He never said nothing to her that, "Oh, I'm sorry." He didn't settle nothing. He just kissed her for the second time and then he left. But this time she was not behind the door crying. She came outside and she never say anything. She just wave by &gt;&gt; and he says that one had feelings in it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see because we because uh we have associated the love of God with with with with substance with things we go many times not feeling the love of God. not feeling his love that is projected towards us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Have you Have you ever got to that place where you you you really feel? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To feel his love. to really feel his love and think what did I do that I deserve his love? Why among the millions of people on earth praise the Lord? Do we ever get to that place? You see, because love has been has has lost its meaning and it has been put into substance. The very same thing. Our children don't feel that we love them until we buy something for them. They always have to be something. Some kind of a thing has to be given for a person to feel that they are love. Praise the Lord. Love must always be associated to some kind of an act. But just think about the thought of it. Praise the Lord. Are you with me tonight or I've lost you? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I hope I didn't do that because uh it won't be a good thing. And then we have to preach this for the second time again. Amen. And I will have problem doing it because uh uh I I really wanted to go home. God projected us. Lord, the Bible says while we were yet sinners, while we were yet sinners, not one good work has come out of us. While we were yet sinners, he love us. He love us. Do we feel the love that is projected towards us? Do we feel it? Do we feel God love that is projected towards us? When we look around us, we look at the people he he puts in our life. We look at the things that he has brought us out of. Do we feel it? Praise the Lord. Have you ever got to that place where I mean you are just hit with the love of God? You feel like you don't deserve it and it it just it just break you down and and you just say the Lord why why you love me like this. Praise the Lord. You see because uh uh uh uh the love for God has been has been reduced to substance. NO MATTER HOW MUCH GOD GAVE US, we just appreciate it for a little while and yet we want more and then we looking we're looking through the the looking to the next door where the next gift is coming from. We're looking for where where is the next thing is coming from. But the first expression of his love was a word. That's why brother Brandon says that they will never know until you say it to them. I love you. It's gone from our society. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it must always be it must either be a flower or it must be a bottle of water or it must be something uh you know uh uh UH AND JUST THAT EXPRESSION OF I love you to say it and mean it and feel it. Praise the Lord. And that is the same way WE HAVE TO PUT SOME KIND OF A religious act or give SOME SOME SOME MONEY INTO THE CHURCH or or DO SOMETHING IN THE SERVICE OF GOD to really prove that we love God. Can you get down and just tell him I love you? Say it to him, I love you. And really mean it and feel it. &gt;&gt; And feel it. Tell him you love him without associating anything to it. BECAUSE WHEN HE EXPRESS HIS LOVE TO YOU, WHEN HE SAID HE LOVE YOU, HE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING ELSE. He just love you. Praise the Lord. When love is projected, can you really be able to project? Can we be able to project love from our heart by just expressing it? Not taking on anything because the devil is going to blow your mind and and he's going to bring all the nasty thing you have done and and and and and how uh uh uh ungrateful you are and your mind will just go that it even becomes heavy to say I love you. Praise the Lord. It's almost like it becomes heavy for the man to tell his wife, I love you. Even if there is no flower, there is no candy, there is nothing, it must be our first expression. It must be something that that that that projects out of us that even if you don't say it, the feeling the mutual feeling can be there. You can feel it. A child must be able to feel that from from from their parents. [snorts] It must not always be in gifts or something done. The feeling just that feeling what a parent can look in the eye of the child and and and both hearts is beating together. love is being projected. Praise the Lord. Because sometimes that's what God does in the midst of everything that we are going through. We you see it as a problem. You see it as a struggle. But he he's just his heart is just beating towards you. I love you. Can you see that? I love you. Malachi chapter 1, Israel struggle with that. God came and told them how he loved them. They says, "How can you love? ARE WE JUST FROM CAPTIVITY? HOW CAN A GOD THAT LOVE HIS PEOPLE ALLOW them to go into captivity? They could not wrap their mind around it BECAUSE THE HUMAN MIND, THE WAY THE HUMAN MIND UNDERSTAND LOVE, it must always be wrapped in some kind of a paper with shiny stuff on it. Even if it is from dollar tree, just wrap it with some kind of a shiny thing on it. That's how the human mind understand love. But with God is an expression. &gt;&gt; It's an expression. It's an expression. Sometimes he said he says it in a way. He says it in a silence. I love you all. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's just like you you you you behind the the the the the the glass door or the glass window and you just I love you. I love you. &gt;&gt; The kids will blow kisses. I love you. Let the love go. &gt;&gt; Sometime that's what GOD IS DOING. HE'S JUST BLOWING his love, blowing kisses to you. And we just looking at things around us. Everything looks oh, everything looks the same and everything looks how how is God love me because we have reduced the love of God to perishable things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But when God love you, he send you his word. And that word goes there and it restore your soul. &gt;&gt; It goes and gets your mind straight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It starts to identify your characteristics as he exposes his characteristics to you. HE TRIED TO IDENTIFY YOUR OWN CHARACTERISTICS, SHOW YOU YOUR ABILITIES, SHOW YOU YOUR PURPOSE. When love is projected, Praise the Lord. When love is projected, if you really think about it, if you think about it, you find bunch of Christians, it's something that they they they they can't remember the last time where they said it in their prayer, Lord, I love you. We can call all his great name. You are Jehovah Jara. You are the alpha and omega. YOU ARE THE ALMIGHTY GOD. You you can we can say all of that. Give him all the praises and he will never still feel love. Why? Because you don't say it. We can show GOD ALL THE GREAT ARTS. Praise the Lord. It's a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing. Even when God takes us through trials, what he want us to hear is I love you. When you hear that, when you hear that in difficulties, if you can be able TO HEAR THE VOICE OF God saying I love you in difficult, no matter what you are going through, it will not stand to your face. because you begin to feel his love. Now you have a purpose attached to your trial. You see it not as a trial but you see it as God love expressed to you &gt;&gt; because you hear it in a way. I love you project will continue another time. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How do we love him with all of our heart? It's not you loving him with all of your heart. Is you receiving the love that he has projected to you. &gt;&gt; It's you receiving it. It's you embracing it. It's you embracing it. Having an inner feeling that is not associated to church. It's not associated to certain belief. But you know that God loved me. I know he loved me. Praise the Lord. I know he loved me. I can feel it. It's becoming real to me. It's now in substance. Praise the Lord. That's why those people who go they could go to the to the death port singing song to God. They are going to their death. Why? Because they fear his love. They fear that it was an honorable thing. It was a love of God. There was a way of themh expressing their love back to him. Having a fellowship of his death. And if there is one thing that we need is the love of God. Praise the Lord. Is the love of God. Not just as a subject, the love of God where we can be able to express it to him. You express it, you feel it, and you say to him, "Lord, I love you. I love you. I love you. I love [clears throat] you." It's is it's tangible. Thank you for loving me. Lord bless you tonight. Let the musicians come forward. Let's pray. Let's bow our heads and pray tonight. [snorts] Heavenly Father, dear Lord, and just thank Sunday Lord that just just had this thought on my mind and just been laboring with it. Father, oh God, just like that song says, Lord, we never really never get to know. Sometimes we become so so religious in our mind because I'm the bride of Christ, because I'm predestinated. Those are just those are just things that we are repeating that we have heard. Father, I can say tonight, boy, many of us can say, we really don't know why you love us. Brother Bannon said, if a man find a wife that he love and he don't know why, and she found a husband that she love and she don't know why, he says, uh, he says that's that's internal. He said that's internate. Now you think about it. If that is in the natural, how much more about inner spiritual heavenly father Lord you said in your word that God iniquity would abound and the love of God will wise cold. We living in such a time Lord where people are gone away from the love of God. We love church. We love our pastor. We love our friends. We love our family. But father God, we need to get back Lord God to loving you. Yes, Lord Jesus. Father, teach us, Lord. Teach us, oh God, to learn to tell you that we love you. Teach us, Lord, to learn to [music] tell the people around us that we love them. It must not be difficult for us to tell our wives, our husband. It must not be difficult for us to tell our parents. It must not be a ceremonious thing. It must be a half a thing. When you tell your children, I love you, Father. Lord I pray tonight [music] may we feel the love of God that's being projected to us Lord by sending your word by sending your word the message of the hour many time we don't see that as the love of God we [music] see that as rules we see that Lord Father as rules as as as uh commandments Lord [music] Father glory Every day my heart [music and singing] will praise him.

Let's [music] stand on our feet tonight. Yes. [singing] All I want to do is glory. [singing] [music] I'm so glad I feel his [singing] glory.

Thank you father. Lord, thank you tonight. Oh God, and we just pray [music] that Father, Lord, let that projection of your Lord just draw us in, Father, may it be able to help us to see beyond our works, [music] Lord. Father, beyond, Lord God, our abilities, Lord, our failures, Lord Jesus, we want to love you. While we were yet sinners, [music] you love us, oh God. We thank you tonight. We thank [music] you tonight. A moment like this. A moment [music] like this. I will [music and singing] sing out a song. Oh, I will sing [singing and music] out a long song to Jesus. [music] Oh, [singing] moment [music] like this. I will be for [singing and music] my hands. I will lift up [music] my hands [singing] to the Lord. Singing I love you. Singing I [music] love [singing] [music] you Lord. Oh hallelujah. Sing [singing and music] Lord [music and singing] you Lord. Oh, [music] sing it th [singing] you love [music] [singing] I love you. I listen to a [music] story of a Japanese girl that was testifying. You know, their culture is just [music] it's full of discipline, full of respect. You bow your heads down. But she said [music] they could never say I love you. She never saw her father telling the mother I love you or the father telling [music] the children I love you. It was something that was not in their culture. So she was always shocked when [music] she saw people saying I love you. And the first time that she told her dad that I love you, they went [music] silent on on the phone for the long time dead silent when he when she [music] just told her, "Dad, I love you." He couldn't say a word to her. [music] She didn't know what to say next. And then after a while the silence broke and they [music] started talking. The dad did not really responded I love you too because he had never done it in this life to him. The daughter don't need to say I love you because she [music] can kneel down, she can bow her heads. She's respectful. But then after the period of time, [music] she realized how that simple expression of I love you changed their family [music] dynamics tremendously. Every time she talked to her dad, she was says I love you dad. And then he started beginning to say I love you [music] too. And it just changed their family dynamics. things that they will fuss about started becoming [music] easy to understand. And that's how we understand the love of God. That's how we understand the word of God. The things that God required us when we see it through the eyes of love. [music] It changed the picture. It changed the relationship. [music] The Lord bless you. I'll see you on Sunday. Oh [music and singing] yes, I love [singing] you. [music] Oh, [singing] sing it. I [singing and music] love you all. [music] Oh, sing [singing] it. I love you, Lord.
