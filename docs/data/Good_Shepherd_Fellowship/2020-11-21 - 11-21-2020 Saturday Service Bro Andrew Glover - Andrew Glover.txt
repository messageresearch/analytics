counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you tonight and i just pray the lord would come and speak to our hearts tonight and sure appreciate brother juan appreciate his invitation to come and it's your first time being here so we say god bless you all this evening and for those of you who don't know me i'm brother andrew glover we're from virginia there our pastor's brother sean martin and the saints are at faith tabernacle so they send greetings to you and brother sean as well so i just love the lord and believe this message amen i believe god i don't believe god sent this message on accident i believe somebody's going to believe it amen i believe somebody's going to live it and i believe somebody's going to take a rapture by it and i just have to say i believe that somebody's me you believe that about yourself tonight prophet of god said if one's leaving jeffersonville make sure it's you and i think tonight that's how how sure we've got to become that if anybody's leaving this meeting tonight in the rapture it's going to be uh say man amen the book of numbers the 33rd chapter looking here in the 50th verse the bible here says and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye are past over jordan into the land of canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and pluck down all their high places and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more you shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit but if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell now this is amazing how god tells moses this and moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them isn't it something that that disobedience can actually change the very thoughts of god that he would deal with you the way he would deal with his enemies he says now if you'll do these things i won't deal with you that way but if you don't do these things then i'll have to deal with you the way i thought to deal with your enemies now in the book of revelation the second chapter revelation the second chapter we want to look there in the 20th verse revelation the second chapter in the 20th verse you love the lord this evening amen revelation 2 and verse number 20 here now jesus speaking here in this this age he says notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols now notice here in verse 21 and i gave her so she didn't she didn't earn this she didn't work herself into this but he actually says i gave her it was a gift i gave her a space to repent of her fornication and she repented not i gave her a space to repent of her fornication and she repented not we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there for just a few moments this evening by the help of the lord and from those scriptures if i could i want to speak to you here for a few moments on a thought if i would title it tonight maybe just title it this it's time to deal with it it's time to deal with it and i believe tonight that we've gathered here for the first night of these meetings this weekend and i believe we've come here that the lord might deal with our lives he might deal with our hearts he might speak to us and he might change us that we would not leave these meetings the way we came but we would leave different we would leave closer to him and i'll just maybe maybe share this with you is just a foundation here of where the lord began to deal with my heart on this thought and i'll just sit like this sometimes in traveling and preaching uh being in different prayer lines you'll stand there and you'll you'll have multiple people come up for prayer some will come up for healing some will come up for deliverances and it's uh actually one thing that's always amazed me is when you hear the different needs of people and you would you just begin to maybe process that process that through your mind and i was in a prayer line not long ago and a person came up and they were going through some things they were facing some battles and some things and some troubles and when they come up for prayer they actually just said i'm trying to find a way to live with it or i'm trying to find a way to deal with it and it began to dawn on me that we find many people today that they're trying to find ways to put up with things that they don't have to put up with they're trying to they're trying to find a way to live with something that really they don't have to live with or or find a way to deal with something that really they don't have to deal with now we realize as christians that we are in spiritual warfare now we know the spiritual warfare is actually between the powers of satan and the powers of god bible says hey we see how can overcome we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest of all ages this laodicean church age is the grandest of all ages he says because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity he says and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been he says and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age now to think tonight that we're not living in an easy age we're not living in an age amen where everything's going to be just a happy age going to be easy to get through but we're living in a time where there's going to be struggles where there's going to be battles and the prophet is telling you here that the reason there's going to be these battles is because the powers of satan amen is many times harder to fight against in this age than any age before now i think of how that there is the powers of satan but lest not so much tonight amen focus on the powers of satan but let's look at the powers of christ i i believe just as the powers of satan are are joining their forces together and they're they're building their their their strengths together to try to stop the church and to try to stop the moving of god amen i believe that the power of christ has come down amen to liberate those who are captured amen and bound by the powers of satan to think tonight amen that if you're bound by the powers of satan you don't have to remain like that amen but there is a higher power there there is a more greater power that can come into your life tonight and can break the powers of the enemy then when we gather together amen in meetings like this we don't gather here to be seen amen we don't gather here to be heard we don't gather just a singer and then just to preach a sermon but we gather here amen that christ might come in the church amen and deal with our hearts and our lives according to the word now paul will say this way in hebrews 10 25 he will say not forsaking amen the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is amen but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching now now to think tonight that we're living in a time amen where the house of god has become the last thing on people's list right amen it's become well if i got time i'll go to church if i got time i'll pray amen but the bible says that there should be more earnest now amen for the house of god than there was when you first got saved they been defaint tonight church that this is the last days amen amen these are the final hours these are the closing moments of the history of the world and there is a bride here amen that is not going to be bound by the powers of satan amen but there's a hole in the rock tonight she can run into and the power of god can set her free my when i think of how the bible says not forsaken the assembling of ourselves together then i begin to think of how amen that we come to church now the prophet says as we study this my purpose of this how can overcome he said if this is not just a community fellowship with you people which i love to do that but if i had a chance to do that i would come to your home and shake your hand and talk with you and sit down and eat dinner with you and sit down under the shade tree and talk and fellowship a while he said but when we come here amen we are here for one specific purpose when we when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is amen the house of correction this is the throne this is the throne of god and judgment goes forth from the house of god and here is where we come together in love with one another as only christians can love he said but in here we are under a leadership of the holy spirit and the holy ghost is among us so when we come here amen we are not here under man's leadership we are not here under a church's leadership but when we come in here amen we are here under the leadership of the holy ghost amen and this is a house of correction we're here amen to take a reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcomings and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are and where we ought to be he said that's what we study ministers study those places for the people when they see the people that lack then they begin on that amen now how many will agree that there is a past amen how many will agree there is a present amen then how many will agree there is a future there is a past there is a present and there is a future and a prophet of god is saying what we're here in the house of god for amen it's not soup suppers amen it's not handshakes but we're here amen to see if your pastor's behind you amen to see where you're standing and to see where the word says you can be amen and to preach a word amen that will take you by the hand and say now let's move on church amen let's go into higher heights amen amen let's go into deeper depths and i pray tonight amen that the same god amen that appeared before would appear here tonight and would take the church by the hand and say come on church let's go a little bit higher amen let's go another round higher and there is a place we can go where the powers of satan are broke over the church ah to think tonight amen i believe that god ordains and arranges these meetings i don't believe amen that a man just puts a couple dates together amen but i believe before the foundation of the world amen that god ordains and arranges each service not just in a special meeting amen not just on a saturday night but on a wednesday night amen on a sunday morning wherever the believers gather in the name of the lord jesus christ i believe amen that god has ordained amen god has arranged that amen that he might come in and deal with the needs of his believing children amen then you see what will happen when that happens is god will call a man on the pulpit amen see the prophet said now think of god in his mercy has the mother before the little baby is born it's craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speaks forth dad i want cantaloupe or watermelon i want something or another well he'll do everything he can amen to get that because he knows he wants his child born as perfect as it can be see and he'll do everything he can because he's able to do it to get it now the prophet there is speaking of a natural father who is desiring the birth of his natural child amen to be born as perfect as he can be then turns it and says now how much more able are speaking of god is he amen to get it for he's a creator amen see now think about that a woman carrying a child amen can wake up in the middle of the night and say honey i want some cantaloupe i want some watermelon hey man you know what he's got to do he's got to get up and he's either got to go to the refrigerator and find it he better go to the store and buy it he meant but a creator can say let there be cantaloupe amen or let there be watermelon see what he's showing you here is there is a difference between a natural father amen and your heavenly father and the faint tonight church that we have not gathered here amen under the jurisdiction of the natural father amen but we have gathered here under the leadership of our heavenly father and whatever you have need of tonight it's not beyond the power of creation amen i'll tell you what if you need something tonight from god and there's no way you can see it let me remind you he is still jehovah's ira amen let me remind you he can still speak things into existence whatever you have need of amen let's just go and knock that devil in the face here for a minute amen you say well i need something from god there's no way i can get it let me remind you who your father is he is a creator then how much more abler is he amen he's a creator now think now think here how able he is to prepare us a body to have to live like his own glorious body if we want to live see then there is something in us that calls to live and there is something in us that calls to do right then god will call somebody on the platform or in the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you're a real child of god then you begin to cry out god take it away from me and circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's prepared amen see you've got to be a real word bride of christ amen then to think tonight amen that a real child amen does not resist chastisement amen but a real child actually accepts it paul says in hebrews 11 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous amen but grievous amen but nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby in the of sin church age remember says here and now set forth amen the love of god he desired in love a family of his own amen a family of sons like himself there before him lies all mankind has one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels under honor and unto dishonor see the choosing will be his own choosing then then the chosen ones have been born of his spirits will be trained to conform to his image in their walk now think about this the heavenly father amen is actually going to choose you're not going to choose him amen but he's going to choose you amen and when he chooses you amen then because you're the chosen one what he's going to do is he's going to transform you amen into the image of their walk he says he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens amen with nail scarred hands now now no chastisement amen seems amen no chastisement amen seems joyous for the president amen but nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness see amen he's going to chasten you amen with nail scarred hands and sometimes this potter must take the vessel he's working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it see but it is love that is his love another way of his love thereby is not there cannot be amen now let me say it this way i believe amen that if you're the chosen of god amen and there's something about you in your life amen that god does not desire to be i believe that god being the potter himself amen will take us and will break us down amen until he breaks that thing out of us amen because there's nothing going to be in this bride amen accept the word amen there's not going to be feelings there's not going to be sin there's not going to be unbelief there's not going to be fears there's not going to be skepticism there's not going to be complexes this bride is going to be a word born bride she's going to be a word born bride now i believe with all my heart then that god amen right here tonight how many will agree with me is desiring to deal with hearts amen i believe god is desiring to deal with hearts i believe god is desiring to deal with lies you say well brother andrew there's nothing going to happen here with me amen there's no way god can deal with me the prophet said your faith don't have no hindrances i don't care where it's had what it is no matter who says not if god begins to deal with the human heart begins to pulsate in there that it's the truth and you find it to be the truth there's nothing going to keep you from jesus christ when god begins to deal with a human heart amen if they're a chosen one if they're a real child of god there's nothing going to hinder amen god from dealing with your heart amen now let me say this just as we believe that god amen desires to deal with our lives amen i also believe that god is desiring us amen to deal with things in our lives that don't belong there well brother andrew i've been in the message for 20 years i've been in the message for 30 years i don't care if you've been in the message five years amen every now and again we get some things in our lives that just simply don't belong there amen that don't mean you're backslidden it don't mean you're not revelated it don't mean you're not the pride amen it's just the age we're living in amen where things creep in amen we're habits come in amen where little things come in and they come in so innocent amen they come in so unnoticed amen but before long they're controlling you amen before long they're driving you amen before long your joy is gone amen before long your victory is gone but how about tonight amen we say the same holy ghost that filled the upper room amen would come in this building tonight and we'll light a stick of dynamite and would blow everything out of our hearts would blow everything out of our lives that don't belong there ain't been that the living god he might come and take possession of the church hey i believe god is desiring a clean bride amen i believe god desires a clean church amen let me say this if god desires it he's going to have it if god wants it he's going to get it amen if god said it's going to be there you can put everything you've got on it it's going to be there and then now when you say this term amen to deal with it how many how many believes god wants us to deal with some things amen if it's okay i'm just going to preach a little bit tonight and then to deal with it means to take measures amen concerning someone amen or something it means especially with the intention of making something right it means to confront an issue and to reach a resolve amen it means to quit playing with it it means to quit just just talking about it it means to get down to business and confront it it means to look it in the face amen and deal with it amen now that's what it means it means to bring an issue amen not to leave loose hands amen but to tie those loose ends together listen friends this message is not a message of loose sins it's not a message of this and that he meant a prophet come and found all the loose sins and he tied them together amen that a church would rise in the power of the resurrection of jesus christ and i think if the word don't have loose ends then let me say this word-born bride she ain't going to have loose ends either amen she's going to be tied together by the word and then to deal with something means to reach a resolve now in the year of 2010 amen a popular term was formed just deal with it that was that was the that was the term of the year 2010 was just deal with it amen now when they when they formed that popular term what they actually done was they totally changed amend the people's view of how to deal with something before when you said deal with it you had the intention of confronting something amen and getting it out in the open and then coming to a resolve amen but when they changed that the phrase deal with it is a bold self-assured declaration ordering someone to put up with something that they may object to or make to do with a challenging but ultimately manageable situation so instead of handling or facing or working out a situation people just say deal with it amen see which actually what they're saying is just put up with it amen what they're saying is don't take the gloves off and deal with it amen just let it be there it's a manageable situation amen i'm going to preach here for a minute amen because the world we live in says you just have to learn to deal with it you just have to learn how to put up with it amen and i'll say the reason why the world says that is because they've lost their backbone they've been they've lost they've lost the guts to stand against sin they've lost their guts to call black black and white white everything's a gray area amen but i believe in these last days there's going to be a pride that's going to rise up under the anointing of the word of the hour and she's going to put every devil amen under her feet oh now that's what the world says amen the world says just deal with it the world says just find a way to live with it amen let me set you like this amen then that same spirit has come in the church amen you say what are you talking about the prophet said this way he said and the world has come into the church in the name of denomination he said the name of some creed and we're religious and all this and all this but yet it denies the resurrecting power of christ he meant to vindicate his word that is prophesied for this day amen see there can only be a light through god through the word of god we know that god in the beginning said amen let there be light and there was light vindication of his word that he had spoken now to think about this of how that the world had that term amen just deal with it and they totally changed it to say just learn how to manage it just just find a way ain't meant to put up with it just just find a way that you can live with something amen now that that same devil comes over in the religious world amen and i'm going to preach here for a second the religious world is saying the same thing amen what they've done is they've dismissed divine healing amen so they teach that you need to learn to put up with sickness learn how to manage it learn how to deal with it amen the religious world has dismissed the power of god's deliverance amen so now they teach you there's no way to overcome that devil there's no way to rise above it you've just got to live with it you've got to learn to put up with those habits you've got to learn to deal with those besetting sins you've got to learn to manage those strongholds amen see what they've done the bible says they have denied the power thereof amen they've denied the power of god let me say if this message don't have the power to produce an overcoming life let's go find something that does amen if this message don't have the power to take a man and lift him above pornography and lift him above homosexuality if this message don't have the power and then to take a girl and lift her above hollywood fashion then let's go find something that does but may i announce to you here tonight there is nothing under the sun with more power than the message of the hour there is nothing with more power to overcome the devil than this message this message is the power of god to overcome the devil the prophet said then can you imagine a person amen having the holy ghost and denying part of god's word taken half of it say the other half is no good see so i believe a man ought to live a pretty good life but when we come to a time of thinking about divine healing and all this stuff like that and abstaining oh we have to do this and that don't believe in it the bible said that would come to pass having a form of godliness but deny the power thereof see the prophet said they deny half of his word and all of this power that's right yes certain they presume they got it amen now we've come here tonight that we might see your great power deliverance lord how it delivers the captive and sets them free and makes known to us the things it was which is and shall come see that's why every service you should be under expectation that the god that was is the god that he is is the god that will be and that god will come down in the church and he will manifest himself through the great power of deliverance now let me just preach here for a second amen because you've got to agree or you may not agree but it's the truth anyhow the world has replaced the power of the gospel with psychology paul says in second corinthians 4 4 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believed knowledge lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them now when you look at that word blinded it means to blunt the mental discernment it means to darken the mind now what that's saying is there's going to come a time where that where they're not going to be able to discern between what is right and what is wrong they're not going to be able to discern between what is truth and what is there amen so everything's going to be right amen nothing's going to be wrong amen every man's opinion is going to be right no man's going to be wrong amen but do you see where that comes from that came from the devil amen who has taken the glorious light of the gospel and is blind in the minds of some amen i don't know about you tonight church but i'm not blinded amen i'm not blind tonight god sent a message in this hour amen with some eyes have amen called the baptism of the holy ghost and the prophet said without the baptism of the holy ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word a man without the spirit is blind to god and his truth if you ain't got the holy ghost you're as blind as the man smoking a cigarette if you ain't got the holy ghost you're as blind as a local baptist preacher but if you've got the holy ghost tonight amen you've got eyes to sing you've got ears to hear you've got a heart to believe you've got a faith to reach out and say yes lord i believe oh the god of this evil age does not want our spiritual eyes to come open amen he don't want our eyes to come open to the reality that god is still a deliverer are you with me tonight he doesn't want our eyes to come open to the reality that god actually still delivers hey and i preach for a minute god actually still delivers that right there is enough to make you shout your shoe heels off amen god still delivers in an age when minds are bound in an age where strongholds have possessed the lives of young people in a time amen when the world is in such confusion when politics are falling apart when young boys don't know if they're boys and girls don't know if they're girls there is a power amen called the holy ghost that can set a man free it can set a young girl free and they can see who they are my god amen open our eyes tonight lord to the reality of your deliverance that's why paul would say in ephesians 1 18 that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of this calling what is the riches of his glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who believe according to the working of his mighty power now the prophet says i was a little boy in kentucky my brother and i slept in an attic on a strong palate the cracks of the house would let the would let the giraffes blow through he said sometimes in the winter it would get so cold we would wake up in the morning with such colds in our eyes that our eyes would be shut tight with inflammation we would cry out to mother and she would come up there with some hot grease and rub our eyes so the hardened matter was gone and then we could see he said and you know there have been some awful cold drafts blowing on the church in this generation and i'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she is blind to what god has for her see the devil don't care if you see what god's got for your pastor or the wand the devil don't care if you see what god's got for the evangelist or what god's got for brethren or what god's got for your mom or your daddy amen but he don't want you to see amen that the same god that's got something for them is the same god that's got something for you see that's that's the reality she needs some hot oil he says with the spirit of god amen to open her eyes unless she receives the spirit of god she will go on substituting program for power and creed for word she counts numbers for success rather than to look for fruit the doctors of theology have shut the door of faith and forbade all to enter they neither go in themselves nor let anyone else go in their theology comes out of a textbook on psychology written by some unbeliever there is a textbook on psychology one we all need it is the bible it is written by god and contains god's psychology you don't need any doctor to explain it to you receive you the holy spirit and led him to the explaining he wrote the book and he can tell you what is in it and what it means see then you find tonight we are living in a time of contrast right now we are living in a time of contrast you say what is a contrast a contrast is two opposites amen like this amen if there's a cold weather somewhere there's a hot weather somewhere else amen if there's a if there's a strong person then there's a weak person see what i'm saying there's a contrast amen and right here here's the contrast we are living in a time where the bible says it's a time of weakness but at the same time the same bible says it's a time of strength amen so there's one week amen and there's another strong there's one that's weak but there's another one that's strong living in the same world amen living in the same state amen come on church amen the bible says in isaiah 37 3 amen thus saith hezekiah this is a day of trouble and a rebuke and a blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth the children are come to the birth but there's no strength to bring forth you realize what that word strength means it means power it means might it means the power of god the prophet said when the church allowed herself amen to move away from the original like adam and eve death city and there is no strength in her when she left the original word and death come in and she lost her strength amen are you with me tonight when she left the original amen death come in amen so what's going to take death out is when she comes back to the original when she comes back to the original then see where we are tonight we are back to the original tree amen we've got the original word we've got the original spirit we've got the original life we've got the original god we've got the original holy ghost we've got the original seed oh come on church amen if we come back to the original then death is gone and life has come in oh weak pulpits though has taken the church from the original amen let me just preach it for a second the proud of god said weak pulpits produces weak churches see remember said she was standing there talking about a little girl she was standing up there poor little thing not old about 18 years old he said what's the trouble today we've got too many weak pulpits that's afraid to preach amen and to warn the people of things that's letting the church go just as softly and sloppy as it can be what's the matter it's because they've loved the things of the world more than they love the things of god and they gotta pervert it see not only that but our churches is crushed little old pulpit 65 preachers that stand up i ain't criticizing those certain ones he said but they stand up and it's a meal ticket it's an offering it's a popular name to get on television or on the air i wouldn't sell my birth right to jesus christ for all the televisions and popularity there is in the world no sir life means more than these nasty ungodly things i'd rather have favor with christ than to be the president of the world what a condition the world's got into amen now come on church we know the condition of the world we know tonight amen that men are marrying men we know tonight that women are marrying women we know tonight amen that that there's hate and there's division and there's there's all kinds of nonsense well we know that amen we're not going to change it but the devil's not going to leave it out there he wants to bring the same thing in the church you say number there you don't know what you're talking about oh yes i do he wants to bring the same spirits in the church well brother andrew don't you know this is a message church amen that little bit of sheetrock right there don't keep the devil out he'll come right through that are you hearing me amen amen well brother anywhere in the message that don't keep the devil out the prophet god would take time to preach an entire message called the invasion of the united states he says what is it it's the devil the invasion's on i ain't saying nothing about this individual or that individual i'm saying it's unclean spirits that are possessing the people it's unclean spirits that are possessing the people and that's driving them right into it they've been seen then it's not the individual driving their self into it but it's an unclean spirit that has possessed the individual and that unclean spirit has become the pilot of that individual's life but i have come here tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ i defy the devil i defy his works it's the hour of the church's deliverance it's the time for demons to lose their power it's the season for the anointing ain't meant to destroy the yoke upon the church in the last days yes sir what is it it's unclean spirits right so they're possessing the people and driving them right into it it's the invasion of the united states the overthrow of the church the devil's overthrowing the church he said the church is overthrowed by the devil direct quote now you realize the world is in its condition is it because it gave in the demons can i preach for a second the world is in the condition it's in the night because it gave in the demon powers hollywood is in the condition she's in tonight because she gave him the demon powers are you hearing me they gave in there was no power there was no strength to withstand them they just said well come on in amen now are you with me tonight amen amen even in our even in the message churches amen the power of people people losing the power to withstand things they mean years ago it was wrong to have televisions amen but now we got them used to be wrong for men well it used to be wrong for women to wear high-heeled shoes but now they're wearing them they mean used to be wrong to cut your hair but now they're trimming the ends they made used to be wrong for men to wear shorts but now they're are you seeing amen demon powers the lid has come off of hell and demon powers streams of them are coming around but there is a pride and it's going to withstand that devil there is a church that is going to stand up and say you may take the white house you may take hollywood you may take paris you may take london but you're not taking good separate church you're not taking my home you're not taking my child you're not taking my church in the name of jesus christ i draw the line satan and i defy you there is not a devil going to take control of this bride [Music] oh the world is in the condition of 10. amen now you say what are you talking about demons are enticing and tormenting spirits the problem of god said i want to speak on enticing spirits which has would really be titled demonology he said you hear so much about demons of these days but you hear so little about how to get rid of it you hear so much about demons demons are real amen by how you get rid of them well we'll see where we're at they say you can't get rid of them you got to live with them you can't overcome them you've got to live with them so what we're doing is we're making deals with the devil well we're all aware that there's devils he says but the next thing is how to get rid of that thing let me take a minute here and say there's still a possibility of getting rid of it whatever demon is tormenting you there's still a possibility of getting rid of it whatever devil is controlling your mind or still a possibility amen to destroy that pain whatever spirit is trying to destroy your home there is still a possibility of defeating that faith [Applause] oh yes sir you say how can you be so bold and say that because we are not ignorant of satan's devices paul said lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and the message i can overcome he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks that's the first step to overcoming the devil is recognizing the devil and every one of his tricks a lot of people says there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil amen he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real and you must know he's a devil amen how can i preach to you here's how we're going to get rid of him then the same time you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater is greater and mightier than he is that's the one in you has already overcome him are y'all hearing me if you've got the holy ghost tonight then the holy ghost in you has already overcome the devil before the devil ever come against you he owe the holy ghost didn't you already overcome him what are you saying i'm saying the only thing the holy ghost is doing now is claiming your body for another victory amen claiming your body for another testimony come on church the same god that god and david overcome goliath the same god that god and samson overcome the philistines the same god that was in shamgar overcame amen overcome 600 fists are y'all hearing me the same god that was in a body called jesus overcome the devil on the mountain and that same god is in you tonight by the baptism of the holy ghost empire are y'all hearing me then what was samson a trophy of grace what was david a trophy of grace what was moses a trophy of grace another body that god claimed possession of to overcome the devil through oh how many says devil you're a liar i'm gonna say devil you're defeated amen i recognize that devil and you're defeated amen i see you devil but you're defeated i hear you devil but you're defeated i hear you talking but you're defeated i hear you speaking but you're defeated you are a defeated foe [Music] oh then in numbers 33 i find it amazing brother on how that the lord comes and speaks to moses in numbers 33 he comes to moses and speaks to him concerning israel passing over into pain land and he says now what was canaan cainlan was the promised land in the message adoption he says now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it only represents the age of the overcomer it's the dispensation of overcoming because in canaan they killed in canaan they burned and took cities and there'll be no death in the millennium now brethren says and god talk to moses then when you say you're going to do anything you're going to accept your healing how many needs healing tonight how many of these deliverance tonight how many need something from god tonight all right how many will how many will go on record and let the devil see you raise your hand and say i accept it [Music] i accept it now this is what a prophet said he said how many let me say this how many needs the baptism of the holy ghost tonight when you say you're going to accept it he said that's when the devil flies on you with all four feet when you rise up and say i'm gonna accept it when you rise up and say i'm gonna take it when you rise up and say it's mine that's whenever devil raises up to try to stop you oh but church remember he couldn't stop moses and he couldn't stop david and he couldn't stop joshua and he couldn't stop rehab and he's not going to stop the bride of jesus christ she's going to take even possession of what god has given her in her inheritance yes sir that's when the devil flies on you with all four feet that's right now can i can i can i can i read your numbers 33 52 again i don't know if you can put it up here or not but in numbers 33 52 god speaks to moses and moses tells israel what god told him to tell them to do when you get over the land of canaan notice here verse 52 then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you notice this word drive it means to cease it means to dispossess it means to take possession of it means to inherit it means to disinherit it means to occupy it means to impoverish to be an heir come to poverty be poor to devour to destroy bring to ruin disinherit so moses is saying through the lord then ye shall dispossess ye shall cease ye shall ye shall bring to run you shall destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you and you shall destroy their pictures now look at what this word pictures means the word picture means show peace figure imagination image a car figure of idols can see amen a lot of us have got pictures that we need to destroy the devil has painted pictures of you that you need to destroy he's painted pictures of your future you need to destroy them things he's painted pictures of your family you need to destroy them things he's painted pictures of your church you need to destroy that thing can i preach amen destroy all their pictures can i go on and destroy all their molten images which that word molten means to pour in a libation of molten metal cast image drink offering metal molten gods it means a web direct quote or direct definition it means a web a covering a veil woven stuff you've got to destroy all the things that the web can i preach the way up the devil has created a meant to entangle you in you've got to destroy that thing [Music] come on church amen have we lost our ability to destroy the devil i say no sir we are more able tonight than we were two years ago we are well able tonight to destroy our enemies destroy their molten images and then he says quiet pluck down all their high places you know what that word pluck means exterminate be destroyed be exterminated to be annihilated to be devastated i'm trying to behave here tonight but are y'all hearing me god's telling them go in there and destroy your enemy it's your land go in there and kick out the images tear down the pictures destroy the molten images and pluck down the high places see god gave them the land but he instructs him to dispossess the land see notice here we have to dispossess in order to possess we've got to dispossess in order to possess when we get in the millennium there'll be no dispossessing there'll be no killing there'll be no burning there'll be no taking down cities that's why canaan was not a type of the millennium it was a type of the baptism of the holy ghost when you get the holy ghost is when the battle begins god is telling israel there's something you're going to have to deal with you're going to have to face them in it it's amazing brother juan god gives him the land he gives him a prophet to lead him to the land he tells them where the land is he puts the milk in the land he puts the honey in the land and he says now you go in there and destroy the enemy that will stop you from enjoying the land how can i preach to you for a minute amen because these were not church members these were prophets these were present day prophet followers they were following the vindicated prophet of the age they went out of egypt into the promised land can you imagine when moses comes and delivers numbers 33 messes to him and says destroy destroy this do you imagine when he gets done you imagine the devil got in there among them you imagine that devil got in and said now i just i'll just paraphrase here for a second maybe dramatize it you imagine one more devil was raised up no doubt israel heard moses and maybe one of them thought don't you think that's a little extreme you imagine brother one when moses got done preaching and he said destroy their images hey it quite plucked down their high places ain't imagine what moses got done maybe that old devil said don't you think that's a little extreme moses ain't not going a little bit too far or maybe maybe maybe just possibly oh eve's interpreter come around maybe eve's interpreter come around and begin to try to interpret moses's message to them maybe they went back to their tents and they were thinking about moses saying when we get in the land we gotta fight we gotta draw our shorts we got we got to have some bloodshed here we we got we got to tear these things down you imagine they got back their tents and here come on eve's interpreter and said listen listen you don't have to believe all that maybe brother juan he said surely we've heard that word before we surely maybe they were sitting there saying how are we going to destroy our enemies how are we going to do all this this is too much and oh eve's interpreter come by and said surely when we cross in the land we can all live peaceably together surely when we get in the land we can find a way to put up with the highlights surely when we get we can make a deal with the japanese and the amorites of the parasite surely we don't do that amen but but moses said but if you will not drive god said through moses if he will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which he let remain see those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your side and shall vet you in the land wherein you dwell i'm gonna preach to you for a second because a lot of people's been blaming everybody for their problems in reality it's your own fault you've been blaming the preacher you've been blaming mama you've been blaming your husband been blaming your wife blaming everybody but the reality of it is you let some things remain that needed to be destroyed [Applause] now that word remain means to be left over to remain over to leave to preserve alive to show preeminence so maybe when they went in there brother one they said now listen here amorites you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side amen and maybe they agreed that for a few days but then then a few days later hear that oh am rock come over and they saw their daughter acting like that amorite they saw their husband or their wife acting like that ambra and they said wait a minute i thought we made a deal here i thought you was going to stay on your side amen but here it goes to show anything you let remain the least bit of favor you show it it will take preeminence over you [Music] see you can't let it remain then he said that salvation in the land look at what this word vex means this word vex means to be bound that you shall be bound in the lantern you dwell it means to tie up it means to shut up it needs to be cramped it means to be in restraints it means to be pressed hard upon to show hostility toward to treat with enmity now think of this here god tells moses if you let him remain they're going to shut you up they're going to they're going to bind you up now can i preach to you for a second were they not vexed in egypt were they not beaten by task masters amen why then would they come out of egypt come out of egypt a land that wasn't theirs and come to the promised land and put up with things they could destroy testing one two testing one two they're still working why would they put up with things in the promised land that they could destroy what are you saying i'm saying this in egypt they had to put up with extras in egypt they had to put up with harassers in egypt they had to say okay we'll be we'll we'll live peacefully together amen but when you come in your own land when you come in the place that god ordained you to stand in and that old vexer raises his head before you would be hurt before you could be knocked down for hitting him but when he comes on your land are y'all with me tonight when he comes in your home when he raises his head in your church then you've got the power to rise up [Applause] you've got the power amen to rise up and destroy that victory oh what are you saying andrew i'm saying this amen i'm not wearing a straight jacket in the house of god can i preach here for a second i'm not wearing a straight jacket in the house of god i'm not wearing a restraint in the message of the hour well you know what are you talking about i'll tell you what i'm talking about amen amen if i wanted to wear a straight jacket in the pulpit i'd go to a baptist church if i wanted to wear a restraint behind the pulpit i'd go to a church of christ amen but god brought us out of that confusion god brought us out of that nonsense into the new land come on church are y'all hearing me amen oh god help me amen i think it's time to take the straight jackets off all right now let me let me try to make this a bit more simple for you okay as plain as i can in egypt they had straight jackets when it come to praising god when they wanted to raise their hands and sing and shout there was an old taskmaster there that would draw out his whip and say shut up and get back to work when they would want to praise god a little bit there was an old task master there who would come by and harass him and tell him you're making too much noise and you're being a little too pentecostal and you've got a little bit too much joy and he would shut them up and you know what because they was in a land that was not theirs they had to listen to him they had to obey him oh but when they got on the other side when they got in the promised land if they wanted to shout they could shout if they wanted to rejoice they could rejoice if they wanted to sing they could sing if they wanted to preach they could preach and if one devil if one devil raised his head and said you can't do that they would pry out their sword and say in the name of the lord i'll take your head off and i'll tell you what tonight church it's sword raw in time it's shore drawing time it's time to draw our swords it's time to stand as the mighty army of god and take our land oh what did he do separated us open to us a new land amen see the first husband has to be dead right see that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it invisible union you can't live with it you just can't say well i'll divorce him and hang him up here to another occasion no sir he says no riding a divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature now you say letter die amen god let it die that's a direct quote brother says invisible union now closing and saying this finishing up the great commission how could they do it we know they're dead god let it die in this sign to engage all of it so he could do what open up the seven seal mystery to the undenominational bride how can the denomination accept those seven seals when it's absolutely contrary to serpent seed and all other things the whole full seven mysteries is contrary to what they've been taught because they took the old school from their bible school they took the old school from their bible school amen but god let it die remember it says see remember the law never took them to the promised land joshua took them over grace not the law and neither will the denomination any denomination ever take the church of god over it'll be by the grace of god that shed abroad in our hearts by the baptism of the holy ghost that will take us to the promised land in the fullness of god's blessings certainly it is they make a fatal mistake what they do these things brother bram says it served its purpose very well but the time come when it wasn't good no more and god let it die out so he could take the grace so he could take grace and take them across and positionally place them into their places in the promised land come on church amen can i preach to you tonight what time is it a prophet said it's adoption time it's an option age this is an adoption message representing adoption is my birth that's contrary to what a prophet said he said your birth is not your option he said your adoption is your blessing amen then what does this message come to do it has come to place you it has come to establish you it has come to put you in a place where you're not putting up with the devil you're putting him under your feet can i just take a time out here for a second can i take a timeout let me tell you where the devil belongs he don't belong on your shoulder he don't belong in your head he don't belong on your he don't belong in your pocket he don't belong in your home he don't belong in your church he don't belong in your car let me tell you where he belongs he belongs under your feet [Music] [Applause] well brother i can't put the devil under my feet oh yes you can he belongs under your feet now brother andrew how can i do it you got to go in and destroy but you know what you can't just go in halfway destroy same god made the promise to israel made it to you and he's the same yesterday and forever sends the same signs wonders and miracles now he ain't gonna come just push it down you you're gonna have to take it you're gonna have to dispossess it you'll have to quit relying on the pastor to do everything for you mercy god quite there amen well brother brother juan i'll do it brother juan will do my praying brother one will do my studying brother i want to do my preaching brother want to do my victory brother wanted him over come and know you've got to do it yourself you've got to dis amen moses the prophet of god couldn't even do it for him they had to go in and do it themselves and the prophet said as soon as you claim it as soon as you claim it how many is going to claim it tonight how many is going to claim victory how many is going to claim healing how many is going to claim joy how many is going to claim lost loved ones how many is going to claim a revival how many is going to claim victory how many is going to claim the power of god how many is going to claim restoration how many is going to claim resurrection how many is going to claim a rapture the very minute you claim it there will stand an old amorite [Music] the very minute you say i'm going to take my land remember i said an amarillo stand there for the ender what do we do do we go there and say excuse me mr amarat how are you doing today you see behind you is my blessings behind you is my joy behind you is my peace but behind you is my my revival behind you mr amaritis is all the blessings of god but it's behind you and i'm i'm claiming it but but you're in my way mr amrit would you uh what what can we do to work this out what can we do can can we can we can we make a deal that if you let me go to one service a month i'll do a little bit better [Music] can we make a deal mr am right if you'll if you'll if you at least let me stay awake for 30 minutes of the sermon mr amorous can we please make a deal remember when that amrit stands up he said here's what you do kick him out of the way kick him out of the way [Applause] oh god says now wait a minute you're excited that's an old person now kick him out of the way if you now listen here he said kick that am right out of the way you imagine there's that big ol ammo right sister no standing between you and your blessings it ain't hard to kick him out of the way is it he's a big old he's a big old ugly amorite just just take your foot and kick him out of the way right ain't hard to do but the problem god said but notice how close it comes then you keep on going and you see a little baby amaranth and he says well and your mammy says well he's awful cute brother branham says he'll be like his daddy [Music] you kicked his daddy out of the way and he's sitting over in the corner but you remember if you let him live if you let him live you'll he'll be another one of his daddy so you continue out away and you kick the baby out right out of the way and you take your possession you take your land [Applause] the land belongs to you well the doctor said so and so can't pray such a pretty prayer that don't make any difference god give the promise if the unbelievers against god's word kick it out of the way [Music] i know this is simple but i pray it's helping you tonight whatever standing between you and the promises of god can get out of the way hey kick it out of the way we'll brother enter the devil kick him out of the way well brother andrew it's it's it's innocent pretty probably god said don't care how innocent and pretty it looks might have staples and shrines and say aw man like a dying cat but that don't change god's word the promise is ours the same peter of fire that led the children of israel through that wilderness and went with him to the promised land here he is with us tonight even had his picture taken with us all over and over showing the same signs and wonders yes so what joshua was telling them was he was saying either you'll deal with it now in its infancy or it will deal with you later in its maturity praise the lord now can i have a little liberty here tonight the protagonist says let me say this my friend you better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you but brother andrew it's just a spirit but spirits are real can i let you in a little secret and time doesn't change spirits it only gives them time to grow and mature [Music] you say what are you talking about i'll talk like this you take a you take it you take a young boy that's got it's a high passion young boy and he can't keep his hands off girls running girls all the time and he gets up to be about a 40 50 year old man he got that same spirit on him still chasing women still chasing girls can't live with one wife then you let him get about 75 80 years old put him in a nurse at home and that same spirit on him he'll be flirting and flirting carrying over the nurses right pulling it there pulling at their closet why because the spirit didn't die it only matured over time are y'all hearing me see the spirit that that man should have destroyed he put and said well we'll we'll make an agreement okay i'll i'll leave you alone but but he should have destroyed it amen now i know it may get a little tight here but that's okay because i'm prepared for it to get tired because friends we're at rapture time we're at the coming of the lord literally the coming lord is knocking at the door of the church the world is falling apart do you realize end time prophecies are falling in place as we speak it's time to destroy these things amen i don't know how long i'm supposed to preach but if i can have a few more minutes in luke 8 26 the bible says they arrived at the country the gatherings which is over in galilee and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils a long time and where no clothes neither a boat in any house but in the tombs and when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes he caught him and he was kept he was kept bound with chains and fetters and he broke the bands and was driven out of the devil and was driven out was driven of the devil into the wilderness see the devil unclean spirits possessing people driving them drove this man into the wilderness and jesus said what is that name he said legion because many devils are entered in him notice here and they besought him then he would not command them to go in the deep there was a herd of many swan now you know the story he cast them out and they win the swine that comes along and says oh there is one blessed thing you can't go to him but he can come to you and he has never at any time failed one day now in the land of gadara no doubt a sociable god-fearing citizen once lived and he got out with the wrong crowd first thing and maybe just married and had two or three little kitties but he got mixed up in the wrong group and there's where many a young man and young woman loses out getting mixed up in the wrong group the wrong associates and so one night they take him out and give him a drink go play a little game or do this or gamble a little bit it won't hurt then the first devil entered into him see unclean spirits the first devil entered into him he went home and had to tell his wife a lie see then the second devil entered into him and until he was possessed amen are you with me i'm not going to preach all night but he was possessed with a legion and he got beyond any help and the poor little fellow was drove out in the tombs did you ever notice the devil likes to dwell in the tombs the devil stays around an old dead place and he says and that don't exclude churches either when they get colder it's a devil's hangout [Music] now just imagine for a minute when he got mixed up with the wrong with the wrong group and maybe he took that first drink you know maybe maybe after he took it something said oh that was so wrong he felt conviction god i shouldn't have done that god i'm sorry maybe that conviction maybe that conviction wrote him all the way home and he got home and opened the door and nursed to his wife and said where you been and he lied to her conviction come but maybe that time it wasn't as strong as he did the first time see little by little it got easier until the maniac of gadara had an opportunity to deal with those spirits but instead spirits began to accumulate the prophet said this way jesus said unto him come out of him that's right you unclean spirit now look the devil had a good home church direct coat so he didn't want to leave that country it was a good hangout he liked to hang out around there so he had him a good home place settled down so he just didn't want to leave the place and that's the way the devil that's the way with devils whenever they once gets settled down when they come in they're not hard to deal with when they get settled down he says amongst a bunch of people they don't want to leave oh they're stubborn say now i don't believe in such things as my healing i don't believe in that kind of stuff sure not that's the devil making you do that but can i show you something can i show you something it got easier for him and what's not dealt with in one generation goes to the next that's right like brother bram says here one media remember brother brown come home and the phone rang right the phone came the phone rang ram told her said who is it she said it's the lawyer he said tell him i'm not home remember he said tell him i'm not home and said i stepped outside and he said didn't mean he told him and she had to lie and everybody said then i come back in i went to pray for that baby and he said the spirit of god fell upon me and said you lied remember that yeah number one tells this total deliverance he said that afternoon i went to pray for a sick baby and before i left the house this is after me and it's done her what what he had her do he said before i left the house the phone rang again and my little joseph run over and took a hold of the phone and said daddy do you want me to tell him you're not here see how quick he said you see how sin corrupts what a family that would finally be [Music] had brother branham not dealt with it what a family that would have been had jesus not found the maniac of godair and commanded them demons to go out of him what a family that would have been you say what are you preaching that preacher i'll tell you what i'm preaching i'm saying this you've got to serve eviction notice tonight is the night to serve eviction notice on the devil neither give place that word place means room quarter license any portion space district village opportunity power occasion fractal neither give place to the devil don't think sitting there in the wheelchair that you're hoping to help us you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind that's right but don't let it stop like the old farmer said i can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun and said i can sure keep him from roosting you do the same thing don't let them roost don't let them devils have time to settle down you say that why are you saying this because what you don't deal with just builds up like revelation 18 1 and everything said after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lighted with his glory and he cried madly with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and it's become the habitation which the word habitation is abode has become the abode of devils has become the house of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird now revelation 17 says the mystery babylon the mother of harlots mother is the the daughters are the harlots now notice here now this is now the discovery of her mystery and her children's mystery what's she allowed to accumulate are y'all following me come down into harlot dalton he said see looking after the mystery was made known who she was what she was who her daughters was the mystery made known then god sent an angel messenger to what call come out the message of the hour the message of the hour came to uncover and deal with our lives can i say it like this god dealt with israel he did yeah but there were some things israel didn't deal with that came back but andrew what are you saying i'm saying right here in this meeting tonight you have a choice that's right right here in this meeting tonight you have a choice you say my you slow down a lot yeah i did because i believe the spirit of the lord's here tonight and i think sometimes we can shout conviction right out the door that's okay to say it that way just start shouting and shouting and shouting and forgetting there's some things we need to deal with i believe it shall not do it all the time but either you'll deal with it now or you'll continue to sweep it under the rug and let it build up and build up and build up but i say to you tonight the time is at hand to deal with it the time is at hand tonight to expose that devil you have got the authority tonight by the almighty god to serve eviction notice on the devil you know how you serve an eviction notice you go in brother and say get out get out yeah you've been living here but go find you another place to live kick that devil out the devil says but how am i going to get home i wrote here in your car i don't know find another way home but you ain't riding home with me time to go time to deal with it time to destroy them things god gave us space to repent yes the bible there says i gave her a space to repent of her fornication and she repented not see that word space means time season wow time either long or short i gave her time to repent i give her time to change one's mind to repent to change one's mind for better to hardly to amend with the abhorrence of one's past sins to to to repent of it but andrew i don't want i don't like repentance preaching while repentance is the key that unlocks the door of revival you say blender i i don't know if i i don't know if we can deal with these things we can tonight and you know what i know this may be different but i trust it's okay you know what we can we can suppress things but let me tell you can only suppress him so long you can only push him down so long the prophet said you know this church was actually more wicked speaking the catholic church than they have do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before god you can't say that at the roman catholic church no sir she has never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now god kept raising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of god and they did everything they could to bring the church back to god god certainly gave her opportunity and helped to repent did she ever repent and how she did by her first fruit by her fruits no sir she never has she never will she is drunk he says she has lost her senses in spiritual things now don't be confused to start thinking that the church of rome has repented of her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the protestants by making her creeds line up with protestant creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will yet rise up to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepented heart preacher what are you saying i'm saying you don't destroy a tree by destroying you destroy your tree by destroying the root the life of it you destroy a spirit by destroying the root of it paul said lester didn't root at any time the root of bitterness bringing up trouble you how many can say tonight lord i hear you speaking to me i hear you tonight lord there there's some things that that i need to deal with there's some there's some yeah i was in the meat one time and got the power of god i got the nerve up enough to kick that ammo right out of the way but i looked over and i saw that little cute baby and i said no way and now that baby's matured into his dad and things i thought i had victory over they're right back here in front of me tonight brother i must be beyond help i must be beyond grace no i come to k i come to tell you tonight kick it out of the way you love him tonight as our musicians come it's time to deal with it it's not time to learn how to it's not terminal it's not time to learn how to put up with it it's time to destroy it there's a pastor over in ohio you some of you may know me pastor the church that pastors the church there he was telling us testimony one time about how he years ago he moved i think he shared this testimony with several brothers so i'm sure you don't mind me sharing it but it's talking about how he moved into a or he moved into pastor in there and he had had some converts coming to the church and one one day they asked him said said preacher said we got some problems in our home so when we bought this home said we we went in and said there was there was demons in the home that was demon spirits i think they had practiced witchcraft or something in the house before so there was demons there and he said so they asked me to come over and he said i believe if it goes correctly their little girl was having just just having fits out of nowhere she'd just break out and fit just break out screaming and crying and carrying on and they could not figure out what was going on so brother juan the pastor went over there one day and he goes in and he said hey he said said that got some issues here and they said yes and our daughter she she just breaks out in these fits so we don't we don't we can't figure it out so the only thing we can think of is there was there was a this there was witchcraft practice in this house years ago and said when we moved in said doors would just open up on their own literally the door would just open up for the one just nobody in there the the bedroom door just opened wide open then it shut on its own it was a demon listen friends demons are real [Music] and the parents said you know what to make a long story short the parents said you know what we did we went in there and said now demon if you'll leave us alone we'll leave you alone brother told me he said man i thought what in the world have i got myself into he said what they did was they made a deal with that demon and he said they let that demon stay in the house and they thought they were controlling it and come to find out that demon was tormenting that child in the middle of the night listen friends we are the church of the living god we are the bride of jesus christ we are the most powerful force of people on the face of the earth tonight you the people i'm looking at tonight with the baptism of the holy ghost is more powerful than the press of the united states of america the people i'm looking at tonight has got more authority do you realize you realize how powerful you are remember you can speak the world into existence and go live on it if we can speak a world into existence and go live on it but can't we go in our homes and say devil get out devil get out of my mind won't you stand your feet with us this evening how many says lord i hear you tonight i've been living with these things too long tonight lord tonight lord give me the courage lord give me the grace tonight lord to kick these things out kick them out of my hole kick them out of my mind kick them out of my family kick them out of my church these spirits have been they've been they've been they've been getting settled down but it's time for them to go probably god said when a church gets cold it becomes the devil's hangout prophet said you know you did you know how big a root out yes sir we used to take a grubbing hole and just get down at it dig it till there wasn't a speck left in it and he said if there'd be any root of bitterness bring it up into you grub her out that's right that's what the holy spirit does roots out all the bitterness church we've been gentle with the devil long enough jesus said the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and violence take it by force now friends i'm not trying to be rough but you can't baby devils he said that's right you've got to let them know who's boss and we're boss now because jesus is here our big brother our brother of redemption is here hallelujah when you really realize that god has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you're absolutely undefeatable not you but god that's in you not not christ

[Music] as they just play that softly i know it's getting laid but the spirit of the lord just brings this testimony on my heart to share with you tonight if that'd be okay [Music] a few years ago i was over in new zealand went there for some meetings a youth camp and family camp there and we got there and we had a sunday morning service scheduled and that saturday the church there had some plans to go out and do an outreach in the community so they went out and they were singing some songs and there was a young lady she got up and she was singing the song there was power in the name of jesus then she began to sing a song he's a waymaker miracle worker while she was singing that song there were people walking by and she just stopped and she got the microphone and she said she said i'd like to testify to everybody walking by here see i just like to tell y'all the god i'm singing about said i know him personally she said i was a little girl and he come to me and he met me and he changed my life she said i always eat up with bitterness i said i was full of it said my mom and dad are divorced and all kinds of things that happened said i was full of bitterness said but but god rich and mercy come and touch my life now now take it that was on a that was on a saturday night in a fellowship at a fellowship meeting now if you'll go with me to the next week we're in a meeting there and there's a there's a song by the window martin sings called devil we're through the devil it's over and on the way the meeting that night i just i just had it on my heart to play that song the spirit of the lord actually met me that day when i was studying and praying for the meeting let's pray the lord come by and i was looking for something praying for something to minister on and the spirit of god just come by my heart just said relax i sent you here i sent you here just relax brother there was a peace come over my heart so on the way to church that night i was listening that song devil it's over devil were through and when i got there i said brother we need to play this song tonight he said i don't have a chord to play it on your phone for about 20 minutes there was young people running to their dorms trying to find a cord to play that song devil it's over devil we're through you've had your chance to make something out of my life but tonight devil it's over there was there was about about 15 people went and got the records that didn't work and the brother told me so well he said i i know you feel like this song's gotta be played he said but there ain't no chords here to play it off your phone and we can't download it he said how we gonna play it i said well i don't know about that time there was a young girl she came over she said i think i've got a chord here for your phone if you wanted to play the song right before i went to pulpit they plugged that chord into it played that song that that that girl had the chord to play that song in time for me to go to the pulpit well i was preaching by the one i was preaching on i was actually preaching along the lines of reality facing reality and i said you know what young people i said god will ordain this entire meeting right here he will have this entire youth camp for one individual for one individual to face the devil and get the victory over him about the time i said that man that the power of god was roaring to the building people were shouting rejoicing about the time i said that the power went out in the building every light went out in the building pitch black well they had a generator there that kicked on and kept the microphone going so i just kept on preaching in the dark just preaching right away and i come down the end of service and the spirit of the lord was just moving and there was about about three or four people who's motioned for me to come over there and there was a girl in there she was just screaming and squalling she was screaming out and i got over and i realized what it was it was a demon it was a demonic manifestation and i knelt down by her and that she was just laying there and it was just a demon i mean it was something you can't even dramatize she was screaming out and i was praying i said lord and it come to me just as clear as then i sent you here i said lord in the name of jesus christ we take control over this thing for the glory of god when i said that brother juan she she that i won't say hurry what hurt it was a demon that demon raised up and he just looked at me and he said i won't leave i just bowed my head and i said satan in the name of jesus christ you've got to leave i said the lord jesus christ sent me here to preach his word and god is my witness that devil raised up in that girl and said what word what word well brother there was a bible land there in the floor and there was a sister laying there next to her i said sister would you take that bible out there laying on that girl's body i said pick that bible up and lay it on that girl's body and brother one when she laid that bible on there i said in the name of the lord jesus christ that wrote this word sent me here to preach this word and i cast you out the name of jesus christ and the girl rose up got up off the floor demon left her it was gone it was over you know what about that time [Applause] [Music] about that time the lights come back on the lights come back on and when i looked at sister when i looked at that girl in the face you know what i realized it was the girl that had the chord to play that song it was that girl had the chord to play that song but the one she jumped up she began to scream devil it's over devil we're through she just began to rejoice she began to praise god the holy ghost just wave after a wave of the glory of god she was just rejoicing brother i was watching her she was shouting about that time she kicked her shoes off she said my god deserves a real praise she said i'm free of this thing i've been liberated of this thing my brother sister i'll be honest with you okay it was that same girl that testified in that meeting over there that previous saturday about what god had done for her was the same girl that had that chord to play that song was the same girl that demon manifested itself in was the same girl that demon left now when you got an 18-hour ride home on a plane you got a lot of time to think right so on the way home i was thinking i was praying thinking about the meetings praying for the people and it just began to ponder in my mind brother juan how could that girl be possessed like that how did that happen just just praying about it lord how did that happen and i was sitting at home and i sit in my office i was getting a preacher at the church at home i sit in my office they're listening to a tape and brother come down the end of the tape he said now in the name of jesus christ he said i command every devil to take your hands off of god's property did y'all hear me he said take your hands off of god's property and brother juan when he said that it was like it was just like something happened to me i just jumped up i said right there's the answer i went back played it again to make sure i heard it right you know what he said sis he said i command every devil to take your hands off of god's property i said right there it is he never one time said i command every devil to take your hands off and let them become god's property but they were god's property before the devil ever put his hands on them therefore he could serve eviction notice and say take your hands off of god's property and i say to not church you was god's property before the devil laid one filthy hand on you and in the name of jesus christ i command the devil to take his hands off of god's property in the name of jesus for the glory of god take your hands off of god's property you're the sons of god you're the daughters of god you've been bought with the price you've been redeemed by the blood of jesus christ you are the bride of jesus christ hallelujah as our brother comes tonight worship the lord with this brother i told you [Music] praise the lord amen amen amen amen amen thank you jesus thank you father thank you lord thank you jesus we want to thank the lord for his presence tonight we want to thank the lord for just coming into our midst tonight going behind his word and coming to meet us at the very point of our need i believe that god spoke to you tonight just like he did to me praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord i mean this atmosphere is just right tonight and i believe that before this coming thursday we can find something to thank god for not just keeping us safe from the coronavirus we can thank him for that but we can find something out of this service tonight to make a thanksgiving offering to god that god will come and speak to you that god will come and identify things in your life he will come and call your name we can find something from this service tonight to be thankful for what are we sitting at our homes with our family following the service tonight we can find something of this service tonight we can find something from the voice of god from the message that's been preached tonight to make a thanksgiving offering unto the lord amen like i would rather share reading from brother branham there we're living in such a time where people are lost in interest in spiritual things there is no way that we can there is no price we can put to this service tonight it looks like a few people here tonight it looks like uh the the the song didn't go right it looks like uh uh uh uh you know what and everything from the beginning of the service but there is no prize that we can put to what the holy spirit has done in this service tonight praise the lord amen there is no prize and that's what i want us to do one more time while the musician played we were by our heads tonight and i mean the holy spirit the spirit of the law was all over the place he was just calling out in different direction helping us to be able to identify things in our lives bringing us to the place for us to narrow down and be able to deliver things in our life this is not to walk you through but just for you for us to just have a meditation you see at a certain time of the service the holy spirit just changed everything instead of preaching brother andrew was just talking and he says it looks like you think i've melody and i know what it is because we could scream we could clap our hands we could praise god and and and sometimes and many times people does that thing honor a religious spirit when the world is coming to bring a conviction to deal with that thing we get excited we try to be emotional with thanking god but we're not really getting to the place to realize that lord thank you thank you for dealing dealing with this thank you father for speaking to me this way thank you lord for calling out this thing in my life thank you lord for calling out this thing father it's because you have given me power it's because you have given me the strength and you want me to deal with it now father god to put up with elbow you want me to get rid of it you want me to kick this thing out of my life that's why you caught it out tonight i'm not just going to be excited that it was a good service but lord i'm
