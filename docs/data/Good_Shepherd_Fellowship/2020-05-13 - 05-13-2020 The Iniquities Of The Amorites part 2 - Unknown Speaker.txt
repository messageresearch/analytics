to prayer just wanted to mention that I was listening in on the governor's announcement at 6:00 p.m. tonight and I don't get into politics but I certainly want to try to keep up on what he's mentioning about the Cova and staying home and and he announces this evening that that the staying home orders will end at midnight on Sunday nights all starting Monday the stadia will not stay at home anymore but of course make sure that you go on there take a look at some of the good advice that they're giving and I know that he talked about you know I had having no more than 10 people gathering together but that's a lot more than what we've had so far so amen so we're grateful for that and we certainly should be on the top of our list to pray for that to ask our Lord who's a merciful God to you put that Satan in his place amen stop him in his tracks amen so I don't know what you have on your heart tonight but you know the Lord does know the scripture says that he knows even before we ask what we have need of and so but yet you think about blind bartimaeus and how that he started crying out and then Jesus came to him and yet he still turned to Bartimaeus he says you know what asked him what his desire was even though it was very clear that of what was his need but yet he so he still asks us to to actually let him know what our needs are he says cast every care on him for he cares for you so let's go right to prayer this evening you have an unspoken request let the Lord know lineup of did am heavenly father first of all or do you want to just pray O Lord against this demon called the coronavirus Lord Satan you're defeated enemy and Lord Jesus we pray God that you'd put Satan in his place Lord and stop him in his tracks and we ask it in Jesus Christ's name father we just want to pray for any unspoken requests and it beyond the scenes hearts tonight Lord you know everyone Oh Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord Jesus you said that if to even touch and agree is touching anything it shall be done to them so father Lord whether it be physical mental emotional spiritual financial whatever our needs are tonight Lord Jesus will lift all of those up to

of law we thank you we glorify your Holy Name bless us together now as we approach your word in Jesus wonderful name we pray Amy Amy praise the Lord praise the Lord amen let's just turn to our Bibles I want to go back and sister fade I will maybe name this or tie to this a part two of the iniquity of the AMA writes there's a principle a biblical principle that I saw while I was studying the subject and and and and their biblical principle kanafeh bring out this subject in a way that brought Branham torrid true through the through the message you know Bourbon talks about the the the iniquity of the a mirage nap in for wish of course that was what God to Abraham in Genesis chapter 15 he see was so John and before they come back to to inherit Elaine the the iniquity of the amorite who fall but then when the Prophet brought it over and and was comparing the true the the church ages into our time that we are living in there is there is something that he you know that he said and that's what I want for us to look at tonight that's what I want for us to look I want for us to look at that principle - now let just an honorable feed we will read a word let's take Georges chapter 11 George's chapter 11 judges chapter 11 we will read from verse 19 judges chapter 11 now last week when we spoke on this last wee Wednesday we read numbers 21 21 this is just a repeat of numbers 21 21 but it brought us something that I want to use this evening as my inspiration numbers I mean I mean sorry George is 11 verse 19 and his recent messenger on to see on King of the ammonites the king of his brawn and Israel said unto Him let us pass we pray thee through the lane into my place now I want for us to look at that is really saying we want to pass through your lane into my place they have not got that yet but based on the promise that God has given them they are claiming the promise what an expression of faith I want for us to keep there also but see whom trusted not Israel to pass through his course but see on gather all his people together and page to Jay Haas and fought it and fought against Israel now watch this and the Lord God of Israel delivers in him and all his people into the hand of Israel and they smote him so Israel possess all the land of the amorite their inhabitants of that country and okay let me read them a little bit and they possess all the cause of the amur rights from Amon - Jabar and from the witness even onto Jordan now this is the principle I want for us to dwell on tonight so now the Lord God of Israel have dispossessed the amorite from before his people Israel and ensure that there possess it praise the Lord I want us to do er tonight on their principle of God this dispossessing they a mirage let's pray together father we have read your sacral wording and we want to just commit this evening in your hands and father we pray that Lord you would come and you will help us Lord as we approach this subject tonight bless your word now we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen praising Lorna and Matthew chapter 13 Matthew chapter 13 I want us to look at their principle in the New Testament Matthew chapter 13 because when when brother Branham talks about the a variety he he placed them in a place of of the denomination churches he placed them in a place of the church that comes before the church that has the revival Israel was the one that the had a revival they were moving on in the promises of God and and they were telling the people we just want to pass through we go into our place we know that we go into our place and for us the blood of Jesus Christ where we are going is to the Millennium amen we are going to the Millennium that's where we are going we going into a rapture onto the millennium and that's what we are going but this principle holds in a way that trust that law will be able to bless us tonight to be able to bring it out so we can see it now listen to Matthew chapter 13 also look a few Scripture than we get into into the world tonight praise the Lord Jesus year in his parable let's read them from verse 10 and the disciple came and said unto Him what speak up down unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is giving unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not giving then wash it now for whatsoever half for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but whatsoever have not from him shall be taken away even that he has this this is a been something they had you know what I was I was I was studying I came from looking at different coming trade it was I mean it was just a lot of presentation out there awright awright Lee couldn't come in light of what I thought brother Branham said about this scripture you know so yeah Jesus laying our principles telling the disciples that he preached in parables because all to them was giving the mystery of the kingdom and then he brings this parable is saying in the world that will help us to understand you know our position year of being dispossessed for whatsoever half to him shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but we also ever have net from him shall be taken away even there he say Luke chapter 18 verse 18 brings it out another way let's look at that then we can be able to it's pretty much the same salut chapter 8 in Luke chapter 8 verse 18 let's read from verse 16 less than year jesus said no man when he have light a candle cover it with a vessel or port it under the bed but set it on the candlestick that they wish enter in may see the light for nothing a secret there shall not be made manifest neither anything here that shall not be known and come abroad take heed therefore how ye year for whatsoever half to him shall be given and we so ever have not from him shall he shall be taken even that which he seems to have now Jesus in Matthew chapter 13 he used that in the parable talking about the mysteries of the kingdom but here also in the same light of the scripture it comes even to our personal life life which is a life but Branham says tell how your kind of God lighted now so the principle year is there there when God is dealing with the people that's the group of people they have because it's what he gave when God is dealing wave a people or God is dealing with an individual it's grace unto you whether God is dealing with you in your prayer life or God is open to the word as you are reading the word more easy sometimes and when when the Lord is blessing us with his presence we think that all we are on the housetop you know no but I'm so revving like like it is the grace of God to you now a we don't God that presence if we don't Kindle stick light and he move on to the next group like in the church ages as a revival when he moved on to the next group like in this age and the time that we're living in he's dealing with the bride now so media in the principal as we will look at it with the amma rights he dispossessed he dispossessed the amorite able to bless israel his people in their own lane and the same thing comes over in the church ages and all the blessings that came in a Pentecostal revival god when he moved in the nest age he moved with that blessing over in the bride age like when he left from luther revival he moved with that blessing over to the Wesleyan revival when he moved from the Wesleyan revival he moved with that blessing and then so what happened in in this principle is that the people that are having the revival are the people that God is dealing with and the people that has rejected the revival has been dispossessed so what happened it caused a Connor jealousy it create a kind of jealousy because when brother Branham talks about the iniquity of the ammiraju we also have to notice he placed there to the time of the squeeze because what Pentecostals saw in their revival the the manifestation of the gifts their healing when that time comes and the bride comes to the place were she's manifesting the world they are going to get jealous now let me bring another type of that might help us there in Babylon there was down here in his three friends Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when was was made on two down here in the image that was worshipped we realized that there are other Israelites Durham Babylon they felt like Daniel and his friends were proving to be more spiritual they were trying to prove you know what we are here I mean this is not our lane in a way that there is no temple here for us to wash it what is the big thing you know that the trumpet is blown everybody come up we know there's a false god you know but I mean there is no temple here for us to wash it but this young man Danny and his friends they have purpose in their heart that they are not going to bow down to any graven image now so because of the extent there are other Jews got jealous and what it says you think that you know better than us you people think they are traveiing God is so a real in your maze and God is not in our maze now so this is the principle that we might dwell on a little bit as we as we go along I pray that the law will be able to help us as we bring it out together praise the Lord amen let's look in Genesis chapter 4 we spoke from Genesis this gone son is speaking on the mother of all living I got home and I was thinking about it I remember where Paul says in the book of Galatians that we we are from Jerusalem the mother of all and that Jerusalem types the bride because that's how the new city is going to come down the New Jerusalem is coming down like a bride adorned for her husband so so the bride just like we are talking about this the bride opposition that she is now in earth she stands as the mother of all living why because she has the blood it's her presence that is keeping the earth when God takes his church away there will be complete darkness if we think that we have seen the age being that is going to be black but with the presence of the bride on the earth she's the mother of all living because she's holding life on the earth now she's holding the mercy of God on the earth praise the Lord Genesis chapter 4 there's another principal year now you keep that at the back of your mind you know that God this possess the amorite and then he gave the inheritance to his people now you have to know that he is the Lord God of the earth he owns the universe he owns the land and when he gave us a place for us to stand we have to appreciate it if he gave us faith for us to stand for the world we have to appreciate it we don't have to use it to think that we are better than other people on the earth because when God dispossessed you like he did to Nebuchadnezzar's seven years he went like a beasts God gave him you know the the grace to go down there to Babel and capture the people because it was in fulfillment of his word and he thought he did it but when God dispossessed him he was down like a beast so that is the principle that is the principle God used in every age when a lute when a Lutheran revival or the Luther revival came you know what God blessed him but when he was moving because they refused to go all with a move of God God dispossessed him they still with the a denomination and a revived move on and Wesley and his people that web less because now they are having the fire that came over from the first revival it's now here with them the same thing when the Pentecostal revival came doors they saw the Pentecostal revival and when the godly and everything's those that refused to go they were dispossessed because God moves I mean the holy spirit move with the revival and when God dispossessed you you just deal with a form I'm in a message I believe the Prophet which you will just tell with a form but you will not have the life the life is the inheritance the life of the word is our inheritance our inheritance is not a physical land is not a physical inheritance it's a spiritual inheritance the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring us the talking life to give us victory in such a time of discouragement that's our inheritance so let's look here in Genesis chapter 4 the scripture says in and Adam knew his wife verse 1 and she conceived and bare King and said I have gotten a man from the Lord he said I receive from the Lord King was the firstborn son of the earth by Nature he was supposed to be the one that inherited earth if we take it honor the lord of the breath right if we take it honor the law of the breath right he was supposed to inherit the earth but what happened when it came down to the time word that will bring Russia and sacrifice to God either got the revelation even move with what what God was doing in that day and King got stuck to his form of religion and God said King do as your brother he refused to move on with God so what happened he was dispossessed go now give him a mag to go as a vagabond in the earth and that place of king of being the one to inherit the earth the firstborn of the earth was now giving to set because what king kill Abel God would have given it to Abel because he got the revelation he was the one I was ready to walk with God because he got the revelation that it was blood he was ready to walk with God because God will only walk with a man that is associated with the blood because with a blood there is no forgiveness of sin God kuna even associate with his parents with our blood God has to provide a blood and life - even associated with his parent so even got that revelation and God was going to move with him God was going to bless him the blessing is now in where our position is in the earth the blessing is in the world the blessing is not in what whatever church wearing whatever church name we gave the blessing is in the promised word of the hour so God dispossessed him and gave the blessing on to said 'who's replace Abel Genesis 425 that's what the scripture says let's look at either and Jacob you will see the same principle of being dispossessed either was the firstborn but because he played down the birthright because he played down the breath right he had no respect on to the breath right so he was dispossessed now even when it came to the time of the blessing Isaac said I have given all to Jacob he said father is there nothing for me as I said I've given all why he was this possess God give the blessing to the man that respected the principle the principle of his word because the principle in that there was the breath right it matters a whole lot God says separate the firstborn he said I saved the firstborn and I save your firstborn in the land of Egypt and slid the first ball of the Egypt and because all the firstborn belongs to me so the principle of the first bomb the principle of the birthright was something that was very important to God no matter how jacob appreciate god bless him because he was more interested in the breath right so is our dispossessed praise the Lord now let's let's read this where BAM says here believe in God the scripture says by one spirit we are baptized into the body oh yeah it looks like I didn't send that to you okay really sorry I won't spirit we are all baptized into one body that's what the scripture says but being baptized into one body we have to realize that you know the Holy Spirit want to you know I mean he want to flow through us he wants who he want to kind of use of last night I was having no I was having a Bible study Wilbur bread last night and and at a church and there's there's something that we were looking at I was very beautiful we were looking at grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you a seal onto the day of your Redemption and we're paul also say in a book of Thessalonians quench not the spirit here's the beauty that is in the two because there were three things that we were steady Galilee and he spoke to the gallery and he says don't frustrate the grace of God so we were studying on frustrating the grace of God grieving the Holy Spirit and quenching the spirit so we have already there with frustrating the grace of God and so as we were looking at this we were reading and and and that their promise over in a book of efficient is actually says that grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye I see on to the day of your Redemption but we will realize here we are still in him when God seal us he seal us in him onto the front until the redemption of our body because Paul says our life is hid in Christ now but when it comes to quenching the spirit it is worth God want to flow through us so what what we were steady naturally I was trying to show him in a scripture is that if we take our security from in Christ and bring our security in the name of a church because I'm in this church because I'm in this system so I'm going to heaven no is because we are in Christ our names are placed on the Lombok of life before the foundation of the world that's where our security is so there are things that God placed in Christ for us and there are things that go want to do through us so it's when we stand in a way of God using us to be be a blessing like we read a discourse your brother Branham says believe in God he says and I know this there are some of us have more faith than others and those who have abundance of faith as supposed to pray for doors but if you don't live the right kind of a life you better leave away from it the devil will laugh at your prayers but when you live right and do right and outright and have faith in God sit on with tremble when you speak he will tremble when you speak cause God's were on the obligation he would take care of that prayer so we can we I mean we we can pray we can i mean shouting and and try to rebuke the devil and everything but if there is something in our life where bellum says the devil would just laugh at your prayer but when their life of Christ is flowing through us and we are being submitted to the word he said God is honor obligation to to take your prayers and move on your behalf so that is the principle year of you know the iniquity of the Amorite because God was bringing his people back told their inheritance in every age go hard and inheritance for the people and that's the reason why when brother Branham spoke in the message that we've been playing there and about the tape the tear pool and the things that were happening that is the bride' inheritance the opening of the word and that word is supposed to expose us to the life of Christ it's supposed to give a faith in the hour of need especially in such a time that we are living in with supposed to have an attitude of faith a very taught of faith Lord birdbrain says something just listing its way when I I got in now praise the Lord now so we have to watch there because just as it was in in in the principal of the church ages it's the same thing that God he do to the life of the believer now let me give you an example in brother branham's life verbatim says when he when he saw he went to Mishawaka and saw the Pentecostal revival he saw the move of God there and what God was doing him he said he knew that was the thing that he's been longing for even though when he he saw the vision of those two men he could not I mean you couldn't understand it but he just knew there was something in the mists of those people now see what happened when brother Branham came back and I mean he wanted to take his wife bearing and and yeah you know and the mother-in-law didn't want him to go there the prophet of God says when he listened to dare and he never took his wife there he said when all of those things happened to him hope gone his Sharon was gone he said it took him almost about six months why because God was dealing with him God was about to expose him to another place of his ministry that's what he was called for but because he refused to step into death for a wine in that period of time the Prophet actually actually actually talked about it I mean he was still preaching but he did not have I mean the vision the way that God was dealing with him God was not dealing with he said six months went by it was almost like he was in a desert he was drying because we are supposed to move walk in the light as it unfold as God open our understanding and God is dealing with our heart let's step by faith we don't have to understand it we have to believe that he's in control sometimes we try to hold back and and we want to understand everything you know before we take that step of faith we're been said is listening to this in the message peffer faith he says now faith is based on forgiveness then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to see where we could really see apostolic time moving among us the time that we are living in there it is pretty much the same time almost described in the book of Acts when the church was on a persecution they were moving from house to house breaking bread because I mean a God was dealing with the imbalances we are trying to position ourselves because we are longing to see apostolic time moving among us he says that's what we are all hungry for amen praise the Lord I'm telling you since if we will go back to that building I just said I mean this is I've been praying I said Lord we're going to go back oh and formula that works you'll never finish it's better let us say in our homes what does the name for God to give us a place for us to gather if we are not going to honor his name if we are not going to step up and embrace what he's doing in this hour if we are not going to make ourself available and said lawyer I am used me for your service I want to be a better Christian I want to be a better son of God a better daughter of God a better husband a better wife if we're now going to avail ourselves like that then it's better let you stay in our homes because the purpose that God established the tabernacle right from Exeter is for him to come down and dwell among us like Paul says where when unbelievers come in our mess he was saying surely God is among these people it is not only for us to read it in the Bible it should be happening in our mess verbum says we are all that is what we are hungry for he says and it just lying right at the door we have it at dawn with all of these things that the Lord has done in this prophet messenger ministry that we have read we have a right at the door if we would just take the right attitude remember the scripture there in Matthew because iniquity shall abound the love of many will wash comb bring it right into this principle when people start tolerating things that they should not tolerate God dispossessed you he takes that law he takes their feminists away from your heart because the tenancy with the human the human body is there when we get to a place of comfort we relax we relax we feel so satisfied and that was the principle through all the church ages when the people recognized the move of God see all this is hit and then they relax and starts to organize and then when God starts to move he would not leave his glory back here he goes with his glory when he left the look that the looter revival he went with his glory that was the same thing in in in in the book of 1st Samuel the glory departed because God moved he left the old principle of Eli in his songs I mean all the other things that were doing in the tabernacle the glory of God left and when a glory of God left what happened Eli's son died LFL of the true he broke his neck is just death in the organization that's what bourbon show through or all the church ages when the glory of God moved the people died they just see in a form we are Methodist we are Baptist we are literally just tea in that place where the glory has gone because God dispossessed him he was going to dis possess the he was going to dis possess the the amur eyes and gave that blessing to his people so what he wanted was for the cup of the amorite to be filled and how did it come it came to the place word see where Ezra said Israel never came fighting against him it's a please Allah or surpass and because they wanted to stop the move of God they wanted to stop God people from going over just like Paul says not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are sick and they're the money when we don't discern the lost body when we don't discern what God is doing in our miss when we don't discern what God is doing in our whole life a first-rate the grace of God principal because it comes up over and over over and over even in our own individual life we comes to a place and God is giving us grace he's giving us victory it's so easy for us to relax and think that oh yeah now we are we I mean now we have the Holy Ghost and now and then we realize and as soon as we relax we start tolerating things that we should not tolerate and then before you realize there is no time to pray there is no desire for the word because when somebody called this scripture you know the next verse that follow it so you don't have time again to go in the word and real estate in the world praise the Lord brother branham talks about this he says remember Jesus reading from peffer faith he said Jesus as we hide in a lesson this morning he never used his power for himself now let me go back here what he's talking about apostolic time moving among us he says that's what we are all hungry for and is just lying at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it such a flow that it will that we want a social flow that it will be a help to us as flow out to others praise Lord we pass in the touch you know we are lighting one another candid as we go by he says remember Jesus never use his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for and that's the reason why I says we are not a reservoir for the Holy Ghost we are just a China for a to flow true God then I gave you the Holy Ghost for yourself he gave you the whole ego for someone that is in need around you and you think sometimes while who a man that was so full of power like him Jesus he says who have ever be sick member bentam comes into this year he read the scripture what the Bible say he bought our infirmities bad means to pack him see he bought and he had all things like we had he has sickness he had temptation he had trouble he had frustration just as we have because he had to be the right hand of a mediator so he had to partake the husband man of the fruit before before he will know praise the Lord to bring this bring this part out here in this in this iniquity of the AMA rights so we can be able to see it you know because as we talked about the iniquity of the amorite you really go into the study in order all the codes out there where Branham talks about the time of of the squeeze he talks about you know when the union is put together you know and and we close our churches he says and and why would they do that is because we will be standing for the life of Jesus Christ on the earth he says they will stop us from even praying for the sake because we we don't have a word council of church membership you know so why would they do that because they will be thinking there just like in the book of Acts you know those Pharisees why were they raising a man like Paul and autumn man to go and stop them from preaching why were they doing it because they realized that these people were talking about a living Christ I mean they were raising up a man that sat down at a gate of beautiful did everybody that the priests and all the people that went to that synagogues knew this man from the day he was born and they come right there to the temple and said silver and gold we have not and but what we have we give to you in the name of the Lord Jesus so pretty soon they were realizing we have to stop these people as chapter 16 the God right there and a year is this man making money out of the sickness of this woman and poor comes with administrative divine healing he's not coming to make money out of the sickness of the person he's coming to pray for them for them to be here so all of those things raise the Sanhedrin Council to be that that is that is that is in in the form of spiritual jealous say that brother Branham says lead to slavery he said because there were jurors after the gift of a Joseph that's what led him to slavery but what happened God dispossessed him Jesus says to them behalf he gave more why because they are in the revival they have recognized the hour that they are living in they have recognized their day in his message he gave them more and to them that don't have the scripture said he even takes what they had so you understand the principle is a principle of how God worked through the ages because he did the same thing in the life of Israel because all these nations were trying to stop them God move on their behalf dispossessed them and give their inheritance give their blessing over to the children of Israel and so that's the same thing the same Holy Ghost that brought the Pentecostal revival on Azusa Street is the same Holy Ghost we have tonight they had just moved in a higher form of a relationship with the people bringing us to the fullness of the inheritance but because the Pentecostal revival decided to organize on speaking the tongue is the evidence said we are satisfied we're going to stay here God said okay I would this possess you take the blessing and I would give it to the endtime bride so you see we're supposed to be having gifts in the church because all comes with the blessing that he has given us - perfect interpretation of the word of god praise the Lord just like we talk about the churches is the same thing even in our individual life and in our home life we have to observe and watch the way that God is dealing with us because when you become try and selfish with the gift of God he would dis possess you and he would go a season dry God want for you to be happy glorified testifying about what he's doing in your life and III mean that now being shot is it's not your own making this now your own it's now your own life it's what God is doing in your life testified about his goodness we cannot say that all this time I mean we've been home from one another God has not been doing things in our life and we would come to service that was not even and not of things someone would not even send a text message and said all brother Scott praise the Lord the Lord was good to me and I was not feeling well what is happening what do we want to see God doing he's already doing what he's supposed to do he's keeping us in good health he's blessing us with his presence and we must take the attitude to testify of his goodness because if net he dispossessed you you go over dry you go through a dry season we all have been there our baby I have been there I mean there are times you just read you read a message you stay there I mean you stare and you stare that you study and you're waiting on God to just come down and bless the table that is on your heart so you can be a blessing to the people and you just dry and you know what dryness dot it for straights so when you see the preacher just frustrating he's shouting other people all over the place sometimes it's because of that praise the Lord what you see is a beautiful principle because the Lord wants whatever he gave to us we give it out he took the five love of bread now little boy launched he lifted up he bless him and he breaks he gave it to the disciple the handed-down and the more they were hindering it down the quicker they were giving it Jesus was putting it in their hands and five love of bread was able to feed 5,000 people because if they were figuring out in the our mind oh this one I get this person but there will not be enough no Jesus limit on he breaks it he gave it to the disciples were just supposed to give it along give it they were just supposed to give it along the Bible says five times the main was about a women and the children and then they were also tore basket talk to her basket loss they were remaining or to a basket it took her from the remnant that were on the ground why because the disciples were just giving it out and that's how we supposed to be that's how we supposed to be oh praise the Lord you know what I read in the Word of God today of who it was just so beautiful that scripture I read this morning was just wonderful all of those things the Bell faith when we can talk about the little things that he's doing in our life the little light he's opening to our eyes there is no way we're going to fall a step into this / FF faith if we don't take the attitude now like brother Branham says faith is based on forgiveness that is the foundation and he's saying this in a message perfect faith now faith is based on forgiveness that is the very foundation because you read the scripture if you don't forgive your heavenly Father will not forgive you he won't forgive your trespasses how are we going to have this attitude for a faith to change our body afraid to be able to step into a rapture afraid to walk with God in such a time there's no time to hold any bitterness in any indifference in our hearts we must be able to pour it out before the Lord click on that positive attitude because we have to realize that expectation like I've said over and over is the bearing ground for the supernatural when we are expecting God then he comes on the scene whenever you are expecting him you provoke him to move transloading and when you are expecting someone you know you made you made the room clean you face all the cheese you clean the plate because you are expecting and that's the kind of attitude that we need to have that's the reason why there are many people around it says well the thing we saw in brother branham message we can see it all I mean I mean people just asking question that I just asked a question is because you know we came to a place where we got so relaxed we took a tight and put it on our chest we are the bride and we were not doing the thing that the bride's supposed to do doing the thing that the bride supposed to do brother Albert Brennaman since when when when Rebecca realized when she realized the Elysa was a stranger she went out there get to the well he had never told her anything just thinking in his mind he just got from his knees and said Lord the woman that would come out here and give me water and give my canvas water to drink that was a mature woman because she had some muscles to be able to pull water and feed those cameras that drink a lot like that I mean it's just our attitude he want us working you know he want us working if we're not talking to someone let's be praying for somebody nate I'm a net you know trying to to throw down what God is doing let's build up our most holy faith like Paul says because we are in such a time we have we are approaching our inheritance he dispossessed came because he rejected he rejected the Word of God he rejected the revelation of the hour it was blood that was a revelation and God told him go back because he rejected God dispossessing he became a vagabond something that should have been his inheritance because he was the first son of the earth God dispossessed either because he downplayed the birthright you downplayed the birthright but you want the blessing you don't want the Holy Ghost but you want joy is the Holy Ghost that brings joy you don't want the Holy Ghost but you want happiness is the Holy Ghost that brings happiness is the Holy Ghost that bring peace is the holy ghost that brings healing and you can play down the holy ghost and then get the blessing I hope who you you were able to follow me tonight and grab that principle God did it in the church ages I mean he also do it in the life of the believers if we don't pay attention to what he's doing he moved on praise the Lord if God you see that in a community of believers you were here oh I had that burden you know if God putting the burden on your heart and you are so busy to do that he will move on and give another person the burden he will put the burden on another person his heart and that person will come up in and start testifying all whoa you know the Lord gave me the burden to do this or the burden to pray for this person he said oh yeah I had that birdie oh yeah you know you had the burden but you did nothing about it we have to realize in the principle there and in Genesis chapter one every day there was something for the Lord God to do and it was good in his eyes so every day there was something that a Lord girl want to do in our lives in our home in our assembling and he's looking for men and women that are making himself available people that our honor expectation let's go to the Lord in prayer this evening no matter how with all the restriction even if they lock us in our homes and say we shouldn't go out if the Lord God wants something to do he put that burden on your heart he would give you an instruction on how to do it crashes the measure of glory Weber Bram says he want to unfold himself to us he want to deal with our hearts he said we get so busy we we you know we allowed you know whatever different things he call he talks about family life he talks about our work life he talks about different things when God want to really reveal himself for us to the place where he can be able fill my cup slow let's just sing there tonight I leave a comment with the testing of my soul read off me know yes Michael [Music] yeah yes my I live it up [Music] come back with space-tastic all by soul red [Music] yes like um and make me think about Niemeyer's now if our hair is bad God was dealing with Lee Myers hot for the building of the temple the building of the walls of Jerusalem God was dealing with his heart he never said this to anybody but the expression on his face the humbleness on his face the quietness of his spirit even the king who realize that no God is dealing with this man he didn't know what it is he didn't know but he just knew there was something there was something because Niemeyer's was not in all the conspiracy theory there and what is happening in Jerusalem I guess there was conspiracy theory in those days he was not into all the news in all the argument there was a burden on his heart for the rebuilding of the wall and that burden was making him humble before the Lord humble when God is dealing with a man's life the prophet of God said that's what I would do it will make you humble regardless dealing with you and you can see it and you can recognize it it will make you humbled you will not walk out I said know it all you be very careful you'll be very prayerful you will walk humbly before the Lord where Baron says that promise is right before the door we can have an apostolic fake breaking us on on us in this hour with everything that is going on it's not going to take praying for the sake away from the church because the scripture says we will pray for the sake and they shall be healed [Music] there was a gentleman we were praying for this morning it was a co-worker to sister Colson steered in hospital and the doctors just called the wife to go and see him over at a Regional Hospital and the real call him for her to go and say goodbye to her husband we pray this morning and we've been remembering him in prayer and we just believe that God God have now finished with him God can turn the plate around that's the hour that we are living in that is the hour that we are living in where Benham says even if we pray for 10 person and they all die during this time it's not it's going to build our faith more it's not going to weaken our faith is going to bring us more closer to God but we need to rise up to that faith is not a mental work of it's an attitude that is affecting our life we are keeping ourselves humble before God we are watching what God is doing it is not honest and a mentor a sight man it is not just an emotional work of it is the thing that is affecting our life it is where God is bringing us in this time and then in a new order that is coming upon a word and and I mean in a nude approach and all of these things that is happening know God want to affect our life he's bringing us to our place he's bringing us to our hour oh I'm telling you to be living in such a time with our or in our Lyme is frustrating to be living in such a time where you can I get a nod from the Holy Spirit where you cannot get an inspiration from God where you can I get a burden to pray it is frustrating because there is no church life church life used to be a covering where we can get together and sing we can rub arms with one another and that we can listen to the choir singing we don't have that so if we can I get a nudge from God if we cannot get an inspiration of the Holy Spirit upon our heart if we can I get a burden to pray for somebody just a burden to stay before God and just weed and say Lord yeah and be with my brothers and sisters just like we're Brenham share we read here he says I know this that some of us has more faith than others and those that have a bonding of faith are supposed to pray for those that don't have that's what the tear poo is for actually brother branham shade is for the weak ones it's for the ones that can grab it there's a people that God is raising up in this hour just like Esther to stand in a gap we are just like Hannah we are seeing the the filling of the church system we want God to raise up a ministry we want to move of God and when little Samuel came on the scene the glory of God departed God dispossessed Eli and give that blessing to Samir father lived in our life to you tonight we want more of you we want more of you Father dear Lord we want more of your grace in our life father if the bride stains as the mother of all living if we are the one that has the blood of Jesus Christ if we are the one that is controlling like the moon control the tides of the sea wishes the type of judgment it holds back the tsunami it holds back the water from running over the lane and that's where the bride's things our position is to hold the wrath of God until that last Gillett comes in our position is to hold back the wrath of God until our loved ones I said if that is the place that we are in the place that you have caused us to be the father we put ourselves before you tonight and say Lord may you help us O God may you help us Oh father grab our focus in the right place brother branham in the preview of the bride he said she was walking she started stepping out of line because her focus she was looking at that other group and we are looking in the wrong places we are looking in the wrong places let's live for our heads our Redemption Drori night let's lift our hands up onto the hills from welcoming our help if there is ever a time where we need to trust God now mentally but just trust him trusting whatever you are dealing with you need to trust God we need to get ahold of him just like Jacob day [Music] he had a brief ride he had a blessing oh but there was something more he needed he needed a God of the blessing to become rear to him his father Isaac has bless him he went over god bless his hand God prosper him in the land that there with his
