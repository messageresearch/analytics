[43:46] out of it and but
[43:51] uh uh it came on my heart this afternoon
[43:54] so let's just look into it and and trust
[43:57] that the Lord will add his Blessing to
[44:00] it tonight praise the Lord in John
[44:04] chapter 12 we read from verse
[44:06] one watch this now watch this we we we
[44:11] have been
[44:12] instructed by the Holy Spirit to pay
[44:14] attention when we are reading the word
[44:22] amen the scripture says then Jesus six
[44:26] days
[44:28] six days
[44:30] before the
[44:32] Passover praise the Lord amen six days
[44:36] before the
[44:37] Passover and he was the
[44:40] Passover uh lamb amen six days before
[44:44] the
[44:47] Passover where Lazar Lazaro was which
[44:51] had been dead whom he had raised from
[44:54] the
[44:54] dead there they made him a supper and M
[44:59] but Lazarus was one of them that sat at
[45:02] the table with him
[45:05] Jesus then took
[45:07] Merit a p of uh of anointment of uh spil
[45:15] very costly and anointed the feet of
[45:18] Jesus and wept his feet with her head
[45:23] and the house was filled with the order
[45:26] of the anoint men then said one of his
[45:30] disciple Judas ascar Simon son we should
[45:34] betray him wow they put everything here
[45:37] all his
[45:39] credentials amen his birth certificate
[45:42] is here his credential is year Simon son
[45:46] we should betray
[45:48] him why was not this
[45:52] uh ointment sorry ointment I kept saying
[45:55] anointment ointment why was not this
[45:58] ointment sold for 300 pennies and given
[46:01] to the
[46:02] poor this he said not that he cared for
[46:06] the poor but because he was a
[46:11] thief and had the
[46:13] bag and bear what was put in it so does
[46:18] that mean he was stealing some of the
[46:21] money well we don't know
[46:28] then said Jesus let her
[46:30] alone against the day of my
[46:35] burial have she kept
[46:38] this for the
[46:40] [Music]
[46:41] poor always ye have with you but me ye
[46:46] have not
[46:48] always much people of the Jews therefore
[46:51] knew that he was
[46:53] there and they came n for Jesus sake on
[46:58] it but that they might see Lazarus also
[47:02] whom he had raised from the dead but the
[47:06] chief priests consulted that they might
[47:09] put Lazarus also to
[47:12] death because that by
[47:16] reason of him many of the Jews went away
[47:20] and believed on Jesus praise the
[47:23] Lord amen
[47:28] then verse 12 say and on on the next day
[47:31] much people that will come to the feast
[47:35] so that's the Passover is referring to
[47:37] so this took place one day before the
[47:40] Passover praise the Lord let's pray
[47:44] together father we uh want to thank you
[47:47] again Lord that we have the opportunity
[47:49] to read a portion of your word father
[47:53] God which is very important very
[47:55] important Heaven and Earth Earth will
[47:57] pass away your word will not pass away
[48:00] you told us your word is settled in
[48:02] heaven precious Lord we have
[48:05] uh what we have oh God but it's a word
[48:08] that is already set to establish oh god
[48:11] father so we just pray that Lord you
[48:13] will break a portion to us tonight
[48:15] something oh God we can Fellowship
[48:17] around something that will be said oh
[48:19] God to draw us closer to you and Lord
[48:22] God go in the direction tonight and I
[48:24] just pray that father the Holy Spirit we
[48:27] capture us our mind he he would just
[48:29] bring us to the place that he want us to
[48:31] pay attention to so we ask that you take
[48:34] complete control tonight in the name of
[48:36] the Lord Jesus Christ father I also want
[48:39] to thank you Lord God for brother
[48:41] Ezekiel little son D here that had a uh
[48:45] a surgery sometime this week removing a
[48:48] tumor oh God that he was suffering from
[48:51] we want to thank you and we pray that
[48:53] God you would bring healing to the young
[48:55] man oh Father I pray for their family as
[48:58] well our dear brothers sister s the
[49:00] children we commit them into your hands
[49:03] and we ask that Lord God you would just
[49:05] you'll be with them you will help them
[49:07] we thank you Father Lord and we just
[49:09] commit all things in your hands now in
[49:12] Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord
[49:16] bless you you may have your seat praise
[49:18] the
[49:19] Lord amen the Lord bless you you may
[49:22] have your seat
[49:27] praise the Lord now so when you look in
[49:30] the scripture here this uh this account
[49:33] of uh of the woman uh uh uh watching
[49:37] Jesus feet with her tears and uh uh
[49:41] anointing
[49:43] him uh you will see that uh there
[49:48] are two different accounts now sometimes
[49:52] to be able to understand uh uh because
[49:57] some of the SCS in the Bible look
[50:01] alike it's almost like Matthew chapter
[50:04] 24 in Luke chapter
[50:07] 24 if you study those two chapters
[50:11] closely you will realize there is there
[50:15] is one verse that shows the
[50:20] difference praise the Lord one of the
[50:23] verse uh uh make us to know that Jesus
[50:27] you know uh his disciple took him on top
[50:31] of the mountain and show him you know
[50:34] the mountain where he said that not one
[50:36] stone will be left upon another praise
[50:39] the Lord but then in the Luke account
[50:44] Jesus has just finished
[50:46] teaching in the synagogues when he
[50:49] stepped out and then he started
[50:52] repeating the same thing he said to them
[50:55] on top of the mountain now if you
[50:57] remember when we did the LA's
[50:59] prayer when you read the account it
[51:02] looks like Matthew gave his account and
[51:05] Luke gave his account of the Lord's
[51:07] Prayer but when you look at the setting
[51:09] of the scripture you will realize it's
[51:12] two different
[51:14] account praise the Lord it is the same
[51:17] with this with this uh uh uh story that
[51:20] we have just read of this
[51:22] woman that uh uh this woman that you
[51:27] know uh wash jesus' feet year the Bible
[51:31] make us to know it's mered but if you
[51:34] look through the other account it's not
[51:37] really it's not really said you know her
[51:40] name is not called a certain woman the
[51:42] Bible call but uh uh if you look in the
[51:46] Luke account Luke account uh uh tells
[51:52] us that it was it was in uh uh Simon
[51:58] house praise the Lord so it was these
[52:02] Pharisees that sent Jesus sent for Jesus
[52:06] to come to this place so Luke account
[52:09] make us to know that it was in Salon
[52:11] house here in uh uh uh Matthew I mean
[52:15] John account this was in the house of
[52:19] Lazarus and his
[52:22] sisters praise the Lord now whether it
[52:26] was was married that was the same in
[52:30] Luke
[52:31] account and she's the same one repeating
[52:35] this in join account we are yet to know
[52:39] in most in most places uh uh uh you know
[52:43] is is uh it's been said that it was
[52:47] married and uh and you know we can we
[52:49] can just go through all the scripture we
[52:51] not we're not trying but I'm just only
[52:54] trying to to help us to see tonight that
[52:58] sometimes in reading the scripture if
[53:00] you just look this look at the setting
[53:03] you realize that is different from the
[53:05] other accounts that that you have
[53:08] read sometimes it's just one thing that
[53:11] makes the
[53:12] difference in as much as it looks like
[53:15] the SC because the gospel have it have
[53:19] repetition because every one of them was
[53:22] giving their account of uh their time
[53:25] with Jesus so it you know the the
[53:28] stories are are the same praise the Lord
[53:32] but that's not what we are looking at uh
[53:35] tonight what we want to look at
[53:38] tonight uh uh goes back to uh it goes
[53:44] back to uh uh uh a
[53:52] prophecy
[53:54] o my my my
[53:58] are you ready to travel with me
[54:00] tonight praise the Lord it goes back to
[54:04] to a
[54:05] prophecy that uh that had to do with
[54:09] Daniel 70
[54:11] week okay I want to bring that I want to
[54:15] bring us from that place and use there
[54:19] to kind of for lay lay a foundation here
[54:23] if I can get through this that would be
[54:25] beautiful praise the Lord so let's let's
[54:27] go back to Daniel 7
[54:30] week I mean the Book of Daniel sorry I
[54:32] said Daniel 7 week let's go into the
[54:35] Book of Daniel tonight
[54:40] uh Daniel chapter 9 verse
[54:46] 24 Daniel chapter 9 verse
[54:53] 24 now Daniel chapter 9 verse 25 for
[54:57] will give us uh uh uh an idea on uh
[55:03] uh everything that is prophesied to
[55:06] happen within the 7th
[55:09] week everything that is prophesied to
[55:12] happen within the 70 week I'm I'm really
[55:16] believing the Lord to to be able to
[55:19] drive this in the place that uh uh it
[55:23] will not go into much of a teaching
[55:26] tonight but uh I don't know I don't have
[55:29] the
[55:31] staring you have it so verse 24 says
[55:35] yeah 70 week are determined upon thy
[55:38] people and upon the holy
[55:41] city to finish the
[55:44] transgression and to make an end of
[55:47] sin and to
[55:50] reconcile and to make reconciliation for
[55:54] iniquity and to bring
[55:57] in Everlasting
[56:00] righteousness and to seal up the visions
[56:04] and
[56:06] prophecy and to anoint the most
[56:11] holy praise the Lord are we
[56:15] together amen now so uh uh when the
[56:19] angel Gabriel came down to
[56:22] Daniel uh uh this was this was what he
[56:26] mention to Daniel making Daniel to know
[56:29] you know that God uh uh you know Daniel
[56:32] was praying in concerning his people and
[56:35] uh you know and uh the Prince of Persia
[56:38] was fighting against his prayer and and
[56:41] uh when the angel Gabriel bro broke
[56:42] through the angel told
[56:45] him that uh uh this is a time
[56:49] period This is a time period that is set
[56:53] for the people now you remember when we
[56:56] ever ever read this couple of weeks back
[56:58] we make you to know that uh the 70 week
[57:01] is not 70 days
[57:04] week we have 70 days week when a person
[57:09] says 70 week we can count them uh uh uh
[57:13] seven days in a week four week in a
[57:15] month you know but the Jews have weeks
[57:19] of years weeks of months weeks of weeks
[57:23] and weeks of days so so uh uh this was
[57:28] actually talking about weeks of
[57:30] years now so uh uh the angel is letting
[57:35] uh uh Daniel to know that uh 70 weeks of
[57:41] years is determined upon your people and
[57:44] in this period of time these are the
[57:47] things that are going to happen praise
[57:50] the Lord amen these are the things that
[57:53] are going to happen the things that are
[57:55] going going to happen is that uh uh um
[58:02] transgression will be finished the the
[58:04] and to make the end of sins and and to
[58:07] reconcile make reconciliation of the
[58:10] iniquity uh uh and to bring Everlasting
[58:14] righteousness to seal up the vision and
[58:16] prophecy and to anoint the most holy and
[58:20] he went on and says know therefore and
[58:23] understand there from the GL forth of
[58:26] the Commandment to restor and to build
[58:30] Jerusalem which of course that uh uh we
[58:33] know that uh sarus was the one that uh
[58:37] you know uh uh was was prophesied by
[58:41] Isaiah he will be the Sant that will
[58:43] give them this instruction so from the
[58:46] from that going forth the 70 week now
[58:49] all of this from the going forth of that
[58:53] commandment onto maiah the prince
[58:58] shall be seven weeks in the 7th week
[59:03] from that time where uh uh uh uh sarus
[59:08] who gave the the Commandment for them to
[59:11] go and and deal to the time of mesiah
[59:15] which is Jesus Christ that will be seven
[59:18] weeks are we together
[59:22] Amen to maiah is going to be S weeks and
[59:26] uh uh three school and two
[59:30] weeks the street shall be built again
[59:33] the walls even in Troublesome time
[59:36] that's the time of neemias you know or
[59:39] the time of Ezra and all of that so
[59:42] that's that's not uh our whole study is
[59:45] not around uh
[59:48] uh uh the 70 week tonight but what what
[59:52] what attract me to this is
[59:56] in this
[59:59] prophecy there was a
[1:00:01] promise
[1:00:03] that the most holy will be
[1:00:08] anointed praise the Lord amen amen that
[1:00:13] in the period in this period of time
[1:00:16] that after the time of uh transgression
[1:00:19] Everlasting righteousness sealing up the
[1:00:22] the vision and prophecy the most holy
[1:00:27] will be
[1:00:29] anointed now so I was I was I was uh uh
[1:00:34] thinking about this story of the woman
[1:00:37] that that anoint uh uh our lord Jesus
[1:00:40] now you think about it now think about
[1:00:43] it because there's a reason why in in uh
[1:00:46] in uh Matthew uh I mean in St John Jesus
[1:00:51] told uh
[1:00:54] uh Judas uh L her you have the poor with
[1:00:58] you but she's doing this for my
[1:01:02] burier why
[1:01:04] because right after his burial he's
[1:01:08] going to enter into his priesthood
[1:01:14] Ministry are we
[1:01:16] together why
[1:01:19] Jesus was on the earth he identified
[1:01:22] himself under the son of man right which
[1:01:27] is a
[1:01:29] prophet so he was he was under a
[1:01:32] prophetic
[1:01:35] Ministry are we together amen but he had
[1:01:40] another Ministry which was the
[1:01:45] priesthood and as and as a priest I call
[1:01:49] into Leviticus we look into it before
[1:01:53] the priest goes into
[1:01:56] the holy place to offer sacrifice he has
[1:02:00] to wash his hands and wash his feet and
[1:02:03] be anointed for that
[1:02:06] service are you seeing the picture here
[1:02:10] so Jesus is saying that it's strange
[1:02:14] enough when you look at this you read
[1:02:16] down the Bible says in verse 10 but the
[1:02:19] chief
[1:02:21] priest consulted that they might put
[1:02:25] Lazarus to death so all of these people
[1:02:27] came they all came to see lazarra that
[1:02:30] was raised you know the high priest they
[1:02:32] all sent their their counil men you know
[1:02:35] they all dress up and behave like
[1:02:37] friends that were coming for dinner that
[1:02:39] night but you see they came to see
[1:02:41] really is he alive because we got to
[1:02:44] kill that guy we got to destroy the
[1:02:46] evidence praise the Lord they wanted to
[1:02:50] destroy the
[1:02:52] evidence but here said there the uh in
[1:02:56] the midst of
[1:02:58] that Amen in the midst of that the
[1:03:01] Leviticus order the levitical order was
[1:03:05] there the priest needed to be prepared
[1:03:08] and in some other preparation for the
[1:03:11] priest to go behind the
[1:03:14] veil to be able to offer the sacrifice
[1:03:17] to take the blood from from uh uh uh uh
[1:03:21] uh The Altar and take it behind the veil
[1:03:24] and and and present it on on behalf of
[1:03:26] the people this Spirit has to be
[1:03:29] anointed for
[1:03:31] that are we together so you see in
[1:03:35] another in another gospel Jesus said
[1:03:37] that what this woman did as long as the
[1:03:41] gospel is preached it will ever be
[1:03:43] remembered yes why because if she never
[1:03:46] did it our high priest would not step
[1:03:48] into his
[1:03:54] office and Jesus Jesus priesthood office
[1:03:57] he stepped into it when when he was
[1:04:00] dead that's why he told Mery don't touch
[1:04:03] me I must go to the
[1:04:07] father because he have to go beyond the
[1:04:15] vill are we
[1:04:17] together praise the
[1:04:19] Lord
[1:04:22] amen so you see you see what you see the
[1:04:25] the
[1:04:26] the you see the picture you see you see
[1:04:29] what I'm getting to by bringing the the
[1:04:32] the St of this woman now that is not the
[1:04:36] Fulfillment it's not the Fulfillment of
[1:04:39] anointing the most holy that's not the
[1:04:42] Fulfillment we will get into that praise
[1:04:45] the Lord amen you see because uh when
[1:04:48] when I when I thought about
[1:04:50] that uh uh it kind of lingered around my
[1:04:53] mind a little bit and uh uh uh uh I
[1:04:56] thought I said well okay uh you know i'
[1:04:59] I Was preparing for service there and
[1:05:02] and I was going to preach and so I I was
[1:05:04] I didn't want to get out of what I
[1:05:06] needed to preach that night
[1:05:08] but I had this thought at the back of my
[1:05:11] mind so let's let's let's just
[1:05:13] Fellowship around it tonight are we
[1:05:15] together amen amen praise the
[1:05:19] Lord praise the Lord so yeah we are
[1:05:22] seeing that uh she's uh she's she did
[1:05:26] something very very very very
[1:05:29] important very very very very important
[1:05:33] praise the Lord amen she did something
[1:05:37] very important to anoint him for him to
[1:05:39] be able to step into his prechool
[1:05:42] preschool office now if you read Acts
[1:05:45] chapter 10 let's let's let's go to Acts
[1:05:48] chapter 10 verse

[1:06:02] will just go right in there verse 38

[1:06:10] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:06:14] power who went about doing good and and
[1:06:19] uh healing all that were
[1:06:23] oppressed of the devil

[1:09:38] up to be our piano player in the church
[1:09:41] there and uh uh so uh the parents are
[1:09:44] around he's doing his wedding this
[1:09:46] weekend he asked that we come uh wanted
[1:09:50] me to come with the entire family but I
[1:09:52] will represent them and represent the
[1:09:54] church here
[1:09:55] amen so uh so the Bible says
[1:10:00] here verse 10 uh Leviticus 1810 Moses
[1:10:05] took the anointing oil and Anointed The
[1:10:10] Tabernacle and
[1:10:12] all that was therein and Sanctified them
[1:10:18] and he sprinkled he sprinkled thereof
[1:10:21] upon the altar seven times and Anointed
[1:10:24] The Altar water and all the vessel both
[1:10:28] the
[1:10:29] lava and his
[1:10:32] foot to sanctify them praise the
[1:10:36] Lord and he and he ped the all the
[1:10:40] anointing oil upon Aaron head and
[1:10:42] anointed him and sanctify him so this is
[1:10:45] the prophet preparing the priest and the
[1:10:48] entire uh Tabernacle and everything that
[1:10:51] is in the Tabernacle the prophet is
[1:10:53] preparing it for the service of the Lord
[1:10:55] Lord that's the reason why everything
[1:10:58] has to be brought under the order of the
[1:11:01] word we just don't run the church is not
[1:11:04] run on good ideas right the church is
[1:11:07] run on God's order amen praise the Lord
[1:11:11] it run on God's order as he has given it
[1:11:14] to his his Prophet now so when you look
[1:11:18] also in uh in in Hebrews chapter 9 let's
[1:11:21] look in Hebrews chapter 9 you realize
[1:11:23] that Paul brought is also talking about
[1:11:28] uh a better Covenant that this that was
[1:11:31] done now we have a better Covenant so
[1:11:34] just what Paul was trying to do in
[1:11:37] Hebrews chapter 9 let's read it
[1:11:45] together what I didn't wanted to do is
[1:11:47] what I'm doing I didn't want it to
[1:11:51] teach because I'm not a teacher now so
[1:11:55] Hebrew chapter 9 verse 19 for when Moses
[1:12:00] has spoken every precept to all the
[1:12:04] people according to the Lord so Moses
[1:12:06] read the Commandment he read the word he
[1:12:08] read all the
[1:12:10] precept he took the blood of the Cal and
[1:12:13] of the god with water and and uh uh and
[1:12:18] Scarlet wood and hup and sprinkle both
[1:12:21] the book and all the people saying this
[1:12:25] is the blood of the the the testament
[1:12:29] which God has joined onto you so the
[1:12:34] people and the book just like John says
[1:12:37] the bride and the spirit said come so
[1:12:40] when Moses do there he says by this by
[1:12:43] what I have done by sprinkling you you
[1:12:46] you are joined to the
[1:12:49] word praise the Lord amen you are joined
[1:12:52] to the word that's that is the same
[1:12:54] significance that communion has to the
[1:12:58] believer are we together amen praise the
[1:13:02] Lord amen so when when when when we take
[1:13:07] it not dishonoring the Lord's body we
[1:13:09] are guilty of it if we don't take it
[1:13:12] when we supposed to be take taking it we
[1:13:14] are also guilty of it so the only way to
[1:13:16] get out of it is to repent and take
[1:13:19] it is to make your life right and take
[1:13:21] it there is no way to to stay out of it
[1:13:24] you have in it does not make you
[1:13:27] free praise the Lord it don't make you
[1:13:29] free because you are already joined by
[1:13:32] accepting Christ by accepting the word
[1:13:34] you are joined to that are we together
[1:13:38] now
[1:13:40] so so okay now so we see here the Bible
[1:13:45] says moreover he
[1:13:48] sprinker with blood both the Tabernacle
[1:13:51] and all the vessel of the ministry now
[1:13:54] that's a reason why I'm reading this I'm
[1:13:57] I'm I'm going to get there there's a
[1:13:58] reason why I'm reading this uh I'm going
[1:14:01] to get there uh by the grace of
[1:14:04] God
[1:14:06] hallelujah amen now so you will see that
[1:14:10] uh
[1:14:12] uh look at when the temple was dedicated
[1:14:17] when Solomon Temple was dedicated 2
[1:14:19] Chronicle chapter 5 think about this
[1:14:23] when when when every everything was put
[1:14:26] in its
[1:14:27] place everything was set in order
[1:14:30] according to the Commandment of the
[1:14:33] Lord amen everything was put in his
[1:14:37] place the Bible says that things were
[1:14:39] set so much in
[1:14:42] order and and and uh uh uh when when
[1:14:46] they were when they were placed in their
[1:14:48] position and uh and and the and the
[1:14:50] priest came the Bible says the glory of
[1:14:53] the Lord
[1:14:56] amen filled the temple so
[1:15:00] much that even the the minister did not
[1:15:03] had a
[1:15:05] place because the the Tabernacle was
[1:15:08] filled with the glory of God why because
[1:15:12] everything was set right in their place
[1:15:16] right amen that is an order for the
[1:15:20] church if everything is in his place the
[1:15:22] glory of God will come that is is an
[1:15:25] order for the believer's individual life
[1:15:28] if everything is in place the glory of
[1:15:30] God we come that is the order for our
[1:15:33] home if everything in place the glory of
[1:15:35] God will be
[1:15:37] there are we
[1:15:40] together amen why because God inhabits
[1:15:44] his people
[1:15:46] yes
[1:15:48] amen he inhabit the Bible says he
[1:15:51] inhabit the Praises of his people but
[1:15:54] it's more in the sense the Praises is
[1:15:57] not just dancing to the drums and and
[1:16:00] the piano and the song leader leading
[1:16:02] song no we praise God when we have
[1:16:05] things in order right amen the Bible
[1:16:10] says the heaven declare the glory of the
[1:16:13] Lord why because it's in his
[1:16:18] place so when things are in order then
[1:16:22] God inhabits his people
[1:16:29] are we
[1:16:32] together it is not how much we know
[1:16:35] about how it must be in order no it's
[1:16:37] not the knowledge of it being in order
[1:16:39] it's it it's it's is it being in order
[1:16:43] it must be in order not just having the
[1:16:46] knowledge oh I know I supposed to do
[1:16:47] this I know no do it let's let's let's
[1:16:49] just do it
[1:16:54] because God do not inhabit our knowledge
[1:16:57] no
[1:16:58] right he inhabit our
[1:17:03] praise praise the Lord he he inhabit Our
[1:17:08] Praise You might not be singing a song
[1:17:10] in praising God but when you are living
[1:17:13] right and dressing right why you are
[1:17:15] declaring the glory of God you are
[1:17:18] praising God
[1:17:21] Amen praise is not only the song that we
[1:17:23] sing it's even in the life that we live
[1:17:26] it's in the things that we
[1:17:31] say speaking the truth always you are
[1:17:34] praising
[1:17:36] God because what he Delights in the
[1:17:39] truth are we
[1:17:45] together so when everything was put in
[1:17:49] place then the glory of God came down
[1:17:53] Hallelujah amen are we together praise
[1:17:57] the Lord so let's travel a little bit
[1:18:00] here so while I was looking at this I
[1:18:03] decided to go quickly back in and just
[1:18:05] pick up some few thoughts to share with
[1:18:07] you tonight when brother B talks about
[1:18:09] anointing the most holy it's beautiful
[1:18:11] if you pay attention you will really
[1:18:12] enjoy it it's very beautiful I promise
[1:18:14] you you'll really enjoy it amen because
[1:18:17] it's the reveal word amen you will not
[1:18:19] enjoy because I'm saying it you will
[1:18:21] enjoy because it's the truth amen you
[1:18:23] will enjoy because Prophet has given it
[1:18:25] to us so let's let's re a little bit and
[1:18:29] uh I'm just I'm just
[1:18:31] picking few Year from uh
[1:18:35] uh this say for purpose now to anoint
[1:18:40] the most
[1:18:42] holy now this may be a little bit
[1:18:45] strange for just a few few minut to many
[1:18:50] of you
[1:18:52] teachers praise the Lord
[1:18:56] just hold it just a minute see how it
[1:18:59] comes
[1:19:00] out this is the anointing
[1:19:03] Jesus is already
[1:19:07] anointed is that right the book of Acts
[1:19:10] said that God anointed Jesus with the
[1:19:14] Holy Ghost that's what we just read Amen
[1:19:17] in Acts chapter 10 and he went around
[1:19:20] doing good and Healing The Sick and so
[1:19:23] forth
[1:19:25] that's what makes him the mesiah because
[1:19:27] the mesiah means the anointed one amen
[1:19:32] he will not be called the Messiah if he
[1:19:34] was not
[1:19:35] anointed he testified of it right in the
[1:19:38] synagogues when he takes took the book
[1:19:41] and he read from Isaiah and said the
[1:19:43] spirit of the Lord God is upon me he was
[1:19:47] testifying of his anointing I'm anointed
[1:19:51] to pick this book up and speak to you
[1:19:55] and he said this day this scripture is
[1:19:58] fulfilled are we together so he's
[1:20:01] already anointed his the Messiah and the
[1:20:03] Messiah means the anointed one is that
[1:20:06] right and yeah at the end time
[1:20:10] he's to anoint the most holy so so watch
[1:20:15] now where we going now
[1:20:18] amen when you think about anointing the
[1:20:21] most holy what comes to your mind
[1:20:25] who is the most holy Jesus
[1:20:28] Jesus
[1:20:32] Jesus and this this was a prophecy to
[1:20:36] the Jews concerning what will happen in
[1:20:39] their 70 week
[1:20:42] period they are promised that the most
[1:20:45] holy will be
[1:20:47] anointed
[1:20:48] amen praise the Lord so yeah now uh uh
[1:20:54] uh uh the the prophet have have thrown
[1:20:56] the line into into the lake and and and
[1:20:59] he want to get a cash now he want to get
[1:21:01] a cash so he's making us to know that
[1:21:04] the scripture testify to us that he was
[1:21:07] already
[1:21:10] anointed
[1:21:11] amen he says but then it
[1:21:16] says but yeah at the end time he's to
[1:21:20] anoint the most holy what is what what
[1:21:24] is the most
[1:21:26] holy so my way of seeing it which I
[1:21:29] believe I can prove
[1:21:32] it by the scripture is to anoint the
[1:21:36] most holy which will be the
[1:21:39] Tabernacle that will be
[1:21:42] used during their
[1:21:46] Millennium praise the
[1:21:48] Lord the Tabernacle that will be used
[1:21:52] during the millennium
[1:21:56] are we
[1:21:57] together praise the Lord am I making you
[1:22:04] sleepy are you interesting uh uh
[1:22:07] interested in grapping what is what is

[1:24:28] scripture and he's going to bring us

[1:24:40] but let's let's let's just uh uh save
[1:24:43] our time for for this Wednesday night
[1:24:46] talk that we have together but I want
[1:24:48] you I want you to just stay right in
[1:24:50] there with me now see brother B comes
[1:24:52] down again he said
[1:24:54] so that the priest
[1:24:58] stood praise the
[1:25:00] Lord so that the priest to the priest
[1:25:03] could not stand to minister by reason of
[1:25:07] the cloud now he's talking about when
[1:25:09] Solomon Temple was dedicated and
[1:25:11] everything was in his place think about
[1:25:14] it now in the Millennium everything will
[1:25:18] be in his
[1:25:21] place everything will be in its place
[1:25:25] place it will it will be just like when
[1:25:30] when when Adam was turned over to
[1:25:33] Eden when God gave him to Eden
[1:25:36] everything was in his
[1:25:38] place are we together so see how he's
[1:25:42] bringing it now he's bringing it from
[1:25:44] the Tabernacle being in
[1:25:46] order where the glory of God came
[1:25:49] down amen now so let's let's go on a
[1:25:53] little bit here
[1:25:55] he says
[1:25:56] here and uh uh uh for the glory of the
[1:26:01] Lord have filled the house of God God
[1:26:05] came into the sanctuary that was to be
[1:26:10] anointed and was giving over to him for
[1:26:14] the people to come and
[1:26:17] worship to come and worship that is one
[1:26:20] of our element for the Millennium
[1:26:22] worship
[1:26:24] now so he says so to anoint not not the
[1:26:30] holy
[1:26:32] Place
[1:26:34] amen not the holy place the promise in
[1:26:39] Daniel is not to anoint the holy
[1:26:44] place is to anoint the most holy are we
[1:26:49] together amen now watch and see what he
[1:26:52] says here he says but to anoint the most
[1:26:56] holy the most holy place and we notice
[1:27:00] that we notice that New Jerusalem is the
[1:27:04] most holy place and the anointing will
[1:27:08] be upon the New Jerusalem that
[1:27:13] discern from God out of Heaven prepared
[1:27:17] as a
[1:27:21] bride Ador for or her
[1:27:27] husband I don't know what you see there
[1:27:30] tonight praise the Lord amen I take it
[1:27:35] back again brother Bram says the promise
[1:27:39] is not to anoint the most holy
[1:27:45] place is to anoint the most holy so the
[1:27:49] most holy is a person
[1:27:54] are we
[1:27:56] together
[1:28:01] amen but then he brings us to a
[1:28:08] place and the place that he brings us to
[1:28:11] is the New
[1:28:14] Jerusalem coming
[1:28:18] down praise the
[1:28:20] Lord the New Jerusalem is a place yeah
[1:28:30] but the anointing was for the most
[1:28:36] holy but this New Jerusalem that is
[1:28:39] coming down the Bible says is as a
[1:28:46] BRI so you get
[1:28:49] it you get the picture praise the Lord
[1:28:56] do you get the picture
[1:28:59] amen hallelujah
[1:29:02] amen so the bride was in was in this
[1:29:06] representation of a city like Jesus said
[1:29:10] in Matthew Chapter 5 you are a city that
[1:29:14] is on a hill that cannot be hid you are
[1:29:18] a
[1:29:22] city now you have have to remember that
[1:29:25] Revelation is a book of
[1:29:27] symbol John was looking at an a a city
[1:29:31] coming down but actually it was the
[1:29:38] bride are we
[1:29:44] together are you getting the
[1:29:47] picture amen actually it was the bride
[1:29:51] so that is the reason why uh uh he's
[1:29:54] saying it here it's almost like brother
[1:29:56] Bram said saying something and and and
[1:29:59] trying not to say
[1:30:01] it praise the
[1:30:04] Lord because if you can grab the
[1:30:07] symbol if you can grab the symbol and
[1:30:10] know what it
[1:30:13] represent you know exactly what he's
[1:30:15] talking
[1:30:18] about are we
[1:30:21] together so because he's already
[1:30:29] anointed that anointing of the most
[1:30:34] holy and is the temple for the
[1:30:42] millennial then what will it be it be
[1:30:45] the
[1:30:48] bride it is it will be the bride
[1:30:55] are we
[1:30:57] together now so it makes more
[1:31:01] sense that brother brandom said there
[1:31:04] everything wrong will be made right
[1:31:07] because everything will be in this
[1:31:12] place
[1:31:17] amen everything will be in its place
[1:31:28] can you imagine we we we come to the
[1:31:31] world born in sin shly in iniquity come
[1:31:33] to the word speaking
[1:31:35] lies praise the
[1:31:38] Lord and one of these days we will step
[1:31:41] we will step on the Millennium
[1:31:46] Shore with no trace of our first
[1:31:50] birth with no desire of sin amen no evil
[1:31:56] thoughts praise the
[1:32:00] Lord and everything that we have ever
[1:32:02] struggled with will be
[1:32:07] gone praise the Lord now if you have to
[1:32:11] go on a
[1:32:13] honeymoon and be worrying for how you
[1:32:16] will pay for your wedding you never did
[1:32:18] a good
[1:32:19] job praise the Lord you never did a good
[1:32:22] job you're not going to to
[1:32:24] I mean you mess that honey with some
[1:32:25] kind of a bitter
[1:32:27] pill praise the Lord amen so we going on
[1:32:31] the honeymon where we will be stress
[1:32:34] free Satan is Bound for the Thousand
[1:32:37] Years and the bride is going to be
[1:32:40] stress
[1:32:48] fre praise the Lord I don't want to
[1:32:51] preach tonight don't make me to don't
[1:32:54] make me to please are we together amen
[1:32:58] Lord
[1:33:02] amen so it's almost like when Jesus said
[1:33:06] in my father's house are many Mansion
[1:33:08] but says it's not Mansion of braks
[1:33:12] right praise the Lord so it's all it's
[1:33:15] it's the same as uh h h h h you know the
[1:33:20] the the the millennial
[1:33:22] Temple so he's bringing us to this place
[1:33:25] to
[1:33:28] realize just like Jesus was the type of
[1:33:33] the temple that that Moses built in the
[1:33:37] wilderness Jesus was the type of the
[1:33:40] temple that Solomon built he was the
[1:33:43] type of the temple that zarab and the
[1:33:45] rest have to

[1:34:55] when it was time to worship Elohim came
[1:34:57] down and he was in the spirit of worship
[1:35:00] because he was in the temple that was
[1:35:02] connected to praise he was in a perfect

[1:35:49] excuses we got to kick it
[1:35:51] out Hallelujah
[1:35:55] so like he said yes so to
[1:35:58] anoint not thy holy place but to anoint
[1:36:02] the most holy place and uh we notice
[1:36:06] that that New Jerusalem now you see here
[1:36:10] what what brother brandham is doing is
[1:36:12] to be able to give us an idea to be able
[1:36:15] to give us uh uh uh uh an interpretation
[1:36:19] of the
[1:36:21] scripture amen
[1:36:27] because when you actually look at it in
[1:36:30] sequence the New Jerusalem comes down
[1:36:33] after the
[1:36:37] Millennium so he's not giving us
[1:36:40] sequence here he's giving us
[1:36:44] interpretation he's trying to
[1:36:47] identify what is that most
[1:36:51] holy amen
[1:36:53] he called it a Most Holy place because
[1:36:57] the Bible called it the millennial
[1:37:00] Temple but then is also called the most
[1:37:03] holy because it's going to be a people
[1:37:09] yes praise the Lord
[1:37:12] amen it's going to be just like when Eve
[1:37:16] was taken out of
[1:37:19] idam Amen
[1:37:24] when Eve was taken out of Adam I mean uh
[1:37:27] uh when when when they went to worship
[1:37:29] she was not worshiping Adam both of them
[1:37:31] was worshiping Elohim
[1:37:34] right praise the
[1:37:37] Lord both of them was worshiping
[1:37:42] God are we
[1:37:45] together are you seeing the picture
[1:37:47] tonight amen amen
[1:37:55] so you
[1:37:56] see the reason why I took the
[1:38:00] woman washing Jesus feet and and and and
[1:38:04] and anointing him uh uh uh for our
[1:38:07] scripture reading
[1:38:09] tonight is to be able to to make us to
[1:38:14] see you know uh uh it's is uh uh uh just
[1:38:18] just in a place of a type like I said
[1:38:21] Jesus was entering into his pries to
[1:38:23] office because this is the way it was
[1:38:27] you read The Book of Leviticus reading
[1:38:29] from chapter 89 you go down you will
[1:38:31] realize that when when when the priests
[1:38:34] were called to their priesthood office
[1:38:37] there was a big
[1:38:39] basing amen and the priest would get in
[1:38:43] the Basin and he will be washed from
[1:38:45] head to
[1:38:48] toe he would be washed
[1:38:51] completely Aaron was the older brother
[1:38:53] of Moses but Moses was the prophet so
[1:38:55] Moses have to wash him right Moses have
[1:38:58] to wash he and his sons Moses have to
[1:39:02] anoint them Moses have to dress them and
[1:39:05] put them in the priesthood
[1:39:07] office praise the Lord amen that's the
[1:39:11] reason why no no no amount of theologic
[1:39:14] a man learn if you want to be in the
[1:39:16] fful ministry you got to be washed by a
[1:39:18] prophet right you got to be anointed and
[1:39:22] placed into the office
[1:39:24] are we together but that was the the the
[1:39:29] the original
[1:39:30] washing but then every time they come to
[1:39:36] sacrifice he does not need a complete
[1:39:39] body wash
[1:39:41] again he goes for a feet
[1:39:45] wash praise the Lord every time he comes
[1:39:50] over to the Tabernacle for sacrifice he
[1:39:53] goes for a feet wash and that was the
[1:39:56] same thing that Jesus was
[1:39:58] introducing to the New Testament
[1:40:02] Church when he took a tow and a basing
[1:40:05] and then he watched the disciples feet
[1:40:07] and then he said you do a one onto
[1:40:09] another amen we have our original
[1:40:14] watching amen we we we have been uh H
[1:40:17] Washed by the Water of the word amen
[1:40:20] amen when God called us praise the Lord
[1:40:24] out of sin he put us in the basing he
[1:40:27] washed us he set our mind on
[1:40:30] Christ but yeah when we come to service
[1:40:33] every time we need a feet wash yes he
[1:40:36] had to wash our feet to help us to walk
[1:40:44] right
[1:40:49] amen so it is it's not a whole body
[1:40:52] watch I mean the word the Holy Ghost is
[1:40:54] just going to pick up something and
[1:40:56] address a little bit thing in your life
[1:40:59] address a little bit thing in this
[1:41:00] person life you walk right this way say
[1:41:03] things this way approach things this way
[1:41:05] talk to things this way ask for
[1:41:06] forgiveness you know address these
[1:41:08] things he he it's it's it's a feet
[1:41:12] wash because when we come back for the
[1:41:14] next service again he's going to give us
[1:41:16] a the priest had to wash their feet
[1:41:19] before they step into the holiest of
[1:41:21] holy
[1:41:25] that's why Jesus says leave
[1:41:28] her she's doing this against my
[1:41:35] barrier praise the
[1:41:37] Lord hallelujah
[1:41:41] amen now so H H uh but yet here is that
[1:41:46] uh uh you know brother BR is bringing us
[1:41:48] to the place for us to be able to
[1:41:50] realize
[1:41:54] even though it's a it's a 70 week
[1:41:58] prophecy that concern the
[1:42:02] Jews
[1:42:04] amen but maiah the priest just like
[1:42:08] Moses got a gentile
[1:42:10] bride praise the
[1:42:12] Lord amen maiah the prince he's going to
[1:42:17] have a gentle bride
[1:42:23] are we
[1:42:27] together even though h h h the the the
[1:42:30] the scene looks ugly David had to send
[1:42:33] Urias out there for him to be killed and
[1:42:36] he took Bel
[1:42:38] Sheba but yet from theba will come a son
[1:42:42] called
[1:42:44] Solomon that will build a temple that
[1:42:46] will represent
[1:42:50] Jesus amen amen son of David upon his
[1:42:55] throne and that's supposed to be a
[1:42:57] fulfillment of the
[1:43:00] millennium are we together
[1:43:10] amen praise the
[1:43:13] Lord now so you see I say this and then
[1:43:15] I
[1:43:16] close uh uh the other night when we had
[1:43:19] the the the worship night with uh
[1:43:22] brother brother young I read a scripture
[1:43:24] there out of the book of uh uh uh Isaiah
[1:43:29] there and talking about the Garment of
[1:43:31] Praise for the spirit of
[1:43:34] heaviness praise the Lord amen the G of
[1:43:39] praise for the spirit of heaviness
[1:43:41] because uh I mean that's that's what uh
[1:43:44] uh uh uh the that's what the melenia
[1:43:47] temple is all going to be about the
[1:43:50] Bible says it's going to be uh had I had
[1:43:53] another quote here but I didn't add it
[1:43:54] to my notes so they will not be able to
[1:43:56] project it for you but
[1:43:59] uh uh
[1:44:02] uh yeah that was so so much in myself I
[1:44:05] did
[1:44:09] not but when God set up the millenum uh
[1:44:12] uh uh Temple he will anoint the most
[1:44:16] holy net th holy but the most holy but
[1:44:21] when the king Take his strong for 1,000
[1:44:25] years Glory she's she's over now the
[1:44:29] anointing of the most holy will be the
[1:44:33] last thing that will take place when the
[1:44:36] Tabernacle is erected the resurrection
[1:44:40] has come the Jews has returned Christ
[1:44:43] and his bride has come the Jews the
[1:44:46] 1,000 and uh uh
[1:44:49] one 144,000 are seal the millennium
[1:44:53] has taken place there will be an
[1:44:56] anointing when the most holy place will
[1:45:00] be Anointed The the holy the holiest of
[1:45:04] holy and the most holy the most holy
[1:45:07] place is the century where God live
[1:45:10] between the cherubin so you see you look
[1:45:13] at it and in your mind you think about a
[1:45:17] place but what God is actually talking
[1:45:20] about is you right
[1:45:25] praise the
[1:45:26] Lord
[1:45:31] amen what he's talking about is
[1:45:41] you are we
[1:45:48] together because the promise of the
[1:45:50] Millennium is their Christ and his bride
[1:45:53] will be just like Adam and
[1:45:56] Eve and we know that that Bride is a
[1:45:59] gentle
[1:46:00] bride that came out of all the church
[1:46:05] ages all the ones that stood for the
[1:46:07] word for their a for their

[1:46:17] day all the Scandal and the things that
[1:46:20] were going on they were able to rise
[1:46:23] buff because as the enemy com in as a FL
[1:46:26] the spirit of of the Lord rais up a
[1:46:29] standard and these people were able to
[1:46:32] benefit from the standard that has been
[1:46:34] raising in their day to take a stand for
[1:46:38] God praise the
[1:46:40] Lord not enough to be a church member
[1:46:43] not enough to get our names on the
[1:46:46] book but to take a stand for God take a
[1:46:49] stand for the word

[1:47:02] amen so he goes ahead he says uh uh uh
[1:47:06] uh uh uh the most holy plac is the
[1:47:09] center where God

[1:51:25] anticipation and it is the anticipation
[1:51:28] that will bring them off the grave they
[1:51:30] will rise up with of the Grave with that
[1:51:33] se he said just like just like Abraham
