[28:43] you're back in the house of the lord
[28:44] tonight
[28:45] praise the lord
[28:47] you know uh
[28:48] slowly
[28:50] uh
[28:50] the christian church is beginning to
[28:53] drift away from
[28:55] the principle of god's word so it's it's
[28:58] always uh it's a blessing it's uh
[29:01] it's it's a lot of comfort and
[29:03] encouragement to the heart of any
[29:05] preacher to see your people showing off
[29:07] sunday evening for convenient service
[29:09] amen
[29:10] praise the lord
[29:16] job chapter 32 let's uh
[29:31] let's read from uh
[29:34] verse 7 job chapter 32 let's read from
[29:37] verse 7.
[29:42] i said they should speak
[29:47] a multitudes of years should teach
[29:50] wisdom
[29:53] now job is is uh he's either speaking a
[29:56] parable here
[29:58] or this is an expression in the sense
[30:00] that
[30:02] the many days that we live on earth we
[30:04] should be learning
[30:06] uh uh
[30:08] you should be able to teach us
[30:10] or you would think that
[30:12] people with great age and great
[30:14] education will be people that will have
[30:17] a lot of wisdom but it does not seem to
[30:19] be like that
[30:21] i said they should speak in multitudes
[30:23] of years should teach wisdom
[30:25] but
[30:27] there is a spirit in man
[30:30] and the inspiration of the almighty
[30:34] giveth them wisdom
[30:38] praise the lord
[30:40] for great men are now always wise
[30:44] neither do the age understand
[30:47] judgment
[30:50] praise the lord
[30:53] second timothy chapter three
[30:56] second timothy chapter three
[31:04] second team chapter three
[31:07] we want to take one verse there
[31:12] very familiar
[31:23] or maybe two verse 16
[31:25] all scriptures
[31:27] is given
[31:28] by inspiration of god
[31:34] praise the lord am i reading from the
[31:35] right place
[31:36] okay okay
[31:39] i'm sure i'm not uh
[31:42] all scriptures are given by inspiration
[31:44] of god and is
[31:46] profitable for doctrine
[31:48] for reproof
[31:50] for correction
[31:51] for instruction
[31:53] in righteousness
[31:55] that the man of god
[31:57] may be perfect which means he may be
[31:59] mentioned that he may grow up
[32:02] thoroughly furnished
[32:04] onto all good works
[32:07] let's pray together heavenly father
[32:09] lord we i hear this evening lord god to
[32:13] in this symbolic way identified ourself
[32:16] with the body and the blood of the lord
[32:19] jesus
[32:20] but father we know that the highest part
[32:22] of the the service lord is the reading
[32:24] of your word for no service and
[32:27] gathering of your people is complete
[32:29] without the reading of your word
[32:32] we have read your word and dear god we
[32:35] will ask that something will be said
[32:37] of internal value
[32:39] something that will draw us closer to
[32:42] the foot of the cross
[32:43] because we know lord god
[32:46] uh
[32:48] revelation 10 says in the voice
[32:51] the date of the voice of the seven
[32:53] injured when he shall begin to sound
[32:56] that message has gone forth
[32:58] there's a people on the earth that is a
[33:00] witness
[33:02] and oh god you said
[33:04] then time shall be no more
[33:06] or father we are living in those days
[33:09] help us now lord
[33:11] in jesus name
[33:13] amen
[33:14] the lord bless you you may have your
[33:15] seed i want to talk a little bit on the
[33:17] inspiration
[33:19] of the almighty i was going to take
[33:21] something
[33:23] uh
[33:25] for example i was i was listening to
[33:28] uh
[33:29] uh the prince of the house of david
[33:31] you know brother branham referenced that
[33:33] book
[33:34] that's that's one of his uh
[33:36] favorite fashion book
[33:38] that uh that he used to read
[33:41] uh the prince of the house of david
[33:44] so i was i was listening to it
[33:46] and and and then i came to see why
[33:48] brother branham loved the book
[33:51] because uh there's a story of
[33:53] blambatimos that brother branham
[33:55] to speak about
[33:57] blambotimo in islam
[33:59] and
[34:00] and is portrayed in that book
[34:03] and
[34:04] and while i was reading the balkan with
[34:06] a few of the things
[34:07] that uh because this book is a fiction
[34:10] story
[34:11] of
[34:12] of uh uh
[34:15] a gentleman that wrote it and what and
[34:18] the way he he uh
[34:21] he
[34:22] was inspired to read the book
[34:25] he portrayed a young lady
[34:28] that had just got down to jerusalem
[34:31] just at the time
[34:33] when when jesus began his ministry john
[34:36] was preaching and so he went through
[34:39] the gospel
[34:42] and it is almost
[34:44] a story
[34:46] of an ordinary person
[34:49] okay somebody that was not attached to
[34:52] the disciples somebody that was not
[34:54] attacked because you have to realize
[34:56] that there were people there were people
[34:58] that were humans there were population
[35:00] living in those days
[35:03] and and many people had
[35:06] their own personal
[35:08] version of what they think about what
[35:09] was happening
[35:12] and all of those things are not written
[35:15] here so you see out of inspiration he
[35:18] wrote that book and he's he's playing
[35:20] out this person that have just come to
[35:22] town and he heard about a prophet
[35:24] preaching on jordan and he went there
[35:26] and listening and everybody said wow
[35:28] what kind of he have never we have never
[35:30] heard anything like that you know
[35:33] but
[35:34] uh the thing that is the other
[35:37] there's a difference
[35:40] between
[35:42] inspiration there's a difference between
[35:46] inspiration
[35:47] and uh
[35:49] and thou said the lord
[35:53] okay let me let me give you an example
[35:56] i i can read a scripture like i've just
[35:59] read tonight i'm about to preach
[36:02] i will i will use an inspiration i have
[36:05] an inspiration to be able to make my
[36:08] picture clear to you
[36:11] praise the lord
[36:12] now so as i'm as i'm i'm i'm i'm
[36:16] preaching by inspiration maybe uh
[36:19] i'm dramatizing something just so you
[36:21] can be i can be able to capture your
[36:24] attention okay to capture your attention
[36:27] to draw you into my picture
[36:30] now another preacher would come and
[36:32] preach from the very same scripture
[36:35] and he will have his inspiration
[36:38] praise the lord so inspiration is not
[36:41] interpretation
[36:46] praise the lord
[36:47] so uh
[36:49] i would be wrong to say when a man comes
[36:52] to preach from job 38 and he don't
[36:54] preach it like the way i preach it i
[36:56] said no you are wrong
[36:59] no
[37:01] that's an inspiration
[37:05] are we together
[37:06] so the the the prince of the house of
[37:09] david is an inspiration
[37:11] that a man got to be able to dramatize
[37:14] the ministry of jesus christ
[37:17] uh uh
[37:18] uh uh he took his inspiration from the
[37:21] bible
[37:22] but he created a story
[37:25] that the common people can be drawn into
[37:28] it
[37:32] are we together
[37:35] praise the lord but we want to talk
[37:37] about the inspiration of the almighty
[37:40] now
[37:41] uh back over to the book of job
[37:43] is is is uh it's amazing that uh
[37:48] you see
[37:49] the footprints of the holy ghost in the
[37:52] old testament
[37:55] just like like like job said here the uh
[37:58] in verse 8
[38:00] he says here
[38:02] that uh uh
[38:05] praise the lord
[38:07] okay this is joke 32 i'm i'm over in 38
[38:11] i'm sorry job 32 year in in in verse 8
[38:14] he says but there is a spirit in man
[38:19] what is that spirit
[38:22] and he called that spirit
[38:24] the inspiration
[38:27] of the almighty
[38:31] and paul here in the new testament is
[38:34] saying all scriptures
[38:39] amen
[38:41] he's saying all scripture
[38:47] is given
[38:49] by inspiration
[38:53] so you can see that in the old testament
[38:57] the prophets
[38:59] they had a shadow of the holy ghost they
[39:03] they not had the fullness they did not
[39:04] have the complete understanding of what
[39:08] this enduring vein is but they have a a
[39:12] shadow they can tell that uh you know
[39:14] something like uh you know uh uh job
[39:17] saying i know my redeemer live it amen
[39:20] he's saying when the tree dies you know
[39:23] it goes and then and you know i mean out
[39:26] of inspiration he caught the
[39:28] resurrection
[39:30] he got a picture of the resurrection
[39:33] even though he asked ask a question when
[39:36] man die what becomes of him
[39:38] but then he says i know my redeemer
[39:40] lived
[39:42] praise the lord
[39:45] so you see it was the move of god in in
[39:49] in the shadow form it's almost like when
[39:52] you see a shadow on the wall you from a
[39:54] distance you can tell whether it is male
[39:56] or female as the shadow comes closer is
[39:59] it then it starts to make sense
[40:03] praise the lord
[40:05] now so while the uh so right here you
[40:08] realize that job
[40:10] job hard
[40:12] and understanding
[40:14] he had an understanding he says
[40:19] this should speak multitudes of years
[40:21] should teach wisdom because here he said
[40:23] he's dealing with these people all of
[40:25] this is three friends that is accusing
[40:27] him all of these guys are older guys
[40:32] and to job he's sitting down and
[40:34] thinking that i i think in my mind i'm
[40:37] thinking when people grow up they should
[40:39] get wisdom
[40:40] but it does not looks like that
[40:44] praise the lord
[40:45] because you find many of them you know
[40:47] piercing their ears and
[40:50] and trying to be young the more they
[40:52] grow up the more the one who becomes
[40:53] younger
[40:56] is the desire of man for for the new
[40:59] birth
[41:00] amen
[41:02] he don't want he don't want to get the
[41:04] new birth in god's way he want to get it
[41:06] his way
[41:07] by cutting his head and shipping it like
[41:10] a young boy
[41:11] i mean the wrinkle can tells
[41:16] praise the lord
[41:19] amen
[41:20] so we want to talk a little bit about
[41:22] inspiration tonight
[41:23] uh i won't keep you long if i can just
[41:26] use 10 meanings of your time here before
[41:29] we turn the service over now so uh uh
[41:34] paul
[41:35] picks this up in uh
[41:38] in
[41:39] second timothy where we just read
[41:43] he says all scriptures
[41:45] are given
[41:46] by inspiration
[41:49] praise the lord
[41:51] all scriptures are given by inspiration
[41:55] now the word inspiration
[41:58] the word inspiration
[42:00] is taken from
[42:02] uh
[42:03] uh
[42:04] is it's a translator word that is given
[42:07] to us
[42:08] meaning the birth of god
[42:13] so paul is saying
[42:14] every scripture
[42:17] was god's birth
[42:19] that's why jesus said man shall not live
[42:22] by bread alone
[42:24] but by every word
[42:26] that comes from the mouth of god
[42:29] because every word that comes from the
[42:31] mouth of god is the breath of god
[42:37] amen
[42:38] let me read something to you here from
[42:39] black's femur needs brother branham said
[42:41] he said the church is the mystical body
[42:44] of christ
[42:46] born by the breath of god
[42:49] he says that you get it the church of
[42:51] god is born
[42:53] by the breath of god
[42:56] god
[42:56] god breath
[42:58] breathe into the nostril spiritually
[43:03] of adam
[43:05] and he became
[43:07] a living soul
[43:09] so what what he's saying yet is that
[43:11] he's taking us back to eating
[43:15] when god
[43:16] uh uh form men out of the dust
[43:19] and uh and and uh uh and and breath into
[43:24] the nostril of man
[43:26] praise the lord amen now do you see and
[43:31] understand
[43:32] why
[43:33] when adam
[43:36] came to life he could do nothing but do
[43:39] the way of god
[43:40] he named the animals god was okay
[43:42] because why all through his entire being
[43:46] was the breath of god
[43:48] it was god's own life he couldn't live
[43:50] any way different
[43:53] because he had the breath of god
[43:57] praise the lord now you have to also
[43:59] realize adam did not have parents
[44:03] so he he did not have the genetic war
[44:06] that we have
[44:10] the genetic war that came that comes
[44:12] down from our parents our grandparents
[44:14] grandparents our attitude our behavior
[44:17] our what we like and what we don't like
[44:19] adam did not have that
[44:21] all adam how was the breath of god in
[44:23] his nostrils so he could not do anything
[44:26] different
[44:28] praise the lord he could not do anything
[44:31] different that's the reason why he came
[44:34] he couldn't even fall
[44:38] because there was no falling nature in
[44:40] him
[44:41] you and myself we can fall because we
[44:43] have fallen nature
[44:44] but adam calling for
[44:48] praise the lord if it was not because of
[44:51] the love of his wife adam could not fall
[44:54] he was not deceived
[44:59] he was not he knew exactly what he was
[45:01] doing
[45:03] because there was no falling nature in
[45:06] him
[45:09] are we together
[45:12] so while the brother gave us an example
[45:14] he says
[45:16] the breath breathed into the nostrils
[45:19] spiritually of adam and he became a
[45:21] living soul that you know
[45:24] the pentecostal or the true pentecostal
[45:27] church
[45:28] is born by the breath of god so what is
[45:30] he saying here
[45:32] he's saying what god did to adam was the
[45:35] same thing god did in the upper room
[45:42] what he did to adam is the same thing he
[45:45] did on the day of pentecost
[45:47] when the holy ghost came down
[45:50] praise the lord
[45:52] that is the reason why those men and
[45:54] women that were afraid of the jewish
[45:57] council
[45:58] and they were hiding themselves when the
[45:59] holy ghost came down brother balaam says
[46:02] uh peter took a soapbox
[46:05] and he stood on there and he said repent
[46:07] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[46:09] jesus and he was no longer afraid
[46:12] why because the breath of god
[46:14] [Music]
[46:16] has blown away the fear
[46:18] blown away the doubt
[46:23] are we together
[46:28] you know the pentecost of the true
[46:29] pentecostal church is born by the breath
[46:31] of god he says let me let me read to you
[46:36] and see whether the church is born by
[46:38] the breath of god or net like adam was
[46:40] in the beginning
[46:42] praise the lord
[46:44] so he goes back
[46:46] and he takes
[46:47] uh
[46:56] praise the lord
[46:58] he goes back and he takes
[47:01] okay
[47:03] i did something here now
[47:05] that would be uh saint john let's go to
[47:08] the book of sin john
[47:09] i kind of
[47:12] wrongly wrote mine
[47:14] mine now
[47:19] are we together
[47:21] praise the lord
[47:24] amen
[47:25] what a wonderful jesus we serve
[47:29] glory be to god
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:40] um
[47:52] now sin john chapter 20 that was what he
[47:54] was referring to
[47:56] you can pick that up uh
[47:59] uh
[48:00] in the message there when you study
[48:03] you see the black female's name
[48:06] listening to that you see him referring
[48:08] to death it's in john chapter 20.
[48:24] praise the lord
[48:26] amen
[48:29] now so in john chapter 20 when you read
[48:32] from uh
[48:33] from verse
[48:35] 19.
[48:37] the same day at evening
[48:39] being the first day
[48:43] of the week
[48:45] when the doors were shut the disciples
[48:47] where the disciples were those were shot
[48:50] where the disciples were assembled
[48:52] for fear of the jews that's what i was
[48:54] saying or these men they were afraid
[48:57] because now jesus was was you know was
[49:00] taken away from them you know because of
[49:02] the fear of the jews they were they were
[49:03] all the same year
[49:05] jesus came and stood
[49:08] in the mess
[49:09] and said unto them peace be unto you
[49:13] and when he has so said
[49:16] he show himself his hand and his side
[49:20] then where the disciples glide
[49:23] when they saw the lord
[49:26] then said jesus unto them peace be unto
[49:29] you
[49:30] as my father have sent me
[49:33] even so sent are you
[49:37] and when he have said this
[49:42] he breathed on them
[49:44] and said unto them
[49:47] receive ye
[49:49] the holy ghost
[49:52] praise the lord
[49:55] amen
[49:57] he said
[49:59] receive
[50:01] yeah
[50:02] the holy ghost
[50:05] and uh
[50:07] there's something that just that just uh
[50:12] that just came to my mind
[50:15] that should be in john chapter 7.
[50:20] if you want to go there with me
[50:22] uh
[50:35] that's that would be c john chapter
[50:37] seven
[50:44] it's in john chapter 7 uh
[50:47] verse 38.
[50:55] praise the lord
[50:58] the bible says verse 37 in the in in the
[51:01] last day that great death of the feast
[51:03] jesus 2
[51:05] and cry saying if any mentors let he
[51:08] come unto me and drink
[51:11] he the believer me
[51:13] as the scripture have said
[51:16] out of his belly
[51:18] shall flow
[51:19] rivers of living water
[51:22] but does he speak
[51:26] but they speak he of the spirit
[51:30] which they that believe on him
[51:33] should receive
[51:36] for the holy ghost
[51:38] was not yet given
[51:41] because
[51:43] that jesus was not yet glorified
[51:47] now so yeah jesus is speaking of the
[51:50] holy ghost
[51:51] and saying if you believe in me out of
[51:53] out of your belly will flow rivers of
[51:56] water
[51:57] praise the lord
[51:59] now
[52:01] but
[52:02] john is helping us to realize that when
[52:04] he made that statement he was referring
[52:07] to the holy ghost
[52:10] now in a simple sense
[52:12] he was the embodiment of the holy ghost
[52:15] all that was in god was in christ
[52:18] so until he leave
[52:21] he cannot release god to the people
[52:25] are we together
[52:27] now so but here he said he's making
[52:30] reference to the to the holy ghost that
[52:32] they were going to receive
[52:34] so and even here the bible says that he
[52:37] said as the scripture have said so there
[52:40] are shadows in the old testament that we
[52:42] will look at a little bit here there are
[52:44] shadows in the old testament that was
[52:47] that was making emphasis of how
[52:49] important the holy ghost is
[52:54] praise the lord
[52:55] now
[52:56] the bible says that jesus make reference
[52:59] to that the holy spirit that is she
[53:02] received because jesus was not yet
[53:04] glorified
[53:05] but over here is in john chapter 20 he
[53:08] has already resurrected he has already
[53:11] ascended to the father for a witness and
[53:14] he has come back you remember when mary
[53:16] saw it he said touch me i'm not a
[53:18] senator don't touch me i'm not a senator
[53:20] to the father yet he went to the father
[53:22] present the sacrifice to the father he
[53:24] came back so now he's glorified because
[53:28] he's even walking through the wall
[53:30] the bible says the doors were shot
[53:33] praise the lord he never needed a key
[53:39] praise the lord
[53:40] he never needed a key or the password
[53:43] brother jordan to enter that door
[53:45] he never needed a password
[53:48] he just came right through the wall
[53:52] and he said peace be unto you
[53:54] praise the lord now the holy ghost that
[53:57] he made reference to
[54:00] during his ethnic ministry
[54:03] because he was not yet glorified
[54:06] now he's coming back to that subject
[54:09] and the bible said he said peace be unto
[54:12] you
[54:13] and he breathed upon them
[54:16] and said receive ye the holy ghost
[54:23] praise the lord
[54:25] are we together
[54:26] amen
[54:27] now so uh uh i mean that there are a lot
[54:30] of things we can say on that but uh it
[54:33] will take much of our time tonight i'm
[54:35] just trying to drag into this thing of
[54:37] of an inspiration
[54:39] because you realize here
[54:42] jesus in one sense is prophesying to the
[54:45] believers
[54:46] in one sense uh uh uh uh he's securing
[54:50] them he's putting them under his word
[54:52] receive year the holy ghost we know that
[54:55] it will it would take uh uh
[54:57] uh it would take a couple of days uh
[55:01] or 10 days later
[55:03] before they will receive the holy ghost
[55:05] praise the lord
[55:06] amen
[55:08] after his ascension it would take 10
[55:10] days before they would receive the holy
[55:12] ghost but yeah he's prophesying over
[55:14] them and and moreover the scripture is
[55:16] making it in a way
[55:19] for us to be able to grab the picture
[55:21] the bible says he breathed on them
[55:26] praise the lord
[55:31] glory be to god
[55:33] amen
[55:36] i mean if you were in that service and
[55:38] he breathed there is no way you can get
[55:39] the holy ghost
[55:40] [Laughter]
[55:43] even if you don't want the holy ghost
[55:45] you will get it
[55:46] because you've got a touch of his breath
[55:49] and but that's the same way when the
[55:50] word of god is preached
[55:52] because the word of god is the breath of
[55:54] god
[56:04] praise the lord
[56:06] now so uh
[56:07] uh the bible says he breathed on them
[56:09] and he says receive year the holy ghost
[56:12] so brother branham was referring to that
[56:14] he says let me read something here that
[56:15] was saint john chapter 20 that he was
[56:18] reading he says and and see whether the
[56:20] church is born by the breath of god or
[56:22] not
[56:23] like adam was
[56:25] in the beginning he said watch
[56:28] how do you get in the church he said
[56:31] born by what the breath of god
[56:34] breathe on me breathe on me spirit of
[56:36] the living god
[56:38] breathe on me that's my prayer tonight
[56:40] amen is that your prayer
[56:42] amen praise the lord just let the holy
[56:45] spirit breathe all mine for the breath
[56:48] of god what it is
[56:50] seal away into the kingdom of god
[56:55] praise the lord
[56:57] so he brings the birth the breath of god
[56:59] and tie it to the seal uh efficient full
[57:03] teddy creed now the holy ghost whereby
[57:05] ye are sealed
[57:09] you see is the breath of god that seal
[57:11] us away
[57:13] into the kingdom of god
[57:16] are we together
[57:18] now let's go now to
[57:20] a second timothy let's let's study that
[57:22] a little bit
[57:23] uh i'm almost out of my time here i get
[57:26] eight minutes
[57:27] to do this i don't trust myself
[57:34] praise the lord
[57:44] now when you come over to to uh uh
[57:47] second timothy chapter three there is
[57:49] something here this this is a very is a
[57:52] very
[57:54] wonderful
[57:55] instruction by the apostle paul
[57:58] now you have to know that paul was a
[58:00] very learned man in the torah
[58:04] you know he knew the torah which was the
[58:07] the the the old testament the old
[58:09] testament books
[58:11] so
[58:12] uh paul
[58:13] using this statement that every
[58:15] scripture
[58:16] is given
[58:18] by inspiration
[58:19] it is not just
[58:21] an oversized statement
[58:24] it is not because he had ran out of
[58:26] something to say
[58:27] amen
[58:28] he knew exactly that every scripture
[58:31] every verse in the bible
[58:36] is the breath of god
[58:40] that's why the bible says if you take
[58:42] one your name will be blotted out
[58:45] you can add to it
[58:48] you can take from it
[58:50] praise the lord
[58:51] amen
[58:56] and also you can take it lightly
[59:03] because it's the breath of god
[59:06] brother branham describe it like this
[59:08] he says
[59:10] it is almost like we are walking over a
[59:12] cousin
[59:16] and that custom will be hell
[59:20] and the only stream that we have to walk
[59:23] from time to intensity over this costume
[59:27] is the word of god
[59:31] that's the only thing that is holding us
[59:34] from sinking deep
[59:38] praise lord now if you if you realize
[59:42] that your life depends on that
[59:45] you have to take it serious
[59:51] you have to take it serious you have to
[59:53] take every word of god serious god meant
[59:55] what he says
[1:00:03] because he says what he means
[1:00:06] so uh paul says here all scripture i
[1:00:09] give him by inspiration
[1:00:12] and it's profitable for doctrine what
[1:00:15] does that means
[1:00:19] our scripture is given
[1:00:21] by inspiration and is profitable for
[1:00:24] doctrine what is doctrine
[1:00:28] in a simple biblical sense doctrine is
[1:00:31] what is right
[1:00:36] so the scripture like brother branham
[1:00:38] will come and tell us
[1:00:40] a phrase in this way
[1:00:42] cod condor order and doctrine
[1:00:48] the doctrine is what is right the things
[1:00:51] that we must stand for
[1:00:56] so paul is saying that all scripture
[1:00:59] is giving it's profitable
[1:01:02] if you stand with all scripture
[1:01:05] you will stand and and do and live with
[1:01:07] what is right
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:12] all scripture
[1:01:14] is profitable for doctrine
[1:01:16] for reproof
[1:01:18] what is reproof
[1:01:23] reprove is
[1:01:24] what is not right
[1:01:30] while doctrine is what is right
[1:01:33] reprove
[1:01:34] is what is not right so all scripture
[1:01:38] is profitable
[1:01:40] to be able to show us what is not right
[1:01:46] and as much as show us what is right it
[1:01:49] also point out to us what is not right
[1:01:58] all scripture
[1:02:01] is given by inspiration and is
[1:02:03] profitable for correction
[1:02:06] how to get it right
[1:02:13] how to get it right
[1:02:18] brother branham says the word of god for
[1:02:21] every age will correct the error of the
[1:02:24] age
[1:02:25] he says the word will correct the error
[1:02:28] all the time
[1:02:29] even though jesus was just a 12 year old
[1:02:32] boy but when mary said what you were not
[1:02:34] supposed to say
[1:02:35] the word corrected the error
[1:02:39] so it's profitable for correction
[1:02:42] that's the only way you can enjoy the
[1:02:45] word if you are open up for correction
[1:02:49] because the world is profitable for
[1:02:52] correction
[1:02:55] praise the law it's not your school but
[1:02:57] where you just said it to pass
[1:02:59] you are not really interested in the
[1:03:01] subject
[1:03:02] but you just scrum so you can make the
[1:03:04] great no that's not the word of god
[1:03:14] praise the lord
[1:03:16] is profitable for doctrine
[1:03:19] what is right
[1:03:21] for reprove what is not right
[1:03:24] for correction
[1:03:27] how to get it right
[1:03:31] and for instruction how to stay right
[1:03:37] praise the lord
[1:03:39] how to stay right
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:46] for you to know what is right
[1:03:48] and what is not right
[1:03:51] and then how to get it right
[1:03:53] and then how to stay right
[1:03:57] that's what this book is giving for
[1:04:03] it's the birth of god
[1:04:11] are we together
[1:04:13] now brother brennan preached a message
[1:04:15] uh a spiritual inspiration
[1:04:19] and in that message he read from
[1:04:22] ii kings chapter four
[1:04:24] it's strange enough he read ii king
[1:04:27] chapter 4
[1:04:28] verse 30.
[1:04:33] it sounded to me like ephesians 4 30.
[1:04:35] but let's leave it like that
[1:04:38] now so in in in this message brother
[1:04:40] brown was talking about a shimmy knight
[1:04:42] woman
[1:04:43] he was he was trying now to help us to
[1:04:45] to understand spiritual inspiration he
[1:04:48] was talking about a shimano woman this
[1:04:50] woman that was living in her little town
[1:04:52] and she never had a child she i mean she
[1:04:54] she tried everything to have a child she
[1:04:56] never had a child so uh
[1:04:59] while she lived there i mean she was she
[1:05:01] was at peace with everybody i mean she
[1:05:04] had got over the worried of having a
[1:05:06] child and she was just happy
[1:05:08] and they said well maybe the law didn't
[1:05:10] you know and and then she realized
[1:05:12] elisha coming back
[1:05:14] and uh and she told her husband i think
[1:05:16] that is the holy man of god you know
[1:05:18] let's let's make a place for him you

[1:05:29] in a little and and something like that
[1:05:32] and uh and and
[1:05:34] now now grab this now
[1:05:37] grab this
[1:05:39] that is a thought
[1:05:41] that came to her mind
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:45] that is a thought that came to her mind
[1:05:48] that she went to tell her husband
[1:05:53] but little would she know
[1:05:56] that that was a breath of god
[1:06:01] god took a deep breath and she received
[1:06:03] it
[1:06:06] as an inspiration
[1:06:12] and she went and told her husband
[1:06:14] you know i it just it just i just i just
[1:06:16] feel like we should find a place
[1:06:21] praise the lord
[1:06:23] and uh uh
[1:06:25] uh and you know the story there that how
[1:06:28] you know the the god elijah the place he
[1:06:30] will come and rest they will feed him
[1:06:32] you know you sleep good and eat good and
[1:06:34] and one time he told his his uh his
[1:06:37] seven years out and says uh
[1:06:39] uh
[1:06:42] let me go and ask these people what do
[1:06:44] you
[1:06:44] want i mean it's just been so nice to us
[1:06:50] i just feel that i should bless them
[1:06:53] call the woman she says i'm fine we are
[1:06:55] okay you know my husband and myself we
[1:06:58] are we are doing okay you know uh i mean
[1:07:02] not really doing it for the game
[1:07:06] so you can see there it was a breath of
[1:07:08] god but little did she knew that
[1:07:14] god was so concerned about his prophet
[1:07:19] tracking
[1:07:20] hundreds of minds
[1:07:25] and he just took a deep breath and a
[1:07:27] woman capturing
[1:07:32] praise the lord
[1:07:34] and yes the bible says and gereza told
[1:07:37] his uh his master and says but i realize
[1:07:40] there is no there is no child making
[1:07:42] noise in this house i look all on the
[1:07:44] water i don't see no child photo
[1:07:49] praise the lord
[1:07:55] and there the the the god of creation
[1:07:58] gave them a promise by this time amen
[1:08:02] by this time
[1:08:04] and we know the story
[1:08:05] now but see how the whole thing is
[1:08:07] playing out here
[1:08:09] see the whole thing because i i mean you
[1:08:11] you grab the top there you see you
[1:08:13] appreciate what brother branham was
[1:08:15] speaking in that message now we know
[1:08:17] after time you know the the the woman
[1:08:21] you know enjoyed the baby and the baby
[1:08:23] growled and we we realized the boy
[1:08:25] passed away
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:34] and this woman
[1:08:36] never stewie in the community and says
[1:08:39] y'all see how the pastor then can lie
[1:08:41] that they like to bring problems on
[1:08:43] people
[1:08:44] or you know all these uh
[1:08:46] i mean this this this whole message is
[1:08:48] just a fake and and you know she never
[1:08:50] did that
[1:08:55] she never did that
[1:08:59] the death of her son never changed her
[1:09:02] attitude to the prophet
[1:09:07] praise the lord
[1:09:11] she took her hearts
[1:09:13] got on it and you know got down the road
[1:09:16] to go and find where the man of god is
[1:09:21] and as she was going out of the the
[1:09:23] compound and and people would greet her
[1:09:25] she says all is well
[1:09:28] always well
[1:09:30] praise the lord let me tell you if you
[1:09:32] are frustrated and angry there is no way
[1:09:34] you can say all as well
[1:09:38] if you have a bad attitude and people
[1:09:40] ask you how are you there is no way you
[1:09:42] can say all is well
[1:09:44] because those two things do not match
[1:09:47] all as well is coming from a peaceful
[1:09:49] and a relaxed spirit
[1:09:52] if you are angry in you you can't say
[1:09:55] all as well
[1:09:59] i challenge you try it
[1:10:07] a challenge you try you will see how
[1:10:09] much hypocrite you are
[1:10:14] praise the lord but she got down there
[1:10:16] to the prophet and she told the prophet
[1:10:18] everything now bring the prophet now in
[1:10:21] into her house
[1:10:24] you know uh uh uh uh elijah sent his
[1:10:27] staff and the woman says i will not
[1:10:29] leave you
[1:10:31] as long as your soul levitt
[1:10:34] praise the lord
[1:10:40] and later on the prophet when brother
[1:10:41] branham says the prophet was a little
[1:10:43] bit troubled because god didn't give him
[1:10:45] a vision god never told him anything
[1:10:47] that this thing was going to happen so
[1:10:48] he went down there but see what happened
[1:10:52] when he got into the room
[1:10:54] he took the little child
[1:10:57] and what he did
[1:10:58] he did exactly what god did to adam in
[1:11:01] genesis 1.
[1:11:07] he laid his head upon his head and nose
[1:11:09] upon the nose mouth upon the mouth and
[1:11:12] he breathed into the child
[1:11:17] because
[1:11:18] what was that inspiration
[1:11:21] because inspiration is the breath of god
[1:11:29] praise the lord
[1:11:31] amen
[1:11:32] you see and and that is the thing that
[1:11:34] makes the church live
[1:11:37] when the word of god come out of the
[1:11:39] pages
[1:11:41] when you can just be fried in the egg
[1:11:43] and the scripture gets out of the page
[1:11:45] to your mind it makes your morning
[1:11:47] better
[1:11:51] when you can be driving in your car and
[1:11:54] and a scripture can just come to your
[1:11:56] mind and make you to be nice to the
[1:11:58] other drivers on the road
[1:12:04] that's that's the thing that brings life
[1:12:06] to the christian it's not just keeping
[1:12:09] the book under your arm but the book
[1:12:10] coming alive
[1:12:13] the words coming out of the pages of the
[1:12:15] book
[1:12:24] praise the lord
[1:12:27] i've
[1:12:28] passed my eight minutes
[1:12:31] i've gone eight minutes past my eight
[1:12:33] minutes
[1:12:37] but branham says here sea of
[1:12:38] distributors say he said let the breath
[1:12:40] of god fall fresh
[1:12:42] into their hearts
[1:12:44] and let them know that
[1:12:46] time is running out
[1:12:49] oh if there is ever a time where the
[1:12:50] word of god must come life to us
[1:12:55] or the word of god
[1:12:57] i mean we have got our minds so so uh uh
[1:13:01] you know
[1:13:02] contaminated with all the era we pick
[1:13:04] error from here we pick error from there
[1:13:06] we pick air of them so everything just
[1:13:08] looks like error
[1:13:12] and just like i said that is the thing
[1:13:14] that is killing the fight in us
[1:13:17] we don't have nothing in us
[1:13:20] to fight
[1:13:24] because let me tell you if you don't
[1:13:26] stand for anything
[1:13:28] you will fall for everything
[1:13:33] you will fall for everything
[1:13:37] every lie that is said in the name of
[1:13:39] brother branham you will fall for it
[1:13:41] every lie that is said in the name of
[1:13:43] the scripture you will fall for it
[1:13:46] because people come and say things that
[1:13:48] you can you don't even find on tape
[1:13:56] but ram says
[1:13:57] let the breath of god fall fresh into
[1:13:59] their hearts
[1:14:02] and let them know
[1:14:03] that time is running out
[1:14:06] we are just
[1:14:09] a little while longer to be here
[1:14:13] then we are going to be with him
[1:14:17] who we love
[1:14:20] and may now his presence

[1:27:22] as we come forward so
[1:27:26] first corinthians chapter 11
[1:27:28] verse 23 for i have received of the lord
[1:27:31] that which also i deliver unto you
[1:27:35] that the lord jesus
[1:27:37] the same night in which
[1:27:39] he was betrayed took bread
[1:27:42] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:27:45] and said take it
[1:27:47] this is my body
[1:27:49] which was broken for you
[1:27:51] this dude in remembrance of me
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] after the same manner also he took the
[1:27:57] cup
[1:27:59] when he has stopped saying this cup
[1:28:02] is the new testament of my blood
[1:28:05] this due year as of as he drink it in
[1:28:08] remembrance of me
[1:28:11] for as often as he eat this bread and
[1:28:14] drink this cup yet to show the lord's
[1:28:16] death
[1:28:17] till he come
[1:28:19] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:28:22] and drink this cup of the lord on
[1:28:24] waterling
[1:28:26] shall be guilty of the body and the
[1:28:29] blood of the lord
[1:28:32] but let a man examine himself
[1:28:34] and so let him eat of their bread and
[1:28:37] drink
[1:28:38] of that cup
[1:28:40] for he eat it and drink it on walter
[1:28:42] live eatery and drink a damnation to
[1:28:44] himself
[1:28:46] not discerning the lord's body
[1:28:49] for this cause many are weak and sacred
[1:28:51] among you
[1:28:53] and many sleep
