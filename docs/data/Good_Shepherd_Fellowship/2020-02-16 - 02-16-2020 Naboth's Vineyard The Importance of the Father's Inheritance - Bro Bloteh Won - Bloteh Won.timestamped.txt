[21:43] hallelujah in Jesus mighty name
[21:53] bless you Saints
[21:59] I want to thank God for today and for
[22:02] the time he's given me to come and
[22:04] fellowship with you too and I know it's
[22:08] been three weeks with the weather it
[22:09] feels bad good that feeling you have
[22:12] when you come back for long can you come
[22:14] and see your brothers and sisters so I'm
[22:17] really happy to see you too
[22:18] I'd like to figure fumes we'll make a
[22:21] few announcements
[22:22] one is that we'll be sticking a special
[22:25] offering for our brother brother one we
[22:29] know he's lost his mom so to meet
[22:33] helping with the expenses and everything
[22:35] so what we'll do is that will
[22:38] I know this has been announced but we'll
[22:40] take a special offering and then you're
[22:42] gonna put it in this envelope once you
[22:46] put it back you can bring it back either
[22:47] next week or if you have it this week
[22:49] because it was announced that's fine so
[22:52] you can put in this envelope and bring
[22:54] it next time next Sunday or if you have
[22:56] it today just put it in the offering
[22:58] basket this would be separate from the
[23:00] normal offerings normally take during
[23:03] church services so we'll give you an
[23:05] offering as you walk out after the
[23:07] service and then yeah you can see uh so
[23:09] see the Dixon they could ask the Deacons
[23:11] or brother Steve and then you can hand
[23:15] it over to him the other thing
[23:18] in the same note we have a card in case
[23:23] you have not signed it
[23:24] it's a condolence card for him you can
[23:27] sign it and put it back I'll put it back
[23:30] there you can come and have it of his
[23:31] church services the other thing is
[23:37] one more announcement is that normally
[23:41] every January there we try to come up
[23:43] with a list or a schedule for cleaning
[23:45] the church service and this time I think
[23:48] we're a bit late please forgive us but
[23:50] we have the schedule ready and I've seen
[23:53] people have signed it a few brothers up
[23:58] a few families and we like it just would
[24:00] like to stress that it's not only for
[24:02] the families it's for every member of
[24:04] the church young and old families know
[24:07] families we've got to clean the church
[24:09] because we all use it so we try to come
[24:12] up with a schedule so that it becomes
[24:14] fair for each and every person so that
[24:17] we don't have one person or one family
[24:19] cleaning 4 times in a year which i think
[24:22] is not really fair because we clean it
[24:25] like four times a week four times a
[24:27] month every Saturday or Sunday anytime
[24:29] you can so I have the list
[24:34] it's normally on the notice board it
[24:38] looks like this and I came in today and
[24:43] I saw that there's a family who have
[24:45] signed up for four months straight which
[24:48] i think is unfair so we'll ask the
[24:52] family to give up the three and then
[24:55] I'll ask the church where was not signed
[24:58] please in case you can please sign up if
[25:02] you it doesn't have to be a full month
[25:04] it can be two weeks and then the other
[25:06] person or another person can sign two
[25:08] weeks so so we have the month covered so
[25:11] the Lord bless you that's the only
[25:13] announcement we had and I'll keep the
[25:16] envelopes or you get the envelopes us go
[25:18] out and then the card I'll keep it back
[25:20] there and in noticeboard god bless you

[40:10] name
[40:11] Thank You sweet Jesus the Lord bless you
[40:13] you may have your seat a many may praise
[40:18] the Lord
[40:19] I was staring during the week we want to
[40:21] greet each and every one of you in the
[40:23] name of the Lord Jesus praise the Lord
[40:25] is good to see each of us in the house
[40:29] of the Lord is this morning I was
[40:33] looking through the weekend studying a
[40:36] little bit I came across something that
[40:39] they're kind of caught my attention but
[40:44] something they had up looking to before
[40:47] and it's actually on this whole subject
[40:50] of praise and worship I see a gentleman
[40:53] back there I want to greet you in the
[40:54] name of the Lord Jesus good to have you
[40:56] visiting with us and I don't want to
[41:01] miss all our guests amen and people are
[41:05] coming to fellowship with us praise the
[41:08] Lord and actually what what what it was
[41:12] is there you know Genesis God said let
[41:21] us make man in our image and the
[41:26] scripture says that God image was male
[41:30] and female so it is it is something that
[41:34] expresses God he has a he has a male
[41:37] pattern himself he has a female pattern
[41:40] himself and in most cases through the
[41:43] scripture God revealed his female part
[41:46] most especially around Redemption
[41:49] because that that is that is the that is
[41:54] the sacred Veggie that was head in a
[41:56] woman there's a reason why he made man
[41:59] first and he had to put man to sleep
[42:02] because it was a hit him it was a hidden
[42:05] part of God redemption is always a
[42:08] hidden part of God he said Israel I will
[42:11] hover you like a hand we haver
[42:14] ho-young is there part of God but what I
[42:18] was looking at actually Jesus said in
[42:21] John chapter 4 they are the father's
[42:24] secret the truth worshippers and they
[42:28] they will worship the father in spirit
[42:29] and in truth and and also we see a
[42:34] 2-part there also and in this two part
[42:38] we can also see a male part and a female
[42:43] now you have to know that the wife is in
[42:54] an innocence she is that that emotional
[43:00] expression of the husband so if you
[43:05] bring this to this is that we are faced
[43:08] with a generation that is caught up you
[43:11] know a people that want to worship God
[43:13] but we are caught up in so much sounds
[43:16] and music praise the Lord and you a new
[43:24] year is a bit turn that is used around
[43:26] the church praise and worship you know
[43:29] praise and worship but if you look in
[43:32] the scripture you will realize and I was
[43:34] looking at that this week worship is a
[43:40] very beautiful thing and if you look in
[43:43] the scripture worship is the emotional
[43:47] part of praising God praises we express
[43:51] it with our lips we can express it in
[43:53] prayers we can express it as much a same
[43:57] game but when it comes to worship is
[43:59] where the person pour out their self is
[44:02] an expression it's a movement it's an
[44:07] expression I mean you you are expressing
[44:10] yourself you think about it like a
[44:12] person that there that there has a
[44:15] disability that they cannot speak but
[44:20] yet they can make you to understand what
[44:22] they are saying but their emotion
[44:26] and that's what worship is but we find
[44:33] ourself caught up in a place word you
[44:35] know people I mean and we thank God for
[44:39] beautiful musicians we have in our age
[44:42] and and I mean how how we have wonderful
[44:45] people in a band and all of that but we
[44:49] get stuck in there there sometimes it's
[44:52] hard for us to bring that inner
[44:54] expression to God where we can lift our
[44:59] hands where we can fall on our knees
[45:05] praise the Lord in Hebrew
[45:09] worship means to hang out there's a
[45:12] reason why in the in in in the Old
[45:16] Testament Tabernacle you always see the
[45:19] priests who pray with his hands lifted
[45:21] up it means to hang out amen
[45:30] it's an it's an emotional expression
[45:36] because our worship is to God and to God
[45:39] alone praise the Lord
[45:48] even when it came to the tabernacle
[45:50] where they fell on their knees it was a
[45:56] worship like Hannah she was right down
[45:58] there on her knees and this is there's
[46:02] another thing that I saw that is very
[46:03] beautiful in the scripture the the
[46:07] prophets it was common with him what
[46:10] they did is that they spread himself
[46:12] before God they lay on their face on the
[46:15] ground and that is the lowest American
[46:19] ever come there is nowhere beyond the
[46:21] ground either the grave so when the
[46:24] prophets were desperate and they were
[46:26] really needing to hear from God they lay
[46:29] their face on the ground the hour that
[46:32] is an expression of a heart that is
[46:35] desperate
[46:42] praise the Lord I remember years back
[46:46] that she beat around 1993 I was I was
[46:51] caught up because of things that were
[46:54] happening in the country in the fire and
[46:56] and and I had to go to a church you know
[46:59] it was a church of Pentacles man you get
[47:05] among those people when distress to
[47:09] worship the wrong here who was beside
[47:13] them I mean they get down the worship
[47:16] with tears coming from the eyes with
[47:19] expression I mean they cry to God is
[47:21] sing their song we have a generation of
[47:26] people that stuck their hands in their
[47:27] pocket and they are singing praises to
[47:30] God you don't know the God of Israel you
[47:36] don't know the Living God
[47:39] you're bluffing yourself you're not
[47:41] bluffing God praise the Lord
[47:47] and you look at the songs we think they
[47:52] all have expression amen
[47:55] but how many times are we are we really
[47:58] into the songs we think we are rather
[48:01] into the music than the songs
[48:06] praise the Lord that was just my own
[48:13] personal devotion amen
[48:14] I'm just sharing it with you I didn't
[48:17] have to but I just want to share with
[48:19] you a man because it blessed me so much
[48:24] praise the Lord amen
[48:28] you have to know what ship is a female
[48:30] part of God when I had really worship
[48:36] God
[48:36] it moves God it's like when a woman
[48:39] cries to her husband King has a serious
[48:46] has to step out of his chamber when it
[48:48] was not time for him to come because he
[48:51] heard Esther was crying needing him a me
[48:57] nothing will move God then the truth

[49:05] know I love you I love each and every
[49:08] one of you praise the Lord and thank you

[49:18] keeping us going they being of a
[49:20] strength in this time of need
[49:22] praise the Lord and and and I'm grateful
[49:31] I'm very grateful they're tough you know
[49:34] God will allow things to happen around
[49:37] our life that we'll be able to show us
[49:40] some part of our lives that we don't
[49:42] know you know I don't know what it is
[49:46] age but I want to just believe because
[49:48] this time is special for me I've never
[49:50] been emotionally very sensitive then
[49:54] this time very very sensitive and it's
[49:59] quick for me to laugh and it's called
[50:01] for me to cry praise the Lord
[50:03] but I would tell each and every one of
[50:05] you for all your prayers all your
[50:07] support I have but one wanted to go with
[50:10] meaning I call him I told him I said
[50:12] that was very special you know just to
[50:15] take the tour to want to go with me you
[50:17] know to a place that you have not been

[50:27] offering you know I was frying a dad for
[50:29] a bank but better dancer what I like

[50:37] Lord it means a whole lot to me it means
[50:41] a whole lot to me to see people like

[50:45] amen and and we do everything to be able
[50:49] to to stand by you I thank you and on
[50:52] behalf of our family and and there in
[50:57] the family back home I want to send send
[51:00] all our teams in appreciation to you
[51:02] people will be leaving in a week in this
[51:05] week mom's funeral will be on Saturday
[51:09] and I will tell you I'm not even pack a
[51:15] bag I have not packed anything I'm just
[51:18] so confused
[51:20] I'm so confused at that pack anything
[51:23] but I'm just trusting God there when
[51:25] that day comes I will be able to get the
[51:27] right thing to go I hope I carried it to
[51:29] choose the match I don't want to carry
[51:33] two different for the shoes praise the
[51:36] Lord Amen but I mean that's that just
[51:41] how this moment is for me and but we
[51:46] will be going away you leave you in the
[51:50] hands of the Lord and in the hands of
[51:53] able men that I able to take care of the
[51:55] church amen
[51:55] I never got to the place were at think
[51:58] there if I'm away this church will not
[52:00] survive if he ever gets to that place
[52:02] then I have failed in the ministry amen
[52:05] because God does not rely on human
[52:11] ability to take care of his church he
[52:13] men he empowers people but yet he's a
[52:16] sovereign God amen he's able to take
[52:20] care of his people praise the Lord Amen
[52:23] of hybrid brought jolly happiness with
[52:26] the sound in all of those things and we
[52:31] are not being able to
[52:32] to use him so we will have better jolly
[52:34] name but then speaking to us I don't
[52:38] know it but but Brooks will stay want to
[52:41] come and pay for his debt but you know I
[52:44] know that the brothers are able to take
[52:46] care of the church where we are gone
[52:48] there are some things that we would like
[52:50] to do when we get back so now we get
[52:54] back we would like to get back into
[52:56] serious business and trusting that the
[53:00] Lord will be able to prepare us for that
[53:03] time we have gone away from our our main
[53:06] breakfast meeting Bible studies that we
[53:14] used to do couple of years I was
[53:15] thinking for us to get back to death you
[53:18] know
[53:19] because it's one thing you know God said
[53:24] it out in you know in his in his in his
[53:27] plane in us and as biblical believers we
[53:29] believe that God please the man at that
[53:33] place as as as leaders and if the man in
[53:36] the church can now find their place of
[53:39] standing in the Word of God how are we
[53:41] going to lead our home if we can find
[53:43] our place of standing in the world and
[53:45] standing in prayer you know we have a
[53:50] society that is filling today because
[53:52] men are running from their
[53:54] responsibilities a lot of men that are
[53:56] having children and running in you know
[53:58] a bunch of them on child support and you
[54:00] can't even find and the government can't
[54:02] even find them and and and and I mean
[54:05] all of those things is is that is the
[54:07] thing that is killing the society you
[54:10] know because men's supposed to be at a
[54:13] place work God want them to be the wife
[54:17] the women are supposed to be a support
[54:19] they are they are help but it looks like
[54:21] a generation were because the man has
[54:25] failed so the woman is rising to power
[54:27] and there must not be the thing in the
[54:31] house of the Living God praise the Lord
[54:41] we have our our our our youth meeting
[54:44] and we already announced there so we are
[54:46] looking forward to death and last year
[54:51] we were not able to do the special
[54:53] things we do for couples we were looking
[54:56] forward I will be able to do that
[54:57] you know this year and then just there
[55:00] are just a lot of things on the plate
[55:02] that we have to do praise the Lord
[55:05] so you just pray for us and hopefully
[55:12] they'll be actually I'll be gone for two
[55:14] weeks some of the brothers are flying
[55:17] over from the Ivory Coast
[55:19] but Valentin and and one of his deacons
[55:22] who meet me in there and some of my
[55:25] friends are coming from Nigeria as well
[55:27] and but I told them I would not be able
[55:31] to to go with any one of them we got
[55:36] just a lot of calls from around the
[55:37] place the area we will stop by to visit
[55:40] with the brothers and and I don't think
[55:43] it should be a good time for us to do it
[55:46] and but if anything changed we will let
[55:49] you know
[55:50] praise the Lord amen and we'll be
[55:56] counting on your prayers I will not be
[55:58] traveling with my wife I would be going
[56:00] alone we were supposed to go together we
[56:04] have some changes in our program so just
[56:07] just keep us in your prayers
[56:09] praise the Lord keep us in your prayers
[56:12] we really need it and a lot of things I
[56:18] wanted to say that's not get up here I
[56:19] get nervous and it just flied away from
[56:21] my brain but we've been speaking on okay
[56:27] this is one of the things I wanted to
[56:29] say and Wednesday night we spoke about
[56:32] it a little bit and it's all from the
[56:35] place where we have heard over and over
[56:38] the rapture and faith are on those tapes
[56:43] praise the Lord
[56:45] and and and some people has taken it you
[56:51] know to to an extreme to
[56:54] means that you know we we must either
[56:56] get back to a tape ministry and just
[56:59] play tapes you know and play the Prophet
[57:02] tapes and all of that but I like I told
[57:07] my brother as well
[57:08] now we're not playing tapes you know we
[57:11] are playing it on our phone there is no
[57:15] code that's a rupture in faders on the
[57:17] phone you know we have all of these
[57:20] small SD card there is no code that's a
[57:23] rupture in faders on the SD card
[57:26] there is no fit that's a wrap I mean no
[57:28] code that's a rapture in faders on the
[57:30] computer you know so we have to
[57:33] understand what what you know what a
[57:37] prophecy instead of just being
[57:40] legalistic I think what he means is that
[57:43] like the scripture says faith cometh by
[57:47] hearing and hearing the Word of God so
[57:50] every time we listen to the message a
[57:53] quickens faith in our heart
[57:55] amen that if God who who discerned a
[57:59] person need on the on the tape God knows
[58:02] our need also and and and that is the
[58:06] thing that will prepare us for the
[58:10] rapture
[58:10] you know effect that is quicken effect
[58:13] that is expecting God to do something
[58:16] amen praise the Lord and because of all
[58:20] of those makes interpretation and
[58:22] understanding people are getting away
[58:24] from the tapes before I getting angry
[58:26] then you know it looks like we don't we
[58:28] don't understand it and and in all of
[58:31] those things so but as a church I will I
[58:34] will you know I will encourage that's
[58:36] the reason why I started speaking on the
[58:38] importance of the elijah ministry and
[58:41] because there are a lot of things that
[58:44] we want to remind ourself about you know
[58:49] and we were continuing to talk on there
[58:52] this morning i want to speak on never
[58:55] vania something they are also happening
[58:58] under the elijah ministry and that's
[59:02] what i would like to speak on this
[59:03] morning so
[59:06] beginning next month like we start to do
[59:09] last week we encourage you visit the
[59:12] church website we will be posting
[59:14] information there we also love to take
[59:17] you know a tip for the month that we
[59:20] would like to listen to and encourage
[59:22] you to listen to we will have it posted
[59:25] there you know and as we are talking on
[59:29] the Elijah ministry that was there
[59:31] something also I want to encourage you
[59:33] read the Kings amen read the Kings and
[59:39] the Kings really did--now started from
[59:41] first king or second king it started
[59:43] from the book of Samuel because it's in
[59:47] the book of summer that the people ask
[59:49] God for a king prays alone and they were
[59:55] giving their first King which was so so
[59:59] steady on the Kings why because the
[1:00:01] Kings the the books of the Kings hold
[1:00:06] what we were called a seven dispensation
[1:00:10] just like the seven church ages for
[1:00:13] Israel the book of the Kings hold a
[1:00:15] seven dispensation of of the Jewish
[1:00:19] church why they came to the place where
[1:00:22] they are today praise the Lord Amen the
[1:00:29] reason why the Jews are to the place
[1:00:32] where they are today is because from the
[1:00:34] birth of the king they rejected God as
[1:00:38] their king
[1:00:39] and they wanted to be like other nations
[1:00:45] amen they wanted to move into a counter
[1:00:49] for a Democratic leader leadership than
[1:00:52] a divine leadership praise the Lord
[1:00:57] since God called Abraham Genesis chapter
[1:01:01] 12 he has always been the leader of his
[1:01:04] people
[1:01:05] and he spoke and he raised up prophets
[1:01:08] he gave Joseph a dream that brought them
[1:01:11] to Egypt I mean he raised a prophet that
[1:01:14] won't like Moses
[1:01:19] on a divine car but when the God told
[1:01:23] the the the the God over there to the
[1:01:27] books of the Kings we started there in
[1:01:29] Samuel and these people are rejected
[1:01:33] God's leadership and that is the same
[1:01:37] with every church our church if we we
[1:01:41] reject God's leadership to be under the
[1:01:44] leadership of the Holy Spirit by the
[1:01:46] Word of God we are doing we will just be
[1:01:50] making things to happen that is the same
[1:01:53] where every family that is the same
[1:01:55] where every nation that was where Israel
[1:02:01] problem if you want to know the reason
[1:02:05] of the Holocaust go back to first King
[1:02:07] for Samuel that's the reason of the
[1:02:11] Holocaust that's the reason why people
[1:02:14] that God loved and people that God spoke
[1:02:18] about in his word had to suffer like
[1:02:20] this is all because they are rejecting
[1:02:23] God's leadership he's doing everything
[1:02:25] to pull them to their toe to himself and
[1:02:27] they keep rebelling against him because
[1:02:30] they want to be like others and the same
[1:02:34] thing for you if God set his love upon
[1:02:39] you there is nothing you can do about it
[1:02:45] David said it in the psalm he said we
[1:02:48] have suffer all of these things because
[1:02:51] you have loved us
[1:03:03] praise the Lord
[1:03:10] so let's read a little bit on the on the
[1:03:15] book of the Kings and where Wesley and
[1:03:20] sister caris they send their greetings
[1:03:23] they were following the service the
[1:03:26] other time and then when we first
[1:03:31] started talking on this subject and then
[1:03:36] sister Carol did a chat on on on the
[1:03:41] Kings because if you read the Kings
[1:03:43] because Ezra was plated ten tribes to
[1:03:47] Israel two trials were kept for Judah
[1:03:49] the way the information comes in the
[1:03:52] book of of the Kings is hard for you to
[1:03:55] know which King was the king of Israel
[1:03:57] and which King was the king of Judah
[1:03:59] because the information is blended in
[1:04:02] you know the Bible is not written in a
[1:04:06] book that is that is just so easy to
[1:04:08] understand because the Bible is
[1:04:11] understood by revelation go has to
[1:04:12] reveal it to you he has to open your
[1:04:15] understanding it's not just a newspaper
[1:04:17] that you can pick up from the street and
[1:04:19] read amen
[1:04:21] I heard about a science teacher you know
[1:04:24] that came to class and and then he was
[1:04:26] he was a new professor in in in a kind
[1:04:30] of her school that's supposed to be a
[1:04:32] Christian school and he told the
[1:04:34] students he says students is good to be
[1:04:38] here
[1:04:39] musicians you're sorry I thought we were
[1:04:41] going to sing before we study like I
[1:04:43] have already studied so god bless you
[1:04:45] may have a seat thank you amen yeah so
[1:04:49] he told the students he says he says
[1:04:51] well I've heard many of you people hold
[1:04:53] to your Christian faith you know em f's
[1:04:56] we're going to get into this subject I'm
[1:04:57] going to prove to you there is nothing
[1:05:00] about this thing that you believe it's
[1:05:02] just all the Bible I mean he was trying
[1:05:03] to trash the Bible and it's going to
[1:05:06] prove you know with all of these
[1:05:08] scientific things it is because I've
[1:05:11] read the Bible
[1:05:12] over and over
[1:05:13] I don't understand anything amen
[1:05:17] a little courageous young Christian boy
[1:05:22] put his hands up he said the teacher
[1:05:27] says yep what are you saying
[1:05:29] he says surf I believe that's what you
[1:05:31] get when you read other people's mill
[1:05:38] Amen praise the Lord if a mill is not
[1:05:42] addressed to you and you read it that's
[1:05:44] why you get you a now understand nothing
[1:05:48] praise the Lord
[1:06:05] amen so I hope I would not be reading
[1:06:12] other people's mail to you I hope it is
[1:06:15] your mail you mean
[1:06:16] [Laughter]
[1:06:20] praise the Lord amen amen but we just we
[1:06:25] just thank the Lord amen we just thank
[1:06:28] the Lord we are we are so grateful you
[1:06:31] know the Lord has been has been good to
[1:06:33] us as a body and I can say just like the
[1:06:37] Apostle Paul says said to the Corinthian
[1:06:42] church
[1:06:42] I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy
[1:06:45] amen and mine jealousy is that God would
[1:06:50] be able to bring us up as you know a
[1:06:53] biblical church in the book of Acts it
[1:06:56] speaks of how the church grew the church
[1:06:59] grew in numbers and the church also grew
[1:07:02] in the Word of God and I'm more
[1:07:04] interested in a church that is growing
[1:07:06] in the Word of God then a church that is
[1:07:09] just growing in numbers because to grow
[1:07:12] in numbers is so easily for the miss
[1:07:14] multitude to come alone and then trouble
[1:07:17] to begin amen
[1:07:18] but when we grow in the Word of God it's
[1:07:22] easy for us to be able to to pick up and
[1:07:25] as a church grow in the Word of God
[1:07:27] gifts is also birth among the people
[1:07:30] praise the Lord so we want to just thank
[1:07:33] the Lord for all of that and thank
[1:07:38] Berdan for the past services being
[1:07:40] wonderful but scared I appreciate all of
[1:07:43] those things praise the Lord this
[1:07:45] morning like I said I want to speak on
[1:07:47] neighbors then here that would be first
[1:07:50] came chapter 21
[1:07:52] if we would just stand to our feet we
[1:07:54] will read this will just be a little
[1:07:57] agitation this morning
[1:07:58] just to be able to encourage you and and
[1:08:04] then we will try to not keep you long so
[1:08:10] we can be back for the communion service
[1:08:12] tonight so never 21 I mean first came 21
[1:08:22] there is no book in a Bible core no
[1:08:25] never first came 21 praise the Lord
[1:08:34] first came 21
[1:08:44] and it came to pass after these things
[1:08:48] that never I will together amen
[1:08:56] came to pass after these things that
[1:08:58] neighbor the the the reared had a Vania
[1:09:03] which was in Syria had the palace of a
[1:09:11] hub of Samaria and a have speak unto
[1:09:14] neighbor saying give me in the Vania
[1:09:17] that I may have it for a garden of herbs
[1:09:23] because it is near unto my house and how
[1:09:27] we give thee for it a better than ya
[1:09:32] they need all if it seem good to be I
[1:09:36] will give thee the wall of it in money
[1:09:41] enables Iran to a have the law forbade
[1:09:44] it means that I should give the
[1:09:49] inheritance of my father's on today amen
[1:09:56] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we want
[1:10:02] to approach you this morning in the name
[1:10:05] of our Lord Jesus Christ father the only
[1:10:08] name given among men whereby we are safe
[1:10:11] and oh god I pray in acts the Lord you

[1:10:28] of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen
[1:10:32] praise the Lord the Lord bless you as he
[1:10:37] talks about never Vania the main
[1:10:44] inspiration this morning is from verse 3
[1:10:47] god forbid that I should gave the
[1:10:50] inheritance of my father's on today and
[1:10:54] that's what I want to talk about this
[1:10:56] morning the importance
[1:10:58] of the father's inheritance amen
[1:11:03] the importance of the father's
[1:11:06] inheritance the importance of keeping
[1:11:10] the landmark of the father's like a
[1:11:13] Solomon said and the importance of
[1:11:17] defending you know work what the the
[1:11:25] Apostolic fathers too far were the
[1:11:28] biblical fathers to for neighbors been
[1:11:30] yeah as we look into the life and
[1:11:34] history of Elisha we realize they are
[1:11:37] there are many there are many things
[1:11:39] that we could pick up here and I would
[1:11:41] do it on there and I want to speak a
[1:11:42] little bit on Jezebel when I get back
[1:11:44] but we want to talk about this man never
[1:11:48] and if you read history a little bit you
[1:11:52] will realize that he was a righteous man
[1:11:56] praise the Lord Amen and and and and in
[1:12:01] the history of Israel we see through the
[1:12:04] scripture that that was that was one of
[1:12:08] the things there was very very important
[1:12:11] to the Jews their inheritance amen
[1:12:19] the inheritance was very very important
[1:12:24] for the matter of fact a proves that you
[1:12:27] were part of the blessing of Abraham
[1:12:30] if you cannot be able to identify your
[1:12:33] inheritance it means that you are just a
[1:12:36] stranger praise the Lord
[1:12:51] and this inheritance was a Vania amen
[1:12:59] this inheritance was a Vania it was like
[1:13:05] a garden let me let me create a picture
[1:13:09] here so we can be able to see in the
[1:13:12] beginning when God created man the Bible
[1:13:18] says he created a place on the east side
[1:13:22] of Eden he created a garden and he put
[1:13:28] his son in that garden amen to take care
[1:13:35] of the gaudí amen
[1:13:38] now so you think about neighbors Vania
[1:13:43] you think about Adam's vineyard Adam in
[1:13:47] the Garden of Eden praise the Lord and
[1:13:52] then you see what I'm going to this
[1:13:54] morning a little bit by the help of the
[1:13:55] Holy Spirit the importance of defending
[1:14:01] the father's inheritance praise the Lord
[1:14:06] Amen because if you lost it you lost
[1:14:11] everything you might go off and start to
[1:14:18] build something on your own but a land
[1:14:24] that does not have a history and
[1:14:27] inheritance that you can now point back
[1:14:30] to what gives an inheritance value is
[1:14:34] how long it have been there praise the
[1:14:41] Lord
[1:14:42] are we together we know that it was a
[1:14:48] serious time in Israel it was a
[1:14:50] difficult time in Israel a very
[1:14:53] difficult time when Israel was facing a
[1:14:59] king that has gone to Mary
[1:15:06] from idol worshiper and now she's
[1:15:09] sitting and now they're bringing all
[1:15:11] this idolatry in Israel it was a
[1:15:13] difficult time and right in that time
[1:15:15] God sent a prophet Elijah out on the
[1:15:18] scene and he brought judgment upon the
[1:15:21] lane now as we stated that together the
[1:15:25] last time you will realize why never
[1:15:28] inheritance was attractive to a hub it's
[1:15:33] because he was thinking I mean with all
[1:15:38] of this all of this time of drought this
[1:15:42] guy Vania is still flourishing we had a
[1:15:48] drought for three years
[1:15:51] norine o my fruits are dry up but his
[1:15:55] Vania is still flourishing praise the
[1:15:59] Lord I mean he could look over his face
[1:16:09] all the little prey the beautiful flower
[1:16:12] is just growing up and sprinkle up he
[1:16:15] saw what was going on Amen God always
[1:16:23] preserve his people in the time of
[1:16:25] judgment he always blesses his people
[1:16:28] that was staying with his word staying
[1:16:31] with his promises the lamb can be dry as
[1:16:35] the desert he even promised Israel he
[1:16:39] will make roses to bloom in the desert
[1:16:43] that's God's blessing praise the Lord
[1:16:48] even though Israel is facing the time of
[1:16:51] judgment a difficult time but yeah here
[1:16:54] is a righteous man that I mean that
[1:16:59] cherish his father inheritance years of
[1:17:02] year is a righteous man that is that is
[1:17:05] trying to keep up the father's business
[1:17:08] and God is blessing him
[1:17:13] right in a time of drought god is
[1:17:16] blessing him their fruits on his barn
[1:17:19] and ibuprofen car coming they are
[1:17:32] wasting water to water it there was
[1:17:36] nothing you can do to keep yourself from
[1:17:37] God's judgment
[1:17:39] the scripture says unless the Lord keep
[1:17:43] the city unless the law build the house
[1:17:46] the Builder that builded he builded it
[1:17:49] in vain he had all of these things
[1:17:54] taking care of his Vania but yet the
[1:17:56] fruits update because when God takes
[1:18:02] life he take it from the roots just like
[1:18:07] Egypt in darkness and Gaussian is a city
[1:18:11] of light just imagine is a war that
[1:18:15] divided perhaps yeah from nervous Vania
[1:18:19] but this son is dead crops on the other
[1:18:22] side is flourishing praise the Lord
[1:18:28] a hob is looking for an excuse he want
[1:18:31] to break the wall so pretty soon he can
[1:18:34] tell all the people my my my crops are
[1:18:37] beautiful oh but he meets the wrong man
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] he meets the wrong man he said golf obey
[1:18:51] God forbid that I must trade my father
[1:18:56] in everything for money
[1:19:00] god forbid praise the Lord
[1:19:04] other people are feeling the same in you
[1:19:07] had this morning go for bait that I
[1:19:10] might trade this Holy Ghost experience
[1:19:14] praise the Lord
[1:19:16] god forbid that I'm a trade this Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost experience for popularity just for
[1:19:26] friendship that I might abuse this grace
[1:19:32] that God has given to me
[1:19:36] praise the Lord
[1:19:38] you remember in the Bible when those
[1:19:41] four daughter of zeref rights came to
[1:19:44] the elders of Israel because they wanted
[1:19:49] their father name he had only girls and
[1:19:54] by that time there was not a law in
[1:19:57] Israel for a woman to take her father's
[1:20:00] inheritance but those young women would
[1:20:04] not keep quiet and why were they
[1:20:07] fighting for their father name they were
[1:20:12] fighting for their father's name praise
[1:20:18] the Lord or definitely if they gets
[1:20:21] married yeah they would take the a
[1:20:23] husband name and the a father name would
[1:20:26] be swept under the rock but they wanted
[1:20:31] Elaine they wanted a cornerstone with
[1:20:33] your father name written on it they came
[1:20:35] to Israel he says they said he was he
[1:20:38] he's through with Moses he was now with
[1:20:40] the man that blaspheme this man was
[1:20:42] faithful to the Lord God of Abraham and
[1:20:46] are you going to tell me that our
[1:20:48] fathers name will just be weapon way
[1:20:51] because he don't have a son praise the
[1:20:55] Lord and the Bible says the others went
[1:20:59] to meet Moses just imagine this thing
[1:21:04] have always trailed me
[1:21:06] it was just before Moses who leave the
[1:21:11] scene why if Moses who have left the
[1:21:14] scene there will be more Lord in Israel
[1:21:18] for a woman to claim her father
[1:21:21] inheritance
[1:21:24] that time the law was written Moses when
[1:21:28] is sucked the face of God and God told
[1:21:31] him that they were right the father's
[1:21:38] name is important praise the Lord it's
[1:21:43] very important Moses came back to the
[1:21:53] others of Israel from the mountain and
[1:21:55] says the daughters of Zahra fights are
[1:21:58] right this is the Lord of God give them
[1:22:02] there give them the inheritance of their
[1:22:04] father and in the portion of inheritance
[1:22:07] they are only supposed to married a man
[1:22:09] from that tribe that the inheritance
[1:22:12] will not be mixed so the inheritance of
[1:22:17] each tribe will stay with that tribe
[1:22:21] that was the condition of keeping the
[1:22:25] father's in everything praise the Lord
[1:22:28] if you take this Holy Ghost gospel to a
[1:22:31] man that don't have the Holy Ghost you
[1:22:33] are wasting the father in everything's
[1:22:34] because he would not respect your Holy
[1:22:36] Ghost believe he would not respect your
[1:22:41] garlic stand for the word of God praise
[1:22:47] the Lord and we together
[1:22:53] the father's inheritance that's what I
[1:22:55] want to encourage you with this morning
[1:22:57] don't trade it for nothing because this
[1:23:02] joy that I have no one gave it to me and
[1:23:06] no one can take it away praise the Lord
[1:23:12] Amen just like a cause never his life a
[1:23:22] cross in his life but he rather died
[1:23:26] than to compromise he rather died and to
[1:23:30] trail the father inheritance give it to
[1:23:33] adulterer adulterers
[1:23:40] fresh law that's how important it is
[1:23:48] right honor the enlarged administrate
[1:23:51] again we've seen and not a man because
[1:23:54] it's a Ministry of restoration so just
[1:23:58] like we take a time over in in in in
[1:24:01] Genesis when Adam forfeited the father's
[1:24:09] inheritance and God has to drive him out
[1:24:14] of the garden praise the Lord
[1:24:21] he's trying to make an excuse the woman
[1:24:24] that you gave me God said you should
[1:24:31] know better son
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:35] you should know better your love for God

[1:24:43] wife praise the Lord I'm gonna go away
[1:24:47] the February 25 will be it would be 20
[1:24:58] years the day that I made a vow to my

[1:25:38] Lord
[1:25:39] we have had a lot of history in our
[1:25:45] journey like some of you people know
[1:25:47] praise the Lord and separated for many
[1:25:54] years in order there but there the
[1:25:57] avowal has helped us going and february
[1:26:01] 25 will be 20 years since i'm emma vow
[1:26:10] praise the Lord but what was I saying
[1:26:16] because I think that's the place where
[1:26:19] it begins love the Lord your God with
[1:26:21] all of your heart all of your soul out
[1:26:25] of your mind out of your strength
[1:26:27] that's where it begins and then love
[1:26:31] your neighbor your wife will be your
[1:26:34] first neighbor amen love your neighbor
[1:26:38] as yourself
[1:26:41] praise the Lord
[1:26:43] love your neighbor as yourself praise
[1:26:46] the Lord
[1:26:48] amen you know like someone said he says
[1:26:52] he said God became our neighbor when God
[1:26:54] took on flesh and he decided to come and
[1:26:57] live and feel the things that we go
[1:26:59] through amen he became our neighbor
[1:27:03] praise the Lord
[1:27:05] so neighbor is seen in many different
[1:27:07] ways but she would be the closest
[1:27:10] neighbor you will ever have amen praise
[1:27:13] the Lord because your neighbors will
[1:27:16] only know what is in your driveway but
[1:27:18] this neighbor will know what is in your
[1:27:19] mind glory be to God where am I going
[1:27:30] with all of these things
[1:27:34] hey it's Adam excuse that protein out of
[1:27:38] these things
[1:27:41] the wife that you have given me praise
[1:27:45] the Lord amen
[1:27:48] but that's that's what we want to look
[1:27:51] at here he forfeited the inheritance
[1:27:53] that God give him to have dominion over
[1:27:57] the earth he was to have dominion over
[1:28:01] the earth
[1:28:02] this is the man that God gave the Beauty
[1:28:05] to name these animals name this plant he
[1:28:08] could call them by name they were
[1:28:10] listening to him he forfeited that
[1:28:12] inheritance praise the Lord
[1:28:16] can you imagine the first day that
[1:28:22] disorder when Adams seen it against God
[1:28:25] the lion will raise his voice for the
[1:28:28] first time against another animal can
[1:28:35] you just imagine the chaos that was in
[1:28:37] the garden when man fell from the Word
[1:28:39] of God all the animals were running now
[1:28:42] they're afraid of one another they are
[1:28:44] all running all over the place
[1:28:46] Adam is confused he had never seen that
[1:28:48] before
[1:28:50] but what happened is because he fell he
[1:28:56] left God a day in everything that God
[1:28:58] gave him
[1:29:08] praise the Lord but here is another man
[1:29:18] honor an elijah ministry another man
[1:29:24] honor an Elijah ministry that would
[1:29:27] rather die for his his father
[1:29:30] inheritance he would not be intimidated
[1:29:33] by a Jezebel he would not be intimidated
[1:29:37] by an a hub he said god forbid that I
[1:29:43] gave my father inheritance
[1:29:46] Golf Abed praise the Lord I mean we such
[1:29:57] a pressure on this age social pressure
[1:30:00] on Christian life is so easy for us to
[1:30:05] compromise so easy for us to give up so
[1:30:08] easy for us to tell a lie just because
[1:30:13] of favor just because of friendship
[1:30:22] it's so easy for us to let go of those
[1:30:28] values because we don't want people to
[1:30:30] think that we are all timers and we
[1:30:32] don't want people to think that I ever
[1:30:35] will and we let go so easily the
[1:30:44] inheritance of the fathers
[1:30:51] praise the Lord I can also bring that in
[1:30:59] the type with King and AVL but I will
[1:31:05] bring something here so you realize
[1:31:09] let's look down over in in verse 17
[1:31:17] since this is just an agitation and what
[1:31:22] I'm encouraging you for this morning is
[1:31:24] to contend for the faith amen
[1:31:28] our faith must not be on whoever is our
[1:31:32] pastor the Wawa Church we go so we must
[1:31:34] have a faith based on God's Word the law
[1:31:37] that we have for God the Bible says and
[1:31:47] the word of the Lord came to Elijah the
[1:31:49] Tishbite saying arise go down to meet a
[1:31:52] king of Israel wishes in Samara behold
[1:31:56] he is in the vania or never whether he
[1:32:01] gone down to possess it now what caught
[1:32:06] my attention here is that God is going
[1:32:08] to George sing where sin is committed
[1:32:14] when Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:16] God met him right there he's going to
[1:32:21] condemn sin were sin is committed right
[1:32:26] in the vania or never thus that was were
[1:32:29] a half tall Elijah to a hug just like
[1:32:34] the blood lake are the dogs like the
[1:32:37] blood of never the dogs are going to
[1:32:40] lick your blood praise the Lord
[1:32:44] do you know why after the general
[1:32:47] resurrection we will have to come back
[1:32:49] to the earth the Whiterun judgment will
[1:32:51] be right down here because this is where
[1:32:53] sin was committed
[1:32:56] God will raise every dead in the seed
[1:32:59] every dead in the grave and whatsoever
[1:33:01] was done in this body would be Jorge
[1:33:03] right here that's the reason why Peter
[1:33:06] tells us that Josh meant for the
[1:33:08] believer begins in the house of God
[1:33:10] let's use the word of God and Porsche I
[1:33:13] was said let's seek God's mercy whereby
[1:33:16] we are passed from judgment unto life
[1:33:25] he never waited for another day said get
[1:33:29] up Elijah go and meet him he's right in
[1:33:32] nervous Vania praise the Lord
[1:33:40] the Father inheritance that that that
[1:33:45] that is the story of the prodigal son
[1:33:48] why was he why was that why was the
[1:33:51] father kept looking for his son because
[1:33:53] he went with an inheritance of the
[1:33:55] father and he being a son
[1:33:58] he's also an inheritance of the father
[1:34:02] praise the Lord even though he has
[1:34:05] lavished all the gifts that was giving
[1:34:08] him but there was alive there was a
[1:34:09] bloodline in him that the father never
[1:34:13] wanted to loss
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:18] praise the Lord why Christ had to died
[1:34:21] on the cross to redeem God's inheritance
[1:34:25] you and myself praise the Lord
[1:34:36] if you go back into the book of Joshua
[1:34:40] or the book of Deuteronomy when the
[1:34:42] Bible speaks of inheritance there are
[1:34:46] two things that was very prominent it
[1:34:51] was life in the lane he meant God called
[1:35:01] the children and inheritance when if
[1:35:06] when a when a man had to sell his child
[1:35:09] in in in slavery that was what the
[1:35:13] Jubilee was for there are any heritage
[1:35:16] that was so in slavery could be redeemed
[1:35:18] and the next thing that could be
[1:35:21] redeemed was Elaine praise the Lord oh
[1:35:28] man I'm feel like preaching this morning
[1:35:30] but I'm saying I will not preach praise
[1:35:36] the Lord
[1:35:36] hey man glory be to God amen there's
[1:35:43] nothing in the scripture that talks
[1:35:44] about a car being an inheritance or
[1:35:46] talks about a beggar can't be an
[1:35:48] inheritance a man can have look look
[1:35:50] look even at a job when his trials were
[1:35:58] coming on him what was in the most
[1:36:02] inheritance they moved the Prophet his
[1:36:07] children in life that was lost
[1:36:13] praise the Lord
[1:36:15] when they came into him job your
[1:36:17] conscience is gone
[1:36:18] he said well okay well that's that's
[1:36:20] fine job this other one is gone but when
[1:36:22] it told him job all your children are
[1:36:24] gone the Bible say he told his claws he
[1:36:27] told them apart amen
[1:36:30] he got right to word he was making his
[1:36:32] burnt offering he took the arches and he
[1:36:35] just wave it over his head because a
[1:36:40] life has been lost
[1:36:50] and we want to limit this gospel to
[1:36:53] material things then the saving of life
[1:36:57] the purpose of the gospel is for the
[1:37:00] saving of life praise the Lord
[1:37:05] and then God would take care of your
[1:37:07] well-being are we together just give me
[1:37:14] a few minutes here I will let you go
[1:37:17] the father inherit things like we said
[1:37:22] Wednesday night Israel had a physical
[1:37:25] inheritance but the Gentiles we have
[1:37:30] been given spiritual inheritance amen
[1:37:39] but one I was caught up his few days
[1:37:42] into the story of Geronimo I don't know
[1:37:46] how I got in that but I went to a trade
[1:37:50] store and I bought some books from the
[1:37:52] West you know why I wish you just got to
[1:37:58] pray for me they mean and then I was
[1:38:03] reading about those Indians then I got
[1:38:06] caught up into the story of Geronimo so
[1:38:10] I decided to go on Amazon and bought his
[1:38:13] biography oh my goodness me oh my
[1:38:17] goodness me hey men praise the Lord
[1:38:21] amen we can bring that home amen because

[1:38:29] it's an Indian Territory praise the Lord
[1:38:33] this very city where we are glory be to
[1:38:38] God but you know what what kind of a
[1:38:41] movement what what movement is there the
[1:38:43] courage that he talked the courage he
[1:38:48] talked it was not because of himself it
[1:38:52] was because of his people
[1:38:55] most especially when his parents were
[1:38:58] killed fighting for the father's
[1:39:04] inheritance that God gave him
[1:39:08] inheritance that was the same thing that
[1:39:16] moves Shem God in the book of Job in the

[1:48:26] see the things that were happening in
[1:48:28] the church and you read your Bible if
[1:48:30] this God is still the same God then let
[1:48:33] he come on the scene and do the same
[1:48:35] thing that is the thing that must trade
[1:48:40] our heart if this is if there's the seal
[1:48:42] of God that is that we read about in
[1:48:44] this Bible if he is the same God then
[1:48:48] leahy come on the scene and do the same
[1:48:50] works instead of making excuses we are

[1:50:14] it's a gift
[1:50:16] there are times in the people that wake

[1:50:20] praying is and for you to have the
[1:50:24] burden in your heart for you to have an
[1:50:27] urge to pray you must see there as a
[1:50:30] gift and you must put value on that
[1:50:34] inheritance the Word of God it's being
[1:50:43] trash people trying to rewrite the Bible
[1:50:47] to fit the poeple of veal where we can
[1:50:52] be able to accept out of all of the the
[1:50:54] garbage that is age is bringing us into
[1:50:58] the house of God you better go back and
[1:51:02] find out all rugged cross praise the
[1:51:07] Lord
[1:51:09] there I read the Bible down and down I
[1:51:12] don't understand that down and down

[1:51:19] now your meal praise the Lord
[1:51:23] you're reading somebody's SS meal amen
[1:51:28] oh yeah when I put a tip on I don't even
[1:51:31] understand what the Prophet is saying
[1:51:32] well
[1:51:38] you know what I'm going with that but
[1:51:44] there are things to fight for people
[1:51:47] there are things to fight for praise the
[1:51:51] Lord I was listening to to an auditor
[1:51:56] and he was thinking that the China of
[1:52:01] you know in our age and things you know
[1:52:05] we pray for things and we ask God for
[1:52:09] things and it gets to the place like if
[1:52:12] we are not saying these things we we now
[1:52:15] take another rod and we make excuses
[1:52:18] praise the Lord
[1:52:21] but God answered we have to believe that
[1:52:24] he's an own time God do you know that
[1:52:30] many of the benefits we have throughout
[1:52:32] the revival men that has prayed to see
[1:52:35] God on the same God never came in that
[1:52:38] generation but a generation after
[1:52:41] benefit from their prayers praise the
[1:52:46] Lord the prayer we pray for our loved
[1:52:50] ones and we pray for our children they
[1:52:53] are not going under the rock for God
[1:52:55] does not have a rock amen praise the
[1:53:00] Lord the Bible say he has a bottle where
[1:53:02] he put our tears into a bottle he does
[1:53:07] not have rocks when we go before God and
[1:53:10] we cry he got our tears into a bottle
[1:53:13] and he said it before him as a
[1:53:15] remembrance you might not be here but
[1:53:22] when God look at those tears in the
[1:53:26] bottle of remembrance praise the Lord
[1:53:31] 400 years before God will answer
[1:53:34] Abraham prayer he will come down and
[1:53:38] deliver Israel in the land of Egypt
[1:53:46] there are things to fight for they are
[1:53:50] values to fight for praise the Lord
[1:53:58] just because we are lazy amen we are
[1:54:04] just so lazy
[1:54:05] I mean prayer is the thing that we don't
[1:54:08] want to do amen
[1:54:10] we get so used to the microwave and a
[1:54:13] washing machine and all of that and we
[1:54:15] want to make prayer like a microwave
[1:54:20] just put it in their trash tree and it
[1:54:23] gets warm and then you can start you can
[1:54:25] start eating the benefit of your prayers
[1:54:26] it does not work like that remain praise
[1:54:34] the Lord the Bible says a contract
[1:54:37] spirit God will not despise when the
[1:54:43] thing you are praying for has become so
[1:54:45] burning to you that you can break your
[1:54:48] heart to make you cry not the dry eye
[1:54:55] confession and the 50 minutes prayer
[1:55:02] when the thing that is serious that you
[1:55:05] think a serious will break your heart
[1:55:08] and make you cry that you can Auto worse
[1:55:11] but just cry that's when you get God's
[1:55:16] attention because a broken heart and a
[1:55:21] contract spirit the scripture says he
[1:55:23] will not despise which caught up in this
[1:55:30] age Cara mastic age where we become
[1:55:39] aggressive on God with no wisdom law you
[1:55:46] have to answer my prayers Lord you have
[1:55:48] to you have to when you're not even
[1:55:52] thinking on God as you are saying those
[1:55:54] things your mind is somewhere completely
[1:55:56] different you're thinking about the Ness
[1:55:58] Avenue
[1:55:59] where to go to get this thing answered
[1:56:05] but a contract spirit will you sit in
[1:56:10] your chamber with God alone praise the
[1:56:17] Lord the Old Testament prophets a man of
[1:56:25] all that sucked the face of God you know
[1:56:27] what they will do sometimes they're not
[1:56:29] even able to pray they will write their
[1:56:31] prayers and it would stick it on a tree
[1:56:35] or they'll write their prayers and all
[1:56:38] in your prayer chamber you see prayers
[1:56:40] on the wall different expression because
[1:56:46] you know what
[1:56:47] that's a principle when it's written
[1:56:50] when it is written it sticks praise the
[1:56:58] Lord
[1:56:59] that's the reason why that's that's a
[1:57:03] very big principle of diary writing job
[1:57:08] said that my words were written in a
[1:57:10] book if it was narrating we would have
[1:57:14] never known what happened to job we will
[1:57:22] have never known what happened to job
[1:57:31] praise the Lord sometimes you're reading
[1:57:35] you your study in your Bible and I mean
[1:57:37] you're reading something and you
[1:57:38] enjoying the word and the spirit is
[1:57:40] ministering to you but yet we don't take
[1:57:43] notes you won't write it down and if you
[1:57:46] don't write it down it don't stick
[1:57:50] praise the Lord
[1:57:52] amen you think about your shopping list
[1:57:55] if you go into shopping you get all of
[1:57:58] these things on your mind if you don't
[1:57:59] write it down you get right back to the
[1:58:02] house oh I forget
[1:58:18] sometimes the heart is burning is there
[1:58:22] burden on your heart and God is dealing
[1:58:28] with you in a channel of thought it can
[1:58:35] be as simple as simple as God so love
[1:58:41] the word you can think about God so love
[1:58:44] the word and you just think about God
[1:58:46] goodness to you it just becomes so real
[1:58:50] to you
[1:58:51] those moment are very special if you
[1:58:57] write it down put a date to a just put a
[1:59:03] little note to it and sometimes when God
[1:59:06] do things in your life you can come back
[1:59:09] to the book of diary
[1:59:11] that's how the Old Testament prophet
[1:59:13] does whenever God does something to go
[1:59:15] back to the book to see where is he
[1:59:17] writing this Bible is God's diary that
[1:59:25] he have used the prophets to write
[1:59:26] throughout the ages
[1:59:35] praise the Lord
[1:59:39] the father's inheritance

[2:00:55] just the same thing we do we don't make
[2:00:57] time to listen to God if you believe
[2:01:00] that God speaks you make time to listen
[2:01:04] after you have spoken give God time to
[2:01:08] speak praise the Lord
[2:01:12] or maybe you said when I get there I
[2:01:14] mean when I stop my mind is just growing

[2:01:54] never compromise
