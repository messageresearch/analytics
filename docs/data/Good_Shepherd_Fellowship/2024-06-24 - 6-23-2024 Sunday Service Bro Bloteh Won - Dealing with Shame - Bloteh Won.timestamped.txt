[49:41] I was not thinking about that song but
[49:43] there's a phrase in that song and uh uh
[49:47] that I never thought about until I
[49:49] started singing it the second time and
[49:52] the reason is
[49:54] because uh I I just believe that it was
[49:57] maybe by the uh uh inspiration of the
[50:01] Holy Ghost that brother Lawrence uh uh
[50:04] you know sang that song this
[50:08] morning this this has been couple of
[50:11] years I can't remember now this would be
[50:14] uh a few years now uh maybe four or five
[50:20] years I was I was uh dealing with a
[50:24] situation I was working with some folks
[50:28] and uh uh and I was I was studying one
[50:33] day but what in my studed I was thinking
[50:35] on a certain
[50:37] situation and the thought came to me
[50:40] about the thought of dealing with
[50:45] shame so I wrote that down on my Note
[50:50] and one of my note
[50:52] part and and the lord gave me uh uh some
[50:56] inspiration on the thought I wrote it
[50:58] down and I prayed over it and I said
[51:01] Lord if uh you know at at the time you
[51:03] would want me to talk about this uh it
[51:06] would be good for me to talk about it I
[51:09] it's a good thought and you know my my
[51:11] mind was was just going on and where my
[51:15] thought was actually was uh uh uh how do
[51:20] we deal with
[51:21] shame how do we deal with
[51:25] shame and uh
[51:28] uh how how do we deal with
[51:31] shame how do we uh
[51:36] uh and shame is something that we all
[51:39] deal with we all go
[51:41] through so uh
[51:46] um speaking on
[51:49] uh uh teachers how to pray on Wednesday
[51:52] night and
[51:54] uh I was praying and and just thinking
[51:58] about some other things and then the
[51:59] thought came back to my
[52:01] mind but really what it is is that when
[52:05] I think about it this
[52:07] morning I I'm I'm trusting the Lord to
[52:09] be able to bring this not like a
[52:12] preaching but bring this like a like a
[52:15] prayer meeting this morning where each
[52:18] and every one of us can be able to uh uh
[52:23] identify ourself with the word and uh uh
[52:27] because this is concerning every one of
[52:30] us amen you know the beautiful thing
[52:32] about the house of the Lord is that uh
[52:36] uh this is a place
[52:38] where
[52:45] uh oh I thought I seent
[52:48] it
[52:50] okay okay they said don't have my notes
[52:53] it makes it easy
[52:58] if I preach with our notes then it's a
[53:00] short
[53:03] service praise the
[53:05] Lord
[53:07] amen sorry I don't I don't even have
[53:09] much yet I just have few few uh of
[53:12] course I will be I'll be reading a whole
[53:14] lot uh from different things that uh I
[53:17] was studying through the week and just
[53:20] to just share that with you this is the
[53:22] kind of a subject word I would like to
[53:24] do on a retreat or like to do on a
[53:28] convention you know like there kind of a
[53:30] convention in uh South Africa where they
[53:33] allow you to preach in the morning in
[53:35] the evening in the morning in the
[53:36] evening in the morning in the evening
[53:38] until you tell them you can't preach
[53:40] anymore praise the Lord because I don't
[53:43] believe that we can just use one service
[53:46] to be able to deal with this but where
[53:48] my thought is on this subject is that if
[53:52] there is one
[53:54] hindrance that the church
[53:58] has it is the hindrance of how we deal
[54:02] with
[54:03] shame if there is one thing that is
[54:06] limiting us in our
[54:08] potential is because of
[54:12] Shame praise the
[54:15] Lord and uh uh and just like I said I I
[54:20] hope that I can be able to be able to
[54:22] bring it in a way this morning that it
[54:25] can be uh you know a blessing a blessing
[54:30] to to you and to myself because I need
[54:34] it praise the Lord amen so uh now to
[54:39] take much of the time as a lot of the
[54:42] time has gone we will stand to our feet
[54:44] and turn to the word of God we will read
[54:47] from the book of
[54:49] second
[54:51] Samuel we'll read second Samuel
[55:07] you know this this subject will almost
[55:09] be like one time ago I preach on the
[55:13] message on uh on
[55:15] abuse somehow go Hy hen and I started it
[55:19] year thinking that I was really going to
[55:21] do do do a series on it and I've never
[55:24] come back to it I appreciate two other
[55:27] places one in DC and one in uh North
[55:31] Carolina hasy that uh uh uh brother lar
[55:36] is there and then uh since that time
[55:39] I've not been able to come back to it
[55:42] but
[55:44] uh
[55:46] uh I know few few Saints have reached
[55:50] out to me from from different places
[55:52] that were able to stream it online
[55:56] and uh said it was a
[55:59] blessing so 2 Samuel chapter
[56:02] 10 2 Samuel chapter
[56:06] 10 let's read from verse 1
[56:09] to5 2 Samuel chapter 10 we'll read from
[56:13] verse 1 to
[56:16] 5 and it came to pass after this that
[56:20] the king of the children of armor
[56:23] died and H his son
[56:27] rain in his
[56:29] stad then said David I will show
[56:32] kindness unto hand of the son of
[56:35] nshi as his father showed kindness unto
[56:38] me and David sent to comfort him by the
[56:43] hand of his servants for his
[56:47] father and David servant came into the
[56:49] land of the children of
[56:52] an and uh of amor and the princes of the
[56:56] church children of amama said unto uh
[56:59] Hano the Lord their lord think thou that
[57:02] David does honor thy father that he has
[57:07] sent comforters unto thee have not David
[57:13] rather send his servants unto thee to
[57:16] search the city and to spy
[57:19] it and to overthrow
[57:22] it wherefor Hannah took David's servants
[57:25] and shave of one half of their beard
[57:30] praise the Lord you know how the Jewish
[57:33] beard is it's a fullface beard that
[57:37] comes down and they shave only one
[57:40] half and leave the other one here praise
[57:44] the
[57:45] Lord I just want to give you give you
[57:48] some picture in your mind that you can
[57:49] be able to deal with this
[57:53] morning he took David's servants and
[57:55] shaved off
[57:57] the one half of their beard and cut off
[58:01] their garment in the
[58:04] middle even to their
[58:08] buts and send them
[58:13] away when they tore it unto
[58:16] David he sent to meet them because the
[58:20] men were greatly
[58:23] ashamed and the King said T at Jericho
[58:28] until your beard be grown and then
[58:34] return praise the
[58:37] Lord let's pray one more time
[58:40] father Lord you know how nervous I am
[58:44] this morning and every time lord father
[58:47] because Lord and of human ability Lord I
[58:52] don't have Lord to be able to bring your
[58:54] word this morning I'm trusting on the
[58:56] inspiration of the Almighty I say father
[59:00] will you come breathe upon us this
[59:03] morning let something be said Lord that
[59:06] will edify your children something oh
[59:09] God that will be able to draw us closer
[59:12] to you father I pray oh God beyond all
[59:17] of my notes Lord scripture quotes and
[59:20] things we wrote down things we search
[59:23] out to Father Lord will do us no good
[59:27] until you come and take it this
[59:29] morning and father use it to be able to
[59:33] address things in our life we love you
[59:37] and we appreciate you in Jesus name we
[59:40] pray amen amen the Lord bless you you
[59:44] may have your seat
[59:47] amen praise the
[59:51] Lord what a scripture what an
[59:54] experience now now uh uh let's let's go
[59:58] over to
[59:59] Second
[1:00:07] uh let's go over to second Samuel let me
[1:00:11] let me be very sure here
[1:00:15] um or else I might have written down the
[1:00:18] wrong U scripture yeah
[1:00:31] praise the
[1:00:33] Lord now
[1:00:40] uh second Samuel chapter
[1:00:52] 17 now in 2 Samuel chapter 17 you look
[1:00:56] in verse 26 you realize that this was a
[1:01:00] time where David was getting away from
[1:01:03] his son Absalon when Absalon has ruled
[1:01:08] uh taken his father off the throne and
[1:01:11] David year getting away from Absalon he
[1:01:14] will meet one of the son of
[1:01:16] nemi which is uh uh shba if that's the
[1:01:21] right pronunciation of the name and uh
[1:01:25] uh
[1:01:27] and then they will they would take David
[1:01:29] in uh in verse 20 27 and 28 and the
[1:01:33] brought bed and Basin and eting vessel
[1:01:36] and wheat and ballet and flour parh corn
[1:01:39] and banss and letters and and and and
[1:01:43] and honey butter sheep and cheese and
[1:01:46] and all of those things so they took
[1:01:48] care of David so you I'm I'm I'm saying
[1:01:51] this because uh I I was I was going back
[1:01:54] in the scripture to see
[1:01:56] uh uh why David wanted to show
[1:02:01] kindness uh after n she has
[1:02:05] died and I realized on on another event
[1:02:08] again uh uh uh when David was running
[1:02:12] away from Saul uh the Bible say he took
[1:02:15] his mother and his father over to the
[1:02:18] land of of of of the Moab the moabites
[1:02:21] and he told the king to keep his mother
[1:02:24] let his mother and his father stay there
[1:02:27] in safety he he don't want them running
[1:02:29] in the rocks and doing all of this high
[1:02:31] and seek that he was doing from Saul so
[1:02:34] uh it gave us a picture to realize that
[1:02:39] uh uh David he had help he had kindness
[1:02:45] kindness was shown David during the time
[1:02:49] of of his AI during the time he was
[1:02:51] running you know from one country to
[1:02:54] another running away from s all there
[1:02:56] were some of these kings that were that
[1:02:58] were nice to David some of them were
[1:03:00] very nice and I believe it is one of the
[1:03:03] reason why David here is uh is is is uh
[1:03:07] trying to go and show condolence you
[1:03:10] know after this King has died but now
[1:03:15] the man uh uh uh his men uh uh uh
[1:03:19] misunderstood David kindness his his
[1:03:22] guesture and then they T that uh he had
[1:03:25] sent his men on recuring so in their
[1:03:29] mind David has sent his men to spar out
[1:03:32] the land so they will attack them and uh
[1:03:36] and and this is the way that they
[1:03:38] handled David seven shave up their beard
[1:03:41] toore their clothes expose their
[1:03:43] nakedness and then send them out of the
[1:03:45] you know what what what a disgrace you
[1:03:48] know now it is one think I mean going
[1:03:51] away from those people they might never
[1:03:53] come back there you know but how are
[1:03:56] they going to deal with their presenting
[1:03:59] themselves to their wives and their
[1:04:01] children so David taugh there okay I'm
[1:04:04] going to keep you here in Jericho stay
[1:04:07] in Jericho until you know uh your beer
[1:04:10] can grow you know I'm sure David brought
[1:04:13] new clothes for them and their clothes
[1:04:15] were Chang and all of that praise the
[1:04:18] Lord now so uh uh uh uh as we look as we
[1:04:22] look into this this morning I'm just I'm
[1:04:25] just only trying to go through the
[1:04:27] scripture reading here as I'm uh you
[1:04:30] know um um kind of uh struggling through
[1:04:34] my nervousness to be able to bring this
[1:04:36] to you but I believe that uh uh I mean
[1:04:40] uh with the help of the Lord uh he will
[1:04:43] help us to be able to say something that
[1:04:44] will be edifying encouraging to you this
[1:04:47] morning praise the Lord now so when you
[1:04:51] look at this subject uh of uh of of
[1:04:55] dealing with shame shame in itself is a
[1:04:58] is a very big subject but the the
[1:05:02] blessing is
[1:05:03] that uh
[1:05:07] yesterday
[1:05:08] uh studying and and looking into the
[1:05:11] word because when you when you think
[1:05:14] about
[1:05:15] shame it's it's so easy for us to think
[1:05:19] or look at the negative part of Shame
[1:05:22] Shame has always come from a negative
[1:05:25] because the truth about the matter that
[1:05:28] is
[1:05:29] that uh uh is the devil that introduce
[1:05:34] us to shame praise the Lord amen we will
[1:05:39] go through that uh the first time shame
[1:05:41] was mentioned is in Genesis chapter 2
[1:05:43] we'll go through we deal with that the
[1:05:45] Bible says they were naked and they were
[1:05:47] not
[1:05:49] ashamed praise the
[1:05:51] Lord but then when men fell then they
[1:05:55] got the sense of
[1:05:57] Shame so because shame was introduced to
[1:06:02] us from uh from the
[1:06:06] fall okay from a negative angle it's
[1:06:09] hard for us to be able to see the
[1:06:12] benefit of Shame it's hard for us to be
[1:06:16] able to see healthy
[1:06:18] shame but there is healthy
[1:06:21] shame and and it was actually a blessing
[1:06:24] for me to for me to be able to see there
[1:06:27] because for the long time looking at uh
[1:06:30] at at uh a shame and and you know
[1:06:33] thinking about the subject of dealing
[1:06:35] with shame I've always been looking at
[1:06:38] the negative aspect of Faith the
[1:06:39] negative side of Fai but it's also good
[1:06:43] and beautiful for us to realize that
[1:06:46] there is a positive side of
[1:06:49] Shame and uh uh and and and and and and
[1:06:54] some of the positives side of shame let
[1:06:57] me be go ahead of myself a little bit
[1:06:59] you realize in Numbers Chapter 6 Numbers
[1:07:03] Chapter 6 introduce us to what was
[1:07:06] called The nazare Vow the Nazareth vow
[1:07:11] was a vow of Separation it was a vow
[1:07:14] where uh uh men and women in Israel they
[1:07:19] could they could they could take that
[1:07:20] vbe for 6 months or a year or they could
[1:07:24] take it for more and what they would do
[1:07:26] is that they will they will they will
[1:07:29] separate themselves you know they will
[1:07:31] allow their hair to grow you know uh uh
[1:07:35] and then uh they will Asain from uh uh
[1:07:39] uh uh wine and they will estain from
[1:07:42] different things and uh it was it was it
[1:07:45] was a vow of Separation
[1:07:49] but when uh when the men were involved
[1:07:53] in that you see the
[1:07:56] H Samson was born under a Nazareth vow
[1:08:00] that's the reason why he was told not to
[1:08:02] cut the lots of his head now but it is
[1:08:06] because also onto the the Jewish culture
[1:08:12] it was an identity of
[1:08:15] Shame Paul would deal with that in the
[1:08:18] book of Corinthian where he says when a
[1:08:20] man keeps long head it is shame unto him
[1:08:24] why because it was an identity of Shame
[1:08:28] when a man goes uh okay let me take
[1:08:30] another example I'm I'm just trying to
[1:08:33] to I'm trying to capture you praise the
[1:08:35] Lord let me take another example when
[1:08:38] when uh when the prophets will will take
[1:08:42] saot and aches that's another good
[1:08:45] example saot and arches was
[1:08:49] also uh uh a position of
[1:08:54] Shame they are identifying
[1:08:57] thems uh they are humbling thems praise
[1:09:01] the Lord amen and and to be able to
[1:09:05] Humble thems that way they are going to
[1:09:08] where uh you know uh uh sa it was it was
[1:09:12] just a tone of clothes a ragged clothes
[1:09:15] and and then you know and and they just
[1:09:17] put you know arches all over them you
[1:09:20] know every everybody and and that is one
[1:09:23] of the place where we where where we get
[1:09:25] shame when we are not best presenting
[1:09:28] ourselves praise the Lord amen when when
[1:09:31] you are dressed uh uh and you are not
[1:09:34] best presenting yourself you know you
[1:09:36] you're always looking around your
[1:09:38] shoulders and says oh I you know you
[1:09:40] know you you want to you want to be
[1:09:42] dressed for the moment for the occasion
[1:09:44] you know so when uh when the prophets or
[1:09:48] in the Old Testament when the man or the
[1:09:50] woman would put on sackcloth and arches
[1:09:53] it was a way that uh they have made
[1:09:56] themselves shameful they have made
[1:09:58] themselves shameful for the situation
[1:10:01] that was happening maybe they are
[1:10:03] mouring for the evil that is done in the
[1:10:05] setting maybe there was a pestilence or
[1:10:08] there was wall and they are putting
[1:10:10] themselves before God it's it's in a
[1:10:12] sense what a person is saying oh God uh
[1:10:15] uh uh if if if if if I'm the reason why
[1:10:18] this thing has has happened this thing
[1:10:20] has happened because of our sin we are
[1:10:23] putting ourself before you we are saying
[1:10:24] oh God oh be merciful you know so that
[1:10:28] is the way when we think about healthy
[1:10:33] shame it's a way that is designed for us
[1:10:39] to relook at
[1:10:42] ourself praise the
[1:10:44] Lord
[1:10:46] amen for us to re look at ourself like
[1:10:50] Paul would say if we J ourself we will
[1:10:54] not be J
[1:10:56] are we
[1:10:57] together praise the
[1:11:00] Lord amen I'm I'm all over the place
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] morning but it's
[1:11:06] beautiful it's very beautiful let's take
[1:11:09] another scripture here Hebrews chapter 4
[1:11:11] a very familiar
[1:11:14] scripture a very familiar scripture we
[1:11:16] would like to take Hebrews chapter 4
[1:11:40] praise the
[1:11:49] Lord Hebrew chapter
[1:11:51] 4:12 very familiar to us for the word of
[1:11:56] God is quick and
[1:11:59] powerful and sharper than any two edges
[1:12:03] swore piercing even to the dividing
[1:12:08] aunder of the soul and the
[1:12:12] spirit and of the joints and the
[1:12:16] marrow and the word is a
[1:12:19] decender of the thoughts and the intents
[1:12:24] of the heart
[1:12:26] are we together
[1:12:30] amen and see the next word the next
[1:12:33] verse that is behind on a that neither
[1:12:36] is there any
[1:12:39] creature that is not
[1:12:42] manifest in his
[1:12:44] sight but all things are
[1:12:48] naked and open unto the eyes of him with
[1:12:54] whom we have to do praise the Lord now
[1:12:59] the reason why I'm I I read this verse
[1:13:02] to you is is so is to you know take
[1:13:05] another Sidetrack year uh uh
[1:13:10] um to help us to see that just like Paul
[1:13:15] says the word of
[1:13:18] God is sharper than the two edges
[1:13:22] SW and he says it takes the the
[1:13:26] word to be
[1:13:29] able to separate and
[1:13:32] identify our soul our spirit and our
[1:13:38] body praise the
[1:13:40] Lord the preaching of the word is for
[1:13:44] the saving of the
[1:13:47] Soul praise the Lord amen the preaching
[1:13:51] of the word is for the saving of of our
[1:13:55] soul but now when you look at it in the
[1:13:58] context of the word the Bible tell us
[1:14:01] that the Lamb of God was slain from the
[1:14:04] foundation of the word praise the Lord
[1:14:07] he placed our names on the lamb Book of
[1:14:10] Life from the foundation of the word it
[1:14:13] means there had God in his mind he he T
[1:14:17] about you like he told Jeremiah I
[1:14:19] ordained you even before you were in
[1:14:21] your mother's wom I I had you in my mind
[1:14:26] are we together praise the Lord so you
[1:14:29] see the word of God is the only thing I
[1:14:34] mean when you really look at this uh uh
[1:14:37] uh verse in the Bible you know it it it
[1:14:41] throw every psychology through the
[1:14:44] window praise the Lord it throw every
[1:14:48] psychology it draw every mind reading
[1:14:51] and and and all of that is send it
[1:14:53] through the window it is only the
[1:14:56] word now so that word comes the
[1:15:00] preaching of the word the the the
[1:15:02] reading The Fellowship of the word it
[1:15:05] really comes to be able to uh uh uh to
[1:15:08] bring our truth
[1:15:11] identification praise the Lord amen so
[1:15:15] just like I said the word is for the
[1:15:19] saving of the
[1:15:20] soul is for the cleansing of our spirit
[1:15:24] yeah
[1:15:26] and the healing of our body that's
[1:15:31] right praise the Lord amen it's for the
[1:15:35] saving of our soul if you are saved this
[1:15:39] morning and you have accepted the Lord
[1:15:41] Jesus Christ and and and and and he have
[1:15:44] given you a witness you are saved you
[1:15:47] saved by the grace of God Is by God's
[1:15:49] grace that you are saved praise the Lord
[1:15:52] I'm not preaching to you for you to be
[1:15:55] safe you are already
[1:15:57] safe praise the Lord now you see there
[1:16:01] is another part of the word which goes
[1:16:03] to deal with the spirit that's what Paul
[1:16:05] says the word is is sharper it goes
[1:16:08] between the sword and spirit it brings a
[1:16:11] uni identification to these two things
[1:16:14] the spirit our spirit man just like I
[1:16:16] said on Wednesday is one of is one of
[1:16:21] the most difficult thing of our being
[1:16:26] praise the Lord so the
[1:16:29] word comes the word is preached for the
[1:16:33] cleansing of our
[1:16:35] spirit and that's why Paul would say in
[1:16:37] Ephesians chapter 5 we are watched by
[1:16:41] the watching of the Water by the word of
[1:16:44] God
[1:16:46] Amen that watching is is it's our spirit
[1:16:50] that needs to be
[1:16:52] watched you remember when we read
[1:16:55] that verse over there in Jeremiah the
[1:16:58] heart of man is desperately
[1:17:00] wicked the deeper sense is that is
[1:17:08] uncurable it's
[1:17:13] uncurable the heart is
[1:17:16] uncurable now that that's now where your
[1:17:19] blood vessel comes out
[1:17:22] of is that little chamber in your
[1:17:27] heart praise the Lord amen the medical
[1:17:31] doctor can be able to do the best that
[1:17:35] he can thank God for all the bypass
[1:17:39] heart surate and and and heart surer and
[1:17:41] all of that that they have done but this
[1:17:44] heart that is desperately wicked that
[1:17:46] Jeremiah spoke
[1:17:48] about is
[1:17:50] uncurable that's the reason why in The
[1:17:52] Book of Jeremiah he says I will we give
[1:17:56] you a new
[1:17:59] heart praise the Lord amen I will give
[1:18:04] you a new heart and it's it's almost
[1:18:07] just like uh in in the book of uh
[1:18:10] Leviticus in the Old Testament you will
[1:18:12] realize uh uh uh uh the condition of uh
[1:18:17] of of leprosy was always
[1:18:20] cleansed you hear it in the scripture
[1:18:23] you never really year where the lepr was
[1:18:27] healed the lepo was cleansed why because
[1:18:30] it was an infection that could go away
[1:18:32] and come
[1:18:35] again and that is the way with our
[1:18:38] spirit our spirit man needs constant
[1:18:43] watching it needs constant
[1:18:47] watching Praise the Lord with the soul
[1:18:50] when God save you you are safe
[1:18:55] praise the Lord amen amen the battle
[1:18:59] there in your spirit is how for you to
[1:19:02] enjoy the joy of your
[1:19:05] salvation that is the constant battle
[1:19:08] that we go through our spirit
[1:19:11] man praise the
[1:19:16] Lord so the word comes to be able to
[1:19:21] cleanse our spirit and that very same
[1:19:24] word word heals our
[1:19:29] body Paul
[1:19:32] says to the joints and the
[1:19:36] marrow that this with our blood a
[1:19:39] descender of our thoughts and the
[1:19:41] intents of our
[1:19:43] heart glory be to God are we
[1:19:48] together so you see that's that is the
[1:19:51] reason why we want to use the word this
[1:19:54] morning morning and and trust that uh
[1:19:56] the Lord will be able to help us as we
[1:20:00] as we look at the subject of dealing
[1:20:03] with
[1:20:04] shame praise the
[1:20:07] Lord just like I said you go to uh uh
[1:20:11] Genesis chapter
[1:20:14] 2 the Bible says
[1:20:29] glory be to
[1:20:39] God Genesis chapter 2 verse 25
[1:21:21] are we
[1:21:23] together now so when you when you when
[1:21:27] you read
[1:21:34] that and the chapter in the way that the
[1:21:37] the stripes arrange it the chapter ends
[1:21:41] that way verse 24 therefore shall a man
[1:21:45] leave his father and mother cleave unto
[1:21:46] his wife and they shall be one and they
[1:21:51] were both naked and the man in his wife
[1:21:55] and they were not ashamed now there are
[1:21:59] many other ways like uh uh someone
[1:22:03] said that that's that the end of that
[1:22:06] chapter could be written the man and the
[1:22:09] wife they were naked and they were happy
[1:22:13] praise the Lord it could be written that
[1:22:15] way or they were naked they were very
[1:22:18] strong and
[1:22:20] confident they were naked and without
[1:22:24] fear fear Without Anger without sadness
[1:22:28] without
[1:22:29] disappointment without
[1:22:31] regret it could be written that way and
[1:22:34] if it was written that way it would
[1:22:36] still be the truth because that's what
[1:22:38] it was they never had no
[1:22:41] fear amen they were not
[1:22:51] disappointed they were very strong they
[1:22:53] were very uh
[1:22:56] confident they were
[1:23:00] happy
[1:23:02] but there's a reason
[1:23:05] why there's a reason why I
[1:23:08] believe the Holy
[1:23:11] Spirit describe
[1:23:13] it or the choose of words the choice of
[1:23:17] words the emphasis that God wanted to
[1:23:23] make why the emphasis was on shame I
[1:23:26] believe it is
[1:23:27] not an
[1:23:31] accident there is something really
[1:23:34] powerful really really
[1:23:36] powerful
[1:23:38] because think about it just think about
[1:23:41] it in in that context
[1:23:44] that they were they were they were not
[1:23:47] afraid they were happy because you see
[1:23:51] our truth makeup we are are made not to
[1:23:56] be
[1:23:58] ashamed praise the Lord because
[1:24:03] shame in a trueu
[1:24:06] sense only became our attribute from the
[1:24:10] fall praise the
[1:24:13] Lord so I believe that is the reason
[1:24:18] why the emphasis is there is to be able
[1:24:21] to grab our mind something
[1:24:24] something has robbed
[1:24:26] us something has affected
[1:24:31] Us Praise the
[1:24:35] Lord and as I was as I was looking into
[1:24:38] this and steading reading different
[1:24:41] thing you know uh Medical Science says
[1:24:46] uh even even the little babies even the
[1:24:49] little baby like that little child I
[1:24:52] tried to hold and uh you know and she
[1:24:54] pulled back and started crying it's not
[1:24:57] only because uh uh she's a fresh she
[1:25:00] never see me sometimes that's the way
[1:25:02] that little children are
[1:25:07] ashamed it comes with a sense of fear
[1:25:10] I've never seen this person
[1:25:12] before praise the Lord but in our
[1:25:16] original makeup the way the Lord made us
[1:25:19] we were not to be
[1:25:22] ashamed praise the Lord
[1:25:25] Hallelujah we were not to be ashamed he
[1:25:29] says in the book of Isaiah my people
[1:25:32] shall not be
[1:25:34] ashamed praise the Lord he wanted for us
[1:25:38] to be open he wanted for us to be free
[1:25:41] to lift our hands to say thank you to be
[1:25:44] able to worship to be able to praise to
[1:25:47] be able to express ourself but something
[1:25:51] happened to the hon spirit
[1:25:57] and that thing is robbing us from the
[1:26:00] Liberty from the spirit of Liberty that
[1:26:04] God want us to live
[1:26:07] in Praise the Lord amen from the spirit
[1:26:11] of Liberty that he want us to walk in
[1:26:13] the way he want us to serve
[1:26:15] him is robbing us of our trueu potential
[1:26:19] our trueu
[1:26:20] being because of shame it is it's almost
[1:26:25] like we we we always want to make it up
[1:26:28] to
[1:26:29] others it is not sometimes you know with
[1:26:33] the present culture and all of the
[1:26:34] things that is going on sometimes it is
[1:26:36] not how much more of how I want to dress
[1:26:40] but what would people think about me
[1:26:42] what would people say about me you know
[1:26:44] what would people you know what what is
[1:26:46] going through their mind when I walk
[1:26:47] through that
[1:26:51] door are we together
[1:26:56] praise the
[1:27:01] Lord what a wonderful Jesus we
[1:27:06] ser and how we need the Lord to help us
[1:27:09] amen how we need the Lord to help
[1:27:16] us every one of us every one of us in
[1:27:19] this room this
[1:27:21] morning has been exposed to one form of
[1:27:25] shame or another praise the
[1:27:28] Lord and
[1:27:34] sometimes that sense of Shame comes you
[1:27:37] know as I was thinking about
[1:27:39] this it was it was helping me to be able
[1:27:43] to look at myself really look at myself
[1:27:46] look into my life you
[1:27:49] know you will realize
[1:27:52] that the some deep sense of Shame comes
[1:27:58] from places of
[1:28:01] abuse that uh people goes
[1:28:08] through the truth of the matter today is
[1:28:11] that we all in one form or shape has
[1:28:15] been
[1:28:18] abused praise the Lord amen in one form
[1:28:23] of shap we have experienced some sense
[1:28:26] of
[1:28:28] abuse
[1:28:32] and when you take it back to the
[1:28:35] fall you will realize that with the
[1:28:39] Liberty the Adam and Eve the first Son
[1:28:43] of God and the first daughter of God the
[1:28:46] Liberty the the that they had before the
[1:28:48] father you know look at that word uh of
[1:28:52] you know being naked that not ashamed
[1:28:54] don't just look at it as our physical
[1:28:57] body look at it in the sense of Freedom
[1:29:01] look at it in the sense of
[1:29:03] Liberty amen they could express themsel
[1:29:06] and they they never had had to think
[1:29:09] whether is it the word of God they I say
[1:29:11] the word is it the right word is it the
[1:29:14] word of God or is is it not the word of
[1:29:16] God they never had to go through all of
[1:29:19] that praise the
[1:29:21] Lord whatever name that Adam was call
[1:29:24] any of the animal he was certainly that
[1:29:27] God will be pleased with
[1:29:29] it he was certain that he was doing his
[1:29:33] best and God will be pleased with his
[1:29:41] best praise the
[1:29:45] lord it's because of shame that we triy
[1:29:49] to measure up
[1:29:58] whatever name he called whatever animal
[1:30:00] plant it was just the Bible says God
[1:30:02] came down in the CT of the evening and
[1:30:05] and and the law was placed praise the
[1:30:08] Lord and every day as they come to the
[1:30:11] end of the day it was a fulfilled
[1:30:16] day praise the Lord they were fulfilled
[1:30:19] they knew that they have done what was
[1:30:21] required of
[1:30:22] them if it was not done that day it was
[1:30:26] not supposed to be done that day praise
[1:30:29] the Lord and whatever we do to the end
[1:30:32] of our day must be a fulfilled day but
[1:30:36] what why is the reason why many times we
[1:30:39] don't feel
[1:30:42] fulfilled even sometimes we are tired
[1:30:45] but it looks like we have not done
[1:30:48] enough
[1:30:49] yet oh I if if I if I was just going to
[1:30:53] do this I just needed to spend some few
[1:30:55] hours and finish this and and and and
[1:30:57] and and and and all because of that also
[1:31:00] we we kind of for drag ourself even
[1:31:04] though we are tired we drag ourself to
[1:31:06] the extreme because uh we feel that it
[1:31:09] is not
[1:31:11] enough praise the Lord a little sense of
[1:31:14] shame that if we don't complete it if we
[1:31:18] don't go and
[1:31:20] exerise we have not done our best yet
[1:31:23] but to Adam every day was a fulfilled
[1:31:27] Day praise the
[1:31:29] Lord
[1:31:30] amen every day was a fulfilled
[1:31:35] day now so we see right there in the
[1:31:38] word with the Liberty that they had I
[1:31:42] mean uh they were not judging themselves
[1:31:45] whether you know they were right before
[1:31:47] God or whether they were wrong before
[1:31:48] God whether the song was right whether
[1:31:50] the preaching was right whether you know
[1:31:53] God's uh uh they spend much time in the
[1:31:55] presence of God you know they never had
[1:31:58] those things were not running through
[1:31:59] their
[1:32:00] mind it was time of for Fellowship they
[1:32:02] show up for Fellowship they praise the
[1:32:04] Lord that you know God commanded them
[1:32:06] for what they did you know they tell the
[1:32:08] Lord what they did that day it was the
[1:32:10] end of the day they go home they are
[1:32:12] happy they are just happy they are
[1:32:13] enjoying the plants they are enjoying
[1:32:15] the animal they are enjoying one
[1:32:20] another there was no boundary
[1:32:24] there was nothing of Eve that Adam
[1:32:26] didn't know nothing of Adam that Eve
[1:32:28] never know praise the
[1:32:30] Lord
[1:32:32] amen glory be to
[1:32:37] God I was just uh listening
[1:32:40] to uh a good friend a brother I just
[1:32:45] went to be with the Lord and brother
[1:32:47] George Martins I was listening to one of
[1:32:49] his messages trying to remember him you
[1:32:52] know he was he was he was such a man
[1:32:55] with with a different character you know
[1:32:58] then he was saying uh talking about uh
[1:33:00] Adam and Eve you know he says uh you
[1:33:03] know uh the God had to put the man to
[1:33:06] sleep before the woman was made so
[1:33:08] before he he got out of sleep the woman
[1:33:10] eyes were opening seeing him coming out
[1:33:12] of sleep you know so he says well there
[1:33:16] I mean there are things that uh uh you
[1:33:19] know Adam will will have not known of
[1:33:21] Eve how she was made but they they have
[1:33:23] things that Eve knew of Adam because she
[1:33:25] saw him coming out of
[1:33:27] sleep praise the
[1:33:30] Lord her eyes were open before his eyes
[1:33:33] now
[1:33:35] so looking at this as we as we want to
[1:33:39] look at it this morning I'm I'm really
[1:33:42] kind of a shifting here just like I said
[1:33:44] looking at this subject my mind was just
[1:33:47] on completely on the other side of uh of
[1:33:51] what shame is it's is it's negative
[1:33:53] content
[1:33:55] but you realize there the Genesis
[1:33:58] chapter
[1:34:00] 3 when Adam and Eve will break the word
[1:34:04] of God when the when when the when the
[1:34:08] serpent the Bible says he will begal Eve
[1:34:13] when the serpent will deceive them when
[1:34:15] the serpent will rob them praise the
[1:34:19] Lord amen when the serpent will rob them
[1:34:23] you have to realize that uh even when
[1:34:26] when when God created the angels to
[1:34:29] worship Him the Angels had
[1:34:33] limit praise the Lord amen the Angels
[1:34:37] had limit they were only creatures to
[1:34:39] worship all they they could do was you
[1:34:42] know holy holy is the Lord you know the
[1:34:44] kind of a expression that Adam had
[1:34:47] before God the way he will walk with God
[1:34:50] the way he would talk with God the way
[1:34:52] he will be able to carry out the very
[1:34:55] desire of God that was not given to the
[1:34:59] angels praise the
[1:35:02] Lord amen it was not given to the angels
[1:35:05] and and and and that gave me the thought
[1:35:08] to always think there the day that God
[1:35:11] Express and says let us made man in our
[1:35:15] image and in our likeness I believe that
[1:35:18] day that H uh Lucifer that was where his
[1:35:22] rage came from
[1:35:24] from because to be able to get somebody
[1:35:27] in your likeness is almost like your
[1:35:31] twin amen God is going to make a
[1:35:36] creature like
[1:35:39] him which mean he's going to be better
[1:35:41] than us the Angels God is going to make

[1:36:15] Ephesian he says that Christ Tau it not
[1:36:20] robbery to be equal with God even though
[1:36:24] he was placed in a suffering body even
[1:36:28] though he was placed in the body of
[1:36:31] sisting
[1:36:33] elements and he knew what was going to
[1:36:36] Beall him to the Cross but he never
[1:36:40] thought one bit that any of those things

[1:37:37] sense of always trying to hide or cover
[1:37:43] ourself praise the
[1:37:47] Lord the Bible says uh when Adam fell
[1:37:51] they took a fake Lea and the
[1:37:54] thems that expression that Liberty that
[1:37:57] they had in the presence of God they
[1:37:59] were Robb of it they could no longer go
[1:38:02] without checking
[1:38:04] thems they could no longer go without
[1:38:08] looking in the

[1:38:31] the sense of shame that they
[1:38:34] had praise the
[1:38:36] Lord
[1:38:39] amen Adam in shame was hiding
[1:38:43] himself he never only took a faith Le
[1:38:46] and covered his nakedness but the Bible
[1:38:48] says he hid himself
[1:38:53] and God knowing
[1:38:56] that they are not exposed to something
[1:38:59] they they they they are exposed to
[1:39:01] something that they never knew
[1:39:04] before and what they were exposed to is
[1:39:09] shame glory be to
[1:39:13] God think about God way of dealing with
[1:39:21] shame the first thing he went after
[1:39:24] them amen it was now Adam that was
[1:39:28] calling to God and say Lord I need you
[1:39:31] the serpent has deceived
[1:39:34] me praise the Lord no it was not Adam

[1:39:41] saying Adam Adam where are
[1:39:45] you praise the Lord he says I I've heard
[1:39:49] your voice and I've hid myself
[1:39:55] and the next question that God will ask
[1:39:57] him who told

[1:40:34] comes in his mind and says I'm I'm I'm
[1:40:36] I'm going to blast those people he's
[1:40:39] completely out of the word of
[1:40:42] God no matter how much things are said
[1:40:46] and we say amen and things are said and
[1:40:48] we rejoice and many of the times the
[1:40:51] people get in their attitude because
[1:40:54] things that have been said and they are
[1:40:55] shouting somebody they are thinking
[1:40:57] about they're not thinking about
[1:40:59] themselves in their mind somebody has
[1:41:01] been
[1:41:07] shamed praise the
[1:41:09] Lord God question was who shame
[1:41:13] you this was not the way you were
[1:41:18] behaving who has shamed you
[1:41:30] glory be to
[1:41:34] God God approach was to be able to
[1:41:38] identify the one that has brought the
[1:41:41] shame and not only identifying the one
[1:41:45] that has brought the shame he came with
[1:41:47] a better
[1:41:49] covering he's identifying the shame and
[1:41:52] he's also covering their
[1:41:55] shame he's giving them something better
[1:41:59] that they can be able to come back into
[1:42:00] his presence better that they can be
[1:42:03] able to come back and still have the
[1:42:06] same sense of Joy the same sense of
[1:42:10] Freedom he came with a lime skin he came
[1:42:14] with a bleeding
[1:42:18] skin praise the Lord he first identified
[1:42:23] who cause the
[1:42:27] shame and that is our first step to
[1:42:30] Liberty if we can be able to identify
[1:42:34] what is making me
[1:42:36] ashamed what what is
[1:42:40] it praise the Lord and who am I ashamed
[1:42:51] of are we together
[1:42:54] oh Lord I need your help this
[1:42:58] morning praise the
[1:43:00] Lord I need your help this
[1:43:04] morning because just like the devil did

[1:43:08] same if he can just shame
[1:43:13] Us Praise the Lord and you will even
[1:43:16] realize that some of the things that
[1:43:19] shame us are some of the things that no
[1:43:23] nobody know but you and
[1:43:25] yourself but yet we are
[1:43:28] ashamed so you see it's a spirit
[1:43:32] think praise the lord it's a spirit

[1:43:38] mistake praise the Lord amen if I made a
[1:43:42] mistake you see i h h h h and and and
[1:43:46] and and then uh uh you you tell me of
[1:43:49] the mistake and he says oh you know what
[1:43:50] you're not supposed to do this and and
[1:43:53] and uh well I well I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:43:58] now when that has been de with because I
[1:44:01] have done wrong even if I was hiding
[1:44:03] that wrong and you come and and and you
[1:44:06] know and and and and tell me about the
[1:44:08] wrong now I know you know about it and I

[1:44:13] you realize you just realize from the
[1:44:16] from from the the uh uh from a human
[1:44:18] sense you realize that you don't you
[1:44:21] don't feel ashamed again because
[1:44:24] somebody knows about it and you have
[1:44:27] already talked about
[1:44:29] it praise the
[1:44:32] Lord amen you have already talked about
[1:44:35] it you see that's the reason why brother
[1:44:37] brandham says the devil hates to be
[1:44:41] exposed amen he hat to be exposed you
[1:44:44] know because that's that's where he gets
[1:44:47] uh he gets the advantage if he can just
[1:44:50] keep people in isolation if he he can
[1:44:53] just keep people under the bonage of
[1:44:56] thoughts that condemns
[1:45:03] them glory be to
[1:45:06] God
[1:45:08] hallelujah if he can just keep us under
[1:45:11] the thought that condemn
[1:45:19] us James says in the Book of James if
[1:45:23] our heart condemn us
[1:45:25] not he says if our heart condemn us not
[1:45:29] we have
[1:45:32] confidence before God it means that if
[1:45:36] we don't feel a sense of Shame and what
[1:45:40] takes that sense of Shame if we come
[1:45:43] openly and confess it to the
[1:45:46] father think about this now think about
[1:45:49] this God is a
[1:45:51] spirit they that worship he must worship
[1:45:53] Him in spirit and in truth glory be to
[1:45:56] God
[1:45:58] Amen we do wrong and and and you know we
[1:46:01] misbehave and and you know what and and
[1:46:04] we we tell lies that's that's our makeup
[1:46:06] is and know in in in in saying that my
[1:46:09] mother conceived me and uh uh and and
[1:46:13] and we come to the father and we say we
[1:46:15] said Lord please forgive me and and you
[1:46:18] know and Lord I'm sorry that I did this
[1:46:20] and you know
[1:46:26] and we
[1:46:28] confess praise the
[1:46:32] Lord but you will realize
[1:46:35] that the devil will use that very thing
[1:46:39] that we have said to
[1:46:41] God he can come back to our mind and
[1:46:44] makes it so real praise the Lord and he
[1:46:49] can keep you under such a conviction
[1:46:51] that you will go to hell
[1:46:53] for this thing that you have done now
[1:46:55] he's not he's not physical he's a
[1:46:59] spirit praise the Lord and when we are
[1:47:01] praying to God he's not physical God is
[1:47:04] a spirit praise the Lord but see what is
[1:47:07] happening here is
[1:47:09] that his voice his condemnation becomes
[1:47:13] so real to us then us feeling the sense
[1:47:17] of God's
[1:47:19] forgiveness take on the scale if you as
[1:47:23] a Son of God or a daughter of God can go
[1:47:26] in the presence of God and say Lord help
[1:47:30] me father I'm wrong please forgive me
[1:47:32] Lord and I mean you can really pull
[1:47:34] yourself out and you speak to God and
[1:47:37] you know that you have spoken to
[1:47:40] God praise the Lord amen and Satan comes
[1:47:45] with his lies and say well you know I
[1:47:48] mean you you are just wasting your time
[1:47:50] you know uh this thing that you have
[1:47:52] done is so is so evil the what I'm
[1:47:55] trying to bring to us this morning is
[1:47:57] that you see we stop by the church
[1:48:01] requirement we sto by the denominational
[1:48:04] requirement what the church have said we
[1:48:06] should do and what the scripture I mean
[1:48:08] our our understanding of the scripture
[1:48:10] we really don't go to the
[1:48:14] father that's the reason why many times
[1:48:17] when we come right out of there the
[1:48:19] enemy can come back and use that same
[1:48:22] feeling in our hearts praise the Lord
[1:48:26] and make us to feel guilty and he starts
[1:48:29] to shame us
[1:48:32] again praise the
[1:48:36] lord it's because we just stop as far as
[1:48:40] our Creed told us to
[1:48:44] stop Lord please forgive me and
[1:48:47] sometimes we are not Earnest about it
[1:48:50] sometimes our heart is not out there
[1:48:53] praise the
[1:48:54] Lord glory be to God I have news for the
[1:48:58] devil this
[1:49:00] morning
[1:49:02] amen I have news for the devil this
[1:49:05] morning you know when brother brandham

[1:49:16] amen when the weakest Christian go on
[1:49:19] their knees to pray and really get in
[1:49:23] touch with God he says all hell
[1:49:29] shakes praise the Lord hallelujah and
[1:49:33] that is to says that when we can really
[1:49:35] get in fellowship with our father and
[1:49:38] start and stop listening to all the lies
[1:49:41] of the devil no matter how loud his lies
[1:49:45] are you have to tell him what the father
[1:49:49] have
[1:49:51] said praise Lord this word of God needs
[1:49:55] to come more loud in our ears this word
[1:49:58] needs to be so loud in our heart that no
[1:50:01] matter what the devil will says to our
[1:50:03] ears it will never overcome what the
[1:50:05] promise have said in this

[1:50:44] loud praise the Lord he knows how to
[1:50:48] make himself loud and he can make
[1:50:50] himself so loud
[1:50:53] that nothing you can hear but just
[1:50:56] condemnation nothing you can hear you
[1:50:59] can never even see anything good of
[1:51:04] yourself the Bible say he's the accuser
[1:51:06] of the
[1:51:08] Brethren praise the Lord and you know
[1:51:11] what an accuser
[1:51:13] does accuser

[1:52:12] me praise the
[1:52:15] Lord the woman said decep and begil
[1:52:20] me but what was God trying to to do he
[1:52:24] was trying to
[1:52:25] identify the cause of
[1:52:28] Shame where did it came
[1:52:32] from praise the
[1:52:34] Lord where did it came

[1:52:52] feeling inside sense of
[1:52:56] guilt glory be to God can cause a sense
[1:53:00] of
[1:53:02] guilt and you see and that's what the
[1:53:05] preaching of the word by telling us the
[1:53:08] promises in the book by telling us what
[1:53:12] God has done for us the provision that
[1:53:15] he has made is to release us from that
[1:53:19] guilt praise the Lord now because God

[2:00:28] influence
[2:00:30] amen so he took the he took Isaiah
[2:00:36] chapter
[2:00:38] 6 and he make us to see here is Isaiah
[2:00:43] the prophet having a
[2:00:45] friend Yia the
[2:00:48] king but because of his goly life life
[2:00:52] that he had a prophet the order of God
[2:00:56] is there is the prophet the priest and
[2:01:00] the king the king is not above the
[2:01:04] prophet praise the Lord no the prophet
[2:01:08] the king go to the prophet to consult
[2:01:10] the prophet that's why David went to the
[2:01:13] prophet but here is a prophet a man
[2:01:16] that's supposed to be uh uh uh the
[2:01:19] Watchman the man that's supposed to be
[2:01:21] getting a word from the Lord and
[2:01:23] bringing it over to yuzer he's uh he's
[2:01:26] so he's so influenced by yuzer he had he
[2:01:30] has left his office as a prophet he's
[2:01:32] sticking with his friend Yu and and I
[2:01:35] mean they into all the political things
[2:01:37] and they into all the you it's not that
[2:01:40] he was doing something
[2:01:42] wrong but when it came to the place that
[2:01:46] he as a king exalted himself in the
[2:01:49] house of God to blow incense
[2:01:53] praise the Lord you think about it was
[2:01:57] Isaiah afraid to warn
[2:01:59] him was his was his influence on Isaiah
[2:02:04] affected Isaiah so much that Isaiah
[2:02:06] couldn't say you that's not your place
[2:02:09] oh yeah sometime it do
[2:02:11] happen sometime it do
[2:02:13] happen We R influence some people and
[2:02:17] their influence sometimes makes it hard
[2:02:20] for us to correct them
[2:02:22] praise the
[2:02:25] Lord but he was out of the word of the
[2:02:27] Lord and God struck him with Leprosy and
[2:02:30] that thing Open the Eyes of aiah and say
[2:02:32] he comes right in the house of God
[2:02:34] putting himself down oh God forgive me
[2:02:37] Lord oh I'm unclean I'm a man undone and
[2:02:40] and I mean he's he pour his heart so
[2:02:43] much before God that God has to lift him
[2:02:46] lift his Spirit up back into the place
[2:02:50] where he's supposed to be
[2:02:53] praise the Lord read the book of Isaiah
[2:02:56] after Isaiah chapter 6 his preaching
[2:02:59] changed before Isaiah chapter 6 Isaiah
[2:03:03] only talks about H Jerusalem and and and
[2:03:06] and and and and and and what was
[2:03:08] happening at that time but after Isaiah
[2:03:10] chapter 6 chapter 7 he breaks into a
[2:03:13] virgin shall conceive he started looking
[2:03:15] in the future why because God Has Lifted
[2:03:18] him up
[2:03:22] praise the Lord God Has Lifted him up
[2:03:27] from the
[2:03:28] shame of the death of
[2:03:32] yir and brother br will talk about now

[2:05:41] Lord and now God is going to give him
[2:05:45] another form of

[2:07:24] he wrote the entire
[2:07:27] Bible it was aiah that said in the in
[2:07:30] this 14th
[2:07:33] chapter how are thou fallen from Heaven
[2:07:36] oh Lucifer God took him to the
[2:07:40] beginning in chapter 60 God took him to
[2:07:43] the end show him the end of time and
[2:07:45] show him the millennium
[2:07:54] are we
[2:08:00] together brother says here influence he
[2:08:02] said Remember the word of God the word
[2:08:05] is
[2:08:07] God the word is God and if a
[2:08:12] sarapin that knows no sin how to cover
[2:08:16] his face to stand in the presence of God
[2:08:22] how are we going to appear that day when
[2:08:26] we stand in his presence in the presence
[2:08:28] of his word preach and toughly
[2:08:32] Vindicated by the Holy Ghost he said now
[2:08:34] the people don't have reverence for him
[2:08:38] why isn't it that people don't reverence
[2:08:43] God he it reverence was uh only pertain
[2:08:48] to God he say it spoke of twice in the
[2:08:50] Bible both times it pertain to god
[2:08:52] notice the reason they don't do it
[2:08:55] because they are not fully
[2:08:59] convinced that it is God praise the Lord
[2:09:04] they are now fully
[2:09:09] convinced it's a serious
[2:09:11] thing for us to have the word that we
[2:09:15] have in our
[2:09:17] Edge and be dealing with some of the
[2:09:20] shameful things that we are dealing with
[2:09:22] are we
[2:09:25] convinced that God has come to us in the
[2:09:27] form of the
[2:09:30] word or are we just only stopping that
[2:09:33] we have believed brother brandham to be
[2:09:35] a
[2:09:36] prophet and we are in the
[2:09:39] message because this word that is
[2:09:42] sharper than two edges SW was the same
[2:09:45] word that came to
[2:09:47] Adam and resolve his shame issue
[2:09:52] praise the
[2:09:53] Lord that same word can resolve our
[2:09:57] shame
[2:09:58] issue whatever is shame in us or
[2:10:02] whatever shameful
[2:10:05] thing that we are
[2:10:08] involving praise the Lord the word can
[2:10:11] dissolve it it's the word that redeemed
[2:10:14] Adam it was the word that came forth and
[2:10:17] said Adam Adam where are you
[2:10:26] and our word was able to break his word
[2:10:29] of
[2:10:30] Shame and bring him back into an
[2:10:33] open praise the
[2:10:36] Lord he was in an open he did not mind
[2:10:39] what what the animal would said about
[2:10:41] him what the seent was said about him he
[2:10:43] was back in an open thank God I have my
[2:10:46] Liberty thank God I can call back to the
[2:10:49] father
[2:10:58] but he saying here the reason
[2:11:02] why is because we are not
[2:11:07] convinced baptizing in Jesus name is has
[2:11:10] become just sufficient for
[2:11:13] us praise the
[2:11:16] Lord all brother Brandon photo has
[2:11:19] become sufficient for us
[2:11:24] the word is a life this word is a
[2:11:28] person praise the Lord amen it's a
[2:11:31] person people this is the word that will
[2:11:33] take us in the Rapture God has not put
[2:11:36] us in the hands of any mortal men to
[2:11:39] take us in the Rapture God after he used
[2:11:43] Men He Turned us over to the
[2:11:47] word he turned us over to the word
[2:11:51] that's the reason why he brought us a
[2:11:53] son of man Ministry a Ministry that
[2:11:57] Vindicated the word it was not a
[2:11:59] Vindication of William
[2:12:02] brandham if God didn't help him he would
[2:12:04] have ended a drunk just like his
[2:12:07] father God was vindicating his
[2:12:13] word and he has turned us over to the
[2:12:18] word that's the reason why most of the
[2:12:20] men that claim to be the next followers
[2:12:24] God is taking them off the same why to
[2:12:26] get our eyes on the
[2:12:28] word it must be the word nothing but the
[2:12:31] word let the word become a person to
[2:12:37] you this word has to be real to us it
[2:12:40] can heal the word can heal the word can
[2:12:44] deliver the word can cleanse the word
[2:12:46] can set free the word can break habits
[2:12:51] the word can take us out of our
[2:12:54] shame and give us a smile

[2:19:48] was while I was studing of looking into
[2:19:52] this
[2:19:53] subject I was looking into an article
[2:19:56] where I came across
[2:19:58] uh a
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:05] testimony of one of
[2:20:08] [Music]
[2:20:11] uh one of the US
[2:20:13] uh one of the the best uh baseball patri
[2:20:20] [Music]
[2:20:26] and this this guy

[2:20:43] and and after that
[2:20:46] award he opened up
[2:20:52] and he started to talk about the shame
[2:20:55] that he had held in his
[2:20:58] life and it came from
[2:21:02] uh a sexual abuse that he had when he
[2:21:05] was
[2:21:07] [Music]
[2:21:09] young and he said he carried that as a
[2:21:14] [Music]
[2:21:15] weight and one day a soul bother him
[2:21:21] until he went to the ocean and he was
[2:21:24] swimming trying to swim until he would
[2:21:27] lose strength and drown
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:32] himself because he couldn't deal with
[2:21:37] Fai this is what he
[2:21:40] said he said it has been locked away for
[2:21:44] 23
[2:21:47] years it had wrecked har on my
[2:21:52] life and the relationship I have had in
[2:21:54] my
[2:21:56] life not only with my friends who really
[2:22:01] wearing my
[2:22:02] [Music]
[2:22:04] friends I didn't trust
[2:22:07] anybody he said my wife didn't know the
[2:22:10] dark thing about

[2:22:23] emit I love her
[2:22:26] dearly so I projected who I wanted to
[2:22:29] be but would never let her
[2:22:32] inside because I've always fear if
[2:22:37] somebody knew the real
[2:22:41] me they will run the other way he said
[2:22:44] that was it was it was a painful it was
[2:22:47] it was so
[2:22:49] Rong but yet
[2:22:51] [Music]
[2:22:56] yet that was
[2:22:59] Earnest it was an Earnest look as
[2:23:16] shame you see and if we if we look in
[2:23:19] our
[2:23:21] I will just take the time this morning
[2:23:24] to bring our heart to the
[2:23:36] Lord Saints if you realize you will
[2:23:38] realize
[2:23:41] that we are caught
[2:23:43] different we are made different
[2:23:50] with the atmosphere that the Lord has
[2:23:52] given us this
[2:23:54] morning no doubt we can make an alter
[2:23:58] call this
[2:24:02] morning but I don't want to bring you to
[2:24:04] an
[2:24:06] altar I want you to meet him in your
[2:24:15] heart I want I want the word to become
[2:24:18] so real in your mind
[2:24:23] that you can get a touch of
[2:24:27] [Music]
[2:24:31] him because my Hing is just a human
[2:24:37] Hing I'm not afraid to lay my hands on
[2:24:39] you I'm not afraid to pray with you but
[2:24:43] if I can get you to him
[2:24:45] [Music]
[2:24:53] [Music]
[2:24:54] and that is the thing that is that is
[2:24:56] that is robbing us you find
[2:25:00] people they would love to testify but
[2:25:03] they are ashamed they look like people
[2:25:05] looking at them people will love to
[2:25:07] sing but they they just you know uh
[2:25:13] yeah and uh if if you really realize
[2:25:18] it know that out I believe that God is
[2:25:22] dealing with each and every one of us in
[2:25:24] wonderful
[2:25:26] ways I believe sometimes there are words
[2:25:29] that the Lord will put on your heart and
[2:25:31] put on your mind you could write it down
[2:25:33] and it could be a blessing to
[2:25:35] someone but sometimes we tell ourself
[2:25:38] who am
[2:25:39] I I'm not a
[2:25:42] preacher and the devil just blast our
[2:25:45] mind and he just shame us
[2:25:51] and brother bandam in the message Hasam
[2:25:53] will say that we feel
[2:25:56] embarrassed to even tell somebody about
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:09] Jesus for I believe that word that is
[2:26:11] powerful than the two edges
[2:26:15] SW I believe that word that is a person
[2:26:21] oh since that's that's what God sent us
[2:26:25] Elijah the prophet that's why God sent
[2:26:28] us Malachi 4 is to make the word a
[2:26:31] person now for every one of us to take a
[2:26:34] trip to Jeffersonville I don't have any
[2:26:36] problem with that but I believe that
[2:26:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:26:40] and forever I believe that he's a
[2:26:43] present tense God I believe that he's a
[2:26:46] real
[2:26:49] God whatever the the enemy is trying to
[2:26:54] use to make you
[2:26:56] ashamed whatever he's shaming you
[2:26:59] with God is
[2:27:02] asking who shame
[2:27:04] you who told you you are
[2:27:10] ashamed and he's now own
[2:27:14] it asking
[2:27:17] you he comes with the bleeding word this
[2:27:19] morning
[2:27:21] morning he comes with a word that can
