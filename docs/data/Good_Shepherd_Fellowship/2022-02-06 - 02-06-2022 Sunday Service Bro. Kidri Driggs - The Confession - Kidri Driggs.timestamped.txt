[40:47] uh wednesday night i i gave an
[40:50] assignment i don't know who are looking
[40:52] to thy assignment
[40:53] praise the lord
[40:55] we were talking on
[40:56] [Music]
[40:59] out to your fight and reading from pd
[41:02] we
[41:02] [Music]
[41:04] spoke
[41:04] about poor ministry of grace
[41:08] and
[41:10] [Music]
[41:14] so
[41:15] i don't know who all had the opportunity
[41:17] to look at
[41:19] grace
[41:20] through the episode of
[41:22] of paul
[41:24] because we said paul
[41:26] used it
[41:29] he was the one that most used that
[41:31] praise the lord we read from peter
[41:34] and
[41:35] peter used that in second period in his
[41:38] greeting
[41:40] and
[41:43] if you did the assignment you know
[41:44] exactly what i'm talking about
[41:46] if you didn't do it
[41:48] then
[41:49] may god help you
[41:52] to do it amen
[41:55] but first john also use it
[41:58] in his uh
[42:00] i mean john used it
[42:02] uh uh in second john where he said grace
[42:05] be with you mercy and peace
[42:08] from god our father
[42:10] so in in the terms of
[42:13] of greetings in the way that paul used
[42:15] it so we realized that peter used it
[42:18] once as a greeting and john used it but
[42:20] you find it all true paul
[42:22] writing
[42:27] praise the lord
[42:28] romans chapter 1 verse 7 paul says and
[42:31] uh and to all
[42:33] that be in rome beloved of god
[42:36] called to be sins grace to you and peace
[42:39] from god our father and the lord jesus
[42:41] christ amen
[42:43] praise the lord
[42:44] and
[42:46] he will close the roman
[42:49] letter
[42:50] chapter 16 verse 24 and the grace of our
[42:53] lord jesus christ be with you all amen
[42:56] first corinthians chapter 1 3 grace be
[42:58] unto you and peace from
[43:00] god the father
[43:02] praise the lord
[43:04] amen first corinthians 16 he will close
[43:07] that letter the grace of our lord jesus
[43:09] christ be with you
[43:11] second corinthians chapter one verse two
[43:13] grace be unto you and peace from god you
[43:15] look through all paul letter you will
[43:17] see there he started with that and he
[43:20] closed with the same
[43:26] praise the lord
[43:27] now if you if you taught you heard me
[43:29] saying paul was the only one that used
[43:32] the word grace then you did not hear
[43:34] what i said
[43:36] praise the lord
[43:37] if you thought that what you heard then
[43:39] you did not hear what i say 2nd
[43:41] corinthians chapter 1 verse 2 grace be
[43:43] unto you and peace from god our father
[43:45] and from the lord jesus christ
[43:48] amen
[43:51] second corinthian chapter 13 verse 14
[43:53] the grace of our lord jesus christ and
[43:56] the love of god and the communion of the
[43:57] holy ghost
[43:59] be with you all galilean chapter 1 verse
[44:01] 3 grace be unto you in peace
[44:04] and peace from god the father
[44:07] and from our lord jesus christ
[44:11] praise the lord
[44:13] amen
[44:15] and he closed the galatian letter
[44:17] chapter 6
[44:18] verse 18 brethren is the grace of our
[44:20] lord jesus has been with you so you see
[44:22] that all true all through paul
[44:25] leather he had the ministry of grace
[44:28] this morning i was listening to the
[44:29] message of grace
[44:31] and
[44:32] and there are some things that paul says
[44:34] there but when you get over to the book
[44:36] of hebrew
[44:37] you'll realize that he did not
[44:40] greeted the church like that
[44:42] from the beginning
[44:44] because he disguised himself
[44:47] because he never wanted his letter to be
[44:50] resented
[44:51] by the jewish believers
[44:55] but in chapter 13 he closes it with that
[44:59] greeting
[45:00] grace be with you all
[45:02] amen
[45:05] praise the lord
[45:08] amen
[45:10] so we thank the lord for the grace of
[45:12] god this morning amen
[45:14] amen you appreciate the grace of god in
[45:15] your life
[45:16] amen it's by grace that we are saved
[45:19] amen
[45:20] is by grace that we are saving and now
[45:23] that ourselves i'm sure i was giving a
[45:26] uh
[45:28] a prayer request here the note of pain
[45:31] so so god bless you
[45:34] church i just wanted to thank
[45:36] to
[45:38] thank god for everything he's been doing

[47:03] have people to preach to us
[47:05] but

[1:01:50] 8.
[1:01:51] if you have a say amen
[1:01:53] i mean the bible says but what saith it
[1:01:56] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[1:02:00] and in thy heart that is the word of
[1:02:03] faith
[1:02:04] which we preach that if thou shall
[1:02:07] confess with thy mouth the lord jesus
[1:02:10] and shall believe in thy heart that god
[1:02:12] hath raised him from the dead thou shalt
[1:02:16] be saved
[1:02:18] for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:02:21] righteousness and with the mouth
[1:02:23] confession is made unto salvation
[1:02:26] and let's go to hebrews chapter four
[1:02:32] hebrews
[1:02:34] chapter four
[1:02:42] let's read verse uh
[1:02:44] 14.
[1:02:47] hebrews 4 and 14.
[1:02:51] the bible says seeing
[1:02:53] then that we have a great high priest
[1:02:56] that is past
[1:02:58] into the heavens
[1:03:00] jesus the son of god
[1:03:02] let us hold fast our profession
[1:03:05] for we have not in high priest which
[1:03:07] cannot be touched with the feelings
[1:03:10] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:03:13] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:03:18] let us therefore come boldly unto
[1:03:21] the throne of grace
[1:03:23] that we may obtain mercy
[1:03:25] and find grace to help
[1:03:27] in the time of need
[1:03:29] amen may the lord bless you of his word
[1:03:31] you can have your seats
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:39] if you don't mind
[1:03:41] let's turn over to
[1:03:42] joshua chapter 1.
[1:03:53] joshua chapter 1.
[1:04:00] before i read this i want to give you my
[1:04:02] thought
[1:04:04] and my my my uh
[1:04:07] my thought this morning by the grace of
[1:04:09] god
[1:04:10] is
[1:04:13] honest confession
[1:04:15] honest
[1:04:16] confession
[1:04:19] you know uh
[1:04:20] a lot of times when we think of
[1:04:22] confession
[1:04:24] we think of the wrong that we've done
[1:04:27] but confession means to declare over
[1:04:30] yourself
[1:04:31] you know so you have to ask yourself
[1:04:33] what are you confessing this morning
[1:04:35] you know there there's a uh before we
[1:04:37] read joshua
[1:04:39] there's a place in the scriptures where
[1:04:41] jesus was on the cross
[1:04:43] and you know when they were debating uh
[1:04:45] i believe it was pilate
[1:04:47] o'hara one of the two at the time they
[1:04:50] were debating should christ be crucified
[1:04:53] because they really didn't have any any
[1:04:56] any reason to crucify him
[1:04:58] so he went i believe it was power he
[1:05:00] went to the people and he was basically
[1:05:03] saying what should i do with this jesus
[1:05:05] you know and the people were saying
[1:05:07] crucify him and his response was
[1:05:11] why he's done nothing wrong
[1:05:13] you know the life of christ
[1:05:15] it was pretty much blameless amen they
[1:05:18] had he had nothing to confess for
[1:05:21] but just giving his life that others may
[1:05:23] be better hallelujah
[1:05:25] so in that moment
[1:05:26] the people
[1:05:28] they cried crucify him
[1:05:30] and as him jesus being a just man
[1:05:33] hallelujah he who knew no sin became sin
[1:05:37] he became our sin hallelujah so that we
[1:05:40] could become his righteousness
[1:05:42] but look at the people the people said
[1:05:44] crucify him and then uh pilate
[1:05:48] he says
[1:05:49] uh but the man has done no wrong and
[1:05:51] then they come back and they say
[1:05:53] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:05:57] that was their confession
[1:05:59] hell yeah and they didn't even realize
[1:06:01] hallelujah they said hurry that just i
[1:06:04] want you to catch the day my my my
[1:06:07] subject i'm dealing with confession amen
[1:06:09] and the power of confession and you know
[1:06:11] they said let his blood be on us and our
[1:06:14] children but they didn't stop there they
[1:06:16] said give us barabbas
[1:06:19] that's what they said they said give us
[1:06:21] that criminal that's who we confess over
[1:06:24] ourselves in this moment
[1:06:26] they didn't confess they didn't confess
[1:06:29] the love of the mighty one they didn't
[1:06:31] confess the grace of god into their
[1:06:33] lives they didn't confess the mercy of
[1:06:36] jesus christ all the things that god had
[1:06:39] did until that time church until that
[1:06:41] time that he was on the cross he healed
[1:06:44] the sick he raised the dead he brought
[1:06:47] back joy he gave them the word he did
[1:06:50] all these things but the people's
[1:06:52] confession was give us barabbas
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:56] they have the wrong confession
[1:06:59] and they didn't even realize the very
[1:07:00] thing they asked for was going to come
[1:07:03] upon their lives
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:08] think if they would have said give me
[1:07:10] jesus
[1:07:12] hallelujah church i tell you today if
[1:07:14] that's your confession give me jesus
[1:07:17] there's a lot that comes along with that
[1:07:22] but their confession hallelujah
[1:07:25] they said let his blood be on us and our
[1:07:28] children and they spoke as jews
[1:07:33] the nation of the jews they say let his
[1:07:35] blood be on us and our children
[1:07:38] therefore came something called a
[1:07:40] holocaust
[1:07:43] why because they asked for it
[1:07:47] they asked for it
[1:07:50] see one thing about god
[1:07:52] one thing we got to pre appreciate about
[1:07:54] our lord he's going to give you what you
[1:07:57] asked for
[1:07:59] hallelujah amen see god is not in the
[1:08:02] business of making you do anything you
[1:08:05] don't want
[1:08:06] god is a lover hallelujah he wants us to
[1:08:09] fall in love with him hallelujah he
[1:08:11] don't want to make us serve him or
[1:08:13] anything and you think about a church he
[1:08:15] could have did it he could have made
[1:08:17] everybody in that at that time fall down
[1:08:20] and worship him when he was on the cross
[1:08:22] he said don't you know i could call a
[1:08:24] legion of angels
[1:08:26] and be set free right now
[1:08:28] but he gave his life hallelujah he gave
[1:08:31] his life for us so that we could confess
[1:08:34] christ over every situation in our life
[1:08:38] hallelujah look church before i go any
[1:08:41] further
[1:08:42] let's go back to romans put romans 10
[1:08:44] back up on the stream hallelujah because
[1:08:47] some of these scriptures i want you to
[1:08:48] see that they're not just the words of a
[1:08:50] preacher today but these are the words
[1:08:53] of christ our savior look let's let's
[1:08:55] let's read uh go back the first uh verse
[1:08:58] um
[1:08:59] let's start at verse eight go back to
[1:09:01] verse eight romans ten verse eight
[1:09:05] yeah right there amen it says but what
[1:09:07] says it the word is naive even in thy
[1:09:12] mouth
[1:09:13] and what is the word christ is the word
[1:09:16] holy in the beginning was the word the
[1:09:18] word was with god the word was god and
[1:09:20] what happened to that word that word
[1:09:23] became fresh
[1:09:24] hallelujah so now god is putting the
[1:09:27] word where it's supposed to be he said
[1:09:28] the word should be where in your mouth
[1:09:33] you should be confessing the right kind
[1:09:35] of word
[1:09:37] amen it's too often we go through things
[1:09:39] and we say oh the devil oh the devil
[1:09:42] does and the devil that we're supposed
[1:09:44] to be confessing the word of god
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:51] hallelujah
[1:09:52] what is your confession over your life
[1:09:55] what is your confession over your trials
[1:09:57] and tribulation let me tell you
[1:09:59] something there's nothing you can go
[1:10:01] through except first god allows it
[1:10:09] god created the devil hallelujah for a
[1:10:12] purpose to challenge his word
[1:10:17] see god had
[1:10:19] god had to create a tool that was going
[1:10:22] to bring the best of him out
[1:10:24] so god created satan used it for the
[1:10:26] devil the dragon whatever you want to
[1:10:29] call him to challenge what his word
[1:10:35] knowing he can't stop it
[1:10:40] why because the scripture says
[1:10:42] heavens and earth shall pass away
[1:10:44] but my word
[1:10:47] my word
[1:10:50] what what about that word
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:53] what what was that word
[1:10:55] [Music]
[1:10:56] it
[1:10:57] forever
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:00] so which would you rather have heaven or
[1:11:03] earth or the word
[1:11:05] amen i'd rather have the word because
[1:11:08] heavens and earth would pass away but my
[1:11:10] word remains and do it forever
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:16] so i want you to think about this
[1:11:17] morning
[1:11:19] as we preach and as we go forward
[1:11:21] examine your life
[1:11:23] and think about what you need to confess
[1:11:28] right now if you're sick
[1:11:30] i got a confession for you
[1:11:32] by his stripes you are healed
[1:11:36] amen see god got a word for anything you
[1:11:39] need
[1:11:41] you say brother jesus i've been on this
[1:11:43] journey a long time and you know i get
[1:11:46] discouraged i got a word for you the joy
[1:11:48] of the lord is my strength
[1:11:54] you say well brother jesus i've been
[1:11:55] going through something a long long time
[1:11:57] and i just ain't seen my prayers answer
[1:12:00] yet i got a word for you he said dave
[1:12:02] that way on the lord said remove this
[1:12:06] thing what are you confessing
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:17] the prophet of god how are you talking
[1:12:18] about confession confession means to
[1:12:21] declare what's already been declared
[1:12:24] oh yeah so when i confess i confess what
[1:12:28] god says about me
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:33] because anything other than the word is
[1:12:35] a perversion
[1:12:40] are you with me church
[1:12:42] amen and you know what the enemy does
[1:12:45] even like now we got things in our life
[1:12:47] that we need to confess
[1:12:49] and the devil will tell you you better
[1:12:51] not tell nobody that you better hold on
[1:12:53] to that you're going to be found out
[1:12:55] well let me tell you i got a word for
[1:12:57] you right now i want to be found out
[1:12:59] hallelujah
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:02] i want god to know everything about me
[1:13:05] hallelujah
[1:13:06] amen because when god knows everything
[1:13:09] about me i become hallelujah blameless
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:16] see our problem is church there's too
[1:13:18] many of us we're walking around with
[1:13:21] spiritual weights on our shoulders
[1:13:24] things that we're carrying hallelujah i
[1:13:26] got a word for you he says take my
[1:13:29] burden
[1:13:32] he says my yoke is easy
[1:13:34] my burden is light
[1:13:37] hallelujah what are you confessing amen
[1:13:39] you need a job he says my burden
[1:13:43] he said my yoke
[1:13:44] he said give it to me i'll take it
[1:13:47] hurry up confess these things unto god
[1:13:51] see we're no good without our helper
[1:13:54] hallelujah y'all think i'm up here
[1:13:56] preaching on my own ability no it's the
[1:13:59] gift of god
[1:14:00] but what i must do i must confess before
[1:14:03] the lord that i am nothing
[1:14:06] lord and i need your help hallelujah
[1:14:09] church we all fall in that category i'm
[1:14:12] no better than you but if you're looking
[1:14:14] at me and you're thinking hallelujah
[1:14:15] well how does he get there why is he
[1:14:17] there let me tell you i've confessed my
[1:14:19] wrongs to god
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:23] amen then god can use you
[1:14:27] because the only way he can touch you is
[1:14:29] when you become blameless
[1:14:32] because he's a holy god
[1:14:36] and god's not going to put his heart his
[1:14:38] name on anything
[1:14:40] that's going to take his reputation
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:46] and even when you may find yourself in
[1:14:48] sin god will give you an opportunity to
[1:14:50] confess the right thing
[1:14:52] remember the woman that they accused of
[1:14:54] adultery hallelujah and jesus told him
[1:14:56] he said okay now i want y'all to confess
[1:14:59] y'all can y'all can see her y'all can
[1:15:01] see what she did she was caught in the
[1:15:02] act okay jesus never denied that he
[1:15:06] never denied that she did it but he said
[1:15:08] let's look at this thing for what it is
[1:15:10] let's look at the real confession he
[1:15:12] said now
[1:15:13] yeah she was caught in it but he looked
[1:15:15] at them he said now i want to see what
[1:15:17] y'all can confess y'all know her wrongs
[1:15:19] he said but if any of you be without sin
[1:15:29] they were willing to show somebody
[1:15:31] else's realms when they had things in
[1:15:33] their hearts they had confessed
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:38] they had things in their life that they
[1:15:40] hadn't confessed
[1:15:42] because jesus said if any of you be
[1:15:43] without sin cast the first though and
[1:15:46] the bible said from the greatest to the
[1:15:48] least walked away
[1:15:51] hallelujah
[1:15:52] why because they had things in their
[1:15:54] life that they hadn't confessed even
[1:15:57] though they was trying to condemn
[1:15:59] somebody else
[1:16:03] oh my
[1:16:05] and then this very woman who was
[1:16:06] condemned
[1:16:07] jesus said woman where are thy accusers
[1:16:10] where are your accusers
[1:16:12] oh yeah hey
[1:16:14] and then she said you know in a place of
[1:16:17] scripture he says if there's no one
[1:16:19] accuse you he says neither do i
[1:16:23] why because your confession is right
[1:16:26] once you come under the blood hallelujah
[1:16:29] you cannot be condemned for anything
[1:16:34] when you come under the blood there's
[1:16:36] nothing to condemn you why because the
[1:16:38] blood of jesus makes everything come to
[1:16:41] a standstill
[1:16:45] hallelujah
[1:16:47] church put it back up there bro sister
[1:16:50] whoever back there today
[1:16:52] i'll fail over there
[1:16:54] all right
[1:16:55] you're with me jordan amen he says but
[1:16:57] what says it the word is naive even in
[1:17:00] thy mouth and in thy heart see the word
[1:17:03] is not just supposed to be in your mouth
[1:17:06] but whatever you say you supposed to
[1:17:07] believe it
[1:17:09] hallelujah
[1:17:10] church when i asked god to forgive me
[1:17:12] for my sins i believe he could do
[1:17:15] hell yeah in church that's how you enter
[1:17:17] into a real confession when you believe
[1:17:20] what's your confession to him once you
[1:17:22] confess that to god he begins to change
[1:17:25] your desire
[1:17:27] hallelujah under the old testament
[1:17:29] covenant hallelujah they would confess
[1:17:31] their wrongs but the desire will stay
[1:17:34] there hallelujah
[1:17:35] the desire will stay there why because
[1:17:38] they could not connect with the
[1:17:39] sacrifice
[1:17:41] they could confess it with their mouth
[1:17:44] but there was nothing there to change
[1:17:45] their hearts
[1:17:46] but when jesus came here
[1:17:49] when jesus came he changed the dynamics
[1:17:52] of confession
[1:17:54] hallelujah when jesus came he changed
[1:17:58] the dynamics of what come out of your
[1:18:00] mouth confession and repentance when
[1:18:02] jesus came he took your confession
[1:18:06] and he wiped the straight
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:08] [Music]
[1:18:10] clean not only did he just take it out
[1:18:13] of your mouth but did he begin to change
[1:18:15] your heart
[1:18:18] that's why scriptures come into play
[1:18:20] that says as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:18:23] so is he
[1:18:25] so if you confess something out of your
[1:18:26] mouth and you believe it in your heart
[1:18:28] that's what you become
[1:18:36] oh yeah
[1:18:37] that's why
[1:18:39] i confess myself to be a christian
[1:18:42] holy
[1:18:43] because christian means christ like
[1:18:45] hallelujah
[1:18:46] that's what i confess
[1:18:50] but look church
[1:18:51] he says
[1:18:54] he says
[1:18:55] in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:18:58] that is
[1:18:59] the word of faith
[1:19:03] so when you confess it out of your mouth
[1:19:06] and you believe it in your heart
[1:19:09] it turns into the word of faith
[1:19:12] and the bible says faith is the what
[1:19:20] see i can say holy there are bibles out
[1:19:24] in the world hallelujah but when i hold
[1:19:26] it in my hand i got the substance
[1:19:29] holy i got the manifestation of what
[1:19:32] came out of my mouth hallelujah in
[1:19:34] church what he's saying right here
[1:19:36] hallelujah when the word travels from
[1:19:38] just the mouth to the heart hallelujah
[1:19:40] and you come through a change honestly
[1:19:42] it begins to move in a realm of faith
[1:19:45] honey which we preach amen and the
[1:19:48] scripture says amen hello
[1:19:50] that through the foolishness of god
[1:19:52] of of preaching people became saved
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:19:57] the word of god hallelujah began to
[1:20:00] change the hearts of the people amen so
[1:20:03] church if we believe the word earlier if
[1:20:06] let's say like this if we speak the word
[1:20:09] believe the word it becomes a channel of
[1:20:11] faith to produce what you spoke
[1:20:22] see i almost titled this
[1:20:25] almost titled this message today
[1:20:28] harlow
[1:20:30] say
[1:20:31] what you heard
[1:20:33] so you can see what you said

[1:20:48] and he he spoke to us about divine
[1:20:50] healing and all these things our
[1:20:53] our profession and confession and all
[1:20:55] these things and the spoken word
[1:20:56] authority all of that perfect faith
[1:20:58] perfect love all the things that have
[1:21:00] been restored to the church and then he
[1:21:02] comes and he says everything that adam
[1:21:04] lost has been restored and who

[1:32:42] church
[1:32:43] hallelujah in in revelation john began

[1:32:47] and then john's an angel came to john
[1:32:50] and he said weep not
[1:32:52] hardly for the lion the tribe of judah
[1:32:54] has prevailed who was he talking about
[1:32:58] like he said no one on the earth was
[1:33:00] worthy no one in the earth was worthy no
[1:33:03] one under the earth was worthy but
[1:33:05] there's a lamb hallelujah a lamb that
[1:33:08] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:33:10] world and all power in heaven and earth
[1:33:13] is given unto him let's say his name
[1:33:16] jesus
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:23] hallelujah
[1:33:25] let's say his name jesus
[1:33:29] we're gonna break some yokes this
[1:33:30] morning let's say his name jesus
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:35] [Music]
[1:33:37] there is power in the name of jesus
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:44] there is hearing in the name of jesus
[1:33:50] deliverance in the name of jesus
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:59] if you've lost your joy
[1:34:01] there is joy in the name of jesus
[1:34:13] so i confess
[1:34:15] the name of jesus over my situation
[1:34:23] don't get nervous
[1:34:24] nobody close
[1:34:27] somebody close look at nervous
[1:34:29] church
[1:34:30] we are here
[1:34:32] because we serve a god that can't be
[1:34:34] defeated
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:34:37] see the way confession works
[1:34:40] once you give it to him it's no longer
[1:34:42] yours
[1:34:47] oh my you say oh lord
[1:34:49] lord please take this pornography out my
[1:34:51] life i confess the lord jesus over the
[1:34:54] situation it's no longer yours
[1:34:59] hallelujah
[1:35:00] and god
[1:35:02] is a protector
[1:35:04] of his word
[1:35:06] whether you realize it or not
[1:35:08] he'll protect hallelujah his word in
[1:35:11] every situation
[1:35:12] remember god said to abraham he said hey
[1:35:15] you you and sarah gonna have a son hello
[1:35:18] amen that was god's confession amen now
[1:35:22] abra abraham his body hallelujah was old
[1:35:25] and stricken in age sarah her body was
[1:35:27] the same way and the prophet of god said
[1:35:30] she was way beyond the years of
[1:35:32] childbearing hardly
[1:35:34] but what
[1:35:35] what that got to do with the word
[1:35:38] once it comes out of god's mouth it's
[1:35:41] just as sure going to happen
[1:35:43] hallelujah
[1:35:45] hallelujah
[1:35:47] and with church one thing i want you to
[1:35:49] realize when angels come they come as
[1:35:52] messengers hallelujah
[1:35:54] messengers of what god says
[1:35:57] that's right
[1:36:00] so when the angel came to abraham they
[1:36:02] were basically saying let me tell you
[1:36:04] what god say
[1:36:06] when they came to uh isaiah or jeremiah
[1:36:09] whoever they came to it was god they was
[1:36:12] expressing what god said
[1:36:14] they were only confessing what god told
[1:36:17] them hallelujah
[1:36:19] they were declaring and professing what
[1:36:21] god is saying amen but you look church
[1:36:23] he says
[1:36:25] hey man he tells abraham you and sarah
[1:36:27] gonna have a child you know and sarah
[1:36:29] didn't quite get it
[1:36:31] she was like he must mean him and hagar
[1:36:33] so i'm gonna give a hang on no that
[1:36:35] wasn't what he said he said you and
[1:36:37] sarah
[1:36:39] hallelujah if god gave me a promise i
[1:36:42] ain't looking for it to happen in
[1:36:43] anybody else's life i want my turn
[1:36:47] hallelujah i want the lord to give me
[1:36:49] what he promised me amen
[1:36:51] church and then they get to a place
[1:36:53] where they begin to walk they made the
[1:36:56] confession they began to walk but then
[1:36:58] it had to be something real in their
[1:36:59] hearts
[1:37:01] and abraham gets to a place where he has
[1:37:03] sarah and they're walking down the king
[1:37:05] of bimbalek sees them holly young king
[1:37:07] he sees grandma and grandpa coming up
[1:37:09] holly
[1:37:10] and they couldn't even recognize that
[1:37:12] they're being changed right before the
[1:37:14] people
[1:37:16] the word of god will change you right
[1:37:19] before the people and you may not even
[1:37:21] recognize it if you're in the wrong
[1:37:23] realm
[1:37:26] abraham look church he was so caught up
[1:37:29] and you know what there's a word i want
[1:37:31] to bind this
[1:37:32] morning there's a spirit i want to bind
[1:37:35] this morning that's been moving all over
[1:37:37] the church hallelujah
[1:37:38] and it's in here this morning and i want
[1:37:40] to cast it out honey
[1:37:42] there's a word we use to describe what
[1:37:44] we're going through and it's called my
[1:37:47] anxiety
[1:37:52] oh my my anxiety i just can't get over
[1:37:55] this because my anxiety i'm nervous and
[1:37:57] i'm stressing my anxiety anxiety is no
[1:38:00] more than a spirit called fear
[1:38:05] if you confess anxiety over you you're
[1:38:07] giving the devil a space in your life
[1:38:10] hurry up what you have to say is god is
[1:38:13] not giving me the spirit of faith
[1:38:15] [Music]

[1:38:21] church and you look they come the king
[1:38:24] sees sarah and abraham and the king he
[1:38:26] starts looking at sarah he's like

[1:39:18] said man i got to have her and then here
[1:39:20] comes abraham his anxiety
[1:39:24] and he says hey you're my sister
[1:39:28] when they come and approach you you're
[1:39:29] my sister why did he have anxiety
[1:39:32] because he was scared for his own life
[1:39:36] he wasn't afraid for his wife he was
[1:39:38] afraid for his own life selfish
[1:39:42] church and then he says he says hey
[1:39:44] you're my sister and and actually they
[1:39:46] were
[1:39:47] brothers and sisters
[1:39:49] you know that's why i tell some of you
[1:39:50] young brothers girls be in your church
[1:39:52] that you can look for the marriage but
[1:39:54] you want to go way to africa somewhere
[1:40:01] young girls already being raised

[1:40:40] my own incense
[1:40:43] i'm talking about you brother be looking
[1:40:44] for some way over like my parents say
[1:40:46] sometimes god put stuff right in our
[1:40:48] face and we overreach
[1:40:50] oh my god i need to go to london
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:55] you need to sit down and pray

[1:41:01] [Music]
[1:41:02] probably oh man let me leave that alone
[1:41:05] that's for your pastor
[1:41:06] let me leave that alone but church look

[1:41:10] you know now he sees the king sees sarah
[1:41:13] he's like oh my i got to have her and
[1:41:15] then he goes and take her and then both
[1:41:16] of them they offer up the same
[1:41:18] confession yeah we brothers we sister
[1:41:20] that was the wrong confession
[1:41:22] but church even in our own
[1:41:25] god will protect his word
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:31] because what is he protecting he's
[1:41:33] protecting his promise
[1:41:36] he's protecting what he confessed over
[1:41:38] you hallelujah see god told abraham and
[1:41:41] sarah that you're going to bring forth
[1:41:42] the child hollering so when they got off
[1:41:45] the path god had to protect what he said
[1:41:48] hallelujah so god comes down hallelujah
[1:41:50] and comes to abimelech in the dream and
[1:41:52] says hey if you don't give a back you're
[1:41:54] as good as a dead man
[1:41:57] oh yeah god came down to protect his
[1:42:00] word
[1:42:01] even when sarah and abraham got off the
[1:42:03] path hallelujah then god comes back and
[1:42:06] puts everything back in his proper
[1:42:09] position and he says hey king how to
[1:42:11] restore that woman to her husband holy
[1:42:14] and this is what i want you to do i want
[1:42:16] you to go get prayer from that liar
[1:42:20] [Applause]
[1:42:24] god don't mind whoa
[1:42:26] oh my whoa
[1:42:29] you look at me you may judge me but if
[1:42:31] god puts it under the blood what you
[1:42:33] gonna do about it
[1:42:36] god put abraham and sarah's wrongs under
[1:42:39] the blood
[1:42:41] he said now i will you you're going to
[1:42:43] let my lying prophet pray for you that
[1:42:46] your kingdom be spared
[1:42:51] and the bible says the bible says when
[1:42:54] the people like approach god he says
[1:42:56] lord you know the integrity of my heart
[1:42:58] i've done nothing wrong he said yeah and
[1:43:01] because of your integrity i'ma stop you
[1:43:03] before you do something
[1:43:08] oh my church that's our god
[1:43:12] he wants us to have the right confession
[1:43:14] amen
[1:43:15] but look
[1:43:17] let's go uh i said joshua chapter one
[1:43:20] let's go to joshua chapter one
[1:43:23] oh my i ain't gonna be too much longer
[1:43:26] because you know there was a time with a
[1:43:28] prophet
[1:43:29] he would preach two and three hours
[1:43:31] but then god came and he told me say he
[1:43:33] wanted him to trim it back
[1:43:35] why
[1:43:36] he said because after the word is
[1:43:38] preached he wanted to give the people
[1:43:40] enough time to be dealt with by god
[1:43:42] hallelujah so it wasn't that he was just
[1:43:45] cutting the service short no after the
[1:43:47] word is preached then it is time for
[1:43:49] manifestation
[1:43:51] hallelujah so he was giving the people a
[1:43:53] chance to react hallelujah or receive
[1:43:57] what they heard
[1:43:59] hollywood going from the mind to the
[1:44:01] heart to a walk of faith
[1:44:04] hallelujah that's what the confession of
[1:44:06] jesus christ is it goes from the mouth
[1:44:08] hallelujah to the heart and then it
[1:44:10] becomes a walk of faith
[1:44:12] hallelujah
[1:44:14] joshua
[1:44:16] now what are we dealing with confession
[1:44:19] you know what it's so much coming to me

[1:44:46] preach his own thoughts listen this this
[1:44:48] is in the message uh uh at thy word lord

[2:06:37] hallelujah
[2:06:38] see church we got promises but we don't
[2:06:41] go back to the world because some of us
[2:06:42] got used to losing
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:46] we
[2:06:47] we got used to
[2:06:49] backing ourselves down off the scripture
[2:06:52] when god didn't put that promise there
[2:06:53] hallelujah
[2:06:54] amen
[2:06:56] church don't back down up off of it if

[2:07:17] together everybody and they found out
[2:07:19] aiken had did something he was supposed
[2:07:21] to do
[2:07:23] and joshua dealt with that confession
[2:07:28] he dealt with that confession holly
[2:07:30] not only did he kill him he killed his
[2:07:32] family put on his belongings everything
[2:07:34] that was connected to him he distorted
[2:07:36] and got it away from the church amen and
[2:07:39] then that's what i love
[2:07:41] went back and fought the same people
[2:07:47] he went back and fought the same people
[2:07:49] and defeated them hallelujah
[2:07:52] why because god's promise is true
[2:07:58] and look
[2:08:00] before i close
[2:08:01] josh was in another battle there's a lot
[2:08:03] of other things i could say but i'ma
[2:08:04] just calm it down church josh was in
[2:08:06] another battle he's fighting
[2:08:09] and he's looking at the sun
[2:08:11] and then inspiration starts to come
[2:08:14] the sun's going down he's fighting
[2:08:16] but then
[2:08:17] he starts to remember
[2:08:19] what god confessed over him nothing
[2:08:22] would be able to stand before you
[2:08:24] all of this
[2:08:26] whatsoever your feet
[2:08:28] tried i've given to you for possession
[2:08:31] so joshua was rehearsing everything god
[2:08:33] said to him in the middle of the battle
[2:08:36] what is he doing he's confessing that
[2:08:38] same promise over his situation in that
[2:08:41] moment
[2:08:42] god you said i can't lose the battle god
[2:08:45] you said you've given me this land for
[2:08:47] possession and in the middle of that
[2:08:50] battle more inspiration came hallelujah
[2:08:53] and then joshua rehearsing the promise
[2:08:55] of god to the inspiration came to now
[2:08:58] the spoken word is in his mouth and then
[2:09:00] joshua said son stand still
[2:09:13] then he went on and kept fighting and
[2:09:14] you know what happened the sun didn't
[2:09:16] move and the moon didn't move
[2:09:20] until joshua got the victory
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:26] but he was so sold out
[2:09:29] confessing back to god what god said to
[2:09:32] him
[2:09:34] and he believed that thing till it was
[2:09:35] no longer just something come out of his
[2:09:37] mouth but he believed in his heart
[2:09:40] until it became actions in his life
[2:09:43] all the way to the place to now joshua's
[2:09:46] on the back side
[2:09:48] and he's down there praying
[2:09:50] and somebody's standing before him

[2:09:54] hallelujah
[2:09:55] looking like an angel holly
[2:09:57] joshua didn't bow down to worship him
[2:10:00] joshua stood up and pulled his sword out
[2:10:03] why did he do that because he remember
[2:10:05] what god says nothing to be able to
[2:10:07] stand before you
[2:10:09] joshua was looking at the category of
[2:10:11] the host and joshua looked at him and
[2:10:13] said identify yourself

[2:10:25] got to make it identify itself

[2:10:31] make sure he's running in continuity
[2:10:33] with the promise
[2:10:34] holy joshua looking at the captain of
[2:10:36] the lord's host and he's remembered what
[2:10:38] god sent him nothing to be able to stand
[2:10:40] before you i won't leave you nor forsake
[2:10:43] you i won't fail you just be strong and
[2:10:45] very courageous joshua stands up and he
[2:10:48] says are you false all against us
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:57] he's talking to an angel
[2:11:06] that's a man who believed what god said
[2:11:12] the angel says
[2:11:13] i'm the captain of the lord's house
