good to be here with you in a warmer place than it is outside we're not accustomed to this me and my wife Karen and uh of course we have extreme heat where we come from but the cold my goodness yeah very cold but we're thankful to God for his Amazing Grace for this opportunity to stand before the blood-washed Saints of Jesus Christ and uh we never take it lightly uh the more times we get to minister the more times we feel the the weight and the burden the responsibility that souls are laying on the line that uh God's people need a a word of encouragement uh a word of teaching an Apostolic word a prophetic word an Evangelistic word and God has a fivefold Ministry to be able to unfold that to us and yet God didn't didn't bring the five full ministry that they would be Lords over the people but the five full ministry is to be servants to God's people even if it was said of John the Baptist Jesus himself said of of men born of women there is not risen a greater than John the Baptist but of those in the Kingdom of Heaven he is least he is least of all yeah so it was never God's intention to rise up a a hierarchy of Men's Leadership but it was God's intention to use men and anoint them so that you could be born again so that you could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so you throughout your Christian Life Could re receive filling after refilling of the Holy Spirit if you'll turn with me into your Bibles to Romans chapter 3 Romans chapter 3 we'll be begin reading at verse 26 and we'll go down to verse 31 three steps of Grace that take us to a restored friendship with the father and that and that restored friendship both Jesus and Paul and Peter all taught us it's a process called adoption and that process of adoption takes us to Perfection the Capstone of Our Lives Romans 3: 26-31 and to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of Works nay but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law is he the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is one God which justifieth the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith do we then make void the law through faith God forbid yay we establish the law it would sound like Paul is going back and forth on this thought but in reality Paul took the Old Testament and brought the revelation of that Old Testament the types and the Shadows of the Bible and and made it real but that's where he was rejected of Israel not when he spoke by memory many verses of the Old Testament and the prophecies but when he began to tell them this day this man Jesus of Nazareth is Messiah King of the Jews Lion of the tribe of Judah by Revelation that's where Paul got in trouble with the world but not with God CU it was a revelation and he was sharing it with the mystical body of Jesus Christ at the first coming let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this evening ask your blessings upon this Thy Word in Jesus name amen you may be seated I'd like to say that Jesus became part of the problem died in your place Rose the third day and then became the solution to your problem died with your curse so you could inherit his Blessing eternal life in the message future home of the Heavenly bride it starts at paragraph 467 he said Adam was to multiply and replenish the Earth that right Noah was after the new world was destroyed was to multiply and replenish the Earth he says get it now can't you see what the serpent seed is what replenished the Earth you get it all right you see how Satan got to Eve now that's why death has rained on Earth ever since and Heavens Earth Beast atmosphere is all cursed of God because of it that's the curse because Satan got to her first Jesus came to redeem it back to the father in order to do this he became part of it as I've just went through and from that very and from that very dust the the part Jesus was himself being redeemed through him all of the attributes of God are redeemed with the Earth in Romans chapter 4 and verse 20 Paul speaks and tells us we were delivered for our offenses and ra and he raised for our justification Romans 4:20 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed for We Believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead justified by faith Paul said we have peace towards God but a person in this state of justification it's really hard to tell that God's working on their lives yet and yet indeed it's the first step of the grace of God these three steps of Grace for a man justified by faith he has he has come to an understanding that what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary he's making it personal to himself now that he did it for me justified by faith faith I was tell the testimony of a of a brother that tamy he says I was just talking to a man he says and he invited me to go to his a Bible study with him and um and he's all excited telling me you should come with me we're really having a great time studying the Bible and uh and uh and and and God's doing a a work in my life and you should come and he goes well maybe I will come but that time he reaches in his pocket he pulls out a pack of cigarettes puts one in his mouth lights it up and now he's smoking and now he's saying how wonderful that that God has touched his heart so this brother looks at me and says why you dirty little hypocrite he tells him uh not realizing that a a true work of justification all it means is that person has come to a recognition that is Jesus of Nazareth who died on the cross of Calvary that by faith he can claim this work of the blood for his life he's just now begun but it's very hard to detect especially if we're caught in a moment of our carnality I don't know if that's ever happened to you maybe it just happens to old people like me but but it's happened justified by faith we have peace towards God Romans 5 and verse one therefore being justified if IED by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ someone might say how can you have peace towards God and you still has habits she still has habits she still needs big changes in her life that's what justification brings it brings a peace despite despite all the complexes that Satan has put on their lives it brings a peace to their hearts that they've got a Hope they've got a hope he said therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God the AIS now is sanctification by the spirit the access now is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Fire and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience EXP experience and experience hope so when a person understands that they've been justified by faith they've got a Hope they've got a peace they can press forward they can press forward and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for each and every one of us justification by faith on the on the on the finished work of what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary the blood that he shed that washes us white as snow that blood is is a barrier from the Throne all the way down to planet Earth that blood the father looks through the blood of Jesus and he sees you all just perfect just the way just the way he saw you when you are an attribute in the mind of God and yet we know we need more to be changed even more yet but it's it's because of the blood of Jesus Christ that lifts up a barrier sanctification by the spirit Holiness we're practicing the right thing for the right reason when you're Sanctified by the spirit and God is leading you to Holiness in your life from justification to sanctification then we're practicing the right thing for the right reason we desire to be like our lord Jesus we love him because he first loved us we see how great this kingdom of God is where God's kingdom is the blood wash Born Again Believers to whom the to whom the mysteries of God are opening and unfolding in our lives in St John chapter 3 beginning at verse one you all by Bible readers you could almost quote it back quote it by heart to me there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles you do except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God God's kingdom is a kingdom of Holiness God's kingdom is a is Holiness in Friendship God's kingdom is Holiness in sunship God's King kingdom is Holiness in courtship God's kingdom is Holiness in marriage God's kingdom is Holiness in Ministry in music in musicians God's kingdom is a kingdom of Holiness for deacons for marriages for pastors in Romans 12 and verse one the Apostle Paul says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service you haven't gone too far when you do that the world tells you've gone too far but the Bible tells you no no you haven't gone too far there's more yet and Paul said and be not conformed to this world but ye be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost forms this complete Born Again experience in the message the third seal Prophet says but then if the Pentecostal message was the last message which justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the last three messages the last three Church ages forms the complete birth the Born Again experience justified by faith Sanctified by the spirit baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire brother Daniel how much space is in between each one of those experien you don't need any space between those experiences you can you can go from one to the next to the next some of us go a little further some of us it takes a little longer some it takes a little shorter but nonetheless if if God is working in your life time means nothing to God what he's interested is purging you of all the complexes of life so that you can be free in in Christ Jesus Paul said to the Corinthians you are the temple of God know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you that should challenge us to how we should live our lives daily know ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are but if you're a Son of God with the seed of God in your hearts he just takes the clay and smashes it all down again and begins molding it once again yeah that's that's what he does for every son and daughter of God in first Thessalonians 4 1-8 Apostle Paul speaks about possessing Your Vessel in sanctification furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how we ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you have abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanc sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupisent even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for God ha not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness God wants a church that lives a life worthy of the gospel God wants us to practice Holiness at home at work at the church at school and it will give you victory in your life because if you're not ashamed of him he'll stand for you in those moments to the Romans Paul says I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness in Romans 6:22 the Apostle Paul says but now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life to the Corinthians he says having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse oursel from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God in 2 Corinthians 6 1-8 Paul speaking to the Corinthians it was a very challenging group of people to Pastor the Corinthians but nonetheless he gave them all the conso of God by which they could be free in Christ we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain for he saith I have heard thee in a Time accepted in the day of salvation I have suckered thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience in afflictions in necessity in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labors and watchings and fastings by pureness of knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by Love unfe by the word of Truth by the word of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left oh my he's speaking to the ministry and it leaves us feeling that we fall short but nonetheless we press on in Jesus name amen by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things oh ye Corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged you are not straightened in us but you are straightened in your own bowels now for a recompense in the same I speak as unto my children be also enlarged be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion at light with darkness in a world when we can go get so easily connected through the internet with all kinds of people may God give you wisdom and discernment to shut those things down and have fellowship with Believers have fellowship with Elders who will encourage you to follow Jesus but ye but be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness and what conquered hath Christ with belile or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God had said I will dwell in them and walk in them I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you in Romans 12 in verse one I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God if there's something I see that's not being done enough it's the reading of this Bible in our homes in our churches at our family altars with our children there was one thing a prophet said if you'd like to be more spiritual he said read your Bible and pray every day because not everything a prophet said was was the Deep prophetic things of God he told us many times he was just giving his opinion but when you make it all thus sayith the Lord then then you begin threading on on Dangerous Grounds for I say through the grace verse three given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dwelt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have the same off and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministry or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exalteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preer pre preferring one another not in slothfulness of business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of the Saints given to hospitality bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one towards another mind not high things but condescend to Men of low State be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men if it be possible as much as Li inin you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourself else but rather give Place unto the unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay sayith the Lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him every thirst give him drink for in so doing Thou shalt Heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good my brother asked me one time what advice can you give us for fathers uh you know recently married a Young Bride a young man and uh I said well when you got married didn't they give you that book on how to be the perfect husband he says no I didn't get that book he says you did get it you just didn't know what was in the book that book is the Bible and if you read chapter 12 of here in Romans it's just the beginning of advice of how to establish yourself as a father in your home each and every word because it's a man in action it's a man doing things for the saints of God it's a man doing things for his family this is a this is a father being anointed of the heavenly father in the message white Christ speak 1959 paragraph 12 Prophet begins he said and then if you just accepted him as your personal Savior and have not received the Holy Ghost I trust that tonight you'll receive it I see some of the Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say this about the big sister see one thing that the Tabernacle needs up there at our church at Tabernacle that at the Tabernacle at Jeff is a rededication and a refilling of the Holy Ghost wow everyone to get down to the Altar and pray until they get a renewing of the Holy Ghost the whole church filled with the power of God and that's what we need not only the Tabernacle there but the body of Christ Universal it needs a refilling the refilling of the Holy Ghost it's not a reward for having be behaved yourself really good for one week no no the refilling of the Holy Ghost is the victory that God sends you to overcome that Temptation and that trial he didn't send you a refilling to reward you he sent you a refilling to give you the strength you need to be an overcomer David said one day restore to me the joy of my salvation now he that had now he had not lost his salvation but the joy of it and it when it comes to a place that I can't enjoy my religion my salvation there's something wrong somewhere because it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of them said taste and see that the Lord is good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh I'm so glad that I've tasted that the Lord is good and I love honey but I never tasted anything like that that's the best that I I know Apostle Peter in second Peter 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness to the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness to Godliness of Brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ in other words unable or unwilling for if these things be in you and abound they make that that you shall neither be unable or unwilling in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ the very the very nature of God a people entering into adoption these These are people that when they come to this place they've been they've been born again they've been justified by faith they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire how did they receive it it might have been a very quiet moment all to themselves it might they might have spoken tongues they might have shouted real loud they might have just sat in their chair and shook with reverence for the peace of God that passes all understanding that's right but one thing that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire does for everyone it gives you a life worthy of the Gospel it gives you a heart like David that he was ready to repent any any mistake anything he did he was ready he would he would bear the shame to to be redeemed of of that sin but he that lackthe things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather bre and give diligence to making your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ your your life is not going through a process of sons and daughters being adopted being adopted and your tutor is the father himself wherefore I will not be neg negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yay I think it meat as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must put off this Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus Christ had showed me moreover I Endeavor that you may be able to after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunning devis fables when we made known unto you the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to no other man on the Earth was this statement made it was Jesus Christ and him alone there is no other name on under Heaven by which we can be saved except the name of Jesus Christ and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him on the holy Mount we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts the three steps of Grace in a very in a very brief and short statements but the three steps of Grace take us to the Born Again experience and those and that Born Again experience takes us unto Perfection Perfection through a restored friendship with the father adoption is the process but Perfection is the Capstone of this Psalms 51 1-10 the psalmist David it's a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone into basba and he says have mercy upon me oh God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee the only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desireth truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to know wisdom Purge me with his and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow that statement is more true today than it has ever been when David said it it was something he hoped for but we can say it by Revelation and God can cleanse us make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face for my sins and blot out all my iniquities create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me it was a prophecy David could David by even by faith could not get a hold of this prophecy because they without us could not be made perfect but when we come to this stature of perfection then our statue of perfection raised es up all that have gone before unto Perfection Matthew 5 and: 48 Jesus says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect few years back I was doing work for a man he was a uh one of a few pastors for a big mega church there in Phoenix and uh very nice man a real gentleman so of course we got to speak in about the word and uh and as he was hearing me talk he says dan I perceive that you're a bit on the calvinistic side he tells me I said his name was Bert I said Bert actually I'm like 5050 calvinist and Armenian 50/50 I said cuz each of them had some Truth uh and and when you put them together you get more truth and more detail but yet God has given us truth beyond that today be ye therefore perfect Jesus said even as your father which is in heaven is perfect this is verse 48 of Matthew 5 the reason he said be ye therefore perfect it's declaring his subject that he was speaking of in Matthew 5 this is a conclusion statement so from verse 1 to 47 Jesus preached Perfection to the church Jesus preached the Born Again experience justified by faith Sanctified by the spirit Jesus preached the little baby steps to get to this point in verse 48 when he made a conclusion statement be ye therefore perfect um Lord what does that mean that means you read too fast the first 47 verses and I want you to go back and read them again because Jesus was speaking on Perfection Hebrews 6 and verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ Paul says to the Hebrews let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God perfect it means to make perfect to complete uh to bring something to an end to add to what is what is lacking in order to render a full thing to bring to an end as a goal to bring to a close or fulfillment of events like the Prophecies of the Bible an exposition of the seven Church ages brother brandham says this tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our PR patience is seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work that that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly faithly they serve God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord and how great was their reward he says so Perfection has a process and the Lord Jesus was the first ever to bring us a teaching of all the components that take us to Perfection the process is called the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God the process to arrive to adoption is called the three steps of Grace in Galatians chapter 4 the Apostle Paul says this to the Galatians to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God hath sent forth the Holy Spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then heir of God through Christ an heir to Perfection what is perfection to be as Eternal as the father is eternal the One Pastor said we cannot be perfect then I'm going to stop you right there he said I read him the that's the scripture in Matthew 5:48 he says we cannot be Perfection per perfect he says I said uh Bert I want to say we can be perfected it's the way we view Perfection do we view it through a diction through a dictionary description or do we view it through the words of Jesus himself and a prophet told us if God requires perfection then he's got to find a way to make you perfect but the Perfection was to finally reach unto eternal life with rapturing faith and transport it from this world Galatians 4:5 and 7 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and and if a son then an heir of God through Christ to the Ephesians he said according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the Romans he said in chapter 8 verse1 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby re cry ABA father my father my father Hallowed be thy name th King kingdom come thy will be done in this Earth as it is in Heavens Paul's speaking to the Galatians Galatians 5:19 he says now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath Strife sedition heresies envies murders drunkenness re revellings and such like of the which I tell you before also I have also told you in time past that they that they which do s such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God it's not enough to say uh I I accept William brandom as as as as Malachi 4 that ain't enough it's not enough to say I recognize that he's the seven th Angel that's not enough there's a life that God wants us to live there's a life of faith in his word that God wants us to practice there is a Holiness that he wants us to keep to but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of Eng gloring provoking one another envying one another before we come to this relationship as sons being adopted there are three steps justification by faith sanctification by the spirit and God the great Holy Spirit can change you so your own mother wouldn't even recognize you God can change you but we have to ask for change we've got to plead for change we've got to get on our knees at the foot of the cross and believe his blood covers and Rise Up from there with newness of Life justification by faith sanctification by the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire you're you're a vessel that's been washed and cleaned Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a few little drops at the bottom of that glass and what you're going to receive between now and God time God takes you from here is refilling after refilling till your cup runneth over and this body of Flesh can no longer contain the work that God is doing in your soul prise the Lord there was the parable where Jesus said he says if you pour new wine into old wine skins he says won't it burst out and you lose all the new wine and I've read it for years since I was a child and I thought okay yeah that makes sense but one day it just dawned on me that that's exactly what God is doing to his children he is feeling us with new wine until we get until that new wine is so flowing and bubbling over that this old body this old wine skin can't hold it no more so it wasn't just a parable to the negative but to the positive as is All The Parables of Jesus excuse me these three bring us to a restored friendship with the father it's called adoption unto perfection in Hebrews chapter 7 Paul told the Hebrews for there's verely a disannulling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof and not only one commandment but all 10 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God so yes Paul is speaking of all Ten Commandments and Jesus in his Parable and adoption and Perfection Al mentions them and tells us how they're being disowned cancelled abolished invalidated here is the admonition of God when he was opening the book that Adam lost and telling us things that had been hid since the foundation of the world and it's a scripture that's for me it's as as important as all scriptures but even as important as as in the book of Acts Matthew 13:34 all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude and in Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them Matthew was reaching back into the Old Testament and from the Psalms he was pulling out this Prophecy of the style and Ministry of Jesus Christ he said all these things spake Jesus into the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoking not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken that by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field and when the multitudes had all gone he began to speak to his disciples he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man and he be began bringing the revelation of this prophetic word in these Parables so everything that Jesus spoke wasn't a parable Matthew 28 8 19 go you out into all the world and preach the gospel teaching them to be baptized in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost it seems pretty clear-cut what you should what you should be doing and and trinitarian those that hold that trinitarian Doctrine they have told me Daniel you go ahead and believe uh Peter a backslid fisherman but I'm going to believe Jesus the son of God see so I said okay I said I said I said well the Pentecostal people uh align themselves in the same way we've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because those are titles but those were more than just titles that was a parable that was the prophetic word and on the day of Pentecost a prophet was given the revelation of that prophetic word and they just mesh right together but without Revelation those scriptures don't mesh those scriptures hit and they've been hitting for thousands of years but today by the grace of God God's given you and I a revelation we realize it was a parable like the parable like the parable of the of the two sons the prodical son it was really a parable of two churches the younger son was a gentile people and the older son was Israel who refused to come and get involved in the Revival that was taking place it was a prophecy in a parable not way in the future right there that day that scripture was taking place before Israel before the high priest and all his and all the Liv and all the Levites and The Parables continue to unfold in this manner everyone is a prophetic word unfolding a mystery of God God rich in Mercy Matthew 13:34 all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable spoke he not unto them that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in Parables I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world I Jesus when I come I'll be speaking things that only the ears of Adam have ever heard but now I'm coming to tell it to you my children to give you the same experience to give you the same Born Again experience to cause you to be born again to receive the baptism of the Holy ghost and in hard trials ask God for the refilling that you need don't let the devil trick you that what that what that what that what you are struggling with means that you're not worthy no what you're struggling with is a complex of life and a refilling of the Holy Ghost will give you the victory over that complex that's right right that it might be fulfilled verse 35 which was spoken by the prophet saying I'll open my mouth from Parables all other things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field for the first time since he spoke it to Adam once again lip to ear to Adam's Fallen race this is what Adam heard that day in Eden just before the fall when the father told him be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I know you might be thinking no no brother Daniel this is New Testament that's Old Testament Genesis what part of God's word is Old Testament and New Testament what part of thus saith the Lord is too old to you or tune you to understand God has said to his children to his people that he's going to bring to you all these things that he gave to Adam and it's from this admon admonition and divine teaching that Adam and Eve fell Adam Eve be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect they had arrived to that spot in their lives they had arrived to that spot with the father tutoring them and it was from there that they fell none of us are too great that we can't fall if we let down the guard we must seek Him brother Daniel how do I do that read your Bible and pray every day do you love him tonight yes so these are not just New Testament admonitions this was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and God has made a path baby steps that you can take he has made a way because he's a way maker and he wants you to keep walking by faith and not by sight do you love him tonight as we stand to our feet let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again tonight for your Amazing Grace for your word of God for scriptures that Lord we not only read them with hope but Lord you're bringing them to pass in our lives and for this we we thank you and we give you all the honor the glory and the praise bless Lord your church here in Minnesota and Minneapolis Lord be with each and everyone in the struggles they're going through Lord God send them another refilling of this Holy Ghost and power and we'll be sure to thank you Lord and may may there come testimonies of these refilling we realize that the that the refilling of the Holy Ghost is not a reward no it's the sword of God it's the faith of God it's the victory Of God it's how we overcome our trials filling after refilling after refilling and for this Lord we thank you in Jesus name amen amen God bless you all tonight well praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat and uh that's beautiful that's very beautiful praise the Lord you know God is uh is so is so uh wonderful in the way that he made us he made us you know wow very different just like we said you you pray for brother Daniel tomorrow that the Lord would give him strength I know that against uh uh every art in his body he tried to fulfill uh all righteousness tonight because he was on his lot to preach so he tried to to make his body obey his confession amen so you pray for him but I think there's uh there is something that is wonderful there something that is wonderful I was just I was just looking at uh what brother Danel read there over in U Matthew Chapter 5 and Jesus said be ye therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect you know just like he said the word therefore means as a result that's what the word therefore means as a result so everything that Jesus said from verse one the result of faith is to be perfect praise the Lord you will see Paul used the same word in Hebrew he said therefore let's go on to perfection as a result of everything that the Lord has given to us the result of it was to bring us to Perfection praise the Lord the word of God is so so beautiful amen it's so beautiful it's so beautiful the S we start appreciating and understanding that it is not our effort the soon we start realizing that the grace that is given to us is to appreciate what he have done for us the sooner you start appreciating there the closer you will get to God praise the Lord you know we have made everything like a rat race and you know and and and and you know who can shout louder who can jump higher you know and and who can run faster but uh if we realize that uh we are we are just walking in the finished work it's a work that been finished from the foundation of the word and God just want you and myself to come to a knowledge and appreciate what he has already done for us the sooner we get to understand that we get to seize that we will start enjoying we will start uh eating the fruit of our Salvation praise the Lord amen because you see the uh uh Salvation will not mean much to us if we can enjoy it amen praise the Lord amen if we can enjoy it and uh I mean uh what what is the need of coming to church if we can enjoy church you know and and that's the reason why many are falling away from church because all they are either staying away from church or they are changing Church to be a place of entertainment because we must enjoy it but you see there is there is there a there there a there's a there's a lot of joy you know uh uh in in the word it's it's like it's like Honey in the Rock Amen so let's let's pray for brother Daniel to to uh uh tonight and and believe that God will give him strength and and and he'll be able to bring more of that you know but Daniel has a has a very different style of ministry you have to you have to be listening amen you have to be listening you know uh uh we the young people we have lot lot of energy to run around he don't run around he just talk because he expects you to listen amen yeah you got to be listening you got to
