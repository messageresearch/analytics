[33:53] st. pray and just ask the Lord will lead
[33:56] us together so the Lord bless you praise
[33:59] the Lord
[34:01] if there is any update on that we will
[34:05] bring more of the information to you on
[34:08] Sunday as well
[34:10] tonight I want to just for this
[34:13] Wednesday night I want to take a little
[34:18] thought here I want to speak on a
[34:22] setting woman a
[34:28] certain woman the reason why I
[34:32] was listening to the detail of this
[34:34] story from from the Book of Luke while I
[34:38] Drive over for the service tonight but
[34:42] the reason why I use this
[34:46] reading from the book of Mack because
[34:49] Luke needed none of the Gospels give us
[34:53] any history about this woman but I
[34:56] appreciate the way that
[34:59] Mac said it a certain woman
[35:04] so
[35:06] that's what I want to use tonight a
[35:09] certain woman now I believe in the way
[35:14] that
[35:18] that Mack said it
[35:22] it is is
[35:25] you know it's easy to think in in the
[35:30] direction of the not knowing the woman
[35:32] name and nobody know where she came from
[35:34] it was only nobody even knew the woman
[35:37] you know because the crowd it was so
[35:40] crowded and even when Jesus said
[35:42] somebody touched me I mean the disciples
[35:47] master you know the place is so crowded
[35:49] it is impossible for you to be a nobody
[35:53] touch you you know I myself people
[35:55] atashi mean you know when they are all
[35:57] moving and bumping into me but
[36:02] I mean Jesus waited for a while and he
[36:04] was able to identify the woman then they
[36:07] understood that it was it was more than
[36:10] just a physical touch it was a spiritual
[36:13] touch and
[36:16] think about it they were on their way to
[36:18] Jairus house because Jairus daughter
[36:21] [Music]
[36:23] was now well and she sent for for for
[36:27] Jesus let's go to see Luke chapter 12
[36:34] let's go to see Luke chapter 12 and
[36:37] look at
[36:56] now when you turn to see Luke chapter 12
[37:00] one of the things no is not chapter - oh
[37:03] sorry chapter 8
[37:05] sorry it's in Luke
[37:07] there's a reason why I said chapter 12
[37:10] there is there's something that it's
[37:11] kind of a plane in my mind if you if you
[37:15] look to chapter 8 is actually chapter 8
[37:17] the story is you realize that
[37:21] this chapter Jesus
[37:25] has just
[37:27] you know he was resting in the boat
[37:30] after a meeting tired and you know the
[37:35] disciples call him you know then and I
[37:40] mean he he rose up and you know he
[37:44] rebuked the wind and
[37:47] he also you know
[37:51] services you know what manner of man is
[37:53] this after they saw him speaking to the
[37:56] Wayne and you know in order death and
[37:59] then they just move on the other side
[38:03] and he
[38:05] also delivered a man there was possessed
[38:08] with evil spirit the the chapter starts
[38:11] with Mary Magdalene that you know Jesus
[38:15] cast out Devils out of and then it goes
[38:19] to this to this
[38:21] event on the on the seed and then it
[38:24] goes over to this man I was possessed
[38:26] with demons I mean these disciples were
[38:29] just they just had a privilege to go
[38:31] from one revival to another revival it
[38:35] looks like every time they had to travel
[38:38] with the Lord there was they were
[38:40] expecting that him he was going to do
[38:42] something I mean they didn't know what
[38:44] to expect but they were just having that
[38:47] expectation that something was going to
[38:49] happen and I believe that is it that is
[38:51] the same thing with you and myself
[38:52] praise the Lord having Jesus in our cam
[38:55] we can expect that something is going to
[38:58] happen praise the Lord so
[39:00] and then after the just came out of I
[39:06] mean this this
[39:08] experience or revival of
[39:12] this man that was possessed with with an
[39:15] evil spirit you just think about that
[39:18] you know what if we want to apply there
[39:20] to our Bane and apply there to I mean
[39:23] our age and our our message you realize
[39:28] that it was it was this kind of
[39:30] experience that
[39:32] brother Branham had with their man of
[39:35] origin even though it was a different
[39:37] kind you know this man was delivered
[39:40] that other man was worshiping their
[39:42] spirit so but what happened here is is
[39:46] there a
[39:48] common husband you know he will
[39:52] attribute this experience of origin to
[39:57] making gold real to him where he went
[40:02] and lock himself up after he witnessed
[40:05] this experience because he and his wife
[40:08] was in that meeting
[40:10] you know they were in that meeting at
[40:12] Oregon when they when you know when the
[40:14] witness what what they saw with their
[40:16] eyes this man possess with with a devil
[40:20] you know and and I mean even nobody
[40:23] could Khujo him everybody was afraid
[40:26] because not not a few days before that
[40:29] day he had just killed another preacher
[40:32] break him by the neck you know so
[40:34] everybody was afraid so and
[40:37] you know when Tommy and Osbourne
[40:39] testified about this experience he will
[40:42] tell you that
[40:43] when the man moved on the crowd and no I
[40:47] mean on the platform and nobody was
[40:50] stopping him he will tell you that it
[40:53] was just almost like
[40:56] the circus in the days in the Roman days
[41:00] you know when a man will be put in a
[41:03] circus with with a lion you know
[41:05] everybody will just be watching you know
[41:07] everybody will be on the edge of their
[41:08] seat you know they are watching to see
[41:11] what will happen they are also watching
[41:13] to see if the lanyard jump out of that
[41:15] fence they should be ready to go through
[41:18] the door themselves you know so
[41:19] everybody is watching what is going to
[41:22] happen what if that man you know killed
[41:26] the preacher who is going to be Nets you
[41:28] know so I mean everybody was at the edge
[41:30] of your seat but to see you know he
[41:33] testified to see how brother Branham was
[41:38] he was very kind you know he was you
[41:41] know he was just there was not any kind
[41:44] of all you know emotion and jumping up I
[41:47] mean he was just talking to the man and
[41:49] to just see how you know the Word of God
[41:53] on the tongue of a mortar man brought
[41:57] that spirit under control you know
[42:00] when Burt Branham says Satan in the name
[42:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ you know I
[42:06] rebuke you and I Mayfair across his feet
[42:08] he said after witnessing that
[42:12] he left from that meeting he spoke with
[42:16] Bert Brennan after the meeting he acts
[42:18] burr Branham if you know he could he
[42:22] could go into divine healing brother
[42:24] Branham says you know is is is a mad
[42:28] chapter system it's a promise for the
[42:30] church you know so he said he went
[42:32] straight he locked himself up in the
[42:35] room and every time Tommy Nussbaum from
[42:38] that from that experience every time
[42:40] when he went into the field the picture
[42:44] that was on his mind was a possessed man
[42:46] that was meeting the seven of God
[42:50] so every time he had to meet somebody
[42:53] that was blind or somebody that was
[42:56] crippled or somebody that couldn't speak
[42:58] whenever he would pray for the picture
[43:00] that was on his mind was what he
[43:03] witnessed in Oregon you see and
[43:06] sometimes that's the way God will do I
[43:08] mean he would do something and he will
[43:10] impress your spirit you know he will he
[43:14] will impress not only impress your
[43:16] spirit but he will imprint that thing on
[43:19] your spirit you can get away from it
[43:22] because you are you are our witness even
[43:25] if nobody was there
[43:27] nobody was there to witness David and
[43:30] the lion and David in the band but yet
[43:33] nobody as the Karishma or testimony can
[43:38] make david to change his story because
[43:39] he was there so
[43:47] they have just just got out of this
[43:50] meeting and seeing what happened there
[43:55] Jesus that man Jesus asked him what's
[43:58] your name he says you know he's legion
[44:01] because he's possessed with many demons
[44:04] and you saw everything they're happy and
[44:06] just as they came across the scripture
[44:09] says in verse 40 and it came to pass
[44:12] that when Jesus was returned the people
[44:16] gladly receive him for they were all
[44:19] waiting for him and behold they came a
[44:23] man named Jairus and he was a ruler of
[44:28] the synagogue's now brother Branham will
[44:30] also tell us about Jairus being a secret
[44:32] believers he's been following Jesus you
[44:35] know from one meeting to another meeting
[44:38] and and and you can do I mean you can
[44:40] understand that this gentleman they were
[44:43] all they had to disguise himself because
[44:46] they were there were rulers of the
[44:48] people there were men they were known in
[44:51] the synagogue now to find them on the
[44:54] you know on the mountainside when they
[44:57] have when they have the I mean the the
[45:00] big setting tears in the Aseema gas you
[45:04] know this said before the people and now
[45:06] they are on the mountainside you know
[45:08] sitting on a grass or sitting on a rock
[45:10] you know - I mean - to the a
[45:13] congregation that would be a disrespect
[45:15] I was just listening to a testimony
[45:19] enough of a gentleman a preacher by the
[45:22] name of Charles I
[45:25] can remember his soul name here but his
[45:29] his dad was pray for by brother Branham
[45:32] they were they came out of the
[45:35] the Church of Christ
[45:39] you know organization or Church of
[45:41] Christ movement and
[45:43] and even those days the Church of Christ
[45:47] were really Bible people I mean in the
[45:49] world there were people there were there
[45:51] were very good on their scriptures and
[45:53] all of that good Bible teaching group so
[45:56] I mean some of those things were all
[45:59] make the foundational brother loony
[46:02] Jenkins he also came from Church of
[46:04] Christ so they were very very good in
[46:07] the scriptural teachings so
[46:10] so this man he testified how being a
[46:15] being a boy he was just a boy and
[46:19] he's dead when his day I went to brother
[46:23] Branham meeting I think brother Brandon
[46:25] pray for his father he was in the
[46:27] meeting and I mean Ned only his father
[46:31] by the way there were different other
[46:34] people that brother Brandon caught out
[46:36] in the meeting and just being just being
[46:38] a young you know just being a young boy
[46:40] there those things never leave his mind
[46:43] you know he's not a message preacher but
[46:48] he says in his testimony you can say
[46:50] whatever you want to say it about what
[46:52] william branham that between you and God
[46:54] but I believe that he's a prophet
[46:57] and
[47:00] but in his testimony he talked about how
[47:04] when they came back from the meeting
[47:06] because his dad was one of the leaders
[47:08] in in a Church of Christ
[47:13] the Church of Christ organization called
[47:16] his father and both his father and his
[47:20] mother were going to be s communicated
[47:23] from the church because they were warned
[47:25] not to go to
[47:28] William Branham meeting because you know
[47:32] they just believed everything he was
[47:34] doing it was it was it was fanatics and
[47:36] then he says this the striking thing
[47:39] there was the other there was one of the
[47:41] ministers also
[47:44] in the Church of Christ that assembly he
[47:47] were also on the council that espero his
[47:50] parents but that Minister was in brother
[47:53] Branham meeting and brother Branham call
[47:56] him out and discern him an illness and
[47:59] told him he was going to be healed and
[48:02] and he sat in the council expelling you
[48:06] know a man that went to brother branham
[48:08] meeting and he says this man said
[48:10] nothing about it he says in trouble him
[48:14] being a young child why am I saying all
[48:16] of these things it was not an easy thing
[48:18] for people like Jairus that's one
[48:21] Nicodemo had to come by night it was not
[48:24] an easy thing there were the leaders
[48:28] there were the rulers of those days
[48:30] there were the people that
[48:32] their church members were looking up to
[48:36] now for them to be following Jesus
[48:39] publicly you know they had to struggle
[48:42] with it the new like Nicodemus says no
[48:46] man can do this work except he comes
[48:49] from God
[48:51] the new debt I believe India India India
[48:56] secret maybe there was a time when
[48:59] Nicodemus went to visit Jairus and the
[49:01] sudden and they talked about it and and
[49:04] Jarrah says I think I'm planning to
[49:07] leave I don't know when yet but I'm
[49:09] convinced that this man is the Messiah I
[49:17] convinced he says do you know I was in
[49:20] that meeting you know down down the road
[49:24] I
[49:25] mean that's setting street corner there
[49:27] was a house there he was having a prayer
[49:30] meeting and it brought someone through
[49:33] the roof I
[49:35] was in their meeting and that man was
[49:40] healed
[49:42] well this man he just went right back he
[49:45] speaks of the prophets he speaks of the
[49:48] son
[49:49] his magnifying Jehovah and one of the
[49:53] people I
[49:55] don't know when but I mean I'm making up
[49:59] my mind
[50:00] you know I'm making up my mind I mean we
[50:04] all can see that I mean the whole
[50:07] Sanhedrin Council is just turning to
[50:09] politics and I mean all we are doing is
[50:13] you know putting Council how to please
[50:15] Roman government in all of that you know
[50:19] God was dealing with the hearts
[50:23] he was seeing the sign of the Messiah
[50:27] I'm saying all of this to kind of
[50:29] forgive us a picture of what Jairus may
[50:32] have been dealing with but year is said
[50:35] it is in his own house
[50:39] you know sometimes God can be dealing
[50:42] with the heart of an individual and we
[50:44] stay you know we still making excuses we
[50:47] still putting it off and he will bring a
[50:50] situation right on our lap
[50:52] he will bring you right to our doorstep
[50:55] and
[50:58] that will be an opportunity for a man to
[51:02] walk publicly and says I believe the
[51:05] Lord Jesus as my Lord and Savior and I
[51:07] believe that is that is that is the very
[51:10] thing that took place here with Jairus
[51:13] here his daughter is sick
[51:15] 12 years old
[51:18] and now wash now this is the reason why
[51:21] I want to get to this
[51:23] place of the scripture 12 years old you
[51:27] see how the Bible kind of a play it out
[51:30] here Jairus dot over 12 years or Jesus
[51:33] was traveling with his 12 disciples the
[51:36] woman with a blood issue had this
[51:38] problem for 12 years
[51:42] praise the Lord and
[51:47] and even when Jesus left the scene that
[51:51] was when he multiplied bread and he got
[51:54] twelve baskets for
[51:57] so there's a number of twelve that is
[52:00] learning out here it's beautiful you
[52:04] will see why water I got a little bit
[52:07] captured two days as I was looking at
[52:09] that last night now so
[52:13] Jesus
[52:16] the Bible says verse 41 and behold there
[52:19] was a man named Jairus and he was a
[52:22] ruler of the synagogue and he fell down
[52:26] at Jesus feet in the
[52:29] before all of his congregation
[52:34] this time is no time to disguise himself
[52:37] he fell at Jesus feet
[52:42] praise the Lord and
[52:46] be sucked and besought him there he who
[52:50] come into his house for he had
[52:55] one only daughter about twelve years oh
[53:00] that's how serious it is here his only
[53:04] daughter his only daughter
[53:09] praise the Lord think about Abraham
[53:12] taking his own son
[53:15] think about Jeff
[53:19] tie-breaking his owner daughter the
[53:22] first thing that came out of his house
[53:24] and this was Jairus only daughter
[53:30] sometimes God have to put us into this
[53:34] kind of a situation to free us is just
[53:37] to free you
[53:39] because he's pulling you he's calling
[53:41] your attention and we are making excuses
[53:43] and we are hiding behind this and we are
[53:46] hiding behind this other one but Yura
[53:49] said his only daughter and being a ruler
[53:53] he was I mean up there in age maybe
[53:56] about 40 or so
[54:04] because of a within a Jewish law you
[54:07] have to be about thirty years that was
[54:09] the age of maturity
[54:11] for them to be able to give you
[54:13] responsibility
[54:14] so Jairus was updated in age and his
[54:17] only daughter was 12 years old
[54:20] praise the Lord
[54:23] images it sounds like a story we read it
[54:27] in the Bible we enjoy it but sometimes
[54:30] we have to get through there I was
[54:33] listening to brother Branham today
[54:34] talking about the the widow woman the
[54:38] widows are fighting when during the time
[54:42] of
[54:44] the farming in the land
[54:48] when everything was growing dried Elijah
[54:51] have said no ring no deal until I call
[54:55] for it and
[54:57] the scripture says she was she just had
[55:01] her last
[55:02] you know I was thinking about the air as
[55:04] I was listening to it I was thinking
[55:07] about it I says well if you have really
[55:11] never got to the place where you hire
[55:13] your last meal there is no way that
[55:16] scripture can make sense to you it can
[55:19] only be letters if you have really never
[55:22] got to the place to experience having
[55:25] your last meal and not knowing where the
[55:28] next one is coming from or you have
[55:31] never experienced
[55:34] seeing your your mother facing food and
[55:39] you know that there is there is nothing
[55:42] for her to eat and you actually say sir
[55:45] where is your she said no I'm okay you
[55:48] know Barbra I'm talk there stir it in
[55:50] and he says you know from a family of 10
[55:53] and the kind of a background where he
[55:56] came from many days you see their mother
[55:58] after giving them something to eat their
[56:02] father gone away chancing and he goes he
[56:05] I mean work and going drink and come
[56:08] home drawing and there were just no
[56:10] money it's a mini day I saw mama crying
[56:13] but yes she says she was four and you
[56:17] knew that she never ate anything
[56:21] praise the Lord
[56:24] sometimes I mean we just we just try to
[56:27] process these things in our mind and all
[56:30] we can do we can just sympathize with it
[56:33] but if you had never got to the place to
[56:37] experience
[56:39] the last meal and not knowing where your
[56:43] nest Mew is coming from
[56:49] if you have never got to the place to
[56:52] experience and only try being sake close
[56:56] to death you can only sympathize with
[56:59] Jarah story and
[57:02] only tried
[57:04] or maybe not an only child but one of
[57:08] your child being sick close to death
[57:12] when the physician had diagnosed her and
[57:15] says well I
[57:17] mean let's let's just let's just trust
[57:21] you hover or let just believe God when
[57:26] the medical doctor comes to that place
[57:28] and says well let's just believe God
[57:30] which means he has tried everything he
[57:32] know in his practice
[57:37] the thing that will make a ruler in
[57:40] Israel a ruler of the synagogue
[57:45] to fall flat on the ground
[57:49] in the middle of the city Jesus just
[57:53] enter in the city I
[57:56] mean
[57:58] I mean it's just it just or a
[58:02] communication I was moving about oh yeah
[58:04] they say he's coming sometimes they say
[58:07] he's coming everybody going wait for him
[58:08] he never show up
[58:11] maybe two three days the people are
[58:13] waiting for him he never showed up now
[58:15] as soon as he entered oh yeah his inter
[58:17] the news go all around Jerez just put
[58:20] him his rod and run down the street and
[58:25] he fell before our Lord
[58:28] you think about that
[58:38] times I mean we we give ourselves a lot
[58:42] of mental condition even to raise our
[58:44] hands and worship the Lord and I mean to
[58:48] really get in the spirit world we are
[58:51] not mining was listening or was looking
[58:54] at us we can just I mean I prostrate on
[58:57] our knees or stand up and just raise our
[59:00] hands to the Lord just because you are
[59:03] just feeling his presence and just
[59:06] feeling in need of him and saying lord I
[59:09] need you
[59:11] sometimes we are so conditioned but who
[59:15] is looking and who is thinking and wound
[59:17] X is going to to talk about it but yet
[59:19] jerez right in the middle of the Senate
[59:21] the scripture says he just lay himself
[59:24] on the ground
[59:28] praise the Lord
[59:45] you saw him that he will come to his
[59:47] house for for he had only one daughter
[59:52] about 12 years old 12 years of age and
[59:56] she
[59:58] and she
[59:59] lie a dime and as he when the
[1:00:07] people thrown him and a woman having an
[1:00:11] issue of blood twelve years twelve years
[1:00:15] or girl is dying he has another woman
[1:00:19] here with another problem an issue of
[1:00:23] blood this is the woman that we want to
[1:00:25] look at a little bit a certain woman we
[1:00:28] might get back to Jairus because he saw
[1:00:30] this woman problem before he got to
[1:00:32] Jairus problem II he meant Amen now this
[1:00:38] certain woman I want to look at setting
[1:00:43] year in the sense of faith I want to
[1:00:47] look at setting in the sense of being
[1:00:51] absolutely sure of something I'm not
[1:00:55] looking at certain in the sense that we
[1:00:57] don't know her name
[1:00:59] praise the Lord
[1:01:01] because I believe that God was pleased
[1:01:06] with her action more than her name
[1:01:09] if he wanted for us to know her name he
[1:01:15] would have given it to Jesus by the
[1:01:17] sermon and saying woman Susanna you are
[1:01:22] the one that touch me
[1:01:24] but her name was net in much concerned
[1:01:29] to God even though he knows her name but
[1:01:32] her action
[1:01:33] the absolute certainty she had in her
[1:01:38] that if I touch the hem of His garment I
[1:01:43] will be healed
[1:01:46] now the thing that that struck me here
[1:01:49] is there I
[1:01:53] believe that is that is some of the
[1:01:56] reason why I mean
[1:01:58] storage is so unique and
[1:02:02] I would like to say
[1:02:05] that this woman was a gentle woman
[1:02:10] you said brother one what is your
[1:02:13] scripture authority for you to say there
[1:02:16] you know as I was looking at the other
[1:02:20] clues in the Bible with all of these
[1:02:22] twelve
[1:02:23] last night something just just struck my
[1:02:27] mind I said well
[1:02:30] when I was studying I said well let me
[1:02:33] go back and look at something there is
[1:02:35] something that I think is missing
[1:02:37] because we have to realize that the the
[1:02:41] Jews by tradition they were taught about
[1:02:44] a lot of Moses that when a woman was in
[1:02:50] experiencing and in a form of you know
[1:02:54] purification she was not to go out of
[1:02:57] her house so
[1:03:01] to the Jews and a
[1:03:04] woman in this kind of a state you know
[1:03:08] she was an unclean woman
[1:03:11] and if she's bound by the law she will
[1:03:16] have to stay in her house she
[1:03:20] will need to get out of this condition
[1:03:24] of blood issue before she can go and
[1:03:28] then the priest can pronounce her clean
[1:03:32] so I believe that is the thing that is
[1:03:36] the thing and what actually it is is the
[1:03:40] inspiration that she had
[1:03:43] because just that thought in her mind
[1:03:45] you have to remember where Branham says
[1:03:48] there is no a stripper giving there is
[1:03:52] no promise in a word
[1:03:54] there is no promise in the Old Testament
[1:03:57] there is no promise in a structure about
[1:04:01] touching the hem of a garment to get
[1:04:04] healing
[1:04:05] praise the Lord
[1:04:15] and you know in a Jewish tradition as
[1:04:20] well when a person has a
[1:04:23] situation that has cross is
[1:04:27] it's time like maybe you know it's a
[1:04:31] situation for a week like and and a and
[1:04:34] and and a wonderful thing there is
[1:04:36] theorem you go back to Leviticus chapter
[1:04:38] 12 it is in Leviticus chapter 12 where
[1:04:42] Moses instructed you know Israel how the
[1:04:46] women must d-wave their purification
[1:04:50] so 12 it's all playing out here tonight
[1:04:53] it's the Lord so but after
[1:04:57] after a situation even if a person had a
[1:05:01] driest cup on their hands and they go to
[1:05:05] the priest they said well you are
[1:05:07] unclean going staying in your house for
[1:05:09] seven days after seven days you go back
[1:05:11] and the scab has not it's not going away
[1:05:14] and they give you another seven days and
[1:05:16] after seven days you have not gone away
[1:05:18] they cast you out
[1:05:21] this is a leper said this is a nucleus
[1:05:25] they separates you away from the people
[1:05:30] but the Gentiles were now all of these
[1:05:33] laws
[1:05:35] the Gentiles were not living by these
[1:05:38] laws so for a woman with a blood issue
[1:05:41] of 12 years
[1:05:44] to be able to gather herself together
[1:05:47] and
[1:05:51] move in in in that crowd
[1:05:54] for her to be able to get the the
[1:05:57] boldness the courage
[1:06:02] everybody talking in the town this this
[1:06:05] man that that was possessed with legions
[1:06:08] of demons have just been healed I mean
[1:06:11] that the news have gone across the river
[1:06:13] everybody knew this man and I believe
[1:06:18] she sat in her home and she says my if
[1:06:23] am and thou has gone away from his
[1:06:27] family locked up in Chains
[1:06:29] can come back to his right mind I
[1:06:32] believe if I can't get in his presence
[1:06:39] what what was happening from what he
[1:06:42] have done it's creatively fit for us for
[1:06:46] her
[1:06:48] faith does not comes by what we do it
[1:06:52] comes from the finished work of cavalry
[1:06:59] they're one of the reason why we
[1:07:01] struggle is because we are now looking
[1:07:04] at what Christ have already done
[1:07:07] we are we are counting on what we do
[1:07:10] daily
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:13] that is a place where our struggle is
[1:07:16] that's the reason why our faith is up
[1:07:19] and down but if we can keep our eyes on
[1:07:22] his finished work you know that is the
[1:07:24] reason why the angel of the Lord told
[1:07:27] brother Branham fall for those things to
[1:07:29] be on tape because when you listen to
[1:07:31] the testimony of what God has done in
[1:07:34] your being
[1:07:36] it builds faith
[1:07:40] that is the major purpose for the tapes
[1:07:43] is to keep our faith built up because
[1:07:46] the son of man to ask a question if he
[1:07:49] come will dare be fit with all of the
[1:07:53] things that are happening around us is
[1:07:55] so hard to have faith but faith comes
[1:07:58] from the world and the things that God
[1:08:00] has done in our day that's the thing
[1:08:03] that gets frayed
[1:08:08] that is the thing that inspired that
[1:08:10] woman
[1:08:14] because this news has gone abroad
[1:08:19] the man that was bound in chains
[1:08:23] someone is saying so he and his wife in
[1:08:26] the market shopping really people going
[1:08:29] across the river to see the man
[1:08:36] going across the river trying to
[1:08:39] interview him
[1:08:43] you know when when Christ bring you back
[1:08:46] to your right mind sometimes you don't
[1:08:47] even remember where you came from
[1:08:50] there's not much you can say about it
[1:08:54] and
[1:08:56] this news is all the browning and she
[1:09:00] read it and
[1:09:01] she's there
[1:09:04] she got on herself
[1:09:06] now you have to see there is a constancy
[1:09:10] in the scripture
[1:09:12] of word that the the Gentile faith and
[1:09:18] the Jewish faith wave all through the
[1:09:20] scripture
[1:09:24] you remember
[1:09:27] the the Roman centurion
[1:09:31] when you read the story after he told
[1:09:35] Jesus
[1:09:37] and says I'm a man of authority if you
[1:09:41] read the scripture you will see how
[1:09:43] because brother Branham used there to
[1:09:46] show the Gentile faith that was in the
[1:09:48] word and the Jewish faith there were by
[1:09:52] the laying of hands
[1:09:54] and Yura said is a very same thing also
[1:09:58] year here is a Jewish ruler of the
[1:10:01] sealing girls coming to Jesus falling
[1:10:04] down at his feet inviting him to his
[1:10:06] house and here is a Gentile woman not
[1:10:10] even wanting him to come not even
[1:10:12] wanting him to know who she is
[1:10:16] she's not she's not concerned about nor
[1:10:20] II mean you know she she hid herself
[1:10:23] squat down put my hand between the crowd
[1:10:25] if I can just touch the hem of His
[1:10:29] garment
[1:10:34] praise the Lord
[1:10:41] Charis
[1:10:42] he sees the crowd
[1:10:45] because everybody know he said ruler of
[1:10:48] Israel they will now walk over him so
[1:10:50] everybody oh oh hold on hold on hold on
[1:10:54] hold on hold on charis is on the ground
[1:10:58] he got the attention of the crowd
[1:11:01] everybody is listening to him master
[1:11:03] please come my daughter is dying he
[1:11:06] everybody listening to his testimony but
[1:11:08] this woman never said a word to anybody
[1:11:10] she said it in her heart she was sitting
[1:11:17] she was certain that if I touch the hem
[1:11:22] of his coming
[1:11:26] praise Allah oh
[1:11:29] my god she was certain in her heart that
[1:11:34] if I can touch the hem of His garment I
[1:11:38] know this blood issue of two of years
[1:11:46] praise the Lord
[1:11:50] Charles before the crowd announced him
[1:11:53] to everybody my only daughter of 12
[1:11:56] years masters she's dying he's sick to
[1:12:00] death she's just 12 years and it's woman
[1:12:04] saying in her heart
[1:12:12] I
[1:12:19] believe with the with the the the
[1:12:22] the order of the sealing gasps Jerez
[1:12:26] hearing he was coming you wash his feet
[1:12:28] he wash his hand he went in and and I
[1:12:30] mean I spread himself and do everything
[1:12:33] that he had to do because that's what
[1:12:35] the synagogue's told them to do but it's
[1:12:38] what she
[1:12:40] denied it here how she smell
[1:12:43] she didn't hear who says what
[1:12:47] something has told her if he can do then
[1:12:51] across the river he can do the same for
[1:12:55] me and that is the thing that's the
[1:12:57] thing that brings fate is now your works
[1:12:59] if you believing that if God did it in
[1:13:03] his word if God did it for one young
[1:13:06] person God can do the same for you
[1:13:10] if he gives the Holy Ghost he still
[1:13:14] giving the Holy Ghost today if he can
[1:13:16] change people live he still changing
[1:13:18] life today he can still deliver today
[1:13:21] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:13:23] and forever
[1:13:29] praise the Lord
[1:13:33] amen I
[1:13:35] think many
[1:13:37] has got
[1:13:39] this calculation wrong
[1:13:42] we think is faith work and salvation
[1:13:48] faith work equal salvation no is faith
[1:13:53] in salvation that produce worse
[1:14:00] because the words is just a fruit
[1:14:05] that comes from you believing that God
[1:14:08] has already save you the fruit that
[1:14:10] comes from you believing that he has
[1:14:13] already hear you it's not what you do to
[1:14:16] be here it's not what you do to be saved
[1:14:18] he's believing in the sacrifice because
[1:14:22] there is nothing none of us can do to
[1:14:25] appease God
[1:14:28] it's not faith plus work equals
[1:14:31] salvation no
[1:14:33] it's not what we do it's what we believe
[1:14:38] that he have already done
[1:14:44] brings alone that's what Jesus said if I
[1:14:49] be lifted up and we draw all men to me
[1:14:53] in a sense if you put my finish work
[1:14:57] before you
[1:15:00] Moses said if you look at the brazen
[1:15:03] serpent you will be here
[1:15:07] if you put my finished work before you
[1:15:10] if you believe in what I have already
[1:15:13] done what I've already promised
[1:15:16] Paul says because you are you are a son
[1:15:20] you are a daughter that's why God
[1:15:22] promised the Holy Ghost because you had
[1:15:25] a child of God you are bound to have the
[1:15:29] Spirit of God it's not what you do
[1:15:33] together Spirit is because you are a son
[1:15:35] it's because you are a time
[1:15:39] praise the Lord
[1:15:42] his frame has gone all over the place
[1:15:45] see how the scripture lay it out it was
[1:15:48] just from one thing to another
[1:15:50] he can't seven spirit after Mary Matalin
[1:15:53] and all the women and ministered unto
[1:15:55] Him came came around
[1:15:57] after he left him he went with his
[1:16:00] disciple in the boat he was actually
[1:16:02] going to deliver this man and why he
[1:16:06] rested the bible says the boat was
[1:16:09] toasting here and there
[1:16:12] amen see what is happening here see what
[1:16:16] God allowed the disciples to experience
[1:16:20] they are going on a mission to deliver a
[1:16:24] man so what Jesus will allow them to
[1:16:27] bump into is to shake their fear
[1:16:31] he gave them an experience right on the
[1:16:34] river
[1:16:38] he wanted to beat them out of that fear
[1:16:41] why because they did not had that
[1:16:44] experience
[1:16:45] they are doubt who have handled a man
[1:16:48] healing
[1:16:49] so he shaped them in her own
[1:16:54] what manner of man is this whoa the
[1:16:59] Wayne in a way to bed his voice
[1:17:02] what he did he got their spirit in the
[1:17:05] right position so
[1:17:10] when he across the river and it finally
[1:17:15] realized oh no I just thought you were
[1:17:20] coming to preach man possessing change
[1:17:23] Wow
[1:17:24] my goodness
[1:17:26] they were net shaking the game because
[1:17:30] they knew that every one of them could
[1:17:33] have died on that seat that night if he
[1:17:37] did not deliver them that could have
[1:17:39] been the end of their life if he's able
[1:17:41] to bring them through a tempest he's
[1:17:44] able to deliver them from the maniac
[1:17:46] that's
[1:17:48] what God would do in the life of the
[1:17:51] believer he would bring us through one
[1:17:53] situation to prepare us for another
[1:17:56] challenge
[1:17:57] so when we face another challenge we can
[1:18:00] look back and say the God that delivered
[1:18:02] me from the lion will deliver me from
[1:18:04] the bed the god that delivered me from
[1:18:06] the bed will deliver me from a go liar
[1:18:10] that's what he would allow us to
[1:18:13] go through those things
[1:18:19] try so lord
[1:18:22] we when she drew me sure and Abednego so
[1:18:27] Daniel walking out of the lion's den
[1:18:30] that evening
[1:18:36] everyone went there and it came when our
[1:18:39] princes Daniel how you doing
[1:18:43] he said yes King Moyer and
[1:18:52] everybody was looking when he saw dying
[1:18:56] Daniel walking out of the line of Dane
[1:18:59] when life Lions tell me behind him they
[1:19:04] say even if God don't deliver us we
[1:19:07] wouldn't have bad down
[1:19:10] the God that delivered Daniel from the
[1:19:13] lion Dane is able to bring us out of the
[1:19:15] fire of funny
[1:19:17] so God will you that's the stuff it is
[1:19:20] bill fit is not built in what you try to
[1:19:23] do how much you try to keep the
[1:19:26] commandment fit is built in what you see
[1:19:29] God has already done
[1:19:31] that's not fit is built
[1:19:37] there's a reason why when brother
[1:19:39] Branham talks about
[1:19:42] the tear-proof faith he leased him with
[1:19:45] all the things that happen over and over
[1:19:48] he says it right in a hedge white house
[1:19:52] he was talking about speaking those
[1:19:54] scholars in to assist him that was the
[1:19:56] thing that bill feet in her heart for
[1:19:58] her to say brother Brennan is nothing
[1:20:00] but the truth
[1:20:03] we have to be certain God is looking for
[1:20:07] sons and daughters that are setting
[1:20:11] they are sure of what they are believing
[1:20:19] you don't have to know all the doctrines
[1:20:22] all you have to know that God is real
[1:20:32] praise the Lord all you have to know
[1:20:34] that God is real he's real and he's a
[1:20:39] life
[1:20:41] praise the Lord oh
[1:20:44] my
[1:20:47] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:20:50] was talking with young people one time
[1:20:52] Isis with all of this happiness people
[1:20:55] are dying around the word
[1:20:57] and if somebody asks you if with all of
[1:21:01] these people are dying in and
[1:21:02] coronavirus came people every word is
[1:21:05] God's Tahrir to you what would you say
[1:21:10] Amen praise the Lord
[1:21:16] and all the young people gave the
[1:21:20] different encouraging
[1:21:24] answers that thought of in their mind
[1:21:29] sometimes it's just simple
[1:21:32] little area say I would say I'm a life
[1:21:36] that proof that God is real because I'm
[1:21:39] alive I
[1:21:41] say all my goodness I couldn't come up
[1:21:44] with a better answer like that I'm
[1:21:45] trying to look for some kind of a
[1:21:47] mystery to it to explain that God is
[1:21:50] real and she sees my answer I'm alive
[1:21:53] and since I'm alive God is real praise
[1:21:57] the Lord
[1:22:02] simple faith
[1:22:06] being searching of God
[1:22:10] and where Brennan talks about that all
[1:22:12] through the scripture how even there to
[1:22:16] the widow of Zarephath she was so
[1:22:19] certain
[1:22:21] that Elijah said
[1:22:25] asking her
[1:22:30] to face him the last take
[1:22:35] and she know she had a baby if she was
[1:22:40] not setting of God
[1:22:42] she would have done it
[1:22:44] when people when we tried to cut corners
[1:22:48] we are not setting of God
[1:22:50] we think we have faith
[1:22:53] instead of just trusting God and
[1:22:57] spreading our wings and giving God the
[1:22:59] opportunity to show himself in our
[1:23:02] situation we
[1:23:05] calculate everything when you went after
[1:23:07] you feeling calculating and get your
[1:23:10] answer you make it difficult for God to
[1:23:13] show a miracle
[1:23:14] because faith is
[1:23:17] substance of things not seen and well if
[1:23:21] you get an answer you have already seen
[1:23:23] it you already know what it will come up
[1:23:25] to you said two plus two is four
[1:23:29] you already get an answer
[1:23:32] it's written there glow we're not coming
[1:23:36] in in a miracle to make a mysterious and
[1:23:39] say two plus two is eight
[1:23:42] he was you already got an answer
[1:23:45] but you just trust the law and you just
[1:23:48] you just launch out into the deep
[1:23:51] being setting of God she was 13
[1:23:55] she's not a setting woman because we
[1:23:58] don't know her name you know there there
[1:24:00] are places in the scripture where the
[1:24:02] Bible talks about setting man creep you
[1:24:03] know in in a way
[1:24:07] so the Bible talks
[1:24:10] described in setting
[1:24:12] not knowing their names not giving us
[1:24:16] their names
[1:24:17] but I also describe
[1:24:21] the arts the things that we do creeping
[1:24:24] on a way to discourage the Brethren's to
[1:24:27] become
[1:24:30] you know a hair in our meal
[1:24:36] but this woman she was a certain woman
[1:24:41] because she was certain in her heart
[1:24:44] that if she touched the hem of His
[1:24:47] garment
[1:24:50] she never said it to anybody
[1:24:55] jesus never had a
[1:24:59] vision about her situation either
[1:25:03] and when she pull on a gift he turned
[1:25:06] around and said who touched me
[1:25:11] praise the Lord
[1:25:15] she turned around and said who touched
[1:25:17] me or
[1:25:20] he turned around Jesus and I believe the
[1:25:24] woman
[1:25:24] she was just
[1:25:27] with her held back down
[1:25:31] because she had to get so Lord to be
[1:25:34] able to touch them the hem of His
[1:25:36] garment
[1:25:37] trying to struggle among the people with
[1:25:40] her hair barred down a woman is shame
[1:25:42] because she knows what her situation is
[1:25:45] even though nobody know her hair bad
[1:25:47] down
[1:25:49] and with Jesus move in that direction
[1:25:54] he never caught her by the eyes he
[1:25:56] contacted her by the spirit
[1:26:02] praise the Lord
[1:26:04] and they are before all the people who
[1:26:08] know
[1:26:09] my goodness
[1:26:11] Jesus is your fake I believe when he
[1:26:15] contacted her by the spirit he said
[1:26:18] because I don't think that a look and
[1:26:22] mic and all of these disciples that
[1:26:24] wrote of this account I don't believe
[1:26:26] that is a woman that went and says you
[1:26:28] know here he he he content her by the
[1:26:30] spirit and says woman
[1:26:32] you've been suffering from a blood issue
[1:26:34] for 12 years I can see how those
[1:26:39] hypocrite Pharisee whoa
[1:26:43] because today I'm a woman in that
[1:26:46] situation must not even be in this crowd
[1:26:49] but he says your faith it's may be hard
[1:26:55] he that knows her situation right there
[1:26:59] he gave her the resort you are you are
[1:27:03] healed gold your faith has made you
[1:27:05] whole and
[1:27:08] what happened also
[1:27:11] Jesus telling a woman that she had a
[1:27:14] blood issue for 12 years I
[1:27:17] believe it also created faith in Jerez
[1:27:21] heart there his daughter 12 years old if
[1:27:25] he can tell this woman
[1:27:28] that never said nothing to him about her
[1:27:31] situation
[1:27:33] he did not mention it she did not
[1:27:36] mention it she just only reached out by
[1:27:39] faith
[1:27:40] if he can know the woman's situation and
[1:27:45] pronounce her to be well
[1:27:49] it also created faith
[1:27:54] because when Jesus said would touch me
[1:27:57] nobody answer the woman did not pull her
[1:28:00] hands up
[1:28:02] she was so sure she
[1:28:05] has try a little fit in her heart a
[1:28:09] little inspiration that she had
[1:28:21] but a scare that's what I like reading
[1:28:24] this man of faith I
[1:28:28] was listening to George Muller testimony
[1:28:34] they call him the modern Enoch
[1:28:40] the morning Enoch
[1:28:45] the man that got married to his wife and
[1:28:50] he sold everything that he had until his
[1:28:53] wife that they would have to believe in
[1:28:56] God
[1:29:00] so everything that he had a
[1:29:05] man a man brother Branham talks about
[1:29:09] Josh Muller a
[1:29:11] man in in this our generation in the
[1:29:16] Gentile Iraq in the New Testament age
[1:29:20] that took God at His Word
[1:29:26] he took God at His Word
[1:29:35] he says he says
[1:29:38] he believed
[1:29:43] in the power of prayer the power of
[1:29:48] communion with God
[1:29:51] he believed in the power of communion
[1:29:56] it's not about
[1:29:59] shaking is not about beating it's not
[1:30:02] about how much we cry is just believing
[1:30:05] God you are setting that you are serving
[1:30:09] a Living God when you pray you must be
[1:30:12] setting that God ears are open to you
[1:30:15] you
[1:30:16] must be searching that you have just
[1:30:19] spoke to God he wanted to buy a land for
[1:30:22] an orphanage
[1:30:24] he had this burden on his heart
[1:30:27] to buy this huge Lane for an orphanage
[1:30:31] he went down in the field and he prayed
[1:30:34] and said God I need this place
[1:30:39] now very night the owner of the land had
[1:30:44] a dream
[1:30:47] had a dream dream about Josh mullet
[1:30:51] wanting to buy his land he woke up in
[1:30:54] the morning with that burden on his
[1:30:56] heart
[1:30:58] gotta fry his house went down looking
[1:31:01] for Josh mother
[1:31:03] and he finally says sir I had a dream
[1:31:06] last night and
[1:31:09] I
[1:31:11] dreamed that you you were thinking about
[1:31:14] building

[1:31:19] about putting married away and God come
[1:31:22] by night and and revered to Joseph don't
[1:31:24] pull me right away
[1:31:27] Joseph don't need an interpretation for
[1:31:29] that dream
[1:31:31] he knew that God have just answer the
[1:31:34] question that was in his heart it's
[1:31:37] being certain of God
[1:31:41] this bra setting bride she knows that
[1:31:45] she's the bride of Jesus Christ it's not
[1:31:48] a guesswork we are certain there will be
[1:31:50] a rapture we are setting there will be a
[1:31:52] bother change
[1:31:54] we are certain that this word is not our
[1:31:57] home
[1:31:59] this woman was searching
[1:32:06] if you touch
[1:32:08] the hem of His garment
[1:32:12] she would be he'll
[1:32:15] praise the Lord
[1:32:18] there is one China one major China that
[1:32:23] you can speak to God
[1:32:25] it's by prayer
[1:32:31] one major China whether you open your
[1:32:36] eyes to pray what are you close your
[1:32:39] eyes what are you laying on your bed
[1:32:40] what are you knee down

[1:32:55] take we gotta show him reverence
[1:33:00] it's you been sitting ignoring the one
[1:33:04] that you are speaking to
[1:33:08] you can lay flat on the floor if you are
[1:33:11] not setting you will wake up from the
[1:33:13] floor just like how you lay down there
[1:33:17] you can cry and pull your eyes out if
[1:33:21] you are not setting if you are not come
[1:33:24] to resolve in your mind that I'm not
[1:33:27] talking to the walls around me I'm
[1:33:29] talking to the very one that holds the
[1:33:32] life that holds the breath that I
[1:33:34] breathe being certain of God
[1:33:39] the intention of God is not setting that
[1:33:42] the message is truth being setting of
[1:33:45] God is not setting that the Bible is the
[1:33:47] Word of God being setting of God that
[1:33:49] there is a God
[1:33:51] he's above
[1:33:53] he is God he's real he he's a life
[1:34:01] and Paul says in Romans
[1:34:04] he's not so far
[1:34:08] he's just so close
[1:34:12] that's close us when you call his name
[1:34:22] he's never too busy
[1:34:26] that is the beautiful thing about the
[1:34:29] God that we self he takes time to listen
[1:34:31] to all of his children
[1:34:33] and
[1:34:35] there is known that that there is it's a
[1:34:39] preference child
[1:34:41] to say that if I pray two hours wish me
[1:34:43] go away yeah my prayer first before he
[1:34:46] hears the sister prayer or he hear the
[1:34:48] brother prayer
[1:34:50] he takes time and he listened to his
[1:34:53] children
[1:34:57] we must be certain that we are serving a
[1:35:01] Living God and there is nothing too high
[1:35:04] for God if you believe that put your
[1:35:08] faith to test don't just tell me in an
[1:35:10] amen put your feet to test launch your
[1:35:13] boat over the water trust God and take a
[1:35:16] step by faith
[1:35:18] don't get me in an amen take a step of
[1:35:21] faith be searching and know that God is
[1:35:24] with you he promised he will never leave
[1:35:27] us he will never forsake us
[1:35:32] God wants to show himself in our life
[1:35:35] more than we want to see him
[1:35:37] we are just all in this mental
[1:35:40] conception we can even release faith
[1:35:43] from our heart and say God I would
[1:35:45] believe you you can provide for me
[1:35:48] man when I listen to George Mulla
[1:35:51] testimony and I just I said to myself I
[1:35:53] said Lord I'm so ashamed of myself
[1:35:55] this man trusted God and God never
[1:36:00] failed him
[1:36:02] man filled him a
[1:36:05] man walking with God
[1:36:10] he lost his son Elijah
[1:36:14] but yet he still trusted God he was this
[1:36:17] setting that God is God
[1:36:27] that's the children that God it's
[1:36:30] breathing in this age that's the
[1:36:32] children that's the people that God has
[1:36:34] send this message to and people that
[1:36:37] would be setting of God
[1:36:40] now people that would be so scared I
[1:36:43] mean just so scary fear it's in our mind
[1:36:50] we are not going to be fanatics and and
[1:36:53] I mean an arrogant about what we are
[1:36:55] doing and say like I don't believe in
[1:36:56] this coronavirus Tov is faking it we're
[1:36:59] not going to do that but yet instead we
[1:37:01] believe that God is God
[1:37:03] we believe that God is God
[1:37:06] we trust him more than we trusted the
[1:37:11] system we trust him and we believe his
[1:37:15] word
[1:37:16] we wake up in the morning dad and and in
[1:37:20] the China of God that's why I was going
[1:37:22] to speak on tonight a channel of
[1:37:24] inspiration the China that you can speak
[1:37:26] to god it's true prayer and the China
[1:37:28] that God can speak to you it's through
[1:37:30] his word
[1:37:32] if you want to hear the voice of God you
[1:37:35] got to love the Word of God
[1:37:37] you got to read it you got to learn to
[1:37:40] meditate upon it teach your children to
[1:37:42] read the word and meditate upon it
[1:37:48] when you hear people saying God speaks
[1:37:51] to me is the very word that you have
[1:37:53] read I hear II Eccles in your ear
[1:37:57] he takes his word oh my goodness me oh
[1:38:01] my goodness what is the time but a
[1:38:03] journey it's after 9 o'clock I'm not
[1:38:06] preached like this before this Wednesday
[1:38:08] night but I'm feeling so good
[1:38:12] I'm telling you I'm feeling so good
[1:38:19] that's the people that are preparing for
[1:38:22] the rapture and people that are
[1:38:23] searching that their body will be
[1:38:25] changed not thinking what I I will
[1:38:28] rapture I mean we order this thing happy
[1:38:30] if I miss the rapture as the rapture
[1:38:32] ticket I mean all those kind of for ugly
[1:38:34] tops
[1:38:35] you have to know who your God is done
[1:38:38] you're saying then I will know their God
[1:38:40] in this age they will do X plot
[1:38:44] they will do X plot oh
[1:38:56] I love their little song gave me faith
[1:39:00] strong faith now fate that moves the
[1:39:04] mounting buffet that moves me I
[1:39:07] won the faith that moves me to
[1:39:11] obey God's Word the faith that moves me
[1:39:15] to believe God even when nothing seems
[1:39:18] to look right they believe that God is
[1:39:22] in control I mean when you when you are
[1:39:25] so setting of God like that it makes no
[1:39:27] room to compromise
[1:39:30] because you're not going to give the
[1:39:32] devil any room for him to get any kind
[1:39:35] of a priest or attention in your life
[1:39:37] because you know that God is there no
[1:39:40] matter how high it is you think about a
[1:39:43] woman looking at her own a son and
[1:39:46] giving the last meal to Elijah she was
[1:39:49] setting of God
[1:39:52] she was a setting woman a woman that I
[1:39:55] was sure of what she was doing
[1:40:01] when Elijah spoke to her she said as the
[1:40:04] Lord God liveth that was her testimony
[1:40:07] that was the thing she taught in life as
[1:40:10] the Lord God liveth
[1:40:13] she's sitting in another word she's
[1:40:15] saying if God is a life saying it God
[1:40:19] it's a life I feed it in my hands I feel
[1:40:22] it in my feet
[1:40:26] it's not just a song it's a setting
[1:40:30] statement it's a short statement
[1:40:34] as the Lord God liveth
[1:40:42] praise the Lord
[1:40:44] she was a setting woman
[1:40:48] she was a setting woman she was she she
[1:40:52] she manifests the Gentile using the gift
[1:40:56] using what God has provided for us
[1:41:05] we are so scared to death
[1:41:08] but yeah we have mouths when we are
[1:41:12] talking I said to say we just came from
[1:41:13] the lion's den and put all the Lions to
[1:41:17] sleep but we are so scared
[1:41:21] scared just to trust God for the little
[1:41:24] things just to trust God just zero your
[1:41:28] mind on I believe God it shall be done
[1:41:31] even as he said god bless you - nice
[1:41:34] stuff I mean you can come let's sing
[1:41:36] their chorus zero in your mind on I
[1:41:39] believe God how it will happen huh you
[1:41:43] just zero your mind on and you take the
[1:41:47] step of faith you poured your feet into
[1:41:49] actions
[1:41:52] we want to put God on our calendar God I
[1:41:55] mean I need you to do this on a second I
[1:41:58] want this to be done on a TED you mean
[1:42:00] on a Terry first this is how it's going
[1:42:02] to be you know we have all of these
[1:42:04] things playing out and there is no room
[1:42:06] to see God moving
[1:42:09] being certain of God in a time of
[1:42:12] uncertainty
[1:42:14] we have to be certain of God
[1:42:20] we are going to take all the measures
[1:42:22] that we can take to keep the assembly
[1:42:27] safe but we are setting of God
[1:42:31] that's the reason why I want the prayer
[1:42:33] meetings to continue I want the people
[1:42:36] to warm yourself up praying
[1:42:39] see in the presence of God see in that
[1:42:43] warm atmosphere of his spirit when you
[1:42:47] come out you're not coming with with
[1:42:48] with fear in your mind and just thinking
[1:42:51] and looking at this person and looking
[1:42:53] at it I mean your mind is or we are to
[1:42:55] be setting up God
[1:43:01] hello bless you tonight sorry for taking
[1:43:04] much of your time
[1:43:06] amen
[1:43:11] let's just sing that together tonight I
[1:43:14] believe God it shall be done even as he
[1:43:17] said
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:29] being certain of God

[1:45:30] it shall be done even as you said it not
[1:45:33] how I think about it now how I feel
[1:45:36] about it but just as you said it it
[1:45:39] shall be done a certain woman this bride
[1:45:42] is a certain woman she's not a confused
[1:45:45] woman she's a certain woman that she
[1:45:48] will be changed she will be raptured
[1:45:50] she's a certain woman you know that she
[1:45:53] will overcome in this age she's not
[1:45:56] trusting in her strength she's believing
[1:45:59] in the finished work that's that's the
[1:46:02] reason why she's feeling her mind with
[1:46:03] what Jesus did if he did it yesterday he
[1:46:06] can do the same today we have to put our
[1:46:09] faith in a finish work

[1:46:26] year
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:28] the devil knows like the Bible say he
[1:46:31] believe that it is true that's the
[1:46:32] reason why he never even stopped it from
[1:46:34] being in the Bible because he knows his
[1:46:37] truth
[1:46:38] he knows that all of this record is
[1:46:41] truth
