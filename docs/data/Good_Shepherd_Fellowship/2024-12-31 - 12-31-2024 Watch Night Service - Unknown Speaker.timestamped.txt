[1:28:57] brother brother uh uh Ariel dad uh
[1:29:03] surprised me one time I came there was
[1:29:06] one Saturday night uh evening I drove
[1:29:08] here I was trying to find a place to
[1:29:11] rest my head a little bit and I saw he
[1:29:13] and his daughter you know trying to do
[1:29:15] some cleaning so I just packed my car at
[1:29:18] the back of the building there uh just
[1:29:21] to wait until they finished doing what
[1:29:23] they were doing but I just that that
[1:29:25] kind of a humble me you know it humble
[1:29:28] me because uh
[1:29:32] uh you know uh uh it will have to take a
[1:29:36] lot of confidence you know for uh for
[1:29:40] people that that come from uh different
[1:29:43] places different experiences life
[1:29:46] experiences and uh I mean they are from
[1:29:49] a church that is that is uh I mean uh uh
[1:29:54] thousand of thousands of people there uh
[1:29:56] you know more than 10,000 people in the
[1:29:59] church and then uh I mean they will come
[1:30:02] and and you know stay much time with us
[1:30:05] and humble themselves to our ministry
[1:30:08] and and try to be a part you know like I
[1:30:12] was saying one time of uh the brother
[1:30:14] that came from seon and preached for us
[1:30:17] uh uh he a he a it's a young man good
[1:30:20] friend of ours that we know for many
[1:30:23] years and and just to see how the Lord
[1:30:26] uh you know bless our brother he's uh uh
[1:30:30] uh a managing director de of one of the
[1:30:32] biggest insurance company in
[1:30:35] cilium and but you know like uh brother
[1:30:38] bam told us you know people of great
[1:30:43] statures know how to Humble thems it is
[1:30:47] we that you know that has not been able
[1:30:50] to reach that place we are the ones that
[1:30:53] like to show our
[1:30:56] shoulders you know I remember when I
[1:30:59] preached on the Redemption money when I
[1:31:02] spoke on the Redemption money I was
[1:31:04] trying to show also what makes a money
[1:31:09] valuable it
[1:31:11] is what is behind the money it's not
[1:31:13] just the paper if you remember I was I
[1:31:17] was saying how the US dollar has gone
[1:31:19] from the gold standard is now called the
[1:31:22] petrol dollar the because the US dollar
[1:31:25] is backed by oil around the world it's
[1:31:29] called the petrol dollar so uh uh uh I
[1:31:34] think that subject kind of for cut
[1:31:36] brother Emmanuel because that's his area
[1:31:39] he's a man of Fess so I one time I was
[1:31:42] visiting with him and and he brought the
[1:31:44] subject up and and then he educated me
[1:31:47] also because uh uh uh I didn't know
[1:31:54] in Africa you know because he he works
[1:31:56] in that area that's that's his domain he
[1:31:59] knew the countries in Africa that had
[1:32:02] support behind their money you know so
[1:32:05] we had a conversation that was that was
[1:32:07] a good teaching for me but I also want
[1:32:09] to thank he and his wife uh uh they just
[1:32:12] have couple of weeks here with us they

[1:36:31] think that I'm I'm worthy to be here I I
[1:36:35] I don't believe that I'm worthy to stand
[1:36:37] here I think it's just the grace of God
[1:36:40] and I'm a little nervous because there
[1:36:42] is a reason why I'm even more nervous
[1:36:44] than I ever been before uh because we
[1:36:47] don't get used to this place you know

[1:37:36] it was
[1:37:37] actually I don't know if I I just asked
[1:37:39] for God to help me because God led me to
[1:37:42] to speak something different that I did
[1:37:44] not really fully prepared but I know
[1:37:47] that there's a purpose behind it uh you
[1:37:50] know the gift is to to give yourself to
[1:37:53] just make yourself available so God can
[1:37:56] use you even myself I'll be surprised as

[1:38:17] four days ago I was fasting until this
[1:38:21] hour and the ninth hour I prayed in my
[1:38:24] house and
[1:38:26] behold uh and behold a man stood Before
[1:38:29] Me In Bright cloth clothing and said
[1:38:33] Cornelius th prayer is heard and th arms
[1:38:38] are add in remembrance in the sight of
[1:38:43] God shall we pray Heavenly
[1:38:46] Father we come before you Lord at this
[1:38:49] moment in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:38:52] Christ Lord Lord you have made this day
[1:38:55] possible and Lord there are many
[1:38:58] throughout this year had passed away
[1:39:02] have lost the loved ones oh Lord God by
[1:39:05] your grace Lord you know that I will be

[1:39:20] Lord what you have in store for your

[1:39:36] fully to you oh God may you Minister the
[1:39:39] message today oh God as we are depending
[1:39:42] fully on you in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:39:45] pray with Thanksgiving amen you may be
[1:39:48] seated thank
[1:39:50] you I would definitely need your help to
[1:39:53] to preach with me um your amen will do
[1:39:57] something because I know you know
[1:39:59] brother bham tell told us that you only
[1:40:02] receive what you
[1:40:03] expect so if you have come with the
[1:40:06] expectation to receive healing you will
[1:40:09] receive healing from the Lord and if you
[1:40:11] are needing the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:13] Ghost I do believe that the baptism of
[1:40:15] the Holy Ghost is available tonight you
[1:40:17] know um God has done quite a lot of
[1:40:20] things for us all and then I think on
[1:40:22] behalf of my family I just want to thank
[1:40:24] the pastor the church uh for helping us
[1:40:28] by your advice your prayers you know
[1:40:31] it's it's a it's a it's a privilege to
[1:40:32] be among Believers that are willing to
[1:40:34] stand with you and to pray with you so
[1:40:38] tonight I wish to speak on a message
[1:40:41] that I entitled a memorial
[1:40:44] prayer a memorial
[1:40:47] prayer so in the scripture we just read
[1:40:50] here if you go back a little bit if the
[1:40:52] sister can help help us to project act
[1:40:55] chapter
[1:40:56] 10 it says there was a man in cesaria
[1:41:00] called conelius a
[1:41:02] centurion the B uh of the band called
[1:41:06] The Italian band a devour man and one
[1:41:10] that fear God with all his house which
[1:41:14] gave God uh I mean which gave much arm
[1:41:17] to the people and prayed to God always
[1:41:22] he saw in a V evidently about the 9th
[1:41:25] hour of the day an angel
[1:41:27] coming in to him and saying unto him
[1:41:31] Cornelius when he looked on him he was
[1:41:34] afraid and said what is the Lord and he
[1:41:38] said unto him that
[1:41:40] prayer so now we have come to the end of
[1:41:43] the year and I'm sure that every single
[1:41:46] one of us have prayed is that correct
[1:41:48] you have different needs in your heart
[1:41:50] maybe you have been pray praying for so
[1:41:53] long long and you needing the help of
[1:41:55] the Lord but now it was exactly like
[1:41:58] this man called Cornelius for the matter
[1:42:01] of fact he was just a gentile you know
[1:42:03] he was a gentile so he was just a devout
[1:42:06] man a righteous man and he was doing
[1:42:08] everything right helping here and there
[1:42:10] but now there was an appointed time that
[1:42:12] God decided for his prayer to be
[1:42:14] answered amen so trust me it's the same
[1:42:18] thing with you maybe you've been praying
[1:42:19] for something and don't worry you we are
[1:42:22] also Gentile
[1:42:23] because brother bam talks about the
[1:42:25] three children of of of Noah came out
[1:42:28] the Samaritan the Jew and the Gentile
[1:42:31] and we are the Gentile so you have just
[1:42:33] to put your name instead of Cornelius
[1:42:36] maybe you've been praying throughout the
[1:42:38] entire year and you have not received
[1:42:40] any answer but by God's grace tonight we
[1:42:43] will see what God has in store for us
[1:42:45] amen can you say Amen to the word now
[1:42:48] the the Bible continues to say and it
[1:42:51] looked uh I think yes and he look and
[1:42:53] and when he looked on him he was afraid
[1:42:56] and said what is the Lord and he said
[1:42:58] unto him that prayer and the arm has
[1:43:02] come up can you just imagine you've been
[1:43:05] praying and at a certain appointed time
[1:43:08] of God God remembers you see God
[1:43:10] remembers your prayer maybe you can pray
[1:43:13] about something you forget but God
[1:43:16] remembers exactly what you have said
[1:43:19] this specific day this specific night
[1:43:22] when maybe when you were dealing with a
[1:43:24] situation God knew exactly what was in
[1:43:26] your heart so now it says th prayer and
[1:43:29] thy arms are come up for a
[1:43:34] memorial you see a little bit what I'm
[1:43:36] seeing here it says for a memorial
[1:43:38] before God the following verse there and
[1:43:41] now send men to jopa and call one Simon
[1:43:46] whose surname is Peter you know I love
[1:43:49] this because brother benam says
[1:43:50] something and and and since I'm not
[1:43:51] going to speak for long and I want you
[1:43:53] to catch this idea just for a minute in
[1:43:55] the message what think ye of Christ
[1:43:59] paragraph 22 if the sister can project
[1:44:02] uh project there for
[1:44:04] us oh my are you happy to be here amen
[1:44:08] you should not sleep on me right it's
[1:44:09] the word of God so we should say Amen to
[1:44:11] the word amen I'm not used to holding
[1:44:13] the microphone so it's a little weird on
[1:44:15] me now so but it's okay so now the the
[1:44:18] the prophet says something very profound
[1:44:20] here it says the weakness of the church
[1:44:24] today is one of the fundamental reason
[1:44:28] that we see no more going on in the
[1:44:31] church right are you with me now the
[1:44:35] prophet start mentioning those two
[1:44:37] things that we we're about to read here
[1:44:39] it says the first thing I think is
[1:44:41] because there is not enough traveling of
[1:44:44] the
[1:44:46] Soul are you with me it says to bring
[1:44:49] the person in contact with his me
[1:44:53] are we together now the traveling of a
[1:44:57] soul the soul have to reach a certain
[1:44:59] place that has to get in contact with
[1:45:02] his maker because remember you cannot
[1:45:05] contact God by the five
[1:45:07] senses these are literally Gat that God
[1:45:10] has given you you know those five senses
[1:45:12] are gate and there's also five senses of
[1:45:15] the spirit but you cannot contact God in
[1:45:18] those five senses you need to enter into
[1:45:21] your soul where you believe everywhere
[1:45:23] of God are you with me now the first
[1:45:25] thing I think is because there is not
[1:45:28] enough traveling of the soul to bring
[1:45:31] the person in contact with his maker and
[1:45:33] another thing is this is the person who
[1:45:38] doesn't is the person who doesn't find
[1:45:41] God does not realize who he is after he
[1:45:45] has found him has found God and if you
[1:45:49] only realize that you are sting now with
[1:45:53] Christ Jesus are you saying amen is he
[1:45:56] Amen to the word it says that many of
[1:45:59] the people are trying to post it off to
[1:46:02] some other great age and all healing
[1:46:06] over in the Millennium so forth but
[1:46:09] Saint this is something that is very
[1:46:11] important sometime we will bow down we
[1:46:14] will get into our closet and we will
[1:46:16] just pray without knowing why are we
[1:46:18] praying to because the Bible says we
[1:46:20] must be able to pray with understanding
[1:46:23] that's what the scripture says so when
[1:46:25] you pray you have to understand what you
[1:46:27] are doing so the prophet tells us in
[1:46:30] another message to kind of Def show us
[1:46:33] something very important which I believe
[1:46:35] it's the very definition of prayer it
[1:46:38] says uh in the message communion it says
[1:46:41] communion is to
[1:46:44] talk are you with me it says communion
[1:46:47] is to talk and it talks
[1:46:50] back something that you talk to you see
[1:46:54] most of the time when we go to prayer we
[1:46:56] will sit there we will pray and pray and
[1:46:58] pray and pray and sit there for hours
[1:47:01] and hours but never sit down and hear
[1:47:03] back from God do we do that are we
[1:47:08] together a communion means you talk to
[1:47:11] God and he has to answer back he has to
[1:47:13] talk back and the Very word communion
[1:47:16] means to talk to or to be associated
[1:47:20] with something that is talking back to
[1:47:23] you and God talks back to you he says
[1:47:27] communion it's still Bread and Wine we
[1:47:31] call a communion do you see a little bit
[1:47:33] the idea here so when we go to God with
[1:47:36] our petition we must talk to him because
[1:47:39] he says come unto me ye are heavy L and
[1:47:42] I will give you rest that's what he said
[1:47:44] is that right but now after that you
[1:47:47] have spoken you need to sit down and
[1:47:49] wait for him to answer back because if
[1:47:52] he does not answer back then you guys
[1:47:53] are not communicating you guys are not
[1:47:55] communing together are are we together
[1:47:58] so now we have to understand where we're
[1:48:02] coming from and in order for us to
[1:48:04] understand what is this mix up about
[1:48:07] communion why do we have to pray it will
[1:48:09] bring us back in the Garden of Eden it
[1:48:12] wasn't so like that you see what I'm
[1:48:14] saying because in the Garden of Eden
[1:48:16] when God made man it was for him to
[1:48:19] communicate with his maker so there was
[1:48:21] no interest whatsoever for Adam to
[1:48:23] commune with God so what will happen the
[1:48:26] prophet will tell us that God will come
[1:48:28] down in the evening he will come to his
[1:48:30] son Adam and say hey Adam how are you
[1:48:32] doing and Adam would tell him oh Father
[1:48:35] look at what happened this this animal
[1:48:39] here I call a lion that was the thought
[1:48:41] of God you see the thought of God he
[1:48:44] could see the nature of what he had
[1:48:45] created but when Adam looked he had the
[1:48:48] very mind of God to the point where Adam
[1:48:51] could name the ad animal are you are you
[1:48:54] with me Adam will name the animal and
[1:48:57] God will say Amen to the word because
[1:49:00] Adam could not say something different
[1:49:01] than what his maker said he had to say
[1:49:03] the very Mind Of God are you are you
[1:49:06] with me so now there was no clogging up
[1:49:09] between there was no channel that was
[1:49:11] clogged up so Adam God would think about
[1:49:14] it and Adam would Express the thought of
[1:49:18] God you see that Fellowship between God
[1:49:20] that was before before sin
[1:49:24] now oh my may God help us
[1:49:29] amen but we see what happened in the
[1:49:31] Garden of Eden the enemy came and
[1:49:33] destroyed that
[1:49:35] Fellowship you know and I think I read
[1:49:38] you know I was just listen to brother
[1:49:39] one on Sunday he mentioned something
[1:49:41] very profound the very first quote that
[1:49:43] you read he says every time that there
[1:49:45] is a Revival every time that God's move
[1:49:47] Satan also
[1:49:49] moves you you see what I'm saying so now
[1:49:52] this battle brother B says in the the
[1:49:54] greatest battle ever fought this is out
[1:49:55] of my note it says that the battles
[1:49:58] begin in heaven the battle was not on
[1:50:02] Earth there was a battle before even we
[1:50:05] come here we we being expressed in
[1:50:08] flesh and if you read in the book of uh
[1:50:10] Revelation chapter 12 the Bible tells us
[1:50:13] there was a battle in heaven between
[1:50:14] Lucifer and and Michael is that
[1:50:17] correct and now what was in heaven what
[1:50:20] was a angelical battle became a human
[1:50:23] battle and he has been raging ever since
[1:50:26] when in the mind of
[1:50:28] men is that
[1:50:31] correct but sin separated men from God
[1:50:34] and destroyed that Fellowship remember
[1:50:37] as soon
[1:50:38] as Adam and Eve partt of that that tree
[1:50:42] they ran away you see what I'm saying so
[1:50:45] as soon as they ate of that fruit they
[1:50:47] ran away and covered themselves with
[1:50:49] apron and brother bam calls a religion
[1:50:53] instead of a son running to the father
[1:50:54] and say father I have failed I've sin
[1:50:56] against you but we're running away the
[1:50:59] reason why Adam ran away it was because
[1:51:01] that there was a dis there was
[1:51:04] disfellowship there you see that
[1:51:06] relationship was no longer there and
[1:51:08] what caus it sin in the Garden of Eden
[1:51:11] and every time that we partook of the
[1:51:13] tree of of the knowledge of Good and
[1:51:15] Evil we get separated from God but the
[1:51:17] word of God is the tree of
[1:51:21] life oh Oh Glory to God and the prophet
[1:51:24] tell us that the very tree of life that
[1:51:26] was in the midst of the garden of of of
[1:51:27] of of of Eden was a person so if you
[1:51:30] read the Bible I mean just apprentices
[1:51:33] there were four kind of trees in the
[1:51:34] Garden of Eden the Bible says there was
[1:51:38] a tree good to to the to see I think for
[1:51:40] to the sight good for
[1:51:43] food if I'm not mistaken and then there
[1:51:46] were two other tree the tree of the
[1:51:47] knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree
[1:51:49] of Life there were four of them but two
[1:51:51] of them were persons
[1:51:53] the tree of life was a
[1:51:55] person and that was Christ so every time
[1:51:58] that you feed on Christ you will leave
[1:52:00] you continually live but every time that
[1:52:03] you partake of the tree of knowledge and
[1:52:04] evil you die and there was Fellowship
[1:52:07] issue with Fellowship
[1:52:09] there but God will come down to his son
[1:52:12] and his daughter and fellowship with
[1:52:13] them but now after the fall there were
[1:52:17] only one man one way to restore men back
[1:52:20] to that Fellowship and when Adam and Eve
[1:52:23] fell God killed an animal because
[1:52:27] remember without the shedding of blood
[1:52:28] there's no forgiveness of sin and God
[1:52:31] killed an animal and start the Plan of
[1:52:32] Redemption to bring his son and his
[1:52:34] daughter back to that Fellowship so the
[1:52:37] animal the innocent animal be became a
[1:52:39] bridge between a holy God and a sinful
[1:52:42] man and brother say in another message I
[1:52:45] think job he says as they were leaving
[1:52:47] the Garden of Eden God did not leave
[1:52:49] them alone like that he gave them a
[1:52:51] promise it says that the seed of the
[1:52:53] woman shall Bru the head of the
[1:52:56] serpent you see you if you sin against
[1:52:59] God you you cannot just go by yourself
[1:53:01] God will be there if if you are a son
[1:53:03] and daughter he will never leave you in
[1:53:05] that condition he will come to rescue
[1:53:08] you oh glory to
[1:53:11] God now even if the lamb was slain the
[1:53:15] animal actually it was not the perfect
[1:53:18] picture there God in his mind he already
[1:53:20] saw his only begot son being slain
[1:53:23] because the Bible says the lamb was slay
[1:53:25] before the foundation of the
[1:53:27] world but the Natural Animal was not the
[1:53:30] real
[1:53:32] image God had to become man to come and
[1:53:35] actually take that position to be the
[1:53:37] Lamb of that taking away the sin of the
[1:53:39] world are you with me oh my people are
[1:53:44] too quiet
[1:53:45] tonight amen I'll read this the
[1:53:48] following quotes there's something that
[1:53:50] mention there before we get into to a
[1:53:52] memorial prayer I'm just laying the
[1:53:54] foundation are you with
[1:53:57] me now the prophet says what is the Holy
[1:54:00] Ghost uh what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:54:03] for it says and then God in order to
[1:54:07] redeem the Lost Church The Lost World
[1:54:10] The Lost creation God who is infinite in
[1:54:14] spirit to redeem the lost human human
[1:54:17] race God himself became king F amen a
[1:54:22] son that he created in the womb of Mary
[1:54:25] and then he made an inside or a
[1:54:29] testimony outside of the Gate of
[1:54:31] Jerusalem he was lifted up between the
[1:54:34] Heaven and the Earth and die and redeem
[1:54:37] everything in bleeding he sanctify a
[1:54:40] church that he himself might live in and
[1:54:44] fellowship and commune
[1:54:46] with you see it says that's the Lost
[1:54:50] part of Fellowship from the G of Eden
[1:54:53] where God came down every night church
[1:54:55] time did you know this God came down in
[1:54:58] the cool of the day and setting of the
[1:55:00] Sun and there is something about when it
[1:55:04] starts to get night people think of the
[1:55:06] church and God Christians you see the
[1:55:09] sun setting and the prophet said and the
[1:55:11] Bible says in in the book of uh uh of
[1:55:14] Zechariah in the evening there shall be
[1:55:16] light so it is the evening light that
[1:55:19] brings Fellowship that brings back
[1:55:21] Fellowship amen amen because all of
[1:55:24] these things are in the Bible is not
[1:55:25] just for you know it's just not Rand God
[1:55:27] does not just put things randomly there
[1:55:29] is a purpose behind it are you with me
[1:55:34] now we have to get back to that
[1:55:36] Fellowship how many of us want to get
[1:55:38] back into that Fellowship oh my if it
[1:55:41] wasn't the grace of God I don't know
[1:55:43] what we would do because remember here
[1:55:46] to get back to fellowship it's not the
[1:55:48] things of the body it's not necessarily
[1:55:50] body it's the soul that has to be back
[1:55:52] to God have to be back to that
[1:55:55] Fellowship Oh Glory to
[1:55:58] God our soul needs are crying every day
[1:56:01] to be in contact with our make again and
[1:56:04] prayer is a vehicle that brings us into
[1:56:08] the presence of
[1:56:10] God so we must be a able to know because
[1:56:13] brother bam says that prayer is the most
[1:56:15] vital force given to a Christian so if
[1:56:18] it's a it's a force if it's a a weapon
[1:56:21] that belongs to you you might be able to
[1:56:22] know
[1:56:24] it how many of us have been praying and
[1:56:26] we have no
[1:56:27] answer is let's be honest how many of us
[1:56:31] have prayed but there's no answer
[1:56:34] yet oh wow just that I mean all of us I
[1:56:37] think right but the prophet says God
[1:56:40] always answer
[1:56:41] prayers that's a direct
[1:56:45] quote are we together brother one that's
[1:56:47] right brother bam said it God always
[1:56:51] answer PR prayer maybe it may not come
[1:56:53] the way you expect it to come but God
[1:56:56] always answer
[1:56:57] prayers are we together and prayer is
[1:57:01] the vehicle that brings you into that
[1:57:04] presence in the Book of James chapter 4
[1:57:07] 4:8 it says draw night to God and He
[1:57:10] will draw night to you cleanse your
[1:57:13] hands ye Sinners and purify your heart
[1:57:16] you double minded you double minded so
[1:57:20] when we coming to God we should not be
[1:57:21] double minded is he going to do
[1:57:25] it that's exactly what we
[1:57:27] do maybe this entire year we've been
[1:57:30] praying
[1:57:33] doubting when God does not answer we
[1:57:36] wonder why he doesn't
[1:57:37] answer because God want you to to to
[1:57:40] believe in his
[1:57:42] word it cannot be pleased by you having
[1:57:45] one foot on on doubting and one foot
[1:57:48] believing you have to fully believe in
[1:57:50] God's word for something to
[1:57:53] happen are we
[1:57:55] together we can you know the Bible says
[1:57:58] Hebrews 11: 6 and I and I think this
[1:58:02] this uh scripture is very profound if
[1:58:04] you can bear with me for a minute here
[1:58:07] the Bible says but without faith it is
[1:58:10] impossible to please
[1:58:12] God so you must be able to please
[1:58:15] him are we together it says but without
[1:58:19] faith it is impossible to please him for
[1:58:22] for he that cometh to God must
[1:58:25] believe that he is not just that he
[1:58:29] was are we together that he is in the
[1:58:32] present
[1:58:34] tense you see what I'm saying You must
[1:58:37] be able to believe that he is
[1:58:41] now oh glory to
[1:58:44] God
[1:58:46] Amen now he continues to say God to God
[1:58:50] must believe that he is
[1:58:52] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:58:56] diligently seek
[1:58:57] him so basically he saying that Jesus
[1:59:00] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:59:03] forever so when you praying don't pray
[1:59:06] in the past pray in the present
[1:59:08] believing a God in the
[1:59:12] present that's what the pastor has been
[1:59:14] preaching say God is Not hidden in the
[1:59:16] cloud somewhere where he live his
[1:59:18] Redemption
[1:59:20] redeem redeem
[1:59:22] uh I
[1:59:25] mean redeem children alone he will not
[1:59:29] leave them in that condition he gets
[1:59:31] into that situation he is in the
[1:59:35] business you cannot talk about
[1:59:37] Redemption without having the
[1:59:39] Redeemer you cannot talk about healing
[1:59:42] without having the Healer he is the
[1:59:44] person of the
[1:59:46] healing Oh Glory to God so you cannot
[1:59:51] talk about your the healing of your body
[1:59:53] without him being
[1:59:54] present because remember he is
[1:59:57] omniscient he is omnipotent and he's
[2:00:00] omnipresent so if he is omnipresent
[2:00:03] present means that he carries all his
[2:00:05] Redemptive blessing along with
[2:00:08] him you cannot say that oh God is among
[2:00:11] us but you're doubting that he can hear
[2:00:12] you so if he's among you you can't go
[2:00:14] touch
[2:00:17] him because he present you can just go
[2:00:20] access anything that you want to because
[2:00:22] he's
[2:00:24] present you can't just say oh wow that's
[2:00:26] what God did then no he's
[2:00:29] here oh glory to
[2:00:32] God are we together I I I like the
[2:00:36] Amplified version because he helps me to
[2:00:38] see a little clearer here it says but
[2:00:40] without faith it isn't possible to walk
[2:00:43] with
[2:00:45] God and please
[2:00:47] him it says for whoever cometh need to
[2:00:52] God must necessarily believe that God
[2:00:58] exists and that he rewards those who
[2:01:02] earnestly diligently seek
[2:01:06] Him Oh Glory to God we we must be we
[2:01:10] must be able to know who we serving
[2:01:12] here it's not just a church going every
[2:01:15] year we're going through the same
[2:01:16] situation we pray about this for 10
[2:01:18] years and no answer we must be able to
[2:01:21] know what we we are
[2:01:22] asking we have to come the provided way
[2:01:26] to receive the answer of our
[2:01:28] prayer that's why let me tell you
[2:01:30] something Saint tonight you want to pray
[2:01:32] a memorial
[2:01:35] prayer you see what I'm saying not just
[2:01:37] any type of prayer I'm talking about a
[2:01:39] memorial
[2:01:42] prayer you see many people pray pray
[2:01:45] pray pray pray and nothing happened but
[2:01:47] we want Memorial
[2:01:49] prayers Oh Glory to God
[2:01:52] maybe somebody has a need tonight I
[2:01:54] don't know why but God has somebody has
[2:01:56] a need
[2:01:57] tonight now in another message here oh
[2:02:01] my I didn't check my time when I
[2:02:03] started my goodness it says now what uh
[2:02:07] no uh the message down knoweth all
[2:02:09] things now see what prayer does prayer
[2:02:12] is not exactly bringing God down to
[2:02:15] men it's bringing men up to
[2:02:19] God you see now we change everything is
[2:02:22] changing that's why without a prophet
[2:02:24] Saint I don't know we be
[2:02:26] confused but thank God for Malachi
[2:02:29] 4 that's why when even when the winds
[2:02:31] are blowing from different direction
[2:02:33] there are men and women that will stand
[2:02:35] we know where we are
[2:02:37] standing we have not come here to
[2:02:39] worship a
[2:02:40] man we are serving God in a man working
[2:02:44] in a
[2:02:46] man oh glory to God that positions us
[2:02:54] now prayer is not exactly bringing God
[2:02:56] down to men it's bringing men up to God
[2:03:00] as you pray you lose sight of the
[2:03:03] Earthly things you swept out into
[2:03:06] somewhere else Way Beyond and go on and
[2:03:10] on till you be come into His presence so
[2:03:15] you must find yourself in a certain
[2:03:17] atmosphere to access God and it's not
[2:03:21] your body that access God but it's your
[2:03:23] soul that access
[2:03:25] God because remember in the Garden of
[2:03:27] Eden that was The Fellowship between
[2:03:30] Adam and is M and that Fellowship was
[2:03:33] happening from
[2:03:35] here that's why God has sent a prophet
[2:03:37] to restore that to know how we should
[2:03:41] pray so that things can happen in our
[2:03:43] life not any type of prayer prayer that
[2:03:45] will change
[2:03:47] situations that's what I'm longing for
[2:03:49] this year
[2:03:50] Saint we we have different needs in our
[2:03:52] heart we need
[2:03:54] answers are we together we cannot just
[2:03:57] sit here and say oh wow we need a new
[2:03:58] church people are sitting here with
[2:04:00] faith God is able to give us a new
[2:04:04] building Oh Glory to God we're not
[2:04:07] serving a god of the past I don't serve
[2:04:09] the god of the past the God is the god
[2:04:11] of present
[2:04:14] Hallelujah if he has risen from the dead
[2:04:17] he must be here
[2:04:19] tonight Hallelujah and I believe he's
[2:04:23] here oh glory to God in another quote
[2:04:26] the supernatural brother one just let me
[2:04:28] know how many time I have left just to
[2:04:31] help me Supernatural says just move on
[2:04:34] God never put that in there for nothing
[2:04:37] God never come to just any other way
[2:04:41] prayer perhaps prayer is a sincere thing
[2:04:44] prayer is talking to God prayer is not
[2:04:47] get down and shut your eyes and think
[2:04:49] about washing and and working what you
[2:04:51] are doing
[2:04:52] it says God help me and John and he'll
[2:04:54] miss John and so forth that's not prayer
[2:04:58] it says that's repeating with some words
[2:05:01] but prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[2:05:04] where you realize that you are in the
[2:05:06] presence of God and you are moving to
[2:05:08] them in the deepness of
[2:05:11] sincerity first to
[2:05:13] worship he wants
[2:05:16] worship now I'm not here to teach the
[2:05:18] Lord's Prayer but just look at the
[2:05:20] pattern of the word the Lord prayer you
[2:05:22] you will figure it out how the he taught
[2:05:25] his disciple how to
[2:05:28] pray you see you you you know the prayer
[2:05:31] just go through it in your mind you
[2:05:33] understand you cannot ask something from
[2:05:35] God without worshiping him
[2:05:39] first oh is that is that right you must
[2:05:41] be able to worship Him the purpose of
[2:05:44] your existence is to worship
[2:05:46] God what makes him God is your
[2:05:50] worship so if you don't worship him he's
[2:05:52] not
[2:05:53] God oh it's
[2:05:57] true these things is to lay some found
[2:06:00] oh my to help
[2:06:02] us they were they were women because
[2:06:05] even when you praying you must have a
[2:06:10] burden you see for let me just say
[2:06:13] really quick here for you know for the
[2:06:14] time that we have you know when you pray
[2:06:18] you must have a burden in your heart and
[2:06:21] that burden is not
[2:06:24] manufactured what creates the burden in
[2:06:26] your heart is the timing of the promise
[2:06:30] when the promise of God is Drawing Near
[2:06:33] then you see a burden going to your
[2:06:35] heart yes sir you see what I'm saying
[2:06:38] that's God generating that burden
[2:06:40] because God has an appointed time for
[2:06:42] his promise to come to pass you see now
[2:06:45] it cannot just come to pass by
[2:06:48] itself there must be people with a
[2:06:50] burden so if it drops the burden the
[2:06:53] burden brings you to prayer and then
[2:06:55] when you go to prayer you receive what
[2:06:56] you
[2:06:58] need that's the way to receive from God
[2:07:04] hallelujah so we're not just praying any
[2:07:06] type of
[2:07:07] way you must pray with
[2:07:10] Revelation now there was this woman Anna
[2:07:13] she had a burden is that right God is
[2:07:16] the one who made a promise that there's
[2:07:18] going to be no buring in Israel is that
[2:07:20] correct that was God's
[2:07:23] word but the Bible tells us that Sarah
[2:07:27] was
[2:07:29] Barren you'll probably say wow how in
[2:07:31] the world if God exist it said here that
[2:07:34] there's going to be no bar barren woman
[2:07:37] in Israel but why am I burden why am I
[2:07:41] bearing but watch this very
[2:07:45] carefully now you know the story very
[2:07:47] carefully I don't have time to go
[2:07:49] through it now
[2:07:52] there were this man called a right he
[2:07:55] had two wives one Anna and the other
[2:07:58] panina is that
[2:07:59] correct but now this man went out in you
[2:08:03] can find in 1 Samuel chapter 1:3 it says
[2:08:05] this man went up out of the city nearly
[2:08:08] to worship and the sacrifice unto the
[2:08:10] Lord of host in shalow and two sons of
[2:08:12] Eli and fin whatever he continues now if
[2:08:16] you read it fully you would understand
[2:08:18] that Anna maybe she might have waited
[2:08:20] for a long time is is that correct she
[2:08:22] waited for a long time because the other
[2:08:25] woman had kids but she didn't but God
[2:08:28] needed a prophet in
[2:08:30] Israel I just showed you the pardon is
[2:08:32] that correct God needed a prophet in
[2:08:36] Israel but as the promise was going near
[2:08:40] God drop a burden in the heart of a
[2:08:42] woman that was Buren for that promise to
[2:08:45] come to pass so now watch
[2:08:50] carefully now in verse 10 in verse 9 the
[2:08:53] Bible says something 1 Samuel chapter
[2:08:55] 1:9 it says so Anna rose up after they
[2:08:59] had eaten in shallow and after they had
[2:09:02] drunken now Eli the priest sat upon a
[2:09:06] seat by the post of the Temple of the
[2:09:08] Lord now watch what is happening here
[2:09:11] verse 10 she was in bitterness of
[2:09:18] Soul that's what the Bible says
[2:09:22] it was something that was happening
[2:09:25] here you know maybe she had pray for her
[2:09:27] children but this time was different
[2:09:31] because the promise of God was drawing
[2:09:32] near God needed a
[2:09:35] prophet so when she ask her for a
[2:09:38] petition it was not a selfish
[2:09:41] petition she said God if you give me a
[2:09:44] man child I will give it back to
[2:09:47] you so when you you ask something from
[2:09:50] God you need to point back to God so
[2:09:53] don't just ask out saying God I want a
[2:09:56] million
[2:09:57] dollar tell God say God I need a million
[2:10:00] dollar when you give me a million dollar
[2:10:02] I will take that money I'll give it back
[2:10:04] to the church so we can have a new
[2:10:07] building saying you see what God will
[2:10:12] do the pastor did not tell me to say
[2:10:14] that that's for
[2:10:17] me verse 11 verse 11 and she vow vow say
[2:10:21] Lord Oh Lord of hosts if thou will
[2:10:24] indeed look on the Affliction of th head
[2:10:27] man and remember me and not forget that
[2:10:30] handmade but will give unto the handmade
[2:10:33] a man child then I will give him unto
[2:10:37] the Lord all the days of his
[2:10:41] life and he continued it says and there
[2:10:43] was no rise to come upon his what his
[2:10:46] hand his head because he was under a
[2:10:48] naite
[2:10:49] vow a V they were children that were put
[2:10:53] aside they were kept into a certain
[2:10:55] place and they will not cut their
[2:10:58] hair they were under that
[2:11:01] vow Oh Glory to God watch what brother
[2:11:06] I'm saying about Moses parent it's the
[2:11:08] same thing I'm I'm showing just a
[2:11:11] pattern now it comes
[2:11:14] to Moses parents sorry Moses parents
[2:11:18] they were in Egypt maybe they were
[2:11:20] working for so
[2:11:22] long it got to a place where it was
[2:11:25] enough
[2:11:26] enough enough is
[2:11:28] enough what happened God needed also a
[2:11:31] prophet in
[2:11:32] Egypt is the same p and
[2:11:37] Saint God needed a prophet where in
[2:11:40] Egypt but it you know God comes he puts
[2:11:44] a burden in This Man Called Abraham and
[2:11:48] Y is it yed I think yes is that
[2:11:52] and there were sitting there brother bam
[2:11:54] talks about uh ABR he will work all day
[2:11:57] and he will come back tired he will come
[2:12:00] in his attic and go pray Lord enough of
[2:12:02] this we who Dro that
[2:12:06] burden God
[2:12:08] himself he drops the burden and then the
[2:12:12] family that will catch that
[2:12:15] burden the family that will catch that
[2:12:18] burden the promise will come out of that
[2:12:21] same
[2:12:24] house let me repeat it that again the
[2:12:27] family that will catch the birden to
[2:12:31] pray because that's the
[2:12:34] vehicle to get into the presence of the
[2:12:37] Lord so if you drop into that vehicle
[2:12:41] you you accept the burden it might be a
[2:12:44] little hard it might be a little
[2:12:45] challenging for your family but there is
[2:12:47] a blessing that is waiting
[2:12:52] you see there is a
[2:12:54] blessing because the reason why you
[2:12:57] suffering because you understand by
[2:13:00] Revelation why am I carrying this
[2:13:03] burden because without a burden you
[2:13:05] cannot serve
[2:13:07] God you need a burden in your heart to
[2:13:10] serve God the right
[2:13:12] way and brother bham says if you can

[2:14:46] heart Oh Glory to God look what the
[2:14:50] prophet says it says I gave a drama on
[2:14:53] it for for the children not long ago
[2:14:56] saying while emram was in the room
[2:14:58] praying he saw an angel pull his
[2:15:02] sword and point it toward the North and

[2:16:09] drawing near God generated anger you
[2:16:12] know for change H hanger for change will
[2:16:16] lead to
[2:16:18] prayer first 1 John 5 I'm closing up
[2:16:21] very soon here he says and this is the
[2:16:23] confidence that we have in him that if
[2:16:26] we ask anything according to his will he
[2:16:29] will hear us is that correct if we know
[2:16:32] that he hear us whatsoever we ask we
[2:16:35] know that we will have the petition that
[2:16:37] we desire of
[2:16:38] him God always answer prayer now I'll
[2:16:42] give one example here and I'm going to
[2:16:46] close there is this man called some uh
[2:16:51] Solomon thank
[2:16:56] you you know Solomon was
[2:16:59] praying Solomon was praying one day as
[2:17:02] he was dedicating the temple and he was
[2:17:05] sitting there praying and praying and
[2:17:07] praying and he spoke to God in 2
[2:17:11] Chronicle chapter 620 and
[2:17:13] 21 and in in chapter 7 God answer back
[2:17:17] to him he says if my people which are
[2:17:20] called by my name
[2:17:21] shall humble themsel and pray and seek
[2:17:23] my face turn from the wicked way and
[2:17:26] then I will hear from heaven and forgive
[2:17:27] the sin and I will heal heal the land
[2:17:30] remember the prayer of Solomon was if
[2:17:33] the people turn to this Temple is that
[2:17:35] correct so they had to turn to a
[2:17:38] physical Temple for them to receive
[2:17:40] their petition is that correct but later
[2:17:43] on in the Book of Jonah there was this
[2:17:46] man that was buried was swallowed by a
[2:17:49] fish
[2:17:50] the Bible tell us
[2:17:53] that Jonah it says my prayer come unto
[2:17:57] you in thy Holy Temple so Jonah years
[2:18:02] later was inside of the belly of this
[2:18:06] literally covered
[2:18:09] buried he was praying toward the temple
[2:18:11] saying how in the world can you turn to
[2:18:13] the temple inside of that it's
[2:18:16] dark how did he know even where West was
[2:18:19] soft but he was not necessarily just to
[2:18:22] turn it south to west but his
[2:18:26] heart his heart was in contact with that
[2:18:29] Temple it was directly zeroed in you
[2:18:33] know what happened God answer his
[2:18:35] prayer there was this woman called at
[2:18:38] right I'm closing with
[2:18:40] this brother bam says something I'm
[2:18:42] going to close here he talking about
[2:18:44] atti right she was burdened with the
[2:18:47] salvation of of uh her sons do do you
[2:18:50] know the story of
[2:18:51] right now there's something that the
[2:18:53] prophet say here that was very profound
[2:18:54] to me it says at the right she I guess
[2:18:57] here this morning sitting right here she
[2:19:00] was the first one when we've seen those
[2:19:03] squirrels when the prophet spoke those
[2:19:05] squirrel into existence it says and you
[2:19:07] she know the commission about that and
[2:19:09] when them seven straight time God
[2:19:11] created something right and I said
[2:19:15] that's the same God that could create a
[2:19:17] realm for Abraham to convince him of his
[2:19:20] Commission
[2:19:21] is the same God that can create create a
[2:19:23] squirrel because that's what I had need
[2:19:27] of L whole at right there sitting in the
[2:19:32] back of the building with her heart off
[2:19:35] what the things of the world she was
[2:19:40] believing her heart was right she was
[2:19:43] believing she said brother Bram that's
[2:19:45] nothing but the truth she did not say it
[2:19:49] from here God spoke it out of a
[2:19:57] heart do you understand what the burden
[2:19:59] is the one who drops the burden is the
[2:20:01] one that answer prayers is the one that
[2:20:03] speaks through
[2:20:05] you so when you asking you not just
[2:20:08] asking but B says when you pray in Jesus
[2:20:11] name it's like Jesus himself
[2:20:15] praying where are you looking for Jesus
[2:20:18] he's not in the cloud Jesus is here
[2:20:21] that's why it says thy kingdom come thy
[2:20:23] will be done on Earth as it is in heaven
[2:20:26] give us this day our daily bread Oh

[2:21:31] therefore I said unto you what things

[2:21:48] year with things in your heart you must
[2:21:51] be able to forgive for your prayer to be
[2:21:54] to be answered you need to

[2:47:18] a little bit on the bride influence Amen
[2:47:21] on the bride
[2:47:23] influence and uh uh as as uh as we are
[2:47:28] familiar with uh with the with the
[2:47:30] entire subject the Lord bless you you
[2:47:32] may have your seat as we are familiar
[2:47:34] with the subject of influence and uh we
[2:47:37] just want to bring a little little uh uh
[2:47:41] whether whether you believe it or not
[2:47:44] accept it or not one way or another this
[2:47:48] year we were
[2:47:49] influenced by somebody or we did
[2:47:53] influence somebody praise the Lord it is
[2:47:56] something that you cannot do
[2:48:00] without you are either influencing
[2:48:02] somebody or somebody is influencing you
[2:48:06] praise the Lord if not directly it's
[2:48:10] indirectly maybe they are influencing
[2:48:12] You by their music or they are
[2:48:14] influencing You by all their post on
[2:48:17] social media you know because I mean
[2:48:20] it's it's the order of the day social
[2:48:23] media is the order of the day but
[2:48:25] tonight we want to talk about uh uh uh
[2:48:29] uh the bride influence we want to talk
[2:48:31] about the influence that uh that we
[2:48:34] should be under by God's grace amen the
[2:48:38] influence that we should be under as a
[2:48:41] people of God the influence that we
[2:48:43] should be honor as the Church of Jesus
[2:48:46] Christ as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[2:48:48] must be under his influence amen so uh
[2:48:53] as as as we are very familiar with the
[2:48:55] story this King uh yuah and uh uh and
[2:48:59] aziah they were they were they were
[2:49:01] pretty good friends they they grew up
[2:49:03] together and uh uh yuah became a king as
[2:49:06] a very young man and uh H asaiah was
[2:49:11] very very impressed you know uh by the
[2:49:13] way he carried himself by the way he
[2:49:15] order himself so uh uh uh
[2:49:20] uh in some way the king had an influence
[2:49:25] on the
[2:49:26] prophet which of course it was
[2:49:28] completely contrary because in in uh in
[2:49:32] Israel the prophet has the higher
[2:49:36] office is the prophet the priest then
[2:49:40] the
[2:49:41] king in Israel they respect their
[2:49:45] Prophet more than they respect their
[2:49:47] president
[2:49:49] praise the Lord that is the reason why
[2:49:51] the thing that we have around the
[2:49:53] Gentile churches you know somebody dream
[2:49:56] they call them themselves Prophet is not
[2:49:58] very common in Israel it's a de
[2:50:02] sentence to call yourself a
[2:50:05] prophet if you are found not to
[2:50:08] be they could likely Stone you to
[2:50:11] death praise the Lord so a prophet was
[2:50:16] the the higher office in the land of
[2:50:18] Israel
[2:50:19] but y said that it it turned out to be
[2:50:23] uh that uh the uh the the King yuah was
[2:50:27] having influence on on on the man that
[2:50:30] was supposed to have influence on
[2:50:33] him praise the Lord so it was a little
[2:50:37] bit turned around and uh and we saw that
[2:50:40] that affected yuz it affected him
[2:50:43] because he felt like he was a friend to
[2:50:47] Isaiah he felt like you know this man
[2:50:50] respected him listening to him we we saw
[2:50:53] what happened he went into the temple
[2:50:55] and took the sensor of God and he
[2:50:57] stepped out of his
[2:51:00] office because the prophet was listening
[2:51:03] to him he wanted the priest also to
[2:51:05] listen to him so when the priest advised
[2:51:09] him no you you are this is not your
[2:51:10] office this is not what you're supposed
[2:51:12] to do and and uh right there the the the
[2:51:15] Bible says uh he went and took the the
[2:51:18] holy sensor of God and you know God
[2:51:20] struck him with Leprosy and that was the
[2:51:22] end of his
[2:51:24] life but like the scripture says when y
[2:51:29] die something happened to
[2:51:34] aai praise the
[2:51:36] Lord the reason why he said woe is me he
[2:51:42] realized what he has
[2:51:45] done praise the Lord amen
[2:51:49] and for us to be able to break away from
[2:51:52] from wrong influence you have to realize
[2:51:56] how much it has affected
[2:52:00] you praise the
[2:52:03] Lord if you cannot realize how much it
[2:52:06] has affected you there is no way you can
[2:52:08] detach
[2:52:10] yourself praise the Lord you know the
[2:52:13] the reason why people do things that
[2:52:16] they know is wrong is because it bring
[2:52:20] them some sense of
[2:52:23] satisfaction the man that takes drugs he
[2:52:26] know that is wrong he know it destroy
[2:52:28] him but that little sensation it brings
[2:52:32] him that he feels in his
[2:52:35] body just for that little few minute of
[2:52:39] satisfaction that's why he does it but
[2:52:42] he know consciously that it's wrong he
[2:52:45] know this thing is destroying my health
[2:52:50] praise the
[2:52:51] Lord so when when Isaiah said who is me
[2:52:56] he says I'm done who is me
[2:53:00] God he came to the realization that uh I
[2:53:04] mean here he has misus the office of God
[2:53:07] he came to the realization there I
[2:53:10] should have I should have been
[2:53:12] influencing my friend I I I should have
[2:53:15] been uh putting in his place
[2:53:18] praise the Lord you know exactly what
[2:53:21] happened when when when Nathan came to
[2:53:24] David when Nathan walk in the house of
[2:53:28] David David knew that something was
[2:53:30] happening he don't know what was what
[2:53:32] was it but he knew that something was
[2:53:34] happening
[2:53:37] amen and David wanted to just bring him
[2:53:40] into a place of conversation and David T
[2:53:42] a parable before him you know there's a
[2:53:44] man here you
[2:53:46] know where you know giving the parable
[2:53:48] Parable and he took this man on a sheep
[2:53:50] and this that you know David never saw
[2:53:53] it
[2:53:54] coming he never saw it coming the the
[2:53:57] prophet has spoken to him he steep out
[2:53:59] of his seat he said the man must die
[2:54:02] nathon said you are the
[2:54:05] man praise the
[2:54:07] Lord
[2:54:09] amen and when Nathan said that David
[2:54:11] fell straight to his
[2:54:13] face because he know that was the higher
[2:54:17] that was the Supreme
[2:54:21] Court praise the Lord do you know have
[2:54:23] you ever searched in the Bible and
[2:54:25] really stud that Israel in their travel
[2:54:28] they did not have
[2:54:32] praising they didn't have
[2:54:37] praising why because there were some
[2:54:39] things that when you do they cut you off
[2:54:42] the
[2:54:45] land they only had a City of Refuge if
[2:54:48] you can get there but they they not have
[2:54:51] no prais
[2:54:54] him are we
[2:54:56] together now so you we we see here that
[2:55:01] uh uh uh uh Isaiah coming to himself
[2:55:06] realizing what has
[2:55:08] happened he ran straight to the house of
[2:55:12] God and
[2:55:14] because he placed himself on the the
[2:55:17] wrong influence God was not dealing with
[2:55:21] him in the level that God should deal
[2:55:24] with
[2:55:25] him there is no prophet in the Bible
[2:55:28] that is like Isaiah Isaiah was so
[2:55:32] inspired this is the man that gave us
[2:55:34] the
[2:55:36] record of Lucifer falling from
[2:55:40] Heaven Isaiah was the one that gave us
[2:55:43] the record of
[2:55:45] that Isaiah chapter 14 this is the man
[2:55:49] that that that's that wrote more thing
[2:55:52] on the Millennium than any any other
[2:55:54] writer in the
[2:55:56] Bible if you go to the New Testament
[2:55:59] most of everything most of everything
[2:56:02] that Jesus said came from Isaiah
[2:56:05] writing most of everything that Paul
[2:56:08] said came from asaiah
[2:56:10] writing to see the level of Grace that
[2:56:14] was given to this man and he took that
[2:56:17] and subjected
[2:56:21] it if we only knew the potential that
[2:56:25] God has placed in our life that we have
[2:56:28] taken and put under the wrong
[2:56:36] influence and no matter how smart you
[2:56:38] are no matter how educated you are you
[2:56:40] can never come to your full
[2:56:43] potential Until you realize
[2:56:48] the wrong influence you are
[2:56:53] honor praise the Lord
[2:56:57] amen because just like just like uh uh
[2:57:00] uh uh brother a said you these things
[2:57:03] are designed by God you have to realize
[2:57:06] he made
[2:57:08] you every fiber of your body he put them
[2:57:11] together your ability he gave it to you
[2:57:14] your ability don't come from school he
[2:57:17] gave you AB your ability he designed
[2:57:22] you your potential he give it to
[2:57:27] you for you to know really who you are
[2:57:31] you must meet your
[2:57:36] maker praise the
[2:57:41] lord we are living under our privilege
[2:57:44] what what what is that when we say it we
[2:57:46] are living under our privilege
[2:57:49] what is keeping us there
[2:57:53] influence influence that's what keep us
[2:57:56] honor our
[2:57:58] privilege what actually you are saying
[2:58:00] is that I'm not living to my full
[2:58:11] potential are we
[2:58:14] together glory be to God
[2:58:19] and that was what Isaiah
[2:58:23] identified that was what he
[2:58:25] realized like I've said to you before
[2:58:27] read the book of
[2:58:29] Isaiah from chapter 1 to chapter
[2:58:34] 5 Isaiah is just only prophesying
[2:58:38] concerning
[2:58:40] Jerusalem whoo onto them that call good
[2:58:43] evil woe unto them that call evil good
[2:58:47] he even prophesied in Isaiah chapter 5
[2:58:50] he prophesied about uh uh uh this mod
[2:58:53] Society uh civilization he said who unto
[2:58:56] them that build house upon house it's
[2:58:58] your Sky
[2:59:00] strippers and rolls upon rolls right
[2:59:03] there in Isaiah chapter
[2:59:05] 5 but after Isaiah chapter
[2:59:08] 6 chapter 7 he went into the future he
[2:59:13] went into
[2:59:15] Redemption a virgin shall conceive
[2:59:19] his ministry
[2:59:22] changed he left Israel in all the all
[2:59:26] their things God started revealing
[2:59:28] things to
[2:59:31] him beyond the national
[2:59:36] Affairs why because he has come under
[2:59:40] his the right
[2:59:46] influence he started breaking into
[2:59:49] prophecy this is the man that saw h h h
[2:59:52] uh uh uh the the the Gentile King uh uh
[2:59:56] uh uh what's his name Cyrus before even
[2:59:59] Cyrus was born he prophesied about Cyrus
[3:00:03] he called his name sarus that was the
[3:00:06] man where where the h h h Daniel took
[3:00:09] took the book of Isaiah went and show it
[3:00:11] to sarus says see in our Lord God spoke
[3:00:14] about you
[3:00:21] but he could have never come to that
[3:00:23] place as long as he was under the wrong
[3:00:30] influence the wrong
[3:00:32] influence deny us of our full
[3:00:38] potential are we together who shall go
[3:00:41] for
[3:00:42] us 2025 who shall go for
[3:00:46] us that was what the Lord said to Isaiah
[3:00:49] who shall go for
[3:00:55] us that's the question before us
[3:00:58] tonight who shall Go For
[3:01:01] Us Praise the
[3:01:03] Lord just see watch a little bit
[3:01:07] here there were there were there were
[3:01:09] six
[3:01:11] angels that came into into the the into
[3:01:17] to the
[3:01:18] temple and like we have demonstrated for
[3:01:21] you before they had their WIS all lock
[3:01:25] when the Bible say his train filled the
[3:01:27] temple it was it was the speed that
[3:01:29] those angels were moving they were
[3:01:32] moving in such a
[3:01:34] speed it was it was almost like a train
[3:01:36] because they were lock in their wings as
[3:01:39] they were
[3:01:40] moving now uh that's what brother B says
[3:01:43] there in Revelation Chapter 2 Series now
[3:01:46] so
[3:01:48] but what what was what what uh what is
[3:01:50] beautiful about this is
[3:01:52] that six is the number of
[3:01:58] men so you see God was communicating to
[3:02:01] to
[3:02:03] Isaiah but that when he broke into the
[3:02:07] vision and he saw that and saw the
[3:02:10] Angels
[3:02:11] moving says
[3:02:13] wow two of their wings they fly they
[3:02:16] cover their face they they cover their
[3:02:18] feet we know what all of that means and
[3:02:21] uh uh uh it kind of for grab his
[3:02:25] attention so actually when you want to
[3:02:28] look at it in the truth sense you will
[3:02:31] realize that God now plac H H Isaiah
[3:02:35] under Angelic
[3:02:39] influence and those Angelic influence
[3:02:42] was now breaking Vision to
[3:02:45] aai it was now exposing him to the
[3:02:48] Future revealing things to
[3:02:51] him far
[3:02:54] beyond putting words in his
[3:03:00] mouth why because he have come honor
[3:03:03] Angelic
[3:03:06] influence glory be to
[3:03:09] God you realize that all through the the
[3:03:13] the church
[3:03:16] ages God rais up men uh uh Paul being
[3:03:20] the first messenger of of the Ephesus
[3:03:22] Church age and God raised up all of
[3:03:24] these
[3:03:27] men but you see it All Through the Ages
[3:03:30] they were all just like uh H H uh uh
[3:03:33] Isiah in some
[3:03:35] sense that's what the church was every
[3:03:38] time God raised a
[3:03:39] messenger when the messenger leave the
[3:03:42] scene that goes back under men's uh uh
[3:03:45] influence you know they got to make a
[3:03:48] councel and man got to decide how the
[3:03:49] church will be run and and they make uh
[3:03:51] uh uh you know this society and that
[3:03:53] Society before you realize the glory of
[3:03:56] God the people denominated the church
[3:03:57] start getting
[3:04:00] worse are we
[3:04:03] together but you
[3:04:05] see as I bring my little talk to close
[3:04:13] tonight Paul says
[3:04:16] something in uh in
[3:04:19] Hebrew after he spoke about the fith
[3:04:23] chapter Hebrew chapter
[3:04:26] 11 Hebrews chapter 12 he says God has
[3:04:31] brought us to a place where he has given
[3:04:33] us cloud of
[3:04:36] witnesses he said all of these men that
[3:04:38] have expressed
[3:04:40] Faith they have build a cloud of
[3:04:44] witnesses praise the Lord meaning that
[3:04:48] whatever God did in their lives and in
[3:04:50] their Ministry God can also do
[3:04:53] it are we
[3:04:56] together and we will see that uh uh uh
[3:05:00] uh in this in this in this in this age
[3:05:02] that we are living the you know on under
[3:05:05] the message of the hour that we have
[3:05:06] come you know when uh when when uh when
[3:05:09] when the message will be open not the
[3:05:12] Evangelistic or side of of uh of of the
[3:05:15] ministry of brother Brandon but when the
[3:05:17] seals will be open what did God do now
[3:05:20] this time is now six
[3:05:22] Angels praise the Lord because men has
[3:05:26] always been able to get from honor that
[3:05:29] and
[3:05:31] denominate this time it was seven
[3:05:36] angels that brought the open book that
[3:05:40] revealed the word
[3:05:42] why because just like how those angels
[3:05:46] were to eat influence Isaiah back to his
[3:05:50] prophetic position that's the same way
[3:05:53] the seven angels under the opening of
[3:05:56] the word is to in influence the bride
[3:05:59] back to the
[3:06:03] word praise the Lord so you see our our
[3:06:07] our influence the bride influence is not
[3:06:10] from a
[3:06:13] man
[3:06:16] no if you stay under man's influence you
[3:06:19] will get
[3:06:20] leprosy and you will die just like us
[3:06:24] here praise the
[3:06:26] Lord but God has placed us on the
[3:06:30] Angelic
[3:06:33] influence and because of those Angelic
[3:06:36] influence we know that there is nothing
[3:06:40] impossible praise the Lord because what
[3:06:43] he says his angels are Income about us
[3:06:50] Hallelujah as the as the mountain
[3:06:52] surround Jerusalem David say so the Lord
[3:06:56] surround His People how do the Lord
[3:06:59] surround His People by encamping them
[3:07:01] with
[3:07:04] angels that's the reason why no matter
[3:07:07] how worse the word goes God will still
[3:07:10] have a bride that will believe in
[3:07:13] decency God will still have a people
[3:07:16] that will hold the value that will hold
[3:07:19] family value that will hold the value of
[3:07:23] marriage God will still have a church it
[3:07:27] can be a two or three they will still
[3:07:30] believe in miracles they will still
[3:07:32] believe in the pess of the word why
[3:07:36] because they are under Angelic
[3:07:41] influence praise the
[3:07:43] Lord that's the reason why the Encon is
[3:07:46] getting tough
[3:07:48] praise the Lord I mean social media is
[3:07:51] just corrupting people Minds it get us
[3:07:54] so
[3:07:56] busy it get you so busy that you can't
[3:08:00] concentrate try to do one thing then one

[3:08:28] you need it to work you need it to
[3:08:30] communicate you need it to contact
[3:08:32] people that's why we are dealing with so
[3:08:34] we are in an atmosphere of
[3:08:40] distraction praise the Lord
[3:08:47] God knew the age that we will be he knew
[3:08:52] this age he knew that this age is the
[3:08:55] most evil
[3:08:58] age praise the Lord the Earth has not
[3:09:02] drunk blood in end and age like in this
[3:09:11] age there's not a day that goes by where
[3:09:14] there is not some kind of a crazy news
[3:09:18] just just just in the past week about a
[3:09:21] two uh uh air crash and I mean all sorts
[3:09:25] of crazy

[3:09:37] of
[3:09:38] corruption an age of
[3:09:42] deception praise the
[3:09:45] Lord there is nothing in this age that
[3:09:48] can influence us to
[3:09:52] God show me one out there in the
[3:09:55] society there is nothing in this
[3:10:04] age no matter how religious it appeared
[3:10:08] itself or show itself to
[3:10:13] be it's it's just bringing us to a crowd
[3:10:16] and just for inter
[3:10:18] entertainment and some of the and some
[3:10:20] of the people that are behind it I mean
[3:10:22] God have
[3:10:26] mercy it's all have become a moneymaking
[3:10:35] scam but
[3:10:36] God that is mindful of you and
[3:10:40] myself in KN that he will have a people
[3:10:42] in this
[3:10:43] age he has to make a way of Escape
[3:10:49] praise the Lord and our way of Escape
[3:10:52] was to send seven
[3:10:54] angels that will open the
[3:10:57] seals and reveal to us the
[3:11:00] Mysteries that were healing in the Bible
[3:11:03] because it is those healing Divine
[3:11:06] mystery
[3:11:07] truth that will literally change us is
[3:11:11] those healing Mysteries Divine mystery
[3:11:15] truth that will give you Authority
[3:11:18] that's what truth brings to you truth
[3:11:21] make you bold that's right that's right
[3:11:24] praise the Lord it makes you bold look
[3:11:27] at Daniel and all of these guys there in
[3:11:30] Babylon and say King we are not careful
[3:11:33] to answer you in this matter why because
[3:11:35] they new
[3:11:44] truth praise the Lord
[3:11:51] God plac his
[3:11:55] church on the Angelic
[3:12:00] influence think about it when at the
[3:12:03] first coming of Christ at the first
[3:12:07] coming of
[3:12:10] Christ before the Messenger will be
[3:12:13] born John God sent an angel
[3:12:18] to his
[3:12:22] father amen praise the
[3:12:26] Lord the one that will that will be
[3:12:30] used as an incubator the h h h uh the
[3:12:33] young virgin that God will use to bring
[3:12:37] forth to chel himself in
[3:12:42] flesh before
[3:12:44] God God could have done it he could have
[3:12:48] just done it Mary wake up one morning
[3:12:49] she just feeling different she's
[3:12:51] vomiting and and get morning uh sickness
[3:12:53] and all of that God could have done
[3:12:56] it praise the
[3:12:58] Lord but you see it will lead her into
[3:13:01] more
[3:13:04] confusion so an angel met
[3:13:10] her how will this
[3:13:14] happen he says I will overshadow you
[3:13:18] you what does that means I will
[3:13:21] influence
[3:13:23] you I will overshadow you that's what
[3:13:26] influence does it
[3:13:31] overshadow when you are under influence
[3:13:33] it overshadow you that you can't even
[3:13:35] see anything
[3:13:39] different praise the Lord you can't see
[3:13:42] anything different nothing makes sense
[3:13:43] to you when you want an influence of De
[3:13:47] or nothing made sense to
[3:13:49] you because you are
[3:13:52] overshadow God had to influence her
[3:13:56] Joseph was about to put Mary away the
[3:13:59] angel had to come in his dream and
[3:14:01] influence
[3:14:08] him if at the first coming of Christ God
[3:14:13] had to send Angel to influence the
[3:14:16] people
[3:14:17] that will be
[3:14:19] involved how much more about his second
[3:14:26] coming think about it the god of Heaven
[3:14:30] and Earth the god of Abraham Isaac and
[3:14:32] Jacob is borrowing a body to come in
[3:14:35] flesh how many people knew about
[3:14:39] it the entire Sahan counsel casting down
[3:14:42] and said that that the girl she's crazy
[3:14:44] she's in adulterate she slept with a man
[3:14:47] that thing has never happened but yet
[3:14:49] the reading from the from the from the
[3:14:50] Torah a virgin shall
[3:14:56] conceive why because they were under a
[3:14:58] wrong
[3:15:01] influence they are reading it it's
[3:15:03] happening before them and they can't
[3:15:05] believe
[3:15:12] it I say to you tonight
[3:15:17] just like the Lord said to Isaiah who
[3:15:19] shall go for
[3:15:24] us in
[3:15:27] 2025 who shall Go For
[3:15:30] Us Praise the
[3:15:33] Lord who's going to raise up the banner
[3:15:37] of
[3:15:38] Holiness the banner of
[3:15:40] sincerity the banner of
[3:15:43] dedication the banner of prayer just
[3:15:47] just like our brother
[3:15:48] said what we want a new year
[3:15:52] for what we want a new year for if
[3:15:55] nothing is going to be new then what we
[3:15:58] want a new year
[3:16:00] for what do we need a new year for if
[3:16:04] nothing is going to be
[3:16:10] new but I'm telling you nothing will be
[3:16:14] new until your influence change
[3:16:17] until your source of influence
[3:16:21] change it will just be a change of
[3:16:27] calendar until the our source of
[3:16:30] influence
[3:16:33] change this man was a
[3:16:36] prophet he was a prophet of God he was
[3:16:40] not ashame to say wo is me
[3:16:47] he was not finding somebody else to
[3:16:50] blame he were not coming and say God you
[3:16:53] know you know youah we were friends you
[3:16:55] know I I was just sorry for him no he
[3:16:58] took
[3:17:00] responsibility he took
[3:17:02] ownership and say whoo is me I'm undone
[3:17:06] if you don't help
[3:17:10] me you can't blame nobody for your
[3:17:13] condition
[3:17:14] though you can't blame anybody for your
[3:17:19] situation push bla as much as you want
[3:17:22] right in your
[3:17:29] face if we will be like
[3:17:33] Isaiah and take responsibility to
[3:17:37] ourself and say Lord whoo is me and
[3:17:40] that's how I feel I don't blame anybody
[3:17:43] for this church condition God placed me
[3:17:45] here to be Pastor I hold myself
[3:17:47] responsible for what take place
[3:17:57] here I hold myself
[3:18:03] responsible praise the
[3:18:06] Lord and I hope you are holding yourself
[3:18:08] responsible for what is taking place
[3:18:15] also see the way he broke the wrong
[3:18:20] influence see the way he broke this not
[3:18:22] by making
[3:18:24] excuses but by taking
[3:18:28] responsibility he said Lord whoo is
[3:18:31] me I'm
[3:18:34] undone I'm a man of unclean lips I sat
[3:18:38] down in the palace talking polit
[3:18:40] politics when I'm supposed to be at the
[3:18:42] altar here holding the fire of God what
[3:18:45] is me
[3:18:47] I'm undone a man of unclean legs among
[3:18:50] people with unclean lips that's exactly
[3:18:52] what he meant I was spending my time
[3:18:55] there in the palace just talking
[3:18:56] politics we're talking about Samra we're
[3:18:58] talking about damasco we talking about
[3:19:01] this other place when I'm supposed to be
[3:19:03] to the altar crying for the people of
[3:19:05] Israel
[3:19:20] if there is one
[3:19:23] thing that this present Society has
[3:19:25] given
[3:19:26] us is to sh responsibility and look for
[3:19:30] who to
[3:19:32] blame praise the
[3:19:34] Lord Shan responsibility is is is is
[3:19:38] fing it into the minds of the
[3:19:43] children you realize that it's a sport
[3:19:46] it's a sport age is a sport
[3:19:50] Society a society that Fe
[3:19:54] entitle Fe
[3:19:57] entitled and that same thing is is is in
[3:20:00] the church the people Fe
[3:20:09] entitled but read your Bible
[3:20:11] carefully you will realize that any man
[3:20:15] that ever walked with God was a man that
[3:20:20] owned his
[3:20:22] responsibility when Daniel Prayed he
[3:20:24] said Lord forgive me my sin the sin of
[3:20:28] my father house and the sin of our
[3:20:32] nation they own
