[2:57] the Jews what they were going to do so
[3:00] they got scared but what happened when
[3:02] this creightoning power fell from heaven
[3:04] there was a bravery set upon them
[3:07] there was something an understanding
[3:10] where they wasn't too sure of it a few
[3:12] hours before they know he had he had
[3:16] died they know he had risen they talked
[3:19] to him on the way but was that thing for
[3:21] them or was it just for them for Jesus
[3:23] himself but here on the day of Pentecost
[3:26] the Holy Spirit the abstract fell upon
[3:30] the Believers that made them part of his
[3:33] resurrection
[3:35] made him part of his Fellowship
[3:39] the Holy Spirit came and confirmed to
[3:42] them that they would be raised up
[3:44] because they were potentially raised
[3:47] then
[3:48] from cowards to Brave man
[3:50] they were
[3:52] they were afraid of the very word that
[3:54] they thought don't let this pass over
[3:56] you they were afraid they know that he
[3:59] was that word
[4:00] even the Jews had to admit it Nicodemus
[4:03] said Rabbi we know that you're a teacher
[4:06] that come from God no man that could do
[4:09] the things you do except God be with him
[4:11] now we know that we recognize that so
[4:14] the disciples Peter had even sworn in
[4:17] his presence all of them had forsaken
[4:19] him at the crucifixion but here they are
[4:22] now up in this Upper Room
[4:24] in the presence of God then all of a
[4:27] sudden here come this Holy Spirit down
[4:30] from heaven and it quickened them and
[4:33] the quickly took place they wasn't
[4:35] afraid to make a witness of the message
[4:39] that they believed in known to be the
[4:41] truth
[4:42] otherwise they were afraid of it
[4:44] amen how many Presbyterians how many
[4:46] methodists how many Baptists in the
[4:49] world today how many Pentecostals
[4:51] that's a knows the truth and afraid to
[4:56] make a standalone
[4:57] I'm persuaded to wonder what was that
[4:59] fell on you
[5:02] are you a part of his resurrection would
[5:05] you dare scream all for some man's
[5:08] Therian idea harv you got the real
[5:12] bonus in the the real manhood it takes
[5:15] to stand out and call right right and
[5:18] wrong wrong
[5:19] are you a part of his resurrection
[5:22] are you a worshiper of a bunch of Creeds
[5:25] or you're going to church do you have
[5:27] your name on there and dad is sin and
[5:29] trespasses he that believes not the full
[5:31] word of God is a sinner
[5:33] those Pharisees believed in many things
[5:35] to be the truth they said we're God's
[5:38] children and they were until that word
[5:41] was preached but when that word was
[5:43] preached and Vindicated then they become
[5:46] sinners
[5:48] for rejecting the thing that they know
[5:50] was right and witness that we know the
[5:52] harder teacher come from God for no man
[5:55] could do the things that you do without
[5:56] God being with him
[5:58] hot water today where are we at
[6:02] where is this Resurrection finding us
[6:05] are you dance
[6:08] are you dare to take God at his word
[6:10] that's it
[6:12] if you're ordained alive you sure will
[6:15] do it if you're an eagle you can't help
[6:17] doing it there's something in you or do
[6:20] you want to serve a Creed somewhere say
[6:22] I go to church I'm just as good as you
[6:23] are
[6:24] see if you hold old birth rights you
[6:27] will never see it you can't see it but
[6:31] if you do hold a possession of this
[6:33] Birthright you can't help from seeing it
[6:36] because it's part of you and you're a
[6:39] part of it
[6:40] my other mother give me birth
[6:43] how could I have a father that his own
[6:45] blood is in me how could ignize Charles
[6:47] Brown for me and my father I could not
[6:50] do it I'm willing to stand his reproach
[6:52] or anything else because I am his son
[6:56] Hallelujah
[6:58] then being the son of God
[7:00] and he was the word of God
[7:03] how often I deny that Bible being truth
[7:06] that Jesus Christ isn't the same
[7:07] yesterday today and forever and see the
[7:10] hour that we're living in we need our
[7:13] Easter in the church
[7:16] Resurrection
[7:17] we need a resurrection to power of pain
[7:21] man we need to stand out for that which
[7:24] is God's Vindicated word
[7:27] say well we have in our Youth for Christ
[7:29] that's all right our church is having a
[7:31] meeting we want to know so many members
[7:32] nothing against that that's all right
[7:35] but that's only the atmosphere
[7:39] that might be an old hens feathers
[7:42] but if you'll get in the right
[7:43] atmosphere the aerial hatch an eagle if
[7:45] you're a eagle egg and if you were for
[7:47] our date of God to Sid you gain help
[7:50] from seeing it
[7:51] you're coming for their Resurrection
[7:54] that's the way the Baptist is born
[7:56] that's where the Methodist is born in
[7:58] the resurrection that day
[8:00] but they turned off to him instead of an
[8:02] eagle
[8:04] I said not long ago going down from
[8:05] Tucson
[8:07] I watched a very strange thing I've seen
[8:09] a hawk sitting on the wire down there
[8:12] that Hulk has long lost its
[8:14] identification
[8:16] it used to be a bird next to the eagle
[8:18] it could not follow the eagle no by no
[8:21] means nothing can fall an eagle
[8:23] but he was a hawk Christ is the eagle
[8:27] and the church should at least be a hawk
[8:30] they could fly higher than any other
[8:31] rest of hers but that Hawk has become
[8:34] soft
[8:35] amen this lost his identification
[8:39] he sits on the telephone wires and waits
[8:41] for some dead rabbit
[8:45] he hops like a vulture and instead of
[8:48] flying like a hawk
[8:50] and all my brother's sister you
[8:51] Pentecostal people which is my own dear
[8:54] people
[8:55] the church is losing its identification
[8:58] it's coming down and depending on some
[9:01] dead formal Creed
[9:03] instead of buying in the heavily shutter
[9:05] for fresh matter
[9:06] a Hulk used to hunt his own manner but
[9:09] today he takes what the automobiles run
[9:11] over what the vultures eat
[9:13] he hops like one he looks like one we
[9:16] saw adorned ourselves in the modern
[9:18] world are women cutting their hair and
[9:21] wearing shorts are a man but not enough
[9:23] backbone to stand the pulpit and tell
[9:25] the truth
[9:26] we've long gone soft on the word whole
[9:30] gods and the Holy Ghost and look out
[9:32] them Eagles somewhere that's ready to
[9:34] stand now no matter what takes place
[9:36] that'll soar into the unknown
[9:39] not set on the telephone wires and look
[9:41] for some Sunday school literature to
[9:43] come in let me have the word in it as
[9:45] precious of the power and demonstration
[9:47] of the Holy Ghost
[9:49] we need a Easter
[9:51] a resurrection
[9:53] that's potentials my friend if you're
[9:56] satisfied with such a Karen of the world
[9:59] there's something wrong
[10:01] my sister my brother let me say to your
[10:04] sin Godly fear knowing that I may never
[10:06] live to Sinister again
[10:09] but there's one thing sure what a
[10:11] genuine four Dean Son of God by the word
[10:15] of God hears that voice of God he'll
[10:18] rise and go to me
[10:20] it's the potential that is going to meet
[10:22] the real living word as he was the bride
[10:26] will meet the groom she's a part of his
[10:28] body
[10:29] notice long have we we're losing our
[10:32] identifications we come on Wednesday
[10:34] night some of us others stay home to
[10:37] watch who love Susie
[10:39] televisions all kinds of worldly things
[10:41] all kinds of entertainments to keep you
[10:43] away from church
[10:45] long have we lost it our seminaries our
[10:48] schools are putting out a bunch of
[10:49] rickies with a whole lot of Theology and
[10:53] entertainment and everything in the
[10:55] church to take the place of the prayer
[10:56] meeting
[10:57] we've talked dressed and try to fulfill
[11:00] what the modernists try to do bring them
[11:02] in you will never win them by that they
[11:04] got more of that you have
[11:06] you ain't got no business on your ground
[11:08] on their ground let them come over on
[11:11] yours for their real baptism is shining
[11:13] or the real power of the Resurrection
[11:17] don't try to build a church like theirs
[11:18] don't try to have a pastor like that
[11:20] don't try to do this other or cooperate
[11:22] with the world
[11:24] they shot
[11:26] with Hollywood the real gospel goes with
[11:30] power
[11:31] Eagles hear that they don't look for a
[11:34] shine
[11:35] they look for a goal going with humility
[11:38] glowing with love glowing with power
[11:40] that's what the real Eagle hunts you
[11:43] can't scratch in a barnyard and please
[11:44] him you'll never be able to do it you'll
[11:47] never touch him because he don't believe
[11:49] him
[11:49] let that voice scream from the heavens I
[11:52] am he that was
[11:56] the place
[11:58] you need a damn forever and it shall
[12:00] come to pass in the last days I'll pour
[12:03] out of myself upper Hall's flesh
[12:06] glory to God I'll Quicken your Immortal
[12:09] language I'll Quicken your Immortal
[12:10] tones I'll give you the evidence so I'm
[12:12] going to bring in the resurrection with
[12:14] me
[12:15] hungry hearted Eagles reach for that
[12:17] just as hard as they can
[12:19] it's a pearl of great price that they
[12:21] sell everything else to go by
[12:24] God help us friend
[12:26] our churches are losing their
[12:27] identification
[12:29] It's Quickly now how to go to Sun what's
[12:31] the action of those disciples a scared
[12:34] they know Jesus was the truth
[12:38] but to see it was against a popular idea
[12:41] the proper religion of the hour
[12:44] the most strictest religion Sarah
[12:46] Pharisees Sadducees now and so forth
[12:48] they're close to Clans and denominations
[12:52] they were they were against that heresy
[12:55] but Jesus was the identified word
[12:58] and Jesus is the Holy Ghost
[13:02] in spirit
[13:03] a little while in a world see if you
[13:05] know more you shall see me not the body
[13:07] the life that was in in God
[13:10] it is upon the church to call Sons like
[13:12] he did that obedient
[13:15] I'll always do that which is pleasing to
[13:17] my Father which one of you can use me of
[13:19] sin in other words sin is unbelief what
[13:22] has the word said about me that I
[13:24] haven't done
[13:26] show me what the word said that I do it
[13:28] I didn't do which one can accuse me
[13:30] which one can lay your fingers on me and
[13:32] say that I haven't fulfilled my father's
[13:34] word or when the Pentecostal Church gets
[13:37] to that spot
[13:39] who can accuse me of unbelief
[13:42] oh Christians be identified not as a
[13:45] hawk but an eagle
[13:47] that Hulk is soft he'll come down you
[13:49] never see an eagle doing that you don't
[13:51] ever do that he hunts his own food out
[13:53] of the blue
[13:54] God's prepared him so he can see it he
[13:56] gets fresh Manna not something is dead
[13:59] in the Hebrews when he crossed to the
[14:01] Wilderness they eat try to eat dead
[14:03] Manna it'll become stagnant it had it
[14:06] had wiggle tails in it
[14:09] you know what we mean it's a
[14:11] contaminated rotten maggots is in it
[14:13] amen why would I eat a food that had
[14:16] been dead years ago
[14:18] it might be in form and shape but it
[14:20] isn't fresh we got to get food every
[14:23] generation new
[14:26] so does the eagle look for that food
[14:28] every generation as we're in our journey
[14:31] notice now let's take some people again
[14:33] let's take some of the Old Testament
[14:35] prophets see what they did let's look
[14:38] first at Stevens house Stevens in the
[14:40] midst of that Sanhedrin Council well
[14:43] that counselor brought him up there that
[14:45] great assembly of the Believers there
[14:47] are supposed to be Believers brought him
[14:48] up and tried to condemn him why he said
[14:51] you stiff necks uncircumcised and heart
[14:53] and ears you always resist the Holy
[14:55] Ghost
[14:56] that's that eternal life is your
[14:59] father's did it back on Earth through
[15:00] the prophets so are you doing it today
[15:02] and they asked upon him with their teeth
[15:04] they didn't want to hear that here's the
[15:06] gifts their Credence against their
[15:07] denomination and they stoned the man to
[15:09] death and he raised his hands up and
[15:10] look towards him and say I see Heavens
[15:12] open and Jesus stands the right side why
[15:15] he had the resurrection quickening power
[15:18] in him that took him into the bosoms of
[15:20] Jesus
[15:22] notice quickly now look at Philip down
[15:25] there in a great Revival
[15:27] having a Revival for it had been
[15:29] garrisoned for any man well if we had
[15:31] got a big cooperation amongst the
[15:33] churches and everything down there is
[15:34] having a great Revival and the
[15:36] quickening power of God spoke James said
[15:38] Stephen
[15:39] may have said this you're having a great
[15:41] Revival but I got one man I want you to
[15:44] talk to
[15:45] and Stephen's obedient no matter what it
[15:48] is how much criticism oh Stevens you
[15:50] can't leave but I can
[15:52] God said so and he went out into the
[15:54] desert and out there he found this
[15:56] eunuch and what happened he said has uh
[16:00] if thou believe us with all thine heart
[16:02] that Jesus is the son of God uh I'll
[16:04] baptize you when he baptized him look he
[16:07] was quickened by this quickening power
[16:09] to leave a Revival of thousands of
[16:12] people to go out into the desert to one
[16:15] man
[16:16] oh that'll be against all reasons
[16:19] see while these ten thousand won't you
[16:22] hear but there's one wanting out there
[16:25] see and the quickening power sent into
[16:28] God's provided place
[16:31] Hallelujah man and women it'll make you
[16:33] stand to your feet it'll make you do the
[16:35] things that God wants you to do I don't
[16:37] care what somebody else says about the
[16:39] neighbor said well that person's lost
[16:40] her mind pray all night they'll read the
[16:42] Bible I don't care what they say it's
[16:44] what God called you to do yes that's
[16:46] right or they say we can't have these
[16:48] old-fashioned Pentecostal revivals like
[16:50] oh yes we can too you can have it in
[16:52] yourself
[16:53] and you are the majority in God no
[16:56] matter what the rest of them think
[16:57] notice after in obedience
[17:00] listen close now after obeying God to
[17:03] his word when he fulfilled his mission
[17:05] that quickening power that he received
[17:07] at Pentecost caught him away
[17:10] quick in his body
[17:12] miles and miles away he was taken in the
[17:15] spirit
[17:16] and was found over in another country
[17:18] somewhere quickening power of God and if
[17:22] we be Pentecostals that same power
[17:25] that raised up Jesus from the dead if it
[17:27] dwells in your mortal bodies
[17:29] amen all right notice let's take another
[17:32] man with his quickly power there was a
[17:34] man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch
[17:39] want a new thing come along with
[17:41] something come along and say well now we
[17:42] have to go back to the old school or
[17:43] this side the other Enoch walk with God
[17:47] whatever God said dude Enoch never
[17:50] missed one word
[17:52] he walked with God what was he he was
[17:54] the son of God he was an eagle and been
[17:58] called to that day and when he come to
[18:00] him he was so full of that quickening
[18:02] power remember he'd walk 500 years or
[18:04] more before God and not one time had he
[18:07] missed his word
[18:09] not one time did he misbehave himself
[18:11] not one time do you do but kept the
[18:14] testimony everything that God told him
[18:16] do he went and done it no argument about
[18:19] it he just wasn't done it no matter what
[18:20] anybody else thought he went and done it
[18:22] why he was full of that quickening power
[18:24] and when it comes time for the old man
[18:26] to die God is sent out a letter and he
[18:28] walked up home
[18:29] he quickened him and took his mortal
[18:32] body up in a rapture
[18:35] amen that's that quickly power
[18:38] look at Elijah after his work was
[18:41] finished on Earth he was so full of that
[18:43] quickening power he condemn them Jackie
[18:46] Kennedy haircuts in his day
[18:48] he told Jezebel what he thought of her
[18:51] he told them preachers and Priests what
[18:53] was right and wrong and they didn't
[18:55] believe him but he condemned them
[18:56] painted face women they so bad and he's
[18:58] so full of that quick and empowered to
[19:00] nothing could harm him
[19:02] God had fed him in the heavens tuck him
[19:04] out and set him aside and he was so full
[19:06] of creating power come time to Die the
[19:07] Jordan opened up and he just walked to
[19:09] sit down a chair and took him up home
[19:12] so full of their quickening power he
[19:14] become a true genuine Son of God
[19:19] notice he had a successor and his name
[19:23] was Elisha
[19:24] and Elisha had a doubled Post in this
[19:26] quick and Power
[19:28] see he had a double potion of it now he
[19:31] preached for about 80 years or he was
[19:33] about 80 years old he took sick and die
[19:36] he didn't get to go home like Elijah did
[19:38] see both of them is represented there in
[19:40] the church
[19:41] some Saints Go in some resting but
[19:44] notice when Elijah was taken up in the
[19:46] rapture
[19:48] then Elisha went to sleep and God full
[19:52] of quickening power look at his prophecy
[19:55] just before he died
[19:57] okay
[19:58] now let me show you I don't care if
[20:00] you're dead or where you're at that
[20:02] quickening power never leads
[20:06] years and years after his death
[20:09] his meat and rotted away the skin worms
[20:12] and eat it up
[20:14] but they were packing a dead man one day
[20:16] throwed him in on that bones and they
[20:19] were so much quickening power there
[20:20] actually man come back to life again
[20:22] Hallelujah
[20:25] raise him up from the dead because that
[20:28] quickening power that was up on that
[20:31] saint of God never left him
[20:33] stayed right on those bones all remember
[20:36] we are flesh of his flesh bone of his
[20:41] bones if we are his bride
[20:43] death won't bother that quickening power
[20:46] at all
[20:47] though the skin worms destroys this body
[20:49] yet in my flesh shall I see God
[20:52] glory to God
[20:56] I don't know what to say
[20:59] not a hope for an old man like me
[21:02] knowing I see my end time right I
[21:04] understand that's 56 years old that's
[21:07] that's a little bitty boy I've stood
[21:08] here trying to Proclaim this but I know
[21:11] that in me nothing good that I have
[21:14] nothing I've done
[21:15] but in me is that quickening power it
[21:18] quickened me one day for the things of
[21:20] the world
