amen glory be to god let's take second peter uh thank you musicians let's just take second period we have 10 minutes here before us let's take second period i just want to make some few coming that i was listening to statute of epiphany uh today i'm just trying to relax my mind you know just listening to the message like i've never listened to it before praise the lord amen you know because it looks like we have the tendency to remember that we have listening to it so there are a lot of things that just slip through the cracks amen and i was listening to the message today and then i was asking myself wow wow this is um let's read the first verse here and i have you have your seed psalm peter seven and an apostle of jesus christ to them they have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ the lord bless you you can have your seed praise the lord amen and then uh peter yeah says in verse two grace and peace you know there's there's something i was i was uh looking at i was a kind of a looking at paul ministry and uh i never thought about it when i was reading this today but it just kind of a stick out to me yeah you realize that if you if you check your your bible and read your bible very well maybe i can give that to you as an assignment you realize that this is the only time that peter used the word grace he never used grace in all of his episode james never used grace praise the lord none of the apostles use grace beside paul praise the lord that's not what i wanted to talk about but let me just show you something i've kind of wrote some few notes on there as i was studying you know brother brandon preached a message called the message of grace he had the message of grace or he entitled his message the message of grace which of course that's what the message is but paul actually had the ministry of grace he had the ministry of grace now this this is uh this is something uh completely a little bit out of the blues tonight it just kind of for cut my my mind here as chapter 20 as chapter 20. and it was almost like it was paul's signature through the entire through his entire episode he wrote 13 episodes and 13 is the number of a woman so he was the first messenger to the church that is a type of the bride and he wrote to seven churches he wrote to seven churches in his 13 episode and uh a letter there to philemon and uh and but you look at you know the church there in rome the believers there in rome the ones in corinth the ones in galatia thessalonica and out of there he wrote seven seven episodes of the church he i mean if you just look at the way the holy spirit design it is is such a beautiful thing but let's let's read this verse right here i said uh uh what did i say ask chapter 20 and uh let's read from verse 22 paul year was talking to the editors of the ephesian church age and uh he called them to a little island and he was kind of giving them some few instruction and last words because they won't see him anymore verse 22 he says and now behold a gold bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not ignoring the things that shall be forming there well he's saying not knowing because in himself he don't know but the uh agabus have already prophesied that bounce is waiting for him praise the lord amen but graham talks about that a little bit but i won't go into that uh tonight let me just stay where i am you know he says not ignoring the things that shall be for me he know that the holy spirit have already said to the man that have this you know this cult you know there there are bounds that is waiting for him but he did not you know he did not knew everything that would happen you know how everything would happen he didn't know but that uh paul just like he expressed in the book of romans he had such a burden for his people like he said in romans chapter 9 i wish you know i wish that uh uh you know there's a way i can say it to my people for them to understand that blindness in part has happened to us for the gospel to go on to the gentiles but you see that he was not he was not called actually for the jews even though he wanted to to to make them to understand you know and explain the ministry of jesus christ because that was the very thing that he persecuted praise the lord but the jews never forgive him for that they felt like he betrayed him praise the lord so every time the poor show up in jerusalem there was chaos there was riot they were ready to beat him they were ready to just say this man he's a betrayer praise the lord so that's part uh agavas has already prophesied paul was still wanting to go to jerusalem praise the lord it just shows how much he had his people on his heart okay let's just read a little bit here and now behold i go in bounds in the spirit unto jerusalem and not knowing the things that shall be for me said that the holy ghost witness in every city saying that bounds and affliction by me yeah he's testifying not knowing everything but the holy ghost witness you know there was prophecies you know in vision and people calling paul you know i had this vision but paul was still going but none of these things move me need account my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my cause with joy and the ministry and my finish my cause with joy and the ministry listen now the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus the ministry which i have received to testify the gospel of the grace of god so his ministry was to testify of the grace of god that's the reason why every episode that paul wrote it was his signature grace and peace the grace of god be unto you praise the lord and you'll realize you you know verb talk exposition uh a hebrew exposition when brother brown was teaching hebrew exposition and and and you read commentaries i mean there's this big argument there of who wrote the book of hebrew sure and paul was the one that wrote the book of hebrew praise the lord because but there was a reason why he did not identify himself why because he was he was writing that book to send it to the jews now if he says i paul the apostle they will not receive it sure so he disguised himself but you can still see his signature at the end of the book he closer with the grace of god [Laughter] praise the lord oh my what a messenger you know is it it intrigues me when brother branham said he preached why paul preached you know it's uh there was just there was just a whole lot of things there you know so he had that it was it was poor ministry there was nobody that did with the subject of grace like the way the apostle paul teach the grace of god praise the lord that's the reason why every church he rebuked them he rebuked the the galatians from from from uh uh from the false preachers that was trying to put them into legalizing and hold on to the lord he was studying and that is not what that is not your message who have deceived you all foolish galatians the very same thing that you have you are going right back to bind yourself into lord and legalism he cried to the corinthian church to see him the collusion church the same praise the lord amen so that was paul ministry to testify of the gospel of the grace of god now so peter year used this word grace and peace and that's the only time he used it being multiplied onto you i mean i mean ii peter chapter 2 now be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of our lord jesus praise the lord now you you uh you listening to uh uh uh statue of epiphany brother branham in reading this scripture year he talks a little bit of of of light precious faith you know he talks about peter greeting here he says uh peter greet them they have parting like precious faith you know and and and in dared in the church ages he he talks about you know you read the bible and and you read the foster books of mata then you see all of those things that uh you know the disciples here is paul that is saying you know even though they are prophesying everywhere word from the lord that bounds await me but none of those things move me you read all of those things and you see you it almost looks like man those guys they have faith they had they have they had an extraordinary faith the prophet god said peter year is identifying our faith that we have today with the effect he's saying to them that has light precious faith praise the lord amen and another thing that is there is to be able to appreciate how precious your faith is the bible says without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and we will look at that a little bit tonight with a few minutes that is before us i'm not i'm not preaching i'll just read a few verses here to make some coming that's what i'm doing but we would we just talk a little bit of how precious that faith is grace and peace be multiplied unto you true the knowledge of god and and of the lord jesus i call into his divine i call him as his divine power has given unto us all things amen all things that pertain unto life all things all means all all things that pertain unto life by his divine power he has given us all things that we will ever have in this life he has given it to us praise the lord all things that pertinent to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby by giving unto us a sitting great and precious promises he has given us all things amen and he has given us this great and and and uh great exceeding precious promises that by this year might be partakers the word particus year is is uh is is a word that hold the sense of partner which of course uh christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham says that's what he have called us told to be joined here's with christ is to be partner praise the lord amen so god don't only want to deliver you he wants to make you part of the deliverance praise the lord amen he wants to make you part that's the reason why he wants you to express faith and through your faith he will work through their faith and bring you to deliverance so we are called into partnership praise the lord we are not called uh uh uh uh you know uh like like like one that is that is just that is just higher to work just do your eight hours and go praise the lord you know there's there is there is there is completely different when a man is employed and he's just supposed to do his his his time eight five whatever hour and goal is complete when a man is a partner and he knows that he's a shareholder he's involved he worked beyond his eight hours when he's a partner he's he don't need to be taught [Music] because he's a partner praise the lord paul use a word yeah but i i will i would just let's just go ahead because i will uh i mean peter used a word here and then it's the same word that paul used every time uh the apostle used that word as seven peter s7 and an apostle it goes back to the jubilee that word seven means a bound slave it goes back to the jubilee is is it is that it is that uh it is that seven all that slave that refused to go and have pierced his ear that's that's the one that is called a bound a bound seven so every time they use that word that's what they are referring to that i'm about i don't have nowhere to go i've been so out to the master my ear is pierced [Laughter] oh praise the lord amen are you a bound seven you feel like that praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah you don't go on vacation on god if you are a bound seven you don't have nowhere to go [Laughter] you know people people go on vacation on god let me just relax small you know let me let me relax from this church business a little bit praise the lord those ones they are just higher by season if you are a bound seven you are in season and out of season your service is in season and out of season you don't go on vacation on god are we together we're just reading the bible here counting the clock amen but i i enjoyed the prayer meeting praise the lord i enjoyed the atmosphere we could have gone on and on verse 4 whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and pressure promises and by this year might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the word true love praise the lord and beside this giving all diligence out to your faith that faith that is precious amen now you will realize there is not there is not anything that faith is additional but everything is added to faith praise the lord there is not anything that fake is added to but everything is added to faith and uh and you know as as we grow in the lord and you read the word and you you're listening to the message sometimes you you just realize and and you you kind of for being earnest with yourself you say lord how how how did we miss this thing because it's the same voice you know it's the same voice of the prophet we've been listening to all of these years praise the lord how did we taught that brother branham was saying something you know uh uh unveiling of god he says uh trying to say something without saying it he says all of these years i've been trying to say something without saying it you know so so i was listening to to to that message today and i was just i was just uh you know because the way that we have uh uh presented the message the statue of the perfect man as if to say it is something uh come you know uh completely different or a complete different work than the work that grace will be doing in our life and and and because of that people make a movement over this subject you know that's the seventh vets you i mean we we got to get that seven virtue and come to the capstone you know for for for the capstone to come down on the seventh venue and and all of that but all that that peter was trying to say it in and which of course that's what brother branham said on tape all he was trying to teach us is just fruit bearing it's just fruit bearing he was just he was just using another approach but if you look at what he's talking about and i think i i copied something but bram said right at the beginning of the message let me see if i share that with you i didn't send it back there so don't look for it up praise the lord i hope when he was starting uh that message statue of a perfect man he said this morning i want to speak on the subject or teach rather if we can build a living tabernacle so he's using peter's language art to say we will build a living tabernacle praise the lord because that's what a builder does he i won't break to another sure but if you go along you will realize that brother branham says all those virtue comes through our faith now you think about it you think about the seven uh uh uh a vector that is given here by by the uh uh the apostle peter and and and you know and and and and the way we think that's what we need for us to put us in the rapture praise the lord what are we going to do with temperance and patience there when it is here we need it [Music] it's here we need it praise the lord so your passion your knowledge in the world just reveal your faith it reveal the level of faith you have your passion you have to deal with yourself and to deal with other it just reveal your level of faith in the word because faith is the sea faith coming by hearing and hearing of the word of god that's all that's all it's just about a mature christian brethren goes along in the message and said we are building a living monument he said it's a living monument for the living god it's a living tabernacle on two feet it's all showing the maturity of the believer can people be able to draw strength from you can they draw vet you from you that's what that's why the woman with a blood issue date she drew vets you from jesus to heal her but people can draw virtue from you to strengthen them in an hour of weakness but they cannot get it if you don't have it that's right if your faith in the world is not positive to be able to encourage somebody in the worst hour of their life if you don't have enough faith to control your emotions it's your fate in the world that that brings your body under control leave this word and wash your attitude just leave the word praise the lord right leave the word i mean don't read the word don't pray don't come to church praise the lord try it praise the lord you will surprise yourself the things that you will do praise the lord you will surprise yourself or you'll be very surprised you will think that you you are living with somebody else so is it it is that it is the word in the seed form faith coming by hearing as you hear the word and embrace the word and make the world your own don't make it somebody else and the word reveal those areas in your life where he want to grow where he want to bring you up that's all brother branham was teaching that's all he was teaching because peter is teaching the very same thing that jesus taught in john 15. i'm the vine they are the branches praise the lord so peter now at that time jesus was teaching that he was not converted yet right in his mind he's sitting down in church branch van branch where is he this guy is every time he just he's preaching also some message and vine and branching bear fruit yeah i get children about born children yeah thinking about his natural children as his fruit when jesus is talking about spiritual gifts but now he has grown in the lord he can take that very same message honor inspiration he's preaching it with godly character out to your faith thank you and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge temperance praise the lord people that take uh uh uh all of these uh uh one verse doctrine in one verse you know and all of that i mean they've run over the place with uh seven thunder seven that's you and and they thought they were the class of the people and just got themselves into emotion praise the lord and just just deal with them out of the word don't don't talk about the word and they can be so so bitter and arrogant yeah absolutely was not for doctrine he says this morning we are going to build a living tabernacle for the living god praise the lord if you want to know the level of your faith watch your attitude that's all peter was trying to say that if these things abide in you if you have grown in these things if your faith is projecting that to you and knowledge and and i mean you are bringing uh things back to the world and all of that he said if these things abide in you you will not be what barren is the same bearing fruit praise the lord go and listen to the message like you have never listened to it before take everything that you taught that you knew from your mind and just listening listening to learn praise the lord and because the apostle peter said odd we feel like it's something we can do you know we can we can add fate you know so we we are working ourselves no but brahms is all of those virtue comes through your faith is the growth of your faith is the expression of your faith the way you deal with things show your level of faith in god the way you deal with things if you are anxious and and don't have patience to wait on god for things you just want it to happen it shows your level of faith praise the lord if you are conscious about your public appearance how you dress how you present yourself what is doing that is the word that is creating that consciousness in you because you know that you are representing a kingdom so it's the word that is creating that godliness in you you are conscious of that praise the lord you want to be decent in a way you dress in a way you go into public but i mean if you're also doing it because you want to just you just want to show up then yeah the other fate is that ought to fit me at birth because you all have to be about him and not about you that's all that prophet of god was trying to teach us he brought in the weight of the power male he went back representation you know how god expressed himself in the zodiac now he wants to express himself in his people god expressed himself in his word in the prophets but now he has a people a bride in this last day that he want to express himself that these garlic characters take take take uh take these virtues over to the the book of garlic and compare it with the fruit of the spirit they're all the same right they are all the same it's just it's just adjust the the diversities of the fireful ministry they come and take the same scripture and one person preach and paul spoke to them and call it the fruit of the spirit peter here speaking it and calling the vatican oh but how we made a big a big show that never took us anyway when we really thought we were on top of it we really thought we were on top of it praise the lord and all of those things but we thank god for grace that he said having us here and he has given us a second chance again to reveal ourselves and humble ourself and uh you know prophet gosh it is simple we don't have to make it complicated sure we don't have to make it complicated jesus says the son of man come will he find faith praise the lord he said will he find faith you know brother brahm talks about you know uh uh the fate of the son of man and you know and i mean we can get in all of that and and breathe you know bunch of cults and and blow our mind you know the prophet of god said and when we get to this place and that's that's the fate of the son of man you know but what i want to say here like i said from the beginning is to say how much pressure your faith is to you how much pressure your faith in god is to you is it just a religion is it just a concept but it's not supposed to be because the scripture says we walk by faith sons of god are led by faith it's supposed to be our life praise the lord because that's the only way we can please the father is when when he sees us beginning to appreciate what his word is doing in our lives now what we are doing with the word or what the word is doing how precious is your fate to you young people if you start if you if you start appreciating that faith you will water it with reading the word and praying every day because faith coming by hearing and hearing of the word of god you start growing learning to trust god god i trust you learning to take things to god in prayer that's how you grow in that statue because if you if you learn that way then you come to the place where you have had experience and different things that god has done in your life and then when other people are going through they can be able to draw from you they can be able to draw from your life you can be an inspiration to them then you are you are releasing virtue when you are giving counsel you're always telling them what the word says what the word says oh i'll i'll go and ask and find out what the scripture says about this then you are growing in godly knowledge praise the lord this faith is very precious it has make you who you are it has given you the grace for you to be sitting down here tonight praise the lord if i didn't have this fight i can i can guess what my life will be i can guess maybe i might not have been living musicians you can come that's just a little word of hesitation i prayed it was a blessing to you because surely it was a blessing to me when i starts to look in the in the prophet message and realized that we just we just you know i was i was up i was i was studying the other day i started i started becoming trouble in my mind and not trouble like doubt but as i started looking for where brother branham uh uh you know [Music] uh uh where he took the expression uh super race praise the lord i'll share that with you one of these days it's right in the scripture brother man took it from right in the scripture it's it's a word that he used praise the lord but you see the thing about it there is that if we don't understand it if we don't understand what the holy spirit was saying to us then we pretty soon we start to be just like uh hitler and those people because that's what hitler was doing taught that you know uh uh the germans were were super race you know they were super race they were a special class of people and and we take the literal word and not even understanding what the prophet of god was saying and people get so proud they can't they can't associate with their relative because they say we are you know we are the super race bride you know we are this day you don't even understand what what brother branham meant another vision he prophesied about hitler and what would happen he saw all of those things you think brother brandon would just be naive to use the word super race because he wants to breed another people [Music] race grace god's grace grace that is greater than all [Music] [Laughter] grace grace praise god let's stand up to our feet grace thou will power and cleanse [Music] praise god [Music] let's sing that one more time oh yes [Music] is [Music] oh yes grace praise grace praise god is great then all i will say let's pray together now
