and there is precious a father that one he sounds to be just like him and even be better than him praise the Lord because he make all things he never named him he asked Adam to name him whatever name the Adhan give to the animals and plainly please God so we want to God that we can learn that great expression of father who from him you know report us to the place that we have we have no excuse you know if if even if we never knew our Father we never had great father and children responsibility you know if we really come in relationship with God we can understand what true fatherhood is in order to do to us is that we can either appreciate the way our fathers treated us or we can see that you know the who have done their if they have the same relationship that he is bringing us true so we we are grateful for their I was actually going to talk speak on our Father this morning but I decided to go another way so let's just turn to our Bibles job chapter 32 let's turn to our Bibles job

Allah bless you the Lord bless you as we will have our seats and in turn to the book of 2nd Timothy 2nd Timothy I want to pick up chapter 3 2nd Timothy chapter 3 I want to speak this morning on the inspiration of the Almighty give it wisdom the inspiration of the Almighty giveth wisdom and for further for the subtitle if I would call it that grid men I'm not always wise and the way I want to look at that verse this morning is net is net in a negative sense I want to look at that verse this morning from from the background that grid men were not born with silver spoon grid men were not born with easy life so grid men are not always wise there was a period of time that they were exposed to greatness something happened in their life they put their name on the pages of history so grid men are now always wise it's not in a negative sense that because they are great so they are now wise no that's not what I'm going to talk about this morning I'm going to talk about the inspiration of the Almighty give you wisdom so there there is a time word men like Abraham Lincoln George Washington I'm just looking at the news yesterday and I was just I was just feeling so sorry my heart and and realizing what a place we have come to as a generation you know an age that we have come to them and people mind are so crossed they don't even know what they are doing you know with all of the taking down the monuments and everything you know that are happening only for the fact that they can they can contribute their - oh yeah he was a slave owner but they are now looking at what those men's - for that was what the new that was what the new I don't want to go into there this morning but let's just stay in our inspiration great man and now always watch they were not born with service form something happened they came in contact with the inspiration of the almighty that changed their lives David became and even till tomorrow he's the favorite King in Israel when you talk about King the favorite King in Israel the man after God on her that God even promised I will not take the truth even if your sons filming because of David's sake I will still keep a light in Israel he was now born with wisdom he was not born with silver spoon something happened and I can start from right there something happy in the life of David and what happened in the life of David like you might look at it as as a sign as a rejection he saw he's the the smallest of the family and yet his father gave him this responsibility out there to go and take care of the sheep he's never home but that would be the thing that would create greatness in the life of David when he never took offense in what his father give him he never looked at it as as if the father is treating his brothers better than him he never took it as a sense of rejection he never took it as sad as he was cast out or all the other boys were home playing video games he was in the field taking care of his father's sheep but that would be the thing that would build a character of greatness in him the inspiration of the Almighty that's why we want to talk about this morning second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 and 17 the Bible says all scriptures I given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God now this word men of God it was first used in the Bible speaking of the prophets but I want to say this morning the man of God the prophets the man of God the preacher the man of God the Father the man of God the Sun in the house the man of God uh God's children praise the Lord amen thank you for your prayers I mean this week I just got so so tired I was just so exhausted Thursday Friday I don't know some kind of a sweep of tiredness just came I mean but we want to thank the Lord for for keeping us up I mean that the man of God may be perfect that word perfect speaks about being mentored a man of God being trained and and and he knows what to do with the Word of God he knows how to apply the word of God to his home he's learned how to apply the Word of God to his life he learned how to deal with situation in the work area with his friends with his family he knows he learned how to deal with situation by the Word of God that a man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works all Scripture is given by inspiration of God it's given by the breath of God Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone ball by every word of God shall a man leave every word of God is the breath of God if you if you take the word of God reading the word of God and not just really need to have a smart understanding and just really need to assure yourself to your logical is smart but you are reading the Word of God and expecting that that word of God will breathe into your life it will be able to help you to apply your heart to wisdom every scripture is given by inspiration that's the reason why there is no contradiction in God's Word because every scripture is given by inspiration just one verse one line in the Bible is enough to produce God in our lives when God breath into man for him to become a living soul I don't believe that going I just believe that he breathed and man starts to live although I gotta breathe more hotter every scripture is given by inspiration when God speak a word when he made a promise there are antenna thoughts that are behind that promise there are antenna thoughts that you can benefit from now and you will enjoy in eternity that is behind that promise that's the reason why we cannot take one verse in the Bible or one coat and make a doctrine out of it will be we will be limiting their intent of God that's the reason why you don't have to know every chapter every scripture in the Bible to be able to live a life of God if you can just appreciate one verse in the Bible that speaks are so loud to you that words is enough to give you a rapture if faith is enough to change your body every scripture is given by inspiration every scripture God attached his life to eight is the breath of God is the Zoe of God he attached his life to every word it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God that a man of God this does not only limit to the preachers that a man of God that every child of God yeah every child of God God made man in His image male and female it does not take the woman out of this she's also part of it that the man of God is talking about that man made in the image of God that the man of God may be perfect that that son of God and that daughter of God can come to a place of maturity come to a place of understanding that we have not gone a cut we are not following Conan's devised feeble but the one that we are dealing with is the antenna one you know the one the very same one that created the heaven and earth praise the Lord are we together Saint John chapter 1 listen today's in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God that's from verse one and the world was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was me and in him was life in him was life and the life was the light of man now this go back to the beginning the same God that made all things by his word and without him the very thing that he he used to create the universe it's the very thing that he used to make you and myself that life was the light of man praise the Lord when David said the Lord is my light and my salvation David was looking at the beginning you seemed God I said let there be light the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear he's a very strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid the one that we are dealing with is a very same one that created a universe so we want to speak this morning great man and now always wise the inspiration of the Almighty that's what give wisdom for a man whether it was I bought instant whether it was a Benjamin Franklin all of this man whose name I written across history this man to have invented things their names are written across history somewhere along the line distract the inspiration of the Almighty not even Laurie somewhere along the line the struck the inspiration of the Almighty for Benjamin Franklin to think about a electric city that we all are benefiting from somewhere along the line he struck the inspiration of the Almighty they were not born with tablespoon I mean several spoons they were not born with easy lives they have toughness you read a history they had a great beginning some of them were born in I mean look a man like do your movie just a shoeshine boy well right in Chicago now stands a library a university whoever told when he was on the under on the street shiny people shoes he having a shoeshine kids honor his arm whoever taught there will be a a building a university standing in Chicago in his name now like John Wesley the father of the Methodist revival I'll read something down here God keep his word let's start from there I'm I'm ahead of myself this morning that's how I roll my messages but it's okay you are used to it already so you can be able to gather it together praise the Lord where balances men and women that ever amount to a hill of beam has believed God and took God at His Word sometimes they have to walk I heard a great teacher the other morning that's teaching in our officers meaning of the morning I heard him talking about how precious the word was and what he had done true the day's how I did appreciate that how precious the Word of God is and what it has done lives that it has changed and it still has the power to change lives hearts that have mended it still has the power to mean hurt the Word of God has brought healing to live to family Mei said his friends that there has never been at any age and a man and a woman that ever did anything that amount to anything except they took God at His Word praise the Lord now sometimes we ask us as message student we don't we don't seem to to agree to that but we find ourselves in a spoken word University amen and you know you know taking God at this world when we when we when we when we think about that sometimes it's so easy for us to just think that this man they went with with a Bible on their chest sometimes it was just simple honesty it was just simple honesty they just choose to live an earnest life not to tell a lie if they ever told a lie they went back and made it right that thing I told you it was not right just that simple thing because what is truth and we say Jesus is the way the truth and the life so God would just bless a man because he have an earnest heart and that is the inspiration of the Almighty God can use that earnest that earnest channel to be able to reach that man to greatness it's not packing our hairs with with with courts studying on the book of Proverbs I learned that wisdom is too rightly applied knowledge because many people have knowledge this message has brought us a lot of knowledge about the unimportant God they only see em God are the two funny and and future whom we have all of this knowledge but we don't rightly apply them because we it enough to condemn others and condemn ourself to hell we are not able to use it to rise our self above situation wisdom the inspiration of the Almighty giveth wisdom wisdom is to rightly apply knowledge is to rightly apply the Word of God that's why the scripture said that's why Paul says the man of God by the inspiration of the Almighty he will rightly apply the Word of God to every situation in his life and in the life to others we all want mercy but we want to want it for ourselves what am i preaching this morning says a me where I'm a garite oh Jesus hold my hands amen in a man and a woman that ever did amount to anything amount to anything except it took God at His Word we could take all the ball fruits joy we could take the car get in and you know cheese and everything he's talking about them but what is he talking about all of those men that has been able to to give us Kogut to brush our teeth as simple as as it is chocolate for us to enjoy going to buy chocolate people that have sat down and says who I think I have a toad I can make the whole family happy now only the children the old man will also enjoy chocolate just to just to be able to bring something to make the whole family happy because it's God's desire for us to be happy so it's an inspiration of the Almighty that has trapped our main heart for him to be able to face a chocolate bar then when daddy walks through the door with a chocolate bar smile guests on everybody face because we all know we would get a treat that's the inspiration because God desire is to make his people happy but yet what we would do sometimes on a legal lesson we tell the word of God we tell the what of them we don't even give our set treat we don't give our self treat because we fail to realize that internal life in this life is just a shadow it's a faith that we holds within but we are in an earthly body so that's why better Balaam is saying here you can take the fruit the fruit of Jah you can take car gate you can take somebody that make a cheese they even come up with the idea to make cheese that we soon love cheese we can eat our burger with our cheese and as much as you will think it's an invention that he made to to make money out of it but it's something that benefited him arre praise the Lord it's something that benefit us who I've been brushing our teeth with sticks go and cut the flower and brush our teeth and you wash it you shake your mouth and you if you if you ever slept in the woods you know what it is if you ever slept in the wood and forget it carry your toothbrush you know exactly what I'm talking about you clean your teeth you scrub your tongue and everything and as soon as you shout you know exactly where you are I don't even want to go there a male s let's just stay right here amen but as as simple as these things I remember better Branham said in spoken word is that is the original C he says everything that help humanity he say is of God is of God the inspiration of the Almighty he said any of them you wish to in any man that ever meant anything look at George Washington look at Abraham Lincoln look I finly charge is Finley he's calling all of this man praise the Lord and sometimes that's what I've got that's what I'm saying here sometimes he says I say this and you search history there has never been any time you search history I was just doing a little bit of a steady yesterday because sometimes you know I was talking to someone and you see this thing where people don't appreciate you know the thing that they I appreciating brother branham message but making it to looks like everything we ever know you know brother Branham taught us and it came to him by inspiration there was there is there is something about brother Branham that we need to know where Branham he been an illiterate man he was a man that loved to read brother Branham loved looking for information he loved reading I've been coming across different things and sometimes when I when I read I just stopped and I go and make a session on it and I realized this thing is from history we just we have it we have a very sharp knowledge on it because we only take that statement that he said but for him to bring those things to us he's not only measuring you know George Washington name like we were mentioning only from the cold but he read on this man he read on them he appreciated their life well I remember many years back god I was I was preaching and I was just encouraging the young people I says read read take take books and read and the sister came to me after the service she said brother Warren are you saying you mean that we can read other books beside the message book I said oh yeah I said oh yeah and that's one of the thing that that that that is that is easily slipping out of our society with this with this technology age we have we just press google google tell me in this and and and google bring us out and we read everything that we have the knowledge on it but take it take a book and just fill this ago I was looking through looking at as I was staring on this I was looking at different men that brother branham talked about and as in a suburb read I'm talking about buying the one that wrote a paper in progress we should go brother brother even mentioned pregnant progress but how many young people have read pregnant progress how many young people have read it look the message of brother Branham is a prophetic message there are things that he said that that that I lock up in in in prophecies and so you can just take the message to think that you will be able to learn sometimes that's the reason why God we have to bring a ministry and he was I reading something that you have read over and over and it would take that ministry to open that thing to your understanding we have enough having a generation go to the library you see the people that I appreciate the library our older people the young people don't they don't want to library they're having their iPhones they're having their iPhones they're getting earbuds in your head and they shake in your hair moving you know shaking your hand that's all the one and all of those things if you see all the people that take a routine you go to the library to take a book to read all of those things help them to deal with stress because they are reading the book their spirit has traveled in that story they are finding laughter in what they are reading instead of feeling their mind was shut your media that is just vowing the final book where they are really something about history how was this invented how was that invented they are learning and when you read better bring a message you realize that this man with the less education he had he loved to read brother branham loved to read things that catch his eyes he picked it up and he read it and just a line he might find on it the inspiration of the almighty we breathed upon that he would take a story from that he would bring it to us and then what we would do we will make a doctrine out of it just from that one line before the television was was invented that's how family had happy times they take a book everybody sit around they read and laugh about it every evening they were excited whether for that time the Whitney waited for that time because to them it was there it was the entertainment it was a family time when our every every room has its television John you go in your room this other person go in there and everybody get a special movie they want to watch and all of those things have destroy the family call it have destroy the strength of the family sometimes you are saying things people want know what you get it from and it just think that you are trying to bring to your logical things into the message you go and read praise the Lord the inspiration of the Almighty he says I would say this you search history over and over brother Branham even in the church in the church ages he says if you read in history to be able to know about this man and looter and and and and carving in out of this man it was not an injure coming to tell brother Branham there were things that angel told brother Branham but there were things he read in history even when he preached the first set of the church age is the single copy it was just history that he read when they angel revealed to him then he says he said it he says when I preach the church edges first I just read from the commentary that I've got a heart it's a heart that is seeking truth the inspiration of the Almighty there is something that God find me man that he breathed upon that's a desire they say there's a character that little thing that God would find in you that you are in is about that you really want he would just find that little child and said this person always saying this they're always desiring this just like brother Branham what would it be when we leave are we going to be spirit as he keeps thinking on that God giving the privilege to go beyond the cartoon of time the inspiration of the Almighty and notice this as we go along God works with the people who stand for his word who stand for his word respecting all men is the Word of God because the Word of God said by one blood God created all man respecting your elderly is the Word of God and I could call today two men and women authors prophets prayers people that wrote he said I can call their names and everyone that ever amount to anything has been people like Killip and Joshua who may be a stain internally on God's Word the word will stand forever praise the Lord great men are not always wise they were not born with greatness they were born with a humble beginning some of them were not even educated they were not even educated look at look at young man like like Joseph his entire child who was stripped away from him when young people complain and says yeah you know this message make us we don't enjoy our youthfulness or our friends can do this you don't see the blessing that the message the China that it gives you because you go out and expose yourself to those things it's a that this flesh have a sticky nature it sticks on those things and it goes with you for a long time look at young male like down here he proposed in his heart and because he purposed in his heart he opened a channel that the inspiration of the almighty could drop true and God bless him why he was yet in Aires aiya god bless him men and women true true the history Berta Branham talks about Fanny Crosby will read about her in a little bit she never took her blindness to make excuse she never used her blindness to to play the victim oh I'm blind that's why I'm like this but even though she couldn't see the world around her by year by her inspiration she created a word for people to travel through she couldn't see the world around her she couldn't see the flowers and that I mean the brightness of the of the Sun but here by her inspiration the things she wrote the songs she sang the inspiration of the Almighty people look down through history and it says oh this person did this but all the father in their life that they were smoking so they were not a Christian praise the Lord but they were doing something right that God bless that is the conflict that is in a spirit of the generation that is destroying the history that has been written across the world the breaking I may destroy money money or bad there are people that carry this Bible they have worked for the devil out of their lives and men that didn't even read a Bible but their desire to do one good thing for Humanity God blessed God inspire them inspiration of the Almighty give it wisdom when God can find that China in your heart the desire you have that burden you have he can find it it's not selfish you are not looking for your own name you just have a heart to help people man like Nelson Mandela there was a problem Nelson Mandela had when he came came out of prison and became the president everybody - oh yeah now it's the time now where the black South Africans will revenge on the people he said no that was not what I was fighting for he says that was not what I was fighting for however has all I I mean he deceived us it's time for us to to furnish back sometimes this man that got this inspiration never even fully honest or they never even fully honest - they just have that channel God dropped down in that China give them the burden for them to do something just to be able to start it and go a raise of other men that will be able to run with this you think about poor he was Caelius after the God of Israel he was just like David caelius all in his mind these fanatics calling himself Christine they are not standing for the word even though he was in Iran said he was in the wrong group of his hat was right his heart was right because he wanted to stand for God and because he wanted to stand for God God met him and make him to stand for God against the very thing that he was persecuting when a man have a right heart when a man weighs please the Lord where belem talks about all of these people he talks about Eddie he says he says when he was writing he couldn't sell his books there was nothing that seems to go right for him he had an inspiration he's writing nothing seems to go right until one day it struck him when he wrote that song oh he'll the power of Jesus name the inspiration strikes him his name got in the pages of history from the little writings he was doing trying to do something to inspire people nobody knew him but when he put his his pen to the paper and God is spam or he'll oh hell oh wow we sing that song to the National item or here or here to the name of Jesus that is biracial struck him he put his name the inspiration of the almighty Fanny Crosby when they were criticizing her about her sons trying to get her to write worldly sons being morning when the morning ever press listen he sees or somebody on one of these other modern singers you know you're writing about Jesus said Jesus what are you blind writing about God what are you blind it's just a story you open the answer blind and you writing about him why he can open your eyes sometimes the devil get us into that little corner and we sass the reason but Baron says everything he told me was the truth he was caught right into that China of reasoning with the devil he says everything he told me was the truth it took the inspiration of the Almighty God to get him out of that channel of thought great men are not always wise it's the inspiration of the Almighty that give it wisdom is the inspiration of the Almighty that wrote their names across history that we can refer back to them just that inspiration it overshadow all the wrong that they have done because there was a China that God who breathed through them and it could do things to be a blessing to mankind where banishes men and women brothers sister let me tell you people who amount to anything and will amount to anything in this church amount to anything in the generation to come its men and women who stand on God's Word and call everything as sinking sand on Christ the solid rock I stand Caleb said we are more than able to take it no matter what the opposition is young people we are more than able this is our generation this is our time no matter what the word says what a thing we are more than able to stand for God in this age let's see an increase righteousness were also increase in us God would give us grace God says so so let's go and get it you'll find out they were their only tool of that generation that God to go over I don't care what the church says what the neighbor says what this is and what that says let take God at His Word and let's stay right on it God is obligated to take care of us he's obligated because God will keep his word the inspiration of the Almighty the inspiration of the Almighty Lord just breathe upon me today that can be an encouragement to somebody now even knowing who the person is going to be but you just want that breath of God not to be able to me the opportunity when it presents itself because we meet people we see people we get in our self-righteous jacket Pepa strain perfect weakness he says there is so many of us like to testify or like to think that we are insufficient we think we need to get to the set in place before we can really be able to live for God he says therefore we make an excuse I have no education I have no ability I'm unable to do this and if you keep that up and do that in that way keep going like that then you cannot amount to anything as a little boy I used to like seeing the lasers we used to have lasers all over the trees over the house you know they climb up and trying to run up the tree that goes I'm going to come down on the ground they knocked himself on the ground they shake their head I can do it you always shake their heads like this and tell this I can do it they encouraged himself and they go back again when it comes slam on the ground say yes I can do it I'm going to do it praise the Lord my new ministry he says you don't have to be rich Almighty in this word to get to be great in the sight of God you don't have to be humble in your heart and God called that greatness he that great enough to Humble himself that's a great person takes the blame for everything that will humble himself he says that is greatness and as you read this you find many places where Berta Bram talks about standing alone with the word of God and and sometimes that has giving people an hour again attitude where they think they can stand alone no man can stand alone and survive you have to read and understand the context in which brother Branham is talking standing with the word of God it has made people to separate himself from the body of Christ stay in your own home and they think that he can they can stand alone with God when you do like that the devil makes everybody around you wrong honor you right it makes you to find fault in every home I met you to find fault in every Church well Roberto Sam I must stand alone with God's Word I'm standing alone with God's Word praise the Lord I love you this he said this also in Jehovah Jireh he said Abraham talking about Abraham he went back and got his old son he loved God better then he loved his own son listening to this now he says brother if you were ever amount to anything you have got to love God better than your wife then your husband praise the Lord if you take but if you take that expression in an exclusive tot you would destroy yourself you would destroy your family because you cannot love God better until you love your wife you love your husband you love your children without condition so a better Balaam saying you must love God better than your wife and you start this passing your were thinking that you are loving God better you would destroy yourself you would destroy your family Lavagirl better than your wife is to love her with our condition is to love your children with our condition love your husband with our condition then you are loving God better than loving your husband because if you love your husband or your wife with condition it will limit you on loving God and keeping God's Word the inspiration of the Almighty that's why I give wisdom when God breathed his word he opened our understanding open our spirit for all to get out of being critical and criticizing people and just- we just take our spirit that God can die even breathe through us living dead because we are just we are just credit card of of everybody criticize everything nothing is right the whole world is burning it's only where we are standing that's that's that's the only place that is secure knowing God better than your wife is to love her with our condition is to be able to look beyond all her faults and still love her loving God better than your husband is to do the same the love of God will come right in here and be able to support the children that's loving God better than your children because it is if it is only for them you will not do what you are doing but you love God so you have to do it that's the love of God the inspiration of the Almighty give it wisdom when God found their little channel in you he found that little hunger in your heart he found our little earnest in your heart he found a little desire to do right I know I'm not doing right but lord help me to do right I never get over this thing I'm better than this thing when you keep telling yourself that you are better than your weakness that you are better not to make excuses all the madam I've done my father all that my parents and not know that excuse is here you take responsibility for your actions and you tell yourself I'm better than this I can do better than what I'm doing and go we'll just find that channel that's what he's looking for in the heart of man he's looking for the channel that he can breathe true to make you a better wife he's looking for the channel he can breathe true to make you a better husband he's looking for that channel that he can breathe true to bring you in peace with the ones that you use just so hard for you to be in peace with you can't just find that channel he just briefed you and you say after all why would I was that's just taking this thinking my goodness you realized that you should have been enjoying the very thing that you were afraid of the inspiration of the Almighty God says let us make man in our image he was not just going to make something that he was not going to identify with he made something and he identified with and he put his life in it he breathed in man that is the best way to make anything it's for you to identify with faith and make a better husband you got to identify with him make it better wife you got to identify with her make a better Church you got to identify with it you don't sit on the porch and just look over like Balaam and criticize from yet and criticize from there to make anything better you got to identify with it all praise the Lord happy Father's Day anyway amen glory be to God look at this first Corinthian let's look in first Corinthians praise the law yeah whoa God is good he's so good he's a good card he's our father we love him he's our father we love Him praise the Lord let's just follow the Apostle Paul yet a little bein woo let's look from verse 23 let's enjoy the Word of God in a way that's why the Bible is ready for for us to read it and enjoy it let's just not pick a one verse and and build a taught around it let's enjoy the Word of God together amen praise the Lord my goodness if I don't take time here I might read a whole chapter to you because every burst I go so it looks so good to read verse 20 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this word have God not have not God made foolish the wisdom of this word he says and after that in the wisdom of God listen to this now in the wisdom of God this word by wisdom knew not god it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief for the Jews require sign a Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness amen o mine bar onto them wish I call Bob Jews Greek Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God the new birth is the power of God and the wisdom of God because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom because the foolishness of God is wiser than man the weakness of God is stronger than our strength hymn in praise the Lord for you for you see your calling see your calling see the people that God has risk of look at Daniel look at Gideon fearful your God come and look down upon him says yeah man Avella he looks away why are you talking to me so fearful Lori if it in reality you let it do you come on the wood God put it you did oh yeah it's do you okay now if it is you again leather do you go back up what was he what was he expressing the human fear that stopped us from seeing the real man that is in you the real son of God the real daughter of God that is behind our flesh your fear is stopping it you see your calling brethren how there are not many wise men after the flesh yes it's not wisdom after the flesh we are talking about now man I will go and do crafting invention just to make money they own it after their money but here they are using their invention to destroy families brick homes for marriages pollute the minds of young people that's not a kind of a wisdom we are talking about look him on yourself see the people that God is even using in your mess look at the one that God is using that's your husband ask your wife why should you prefer other people children than your be proud of your children they are your children be happy for them see the good things in their lives every other person whom is better than ours won't tell you start living in it and you know that they have the same pin on the wall that you have in yours it's not just painted with gold and silver see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble sigh call but God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things oh my goodness me Little Debbie whoever thought he would be the one his own own brothers they saw him coming out there said this other not aboard is coming here you better get away from me we are being trained in a military we find a place to hide you better get out of here call the security arrest him take him from here he's supposed to be taking care of ships the weak things of the world amen to conform the things that are mighty the best things the things which are despised have God's choosing we must be proud of ourselves to be sons and daughters of God if you have not attained to the career that you you dream to be the greatest calling is to be a son of God is to be a daughter of God when all is over and everything is done that's the where we going to stand before the father as the Son of God as a daughter of God that is the greatest calling that's the highest calling to be a child of the Living God not only to have the title but to know that you are and to be proud of it praise the Lord amen the things which are near to bring to another things which are no flesh should glory in his presence because it's not the working of any flesh is his strength that is made perfect in our weakness he went down and took us all from the ship card he took us from I mean every one of us have an ugly place we came from praise the Lord this is where I wanted to bring you out of this long row I was green but of him ie in Christ Jesus woo of God is made unto us wisdom Christ Jesus if I will say he grew in stature of men and wisdom Christ Jesus they want to be the Redeemer of the world God in the form of man he learned obedience by the things he suffer he didn't say I'm the God of the universe he got himself a train he was a carpenter he helped his momma Mary just been a time he was wisdom for us wisdom Christ Jesus made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption all was found in this man he was made all of these things for us he was despised so when you are despised you enough he saw hurt he was rejected when you are rejected you when I feel so hurt why you feel bad when you are disappointed you disappoint God all the time just reckon with faith he was made all of these things the inspiration of the Almighty put him in a body of flesh the inspiration of the Almighty made him toe to look at it I mean being there his own bourbon said when he got down there in the Garden of Gethsemane to just rock on at a place where he kneeled that he was going to be crucified it never came so easy it's not my will but your will be done never came so easy where bam says all the shadow of death was over his head Noorie him been innocent to take the place of the guilty he was in a boarding sometimes that's a reason why we struggle with this thing we don't want for people to talk bad about it's all because of this flesh this flesh has a sense of pride it's a seed proud make this flesh to fall it's there that's why he prayed that's why he prayed it was not just uneasy surrounding not my will let your will be done it was not easy he had to pray until he sweat as brother branham said he pray the scripture said he pray in agony oh god help me that's the reason why we we don't just dancing triose because the flesh don't want it the spirit knows that Trier is going to be a character for you but this flesh just don't want it lazy it's just one is so easy you even give it easy it one more easier the inspiration of the Almighty when we going through tough time when we're going through things that we don't understand that inspiration of the Almighty is what owe us that's what horrors from within it's the breath of God is the life of God great man and I always wise successful husband they were not just born to be husband you know smart and going to be chosen no it's the inspiration they pray for their family when you see things in your wives they don't just shout and complain you dance you're you a dancer you're distance they they see those things they go only Annie's law help my wife I know she won't be a good woman successful mom do the same thing for their children they do the same thing for their husband because we all comes with this expectation but the inspiration of the almighty had us to surrender our expectation to him because no man can fulfill your expectation I can fulfill your expectation I can fulfill your expectation I mean for the past that you drag out a bear with me you just got a bear with me or just fire me but it's the inspiration of the almighty that hold us together as a church because your heart is desiring to see God in our mace and the heart of the preacher is also desiring to see God in the people that desire that we have God comes true there he breathed upon us we can be able to encourage one another we can be able to look over the flaws of one another that's the inspiration of the Almighty that give it wisdom because if the inspiration of the Almighty was not there we become so particular this is what we want and we start to tear one another apart and we start to criticize who be using our own teeth to dig our grave but when the inspiration of the Almighty come and come true the hunger in of our hearts come true the desire you just got to stay back listening a little bit and see how the inspiration of the Almighty have our assembling even with the music and the singing and everything that we have it was it was just a desire to praise God the people desiring to worship God is spirit any truth they'll bring new songs we sing it off beat we stay enjoyed praise the Lord as he singing a song trying to sing a song for us Elaine and brother Lord said no no no no no no no stop no no no no he says no no no no no we completely off it's a heart to help if I take offense in there and get my flesh in a way then it just keep God of the same it's a heart to help the inspiration of the Almighty he comes through that channel he just don't condemn everything you you have why because he knows that he depending on that ability that's what we're Brenham syria in a perfect straining perfect weakness I was reading the thing and I just got off it that's the same thing he's here here he said you say I have no ability I'm unable to do this and if you keep that up he says you are going if you keep there or keep going their way then you can amount to anything but the very thing that we make excuses but our weakness God use the very thing to tackle the job he will use that very thing that you making excuses off I'm not good I'm not ready he will use that very thing to keep you from trouble he don't want you to be a Hollywood star so he just gives you a special you're just peculiar special to him and you have to appreciate that because he's going to use that very thing to tackle the job to make the devil know like you are not just like if you're not going to for them you're not just going to back up on the word verbatim says that's what this bright God has designed her in this way in this age that's a very thing that God used to tackle the job he will for us to get to that condition so that he can use us he wait for you to get in there condition maybe that's the way he could get you humble maybe that's the way you could make me two less thing you're running too fast so he put you in that condition as a check he can use that and get the job done the inspiration of the almighty the inspiration of the Almighty look at brother Branham look at his life story a father that was a drunk he never came from the royal family a father that was a drunk never came from the Pentecostal home where they were praying all night mother a Catholic great men I'm not always wise they were now born with silver spoon there was a place that God phone India heart and he breath the breath of life in that place and wrote their name across history and I believe that he can find out same place in our hearts he can find that same place in our heart if we just get away from being critical get away from I was just self praising self-righteousness he said David I took you from the Sheep card and not giving you a name I'm giving you a name in Israel and even if your son's fail I'll never take that name off talk to you from a humble beginning I talked you from following sheep's he wrote David name in the heart of him man whose name I written in the heart of him go back and read their history I was reading about Geronimo his name's two out among the Indians but there was something that put his name dear the first time I said young man that he will see his tribe being abused our men came over from Mexico and run them over and burned there and burned their little town their little place they have I said young man he was just a young man they were gone away and when he came back their little village was burned the desire in his heart that I wish I would have been the one that was killed just for this whole village to live I wish I would have been the one that that inspiration took that young man over until and more on the others that's where his name came from that's that's worthy the frame came from because they ever saw that the passion that he had he will go away from the town and he was just cry he would cry he would cry he was fine it was almost like he was he was going mad he was lost in its life because they killed his mother it was that thing it was nothing you know that Geronimo went to church oh yeah history tells he went to church and when he started going to church he started appreciating because there that that name that give him they feel like it was the spirit of the Gods that have come upon that young man because he didn't care for his life so him it was better for him to die than to see his people suffering so when he went for a walk he threw his all into it sometimes he came back wounded but he had a spirit to go they will advise him not to go he were conspiring two to three of his friends they were escaped they will go back to war that spirit in him they just felt like it was it was a spirit of the god stop taking flesh and morning it was just that China just like shim guy he was not a warrior never knew nothing about war but when that place opening is harder I'd rather die than to see the Philistines running over my people God just drop right in there it's the heart it's the heart just opening our heart to the Lord breathe through me breathe upon me the inspiration of the Almighty even students in school just open your heart well you know I'm learning helped me to understand my you know whatever I'm steadying and in this career don't just want to read your textbook and the thing that gave you to go and find other books you want to be a nurse farm books and read about nursing how it was in the inner cities just get yourself familiar I mean just create that atmosphere around yourself that's why learning is it's not your go and read the text the teachers today the exam is coming from this and you stay up all night just trying to put everything down through your head create the atmosphere when the apples here is created God will always come true in the time of need he will always come true in the time of need he was come true the light was shine through the inspiration of the Almighty that's what gives wisdom even I in your job if you just open your heart to be helpful not just not just to just get the eight hours going quickly and just get out of there but you call the the heart you have by the way I was talking to sister Berthe yesterday morning and she was telling in the the lady who children she was taking care of the lady as well and and back to work and she's a nurse and she's back to work and I mean she was just giving me with the wonderful testimonial about how the law was gracious to her and remember this is a Muslim family they surrounded the whole house to her she's she's now they're praying like some kind of prison law you know and she's I mean the man so scared to death he can't even give his water wife - I mean give his wife water to drink so scared to death because she's she's I mean half coronavirus but she steps in taking care of the children feeding the woman taking care of the woman praying along with her and God in His mercy came down now she's back to work the inspiration there had to help the heart to be a channel that God can breathe true that's the inspiration of the Almighty they give it all wisdom has to take care of our fine eyes we need wisdom has to take care of our home our family we need God's wisdom the inspiration of the almighty the Lord bless you let's bow our hats together great men and now always wise they were not born with greatness they were trying their best and great day has got ahold of them because greatness comes from God bruschetta can we just see how great they are how great their I'm not saying you were great I'm saying he's great I also wonder on say the oh the world thy hands have made I see the stars

just wave true the singing and through the gift and people would just be captured to the simple messages of repentance that Billy Graham will bring think about even man like Billy Graham how he rose up to greatness he had a frame someone that was like his mentor and this person came to the place they could not understand why the Jews were suffering him and decided to troll the tower in and throw their Bible down venogram as a young man he struggled he struggle because he couldn't understand it but he just had that china open and he says I know that there is a God I don't understand why but I know that there is a God and because he kept that China open God came through there god bless him and God rose him up to greatness you might not understand what is happening in your life I don't have explanation for some of those things I just want to try by the grace of God to point you to cavalry 20 you to a Finnish word to a God that is in control that has never lost control of his University it's up to you for you to open your heart and open that channel and just surrounded and say God yeah I am you don't have to make excuses and so while I'm not married or that that's the reason why no every time you feel God you tell yourself I can do better than this challenge yourself that you can do better than this and hold yourself responsible don't look for an excuse don't look for anybody hold yourself responsible and says I'm I'm the I'm the reason but I can do better than this because I serve a great god and it's written in his word greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world that's all God is looking for he's just looking for that China he's just looking for that China lord I want to be a better husband he's looking for that China if you just opened that China and says that to him every morning god I want to be a better husband make me a great dad make me make me a good man make me a son of God and when your heart is truth about it God will honor that he would come true that he will breathe through their Lord I want to be a better wife I want to be a daughter of God I want to be a daughter of God you you can make yourself one by just stuffing things in your

the inspiration of the Almighty look at the birds and said God how great I doubt that those birds can just fly in the heavens they're not even afraid that they can fall to the ground look at the
