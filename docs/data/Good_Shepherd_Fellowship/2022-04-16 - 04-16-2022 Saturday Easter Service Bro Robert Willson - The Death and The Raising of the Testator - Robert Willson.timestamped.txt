[33:51] of the evening and just fellowship and
[33:54] rejoice around the world amen
[33:57] praise the lord
[34:00] you know when we when we have these uh
[34:03] meetings
[34:05] you know uh
[34:08] it's it's it's always for the purpose
[34:10] it's not uh
[34:11] uh we know that it's it's uh easter
[34:14] weekend
[34:15] and it's all about
[34:17] celebrating the resurrection
[34:20] you know but it is not
[34:23] to be after
[34:24] that
[34:26] uh their tradition you know the
[34:28] tradition of just going through the
[34:31] normal routine of talking about
[34:34] the the steps to the cross and talking
[34:36] about
[34:38] cavalry the price that he paid i think
[34:40] it's something that we deal with every
[34:42] day in our lives
[34:44] praise the lord
[34:46] and
[34:47] we had a uh
[34:49] a thought on our heart
[34:51] to be able to
[34:54] that god will
[34:55] we use this uh
[34:58] uh
[34:59] these meetings
[35:01] to be able to inspire us in a different
[35:03] way just like i spoke last night you
[35:06] know god uh
[35:09] moving us in the direction of a church
[35:11] that is that is burden to pray
[35:14] you know spending time to pray the
[35:16] church under the inspiration of the
[35:18] almighty then
[35:20] and
[35:20] [Music]
[35:23] but when i taught to to have brother
[35:25] wilson come to be with us what actually
[35:28] was on my mind was was missions
[35:30] i'll share with you a little bit what
[35:32] was on my mind
[35:34] uh the technicians are putting some few
[35:36] things together that brother wilson will
[35:38] share with us before he gets into the
[35:41] message tonight so they will not put the
[35:43] scripture that i want to read up to you
[35:45] but uh just listening is from the word
[35:47] of god i promise you i won't read
[35:49] anything that is not from the word of
[35:50] god amen
[35:52] so you just got to believe me even if
[35:53] it's not up
[35:54] believe that it's from the word of god
[36:00] praise the lord
[36:01] i will read from verse 13
[36:04] romans chapter 10 from verse 20. the
[36:07] bible says for whosoever shall call upon
[36:09] the name of the lord shall be saved
[36:12] how then shall they call on him
[36:16] in whom they have not believed
[36:19] and how shall they believe in him of
[36:22] whom
[36:23] they have not heard
[36:25] and how shall they year
[36:28] without a preacher
[36:30] and how shall they preach except they be
[36:34] sent
[36:35] that's just one of my favorite
[36:37] missionary scripture that i love
[36:39] as it is written how beautiful
[36:43] are the feet of them that preach
[36:46] the gospel of peace
[36:48] and bring glad tidings
[36:51] of good news
[36:52] [Music]
[36:55] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[36:58] for for as i have said
[37:01] lord who have believed our report
[37:05] so then faith coming by hearing and
[37:08] hearing by the word of god amen
[37:12] praise the lord
[37:13] so one of the the
[37:15] burden that i had on my heart for for
[37:17] this
[37:19] weekend services
[37:21] you know that god will just stir
[37:23] something in our heart
[37:25] you know to be a witness
[37:29] praise the lord
[37:32] we all
[37:33] as believers
[37:35] [Music]
[37:36] we are just like uh
[37:41] you know uh uh
[37:43] we played a different role of of of
[37:46] barabas
[37:48] we played a different role of palette
[37:50] having the blood
[37:52] you know barabbas being the one that was
[37:54] guilted and should have died
[37:56] that was that was us by sin by our first
[37:59] birth we were guilty and we should have
[38:01] died
[38:03] and and there is one that took our place
[38:07] and and and we played the role of of of
[38:10] peter being the denier
[38:12] so you see all the all the
[38:14] characteristics go allow
[38:17] different characteristics in that moment
[38:20] of someone betraying him or someone you
[38:22] know being the one that should have died
[38:24] and someone that had the blood on his
[38:26] hands which is pilot
[38:28] and
[38:29] knowing that this man was now walter of
[38:32] death but yet
[38:35] he tried to please the people and and
[38:38] and we come through those different
[38:40] roles in our life
[38:42] praise the lord
[38:43] and i will say that as we have received
[38:46] the lord jesus as our lord and savior
[38:49] uh we don't only have his blood on our
[38:51] hands we have
[38:53] his life on our hands
[38:55] the reason why he saved us and have
[38:58] given us this grace to be here is for us
[39:01] to be a bearer of his life the reason of
[39:03] the holy ghost is for us to carry his
[39:06] life to the world
[39:08] praise the lord
[39:12] so i was thinking about
[39:14] this weekend and thinking about what to
[39:16] do
[39:17] and then as i was praying for the
[39:18] services and we should look a little bit
[39:21] towards missions
[39:23] you know missionary we think about
[39:25] missions and missionary
[39:27] our mind goes to overseas
[39:30] but we can be missionary right in our
[39:32] backyard
[39:34] we can be missionaries in a grocery
[39:36] center
[39:37] we can be missionaries i mean right on
[39:40] the street corner to our friends to our
[39:42] loved ones
[39:45] praise the lord
[39:46] so uh uh tonight brother brad wilson
[39:49] will come you you wanted to do a little
[39:52] bit of
[39:55] bringing us into that mindset of some of
[39:57] the work that he's involving is this is
[39:59] this should be over
[40:01] about uh 20 plus years
[40:04] and uh that he's been out there on the
[40:06] field
[40:07] as a missionary
[40:09] and uh
[40:10] and and and the beautiful thing about it
[40:12] that he's uh a self-supported missionary
[40:16] you know so which means he used his own
[40:19] income and and and
[40:22] the house money the groceries money he
[40:25] have to cut it down you know the the
[40:28] uh you know uh money that he's supposed
[40:30] to buy things for his children he got to
[40:32] reduce it because his mind is is going
[40:35] out there he prints sometimes print his
[40:37] own material to take it out to missions
[40:40] and buy material from voice of god and
[40:42] and different things
[40:44] you know
[40:47] yeah
[40:49] when i had the privilege to be down
[40:50] there to visit him and
[40:52] went down and into his uh
[40:55] mission setting in the basement of his
[40:57] house
[40:58] uh
[40:58] yeah i was i was i was impressed
[41:01] to see the
[41:03] what a burden would do to a man when you
[41:06] have a burden
[41:08] it will change your appetite
[41:11] when you have a burden
[41:13] it will change your appetite a burden
[41:16] change the way you dress
[41:18] because you are not focused in class and
[41:20] brand name
[41:22] you just want to cover your nakedness
[41:23] and get out into the street
[41:25] praise the lord
[41:27] amen
[41:28] a burden will change a lot of things in
[41:31] your life
[41:32] when god put a burden on your heart
[41:36] and the beautiful thing about it there
[41:37] is that a god show through the scripture
[41:40] uh sami or just just a little boy maybe
[41:42] three years old god started giving him a
[41:44] burden from from a dream and and god
[41:47] started calling him you know so uh there
[41:50] is no heart that is too young for god to
[41:52] burden and there is no heart that is too
[41:55] old for god to burden
[41:57] [Music]
[41:59] we just have to make ourselves available
[42:03] praise the lord
[42:04] amen
[42:06] and you know the beautiful thing
[42:08] is only the things that are done for god
[42:10] that's why we'll be remembered on the
[42:12] other
[42:13] [Music]
[42:14] side only the things that are done for
[42:17] god and the things that we do for his
[42:19] people
[42:21] amen
[42:22] now we need the ones in church with us
[42:25] not only the ones you know
[42:28] uh uh uh i mean his people the bible
[42:30] says he's been good to the sons of man
[42:33] you know when david says that in the
[42:35] psalm he means even the ones that are
[42:38] not safe
[42:39] even the ones that are not serving god
[42:41] god is still being good to them
[42:44] praise the lord if god can pull the rain
[42:47] upon the just and unjust
[42:49] he pulled the rain upon the just and
[42:51] unjust why should i hold a bottle of
[42:53] water
[42:55] from from a just or from our unjust
[43:00] praise the lord
[43:01] so
[43:03] we will call
[43:04] brother wilson
[43:06] and then he will come in and be able to
[43:09] are you ready back there okay praise the
[43:11] lord we also have uh his uh his
[43:14] missionary partner and son joseph with
[43:16] us
[43:19] amen he had all his all his boys and
[43:22] girls
[43:23] being part of what he's doing his wife
[43:25] as a as a missionary partner also
[43:30] praise the lord after after the fourth
[43:32] washing last night he was telling me
[43:34] about a foot watching service there in
[43:36] uh i think uh bocanna faso somewhere
[43:38] there in the village where they just use
[43:40] just one bucket for everybody both men
[43:43] and women
[43:45] amen
[43:46] and it gets deathed just like our scene
[43:48] is daddy
[43:51] [Music]
[43:56] i have a little story about uh about
[43:59] data water and and being safe i will
[44:02] tell you another time that tonight
[44:05] praise the lord well i just stand on our
[44:07] feet and we sing a song here and then
[44:09] brother brother wilson would come
[44:15] fill my way with love i think that's why
[44:17] the musicians
[44:30] every day
[44:44] oh
[44:46] [Music]
[45:02] fear
[45:13] every day with
[45:17] [Music]
[45:25] [Music]
[45:30] oh
[45:46] amen
[45:47] god bless you tonight
[45:49] i'll have you sit down for a few minutes
[45:51] i
[45:54] i just got nervous being back there i'm
[45:56] glad i'm here finally
[46:00] what we want to do
[46:01] you know when you come to the house of
[46:03] god many times
[46:05] my
[46:07] burden is
[46:09] we are so close to going home
[46:12] i want to challenge you this might not
[46:14] happen again right
[46:16] you know so when i get the opportunity i
[46:18] want to
[46:19] not take it that is the last day it's
[46:21] the last time
[46:23] so
[46:24] it's a burden on me that if god ever
[46:26] wanted to tell you something if you are
[46:28] going to die tomorrow and god wanted to
[46:30] tell you something what will he tell you
[46:32] so
[46:33] bear with me but
[46:35] our life
[46:36] points to where we are going
[46:38] where your treasure is
[46:42] so
[46:43] if we really believe the message we
[46:45] really are christians
[46:47] nobody has to convince us
[46:49] what we have to do
[46:51] if that has to come in then
[46:53] something hasn't clicked
[46:54] so i pray that tonight
[46:57] the holy ghost will bring something to
[46:59] your attention
[47:00] you've never paid attention to before
[47:04] and then when we leave here
[47:06] we'll never be the same
[47:10] some doubts will go
[47:12] some spooky things will leave
[47:14] sickness will leave
[47:16] evil spirits will disappear
[47:18] our lives will be a little bit stable
[47:20] and a little bit straight
[47:22] because the distractions are too much
[47:24] too many
[47:26] too many
[47:27] and so
[47:29] i want to kind of
[47:31] talk to you about a little bit 15
[47:33] minutes so
[47:35] it's going to be quickly quick and short
[47:38] on about some mission work
[47:40] but i find that
[47:42] everybody has a different idea of what a
[47:44] mission work is
[47:45] sometimes you want to go to africa
[47:47] sometimes you want to bring people here
[47:49] and it's part of mission work and
[47:51] there's nothing wrong with it
[47:52] but
[47:55] we should really focus on what will
[47:58] bring
[47:59] people to christ
[48:01] because the last one is out there
[48:05] i don't know it could be in this room
[48:07] still but the last one is out there so
[48:09] we got to reach out the out one whether
[48:10] here africa or everywhere so i find that
[48:14] my focus is
[48:16] reaching out to the last one
[48:18] in my prayer every day is lord some way
[48:20] somehow
[48:21] let my effort influence the last one to
[48:23] come in
[48:24] because if he doesn't come in we are not
[48:26] going
[48:29] and somewhere brahms said he might be a
[48:32] black man so sometimes when i'm walking
[48:34] in africa i'm wondering is this this one
[48:38] or it could be here right so
[48:40] we all go with the quotes it's a little
[48:42] bit of our
[48:43] guideline
[48:45] so
[48:46] tonight i think it's we've been talking
[48:49] about when i could come and all that god
[48:51] allowed that to be tonight
[48:53] and i'm glad to have the audience here
[48:56] so what i want to tell you is about
[48:59] a tool
[49:00] that we use for
[49:03] missions and i'm going to spend i said
[49:05] 15 minutes some of you might have seen
[49:07] it some of you might not but what i want
[49:10] to do is to give you a little bit of
[49:12] update of
[49:15] of what i wanted to tell you
[49:18] um
[49:19] okay so they got
[49:21] something on the on this is not it
[49:23] they will get it up there
[49:25] um
[49:29] easter time is
[49:31] a good thing
[49:33] because it reminds us of
[49:36] what really god has in mind
[49:39] i've learned that
[49:41] the beginning it's not as important as
[49:44] the end
[49:46] i i've raised kids and i look at some of
[49:48] them and i know this one is a true one
[49:50] is going to heaven
[49:52] give me a couple of months and i'm not
[49:53] sure
[49:57] and then it comes to myself there are
[49:58] times i wake up and i said today it's
[50:01] all good
[50:02] the next day
[50:03] i'm not sure whether
[50:05] i belong but it's by faith that
[50:08] we can also rest on god so easter is a
[50:11] reminder
[50:13] if you don't get anything tonight
[50:15] your fair has been paid
[50:19] everything
[50:20] that you need for this journey has been
[50:22] paid for
[50:25] you know you go to lunch and somebody
[50:26] has paid for the food what do you do
[50:28] you eat you can't walk yes
[50:31] so you always have to soak in and say
[50:33] lord if you pay for it let me see that
[50:36] can you have the
[50:38] update i just wanted to talk about this
[50:40] they are still trying to load it
[50:42] the update
[50:44] so what happened was that about 20 years
[50:46] ago you know i came in a message way
[50:48] back in africa
[50:50] yeah so about 20 years ago just looking
[50:53] at my kids they
[50:54] want to get on the internet
[50:56] and all that and i said well
[50:58] i'm not buying internet in the house
[50:59] unless
[51:00] you're going to use it for
[51:02] something for the message so that's
[51:04] where the whole thing started
[51:06] and for a while
[51:08] we thought about making a tool because
[51:10] those days the tapes were just on
[51:12] cassette tapes and you got to carry
[51:14] so 20 years ago we started got my
[51:17] basement got internet and then we
[51:19] decided to develop a tool something that
[51:22] will help
[51:23] in the propagation of the gospel
[51:26] and this tool was not made for
[51:28] message believers
[51:30] it's just made for every christian
[51:33] it's on their website and also in an app
[51:37] and my thought was it has to be free
[51:40] because the gospel is free
[51:42] you don't buy something and use it
[51:45] to bring it
[51:46] so if you go to the next page i'm going
[51:48] to go fast here
[51:50] my thought
[51:52] even today is that we've been put in
[51:54] trust with this message
[51:56] and if it's just a matter of listening
[51:57] to another tape and another tip or
[51:59] another tip we are not doing much with
[52:01] it
[52:03] and then if we believe it
[52:04] that is the truth
[52:06] then we have to put everything in it
[52:08] so
[52:10] i put my everything in it
[52:12] i have not regretted it
[52:14] i have put everything everything
[52:17] you have to believe me everything in it
[52:20] so every time i thought this lord
[52:23] let me do something
[52:25] to further this gospel
[52:28] every day
[52:29] and
[52:30] i see it every day that it's god's
[52:32] blessing that courage me i'm nobody
[52:35] and you might not find me on youtube or
[52:38] facebook or anything because i work
[52:39] under the radar
[52:41] because some places i go are very
[52:43] dangerous i don't even like many of the
[52:45] things with my photos anywhere
[52:47] so you have to get close to know
[52:49] the little things that we are doing and
[52:51] god blesses it can we go we're going to
[52:53] go fast now now so
[52:55] our focus has been to
[52:57] provide the free access
[52:59] and we also
[53:00] one thing i'll show you quickly is how
[53:02] we cross-reference the message with the
[53:04] bible because many times you are talking
[53:06] to an unbeliever
[53:07] you want to quote the message
[53:09] they don't even know christ how are you
[53:10] going to call the message
[53:12] so it's nice to take the same scripture
[53:15] and explain it the way abraham explained
[53:17] it
[53:18] so when you take the message it links
[53:20] you to a scripture and vice versa and
[53:22] then
[53:23] we spend a lot of money and time
[53:26] spending sending bibles and message
[53:28] books
[53:30] and then we do message missionary trips
[53:32] as the lord provides
[53:35] for the 20 years
[53:37] it's just god's grace that we've made it
[53:39] to many many countries
[53:41] and i usually go to where there are no
[53:42] message churches
[53:45] because i don't go for an offering
[53:47] i don't go for somebody to park my back
[53:50] but i go to lay ground work
[53:52] if somebody will build on it it's the
[53:54] same thing if not god will honor it
[53:58] so this is the website if you haven't
[53:59] been there
[54:01] probably one of these days you can go
[54:02] there
[54:04] we can go to the website just to show
[54:06] one little thing
[54:09] my son back there he was so i did this
[54:11] with my kids so his 20th anniversary uh
[54:14] the first i want to show is
[54:17] the message so if you go to so if you go
[54:19] to the website
[54:20] this is
[54:22] and then let's say put rapture in the
[54:26] rapture in there so all the message
[54:28] books
[54:29] are there
[54:32] you can click on
[54:33] booklet
[54:37] so voice of god has stopped printing i i
[54:40] can tell you i've bought probably about
[54:42] the last batch of all the print it's in
[54:44] my basement
[54:46] and i give it out
[54:47] so
[54:48] i just thought if i need books and it's
[54:50] not being printed where am i going to
[54:51] get it so it's on the website
[54:54] if you go there you can it's in pdf you
[54:56] can print it i don't own copyright i
[54:59] just said you know we are just
[55:00] distributing this
[55:02] the nice thing is that you could see
[55:04] that we've also linked the bible verses
[55:05] to it so when you take it you say where
[55:07] did bubram get this from
[55:09] you can be linked with that so that's so
[55:12] important because many times oh i want
[55:14] some message books you got a tablet you
[55:17] got the what they call it in voice of
[55:19] god
[55:20] the table is
[55:21] very good but there are times
[55:24] i don't want to start telling you
[55:25] stories but
[55:26] over there people sometimes don't have
[55:28] toilet paper and they go to a toilet
[55:30] room and there's a sheet of paper
[55:33] so people read the books in different
[55:35] places
[55:36] and
[55:38] it's nice to have the book so that's
[55:39] what i want to show you but you can go
[55:41] there and explore to yourself
[55:43] let's go to the next one that i
[55:46] um just explore it at the website okay
[55:50] where are we now
[55:55] uh we can skip this one and go to the
[56:00] okay so this website 20th anniversary if
[56:03] you go there we have laid all the things
[56:06] we started doing from that time
[56:08] if you go all the way down
[56:12] my 15 minutes is almost up
[56:14] if you point to 21 it shows you the list
[56:17] of the things so the message is with
[56:19] index
[56:20] can you imagine take a paragraph and
[56:22] look for it in the bible
[56:25] if you ask me that's the job i do every
[56:27] day every day i allocate one two hours i
[56:30] say lord where did problem get this
[56:33] it's the same holy ghost
[56:35] the same holy ghost that gave him is
[56:37] able to also give it
[56:39] and i've indexed
[56:42] some people have helped all the way i'm
[56:43] left with five or six years
[56:46] almost every paragraph it's not
[56:48] everything that i find all the time but
[56:50] sometimes it takes a while so i wanted
[56:52] you to know if you go there you could
[56:54] see all the things that have been done
[56:56] um now let's go back to the charts i
[56:59] think there was something else quickly
[57:01] my 15 minutes is up
[57:03] let's go back to the powerpoint
[57:07] i'm conscious of the time so where were
[57:09] we now uh okay so keep go to the next
[57:11] one
[57:14] so this is my basement
[57:16] i have a lot of books a lot of tapes
[57:20] and we pack and mail them
[57:22] so we mail with the bibles so if you
[57:24] ever get tired or don't know what to do
[57:27] just come over
[57:30] we park some books we pray over them
[57:33] and last last year a family from
[57:35] arkansas drove all the way from arkansas
[57:37] we spent two days
[57:39] to park books
[57:40] the day and then the next day they
[57:42] stayed keep going
[57:44] so these are the boxes ready to go
[57:46] sometime i pack the boxes and it takes
[57:47] me a while because
[57:49] it used to be about 30 dollars to mail
[57:51] it anywhere
[57:52] especially overseas but now it takes
[57:54] over 250 between 250 and 300. for me the
[57:57] hardest part is it gets there they don't
[57:59] claim it and it gets returned then i got
[58:00] to pay it again but god knows what he's
[58:03] doing so you could probably identify
[58:05] people this is book parking
[58:07] i'm sure you know
[58:08] do you know anybody in the photo
[58:11] you don't know anyone bred your smith
[58:13] somebody says bro john smith yeah he's
[58:15] part of it so these are the places that
[58:18] we spent we sent books even in u.s
[58:21] and mainly to new churches that are
[58:23] starting
[58:25] yeah keep going quickly
[58:28] so this is my basement if you come there
[58:29] we have
[58:31] computers we built ourselves with my
[58:35] uh kids
[58:35] studied computer science and hardware
[58:37] and i was always thinking where am i
[58:39] going to apply
[58:41] so we build all these computers
[58:42] ourselves we can go further
[58:45] and
[58:46] build the basement ourselves we
[58:48] learned how to do the wall the drywall
[58:51] and all that i'm almost done
[58:54] so these are the computers i won't have
[58:55] time to go over that so let's go back
[58:57] yeah go for it so now if you have the
[59:00] app store you can go to the app store
[59:03] lwb mobile
[59:05] uh where are we not no just
[59:07] okay so
[59:09] keep keep it there i want to say
[59:11] something okay
[59:15] okay
[59:16] now
[59:17] the mouse technology no we are not there
[59:19] yet but okay
[59:21] just just this one i want to say
[59:23] something on it before thank you
[59:25] okay so
[59:28] we have about seven languages that this
[59:30] app is in so if you are in
[59:34] holland or germany you download it it
[59:36] will all be in german
[59:38] and
[59:40] you can find in your app store or even
[59:42] on your windows computer
[59:45] so this is different from the website
[59:47] because now everybody has it on their
[59:48] phone
[59:49] and
[59:50] it will be also in the browser so
[59:53] if you have that app
[59:55] you have to explore it can we show the
[59:57] app just for a minute and then we are
[59:59] almost done
[1:00:01] so this is the app
[1:00:04] if you see the left
[1:00:05] top left
[1:00:07] there's the bible
[1:00:08] yeah that brings the menu so you see the
[1:00:10] bible
[1:00:12] yeah click on the bible
[1:00:15] now down here
[1:00:16] you could see select wnb and strong
[1:00:19] select you can copy it and put in your
[1:00:20] sermon
[1:00:24] if you go to wmb
[1:00:27] so if you watch it
[1:00:30] all the paragraphs that are linked
[1:00:32] uh
[1:00:33] it shows the quotes down there
[1:00:37] so every not every bible verse
[1:00:41] is linked most of them
[1:00:43] then you go to strong's also it gives
[1:00:45] you the concordance with it right there
[1:00:48] so you can
[1:00:49] put it under any of the words
[1:00:52] and it shows you
[1:00:54] the concordance right there so right in
[1:00:56] your hand
[1:00:57] you don't have an excuse this is the
[1:00:59] tree of life
[1:01:02] you know but there are a lot of things
[1:01:04] on your phone that you could do but if
[1:01:06] you are sitting at the train station or
[1:01:08] tired or something here is the message
[1:01:10] for you
[1:01:11] and if you go back to the the menu again
[1:01:16] the top there is always the menu there
[1:01:17] are so many things
[1:01:19] that you could do from it
[1:01:21] so many things
[1:01:23] there's videos there's different things
[1:01:25] i'll leave it so that you can explore
[1:01:27] let's quickly go because my time is up
[1:01:29] two more minutes
[1:01:31] go back to the presentation
[1:01:35] it will have been harder for you to grow
[1:01:36] up in a wilson household because
[1:01:41] they learn quickly that they have to be
[1:01:43] part of everything i do
[1:01:45] so let's keep going so you can download
[1:01:47] almost everything on the website
[1:01:49] keep going keep going uh
[1:01:52] yeah just keep going this is all the app
[1:01:54] we've done the quick demo keep going and
[1:01:56] let's start keep going i'll just show
[1:01:58] you keep going keep going keep going
[1:02:00] keep going okay so here you look at it
[1:02:03] and say
[1:02:04] so all this website and the app is it
[1:02:06] even useful if you look at the first
[1:02:08] line
[1:02:10] almost half a billion
[1:02:11] people have been to this website
[1:02:14] it's very very very popular there are
[1:02:16] many times i get emails for
[1:02:18] churches voice of god and all that and i
[1:02:20] said this is not voice of god it's
[1:02:22] painful but
[1:02:23] this is different
[1:02:25] and the computers run in my basement
[1:02:27] some in the crowd
[1:02:30] you wouldn't know my light bill or
[1:02:32] how much
[1:02:34] tea ones i bring in my basement so we
[1:02:36] can play
[1:02:38] and then also we have listeners so many
[1:02:40] people come and listen to the messages
[1:02:42] and we track them
[1:02:44] but all that we are doing here is that
[1:02:48] if there is a world there is a purpose
[1:02:49] in your heart god somehow provides for
[1:02:51] it yes and we've done this for 20 years
[1:02:54] i'm not here to appeal for money
[1:02:56] i've returned so many money back to the
[1:02:59] pastors where their congregation but i
[1:03:01] wanted you to know that you could do
[1:03:03] something
[1:03:04] for this message
[1:03:06] just pulling message from the table and
[1:03:08] listening to it is not enough
[1:03:11] if it does something in your life you
[1:03:12] see that like the woman at the well she
[1:03:15] run
[1:03:16] for god that woman shouldn't preach
[1:03:20] when it hits you you forget who you are
[1:03:22] and the bible says that's right the
[1:03:24] bible says he preached in samaria
[1:03:27] come see a man
[1:03:29] it's a testimony of my life
[1:03:31] and here bebraham says she laid for the
[1:03:33] foundation for philip to go there a
[1:03:35] couple of years later and have a revival
[1:03:39] so
[1:03:40] the little testimony we give to our
[1:03:42] neighbor who knows what god will build
[1:03:44] on it
[1:03:44] so
[1:03:45] this is
[1:03:47] our 20 years of operation and you could
[1:03:49] see almost
[1:03:51] every country almost in the world

[1:03:55] so if you haven't downloaded it it's a
[1:03:57] resource for you to use to witness

[1:04:01] that oh where is this message where can
[1:04:03] i find it it's in there we have a search
[1:04:06] program we have everything there so
[1:04:09] when he wanted me to come i could tell
[1:04:11] you stories about
[1:04:13] going to gambia going to some of the
[1:04:14] places
[1:04:15] they are ticklish they enjoy oh this
[1:04:17] brother but
[1:04:19] you got to get to a point where you are
[1:04:21] not telling a story but it's a life that
[1:04:23] you are living
[1:04:25] and when you live that life
[1:04:27] it speaks louder than what you can say
[1:04:33] so we're going to sing alas

[1:08:25] because we only see you at the cross

[1:08:33] holy spirit in our hearts

[1:08:41] and may we receive from you
[1:08:44] take over my thoughts my words my

[1:08:51] can do
[1:08:52] and everyone here that's all we can do
[1:08:55] may we live here better than we came in
[1:08:58] may we leave our burdens here
[1:09:00] may you open our eyes a little bit more
[1:09:02] may the holy ghost come and minister to
[1:09:04] us individually we thank you
[1:09:07] that you've done it already
[1:09:09] just help us to have faith to receive
[1:09:12] from you
[1:09:13] in your name we pray
[1:09:14] amen amen amen amen amen god bless you
[1:09:19] i'm going to watch the time so bear with
[1:09:22] me let's
[1:09:23] go straight to the
[1:09:25] word and
[1:09:26] if you have your bibles
[1:09:28] we
[1:09:29] i got some slides that we're going to
[1:09:31] use also
[1:09:32] because i want you to
[1:09:34] leave here with something
[1:09:36] and
[1:09:38] i'm somebody that
[1:09:40] tries to be very sensitive to the spirit
[1:09:42] of god
[1:09:43] so it's hard to
[1:09:45] for me to even walk with myself i
[1:09:47] changed my mind many times
[1:09:50] yesterday i was sitting down and
[1:09:52] i thought i had what i'm going to
[1:09:55] talk about and then
[1:09:56] i came down and the pastor was
[1:09:59] saying something in the office
[1:10:01] and he confirmed some things and took
[1:10:03] some things out
[1:10:04] so
[1:10:05] we'll go to hebrews chapter nine
[1:10:08] it will it will come on the screen
[1:10:10] hebrews chapter nine and yesterday
[1:10:12] he's been
[1:10:14] you have a very solid pastor i respect
[1:10:16] him a lot
[1:10:18] and
[1:10:21] yesterday he was dealing with hebrews
[1:10:22] chapter 9 and 10.
[1:10:24] and i was cringing that he might take
[1:10:27] everything then i have to go to the
[1:10:28] drawing board but thank god the holy
[1:10:31] ghost reserves something for me
[1:10:34] you know you walk into somewhere and
[1:10:37] they don't know what you are thinking
[1:10:38] you don't know what they are thinking
[1:10:39] and they are preaching your notes
[1:10:42] and
[1:10:42] same quote so if it sounds repetitive
[1:10:46] forgive me
[1:10:48] um
[1:10:49] he didn't coach me i didn't coach him
[1:10:51] how many believe it's one holy ghost
[1:10:54] it's not two
[1:10:56] it's just who he will use
[1:10:58] and that's what we have to rely on so if
[1:11:00] you have your bibles in hebrews
[1:11:03] chapter 9.
[1:11:10] it's good i see that you all have bibles
[1:11:12] and
[1:11:13] it's good
[1:11:17] let me read just a couple of verses and
[1:11:19] we take a thought
[1:11:22] and for this course
[1:11:24] he that is christ is the mediator of the
[1:11:27] new testament
[1:11:30] and how is he a mediator
[1:11:31] by means of death
[1:11:35] for the redemption of the transgressions
[1:11:38] that were under the first testament
[1:11:41] they which are called might receive the
[1:11:43] promise of eternal inheritance
[1:11:48] verse 16 for where a testament is
[1:11:52] there must also be
[1:11:54] also of necessity be the death of a
[1:11:57] testator
[1:11:59] for a testament is of force after men
[1:12:02] are dead otherwise it is of no strength
[1:12:04] at all while the testator liveth
[1:12:08] whereupon neither the first testament
[1:12:10] was dedicated without blood
[1:12:12] verse 19
[1:12:13] for when moses had spoken every precept
[1:12:16] to all the people according to the law
[1:12:18] he took blood of calves and of goats
[1:12:20] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop
[1:12:23] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[1:12:26] people
[1:12:27] verse 20 says this is
[1:12:30] saying this is the blood of the
[1:12:32] testament which god has enjoined
[1:12:35] unto you and that word and joint it's a
[1:12:38] very
[1:12:40] precious word because
[1:12:42] it's like somebody does something
[1:12:44] and he did it for you yes
[1:12:46] you didn't even ask for it and said
[1:12:48] you've been enjoying to it it's like
[1:12:50] i've added you to something
[1:12:52] without asking your permission
[1:12:54] i decided to do that
[1:12:56] so we want to take a little thought and
[1:12:58] i'll let you sit down
[1:13:00] the next page
[1:13:04] they are getting the
[1:13:06] the death
[1:13:08] of the testator
[1:13:10] please sit down
[1:13:12] and the raising of the testator
[1:13:15] um
[1:13:17] the death
[1:13:20] as paul said
[1:13:25] where a testament is
[1:13:27] they must of necessity be the death of a
[1:13:31] testator
[1:13:33] i'm sure everybody in this room probably
[1:13:36] have lost a relative before how many
[1:13:38] have
[1:13:39] yes yes yes
[1:13:41] and the relative might not be rich
[1:13:45] if you are you have a rich
[1:13:46] relative sometimes it's enjoyable to
[1:13:48] know that
[1:13:50] they left something for you
[1:13:54] don't you agree
[1:13:55] nah you get nervous
[1:13:58] checking whether your name is in the
[1:14:00] in the world
[1:14:01] and if your name is not in the world
[1:14:02] somebody is going to be in trouble
[1:14:04] either the wife or somebody
[1:14:06] so
[1:14:07] paul being a lawyer is there anyone a
[1:14:09] lawyer here oh my goodness some of you
[1:14:12] young ones be a lawyer
[1:14:16] god chose a lawyer
[1:14:18] chose doctors
[1:14:21] because when we came in the message at
[1:14:22] first education everybody 18 we are
[1:14:25] going to heaven
[1:14:26] and this is what more than 60 years and
[1:14:29] we are still here
[1:14:31] continue planting your potatoes
[1:14:34] if you god has given you a gift to study
[1:14:37] study hard
[1:14:38] because god can use the same education
[1:14:42] to do something
[1:14:43] even at the university wherever you are
[1:14:45] god can do it yes i'm a i'm a i'm a
[1:14:48] witness of it raised all my kids and
[1:14:52] a lot of brothers were against it
[1:14:54] but
[1:14:55] never did i think i will live this long
[1:14:59] god is here because the last one hasn't
[1:15:01] come in so
[1:15:02] please use it so i might be talking
[1:15:05] about a little bit of law
[1:15:07] so one of you if you ever become a
[1:15:09] lawyer
[1:15:10] at least you can
[1:15:11] come back and straighten me out
[1:15:14] so we spend a little time to understand
[1:15:16] the law of the land
[1:15:18] see because these all these laws are
[1:15:20] derived from the bible
[1:15:22] and so if you read paul's writings he
[1:15:25] goes into the law
[1:15:27] and proved by law
[1:15:30] god's word
[1:15:31] and so tonight we are going to do a
[1:15:33] little bit of it a little bit of
[1:15:35] preaching a little bit of
[1:15:36] studying but as paul said in hebrews 9
[1:15:41] where a testament is there must also be
[1:15:43] the necessity
[1:15:45] of the death of the testator
[1:15:48] so
[1:15:49] if i make a world today
[1:15:51] and i'm not dead
[1:15:53] you don't have anything
[1:15:55] you better pray that i die quickly so
[1:15:58] you can inherit the car
[1:16:00] or the house
[1:16:02] don't think it doesn't happen let's be
[1:16:04] honest right
[1:16:05] when is he going to die so i can get the
[1:16:07] house or the car
[1:16:10] you might not say it outright but in
[1:16:12] your heart i'm suffering dad
[1:16:15] he's got this nice hefty insurance
[1:16:20] it's going to come to you
[1:16:21] but you better be sure your name is in
[1:16:22] the world because
[1:16:24] that one is me that decides
[1:16:27] nobody has to see it
[1:16:29] so if we go to the next page i want to
[1:16:31] spend time to try to explain the
[1:16:33] technology and then
[1:16:35] uh probably another 30 15 minutes to
[1:16:38] bring it down so the first word i use
[1:16:40] there is tester
[1:16:44] the original owner
[1:16:46] a person who creates a world
[1:16:49] the world is actually not for you but
[1:16:51] for him
[1:16:52] that when he dies
[1:16:54] all that he has
[1:16:56] who should have what praise the lord
[1:16:59] hallelujah
[1:17:00] so you can do
[1:17:02] look at the law of the land some rich
[1:17:04] person
[1:17:07] and
[1:17:07] most times you have to be a relative
[1:17:11] sometimes they give it to
[1:17:13] their dog or some charity
[1:17:17] so tester is the original owner
[1:17:20] and as i go i'll be bringing our minds
[1:17:23] to what it is
[1:17:25] the original owner of this earth
[1:17:29] that is god amen
[1:17:32] that's right and god could not die
[1:17:35] so he had to bring all the promises all
[1:17:38] the world everything that he wants to do
[1:17:41] in the person of jesus christ
[1:17:45] and everything that he promised you
[1:17:47] is in jesus christ
[1:17:49] so that's why many people still miss
[1:17:52] easter
[1:17:55] now
[1:17:56] if i die and i'm on the cross it doesn't
[1:17:58] mean much
[1:17:59] and christ is on the cross anyway
[1:18:02] but his death
[1:18:03] released his will
[1:18:07] so i have an inheritance
[1:18:09] he was preaching to me about inheritance
[1:18:11] and i thought god let him keep quiet so
[1:18:13] i can
[1:18:14] talk about it
[1:18:17] so
[1:18:18] do you know you have an inheritance yes
[1:18:21] you believe it
[1:18:22] okay
[1:18:24] are you sure and you've been praying for
[1:18:27] the tester to die
[1:18:29] have you not
[1:18:31] he's dead
[1:18:33] that's why we have easter
[1:18:36] are you sure he's
[1:18:38] dead if i ask you to show me your
[1:18:41] inheritance would you show me
[1:18:47] either he didn't die or your name was
[1:18:49] not in the book
[1:18:55] let's go to the next one so testament or
[1:18:57] the world
[1:18:58] it's a disposition or arrangement the
[1:19:01] primary purpose of a world is to clearly
[1:19:03] state
[1:19:04] the intent
[1:19:05] for the largest position which one makes
[1:19:08] of his early possessions and for the
[1:19:10] court to make
[1:19:11] your will legally binding
[1:19:14] so if
[1:19:16] the testiture
[1:19:18] dies
[1:19:19] there is a statement that is filed with
[1:19:21] the court
[1:19:23] and that statement has names in it
[1:19:28] and it cannot be opened until the person
[1:19:29] has died
[1:19:33] when a person dies
[1:19:36] everybody cries
[1:19:39] for joy or for
[1:19:43] fear or whatever and after he's been
[1:19:45] buried
[1:19:47] then let's go down and look at
[1:19:49] what he decided
[1:19:51] you had no decision
[1:19:55] because the one that is making the world
[1:19:57] decide who gets what
[1:19:59] right
[1:20:00] because he might know that if i get a
[1:20:02] dog his dog i might eat a dog so he
[1:20:04] might not give it to me
[1:20:07] or a cat
[1:20:10] he might give you a dog because he knows
[1:20:12] you're going to take care of the dog and
[1:20:14] give feed the dog
[1:20:16] he might give you the car
[1:20:18] he might give you anything that he
[1:20:20] decides it's not your decision
[1:20:24] and so you can't
[1:20:25] get up and say
[1:20:27] i like this one he's dead and gone
[1:20:28] anyway he made it
[1:20:30] and thank god we have it etc
[1:20:33] that before the foundation of the world
[1:20:35] was laid
[1:20:37] he
[1:20:38] gave us gifts
[1:20:39] without repentance
[1:20:42] before you repented came to say oh jesus
[1:20:44] i give my self away
[1:20:47] that's all i can do
[1:20:48] he thought about you
[1:20:51] he knew what you would need in this life
[1:20:54] and he put your name there
[1:20:59] now if your name is not there that's
[1:21:01] another story
[1:21:03] we'll touch it a little bit
[1:21:05] then the next technology is an executor
[1:21:09] i type it to the prophet of the age and
[1:21:12] the five-fold ministers
[1:21:14] executor is the one that will knock on
[1:21:16] the door one afternoon you are all
[1:21:18] dejected when are we going to open the
[1:21:20] world
[1:21:21] probably is gone couple of years or
[1:21:23] something knocks on the door and says
[1:21:26] i have news for you. what
[1:21:29] your name is in the world
[1:21:31] right
[1:21:33] because what is all the preaching doing
[1:21:35] what is all the message doing to bring
[1:21:37] you
[1:21:39] that before the foundation of the world
[1:21:40] was late
[1:21:42] god thought about you
[1:21:44] and put your name in the world
[1:21:47] you had nothing to do with it yes
[1:21:50] and so i find that it's hard to tell
[1:21:52] people that there is a prophet and there
[1:21:54] is a message
[1:21:56] maybe the prophet is that that message
[1:21:58] is not knocking at the door of their
[1:22:00] heart
[1:22:02] but if god speaks to you
[1:22:04] there's nothing
[1:22:06] for this age other than this message
[1:22:09] because you look at it and said he's
[1:22:11] speaking to me
[1:22:14] i am part of what he's talking about
[1:22:18] and you might say oh where's my name
[1:22:19] robert but you see if you take abraham
[1:22:22] when hebrews 11 was written he staggered
[1:22:24] not
[1:22:25] at the word of god now you go back all
[1:22:28] through the bible we know abraham
[1:22:31] had ishmael and all that and he told a
[1:22:33] lie and went back and forth
[1:22:36] but they tested testator
[1:22:39] knew abraham
[1:22:40] before he even made a mistake
[1:22:43] he knew david
[1:22:45] before david made a mistake that's right
[1:22:46] yes
[1:22:47] and that's what he's looking at that's
[1:22:49] right amen that's why the prophet could
[1:22:51] say
[1:22:53] he took a photo of you
[1:22:55] on your best estate
[1:22:57] you come to my house the nicest photos
[1:23:00] of my cat is on the wall
[1:23:02] they might have grown
[1:23:04] taller or got some pink pimples or
[1:23:07] whatever but that's on my wall that's
[1:23:09] how i want to remember them
[1:23:12] and he took a photo of you i'm talking
[1:23:14] about the tester
[1:23:16] and put it on his hall of fame wall of
[1:23:18] fame
[1:23:21] so when you get up and oh god today is a
[1:23:25] hard day
[1:23:26] he looks at the photo what is he talking
[1:23:28] about
[1:23:30] glory to god
[1:23:32] some evil spirit has gotten on him
[1:23:35] so sometimes we got to shake all those
[1:23:37] out yes
[1:23:39] the tester
[1:23:40] thought about you and put your name on
[1:23:42] it
[1:23:43] so you have a five-fold minister in your
[1:23:45] church let's have prayer let's do this
[1:23:48] until something speaks to you
[1:23:51] that actually
[1:23:53] is you
[1:23:55] that he's talking to
[1:23:57] and so
[1:23:58] we all become executed in the sense that
[1:24:01] we are bringing you the good message
[1:24:03] what is the good good message the
[1:24:05] message is that your name
[1:24:08] was in the world
[1:24:10] before the foundation of the world was
[1:24:12] laid
[1:24:16] it's not everybody's name that is in
[1:24:17] there let's be honest
[1:24:20] so
[1:24:21] the time of
[1:24:23] are you going to read your bible are you
[1:24:25] going to go to church
[1:24:26] it's
[1:24:28] over if you get it that your name is in
[1:24:31] there
[1:24:32] you realize that it does something to
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:36] the woman of the world nobody has to
[1:24:37] tell her
[1:24:39] but somehow
[1:24:41] when that man told her that she's had
[1:24:43] five husband
[1:24:46] you might take it as a condemnation oh
[1:24:49] five husbands so i'm going to go but she
[1:24:51] took it that if this man knew before the
[1:24:54] foundation of the world was late
[1:24:57] that she will have five husbands don't
[1:24:58] think god doesn't didn't know that right
[1:25:01] and he sent somebody to now tell her
[1:25:04] and what was i respond
[1:25:06] we expect a prophet to do the same thing
[1:25:09] i am he
[1:25:11] oh oh
[1:25:13] i'm in the presence of the testes
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:18] god has to come down to reveal it to you
[1:25:20] and when you see it you said now
[1:25:24] probably if i was there i said women
[1:25:26] should not preach don't preach
[1:25:28] and the prophet used that story
[1:25:30] thousands of times
[1:25:32] she went to the city forgot about the
[1:25:34] water and preached yes so what i'm
[1:25:36] trying to bring to you is that
[1:25:40] somehow something has to get to you
[1:25:43] when it gets to you all the struggle all
[1:25:45] the things is over because you have
[1:25:48] passed
[1:25:49] you have passed from death onto life
[1:25:54] glory to god
[1:25:56] let's go through this because i haven't
[1:25:58] started the sermon and how many minutes
[1:26:00] have we got
[1:26:01] beneficiary
[1:26:02] sons and daughters of god an individual
[1:26:05] entity designated as recipient of the
[1:26:08] money or property under the world or
[1:26:10] trust
[1:26:11] i've never seen anybody that well it
[1:26:13] happens when the world was read he said
[1:26:16] oh
[1:26:17] i don't like the dog or i don't like the
[1:26:19] car
[1:26:20] sometimes people will say they don't
[1:26:22] want it but
[1:26:23] most times people will take it
[1:26:25] right people will take it
[1:26:28] inheritance
[1:26:32] it can refer to the assets that an
[1:26:34] individual be quick to their loved ones
[1:26:36] after they pass away
[1:26:39] this inheritance a testator might want
[1:26:42] to contact an attorney if he wants to
[1:26:44] leave someone out of his world
[1:26:47] that would otherwise inherit his
[1:26:48] property by law such as a spouse or a
[1:26:51] child
[1:26:53] that's a tough one
[1:26:55] because
[1:26:56] i put your name in my will
[1:26:59] you do something so bad i take
[1:27:02] your name out of my will
[1:27:07] that works
[1:27:08] but you know one thing
[1:27:10] god does not change his mind
[1:27:16] are you sure
[1:27:18] not even his mind about anything about
[1:27:20] you
[1:27:21] because he knew you
[1:27:23] before the foundation of the world was
[1:27:25] laid
[1:27:26] he even knew your mistakes right now if
[1:27:28] you want to call the prophet he said he
[1:27:30] even ordained your mistakes
[1:27:34] i have no idea
[1:27:36] what a god
[1:27:39] oh i had an accident it was such a bad
[1:27:41] accident you know i just god allowed it
[1:27:44] god ordained it
[1:27:46] it's part of your story
[1:27:49] challenges
[1:27:50] the hardest part with
[1:27:52] inheritance is that
[1:27:53] there is always somebody who is not
[1:27:55] satisfied
[1:27:57] either their name was left out or they
[1:28:00] didn't get what they expected to get
[1:28:02] right
[1:28:03] why didn't you make me a minister why
[1:28:06] can't i be like this one
[1:28:08] you know i know
[1:28:09] i was telling about my cousin who is a
[1:28:11] catholic priest
[1:28:13] and some others that i know they are
[1:28:14] always praying for the same
[1:28:16] revelation and the same gift that the
[1:28:18] prophet had
[1:28:20] in other words we get to a point where
[1:28:21] we want to be a copycat
[1:28:23] but the tested
[1:28:25] knows who you are
[1:28:28] not just news because he made you
[1:28:32] he made you what you are
[1:28:34] so
[1:28:35] you better accept who you are
[1:28:37] if he made you a woman stay a woman
[1:28:44] don't be confused about
[1:28:47] an x or y or what
[1:28:50] right
[1:28:51] so
[1:28:52] here you are
[1:28:53] a tester gives you an inheritance and
[1:28:56] because he knows you're a man he gave
[1:28:57] you manly things and then he said no
[1:29:00] i'm no more
[1:29:01] so
[1:29:02] and it's all that's why we are confused
[1:29:04] this is easter
[1:29:06] the death of the tested
[1:29:08] and we are walking here still trying to
[1:29:10] figure out whether it's on the cross or
[1:29:12] my cross is heavier than yours and i can
[1:29:14] have a a nice uh uh what do you call it
[1:29:17] youtube video of me carrying a cross
[1:29:21] you've missed it
[1:29:22] right that's right completely
[1:29:25] it's nice to watch them then people
[1:29:26] would actually in philippines they
[1:29:28] sacrifice people yeah put nails on them
[1:29:30] and and put names
[1:29:32] my the world is gone
[1:29:35] they can't wait for god to get out of
[1:29:37] here
[1:29:39] the promises of god are in him
[1:29:43] so every promise that god made
[1:29:47] all the
[1:29:49] seven compound names of god
[1:29:51] is fulfilled
[1:29:53] in jesus christ
[1:29:55] that's right the prophet said
[1:29:57] jesus christ was the tree of life in the
[1:30:00] garden of eden
[1:30:02] so if you
[1:30:04] want to really go to the tree of life
[1:30:05] this is it
[1:30:07] there's nothing else
[1:30:09] now so if god put all the promises on
[1:30:11] him
[1:30:12] and god
[1:30:14] wanted the promises to be fulfilled
[1:30:17] therefore he took him to calgary calvary
[1:30:20] and he died
[1:30:22] i'm not going to go to the second part
[1:30:24] of the horizon yet
[1:30:26] then it means all the promises that god
[1:30:29] ever all the thought god ever had
[1:30:33] it's now released in his fullness
[1:30:37] that's what paul says if the testator
[1:30:39] doesn't die there's nothing in effect
[1:30:42] when he dies
[1:30:44] the the law the court says this is your
[1:30:47] car
[1:30:48] i might not don't know how much it costs
[1:30:51] i don't know how to drive but this is
[1:30:53] yours
[1:30:56] this is yours
[1:30:59] the proof of his death
[1:31:01] is what you have inherited
[1:31:06] if you can't prove that you have
[1:31:07] inherited anything then either christ
[1:31:09] didn't die or you can convince me that
[1:31:11] your name is not there
[1:31:14] i'm convinced your name is there so if
[1:31:16] you don't believe it just say brother
[1:31:17] robert thank you for
[1:31:19] being sure that my name is in the world
[1:31:22] because my desire always to
[1:31:25] go where god's people are
[1:31:28] that's a thing i pray every time so i
[1:31:31] don't know how many i don't know who but
[1:31:33] i know somebody
[1:31:34] we go to meet over there
[1:31:36] so when you have that witness when you
[1:31:39] stand there you know there are people
[1:31:41] that
[1:31:43] can you imagine god shedding the blood
[1:31:45] of a human
[1:31:47] even animals that are short that are
[1:31:49] killed
[1:31:50] mercilessly god doesn't like it but to
[1:31:53] take a human life
[1:31:55] just for you
[1:31:57] it means god means serious business yes
[1:32:01] praise the lord days of just quoting or
[1:32:03] doing this and things are over
[1:32:06] let this easter
[1:32:08] mean to us that we have an inheritance
[1:32:12] you do
[1:32:16] so he was a man when he cried there at
[1:32:18] calvary
[1:32:20] where are we the next page right
[1:32:22] when he cried my god my god why has that
[1:32:24] forsaken me he died as a man but on
[1:32:27] easter morning he rose breaking the
[1:32:30] seals of death corruption
[1:32:32] rising to ascend to the father above
[1:32:33] showing that he was more than a man he
[1:32:36] was god in flesh
[1:32:40] some of these things you read and read
[1:32:42] and read and he said what is he talking
[1:32:43] about
[1:32:46] if jesus was only man
[1:32:50] you don't have an inheritance
[1:32:54] so
[1:32:55] a man will die and probably will wait
[1:32:58] for the resurrection
[1:33:00] but this man died and said in three days
[1:33:01] i'll rise up
[1:33:03] right
[1:33:04] so god did not put his promises in a man
[1:33:08] he put his promises in himself
[1:33:11] represented himself as a man so he can
[1:33:14] go back and release them to you
[1:33:18] that's itself
[1:33:20] mind-boggling
[1:33:22] he was a man because he walked on earth
[1:33:25] but when he died
[1:33:27] he rose again no man can just say i'm
[1:33:30] dying and i'll rise up he did it
[1:33:32] and he did it for one purpose
[1:33:35] only one purpose
[1:33:37] so that you can inherit
[1:33:40] an inheritance oh i have to take time a
[1:33:42] little bit
[1:33:44] your inheritance
[1:33:48] probably the best way to explain it
[1:33:50] when israel
[1:33:52] got to the promised land
[1:33:54] god said i'm going to give you
[1:33:55] inheritance.
[1:33:58] he didn't even
[1:34:00] let
[1:34:01] joshua have a revelation of who will go
[1:34:03] where he said cast lot see god uses
[1:34:06] simple things
[1:34:07] to do his work so they cast lot
[1:34:10] benjamin this is your land judah this is
[1:34:12] your land this one this is your land
[1:34:14] because they came from egypt they didn't
[1:34:16] know god said i'm going to give you a
[1:34:17] land when they got there cast a lot and
[1:34:19] gave everybody inheritance
[1:34:22] now after they got the inheritance
[1:34:24] benjamin was a small tribe
[1:34:26] judah they were fighters
[1:34:29] and all the troil tribes
[1:34:31] everybody had their land
[1:34:33] think about it that judah could have
[1:34:35] just decided benjamin we're getting rid
[1:34:36] of you we'll take over your land
[1:34:39] no
[1:34:40] but you could see if you study the bible
[1:34:43] god protects the inheritance that he has
[1:34:47] assigned to you
[1:34:49] you can't even protect it god protects
[1:34:51] you yes
[1:34:53] so even though moses let's make a law
[1:34:54] moses do it
[1:34:56] when you marry your inheritance is from
[1:34:59] your your
[1:35:00] your husband
[1:35:03] so i believe joshua or one of them their
[1:35:06] father died they didn't have a male so
[1:35:08] they came to moses what about us because
[1:35:12] our father died and we didn't have any
[1:35:14] man so what about our inheritance he
[1:35:16] said yeah i give them some of the
[1:35:18] inheritance but the moment they are they
[1:35:20] marry
[1:35:21] the inheritance go back to them to the
[1:35:23] original tribe yes in other words god
[1:35:26] all these years have been protecting
[1:35:28] that piece of land in israel
[1:35:31] it might be all mixed up but god ceased
[1:35:33] to protect in it yes and i want to tell
[1:35:36] you this morning if you heard something
[1:35:38] even from your father or something oh i
[1:35:40] just want to sell it and go away and all
[1:35:42] that you might do all that but you see
[1:35:44] god protects it
[1:35:46] so anything god has given you he
[1:35:48] protects it
[1:35:49] he protects his gifts
[1:35:52] can you imagine the prophet going to try
[1:35:53] to take a
[1:35:54] drink and he couldn't do it
[1:35:57] god had to protect it that's right
[1:36:00] glory to god hey
[1:36:02] if he doesn't protect you how are you
[1:36:04] going to make it
[1:36:06] that's why it says in a in a simple way
[1:36:08] the steps of the righteous are ordered
[1:36:12] so god is in the protection business
[1:36:15] if he gives you an inheritance he knows
[1:36:17] robert will go and squander it
[1:36:20] so he'll protect it
[1:36:22] not like the prodigal son that
[1:36:25] father when are you going to die
[1:36:27] you are getting too old give me
[1:36:29] what you think belongs to me
[1:36:32] he took it
[1:36:33] he went and squandered it
[1:36:36] one day he woke up
[1:36:38] so he didn't have inheritance he came
[1:36:40] back
[1:36:41] why he said now make me one of the
[1:36:43] sevens
[1:36:45] the father was very joyful but if you
[1:36:48] read the
[1:36:49] the bible very well the father gave him
[1:36:51] a ring not his ring
[1:36:55] so all these things it takes the prophet
[1:36:57] to bring it out
[1:36:58] he's come home
[1:37:00] he's quander the inheritance but god
[1:37:04] don't think that god didn't know the
[1:37:06] prodigal son would go away yeah right
[1:37:09] god that allowed him to go
[1:37:12] he's able to bring the inheritance
[1:37:15] right back to him
[1:37:16] so you haven't lost anything
[1:37:19] god is not an indian giver
[1:37:21] that he gives it to you tomorrow
[1:37:24] robert
[1:37:25] you told a big lie today i take it back
[1:37:27] no it was part of it
[1:37:29] so let's go quickly
[1:37:32] so now to abraham and he sees where the
[1:37:34] promise is made
[1:37:36] he said
[1:37:37] not to cease as of many but of one
[1:37:42] and so the seed of abraham
[1:37:44] is not the physical but by faith
[1:37:48] i'm bringing a lot of things then i'll
[1:37:51] bring it close together
[1:37:53] so
[1:37:54] god
[1:37:55] and abraham's relationship
[1:37:57] extend to us not because we must be jews
[1:38:00] because people still think if i convert
[1:38:02] to be a jew then that is going to help
[1:38:04] me
[1:38:05] actually abraham was god's friend
[1:38:07] abraham
[1:38:09] not so much as he was so righteous but
[1:38:11] he believed god
[1:38:13] our faith is what brings that
[1:38:16] relationship to christ
[1:38:20] our faith is what establishes us as a
[1:38:23] kinsmen
[1:38:24] of christ
[1:38:26] so if you believe christ died for you
[1:38:28] how many believe that that faith is what
[1:38:31] establishes you that you have an
[1:38:32] inheritance
[1:38:34] glory to god the moment you lose that
[1:38:36] oh he died for somebody but not me
[1:38:38] that's fine
[1:38:40] but if you have an inheritance
[1:38:42] if something occurs to you you say he
[1:38:44] died
[1:38:45] not for everybody but for me
[1:38:48] it's a personal thing yes
[1:38:50] it's a personal thing
[1:38:52] and so hebrews 11 13 says these all died
[1:38:55] in faith
[1:38:57] having received their promises but i
[1:38:58] haven't seen them afar off
[1:39:01] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[1:39:03] them and confessed that they were
[1:39:04] strangers and piglets on earth
[1:39:07] and they saw having obtained a good
[1:39:09] rapport through faith
[1:39:10] received not the promise
[1:39:14] so all those people who died
[1:39:17] from moses
[1:39:20] rahab all of them and we have people are
[1:39:23] coming to
[1:39:25] take over jericho
[1:39:27] and she believed i can't believe it
[1:39:29] and everything that she's done in her
[1:39:31] life it didn't matter to god
[1:39:34] he just believed that these people
[1:39:37] we better do something
[1:39:39] and by faith the scarlet thread is all
[1:39:41] that she had and can you imagine the
[1:39:43] army coming to
[1:39:45] fight jericho
[1:39:47] there is no sign
[1:39:49] i'm not going to make a phone call
[1:39:51] if you see her you say send me a text
[1:39:53] that you are there
[1:39:55] and show me a way he said no just hang
[1:39:57] that scarlet thread
[1:39:59] i don't know how thick but if it was me
[1:40:01] probably the thread would be so red
[1:40:03] that everybody will see something is
[1:40:05] happening because i don't want them to
[1:40:06] miss it
[1:40:08] she hung that scarlet thread all the way
[1:40:10] down yeah
[1:40:12] and the army coming
[1:40:15] going to overtake jericho
[1:40:18] and she and her family in the living
[1:40:19] room hanging on
[1:40:32] what if somebody pulled it out
[1:40:34] what if they didn't see it but she
[1:40:36] believed it
[1:40:38] and god confirmed her faith
[1:40:41] by signing them to deliver her
[1:40:44] in her house
[1:40:46] she was not a preacher
[1:40:48] she was a harlot
[1:40:50] it didn't matter to god your faith is
[1:40:52] what is going to get you there
[1:40:55] and when you get shaken just remember
[1:40:57] rehab and say my goodness i need some
[1:41:00] scarlet right to tie
[1:41:01] you know around my my waist or something
[1:41:04] to know that the blood of jesus
[1:41:07] has been shed for me
[1:41:09] i'm going to have to
[1:41:11] hurry
[1:41:14] jesus walked and this is the time jesus
[1:41:17] walked with his 12 disciples
[1:41:19] they saw everything
[1:41:21] about him as a man
[1:41:23] and they saw everything about him as god
[1:41:27] so there are times they were not sure
[1:41:28] whether he was god or he was man
[1:41:30] one day he was asleep on the pillow and
[1:41:32] everybody was the boat was ready to
[1:41:34] capsize
[1:41:35] don't you care that we perish he got up
[1:41:38] and said peace mister hey this man
[1:41:41] he's more than god
[1:41:43] he's more than god
[1:41:46] they get to some place on the mountain
[1:41:50] all of a sudden moses that was there was
[1:41:52] talking to him
[1:41:53] the disciples says oh this is wonderful
[1:41:55] we are not going down let's break
[1:41:57] greater banana cross
[1:41:59] three churches
[1:42:01] one for moses one for you one when we
[1:42:03] stay here
[1:42:06] because they saw god in him yes
[1:42:09] but seeing god in your pastor in a
[1:42:12] prophet or somebody isn't the answer
[1:42:16] but it is you seeing that you are part
[1:42:19] of that god
[1:42:24] seeing yourself that you are part of
[1:42:26] this message it's what makes a
[1:42:27] difference
[1:42:30] it's not just a quote it's just all the
[1:42:31] tips you are listening to
[1:42:35] glory to god so these disciples at the
[1:42:37] end that jesus had died like probably
[1:42:39] saturday morning or listen like today
[1:42:44] after he's died
[1:42:46] they've seen all the powerful messages
[1:42:49] and then
[1:42:51] peter said
[1:42:53] i'm just going to go back to my fishing
[1:42:54] because something has happened maybe i
[1:42:57] don't understand so if you read luke
[1:42:59] chapter 24 peter says i'm going fishing
[1:43:02] some of them joined them
[1:43:04] others said well
[1:43:06] we are sad but
[1:43:07] let's just get out of here so they were
[1:43:09] going to him house
[1:43:11] and when they were going
[1:43:13] they started
[1:43:14] looking so
[1:43:16] tired and so
[1:43:18] gloomy
[1:43:20] we all have gloomy days sure
[1:43:22] but the bible says jesus drew near and
[1:43:25] so when you see that you are part of god
[1:43:30] your lowest moment actually is when god
[1:43:33] comes near you
[1:43:35] the problem is we are looking on our
[1:43:36] gloominess that we don't even see that
[1:43:38] god is right there right so he came
[1:43:41] and walked with them
[1:43:43] if you read the bible abraham explains
[1:43:45] about three days jenny
[1:43:47] he preached them
[1:43:49] watch them
[1:43:50] talking to them explaining things to
[1:43:52] them
[1:43:53] he didn't go somewhere but i want you to
[1:43:55] know he took from the source of the tree
[1:43:57] of life this is this word of god
[1:44:00] many times people will come and use the
[1:44:01] stories like this and that and that
[1:44:03] you've got to go back to the source
[1:44:05] explain it all to them
[1:44:07] he even tied them all fools
[1:44:11] they go down
[1:44:13] he made like he was going
[1:44:15] they still didn't get it
[1:44:17] and he said they said oh why stay and
[1:44:19] eat with us
[1:44:22] they persuaded him
[1:44:25] he stayed
[1:44:26] at with them
[1:44:28] the way he was eating
[1:44:30] i don't know how he was eating but
[1:44:32] something struck them this is him
[1:44:39] something has to track you
[1:44:41] he doesn't have to be in church
[1:44:43] but somehow god has to come near and
[1:44:45] strike your heart if he doesn't do it
[1:44:47] you'll miss it every day
[1:44:49] but something struck them and these
[1:44:51] people just turned around and said no
[1:44:53] it's him
[1:44:57] i don't know how god did it
[1:45:01] and he disappeared
[1:45:04] the bible says
[1:45:08] now they were going somewhere
[1:45:11] the three days jenny they did it in one
[1:45:13] day
[1:45:14] i don't know how much energy they had
[1:45:20] probably they were running are you tired
[1:45:22] oh i'm going
[1:45:25] one day
[1:45:26] they ran back
[1:45:27] to jerusalem
[1:45:28] the disciples had got it
[1:45:31] they didn't have any story he is risen
[1:45:34] he's risen are you sure he's risen
[1:45:38] and then jesus himself came and
[1:45:42] stood amongst them
[1:45:46] whatever god did
[1:45:48] he better do it and tonight for us
[1:45:52] because it changes your atmosphere
[1:45:53] changes your mind it changes the way you
[1:45:56] walk
[1:45:58] because all things are now possible to
[1:46:00] you
[1:46:02] it doesn't take three days journey
[1:46:03] praying doesn't get hard anymore reading
[1:46:06] your bible doesn't say i better hurry i
[1:46:08] have to get to work anymore
[1:46:10] something in you makes you put that
[1:46:12] above everything
[1:46:14] it quickens the life in you
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:20] he had to
[1:46:23] because when you really look at that
[1:46:26] you realize that
[1:46:28] all of us can walk with god take the
[1:46:29] message quote listen to abraham but
[1:46:31] until god takes something
[1:46:34] and open our eyes to it yeah it's all
[1:46:38] exercise right it's like going to the
[1:46:41] gym exercising
[1:46:42] and eating
[1:46:44] and eating why am i not losing weight
[1:46:47] something hasn't happened
[1:46:55] the problem we have often is that we
[1:46:58] don't even realize as the bible says
[1:47:02] bone of his bone
[1:47:03] flesh of his flesh
[1:47:05] you are so much a part of god
[1:47:09] that god cannot do without you
[1:47:13] no you think you are the one that can do
[1:47:15] without god no
[1:47:16] god can do without you
[1:47:19] if god even shows you that robert god
[1:47:21] can do without you it changes everything
[1:47:24] because you were part of god from the
[1:47:26] beginning
[1:47:27] he put your name in his will
[1:47:29] it means you're a relative born of his
[1:47:31] moon flesh of his flesh
[1:47:34] we always think is we that need god god
[1:47:38] also needs us
[1:47:39] that's why the prophet always says no
[1:47:41] man ever saw god
[1:47:43] he's god always that is sick in you
[1:47:45] that's why he sent you a pastor
[1:47:48] that's why he sent the executor at your
[1:47:50] door
[1:47:51] to tell you that
[1:47:52] your name is in the world
[1:47:54] and can you imagine god putting your
[1:47:55] name in the wall and you walk away he
[1:47:57] will make sure that you know your name
[1:47:59] is in there and you can inherit what he
[1:48:01] has put there for you
[1:48:03] so don't blame brother one if he's
[1:48:06] stressing you out
[1:48:09] just pray that lord let me get what he's
[1:48:11] trying to tell me
[1:48:13] so we are fresh off his flesh bone of
[1:48:15] his bone when god was wounded when god
[1:48:18] wounded christ at calvary he was wounded
[1:48:20] for me and you
[1:48:21] we are fresh off his flesh bone of his
[1:48:23] own body of his body name of his name
[1:48:25] bride of
[1:48:26] of him
[1:48:27] see
[1:48:28] we are in him we are flesh of his flesh
[1:48:30] and bone of his bones
[1:48:32] so
[1:48:34] god has potentially already raised us
[1:48:37] the quaking power
[1:48:39] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:48:44] it's already enough
[1:48:47] in god's mind we already raised up
[1:48:50] in god's mind the rapture has already
[1:48:51] taken place
[1:48:52] in god's mind a lot of things has
[1:48:54] happened
[1:48:55] we are just waiting
[1:48:58] for the manifestation
[1:49:01] so it's nice to feel that
[1:49:04] christ died and released the inheritance
[1:49:08] it's just that when somebody gives you
[1:49:10] the inheritance and he leaves you alone
[1:49:12] with it you could still make mistakes
[1:49:14] here and there
[1:49:16] but god is obligated to make sure that
[1:49:19] you
[1:49:21] when you hurry the inheritance
[1:49:23] you use it the way
[1:49:25] he has ordained it
[1:49:27] the gifts are not for you
[1:49:30] to make you
[1:49:32] somebody
[1:49:33] but his gifts are there god plays it in
[1:49:36] you
[1:49:36] so he can use it to bless his children
[1:49:40] you can try to make money out of it you
[1:49:41] can do whatever you want out of it
[1:49:44] but that's not it
[1:49:46] i'm trying to bring this to a close now
[1:49:48] i want to bring your mind to it
[1:49:51] so one day i said well
[1:49:54] the only way i know my name is in it is
[1:49:56] bring everybody
[1:49:58] let's sit at a courtroom or somewhere
[1:50:01] and then we're going to open the world
[1:50:06] the first thing you want to know
[1:50:09] is that
[1:50:11] likely
[1:50:12] everybody that is assembled his name is
[1:50:14] in the world
[1:50:17] did you hear that
[1:50:19] the fact that you've been invited by the
[1:50:21] executor that come to the court today we
[1:50:24] are going to read the word
[1:50:27] almost 100 your name is in the world yes
[1:50:29] sure
[1:50:32] and i can say tonight
[1:50:34] being here
[1:50:36] means god has something for you
[1:50:39] yes sir
[1:50:41] and you didn't come here by yourself he
[1:50:42] drew you here
[1:50:44] in fact he knew where you were going to
[1:50:46] sit
[1:50:48] do you believe it yes otherwise he's not
[1:50:49] god
[1:50:51] oh he knew even what you're going to
[1:50:52] wear
[1:50:53] right
[1:50:54] you believe that yes sir
[1:50:57] when you were looking in your wardrobe i
[1:50:59] like this one no i don't want this one
[1:51:01] no this one is too tight no this one is
[1:51:03] that you know who was doing that it's
[1:51:05] god the holy ghost
[1:51:06] he's that close to you
[1:51:10] and then you come here and say ah don't
[1:51:12] i look handsome or beautiful
[1:51:15] god planted all before the foundation of
[1:51:17] the world
[1:51:19] he put it all in his will
[1:51:21] and you go back
[1:51:23] how you got that clothes probably you
[1:51:24] bought it on a trip somewhere and you've
[1:51:27] kept it
[1:51:28] when am i going to throw it away and on
[1:51:30] and on and on and today you wore
[1:51:32] it he did it all before the foundation
[1:51:35] of the world was left
[1:51:38] so when the tested
[1:51:41] has died the world has to be opened
[1:51:45] that's why in this age
[1:51:49] it took all the ages
[1:51:51] for this end time
[1:51:53] and when the world is written is sealed
[1:51:56] that's why god
[1:51:58] took the sieves
[1:52:00] and opened it because none of the ages
[1:52:04] that people actually can see their name
[1:52:06] in it
[1:52:08] so this is the age that that's why the
[1:52:10] bible says
[1:52:11] they without us are not made perfect
[1:52:15] they did everything just by faith now we
[1:52:17] are doing it because
[1:52:19] we are beyond faith in other words we've
[1:52:21] seen more than faith
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:24] and no man could open the world
[1:52:27] no man in heaven or in it so he opened
[1:52:29] the seats
[1:52:30] and there was somebody standing on earth
[1:52:33] and gave him the seals
[1:52:35] i know when you read the seals
[1:52:37] you see a white horse greyhound black
[1:52:39] horse going and assault
[1:52:42] that's a noise
[1:52:43] right absolutely go take your time and
[1:52:45] read the fourth seal
[1:52:48] he talks about it
[1:52:50] he said elijah
[1:52:52] after the fire came from heaven elijah
[1:52:55] he's a powerful man he can call fire
[1:52:57] from heaven
[1:53:00] killed 400 prophets
[1:53:02] very powerful very strong yes and then
[1:53:04] the next morning jesus said where is
[1:53:06] elijah i'm going to kill him
[1:53:09] you know what elijah did he ran away
[1:53:13] hiding in a cave
[1:53:17] right yes
[1:53:18] that was elijah
[1:53:20] the prophet said
[1:53:22] elijah was praying and even saying i'm
[1:53:23] the only one
[1:53:25] he said when god opened the seals to him
[1:53:28] and he saw his name there
[1:53:30] elijah was a different person
[1:53:33] now when jezebel sent
[1:53:36] 50
[1:53:38] army men go and arrest elijah
[1:53:41] i was thinking elijah would run away
[1:53:43] but elijah said if i
[1:53:47] be a prophet of god
[1:53:48] let fire come from heaven
[1:53:51] did it happen yes
[1:53:53] second time
[1:53:55] elijah got to a place where he was not
[1:53:57] at even when fire came from heaven but
[1:54:00] when god showed him that his name was
[1:54:02] there he was different
[1:54:05] and that's why this age we need to come
[1:54:07] to see that
[1:54:08] that's the only one only way we can
[1:54:11] withstand the end time struggle and the
[1:54:14] devil and the things that come our way
[1:54:16] because tomorrow there is this problem
[1:54:18] today there is this one you get up and
[1:54:20] you can't even do it but when you see
[1:54:22] your name it just transforms you
[1:54:26] now you can your prayer is even
[1:54:28] different
[1:54:29] if i be
[1:54:31] a son of god
[1:54:33] a daughter of god
[1:54:35] let this happen
[1:54:37] now it changes your prayer
[1:54:42] moses the runaway prophet
[1:54:47] every little thing moses will go and cry
[1:54:48] for god
[1:54:51] the prophet said when one day
[1:54:55] god showed moses
[1:54:57] his name in the book
[1:54:59] right
[1:55:00] moses prayer has been changed
[1:55:02] he wasn't afraid anymore
[1:55:04] so even in front of god when god said
[1:55:06] i'm going to destroy everybody moses
[1:55:08] said huh
[1:55:10] do it but take my name out of the book
[1:55:11] first how many have seen the scripture
[1:55:15] if i was god i'm so angry i'll take your
[1:55:17] name of it
[1:55:19] even god can't take your name out of his
[1:55:21] book
[1:55:22] i'm talking about alarm's book of life
[1:55:24] he can't even take your name from it
[1:55:28] he put moses name
[1:55:30] moses you know
[1:55:33] speak he hit the rock yeah
[1:55:37] he just have to pack moses back home
[1:55:39] because moses
[1:55:41] with all the blessings you still made in
[1:55:44] other words bible says moses had one app
[1:55:47] on god
[1:55:49] can you imagine walking here and knowing
[1:55:51] that your name is in the world
[1:55:53] your name is an alarm's book of life
[1:55:56] you don't know what it will do to you
[1:55:58] because it gives you some confidence yes
[1:56:02] that you've made it
[1:56:04] because he who that put your name there
[1:56:06] is able to protect you and bring you to
[1:56:08] the end game
[1:56:13] so moses
[1:56:15] now knows what is going on
[1:56:18] so there are many examples in the bible
[1:56:20] oh you know paul
[1:56:22] the bible says he was caught in the
[1:56:24] third
[1:56:26] heavens we don't know what happened to
[1:56:29] paul
[1:56:30] he saw all that but after he had seen
[1:56:34] god
[1:56:35] now a prophet agabus acts 16 came on the
[1:56:38] scene and said paul don't go to
[1:56:40] jerusalem you're going to die
[1:56:44] how many of you like me if a prophecy
[1:56:46] came tonight and say robert don't go
[1:56:47] back to chicago
[1:56:49] right the plane is going to crash
[1:56:53] everybody crying i probably will say no
[1:56:56] i'm not going
[1:56:57] i'll wait
[1:56:58] right but paul
[1:57:00] what is this
[1:57:03] are you telling me agabus
[1:57:06] you are a great prophet
[1:57:07] that i can't go to jerusalem
[1:57:10] because god has shown you i'm not
[1:57:12] doubting what god told you
[1:57:14] but god is telling you
[1:57:16] that it's part of my inheritance to go
[1:57:17] and suffer in jerusalem
[1:57:20] and they say paul you are too stubborn
[1:57:24] when you see your name a prophecy
[1:57:26] doesn't stop you
[1:57:28] nothing it's a supernatural work
[1:57:31] that you are working with god
[1:57:33] now paul went to jerusalem and many
[1:57:35] people say oh paul's ministry he
[1:57:37] disobeyed agabus great prophet but we
[1:57:40] know in this age if paul didn't go we
[1:57:42] couldn't even read hebrews
[1:57:45] when he was there
[1:57:46] god has a way with his pen
[1:57:49] and paul was writing all these yes
[1:57:51] that's right
[1:57:53] writing all this
[1:57:55] so i can go through so many even peter
[1:57:57] all of them in other words as you walk
[1:57:59] with god god has to bring you to some
[1:58:01] point
[1:58:03] and when that happens
[1:58:05] nobody can take it from you
[1:58:08] so this message is not death to read
[1:58:10] with abraham to read a quote is there to
[1:58:12] bring us to that point where we can see
[1:58:15] our name
[1:58:17] and if tonight you can see your name you
[1:58:19] you'll see what i mean
[1:58:21] nobody can the devil can't put you
[1:58:23] anywhere
[1:58:25] he bought trash ball john the revelator
[1:58:27] put him in oil tried everything they
[1:58:29] said finally we are banishing you you're
[1:58:31] a witch
[1:58:32] so he can write the book of revelation
[1:58:37] sure we have power over the devil
[1:58:41] not today
[1:58:42] but before the foundation of the world
[1:58:44] was laid
[1:58:45] and this end time because of the death
[1:58:47] that has been
[1:58:49] revealed to us and the sins have been
[1:58:51] opened it's released all the power of
[1:58:53] god
[1:58:54] on his bride
[1:58:58] no more you know i was telling somebody
[1:59:00] that you know those were the days
[1:59:03] if i was walking if elijah elijah god is
[1:59:06] going to take you away
[1:59:09] what do you want me to do for you
[1:59:12] what would you ask like oh you tell
[1:59:13] elijah but
[1:59:15] he said give me a double portion
[1:59:17] that was good
[1:59:20] the double portion is not for this age
[1:59:23] this age
[1:59:24] we are going
[1:59:26] yeah
[1:59:27] and here there is a child that will take
[1:59:29] you you could have afraid that lord i
[1:59:31] want to be part of that child i'm going
[1:59:33] with elijah
[1:59:35] you can have a double portion and do all
[1:59:37] the miracles
[1:59:39] mostly saw the miracles
[1:59:42] but the rare gift in this age
[1:59:44] is to see the day approaching and do
[1:59:47] something about it
[1:59:49] so i was thinking
[1:59:51] lord if i was standing there maybe now
[1:59:53] that i see things
[1:59:54] elijah says what would you want god to
[1:59:57] do for you
[1:59:58] i said
[1:59:59] so i'll go with you
[2:00:01] what
[2:00:02] because i just said whatever you ask i
[2:00:04] can do it yes
[2:00:06] so though the child had only one seat
[2:00:09] god will make a provision for another
[2:00:10] seat
[2:00:12] this ant is gone what do you want here
[2:00:15] you want more money i can pray for god
[2:00:17] to give you a million dollars what are
[2:00:18] you going to do
[2:00:21] it's time to get out of here
[2:00:26] change it
[2:00:27] let's pray more for god to give us
[2:00:29] strength to walk in this journey that
[2:00:31] says oh god and i need to be a bigger
[2:00:33] house and i need a better car and i need
[2:00:36] they are all important but they all go
[2:00:38] tomorrow you need a better car the next
[2:00:40] year you're going to need a better house
[2:00:44] every sickness god heals you you're
[2:00:46] going to be sick again
[2:00:52] i've given you enough examples do you
[2:00:53] want more oh there's so many now you
[2:00:56] read the bible and say my so every age
[2:00:58] and what is there god used brother brahm
[2:01:01] to do all the miracles they didn't even
[2:01:03] save the earth did they help anybody but
[2:01:05] it's for us to know that
[2:01:07] now that god has released it
[2:01:10] everything that god did in abraham being
[2:01:13] the first fruit is here in the bride
[2:01:18] you go to places people are waiting to
[2:01:19] see the pillar of fire and sometimes you
[2:01:21] go and people will show you a picture
[2:01:22] the pillar of fire
[2:01:24] is around
[2:01:26] let me tell you the people of crowd was
[2:01:28] there with moses
[2:01:32] right day and night never disappeared
[2:01:35] yet israel they were doing whatever they
[2:01:36] want to do
[2:01:39] right
[2:01:40] but here the prophet said the pillar of
[2:01:42] fire that you see him standing here
[2:01:45] it's now in
[2:01:48] you it's not the hollow on your head
[2:01:53] it's the spirit of god that has been
[2:01:55] released
[2:01:56] that has come to dwell in you
[2:01:58] it is the same fire
[2:02:05] we are in another age
[2:02:07] you can call it whatever you want
[2:02:09] but we are at a point where the bride
[2:02:11] sees the bridegroom
[2:02:14] sees themselves
[2:02:16] i'm bringing this to a close
[2:02:22] i need to talk about this so we can
[2:02:23] build up for tomorrow
[2:02:25] so after god has released
[2:02:29] the seas have been opened
[2:02:30] you've seen your name
[2:02:34] when abraham said it ushers in
[2:02:37] a stronger walk a closer walk with god
[2:02:40] that's why the bible could say a bride
[2:02:42] without spot or wrinkle can you imagine
[2:02:44] no sport or wrinkle
[2:02:46] how is god going to do that
[2:02:48] there has to be
[2:02:49] extra energy extra protection extra
[2:02:53] power of god
[2:02:55] the power of god has never been released
[2:02:57] on earth
[2:02:58] until this time the holy ghost has not
[2:03:01] been released in abundance until this
[2:03:03] time right and so when we are there we
[2:03:07] feeble trying to see who believes what
[2:03:10] and who does what it's just a devil
[2:03:12] coming among us to make us miss what it
[2:03:14] is there
[2:03:15] the most important thing is say lord
[2:03:18] i don't know whether my name is in there
[2:03:20] show me
[2:03:22] show me
[2:03:23] show me
[2:03:25] and when that happens
[2:03:27] he's going to have
[2:03:28] a holiday
[2:03:30] not so much as a holiday but you could
[2:03:32] see that the extra force that is driving
[2:03:34] you is no more from the pulpit
[2:03:38] it's a personal life in a personal way
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:43] and i stand here to tell you that
[2:03:47] i just look at god and i say god who am
[2:03:49] i
[2:03:51] to deserve
[2:03:52] that
[2:03:53] and in all this i like to go clap my
[2:03:55] hand uh play youtube and go away
[2:03:58] my goodness
[2:04:00] god bring me to that sauce
[2:04:03] so that every day that seed will sprout
[2:04:07] make my family make my workers make
[2:04:10] everywhere i go for them to see christ
[2:04:13] in me
[2:04:16] the death of jesus christ
[2:04:18] is to release christ in you
[2:04:21] is to make christ visible in you
[2:04:24] please take him off the cross yes
[2:04:27] he's still on the cross
[2:04:29] or in christmas time we put him in a
[2:04:31] manger he still never grew up
[2:04:34] and you say oh i mean the message and
[2:04:36] i'll quote robert abraham and somebody
[2:04:37] today was telling me sunrise was the
[2:04:39] most important event on earth
[2:04:44] wonderful
[2:04:46] but i see reason in your heart
[2:04:49] because we celebrate the sunrise morning
[2:04:51] okay he rose up
[2:04:53] what does it mean
[2:04:55] the world has missed it and even in the
[2:04:57] message we've missed it what i'm
[2:04:58] bringing you tonight is that
[2:05:01] he gave us the airness of our
[2:05:02] inheritance
[2:05:04] ephesians 1 13
[2:05:06] can we read that in closing
[2:05:12] i've gone over my time what is it 9 30
[2:05:14] my goodness we are about to close
[2:05:20] but that you leave something here and
[2:05:22] you it will crank and and you walk away
[2:05:25] and say yes
[2:05:27] yes
[2:05:28] god has done something for me
[2:05:30] ephesians 1 i'm sure you read it so
[2:05:33] paul's got something that all the
[2:05:36] disciples
[2:05:38] somehow you say so didn't peter know
[2:05:40] this didn't this one know this
[2:05:43] they all knew it but god gave him a
[2:05:45] revelation
[2:05:46] a deeper one so i'll start from verse
[2:05:49] chapter 1 verse 13.
[2:05:51] it says in whom he also trusted
[2:05:54] after he after that he had that word of
[2:05:58] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[2:06:00] whom also after that he believed
[2:06:03] ye were sealed with that holy spirit of
[2:06:05] promise
[2:06:07] and verse 14 says which is the earnest
[2:06:09] of our inheritance
[2:06:11] until the redemption of the purchase
[2:06:13] procession unto the praise of his glory
[2:06:17] so not only that he gave us the promise
[2:06:20] but he sent the holy ghost
[2:06:23] to enforce the promise
[2:06:27] because god protects his promise
[2:06:31] can you imagine mary an angel appearing
[2:06:34] to hear that mary you're going to have a
[2:06:36] baby
[2:06:37] now
[2:06:39] who
[2:06:40] can protect mary
[2:06:42] the devil will be sure that baby
[2:06:44] either miscarriaged
[2:06:46] or if he was born
[2:06:48] killed
[2:06:49] but god had to protect
[2:06:51] the baby
[2:06:52] even through a dream he let mary and
[2:06:55] joseph leave there
[2:06:56] to egypt and come back again
[2:06:59] and it was all in the scriptures
[2:07:02] under the devil's nose and he didn't see
[2:07:04] it
[2:07:04] praise the lord
[2:07:08] i will tell the devil go read the
[2:07:10] scriptures
[2:07:11] because it was right there that out of
[2:07:13] egypt called his son
[2:07:16] and the devil could have looked at it
[2:07:18] and said let's not kill those
[2:07:20] in bethlehem or judea let's kill
[2:07:22] everybody even in egypt right
[2:07:27] the devil is not wise
[2:07:29] he's lost
[2:07:32] because he does many things that it's
[2:07:34] like god
[2:07:35] letting the devil raise moses
[2:07:39] letting pharaoh raise moses
[2:07:41] that will come and overthrow him
[2:07:47] just bring some story i was he went
[2:07:49] someplace and i went with some brothers
[2:07:52] and we stayed with a person who was a
[2:07:53] character priest and
[2:07:55] fed us and everything
[2:07:57] and
[2:07:58] then we go to church and condemn the
[2:08:00] catholic church you know
[2:08:02] in other words god has protected it so
[2:08:05] much that the devil even can't see that
[2:08:08] you hide
[2:08:12] because he points to you your failures
[2:08:14] he points to you all the things that are
[2:08:16] wrong and then you also are doubting and
[2:08:18] the devil said it can be that's why he
[2:08:20] came to jesus and said if thou be the
[2:08:22] son of god
[2:08:24] come down from the cross
[2:08:25] he could have done it sure
[2:08:27] but if he did it
[2:08:29] this easter will be meaningless
[2:08:32] thank god he stayed there
[2:08:33] because he knew
[2:08:35] who he was
[2:08:38] and he knew that going to the cross was
[2:08:40] part
[2:08:41] of the game
[2:08:44] so he gave us the promise and gave us
[2:08:46] the inheritance
[2:08:48] the holy ghost
[2:08:50] to enforce the inheritance
[2:08:53] i want to tell you
[2:08:55] if you don't know you have the holy
[2:08:56] ghost maybe you don't have it
[2:08:59] if you don't have the holy ghost you
[2:09:01] have no enforcer in your life
[2:09:05] to bring the inheritance
[2:09:07] set it in your heart and say lord
[2:09:10] give me the holy ghost
[2:09:12] this weekend
[2:09:14] give me the holy ghost
[2:09:15] before i leave here
[2:09:17] and if you think you have the holy ghost
[2:09:20] iran said a statement here
[2:09:22] that i'm persuaded that many of us have
[2:09:24] received the holy ghost see the holy
[2:09:26] ghost comes in different levels
[2:09:31] and it takes us to a place where we
[2:09:32] don't want to tell lies you
[2:09:35] feel bad when you do something wrong
[2:09:37] but god wants to fill every fiber of his
[2:09:39] church
[2:09:41] he wants to feel your thinking
[2:09:43] he wants to fill your mind
[2:09:45] he wants to feel every bit of you
[2:09:48] just to make you completely totally dead
[2:09:50] to yourself or to your thinking
[2:09:53] just so surrendered in god till his word
[2:09:56] is just
[2:09:57] living right through you amen
[2:10:00] if tonight we can open our hearts and
[2:10:02] say lord
[2:10:04] oh bring the enforcer
[2:10:07] of the inheritance
[2:10:08] that from today
[2:10:11] know that i'll have victory
[2:10:12] but i'll have you know like the octane
[2:10:15] power yes
[2:10:17] to take me out of here
[2:10:19] that's right i don't know whether it's a
[2:10:20] four-engine plane or what octane
[2:10:25] you know
[2:10:26] but elijah saw this the child coming
[2:10:31] there is a path
[2:10:37] enoch knew
[2:10:39] that that day he was not coming back he
[2:10:41] couldn't tell anyone
[2:10:43] no wonder the prophet said one day in
[2:10:45] nine o'clock in the morning we will know
[2:10:47] right
[2:10:49] but what is happening is that there's a
[2:10:50] path that we have to walk to that land
[2:10:53] and that's why we must walk on it every
[2:10:55] day because that's our inheritance
[2:10:58] it doesn't take persuasion to walk on
[2:11:00] that path it's god's hand that is
[2:11:02] leading us on that path
[2:11:05] the holy ghost is our light
[2:11:08] and tonight
[2:11:10] how many are really hungering for the
[2:11:12] holy ghost
[2:11:14] if you even have the holy ghost say lord
[2:11:16] fill me a little bit more
[2:11:19] in the book of hearts the disciples got
[2:11:20] together with one accord and the bible
[2:11:22] says he came and filled them
[2:11:24] and you haven't received it there's no
[2:11:26] little child or big man
[2:11:28] john the baptist received the holy ghost
[2:11:29] in the in the belly of the mother
[2:11:32] but could he feel us afraid this morning
[2:11:34] tonight
[2:11:36] that our walk even will change
[2:11:38] that something will change in our lives
[2:11:41] because we are living
[2:11:43] the world is gone
[2:11:45] you don't have anything in a bank or
[2:11:47] food or gas or something to look for
[2:11:50] there's a better world there's a better
[2:11:51] thing coming
[2:11:53] and if this is the last sermon i'll tell
[2:11:55] you you need the holy ghost to get out
[2:11:56] of here
[2:11:59] we need more of the holy ghost i do too
[2:12:02] how many will stand up with me and say
[2:12:04] lord share the holy ghost afresh in my
[2:12:08] heart
[2:12:09] yes
[2:12:10] let's raise our hands to him
[2:12:13] and pray

[2:24:13] to us tonight
[2:24:15] [Music]
[2:24:21] if you actually study the book of hebrew
[2:24:24] you realize that paul was dealing with
[2:24:26] inheritance
[2:24:29] he was trying to tell
[2:24:31] those jewish believers
[2:24:35] that everything that was
[2:24:36] in the old testament
[2:24:38] was represented
[2:24:40] in christ jesus
[2:24:43] in christ jesus we got a better high
[2:24:45] priest
[2:24:47] in christ jesus we got a better temple
[2:24:50] in christ jesus we got a better
[2:24:52] sacrifice
[2:24:55] he was trying to he was trying to get
[2:24:58] them to see it
[2:25:01] just like brother wilson said tonight if
