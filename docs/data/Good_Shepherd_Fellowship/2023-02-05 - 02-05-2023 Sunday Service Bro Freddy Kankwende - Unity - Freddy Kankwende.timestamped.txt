[44:39] channel Yes precious life story life
[44:41] story is a message
[44:43] praise the Lord
[44:46] but you know uh uh
[44:52] in the way that we we have built
[44:55] sometimes there are things that that
[44:58] that make significance to you and and uh
[45:03] you know and then it just it just uh
[45:06] the Lord just have a way of bringing it
[45:08] together and then you say oh wow I never
[45:10] I never thought about it this way though
[45:12] I never saw it this way
[45:14] as the
[45:17] uh commemorating the 28 wedding
[45:20] anniversary is uh somehow
[45:24] special to us as a church because this
[45:28] year will make this church 28 years
[45:35] yeah this year we'll make this church 28
[45:37] years
[45:38] and uh and uh yeah we we uh playing
[45:42] mauritian devils
[45:45] and you know before the marriage and
[45:47] divorce series started brother but
[45:49] Jordan played that little wedding that
[45:52] took place just before brother Branham
[45:54] went into the marriage and divorce
[45:56] series
[45:57] so I was sitting in the office when the
[45:59] when uh you know when the the tip was
[46:03] playing and you know all the wedding
[46:06] music was going on I was saying oh my
[46:08] God who's getting married this morning
[46:11] you know so
[46:15] so I sent for brother Jordan as I wanted
[46:18] to tell him as he just keep the music
[46:20] and go right into what the prophet said
[46:22] he says he said no he's you know it fit
[46:26] in into our time so he's fit
[46:31] but you know as as you sit back and and
[46:35] you look at things you know uh
[46:39] which of course we grow to understand
[46:42] that even as you come to church you come
[46:45] all the time you sit down there are
[46:48] things that happen you know it looks
[46:49] like things just go in in a kind of a
[46:52] routine the song leader comes up he
[46:55] leads songs the preacher comes up he
[46:57] preach you know we pray we go home we
[47:00] come back and sometimes is is we grow to
[47:04] understand what God is doing you know we
[47:09] grow to understand what the Lord is
[47:11] doing uh in the midst of his people you
[47:14] know so
[47:17] uh so as I sit back and and uh you know
[47:21] well just just thinking about the whole
[47:24] marriage and the whole series with the
[47:26] church I know I promise to to speak on
[47:30] uh on uh some things for the young
[47:33] people and that was the reason why I
[47:35] decided that we played the entire
[47:37] marriage in the World Series but then it
[47:39] became more in a place of a teaching you
[47:42] know because just like I said you would
[47:44] never understand marriage and divorce
[47:47] until you really studied the entire
[47:49] series
[47:50] you know but Brian preaching marriage
[47:53] and divorce even in the beginning of his
[47:55] message he says and he says and that's
[47:57] the reason why I spoke yesterday on the
[48:00] only place of worship you know so all of
[48:03] those things are tied together
[48:05] you know they are very well tied
[48:07] together
[48:09] so uh uh uh we want to say it's uh uh
[48:14] congratulations to uh brother uh Freddie
[48:17] and Sister Charlotte on their 28th
[48:20] wedding anniversary but it means a whole
[48:23] lot to us you know because also 28 is a
[48:26] special number you know brother Brandon
[48:28] who says in the message uh the call out
[48:32] he says wash the nature of this angel
[48:36] bring in the last message Before
[48:39] Destruction
[48:40] he said Abraham
[48:43] I'm going to keep my promise to you I
[48:47] love that
[48:49] that's our Father God
[48:52] I will keep my promise to you
[48:55] just about the time of life
[48:59] I call in to the time of Life about the
[49:03] next 28 days I'm going to visit you
[49:07] praise the Lord so we know that 28 is is
[49:11] a season of life
[49:13] naturally and scripturally
[49:17] okay so when God told Abraham I call
[49:21] into the time of life he was actually
[49:24] breathing on them uh the season of life
[49:28] right there there was a change that took
[49:31] place in Syria then she went through the
[49:33] stage that a woman would go through
[49:35] before she have a baby
[49:37] now so uh it's a season of life and for
[49:43] me what I think about it and what I will
[49:46] desire that it would mean to this uh uh
[49:49] little assembling it will be the life of
[49:53] God upon the people praise the Lord
[49:56] would now want to make any kind of a
[49:59] mysterious thing out of Faith but uh you
[50:02] know our desire is that God will be able
[50:05] to uh affect our lives and bring us into
[50:09] a relationship with him praise the Lord
[50:11] that's the most thing that matters for
[50:15] us getting in a relationship with the
[50:17] Lord Jesus
[50:19] that's that's a whole lot to do people
[50:21] and we are living in such a time where
[50:25] there was an image I was going to show
[50:27] to you I never I never thought to send
[50:30] it to the
[50:32] to the to the technician so I will I

[1:19:18] but the Vietnam is speaking about the
[1:19:20] Magis
[1:19:23] uh
[1:19:26] major is in the time of the Bible
[1:19:31] they were the they were studying the
[1:19:34] Heavenly uh Celestial uh
[1:19:37] Stars let me put it that way
[1:19:41] they were studying it
[1:19:45] and there were three Mages that were
[1:19:47] coming from the East
[1:19:57] they were studying stars and that was
[1:20:00] the job
[1:20:01] it is
[1:20:08] they knew one thing
[1:20:12] the
[1:20:14] [Music]
[1:20:18] when they were looking and noticed the
[1:20:21] three stars of the birth of uh cam uh
[1:20:25] jacket
[1:20:29] only and if all those three stars will
[1:20:32] line up
[1:20:36] they know that the Messiah was on Earth
[1:20:47] I don't know if you can hear me properly
[1:20:49] okay okay
[1:20:52] let's see
[1:20:57] and the majors the three matches
[1:21:05] Ensemble said if those three stars will
[1:21:08] line up together
[1:21:11] the Messiah is on Earth
[1:21:16] who is the Messiah let me see the
[1:21:20] Messiah is
[1:21:24] the union between God and Men
[1:21:32] lost this position in the presence of
[1:21:35] the Lord
[1:21:38] before the Garden of Eden
[1:21:42] man lost his position
[1:21:45] because of sin
[1:21:48] but the Messiah had to come
[1:21:51] and when the Messiah came is
[1:21:59] the the uniting uh
[1:22:08] between men and God
[1:22:12] he was he was the hope man
[1:22:17] because men lost whole hopeless
[1:22:22] even when Moses brought the law
[1:22:26] it didn't work
[1:22:34] they were still making mistake and
[1:22:36] compromising with the law
[1:22:39] foreign
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:52] between men and God
[1:22:56] exactly and that's the union that I
[1:22:58] would want to speak about this this
[1:23:00] afternoon
[1:23:01] and the major eyes
[1:23:12] well when they have seen all these three
[1:23:14] stars together
[1:23:18] was on Earth
[1:23:21] are you here with me
[1:23:24] but us
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:30] we have to look at the calendar of God
[1:23:33] for today
[1:23:36] let's get you because God in February
[1:23:42] it does not do anything contrary to
[1:23:44] Nature
[1:23:49] it's also a Bible for God
[1:23:53] if it is
[1:23:54] and God will do things according to
[1:23:57] Nature
[1:23:59] and if you you pay attention today
[1:24:05] you would notice that even before in
[1:24:08] order for us to have rain
[1:24:10] and the clouds has to come together
[1:24:14] and the clouds will work together and
[1:24:17] work together it's awesome and together
[1:24:20] and it will be a big block of of clouds
[1:24:25] and then the cloud will be dark
[1:24:28] and now we'll see the rain falling now
[1:24:31] and that's United United
[1:24:34] I want to draw your attention to it
[1:24:40] and they will gather themselves together
[1:24:43] and clouds
[1:24:46] they were gathered together
[1:24:49] they will unite together
[1:24:52] and after we see the rainfall
[1:24:56] s
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:25:01] you know nature more than that I guess
[1:25:07] and we've seen uh we saw an animal on
[1:25:10] the road coming
[1:25:13] out
[1:25:15] and people are really conservative
[1:25:17] they're really looking at nature
[1:25:22] if you look at fishes
[1:25:27] before they migrate
[1:25:32] during the the spring
[1:25:36] and during the Spring the fishes will
[1:25:39] migrate
[1:25:41] but before
[1:25:44] the migration
[1:25:48] they will always gather together
[1:25:51] foreign
[1:25:54] that's nature
[1:25:58] they will gather themselves together
[1:26:01] and now they will move together
[1:26:07] it's a sign
[1:26:12] there's a sign that there's a union
[1:26:14] somewhere
[1:26:18] now know this
[1:26:21] foreign
[1:26:31] we know really well what dogs are
[1:26:36] some ducks usually got themselves
[1:26:39] together

[1:27:19] and night is only men
[1:27:25] to be bored only men get bored
[1:27:33] to be only men gets bored
[1:27:41] because the man does not realize who is
[1:27:44] his chief in this time in this hour
[1:27:48] knew us
[1:27:51] as children of God no difference
[1:27:57] we have to understand who is our chief
[1:27:59] for this time
[1:28:03] because in this time we have a chief
[1:28:26] that's William Branham
[1:28:30] [Applause]
[1:28:42] men is so confused
[1:28:46] he goes on his own way but Branham says
[1:28:49] he
[1:28:52] is a dream
[1:28:55] in that specific dreams and I get off my
[1:28:59] subject a little bit
[1:29:01] he call people

[2:34:46] that are happening around us you know is
[2:34:49] telling us now with everything that is
[2:34:51] built in between Israel and and Iran
[2:34:55] Israel trying to to stop Iran in all the
[2:34:59] the explosives that they are building in
[2:35:02] Iran is a great supporter of Russia
[2:35:05] so now Israel is bumping up to stand
[2:35:08] with Ukraine so all of these things that
[2:35:10] are happening I mean things are
[2:35:12] happening so fast
[2:35:13] they're they're I mean you don't want to
[2:35:17] be caught on the way
[2:35:18] you are a people that have been taught a
[2:35:22] people that have sat under the message
[2:35:24] unless you are just listening to it for
[2:35:26] fun
[2:35:28] but these things must not take us on the
[2:35:31] way
[2:35:33] so I believe the message our brother
[2:35:36] Freddie preached it's a timely message
[2:35:40] if you are paying attention to the
[2:35:42] things that are happening around the
[2:35:43] world the things that are happening even
[2:35:45] right here in the United States
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:49] the only thing that is telling us is is
[2:35:53] we must get back to the basic
[2:35:55] we must get back to the things that are
[2:35:57] important
[2:35:59] [Music]
[2:36:03] praise the Lord
[2:36:05] amen
[2:36:07] and I mean uh he spoke there about
[2:36:10] representation is scripture you know
[2:36:12] it's representation Paul says by one
[2:36:15] man's sin that's Romans chapter 5 and by
[2:36:18] one man also so that's the reason why
[2:36:21] God raised up one man in every age
[2:36:25] and we come under that that man message
[2:36:30] [Music]
[2:36:32] praise the Lord
[2:36:34] brother Branham he types uh uh uh the
[2:36:38] the the lining of the of the of the the
[2:36:41] stars that the wise men saw uh he talked
[2:36:47] that with the lining of the five stars
[2:36:49] that that you know that was up there in
[2:36:51] uh uh
[2:36:53] uh 1961. now so brother Branham tied
[2:36:57] there to to make us to understand that
[2:37:00] if if that was a message that was
[2:37:04] announcing the birth
[2:37:07] of the word
[2:37:09] it announced the breath of Christ
[2:37:12] praise the Lord he says what what is
[2:37:16] this five they're lining up of this five
[2:37:19] star also announcing is announcing that
[2:37:22] another word is about to be born
[2:37:25] that was announcing the opening of the
[2:37:28] seals
[2:37:30] Christ to be birthed in the manger of
[2:37:33] our heart
[2:37:34] that's what it was announcing
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:43] praise the Lord
[2:37:45] and we cannot follow all of uh things
[2:37:49] that people are saying on the internet
[2:37:51] about the message about brother Branham
[2:37:54] for us to start to draw back in our
[2:37:57] shared and start to hide away from
[2:37:59] identifying with the message or
[2:38:01] identifying with the prophet
[2:38:03] you cannot have a message until you have
[2:38:05] a messenger you cannot appreciate the
[2:38:07] message until you appreciate the
[2:38:09] messenger
[2:38:14] [Music]
[2:38:16] there's a farm balance in the midst of
[2:38:19] whatever people are doing what we do
[2:38:22] here we appreciate the messenger of the
[2:38:25] hour we appreciate the message of the
[2:38:27] hour
[2:38:28] [Music]
[2:38:33] and Jesus said blessed is he that is not
[2:38:36] offended to me thank you
[2:38:40] [Music]
[2:38:44] praise the Lord
[2:38:49] you know when you have uh when you have
[2:38:52] a translation
[2:38:54] and
[2:38:56] you as uh as an audience
[2:38:59] being people that are in the world and
[2:39:01] in the scripture you have to grab the
[2:39:03] thought of the preacher if you start to
[2:39:06] Major on the word the person will just
[2:39:07] say one thing and then you will just you
[2:39:10] will just flop out
[2:39:12] it's just because you are listening to
[2:39:14] grammar
[2:39:15] but there is an internal thought that is
[2:39:17] moving in the building and that's what
[2:39:20] God want to use to capture our heart to
[2:39:22] bring us up
[2:39:25] [Music]

[2:45:52] just few days ago
[2:45:55] I think it was yesterday or the day
[2:45:57] before I think yeah the day before
[2:46:00] yesterday
[2:46:04] China had a balloon in there
[2:46:07] running over Canada
[2:46:10] and and the President Joe body in order
[2:46:13] that it should be blown
[2:46:16] [Music]
[2:46:18] and the military couldn't do it because
[2:46:20] they were afraid that it was hanging
[2:46:22] over
[2:46:24] population so they were trying to wait
[2:46:27] for you to move over the ocean
[2:46:30] and when it got over the ocean they blew
[2:46:32] it up
[2:46:34] foreign
[2:46:35] intelligence
[2:46:40] [Music]
[2:46:43] all of these nations like the prophet
[2:46:45] taught us the spy on one another
[2:46:49] and with and we've all
[2:46:53] the the military and the nuclear
[2:46:57] things that is cramping around the world
[2:47:02] there is something that is cooking there
[2:47:05] are things that are happening
[2:47:09] it is not to make you afraid
[2:47:12] because you are not supposed to be
[2:47:14] afraid of it
[2:47:17] but it is for us to
[2:47:19] examine ourselves
[2:47:21] if the word is uniting in his power they
[2:47:25] are uniting their nuclear forces they
[2:47:28] are uniting their army they are uniting
[2:47:32] all their rights
[2:47:34] and they're uniting in every way
[2:47:38] God's people
[2:47:40] was to be uniting with the word
[2:47:43] is the word that keeps us together
[2:47:48] the word is our value
[2:47:51] that's the reason why we are here
[2:48:00] you are not spending time with the Lord
[2:48:02] you're not
[2:48:03] really spending time with the Lord in
[2:48:06] prayer
[2:48:08] if you have not got your ass together
[2:48:11] standing the word of God and having
[2:48:14] communion
[2:48:15] just having a long time with God
[2:48:23] this is just to remind you
[2:48:29] when the bride leaves from here when the
[2:48:31] Rapture take place
[2:48:37] even as we look at the dead and the time
[2:48:40] that we are living in the Bible says
[2:48:42] because iniquities are abound
[2:48:45] the love of many shall wash cold
[2:48:52] time that we spend
[2:48:55] talking about things that we have no
[2:48:57] business they're talking about a time we
[2:49:00] spend on TED Talk and Facebooking
[2:49:05] compare the time
[2:49:07] that you spent with the Lord
[2:49:10] what a meditating on his words what are
[2:49:12] listening to a message what a listening
[2:49:15] to a music in meditation just the time
[2:49:19] that we spend with the Lord you will
[2:49:21] realize that we spend
[2:49:23] less time
[2:49:27] and sometimes we have more time for
[2:49:30] nothing
[2:49:34] let's just use this little moment
[2:49:38] after the preaching of the word
[2:49:41] just like our brother said nature is
[2:49:44] God's Bible
[2:49:45] [Music]
[2:49:47] when the winter is coming the birds
[2:49:49] gather together
[2:49:52] to take their flight down south
[2:49:56] they always move together because there
[2:49:59] is strength in unity
[2:50:03] two were agreed upon anything
[2:50:06] [Music]
[2:50:14] but who cannot walk
[2:50:17] unless they agree they have to agree
[2:50:21] not agreeing on our opinion saying let
[2:50:24] it agree on what the word says
[2:50:26] if this is what the word says let's drop
[2:50:29] our feelings drop our thoughts drop our
[2:50:32] selfishness
[2:50:34] and just take what the word says
[2:50:40] let's just take this little moment I
[2:50:43] don't know where you are with the Lord
[2:50:47] but even as we will be back this evening
[2:50:50] for the community service let's use this
[2:50:53] time and put our hearts before the Lord
[2:50:58] and we are not on the place that we
[2:51:00] supposed to be it is not too late
[2:51:04] we can reconcile with God
[2:51:07] if we are not taking a stand for the
[2:51:09] word
[2:51:10] and we are not making a choice
[2:51:31] yes give me oil
[2:51:35] in my life keep me burning
[2:51:41] Lord I me
[2:51:47] this I Pray

[2:52:57] [Music]
[2:53:27] well you know the prophet of God said
[2:53:30] that
[2:53:32] all of these nations the China Russia
[2:53:35] and all of this nation you know God
[2:53:38] because of Prophecy
[2:53:41] God raised a miracle in such a place
[2:53:43] that she's the Envy of the word
[2:53:48] and it's all because of her support to
[2:53:51] Ukraine in outer base so she's a Target
[2:53:55] as she's an Envy of the world she's also
[2:53:58] a Target
[2:54:02] foreign
[2:54:06] get angry
[2:54:10] if he want to release a nuclear bomb
[2:54:12] he's not going to send it to Ukraine
[2:54:15] he's going to send it to the U.S
[2:54:19] because he knows it's the U.S that is
[2:54:21] empowering
[2:54:22] Ukraine he's not angry with Ukraine he's
[2:54:25] angry with the U.S
[2:54:28] because it's the U.S support to Nato
[2:54:31] that makes NATO what NATO is
[2:54:34] so we we are on a time bomb
